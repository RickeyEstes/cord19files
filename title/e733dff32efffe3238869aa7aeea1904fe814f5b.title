Non-hydrolyzable Diubiquitin Probes Reveal Linkage-Specific Reactivity of Deubiquitylating Enzymes Mediated by S2 Pockets In Brief Deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) use multiple ubiquitin-binding pockets to disassemble polyubiquitin chains. Most tools probing DUB specificity target pockets adjacent to the active site. The protease-resistant diUb probes described here monitor linkage specificity of an additional S2 pocket and provide kinetics that explain polyubiquitin chain specificity.
