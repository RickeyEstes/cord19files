Combination of multiplex reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification with an immunochromatographic strip for subtyping influenza A virus Multiplex RT-LAMP for HA and M genes was developed for subtyping influenza A virus. Multiplex RT-LAMP amplicons were simply analyzed by the colorimetric ICS detection. Multiplex RT-LAMP (40 min) and ICS detection (15 min) could be complete in 55 min. Detection sensitivity for the multi- plex RT-LAMP and ICS was 10 copies of viral RNA. Our methodology provides simple, rapid genetic analysis platform for viral detection
