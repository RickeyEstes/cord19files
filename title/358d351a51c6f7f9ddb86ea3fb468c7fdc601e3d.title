The Membrane Protein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Functions as a Novel Cytosolic Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern To Promote Beta Interferon Induction via a Toll- Like-Receptor-Related TRAF3-Independent Mechanism The driving force for M-mediated IFN-␤ production is most likely generated from inside the cells. M-mediated IFN-␤ induction was confirmed at the viral infection level since a point mutation at the V68 residue of M markedly inhibited SARS-CoV pseudovirally induced IFN-␤ production. Thus, the results in- dicate for the first time that SARS-CoV M protein may function as a cytosolic PAMP to stimulate IFN-␤ production by activating a TLR-related TRAF3-independent signaling cascade
