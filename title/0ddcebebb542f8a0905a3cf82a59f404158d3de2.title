Simultaneous Detection of CDC Category "A" DNA and RNA Bioterrorism Agents by Use of Multiplex PCR & RT-PCR Enzyme Hybridization Assays genomic DNA was 1×10 0~1 ×10 2 copies/mL for BA, FT and YP. The LOD for VZV whole organism was 1×10 -2 TCID 50 /mL. The LOD for recombinant controls ranged from 1×10 2~1 ×10 3 copies/mL for BA, FT, YP and VM. The RNA assay demonstrated LOD for RNA transcript controls of 1×10 4~1 ×10 6 copies/mL without extraction and 1×10 5~1 ×10 6 copies/mL with extraction for Ebola, RVF, Lassa and HSN. The LOD for dengue whole organisms was ~1×10 -4 dilution for dengue 1 and 2, 1×10 4 LD 50 /mL and 1×10 2 LD 50 /mL for dengue 3 and 4. The LOD without extraction for recombinant plasmid DNA controls was ~1×10 3 copies/mL (1.5 input copies/reaction) for Ebola
