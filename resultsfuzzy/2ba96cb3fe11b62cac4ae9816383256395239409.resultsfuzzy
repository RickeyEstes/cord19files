The majority of the cases (80.8 %) and controls (93.9 %) were not aware that they were in a group recommended by the health authority to receive influenza vaccination. Among the controls, a higher percentage (71 %) deemed vaccination to be 'unnecessary'. This revealed a failure of DH and health professionals in communicating the message that 'vaccination is recommended' to this age group. Given that there was an association between 'knowing oneself to be in the recommended group for flu vaccine' and vaccination, better communication of the risks might have improved the vaccination rate. A health promotion strategy on empowerment and enhancement of knowledge on this issue needs to be planned and supported by health-care policy. Studies suggested that previous influenza vaccination was a predictor for subsequent vaccination (OR 1.62-5.40) [19] [20] [21] [22] . However, past behaviour does not provide an insight into the reasons why a person chooses to be vaccinated. The vaccination coverage rate is price sensitive. This was demonstrated in this study and in countries which provided vaccine reimbursements to users [23, 24] . To receive influenza vaccination, most (95 %) people aged 50-64 years in the general Hong Kong population had to pay out-of-pocket. In this study, the odds of the cases being 'eligible for free government vaccine' were 6.4 times the controls. Among the cases, half (52 %) of them attended a private clinic or hospital and paid the vaccination fee. Many study cases and controls expressed they were willing to receive the vaccine if it was free or subsidised. Such a vaccination service could possibly increase the vaccination rate. There was only a mild association between chronic disease(s) and vaccination and the association was insignificant after the OR was adjusted (OR1.13, 95 % CI 0.65-1.96, p = 0.67). This result contradicted the findings of many studies that indicated that the presence of chronic diseases was one of the most persistent factors associated with vaccination [19, 20, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . ' Accept advice by health professional' was moderately associated with vaccination (OR2.67, 95 % CI 1. 19-5.99 , p = 0.02). Several other studies have shown that doctors' and health professionals' advice was associated with influenza vaccination [17, 31] . Health professionals had a duty to recommend vaccination to high-risk groups in order to protect them from influenza and severe complications. 'Had family member received flu vaccine' was associated with people's uptake of the vaccination, but 'accept advice from relatives and friends' was not. In Japan, advice from health professionals, family and/or close friends was strongly associated [17] . In the USA and other western countries, advice from family and/or close friends was not a significant factor in acceptance of influenza vaccination [32, 33] . This could possibly be due to the differences in cultural backgrounds between individuals in these countries. This study showed no association between vaccination and smoking and drinking. It is uncertain whether people were consistent in their health behaviours. Studies have proven that smoking is not associated with vaccination [21, 34] . No data was found on other health behaviours, such as drinking or frequent exercise, having a link to vaccination. Given past experiences of infectious disease epidemics in Hong Kong, people may be more inclined to receive vaccination to protect themselves in anticipation of the occurrence of a disease epidemic such as SARS or swine influenza.
