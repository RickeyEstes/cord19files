One hundred HBV-positive samples were all positive and 100 HBV-negative samples were all negative in the 3 different real-time PCR assays. These positive and negative samples were all genotyped and confirmed by the Human Serum Bank at the Korea National Research Resource Center (http://knrrb.knrrc.or.kr). Therefore, the Fig. 1 . Dynamic range of the ExiStation HBV diagnostic system. One copy/reaction was equivalent to 0.668 IU/mL.
