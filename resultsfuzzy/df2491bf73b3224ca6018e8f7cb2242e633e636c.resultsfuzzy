In 2015, an FETP competency evaluation was conducted before and after the introductory training for field epidemiologists. For the FETP competency evaluation, competency suggested by the CDC was translated into Korean and edited accordingly. Ten criteria and 16 items were evaluated. For techniques required for each competency, the trainees evaluated their own level of proficiency in the techniques on a 3-point scale [2] : point 1 refers to simply knowing the concept but lacking techniques to conduct tasks without others' help; point 2 refers to knowing the concept and being able to conduct tasks with limited help from others; and point 3 refers to being able to conduct tasks without others' help, to coach others, and to solve problems in a creative way. According to evaluation conducted in 2015 before and after the introductory training for field epidemiologists, the scores improved significantly from 1.43 before the training to 2.04 after the training (p < 0.001). The descriptions of each area and competency are shown in Table 6 .
