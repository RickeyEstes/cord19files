To induce subclinical in utero infection, we directly inoculated two conceptuses (a fetus with fetal membranes; on average pigs have 14-16 fetuses) from three sows with 10 5 TCID 50 /fetus of the ZIKV PRVABC59 strain at 53-54 gd (S1 Video; Fig 1A and 1B; S1 Fig) . Litters with sham-inoculated conceptuses from three sows were used as controls. Mothers did not show clinical signs. All pregnant pigs were synchronized and delivered at term (114-115 days) . Control and experimental litters contained 10.6% and 15.9% dead newborns, respectively (S1A Table; P = 0.67), which is in line with usual rates of fetal mortality in pigs [38, 39] . The number of weak piglets was also similar in both groups (S1A Table, P = 0.85). In utero Zika virus exposure did not significantly affect cranium diameter in piglets (P = 0.41; S1A Table) . While body weights at birth were lower in the ZIKV group (ZIKV group: 1.24±0.27 kg, control group: 1.36±0.35 kg, P = 0.05) (Fig 1C) , body weight gain was not affected (P = 0.92) (Fig 1C and 1D ). Brain weights in the ZIKV group (Fig 1E) had a slightly wider (P = 0.66) distribution (ZIKV group: coefficient of variation 7.9%, control group: coefficient of variation 4.2%). Brain to body weight ratio (Fig 1F) was also not affected (P = 0.08). Placental samples collected at birth and offspring brains did not have histopathological lesions (Fig 2A-2D) . To confirm in utero infection, we demonstrated high loads of ZIKV in amniotic membranes and placenta from all three ZIKV-exposed litters (Fig 2I; S1B Table) . We also detected ZIKV RNA by in situ hybridization in the placenta and by RT-qPCR targeting the negative strand of ZIKV RNA in the placenta and amniotic membranes (Fig 2E and 2F ; S1B Table) . These results confirm ZIKV transmission between siblings and productive, persistent infection in fetal membranes and placenta. All samples from control mothers and piglets were negative for ZIKV-specific IgG antibodies (Abs) (S1C Table) . In utero ZIKV exposure caused maternal infection as indicated by virus-specific IgG Ab in maternal plasma (Fig 2J; S1D Table) . Most probably, maternal infection was transient because maternal blood plasma samples were free for ZIKV RNA at all five sampling time-points as determined by RT-qPCR (S1B Table) . Moreover, in our previous studies, where we induced more severe in utero infection with higher viral doses, maternal endometrium and lymph nodes were free from ZIKV [18, 19, 37 ]. Next, we determined whether ZIKV replicated in fetuses and persisted in offspring. ZIKV-specific IgG Abs were detected in A porcine uterus has multiple fetuses (on average pigs have 14-16 fetuses) with each fetus possessing individual amniotic membrane and placenta. Two fetuses in each pregnant pig were directly inoculated (I) with ZIKV. See S1 Video for ultrasound-guided inoculation. Afterward, ZIKV spreads (II) between siblings and causes productive infection in (1) amniotic membranes, (2) placenta, and (3) fetal brains of directly inoculated and trans-infected not-manipulated fetuses [17] [18] [19] 37 ]. (C) Body weight, (D) body weight gain, (E) brain weight, and (F) brain/body weight ratio in control and ZIKV-exposed offspring. Solid lines represent mean values. Brains from offspring were collected at necropsy. See S1A Table for Histology, viral loads, and ZIKV-specific Ab responses. Hematoxylin-eosin staining in the placenta (sampled at birth) (A: control sow #122; B: ZIKV-inoculated sow #335) and neonatal brain (sampled at euthanasia, 37 days) (C: control piglet #2, sow 720; D: piglet #7 from ZIKV-inoculated sow 409). ZIKV-specific in situ hybridization in the placenta (sampled at birth) from control (E) and ZIKV (F) litters. Positive cells were found in a sample from pig #335. An immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) to detect and quantify ZIKV-specific IgG Ab in porcine blood plasma. Blood plasma from control (G) and ZIKV-exposed (H) offspring (sampled at birth). (I) ZIKV RNA loads in amniotic membrane and placenta determined by RT-qPCR. Solid lines represent mean values. The dotted line represents the limit of detection (LOD). See S1B Table for individual values. ZIKV-specific Ab in offspring blood plasma detected by IPMA (J). All samples from the control litters were negative. Black dots-Ab titers in maternal blood. Offspring blood at birth was collected before first colostrum feeding. Offspring were subdivided into two subgroups based on ZIKV-specific serological status at birth: negative for Ab at birth-"N" and positive for Ab at birth-"P." Solid lines represent mean values. The dotted line represents LOD. See S1C Table for blood plasma from a subset of newborns in all three exposed litters (Fig 2J; S1C Table) . In pigs, maternal Abs do not pass to porcine fetuses through the placenta [40] ; however, it is being transferred passively to offspring via colostrum. Blood plasma samples from all newborns were collected before first colostrum ingestion, and high Ab titers demonstrated productive fetal infection and subsequent in utero Ab responses (Fig 2J; S1C Table) . Two ZIKVspecific RT-qPCR assays did not show viral RNA in the blood plasma, cerebrum, and cerebellum from all exposed and control piglets (including stillborn and weak piglets) (S1B Table) . Altogether, we induced subclinical persistent in utero infection which did not cause readily identifiable clinical pathology and productive infection in offspring.
