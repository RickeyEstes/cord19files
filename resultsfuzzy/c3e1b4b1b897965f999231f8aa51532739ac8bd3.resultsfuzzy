The full blood count in most patients shows either a normal haemoglobin or a mild anaemia. White cell count abnormalities are common. Leukopenia, defined as either a total white cell count <5000 or 4000/mL occurs in 27e84%, lymphopenia [<1000 (>7 years) to <1500/mL (2 to 6 years)] in 16e55%, any degree of neutropenia (<2000 or <2200/mL) in 30e50% of patients in Vietnam and Indonesia, severe neutropenia (<1000/mL) in <10%. Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150,000/mL) is common (31e 64%) 22, 35 and severe thrombocytopenia (<50,000/mL) affected 10% of Indonesian patients. 30 Using the International Society of Thrombosis and Homeostasis definition, 38 disseminated intravascular coagulation is present in up to 20e25% of patients but spontaneous bleeding from mucosal or venepuncture sites is reported in <10%. 24, 27, 35 A number of patients may have raised ddimers but normal PTs and aPTTs with a low or normal fibrinogen concentrations, consistent with H5N1 fibrinolysis. 24, 30 Liver enzymes are generally moderately elevated with higher AST (3e10 Â ULN) values compared to ALT (up to 4 Â ULN) values; AST and ALT values exceeding 1000 and 400, respectively, have been seen in some patients. Where measured the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) has also been high (2e10 Â ULN) and is most likely to be of lung origin. 27, 33, 35 The serum creatinine may be mild or moderately raised and urine microscopy, where reported, has been unremarkable aside from proteinuria and microscopic haematuria. The creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) may be raised up to 10 fold above the upper limit of normal but acute rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria and renal impairment have not yet been reported. There are no published data on the CPKmb fraction or on cardiac troponins. Raised blood glucose concentrations in patients without known diabetes mellitus have been observed at presentation, consistent with a stress induced hyperglycaemia, and during hospital admission, usually in association with steroid use and have required intravenous insulin treatment in some patients. 24, 28, 34, 35 Pleural fluid may be straw coloured or haemorrhagic with high total protein and LDH concentrations, meeting the Light criteria for an exudate, and may be H5N1 positive. 30, 39 Radiology Radiographic pneumonia has occurred in almost all hospitalised patients but these changes are not H5N1 specific. Chest X-ray (CXR) shadowing has included diffuse, multifocal or patchy infiltrates, interstitial infiltrates, lobular consolidation with air bronchograms, pneumothoraces and pneumomediastina. 40, 41 Sequential CXR shadows may worsen in parallel with the clinical state of the patient (Fig. 3) . Findings on chest CT scan have been consistent but have also shown destroyed lung architecture, persistent ground glass attenuation, segmental consolidation, pseudocavitation, pneumatoceles, lymphadenopathy, centrilobular nodules and post recovery fibrosis (Fig. 3 ).
