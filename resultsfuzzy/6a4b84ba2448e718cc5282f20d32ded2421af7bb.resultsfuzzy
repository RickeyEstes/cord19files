We created two HaCaT keratinocyte cell lines with stably knockeddown cytosolic CyP40 gene. RT-PCR confirmed a 99% decrease of CyP40 expression in the PPID-6 cell line and a 90% decrease in the PPID-7 cell line compared to the control cell line transfected with empty vector (Fig. 1 ). There were no significant differences in expression levels of CyP40 between the control cell line transfected with empty vector and the parental untransfected HaCaT cells (data not shown). These two cell lines showed the same behavioral characteristics in all assays that were further performed.
