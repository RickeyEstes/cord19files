Prefabricated Ci-I Hydrogels Adapt to Injection Site Geometry and Maintain Initial Mechanical Properties after Injection. Gelatin has been extensively used for various biomedical applications because of its biocompatibility, bioactivity, biodegradability, and availability. 57, 58 Gelatin hydrogels are especially useful as carrier materials of therapeutic cells and drugs. 59−61 However, the preparation of conventional chemically cross-linked gelatin hydrogels entails chemical modifications of the gelatin, and the obtained hydrogels are brittle with restricted network dynamics. 62−64 Therefore, in this study, we developed a strategy to prepare gelatin hydrogels containing both chemical and physical cross-linking based on unmodified gelatin. First, the synthesized free diffusing photocross-linkable Ac-β-CDs (acryloyl β-cyclodextrin, 1.5 acryloyl groups per Ac-β-CD molecule on average, i.e., a fraction of Ac-β-CDs bear more than one acryloyl group, Figure S1 ) were coupled to the aromatic residues of gelatin (e.g., phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) via host−guest interactions. Subsequently, UV-initiated polymerization of the Ac-β-CDs led to Ci-I hydrogels exhibited a sol−gel transition during switching between alternating high (1000%, unshaded region) and low (1%, shaded region) shear strain in the rheological test at 37°C. (c) A preformed Ci-I gelatin hydrogel was drawn into a syringe and then injected through a G21 needle into a culture plate well (used as the mold) to be remolded to the shape of the cell culture well. (d) Ci-I gelatin hydrogels sustained over 95% of compressive strain without rupture before or after injection. (e) Stress vs strain curves from a cyclic compression test of Ci-I hydrogels (peak strain, 60%; loading speed, 1 mm/s) at 37°C (inset: plot in the strain range 50−60%). the formation of gelatin hydrogels containing two types of crosslinks: (1) the physical host−guest complexations between the aromatic residues of the gelatin and oligomerized Ac-β-CDs, which are distributed throughout the entire hydrogel network; and (2) the chemical cross-links (due to the fraction of Ac-β-CDs bearing more than one acryloyl group) among the oligomerized Ac-β-CDs, the distribution of which is sparse and localized because of the inefficient reaction among the bulky Ac-β-CDs. The following experiments demonstrated that these gelatin hydrogels not only possessed unique dynamic properties including self-healing, shear-thinning, injectability, and cell infiltration capability due to the physical host−guest crosslinking but also showed adequate stability because of the localized chemical cross-linking for supporting long-term 3D culture of encapsulated cells. These hydrogels are therefore referred to as the "cell-infiltratable and injectable gelatin hydrogels" (Ci-I gelatin hydrogels) in the following sections. The rheological measurements further demonstrated the presence of both physical and chemical cross-linking within the Ci-I gelatin hydrogels. The Ci-I hydrogels showed an obvious frequency-dependent increase in the modulus (Figure 1a ), indicating the involvement of the physical host−guest complexation between gelatinous aromatic groups and β-CDs in stabilizing the hydrogel network. The further rheological studies revealed a "sol−gel" transition of the Ci-I hydrogels under alternating high/low shear strain (Scheme 1). The Ci-I hydrogels switched to the "sol" state (G″ > G′) under a high shear strain of ∼1000% and immediately recovered to the "gel" state (G′ > G″) under a subsequent low shear strain of 1% ( Figure 1b) . Moreover, even after repeated high/low shear loading cycles, the storage modulus (G′) of the Ci-I hydrogels consistently recovered to ∼80% (1050 Pa) of that of the freshly prepared unloaded samples (1373 Pa) (Figure 1b ). This slight reduction in storage modulus is likely attributed to the partial disruption of chemical cross-linking under loading. This excellent shear-thinning and self-healing capability enables the injection of Ci-I hydrogels without significantly compromising their mechanical properties. The prefabricated Ci-I hydrogel disks injected through a G21 needle into cylindrical models were efficiently remolded to regain the original disk morphology ( Figure 1c) . Moreover, the compression test showed that the injection did not significantly affect the mechanical properties of the Ci-I gelatin hydrogels, and the injected hydrogels could still sustain over 95% compressive strain without rupture as could the noninjected hydrogels ( Figure 1d ). Furthermore, after the first loading−unloading cycle, the Ci-I hydrogels exhibited almost coinciding loading−unloading stress versus strain curves obtained from the remaining loading cycles (peak strain: 60%), suggesting excellent resistance to excessive cyclic compression ( Figure 1e ). Previous studies 65−68 proved that well-designed injectable hydrogels could prevent encapsulated cells from damage of shear force during the injection through the syringe needle. To study whether our Ci-I gelatin hydrogels could maintain the viability of the encapsulated cell during the injection, we cultured hMSC-laden Ci-I gelatin hydrogels in vitro for 1 day before injecting the hydrogels through a G21 needle, and the injected hydrogels were further cultured in vitro for another 5 days. Figure S3 shows that the cell viability is still >90% even after injection, demonstrating the effective protection of the encapsulated cells by the injectable Ci-I gelatin hydrogels. Ci-I Hydrogels Mediate Sustained Delivery of a Hydrophobic Chemoattractant and Support Infiltration of Cells. Sustained delivery of small hydrophobic molecules via hydrogels is typically challenging because the hydrophilic nature and large mesh size of hydrogel networks make loading and long-term release of small hydrophobic molecules rather difficult. Because a significant excess of Ac-β-CDs (compared with gelatinous aromatic residues) were used to fabricate Ci-I hydrogels, there were a considerable number of unoccupied β- CD moieties conjugated to the hydrogel network. β-CD is commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry to improve the solubility of hydrophobic drugs. 69−71 We utilized the empty β-CD cavities in Ci-I hydrogels to deliver a small hydrophobic chemical molecule, icaritin, which can reduce SAON incidence by inhibiting both thrombosis and lipid deposition. 72 The icaritin-laden Ci-I gelatin hydrogels were capable of releasing icaritin continuously for up to 2 weeks (Figure 2a) . Therefore, these findings demonstrate that the injectable Ci-I gelation hydrogels can serve as a promising delivery vehicle of small hydrophobic molecular drugs for treating pathological conditions including SAON in a minimally invasive fashion. Our previous research also showed that an anabolic and potent molecule icaritin can function as a chemoattractant to induce the directed migration of MSCs within a short time frame. 72 The dynamic and weak cross-links based on host−guest complexation of our Ci-I gelatin hydrogel can potentially support cell infiltration and migration. To demonstrate this, we seeded MSCs on the surface of Ci-I hydrogels with or without the loaded icaritin. enzymes might not be significant enough to support such extensive cell infiltration within the short period of 24 h. We speculated that the cell infiltration was likely facilitated by the disruption of the weak host−guest cross-links in Ci-I hydrogels by cellular forces. Therefore, we speculate that, once implanted into the defect sites, the icaritin-laden Ci-I gelatin hydrogels can promote the recruitment and infiltration of endogenous cells into the hydrogel matrix, thereby speeding up the repair and regeneration of bone defects. Ci-I Hydrogel Attenuates the Adverse Effect of High-Dosage Corticosteroid during Stem Cell Differentiation. We then evaluated the efficacy of the Ci-I hydrogel as an injectable carrier of therapeutic cells to treat SAON by examining the osteogenesis of MSCs encapsulated in the Ci-I gelatin hydrogels in the presence of a high concentration of Quantitative analysis of micro-CT for the bone in the "peri-tunnel" (b) and "within tunnel" (c) space. One-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc tests were used to analyze the data (n = 6, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). (d) Goldener's Trichrome staining of the bonelike tissue within the bone tunnel. Scale bar: 500 μm (micro-CT images in part a); 100 μm (HE staining in part a and Goldener's staining in part d). corticosteroid. The majority of MSCs encapsulated in the Ci-I gelatin hydrogels were viable and spread to adopt a stellate morphology after 2 weeks of culture (Figure 3a) , indicating that the dynamic Ci-I hydrogel network provides a permissive 3D environment to facilitate cell−matrix interactions. Then, we evaluated the differentiation of MSCs encapsulated in hydrogels under different culture conditions. Previous studies showed that dexamethasone (Dex), a clinically used corticosteroid, improved the osteogenesis of MSCs at low concentration but promoted the adipogenesis of MSCs at high concentration. 73, 74 Our RT-PCR data indeed showed that a low media concentration of Dex (100 nM, "100Dex") promoted the expression of osteogenic markers (ALP and Runx2), whereas a high media concentration (500 nM, "500Dex") of Dex up-regulated the expression of adipogenic markers of the MSCs encapsulated in hydrogels (CEBPα and PPARγ) (Figure 3b ). In contrast, media supplementation of icaritin effectively suppressed the expression of adipogenic marker genes and promoted that of osteogenic marker gene, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), of the encapsulated MSCs under a high media concentration of Dex (Figure 3b , Figure S4 for corresponding images) and (b) cells positive for both Osterix and Runx2 using immunofluorescent staining. The data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test (n = 4). (c) Immunofluorescent staining at week 6 after SAON surgical treatment in SD rats (negative control group in Figure S5 ).

Injection of Ci-I gelatin hydrogels, which were loaded with both MSCs and icaritin ("icaritin+MSC+Gel"), activated β-catenin and osteocalcin signaling but inhibited the inflammatory response and adipogenesis. The quantitative data are shown in Figure S6 .

The quantitative analyses of the bone formation rate at week 3 (h) and week 6 (i) postsurgery were obtained by analyzing the images in part g. The data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test (n = 4). ***P < 0.001; scale bar, 100 μm (part c). "500Dex+icaritin (M)"). The upregulation of another osteogenic marker gene Runx2 is insignificant. We speculated that it was because the Runx2 gene expression data were collected at late time points, day 7 and 14, while the Runx2 is typically upregulated in MSCs at early time points upon osteogenic induction, and correlation between osteogenesis of MSCs and Runx2 expression becomes less significant at late time points. 75 Furthermore, the Ci-I gelatin hydrogels that were loaded with a bolus dose of icaritin ("500Dex+icaritin (H)") without icaritin supplementation produced similar expression levels of the differentiation marker genes as those of "500Dex+icaritin (M)", which received fresh icaritin supplementation after each media change (Figure 3b ). Von Kossa staining (Figure 3c ) and the Runx2, OCN, CEBPα, and PPARγ immunohistochemical staining (Figure 3d ) showed trends consistent with that of the RT-PCR. These results demonstrate that the Ci-I gelatin hydrogels are likely capable of mediating sustained delivery of small hydrophobic molecular drugs (e.g., icaritin) to counteract the adverse effects (e.g., bone necrosis) of high-concentration corticosteroids in the long term. Codelivery of MSC and Icaritin via Ci-I Hydrogels Enhances Bone Regeneration in SAON Model. We further evaluated the efficacy of Ci-I gelatin hydrogels encapsulated with MSCs and icaritin to boost bone regeneration in a SAON model. Figure 4a showed that the injection of Ci-I gelatin hydrogels helped to prevent a decrease in BMD around the tunnel compared to the nontreated control group (no hydrogel implantation, "Blank"). The "icaritin+MSC+Gel" group showed significantly enhanced new bone formation in the tunnel ( Figure  4a ). Quantitative measurement of the micro-CT images showed that the "icaritin+MSC+Gel" group exhibited significant elevation in BV/TV, trabecular number, while trabecular thickness and a reduction in trabecular separation, as compared to the other groups, in both the peri-tunnel native bone ( Figure  4b ) and neobone tissue inside the tunnel (Figure 4c ). Using Goldener's Trichrome staining, we also further confirmed that the bone tunnel was filled with neobone in the "icaritin+MSC +Gel" group ( Figure 4d ). In contrast, only fibrous tissue was formed in the other groups without supplementation of icaritin (Figure 4d) . We further examined the harvested samples to assess the bone regeneration within the drilled tunnel. Immunofluorescent staining against Ki67, a marker widely used to identify proliferating cells, showed significantly more Ki67 positive cells in the tunnel region injected with the Ci-I gelatin hydrogels, which were loaded with both MSCs and icaritin ("icaritin+MSC +Gel"), as compared to that of either hydrogel alone ("Gel") or hydrogel plus icaritin ("icaritin+Gel") treatment groups ( Figure  5a) . Moreover, the "icaritin+MSC+Gel" group also exhibited the most intense staining against key osteogenic markers, Runx2 and Osterix (Figure 5b,c) . At week 3 after the hydrogel implantation, the expressions of active β-catenin and OCN were upregulated in the "icaritin+MSC+Gel" group (Figure 5d and Figure S6a ) compared to those of the other groups, and this may have contributed to the enhanced bone formation. In contrast, PPARγ expression was dramatically decreased (Figure 5e and Figure S6b ), indicating suppressed adipogenesis, and this is consistent with our previous in vitro findings (Figure 3d) . The icaritin-laden hydrogels ("icaritin+MSC+Gel" and "icaritin +Gel") also exhibited significantly elevated expression of another proliferation marker, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), in addition to Ki67 at week 6 ( Figure 5a and Figure  S4 ), regardless of MSC supplementation. In addition, the "icaritin+MSC+Gel" group showed slightly reduced expression of c-Src, a detrimental factor that has been identified as a therapeutic target for osteonecrosis. 55 CSF-1R, a tyrosine-kinase transmembrane receptor, 76 was greatly reduced in the "icaritin +MSC+Gel" and "icaritin+Gel" groups, indicating the potential immunoregulative effect of icaritin, as reported by a previous study. 77 More importantly, this finding suggests that icaritin and MSCs delivered by Ci-I hydrogels can potentially mitigate the foreign body response to biomaterial implantations, thereby facilitating further translational applications. 76 By using calcein green (CG) and xylenol orange (XO) to dynamically assess the bone formation rate, at week 3 and 6 postsurgery we found that treatment with hydrogel alone ("Gel") did not affect bone formation within the bone tunnel (Figure 5f−i) . Incorporation of icaritin in the injected hydrogels ("icaritin+Gel") significantly increased the bone formation rate compared to either blank repair or the "Gel" group (Figure 5f−i) . The encapsulation of both exogenous MSCs and icaritin in the hydrogels ("icaritin +MSC+Gel") further enhanced bone formation in the defect site (Figure 5f−i) . These data demonstrate that the Ci-I gelatin hydrogel is an excellent carrier of cells and hydrophobic drugs for promoting in situ bone regeneration and treating SAON. Delivery of Icaritin by Ci-I Hydrogels Facilitates the Recruitment of Endogenous Cells To Expedite the Healing of SAON in Vivo. Our in vitro data have demonstrated that icaritin-laden Ci-I gelatin hydrogels can attract MSCs to infiltrate and migrate into hydrogels (Figure 2b) . To evaluate the cell recruitment in vivo, immediately after the core decompression surgery and treatment with hydrogel injections in the created tunnel, we injected SPIO-labeled MSCs (1 million cells in 100 μL of media) in the ipsilateral tibia of the same limb. Six weeks postsurgery, the SPIO-labeled MSCs were hardly found within and around the tunnels with no hydrogel implantation ("Blank") or with blank hydrogel implantation ("Gel") ( Figure 6 ). However, significantly more SPIO-labeled MSCs were found within and around the tunnels which were injected with hydrogels containing either icaritin alone ("icaritin +Gel") or both MSCs and icaritin ("icaritin+MSC+Gel") ( Figure 6 ). This is consistent with our previous finding that icaritin can directly promote the migration of MSCs by upregulating the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). 54 These data further demonstrated that the icaritin-laden Ci-I gelatin hydrogels can recruit endogenous MSCs from the surrounding tissues to migrate to the bone defects, thereby promoting new bone formation.
