Using our model of oligopolistic competition with differentiated products among airlines presented in details in a technical appendix below, we compute the equilibrium prices for each airline and the implied passenger demand under different situations. After obtaining these equilibrium values, we can compute marginal costs, own price elasticities, market shares, profits and consumer surpluses for each airline. Table 3 presents these values for the current situation and under two scenarios: i) The equilibrium where all European airlines are charged by the tax; ii) the equilibrium where the solidarity tax is absent. In the first case all countries implement the solidarity tax; hence all airlines are charged for their whole network. In the second case, there is no solidarity tax at all. The solidarity tax has increased the average price for the European airlines by 0:08% and could increase average prices by almost 1% if it is applied to all European airlines. We find that the marginal cost of airlines has increased by 0:13% in average due to the current solidarity tax. If all European countries implement the tax then it could result in a 1:65% rise in marginal cost. If France removes the solidarity tax, the passenger traffic would increase by 0:18% which would lead to a 0:21% increase in the market share of the airlines. In other words, airlines would attract passengers who are using other modes of transportation or not travelling. In the absence of the solidarity tax, there would be a 0:14% increase in airlines' profits and a 0:35% increase in consumer surplus. Hence, the ticket price elasticity would increase by 0:95%; therefore, the passengers becomes more price sensitive if all countries implement the solidarity tax, which is coherent with economic theory. The impact on Air France and all other carriers in our dataset is presented in Table 4 . A solidarity tax implemented by all countries would lead to a 0:17% increase in Air France prices while the price increase would be 1:05% for the other airlines in our sample. If France removes the solidarity tax, the passenger traffic would increase by 1:7% while for other airlines, this would lead to a decrease of 0:03%. The removal of tax would lead to a fall in the average price both for Air France (0:39%) and for other carriers (0:05%). The market shares for Air France would increase while for other airlines the market share would almost not change in average. Hence, one can conclude that there would be more people using air transportation. Finally, these numbers compared to the growth rate of the air traffic show that the impact of the solidarity tax would be very small. Table 5 below displays the simulation results for average price and passenger traffic volume as well as the current ones for different airlines. In the case that the solidarity tax is adopted by all countries, Air France would have a 0:17% further increase in its price and the increase would be of 0:68% for Lufhtansa, 0:61% for British Airways and 0:7% for Easyjet. Note that the traffic volume of Lufthansa, British Airways and Easyjet would decrease. However for Air France, besides the further rise in its price, the passenger traffic would increase due to competition. The parameters estimated from the passenger demand and airline pricing equations are presented in Table 3A . In the upper panel, we 2 Nevo (2000b) controls whether demand estimation is influenced by market definition. We explore the sensitivity of results to the market size measures by regressing the model with different market definitions and results are found to be robust.

All parameters have the expected sign. To begin with, the price coefficient, α, is positive hence the effect of price on passenger demand is always negative. In other words, any increase in ticket fare leads to a decrease in passenger demand. Moreover, α is assumed to vary across airline main location (See Equation (10).). By specifying the price coefficient as in Equation (10), we introduce origin country dependent effects of price on passenger demand. As expected, α 1 is estimated to be negative and significant. Thus, passengers flying by an airline located in a richer country are expected to be less sensitive to ticket fare. Regarding the network related variable (total kilometre flown), a carrier with larger network size is likely to have higher demand. Overall, the airline dummies are consistent with what is expected. We estimate the demand and pricing equations of airlines, and then we use estimated parameters to back out estimates of their marginal costs. We then change the solidarity tax levels and solve the model to obtain new equilibrium prices. The results are presented in the simulation results section.
