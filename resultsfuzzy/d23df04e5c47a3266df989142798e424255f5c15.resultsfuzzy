The airflow pattern of Case B (negative pressure) was found to be generally consistent with the smoke dispersion pattern as visualized through the smoke tests during the commissioning period. The results showed that the airflow systems performed reasonably well both before and after conversion from positive pressure to negative pressure. Figure 4 shows the simulation results of the differential patterns of room air temperature, i.e. the temperature rise above the supply air temperature at the diffuser outlet for Cases A and B. Figure 5 shows the distribution of infectious particles released from the bodies of staff at the operating level, i.e. 1.1 m from floor level. Figure 6 shows the concentration of bacteria released from the patient's wound site in the vertical plane, i.e. the situation across the incision site. In the negative pressure theatre, a deflector plate was added to prevent backflow of the air from OT-1 to the anteroom. Figure 7 compares the velocity profiles before and after the addition of this deflector plate. Dirty corridor þ10 þ3.0 À1.6
