In this section, we use three types of artificial time series, the two-exponent ARFIMA processes [58] , binomial multifractal model [56] and the NBVP time series [59] , to test the effectiveness of this new procedure and make comparison between two methods. The latter two have been proved the existence of cross-multifractality. In order to prove the applicability of the proposed W-MFSMXA method in real world data, we then apply this method to financial time series to analyze their cross-multifractality. Here, we perform two US stock indices: the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) and the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NAS). The original data were obtained from yahoo finance (http://finance.yahoo.com) from Jan. 2, 1997 to Dec. 29, 2014. To make sure of the synchronization of the time series, we exclude the asynchronous data and then reconnect the remaining parts of the original series. In so doing, the resulting length is 4526. The data we analyze in this paper are defined as the absolute logarithmic returns, this is, r t = |log(x t ) − log(x t−1 )|, where x t denote the closing price for a stock index on day t. The daily absolute returns for the two stock indices are shown in Fig. 6 . Profiles of two series are very similar to each other. Let x denotes DJI series and y denotes NAS throughout this section. Fig. 7a depicts the statistical moments function F xy (q, s) as a function of scale s in log-log plots for q from −3 to 3 with the step-length of 1 by W-MFSMXA and MFSMXA methods. Excellent power laws are also observed for both algorithms. Same as before, F (ω) xy (q, s) in W-MFSMXA is more similar to F xy (q + 1, s) in MFSMXA, which is conformed when plotting the scaling exponent function τ (q) versus the moment order q in Fig. 7b . The scaling exponent ratio a(q) is plotted in Fig. 7c and clearly approximates a hyperbola. The nonlinearity of τ (q) demonstrates the existence of but weak multifractality in the absolute logarithmic daily returns series. Besides, in Fig. 7d , τ xy (q) are practically consisitent with the averages of τ xx (q) and τ yy (q) while the scaling of covariances η(q) − 1 is obviously the lowest, indicating that the cross-multifractality in series is mainly dominated by the multifractality of separate series. To give a more systemic statistical test on these returns series, we adopt the following bootstrapping approach to get the possibility that the empirical multifractality could be spurious [38, 39] . We reshuffle each series 1000 times to remove any potential temporal correlation, then carry out the W-MFSMXA procedure for the surrogate data as for the original data. A very strict null hypothesis is imposed to investigate whether the singularity spectrum f(λ) is wider than those produced by chance. The null hypothesis is the following: The associated probability of false alarm for multifractality is defined by where n is the number of shufflings and #[ λ λ rnd ] counts the number of λ whose value is not greater than λ rnd . As n → ∞, it is clear that the estimated bootstrap p-value will tend to the ideal bootstrap p-value. Under the conventional significance level of 0.01, the multifractal phenomenon is statistically significant if and only if p ≤ 0.01. When p > 0.01, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Results of the statistical test are presented in Fig. 8 . A remarkable deviation of the singularity spectrum f(λ) of the original data from f rnd (λ rnd ) of the surrogate data is clear to see in Fig. 8b . Hence, we can infer that cross-multifractality in series is destroyed by the shuffling procedure as a consequence of the eliminated long memory in the separate returns series. Further, we find p = 0 using the significance level of 0.01, which is a significant evidence for the presence of cross-multifractality in the investigated DJI and NAS data. Comparing the scaling exponent ratio a(q) in Figs. 4a, 5 c and 7 c, it can be found the similar hyperbolic feature of a(q). Moreover, the statistical moments functions as well as the scaling exponents in W-MFSMXA are almost exactly the same as those in MFSMXA if taking no account of their phases or positions.
