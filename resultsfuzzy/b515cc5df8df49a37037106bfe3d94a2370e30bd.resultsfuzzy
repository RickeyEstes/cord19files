Total Phenolic and Flavonoid Contents of J. rigida Needles from Different Regions Among J. rigida derived from the 11 districts, the total phenolic and total flavonoid contents varied significantly ( Table 2) . Total phenolic compounds were the most abundant in Fengcheng (S11) with contents of 31.64 mmol equiv. GAE/100 g, and lowest in Dabaozhen (S6) with contents of 13.34 mmol equiv. GAE/100 g. Consistent with total phenolic content data, the highest and lowest total flavonoid contents were detected in S11 and S6 (84.53 mmol equiv. QUE/100 g, 39.05 mmol equiv. QUE/100 g, respectively). Overall, abundance of total phenolic and flavonoid contents of J. rigida was in the order: Fengcheng (S11), Changbai Mountain (S10), Yijun (S3), Fugu (S2), Chongli (S5), Xiaosuangou (S7), Jinhua (S9), Datong (S4), Wulahada (S8), Helan Mountain (S1), Dabaozhen (S6). Therefore, among the diverse J. rigida samples, those from Fengcheng and Changbai Mountain were of the highest quality due to their rich phenolic contents. Variations in the total phenolic and flavonoid contents in J. rigida needles were potentially due to differences in the levels, properties, and proportions of their active ingredients, which, in turn, may be attributed to distribution in diverse geological zones, leading to different therapeutic properties of the same species from various growth regions. 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 13 were identified as chlorogenic acid, catechin, cumaric acid, rutin, hyperoside, ellagic acid, podophyllotoxin, amentoflavone, formononetin, and galangal, respectively (Figure 2, G0) . Total contents of the identified compounds varied significantly among the regions (p < 0.05, Table 3 ), the highest recorded in S2 (746.65 mg/g) followed by S6 (694.02 mg/g) and S3 (666.40 mg/g), and the lowest in S11 (415.27 mg/g) and S8 (411.74 mg/g). In all 11 J. rigida samples, chlorogenic acid, catechin, podophyllotoxin, and amentoflavone were the most abundant phenolic compounds. The contents of these four compounds varied from 53.32 ± 0.17 to 163.38 ± 0.17 mg/g DW, 112.52 ± 0.08 to 288.88 ± 0.38 mg/g DW, 71.11 ± 0.06 to 189.18 ± 0.04 mg/g DW and 57.68 ± 0.01 to 146.16 ± 0.05 mg/g DW, respectively. Ellagic acid and formononetin were the least abundant phenolic compounds, with contents ranging from 2.82 ± 0.02 to 3.01 ± 0.06 mg/g DW and 2.22 ± 0.01 to 5.68 ± 0.02 mg/g DW, respectively. Chlorogenic acid, catechin, podophyllotoxin, and amentoflavone are well-known human health antioxidants (Harwood et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2013) . Previous studies have shown that these active components are abundant in J. rigida and have significant potential for application as natural antioxidants in the food and drug industries. Since the contents of phenolic compounds in J. rigida needles from different geographical sources vary considerably, a standard protocol for effective quality evaluation of J. rigida appears essential.
