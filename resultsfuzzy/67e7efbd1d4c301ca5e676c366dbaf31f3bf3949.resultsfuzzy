OP swabs were obtained at routine clinic visits and during exacerbation visits. Methicillin sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and Haemophilus influenzae were the most common pathogens identified on OP cultures. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified in four subjects and none were chronically infected. One subject was hospitalized due to a pulmonary exacerbation at the time of the new Pseudomonas infection and received 2 weeks of IV antibiotics followed by 1 month of inhaled tobramycin. This subject was hospitalized a total of 3 times during the study. The remaining subjects were treated with 4 weeks of inhaled tobramycin for Pseudomonas eradication and one of these three subjects also received 2 weeks of oral ciprofloxacin. None of the subjects treated for Pseudomonas on an outpatient basis were hospitalized during the two-year study period. The proportion of positive H. influenzae cultures was modestly associated with lower PEx Fig. 1 Relationship between chest radiograph score at enrollment and study completion and number of exacerbations: A loess curve (solid line) was used to display the association and is plotted with a 95% confidence interval (shaded band). Chest radiograph scores at enrollment and study completion were associated with the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations, indicating that those with better chest radiograph scores had fewer exacerbations.
