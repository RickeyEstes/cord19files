Indices to evaluate ZCURVE_V The ZCURVE_V system has been run for 979 viral and 212 phage genome records, respectively. The default settings are adopted for all the options unless indicated otherwise. Evaluation of ZCURVE_V is based on the comparison between the gene-finding results and the RefSeq annotations for each genome. It should be noted that the RefSeq records are usually listed as provisional and have not themselves undergone extensive curation and literature cross-checking. However, to test and compare the performance of the presented algorithm we do need some criteria. Knowing that the RefSeq records are questionable, we chose to select those RefSeq data which possess the maximum reliability. For example, gene annotations in HIV, HBV and coronavirus are well known in the literature. Therefore, these three viruses are selected as samples to test and compare the algorithm. Other RefSeq records are selected similarly. Due to the inaccuracy of the RefSeq annotations currently available, the comparison between the performance of GeneMark and ZCURVE_V based on the RefSeq annotations should be deemed as preliminary. Future and more reliable comparison should be based on experimentally verified data, rather than RefSeq annotations. Two independent indices defined by formulas (1) and (2) are used to evaluate the performance of ZCURVE_V [13] where TP, FP and FN are the positively true, false positive and false negative predictions, respectively.
