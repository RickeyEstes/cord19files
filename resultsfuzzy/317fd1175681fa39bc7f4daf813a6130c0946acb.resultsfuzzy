Respiratory pathogenic viruses were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in about 50% of the swabs (Table 4) , and the most frequently recorded ones were human coronaviruses 229E/NL63 (8/38 swabs, $21%) and OC43 (5/ 38 swabs, $13%). Co-infections were detected in two specimens. Influenza viruses were not detected. There were no differences in the proportion of positive (for any viruses) and negative swabs in terms of participant sex, age, and level of education. Also, there were no differences in the time elapsed between the onset of symptoms and self-swabbing (Figure 2A) or the time between selfswabbing and arrival of the swab at the study center ( Figure 2B ). Likewise, we did not detect any effects on viral detection when we controlled for potential effects of each variable (time (change per one day) between symptoms and swabbing, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50-1.93; time between swabbing and delivery, AOR 0.96, 95% CI 0.76-1.21).
