The OSP received 96 submissions for Phase I of the competition, with entries coming from 45 countries spanning 6 continents (Fig 1) . Phase I applications were judged on the following criteria: advancement of open science, impact, innovation, originality, technology viability, and resource feasibility. Based on these criteria, 6 finalists were selected to progress to Phase II of the competition, in which they were provided funds to develop prototypes. The teams were invited to provide live demonstrations of their prototypes at a public Open Data Science Symposium organized by NIH. The teams were asked to develop written narratives summarizing progress to date and addressing key factors such as innovation, utility, feasibility and technical merit, and development and sustainability plan for their prototypes. These summaries, along with videos that many of the teams created, were publicly displayed on the OSP website, and the public was invited to cast their votes and provide input. During Phase II, 3,730 votes were received from voters representing 76 countries. The judging criteria for Phase II was similar to the criteria utilized for Phase I, but in Phase II, the emphasis was on the prototype developed as opposed to an anticipatory idea. Based on the review of all information provided, the funders selected "Real-Time Evolutionary Tracking for Pathogen Surveillance and Epidemiological Investigation" as the grand prize winner of the OSP. "Real-Time Evolutionary Tracking for Pathogen Surveillance and Epidemiological Investigation" was developed by a team from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Washington and the University of Basel, Switzerland. The project uses an online visualization platform (http://www.nextstrain.org) in which the outputs of statistical Quality Data Hub for the World," providing real-time information on poor air quality by combining data from across the globe, (b) "OpenTrialsFDA: Making Unbiased Clinical Trial Data Accessible," enabling better access to drug-approval packages submitted to and made available by the Food and Drug Administration, (c) "Open Neuroimaging Laboratory," advancing brain research by enabling collaborative annotation, discovery, and analysis of brain-imaging data, d) "Fruit Fly Brain Observatory," allowing researchers to better conduct modeling of mental and neurological diseases by connecting data related to the fly brain, (e) "MyGene2: Accelerating Gene Discovery via Radically Open Data Sharing," facilitating the public sharing of health and genetic data through integration with publicly available information, and (f) "Real-Time Evolutionary Tracking for Pathogen Surveillance and Epidemiological Investigation," permitting real-time analysis of emerging epidemics, such as Ebola, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Conavirus, and Zika. analyses of viral genome sequences can be used by public health officials for epidemiological insights within days of genome sequences having been obtained from viral pathogen samples taken from patients. Nextstrain.org expanded upon the submitters' prior work on influenza tracking (nextflu.org) to include many other viral pathogens. Using OSP funds, the team developed detailed phylogeographic analyses of viral movement, created a platform for rapid (realtime) data sharing of pathogen genome data with open source code, and constructed a database and associated parsing scripts to quickly consolidate emerging data from multiple sources.
