Profiling of differentially expressed host genes in vaccine ILTV infection Primary chicken embryo lung cells at passage 1 were infected with 3 vaccination doses of a live fowl laryngotracheitis vaccine, which is widely used in the poultry industry. The infected cells were subjected to analysis for cytopathic effects and virus infection validation at 1, 2, 3 and 4 days post infection (dpi). Although weak cytopathic effects (e.g. cell rounding, aggregation and syncytia) were observed at certain locations of plates at 1 and 2 dpi, infected cells began to recover by 3 dpi, and no cytopathic effects were observed at 4 dpi ( Figure  1A ). To verify the infection of vaccine ILTV, the expression of ILTV viral RNA was determined and genes of UL35 encoding a small capsid protein and US5 encoding an envelop glycoprotein J (gJ) were shown to progressively increase their expression post infection though US5 expression began to be detected from 2 dpi ( Figure 1B ). In the 44 K microarray assay, two approaches to avoid possible hidden dye effects were used: the use of RNA Spike-in controls synthesized from the Adenovirus E1A transcriptomes containing different concentrations of dye in each set [33] and the dye-swap in two of four total replicates. No significant dye effects were detected in all microarray slides (data not shown). Data analysis using one-way ANOVA with the JMP Genomics 5.0 and a 2 fold or greater cut off value revealed that 933 genes were differentially expressed at 4 different dpi time points following vaccine ILTV infection (Additional file 1). When these 933 differentially expressed genes were subjected to the bioinformatics study using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA, Ingenuity Â® Systems, http:// www.ingenuity.com) to generate the gene networks and functional annotations, 213 genes were recognized as mapped IDs (functionally known genes) by the IPA program (Additional file 2) and subjected to further bioinformatics analysis.
