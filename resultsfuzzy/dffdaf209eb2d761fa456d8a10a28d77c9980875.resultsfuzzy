First before aerosol loading, the multilayer PVDF nanofiber electret filter was compared to two conventional microfiber electrets filters made of polypropylene with all filters having the same range of pressure drop from 23 to 26 Pa and being challenged by sodium chloride aerosols with a face velocity of 5.3 cm s −1 . The efficiency and quality factor are compared between these filters in Appendix A. As shown in Figs. A1 and A2, both efficiency and quality factor at clean state for the PVDF nanofiber electret filter are much higher than those of the two conventional microfiber electret filters. For example, for the 300-nm aerosols, the efficiency of the multilayer was 87.5% on average while the multilayer electret nanofiber filter achieved 98.3% which is a 12% increase. The quality factor of the two conventional microfiber electret filters made of polypropylene achieved a quality factor of 0.085 Pa −1 on average, while the multilayer electret nanofiber filter achieved 0.155 Pa −1 which is a whopping 82% increase over the conventional microfiber electret filters. To investigate the differences in loading behaviors between uncharged and charged filters, and 1-layer and multilayer filters, filters with same average fiber diameter of 525 nm and same total basis weight of 3.060 gsm were used, including uncharged and charged 1layer filters, and uncharged and charged 4-layer filters. Filters of 4-layer were used in this research because they were expected to have distinctly different behavior as compared to that of the 1-layer filters. The SEM images of S-3.060 and a typical layer of M4-0.765 are shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b , respectively. It is clearly shown that the fibers in S-3.060 are much more densely packed than that in a single layer of M4-0.765.
