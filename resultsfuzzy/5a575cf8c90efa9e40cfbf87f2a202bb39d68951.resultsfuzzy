Firstly, all samples were tested with the four broad range multiplex kits (Fig 1) . In addition, they were systematically tested for Inf A and Inf B using in-house standard real-time RT-PCR assays [21] , and for Core tests (Inf A, Inf B, hRSV, hMPV, EV + hRV, AdV and hBoV) using the Argene (Respiratory Multi Well System r-gene) low range kit, consisting of 4 Taqmanbased duplex PCR or RT-PCR reactions (Inf A+B, hRSV+hMPV, hRV&EV+cellular control, AdV+hBoV). Samples testing negative for a given pathogen with all detection methods were proposed negative for this pathogen. Samples testing positive for a pathogen with at least 2 different techniques were proposed positive. Samples with discrepant results (positive for one pathogen with only one detection method) were further processed with "confirmation" assays, consisting of one or several real-time or nested amplification protocols (Table A in S1 File) and subsequently declared positive or negative according to the result obtained. Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), Sensitivity, Specificity and agreement (as evaluated by the Youden's index) values were calculated for the Core tests of the kits tested (see below). Secondly, all samples were analysed according to the results obtained by the four broad range multiplex kits for Extra tests (S1 Fig Only results relating to viral pathogens were analysed in depth since a majority of bacterial pathogens were detected only by the FTD-RP33 test. A decision tree similar to that used for Core tests was designed and confirmation techniques were used to confirm or invalidate discrepant results (Table B in S1 File). PPV, Sensitivity, NPV, and Specificity values were calculated for Extra tests (see below).
