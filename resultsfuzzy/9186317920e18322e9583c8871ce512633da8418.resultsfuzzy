The indirect ELISA that we developed was used to evaluate the presence of PEDV antibodies in 382 serum samples from sows with varying immune status. These serum samples were also subjected to SN assays. The level of agreement between the SN and ELISA assay was determined using a Cohen's kappa, and a McNemar's test was performed to investigate the differences between both assays. A P-value < 0.05 was considered significant. All analyses were performed in SPSS version 22.0. Of the 382 serum samples collected from animals with a known immunization history across eight pig farms, 281 (73.6%) were positive for PEDV antibodies according to our ELISA, while 101 (26.4%) were PEDV antibody-negative. In comparison, according to the SN assay we used in parallel with the indirect ELISA, 73% (279/382) of samples were PEDV antibody-positive and 27.0% (103/382) of samples were antibody-negative (Table 3) . According to both assays, 276 and 98 of the screened serum samples were PEDV antibody-positive and -negative, respectively. Three of the serum samples that were positive according to the SN assay, were
