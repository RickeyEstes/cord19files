The sensitivity for VZV, HSV1 and HSV2 was bewteen 1 and 10 copies, while that of CMV was 10 -100 copies. The sensitivity of the CMV system was increased by carrying out an initial 10 cycles of PCR using outer primers and then adding to the real-time PCR. 34 VZV, 34 HSVI, 32 HSV2 and 10 CMV positive results were obtained (one HSV2 was not detected by culture). All spiked CSF samples were detected, whether extracted or not. Turn-around time was less than 2 hours compared with a mean of 4.4 days for culture? immunofluorescence. Conclusions: Real-time PCR is a cost effective, sensitive and rapid means of detecting these viruses, with no need for extraction of most samples. This system will therefore be of benefit in screening immunocompromised patients.
