The 9 selected samples passed the quality control test .A total of 2085 differentially expressed miRNAs were detected in the 9 samples. Among the detected miRNAs, 433 miRNAs showed more than 1.5-fold differential expression in the T1 group compared to the W1 group (247 miRNAs were up-regulated and 186 miRNA were downregulated); 344 miRNAs were differentially expressed by more than two-fold in the T2 group compared to the W2 group (225 miRNAs were up-regulated and 119 miRNAs were down-regulated); 107 miRNAs showed differential expression by more than two-fold in the T3 group compared to the W3 group (51 miRNAs were up-regulated and 56 miRNAs were down-regulated) ( Figure 1 ). Combining the data from all three patients, 10 miRNA were differentially expressed by more than twofold in the collapse area (T1+T2+T3) compared to the non-collapse area (W1+W2+W3) (8 miRNAs were upregulated: hsa-miR-4472, hsa-miR-4306. hsa-miR-4747-5p, hsa-miR-4441, hsa-miR-4709-3p, ebv-miR-BHRF1-2-3p, hsa-miR-585-3p, and hsa-miR-5572, while 2 miRNAs  were down-regulated: hsa-miR-195-5p and hsa-miR-645) . Compared to the normal region, has-miR-195-5p showed the most significant down-regulation (Tables 1-3) . The following U6 primers were used for RT-PCR:F: 5′GCTTCGGCAGCACATAT ACTAAAAT3′, R: 5′CGCTTCACGAATTTGCGTGT CAT3′.The primer sequences of hsa-miR-195-5p were: GSP: 5′GGGGTAGCAGCACAGAAAT3′, R: 5′CAGTGCGTGTCGTGGAGT3′(GSP is a specific primer for miRNA, while R is a primer that matches the RT primer). The RT-PCR expression level of hsa-miR-195-5p was significantly lower in the collapse area (T1 T2 T3)than in the non-collapse area (W1 W2 W3) and normal area (Z1 Z2 Z3) . (Table 4 ) Comparison of the results from RT-PCR and the microarray data also indicated that hsa-miR-195-5p expression was downregulated.Amplification and melting curves were obtained ( Figure 2 ).
