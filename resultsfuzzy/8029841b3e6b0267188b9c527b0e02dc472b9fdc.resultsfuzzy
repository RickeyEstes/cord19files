We have run a 40 cycle PCR using the master mix manufacturer's specifications. A typical fluorescence profile was obtained (see Fig. 2A ). In Fig. 2B we show the single cycle number 23 to demonstrate the extracted data for the MCA. This procedure was applied to a sample containing only a single amplicon (HA) with melting temperature of 76 °C (see Fig. 3A,B) . We have then added to the sample a second amplicon (NA) with a melting temperature of 68 °C. A second peak corresponding to this amplicon can be observed in the respective MCA (Fig. 3C,D) . Increasing the amount of NA added compared to HA lead to an even faster increase of the magnitude of peak at 68 °C (Fig. 3E,F) . Extracting the fluorescence amplitude from the derived curves for each cycle at 68 °C and 76 °C respectively, results in two PCR amplification curves. Figure 4A shows the two amplification curves extracted for the experiments with a higher concentration of NA than HA (experiments A1 to A5 in Table 2 ). The sample spiked with the cDNA of the HA gene yielded only a single amplification curve with melting temperature of 76 °C, which was expected. For all other experiments we were able to extract two amplification curves, one at a temperature of 68 °C and the second one at temperature of 76 °C. Threshold cycles (C T ) were defined in the usual way. It was found that the difference in C T (∆C T ) of the two curves corresponded to the expected difference according to the ratio of concentrations of HA and NA. An overview of all conducted experiments is presented in Table 1 . The results indicate that ∆C T corresponds to the expected values. We can then conclude that the method can be used for multiplexed quantitative PCR. As an example, (see Table 1 ) sample A5 has the concentration of NA 19 times higher than the concentration of HA. With 100% PCR efficiency one would expect a ∆C T of 4.25 (log 2 19) . We have found the ∆C T value to be 4.0 ± 0.4 which is efficiency of 84%, reasonably close to the ideal value. We have observed MCA peak broadening in our experiment due to applied conditions. It is necessary to run several replicates of the same experiment to suppress random errors and improve the result precision. The MCAs are recorded at a scanning rate of over 20 °C/s while the commercial systems for high resolution melting curve analysis (HRMCA) 17 are usually operating with low temperature scan rates between 0.1 °C/s and 0.5 °C/s. Differentiation of amplicons with melting point differences ΔT m as small as 1.2 °C have been demonstrated in HRMCA. However the method presented in this contribution requires greater ΔT m due to peak broadening caused by the high heating rate. We assume that a difference in amplicons melting temperatures' of at least 5 °C would be sufficient to differentiate them from each other. This could be achieved by primer design since the melting temperature is a function of amplicon length and ratio of CG/AT content. Therefore an extension temperature of 60 °C and a denaturation temperature of 95 °C would allow for 6 different amplicons to be detected in the same droplet, assuming a ΔT m of 5 °C. Furthermore, the temperature measured by the sensor in HRMCA corresponds practically to the sample temperature due to the slow scanning rate. In our approach the sample temperature lags behind the temperature measured by the sensor underneath the sample 18 . This can be seen from the comparative end point HRMCA done with the LightCycler, Fig. 4B shows the fluorescence amplitude plotted as function of temperature with a temperature gradient of 0.1 °C/s. In Fig. 4C the first negative derivative of this curve with respect to temperature is shown, displaying two distinct peaks. Both melting temperatures found on the LightCycler are 8 °C higher than the temperatures we measured in our system. Nevertheless this T m offset has no influence on quality of the results especially when this lag is known and the resulting temperature offset is calibrated. Ideally the test should be performed with a clinical sample containing H7N9 virus starting with sample preparation followed with reverse transcription. VRC-based RT-PCR demonstrating almost all those steps was shown earlier, detecting both RNA from H5N1 avian influenza virus 19 as well as from virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 20 . Processing clinical sample containing virus of avian influenza or SARS would also require laboratory classified as biosafety hazard level 3 which we do not have available. In previous work we developed the system based on spiking blood sample with RNA, here in this work we spiked PCR master mix with two types of cDNA.
