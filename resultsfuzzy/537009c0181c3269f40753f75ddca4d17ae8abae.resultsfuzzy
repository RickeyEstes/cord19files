Taking the national data as an example, starting from February 11 and backtracking, in Equation (2), j = 1, 2, 3, ..., 15 was calculated, and the CR was calculated daily. When j = 10, the value of CR was the most stable among the days, and the coefficient of variation was the smallest. According to the published data, in addition to calculating the national CR, the same calculations were performed according to the division data of Wuhan, Hubei, Hubei except Wuhan, and the country except Hubei (Fig.1) . The coefficient of variation of the estimated cure rate of wuhan, national, Hubei except Wuhan, Hubei and country except Hubei reached the minimum value at j =8,10,10,10,12, respectively, indicating that this is the smallest difference in the estimated value of each day.
