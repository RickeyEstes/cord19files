Cloning and phylogeny of VP6 gene of PRV PRV may cause piglet diarrhea andV P6 is an important structural component of viral particles. In this study, we cloned the VP6 gene from a Chinese PRV isolate DN30209. The sequencing results showed that the cloned VP6 gene was 1356 bp containing a complete open reading frame (ORF) encoding 397 amino acids. The sequence has been submitted to GenBank and was allocated a GenBank accession number (JN977137). Compared with PRV JL94, there were three mutations at N 94 H, G 126 R and I 182 V; compared with PRV GD, three mutations N 94 H, I 182 V and T 244 A were identified. As DN30209, JL94 and GD all were isolated from northern China, these viruses may be geographical prevalent in northern areas in China. Based on the randomly selected PRV reference strains, the VP6 amino acid sequences were compared. As shown in Figure 1 , PRVs DN30209 and several PRV group A strains OSU, JL94 GD, CRW-8, 4F and 4S etc. had more than 90% homologous identity at amino acid level. RNA-PAGE analysis showed that the rotavirus represented long electropherotype migration pattern of porcine group A rotaviruses ( Figure 2 ). Further phylogenetic tree analysis also indicated that PRV DN30203 located in the same clade with above-mentioned PRV group A strains ( Figure 3 ). Therefore, we speculate that PRV DN30209 also belongs to group A of rotavirus. Nevertheless, it is necessary to do more serological and epidemiological investigations to get full understanding on the evolution of PRV in the future.
