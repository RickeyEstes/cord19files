Of 595 samples positive for HRV/EntV by the FilmArray respiratory panel, HRV LD-PCR confirmed HRV in 474 samples (80%), representing 438 patients. EntV was detected in 13 samples (2%) (Fig. 1) . Five samples were excluded from analysis because they were collected within two weeks of a prior sample and considered a repeat sample from a single illness episode. Altogether, 432 (92%) of 469 HRV-positive samples were collected in the ED and 274 (62%) patients were male. Samples HRV/EntV-positive by FilmArray only were more likely to be coinfected with other respiratory viruses compared to samples HRV-confirmed by LD-PCR (unconfirmed vs. confirmed; 22% vs. 14%; P = 0.03). HMPV was more likely to be found in samples positive by FilmArray only (9% vs. 4%, P = 0.03). Samples HRV/EntVpositive by FilmArray only were collected from patients with a higher median age at time of first illness compared to samples HRVconfirmed (16 vs. 12 months [range 0-36 months]). There were no differences in collection season or patient gender between the HRV-confirmed and unconfirmed samples.
