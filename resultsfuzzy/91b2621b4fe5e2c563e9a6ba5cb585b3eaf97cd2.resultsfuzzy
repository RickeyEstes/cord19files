In this section, we perform a simulation study to demonstrate the accuracy of LADE in heavy-tailed case and apply the theory in Sections 2 and 3 to the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index (HSI) series. Firstly, we compare numerically LADE and QMLE for the PTTGARCH(1,1) model. The data are generated by the PTTGARCH(1,1) model , with the true parameter ðd 0 ; a 0 0 ; a 0 11 ; a 0 21 ; b 0 1 Þ 0 ¼ ð0:8; 0:2; 0:2; 0:1; 0:4Þ 0 . We take the errors t to have either a standard normal distribution or a standardized Student's t-distribution with degrees of freedom d ¼ 2, 3, 4, 5. The sample size is n ¼ 600 and we draw 1000 independent samples. For LADE, u was set to be u ¼ 10. Fig. 1 presents the boxplots of the average absolute error (AAE) ðjd À 0:8j þ jâ 0 À 0:2j þ jâ 11 À 0:2j þ jâ 21 À 0:1j þ jb 1 À 0:4jÞ=5 for both LADE and QMLE. For samples with heavy-tailed errors, i.e., tð2Þ, tð3Þ and tð4Þ, LADE performs better than QMLE especially for tð2Þ and tð3Þ. As expected, QMLE is better when the errors are tð5Þ and Nð0; 1Þ. Then we apply the PTTGARCH model to daily HSI from 2001 to 2003, which has a total of 738 observations. The return series X t is defined as the percentage of the log difference of the index. Figs. 2 and 3 are the time plots of the index and the return, respectively. They display some drastic shocks, which are caused by the 11/9 terrorist attack on 11-09-2001 and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China erupted in March 2003. We first study whether or not fX t g is heavy-tailed. The Hill estimator and the QQ-plot are used for this. The Hill estimator is defined as where X ð1Þ XX ð2Þ X Á Á Á XX ðnÞ are the order statistics of X 1 ; . . . ; X n . We plot fðm; H n;m Þ; 1pmp600g in Fig. 4 , which suggests that X t has an infinite fourth moment or even probably infinite variance, since the estimator is less than 4 for mX20 and less than 2 for mX200. Fig. 5 presents the QQ-plot for fX t g, which suggests that fX t g is very heavy-tailed. To test whether fX t g is white noise, we use the Wald test statistics based on the weighted least absolute estimators with the weight function ( where a t ¼ P p i¼1 jX tÀi jIðjX tÀi jXCÞ and C is the 90 percent quantile of the data fX t g (see Ling, 2005 for details), since the Box-Pierce statistic is not applicable for the heavy-tailed case. Here and in the following we take the kernel function KðxÞ ¼ e Àx =ð1 þ e Àx Þ 2 and b n ¼ 1:06n À1=5 (Silverman, 1986, p. 40) . We obtain that W n ð8Þ ¼ 2:31 and W n ð12Þ ¼ 2:76. Both are not significant at 0.05 level. However, for the squared series fX 2 t g, we obtain that W 2 n ð8Þ ¼ 105:85 and W 2 n ð12Þ ¼ 108:55, which are highly significant at the level 0.05. This suggests that the series fX t g has conditional heteroscedastic structure. For the standardized residuals, we obtain W n ð8Þ ¼ 4:88 and W n ð12Þ ¼ 7:28; for the squared standardized residuals, we obtained W 2 n ð8Þ ¼ 15:21 and W 2 n ð12Þ ¼ 17:64. Based on the 5% significance level of the w 2 ð8Þ and w 2 ð12Þ distribution, the PTTGARCH(1,1) model fits the data adequately according to both statistics W 2 n ð8Þ, W 2 n ð12Þ, W 2 n ð8Þ, and W 2 n ð12Þ. Fig. 6 shows the Hill estimator of the standardized residuals, which indicates that the residuals may have infinite fourth moment since the Hill estimator is less than 3:5 when mX80. The QQ-plot in Fig. 7 also shows that the residuals are heavy-tailed. Thus, we fit a PTTGARCH model to the data with LADE.
