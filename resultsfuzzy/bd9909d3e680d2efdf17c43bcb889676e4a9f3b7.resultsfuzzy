In this section, we perform numerical simulations with the help of parameter values taken from data of field works and experimental data (see, Table 1 ) which remains fixed for all numerical simulations. In our numerical simulations we have varied the infection rate c, quality of alternative food a and quantity of alternative food n. The bifurcation diagram of the system (2) with respect to infection rate of prey in the range 0 6 c 6 1:34 in absence of alternative food (i.e., a ¼ 0; n ¼ 0) to predator is presented in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 shows that within 0 6 c 6 0:76, there is no infected prey species in the system and the susceptible prey and predator species have periodic behaviour. But, for 0:76 < c 6 1:21, the susceptible prey, infected prey and predator species have limit cycle oscillations. All prey and predator species settle down to their respective steady states after c > 1:21. Notice that the average density of the infected prey species becomes higher than the average density of susceptible prey for c > 0:76. With the increase of infection rate susceptible prey becomes infected at higher rate and as a result the density of susceptible prey population decreases and the density of infected prey population increases. The bifurcation diagram of the system (2) with respect to infection rate c in the range 0 6 c 6 1:74 in presence of alternative food (a ¼ 0:85; n ¼ 0:3) to predator is plotted in the Fig. 2 . It is evident from Fig. 2 that the system becomes disease free within 0 6 c 6 0:9 in presence of alternative food. Therefore, supply of alternative food to predator makes the system disease free in 0:76 6 c 6 0:9 which is impossible in absence of alternative food. The infected prey population oscillates within 0:9 < c < 1:6 and it reaches steady state after c > 1:6. The susceptible prey and predator species have periodic behaviour for 0 6 c 6 1:6 and finally they settle down to their respective steady state after c > 1:6. We plot dynamical behaviours of the infected prey population in absence of alternative food as well as in presence of alternative food in Fig. 3 . Time evolution of infected prey is plotted in Fig. 3(a) in absence of alternative food taking c ¼ 0:8, on the other hand Fig. 3(b) represents time evolution of the infected prey species for same infection rate in presence of alternative food (a ¼ 0:85; n ¼ 0:6). Fig. 3 (c) depicts the time evolution of infected prey without alternative food with infection rate c ¼ 1 whereas Fig. 3(d) represents the disease free dynamics for ða ¼ 0:85; n ¼ 0:7Þ with same infection rate.

[39, 40] 0.08 e Predator mortality rate 0.04-0.16 [39, 40] 0.04 From the Fig. 3 , it is clear that the system becomes disease free under suitable supply of alternative food even if the infection rate is high which is impossible in absence of alternative food. In Fig. 4 , the an plane is divided into infected and uninfected regions for fixed infection rate c. We have determined the regions for c ¼ 0:8 ( Fig. 4(a) ) and for c ¼ 1 (Fig. 4(b) ) considering other parameters values are as in Table 1 . Fig. 4(a) is plotted in the an parametric plane for 0 6 a 6 2:5 and 0 6 n 6 6:3 with constant infection rate c ¼ 0:8, whereas Fig. 4(b) divides the an plane into infected and uninfected regions for 0 6 a 6 2:5 and 0 6 n 6 7:7 with constant infection rate c ¼ 1. We observe from Fig. 4 that it is impossible to make the system disease free in absence of alternative food for higher infection rate c (> 0:76) but disease free system can be achieved by suitable supply of alternative food. It is obvious that disease free solution exists for high quality of alternative food even if it is supplied in small quantity. On the other hand if alternative food is of low quality then high quantity of alternative food may not efficient to make the system disease free. Therefore high quality of alternative food supply is very efficient for disease control. The cn and ca-planes are divided into infected and uninfected regions which are presented in Fig. 5(a) for a ¼ 0:85 and in Fig. 5(b) for n ¼ 0:62, respectively. Fig. 5(a) is the parametric plane cn for 0 6 c 6 2:5 and 0 6 n 6 1 fixing a ¼ 0:85. The Fig. 5 (a) shows that the system becomes disease free for small quantity of alternative food for lower infection rate c(< 0:5). But for higher infection rate, the supply level n increases depending on the increase of infection rate. There exists a critical infection rate above which alternative food may not be useful to make the system disease free. It is clear from Fig. 5 (b) that disease free state can be reached for higher infection rate (c > 0:76) supplying high quality of alternative food. It is evident from Fig. 5(b) that for lower infection rate quality of alternative is not so important for obtaining disease free system.
