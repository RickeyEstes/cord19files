A total of 626 bats, belonging to ten species of seven genera, were collected in the present study ( Table 2) (Table 2) . Only three species, including Plecotus auritus in Jilin, M. chinensis in Liaoning, and Hipposideros armiger in Guangdong, were detected negative, probably due to the small number of samples, or the low prevalence. The results of the present study demonstrated that T. gondii infection in bats was widely distributed in Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangxi and Guangdong provinces, with prevalence ranging from 3.7% to 7.3%. Other surveys have shown an overall prevalence of 6.7% in bats in Yunnan, and 20.3% in Guangxi by a nested PCR [18] , and a seroprevalence of 18.4% in five bat species in Anhui, Hubei, Guangdong, and Guangxi by MAT [17] . In other countries, the prevalence of T. gondii infection was found in 10.4% British bats using a SAG1-PCR [12] , and in 29.3% bats in Myanmar by a nested B1-PCR [13] . The difference may be related to bats species, study regions, and the detection methods. The present study revealed that T. gondii prevalence was higher in bats in southern China (Guangdong, and Jiangxi) than in northern China (Jilin, and Liaoning).

The 38 T. gondii-positive bat samples were directly genotyped, and only 8 positive DNA samples were completely genotyped, possibly due to low DNA concentration. Of which, 3 samples (2 from C. sphinx, and 1 from M. leucogaster) represented ToxoDB Genotype #10, and 5 samples (2 from M. leucogaster, 2 from M. chinensis, and 1 from R. ferrumequinum) belonged to ToxoDB Genotype #9 (Table 1) . Two genotypes, namely ToxoDB#10 and ToxoDB#9, were found in bats in this study, which was consistent with a previous study [18] , showing a limited diversity of T. gondii genotypes in bats in China. Unfortunately, T. gondii genotype in bats was not successfully identified in Liaoning, probably due to the small size of sampled bats and low intensity of infection. Recent studies have demonstrated that bats may share the same T. gondii genotypes as in wild and domestic animals, and humans. Although several genotypes of T. gondii have been described in China, there are two main genotypes, including types I (ToxoDB#10) and an atypical genotype ToxoDB#9. In particular, genotype #9 has been reported in Microtus fortis in Jilin province [22] , pigs in Jiangxi and Yunnan provinces [20, 23] , cats in Beijing, Yunnan and Guangdong provinces [24] [25] [26] , bats in Yunnan and Guangxi provinces [18] , and humans [27, 28] , suggesting that the genotype ToxoDB#9 is the most common lineage in mainland China. It is not only present in China, but also in Vietnam and Sri Lanka, which indicated a widespread distribution in Eastern Asia [29] . ToxoDB#10 is also common in China, found in Plateau pikas and Qinghai voles in Qinghai [19] , M. fortis in Jilin [22] , tree sparrows in Fujian [30] , pigs in Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangsu [27, 31] , sheep in Qinghai [27] , and human in Shanghai [27] . These results have shown a wide distribution of the two genotypes identified from bats in China.
