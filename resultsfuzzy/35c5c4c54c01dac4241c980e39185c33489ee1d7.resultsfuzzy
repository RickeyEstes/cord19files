2.1. Exploring the azaspiro dihydrotriazine core towards host DHFR-directed antiviral molecules In our previous series of cycloguanil-like dihydrotriazine derivatives, the N (1) of dihydrotriazine was directly link to a phenyl ring, variously substituted with electron-withdrawing or electrondonating groups, whilst the two methyl groups at C (2) (corresponding to the new spirane C (6), see Experimental section) of cycloguanil (1a) were sometimes replaced with smaller or bulkier alkyl groups. To further investigate the SAR of this class of compounds (1a-16a, Fig. 1 ), two novel azaspiro-2,4-diamino-1,6-dihydrotriazine scaffolds (Figs. 1e3) were explored. They were obtained by exploiting in a synthetic step the 4-piperidone (for 1e21) or 3piperidone (for 22, 23), as versatile building blocks, which allowed, via their nitrogen atom, the introduction of an additional reactive center for molecular diversification. The new twenty-three derivatives were functionalized at the N (1) position of the dihydrotriazine core with an aromatic ring (1e11, Fig. 2 ; 22 and 23, Fig. 1 ) or an aliphatic chain (propyl in 12e15 or methoxyethyl in 16e21, Fig. 3 ). The dihydrotriazine spirane C (6) was included into a piperidine nucleus, whose nitrogen atom in para position was further decorated with largely different substituted chains by reaction with acyl chlorides, sulfonyl chlorides, isocyanates and carboxylic acids to deliver amide and ureido functionalities. When the nitrogen atom of azaspiro moiety was in meta position only benzyl substituent was explored. In the previous series of cycloguanil-like dihydrotriazine derivatives, bulky cycloalkyl groups at C (6) position of the dihydrotriazine ring were not well tolerated in terms of inhibitory activity towards hDHFR, yielding less effective antiviral compounds. In the novel derivatives, the piperidine nucleus created an opportunity to form new additional interactions, enabling us to probe the steric and electronic tolerance of the side chain at the hDHFR active site.
