Among the 916 patient samples obtained from the sentinel surveillance, at least one viral organism was detected by viral isolation and/or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 143 (15.6%) subjects ( Table 2 ). Only one participant with a co-infection was observed. Influenza viruses were the most frequently detected organisms in this passive surveillance, consisting of 67.4% (97/144) of all the viruses detected by viral isolation and/or RT-PCR. Of the 916 samples collected, 78 (8.5%) were positive for influenza A viruses and 19 (2.1%) for influenza B viruses by viral isolation and/or RT-PCR. In addition, noninfluenza viruses were detected only by virus isolation; they were: adenovirus (1.6%), parainfluenza virus (1.4%), RSV (1.2%), and other viruses (0.8% ), which included HBoV (0.1%), enterovirus (0.2%), hMPV (0.1%), rhinovirus (0.1%), and herpes simplex virus (HSV, 0.2%). The only co-infection was observed in a 22 month old toddler in whom adenovirus and HSV were isolated. The virus etiology and detection rates varied with age ( Table 2 ). The most commonly detected viral pathogens in the 0-4 year old group were influenza A (11.1%) and adenoviruses (5.6%). Influenza A and B were the most commonly detected viruses in the school-age group (5-14 year old: 6.8% and 4.0%, respectively) and the late adolescent and young adult group (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) year-old: 9.7% and 1.7%, respectively). Influenza A was the only detectable virus among patients who were 60 years or older. Of the 78 influenza A cases, H3 subtype was detected in 33, and was observed in all the age groups but in subjects aged 45-59 year old ( Table 2) . Six cases had the H1 subtype (non-pandemic), and 18 influenza A viruses were isolated but not subtyped by one-step RT-PCR; of the latter, 11 can be classified as seasonal because they were isolated from patients samples collected before the start of the H1N1 pandemic outbreak of 2009. Twenty-one cases of pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus (pH1N1) infections were identified in this sentinel surveillance; thirteen occurred in the 15-29 year old group. There were no cases of pH1N1 infections among adults 45 years old or higher.
