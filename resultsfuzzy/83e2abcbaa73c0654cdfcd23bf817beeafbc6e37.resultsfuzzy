The experimental data (Figure 2) showed that the TGEV titers at 12, 24, and 48 hpi after TGEV infection of IPEC-J2 cells treated with Lp-1s were 10 2.5 TCID 50 /mL, 10 2.55 TCID 50 /mL, and 103.3 TCID 50 /mL, respectively. Compared with the TGEV control group, the amount of viral of lesions decreased by 1.1, 1.9, and 1.8-fold at 12, 24, and 48 hpi, respectively, in the Lp-1s group and no lesions appeared in the blank control group. Therefore, Lp-1s has a significant anti-TGEV effect ( * * p < 0.01) and is optimal for antiviral activity at 24 hpi.
