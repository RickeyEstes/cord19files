Incoming vRNPs, containing nucleoprotein (NP)-encapsidated viral genomic RNAs with associated viral polymerase proteins (PA, PB1, and PB2), are mostly located in the nuclei at 4 hpi; after 7 hours, newly synthesized vRNPs are predominantly in the cytoplasm [22] . To investigate the effect of siRNA-mediated FGFR1 silencing on early stage of influenza virus infection, incoming vRNPs were detected at 4 h after PR8 virus infection using indirect immunofluorescence assays with anti-influenza A virus NP antibodies (Fig 3A-3C ) [22, 23] . The results showed that the incoming vRNPs were mainly located in the nuclei of A549 cells at 4 hpi, while they could hardly be detected in the cytoplasm. The percentage of NP-positive cells to the total number of cells was then calculated (Fig 3D) . Cells exposed to FGFR1 siRNA interference showed the highest percentage of NP-positive cells compared with FGFR4-repressed cells or the negative control. These results indicated that FGFR1 silencing significantly increased PR8 entry efficiency at an early stage of the viral life cycle. (Fig 4A) . Viral titers were also reduced in FGFR1-overexpressing cells, but not in the other two groups (Fig 4C) . Similar results were observed in H5N1-infected A549 cells (Fig 4B and 4D ). There was more than a 2.5-fold increase in mRNA expression of FGFR1 or FGFR4 in A549 cells (Fig 4E) . The effective exogenous expression of FGFR1 or FGFR4 was also confirmed by Western blotting (Fig 4F) . These results indicated that FGFR1 as a cellular antiviral factor could inhibit influenza A virus infection; meanwhile, influenza A virus may evade the inhibitory effect by downregulating FGFR1 protein levels. Treatment of PD173074, a FGFR kinase activity inhibitor, enhanced influenza A/PR8 virus replication FGFR1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine autophosphorylation of FGFR1 can be induced by extracellular stimuli [24] . Our previous results suggested that influenza A (H1N1) virus infection downregulated FGFR1 expression (Fig 1A and 1E ), but whether influenza virus infection stimulated FGFR1 phosphorylation remains unknown. FGFR1 could inhibit influenza virus replication, but whether FGFR1 kinase activation had an effect on virus replication has not yet been explored. Next, the effect of influenza infection in A549 cells on FGFR1 phosphorylation for the indicated times was investigated (Fig 5A) . The results showed that FGFR1 phosphorylation was obviously reduced by PR8 infection over time, which suggested that influenza A (H1N1) virus infection downregulated FGFR1 phosphorylation in A549 cells. To address the second question, PD173074 as a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the FGFR family that can inhibit autophosphorylation of FGFR1 in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 in the range 1-5 nM [25] was used to verify the effect of FGFR1 kinase activity on virus replication. A549 cells were pretreated with PD173074 and then infected with PR8 virus. The results showed that FGFR1 phosphorylation in PR8-infected A549 cells was significantly suppressed by PD173074 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 5B) . There was little difference in M1 expression in A549 cells with 5 nM of PD173074 treatment; however, when the dose of PD173074 increased to 10 and 20 nM, virus M1 expression in A549 cells remarkably increased (Fig 5C) . For cytotoxicity analysis, the viability of A549 cells with varying amounts of PD173074 with or without PR8 infection was measured using the MTT assay. The results showed that the range 5-20 nM of PD173074 did not induce significant cytotoxicity (Fig 5D) . These results suggested that the repression of FGFR1 phosphorylation in A549 cells with PD173074 treatment could enhance influenza virus replication.
