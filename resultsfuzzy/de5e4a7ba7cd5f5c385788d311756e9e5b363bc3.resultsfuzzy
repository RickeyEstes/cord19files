An examination to determine the most suitable reaction parameters commenced with an analysis of solvent and temperature. Without the use of a catalyst, the temperature required to achieve formation of the o-pyridinone methide was determined to be 105°C in protic solvents. In aprotic solvents, the o-pyridinone methide did not form to an appreciable extent at comparable temperatures. The high solubility of pyridoxine in alcohols enabled the coupling partner to be utilized without the need for a traditional organic solvent. A series of conditions was screened with instructive examples highlighted in Table 1 . Pyridoxine 1 in n-butanol at 105°C provided 5c in a 51% yield after 24 h (entry 1) with significant unreacted starting material isolated during purification. Allowing the control to run to completion by TLC analysis provided an 83% yield (entry 2) over 96 h. Despite the long reaction time, the reaction provides clean conversion to the ether products and avoids the dimerization and byproducts formation that occurs at higher temperatures. 16 No reactivity was observed for temperatures under 100°C regardless of reaction time. Increasing the temperature to 120-160°C shortened the reaction time; however, this led to a higher degree of decomposition and a lower selectivity ratio of the ortho-to meta-substitution. We then sought to employ a catalyst to expedite the reaction time. Using 0.2 M n-butanol and pyridoxine for the synthesis of 5c as a model system, an investigation to identify a suitable catalyst was undertaken. Since pyridoxine has been noted to form radicals in biological systems, 18 we began the study with an analysis of radical initiators. Of the radical initiators attempted, dibenzoyl peroxide provided the highest yields and facilitated product formation Scheme 1. Thermal ortho-pyridinone methide formation and trapping with alcohols. below 100°C; however, the catalyst provided less 5c than the uncatalyzed conditions at both lower temperatures (entry 3) and at 105°C (entry 4). Several boronic acid catalysts were also screened as they have been demonstrated as efficient promoters of o-quinone methide formation; 19 these attempts provided lower yields than the uncatalyzed conditions (entry 6). A series of Brönsted and Lewis acid catalysis were attempted and most hindered the desired reactivity or provided a lower selectivity ratio of the ortho-to meta-substitution. p-Toluenesulfonic acid (entry 7), the catalyst used in the microwave-assisted synthesis of ginkgotoxin, 17 provided a 53% yield. Basic conditions, as utilized by Harris, 10 provided a faster reaction, but favored decomposition with trace product formation. With suitable solventless, catalystfree conditions in hand, an examination of the allowable steric and electronic parameters with respect to the alcohol coupling partner was undertaken. A variety of primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols were submitted to the reaction conditions with the results compiled in Table 2 . The yields for the thermal o-pyridinone methide trapping with various alcohols ranged from 38 to 83%. Generally, the less substituted alcohols provided higher yields than those with higher substitution. Additionally, the lower boiling point alcohols (2, 5a, 5b, 5d ) that required a pressurized vessel tended to provide lower yields than the higher boiling entries. Ginkgotoxin 2 was obtained in a 57% yield. The high boiling point primary alcohols, n-butanol, benzyl, and geraniol (5c, 5g, 5h) provided excellent yields of 83%, 70%, and 82% respectively. The geranyl example (5h) is particularly encouraging since it contains sensitive functionality that may not work well under the previously reported Lewis acid/base-catalyzed conditions. The ether moiety of 2-methoxyethanol (5j) was tolerated by the reaction manifold and provided an acceptable yield of 52%. Propargylic alcohol provided an inseparable complex product mixture with the Diels-Alder adduct. Other 3-pyridinol derivatives, (4-methoxypyridin-2-yl)methanol and 2-(hydroxymethyl)pyridin-3-ol HCl were attempted in the reaction manifold but only trace product was observed after three days with n-butanol.
