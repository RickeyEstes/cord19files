The reaction of 1H-indole-2,3-dione (1), malononitrile/ethylcyanoacetate (2), and 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-diones (3) was examined in the presence of catalytic amount (30 mg) of ZnO nanoparticle under microwave irradiation and conventional heating to give novel 7 -amino-2 2 -dimethyl-2,4 -dioxo-1,2-dihydrospiro[indoline-3,5 -pyrano [2,3-d] [1 , 3 ] dioxine]-6 -carbonitrile/carboxyethylester (4a-f)/(5a-f) (Scheme 1) (Table 1) . To obtain the optimal conditions, the synthesis of 4a and 5a was used as a model reaction. A mixture of 1, 2, and 3 in the presence of ZnO nanoparticles (30 mg) was either refluxed for 10 hrs or irradiated inside microwave oven for 9 min resulting in the formation of 4a in 62 or 87% yield, respectively (Table 2) . In order to confirm the effective involvement of ZnO nanoparticle during this transformation, a control experiment was conducted in the absence of ZnO nanoparticle for 4a, the reaction did not proceed, and the substrate remained unchanged even after 35 minutes of microwave irradiation and 25 hrs of conventional heating (Table 2) , while good results were obtained in the presence of ZnO nanoparticles. After some preliminary experiments, we found that a mixture of 1H-indole-2,3-dione, malononitrile, and 2,2-dimethyl-1,3dioxane-4,6-diones in the presence of ZnO nanoparticle afforded products in 87% yield under microwave irradiation (Table 1) . Encouraged by these results, we have extended this reaction to variously substituted 1H-indole-2,3-diones under similar conditions to furnish the respective spiro(indolepyranodioxine) derivatives in excellent yields (81-88%) using ZnO nanoparticle as a catalyst under microwave irradiation (Table 1) . Compounds were also synthesized under conventional heating using ZnO nanoparticle but yield of the product was found to be low (62-71%) as compared to that obtained under microwave irradiation. The synthesis of compound 4a was carried out by refluxing for 10 hrs resulting in 62% yield, while under microwave irradiation, reaction took 9 min with 87% yield of the product. It showed that microwave irradiation was found to have a beneficial effect on the synthesis of spiro(indole-pyranodioxine) derivatives (Table 2) . On optimizing the amount of catalyst, we found that 30 mg of ZnO nanoparticles could effectively catalyze the reaction for the synthesis of desired product. With the inclusion of 10 mg and 20 mg, reaction took longer time. Using more than 30 mg has less effect on the yield and time of the reaction. Therefore, 30 mg of ZnO nanoparticles was The Scientific World Journal sufficient to push the reaction forward, and further increasing of the amount of ZnO nanoparticles did not increase the yields (Table 3) . Reusability is one of the most important properties of this catalyst. To study the recyclability of the catalyst, the ZnO nanoparticles were used for the same reaction repeatedly and the change in their catalytic activity was studied. The relation between the number of cycles of the reaction and the catalytic activity in terms of yield of product is presented in Figure 1 . The catalyst recovered by filtration from the reaction mixture after dilution with ethyl acetate was reused as such for subsequent experiments under similar conditions. The catalyst retained optimum activity till five cycles after which drop in yield was observed (Figure 1) . A conceivable mechanism for the formation of the product would be as follows. The ZnO nanoparticle facilitate the Knoevenagel type coupling through Lewis acid sites (Zn +2 ) coordinated to the oxygen of carbonyl groups. On the other hand, ZnO nanoparticles can activate methylene compounds so that deprotonation of the C-H bond occurs in the presence of Lewis basic sites (O âˆ’2 ). As a result, the formation of spiroindole derivatives proceeds by activation of reactants through both Lewis acids and basic sites of ZnO nanoparticles.
