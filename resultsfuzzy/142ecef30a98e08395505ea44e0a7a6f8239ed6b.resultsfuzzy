Indoor air pollutants consist of particulates, bioaerosols and gaseous pollutants (i.e., VOCs, CO, CO 2 ) and are known to adversely impact health and comfort [35] . An on-site survey of forty-four residential households in Hong Kong was conducted during the Table 1 was monitored on a 24-h basis and the mean results were reported. The concentrations of VOCs were determined in accordance to USEPA TO-17 method and the airborne bacteria were measured according to the ACGIH guidelines for bioaerosol assessment. The mean total VOC level exceeds 100 g m 3 for both summer and winter, but the composition of the pollutant varies. An inordinate high level of formaldehyde was detected during the summer months and was attributed to the more frequent use of commercial disinfectants and cleanser in households following the SARS outbreak. This could explain the low bacteria count of the bioaerosol samples obtained during this period. The formaldehyde returned to normal level during the winter months when anxiety about SARS abated. This is also reflected by an increase in the mean level of airborne bacteria during the winter, however lower ventilation and frequent indoor activities (i.e., higher CO 2 ) also contribute to the overall increase in indoor bioaerosol. The results of the winter survey is more in-line with the earlier study conducted in 1999 by Lee et al. [36] . The particulate (RSP), formaldehyde and bacteria levels in both 1999 and 2003 winter surveys exceed the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department IAQ Excellent Class Standard of 20 g m 3 , 30 g m 3 and 500 CFU m 3 , respectively. Prior works by the authors showed that various nanostructured TiO 2 photocatalyst is effective against a wide range of organic pollutants including aromatic and chlorinated hydrocarbons and could be optimized to curtail the formation of undesired byproducts [ [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . The nanostructured TiO 2 can also inactivate Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [41] [42] [43] [44] .
