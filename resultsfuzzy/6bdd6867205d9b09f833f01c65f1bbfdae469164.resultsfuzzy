As shown in Table 1 , by selecting the top-K important details and the relationships among them, our DRE-Net improves about 7.0% recall and 3.0% F1-score over VGG16 with the same fold assignments, respectively. Figure 2 shows the receiver-operating characteristic curves for comparisons with other baseline models and the confusion matrix of DRE-Net on the test set.
