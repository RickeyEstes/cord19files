Discharge from ICU When discharged from ICU, most patients (59%) were referred within the same hospital, 41% to another hospital or to a rehabilitation unit. Only one person was discharged home. Inpatient stays The number of patients' individual hospital stays is depicted in Fig. 2a . Including the initial hospital stay for the treatment of ARDS, the median number of inpatient stays within 1 year after discharge from ICU was 3 (IQR 2-4). These stays comprised re-admissions to both ICUs and normal wards, admissions for medical problems not related to the initial ICU stay and rehabilitative measures. Only 10% of patients had no additional hospital stay after discharge from the clinic where they had been treated for ARDS. Within the first year after discharge from ICU, the median number of days of hospitalization was 48 (IQR 31-76) (see Fig. 2b ). The variability was high: Nearly 10% of patients were hospitalized for a period longer than 6 months. Outpatient visits All study participants reported at least one outpatient visit to a general practitioner or any other physician during the first year after discharge from ICU. Most participants contacted physicians from various specialties: The median number of different medical specialties visited was 4 (IQR 3-6) including general practitioners and 3 (IQR 2-5) without general practitioners. Table 2 provides an overview on which percentage of study participants utilized the different medical specialties. The most frequently contacted medical specialties were general practitioners with 93% of study participants reporting a visit, followed by internists with 56%. 37% of study participants had at least one visit to a neurologist, psychiatrist or psychotherapist. Overall, the median number of outpatient visits during the first year after discharge from ICU was 15, with a high variability between participants (IQR 8-25). The median number of outpatient visits to a general practitioner was 7 (IQR 4-12), and the median number for visits to physicians from any other specialty was 8 (IQR [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . In univariable analyses, indicators of disease severity (SOFA score, SAPS-II score), transferral from another hospital to the study hospital, length of ICU stay, overall length of hospital stay until discharge from ICU (including ICU stay) and mechanical ventilation at discharge from ICU were significantly associated with the number of days hospitalized during the first year after ICU (Table 3 ). There was no significant association with any of the sociodemographic variables. Table 4 presents the results of the multivariable analysis. Since the predictor variables "length of hospital stay" and "length of ICU stay" were highly correlated (r = 0.9), only length of ICU stay was included in the multivariable model. Duration of hospitalization after discharge from ICU was significantly associated with length of ICU stay (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.10, 95% CI 1.05-1.15), with each 10 days of ICU stay prolonging the duration of hospitalization after discharge from ICU by 10%. All other associations were attenuated in the multivariable model and did not reach statistical significance.
