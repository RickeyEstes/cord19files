To further confirm the positive results obtained by STI-MS assay, the same nucleic acid extracts used for STI-MS analysis were also analyzed either with real-time PCR or nested PCR. All positive specimens were first analyzed using real-time PCR targeting species-specific genes. Real-time PCR was performed using a simplex real-time PCR developed or adapted for the following organisms: HSV-1 and HSV-2, C. trachomatis, T. pallidum, N. gonorrhoeae, M. genitalium, M. hominis, U. urealyticum, and U. parvum. Specimens with a cycle threshold (Ct) value above 38 were considered negative. Any samples that were not confirmed by the initial round of real-time PCR analysis were retested with nested PCR. The primers employed for the nested PCR with sequencing were designed in-house and selected according to the previously published literature. [26] [27] [28] A negative control was included for each PCR run to ensure the purity of the reagent. A specimen was considered positive for a given result if either of the two assays for that result were positive. Tables S2 and S3 provide details about the primers and probes used in this study for real-time PCR and nested PCR-based confirmation. Digital PCR (dPCR) was performed for the arbitration of discrepant results between the STI-MS assay and confirmatory tests. Digital PCR amplifications were carried out on a microchip using a QuantStudio ® 3D Digital PCR System (Applied Biosciences, Foster City, CA, USA). A final reaction volume of 14.5 μL was prepared, containing 7.25 μL QuantStudio ® 3D Digital PCR Master Mix, 0.29 μL (10 μM) of probe, 0.1305 μL (100 μM) of each primer, 1.699 μL H 2 O and 5 μL of DNA template. According to the manufacturer's instructions, a 14.5 μL reaction mixture was immediately loaded on the QuantStudio ® 3D dPCR chip using QuantStudio ® 3D Digital PCR chip loader. The chip was then placed on the ProFlex PCR system for PCR amplification using the following cycling conditions: initial hold at 96°C for 10 mins; 39 cycles at 58°C for 2 mins, and 98°C for 30 s; and 60°C for 2 mins. Following amplification, the chips were inserted into the chip reader for imaging, and the data were analyzed using the cloudbased QuantStudio ® 3D AnalysisSuite software. For each digital PCR run, at least one positive and negative control was included.
