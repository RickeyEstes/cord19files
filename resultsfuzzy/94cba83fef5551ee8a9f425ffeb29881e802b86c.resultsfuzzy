At present, a panel of approximately 15 respiratory RT-PCR assays is available in many hospitals. Data suggest that RSV has the greatest disease burden both in hospitalized children and in outpatients, especially in children under five years of age [41] . Furthermore, Human Rhinovirus (HRV) is generally associated with the common cold, can cause severe ARI as well and is the most common pathogen in ARI in young children [42, 43] . Re-infections with HRV are commonly observed, and are usually caused by different virus strains. [44] As reviewed by Kim, recent studies suggest that HRV subtype C may be more virulent than other HRV [45] , but not all RT-PCRs are capable of distinguishing between the different HRV strains. Influenza virus (IV) is well known for its seasonal outbreaks of ARI during a few weeks in winter, and also for a sepsis like syndrome without respiratory symptoms. Human adenovirus (HAdV) is common in respiratory disease with a severe disease course in children with underlying immunodeficiency [46] . Para-influenza viruses (PIV) subtypes 1 and 2 are known to cause croup and subtype 3 is known to cause bronchiolitis and pneumomia [47] . PIV subtype 4 is has been reported to be a much less frequent cause of ARI [48] . The incidence of polyomaviruses WU [49] and KI [50] is low and their clinical relevance remain unclear and require further evaluation [51] . The role of newly discovered viruses is of interest in many studies. Some of these 'new' viruses are Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV), Human Bocavirus (HBoV) and Human Coronavirus (HCoV). HMPV was first detected in 2001 [52] , and its clinical symptoms overlap with those of other respiratory viruses [53] . Disease severity seems less than for RSV [54] . Another 'new' virus is HBoV, discovered in 2005 [55] . In a review by Brodzinsky, the incidence is found to be low (1.5-4.5%) and rates of co-infections are high (14-72%) [56] . The spectrum of disease is similar to RSV and hMPV. The group of HCoV's are heterogeneous. HCoV 229E [57] , OC43, [58, 59] NL63 [60, 61] and HKU1 [62] are recognized frequently in young age and are correlated with less severe respiratory disease [54, 63] . SARS coronavirus and the novel MERS coronavirus [64] are not routinely incorporated in respiratory RT-PCR test panels. A recent Swedish study compared viral PCR findings from children with ARI versus asymptomatic matched controls. RSV, hMPV and PIVs were highly overrepresented in symptomatic patients, suggesting that they are responsible for illness. Asymptomatic controls showed high detection rates of HBoV, HRV, HAdV, HCoV and enterovirus, suggesting that prolonged virus-shedding may occur and that PCR-results need to be interpreted with caution [65] . The incidence of mixed viral infections is reported as high as 14 -44%, depending on different populations and test panels [66] . In a multicenter study, involving 2207 children less than 2 years of age, the incidence of mixed infection in children hospitalized for bronchiolitis was 30% [67] . Several circumstances can generate positive RT-PCR results. RT-PCR assays are very sensitive and can detect small amounts of viral nucleic acids, which are still present during a convalescence period. For each individual virus it is not known how long DNA/RNA shedding may continue during this convalescence period [68, 69] . Furthermore, children with a normal immune system can asymptomatically harbor viruses in their respiratory tract. Usually, a primary viral infection leads to an adaptive immune response with induction of memory T-cells, so that a second hit with the same virus usually results in less serious or even absent symptoms [70] . The relevance of finding only a single pathogen is also of interest. RT-PCR assays are sensitive tests, but detect only pathogens that are looked for. For each micro-organism a specific primer is used, therefore non-viral pathogens like Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydophyla pneumonia are not detected unless they are looked for. They can mimic viral disease as well, especially in young children [71] . One could hypothesize that mixed infections may lead to a more severe disease. Papers on this subject show somewhat contradictory results. There are a few reports suggest that there is no relation between mixed viral ARI and disease severity [72] [73] [74] [75] , while others indicate a higher disease severity in children with a mixed respiratory infection [76, 77] . Further research as to how one should interpret multiple, positive RT-PCR results in one single sample is needed. Quantitative studies with interpretation of viral load will possibly help to answer this question.
