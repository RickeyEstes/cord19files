In order to obtain two complementary views of the infection kinetics for the A/Brisbane/59/2007 WT and H275Y mutant strains, virus growth over time was observed in two different in vitro systems: the viral plaque assay and the multiple-cycle viral yield assay. Viral plaque assays. Figure 1 shows representative plaques for the WT and H275Y mutant strains of A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1) viruses at each time point. The average plaque radius of each strain over time, calculated by averaging three independent experiments of three such wells at each time point, is shown in Figure 2 . The plaque growth is characterized by an initial delay where no growth is observed, followed by a period of linear increase of the plaque radius over time. After 60 h, the rate of plaque growth declines and the linear approximation is no longer valid. The growth attenuation could be due to a number of factors including a hardening of the overlay, a depletion of nutrients required for viral production and cell maintenance, and the widespread destruction of the cell monolayer leading to holes and irregularities disrupting and limiting further growth. The plaque assay is a long-standing and standard technique in virology [27, 28] and plaque sizes have been used in many in vitro studies to qualitatively evaluate the phenotypes of various viruses [22, 29, 30] . Plaque assays are often used for strain comparison and, in that context, plaque diameters at a single time point are reported. These plaque diameters are then typically used to conclude that, for example, if the plaques observed at 48 h for strain A are larger than those for strain B, then strain A must have a higher replicative fitness than strain B. However, one should question whether such conclusions are valid and robust to experimental variability. Looking at Figure 2 , one can see that at 36 h, the plaque radius of both A/Brisbane/59/2007 WT and its H275Y mutant counterpart are comparable in size. Yet at 60 h, the WT strain has significantly larger plaques than the H275Y mutant, and the situation is reversed at 96 h. Thus, relying on single time point measurements for comparing strains can be misleading. Here, instead, we exploit the fact that the average plaque growth is approximately linear in time between 36 and 60 h. This allows us to extract a novel measure, the plaque velocity, which is the slope in the linear regression of the plaque radius to the 36, 48 and 60 h time points. The plaque velocity, unlike the plaque radius at a given time point, is a robust measure in that it takes into account plaque radius at several time points and is not affected by differences in the length of the delay period which precedes the period of linear growth. Using this method, the measured plaque growth was more rapid for the WT than the H275Y mutant, with a plaque velocity of 1:79+0:1d cell =h compared to 1:48+ 0:1d cell =h, where d cell is the diameter of one cell. Thus, using plaque velocity alone, it would appear that the WT strain has a replicative fitness advantage over the H275Y mutant. Multiple-cycle viral yield assays. In order to complement the information provided by the plaque assay, namely the plaque velocity, we also conducted multiple-cycle viral yield experiments. The results of these experiments for the WT and H275Y mutant strains are shown in Figure 3 . The kinetics of the viral yield experiments can be broken into two different phases: an exponential growth of virus concentration, characterized by the viral titer growth rate, followed by an exponential decay of virus concentration, characterized by the viral titer decay rate, after the viral titer peak. The viral titer decay rate was the same for both strains at 0:19+0:02h {1 . The viral titer growth rate of the H275Y mutant was 0:83+ 0:02h {1 , slightly greater than that of the WT which was 0:75+0:04h {1 . Thus, it would appear from the viral titer growth rate alone, that the H275Y mutant has a replicative advantage over the WT strain, in contrast with the findings using the plaque velocity extracted from the plaque assay alone. This discrepancy between the conclusions drawn from each experimental measure points to a complementarity between the two assays: they appear to emphasize different aspects of viral replication. Thus, combining the information provided by these two assays is key to obtaining a complete and consistent picture of what shapes a particular strain's replicative fitness. Because the plaque velocity and the viral titer growth rate depend on both the infecting time, t inf , and the latent infection period, t L , the experimental measurement of either quantity alone is not sufficient to specify the values of these infection parameters for a given strain. The measurement of both, however, can provide enough information for this specification, provided that the dependence on the parameters is sufficiently different for the two quantities. To demonstrate this concept using the A/ Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1) WT and H275Y mutant strains, we have plotted the experimentally-measured values of plaque velocity and viral titer growth rate as functions of the infecting time and latent infection period, using the model dependence determined above ( Figure 6 ). Figures 6A and 6D show the values of the kinetics parameters most consistent with the measured plaque velocities of the A/ Brisbane/59/2007 WT and H275Y mutant strains, respectively. Rather than plot a single line at the average measured value, we have accounted for the error in the measurement of the plaque velocities by plotting regions of contour denoting the one-and two-standard deviations (for a detailed description see Materials and Methods). We can see that while the plaque velocity does constrain the two parameters to a specific region, that region is too large to allow any useful comparison of the two strains. Similarly, Figures 6B and 6E show the values of the kinetics parameters most consistent with the measured viral titer growth rate. The consistency of a particular pair of parameter values with each of the two experimental measures can be combined by finding the intersection of the two parameter regions. This region of intersection corresponds to those parameter values most consistent with the parallel plaque and viral yield experimental measurements for a particular strain. The extent of these regions, shown in Figure 6C for the A/Brisbane/59/2007 WT strain and Figure 6F for the H275Y mutant strain, is summarized in Table 2 . The region of intersection suggests that the latent infection period for the H275Y mutant (w7 h) is longer than that of the WT strain (1-3 h), while the infecting time of the mutant (v 5 min) is much shorter than that of the WT (30-80 min).
