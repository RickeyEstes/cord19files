The high potency of the chloroform extract (IC 50 ¼ 9.3 lg/mL against a-glucosidase) indicated the presence of compounds that may by therapeutic against infectious diseases 7 . Therefore, the major compounds of BP Fr. 6 and 7 were expected to exhibit enzyme inhibitory activities. UPLC-PDA-QTOF-MS analyses were carried out using a C18 column with a linear gradient of acetonitrile/ water. Each peak was characterized using MS. The m/z values of molecular ions [M-H] À of compounds 1-10 were 323, 339, 321, 437, 325, 393, 391, 425, 395, and 409, respectively (Supplementary material). We isolated ten active compounds using prep-HPLC on octadecyl-functionalized silica gel. The isolated compounds were characterized by comparison of spectroscopic data, including 1D and 2D-NMR, mass spectral data of molecular ions, UV-Vis absorption maxima, and optical rotation, with those published previously 7,13 . Compounds 1-10 were identified as broussochalcone B 1 , broussochalcone A 2 , 4-hydroxyisolonchocarpin 3 , papyriflavonol A 4 , 3 0 -(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-3 0 ,4 0 ,7-trihydroxyflavane 5 , kazinol A 6 , kazinol B 7 , broussoflavan A 8 , kazinol F 9 and kazinol J 10 ( Figure 1) . We first expressed CoV cysteine proteases (SARS-3CL pro , SARS-PL pro , MERS-3CL pro , and MERS-PL pro ) in E. coli, purified the proteins to homogeneity, and determined their activity with a fluorometric cleavage assay. The IC 50 values of the isolated compounds, which measure their ability to inhibit the catalytic activity of the proteases, were calculated by fitting the data to a logic derivative equation. We also examined the a-glucosidase inhibitory capacity of the isolated compounds 7 . These compounds showed dosedependent inhibitory effects on both a-glucosidase and cysteine proteases. Results of the CoV cysteine protease inhibition assays are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. All tested polyphenols (1-10) showed dose-dependent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV PL pro ( Figure 3 ). As shown in Table 1 , the compounds were more potent against SARS-CoV PL pro compared with the other cysteine proteases. The IC 50 values of compounds 1-10 against trans-cleavage activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro ranged from 30.2 to 233.3 lM. Among the isolated polyphenols, the C5-alkyl group (prenyl)-substituted flavan 5 exhibited the most potent inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV 3CL pro and was more effective than quercetin (IC 50 ¼ 52.7 lM). General structural-activity relationships can be deduced from these data, for example, molecules with a C4-OH group and a saturated chromenone with a dihydroxy group at ring C showed higher inhibitory activity than those with a closed prenyl group (7, IC 50 ¼ 233.3 lM). Chalcones (1-3, IC 50 : 57.8-202.7 lM) and biphenyl propanoids (9 and 10, IC 50 : 43.3-64.2 lM) moderately inhibited SARS-CoV 3CL pro activity. Furthermore, the activity of the compounds was significantly affected by subtle changes in their molecular structure, such as from prenylation and methylation (vide infra). The prenylated flavone derivative, 4, exhibited the highest inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV PL pro (IC 50 ¼ 3.7 lM). The positions of the two prenyl groups had substantial effect on SARS-CoV PL pro inhibition by the corresponding compounds. The SARS-CoV PL pro inhibitory potency of the prenyl flavone was considerably higher than that of flavone derivatives, including keampferol (IC 50 ¼ 16.3 lM), quercetin (IC 50 ¼ 8.6 lM), and quercetin-b-galactoside (IC 50 ¼ 51.9 lM). It is probable that the presence of a prenyl group within the resorcinol group allows for the formation of strong hydrophobic interactions with the enzyme. Additionally, an increase in the number of hydroxyl groups in the flavone backbone resulted in higher inhibitory activity, which can be noted from the lower IC 50 value of quercetin (8.6 lM) compared to that of kaempferol (IC 50 ¼ 16.3 lM). Among chalcone derivatives with a closed prenyl ring (chromenone, which is characterized by a C5prenyl group in ring B), diminishing protease inhibitory activity was observed (2, IC 50 ¼ 9.2 lM >1, IC 50 ¼ 11.6 lM > isoliquiritigenin, IC 50 ¼ 24.6 lM>3, IC 50 ¼ 35.4 lM). In contrast, the number of prenyl groups and the degree of saturation did not have any effect on the prenylated flavans. As shown in Table 1 6 exhibited moderate inhibitory activity (IC 50 values ranging from 30.4 to 35.8 lM). Additionally, compound 10, which contains a methoxy group that is also present in the corresponding biphenyl propanoids, was two-fold more effective (IC 50 ¼ 15.2 lM) than the unmethylated 9. To investigate the protease inhibition mechanism, we examined the effect of the compounds (1-10 and corresponding compounds) on the kinetics of substrate proteolysis. The kinetic studies showed that compounds 2 and 4 exhibited noncompetitive inhibition based on Lineweaver-Burk plots (1/V vs. 1/[S]) with the same x-axis intercept (Figure 4) . Inhibition of SARS-CoV PL pro activity decreased with increasing concentrations of the substrate. All inhibitors studied exhibited the same mode of inhibition. The K i values of the compounds were calculated from Dixon plots ( Table 1) . Surface plasmon resonance is a useful technique for monitoring molecular reactions in real-time and has been used to determine binding specificity as well as rates of association and dissociation between ligands and target proteins. In this study, SARS-CoV PL pro was immobilized on a sensor chip and the most potent PL pro inhibitor, compound 4, was passed over the sensor's surface. As shown in Figure 5 , the interaction of compound 4 with SARS-CoV PL pro was due to a specific binding event. The SPR sensorgram was recorded at different concentrations of the compound and was used to determine the kinetic-binding parameters, the association rate constant (k a lM À 1 s À 1 ), and the dissociation rate constant (k d , s À 1 ). For SARS-CoV PL pro , compound 4 increased the SPR sensorgram in a significant and dose-dependent manner. The K D (k d /k a ) for the interaction between compound 4 and SARS-CoV PL pro indicated a classical interaction, with k a ¼ 21.0 lM À 1 s À 1 , k d ¼ 0.004448 s À1 , and K D ¼ 212 lM. Although inhibition assays revealed compound 2 as the second most potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV PL pro , its K D was higher than that of compound 4. In recent year, PL pro has been the focus of numerous studies on the development of chemotherapeutic drugs against CoVinduced diseases. It is part of the nsp3 protein, and cleaves at the nsp1/2, nsp2/3 and nsp3/4 boundaries by recognizing the LXGG consensus motif. In addition, PL pro exhibits deubiquitinating (DUB) activity and antagonizes the induction of type-1 interferon (IFN). Interferon-stimulated gene 15 is one of the most upregulated genes upon type I IFN stimulation and is involved in tagging newly synthesized proteins during an antiviral response. Both ubiquitin and ISG15 may have important implications in viral replication and pathogenesis. SARS-CoV PL pro can cleave ubiquitin and ISG15 from cellular conjugates. Similarly, MERS-CoV PL pro has also been shown to possess DUB and deISG15ylating activities. Thus, an effective anti-CoV drug is one that inhibits viral protease activity as well as DUB and deISG15ylating activities. Since 4 inhibits SARS-CoV PL pro , we postulated that its efficacy would be higher by having DUB and deISG15ylating activities. Compound 4 strongly inhibited the cleavage of both ubiquitin and ISG15 (IC 50 values of 7.6 and 8.5 lM, respectively). Complete substitution of prenyl groups (4 vs. quercetin, IC 50 values of 20.7 and 34.4 lM, respectively) and introduction of hydroxyl groups strongly affected activity (quercetin vs. kaempferol, IC 50 values of 61.7 and 71.7 lM, respectively). All of the tested compounds display moderate inhibition of in vitro cleavage of ubiquitin (IC 50 ¼ 7.6-136.9 lM) and ISG15 (IC 50 ¼ 8.5-71.7 lM) ( Table 1) . To date, the function of the DUB activity of PL pro in vivo is unknown, as is the identity of its in vivo cellular substrate. Thus, further investigation is necessary to determine the specificity of its inhibition by measuring the cleavage of ubiquitin-like protein ISG15, which could reveal whether deISGylation by PL pro is a mechanism by which SARS-CoV inactivates IFN-a/b-induced innate immune response. To determine whether the isolated compounds described earlier are effective inhibitors of MERS-CoV cysteine proteases, their inhibitory potential were assessed using recombinant 3CL and PL proteases expressed in our laboratory. As shown in Table 2 , none of the compounds were potent or selective against MERS-CoV cysteine proteases. Compound 1 effectively inhibited MERS-CoV 3CL pro activity (IC 50 ¼ 27.9 lM), similar to its effect against SARS-CoV 3CL pro . It also has a comparable mode of action for subtle structural changed. On the other hand, the isolated polyphenols did not show any significant inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV PL pro (IC 50 values ranging from 39.5 to 171.6 lM). The most potent MERS-CoV PL pro inhibitor was the biphenyl propanoid, compound 9 (IC 50 ¼ 39.5 lM).
