The models explained 79%, 91%, 71% of the seasonal variation in cold/flu (Model CF1), cough (Model C1), fever (Model F1) ( Table 2 ). For the 0e4 year age group, the Figure 1 Weekly variation in laboratory reports of respiratory pathogens (October 2002eOctober 2004) , displayed as a proportion of total reports for each pathogen. (Pathogens that significantly influenced the models are colour coded; pathogens with <100 reports per year are not displayed). models explained 88% of the variation in cough calls (Model C1 (0e4 years)) and 76% of the variation in fever calls (Model F1 (0e4 years)) ( Table 2 . Detailed results of the difficulty breathing models are also not reported as the power of both models was low (Model DB1: Estimated contribution of respiratory pathogens to NHS Direct calls show the weekly estimates of the contribution of respiratory disease pathogens to NHS Direct cold/flu calls, cough calls (all calls and 0e4 years separately), and fever calls (0e4 years). They illustrate the relatively high but short lived contribution of influenza and RSV during seasonal bursts, and the year round contribution, with December/January peaks, of S. pneumoniae. The model estimates generally corresponded to the observed number of NHS Direct calls, although the cold/flu and cough models provided poor estimates for weeks 39/04 to 45/04 (Figs. 2 and 3a,b) . There appeared to be little confounding between diseases with similar seasonality and clinical presentation (e.g. influenza and RSV) as removing either of these variables from the final models resulted in only minor increases in the estimated contribution of the remaining variables. For example, dropping RSV, rhinovirus and parainfluenza from model C1 (0e4) led to a small estimated increase in the contribution of influenza from 19% to 23% (model C3 (0e4)) ( Table 2 ).
