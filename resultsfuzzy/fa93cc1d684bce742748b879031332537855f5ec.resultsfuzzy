Harris hip scores were used to evaluate clinical outcomes of the patients. In the PCA group, the mean preoperative HHS was 72.0 ± 9.1 points for all hips and the mean postoperative HHS was 83.2 ± 10.9 points. In the control group, the mean preoperative HHS was 72.3 ± 8.5 points and the mean postoperative HHS was 84.9 ± 10.2 points ( Table 2 ). The average increase in scores was 11.1 ± 8.7 points for all hips in the PCA group and 12.6 ± 7.4 points for all hips in the control group. According to the Steinberg classification, the average increase in scores was 10.7 ± 6.0 points for stage II hips in the PCA group, 11.7 ± 5.7 points for stage II hips in the control group; 11.7 ± 8.6 points for stage III hips in the PCA group, 14.2 ± 6.0 points for stage III hips in the control group; 10.7 ± 10.6 points for stage IV hips in the PCA group, 11.4 ± 9.6 points for stage IV hips in the control group. There was no significant difference between them ( > 0.05). Radiographic results were evaluated using the criteria described above and summarised in Table 3 . In the PCA group, 49 hips were improved in the last radiographs (Figure 1 ), 10 hips appeared unchanged, and 8 hips appeared worse. In the control group, 47 hips were improved, 13 hips appeared unchanged, and 7 hips appeared worse.
