The unique ability of pDCs to produce very high levels of all subtypes of IFN-I in response to herpesvirus infections cannot be solely explained by their expression of TLR9 and by their ability to engulf viral particles or infected cells. Indeed, these two properties are shared with cDCs, especially the CD8α subset in the mouse, which still does not produce significant levels of IFN-I under the same experimental conditions. Indeed, additional properties have been demonstrated to contribute to the exquisite ability of pDCs to produce high levels of IFN-I upon viral stimulations (Scheme 1). IRF7 is the master transcription factor controling IFN-I production in response to viral type stimuli, as IRF7 -/mice show dramatic decreases in IFN-I production and enhanced mortality in response to challenges with different viruses, including MCMV [52] or HSV-1 [92] . Human and mouse pDCs constitutively express very high levels of IRF7 [80] . In contrast, in cDCs and other cell types, IRF7 expression is induced only secondarily to a first, IRF3-dependent, wave of IFN-β/α4 production [93] but is critical to drive the consecutive production of the other IFN-α suptypes in a positive feedback loop. Loss of IRF7 expression abolishes pDC responses to MCMV [52], HSV-1 and all the other viral stimuli that have been tested [92] . Thus, high constitutive expression of IRF7 strongly contributes to the unique ability of pDCs to produce high level of all IFN-I subtypes very rapidly upon viral stimulation. In addition, as compared to cDCs, pDCs are characterized by a long retention time of CpG desoxyoligonucleotides in dedicated, transferrin receptor + , endosomes where preformed multimolecular complexes exist which bridge together TLR7/9 and their downstream signaling machinery including MyD88 and IRF7 [94, 95] .
