Cloning, expression, purification, and general characterization of full-length S glycoprotein and soluble fragments To characterize the properties and function of the SARS-CoV S protein we cloned in expression vectors the DNAs encoding the full-length Tor2 isolate [6] S protein (1255 residues), the ectodomain S e (residues 17-1189) where the S putative transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail were deleted, fragments containing the N-terminal 276, 537, and 756 amino acid residues (S276, S537, and S756, respectively) including a putative 16-residue signal sequence [5] or a mouse k chain leader sequence, and an internal fragment (S272-537) containing residues 272-537 (Fig. 1) . We noted that a stretch of amino acid residues (758-761, RNTR) is a particular case of the general motif K/R-X n -K/R (X is any residue and n Â¼ 0, 2, 4 or 6) for cleavage by precursor convertases. Thus S756 approximates S1 in agreement with the size of S1 for murine coronaviruses, e.g., strain JHM where S1 is 769 residues [7] and human coronavirus OC43 (778 residues) [8] ; however, for the human coronavirus 229E S1 is considered to consist of a shorter 547 residue fragment which corresponds to S537 [9] . All proteins except the full-length S glycoprotein were tagged with a c-Myc epitope and a histidine tag. These proteins were expressed in 293 and Vero E6 cells after transfection with the corresponding plasmids followed by infection with vaccinia virus-expressing T7 polymerase. The tagged proteins were detected by using an anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2) . It is striking that the T7 promoter was much more efficient for expression of the S glycoprotein than the CMV promoter, which under most circumstances is a strong promoter (2A). The S fragments were soluble and their concentration in the culture supernatants was inversely proportional to their size (Fig. 2) . To be able to detect unlabeled proteins, validate the data obtained by the anti-c-Myc antibody, and localize possible antigenic sites we developed rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Two of these antibodies, D24 and P540 raised against peptides starting at residues 24 and 540, respectively, recognized specifically tagged soluble fragments (Fig. 2C) . As expected D24 recognized all fragments; P540 recognized S756, S e , and S but not the smaller fragments ( Fig. 2C and data not shown) . P540 was very sensitive even at dilution 1:10,000 and was mostly used in this study unlike D24 which was relatively weak. The full-length S glycoprotein was expressed at the cell surface, although at low levels as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 3) . All S glycoprotein fragments and the full-length S glycoprotein ran on a SDS-PAGE gel at positions significantly higher than their estimated molecular weights, indicating the possibility for post-translational modifications. S276 had an apparent molecular weight of about 75 kDa, S537-100-110 kDa, S756-130-140 kDa, and S e and S-about 200 kDa or higher (Figs. 2 and 4) . The bands were broad when observed at low exposure ( Fig. 4 and data not shown) . These data indicate significant glycosylation as observed for S glycoproteins from other coronaviruses. Based on approximate estimations of molecular weight it appears that S2 is not as heavily glycosylated as S756. Notably, S276 is heavily glycosylated if one assumes that only glycosylation contributes to the increased molecular mass. Most of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein was not cleaved, although we observed weak bands due to smaller proteins, one of which runs at the same position as S756, suggesting the possibility for inefficient cleavage (Fig. 4) . We cannot rule out the possibility of random digestion by proteases. Further studies are needed to determine if the S glycoprotein cleavage is necessary for its function. We have not observed measurable cytopathic effects in cells transfected with any of the constructs we developed (data not shown) indicating the possibility that the full-length and soluble fragments of the S glycoprotein may not have direct cytopathic effects. However, at higher levels of expression such effects are possible and obviously formation of syncytia as described in the next section could lead to cell death.
