Several protection measures including wearing masks, gowns and goggles were found to be significantly associated with decreased risk of SARS-CoV infection (P < 0.05). No significant difference between cases and controls was observed for the other factors, including smoking, alco-hol-drinking, nutrition status and physical activities (Table 1) . Allele frequencies of OAS1 and MxA genes in cases and controls were compared ( Table 2 ). The AG and GG genotypes in the 3'UTR of the OAS1 gene were significantly less frequent in case group (33.3% and 7.6%, respectively) than in control group (48.4% and 15.6%, respectively). Compared to AA genotype, AG and GG genotypes were found associated with a protective effect on SARS with ORs (95% CI) of 0.42 (0.20~0.89) and 0.30 (0.09~0.97), respectively. Also, a GT genotype at position 88 in the MxA gene promoter was associated with increased susceptibility to SARS infection compared to a GG genotype (OR = 3.06, 95% CI: 1.25~7.50). A multivariate analysis was conducted with disease status as the dependent variable, each genotype as an independent variable, and wearing masks, gowns and goggle as covariables. It was indicated that the individuals with OAS1 AG genotype were at decreased risk, and those with MxA genotype GT were at increased risk of contracting SARS infection, as compared to AA and GG for OAS1 gene, and to GG and TT for MxA gene, respectively (Table 3 and 4 ).
