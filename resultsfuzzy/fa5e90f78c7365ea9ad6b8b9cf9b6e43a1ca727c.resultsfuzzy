The statistical parameters of standard CoMFA models constructed with steric and electrostatic fields are given in Table 2 . The cross-validated coefficient (q 2 /r 2 cv), non-cross-validated correlation coefficient (r 2 ncv), standard error estimate (SEE) and F-statistic values (F) were computed as defined in SYBYL. The cross-validated (leave-one-out) PLS analysis shows a q 2 value of 0.636 with ten components and non-cross-validated PLS analysis results in r 2 ncv of 0.988, SEE of 0.094 and F value of 309.026, which indicates it is a model with high quality. The corresponding field contributions of steric and electrostatic are 0.671 and 0.329, respectively, which means the steric field gives more contribution to the bioactivity than the electrostatic field does. Commonly, in CoMSIA, five different similarity fields (steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, HBD, and HBA) are calculated. However, for CoMSIA models, the model with global descriptors is not the best model in all probability. Some papers [28, 29] have discussed whether the five different descriptor fields in CoMSIA are totally independent of each other. The dependencies of the individual fields usually decrease the signal-to-noise ratio in the data [29] and lower the statistical significance of the results. Therefore, in our study, an optimization of 31 possible combinations of five different descriptor fields was evaluated from the values of the q 2 , which is shown in Figure 1 . The higher the value of q 2 shows, the better the model is. With the highest q 2 of 0.843, CoMSIA model with the combination of steric and HBA fields (SA) was finally chosen as the best model, which indicates that the steric and HBA fields mainly contribute to the binding affinities. This CoMSIA (SA) model was obtained with seventeen optimal components. The analysis results are summarized in Table 2 (q 2 = 0.843, r 2 ncv = 0.989, F = 174.304, SEE = 0.096). The corresponding field contributions of steric and HBA are 0.677 and 0.323, respectively, which means that the steric field provides more bioactivity contribution than the HBA field does.
