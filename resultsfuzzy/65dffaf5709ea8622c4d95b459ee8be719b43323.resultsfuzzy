Some affected communities, like Hong Kong and Toronto (Canada), have a detailed record of the epidemics, allowing a deeper analysis of its dynamics. We designed a simple mathematical model to describe the spread of SARS and to predict the impact of control measures. We calculated the basic reproduction number, R 0 , for those communities and simulated the temporal evolution of the epidemics with and without control measures. The model is deterministic of the susceptibleinfected-recovered (SIR) [13] type, assuming homogeneously mixing contacts and considering the known parameters (duration of the infectious period and mortality rate of the infection). The model is described by the following set of differential equations, representing the temporal evolution of the number of individuals in each of the possible states, susceptibles X(t), infectious, Y(t) and recovered, Z(t): dXðtÞ=dt ¼ ÀbXðtÞYðtÞ=NðtÞ À lXðtÞ þ l½YðtÞ þ ZðtÞ; where b is the contact rate, c is the recovery rate, l is the natural mortality rate and a is the infection mortality rate. The cumulative number of cases, C(t), was calculated according to The contact rate parameter was estimated from the exponential initial phase of the epidemics [13] [14] [15] [16] . As we mentioned in a previous work [17] , R 0 can be estimated from the initial exponential growing phase of the number of cases. For this, we begin by fitting an exponential curve to the initial growing phase of the number of human cases of SARS, Y(t) Having R 0 it is possible to estimate the contact rate, b, the most difficult parameter to be obtained from epidemiological field research, through the relation We then simulated the model numerically under two hypothetical scenarios, the natural course of the infection (the contact parameter is kept constant in time) and under control measures (the contact parameter drops exponentially with time). In Fig. 1 we show the simulation for the Hong Kong community. The parameters applied were l = 0.00004 days À1 ; c = 0.1 days À1 ; and a = 0.08 days À1 , adapted from the data described by the WHO [18] . The initial value of b was calculated according to Eq. (4) and we used the relation b ¼ 2:16 Â 10 À1 for t 6 15 days; and bðtÞ ¼ ð2:16 Â 10 À1 Þ expðÀjtÞ for t > 15 days; ð5Þ with j = 0.0158 days À1 , for simulating control. That is, for the first 15 days b was assumed as constant and equal to 0.216 potentially infective contacts per day, dropping exponentially with rate j = 0.0158 days À1 thereafter. In order to compare the actual curve of cases with the theoretical projection of the number of cases without any control we kept the rate j as equal to zero for the entire epidemic period, as shown by the continuous line in Fig. 1 . In Fig. 2 we show the simulation for Toronto (Canada). The Canadian case has some peculiarities worth commenting. Besides being the only western country with a significant autochthonous SARS epidemic, after about 65 days the beginning of the first outbreak, when the number of new cases was almost zeroed, a second outbreak began, as can be easily noted by the sudden rise in the number of new cases occurring between days 65 and 80 (see Fig. 2 below) . The parameters used were b ¼ bðtÞ ¼ ð2:9 Â 10 À1 Þ expðÀjtÞ; with j = 0.0145 days À1 , simulating control; l = 0.00004 days À1 ; c = 0.1 days À1 ; and a = 0.12 days À1 . The second outbreak was simulated by assuming the number of the last cases before the outbreak as initial condition and applying the same equation for b(t), with b (0) = 2.9 · 10 À1 but with j = 0.45 days À1 . We therefore assumed a very quick response of the Canadian health authorities to this second outbreak. The calculated value for R 0 for Hong Kong was 1.20 and for Toronto (Canada) was 1.32. In Fig. 3 we show the simulation of the reproduction number of both epidemics.
