J. Ko * , A. Nowak-Wegrzyn, New York, NY. INTRODUCTION: Approximately 40% of children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) have food allergies. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is utilized by an estimated 16-27% of patients with allergies. We present a case of a 4 year-old boy with AD referred after receiving a diagnosis of food allergy by a CAM practitioner. METHODS/CASE: A 4 year-old boy was referred for evaluation of mild AD and possible food hypersensitivity. His AD started at 1 year of age and was limited to the face. He was initially breast-fed and was switched to milk-based formula at 4 months of age. Solids were introduced at 5 months of age without difficulty. He had no immediate reactions or noted worsening of AD due to foods. The patient presented to a naturopath for allergy evaluation. Based on electrodermal skin testing results, he was reported to be allergic to milk, egg, peanut, rice, and beef (all of which he had tolerated previously). He was restricted from milk and egg for 4 weeks without noticeable change in his AD, which was limited to the cheeks and controlled on topical pimecrolimus. RESULTS: His weight and height were both 75th percentile. Physical exam was normal except for 2-3 cm dry, erythematous patches on both cheeks and mildly dry skin on flexor/extensor surfaces of both arms. Skin prick testing revealed negative tests to milk, egg, peanut, and dust mite. Serum IgE testing was also negative. Since he had no evidence of IgE sensitization to commonly allergenic foods, he was recommended to continue an unrestricted diet and discontinue use of a "Sippy" cup. His AD subsequently improved on a skin care regimen of postbathing moisturization and topical pimecrolimus prn. Asthma and allergies are the #2 reason for CAM use in the US. Electrodermal skin testing is a method utilized by naturopathic doctors to detect allergen "sensitivity". However, in two double-blinded trials examining atopic and non-atopic patients, electrodermal testing did not correlate with skin prick testing results, regardless of inter-operator variability. CONCLUSIONS: Allergy patients are seeking CAM treatment, and it is important for physicians to be aware of the safety and efficacy of alternative medical practices. The use of electrodermal skin testing has not been proven to detect allergen sensitivity and use of this modality should be discouraged. A.S. Nayak 1* , R. Nathan 2 , J. Williams 3 , S. Kundu 3 , M.

Systemic exposure to ICS may suppress hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis function, particularly at doses required to control severe asthma. Ciclesonide (CIC) hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) metered dose inhaler (MDI) is a novel and effective ICS that is converted in the lungs to its active metabolite, desisobutyryl ciclesonide (des-CIC). Previously, in short-term studies, CIC has been shown to have no effect on serum or urinary cortisol levels, which may be attributed to the low oral bioavailability, high serum protein binding and high clearance rate of CIC and its active metabolite. This HPA axis analysis was part of a long-term study evaluating the safety of CIC and beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) HFA-MDI in patients with severe persistent asthma. METHODS: This was a multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, 12-month extension of a 12-week double-blind trial of patients 12 years with severe persistent asthma. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio (CIC:BDP) to receive CIC (320 g bid) exactuator or BDP (320 g bid) ex-actuator. After 2 weeks, the doses of both medications could be titrated to 160 g bid as needed for asthma control. HPA-axis function was assessed at selected centers in a subset of patients at baseline and end of study (at month 12 or early termination) by measuring both peak serum cortisol induced by low dose (1-μg) cosyntropin and 24-hr urinary free cortisol corrected for creatinine. RESULTS: Data were available for a small number of patients at 13 centers evaluating HPA-axis (Table) . Mean baseline levels and change from baseline to end of study values in low-dose cosyntropin peak serum cortisol levels for CIC and BDP were comparable. Likewise, baseline levels and mean change from baseline to end of study values in 24-hr urinary free cortisol corrected for creatinine were comparable among the two treatment groups. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that CIC 320 to 640 μg daily for 12 months is safe and has no significant effect on HPA-axis function.
