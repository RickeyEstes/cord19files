Expression of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein in cultured cells SARS-CoV spike gene was cloned into pEGFP-N1 with a C-terminal EGFP tag that could be used to monitor protein expression. At 48 h after the transfection, very mild fluorescence was detected in the pEGFP-S transfected HEK 293T cells, while strong fluorescence was observed in the pEGFP-optS transfected cells (Fig. 1A) , which was repeated at least three times but similar results were obtained. To determine the levels of S-EGFP fusion protein expressed in transfected cells, we used convalescent SARS patient sera to detect the fusion protein but obtained very faint bands (data not shown). Therefore, we alternatively employed anti-GFP monoclonal antibody to detect it. Western blot analysis of the cell lysates showed that the S-EGFP fusion protein was expressed at high level in pEGFP-optS transfected cells but at low level in pEGFP-S transfected cells (Fig. 1B) . However, the molecular weight of expressed S-EGFP is larger than the predicted one (about 82 kDa) based on amino acid composition. This may represent glycosylated protein which resulted from posttranslational modification by the eukaryotic expression system. The only difference between the two plasmids was that the plasmid pEGFP-optS contained codon-optimized spike gene utilizing mammalian preferred codons. The data indicated that replacement of codons in the spike gene with those frequently used in mammalian increased S-EGFP fusion protein expression in cultured cells, supporting the hypothesis that the observed differences in efficiency of expression of modified and unmodified spike genes were related to codon usage and GC content, as shown in other studies [21, 22] . The underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated but it is possible that partial optimized codon contained in the spike gene could much more efficiently initiate gene transcription and improve efficiency of gene translation. After all, this transient expression system, transfected with plasmid pEGFP-optS, effectively expresses SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and is suitable for use in the silencing of SARS-CoV S gene expression by siRNA transcribed in vitro.
