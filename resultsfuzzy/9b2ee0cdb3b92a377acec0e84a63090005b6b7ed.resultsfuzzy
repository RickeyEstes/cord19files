Note: A list of the column headings returned by the Proteome Discoverer software is given in Table 1 . Different software (e.g., MSQuant, MaxQuant) will return different headings, however, only a subset of these are required for analysis and these are common to the various software packages. Data should always include an accession number for each protein identified, ratio's comparing each sample ratio (light vs medium, light vs heavy, medium vs heavy etc), the number of unique peptides identified, and some form of false positive rate or confidence indication. 1. Before going through the data, first copy the raw data to a new spreadsheet. From this spreadsheet remove all the columns except those giving the accession number, number of unique peptides, ratios comparing samples, ratio variability, and the protein description. If replica experiments were performed, these should be combined into a single Excel file, with each experiment appearing on a separate tab. Note: Low confidence data includes proteins identified by only a single unique peptide, and those where quantification was not possible. 2. Use Excels' 'sort' function to order the data by the number of peptides and remove the entries for proteins lacking more than one peptide. Then sort by ratio and remove proteins that lack SILAC ratios (unquantified proteins). 3. Convert SILAC ratios to a log 2 values using the formula: '=log(SILAC Ratio,2)', where 'SILAC Ratio' is substituted for the cell identifier. Note: As a SILAC ratio results in any data for proteins showing a decrease in abundance being restricted to values between 0 and 1, it is usual to convert a SILAC ratio to a log 2 SILAC ratio, as this means proteins both increased or decreased in a sample are represented on a log scale where 2 or -2 represents a 4-fold increase or decrease in abundance, and 3 or -3 a 9-fold increase or decrease in abundance respectively. Following this transformation, the data should fit a Gaussian distribution centered around a log 2 SILAC ratio of 0. An example of this is given in Figure 3 . 4. Create new columns in the excel file and calculate log 2 SILAC ratios for all the sample/mock columns. For conversion of a mock/sample ratio to a sample/mock ratio, use the formula: "=1/ratio"  In a typical SILAC pulldown experiment, the vast majority of identified proteins (>90%) represent contaminants as well as proteins binding nonspecifically to the affinity matrix and this is illustrated in Figure 2B , even when washing protocols remove a majority of cytoplasmic contaminants such as GAPDH (Figure 2A) . However, the clustering of non-specifically binding proteins in a normal distribution allows proteins that specifically bind to a protein of interest to be distinguished as these have higher sample/mock ratios than the background. Whilst contaminants should theoretically cluster around a log 2 SILAC ratio of 0, this is not necessarily the case, an example of this is given in Figure 3 . Possible reasons for this include imperfect SILAC labeling of cells, loading unequal volumes or concentrations of lysate onto the anti-GFP beads, accidental loss of beads during purification or unequal mixing of samples at the end of the purification procedure 3 . However, assuming data are analyzed based on a threshold standard deviation from the mean of the normally distributed contaminants, minor shifts in the centering of the data should not affect the quality of the results. When comparing differences in protein interactions between two related proteins, a similar situation may occur where one protein of interest is produced to higher levels within cells than a second (either due to variation in transfection efficiency, or an intrinsic property of the protein or mRNA). Some variation in expression (e.g., Figure 2A ) can be corrected for by analyzing the SILAC ratio for these two samples. In this example these would be the GFP-eIF4AI and GFP-eIF4AII samples. By analyzing the 4AI/4AII SILAC ratio as discussed in section 7, it is possible to identify proteins whose binding varies significantly between isoforms. In Figure 4 , a representation of the eIF4A-binding proteins identified in one of the replica experiments conducted is shown illustrating the coverage of the initiation factor complex this protocol achieved. The highest ratios were typically observed with eIF4G, which binds directly to eIF4A, with lower ratios for eIF4E, which binds to eIF4G at a site away from the eIF4A-binding site. Lower ratios were observed for members of the eIF3 complex. However, this clearly illustrates that the experiment satisfactorily identified both direct and indirect binding partners of eIF4AI and II. As might be expected from their high sequence identity 6 , protein:protein interactions appeared largely conserved between the two isoforms in this experimental system 7, 8 . A selection of some of the interacting proteins are given in Table 2 , illustrating the data format. The total score of a protein (which represents the sum of the individual peptide scores). The exact score required for significance will vary between experiments. A MS facility will usually apply a 5% false discovery rate cutoff.
