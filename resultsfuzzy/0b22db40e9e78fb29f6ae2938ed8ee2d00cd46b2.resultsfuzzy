TEM of phage φ6, NC, and montmorillonite TEM micrographs of φ6 and NC in Figure 1A and B, respectively, reveal a consistency of particle size in the absence of clay that is not affected by uranyl acetate staining. The micrograph in Figure 1A shows~10 2 φ6 virions with diameter 69 AE 2 nm for over 95% of the particles. The vast majority of the virions in Figure 1A exhibit aspect ratios near unity (1.08 AE 0.07), confirming the spherical morphology of the particles. Only two NC particles with diameters of 57 nm (labeled NC in Fig. 1A ) are present in the field of view, confirming that the φ6 envelope rarely spontaneously disassembles. Very few partially disassembled φ6 are visible in the micrograph. Although NC particles are icosahedral, the NC particles appear spherical at the resolution of the Figure 1B micrograph. The vast majority of the NCs in Figure 1B have a diameter of 57 AE 2 nm and aspect ratios near unity (1.05 AE 0.02). Therefore, size and aspect ratio clearly distinguish intact φ6 and NCs and can be used to gauge morphological changes in the virions as a result of interactions with suspended MMT. Figure 2 shows a representative TEM micrograph of MMT platelets. The clay platelets exhibit a sheet-like structure (platelet face) which in the TEM aggregate results in a mosaic of sharp angular forms with discrete edges. The arrow in Figure 2 indicates parallel edges which is indicative of platelet stacking. The platelet faces exhibit a mottled texture and lack geometric characteristics similar to those of viral particles.
