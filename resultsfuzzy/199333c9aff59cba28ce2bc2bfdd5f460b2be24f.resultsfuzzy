Before the study of bioaerosol removal, we measured concentrations of various gaseous species generated from our DBD reactor. Fig. 4 shows the optical emission spectra of the DBD plasma produced at a voltage and residence time of 7.5 kV and 0.24 s, respectively. The spectra in the presence of bioaerosols in the DBD reactor were similar to those in the absence of the bioaerosols. [29] [30] [31] . The reactive species O, O 3 , OH, NO, and NO 2 have been reported to oxidize cell membranes, protein molecules, and DNA [6, 32] . Our results were similar to those of Mahoney et al. [33] , who reported the results of electrical and spectral characterization of air plasma generated by a capillary dielectric barrier discharge (Cap-DBD), consisting of metal wire electrodes inside quartz capillary tubes powered with a high-voltage AC power supply. The plasma reactor was operated in atmospheric-pressure air. In their study, optical emission spectroscopy (OES) was also employed to evaluate the reactive species generated in the plasma source. In addition to OES measurements, we measured NO x and O 3 concentrations produced by our DBD reactor using a real-time gas analyzer and an O 3 monitor, respectively. Fig. 5 shows the results for various applied voltages. The NO 2 and O 3 concentrations were 60.6-74.7 and 25.8-38.1 ppm, respectively. Higher applied voltages led to higher concentrations of NO 2 and O 3 because it became statistically more likely that N 2 and O 2 would be attacked by electrons. According to Pekárek [34] , the initial steps in the formation of NO 2 and O 3 are the dissociation of N 2 and O 2 by electrons. The number of generated electrons is proportional to the applied current, which is also proportional to the applied voltage. Therefore, NO 2 and O 3 concentrations are proportional to the applied voltage. In this study, NO was observed using a spectrometer, however it was not detected by the gas analyzer (the detection limit for NO concentration is about 1 ppm). The spectrometer detects light emitted by NO molecules during their transition from an excited state to a lower energy state, while the final products of molecules from chemical kinetics are measured downstream by the gas analyzer. Hackam and Akiyama [35] , Ruan et al. [36] , and Wang et al. [37] presented that NO produced by plasma can be removed via the following reactions: where M is a third body, which can be N 2 or O 2 . Therefore, from our results obtained using the spectrometer and the gas analyzer, we expect that NO produced by plasma was changed to NO 2 or N 2 before entering the gas analyzer. The ion concentration (N ion ) generated from the DBD reactor was estimated using the following equation [18] : where I is the current, e is the elementary charge of an electron (1.6 × 10 −19 C), ion is the mobility of air ions, E is the electric field strength, A is the inner surface of the ground-electrode, V is the voltage, and d is the gap spacing between electrodes. To calculate Eq. (6), we assumed that the mobilities ( ion ) were 1.1 and 1.9 cm 2 /V s for positive and negative air ions, respectively [38] . We inserted the maximum absolute current values (I max ) as I in Eq. (6) for obtaining the maximum air ion concentrations. The maximum concentrations of positive and negative air ions for 7.5 kV were 4.09 × 10 11 and 2.08 × 10 11 ions/cm 3 , respectively. The reason that the concentration of positive air ions was higher than that of negative air ions is the higher mobility of positive air ions. Our results were similar to those of Byeon et al. [39] . When the units of concentration were converted to ppm, the range of the maximum air ion concentration was 0.0083-0.0164 ppm, which was approximately 1/3100-1/2300 the value of the ozone concentration (25.8-38.1 ppm). However, according to Vaze et al. [15] , the bacterial inactivation efficiency is not high if only ozone exists without other reactive species. They reported that the reduction of E. coli bioaerosols exposed to DBD was 97% for 10 s of exposure time, but the reduction of E. coli bioaerosols exposed to ozone (concentration: 28 ppm; exposure time: 10 s) was only 10%. After characterization of our plasma reactor, one-pass removal tests of bioaerosols were then carried out for various residence times and applied voltages. Applying high air flow rates, three different residence times of 0.12, 0.16, and 0.24 s, were selected. These plasma treatments were much shorter than 1 s, as in Liang et al. [13] and Gallagher et al. [14] . Figs. 6 and 7 show Á CFU , Á Number , and Á Inactivation of bioaerosols as functions of voltage and residence time, respectively. These efficiencies increased as the applied voltage or residence time increased. Because the amplitude of oscillation of bioaerosols in a DBD reactor and the particle charging increased as the applied voltage increased, a higher applied voltage led to higher collection efficiencies. With a particle mobility, b p , electric field strength, E, and excitation frequency, ω, the maximum particle displacement, l max , is (2b p E)/ω [40] and the electric field strength, E, is proportional to the applied voltage. Longer residence times and higher applied voltages increased the chance of bioaerosols being attacked by ions, ozone, or atomic oxygen, which resulted in higher inactivation efficiencies. Efficiencies Á CFU , Á Number , and Á Inactivation of up to 94%, 64%, and 83%, respectively, were obtained for an applied voltage of 7.5 kV and a residence time of 0.24 s. Liang et al. [13] and Gallagher et al. [14] also obtained more than 90% efficiency based on CFUs for removing bioaerosols for plasma treatment times under 1 s. Fig. 8 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of S. epidermidis precipitated on the DBD plate with and without plasma treatment. It is apparent that S. epidermidis suffered severe membrane rupture during the plasma treatment. The performance of a DBD reactor can also be evaluated using specific input energy (SIE). SIE was calculated with the following relation [41] : While the UV susceptibility constant has been widely used to quantify the effect of UV light on microorganisms in the study of UV systems [42, 43] , in this study the SIE susceptibility constant is suggested as a quantitative parameter for the estimation of the ability to remove bioaerosols by collection and inactivation processes in the DBD reactor. The SIE susceptibility constants of collection and inactivation processes, Z Number and Z Inactivation , respectively, are defined by the following equations: The SIE susceptibility constant for the combined effect of collection and inactivation processes, Z CFU , is defined by the following equation: The values of Z CFU , Z Number , and Z Inactivation were 0.00781, 0.00325, and 0.00456 L/J, respectively (Fig. 9 ). In Fig. 9 , the curve fits to experimental results are represented by R 2 values of 0.8580, 0.7468, and 0.8212 for 1 − Á CFU , 1 − Á Number , and 1 − Á Inactivation , respectively. The Z Inactivation value was larger than the Z Number value, indicating that the effect of inactivation is larger than the effect of physical collection for removing bioaerosols with our DBD reactor. In Liang et al. [13] and Gallagher et al. [14] , the efficiencies based on the number of CFUs for removing B. subtilis bioaerosols and E. coli bioaerosols were 98 and 97% under 115.2 and 102.84 J/L, respectively. If these efficiencies are converted to susceptibility constants suggested in this paper, the susceptibility constants become 0.0340 and 0.0341 L/J, respectively, for Liang et al. [13] and Gallagher et al. [14] , which are four-fold higher than the CFU-based susceptibility constant of our DBD reactor, 0.0078 L/J. Therefore, it should be noted that the susceptibility constants introduced so far cannot be directly used for comparing the performance of DBD reactors whose dimensions are different from each other. The removal efficiency increases as plasma treatment time increases, and plasma treatment time increases with the volume of the plasma reactor. For example, the volumes of the reactor used in Liang et al. [13] and Gallagher et al. [14] were 0.026 and 0.025 L, respectively, while our reactor volume was 0.008 L. Therefore, if the same flow rate were used, the removal efficiency using a larger DBD reactor will be higher than that of a smaller DBD reactor, resulting in a higher susceptibility constant for the bigger DBD reactor. For comparing the performance of DBD reactors of different sizes, the modified susceptibility constant is introduced as follows: Using Eq. (13), Z of our DBD reactor was 0.9763 J −1 , which is similar to 1.3061 J −1 for Liang et al. [13] and 1.3639 J −1 for Gallagher et al. [14] . So far, the modified susceptibility constant has been successfully demonstrated for performance evaluation of DBD reactors of different sizes under different DBD operating conditions. Our methodology will be used for design optimization, performance evaluation, and prediction of power consumption of DBD systems for industrial applications.
