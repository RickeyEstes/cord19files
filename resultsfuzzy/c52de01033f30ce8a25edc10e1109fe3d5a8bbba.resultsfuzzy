The learners' individual scores of the composition ratings for Hamp-Lyons' (1991) measures are shown in Table 1 . To compare each of the learners' pre-planned and nonpre-planned compositions written in the in-class and homework situations respectively, I calculated the differences between the compositions. As Table 2 shows, Chie and Miho's scores in composition 3 were better than those in composition 1 in all rating categories, whilst Yuri's scores in those in-class compositions showed no obvious differences. The degree of differences in the in-class compositions varied among the rating categories, as well as among the learners. For example, the organisation scores of the pre-planned compositions were considerably better than those of the non-pre-planned compositions in both Chie (3.0) and Miho's (2.0) cases; however, those in the linguistic accuracy measures showed relatively small differences among the six rating categories. In the homework situations, all the learners' scores showed only minor or no differences between the preplanned and non-pre-planned compositions across the rating categories. Table 3 shows the composition ratings in the accuracy, complexity and fluency measures. As Table 4 indicates, the differences in scores between the compositions written with and without the pre-task planning activities showed distinct tendencies in the measures used in this phase of analysis. All the complexity measures, for example, showed the students' better performance in both in-class and homework compositions when they drew concept maps to plan their writing. Among the three learners, Miho performed the best in the overall complexity measures in both in-class and homework situations. In terms of fluency, all the learners performed better in the pre-planned than non-pre-planned compositions when they wrote in class. Moreover, a similar tendency was observed in Chie and Global 5.5 6.5 8.0 6.0 5.5 5.0 6.0 5.0 6.5 6.0 6.0 6.5 Communicative 5.5 7.0 8.0 6.5 5.5 5.5 6.5 4.5 6.0 6.5 6.0 6.5 Organization 5.0 6.5 8.0 7.0 4.5 5.0 6.5 4.0 6.0 6.5 6.0 6.0 Argumentation 5.5 7.0 7.5 7.0 5.5 5.0 6.0 4.5 5.5 6.5 6.5 6.0 Linguistic accuracy 5.0 6.0 7.0 6.0 5.5 6.0 6.0 5.5 6.0 6.0 6.0 6.5 Linguistic appropriacy 5.0 6.0 7.0 6.0 5.5 5.5 6.5 5.5 6.0 6.0 6.5 6.5 Note. Judgments were made on 9-point scales. C1 = no pre-task planning, in-class composition. C2 = no pre-task planning, homework composition. C3 = +pre-task planning, in-class composition. C4 = +pre-task planning, homework composition. Miho's homework compositions, but not in Yuri's. Chie especially wrote longer compositions using a greater variety of words when she pre-planned and composed in class. The overall accuracy measures showed no clear differences between the pre-planned and non-pre-planned compositions in either in-class or homework situations. Chie produced more grammatical error-free clauses when she pre-planned for composing in class, but this tendency did not appear in the homework situations. Miho's accuracy scores in the preplanned compositions were even lower than those in the non-pre-planned compositions. Note. C1 = no pre-task planning, in-class composition, C2 = no pre-task planning, homework composition, C3 = +pre-task planning, in-class composition, C4 = +pre-task planning, homework composition. 14 a C3-C1 = the raw score of composition 3 minus the raw score of composition 1. b C4-C2 = the raw score of composition 4 minus the raw score of composition 2. Yuri performed slightly better in the pre-planned scores of lexical error-free clause, but no obvious differences were observed in the other accuracy measures.
