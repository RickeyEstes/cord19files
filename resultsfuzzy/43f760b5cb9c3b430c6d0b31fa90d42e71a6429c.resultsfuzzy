In addition to estimating the reproduction number of COVID-19 across Iran, we further analyzed the data 47 for Region 1 and Region 3 of Iran, which happened to have higher numbers of cumulative number of cases For Region 1, using Method 1, we estimated a reproduction number of 3.6 (95% CI: 3.1, 4.4) with a growth 54 rate of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.89) and a scaling parameter of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.99). Using Method 2, 55 the estimated epidemic doubling time was 1.29 (95% CI, 1.10, 1.61) and the estimated reproduction number 56 was 3.40 (95% CI, 1.27, 7.91) ( It appeared that whether it was for Iran as a whole, or for its Region 1 or Region 3, the point estimate of the 62 .
