The targets-pathways-diseases interaction profile of YPF decoction. YPF decoction consists of three herbs and a total of 352 compounds, which were collected with PubChem CID and they belonged to flavonoids, saponins, saccharides, and volatile components (including phenylpropanoids, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, and triterpenes). The rapid development of bioinformatics and computational sciences has provided a wide range of approaches for targets prediction of small molecules 24 . In this study, the putative targets of compounds were identified based on the similarity ensemble approach (SEA: http://sea.bkslab.org/) 25 . The potential targets of 250 compounds were successfully predicted by the SEA, with a total of 968 protein targets. (A worth-mentioning issue is about the high amount of 968 potential "targets" of YPF decoction, especially in terms of the relative small target pool of SEA. We tried to narrow the scope of potential "targets" of YPF decoction by setting up a pre-enrichment filter based on Tc threshold value. In this way, the number of "targets" for enrichment analysis sharply decreases from 968 to 304. However, the results of the most-important potential therapeutic targets and potential active compounds of YPF have no obvious changes. Thus, we still chose the post-enrichment filtering strategy, considering the advantage of this strategy with more informative reference to alternative targets. Throughout this paper, the term "targets" refers to the putative proteins to which the ingredients from YPF decoction directly bind, according to SEA predictions; however, it is not known whether targets are responsible for the therapeutic effect of YPF decoction. The term "therapeutic targets" refers to partial proteins from targets that have been identified to be responsible for the therapeutic effect of YPF decoction by our novel NP-based method.) Then, the target-pathway interactions were generated to elucidate the biological pathways that YPF decoction might impact; moreover, the overrepresented KEGG pathways of the predicted 968 protein targets of YPF were identified from enrichment analysis. A total of 132 highly related pathways with 549 relevant protein targets were obtained. Please refer to supplementary dataset for more detailed information about the compounds (Supplementary Table S1 ), putative targets (Supplementary Table S2 ) and relevant pathways (Supplementary  Table S3) . To understand what role the enriched pathways might play from a therapeutic angle, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 26 (KEGG; http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html) was used to identify the diseases with which each pathway might be involved. Since each pathway might participate in various bioprocesses in vivo, it is also possible that each pathway could be relevant to multi-diseases, and that each disease might be contributed to by multi-pathways. Next, a total of 43 diseases that the 132 pathways might impact were retrieved from the KEGG database to create the pathways-diseases interaction. Finally, the targets-pathways-diseases interaction profile of YPF decoction was generated. (Throughout this paper, the term "diseases" refers to the disease category of the diseases relevant to the pathways. Please refer to Supplementary Table S4 for detailed information about the pathways-diseases relationship.)
