Next, an econometric approach, panel data models is applied to investigating the specific quantitative correlation between regional economic integration and CO 2 marginal abatement cost as it provides a approciate way to examine the individual and time individual effects (Wooldridge, 2015) .. The better to search for an optimal model, the method of adding control variables one-by-one is followed (Du et al., 2015a) (Table 3) . In general, Hausman test should be applied to determining whether the effects of individuals and time are fixed or random. Nevertheless, this study directly employs the fixed effects models of individual and time to estimate the regression Eq. (11). The reasons are two-fold. On the one hand, as the sample periods in this study are not enough long, random effect model is easy to ensure the effectiveness of estimation, but difficult to guarantee the consistency of estimation. On the contrary, the fixed effect model could better guarantee the consistency. On the other hand, in the theory of econometrics, consistency of estimation is a more important principle in relative to effectiveness of estimation, particularly in the relatively small sample estimation. In addition, as regional economic integration is actually correlated to the position, economic level of the provinces, fixed effect model is indeed a more appreciate approach. A similar manner could also be found in Du et al. (2015a Du et al. ( , 2015b and Hao and Peng (2017) . Following the estimation approach of fixed effect models, the regression results, as well as the values of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and adjusted R 2 , are summarised in Table 4 . The AIC index is a widely used model section criterion as the best control variables cannot be pre-determined before regression. Smaller values for AIC are preferred since their calculation is based on the in-sample fitness of the regression (Du et al., 2015a (Du et al., , 2015b . Adjusted R 2 measures the goodness of data fitting. Without including any control variables in model 1, we find that the coefficient of ln(ln(REI)) is not significant, which implies that regional economic integration cannot totally interpret the increase of marginal abatement cost of CO 2 emissions. By controlling variables CO 2 emissions intensity, urban level, composition of industry, environmental regulation and energy consumption structure in Models 2 to 6, the regression coefficients of ln(ln(REI)) is significantly positive at 5% significance level, which imply that the evolution of regional economic integration partially contributes to the increase of MAC of CO 2 emissions. In addition, these models also show a relatively stable relationship between regional economic integration and marginal abatement cost as the coefficients of ln(ln(REI)) in Models 2 to 6 ranged from 0.203 to 0.224. Therefore, we can conclude that the evolution of REI indeed contributes the increase of CO 2 marginal abatement cost. In the process of regional economic integration, goods, labour, capital, advanced technology, and management philosophy flow among provinces. Meanwhile, the evolution of REI stimulates the reallocation of resource and energy, which is conducive to the improvement of carbon emissions efficiency. Consequently, the evolution of REI contributes to the improvement of carbon emissions efficiency and technological progress, resulting in the increase of MAC of CO 2 emissions. Earlier studies have shown a positive relationship exists between CO 2 emissions performance and marginal abatement cost, while Li and Lin (2017) also conclude that CO 2 emissions performance benefits from the evolution of regional economic integration. These two important conclusions could also provide indirect evidence for the results of this study. In addition to regional economic integration, the impact of other control variables on marginal abatement cost could also be found in  Note: EN_REGU 2 = EN_REGU* EN_REGU. a √ refers to the included variables. Table 5 . Specifically, the coefficient of urbanisation level and environmental regulation are also positive at the 5% significance level, which imply that marginal abatement cost will increase with the evolution of urbanisation level and increase of the share of environmental control investment. Their effect on the MAC of CO 2 emissions could be interpreted as follows: the increase in level of urbanisation implies social progress, thereafter, rural labours flow into cities, which could generate more jobs, contributing to the improvement of labour productivity and GDP growth. Both of these will induce an increase in the MAC of CO 2 emissions. As discussed in Section 4.3.1, environmental regulation may affects MAC positively or nagatively. The significantly positive coefficient indicates that the positive influence is greater than the negative influence. Therefore, the increase in environmental regulation will induce an increase in MAC. It is worth mentioning that the square of environmental regulation significantly contributes to MAC of CO 2 emissions, which indicates that the influence of environmental regulation on MAC will be larger and larger with the increase of share of environment control investment. On the contrary, the coefficients of the carbon intensity, and industrial structure are negative at the 1% or 5% significance level, ranging from −1.869 to −1.523, and − 1.220 to 1.180 respectively. As discussed in Section 2.1 and 4.3.1, technological progress is one of the main sources of marginal abatement cost change, and CO 2 emissions intensity reflects the technology level to some extent. Negative coefficient of CO 2 emissions intensity at 1% significant level provides the strong evidence that technological progress is one of the main sources of MAC increase. As another main source of marginal abatement cost change, economic structure also negatively influences the marginal abatement cost of CO 2 emissions according to the regression results. With the increase of share of heavy industry, typified as high emissions and low efficiency, CO 2 abatement potential increases and therefore the marginal abatement cost of CO 2 emissions falls. Note that in our results, energy consumption structure doesn't significantly influence the MAC of CO 2 emissions. The main reason is that the dependent variable is the logarithm of MAC to overcome the heteroscedasticity. According to the last two rows of Table 6 , Model 6 is the best model regarding choice of control variable and data fitting. It is worth noting that regional economic integration presents a downtrend over the two periods, while the MAC of CO 2 emissions increases steadily over the sampled periods. The phenomenon is easy to understand: in our opinion, regional economic integration is not the only reason for the increasing MAC. The main reason for the increased MAC is technical progress, including the application of energy conservation and carbon abatement technology, which improve the carbon emissions efficiency and reduce the potential for carbon abatement. Regional economic integration just accelerates technical progress. Overall, these key findings suggest that regional economic integration should be further encouraged, as it actually stimulates the decrease of potential for CO 2 abatement, and technological progress.
