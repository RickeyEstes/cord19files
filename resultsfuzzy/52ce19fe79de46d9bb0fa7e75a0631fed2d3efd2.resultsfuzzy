II) Similarity analysis showed that a significant number of isolates have the same length (29727 bases), the same beginning and ending subsequences (that seem to be exact starts and ends of the complete SARS-CoV genome up to the poly-"a" at the 3' end), thus forming a kind of referent group; these are the isolates TWH, TWC3, TWK, TWS, TWY, Urbani, Frankfurt 1 ( Figure 1 ). The fully sequenced isolate TWH then has been chosen as the referent isolate for sequence comparisons since its average number of SNPs compared to other isolates is the smallest. For example, TWH and Urbani have an average number of SNPs 15.7 and 17.6 respectively for all the isolates, and 5.7 and 10.5 respectively for the referent group. For SNPs see the tables in the additional files 1 and 2. III) Most isolates, compared to TWH, are shorter at the 5'end (e.g., Sin2500, Sin2679, Sin2774, Sin2677, Sin2748, AS), have various length poly-"a" strings at the 3' end (e.g., Tor2, HSR1, FRA, BJ02, TW1, HKU-39489, WHU), or both (BJ01, BJ03, BJ04, CUHK-W1, CUHK-Su10). Three of the isolates, Taiwan TC1, Taiwan TC2, Taiwan TC3, have both starting and ending deletions (at the 5' end 69, at the 3' end 85 nucleotides). Several isolates (e.g. TWJ, TWC, Sin2677, Sin2748) have some short deletions inside the sequence ( Figure 1 ). IV) There is a group of isolates that have significant length insertions (29 nucleotides) inside the sequence. These are the isolates GD01, SZ3, SZ16. A significant number of individual insertions have been identified in ZJ01 and ZMY 1 isolates ( Figure 1 , additional files 3,4,5). Among the SNP contents of isolates, there is a significant difference in the number of SNPs for different pairs of isolates. For TWH as the referent isolate, this number varies from 1 to 80 SNPs. Isolates may be classified into three groups based on the number of SNPs with TWH ( Figure  2 ): 1. with less than 15 (TWC3, TWK, TWS, TWY, Urbani,  TWJ, TWC, TW1 Finally, besides the number, there are differences in positions of SNPs (potential mutation sites). In order to avoid nucleotide changes that probably arose during propagation of the virus in cell culture and sequencing, Figure 3 represents positions (on the relative scale of all isolates and on TWH scale) where two or more SNPs occurred, not taking into consideration isolates with long insertions (GD01, SZ3 and SZ16). The positions of multiple SNPs of these three isolates, similar as far as these three are concerned, are highly different from all the others and are represented in Figure 4 . These results coincide with those published in Marra et al's paper [4] for Urbani and Tor2 isolates, but differ from those published in Ruan's paper [8] for the 14 isolates therein analyzed (Sin-group, BJgroup, Tor2, Urbani, CUHK-W1, HKU-39849, GD01), which were obviously based on different revisions of the PubMed NCBI Entrez database [9] ;
