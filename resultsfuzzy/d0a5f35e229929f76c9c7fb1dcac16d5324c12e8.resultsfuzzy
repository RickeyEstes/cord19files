We began by exploring whether the 2-strain dynamics observed in the Shantou wLBM surveillance data could be reproduced by autochthonous transmission (sustained transmission without importation). We seeded each strain for five days once only, where a fixed proportion (0.4) of birds came into the market in the I state for this time period, while the remaining birds were imported in the S state. Comparing the results of the simulation with a single five day seed to the surveillance data ( Figure S8 ), autochthonous transmission alone was unable to ensure that the regular outbreaks observed in the data were generated in the simulation. Therefore we explored whether random periods of seeding and non-seeding times could better replicate the observed dynamics. evaluated, as we note some models performed well across several summary statistics but poorly across 1, resulting in the intersection across all 4 statistics being equal to 0. Overall for models 5-10 we saw a very poor intersection between summary statistics across all combinations evaluated.
