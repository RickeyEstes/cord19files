The results of the analysis of 20 archived human samples are shown in Table 2 . The RIME LAMP assay detected all T. b. rhodesiense in blood, CSF supernatant and unprocessed serum, while it failed to detect two samples of T. b. gambiense DNA. There was 100% agreement in LAMP test replicates. The TBR PCR only detected 5/18 samples while specific PCR tests gave negative results. The RIME LAMP assay was specific and no amplification was recorded with DNA or supernatant prepared from CSF and blood of non-infected humans.
