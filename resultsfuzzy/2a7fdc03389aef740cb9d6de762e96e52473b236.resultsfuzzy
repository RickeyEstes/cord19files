Of the 564 samples tested, 283 (50.2%) were positive for at least one virus (Table 1) with influenza viruses (Flu A:~15%; Flu B:~9%), rhinoviruses (hRV) (~8%), coronaviruses E229&OC43 (hCoV E229&OC43) (~5%) and respiratory syncytial virus hRSV (~4%) being the most frequently identified. The pattern of viral infections varied according to age groups ( Figure 1A ). The elucidation rate was the highest (>60%) in samples from patients under the age of 10 yo and the lowest (<40%) in patients ≥60 yo (Figures 1A and B) . Since all samples originated from symptomatic patients, this may be due either to the higher prevalence of the viruses tested or to the higher level of viral shedding in children. The 0-4 yo age group displayed specific epidemiological characteristics with the majority of hRSV infections (infection rate: 23.19%) and a remarkably low proportion of influenza infections: <7.5% compared with~38% in the 5-9 yo age group,~26.5% in the 10-59 yo age classes and~16% in those ≥60 yo. Adenoviruses were most frequently identified in children under the age of 10, bocaviruses in patients under the age of 20 and hCoV E229 & OC43, although present in all age groups, were more prevalent in patients ≥40 yo. Interestingly, metapneumoviruses (hMPV) were detected in both children and adults with the most elevated rate of infection in the ≥60 yo age group (~5%) and enteroviruses/parechoviruses were also found in both children and adults. Rhinoviruses were identified in all age groups (up to~10% in patient over 60 years of age). Nearly 3% of samples showed dual viral infections ( Table 1 ): 8 (9.4%) of the 85 influenza A viruses, 5 (11.4%) of the 44 rhinoviruses and 5 (17.8%) of the 28 hCoV E229&OC43 infections detected were diagnosed in a situation of co-infection. Co-infections were specifically frequent in the case of adenoviruses (38.9%). Despite a high number of influenza B cases (50) no co-infection was noted. The rate of dual infections was high for bocaviruses and enteroviruses/parechoviruses (≥40%) and low for metapneumoviruses and parainfluenzaviruses (<10%) but this was based on a limited number of cases. The median age was not different in patients with single or dual infections. The curve of positive samples followed that of samples tested ( Figure 2B ) and that of samples received at CENETROP (Figure 2A ). Peaks of detection matched peaks of reception of samples, which globally followed the seasonal subtropical pattern of ILIs observed in Bolivia, with one peak during the austral autumn and a second during the austral winter season. In 2010, a great number of samples could be studied (257) allowing to precisely follow several peaks of activity corresponding to a mosaic of viruses including Flu B, hRSV, hRV, Flu A A/H3N2 and A (H1N1)pdm09 and hCoV E229&OC43. In 2011 and 2012, the number of samples studied annually was lower (163 and 144, respectively), but still sufficient to elucidate the main peaks of activity with a major incidence of Flu A (H1N1)pdm09 in 2011 and Flu B in 2012, co-circulating with a variety of other viruses (see Figure 2C ). Epidemiological peaks were generally associated with a predomin- This is summarised in Figure 1C that shows a clear epidemiological evolution. In 2010, following the 2009 Flu A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic wave, influenza A infections were for the most part due to Flu A/H3N2 and associated to a large number of Flu B and rhinovirus infections and a variety of less prevalent viruses. By contrast, year 2011 was characterised by the massive come back of Flu A(H1N1)pdm09, the low number of Flu B, the emergence of a large number of hCoV E229&OC43 infections and the absence of hRSV infections. In 2012, the situation changed again with a large number of Flu B and hRSV infections and the persistence of a significant proportion of rhinovirus and Flu A(H1N1)pdm09 infections. Altogether, this provides a striking picture of a moving infection pattern, which is presumably modelled by the herd immunity in the most epidemiologically susceptible populations. The complete disappearance of hRSV infections in 2011 represents a specific case that was never encountered by the authors in Europe.
