We perform numerical Monte Carlo simulations on uncorrelated heterogeneous networks to validate the theoretical findings in Section 3. The networks are generated with the UCM (uncorrelated configuration model) [36] based on the Molloy-Reed algorithm [37] . Two networks are generated for these simulations: the first network has V = 1000 nodes with degree distribution P(k) ∼ k −3 (2 ≤ k ≤ V 1/2 ) characterized by the first moment ⟨k⟩ = 2.86 and the second moment ⟨k 2 ⟩ = 11.16, respectively. The second network has V = 2000 nodes with degree distribution P(k) ∼ k −2.5 (2 ≤ k ≤ V 1/2 ), and the first and second moments are ⟨k⟩ = 3.6 and ⟨k 2 ⟩ = 23.8, respectively. In order to reduce the influence of random factors on the simulation results, each simulation result shown in the figures is averaged over 20 independent realizations of different initial infected individuals. At the initial time step, all individuals are randomly distributed in the nodes. In Fig. 1 , we report the simulation results for the normalized stationary average infection density as a function of the population density in the network with ω 1 and ω 2 equal to 0 or 1. We can see from ⟨k 2 ⟩ = 0.73 (wherein the parameters are β = 0.1, µ = 0.1, ⟨k⟩ = 2.86, and ⟨k 2 ⟩ = 11.16) regardless of whether mobility rates are changed or not (i.e., ω 1 = ω 2 = 0 or ω 1 ̸ = 0 or (and) ω 2 ̸ = 0). So this validates the theoretical prediction with respect to the epidemic threshold. Fig. 1(b) shows the simulation results obtained for the second network with β = 0.1 and µ = 0.2. Obviously, the simulated values of the threshold are all almost equal to the analytical value ρ c = 1.08 calculated according to the given parameters (i.e., β = 0.1, µ = 0.2, ⟨k⟩ = 3.6, and ⟨k 2 ⟩ = 23.8). So, similarly, this simulation can support the conclusion that the time-varying human mobility pattern cannot alter the epidemic threshold. In order to further validate the finding with respect to the epidemic threshold in a more general condition that 0 < ω 1 < 1 and 0 < ω 2 < 1, we report the simulated epidemic threshold ρ c as a function of parameters ω 1 and ω 2 in Fig. 2 . It can be found that the epidemic thresholds still approximate to 7.3 for the first network (see Fig. 2(a) ) and 1.08 for the second network (see Fig. 2(b) ), respectively, although they have some slight fluctuations. This further proves that the time-varying mobility pattern does not alter the epidemic threshold, regardless of whether ω 1 is equal to ω 2 or not. To emphasize the impacts of the time variation of human mobility rates on epidemic behavior when ρ > ρ c , we compare the simulated results in two typical cases of ω 1 = ω 2 = 0 (not considering time variation of human mobility rates) and ω 1 = ω 2 = 1 (time-varying human mobility rates). In the following, for convenience, we denote the former case as the Case I pattern and the latter as the Case II pattern. In Fig. 3 , we show the normalized stationary average infection density ρ I /ρ and relative difference in ρ I /ρ (see the insert) versus the total density of individuals ρ when ρ > ρ c . It can be seen that the stationary infection density in the Case II pattern is always less than that of the Case I pattern irrespective of the ρ value. This means that the time-varying mobility pattern can slightly mitigate the global epidemic spreading as a whole. Moreover, we also find that, in a certain range of ρ (e.g., 5 ≤ ρ ≤ 15 in Fig. 1(a) and 2 ≤ ρ ≤ 18 in Fig. 1(b) ), the value of ρ I /ρ in the Case II pattern is significantly lower than that in the Case I pattern, whereas such difference is very small if parameter ρ does not lie in this range. The main reason for the occurrence of this phenomenon can be explained as follows. On the one hand, when the value of ρ is too small, each node has on average very few individuals. In such a case, a mobility rate change can hardly alter the total average number of contacts. On the other hand, the larger the density of individuals ρ is, the more individuals move among the nodes, and the faster the infected individuals move to most nodes. Once most nodes have infected individuals, decreasing the mobility rate cannot effectively affect the epidemic prevalence in the stationary state. Furthermore, we show the distribution of ρ S,k with respect to degree k in Fig. 4 . It is easy to see from Fig. 4 (a)-(d) that there always exists a common point at which the ρ S,k values are equal for the two patterns, regardless of the ρ value. Here, we denote the nodes' degree corresponding to the common point as the critical degree k c . For nodes with degree smaller/larger than k c , the relative density of susceptible individuals ρ S,k of the Case II pattern is higher/lower than that of Case I pattern. Moreover, it is noticed that the equation ρ S,k + ρ I,k = kρ/⟨k⟩ is always satisfied for these two cases. So we can derive that the relative density of infected individuals ρ I,k of the Case II pattern is lower/higher than that of the Case I pattern for nodes with degree smaller/larger than ρ c . This means that k c is a critical threshold with respect to the node degree separating the positive impacts from the negative impacts on epidemic mitigation. This phenomenon can be understood as follows. The nodes with higher degree have more individuals, and this is convenient for epidemic spreading inside those nodes. So the infection densities in the stationary state are higher than those in nodes with lower degree nodes. Compared with the Case I pattern, the Case II pattern can decrease the number of individuals moving among nodes. This will restrain, in some sense, the percolation of infected individuals from high infection density nodes to low ones. In the following, we try to obtain the theoretical value of the threshold k c . In fact, from Eqs. (11) and (12), we can get the expressions of ρ S,k for the Case I pattern and the Case II pattern, respectively. Letting the two expressions be equal, one can derive k c as (see the Appendix for details) where η 1 and η 2 are normalized average infected densities ρ I /ρ for the Case I pattern and the Case II pattern, respectively. From Fig. 2 , we know that η 2 is always less than η 1 and tends to η 1 when ρ is sufficiently large, which leads to a decrease of the k c value. In the extreme case that η 1 = η 2 , the minimum value of k c is derived: k min c = ⟨k 2 ⟩ ⟨k⟩ . So, we can get k c approximately by using k min c when ρ is sufficiently large (η 2 ≈ η 1 ). That is, From the given network parameters, we have the theoretical value of k c = k min c = 3.9 for the first network. It can be seen from Fig. 4 that the simulated values of k c are all greater than 3.9. Moreover, these simulated values of k c approach 3.9 when ρ increases. This agrees well with the theoretical results. In particular, we have ⟨k 2 ⟩ = ⟨k⟩ 2 for homogeneous networks; thus k c ≈ ⟨k⟩ from Eq. (23) . This means that our pattern has the same effect on the final infected density for all nodes in such networks. This deduction agrees with our intuitive judgment.
