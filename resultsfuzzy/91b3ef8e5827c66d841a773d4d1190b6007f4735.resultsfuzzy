Representative differentially expressed genes from different functional groups including chemokine (CXCL8, CCL20, CXCL3), anti-apoptotic (BCL2A1), transcription factors (FOSL1, JUN, and EGR1) and signal transduction mediators (DUSP6 and GNB4) were selected to further validate by qRT-PCR. The expression profiles of the IFN genes including IFN-β, Il29 (IFN-λ1), and IL28 (IFN-λ2/λ3) were further evaluated using qRT-PCR. Universal Probe Library (Roche: https://lifescience.roche.com/) was used to design primers and probes ( Table 1 ). In order to estimate PCR efficiency, standard curves were derived from 5×serial dilutions for all genes. The slop of standard curves was used to calculate PCR efficiency. The quantification was performed using LightCycler 480 Instrument II and LightCycler LC480 software version LCS480 1.5.0.39 under following settings: 95˚C for 10 min denaturation followed by 45 cycles of 95˚C for 10 sec, annealing at 60˚C for 30 sec, 72˚C for 30 sec. Comparative results were calculated and the expression of genes were normalized to the GAPDH in all samples at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hpi. The amplified products were further analyzed by agarose gel and also subjected to the melting curve analysis (65 to 95˚C) at the end of the experiment to determine the specificity of the primers.
