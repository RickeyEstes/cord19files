The number of positive samples for each viral agent investigated, is shown in Table 2 . In 39/ 400 samples (9.75%) more than one pathogen was detected. The identification of Flu A subtypes, RSV and PIV types is based on the results obtained with Allplex. For PIV the results were confirmed on Panther Fusion assay. The TP, TN, FP and FN results obtained by both tests for each of the viruses are shown in Table 3 . Globally, both tests showed excellent sensitivity and specificity values; Panther Fusion had sensitivity values >0.95 for all viral targets, whereas Allplex showed values lower than 0.95 only for detection of hMPV and RV, though still >0.90. For 45 samples (9.8%), there was a discrepancy between the two assays. Allplex detected 11 RV positives that were not detected in Panther Fusion, and only one was confirmed by R-GENE. On the other hand, Panther Fusion detected hMPV in 10 samples that were not positive by Allplex, and only 3 of them were confirmed by R-GENE. Regarding the negative control samples in which no respiratory viruses had been previously identified, Allplex did not detect any viral agent, while Panther Fusion had a false positive result when detecting an AdV that was not confirmed by R-GENE. Six invalid samples were detected in Allplex Panel 1 and one sample in Allplex Panels 2 and 3 (n = 7, 1.73%), while a total of five samples were invalid in the Panther Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV and/or Paraflu (1/2/3/4) panels (n = 5, 1.23%). After discarding all samples with any invalid results, a total of 399 samples were analyzed for Flu A and B, RSV, AdV, hMPV and RV, and 402 samples for PIV. In 20 samples (4.9%), more than 1 virus was detected. The overall results obtained by both primary assays for each virus are shown in Table 4 . The two primary assays showed negative results for all the viruses investigated in 150 samples (37.0%), and discrepant results in 75 samples (18.8%). Regarding sensitivity and specificity, both methodologies yielded high values, ranging from 0.83-1 with good predictive values, although, in general, Panther Fusion tended to be more sensitive. Comparing the viral targets The Allplex assay allowed for some differentiation of the results based on subtype. Of the 67 samples positive for Flu A, 41 were H1pdm09, 28 were H3, and 1 wasn't subtyped. For RSV, 8 were RSV A and 26 were RSV B. In 26 samples (6.5%), Allplex detected other viruses that were not included in the diagnostic capability of Panther Fusion: hCoV OC43 (n = 18), hCoV NL63 (n = 8), hEV (n = 2) and hBoV (n = 13). Finally, discordant results were interpreted by considering the results of the first two assays along with those of the R-GENE assay (Table 7) . Discordant results for all viruses analyzed were found, being more frequent when RV (n = 41 samples), Flu A (n = 21), and hMPV (n = 17) were tested. Regarding the Flu A virus, the discordance for the Allplex assay was not associated with any subtype or with the detection of non-typeable strains. The C t value obtained in both assays was analyzed in the 120 samples with discordant results (Fig 1) Overall, the reference method showed higher agreement with Panther Fusion-positive specimens (negative for Allplex; n = 28, 39.4%) than with Allplex-positive samples (negative for Panther Fusion; n = 7, 14.3%), although this difference was only statistically significant for Flu A (p = 0.04).
