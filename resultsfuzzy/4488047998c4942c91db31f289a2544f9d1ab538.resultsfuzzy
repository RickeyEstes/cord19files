Out of 256 samples, 3 (1.17%) were found to be positive for kobuvirus RNA using the primer set UNIV-kobu-F/ UNIV-kobu-R. By FASTA and BLAST analysis, the 217-bp 3D fragments displayed the closest identity (94.0-96.0% nt) to the CaKV-like sequences available on the databases. A total of six samples (2.34%), included those amplified with the generic primers, were positive to CaKVs, when rescreening the specimens using the specific primer set designed in this study. All CaKV-positive samples were identified from diarrhoeic dogs (6/137), with a prevalence rate of 4.37%. Fecal samples were also tested for the presence of CPV-2 and CCoV. CPV-2 was detected in a total of 34 samples, all collected from animals with gastroenteritis signs (24.8%), while CCoV was found in 35 specimens either from healthy (3.36%) or from symptomatic dogs (22.6%) ( Table 1) . Mixed infections with two pathogens were identified in a total of 8 samples (CaKV + CCoV, n = 1; CPV-2 + CCoV, n = 7) and 3 were positive for all three viruses. CaKV was the single identified enteric virus in two specimens (Table 2) . Upon sequence analysis of the partial 3D region with primers CaKVF/CaKVR, the six strains detected in this study (CaKV/19c/2012 (Kapoor et al., 2011; Li et al., 2011) . Furthermore, a high sequence match (87.0% nt and 92.0% aa identities) was found to a novel kobuvirus (KoV-SewKTM), recently detected in untreated sewage in Nepal (Ng et al., 2012) . Nucleotide identity to the MuKV M5/USA/2010 (Phan et al., 2011) was 83.0% (90.0% aa), while identity to human AiV-like sequences ranged from 79.0% to 80.0% (86.0-89.0% aa). Neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis based on the 460-nt 3D sequences was carried out with a selection of strains representative of the Kobuvirus genus, including KoV-SewKTM (Ng et al., 2012) , MuKV-M5 (Phan et al., 2011) , AiVs and the prototype strains porcine kobuvirus S-1-HUN (Reuter et al., 2008) and bovine kobuvirus U1 (Yamashita et al., 2003) . Based on the inspection of the tree (Fig. 1) , all the Italian sequences formed a tight cluster with the CaKVs recently identified in the US (Kapoor et al., 2011; Li et al., 2011) sharing, in accordance with the pairwise identity detected in the partial 3D gene, a common root with the kobuvirus strain detected in sewage, the murine kobuvirus and AiVs. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which evidence was collected for the occurrence of CaKVs in Italy. Using a combination of generic and specific primers, CaKV strains were identified in a samples collection obtained from young dogs. The novel kobuviruses were detected exclusively in diarrhoeic animals with a prevalence rate similar to that previously found in the US (Li et al., 2011) . In our analysis, the majority of CaKV positive dogs were also infected by other canine pathogens such as CPV-2 or CCoV, whilst single infections by CaKV were detected only in two of the symptomatic animals. These findings are not unexpected, as mixed infections are not infrequent, especially in animal communities such as kennels or shelters. Although these results demonstrated that CaKVs are common viruses of dogs, it is not clear whether they also play a role as enteric pathogens. Furthermore, in the prevalence study performed on a mostly adult canine population of the US, CaKVs was detected by Real Time RT-PCR not only in symptomatic dogs, but even in healthy animals (Li et al., 2011) . Accordingly, experimental infections are necessary to elucidate the pathogenic role of CaKV and to understand whether it can act by itself as a primary causative agent of gastrointestinal disease or whether it can be involved in mechanisms of co-infection with other pathogens, as observed between CCoV and CPV-2 (Appel, 1988; Pratelli et al., 1999b) . Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the partial 3D gene, allowed us to obtain information on the genetic relationship among the various members of the Kobuvirus genus. The six sequences detected in this study revealed little genetic variation in the region analyzed suggesting limited strain heterogeneity of CaKVs. However, further characterization of these strains was not possible, since no other sequence data were obtained, but efforts are presently being made to attempt additional genome information. The close genetic relationship observed among AiVs, MuKV and CaKVs reinforces the notion that the evolution of AiVs is intermingled with that of animal kobuviruses (Phan et al., 2011) and highlights the need to further explore the genetic diversity of these viruses in animals and humans. In conclusion, the findings of this investigation demonstrate that CaKVs are not geographically restricted to the North American continent, where they were first signaled (Kapoor et al., 2011; Li et al., 2011) . Extensive epidemiologic surveillance and comprehensive characterization of these viruses from other geographic areas might help clarify the global distribution, heterogeneity and possible association of CaKV with enteric diseases in dogs. 1 . Phylogenetic tree based on the 460-nt 3D sequence. Phylogenetic tree was generated using the neighbor joining method and kimura-2parameters distance correction, supplying a statistical support with bootstrapping of 1000 replicates. Labels denote CaKV-like sequences detected in the present study. Furthermore, large age-stratified serological investigations are necessary in order to assess precisely the patterns of canine seroprevalence. Finally, given the close genetically relatedness of these novel kobuviruses with AiVs, investigations in humans will be useful to address their zoonotic potential.
