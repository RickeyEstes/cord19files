Lung tissue had no growth on routine bacterial culture and PCR testing for Mycoplasma bovis, Mannehimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, and Pasteurella multocida were negative. Both PCR and immunohistochemistry were negative on lung tissue for bovine corona virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, and infectious bovine rhinitracheitis virus (Bovine Herpesvirus-1). Bovine viral diarrhea virus PCR of lung tissue was negative, as was immunohistochemistry on ear notch. No parasites were observed on fecal flotation.  PCR amplification of the partial Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 gene was carried out on DNA extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded lung tissue, sequenced on an ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer at the Iowa State University DNA facility, and assembled using CAP3 (available at http://doua.prabi.fr/software/cap3). Assembled sequences were compared to sequences on GenBank using nucleotide BLAST. A 368 nt fragment of the partial ITS1 gene was obtained after sequencing. Nucleotide BLAST revealed that the sequence had 100% identity with several isolates of Ascaris spp. (KY576142, KY576143, KU522455, AB576588, AB571295, EF153619-EF153623) and 82-84% identity with Toxocara vitulorum (KT737382, KJ777180-KJ777182). PCR amplification of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (cox1) and nuclear SSU (18S) gene using the FFPE DNA template failed.
