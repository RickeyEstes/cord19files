First, the cytotoxicity of DSPE-PEG-DBCO treatment on the host Vero cells was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2(A) , Vero cells maintained similar viability in DSPE-PEG-DBCO to those in DMEM, even with DSPE-PEG-DBCO concentration up to 30 µg/mL for at least 72 h, therefore, DSPE-PEG-DBCO does not hinder cell viability. Next, the activity of modified viruses was evaluated via virus titer. As shown in Fig. 2(B) , the labeled viruses generated from various concentrations of DSPE-PEG-DBCO maintained similar infectivity compared to the wild-type viruses. Considering the solubility of DSPE-PEG-DBCO is around 30 µg/mL, we chose its concentration as 20 µg/mL for cell and virus modification. Additionally, the characteristic of the QD-N 3 was also verified by a colocalization assay. As shown in Figure S1 , the QDs and colocalization signals could only be detected in the QD-N 3 incubated DBCO modified virus (DBCO-virus) while no QDs or colocalization signals were detected with the QD-NH 2 or NHS-N 3 incubated DBCO-virus, indicating that the QD-N 3 was successfully generated by the reactions of QD-NH 2 and NHS-N 3 . Besides, the activities of DBCO modified virus and QD modified virus (QD-virus) were further evaluated by measuring the one-step growth kinetics. As shown in Fig. 2(C) , the growth kinetics of DBCO-or QD-viruses was similar to that of the wild-type ones, indicating that DBCO-or QD-viruses maintained the same infectivity as the wild type. Finally, the emission spectra of the QD-viruses were measured as shown in Fig. 2(D) , the QD still maintained its emission features after connecting with viruses.
