As highlighted by studies using the Unyvero 17 , 39 , molecular detection of resistance genes may correlate poorly with phenotypic sensitivity in its current form. Detection of genes from 'off panel' organisms, for example mec A genes in colonising coagulase negative staphylococci, may be incorrectly attributed to those organisms which are on the panel. As such, clinicians will need to be cautious in interpreting these results.
