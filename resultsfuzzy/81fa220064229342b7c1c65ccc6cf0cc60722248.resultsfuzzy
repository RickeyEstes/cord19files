To give insights into the effect of time delay or diffusion on system (3), it is of significance to investigate the local dynamics of its corresponding non-delay and non-diffusion model. Now, we consider the case of spatially homogeneous states, i.e. nondiffusion model. From a biological point of view, we are interested in the non-negative steady states S ≥ 0, I ≥ 0. We summarize the local dynamics of the model around the equilibrium states, see our previous paper [35] for more details. From Ref. [35] , we know that the system has three equilibrium states , which corresponds to extinction of the disease; (ii) Coexistence of the S and I population which is unstable and a saddle by direct calculations; (iii) Coexistence of the S and I population which is a stable node. Hereafter, we denote by E * = (S * , I * ) this local stable equilibrium. To ensure the positivity of S * and I * , one has the following condition In the sequential, we only focus on the locally asymptotically stable equilibrium E * . For the sake of establishing our main results in Section 4, we give a brief review on diffusion-induced Turing instability based on [35] for system (1). Linearizing system (1) around the spatially homogeneous equilibrium point (S * , I * ) for small space-and time-dependent fluctuations and expanding them in Fourier space we have the following characteristic equation where and the Jacobian matrix J at E * is given by Here, r = x(y) or r = (x, y) corresponds to the one-or two-dimension space, δS * and δI * are spatiotemporal perturbations, and k is the wave number. Solving Eq. (5) yields the characteristic polynomial of the original problem (1) where Therefore, the roots of (6) yield the dispersion relation At the bifurcation point, two equilibrium states of the model intersect and exchange their stability. Biologically speaking, this bifurcation corresponds to a smooth transition between equilibrium states. The Hopf bifurcation is space independent and breaks the temporal symmetry of a system, which gives rise to space-uniform and periodic-time oscillations, while the Turing bifurcation breaks spatial symmetry, leading to the formation of stationary-time and space-oscillation patterns [29, 32] . Hopf instability occurs if a pair of imaginary eigenvalues cross the real axis from the negative to the positive axis and the diffusion is absent [29, 32] . From a mathematical point of view, the Hopf bifurcation appears when A positive equilibrium state is said to be Turing instability if it is stable for the corresponding non-spatial model of (1), but becomes unstable with respect to homogeneous perturbation due to diffusion. A general linear analysis [38, 39] shows that the necessary conditions for yielding Turing patterns for model (1) are given by The first two conditions guarantee that the equilibrium (S * , I * ) is stable for the non-diffusion model of (1), and becomes unstable for model (1) if Re(λ 1,2 (J k )) transits from a negative value to a positive one (corresponding to last two conditions). Mathematically speaking, the Turing bifurcation occurs when and the wavenumber k T satisfies To compare the analytical predictions from the aforesaid analysis, we have to perform extensive numerical simulations of the system under the influence of time delay, using Eq. (3), by the explicit Euler method with parameters defined above. The continuous problem defined by the reaction-diffusion system in two-dimensional space is solved in a discrete domain with N X × N Y lattice sites. All our numerical simulations employ the Neumann boundary conditions with a time step size of △t = 0.001 and space step size △h = 1.0. In the present paper, we set N X = N Y = 200, and approximate the Laplacian describing diffusion by differences over △h [42] . The simulations are initiated with spatially random perturbations of ∼0.01% around the steady state E * . In this paper, we want to know the effect of delay on the distribution of infected individuals. As a result, we only show results of pattern formation about one distribution of I. We conduct the simulations until they reach a stationary state or suggest a behavior that does not seem to change its characteristics anymore. In the following part, we choose suitable values of parameters for simulation: For the different values of β located in the Turing space (the domain T in Fig. 1 ), different categories of Turing patterns for the distribution of I can emerge. In each pattern, the blue (red) represents the low (high) density of the infected I. However, we concern the effect of time delay on the pattern formation of I. For the non-delay spatial model (1), i.e. τ = 0 in model (3), when β ∈ (34.14, 44.07) for the above parameter set, Turing instability occurs. Figs. 2-3 present the evolution of the spatial pattern of infected population at 0, 1000, 50,000, 100,000 iterations, for β = 35 and 42 in the Turing space, respectively. In Fig. 2 , the regular stripe patterns prevail over the whole domain at last, and the dynamics of the system does not undergo any further changes; while in Fig. 3 , the spotted spatial patterns prevail the whole domain at last. We use these two case as baseline, and investigate the effect of delay on the pattern formation. The parameter values of Fig. 4 are the same as those in Fig. 2 , but with time delay, τ = 0.05. All of the figures show the evolution of the spatial patterns at 0, 1000, 50,000, 100,000 iterations, with small random perturbation of the stationary state S * and I * of the spatially homogeneous systems. From these figures, we can see that the regular stripe patterns also prevail over the whole domain at last, and the dynamics of the system does not undergo any further changes. However, it should be noted that there is an essential difference between Fig. 2 (non-delayed spatial system) and Fig. 4 (delayed spatial system), both starting from the same initial conditions. In particular, the large regular stripe patterns in Fig. 2 break down to small pieces in Fig. 4 , and the direction of the stripe of Fig. 4 is also changed. The parameter values of Fig. 5 are the same as those in Fig. 3 , but with delay τ = 0.1. Different from Fig. 3 , in which the spotted patterns prevail the whole domain finally, we find that stationary stripe and spot patterns coexist in the distribution of the infected population density at last in (33.86, 34.14) (34.14, 44.07), we find that stationary stripe and spot patterns emerge mixed in the distribution of the infected population density, and the dynamics of the system does not undergo any further changes finally. It should be noticed that the patterns are induced only by delayed-spatial system since there are no patterns for non-delayed spatial system, i.e. β = 34 ̸ ∈ (34.14, 44.07).
