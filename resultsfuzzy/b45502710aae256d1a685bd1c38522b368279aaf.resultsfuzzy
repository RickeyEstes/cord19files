Subcellular distribution of CLSV p25 fused to GFP in agroinfiltrated leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana CLSV p25 was fused to the N-terminus of GFP in a binary vector (Fig. 1B) and used in agroinfiltration studies to address the subcellular location of p25. Localization of fused and unfused control GFP was analyzed in epidermal cells of N. benthamiana by confocal microscopy. In cells infiltrated with unfused GFP, fluorescence was found within the nucleus and in the cytoplasm along the cell periphery as expected ( Fig. 2A, panel 1) . In contrast p25/GFP localized to large amorphous aggregates ( Fig. 2A , panel 2; see arrows) and to an ER-like network ( Fig. 2A, panel 3) . Nuclei were labeled along the periphery ( Fig. 2A , panel 2; see closed arrowheads). Smaller sometimes mobile punctate structures along the periphery of the cells were also observed ( Fig. 2A, 1 . Structure of the CLSV genome and of p25 mutant constructs used for agroinfiltration. A) The genomic location of the 5 proteins encoded by the CLSV genome (see text for further details). B) Deletion mutant constructs of p25 used for agroinfiltration were cloned into the binary vector pBINPLUS which contains the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, the Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) translational enhancer and the nopaline synthase transcription terminator. The N-terminal aa is shown for each N-terminal deletion mutant, i.e., pΔTMD1/GFP, pΔTMD12/GFP and pΔTMD123/GFP, which lack either the N-terminal 26, 81 or 96 aa respectively of p25. p25 aa1-97 /GFP contains the N-terminal 97 aa of p25, whereas the remaining sequence is deleted. (Schoelz et al., 2011) . However further research is required to demonstrate this possibility. CLSV p25/GFP associates with the endoplasmic reticulum in agroinfiltrated N. benthamiana The clear reticular pattern observed in cells of p25/GFP infiltrated leaves suggested that p25/GFP targets the ER. This was assessed by determining if p25/GFP colocalized with ER-specific dsRed2 (pER-dsRed2) that contains an ER targeting N-terminal signal peptide sequence along with an ER retention signal (HDEL) (Zhang et al., 2005) . p25/GFP plus pER-dsRed2 coinfiltrated plants were examined by confocal microscopy. It can be seen in Fig. 2B (row 1) that the reticular pattern associated with p25/GFP expression in epidermal cells co-localized with the pER-dsRed2 fluorescence. In addition, some of the smaller green aggregates or punctae colocalized with pER-dsRed2 punctae. Similar punctae were not present in leaf tissue infiltrated with pER-dsRed2 alone (not shown) indicating that they represent local elaborations of the ER membrane induced by p25/GFP. These "aggregates" may correspond to vesicles that are derived from the ER as numerous vesicles can be found in CLSV infected leaf tissue as determined by ultrastructural analysis (see below). Larger green fluorescent aggregates in this image did not contain a corresponding red fluorescent signal (see arrowheads) suggesting that these correspond to primarily p25/GFP protein aggregates (which are later shown to be membrane anchored-see below). Fig. 2B (row 2) shows that CLSV p25/GFP also targets the perinuclear ER as indicated by its colocalization with pER-dsRed2 (see arrow in merged image). benthamiana were agroinfiltrated with CLSV p25/GFP and the subcellular sites of targeting were analyzed at 2-7 dpi using confocal microscopy. Panel 1 shows an epidermal cell from a leaf agroinfiltrated with unfused GFP. Note that the nucleus is filled and the periphery of the cell (cytoplasm) is labeled as expected. Panels 2 and 3 correspond to p25/GFP infiltrated epidermal cells. Notable features include large aggregates distributed throughout the cell but often in association with the nucleus (see arrows in panel 2), label in association with the periphery of the nucleus (see closed arrowhead, panel 2) and the presence of smaller aggregates or mobile foci along the periphery of the cell (see open arrowhead in panel 2). The higher magnification view in panel 3 shows that fluorescence is observed in association with a web-like structure reminiscent of the ER (arrows). (B) Construct p25/GFP colocalizes with pER-dsRed2, a construct that specifically targets the endoplasmic reticulum. Each agroinfiltration experiment (rows 1, 2) included p25/GFP, p19 and the pER-dsRed2 marker. The first column shows p25/GFP fluorescence and the second column shows pER-dsRed2 fluorescence. The third column (Merge) corresponds to the digitally superimposed images. Row 1 shows an epidermal cell in which the pER-dsRed2 signal appears as a network. It can be seen that the p25/GFP signal colocalizes with the ER marker. p25/GFP also produced punctae and large amorphous structures which may (arrows) or may not (arrowheads) have corresponding signals in the pER-dsRed2 image (see text). Row 2 shows colocalization of p25/GFP with pER-dsRed2 in a ring surrounding the nucleus (see arrow in merged image).
