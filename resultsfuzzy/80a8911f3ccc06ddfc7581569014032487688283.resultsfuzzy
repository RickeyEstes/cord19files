Obtainment of MRCV-infective planthoppers and sample processing The capacity of MRCV to replicate in plant phloem as well as in its planthopper vector tissues [35] suggests that the virus has the ability to regulate gene expression in both hosts. MRCV replication in plant phloem cells (where it produces severe cytopathic effects) and in planthopper vector tissues (where it establishes a persistent propagative infection) probably involves a differential regulation of gene expression in each case. To study these still unknown gene regulation processes in insects, reliable reference genes must be selected as internal controls to perform gene expression analysis. Consequently, planthoppers undoubtedly able to transmit MRCV are needed to analyze variations on potential reference gene expression levels with respect to naïve insects. One-to-one transmission assays were performed to obtain MRCV-infective insects as described in Methods. As a result, only 4 out of 50 independently evaluated insects were capable of successfully transmitting MRCV to wheat. This transmission efficiency was similar to the reported previously for this kind of assays [35] . Only planthoppers able to transmit MRCV to wheat plants (infective insects) were kept for subsequent RT-qPCR studies along with control naïve insects subjected to the same procedure but always fed on uninfected plants. In parallel, four different methods for insect storage were tested: immediate freezing in liquid nitrogen List of D. kuscheli selected candidate genes names, assigned function, GenBank database accession codes, designed RT-qPCR primer sequences, length of the amplified fragment (A) and PCR efficiency as calculated by LinReg (E). ND: not determined. followed by storage at -70°C or stored for 10 days in absolute ethanol, acetone or Trizol. Next, RNA extraction was performed from each planthopper using a Trizol protocol adapted to the small size of the samples (see Methods). After measuring the resulting RNA concentration and analyzing its integrity, ethanol storage was chosen for further experiments because it was a simpler procedure and gave rise to good RNA quality (Additional file 1). Isolation of partial sequences of candidate Delphacodes kuscheli genes for the design of qPCR primers Seven housekeeping genes implicated in diverse cellular processes and commonly used as internal references for RT-qPCR in animals were selected as candidates for expression stability analysis. Partial sequences of Delphacodes kuscheli genes homologous to these candidate genes were obtained by RT-PCR with degenerated oligonucleotide primers (see Methods). The amplified actin (ACT), α-1-tubulin (TUB), elongation factor 1-α (EF1A), ribosomal protein S18 (RPS18), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and polyubiquitin C (UBI) D. kuscheli sequences showed 95%, 86%, 92%, 92%, 90% and 84% identity to Nilaparvata lugens ESTs sequences, respectively, and were deposited in the Gen-Bank database (Table 1) . Next, RT-qPCR oligonucleotides were designed for each of the D. kuscheli isolated gene fragments. Owed to the high conservation of ribosomal RNA sequences, the 18S rRNA primers were based on an available Laodelphax striatellus sequence [GenBank: AB085211]. The designed RT-qPCR primers ( Table 1) were able to efficiently amplify a single product of the expected size and did not show primer dimers formation in RT-PCR experiments (Additional file 2). In addition, a primer amplification performance test by real time RT-qPCR showed that all primer combinations yield a single amplicon and the absence of primer dimers formation in the dissociation step (data not shown). The PCR amplification efficiency of each set of primers was evaluated using the LinReg software which performs, for each individual sample, a baseline correction and a PCR efficiency calculation from the linear portion of the amplification curve slope by linear regression and then calculates a mean PCR efficiency for each primer pair [36] . The calculated PCR efficiency means ranged from 82% for UBI and TUB to 55% for 18S ( Table 1 ). The 18S primer pair low PCR efficiency might have been caused by incomplete annealing due to mismatches, given that their design was based on a related species sequence. Expression stability analysis of the candidate genes and optimum number of genes for normalization A real time RT-qPCR assay was carried out to examine the expression stability of the 7 candidate genes by the following procedure. Total RNA was extracted from the previously obtained MRCV-infective planthoppers along with control (naïve) individuals, and its concentration was precisely quantified with a spectrophotometer. As a mean for normalization of the sample input, equal amounts of total RNA (500 ng) from each planthopper were treated with DNAse I to remove possible genomic DNA contamination and then used for cDNA synthesis by retrotranscription as detailed previously. Parallel reactions without RT enzyme were performed and used for RT-PCR amplification as an additional control to check that no contaminating genomic DNA was present (Additional file 3). Finally, RT-qPCR experiments were carried as described in Methods. The full sample set including both infective and naïve planthoppers was subjected to each gene expression analysis to avoid between-run variations and three independent technical replicates were performed for each sample in all the experiments. The raw data obtained from each experiment was processed using the LinReg software for baseline correction and the resulting cycle threshold (Ct) values were used in candidate gene expression stability analysis by three different methods using geNorm [37] , Normfinder [38] and Bestkeeper [40] tools. GeNorm is a Visual Basic Application (VBA) for Microsoft Excel that ranks the genes under study by assigning a stability index M to each of them based on the average pair-wise variation of a gene compared to the rest of the studied genes [37] . According to the ranking of stability generated, ACT was the most stable gene with M= 0.4738, followed by UBI, GADPH, 18S and RPS18 with similar M coefficients. On the other hand, EF1A and TUB were listed as the most unstable genes with M > 1.2 ( Figure 1A ). Next, by performing a stepwise exclusion of the least stable gene and recalculating the M value for the remaining genes, geNorm detected that the most stable pair of reference genes was ACT/GAPDH (Figure 2A ) which displayed the first and third place in the individual stability ranking. Finally, starting with the two most stable genes, the program calculates the pair-wise variation V of two consecutive normalization factors (NF) that result from stepwise introduction of another gene (the one with the lowest M remaining) [37] . This analysis showed that if we consider the generally adopted threshold of V = 0.15 [37, 41, 42] , the inclusion of a third gene does not result in any appreciable improvement of the normalization factor. Moreover, the V values resulting from adding a third, fourth and fifth gene were low (V < 0.015) and the threshold was only reached when adding the two most unstable genes ( Figure 2B ). Thus, these results indicated that only the 2 most stable genes are needed for a reliable normalization. The Normfinder VBA program analyzes gene expression stability by means of a mathematical model, focusing in the inter-and intra-group variation [38] . This approach ranked UBI as the most stable gene (stability value = 0.1754) followed by 18S, ACT and RPS18 ( Figure 1B) . This is in accordance to geNorm results, which situated UBI as the second most stable gene after ACT. However, Normfinder ranked GAPDH as the most unstable gene, whereas geNorm considered it the third most stable. This difference, due to the singular processing and assumptions of each statistical approach, indicates that it is strongly recommended to carry out more than one analysis when studying expression stability of putative reference genes. Finally, BestKeeper Excel tool, analyzes each gene's expression variability by calculating the Ct set standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variance (CV) and then by pair-wise comparison calculates the correlation between the genes and with the Bestkeeper index [40] . This application ranked UBI as the least variable gene with a Ct standard deviation (SD) of 0.31 (1.24 fold change) followed by 18S with SD = 0.39 (1.31 fold change) and indicated that TUB, EF1A and GAPDH were the most variable genes ( Figure 1C ). When pairwise comparing the calculated BestKeeper index against each of the candidate genes, UBI and 18S also showed the higher correlation, with R > 0.89 and p = 0.003 ( Figure 1C ). It is worthy noticing that according to this analysis, none of the genes can be considered inconsistent since all of the SD values were lower than 1 [40] . BestKeeper and Normfinder yielded comparable results, selecting UBI and 18S as the two most stable genes and GAPDH as the least stable one ( Figure 1B  and 1C) . On the other hand, the geNorm ranking was mostly dissimilar, positioning GAPDH as the third most stable gene ( Figure 1A ). Nevertheless, with the exception of this conflictive gene, all three approaches clearly separated the 7 candidate genes in two distinct groups according to their stability indexes: one group of a low variability and high stability composed of UBI, ACT, 18S and RPS18 and a second one more variable and unstable composed of EF1A and TUB (Figure 1 ). Taken the three method's output together, the results indicate that UBI is the most reliable reference gene for quantitative analysis of MRCV-infective planthopper mRNA levels by RT-qPCR. If two (or more) genes are used for normalization, 18S and ACT are the most suitable choices as a second reference. In agreement, the ACT gene has been recently employed as an internal control for the Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) quantification in individual thrip vectors, although in this case the validation of its expression stability was not previously showed [43] .
