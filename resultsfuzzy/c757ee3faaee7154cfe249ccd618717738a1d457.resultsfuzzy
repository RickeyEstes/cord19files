The intriguing structure of 2, optimizing both alkyl chain length and end cap polarity for binding to HRV-14, clearly presented multiple challenges for labelling with tritium. The scale and other practical considerations ruled out a simple mimic of the unlabelled synthesis (Diana et al., 1989 ) employing tritiated components. Ideally, a penultimate precursor, converted in an efficient single step tritiation to the desired product, would be most inviting. In fact, olefin precursor 3 had been reported (Mallamo et al., 1992) during the course of a study exploring the stereochemical requirements of the hydrophobic binding pocket. Catalytic olefin reduction with tritium has been very successful in preparing high specific activity radioligands, but heterogeneous catalyst could not be used because of the likely potential of dechlorination as well as isoxazole ring cleavage. For a solution, we turned to Wilkinson's catalyst (Young et al., 1965) which we had earlier utilized to prepare [ 3 H] dihydrostrychnine at high specific activity (Filer and Ahern, 1989) and which in principle would be free of the above untoward side reductions. Catalytic tritiation of 3 with Wilkinson's catalyst afforded, after HPLC purification, radiochemically pure product 4 at 2 TBq/mmol by UV assay. A tritium NMR spectrum (Fig. 1) provided a convincing proof that the tritium incorporation was exclusively in the stable alkyl chain methylenes as indicated, and its characteristic doublet of doublets pattern corroborated the high specific activity as measured by UV. The tritium NMR also disclosed that little, if any, scrambling of the label into the other methylenes had occurred. Carried out several times on precursor 3, this method proved to be robust, yielding pure 4 in excess of 1.9 TBq/mmol each time. Antiviral radioligand 4 has proven extremely useful to screen and identify other further optimized antiviral candidates (Fox et al., 1991) .
