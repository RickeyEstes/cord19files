All patients exhibited diffuse bronchiectasis on HRCT scan. Two patients (# 15 and 29) had a history of smoking (2 and 10 pack-years, respectively) and had ceased smoking for more than 5 years. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Results of NO n measurement and TEM analysis of ciliary ultrastructure are shown in Table 2 . As summarized in Figure 2 , the 34 patients were divided into three groups: in the PCD group (10 patients), a diagnosis of PCD was confirmed with absence of dynein arms affecting most of the cilia combined with a low level of NO n ; in the non-PCD group (15 patients), ciliary ultrastructure and NO n measurements were considered normal, therefore excluding a diagnosis of PCD; in the inconclusive diagnosis group (9 patients), no conclusion could be reached because of discordant results between TEM and NO n (Figure 2 ). Among these 9 inconclusive patients, 8 patients presented more than 70% normal cilia associated with abnormal NO n (< 100 nl/min). The abnormal NO n level was always confirmed by a second NO n measurement performed at least six months later. In one patient (#33), the rate of normal cilia was below 50%, but NO n was within the normal range. This patient had a second nasal biopsy and another NO n measurement. The new results (50% abnormal cilia and 250 nl/min) did not modify this patient's diagnostic status. No significant difference was observed between the three groups for age, FEV 1 , FEV 1 / VC and PaO 2 .
