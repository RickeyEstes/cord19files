Sixty-six intensive care patients were enrolled in the study within the first 24 hours after the onset of severe sepsis or septic shock. Twenty-one healthy individuals served as controls. At day 0, day 1 and day 3 after diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock, plasma sTREM-1 was measured by ELISA. Plasma sTREM-1 concentrations of healthy controls did not differ from patients with severe sepsis or septic shock at day 0 (42.8 ± 44.9 pg/ml vs 40.8 ± 45.5 pg/ml, not significant), day 1 (42.8 ± 44.9 pg/ml vs 48.6 ± 57.2 pg/ml, not significant) nor at day 3 (42.8 ± 44.9 pg/ml vs 51.9 ± 52.8 pg/ml, not significant). Survivors were defined as patients surviving to at least day 28. There were no differences of plasma sTREM-1 between survivors and nonsurvivors at day 0, day 1 and day 3 (34.8 ± 44 52.4 pg/ml S19 vs 49.5 ± 35.9 pg/ml, 42.6 ± 61.1 pg/ml vs 59.6 ± 47.1 pg/ml, and 47.9 ± 60.2 pg/ml vs 58.2 ± 37.1 pg/ml, not significant). Conclusion In this study including surgical patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, plasma sTREM-1 is not elevated compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, the measurement of plasma sTREM-1 did not allow one to differ between survivors and nonsurvivors. The suggested role of sTREM-1 as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in sepsis was not confirmed in this study. We inserted 16 PICC and 40 MC in patients requiring prolonged venous access (estimated >15 days); nine were septic, six had coagulopathy, 21 had tracheostomy. We used both silicone and polyurethane 4 Fr catheters. Procedures were performed by a team of trained physicians and nurses. Catheter insertion was easy in most cases, and immediate complications were few (no failure; one hematoma; no arterial or nerve injury). Late complications were: one local infection; three thrombosis (two requiring removal); four cases of damage of the external catheter (due to poor nursing or to inappropriate use of the catheter during rx procedures), all easily repaired; one dislocation; no catheter occlusion; no catheter-related bacteremia. Most catheters stayed in place for a prolonged time (range 9-65 days, median 19 days); only three were removed because of complications. Conclusion Our experience with PICC and MC was characterized by an extremely low rate of infective and thrombotic complications. Venous access was achieved in any patient, even with limited availability of peripheral veins. The use of US-inserted PICC and MC should be considered when central access is not advisable or is contraindicated. Introduction Ultrasound has been introduced in the insertion of central venous lines to reduce the complications associated with the conventional landmark technique [1] . We compared both techniques; we noted the number of attempts, the duration of insertion and complications. Methods Thirty patients were randomly selected, from the operating theatre and ICU, who required placement of a central venous catheter. The central venous catheter placement was performed by two experienced anaesthetists with more than 6 years experience in anaesthesia and intensive care. In 15 patients the internal jugular venous catheter placement was performed using the external anatomical landmark technique, and in the other 15 patients the placement was under ultrasound guidance. The duration of insertion was recorded from the moment the needle touched the skin until insertion of the catheter and removal of the guide wire. The numbers of attempts as well as immediate or delayed complications were recorded. Results The central venous catheter placement was successfully performed from the first attempt in both groups. There were no immediate or delayed complications noted; however, the mean time of insertion was longer in the ultrasound-guided group (4.55 min) compared with the external anatomical landmark group (2 min) ( Figure 1 ). Discussion Some studies have been designed to evaluate ultrasound-guided central venous catheter placement compared with the conventional method based on external anatomical landmarks. These studies demonstrated the superiority of ultrasound-guided central venous line placement over the external anatomical landmark technique. However, there was no time gain demonstrated in ultrasound-guided placement [2] . On the other hand, a number of studies have expressed several reservations concerning the systematic use of ultrasound guidance for central line placement [3] . In our patients we found that the use of ultrasound neither altered the rate of complication nor the number of attempts in central venous catheter placement. Also the duration of placement of the central line catheter using the external We recently demonstrated in isolated blood perfused rat lungs subjected to i.t. LPS-induced pulmonary oedema that the continuous measurement of inspiratory resistive work is a good indirect indicator of progressive lung oedema [1] . Here we extend these findings to two other types of pulmonary oedema: hydrostatic oedema induced by elevation of the left atrial pressure, and alveolar oedema (ALV) by infusing normal saline into the trachea at two different infusion rates (2 and 4 ml/hour for 120 min). See Table 1 . Our results indicate that the continuous measurement of inspiratory resistive work is a good indicator of both permeability and hydrostatic lung oedema, but not of pure alveolar oedema (absence of interstitial oedema  We treated 624 CPA patients in the past 2 years, 38% were cardiac and 62% were noncardiac aetiology (3% subarachnoid haemorrhage and 5% acute aortic dissection). Restricted in cardiac aetiology patients, 13% showed a ventricular fibrillation (VF) as a first monitored rhythm and 33% showed a VF during resuscitation. In all patients, 50% of VF were witnessed. In witnessed patients, 17% were witnessed by the ELST during transfer and 81% by a layperson, most of whom are patients' families and patients' friends. Fifty-three per cent were witnessed in the patients' home (35% in patients' private room, 1% in bathroom and 7% in lavatory), 4% in an aged people's residence, 1% in a hotel, restaurant, office, and 3% on the road. Only 48% of CPA patients underwent bystander CPR, and 51% of witnessed CPA patients (24% of all CPA patients) underwent bystander CPR by the witness; most patients underwent bystander CPR in the patients' home by the patients' families. Conclusions In Japan, CPA patients were witnessed mainly in their home by their families or their friends. The aetiology of some CPA patients is noncardiac (subarachnoid haemorrhage or acute aortic dissection, etc.). However, only 24% CPA patients underwent bystander CPR by the witness.  Introduction We evaluated the time course and relationship of proinflammatory cytokines and procalcitonin (PCT) serum levels after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). We hypothesized that an increase of cytokine levels would precede a marked increase in PCT levels and that PCT would be the best predictor of the final neurologic outcome. Methods Data were prospectively collected from 71 patients. Blood samples were taken after admission to the hospital and after 6, 12, 24, 72 and 120 hours. PCT, IL-6, IL-8 and TNFα levels were measured using automated assays. On day 14 patients were divided into two neurologic outcome groups according to the Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC 1-3: bad; CPC 4-5: good). Differences between groups were evaluated using a t test. ROC curves were computed to analyze the predictive value of the markers for a bad outcome. Results There was an early and significant increase in TNFα, IL-6 and IL-8 after admission to the hospital (14.4 ± 5.2, 185 ± 248 and 89 ± 81 µg/l) and in the ensuing 6 hours (15.6 ± 8.7, 209 ± 239 and 176 ± 232 µg/l) in patients with bad neurologic outcome. Initially, PCT levels were indistinguishable between the groups; however, a striking increase was observed in patients with bad neurologic outcome peaking after 24 hours (16.7 ± 30.0 vs 6.9 ± 2.1 µg/l; P < 0.013). PCT values after 24 hours were the best predictor for a bad neurologic outcome with an area under the curve of 0.91 (cutoff value: 0.44; sensitivity 100%/specificity 62%). Conclusion TNFα, IL-6 and IL-8 serum levels are significantly elevated in the early phase after successful CPR in patients with bad neurological outcome. PCT increases are subsequently found and have a high prognostic value for the neurologic outcome. Introduction Mortality among patients surviving to be discharged following inhospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is high. The present study assesses whether this might be explained by differences in patient factor or in factors at resuscitation. Methods An analysis of IHCA data collected from one Swedish tertiary hospital and from five Finnish secondary hospitals over a 10-year period. The study was limited to patients surviving to be discharged from the hospital. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with survival at 1 year from the arrest. . There was no difference in initial rhythm, delay to defibrillation or delay to return of spontaneous circulation between survivors and nonsurvivors at 12 months. Conclusion Several patient factors, mainly age, functional status and co-morbid disease, influence long-term survival following IHCA. Location of the arrest also influences survival, but the initial rhythm, the delays to defibrillation and return of spontaneous circulation do not. Introduction Mild hypothermia (32-34°C) is a promising new therapy for patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Animal studies suggest that early and fast cooling is crucial for beneficial effect on neurological outcome. Inducing mild hypothermia immediately after successful restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in the out-of-hospital setting remains a challenge. Therefore, a novel cooling-blanket (EMCOOLSpad ® ), independent of any energy source during use, was developed. The aim of the study was to evaluate feasibility and safety of out-of-hospital surface cooling with EMCOOLSpad ® in patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Methods We included patients successfully resuscitated from outof-hospital cardiac arrest with an oesophageal temperature (T es ) >34°C. The EMCOOLSpad ® consists of multiple cooling units (12 mm thick), filled with a mixture of graphite/water, which are stored in a cooling box at -3°C in the ambulance car. Cooling was initiated as soon as feasible by the first treating paramedics and emergency physicians, and was continued in the emergency room. The cooling-blanket was removed when the T es reached 34°C. The target temperature of T es 33°C was maintained for 24 hours. Data are presented as the median and interquartile range (25-75%).
