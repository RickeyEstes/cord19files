Estimates of the transmission rates for the 2-strain model with BL incidence suggest that MERS-CoV transmission in the three locations is dominated by community and hospital transmission (S1 Table to S9 Table) . The former statement is in good agreement with a previous study that suggested that MERS-CoV infections are essentially produced through both hospital and community based human-human transmission [2] . This fact is well reflected in the estimates of transmission rates obtained from the other two 2-strain models (e.g. NM and SAT incidence functions) for the three locations (S1-S9 Tables). Estimates of the parameter Î¸ (a measure of variability within the two strains) in Riyadh and Macca (see S1-S3 Tables) suggest that both strains are currently active in these provinces (albeit strain 2 contributes with only 3% -50% to community human-human transmission). In Madina instead, a majority of the models (BL and NM) point to only one active strain,with strain 2 contributing less than 1% to community human-human transmission, see S1-S9 Tables. For each particular region in this study, two strain models are compared among themselves and also with regard to their single-strain counterparts in order to determine the best model (i.e. single, two-strain or a combination of other two-strain models). Results show that in the three locations, 2-strain models provide a better fitting to cumulative cases in comparison to their single strain counterparts (Fig 2) . AIC and BIC values for the 2-strain models suggest that the best model is region specific (best model for Riyadh is a 2-strain model with BL incidence, whereas in Macca and Madina the best models are both the model with a NM incidence function and the one incorporating super-spreaders, respectively; see S19 Table) . We also compare our 2-strain models with a 2-strain model with variable Zoonotic transmission (SI Eq. A2). Comparing AIC and BIC values, we found that the models with variable Zoonotic transmission (SI Eq. A2) did not improve all the previous results (see S19 Table) . Therefore, the best model among all 2-strain models cannot be determined solely from their goodness-offit comparison. For this reason, we additionally compared all the two-strain models on the basis of their respective prediction skills. Forecasts for the three models in Riyadh suggest that, a majority of the times, the 2-strain model with SAT incidence can better predict the three targets in comparison to the other two competing 2-strain models (e.g. note that for SAT the average of the mean absolute error, MAE, for peak week is 11.6, whereas for peak maximum is 24.83 and for season totals 55.62) (Table 2A) . For comparison, we also provide predictions in the province of Riyadh of the three targets using the model with super-spreaders. However, prediction with super-spreaders did not improve at all the former results obtained for Riyadh (see Table 2A ). For Madina, both the peak week and season totals are better predicted by the same SAT 2-strain model (i.e. MAE average for peak week being 14.5 and 9.33 for season totals; see also S22 Table) . However, when predicting the peak maximum in Madina, clearly the best model is the 2-strain model with the NM incidence function (i.e. MAE average for peak maximum being 2.62; see also S22 Table) . For Macca, except for the peak week, the other two targets, namely peak maximum and season totals are better predicted with the 2-strain model with BL incidence (i.e. MAE average of 7.08 for peak maximum and of 63.42 for season totals, respectively; see S22 Table) . For peak week in Macca, again a better prediction is achieved by the 2-strain model with SAT incidence (i.e. MAE average for peak week being 23.9, see S22 Table) . When comparing the three two strain models to their single-strain counterparts, composites of the mean absolute error (MAE) in Riyadh (Table 2A , and S23 Table) suggest that 2-strain models always outperform the single strain versions in predicting the three targets (i.e. peak week, peak maximum, and season totals). Averages of MAE for peak week, peak maximum and for season totals are 11.6, 24.83 and 55.62, respectively. This fact reinforces our earlier inference, confirming that there is more than one strain currently active in Riyadh. Among the single-strain models in Riyadh, the model with SAT incidence is found to have a better predictive capacity for the three targets in comparison to the other two single-strain models (S23 Table) . In Macca instead, the single-strain model with SAT incidence provides better predictions of the peak week, the peak maximum and seasontotals in comparison to all the other models (see for instance MAE values in S22 Table; and values obtained for 1-strain and 2-strain models in S22 Table) . Conversely, in Madina, both 1-strain and 2-strain models with SAT incidence provide a similar performance in predicting the three targets (e.g. MAE for peak week 16.7 in comparison to 14.5, for peak maximum of 3.33 compared to 3.6 and for season totals of 5.87 against 9.33; see S22 and S23 Tables). The latter may likely represent the best choice of models to form the basis of a future early-warning system for MERS-CoV prediction in the region. The best model, selected on the basis of its capacity to derive skillful predictions, is the model with the SAT incidence function. We used this model to estimate the basic reproduction number, R 0 , the community reproduction number, R C , and the hospital reproduction number, R H , for the whole period of data available in those three provinces (Table 2B and S20  Table) . In all three provinces, R 0 is estimated to be always greater than unity. In all three provinces, R H is found out to be larger than R C . This implies, MERS-CoV transmission triggered from the hospital setting (see Table 2B ). These estimates agree with some previous values reported in the literature [4, [17] [18] , while being a result well supported by other R 0 estimates [29] [30] [31] 33] . However, previous modeling attempts to model Saudi Arabia MERS-CoV clinical incidence used only a 1-strain model with BL transmission [4] . In our case, versions of R 0 were also estimated from our BL 1-strain model in those same three provinces (see S21 Table) and they are in good agreement with the previous values provided by Chowell et al.[4] . At the same time, though, 1-strain model show less predictive capacity than their similar two-strain counterparts. To further verify the robustness of these estimates, the temporal evolution of R 0 , R C , and R H are displayed for different time intervals in the three provinces (S1-S4 Figs). Considering the best model configurations, we additionally computed the temporal evolution of R 0 , R C , and R H in the three provinces. Temporal changes in R 0 (S1 Fig) indicate that in most of the predicted weeks, R 0 stays well above the epidemic threshold (R 0 = 1). This fact is well established from the temporal evolution of R C , and R H in those three provinces (S1 and S2 Figs).
