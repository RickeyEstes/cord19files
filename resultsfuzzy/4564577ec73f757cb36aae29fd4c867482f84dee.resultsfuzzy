This section presents the findings of the scoping review and interviews in thematic order. 3.1. Information that can be gathered from CDR or SMS data CDR datasets contain information on the location and time at which a communication (call/SMS) is made along with unique identifiers for the sender and receiver. These data may be valuable for disaster management when they are used to estimate population size and density in a region or city, based on the number of phone subscribers in the coverage area of each cellular tower (Bharti et al., 2015) . Information on population distribution before and after a disaster can be useful when assessing exposure risk and response needs. In a health emergency, the high spatial and temporal resolution data on population numbers inferred through CDRs could assist in identifying potential pathways of disease transmission, populations and locations at risk of disease outbreak, population-level access to and need for medical and social services, and effective allocation of humanitarian aid (Bharti et al., 2015) . Significant recent attention has focused primarily on the use of CDRs to assess spatial patterns of human travel and for tracking population mobility over time (Tatem, 2014; Tatem et al., 2014; Wesolowski et al., 2014a Wesolowski et al., , 2014b . For diseases like Ebola which are spread by person to person contact, this use of CDRs can be valuable for estimating population migration from areas of high infection to other areas, and may indicate important routes of travel (Wesolowski et al., 2014b) . These population movements are derived by tracking the geographic location (i.e. based on the nearest cellular tower when a communication is made by the mobile phone user) of individual mobile numbers over a period of time, which provides information on the number of mobile users that remain in an area, or leave, and their direction of travel. Tatem et al. (2014) describe how population movements between 'source' and 'sink' (net exporter and importer of diseases) communities inferred from CDRs can be combined with disease case data to create maps of disease risk. Population location information gathered via CDRs can further be used to assess compliance with travel restrictions in disease-affected areas, or government closure orders of facilities (Oliver, 2013) . When unique identifiers are included in CDR datasets, it may even be possible to assess individual-level mobility. For example, Tatem et al. (2014) describe how a 'metric of cumulative risk' can be calculated for individuals, based on the total amount of time spent in a disease endemic region. SMS-based tools are, meanwhile, enabling humanitarian agencies to collect specific data on population needs when mobile phone users respond to questions sent via text message. The literature describes the use of SMS platforms for collecting information from the public and from health professionals, such as for reporting of potential disease symptoms or supply requirements (Asiimwe et al., 2011) . For example, Tracey et al. (2015) describe EbolaTracks, an SMS based platform for active self-monitoring of persons who recently visited an Ebola outbreak area. The person is provided with a self-monitoring kit including thermometer, and a mobile phone with SMS capability. Twice daily over the next 21 days (Ebola incubation period), health personnel send text messages to the persons involved in the programme, instructing them to report symptoms and temperature. Any abnormal reports alert a medical officer, who proceeds to follow up the potential case and initiate an isolation procedure if required. During a health emergency, two way SMS can also work as both a triage tool, and as a crowdsourced data collection platform for collating information from the public. Several open source twoway SMS data platforms exist, including Frontline SMS (http:// www.frontlinesms.com/), and RapidPro SMS (https://community. rapidpro.io/), facilitating data collection and analysis. Trad et al. (2015) describe a proposed SMS platform that would both direct suspected Ebola cases to nearby health facilities, as well as collect information from the public about disease cases. SMS is also being used to collect other vital information needed to effectively respond to health emergencies, including availability of resources in an area. In 2014 amidst the Ebola outbreak, the World Food Programme set up a monthly SMS-based survey for all phone users in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, asking people to report food shortages and prices in their area (Anderson, 2014) . The RapidPro open-source SMS system was deployed in Sierra Leone to quickly gather information on Ebola prevention supplies in schools, including washing kits and thermometers, enabling rapid response to those schools suffering shortages (Mushayi, 2015) . 3.2. Phases in the disease disaster management cycle when mobile data may be useful Fig. 2 presents a typology for describing the source, type and primary end-use of passively and actively produced mobile phone data during different phases in the disease disaster management cycle, based on information emerging from our analysis. Note that smartphone app and interactive voice response (IVR) data are not discussed here but are likely to have similar characteristics as two-way SMS data.
