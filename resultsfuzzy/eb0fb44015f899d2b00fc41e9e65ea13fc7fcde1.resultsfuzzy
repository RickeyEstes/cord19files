Our dataset is a panel dataset with time series data for each variable by region. We applied both the fixed effects and the random effects models to estimate Equation (1). The estimation outcomes are shown in Table 2 . Based on the Hasuman test, the fixed effects model is rejected which indicates that the random effects model is an appropriate model. Several important findings can be drawn from the estimation outcomes. The first finding is that the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases will decrease if the average monthly temperature (ATTEMP) goes up, which is consistent with the findings of Keatinge and Donaldson [1] . They concluded that the global warming will reduce the number of deaths from heart disease. The estimated parameter indicates that the percentage of the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases will decrease by 0.231% if the average temperature increases by 1%. However, the estimated cross effect of the seasonal dummy variable and the average temperature shows that the effect of a 1% decrease of average monthly temperature on the mortality of cardiovascular disease in the winter season will be 0.132% higher than that in the other seasons. The positive sign of seasonal dummy variable indicates that the mortality of cardiovascular disease is more sensitive during winter seasons. Secondly, the empirical results indicate that the percentage of the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases will increase by 0.226% if the variation in monthly temperature increases by 1%. This implies that the variation in temperature (VARTEMP) has a significant positive effect on the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases. The effect of precipitation is significantly positive while the effect of the daily lowest temperature (MINTEMP) is significantly negative which implies that the lower temperature will increase the mortality of cardiovascular disease. Thirdly, for the extreme weather events, we found that the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases is significantly affected by the number of cold days (COLDDAY). The percentage of the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases will increase by 0.277% if the number of cold days increases by 1%. The empirical results also indicate that bigger population will result in higher mortality and a good health care system can reduce mortality. According to climate change scenarios on temperature, the estimated parameters shown in Table 2 can be used to calculate the effects of climate change on the mortality of cardiovascular diseases in Taiwan. Our empirical results indicate that the effect of the average monthly temperature on the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases is more profound than those of the other climate variables. As a result, the estimated parameter can be used to calculate the effects of climate change on the mortality of cardiovascular diseases for alternative climate change scenarios on temperature. The climate change scenarios are retrieved directly from IPCC's 2007 Report [13] which includes scenarios B1, B2, A1B, and A2 at year 2100. Among the four scenarios, B1 and B2 are more optimistic scenarios while A1B and A2 are more pessimistic scenarios. The best estimated temperature rise is 1.8 °C with a likely range of 1.1 to 2.9 °C for scenario B1, while the best estimated temperature rise is 2.4 °C with a likely range of 1.4 to 3.8 °C for scenario B2. For the two pessimistic scenarios A1B and A2, the best estimated temperature rise are 2.8 °C (ranging from 1.7 to 4.4 °C ) and 3.4 °C (ranging form 2.0 to 5.4 °C ), respectively. Based on IPCC's estimation of global climate sensitivity and a case study on the projected climate change in Taiwan by Hsu and Chen [12] , the temperature variation increase in Taiwan due to climate change was simulated to be within the range of 5% to 16%. The estimated effect of temperature variations on the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases is 0.235% for the winter season and 0.448% for the other seasons when the temperature variation increases by 1%. Therefore, the combination of these two numbers could be used to estimate the possible percentage increase in the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases due to climate change. In this study, we adopted the lowest value (1.2%) and the middle value (4.1%) of the estimated range to evaluate the economic impacts of climate change on cardiovascular diseases. 10.389 Note: The numbers in the parentheses are the standard deviations while * denotes statistical significance at the 10% level, ** represents the 5% significance level, and *** represents the 1% significance level.
