We consider the effects of clustering on the efficacy of contact tracing using pairwise models by starting the system at the endemic state in the absence of any contact tracing. We then introduce tracing at a success probability e, and allow the system to evolve away from the endemic state for 0.1 and one generations (time periods 1=(10g) and 1=g respectively, corresponding to policy evaluation after a number of months and a number of years for an endemic STI) and measure the numbers infectious. This gives the results in Figure 4 , which show that clustering increases the efficacy of contact tracing at a given success rate at one infectious generation, but not at 0.1 generations, depending on the actual tracing success rate. Pane C shows this variety of responses, where clustering is more effective for large success rates at this small time-the very large rates require still smaller times to demonstrate this effect, since after 0.1 disease generations they have passed into the regime where clustering leads to less effective tracing. The results shown in Panes C and D of Figure 2 provide a guide to intuition to explain these results. Clustering increases the number of Â½I{I pairs present at a given endemic state, and contact tracing can be viewed as hyper-parasitism on the network of infected individuals. This means that clustering can be expected to enhance the efficacy of contact tracing by increasing the neighbourhood size of the infected sub-network. On the other hand, to explain a constant level of endemic infection as clustering is increased, a larger underlying rate of transmission must be present, which will undermine tracing as an individual left untouched by a wave of tracing will reinfect their immediate neighbourhood more quickly. Exactly which parameter choices allow either effect to dominate is not clear, except that lower levels of tracing success always cause clustering to increase the efficacy of tracing. Otherwise, it appears that the impact of clustering on contact tracing needs to be evaluated on a case-bycase basis.
