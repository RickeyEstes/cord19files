In 1978 James 131 fi rst reported pneumothorax as a complication of passing a narrow-bore nasogastric tube. Since that time numerous authors [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] [137] [138] [139] have reported this complication. Narrow-bore feeding tubes are particularly likely to give rise to pneumothorax because of the tube's small diameter (2.7 mm), self-lubricating properties, and wire stylet-all of which permit their undetected entry into the tracheobronchial tree, perforation of pulmonary tissue, and lodging in the pleural cavity. 134 Other factors associated with increased risk of a misplaced feeding tube include the presence of an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube (these may increase pulmonary passage of the tube by preventing glottis closure and perhaps by inhibiting swallowing), altered mental status, denervation of airways, esophageal stricture, enlargement of the heart, and neuromuscular weakness. 137 The clinical signs commonly used to ascertain correct placement of the feeding tube may be misleading. Normally, to confi rm the correct placement of a feeding tube in the stomach, a small amount of air is injected. This produces a characteristic gurgle in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, but a "pseudoconfi rmatory gurgle" with a feeding tube in the chest has been reported. 133 Aspiration of large amounts of fl uid through the tube is also taken to be a test of correct placement into the stomach, but delayed aspiration of a large quantity of undigested enteral feeding solution from the pleural space, mistaken for gastric contents, has been reported. 132
