From 915 original citations, the authors included 6 articles describing clinical assessment of influenza-related illness in a total of 7,105 patients. The LR associated with each symptom is shown in the Table. In studies not restricting inclusion to specific age groups, no single clinical finding consistently had an LR high or low enough to clinically rule in or rule out influenza, respectively. The highest LR associated with a positive finding was 1.8, and the lowest associated with a negative finding was 0.4. "Feverishness," myalgias, malaise, sore throat, and sneezing each had LRs with confidence intervals (CIs) that include 1.0, rendering them useless in predicting the presence or absence of influenza infection. The greatest LR reported (5.4) was for patients at least 60 years old who each had all 3 characteristics of fever, cough, and acute onset, found in 1 study. Among patients at least 60 years old, fever, chills, malaise, myalgias, feverishness, cough, headache, and nasal congestion had LRs associated with a positive finding greater than 1 whose 95% CIs did not cross 1 (see Table) . In the age-unrestricted group, among all clinical findings studied, fever and cough had the largest diagnostic odds ratios (see EBEM teaching point) at 4.5 and 2.8, respectively, implying that these findings may be the most useful for Volume , .  : January  distinguishing patients with influenza from those without. However, as shown above, in the age-unrestricted group, the presence or absence of fever (the finding with the largest diagnostic odds ratio and LRs farthest from 1) is unlikely by itself to change a physician's clinical impression. The sensitivities and specificities for rapid diagnostic tests ranged from 59% to 81% and 70% to 99%, respectively. The cost-effectiveness of the rapid diagnostic tests depended on the pretest probability of a positive influenza finding. The authors of one study of cost-effectiveness in unvaccinated patients older than 65 years concluded that testing was preferred for pretest probabilities only between 5% and 14% because with pretest probabilities greater than 14%, simply treating all patients empirically with the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir was more cost-effective than testing first.
