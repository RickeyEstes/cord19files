The present study establishes the fact that darkling beetles serve as vectors for common avian pathogens (Tables 1 and 2 ), a finding supported by the works of others [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 141 . In addition, we have found that the frequency with which these beetles can carry detectable pathogenic viruses, coccidia, or bacteria is unexpectedly high. Darkling beetles must be considered on a list of vectors known to transmit common poultry pathogens. These pathogens also include bacteria such as Salmonella. The risk posed by beetles as disseminators of diseases is of immense importance to the poultryindustry, and the threat of severe adverse economic impact from these diseases should not be overlooked or casually dismissed. Follow-up studies are warranted, perhaps to calculate the impact of beetle homogenate on production performance parameters and financial cost/loss estimates. One practical implication of our findings is that poultry producers should seriously consider incorporating darkling beetle abatement programs into their disease control programs. 3. These pathogens include immunosuppressive viruses (birnavirus, the agent of infectious bursal disease) and bacteria such as Salmonella. 4. There is substantial risk posed by beetles with respect to dissemination of diseases. The poultry industry should consider the implications of this risk seriously. 5. The threat of severe adverse economic impact from beetle-vectored diseases should not be overlooked or casually dismissed. 6. Darkling beetle abatement programs should be incorporated into disease control programs and should eliminate beetle-vectored pathogens, thus decreasing poultry production costs and increasing poultry production profits.
