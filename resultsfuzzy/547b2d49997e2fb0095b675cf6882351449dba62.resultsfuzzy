In this section, we carried out four sets of experiments based on the dormitory-building social network with 4 layers we have constructed. The first two experiments explain the contributions of the heterogeneity of links and heterogeneity of effective contacts to control the epidemic propagation. The third one gives the performance comparison between global targeted immunization and hierarchical targeted immunization. The fourth one validates the stability of the hierarchical targeted immunization.
