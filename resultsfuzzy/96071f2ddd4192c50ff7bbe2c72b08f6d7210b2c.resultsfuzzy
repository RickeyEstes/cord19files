2.1. Chemistry 2.1.1. Isolation, structure elucidation, and antiviral assay of CI - 39 The aqueous decoction of the air-dried and pulvarized I. indigotica root was concentrated under reduced pressure and separated by column chromatography (CC) over macroporous adsorbent resin (HPD-110), eluting successively with H 2 O, 50% EtOH, and 95% EtOH, to yield three corresponding fractions A, B and C. Fraction C was subjected to CC over silica gel, with elution using a gradient of increasing acetone concentration (0e100%) in petroleum ether, to afford fractions C1eC11 [20] . Fraction C9 was separated successively by CC over Sephadex LH-20, reversed phase silica gel (C 18 ), and silica gel to give a mixture, from which CI -39 was isolated by HPLC using a semipreparative C18 column (see Experimental section 4.1.1). Compound CI -39 was obtained as colorless prisms in acetone. Its IR spectrum showed the presence of amino (3247 cm À1 ), ester and amide carbonyl (1701 and 1677 cm À1 ), and aromatic ring (1585 and 1511 cm À1 ) functionalities in the molecule. Combinatory analysis of HRMS(ESIþ) and NMR spectroscopic data led to determination of the molecular formula as C 19 H 18 N 2 O 4 . In the molecular, the occurrence of a 3-substituted indole nucleus, an orthosubstituted benzene ring, two methoxy groups, an isolated methylene, and two ester and amide carbonyl carbons was deduced from analysis of the NMR spectroscopic data ( Table 1 ). The connection of these structural units was further established by the 2D NMR experimental data as illustrated in Fig. 1B . Briefly a linkage between the indole nucleus and one carbonyl carbon via the methylene unit to form a 2-(1H-indol-3-yl)acetyl moiety was unambiguously H COSY  spectrum as well as the two-and three-bond heteronuclear correlations from H-2 to C-3, C-3a, C-7a, and C-8 and from H 2 -8 to C-2,  C-3 , C-3a, and C-9 in the HMBC spectrum, along with the chemical shifts of these proton and carbon signals (Fig. 1B) . Location of an methoxyformyl at the ortho-substituted benzene ring to construct an methyl ortho-substituted benzoate moiety was deduced from the 1 He 1 H COSY coupling correlations of H-3 0 /H-4 0 /H-5 0 /H-6 0 and the long-range HMBC correlations from H-3 0 to C-1 0 and C-5 0 and from H-6 0 to C-2 0 , C-4, and C-7 0 as well as from OCH 3 to C-7 0 . To satisfy the requirement of the molecular composition, the remaining methoxy unit must be located at the N atom of the 2-(1H-indol-3-yl)acetyl moiety, in turn which must link via an amide bond to the only opened position of the methyl ortho-substituted benzoate moiety. The deduction was finally proved by X-ray diffraction analysis of a suitable single crystal crystallized in the acetone solution of CI -39, an ORTEP drawn of the crystal structure shown in Fig. 1C . Thus, the structure of CI -39 was determined as methyl (1-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)acetamidobenzoate. According to clinic application of "Ban lan gen" (I. indigotica root) in traditional Chinese medicine [17] , anti-viral activity of CI -39 was assayed using cell-based protocols as reported in our previous publications [20e34,56] The synthesis of CI -39 is shown in Scheme 1. Methyl 2-(2-(1Hindol-3-yl)acetamido)benzoate (CI-a) was obtained through an amidation reaction of indole-3-carboxylic acid with 2aminobenzoate. Methyl 2-(2-(indolin-3-yl)acetamido)benzoate (CI-b) was prepared through reduction using trifluoroacetic acid and triethylsilane [57] . The oxidation of CI-b was carried out by sodium tungstate and hydrogen peroxide to produce methyl 2-(2-(1-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl)acetamido)benzoate (CI-c) [58] . Then, the methylation of CI-c with trimethylsilyldiazomethane produced CI -39. With the synthesized CI -39, inhibitory activities against RT RNA-dependent DNA polymerase [59] and ribonuclease H [60] were detected, along with an activity test against VSVG/HIV-1 replication [56] . The result (Table 3) indicated that CI -39 was an inhibitor of the RT RNA-dependent DNA polymerase with the IC 50 value of 7.20 mM, but inactive to ribonuclease H (IC 50 > 30 mM).
