The synthesized carbocyclic C-nucleosides 1-4 were tested for anti-HIV activity as well as cytotoxicity using AZT as the positive control, and the results are summarized in Table 1 . Anti-HIV activity was determined in  ND, not determined. human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells infected with HIV-1 (strain LAI). Among the synthesized nucleosides, only 9-deazaneplanocin A (1) showed moderate anti-HIV-1 activity (EC 50 2.0 lM) and the other compounds did not display any anti-HIV activity. Compounds 1-4 were also evaluated against a wide variety of viruses, including vaccinia, cowpox, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Punta Toro virus, West Nile virus, yellow fever, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, Tacaribe, Venezulean equine encephalitis, Dengue, and hepatitis C. Compounds 2 (EC 50 2.5 lM) and 4 (EC 50 65 lM) showed moderate activity against Punta Toro virus (strain Adames, LLC-MK2 cell line) without any cytotoxicity. Compound 3 was slightly active against West Nile virus (New York isolate) (EC 50 11 lM) and compound 4 (EC 50 49 lM) showed marginal activity against SARS-CoV ( Table 2) . None of other compounds showed any antiviral activity against all other tested viruses. In summary, enantioselective synthesis of purine and pyrimidine cyclopentenyl C-nucleosides 1-4 was achieved from the common key intermediate 5, which was prepared from commercially available D D-ribose. Synthesized compounds were tested as potential antiviral agents. However, only 9-deazaneplanocin A (1) exhibited moderate anti-HIV activity.
