The Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated no significant difference (P-values <0.05) between observed and reported cases with a median difference of approximately 1.2 weeks between the date of observation and reporting (8 days) . Therefore, we decided to use the reporting date series for all temporal analyses, in which the final count of cases matched those of both WHO and MoH databases for the GCC countries, because in 20.8% of cases the observation date information was missing. Results of the sensitivity analyses for handling peaks with more than 20 cases, as described above, suggests that all of the three methods produced similar results. Therefore, we decided to select the method (a) for all of the three Saudi regions due to its simplicity and epidemiological plausibility.
