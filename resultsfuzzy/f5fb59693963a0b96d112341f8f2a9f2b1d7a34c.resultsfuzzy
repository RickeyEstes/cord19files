Given that the STZ-diabetic mice have decreased level of Miro1 expression in islets, we created Miro1 ablation mice in the islets (IKO) (Supplementary Figure 1) and subjected them to a diabetic condition. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and quantification showed that the average islet size of IKO pancreas was larger approximately by 114.5% compared to floxed pancreas ( Figure 2A , left and right). In response to HFD treatment, IKO mice significantly increased body weight during 4 to 24 weeks compared to mouse-specific Miro1flox / flox (Floxed) mice ( Figure 2B ). However, there was no significant difference in the level of energy intake between floxed and IKO mice (Supplementary Figure 2) , thus eliminating the lack of Miro1-deficient as a cause of lower body weight in mice. With regard to the effect of islets Miro1 on insulin resistance, We observed fasting blood glucose (FBG) ( Figure 2C ), fasting serum insulin (FINS) levels ( Figure 2D -2E) and homeostasis model assessment of the insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) ( Figure 2F ). After HFD treatment, these levels were significantly higher in IKO mice than those in the floxed group. In addition, compared with the NC group, in intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test assays, the area under the curve was increased in IKO mice, and these effects in floxed significantly improved ( Figure 2G-2H) . Taken together, we find that reduction Miro1 results in obesity and disturbs insulin release in mice.
