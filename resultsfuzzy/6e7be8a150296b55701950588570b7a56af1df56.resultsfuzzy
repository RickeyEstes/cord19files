The ability of MHV-JHM infection to influence T cell infiltration was evaluated. Following MHV infection, lymphocytes begin to enter the brain about day 5 with their numbers peaking at about day 7 when virus-specific cytolytic CD8 T cells are apparent (Castro et al., 1994; Marten et al., 2001) . Therefore, mononuclear cells were isolated from infected brains on day 7 and stained to distinguish CD8, CD4, and NK1.1 cells. MHV-JHMinfected brains yielded approximately a 2.5-fold decrease in the percentage of CD8 T cells within the infiltrating cell population as compared to MHV-A59-infected brains. The lack of a difference in the percentage of CD4 T cells and NK T cells within the brains suggested that they contributed less than CD8 T cells to the observed differences in pathology (Fig. 3) . Unlike IFNh, IFNg is critical in MHV clearance (Marten et al., 2001; Parra et al., 1999; Schijns et al., 1998) . Thus, the capacity of CD8 T cells to produce IFNg was also examined by intracellular staining. Mononuclear cells isolated from infected brains were stimulated with a control peptide or viral peptides (S510 or S598). Whether other epitopes exist on the MHV-A59 background is currently unknown (Marten et al., 2001) . As previously demonstrated (Castro et al., 1994) , the S510 epitope was immunodominant in MHV-JHM infection (Fig. 4A ). CD8 cells from MHV-JHM-infected brains also exhibited a greater response against the S598 epitope compared to cells from MHV-A59infected brains (Fig. 4B ). Anti-CD3 activates antigen-experienced cells (Yee et al., 1994) and was used to characterize the ability of total CD8 T cell population, which entered the brain in response to infection, to produce IFNg. To evaluate the relationship between the anti-CD3 and viral peptide stimulations, the percentages of IFNg+ CD8 T cells observed following these stimulations were compared (Fig.  4C ). MHV-JHM infection resulted in similar percentages of IFNg+ CD8 T cells in response to either anti-CD3 (21.5%) or known viral peptides (24.2%), resulting in a viral/anti-CD3 ratio of 1:1. In contrast, following MHV-A59 infection, only about 0.29 of the anti-CD3 response reflected that of the viral peptide S598. Furthermore, the reduced number of CD8 T cells in the brain following MHV-JHM infection decreased the potential for IFNg production within the CNS. When the percentage of IFNg+ cells within the intact mononuclear gate was assessed, there was about a 3-fold lower percentage of IFNg+ cells from MHV-JHM, as compared to MHV-A59, infected brain (Fig. 4D ). The diminished CD8 T cell presence in MHV-JHMinfected brains may reflect a microenvironment that does not augment CD8 T cell infiltration into the CNS. Alterna- Fig. 5 . Enhanced CD8 T cell apoptosis is seen following MHV-JHM infection. Cells isolated from infected brains were stained with anti-CD8 and Annexin V. Histograms shown were gated on CD8-positive cells. Control panel represents cell sample (from MHV-JHM-infected brains) in the absence of Annexin V staining. One representative experiment of three is shown. The intensity of Annexin V staining of negative population from control to sample is consistent with the assay parameters of the manufacturer. tively, or in addition, this microenvironment may support enhanced CD8 T cell apoptosis (Fig. 5) . This possibility was examined by staining cells isolated from MHV-JHM-and MHV-A59-infected brains with anti-CD8 and Annexin V. In three independent experiments, CD8 T cells from MHV-JHM-infected brains exhibited enhanced apoptosis com-pared to CD8 T cells from MHV-A59-infected brains (18.0 F 1.7 vs. 10.7 F 2.1; P < 0.05).
