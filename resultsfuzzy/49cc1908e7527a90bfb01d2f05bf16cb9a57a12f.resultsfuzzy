(2) The reform variables vary across time and province. (3) Sources: Woo et al. (2002) . In all models I expect correlation of observations for individual in the same province. Accordingly cluster robust standard errors that cluster on the province are reported. These do not alter the parameter estimates, but do lead to considerably larger standard errors and smaller t statistics. In the case of the FE logit estimator, a cluster bootstrap is used to get the cluster robust standard errors. 9 Results are summarized as follows. The reform variables (''Collective 2''), interaction terms (SOE*Open Degree 1, Collecti ve*Open Degree 1) are negative and statistically significant at 5% in all models using the full sample. Fixed effects model (Table 5 column 2 and column 4) also gives statistically significant estimates for three more interaction terms (Collective*Open Degree 2, Reg*Open Degree 1, and Reg*Open Degree 2). On one hand, declining insurance coverage were strongly associated with economic reforms. On the other hand, the statistical significance of the interaction terms indicates the gap between SOE and non SOE workers, collective and non collective workers, and urban rural areas were shrinking. This is consistent with Fig. 1 where SOE and collective workers had the largest decline in insurance coverage whereas others had relatively small decline or even a slightly increase. Work unit type indicators are statistically significant at 5% in all models, which indicates strong association between welfare and employment status. These results add to the literature the specific effects of reforms on health insurance coverage and hope to shed light on whether gaps in welfare benefits between different types of workers have changed in a more economically open society. For individual control variables, results are not directly comparable to Akin et al. (2004) since they estimate each year (1989, 1991, 1993 and 1997) as cross section instead of treating it as panel and their estimates varies by year. But they do find significant results for the type of employers (state or collective) that is consistent with our model. Compare to Hu et al. (1999) that include relatively few regressors (no income and health status in their regression), gender and age are statistically significant in their model, but not ours. Instead, I found marital status, education and household income as impor tant predictors of health insurance. A robust version of the Hausman test using the auxiliary OLS regression proposed by Wooldridge (2002) rejects (c 2 42.15) the random effects model in favor of the fixed effects model. The discus sion and conclusion in the following sections are based on the results of the fixed effects linear model clustering at the province level.
