Initial measurements on d 0 of phase 1 did not differ (Table 2) . No preweaning measurements differed. Postweaning starter intake (2.13 vs. 2.00 kg/d) and ADG (0.94 vs. 0.86 kg/d) were greater (P < 0.01) for TUL than CON. Overall ADG (0.69 vs. 0.66 kg/d) and final BW (78.0 vs. 77.6 kg) were greater (P < 0.05) for TUL than CON. Medical treatment d did not differ. For CON, there were 5 calves treated for navel infections and 2 calves treated for BRD (symptoms were nasal discharges with fever and lethargy). For TUL, there were 6 calves treated for navel infections and 1 calf treated for BRD (a symptom of nasal discharge). All navel infections were identified and treatments began on d 0. No abnormal breathing sounds were detected by auscultation on d 28, 42, or 56. Abnormal fecal score also did not differ. All fecal samples from calves with abnormal feces tested positive for Cryptosporidium and Rotavirus. During phase 2, DMI did not differ; however, DMI as a percentage of BW (2.97 vs. 2.81% of BW) was greater (P < 0.01) for CON than TUL (Table 3) . Calf ADG (1.21 vs. 1.08 kg/d), final BW (137.8 vs. 145.8 kg), feed efficiency (0.369 vs. 0.331 G:F), and hip width change (5.5 vs. 4.8 cm) were greater (P < 0.03) for TUL than CON. Over the 112 d of both phases, the difference in BW was 9.0 kg (9%) of BW (106.4 kg for TUL and 97.4 kg for CON) and 0.8 cm (8%) for hip width change (10 cm for TUL and 9.2 cm for CON). Stressors are a trigger of disease in calves through their effect on cortisol and various cytokines, and stressors occur frequently in the first 2 mo of life (Hulbert and Moisá, 2016) . Significant stressors in the life of a calf include castration, dehorning, weaning, commingling, and vaccina-tion (Hulbert and Moisá, 2016) , and these stressors frequently occur after 3 wk of age when respiratory disease is most prevalent. Stressors combined with the presence of viruses allow bacterial colonization of the lungs and are a typical reason for the onset of respiratory disease (Yates, 1982) . A common outcome of BRD in calves is decreased weight gain and wither height. Indeed, Stanton et al. (2010) showed that calves that developed BRD before 8 wk of age experienced decreased weight gain and wither height. Detection can be difficult but critical to treatment, and recovery from the disease can affect performance later in life. This was demonstrated in a study with 795 Holstein calves where identification and treatment of disease before 2 mo of age improved first-and subsequent-lactation milk production (Heinrichs and Heinrichs, 2011) . Calves in the current trial faced many stressors including a 3.5-h transport from their birth farm to the research facility, several vaccinations, castrating, dehorning, weaning, and commingling. Over the 112 d on trial, the calves appeared healthy based on the few illnesses identified. Navel infections on d 0 were the predominate illness identified. These infections were evenly distributed between CON and TUL calves. All but one calf with a navel infection did not have iodine-stained hair around their navels as calves did without navel infections; thus, source-farm personnel likely did not properly dip their navels at birth. In the studies by Stanton et al. (2010 Stanton et al. ( , 2012 Stanton et al. ( , 2013 , calves previously treated for respiratory disease had decreased growth and increased mortality rates later in life than calves not treated for respiratory disease. Stanton et al. (2013) compared metaphylactic treatment with TUL at approximately 3 d of age with no treatment and reported that calves treated with TUL had a lower incidence of diarrhea, otitis media, and an approximately 4% increase in BW gain (0.02 kg/d) between 3 d and 2 mo of age. Stanton et al. (2010 Stanton et al. ( , 2012 reported that ADG and height gain was not altered by TUL versus oxytetracycline treatment at approximately 2 mo of age in calves that had a respiratory disease before approximately 3.2 mo of age. However, in calves without disease, ADG (0.13 kg/d) and withers height gain (0.04 cm/d) were increased by TUL versus oxytetracycline metaphylactic treatment. Our improvement in both BW gain and hip width gain between TUL and CON was consistent with the report by Stanton et al. (2010 Stanton et al. ( , 2012 . Stanton et al. (2012) followed the same group of calves from their 2010 study to 13 mo of age and found that calves never treated for respiratory disease maintained heavier BW at 3, 6, 9, and 13 mo of age if treated metaphylactically with TUL versus oxytetracycline. However, the effect of TUL on withers height growth after approximately 3 mo of age was uncertain, but wither heights of all calves (healthy and sick) were greater at 9 mo with TUL versus oxytetracycline treatment. Stanton et al. (2012 Stanton et al. ( , 2013 attributed improvements in growth to reduction of disease in calves. In our studies, the identification of disease was low. We speculate that that there was some level of BRD that was not identified and that TUL may have reduced subclinical disease to allow for more BW and structural growth. In our trial, healthy calves gained approximately 8% more BW and hip width from 3 d to 4 mo of age. In the trials by Stanton et al. (2010 Stanton et al. ( , 2012 Stanton et al. ( , 2013 , healthy calves experienced improved BW and structural growth in the first 3 mo of age when metaphylactically administered TUL. Growth experienced in the first 3 mo of life appeared to be maintained to approximately 12 mo of age in the study by Stanton et al. (2012) . Because our calves appeared healthy and the medical treatments of CON were low, medical treatments for disease were not affected
