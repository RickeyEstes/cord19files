Expression, purification, and proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro 3CLsm was successfully over-expressed in E. coli. Most of the target protein was found in the soluble fraction of the cell lysate. About 20 mg of 3CLsm protein was recovered from 1 liter LB media. When 3CLsc was expressed in E. coli, the product had a similar apparent molecular mass to that of 3CLsm (see Fig. 1 ). It indicated that an auto-cleavage had occurred during 3CLsc expression. The activity of the recombinant 3CLsm was analyzed in peptide-based trans-cleavage assay in which 3CLsm (2 lg) was incubated with 400 lM peptide P439 in 40 ll buffer D. Analysis of the reaction products by reverse-phase HPLC and mass spectrum revealed that P439 could be hydrolyzed. As shown in Fig. 2A , more than half of the substrate was digested in 20 min.
