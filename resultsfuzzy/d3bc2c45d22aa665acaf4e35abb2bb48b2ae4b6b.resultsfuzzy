Regression analysis results of the extract yield using mixture design analysis are shown in Supplementary Table S1. The coefficient of determination (R 2 ) for the extract yield model was 99.85%, and the adjusted R square (adj R 2 ) was 99.65%, reflecting the suitability of the model (Supplementary Table S1 ). The suitability of the model is an essential part of data analysis components, and thus, variance analysis was conducted as shown in Supplementary Table S1 to verify not only the suitability of the reaction model, but also the significance and coefficient of each term (Supplementary Table S1 ). From interacting terms, p values of R. crenulata × A. membranaceus and R. crenulata × P. quinquefolia were 0.004 and 0.0001, respectively, reflecting the greatest significance in the reaction model of this experiment. The contour lines for the mixture showed a decreasing trend in yield with an increase in the mixing ratio of R. crenulata and in contrast, an increasing trend in the yield with increases in the mixing ratios of P. quinquefolia and A. membranaceus ( Fig. 2A) . The results of regression analysis for the amount of NO produced using the mixture design analysis are shown in Supplementary Table  S2 . The R 2 for the NO production model was 92.85%, and the adj R 2 was 83.91%, reflecting the suitability of the model (Supplementary Table S2 ). The suitability of the model is an essential part of data analysis; thus, variance analysis was conducted as shown in Supplementary Table S2 to verify not only the suitability of the reaction model but also the significance and coefficient of each term. In interacting terms, all p values were higher than 0.05 and thus were not statistically significant, reflecting the lack of interaction between independent variables. The contour lines for NO production by mixture showed an increasing trend in the production of NO, an immunologic factor, as the mixing ratio of R. crenulata increased, but a decreasing trend in NO production as the mixing ratios of P. quinquefolia and A. membranaceus increased, suggesting that A. membranaceus and P. quinquefolia did not greatly affect NO production compared with R. crenulata (Fig. 2B) . The results of regression analysis for IL-6 production are shown in Supplementary Table S3 . The R 2 for the IL-6 production model was 98.61%, and the adj R 2 was 96.87%, reflecting the suitability of the model (Supplementary Table S3 ). The suitability of the model was further verified with variance analysis as shown in Supplementary Table S3 to verify not only the suitability of the reaction model but also the significance and coefficient of each term (Supplementary Table S3 ). From interacting terms, the p value for R. crenulata × P. quinquefolia was 0.006, reflecting the greatest significance in the reaction model for this experiment. The contour lines for IL-6 production showed an increasing trend in the production of IL-6, an important cytokine in the immune response, as the mixing ratio of R. crenulata increased, but a decreasing trend in IL-6 production as the mixing ratios of P. quinquefolia and A. membranaceus increased, suggesting that A. membranaceus and P. quinquefolia did not greatly affect IL-6 production compared with R. crenulata (Fig. 2C) .
