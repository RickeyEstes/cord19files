To improve performance of the predictor of drug-target interaction, feature selection process was carried out. The first step of feature selection is feature evaluation. In this study, mRMR was used to evaluate every feature in original feature set. Listed in Online Supporting Information S5 are two kinds of outputs: the first one is the MaxRel list which shows ranks of features for their relevance to the target; the second is mRMR list showing the mRMR ranks according to the feature order satisfying Eq. 3. In this study, only the mRMR list was used as the results of feature evaluation. Since there are four groups of samples, mRMR was run four times with each for one of them. With the four mRMR lists, IFS was processed for each of the four sample groups, generating four IFS curves. Based on these results, we set k in FFS to be 16, 15, 14 and 19 for the data of enzymes, ion channels, GPCRs and nuclear receptors, respectively. Each of these figures is the index of the point of the first maximum value in the corresponding IFS curve. Shown in Fig. 1 are the four IFS curves with their corresponding FFS curves. The peaks of the four FFS curves finally reach the overall success rates of 85.48% with 32 features, 80.78% with 37 features, 78.49% with 30 features, and 85.66% with 32 features for enzyme group, ion channel group, GPCR group and nuclear receptor groups, respectively. Features selected by mRMR+FFS for the four different groups are quite different from each other, showing the intrinsic differences between them. Although there are more features for target than those for drug in the original feature set, more drug features were selected, showing the important role of drugs. Many of the selected target features are for protein secondary structure, especially for enzyme group (half of selected target features are for this). All types of features are selected in at least one group, showing that all biochemical and physicochemical features have their irreplaceable positions in drug-target interaction process. For the details of the optimal feature-set outputs by FFS for the four benchmark datasets, see the Online Supporting Information S6.
