3.1. SYBR Green I Real-Time PCR. 10-fold serial plasmid dilutions were tested and used to construct the standard curve. The generated standard curve covered a linear range of 3.93 × 10 2 to 3.93 × 10 6 copies/ L for HP-PRRSV and 8.56 × 10 2 to 8.56 × 10 6 copies/ L for PRRSV. Both standard curves had a slope of −3.410 to −3.443 and an efficiency of 1.964 to 1.952, which indicate a high PCR efficiency of the experiment (Figures 2(a) and 2(b) ). The amplification with primers NSP2-qF and NSP2-qR yielded 85 bp and 172 bp amplified product within NSP2 of both HP-PRRSV (GD) and PRRSV (CH-1a), respectively (Figure 1) , which was sufficient to discriminate between melting peaks of the two PRRSV strains. The mean and standard deviation of Tm of HP-PRRSV and PRRSV were 85.17 ± 0.12 ∘ C and 87.27 ± 0.07 ∘ C, respectively (Figure 3(b) ). GD HP-PRRSV strain, and only the HEX fluorescent signal could be observed in the template of CH-1a PRRSV strain ( Figure 4) . However, when Pb-N (HEX) and Pb-all (FAM) were combined in a duplex real-time PCR system, only HEX fluorescent signal could be observed when the template was CH-1a PRRSV strain, and FAM fluorescent signal could be observed when the templates were GD and CH-1a strains (Figure 4 ).
