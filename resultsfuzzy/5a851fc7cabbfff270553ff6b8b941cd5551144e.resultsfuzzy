This work sought to identify smaller but folded SARS-CoV spike fragments for use as possible antigen or vaccine candidates. Compared with linear short peptides derived from the protein, folded fragments may be advantageous as they have the potential to provide discontinuous epitopes. The SARS-CoV spike gene was digested by DNase I to generate a pool of short DNA segments, followed by an additional step of reassembly of these segments to produce a library of DNA fragments with random ends [10, 11] . This is in part analogous to the DNA shuffling protocol [12, 13] , but the purpose here is not to produce full-length hybrids from a group of different parental genes, but to generate various smaller DNA fragments from a single template gene. The reassembly step following the DNase I treatment is necessary to prepare a large number of DNA sequences with controlled lengths, which was achieved by tailoring the number of PCR cycles used in the reassembly (see Methods). To screen for discrete folded polypeptide fragments, the reassembled gene fragments were further cloned into a vector as Nterminal fusions to a folding reporter gene which was a variant of the green fluorescent protein that exhibits strong fluorescence upon UV excitation [9] . GFP has been shown to be an effective indicator for the foldability of the upstream polypeptide partner [4, 5] . The vector construction is shown in Fig. 1 . Among about 4300 clones screened, 230 clones were found to be fluorescent (see Fig. 2a ). These clones were then subjected to rapid colony PCR analysis. Many of the fluorescent clones were found to contain vectors with SARS spike gene fragments smaller than 100 base pairs (bp). In addition, some others (a total of 20) contained vectors with inserts in the reverse orientation or not in frame as indicated by sequencing. The SDS-PAGE results showed that the peptides encoded by these gene inserts were degraded in the corresponding fusion proteins (data not shown). Finally, the two inserts larger than 150 nucleotides or 50 deduced amino acid (aa) residues that were identified were ssPtu-15 (residues 1118-1175 of the original protein) and ssPtu-16 (residues 1129-1186). The expression of these fragments (in the GFP-fusion form) was further examined by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Figs. 2b and 2c , the fragments were partially soluble when expressed at 23℃. Higher temperatures significantly reduced the amount of soluble protein (data not shown). Widely disparate virus families have been shown to contain two hepated repeat (HR) regions, which play a critical role in viral fusion with the target cell [14, 15] . Often, one N-terminal HR region (HR1) is adjacent to the cell fusion peptide while a C-terminal HR region (HR2) is close to the transmembrane anchor. The SARS fragment ssPtu-15 isolated in this work overlaps with the HR2 (residues 1147-1185) of the SARS-CoV spike protein [16] , while fragment ssPtu-16 contains the whole SARS HR2 (Fig. 3a) . A hydrophobic cluster analysis [17] of these two fragments showed two significant hydrophobic clusters (Figs. 3b, 3c, and 3d) . Presumably, these clusters play a role in the stability and oligomeric specificity of the HR2 structure [18] . In addition, compared with the wild-type sequence, both of the fragments contain a mutation at 1163 (K replaced by E). ssPtu-16 also contains a second mutation at 1151 (from I to T), while ssPtu-15 contains a second mutation at 1157 (S substituted by Y). These mutations are likely a result from the fragment reassembly process. The mutation at 1163 seems to increase the helicity of the fragments. Interestingly, our more recent dissection studies with other proteins rarely resulted in mutations. [7] , peptides HR2, GST-HR2-38, GST-HR2-44 [8] , peptides SHR2-1, SHR2-2, SHR2-8, and SHR2-9 [6] .
