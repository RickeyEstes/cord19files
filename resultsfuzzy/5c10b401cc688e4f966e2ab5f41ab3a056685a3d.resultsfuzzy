The role of NC sequences in type specificity was investigated for the NS segment of the most divergent type A and C influenza viruses using reverse genetics systems [19] [20] [21] . A set of type A and type C chimeric viruses was generated, in which one or both type-specific extremities of the NS segment were totally or partially replaced by their counterpart from type C or type A virus, respectively (Figure 1) . In a type C backbone, no virus was rescued when one or both type A extremities were introduced, and only the wild-type 5'C/3'C virus was recovered (Figure 1 ). In a type A backbone (Figure 1 ), no virus harbouring the type C 5'end (5'C/3'C and 5'C/3'A) was rescued. Only viruses with a type A 5' end (5'A/3'A and 5'A/3'C) could be rescued, but a C-to-U mutation in the 3'C proximal sequence was systematically observed at nucleotide 5 (5'A/3'C(C5U)). Introduction of this reverse substitution into the wild-type 5'A/3'A construct (to generate 5'A/3'A(U5C)) systematically led to a wild-type uracil reversion, confirming the importance of this position. Minigenome experiments previously showed that this position did not modify the transcription/replication processes [10] . Interestingly, this mutation in 5'A/3'C, leading to 5'A/3'C(C5U), restored a proximal panhandle sequence identical to that of the wild-type 5'A/3'A. To demonstrate the necessity of the type specific proximal panhandles to recover viruses, chimeric heterotypic ends were created to include proximal panhandles homotypic of the reverse genetics backbone. Both type A and C viruses with 5' and 3' modified NS ends (5'C/3'C-proxA and 5'A/3'A-proxC, respectively) were rescued as efficiently as wild-type viruses (Figure 1 ). The fact that the proximal panhandle of the unsuccessful constructs is not homotypic strongly suggested that a homotypic proximal panhandle is required. All rescued type C and A viruses were plaque-purified and subsequently amplified in SK and MDCK cells, respectively. Kinetics assays at low multiplicity-of-infection (m.o.i.) were then performed in the respective cell types. No difference was observed for type C viruses; wild-type and 5'A/3'A-proxC grew with similar efficiencies (Figure 2A) . The three rescued type A [20, 21] . The introduced mutation in 5'A/3'A(U5C) is underlined. The sequence of both ends of each segment of each rescued virus was verified as described [10] , and no mutation was detected except at position 5 in the 3' end for 5'A/3'C and 5'A/3'A(U5C) yielding viruses 5'A/ 3'C(C5U) and 5'A/3'A, respectively (indicated by arrows). In constructs 5'A/3'A-proxC in the type C system and 5'C/3'C-proxA in the type A system, only the distal panhandle was modified, but the homotypic proximal panhandle was conserved. The energy barriers of the canonical pairs C:G and U:A, and of the wobble base pair G:U (represented by a black dot) were described by Vendeix et al [34] and were used to calculate a score to evaluate the panhandle strength. The proximal panhandle consists of 9 potential basepairs, when the distal panhandle was defined to include the potential base-pairs up to the type A poly-U signal. Type C reverse genetics was performed in 293T cells and supernatants were collected and titrated at day 10 post-transfection (p.t.). Type A reverse genetics was performed in a co-culture of 293T and MDCK cells, and supernatants were collected and titrated at 72h p.t. Titers in PFU/ml are the mean of 2 to 4 independent experiments. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0081550.g001 viruses replicated to similar final titers, although both 5'A/ 3'C(C5U) and 5'C/3'C-proxA were slightly delayed ( Figure 2B) . Overall, these results indicated that the major packaging signals were not located within the distal panhandle sequence, since it was possible to rescue the 5'A/3'C(C5U) virus. Thus, the distal sequence of the type C 3' end was not restrictive for NS segment packaging. This is in agreement with published data showing that NS segment packaging does not require wild-type 3' end sequences [26] . The putative effect of modifying the extremities on the transcription and replication steps was then studied at an early stage of the viral cycle for the three rescued type A viruses. Levels of mRNA and vRNA were analyzed by RT-qPCR [23] at 6 hours post infection (h.p.i.) at high m.o.i., using RT primers specific for mRNA or vRNA ( Figure 3A ). Crossing point values were used to evaluate the relative level of both processes, by calculating an mRNA/vRNA ratio. Compared to wild-type 5'A/ 3'A, significant differences (p<0.05) were found only for 5'A/ 3'C(C5U), but not for 5'C/3'C-proxA. Interestingly, the CpmRNA/CpvRNA ratio for 5'A/3'C(C5U) was higher than for wild-type 5'A/3'A for all segments, meaning that either more vRNA or less mRNA was synthesized for 5'A/3'C(C5U). The sole difference between 5'A/3'C(C5U) and wild-type 5'A/3'A viruses being the 3' distal extremity of the NS segment suggested that the level of NS encoded proteins (i.e. NS1 or/and NS2/NEP) was affected at early stages of infection for this virus (5'A/3'C(C5U)). Western-blot was used to evaluate the amount of NS encoded proteins two hours before the observed effect. The amount of NP protein was used to normalize the results. At 4 h.p.i. at high m.o.i., only 5'A/ 3'C(C5U) showed a clear increase in the production of NS1 protein, as indicated by a higher NS1/NP ratio ( Figure 3B ). The putative roles of the proteins encoded by the NS segment in viral transcription and replication have been documented: (i) inactivation of NS1 protein reduces the amount of all vRNAs without affecting the amount of mRNAs [27] ; (ii) NS1 protein counteracts the effect of a polymerase regulating factor, possibly hnRNP-F [28] , that inhibits influenza virus full-length RNA synthesis [29] ; and (iii) NS2/NEP protein reduces transcription and increases replication [30] . The latter role of NS2/NEP could be indirect by stimulating the synthesis of virus-derived small viral RNAs, whose depletion was shown to reduce vRNA synthesis [31] . Thus, the decreased mRNA/ vRNA ratio observed at 6 h.p.i. at high m.o.i. could reflect an increase in replication, which would be consistent with the higher viral titer for 5'A/3'C(C5U) we observed at that time point (5x10 5 vs 1.6x10 7 PFU/ml for wild-type and 5'A/3'C(C5U), respectively). The most likely hypothesis for the increased amount of 5'A/ 3'C(C5U) NS proteins is that the level of transcription was affected and that more mRNA was synthesized for 5'A/ 3'C(C5U) at earlier stages of infection (2-4 h.p.i.). Such a trend, but no significant difference, in NS mRNA quantification after normalization relative to GAPDH was indeed observed between two and four h.p.i. (data not shown). The difference in the base-pairing strength of the distal panhandle formed by the heterotypic extremities in 5'A/3'C(C5U) compared to wild-type, evaluated by scores calculated based on the number and nature of the base-pairs (Figure 1) , could favour the attachment of the polymerase. The stability of the duplex formed by the 5' and 3' ends was indeed shown to be an important parameter for polymerase binding [32] . A weaker distal panhandle for 5'A/ 3'C(C5U) (score 7.39 vs 10.74 for wild-type) could facilitate polymerase binding and/or transcription initiation, resulting in slightly more NS mRNA synthesized. This is further supported by the results for the 5'C/3'C-proxA virus, whose distal panhandle base-pairing score is identical to that of wild-type 5'A/3'A (Figure 1) , and for which NS1 expression levels ( Figure   3B ) and mRNA/vRNA ratios ( Figure 3A ) were similar to those obtained for wild-type. The major role of the proximal panhandle in type specificity that we identified and the hypothesized involvement of the distal panhandle in transcription need to be tested on the other (2 PFU/cell), viral vRNA and mRNA levels for each segment were evaluated by specific two-step RT-qPCRs previously described [23] . Results were expressed as the mean of mRNA/vRNA Cp (crossing-point) ratios calculated on data obtained from 12 independent qPCRs (corresponding to two infections, two independent cDNA syntheses per infection and three independent qPCRs for each cDNA). Statistics were performed using the ANOVA test. Black bars: wild-type 5'A/3'A; hatched bars: 5'A/3'C(C5U); grey bars: 5'C/ 3'C-proxA. (B) Levels of NP and NS1 proteins after infection with the rescued influenza A viruses. Four hours after MDCK infection at a high m.o.i. (2 PFU/cell), cell lysates were analyzed by Western-blot for viral NS1 and NP proteins and for Î²-actin as cellular control. Following chemiluminescence acquisition with a G. Box (SYNGENE, Cambridge, UK), band densities for viral proteins were determined using GeneTools software (SYNGENE, Cambridge, UK), and were used to calculate NS1/NP ratios for each virus. Due to the high levels of viral protein expression during infection, protein extracts were diluted in uninfected cellular extracts prior to electrophoresis. Results are from one representative assay out of three independent infections. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0081550.g003 segments. It is interesting to note that comparison of the distal panhandles formed by the extremities of each segment for a given virus shows differences in base-pairing scores (data not shown). In particular, regardless of the influenza A virus subtype, the distal panhandle of the HA segment was systematically the weakest one. It would be interesting to determine to what extent the distal panhandle base-pairing strength may have an impact on HA expression levels and consequently influence the HA/NA molecule ratio found at the virion surface [33] .
