Expression and purification of EAV nsp9 using two vectors Previously, the purification and de novo polymerase activity of recombinant EAV nsp9 were described (Beerens et al., 2007) . In that study the viral protein (which will be referred to as nsp9/pDEST) was expressed from a pDEST vector with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Typically, an unknown fraction of such bacterially expressed proteins may contain an N-terminal formylmethionine, due to saturation of the endogenous protein processing pathway by nsp9 overexpression. Such an N-terminal extension would not be consistent with the authentic N-terminus of nsp9, which is expected to be a glycine residue derived from the proteolytic release of nsp9 from the pp1ab polyprotein by nsp4-mediated cleavage of the Glu1677↓Gly1678 site . As it was previously reported for SARS-CoV nsp8 and nsp12 that such foreign N-terminal sequences may influence RdRp activity and stability, respectively (te Velthuis et al., 2010a Velthuis et al., , 2012 , we decided to also express EAV nsp9 as part of a ubiquitin fusion protein by using a pASK vector (Gohara et al., 1999; te Velthuis et al., 2010a ) yielding a product that will hereafter be referred to as nsp9/pASK. Co-expression of the ubiquitinspecific protease UBP1, which can remove the N-terminal ubiquitin fusion partner in bacterio, enabled us to reproduce the natural glycine N-terminus of nsp9. An additional advantage of the pASK vector is that it allows expression to be driven by the endogenous pool of E. coli RNA polymerase after induction with anhydrotetracycline. In contrast, nsp9/pDEST was expressed from a T7 promoter. The potential presence of the phage T7 RNA polymerase in the ultimate nsp9 preparations, with previously demonstrated weak RdRp activity (Beerens et al., 2007) , could be of concern. Both recombinant nsp9 variants were expressed under identical culture conditions and batch purified using metal ion chromatography, with Co 2 þ targeting the C-terminal hexahistidine tag of both polypeptides. As Fig. 1A shows, both proteins could be obtained with similar purity, but nsp9/pASK was expressed in higher quantities than nsp9/pDEST. Attempts to further purify the proteins by gel filtration did not result in a significant improvement, as judged by silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels (data not shown). T7 RNA polymerase contamination may account for de novo activity observed with EAV nsp9/pDEST preparations The preparations of nsp9/pDEST and nsp9/pASK were tested side-by-side in a de novo polymerase assay as described before (Beerens et al., 2007) . The only noteworthy difference was the length of the pU template, which was 30 nucleotides in our experiments compared to an undefined mixture containing RNAs of up to 300 nucleotides in the study of Beerens et al. Unfortunately, neither of the nsp9 variants showed any activity on this template. Next, we tested for RdRp activity using a template whose 3 0 -terminal dinucleotide matched the CC dinucleotide that is present immediately upstream of the poly(A) tail at the 3 0 end of the EAV genome. Indeed, as previously shown for homopolymeric pC templates, nsp9/pDEST exhibited some activity with this RNA template, while nsp9/pASK remained essentially inactive (Fig. 1B , middle and left panel, respectively, lanes R 1 ). The nsp9/pDEST protein differed from nsp9/pASK in having an artificial N-terminal residue and in being produced by induction of T7 RNA polymerase expression. We reasoned that the latter feature, expression of an additional polymerase, may be linked to the (gain of) activity observed for the nsp9/pDEST preparation. To test this hypothesis, we included a highly diluted sample (0.01 U/ml final concentration) of a commercially available T7 RNA polymerase in our assays. Since this enzyme is DNA-dependent, we included two single-stranded DNA templates: a DNA variant (D 1 ) of the RNA template used and a DNA template containing the complement of the T7 promoter sequence (D 4 ) . Surprisingly, T7 RNA polymerase was active on all of these templates under the employed conditions (Fig. 1B , right panel) with the expected preference for DNA templates. Strikingly, the nsp9/pDEST preparation showed the same overall pattern, including the preference for DNA templates, as the commercial T7 RNA polymerase. In line with this notion, an nsp9/ pASK preparation gained de novo activity once it was expressed in BL21 (DE3) after addition of IPTG (data not shown). Hence, this circumstantial evidence suggested that contaminating T7 RNA polymerase, rather than EAV nsp9 itself, was responsible for the de novo polymerase activity observed. We investigated whether a gel filtration step with a low flow rate (0.3 ml/min) would remove the suspected trace contamination of T7 RNA polymerase (molecular weight 99 kDa) from a preparation of nsp9/pDEST (molecular weight 78 kDa), but this was not found to be the case (data not shown). In conclusion, our results revealed that the polymerase assay employing 32 P-labeled NTPs, which was used in this and previous studies, is sensitive enough to detect the activity of trace amounts of contaminating T7 RNA polymerase. This polymerase was also able to act on templates lacking the established T7 promoter requirements. Whether or not this contamination was also present in the nsp9 preparations described in Beerens et al. (2007) , and later on also by te Velthuis et al. (2010b) , cannot be established with certainty as the experiments presented here and those published previously differed in some respects. Particularly the previously used purification protocol could not be reproduced in our experiments due to technical difficulties with the described purification buffer, which in our hands induced protein precipitation during purification. Also, the fact that we did not detect any RdRp activity for nsp9/pDEST on a pU template, and therefore also not for any potential contaminant, may argue in favor of the detection of genuine nsp9 activity in those previous studies. In this context, it is noteworthy that thus far the two reported coronavirus RdRp activities (associated with nsp8 and nsp12) were addressed in six independent biochemical studies (Ahn et al., 2012; Imbert et al., 2006; Subissi et al., 2014; te Velthuis et al., 2010a te Velthuis et al., , 2012 Xiao et al., 2012) , none of which succeeded in exactly reproducing the results of any of the others. This may indicate that nidovirus RdRps are highly delicate proteins that may respond to minute changes during purification or in their reaction environment. EAV nsp9/pASK preparations possess primer-dependent polymerase and terminal transferase activity on RNA substrates Besides testing for de novo activity, we analyzed whether EAV nsp9 may possess primer-dependent polymerase activity, like its coronavirus homolog nsp12 (Subissi et al., 2014; te Velthuis et al., 2010a) . We used a similar assay as the one described above, but this time provided partially double-stranded templates. We found that both nsp9 preparations were enzymatically active on these templates and showed the highest extension activity if both the template and primer were RNAs (Fig. 1C, left and middle panel) . The impact of the type of substrate showed that the observed activity correlated directly with the addition of nucleic acid substrates, hence was not based on a co-purified E. coli-derived RNA or DNA substrate. Furthermore, as the presence of a DNA template significantly decreased processivity, it also demonstrated that the responsible polymerase was RNA dependent. Interestingly, while the use of a DNA primer in combination with an RNA template completely precluded extension of the primer (no products in the 20-39 nucleotide size range), a radiolabeled 40-nucleotide product was detected. This suggested that the polymerase possessed terminal transferase activity, but only on RNA substrates. To investigate this further, we also compared the elongation of singlestranded RNA and DNA substrates in an assay otherwise identical to the one used for measuring primer-dependent polymerase activity (Fig. 1D ). As expected, both nsp9 preparations showed a clear selectivity in favor of RNA. In this context, it is also noteworthy that neither the primer extension nor the terminal transferase assay buffer included Mn 2 þ ions, which can favor activity on sub-optimal templates . Together with the demonstrated DNA specificity of T7 RNA polymerase ( Fig. 1C and D, right panels) this supports the reliability of these assays with respect to reproducing physiologically relevant substrate preferences. To conclude the characterization of the polymerase, its nucleotide preference was examined. To this end, a primed RNA template ( Fig. 2A) was first elongated in the presence of a low concentration of radiolabeled ATP, resulting in frequent abortion of transcription after incorporation of the first nucleotide. Subsequently, either dATP or ATP was supplied in a concentration that should allow restarting and completion of the reaction (Fig. 2B ). As expected, addition of ATP enabled the synthesis of almost fully extended products, while dATP did not support any extension beyond one or two nucleotides (Fig. 2C ). In agreement with the lack of DNA primer extension and the known inability of the prototypic poliovirus RdRp to further extend deoxynucleotide chains (Arnold and Cameron, 2004; Gohara et al., 2000) , we thus conclude that the observed activity originated from an RNAdependent RNA polymerase.
