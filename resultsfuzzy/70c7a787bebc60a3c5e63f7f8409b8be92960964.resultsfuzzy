In the literature, the synthesis of 2-phenyl-1,3-(4H)-benzoxazin-4-one 3 (Scheme 1) was carried out from anthranilic acid 1 with benzoyl chloride via an intermediate 2 that cyclizes under the acetic anhydride action, at reflux heating [33] . In this work, we took it back by using reflux heating and microwave irradiation to highlight the efficiency of the latter. Thus, 97% of the product yield was obtained in a few minutes under microwave irradiation against 90% after 2 h of the conventional reflux heating method. Molecules 2018, 23 , 0008 2 of 10 [17, 18] andantibacterial [19] activities, antimuscular contractor and hypnotic activities [20] , anti-fetal activity [21] , antidiabetic and hypolipidemic activity [22] , and as antidepressants [23] . The benzoxazinones were also tested for their inhibitory activity toward human leukocyte elastase [24, 25] , antimalarial, anticancer, and anti-HIV [26, 27] . As benzoxazinones, the 2-benzoylamino-N-phenylbenzamide derivatives can be also used as precursors for both quinazolinone and quinazoline synthesis, and can also present biological and pharmacological activities. The POMs, particularly the heteropolyacids (HPAs), having the Keggin structure, have received much attention for organic synthesis. They are soluble in all the solvents, which allows for the recovery of the synthesized product by simple filtration [28] . Thus, HPAs offer a strong option for efficient and cleaner processes compared to polluting and corrosive liquid acid catalysts, such as mineral acids. Effectively, in previous works, HPAs showed excellent catalytic activities in several reactions as the synthesis of substituted 1,4-diazepines and 1,5-benzodiazepines [29] , 4(3H)-quinazolinones [30] , calix [4] resorcinarenes [31] , and 3,4-dihydropyrimidinones [32] . Among the derivatives of the 2-benzoylamino-N-phenylbenzamide (5a-h) series, 2-benzoylamino-N-phenylbenzamide 5a was synthesized from 2-phenyl-1,3-(4H)-benzoxazin-4-one 3 and aniline in the presence of HPAs series as formula H3PW12O40 (PW12), H4SiW12O40 (SiW12), H3PMo12O40 (PMo12) and H4SiMo12O40 (SiMo12), under microwave irradiation and solvent-free conditions. Then, the most efficient catalyst was used to synthesize all the series of 2-benzoylamino-N-phenylbenzamide derivatives via benzoxazinone3, in the presence of substituted anilines (4a-h).

The 2-phenyl-1,3-(4H)-benzoxazin-4-one 3 compound was used for the 2-benzoylamino-Nphenylbenzamide 5a synthesis from its condensation with aniline 4. The reaction was conducted, under microwave irradiation, in solvent-free conditions, using a series of Keggin-type heteropolyacids, HnXM12O40 (abbreviated as XM12, where X = P or Si and M = W or Mo) (Scheme 2). Results are summarized in Table 1 . The 2-phenyl-1,3-(4H)-benzoxazin-4-one 3 compound was used for the 2-benzoylamino-N-phenylbenzamide 5a synthesis from its condensation with aniline 4. The reaction was conducted, under microwave irradiation, in solvent-free conditions, using a series of Keggin-type heteropolyacids, HnXM 12 O 40 (abbreviated as XM 12 , where X = P or Si and M = W or Mo) (Scheme 2). Results are summarized in Table 1 . 2-Benzoylamino-N-phenylbenzamide yields (Table 1 ) depended on the nature of both the metal atom (W, Mo) and the heteroatom (P, Si) of HPA. Thus, W-based HPAs were more efficient than Mo-based (72-80% against 56-65% of 5a yield). Phosphorus heteroatoms, which make the HPA more active, unlike siliceous heteroatoms, resulted in a yield of 5a of 80% against 72% for W-based HPAs and 65% against 56% for Mo-based HPAs. The results obtained show that the decrease in yield (PW12 > SiW12 > PMo12 > SiMo12) follows that of the acidity strength [34] . Thus, PW12heteropolyacid was chosenas the catalyst to synthesize a series of 2-benzoylamino-N-phenylbenzamide derivatives 5a-h with substituted anilines 4a-h in the same conditions (Scheme 3). The products are obtained in a few minutes. The results are summarized in Table 2 . The aniline substituent group nature shows a strong impact on the yields. Thus, the presence of electron donating groups led to a yield increase. With methyl and hydroxy groups in C6H4, the yields are 85% and 92%, respectively, against 80% for the phenyl. These groups are beneficial because of their high electron density, induced by the aromatic system unlike, the electron withdrawing group as chloro, which led to a yield decrease from 80% to 78%. The presence of a (Table 1 ) depended on the nature of both the metal atom (W, Mo) and the heteroatom (P, Si) of HPA. Thus, W-based HPAs were more efficient than Mo-based (72-80% against 56-65% of 5a yield). Phosphorus heteroatoms, which make the HPA more active, unlike siliceous heteroatoms, resulted in a yield of 5a of 80% against 72% for W-based HPAs and 65% against 56% for Mo-based HPAs.

Thus, PW 12 heteropolyacid was chosenas the catalyst to synthesize a series of 2-benzoylamino-N-phenylbenzamide derivatives 5a-h with substituted anilines 4a-h in the same conditions (Scheme 3).

The presence of a The aniline substituent group nature shows a strong impact on the yields. Thus, the presence of electron donating groups led to a yield increase. With methyl and hydroxy groups in C 6 H 4 , the yields are 85% and 92%, respectively, against 80% for the phenyl. These groups are beneficial because of their high electron density, induced by the aromatic system unlike, the electron withdrawing group as chloro, which led to a yield decrease from 80% to 78%. The presence of a second chlorine atom in the aniline also led to a yield decrease from 78% to 65%. Among dichloroanilines, 2,4-dichloro-C 6 H 3 gave the better yield (73% against 65-70%). This decrease is attributed to the group steric effect. Scheme 4 shows a plausible mechanism of the 2-benzoylamino-N-phenylbenzamide 5a formation in the heteropolyacid presence. The initial step corresponds to the protonation of carbonyl on a Brønsted site of HPA favoring the amine attack that leads to the intermediate I 1 . Thelatter is then deprotonated to give another intermediate I 2 and the released proton is then recovered by the HPA. Finally, a proton transfer from the aniline to the amide nitrogen takes place, thus leading to the final product. It is known that the presence of an electron donating group favors the amine basic character.
