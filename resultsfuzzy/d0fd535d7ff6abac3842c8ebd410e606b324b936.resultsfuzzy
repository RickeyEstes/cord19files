The exposure of the IIIB strain to LPV for >6 months selected for mutations L10F/M46I/I84V in PR. The virus was 21-fold less susceptible to LPV than WT and showed similar resistance to several other PIs. In contrast, parallel selection with the 89.6 strain resulted in V32I/I47A mutations in PR. The selected virus showed 120-fold resistance to LPV and 25-fold resistance to amprenavir (APV), but remained susceptible to saquinavir (SQV). Recombinant I47A virus replicated extremely inefficiently, which precluded its phenotypic characterization. Recombinant V32I remained fit and susceptible to LPV. In contrast, V32I/I47A virus showed reduced susceptibility to LPV and APV, but was hypersensitive to SQV. The V32I/I47A enzyme exhibited 20-fold lower specific activity and 10-fold elevated IC 50 for LPV and APV relative to the WT enzyme. However, no difference in SQV IC 50 was found between the WT and mutant PR. Data from ITC indicate that V32I/I47A affects both the enthalpic ( H) and entropic (âˆ’T S) contributions to the binding of LPV to PR, resulting in >100-fold reduction in binding affinity. Conclusions: V32I/I47A is a novel combination of PR mutations selected by LPV in vitro. Both of these residues are localized to the PR active site, however, our results indicate that I47A should be considered a primary LPV resistance mutation while V32I is likely to have a compensatory effect. Sequential anti-HBV therapy may lead to the selection of complex mutants. We analyzed the genetic and phenotypic evolution of viral quasispecies of a patient who received successively lamivudine (3TC), add-on adefovir (ADV) + 3TC, followed by a 3TC + ADV + Hepatitis B immunoglobulins (HBIg) after liver transplantation. For each sample, a 1142 bp region of the polymerase gene encompassing the RT domain and overlapping the S gene was amplified by PCR and sequenced. At baseline, all HBV genomes carried a wild-type (wt) RT gene but 36% harbored the P120S mutation within the S gene associated with vaccine escape. Following viral breakthrough to 3TC monotherapy, a complex mixture of 3TC-resistant HBV strains (rtL180M + M204V, rtV173L + L180M + M204V and rtM204I mutants) prevailed. After addition of ADV to the ongoing treatment, the viral load dropped, the patient underwent a liver transplantation and received HBIg. As the viral load rose again, the rtN236T mutation emerged in combination with rtV173L + L180M + A181V or rtV173L + L180M + A181V + M204V mutations, and 100% of the HBV genomes harbored the P120S S gene mutation escaping to HBIg. In further samples, HBV strains with the rtV173L + L180M + A181V + N236T mutations prevailed and rtM204I/V mutation disappeared. To get some insights about the combination of rtL180M + M204V and rtN236T mutations, we constructed a rtL180M + M204V + N236T HBV mutant by site-directed mutagenesis from HBV replication-competent plasmid. Hepatoma cell lines were transfected to compare the replication fitness of this strain to wt HBV and their susceptibility to a panel of nucleos(t)ide analogs. The phenotypic analysis of the triple mutant in hepatoma cell lines indicated that it replicates weakly its genome but exhibits resistance to pyrimidine analogs including the combination of 3TC + ADV. This mutant was sensitive in vitro to tenofovir and entecavir. In conclusion, our genetic and phenotypic analysis shows the evolution of the viral quasispecies towards the selection of mutants escaping to multiple selective pressures. This clearly indicates that sequential therapy may select for multiple drug resistant mutants and that de novo combination therapy should be further evaluated to prevent or delay viral drug resistance.
