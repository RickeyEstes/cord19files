roat swabs were collected from all 7 patients. Laboratory testing for common respiratory viruses and respiratory bacteria from the throat swabs was carried out by real-time PCR. e experimental results are shown in Table 3 . Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae are conditional pathogens. ey colonize the upper respiratory tract of normal people. Based on these data and the clinical features, the cause of the outbreak was not these three bacterial species. Stool samples were collected from all 7 patients. Laboratory testing for common pathogens was carried out by real-time PCR. e experimental results are shown in Table 4. After bacterial enrichment culture, strains of Salmonella were obtained from stool samples of the 7 patients. After serotype identification, the bacteria were identified as Salmonella enteritidis. e results of the PFGE experiment show that the homology to S. enteritidis was 100% (Figure 2 ).
