A growing family of viral proteins, named viroporins, is significant in the viral life cycle and has attracted increasing attention from researchers [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Viroporins share common characteristics: they are small proteins with 50-120 amino acids and contain at least one hydrophobic transmembrane domain that oligomerizes in the membrane to form hydrophilic pores. These pores permeabilize membranes by transporting ions or small molecules, and these activities participate in many steps of the viral life cycle, such as the entry, assembly and release of viral particles [12, [32] [33] [34] . As described above, the ORF4a protein possesses the features of viroporins, suggesting that the HCoV-229E ORF4a protein could be a new member of the viroporin family. To confirm this, the correlation between ORF4a expression and virus production was tested. A siRNA specifically targeted to the HCoV-229E ORF4a gene was designed (siORF4a), and its knockdown efficiency was determined using Western blot analysis (Fig. 6A) . The viral infectious particles in the supernatant were titered by TCID 50 assay. As shown in Fig. 6B , the amount of extracellular infectious virus was significantly reduced when 100 pmol siORF4a was used. These results suggested that the ORF4a protein acts as a viroporin and is necessary for HCoV-229E propagation.
