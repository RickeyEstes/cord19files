The average values for PK parameters for TLV in plasma and in blister fluid are shown below. Results: After single intravenous infusions of 750 mg equivalent (eq) ceftobiprole for 30 minutes or 500 mg eq ceftobiprole for 60 minutes, mean Cmax-values at infusion endpoint are 57.9 lg/ mL and 34.2 lg/mL, respectively. The corresponding mean AUC0-inf-values are 154 lg h/mL and 116 lg h/mL. Intersubject variability of the parameters AUC and Cmax of ceftobiprole is below 20%. Mean systemic clearance is 4.9 and 4.5 L/h and mean steady-state volume of distribution is 13.7 and 11.0 L for the 750 mg and 500 mg dosing regimen, respectively. After infusion of 500 mg for 60 minutes or 750 mg for 30 minutes, the ÔTime above MICÕ (target MIC of 4 lg/mL for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is 6 and 7 hours for the total plasma concentrations and 3.5 and 5.2 hours for the corrected unbound plasma concentrations, respectively. With twice-daily administration of 500 mg for 60 minutes or 750 mg for 30 minutes, the proportion of the dosing interval above the MIC of 4 lg/mL, would be 75% and 87% for the total plasma concentrations and 55% and 65% for the unbound plasma concentrations, respectively. Conclusions: Ceftobiprole infusions of 500 mg eq for 60 minutes or 750 mg eq for 30 minutes, results in similar time above target concentration of 4 lg/mL well above the minimum efficacy requirement 25-30% required for MRSA. Methods: The study was a randomized, three-way crossover study with 30 hours wash-out period in 8 healthy volunteers. Each subject received imipenem in three regimens : (i) 0.5 h infusion of 0.5 g every 6 h for 3 doses; (ii) 2 h infusion of 0.5 g every 6 h for 3 doses; (iii) 2 h infusion of 1 g every 6 h for 3 doses. Conclusion: The 2 h infusion of 0.5 or 1 g of imipenem both give greater values for T > MIC than a 0.5 h infusion and that a 2 h infusion may be a useful mode of administration in tropical countries where drug instability may prevent the use of continuous infusion. Post MAP-Bayesian observed-predicted regression and r 2 for serum and CSF were as follows: (serum) observed = 0.984 · predicted + 2.570; r 2 = 0.944. (CSF) observed = 0.785 · predicted + 0.868; r 2 = 0.821. The penetration of cefepime as measured by median AUCcsf/AUC serum was 7.8% (25th-75th percentiles 2.9-21.4%). Results of Serum and CSF Target Attainment analysis for Cefepime 2 g IV Q8H Conclusion: In the setting of non-inflamed meninges, cefepime 2 g IV Q8 h does not provide adequate T > MIC in the CSF for >80% of patients for MICs ‡0.5 mg/L. The influence of inflammation on the calculated CSF target attainment rates is unknown. The definitive pharmacodynamic target in the CSF has not been elucidated and further research is needed. during the studied period ranged from 48.3% (first studied period) to 45.2% (third studied period) for penicillin, 39% (first studied period) to 32.9% (third studied period) for erythromycin, and 32% (first studied period) to 30.3% (third studied period) for clindamycin. Levofloxacin resistance was only found in 2.4% of isolates and were recovered during the third studied period. M phenotype was observed in 3.2% of all tested isolates. Considering non-susceptible erythromycin isolates, ermB and mef genes was found in 87.1% and 9.5% of isolates, respectively, as a sole erythromycin resistance gene. The concomitant presence of both determinants was found in 3.3% of isolates. Interestingly, among the isolates with mef PCR positive result, only one (3.2%) carried the mef(A) gene whereas the mef(E) gene was detected in the others (96.8%). An increase in mef prevalence was observed between the first and the second studied periods (2% to 5.8%) and a slightly decrease (4.9%) in the third period. PFGE analysis revealed a polyclonal structure of mef positive isolates. Conclusions: Prevalence of mef positive isolates among erythromycin-resistant strains remains low in our country (4.3%) being the mef(E) gene the most prevalent mef determinant among these isolates (96.8%). Results: Among young children, single ERY resistance was most prominent in all countries, (from 6% in Sweden to 38% in Belgium), except for Spain where the proportion of dual resistance was highest (33%). For the other countries dual resistance among young children ranged from 0% in Denmark to 13% in Belgium. Except for Ireland (12%) and Spain (21%), single PEN resistance remained below 5%. Conclusion: Between countries, large differences in the patterns of S. pneumoniae resistance were found among young children. ERY resistance was most common among young children, which may indicate greater use of macrolides in this age group. In order to assess the effectiveness of interventions like vaccination, resistance and serotype data should be monitored carefully. The effects of coadministration on the AUC values of POS and each concomitant medication are summarized in the table. Conclusion: No dose adjustments are required for glipizide, zidovudine, lamivudine, indinavir, or ritonavir when coadministered with POS, as the small differences in exposure are not considered clinically significant. However, when POS was given with glipizide, glucose concentrations decreased in some healthy volunteers more so than after glipizide administered alone. Monitoring of cyclosporine and tacrolimus blood levels is warranted with POS coadministration, and dose adjustments of cyclosporine and tacrolimus should be made accordingly. Concomitant use of POS with rifabutin, phenytoin, or cimetidine should be avoided unless the benefits outweigh the risks, due to the decrease in POS concentrations. Objectives: The pharmacokinetics (PK) of many medications may be altered in the elderly population. Because alterations in PK can potentially affect clinical outcomes, the PK parameters of Posaconazole (POS), an extended-spectrum investigational triazole antifungal agent, were examined in healthy elderly persons ( ‡65 years), and the clinical implications of age-related PK differences were evaluated. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of POS steady-state PK data from 5 clinical studies in healthy volunteers. PK data from elderly healthy volunteers were compared with those of elderly patients with invasive fungal infections ( Objective: To develop a bioassay for measurement of CSP blood levels using the hypersusceptible C. albicans cell wall sensor mutant delta-mid2. Methods: The C. albicans mutant delta-mid2 (MIC for CSP: 0.008 mg/L) was constructed by targeted deletion of the gene encoding for a cell wall sensor putatively involved in the maintenance of cell wall integrity. The bioassay was validated according to international guidelines (Shah et al, 2000; FDA, 2001) . Standard curve included 8 CSP concentrations over the range 0.4 to 25 mg/L. Four quality controls were used (0.5, 2, 8, 16 mg/L) to study: i) stability of CSP concentrations over time at different pre-analytical storage conditions, ii) accuracy (measured/nominal value x 100, validation range 85-115%), iii) precision (coefficient of variation: SD/mean of measured values x 100, validation range 15%). The validation procedure included 6 intra-run and 6 inter-run measurements. Results: The limit of detection and quantification was 0.2 and 0.4 mg/L (corresponding to 5 and 10 ng of CSP in a sample volume of 25 ml), respectively. Reproducible standard curves were obtained over the clinically relevant concentration range (0.4 to 25 mg/L) (r ‡ 0.99). Analytical time was 16 h. CSP concentrations with a deviation from nominal values < 15% were measured: i) over 4 days in plasma, and 3 days in whole blood, at 4 C, ii) over 3 and 2 days, respectively, at 21 C, iii) over 6 months in plasma at -80 C, iv) after 5 freeze/thaw cycles. Intra-and inter-run validation with the four quality controls (mean % value, ± SD) are shown in Objective: To identify the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) parameters of antifungal therapy predictive for Intra-and inter-run bioassay validation I Intra (n = 6) Inter (n = 6) Accuracy 93.1 ± 1.9 96.0 ± 2.5 Precision 1.3 ± 1.7 5.8 ± 3.0 invasive fungal infections in patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU).
