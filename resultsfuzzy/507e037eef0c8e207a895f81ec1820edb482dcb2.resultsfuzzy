Pre-and post intervention within-group comparisons were analyzed (see Tables 2 and 3 ). Nursing students in the intervention group reported significantly increased scores on knowledge (KSPQ, from 34.50 ± 4.62 to 41.28 ± 0.93; P < .01), attitudes (ASPS, from 128.81 ± 7.34 to 136.65 ± 6.47; P < .01), and compliance (CSPS, from 62.67 ± 5.88 to 72.55 ± 3.46; P < .01), whereas no significant change was found in the control group. For hand hygiene, both the intervention group (42.9%-95%) and the control group (31.0%-57.5%) performed better at week 6 than the pre intervention level (P < .01 and P < .05, respectively). Posttest comparison between groups was also conducted. At the end of the third session (week 6), the intervention group had significantly higher scores than did the control group on knowledge (KSPQ, 41.28 ± 0.93 vs 35.98 ± 3.87; P < .01), attitudes (ASPS, 136.65 ± 6.47 vs 129.83 ± 8.64; P < .01), and compliance (CSPS, 72.55 ± 3.46 vs 62.63 ± 6.52; P < .01). For hand hygiene, the passing rate in the intervention group (95.0%) was significantly higher than that of the control group (57.5%; P < .01).
