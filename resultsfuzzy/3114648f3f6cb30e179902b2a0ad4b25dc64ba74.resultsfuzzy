Retardation of bacterial growth by SARS-CoV E, 6, and 7a proteins The effect of overexpression of several SARS-CoV proteins containing potential transmembrane domain on bacterial growth was initially tested. For this purpose, nucleotide sequences covering the SARS-CoV E, 3a, 3b, 6, and 7a proteins and HCV E1 protein, respectively, were cloned into pET24a vector, and were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), a strain carrying integrated in the chromosome the T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of a lac UV5 promoter that can be induced by IPTG. HCV E1 protein was chosen as a positive control, as it has been shown to be able to increase membrane permeability when overexpressed in E. coli cells [5] . As shown in Fig. 1A , expression of 3a and 3b proteins rendered no obvious effects on the growth of bacteria, compared with bacterial cells carrying the empty plasmid pET24a. Certain degrees of retardation of bacterial growth were observed in cells expressing the E, 6, and 7a and HCV E1 proteins (Fig. 1A) . The expression of these proteins was then checked by labeling bacterial proteins with [ 35 S]methionine in the presence of rifampicin. , corresponding to the expected His-tagged E, 3a, 3b, and 7a and HCV E1 proteins, respectively. However, no band corresponding to the His-tagged protein 6 (8.5 kDa) was detected (Fig. 1B,  lane 4) . To confirm the expression and identities of these proteins, Western blot analysis was conducted using anti-His antibody. The 9.3-kDa E protein (lane 7), 32-kDa 3a protein (lane 8), 14.8-kDa 7a protein (lane 11), and 21.7-kDa HCV E1 protein (lane 12) were detected, confirming the expression of these proteins. However, the antibody fails to react with the 3b protein (Fig. 1B, lane 9) . The reason for the failure to detect the His-tagged 3b protein is currently uncertain. Once again, no obvious band corresponding to protein 6 was detected (Fig. 1B, lane 10) , indicating the expression of this protein at a very low level in the bacterial cells. As significant inhibition of the growth of bacterial cells carrying this gene was observed (Fig. 1A) , it suggests that the protein may be highly toxic to bacte-ria. This protein was excluded in the subsequent studies. It was also noted that induction of the empty vector, pET24a, affects the growth of bacteria carrying the plasmid, compared with bacteria carrying pET24-3a and pET24-3b (Fig. 1A) . This may reflect the fact that overexpression of the multiple cloning site-His tag region in pET24a might affect bacterial growth.
