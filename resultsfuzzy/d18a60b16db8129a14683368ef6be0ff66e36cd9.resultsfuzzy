In addition to the simulated median, we also present the simulated annual means of the model prediction using the approach described in Camacho et al. (2014) , since simulated means demonstrated fitting results more consistently when the data are being restricted as integers and are subject to stochastic noise. The model fitting results under the new JEV strain invasion scenario are shown in Fig. 6 . The estimated model parameters are summarized in Table 2 . Although the long-term fitting suffers from severe stochastic noise (i.e. zero, one or two cases per month), the 95% simulated quantile interval covers all observed data, and the simulated average annual pattern is consistent with the observed pattern. BIC reduces more than 28 units when we went from the baseline (i.e. no invasion, see S.1.1) scenario to the new strain invasion scenario (see Fig. 6 and explanation I3 in Table 3 ). We modelled another new strain invasion scenario where only the force of infection λ vp is partitioned (see explanation I2 in Table 3 and S.1.3). The BIC increases approximately 1.0 unit which implies an almost equivalent fitting performance to the main results (see Fig. 6 and explanation I3 in Table 3 ). The partitioned force of infection with no partition on spill-over ratio is presented in S.1.3 (see explanation I2 in Table 3 ). Another invasion scenario with time-dependent λ vp and ρ are investigated in S.1.2 (see explanation I1 in Table 3 ) , and BIC increases 4.55 unit. The detailed model performance and explanation of are in Table 3 and Supplementary Information.
