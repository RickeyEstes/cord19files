To determine whether forced PR dimer interactions affect virus assembly and processing, we fused a LZ protein dimerization domain either singly or in tandem repeat to the C-terminus of an HIV-1 Gag-Pol truncated construct (Gag/PR), which is virusassembly competent but processing-defective [23] . The resulting constructs were designated PRWz and PRWWz (Fig. 1) . We used PRKz and PRKKz constructs containing the dimerizationdefective LZ mutant version (Kz) as controls. Kz fusion to PRWz at the wt LZ C-and N-termini yielded constructs PRWKz and PRKWz, respectively. Each mutant was transiently expressed in 293T cells. Virus particle assembly and processing were analyzed by Western immunoblotting. The results shown in Figure 2A indicate that Gag/PR transfectants produced substantial quantities of VLPs at levels that were near wild-type. Unprocessed Gag (the Gag precursor Pr55) and incompletely processed Gag (the intermediate p41gag) represent two major Gag products compared to wt in our supernatant and cell samples ( Fig. 2A , lanes 1 vs. 2). This is consistent with a report stating that a deletion in a downstream pol sequence significantly impairs PR-mediated virus maturation [23] . PRWz and PRWWz transfectants expressed readily detectable Gag, but produced barely detectable virus-associated Gag, suggesting a severe defect in virus assembly or release ( Fig. 2A , lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, cells transfected with PRKz or PRKKz released readily detectable (though incompletely processed) Gag (lanes 5 and 6), similar to the Gag/PR scenario. VLP levels produced by PRWKz and PRKWz (lanes 7 and 8) were inbetween those produced by PRWz and PRKz. Since enhanced or premature Gag cleavage by PR can lead to significantly reduced virus release, and since the wt LZ fusion-containing constructs exhibited higher ratios of cellular p24 gag to Pr55 gag compared to those found in Gag/PR cell lysates ( Fig. 2A , lanes 3-4 vs. lane 2), we suggest that the LZ-associated virus production defect was largely due to enhanced Pr55 gag cleavage efficiency. Since cell samples were collected between 48 and 72 h posttransfection, it is possible that Gag processing reached a level of stability that prevented us from detecting any differences in efficiency between the wt form and mutants. To test this possibility, and to confirm the effect of LZ domain placement on Gag processing efficiency, we collected samples at 24 and 48 h following the transient expression of wt and mutants. We observed that both PRWz and PRWWz showed significantly higher cellular p24 gag /Pr55 gag ratios compared to those of wt or Gag/PR (Fig. 2B) . Although PRWKz and PRKWz showed cellular Gag processing profiles similar to those of PRKz and PRKKz at 48 h, they displayed higher p24 gag /Pr55 gag ratios compared to Gag/PR at 24 h post-transfection ( Fig. 2B upper panel, lanes 15-16 vs. lane 10) . This suggests that LZ domain placement significantly enhanced Gag processing efficiency. The virus-associated Gag precursor that we detected may reflect, at least in part, the release of assembled Gag molecules that escaped PR-mediated cleavage (Fig. 2B, lanes 7-8) . To determine whether LZ placement affected virion production by wt or assembly-competent mutants in trans, we coexpressed PRWz or PRWWz with the wt or the HIV-1 protease-defective mutant D25, and observed that virus-associated Gag was markedly reduced when D25 was cotransfected with either PRWz or PRWWz at a 1:1 ratio (Fig. 2C ). Similar results were observed when the PRWz or PRWWz was coexpressed with a wt HIV-1 expression vector (data not shown). Combined, these results suggest that (a) PRWz and PRWWz both provided functional PR, and (b) the LZ-triggered virion assembly defect was primarily due to a higher Gag cleavage efficiency. The PRWWz transfectant frequently expressed a lower Gag level compared to other constructs (Fig. 2B, lane 12) , likely the result of increased proteolytic degradation of Gag mediated by the PR.
