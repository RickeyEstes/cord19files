Preparation of α-DC-ZZ-BNCs 24 Armenian hamster IgGs were observed to be bound to ZZ-BNCs with high affinity (0.38 ± 0.07 mol per 1 mol ZZ-L protein), and rat IgG2a and IgG2b were weakly bound to ZZ-BNCs (0.02 ± 0.01 and 0.04 ± 0.02 mol per 1 mol ZZ-L protein, respectively). For the generation of stable α-DC-ZZ-BNC complexes, the chemical crosslinker BS 3 was added to the mixture of ZZ-BNCs and α-DC antibodies, as described previously. 27 As shown in Table 1 , the Z-averages and ζ-potentials of each α-DC-ZZ-BNC complex were less than 100 nm and
