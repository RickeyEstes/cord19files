In total, 3 out of 108 (2.77%; 95% CI: 0.94-7.85%) samples examined in this study tested positive for FeMV RNA and were obtained from one cat sampled in 2014 and from two cats sampled in 2017. In particular, one urine (1/81, 1.23%; 95% CI: 0.03-6.68%) collected from a stray cat and two kidney samples (2/27, 7.40%; 95% CI: 0.91-24.28%) resulted positive. One out of fourteen cats (7.14%; 95% CI: 0.18-33.86%) which showed UPC values above reference values or urinary sediment alterations suggestive of tubular damage (e.g. urinary casts) had FeMV RNA in the urine. At the moment of sample collection, the only FeMV positive cat with urine diagnostic results suggestive of renal disorder had ultrasound and laboratory alterations suggestive of cholangiohepatitis. In this cat, urinalysis showed UPC value compatible with proteinuria (UPC: 0.56) and hyaline and granular casts were observed in the urinary sediment. After appropriate anti-inflammatory, antibiotic A. Stranieri, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 233 (2019) 133-139 and supportive therapy the cat had fully recovered, and another urine sample was taken 8 months after the first sampling. In the second sample, no laboratory alterations, including urinalysis, were found and the PCR for FeMV in the second urine sample resulted negative. The two positive kidneys were collected from one cat affected by non-effusive FIP and from another cat affected by pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Both the FeMV positive cats showed granulomatous lesions at the histological examination of the kidneys, in one case in the framework of typical FIP lesions and in the other case associated with severe necrosis. One of the FeMV positive kidneys was also nRT-PCR for FCoV positive.
