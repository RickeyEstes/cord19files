David Oldach, Visterra, Inc, Waltham, MA, USA. VIS410 is a monoclonal antibody engineered to target all known strains of influenza A including seasonal influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2), and emerging strains such as influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) (Tharakaraman et al., 2015) . This study was a Phase 2a randomized, double-blind trial evaluating single-dose IV administered VIS410 at 2000 mg or 4000 mg compared to placebo in participants 18-65 years of age with influenza A (Hershberger et al., 2019) . 150 participants were randomized, 148 received study drug, and 138 had confirmed influenza. 93% had influenza A(H3N2). All subjects received a single dose of diphenhydramine plus ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid 1 h prior to study drug administration. The primary objective of the study was to determine safety and tolerability. Adverse events, most commonly diarrhea of mild severity, were dose-related, occurring in 55%, 35%, and 24% of the 4000 mg, 2000 mg, and placebo patients, respectively. Two serious adverse events occurred, both in placebo patients. Symptoms were assessed by Flu- PRO (Powers et al., 2018) , and resolution was defined as a mean score < 1 and no domain being > 1. The Vis 410 2000 mg cohort had a non-statistically shorter time to resolution compared to placebo, though the 4000 mg cohort was similar to placebo. Post hoc analysis demonstrated that mean total Flu-PRO scores were lower by Days 3 and 4 in the pooled VIS410 treatment group versus placebo (p < 0.023), with a tendency toward faster resolution by Kaplan-Meier analysis. VIS410 was associated with reduced median nasopharyngeal viral load tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) area under the curve (AUC) Day 7 (days × log 10 TCID 50 /mL) (3.66 pooled VIS410 vs 4.78 placebo, p = 0.08). Among patients with positive cultures at baseline, culture negativity at Day 3 was observed in 63.2% of pooled VIS410 recipients versus 42.5% of placebo recipients, p = 0.053. Kaplan-Meier estimated to time to resolution of viral shedding was reduced (1.9 vs 3.6 days, p = 0.03). The profile of viral RNA shedding as detected by qPCR did not differ between treatment arms. There was no evidence for treatment-emergent VIS410-resistance observed based on genotypic assessment of viral isolates, and the HA target (epitope) for VIS410 was found to be highly conserved. VIS410 in combination with small molecule antivirals may have clinical benefit, and the results of this study supported proceeding into a phase 2b trial of VIS410 in combination with oseltamivir vs oseltamivir alone in hospitalized patients with influenza A (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03040141).

The pharmacokinetic of favipiravir in critical ill patients with influenza is unknown. This was an open label adaptive study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of favipiravir in adult patients with severe influenza (defined as PaO 2 / FiO 2 ≤ 300 mmHg or/and requiring mechanical ventilation). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a plasma favipiravir trough concentration above the MEC (20 μg/ml) at all measured time points after the second dose. A total of 16 laboratory-confirmed influenza-infected participants were enrolled in the trial. The first 16 were dosed at 1600 mg BID on day 1, followed with 600 mg BID for 9 days. The predicted favipiravir concentration was 32.8, 17.4, 15.3 μg/mL, on days 1-3, and 14.9 μg/ mL on days 4-10, but the observed concentration was significantly less from day 3 (median value of 35.9, 23.43, 8.6, 8.6 μg/mL at day 2, 3, 7, 10). Only 3 patients (18.8%) had trough concentration > 20 μg/mL. The concentration of oseltamivir remained stable. Possible reasons for the lower favipiravir level include poor absorption, redistribution, and increased metabolism. Additional studies need to be conducted to understand how to dose favipiravir in the critically ill population.
