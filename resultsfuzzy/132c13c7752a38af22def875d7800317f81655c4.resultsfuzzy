The sequences of cellular and viral papain-like proteases are quite variable; the only reliable conserved region is a stretch of approximately 10 amino acid residues centering at the catalytic Cys ([18] , and unpublished observations). The sequences of po!;itivestranded RNA viral proteins which could be suspected for protease activity were searched for segments resembling this conserved stretch. The pieces of FMDV and RuV polypmteins selected in this way were analyzed in detail.
