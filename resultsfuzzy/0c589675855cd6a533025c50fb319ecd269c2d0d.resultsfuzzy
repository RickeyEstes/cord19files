To test the effect of these inhibitors on PRRSV-induced SG formation, MARC-145 cells were treated with 2-AP, C16, PERK-I, or vehicle for 1 h followed by PRRSV infection for 1 h. The inoculum was then removed, and the cells subsequently were maintained for 36 h in medium with each individual stress kinase inhibitor or vehicle. The cells were then fixed and stained with antibodies against TIA1 and PRRSV N to examine the formation of SGs. As shown in Figure 3B , an equivalent frequency of SG formation was induced after PRRSV infection in cells treated with 2-AP, C16, or vehicle. However, PRRSVinduced SG formation was substantially reduced in cells treated with PERK-I ( Figure 3C , bottom row) compared with that in cells treated with DMSO. These results suggest that PERK rather than PKR is required for SG formation in response to PRRSV infection. Because no GCN2-or HRI-specific inhibitors were available, specific siRNAs were used to test the effects of GCN2 and HRI on PRRSV-induced SG formation. The designed GCN2or HRI-specific siRNAs used in this study were able to reduce the endogenous mRNA levels of GCN2 or HRI in MARC-145 cells by over 70 or 60%, respectively, as compared with the negative control (NC) siRNA ( Figure 3D) . MARC-145 cells were transfected with GCN2-or HRI-specific siRNAs or NC siRNA prior to PRRSV infection. These cells were fixed and immunostained at 36 hpi to examine the presence of SGs. We did not find any significant changes in PRRSV-induced SG formation between either the GCN2-knockdown cells or the HRI-knockdown cells and the NC-treated cells, indicating that neither the depletion of GCN2 nor the depletion of HRI affects the formation of PRRSV-induced SGs ( Figure 3E) . To further confirm the pathway of SG induction by PRRSV infection, we measured the relative levels of phosphorylated eIF2α in MARC-145 cells treated with specific inhibitors or siRNAs targeting the four stress kinases as described above. Cells were harvested for Western blot analyses to assess the levels of total or phosphorylated eIF2α. As show in Figure 3F , infection with PRRSV resulted in a strong increase in the eIF2α phosphorylation level, which was diminished in cells treated with PERK-I, but not in cells treated with any of the other specific inhibitors or siRNAs. As compared with treated cells, no similar changes in the levels of phosphorylated eIF2α were observed in the absence of PRRSV infection. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the total eIF2α levels among the various treatments. These results support the conclusion that PRRSV triggers SG assembly via eIF2α phosphorylation, which is dependent on PERK.
