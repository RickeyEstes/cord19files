To explore the viral diversity six fecal specimens collected from apparently healthy adult M. schreibersii bats were processed for viral metagenomics. In these samples various amounts of sequence reads mapped onto known eukaryotic viral sequences (range, ≪ 0.1% to 0.9%; Fig. 1 ). When evaluating the results of viral metagenomics data we need to point out that sample processing did not include virion enrichment step and it is not clear whether each of the relevant sequence reads originate from intact virions. Consequently, the presence of potential endogenous viral sequence elements may have affected the overall landscape of viral diversity. For example retrovirus specific reads, which may represent endogenous viral genomic traits from genomic DNA of the host species, were detected in all samples. Overall the rate of eukaryotic virus specific sequence reads was low, likely because we omitted virus particle enrichment procedures in our sample processing protocol. Nonetheless, various eukaryotic viruses were detected in all six selected fecal samples. Herpesvirus, astrovirus and coronavirus sequences were detected in at least three samples (herpesvirus in sample 1, 3, and 4; astrovirus in sample 1 to 3; coronavirus in sample 4 to 6). Rotavirus and gemycircularvirus sequences were found in two and one samples, respectively (both viruses in sample 1; rotavirus without gemycircularvirus in sample 6). In one specimen (i.e. sample 6) RV sequences were the most abundant genomic representatives (98.5%); however, these sequence reads were distributed among various RV species (incl. RVB, RVG, RVH and RVI). To clarify this ambiguous situation, the library DNA that contained the most abundant RV-specific reads was resequenced at a greater sequencing depth. The resulting N 1.3 Million sequence reads were subjected to de novo assembly. As a result, the consensus genome sequence of strain BO4351/Ms/ 2014 could be assembled from a total of 36,630 sequence reads at 131 X (segment 3) to 457 X (segment 11) average coverage. Once the consensus rotavirus gene sequences were assembled for all 11 genomic segments, the 5′ and 3′ ends of each segment were validated by an independent method. The resulting genome of BO4351/Ms/2014 was 18,135 bp in length (range, 3533 bp for segment 1 and 620 bp for segment 11). Terminal sequences at the 5′ ends showed relatively conserved structure with stable nucleotides at positions 1, 2 and 4 and some variations at positions 3, 5, and 6 (segments 1 and 2, GGCACA; segments 3 and 4, GGCATT; segments 5, 7 and 9, GGAAAT; segments 6 and 10, GGCAAA), while at the 3′ ends the variation was less (TAYACCC) (see details in Table 2) . Each segment had non-translated regions at both 5′ end (length range, 6 to 57 nt) and 3′ end (length range, 20 to 84 nt). Encoded proteins were assigned based on significant hits through the Blast engine and conserved peptide motifs. With this approach we found the equivalents of the major structural (VP1 to VP4, VP6 and VP7) and non-structural (NSP1 to NSP5) proteins of RVs (Tables 2 and 3 ). The encoded structural and non-structural proteins were assigned to particular RNA segments based on the size of full-length genome segments. Additional putative ORFs were predicted to be encoded on segments coding for VP6 and NSP5; however, these putative proteins shared no conserved protein motifs with those of known from other rotavirus species. In the phylogenetic analyses cognate sequences of representative RVA to RVH strains were included, except for RVE, for which no sequence information is available. Neighbor-joining and maximum-likelihood trees provided similar topologies, clearly distinguishing clade 1 and clade 2 RV strains. The novel batborne RV consistently clustered with clade 2 RV strains, and in particular, with porcine and human RVH strains. One exception was found when analyzing the NSP4 tree, where the limited bootstrap support at the deepest nodes prevented the separation of the two major RV clades (Fig. 2) . Consistent with the phylogenetic analyses, the greatest nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities for the novel batborne RV were seen when compared to reference RVH strains (range, 41 (nt%) and 14 (aa%) for NSP4; 63 (nt%) and 64 (aa%) for VP1) (Table 4) . To place the novel batborne strain, BO4351/Ms/2014, into the latest RV taxonomic framework (Matthijnssens et al., 2012;  http://www. ictvonline.org), additional VP6 gene sequences were selected from GenBank to represent a broader genetic diversity of various RV species (Fig. 3) . In this analysis, again, BO4351/Ms/2014 was most closely related to the major genetic lineage containing RVH strains (49-50%, aa) and showed lower similarity to other clade 2 RVs (RVB, 39%, RVG, 39%). The genetic relationship of BO4351/Ms/2014 to clade 1 RVs was marginal (max. identity with RVC, 17%) (Fig. 4, Table 4 ). Thus, applying the official species demarcation sequence cut-off value, which is 53% identity at the amino acid level, we conclude that the novel batborne RV strain represents a new RV species, tentatively called Rotavirus J (RVJ). The reference strain was therefore designated as RVJ/Bat-wt/SRB/BO4351/Ms/ 2014/G1P1. To determine whether RVJ infection was common among M. schreibersii in the cave under investigation, a nested PCR assay was developed targeting a sequence region that is conserved within the VP6 coding gene of both RVH and RVJ. By adapting the nested PCR assay that amplified a 338 bp long fragment (spanning nucleotide position 137 to 474), another four stool samples were found to be positive for RVJ. All PCR products obtained in the 2nd round PCR were bidirectionally sequenced. The low sequence variation within these short segments (data not shown) suggested the presence of the same virus strain within the colony. Notably, given that RVs have been detected exclusively in birds and mammals, the data presented here suggests that bats may be a true host species of RVJ, although further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis. It is important to note that by morphological examination all tested animals were confirmed as adult specimens. Immune competence and pathogenicity need to be clarified for most viruses harbored by bats, although asymptomatic virus shedding seems to be common. Further studies are needed to clarify the pathogenicity, prevalence and effect of the virus on bat colonies. Since bats seems to possess special immune characteristics , these features may contribute to an altered response to rotavirus infection and explain the high rate of fecal virus shedding in adult M. schreibersii specimens. Recent years have witnessed considerable sequence data accumulation in public data bases pointing out the enormous genetic diversity within the Rotavirus genus. Viral metagenomics largely contributed to our understanding of this genetic diversity (Asano et al., 2016; He et al., 2013; Kluge et al., 2016; Li et al., 2011; Marton et al., 2015; Mihalov-Kovács et al., 2015; Theuns et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2014) . Until the early 2000s RVA to RVG were considered as the only extant RV species (Estes and Greenberg, 2013; Matthijnssens et al., 2012) . Sequence independent amplification followed by cloning and sequencing led to the discovery of a novel human RV species that, together with closely related porcine origin strains, was classified into RVH (Matthijnssens et al., 2012; Wakuda et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2004) . A newly described member of the Rotavirus genus, RVI, was identified in the fecal viromes of seals and dogs (Li et al., 2011; Mihalov-Kovács et al., 2015) . In this study we described a novel RV detected in M. schreibersii bats from Serbia in 2014. This novel batborne RV belongs to clade 2 RVs, which also includes RVB, RVG, RVH and RVI (Kindler et al., 2013; Mihalov-Kovács et al., 2015) . Of interest, the novel strain was closely related to representative strains of RVH suggesting that these RVs had diverged from a common ancestor. Nonetheless, molecular classification indicated that the Serbian batborne RV strain could be the member of Fig. 2 . Phylogenetic trees obtained for the genes encoding all major structural proteins (VP1 to VP4, VP6, and VP7) and non-structural proteins (NSP1 to NSP5) with representative strains of RVA to RVI. Alignments were created using the TranslatorX online platform (http://translatorx.co.uk/). Phylogenetic trees were prepared using the maximum likelihood method as implemented in Mega6 (http://www.megasoftware.net/). Bootstrap values are shown at the branch nodes. Calibration bars are proportional to the genetic distance.
