To better characterize reactivity of microglia and infiltrating BMDM following JHMV infection, we initially monitored CNS infiltration of BMDM, as well as upregulation of MHC class II as an activation marker on both CNS BMDM and microglia by flow cytometry. BMDM with a typical CD45 hi CD11b + F4/80 + phenotype comprised the majority of inflammatory leukocytes as early as day 3 p.i. and then progressively decreased as virus replication is controlled by T cells. At the onset of demyelination at day 10 p.i., the BMDM population stabilized at ~10% of the infiltrating leukocytes ( Figure 1A ). BMDM initially infiltrated as MHC class II lo expressing cells, but the vast majority upregulated MHC class II by day 7 p.i. MHC class II expression on microglia was sparse at days 3 and 5 p.i., but rapidly increased by day 7 p.i. and then gradually declined by day 14 p.i. (Figure 1A) . These kinetics supported that microglia and BMDM activation peaks delayed relative to peak BMDM accumulation and coincides with peak T cell IFN-γ production (36, 37) . Enhanced activation of microglia at day 7 p.i., compared to earlier times p.i., was also supported by progression of morphological changes, evidenced by enlarged cell bodies and retracted and thickened processes ( Figure 1B) . The decline of BMDM, but an ongoing activation phenotype of microglia at the time of evident demyelination implicated microglia as mediators of tissue damage during JHMV encephalomyelitis. Biochemical depletion of peripheral monocytes indeed supported that BMDM are not essential to tissue destruction in JHMV-infected mice (30) . Data from our own laboratory further demonstrated that the chemokine CCL2 is essential for BMDM accumulation within the CNS (31) . The absence of CCL2 resulted in an ~80% reduction of BMDM at all time points, including day 14 p.i. (31) and ( Figure 1C ) when demyelination is prominently evident in WT mice. Nevertheless, microglia activation, as monitored by MHC class II expression, was independent of CCL2 ( Figure 1D ). Most importantly, the absence of CCL2-dependent BMDM within the CNS did not alter demyelination ( Figure 1E ). Similar myelin loss at day 21 p.i. comparing WT and CCL2 −/− infected mice supported the concept that microglia mediate demyelination during JHMV infection.
