FHC tissue exhibited normal structures, smooth surface, uniform thickness, normal chondrocytic size, shape, number, and arrangement; no cartilage growth or ossification exhibited abnormality; the epiphyseal plate thickness was normal and uniform, the chondrocytic size, shape, number, and arrangement were normal, and no cartilage growth or ossification exhibited abnormality; the chondrocytic column was arranged regularly; the trabecular thickness and morphology were normal and closely connected; the osteoblasts and osteoclasts' size, shape, number, and arrangement were normal; the structure of bone marrow was normal, and the cell proportion and component composition showed no abnormality (Fig. 2) .  The Mankin pathological scores in group A0, A1, A2, B1, and B2 were 0.46 ± 0.25, 1.75 ± 0.46, 1.83 ± 0.74, 2.0 ± 1.20, and 4.25 ± 0.89, respectively; the scores in all the experimental groups were higher than the control group (group A0), and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). With the increasing of the injection dose and frequency, the scores in group A1, A2, B1, and B2 were also increased, and that in group B2 was significantly higher than the other three groups, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05).
