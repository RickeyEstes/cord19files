Chemistry A series of myricetin derivatives containing thiadiazole moiety were successfully prepared in two steps in our current work. All of the target compounds 2, 3a-3q were characterized by infrared spectrum (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and high resolution mass spectrum (HRMS) analysis. The IR spectral data of compounds 2, 3a-3q showed characteristic frequencies at 1723-1709 cm −1 and 1640-1621 cm −1 , which are assigned to the characteristic vibrations of C=O and C=N-, respectively. In the 1 H NMR spectra, the characteristic −CH 2 -groups between myricetin scaffold and 1,3,4-thiadiazole heterocycle was observed 13 C NMR spectra confirmed the existence of C=O and C=N-groups, respectively.
