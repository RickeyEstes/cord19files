One of the main goals of this study was to ascertain whether burnt hospital waste has any effect on the total elemental composition of soil. This was very necessary because there appear to be an extensive farming at the site and the surrounding of the study area. Our data reveal an elevated concentration and even the presence anthropogenic elements when compared with the control. The elemental compositions of the four sites studied are given in Table 1 . Eleven elements (Si, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Zr, and Pb) were detected and their concentration determined. As can be seen from Table 1 , the dominant trend is as follows: Si > Fe > Ca > K > Ti > Zr > Cl > Cr > V > Pb > Mn. The values obtained in this study which are above the maximum allowable contents of metals for agricultural purposes as proposed by Blankenship et al. 1994 in these soils are indicative of anthropogenic action of the burnt hospital waste dump on the soil total elemental composition. For example, the mean content of Zn obtained by other investigators with soil of anthropogenic sources in different countries ranged from 17 to 125 ppm (Blankenship et al. 1994; Kramlich et al. 1989) which is in agreement with the findings in this study. The lead concentration in the top horizon of soil contaminated with anthropogenic activities in other places with similar pedon ranged is about 100 to 189 ppm (EPA 1985; EPA 1987a) this is in conformity with the results obtained in this investigation. Interestingly, the presence of elevated concentrations Cl and Pb in the sites of burnt hospital waste dump and the absent of the same in the control site are of serious environmental and health concern owing to fact that Lead is very toxic elements and Chlorine in particular is related to dioxin and furans emission in the environment. Emphatically Cl with half life (T 1 2 Â¼ 0:3Ma) transfer from soil to plant has been reported to be very high (Kashparov et al. 2007 ). Chlorine has been proven to be an active ingredient essential for dioxin formation during combustion of PVC related material which is a major constituent of hospital related waste materials (EPA 1987b; EPA 2000; Lemiuex 1997; Carrol et al., 1996) . The exposure to dioxins and furans can result in liver, kidney or lungs damage. Dioxins and furans are also known as human carcinogen (Carrol et al., 1996) . This became very worrisome as there appear to be extensive subsistence agricultural practices in the sites/neighborhoods of the study area. The enrichment factors for the element, which were obtained using Mn as reference element and the elemental concentrations of reference crust (Loska et al. 1997) . According to Table 2 the enrichment of the potential toxic elements like Cl and Pb could not be calculated because of the absence of these elements in the reference material (the control). Potassium, Ti and Mn showed moderate enrichment with ranged factor of (2-5) while Si, Ca and were significantly enriched with the ranged factor of (5-20). Iron showed the highest enrichment (Table 2 ) in this study having the average enrichment factor of 23.9. Obiajunwa et al. (2002) had advocated that enrichment factor greater than 10 can cause adverse health effect to soil plant, man and animal. Nevertheless the presence of Cl and Pb in the site of the study and the absence of the same in the control can be attributable to the pollution (contamination) from the burnt hospital waste. The accuracy of our experimental values was assured by the analysis of the soil standard IAEA soil-7. The results of this analysis, presented in Table 3 , are in good agreement with the certified values (IAEA 2000).
