In order to show the need of a more robust statistical analysis for all network data, all simulation results are show in Fig. 6 . Note that the average clustering coefficient, average shortest path, diameter and maximum degree is not enough to clearly identify a R 0 prediction. Although there is a variance in data, density and average degree have trends which allow a R 0 prediction. Moreover, R 0 > 1, i.e., disease persists in population when den ࣡ 0.01, and when average degree avdeg ࣡ 10. Therefore, PCA has been used to get other relationships between disease and network parameters. The variables used were: average clustering coefficient ( cc ); average shortest path ( spl ); density ( den ); diameter ( diam ); average degree ( avdeg ); maximum degree ( maxdeg ); amount of individuals Susceptible ( S ) Infected ( I ) and Recovered ( R ) when the system reached the permanent regime; Infected peak ( Ip ), (i.e., the amount of Infected individuals in the initial outbreak of disease) and; instant of Infected peak ( iIp ), which is the time step when the peak occurred. All these 12 variables have been considered for all 41,270 experiments of all networks and the Fig. 7 contains the normalized projection of each variable. Note that according to PCA, the internal structure of the data that best explains the variance in the data have maxdeg, Ip, R and avdeg as most informative variables. Fig 6 already exhibited R 0 in function of maxdeg , and such variable certainly does not explain Fig. 6 . Data for all networks put together for R 0 in function of topological parameters clustering coefficient, shortest path, density, diameter, average degree and maximum degree. the disease variables. Actually, the maximum degree of the network is very sensitive to the other topological parameters for all networks. Thereby, relationships on Figs. 8 -11 are based on PCA results. The Fig. 8 shows that small values of average degree is enough for a high peak of infected individuals and the trend of increasing the I ( t ) peak changes at around 300, when it starts to decrease. Fig. 9 indicates that the sooner the I ( t ) occurs, the high the value of the peak is. Fig. 10 contains the same data of Fig. 6 for average degree, but in a different scale. Somehow, PCA confirms the importance of the average degree for analyzing a disease spreading. Note that for all figures, the value of R 0 saturates. In such condition, the term aS ( t ) I ( t ) of Eq. (1) can be written as aS(t ) I(t ) = S(t ) , since all Susceptible individuals become infected. Accordingly, the new equations are: with the set of stationary solutions (as done for Eq. (1) ): + 1) )) . Therefore, we have a sat = 1 /I * sat , thus: Using Eq. (2) for determining values for b, c and e , we have R 0 sat = 11 . Thus, the white thick dashed line in Fig. 10 is a fitted curve for the experimental points in the form: Finally, a distinct result is presented on Fig. 11 , where the R 0 is plotted in function of the amount of Recovered individuals ( R ) when the system reached the permanent regime. Here, the disease R 0 increases when R increases and this result is corroborated by other related papers, since the disease qualitatively parameters used are usually from diseases like mumps, chickenpox and measles ( Monteiro, Chimara, & Berlinck, 2006 ) which also have high R 0 and high amount of Recovered individuals in population ( Anderson & May, 1991 ) . If we consider that the permanent regime of the system has R 0 > 1, i.e., disease is active, R 0 can be approxi-
