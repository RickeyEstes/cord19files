4 days of symptom onset showed faster normalisation of respiratory status compared with patients treated greater than 4 days after symptom onset, although a definitive conclusion will require further study. Based on this data, a larger, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial is underway (NCT02572817). The intervention seems safe with numerically fewer participants in the plasma group having serious adverse events compared with participants randomised to standard care (20% vs 38%). The serious adverse events reported seem to be largely related to the underlying influenza, its complications, and other comorbid conditions, and not due to the intervention, although assessment of safety can be very difficult in any seriously ill population. Given the high numbers of serious adverse events and adverse events in participants who only received standard care, the ability to discern a subtle safety signal associated with the intervention in this very ill population is challenging. Given the morbidity of influenza in children and pregnant women, it was important to incorporate these populations in this study. Although we did not enroll sufficient numbers of children or pregnant women to make discrete statements about the efficacy in those subpopulations, we have shown it is feasible (and would argue that it is necessary) to incorporate these populations in trials of novel influenza therapeutics for severe disease. The absence of a measurable antiviral effect is difficult to interpret. The need for virological efficacy endpoints in influenza therapeutics has been well argued 12 but, to date, even oseltamivir has not shown conclusive efficacy in terms of decreased viral shedding. 13 A previous study 2 with anti-influenza convalescent plasma did report a difference in rate of decrease of viral shedding, although the cohort design and high mortality in the control group make direct comparisons to this study difficult. The previous study 11 with hyperimmune anti-influenza immunoglobulin did show virological benefit on day 3 and 5, although, as previously noted, did not show clinical benefit for the primary analysis population. 11 At present, the FDA does not consider virological endpoints alone to be sufficient as primary endpoints given the absense of a predictive relationship between reductions in viral titres and clinical benefit, as well as substantial variability in methods of quantifying viral shedding. 14 The use of haemagglutination inhibition titre as a measure of immunity in the prevention of influenza is well established, 15 and therefore an increase in haemagglutination inhibition titres by immune plasma might be anticipated to decrease viral shedding. Additionally, several hundred units of plasma were screened each week to support this study, so the assay needed to be scalable for high throughput. For these reasons, plasma units for this study were screened by haemagglutination inhibition. However, in the previous cohort study, 2 anti-influenza convalescent plasma units were screened by neutralising antibody titre. Although neutralising antibody titre and haemagglutination inhibition are generally related, there are not sufficient data to indicate which is the more appropriate method for screening plasma units. Additionally, it is possible that systemically administered antibodies do not sufficiently permeate mucosal surfaces to affect viral replication. In our study, there was a numerical difference in geometric mean titres in the plasma treatment group compared with participants in the control group in the first few days after plasma administration. The analysis of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship of this intervention, however, presents several challenges. The administered plasma is not discernable from the intrinsic immune response. Unlike small molecules, the baseline titre does not begin at zero due to both pre-existing immunity (previous infections and vaccinations) as well as any immune response occurring after the illness onset. By day 28, the titre is higher in all participants regardless of treatment due to the adaptive immune response and remains elevated above baseline for months. Given the complexity of this type of analysis, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship is beyond the scope of this Article. We were not able to record any effect of immune plasma on decreasing the symptoms of influenza illness. Given the severe nature of the illness in our study population (58% were in the ICU), the ability to ascertain symptom severity reliably and in a way that is easily reproducible might indeed be questionable. There was also no difference between groups in the number of days during follow-up that oxygen supplementation was used, despite the suggested improvement in resolution of tachypnoea and hypoxia in plasma recipients. This result might conceivably reflect the practice (intentional or by omission) of delayed discontinuation of supplemental oxygen despite the resolution of hypoxia. The use of an ordinal scale of clinical status by levels of care, as was done in our analysis, avoids much of the variation reported in our primary endpoint. Although originally developed for use in a different influenza therapeutic study, and while not in the original analysis plan, by use of this scale a significant difference in outcomes between the treatment groups at day 7 was noted. The study has several limitations. There were limited previous data by which an effect size could be determined for sample size calculations and, in the end, this study was underpowered. The unblinded design was another limitation of the study. Potential placebos (eg, saline with albumin) were debated during protocol development, although even with elaborate blinding schemes the study team is unlikely to have been effectively blinded. Ultimately, it was concluded that incorporation of a placebo should await a larger, more definitive trial. One unintended consequence of the decision to have an unblinded study design was the observation that losses to follow-up seemed to be somewhat higher in the participants who received standard care as compared with those who received plasma. After consenting but then being informed that no specific study treatment would be provided, we suspect that participants who received standard care were less motivated to complete all study visits. However, this loss to follow-up did not compromise our ability to ascertain data for the primary endpoint. At baseline, there were some differences in oxygen dependency, the proportion of patients using mechanical ventilation, and APACHE scores suggesting that the standard care group might have had participants presenting with more severe disease. Due to the association of age and pregnancy with outcomes in H1N1 influenza, these were chosen as the primary stratification categories for randomisation. With the limited sample size, we were concerned that additional stratification could have led to incomplete filling of blocks (over stratification) and subsequent imbalances. The differences in the severity of illness likely also account for the higher viral burden in nasal and oropharyngeal swabs at baseline in the standard care group. For a variety of reasons, a study of this type proved to be very difficult to execute. Despite engagement of established investigators in infectious diseases, intensive care, and emergency medicine at 29 academic medical centres, enrolment and random assignment of 98 participants took more than 4 years. Major challenges included a low incidence of influenza illness in some years of the study and the scarcity of experience of most blood establishments with using plasma as an investigational product. Some participants, families, and even treating physicians also expressed reluctance in use of a human blood product for a disease such as influenza, in which morbidity and mortality is often underappreciated. There were additional challenges unique to the investigational product, including the moving target of antigenic drift in circulating influenza subtypes and the need to match this evolution over time with contemporaneous plasma, and the comparatively short shelf life of plasma units necessitating frequent replenishment of expiring units. Although the primary endpoint did not reach statistical significance, this trial had showed an improved outcome in the secondary endpoint of clinical status at day 7 in participants who received plasma compared with standard care alone. Additionally, other endpoints might be suggestive of improved outcome in these patients. Given the need for better therapies for influenza, as well as the need to have strategies in place to rapidly launch effective therapeutic countermeasures for diseases of this type, it is of critical importance to accurately determine the efficacy of immune plasma. With these considerations, we believe that this approach should be further studied in a larger randomised trial. As noted, such a trial is presently underway.
