In this section, we conduct extensive numerical simulations to demonstrate the vaccination behavior on the regular lattices and scale-free networks, respectively. Among them, we mainly discuss the influence of vaccine cost c and failure rate θ on the collective vaccination level within the population. Without loss of generality, we set the value of parameters in the SIR model as β = 0 . 46 and γ = 1 / 3 , which are identical with those in Ref. [36] .
