Immune responses are triggered through the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Binding of PAMPs leads to the activation of signaling pathways: RNAi, Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT), Immune Deficiency (IMD) and Toll [36] [37] [38] [39] . The major insect innate immune response triggered by virus infection is normally the small interfering RNA pathway. RNAi is a molecular mechanism in which the presence of intracellular dsRNA leads to the production of small RNAs that suppress the expression of genes with matching sequences [40] . Nevertheless, alternative mechanisms exist. In previous work, our group identified an antiviral response when the LL5 embryonic L. longipalpis cell lineage was transfected with dsRNA, which included the synthetic poly I:C. After dsRNA transfection, cells did not support WNV virus like particle (VLP) replication, as evidenced by lack of luciferase reporter gene expression. This block in replication may be due to a cellular antiviral response triggered by dsRNA. [22] . A similar non-specific antiviral response was observed in the marine shrimps Litopanaeus vannamei and Penaeus monodon [41, 42] . More recently, the occurrence of dsRNA-mediated non-specific antiviral response was also described in two members of the Apidae family: the honey bee Apis melifera, and the bumblebee Bombus terrestris [43] [44] [45] . This non-specific response differs from what is seen in Drosophila, where transfection with virus-specific dsRNA triggers an RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated response against the virus, whereas non-related dsRNAs fail to activate the antiviral response [46] . In vertebrates, intracellular dsRNA is recognized by the PRR retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and the melanoma differentiation-associated protein (MDA5). These are also known as RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) [47, 48] . These receptors recruit the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling (MAVS) protein that mobilizes kinases and ubiquitin ligases, leading to the activation of transcription factors, such as interferon receptor factor 3 (IRF-3) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) [49, 50] . The transcription factors induce type I interferon (IFN) and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. dsRNA, including poly I:C, is also detected by Toll-like receptor 3, initiating the type-I interferon (IFN-α, β) signaling pathway via a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) signal, which activates interferon receptor factor 3 (IRF-3) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), leading to IFN-β expression [51, 52] . To investigate variations in the exoproteome profile of dsRNA-transfected L. longipalpis LL5 cells, we carried out mass spectrometry (MS) analyses comparing the protein composition of conditioned medium from poly I:C and mock-treated cell cultures at two time points (24 and 48 h); in total 304 proteins were identified (Table S1) . Only 17.6% (53) of all identified secreted proteins presented a signal peptide (SP). Among proteins with ≥2-fold positive change variation, this percentage decreased to 11.53%, with only six proteins with SP: 2 at 24 h and 4 at 48 h (Table S1 ). The lack of signal peptide in the majority of secreted proteins suggests that unconventional protein secretion pathways are the main secretory mechanisms in LL5 cells, as already seen in other systems [53] . This could be due at least partly to exosomal transport. We identified some of the known exosome markers among our secreted proteins, based on the Exo Carta exosome marker list (www.exocarta.org/exosome_markers). Among these were glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), enolase (ENO), fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (ALDOA), moesin (MSN), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), cluster of differentiation (CDs) 37, 48 and 63, the heat shock proteins (HSPs) 70 and 90, and annexins (Table S1 ). These were not differentially expressed with a greater than 2-fold change and were present in both mock and poly I:C transfection samples. We performed an interaction analysis of the LL5 dsRNA-transfected exoproteome. The network analysis of 304 proteins presenting different abundance between mock and transfected groups (Table S1) predicted that 271 proteins (Table S2) were connected by 2184 edges ( Figure 1A) forming an intricate network. The prevised protein interaction (PPI) enrichment p-value was 0.0, meaning that secreted proteins have more relations among themselves than what would be expected for a random set of proteins of similar size drawn from the genome. Exoproteome functional enrichment analysis identified enhanced interactions related to specific biological functions. These interactions have a significant false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05. Among these gene ontology (GO) categories and pathways, we can quote: biological process GO:0006518 (peptide metabolic process) FDR: We also carried out STRING interaction analysis ( Figure 1B ) of proteins with ≥2-fold change variation detected on mass spectrometry analysis. From the 51 protein sequences (Table S2 ) shown in Figure 2B ,C, 45 were identified in the STRING database (Table S2 ) and from those, 26 (Table S2 ) ( Figure 1B) were predicted as connected at least to one protein. This interaction analysis displayed a significant PPI enrichment p-value of 4.51 × 10 −4 . In this interactome we can distinguish two major protein groups: the first one with 12 members is related to oxidative stress modulation and includes phospholipid scramblase (PLSCR1), thioredoxin (TXN), glutaredoxin (GLRX3), superoxide dismutase (SOD1), and forskolin-binding protein 4 (FKBP4), among others. The second group is comprised of 10 proteins linked with peptide synthesis and cytoskeleton organization. Among these are the riboproteins RPS28 and RPLP2, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (EIF3D), moesin (MSN), cortactin protein (CTTN), and others. Two biological functions were enhanced in the ≥2-fold change secreted protein cluster: cellular component: GO: 0070062 (extracellular exosome) FDR: 5.58 × 10 −12 and molecular function: GO.0003723 (RNA binding) FDR: 4.41 × 10 −2 . These same biological function enrichments are found when we study the whole exoproteome. The complete FDR-filtered (p < 0.05) lists are shown in Table S3 . The measurement of relative protein abundance revealed that the secretion of most proteins did not vary significantly between test and control supernatants (Figure 2A ). Only 6.95% (18) of all identified proteins at 24 h presented variation of ≥2-fold change, and 6.22% (17) presented variation of ≤2-fold change ( Figure 2B ). These percentages change to 11.54% (33) and 24.83% (71) , respectively, at 48 h after dsRNA transfection ( Figure 2C ). We focused on the 51 proteins with ≥2-fold change variation, which represent 17.28% of the total identified proteins ( Figure 2C ). The proteins with intensified secretion in the first 24 h had their relative amounts decreased at 48 h. Most proteins more abundant at 48 h had a basal detection level at 24 h. Interestingly only one protein, the enzyme carboxylesterase, presented secretion levels with ≥2-fold change at both time points. In insects this enzyme is related to detoxifying processes, including insecticide resistance [54] . Several proteins with higher secretion at 24 h or 48 h are related to immune responses. Among the proteins with higher secretion at 24 h we can highlight eight proteins related to immune response. Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) had a positive variation with a greater than 8-fold change. Scramblases are conserved in all eukaryotic organisms. They are multiple palmitoylated, endofacial membrane proteins originally identified based on their capacity to promote accelerated transbilayer phospholipid movement in response to Ca 2+ [55] . PLSCR1 was identified as an interferon and growth factor-inducible protein necessary for the IFN-dependent induction of gene expression and antiviral activity [56] . In human and mouse plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which are professional interferon-producing cells specialized in recognizing viral RNA and DNA through the endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs) TLR7 and TLR9, respectively, PLSCR1 was described as a TLR9-binding protein that plays a significant role in type-1 interferon responses in pDCs by regulating TLR9 expression and trafficking [57] . The direct interaction of PLSCR1 with human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) leads to a reduction of virus titers [58] . These reports demonstrate the significant, but not fully understood, role of phospholipid scramblase in antiviral response. Another interesting protein with a greater than 5-fold increased secretion at 24 h was the hexameric chaperone complex prefoldin (PFD). Subunits of prefoldin have been found to be associated with cellular response to viral infection. The PFDN1 expression was positively modulated in both vaccinia virus-infected HEK 293 cells and in the RABV-infected N2a cells [59, 60] . PFDN2 was found directly bound to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) F protein [61] . The STRING interactome maps were generated using default settings (medium confidence of 0.4, with 7 criteria for linkage: neighborhood, genefusion, co-occurrence, co-expression, experimental evidence, existing databases, and textmining). Proteins were represented as nodes and their functional links were defined by solid lines. The thickness of the lines signifies the level of confidence of the reported association. The non-connected nodes were suppressed. No additional interplay proteins were added to the networks. The protein symbols and node colors are listed in Table S2 . Still within the proteins with higher secretion at 24 h, we found forskolin-binding protein 59 (FKBP59), an immunophilin family member, with a secretion level increase of greater than 5-fold. This is a highly conserved group of proteins which binds to immunosuppressive drugs such as FK506, rapamycin, and cyclosporine [62, 63] . FKBPs are involved in several biochemical processes and participate in the immune response against viral infection. Mitochondrial FKBP51 was identified as a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) binding protein. Binding of FKBP51 to TRAF proteins facilitates the type-I interferon response induced by dsRNA transfection or Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection in murine fibroblasts. Depletion of FKBP51 reduced the expression of type 1 INF in these cells [64] . One interesting protein with a greater than 5-fold enhanced secretion at 24 h is coatomer protein I (COPI). COPI-coated vesicles are associated with transport from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum [65] , endocytosis [66] , maturation of autophagic vacuoles [67] , expression of cell surface receptors, and modulation of the plasma membrane lipid composition [68] . Studies demonstrated the involvement of COPI subunits in diverse aspects of virus infection [69] [70] [71] . Depletion of the COPI β 2 subunit in human 293/ACE2 cells led to a decrease in the severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication [72] . The STRING interactome maps were generated using default settings (medium confidence of 0.4, with 7 criteria for linkage: neighborhood, genefusion, co-occurrence, co-expression, experimental evidence, existing databases, and textmining). Proteins were represented as nodes and their functional links were defined by solid lines. The thickness of the lines signifies the level of confidence of the reported association. The non-connected nodes were suppressed. No additional interplay proteins were added to the networks. The protein symbols and node colors are listed in Table S2 . Still within the proteins with higher secretion at 24 h, we found forskolin-binding protein 59 (FKBP59), an immunophilin family member, with a secretion level increase of greater than 5-fold. This is a highly conserved group of proteins which binds to immunosuppressive drugs such as FK506, rapamycin, and cyclosporine [62, 63] . FKBPs are involved in several biochemical processes and participate in the immune response against viral infection. Mitochondrial FKBP51 was identified as a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) binding protein. Binding of FKBP51 to TRAF proteins facilitates the type-I interferon response induced by dsRNA transfection or Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection in murine fibroblasts. Depletion of FKBP51 reduced the expression of type 1 INF in these cells [64] . One interesting protein with a greater than 5-fold enhanced secretion at 24 h is coatomer protein I (COPI). COPI-coated vesicles are associated with transport from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum [65] , endocytosis [66] , maturation of autophagic vacuoles [67] , expression of cell surface receptors, and modulation of the plasma membrane lipid composition [68] . Studies demonstrated the involvement of COPI subunits in diverse aspects of virus infection [69] [70] [71] . Depletion of the COPI β 2 subunit in human 293/ACE2 cells led to a decrease in the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication [72] . We identified two juvenile hormone-inducible proteins at 24 h with 4.43-and 2.12-fold increases. Despite the absence of information on the possible involvement of juvenile hormone-inducible proteins in the insect antiviral response, the juvenile hormone itself and retinoic acid are terpenoids, with similar structure and biological effects in mammalian and insect cells [73] . Retinoic acid-inducible genes are related to type-I IFN response in mammals [48, 74] . Viruses 2017, 9, 377 8 of 16 We identified two juvenile hormone-inducible proteins at 24 h with 4.43-and 2.12-fold increases. Despite the absence of information on the possible involvement of juvenile hormone-inducible proteins in the insect antiviral response, the juvenile hormone itself and retinoic acid are terpenoids, with similar structure and biological effects in mammalian and insect cells [73] . Retinoic acidinducible genes are related to type-I IFN response in mammals [48, 74] . Another virus infection-related protein found was kinesin, an ATPase protein belonging to the class of motor proteins. Kinesins move along microtubule (MT) filaments, and are power-driven by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) [75] . Recently this protein has been associated with the intracellular transport of different viruses. HIV-1 trafficking to the nucleus is kinesin-and dynein motor-dependent [76] . Kinesin was also identified as a Chandipura virus matrix binding protein [77] . Kinesin from lepidopteran Trichoplusia ni binds directly to nucleocapsid proteins of the Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) [78] , and the α herpersviral envelope protein pUS9 uses kinesin 1 to promote the anterograde axonal transport of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) [79] . These results demonstrate that kinesin protein interacts directly with the virus particle. The insect protein canopy 4 is a homolog of the human protein associated with Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 (PRAT4). PRAT4 is required for cell surface expression of the Toll family of receptors and for the intracellular nucleic acid-sensing TLR7/9. This protein is essential for TLR-dependent immune response [80] . The 2.7-fold increased secretion of this PRAT4 homolog signals the participation of Toll-like receptors in the LL5 antiviral non-specific immune response. The barrier to autointegration factor (BAF) DNA binding protein had an increase of 2.65-fold at 24 h. This protein is described as a potent antiviral effector against poxyviruses, retroviruses and the herpes virus. The BAF antiviral property is regulated by kinases and phosphatases, with dephosphorylation activating its antiviral properties [81] . Notwithstanding the higher number of positively modulated secreted proteins at 48 h when compared with 24 h, the number of proteins described in immune response to viruses in interferon-like responses was smaller than what was seen at 24 h. Among them we quote the protein hemocytin, with a secretion increase of 5.66-fold. Hemocytin is an insect humoral lectin homologous to mammalian von Willebrand factor, which is involved in platelet adhesion to subendothelium [82] . Hemocytin expression is induced by pathogens. Lectins are adhesive molecules which bind carbohydrates and among other functions are involved in hemolymph bacterial clearance [83] . Also of interest is the occurrence of glutaredoxin (fold change of 7.96), thioredoxin (fold change of 4.95) and superoxide dismutase (fold change of 2.99), antioxidant enzymes involved in the control of oxidative stress at 48 h. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, generated due to microbial invasion, has long been known to exert an antimicrobial effect. The activation of the antiviral and inflammatory signaling pathways has also been linked with the production of ROS [84, 85] . Due to the high chemical reactivity of ROS, cells possess scavenger antioxidant mechanisms that maintain redox homeostasis [86] . Real time PCR (qPCR) analysis of 13 genes coding for significantly positive-or negatively-modulated secreted proteins revealed the existence of some genes with transcriptional profile correlated with the amount of protein detected in the supernatants ( Figure 3A ). There were seven molecules that presented a correlation between mRNA and secreted protein levels (represented in Figure 3A ). Three of them, hemocytin (HMC), lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), and scramblase (SCR), showed coordinated mRNA and secreted protein levels. When mRNA levels changed at 12 or 24 h post transfection (either by up-or down-regulation), we detected a corresponding change in secreted protein levels 12 or 24 h after the mRNA level changes. Hemocytin (HMC), an insect humoral lectin which plays an important role in a non-specific self-defense mechanism [82] , had increased mRNA and secreted protein levels at 12 h and 24 h. This indicates that the transcription, translation and secretion of this molecule are correlated and the prolonged increase of its expression suggests this molecule may be important for the LL5 cells response to poly I:C transfection. Two other molecules, lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) (a plasma enzyme which esterifies cholesterol) [87] , and scramblase (SCR) (a regulator of transbilayer lipid asymmetry in eukaryotic cell membranes) [55] , were reduced both in mRNA and secreted protein levels at 12 or 24 h post-transfection. These two molecules are involved in lipid metabolism or membrane formation and the reduction of their expression may suggest that LL5 cells reduce vesicle formation 48 h after transfection challenge. Three other molecules showed increased mRNA levels at 12 or 24 h post transfection and increased secreted protein levels at 24 h, with posterior decrease at 48 h. One was the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eTIF3), which in humans is directly recruited by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to promote the translation of viral proteins [88] . In LL5 cells it showed increased mRNA levels at 12 h and 24 h, and increased secreted protein levels 24 h after mRNA increase. Curiously, 48 h post transfection the secreted protein levels decreased drastically. Juvenile hormone-inducible protein (JHIP) showed increased mRNA levels after 12 h and increased secreted protein levels 24 h after mRNA increase. Curiously, at 48 h post transfection the secreted protein levels decreased drastically regardless of changes in mRNA levels prior to this timepoint. Basal transcription factor 3 (BTF3) has been reported to play a significant role in the transcriptional regulation related to eukaryote growth and development [89] . In LL5 cells it showed increased mRNA levels at 12 h and increased secreted protein level 12 h after mRNA increase. At 48 h post transfection the secreted protein levels decreased drastically regardless of changes in mRNA levels prior to this time point. Transketolase mRNA levels increased at 48 h post transfection and the secreted protein levels also increased at this same time point, suggesting a late effect. Curiously, regardless of the maintenance of mRNA levels from 6 h to 24 h, the secreted protein levels were considerably low at 24 h post transfection. Changes in transketolase activity are involved in a number of tumors and degenerative diseases [90] . Based on the data presented in Figure 3A , we observed that in the majority of the molecules (six out of seven) there was a correlated change of secreted protein levels 12 h to 24 h after changes in mRNA levels. The remaining genes investigated showed no correlation between the mRNA levels and the detection of proteins in the supernatants. ( Figure 3B ). The linear regression of mRNA levels plotted against secreted protein levels revealed a weak correlation (Figure 4 ). The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and goodness of fit (r 2 ) calculated for mRNA levels (6 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h) versus secreted protein (24 h and 48 h) are shown in Figure 4 and Table 2 . The non-correlation between transcription levels and amounts of secreted protein indicates that secretion is regulated by some not-yet disclosed mechanism, involving transcription, translation, storage, sorting, and transport, as already reported for other systems [91] . This non-correlation was also observed when the exoproteome of WRL-68 human hepatic cells infected with the chikungunya virus was analyzed [92] . We observed that the majority of analyzed genes were transcribed in the first 24 h ( Figure 3A,B) . The results obtained with the signal peptide prediction, the secreted protein interaction network, the identified biological functions enriched pathways, and the relatively small number of proteins with significant abundance variation reveal the existence of finely-tuned protein secretion modulation in response to dsRNA treatment. There is also a strong indication for the participation of the exosomal secretory pathway as the major LL5 cell secretion mechanism in this response. The increased secretion of proteins such as phospholipid scramblase, FKBP, juvenile hormone-inducible proteins, and protein canopy 4 in the first 24 h indicate that this non-specific antiviral response is in a way similar to an interferon-like response mediated by the Toll pathway. This response occurs preferentially in the first hours after transfection. The increase of antioxidant enzymes at 48 h indicates that the cells are working to control the oxidative stress level in the culture. We are presently in the process of validating these findings by silencing specific genes with subsequent analysis of nonspecific antiviral response.
