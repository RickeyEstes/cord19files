Imported case counts of 2019-nCoV among high surveillance locations are positively correlated with daily air travel volume (Figure 1 ). An increase in flight volume by 14 passengers per day is associated with one additional imported case in expectation. Singapore lies above the 95% prediction interval (PI), with 12 (2-13) more reported import cases than expected under our model. Thailand has a relatively high air travel volume as compared to all other locations, yet it lies below the 95% prediction interval. Finally, Indonesia with zero reported cases lies below the prediction interval -its expected case count is 5 (1-11 .

This overall pattern (Singapore lying above the 95% PI, Thailand and Indonesia below) was observed consistently across all six robustness regression analyses. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020495 doi: medRxiv preprint
