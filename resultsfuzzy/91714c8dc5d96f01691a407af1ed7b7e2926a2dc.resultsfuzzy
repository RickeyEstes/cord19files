cRNA standards were used for the generation of the standard curve (Fig. 1) . Serial dilutions of the standards were made and corresponding copy numbers of specific transcripts from 10 2 up to 10 9 were used. Equal volumes of standard and sample were used for PCR amplification. The Sequence Detector v1.9 software (Applied Biosystems) was used for the analysis of the copy numbers and linear regression curve. The dynamic range of the assay was determined by testing 10-fold serial dilutions of the cRNA standard ranging from 10 to 10 12 molecules. The results were analyzed in terms of C t value (the cycle in which a target sequence was detected). The dynamic range of the assay spans 6 logs ranging from 2 to 8 log molecules PUUV per reaction, corresponding to C t values ranging from 38.74 ± 0.27 to 14.32 ± 0.01. The concentration as measured by qRT-PCR was scored by a focus assay. A PUUV dilution of 5 × 10 4 PUUV geq measured Fig. 1 . Ten-fold serial dilutions ranging from 10 2 to 10 9 copies of cRNA were tested in duplicate in real-time RT-PCR. A standard curve graph is made by plotting the C t values on the y-axis and the log of the input amounts on the x-axis. The slope was −3.525 and the correlation coefficient 0.998. The Y-intercept, the C t value to detect one copy, was 45.805. after RNase/proteinase K digestion was confirmed with focus assay and contained 1.6 × 10 3 focus forming units. In order to ensure that the inactivation procedure itself was not inactivating the virus, the inactivation procedure was carried out with PBS and different dilutions of PUUV (from 10 to 1 × 10 4 PUUV particle-associated virus genome equivalents). After the complete inactivation procedure, samples were examined for the presence of PUUV with qRT-PCR. For all dilutions, the differences in virus titers recovered were within 0.5 log of the virus stock controls. Mock samples containing no virus but treated with disinfectant were also tested for their effect on Vero E6 cell monolayers. These mock samples had no adverse effect on the Vero E6 cell monolayers. The ultracentrifugation washing step was thus considered to have removed the disinfectants prior to virus titration and no additional steps to neutralize the disinfectants during the procedure were taken. Hantaviruses represent a hazard for hospital and laboratory workers and thus it is important to determine the virucidal power of various disinfectant agents under strict experimental conditions. With the Klein-Deforest scheme, human viruses can be divided into groups A, B, and C with respect to inactivation of lipophilic (enveloped, lipid membrane) and hydrophilic (naked) viruses (Klein and Deforest, 1983) . The Bunyaviridae are a family of negative-stranded, lipid-enveloped, spherical RNA viruses, and thus are classified into the lipid-enveloped virus containing group A. Group A viruses are susceptible to a wide variety of detergents and alcohols attaining the lipid-envelope. But there is little data available specific about hantavirus inactivation. Chloroform, ␤-propiolactone, sodium hypochloride, ethanol and phenol have been described as good disinfectant agents for hantaviruses (Schmaljohn et al., 1999) . However, chloroform, ␤-propiolactone and phenol can induce cancer in humans, and are therefore not recommended as disinfectant agents in laboratories. Recently, effective inactivation of Hantaan virus with methanol and paraformaldehyde has been demonstrated (Kraus et al., 2005) . This study confirmed complete inactivation of PUUV with methanol after 10 min (see Table 1 ), but in contrast to expectations, inactivation of PUUV with absolute ethanol was completed only after 30 min. After a 10 min inactivation with ethanol, the concentration of PUUV was 1.7 × 10 5 geq/mL (Table 1 ). The inactivation of PUUV with a 70% solution of ethanol, also took 30 min to be completed. After an inactivation of 10 min, the concentration of PUUV was 3.6 × 10 5 geq/mL (Table 1) . These findings were confirmed with focus assay. After inactivation with absolute ethanol or with a 70% solution of ethanol during 30 min, virus could not be detected by using focus assay. Applying focus assay after 10 min of inactivation, however, gave 6.0 × 10 3 focus forming units and 1.2 × 10 4 focus forming units for inactivation with absolute ethanol and a 70% ethanol solution, respectively. Peracetic acid is a strong oxidizing biocide with rapid biocidal action at relatively low concentrations. PUUV was inactivated by peracetic acid at a concentration of 1% in a timeframe of 10 min but due to the hazardous nature of this product, caution has to be taken when using this product in standard laboratory practice. Inactivation of PUUV by sodium hypochloride was complete with a 1% solution. Sodium hypochloride can be used against a wide variety of microbial and viral organisms (Sopwith et al., 2002) , but it can be corrosive for stainless steel surfaces. Dettol ® or parachlorometaxylenol, a common household disinfectant, was effective against PUUV, in a 1% (v/v) solution. Successful inactivation with Dettol ® of several enveloped and non-enveloped viruses has been described (Wood and Payne, 1998) . In solution, Virkon ® S is activated to form hypochlorous acid, which has been shown to be a strong oxidizing agent (Spickett et al., 2000) . This study has demonstrated that Virkon ® S is effective for inactivating PUUV at the lowest (1%) concentration tested. Moreover, a 1% solution of Virkon ® S is classified as a non-irritant to the skin and eyes (McCormick and Maheshwari, 2004) . Clidox ® (chlorine dioxide) is an alternative to chlorine as a primary disinfectant. It is a strong oxidant reported to be effective against several bacteria and viruses (Eleraky et al., 2002; Li et al., 2004; Thurston-Enriquez et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005) . Clidox ® was shown to be effective for inactivating PUUV at the lowest concentration tested (1% solution). Although the use of chlorine dioxide has some disadvantages including the oxidation of iron surfaces and the formation of organic halides, its use can be recommended since, like Virkon ® S, it is effective against several bacteria and viruses including PUUV. Halamid-d ® is a disinfectant used against bacteria, viruses and fungi. It is proven to be effective against SARS coronavirus (www.halamid.com). A 1% solution of Halamid-d ® was found to be effective against PUUV in this study. The same study layout was used to test the efficacy of these disinfectants for the inactivation of Hantaan virus (HTNV), a pathogenic hantavirus endemic in Asia. Identical results to PUUV were obtained (data not shown). One of the goals of the study was to determine whether qRT-PCR could be used as a way to detect viral inactivation. A recognized problem with RT-PCR and qRT-PCR detection of viral RNA, however, is that the presence of RNA does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus (Gassilloud et al., 2003; Suarez et al., 2003) . Applying an RNase/proteinase K digestion before RNA extraction, allows the detection of intact viral particles only, i.e. infectious virus. The concentration of virus found by using qRT-PCR correlated with the focus forming units found by focus assay. The qRT-PCR detects specific viral RNA strains, whereas a focus assay is based on the ability of a single infectious virus particle to give rise to a macroscopic visual amount of virus particles. Specifically, a single virus particle, infecting a single cell, will give rise to new virus particles, which can infect surrounding cells. During the initial incubation of a focus assay, the surrounding cells can also be infected. If new virus particles are produced by the surrounding cells, the different foci will be recognized as one. This can explain possibly the lower concentration of focus forming units found, in comparison with the particle-associated virus genome equivalents as found with the qRT-PCR. In conclusion, the commercially available products Clidox ® , Halamid-d ® and Virkon ® S represent a rapid and relatively safe way to decontaminate surfaces of possible contamination by Puumala virus and probably also other hantaviruses. The results of this study suggest that these products can be used in solutions of 1-2%, with contact times greater than 10 min, for inactivating effectively Puumala virus.
