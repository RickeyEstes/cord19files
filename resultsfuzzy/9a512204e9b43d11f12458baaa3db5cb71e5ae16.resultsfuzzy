Sample preparation, and Illumina sequencing In order to achieve comprehensive representation and characterization of L. japonica transcriptome, we performed RNA-seq-based deep sequencing for nine tissues, namely, shoot apex, stem, leaf-1 (youngest leaf), leaf-2 (second leaf), leaf-3 (mature leaf), green floral bud, white floral bud, white flower, and yellow flower (Fig. 1) . Total RNA was extracted from all nine tissues, and quality was assessed using a bioanalyzer. RNA samples with RIN (RNA integrity number) over 8 were selected for mRNA preparation, fragmentation, cDNA synthesis, and library preparation for an RNA-seq experiment. Each library, thus prepared, was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq TM 2000 platform, yielding a total of 120 M paired-end reads with 101 bps as average sequence length. Raw reads generated from Illumina HiSeq TM were preprocessed using the Trimmomatic program [42] for the removal of adaptor sequences, reads with a sequence length \500, low quality and ambiguous reads, yielding over 110 M paired-end clean reads, or 22 Gbps (base pairs) of reads in total (Table S1 ). Mean phred score, which serves as a bench mark for assessing the quality of the sequenced reads, were [36 across all nine tissues of Lonicera japonica; \1 % of raw reads were dropped by the Trimmomatic program based on low-quality reads or being adaptor sequences. This indicates that our RNA-seq data was of high quality, and adequate for de novo transcriptome assembly. The study overview is shown in supplementary Fig. S1 . De novo transcriptome assembly for L. japonica Success for any transcriptome-based study, especially when complete genome sequences are not available, depends upon the completeness and quality of an assembled transcriptome, which in turn depends upon the assembler program, and assembly parameters, particularly kmer size [43, 44] . Although, most de novo transcriptome assemblers rely on partitioning the sequence data into many individual de Bruijin graphs based on certain kmer size, where kmers are shorter than the reads length, output from each assembler is very different. Comparison of several popular transcriptome assemblers using different datasets revealed that none of them consistently performed to generate best assemblies [45] . Recent studies, therefore, have proposed the use of multiple assemblers in order to maximize diversity of the de novo assembled transcripts [46] [47] [48] . Therefore, in order to generate a complete de novo transcriptome assembly for L. japonica, we used three popular assemblers, namely, SOAPdenovo-Trans [49] , Trinity [50] , and CLC Genomics Workbench 8.0.3 (https:// www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/). For SOAPdenovo-Trans, we performed de novo transcriptome assemblies using different kmer values, namely, 31, 41, 51, 63, 71, and 91, resulting in six different transcriptome assemblies. Analyzing assembly stats for six de novo transcriptome assemblies generated using SOAPdenovo-Trans revealed kmer 31-based transcriptome assembly as the best, with 95,718,128 bps reads incorporated into 120,798 unigenes, with an N50 value of 1420 and the number of unigenes with sequence length [500 bps as 52,789 (43.7 %) ( Table 1 ). The Trinity program-based de novo transcriptome assembly using default kmer (kmer as 25) resulted in the incorporation of 309,874,152 bps into 351,356 unigenes, with an N50 value of 1480 bps and the number of unigenes with sequence length [500 bps as 175,121 (49.8 %) ( Table 1) . For the CLC Genomics Workbench, we used default kmer size to perform de novo transcriptome assembly, resulting in assembly of 88,253,035 bps into 132,053 unigenes, with an N50 value of 975 and the number of unigenes with sequence length [500 bps as 49,831 (37.7 %) ( Table 1) . The transcriptome assemblies, thus obtained from SOAPdenovo-Trans (kmer31), Trinity, and CLC Genomics Workbench were combined, and sequence redundancies were removed using the CD-HIT-EST program [51, 52] , resulting in a final de novo transcriptome assembly for L. japonica by incorporating 220,651,304 bps into 243,185 unigenes, with an N50 value of 1561 and the number of unigenes with sequence length [500 bps as 122,493 (50.4 %) ( Table 1) . Comparison of transcriptome assemblies resulting from individual assemblers, or one resulting by combining the output of three assemblers showed an advantage for this approach of combining multiple assemblers, as we observed a significant gain in N50 values, average unigene length, mean unigene length, and percentage of sequences with a length [500 bps for the combined assembly. The guanine-cytosine (GC) % and length distribution for resultant transcriptome assembly for L. japonica is shown in Fig. S2a , b, respectively, with average GC % for all unigenes being 40.82 %, while 10,374 unigenes had a sequence length [3000 bps. The resultant de novo transcriptome assembly for L. japonica was improved compared to earlier published transcriptome assemblies, with a significant increase in N50 value, and overall contig length distribution. The unigene sequences derived from L. japonica transcriptome assembly were subjected to further characterization. A Blastx program-based [53, 54] homology search was performed for L. japonica unigenes against the NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database (http://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov; formatted on Oct 2015) using an E value cut-off of \10 -5 , and the maximum number of allowed hits for each query was limited to 20. The top hit for each query sequence was used for the transcriptome annotation, and subsequent analysis and characterization. A Blastx-based homology search for L. japonica resulted in the annotation of 99,938 (41.1 %) unigenes (Table S2) , while 143,251 unigenes had no significant sequence homology against the NCBI-nr database (Fig. S3a ). Blastx results were used to extract associated gene ontology (GO) terms, to assign an enzyme commission (EC) number, and associated Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway. A total of 91,745 unigenes were assigned to at least one GO term or KEGG pathway information (Fig. S3a ). An E-value distribution plot for unigenes with a blast hit showed [89 % of aligned sequences having significant sequence homology against the NCBI-nr database (Fig. S3b ). Sequence similarity distribution analysis for sequences with a blast hit showed 65,213 (65.23 %) unigenes having sequence similarity [75 % (Fig. S3c ). These results, therefore, suggest that the annotation unigenes from Blastx results can be used reliably for further functional characterization. Top-hit species distribution analysis for unigenes showed [85 % of all annotated transcripts having high sequence similarity against six plant species, namely, Vitis vinifera, Populus trichocarpa, Ricinus communis, Glycine max, Medicago truncatula, and Arabidopsis thaliana ( Fig. S3d ). Within these six plant species, L. japonica transcriptome assembly showed highest similarity to Vitis vinifera, with 50 % of annotated top-hit unigenes being derived from it. Top-hit species distribution results were similar to previous reports, where [50 % of annotated transcripts were assigned to Vitis vinifera [6] . GO-based functional classification for L. japonica transcriptome assembly was performed using the Blast2GO program v 3.0 [55] , resulting in a total of 178 GO categories being assigned to the annotated unigenes in three broad categories, namely, biological process (89), molecular function (53) , and cellular component (36) (Table S3 ). GO distribution analysis by level 3, and GO level distribution for three broad categories for L. japonica transcriptome assembly are shown in Fig. 2a, b . Several metabolic processes, such as organic substance metabolic process, primary metabolic process, cellular metabolic process, biosynthetic process, and nitrogen compound metabolic process were the top five GO terms being enriched within L. japonica transcriptome. For the molecular function category, GO terms corresponding to heterocyclic compound binding, organic cyclic compound binding, transferase activity, small molecule binding, and hydrolase activity were the top five processes being enriched. For the cellular component category, GO categories corresponding to intracellular, intracellular part, intracellular organelle, membrane-bounded organelle, and cell periphery were the first five GO terms assigned to the majority of unigenes. KEGG database-based functional characterization of L. japonica transcriptome assembly The KEGG pathway database serves as a catalog for different cellular components and their interactions within various metabolic pathways, and allows functional annotation of the unigenes by assigning their potential role in b GO-level distribution for three main GO categories across L. japonica transcriptome assembly. GO terms for all unigenes were assigned based on Blast search results using the Blast2GO program metabolic pathways [56] . Pathway-based transcriptome classification provides an overview of active metabolic processes within an organism, which when coupled with transcriptome expression analysis, gives an important insight of different metabolic processes across different tissues or conditions. Blastx results for L. japonica were used to assign associated KEGG pathways to all the unigenes, resulting in 25,268 unigenes grouped into 142 pathways (Table S4 ). The first fifty KEGG pathways based on the assigned number of unigenes are shown in Fig. 3 . Starch and sucrose metabolism, purine metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, pyrimidine metabolism, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis were the top five KEGG pathways based on the number of assigned unigenes. Key metabolic pathways, such as phenylpropanoid metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis, and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, which synthesizes precursors for the biosynthesis of CGA and secoiridoids, were assigned to 231, 137, and 124 unigenes, respectively (Table S4) .
