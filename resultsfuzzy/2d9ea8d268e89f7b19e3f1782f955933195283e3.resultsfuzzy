The TTR of both methods was evaluated to also elucidate economical aspects on the capability of the MLPA method. It comprises the period of time from the beginning of the analysis of a sample, including the purification of the nucleic acids, to its final result. TTR consists of the hands on time (HOT) and the periods of incubation and was determined for a typical run with three samples by measurement with a stopwatch. First, the time requirement for the extraction of nucleic acids was analyzed. For a typical test of three samples, a TTR of 85 min (incubation 25 min, HOT 60 min) was determined for the RT PCR method, which demands the purification of a supplementary negative control, in comparison to a TTR of 77 min (incubation 25 min, HOT 52 min) for the RespiFinder Smart22. Using the RealAccurate Respiratory RT PCR Kit, the analysis of the complete respiratory panel in three clinical samples with the corresponding negative and positive controls requires 49 LightCycler positions. A LightCycler carousel for 20 l capillaries holds 32 capillaries, thus two runs are needed to test three samples. Due to the possibility to use two LightCyclers in parallel, the period of incubation of 123 min was counted only once. HOT was 83 min for the processing of three samples, resulting in a total TTR of 206 min. In an analysis using the RespiFinder Smart22 two vials per sample have to be processed which have to be manually transferred between pre-amplification, hybridization, and 2-step PCR with melting curve analysis. The analysis of three specimens took a HOT of 34 min and a period of incubation of 322 min. The total TTR for the parallel analysis of three samples was 206 min [123 min (59.7%) period of incubation and 83 min (40.3%) HOT] for the RealAccurate Respiratory RT PCR Kit, and 356 min [322 min (90.4%) period of incubation and 34 min (9.6%) HOT] for the RespiFinder Smart22 (Fig. 1) .
