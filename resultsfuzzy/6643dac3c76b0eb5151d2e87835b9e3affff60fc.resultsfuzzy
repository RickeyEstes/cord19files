2.1. NPCs generated from mouse induced pluripotent stem cells are functionally similar to postnatal GFP-NPCs Mouse iPSCs were generated by retroviral transduction of Yamanaka factors (Oct3/4 Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc) into C57BL/6 fibroblasts using established protocols (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006) . Mouse iPSCs were grown and differentiated into NPCs according to the schematic outlined in Fig. 1A . Feeder-free iPSCs were generated by supplementing cells with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and stained positive for the stem cell markers-Oct4 and Sox2 (Fig. 1B) . iPSCs were differentiated into NPCs by addition of EGF (epidermal growth factor) and bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor) and were positive for neuronal stem cell markers such as Sox2 (Fig. 1Ci) , Nestin (Fig. 1Cii) , and Pax6 ( Fig. 1Ciii) as assessed by immunofluorescence analysis. iPSC-NPCs were then differentiated for 6 days following withdrawal of EGF and bFGF. Similar to postnatal GFP-NPCs (henceforth referred to as GFP-NPCs) (Carbajal et al., 2010) . iPSC-NPCs also terminally differentiated into oligodendrocytes (Fig. 1Di) , neurons ( Fig. 1Dii ) and astrocytes ( Fig. 1Diii) (Fig. 1E ). These findings illustrate that iPSC-NPCs have similar differentiation properties as compared to postnatal-derived GFP-NPCs.
