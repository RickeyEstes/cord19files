Membrane lipids are rich in unsaturated fatty acids that are most susceptible to oxidative processes. Especially, linoleic acid and arachidonic acid are targets of lipid per oxidation . The absorbance data of linoleic acid peroxidation determined by the FTC method at 37°C after the addition of different concentrations of the ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine (0.5-2.5 mg/ml and 0.010 mg-0.050 mg/ml). The oxidation of linoleic acid without addition of extracts and lycorine were accompanied by rapid increases of the lipid peroxidation value when compared with ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine treated group. The FTC results show maximum inhibition of lipid peroxidation in linoleic acid by ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L), lycorine and tocopherol was found to be 26.25 ± 0.25%, 19.30 ± 0.23% and 56 ± 1.81 at concentrations of 2.5 mg/ml, 0.050 mg/ml and 0.125 mg/ml, respectively (Figs. 1-3). However, significant differences in antioxidant activities were found among ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine at all the concentration. Similarly, our results concurred with the previous report (Ozsoy et al., 2000) ; it was found that different concentrations of the extract of Smilax excelsa (0.16-2.5 mg/ml) were added and significant concentration dependent inhibition of lipid peroxidation was observed. The model method of scavenging the stable DPPH radical is widely used to evaluate the free radical scavenging ability of various samples (Koleva et al., 2001) . DPPH is a stable nitrogen centered free radical the color of which changes from violet to yellow upon reduction by either the process of hydrogen or electron donation. Substances which are able to perform this reaction can be considered as antioxidants and, therefore, radical scavengers (Dehpour et al., 2009) . Figs. 1 and 2 show the dose response curves of DPPH radical scavenging activities of the ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine. The free radical scavenging effect of ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine on DPPH radicals increased from 0.5 mg to 2.5 mg/ml and 0.010 mg to 0.050 mg/ml, respectively and was 20.5 ± .023% and 20.92% at concentrations of 2.5 mg/ml and 0.050 mg/ml, respectively, the results show that the ethanol extract of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine showed significant DPPH radical scavenging activity when compared with tocopherol. Superoxide radical is known to be very harmful to cellular components as a precursor of the more reactive oxygen species contributing to tissue damage and various diseases (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1999) . The scavenging activities of the extracts on superoxide radicals are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. It was found that superoxide scavenging activities of the ethanol extract of C. asiaticum and lycorine increases with an increase of their concentrations. The ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) (27.69 ± 0.16%), lycorine (16.29 ± 0.74%) and tocopherol (58 ± 35%) exhibited maximum percentage of superoxide radical scavenging activity at 2.5 mg/ml, 0.050 mg/ml and 0.125 mg/ml, respectively. However, other concentrations also exhibited significant superoxide radical scavenging properties. The increase of superoxide radical scavenging activity with antioxidant thus indicates the consumption superoxide radical by ethanol extract of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine in the reaction mixture. Hydrogen peroxide itself is not very reactive but it can sometimes be toxic to cells, since it may give rise to hydroxyl radicals inside the cell (Halliwell, 1991) . Hydrogen peroxide is unique in that it can be converted to the highly damaging hydroxyl radical or be catalyzed and excreted harmlessly as water. The ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine were capable of scavenging hydrogen peroxide in a concentration dependent manner (Figs. 1 and 2) . The ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) showed more potent scavenging hydrogen peroxide than the lycorine. Moreover, compared with positive control, less activity was observed by 25.67 ± 0.17%, 23.07 ± 0.31% and 48 ± 27% at concentrations of 2.5 mg/ml, 0.050 mg/ml and 0.125 mg/ml, respectively. Scavenging of H 2 O 2 by ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine may be attributed to donate the electrons to H 2 O 2 and thus neutralizing it to water. AAPH is a water soluble azo compound which is used extensively as a free radical generator often in the study of lipid peroxidation and the characterization of antioxidants (Noguchi et al., 1998; Rice Evans and Miller, 1994) . The erythrocyte membrane contains abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids which are very susceptible to free radical induced peroxidation. Since the generation rate of free radical from the decomposition of AAPH at physiological temperature can be easily controlled, this water soluble azo compound can be used as free radical resource to attack the erythrocyte membrane to
