To investigate the effect of the pollutant source location, three different emission distances around the building at every 15 °were examined, as detailed in the model description. At each considered location, a simulation using the generic rectangular-shaped building was conducted, and the simulated pollutant concentration distributions were analyzed. As depicted in Fig. 1 , the pollutant source location was defined by the position angle, θ , and the emission distance, r , between the pollutant source and the center of the building. The effects of θ and r on the distribution of K C on different faces and levels of the rectangular-shaped building, as a generic model, were analyzed, and a mathematical model was proposed at the end of the section. Fig. 6 shows the normalized pollutant concentration on the windward, side and leeward faces of the building as a function of θ with different emission distances. As illustrated in Fig. 6 (a) , for the windward face, K C was the highest at θ = 0 °, then decreased rapidly to almost zero as θ increased to approximately 30 °. With the increase of r , the maximum K C at θ = 0 °decreased. For the side face, as shown in Fig 6 (b) , K C had two peaks at a θ ≈ 0 °and θ ≈ 180 °, whereas the location of the first peak moved to a higher value and that of the second to a lower value with the decrease of r . On the other hand, K C was very small between two critical angles [ θ 1 , θ 2 ], while the values of θ 1 and θ 2 were dependent on r . As depicted in Fig 6 (c) , K C on the leeward face also had two peaks near θ ≈ 0 °and θ ≈ 180 °, respectively. However, the first peak was rather low while the second peak very high. Also, similar to the side face, there was a range of angle between two critical values [ θ 1 , θ 2 ], in which K C was very small. The critical angles were different from those for the side face, and they were also dependent on r. Generally, Kc on the leeward face was much higher than on other faces when θ was close to 180 °.
