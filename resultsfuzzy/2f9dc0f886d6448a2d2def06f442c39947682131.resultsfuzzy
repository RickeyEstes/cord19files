The 2018 annual review determined that, given their potential to cause a public health emergency and the absence of efficacious drugs and/or vaccines, there is an urgent need for accelerated R&D for: â€¢ The reader should note that the order of diseases on this list does not denote any ranking of priority, as there were no significant differences between the scores and no consensus on a ranked order. Arenaviral haemorrhagic fevers other than Lassa fever; chikungunya; highly pathogenic coronaviral diseases other than MERS and SARS; emergent non-polio enteroviruses (including EV71, D68); and Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome all pose major public health threats and require further R&D, including improved surveillance and diagnostic methods. They should be monitored carefully and considered again at the next annual review. Efforts in the interim to understand and mitigate them were encouraged. The concept of "Disease X" was defined in the 2017 R&D Blueprint priority list of diseases as "any disease identified by the Blueprint's decision instrument for new diseases". It was formally added in the website in March 2017. Disease X represents the awareness that a serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently not recognized to cause human disease. Disease X may also be a known pathogen that has changed its epidemiological characteristics, for example by increasing its transmissibility or severity. The inclusion of Disease X on the priority list makes it clear that the Blueprint explicitly seeks to enable cross-cutting R&D preparedness that as far as possible is also relevant for currently unknown diseases. This list of priority diseases does not aim to predict the next epidemic, and it is not exhaustive. Instead, it aims to focus WHO and global research efforts on diseases that need urgent R&D for the development of therapeutics, vaccines and diagnostics. Diseases on this list have been reported in 2018 in several countries, aptly demonstrating the importance and relevance of such a list: Lassa fever in Nigeria, Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nipah virus disease in India, as well as several cases of CCHF, MERS and Rift Valley fever. By focusing research attention on these emerging threats, health systems will be better prepared the next time they appear.
