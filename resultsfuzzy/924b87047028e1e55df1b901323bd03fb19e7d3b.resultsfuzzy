We evaluated the utility of the S. pneumoniae UAT among the 440 of 599 cases (73.4%) who underwent UAT. Pneumococcal urinary antigen was detected for 248 of 440 cases (56.4%). The baseline characteristics of these cases are summarized in Table 4 . Cases showing positive UAT results had a significantly higher mean CRP level than those showing negative UAT results (P ¼ 0.007). It was difficult to determine the relationship between UAT results and procalcitonin, because only a limited number of cases had available data for procalcitonin (26% of cases), but considering only data from 2013, from which period 81.5% of cases had available data, there was no significant difference in the UAT positive rate according to procalcitonin level (P ¼ 0.390). Cases with lobar pneumonia and diabetes had significantly higher UAT positive rates (P ¼ 0.006 and P ¼ 0.034, respectively). The positive rate of UAT was not influenced by age, sex, comorbidities, or complications, except for diabetes. Prior antibiotic use also did not affect the UAT positive rate (P ¼ 0.296).
