The major review of empirical and theoretical PoE studies presented by Roy and Chattopadhyay [4] provides a number of plausible solutions and partial resolution of the problem. The experimental evidence was challenged by Jensen and Ginzburg [5] , who showed that most examples proposed as evidence of PoE are insufficient to justify the phenomenon in natural systems. A common example of PoE is the process of lake eutrophication. Enrichment of aquatic systems appears to increase the carrying capacity of producers and leads to a bloom that covers the lake. PoE may be suggested as a cause of this phenomenon, but in fact it is the limiting dissolved oxygen that is responsible for system collapse in this case, irrespective of the enrichment response. Other empirical studies using the Didinium-Paramecium system were carried out by Luckinbill [6] and Veilleux [7] . Both authors showed that the system proposed by Gause [57] could be modified to allow coexistence of predator and prey. Addition of methyl cellulose prevented the extinction of any of the species in the system and provided an artificial refuge for prey species. Similarly, a study of Rotifer-Algae by Fussmann et al. showed that predator extinction resulted from enrichment [8] . Similar to the experiments of Luckinbill and Veilleux, the results showed that reducing nutrient input can bring the system from a region of consistent predator extinction to a region of coexistence. Capture of this ubiquitous dynamic behavior involved in PoE remains an open problem from both theoretical and ecological perspectives. Here we considered the Rosenzweig model of PoE to provide a plausible solution from a new perspective that considers the ecological memory that exists for most species. Most of the solutions proposed so far involve species-level organization and ignore the community level. As a consequence, the impact of memory on system dynamics has been neglected. This memory can be well captured by a fractional derivative consisting of non-local operators. The memory effect can also be incorporated using other frameworks such as Volterra integral equations and delay differential equations [58] . Volterra integral equations describe systems with continuously distributed memory over all past events. For example, the spread of epidemics with a general (not necessarily exponential) distribution of infection times can Table 1 Parameter values used to solve (3.2) (taken from [3] ). be modeled by Volterra integral equations. In another example, the evolution of a set of competing biological species with memory can be modeled through a system of integro-differential equations, which can be reduced to a system of Volterra integral equations [58] . Besides population dynamics, the evolution of capital stock under an investment strategy can be described by a Volterra integral equation. In an ODE system in ecology, the representation of a process by a function is often based on experiments. The response of the function chosen can be fitted to experimental data. This functional response should not be derived mechanistically but phenomenologically [59] . The functional response may be prey-and/or predator-dependent according to experimental results. Naturally, these types of experiment can have various time lengths and integrate memory. Note that even if an ODE describes an instantaneous process, the notion of instant depends on the time scale considered, whereas FDEs have the property of fading memory and depend on the range of α (0 < α < 1). Such memories can describe current events with the collective information from preceding events, while events in the far past can often be neglected compared to contributions from the near past [60] . Volterra defined the notion of fading memory as ''the principle of dissipation of hereditary action'' [61] . Podlubny [44] called this the ''short memory principle''. In this study we used FDEs to capture the memory effect in an ecological framework. Naturally we expect that our modified Rosenzweig model (3.2) with memory characterized by α ∈ (0, 1) is more stable than the classical Rosenzweig model with integer α(=1). Note that α plays a key role in understanding memory effects on species. The system sensitivity with respect to α is an important aspect to be discussed. We analyzed the sensitivity of model (3.2) with input parameter α and output the range of K up to which the system is stable (Appendix C). We observe that when the value of α decreases, the system has a high elasticity index, that is, the system is more sensitive with respect to α. Since most FDEs do not have exact analytic solutions, approximation and numerical techniques must be used. Several analytical and numerical methods exist for solving FDEs. For numerical solution of (3.2), we used the FDE12 package in Matlab which is an implementation of the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton predictor-corrector method [62] [63] [64] [65] . The parameter values listed in Table 1 were used. Fig. 1(a) shows that the classical Rosenzweig model with no memory is stable for a carrying capacity of K = 48. When we enrich the prey carrying capacity (K = 60, K = 80) and keep the other parameter fixed, the system destabilizes ( Fig. 1(b) and (c) ). However, when we incorporate the memory effect in the classical model with α ∈ (0, 1), the system no longer shows a pattern of destabilization on enrichment (Figs. 2 and 3 ). Fig. 4 shows that the system has a memory threshold (α ≈ 0.2332) below which it is always stable, even if we further increase the carrying capacity without restriction. Mathematically this intermediate value of α can be interpreted as a filter with partial memory that falls between two extreme filters with complete memory and with no memory [66] . The individual-level organization discussed above is mainly associated with the behavioral aspects of predator-prey relationships and inducible or morphological prey mechanisms. Learning and memory can modify these anti-predator behavioral responses, which is key to making the link between individual-level processes and higher-level organization in ecological systems [14] . For example, prey refuge is one of the most manifest and well-coordinated actions based on memories of past events that lead to cultural learning [14] . To illustrate this issue, we incorporated a refuge parameter in the fractional-order Rosenzweig Conditions for which the modified Rosenzweig model is stable are given in Appendix B. The region of stability for the corresponding enrichment parameter (K ) and refuge parameter (m) expands if we gradually increase the memory effect in comparison to a system with no memory (Fig. 5) . Estimation of the model parameters for such a system is an important task from a data analysis perspective. The total least squares approach is suitable for this purpose and we applied this method to illustrate model (3.2) and fitted an estimated curve for a simulated data set (Appendix C). This memory phenomenon is clearly an approximate tradeoff between fractional differentiation and stability. Against this backdrop, we conclude that ecological memories can protect a system against destabilization and may represent a potential agent for resolving PoE from a new perspective using FDEs.
