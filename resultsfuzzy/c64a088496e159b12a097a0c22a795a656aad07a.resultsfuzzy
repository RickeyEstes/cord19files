Condensation of sodium diethyl oxalacetate with equimolar aldehyde and methylamine in refluxing ethanol gave compounds 1a-d in a one-pot reaction manner (Scheme 1). Although the yields were moderate, the products could be easily filtered out of the reaction mixture and could be prepared in multigram scale. The structures of the aldehyde components are summarized in Table 1 p-OH phenyl 2,3-dioxo-5-aryl pyrrolidinone 2b was successfully prepared by refluxing 1b in acidic solution for 7 hours [2] , after an attempt using a reported method of decarboxylation in refluxing MeCN failed to give the desired product [11, 12] . Consequently, the reaction of 2b with equivalent amounts of various hydrazine salts afforded the corresponding 2-oxo-5-aryl-3-hydrazone pyrrolidine derivatives (Scheme 2). The structures of the hydrazones are summarized in Table 2 . Table 2 . Hydrazones of 3a-3d. The structures of all new synthesized compounds were confirmed by FTIR, NMR and elemental analysis results. The prominent characteristic of C=O bands of the pyrrolidinone 2b disappeared and new absorption bands corresponding to the NH group were observed at 3320-3375 cm -1 in the IR spectra of all the hydrazone derivatives. New NHN=C broad proton singlets at 9.66-11.80 ppm were also observed in all the 1 H-NMR spectra of all hydrazone derivatives.
