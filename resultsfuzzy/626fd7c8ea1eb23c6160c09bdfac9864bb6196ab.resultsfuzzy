The OLS analysis results are presented in Table 5 . The adjusted R-squared is 0.71, which is quite high compared to the results of other empirical studies of the CIM. The analysis results confirm several important aspects of the CIM. All collective interest variables are found to be positive and statistically significant at the 1% level, indicating that expected reciprocity, perceived levels of group cohesion and personal influence on outcome and discontent level all enter into the decision calculus of the average homeowner. Of the four collective interest variables, discontent level (DISC) is the strongest predictor of PART, though its estimated coefficient is not statistically different from that of INFL at the 5% level. Homeowners participate more if they have higher levels of discontent with the current housing management outcome. These results confirm Yau's (2010) findings that the approach of homeowners to building care in Hong Kong is predominantly reactive. These residents are not active in housing management affairs unless they can no longer tolerate the problems occurring in their buildings. Perceived outcome influence, INFL, is found to be nearly as important as discontent level. As implied by the results, even when the perceived collective benefits of housing management activism are high, homeowner participation may be unlikely because homeowners see themselves as incapable of changing the collective outcomes. The positive sign of the coefficient of EXRE suggests that homeowners who believe that their neighbours will reciprocate expect more benefits than costs from housing management activism, whereas this is not true of those who do not believe that their neighbours will reciprocate. Moreover, PART increases with COHE, indicating that homeowners who perceive stronger cohesion among the co-owners in their buildings are more active participants. Both variables gauging the collective efficacy of the 'homeowners groups' have an influence on individual homeowner decisions regarding housing management activism. These results confirm Weible's (2008) proposition that a group's collective efficacy shapes individual members' expectations, which in turn determines their participation (and non-participation). Selective cost measures how the typical demographic variables considered in other studies fit into the CIM for housing management activism. Although gender has no significant effect on housing participation level, better-educated and older homeowners engage more actively in housing management affairs. Interestingly, the estimated coefficient of HINC is negative, but it is not significant even at the 10% level. That means that income shows no effect on housing management activism. This is probably because the higher opportunity costs of participation for high-income offset the benefits. The analysis results indicate that both selective benefit variables are positively correlated with the level of housing management activism. The estimated coefficient of the variable MVAL is significant at the 1% level, and the coefficient of the variable LIFE is significant at the 5% level. Nevertheless, there is no statistical difference between the magnitudes of the two coefficients at the 5% level, indicating that the two variables are of nearly equal importance. As one can infer from these results, homeowners who are more active in housing management affairs tend to value the collective good of better housing management higher. At the same time, expressive benefit is a strong motivator for housing management activism. There are several important points that emerge from these results. First, as far as the sustainable management of the housing stock is concerned, routine maintenance and timely rehabilitation are more preferable to demolition and rebuilding because the former methods are more economical, environmentally friendly and socially favourable (Jones & Clements-Croome, 2004; Yau & Chan, 2008) . However, the empirical findings of this study suggest that although self-perceived personal influence affects the likelihood of housing management activism, homeowners will participate only if they are dissatisfied with housing management outcomes. These findings reflect the reactive nature of these homeowners to housing problems: as long as they can tolerate existing housing management outcomes, they continue letting others do the work for them. This free-riding dogma essentially creates a deadlock in building care in Hong Kong. Secondly, in decisions regarding participation, perceived group efficacy in achieving a desirable outcome is important. A homeowner will not participate in housing management if he or she regards other homeowners as free-riders. In addition, homeowner participation will be unlikely if the individual in question thinks that the group cannot work effectively to achieve better housing management for the building. In other words, participation decisions depend very much on the individual homeowner's perceptions of his or her neighbours. Even when a person thinks that he or she is capable of making a change, his or her participation may be in vain if other homeowners do not participate or cannot work well with each other. This observation actually echoes the views of Bengtsson (1998 Bengtsson ( , 2000 who comments on the resident dynamics in housing management. Predictions regarding others' behaviour determine homeowner actions. Last but not least, despite the insignificant coefficients of the variables MALE and HINC, the analysis results generally support the expectations of the CIM. The expected value of participation not only depends on selective interests and the cost of participation, which are private but also rests on the perceived value of the collective good to be produced and the chances of success in providing the good. As deduced from the analysis results, an individual homeowner will choose to participate in housing management under the following conditions: (1) If the homeowner perceives that his or her selective cost of participation exceeds the selective benefit and if the expected collective interest is greater than the negative net selective benefit; or (2) If there is zero expected collective interest and the net selective benefit perceived by the homeowner is positive. On this basis, we can offer insight into how the housing mismanagement problem in Hong Kong might be resolved. Given that the selective costs of participation are relatively fixed, we can boost the expected value of housing management activism by increasing either the selective benefits of participation or the collective interests. In the first approach, institutional arrangements or economic incentives can play a role. Currently, if the majority of homeowners at an owners' meeting come to a consensus (e.g., a decision to upgrade the elevator system), the minority may not participate. The owners' corporation can only bring the case to court to bring the uncooperative owners in line. Since this method is often too costly and time-consuming, it is not used very often. The resolution in question will then be discarded or simply put on hold. This frequently occurs and is a major reason why plans for improving building conditions or management are suspended. Legislation can be developed to punish uncooperative owners or those who do not participate even if the majority of homeowners in a building collectively agreed. This tactic increases the costs of free-riding, which indirectly increases the selective benefits for those who participate in housing management. The government can also educate homeowners about the economic benefits of better housing management (e.g., higher property rental values and shorter downtime for services) and economic losses that can arise from housing mismanagement (e.g., higher medical costs and huge damages payable to the victims of building-related accidents). However, it is sometimes difficult for the average homeowner to visualise the association between housing management performance and property value because with the exception of physical conditions, the various performance aspects of housing management (e.g., financial management and dispute resolution) are not easily observable by outsiders. Therefore, assessment schemes for benchmarking the overall performance of housing management should be devised and implemented for all apartment buildings in Hong Kong. This step would make additional information available to the market and create a 'league of value' in the form of higher-scored properties that should command a higher rent or value. With a view toward the potential economic benefits, homeowners may perceive greater value in housing management and may be more likely to participate actively in housing management. Another approach would be to enhance collective interests by reinforcing social bonding among homeowners. If a strong sense of community and cohesion exists among neighbours within a building, homeowners may hold very similar values regarding housing management. As a result, each of them will expect a greater degree of reciprocity from the other and a close working relationship will be there to keep their building a pleasant place to live. The government and owners' associations can help amplify the collective or group efficacy in achieving the collective good by fostering long-term partnerships among homeowners. More supports or subsidies should be offered by the government and owners' associations to organise social gatherings and activities which can bring homeowners together. Mechanisms like mediation should also be put in place to resolve disputes or conflicts between homeowners in an amicable and non-destructive manner. Otherwise, a long-term relationship cannot be ensured.
