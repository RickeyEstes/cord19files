HTLV-1 seroprevalence is characterized by an age-dependent increase that is similar in diverse geographic areas. Among children, the prevalence rate of both sexes is low, about 1%, and the male-to-female ratio is 1. Starting with adolescence, however, the prevalence increases and infection rates between males and females diverge, with female rates exceeding male rates. This trend continues into adulthood, and whereas male rates plateau by the age of 40 years, female rates continue to increase and peak at about age 60 years [7] . The reason for this divergence is ascribed to the fact that although sexual transmission is bidirectional, male-to-female transmission occurs 10 times much more efficiently. For example, some studies report that after 10 years of sexual contact with an infected partner, a woman has a 61% likelihood of being infected, as opposed to only 0.4% for a man [8] . In a Japanese cohort study of 100 discordant couples practicing unprotected sexual intercourse, there were seven seroconversions during 5 years of observation. Uninfected females were 3.9 times more likely to become infected than uninfected males [9] . Similar differences in prevalence were noted among pregnant women. A study of young pregnant women (<30 years old) in French Guiana demonstrated that factors such as high gravidity, a high parity, and a negative Rhesus factor were independently linked to an increased risk of HTLV-1 seropositivity [10] . It has been postulated that the increase in HTLV-1 prevalence rates in the younger than 30 age group could be the result of high levels of sexual transmission in this population. In Jamaica or French West Indies, for example, women who were HTLV-1 seropositive were slightly more likely to have had more than three lifetime sex partners, earlier age at first sexual intercourse, and a history of sexually transmitted diseases [10] [11] [12] . In many studies an increased risk of seropositivity has been seen with increasing age but also with prior miscarriages, caesarian sections, and high gravidity. These factors are known to be associated with a low socioeconomic level, and they could reflect sexual activity and a high number of lifetime sexual partners [10] . Sexual transmission of HTLV-2 has been difficult to study.
