Homology modelling of the OC43 3CL pro The 3CL pro structure of HKU1 [PDB: 3D23] displayed a high sequence identity of 82.3% to the 3CL pro of OC43, with an e-value of 0.0. The high degree of identity can be partly expected as both OC43 and HKU1 are human coronaviruses from the Betacoronavirus genus. The exceptionally high degree of identity may even further suggest a recent common ancestor, which has yet to be identified. The active site residues are also highly conserved between both sequences indicating that 3D23 forms a highly suitable template for model generation ( Figure 1 ). Homology models were built with MODELLER (9v10) [22, 23] where the lowest discrete optimized protein energy (DOPE) score corresponded to model five with a GA341 score of 1, indicating that the model quality corresponded with low resolution crystallographic structures. The DOPE score profile of target and template ( Figure 2 ) were nearly perfectly overlaid, indicating that the model was close to its native state. A peak in DOPE score for HKU1 3CL pro (3D23) was observed at approximately residue 50, where OC43 3CL pro showed a moderate conservation in DOPE score. Colouring the HKU1 3CL pro (3D23) structure by B-factor indicates the presence of a highly variable loop region from Ser46 to Asp53 ( Figure 3 ). The presence of this highly variable loop structure could explain the increase in the DOPE score profile in this region and may suggest that the homology model has assumed a more stable conformation than the template. Structural alignments where the root mean square deviation (RMSD) is below 2 Å between target and template indicates that the positions of all backbone elements are correct [24, 25] . Superimposition of the 3D23 template and modelled OC43 3CL pro structure displayed an RMSD of 0.327 Å suggesting a highly accurate prediction of the position of all backbone elements ( Figure 4 ). Analysis of the overall model quality of target and template by ProSA Z-score indicated that both fall within an acceptable range for crystallographic structures with a Z-score for 3D23 of −7.04 and −7.34 for the homology model of OC43 3CL pro ( Figure 5 ). Stereochemical analysis of phi-psi dihedral angles indicated that 91.8% of residues were in the most favoured regions with none in the disallowed regions ( Figure 6 ). For the latter purposes of this model, in characterization of the inhibitory potential of 16R, it is essential to confirm Figure 1 Pairwise sequence alignment of OC43 3CL pro with the template structure of 3D23. Sequence alignment revealed a high identity of 82.3%. Asterisks indicate conserved residues between target and template. Conserved active site residues are highlighted in red. Important residues within the oxyanion loop (yellow), S 1 pocket (blue) and S2 pocket (black) are also highlighted to display high degree of conservation within the active site. Figure 2 DOPE score profiles of template, 3D23, and homology model of OC43 3CL pro . General overlay of profiles indicates the generated model is close to its native structure. The spike at residue 50 corresponds to a variable loop structure for which OC43 3CL pro has assumed a more stable conformation. that the receptor in its active conformation. To ensure the modelled 3CL pro of OC43 is in its active conformation, several features can be used to differentiate between the active and inactive states. These features include the maintenance of a loop conformation of the loop connecting domain II and III and the oxyanion loop. If these features assume an alpha helical conformation it directly or indirectly leads to the collapse of the oxyanion hole and thereby forms an inactive state [26] . An alpha helix conformation of residues 186-190 in the loop region between domain II and III causes a further collapse of the S 2 and S 4 subsites [19] . The orientation of the His163 sidechain in the S 1 pocket is also vital for substrate binding [27] . This residue is largely kept in place by a stacking interaction with the benzene ring of Phe140 and imidazole ring of His163 [26] . The orientation of His172 is also stabilized by a hydrogen bond with the sidechain of Glu166. This prevents steric interactions between His172 and His163 allowing it to maintain its orientation in the S 1 pocket. A hydrogen bond between His163 and Tyr161 has also been implicated in stabilizing the sidechain of His163 [27] , however we could not observe the formation of this bond Figure 3 Location of highly variable loop region in the 3CL pro of HKU1 (3D23). Colouring of backbone elements by B-factor indicates the presence of a highly variable loop from residues Ser46 to Asp53. This variable loop region may be responsible for the spike in DOPE score for 3D23, for which OC43 3CL pro has assumed a more stable conformation. in the crystal structure of SARS-CoV 3CL pro (3V3M), raising the question of its importance to maintain the orientation of His162/3. Utilising these previously mentioned parameters it is possible to ascertain if the generated homology model of OC43 3CL pro is in an active conformation. With the exception of the hydrogen bond between Tyr161 and His163, which may form in a dynamic system as the Tyr161 hydroxyl is in close proximity to the imidazole nitrogen of His163 but with incorrect geometry to form a hydrogen bond, all other interactions and conformations were maintained indicating that the homology model generated using the 3CL pro structure of HKU1 (3D23) as a template is representative of the active conformation of the enzyme (Figure 7) . With this and previously mentioned results, indicating the generation of an appropriate homology model of the OC43 3CL pro , suggests the generated structure is suitable for further structurebased drug design techniques. Assessing the binding conformation and free energy of binding of 16R Analysis of the crystallographic structure of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro , with the bound inhibitor 16R, illustrates a pyridine occupying the S 1 pocket and forming a hydrogen bond with the imidazole Nε2 of His163. A further two hydrogen bonds are formed between ligand carbonyls and Gly143 and Glu166 with three methyl groups inserting into the deep hydrophobic S 2 pocket [12] . The conformation of 16R is almost completely conserved when bound to the 3CL pro of OC43. Notable exceptions include the shifting of the hydrogen bond formed with Gly143 to a furan ring oxygen as opposed to the carbonyl oxygen seen in SARS-CoV 3CL pro . The hydrogen bond formed with Glu166 is also absent in OC43 3CL pro , however the distance between the ligand carbonyl and backbone hydrogen is 2.75 Å and therefore this may be capable of mediating hydrogen bond formation in a dynamic system (Figure 8 ). Free energy of binding between 16R and SARS-CoV and OC43 3CL pro , as assessed by MM-GBSA, is -85 kcal/mol for both receptors. These results suggest that the inhibitor 16R may be capable of inhibiting both complexes.
