SA-AuNPs were synthesized in a one-pot reaction using HAuCl 4 as the gold source and sialic acid as both the reducing and protecting agent. The color of the solution changed from yellow to dark red wine as the reaction proceeded to completion. The SA-AuNPs were fairly monodispersed with spherical shape, as demonstrated by TEM (Fig. 1A) . The average SA-AuNP size was determined to be 20.171.8 nm after analyzing 50 particles using Adobe Photoshop software. The concentration of the final SA-AuNPs solution was determined by the volume-density method, based on the assumption of face centered cubic (fcc) gold structure and 100% reaction yield. First, the number of gold atoms in a gold nanoparticle was calculated by the following equation where N is the number of atoms in a gold nanoparticle, r is the density of fcc gold (19.3 g/cm 3 ), r is the radius of nanoparticle (10.05 nm), N A is Avogadro's number and M is gold atom's atomic weight (196.97 g/mole). The calculation yielded $ 250,000 gold atoms in 20.1 nm gold nanoparticles. Since the initial concentration of HAuCl 4 is 0.5 mM, the final SA-AuNP concentration is 2 nM when resuspended in the same volume of DI water as initially. Sialic acid is the only compound among all starting reagents in the reaction pot that can reduce HAuCl 4 and stabilize the resulting AuNPs. Sialic acid contains five hydroxyl groups and one secondary amine group, all with mild capability to reduce HAuCl 4 and form AuNPs. This straightforward one-pot approach for synthesizing SA-AuNPs is much more efficient than previously reported methods using lab-synthesized thiolated sialic acid molecules that require multiple steps of organic synthesis and purification (Niikura et al., 2009; Papp et al., 2010) . The SA-AuNPs solution is very stable in solution sitting on bench top for at least 9 months after the synthesis. FT-IR was performed to determine the surface functional groups of the SA-AuNPs (Fig. 1B) . A strong, broad band at 3000-3500 cm À 1 corresponds to hydroxyl groups and another strong band at $ 1600 cm À 1 corresponds to the carbonyl group of carboxylic acid. Together, these data indicate the presence of sialic acid on the surface of gold nanoparticles. The scheme of using SA-AuNPs for virus detection is shown in Fig. 2 . It is known that the carboxylic group of SA is critical for the binding of hemagglutinin on the viral particles to SA on the surface of cells (Wang et al., 2007) . Most of the hydroxyl and amine groups of SA-AuNPs are located at the opposite end to the carboxylic group. It is reasonable to project that the carboxylic group will face outward after SA-AuNPs are formed. The SA layer on AuNP surface prevents the aggregation of the AuNPs in solution. In the presence of viral particles, single AuNPs can attach to hemagglutinin on viral particle surface, resulting in shorter distance between AuNPs. It is expected that interaction among AuNPs would lead to a change in the absorption spectra, thus signaling the presence of viral particles. Experimentally, absorption spectra were taken every minute after influenza B/Victoria solution of 1.25 vol% was mixed with 0.8 nM SA-AuNPs solution until each spectrum stabilized. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the SA-AuNPs solution changes immediately after the addition of virus, indicating aggregation of SA-AuNPs has place. After adding dilutions of influenza B/Victoria to the SA-AuNPs solution, the OD value at 600-610 nm increases while that at 510 nm decreases over time. The increased absorbance at 600-610 nm indicates that AuNP aggregates have formed, thus decreasing the population of single AuNPs as they are converted into AuNP aggregate on the viral particle surface. The increase in absorbance at 600-610 nm is approximately 7 times that of decrease in absorbance at 510 nm, which is likely attributed to the enhanced scattering effect of aggregated AuNPs as compared to individual AuNPs. Particle size analysis performed before and after the addition of 1.25 vol% influenza B/Victoria provided more evidences of AuNP aggregate formation. Before the addition of virus, the size distribution of the SA-AuNPs was represented as a peak at $ 21 nm when measured by the Zetatrac instrument, matching well with the results from the TEM measurement (Fig. 3C) . After incubating SA-AuNPs with virus, the SA-AuNPs displayed bimodal size distribution, with peaks at 28 nm and 141 nm, indicating that there are populations of both individual SA-AuNPs and virusbound SA-AuNPs present in the solution. The size of SA-AuNP aggregates on viral particle at 141 nm correlates with the 100 nm size of a influenza B virus particle (Bouvier and Palese, 2008) (Fig. 3D) . As the stock vials of viral particles were suspended in 10% FBS containing DMEM, the specificity of this detection scheme for virus rather than media components was investigated. A control experiment was thus performed using only 10% FBS containing DMEM, where the effects of inorganic salts and the biological components, such as proteins, amino acids, vitamins, on the SA-AuNPs can be monitored. A solution containing 0.2 nM SA-AuNPs and 5 vol% of the medium was prepared and absorption spectrum was measured after 20 min (Fig. 4A ). Since the absorption spectrum of the medium overlaps somewhat with the plasmonic peak area of SA-AuNPs, absorption spectrum of the medium was subtracted from that of the SA-AuNPs and medium mixture (Fig. 4A, dotted line) matched well with that of SA-AuNPs in water, indicating that the presence of medium does not cause SA-AuNP aggregation. Additionally, the potential for virus binding nonspecifically to nanoparticles and cause aggregation was tested. Gelatin-AuNPs, with similar spherical shape and size distribution (Fig. 4B inset, diameter of $ 20 nm by TEM analysis) but lacking sialic acid were assayed for aggregation in the presence of viral particles. No change was observed in either the plasmonic band or the 600-700 nm region. These results suggest that SA-AuNP aggregation is indeed caused by viral particles via the interaction between sialic acid on SA-AuNP surface and hemagglutinin on the viral particle surface. To further test the hypothesis that the sialic acid on the SA-AuNP is interacting with hemagglutinin, influenza B/Victoria stock solution was pre-incubated with an excess of 1.25 mM sialic acid to thus occupy all hemagglutinin binding sites. Size (nm) Fig. 3 . UV-vis spectra and particle size analysis of SA-AuNPs with virus. UV-vis absorption spectra measured at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12 min after the addition of 1.25 vol% influenza B/Victoria. Overall absorption spectra (A), change of OD 610 over time (B), particle size analysis results measured before (C) and after (D) addition of 1.25 vol% influenza B/Victoria. This pre-treated virus solution was then incubated with SA-AuNP solution and aggregation was assayed by changes in absorbance in the UV-vis spectrum. As shown in Fig. 5 , a smaller DOD ( $ 3.2 times) was observed with SA pre-treated virus solution as compared to the non-treated virus solution. This suggests that the sialic acid groups on the SA-AuNPs interact with hemagglutinin on virus surface in a similar manner as the free sialic acid in solution. Different dilutions of influenza B/Victoria were added to 0.4 nM SA-Au NP solution to determine limit of detection. Seven different concentrations of virus solution, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.3125, 0.156 and 0 vol%, were tested in the colorimetric test. The change in absorbance of SA-AuNPs over time is shown after adding 2.5 vol% virus solution in Fig. 6A and 0.156 vol% in Fig. 6B . A linear correlation is observed between DOD and the amount of added virus solution when the virus concentration was below 1.25 vol% (Fig. 6C) . While virus solution of 0.156 vol% was readily detected, the detection limit could be estimated to be 0.09 vol%. Note that, from the insets of Fig. 6A and B, it took longer to reach plateau in absorption when a higher titer of virus was added. The final solutions after each test are shown in the photograph (Fig. 6D) , illustrating the gradual change from red to purple color as the amount of virus solution increases. It has been reported that interparticle distance, when larger than 5 times the nanoparticle radius, does not cause electromagnetic coupling between the particles (Ghosh and Pal, 2007) . At higher concentrations of virus (e.g. 2.5 and 5 vol%), as ratio of virus to particles increases, the proportion of SA-AuNPs that can be bound to the same viral particle decreases. This results in longer interparticle distance between neighboring SA-AuNPs on the viral particle surface, and less signal. We carried out another set of colorimetric tests using a higher concentration of SA-AuNP solution (0.8 nM), while maintaining the same concentrations of virus solution. The results in Fig. 6E show that the linear range of DOD vs. concentration of added virus solution has extended to 2.5 vol% of virus in the solution. This illustrates the importance of having an excessive amount of SA-AuNPs in the starting solution when applying this scheme for virus detection. To validate these results with another virus preparation, influenza B/Yamagata subtype was also tested with 0.4 nM SA-AuNPs solution. The results are similar to those of influenza B/Victoria, and shown in Fig. 6F . A recent paper by Niikura et al. (2009) has reported the use of gold nanoparticles functionalized by sialic acid-linked lipids to detect virus-like particles. This study included the synthesis of the sialic acid-linked lipid in four complicated steps and subsequent step to finally obtain the sialic acid-functionalized gold nanoparticles for virus-like particle detection. In comparison, our one-pot synthesis of sialic acid-AuNPs is simpler, more economical and environmentally friendly. This report is the first to demonstrate that such colorimetric scheme indeed works for the detection of actual virus.
