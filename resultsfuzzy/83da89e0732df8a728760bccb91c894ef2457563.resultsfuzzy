In addition to general guidelines for reporting the results of economic evaluations, reports of communicable disease models should provide the estimated change in burden of infection due to an intervention, as this constitutes a major motivation for the use of dynamic rather than static models. Infections can be further disaggregated according to whether they are directly or indirectly prevented, their route of transmission (e.g., sexual, vertical, and by vector), and population subgroup, as appropriate. Other outcomes appropriate for reporting include changes in the long-run equilibrium level (incidence or prevalence) of infection, likelihood of disease elimination, and changes in R e .
