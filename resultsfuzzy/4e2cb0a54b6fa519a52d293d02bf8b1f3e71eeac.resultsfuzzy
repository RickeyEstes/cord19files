The Influenzanet network for influenza surveillance in Europe contains ten countries: The Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Italy, the UK, Sweden, France, Spain, Ireland, and Denmark. Identical questionnaires are implemented with questions about respiratory symptoms, access to and utilization of care and self-medication, uptake of vaccines, attitudes to influenza vaccines, and absenteeism. The questionnaires can be used to monitor ILI in the community in real time, to track vaccine effectiveness [3, 4, 7, 8] , and to estimate risk factors for ILI (not shown here). In the ten countries, epidemiological data are collected with the participation of a self-selected cohort followed over the influenza season. The success of the data collection strongly depends on the extent of participation of the volunteers involved in the projects. The determinants of participation and the representativeness of the self-selected cohorts of participants in the various countries have been explored elsewhere [9] . In order to assess how the web-based systems for ILI surveillance can be a useful addition to the GP-based system, we present the cross-year and cross-country incidence data, which can be readily compared and easily collected, once the platforms are in place. The national platforms collect data about the health status of the active cohort volunteers during the whole duration of the influenza season. Participants are considered to be active if they have completed, on average, at least one symptoms questionnaire every 3 weeks since the registration. To define ILI, the following ILI case definition is used, which resembles the WHO guidelines [10] : a sudden onset of fever, namely, a measured body temperature of ≥38°C, accompanied by headache or muscle pain, and accompanied by cough or a sore throat. The date of fever onset is used as the date of ILI onset. In Fig. 1 These incidence curves can be compared with the incidence rates as estimated from ILI consultations in the sentinel GP network (http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/activities/surveillance/ EISN); this comparison shows very good agreement in the peak time. With different definitions of ILI cases and active participants, the incidence has the same trend, with a slight difference in the peak amplitude, but not in the timing (not shown). A more detailed figure for each country can be downloaded at https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8418871/ influenzanet_supplementary.pdf. In a few cases, such as Portugal in 2005 and Spain in 2012, the incidence curves are not perfectly congruent with the sentinel GP network data, because, for both countries, it was the first season, and the number of volunteers contributing to the data collection was very low at the beginning of the season, and rapidly increased during the unfolding of the influenza epidemics, leading to a noisy signal. It is worth mentioning that the answers of Influenzanet participants, when they were asked whether, during an ILI episode, they consulted a GP, showed wide variability [3, 4, 7] (Paolotti et al., 3rd International ICST Conference on Electronic Healthcare for the 21st Century, 2010) (Fig. 2) in the various countries, showing that, more often than not, the web platform can be of great advantage in collecting data about ILI cases that would otherwise go undetected by GP surveillance. The results show clearly the reliability and complementary relevance of the participatory platform data.
