UV spectroscopy inspects the change of secondary and tertiary structures of protein under the addition of physical and chemical factors. The UV spectroscopy of the P domain peptide in the absence and presence of different concentrations of PB2 in 10 mM PBS (pH 7.4) are shown in Fig. 5A . The maximum absorption peak was observed at 280 nm, indicating that the hydrophobicity of the microenvironment of the P domain decreased. With increasing concentration of PB2, the maximum absorption intensity of the P domain increased significantly, suggesting that the interaction between them leads to the loosening and unfolding of the protein backbone. CD spectroscopy was performed in the far-UV region in order to obtain more information about the secondary structure changes of the P domain in the presence of PB2. Fig. 5B shows the CD spectra of the free P domain and bound P domain-PB2 complex. Both of these two spectra exhibited negative absorption bands at 208 nm and a weak positive peak at 230 nm and had no significant difference between them. The percentage of secondary structure was also calculated and is shown in Fig. 5C . The P domain contains about 12.1% α-helix, 16.9% β-sheet, 21.3% antiparallel, 21.9% parallel and 55.8% random coil, whereas the addition of PB2 did not change the secondary structure of the P domain peptide.
