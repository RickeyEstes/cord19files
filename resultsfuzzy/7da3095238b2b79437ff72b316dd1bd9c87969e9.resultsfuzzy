Median baseline FEV1 values before allogeneic HSCT were not different between patients who were later diagnosed with CBO (90.4%; range, 68% to 107%), CBOi (109%; range, 89% to 120%) or with LB without infection (99%; range, 56% to 114%). (Table 2, Figure 3 ) Furthermore, at the time of biopsy, there were no significant differences in the median FEV1 values between the 3 groups: CBO, 55.1% (range, 35.2% to 83.2%); CBOi, 41.6% (range, 34.1% to 53.2%); and LB, 60.8% (range, 44.1% to 85.9%). The median decline in FEV1 from baseline to the time when biopsy was performed was 43.8% for CBO, 65.4% for CBOi, and 23.6% for LB. These declines in PFT were statistically significant for all the 3 groups (CBO: P ¼ .001; CBOi: P ¼ .04; LB: P ¼ .002). All patients underwent BAL procedures. Results are shown in Table 2 . Differential cell counts were available for 28 patients (85%). Concomitant viral infection was identified in 6 patients (2 with PIV, 4 with RSV). Patients with LB, compared with patients with CBO, had significantly higher proportions of lymphocytes (P ¼ .009). There were no other significant differences in the differential cell counts between these 2 groups.
