Scheme 1 illustrates the proposed detection methodology, utilizing a smart phone attached to a UV-LED chamber and a cartridge consisting of PMMA cover and PT impregnated PVDF membrane. The cartridge has three spots: reference spot, control spot, (HBV DNA) and sample spot (HBV DNA + PNA). An optical transition occurs upon dropping the sample on the cartridge, and then it is subsequently quantified by mobile application. Unlike previous report that utilize an image processing software, for instance ImageJ software, to quantify optical transition of PT at nM concentration levels of nucleic acids based on selected regions of interest, the proposed mobile application scans the individual pixels of the sample droplet pattern. The pixelated analysis of droplet pattern yields high statistical precision to set up corroborating correlation between control and sample spots. Analysis of individual pixels is of utmost importance in colorimetric assaying as the color transitions are usually weak at low analyte concentrations. The process of color analysis by the smart phone application is illustrated in Fig. 1a . The application is designed to run on a three-step operation modes. In the first step, the algorithm locates the vertical centroid of the digital image via analysis of RGB components of individual pixels along the vertical direction. A horizontal red line along the vertical centroid is illustrated in Fig. 1a Fig. 1a , are recorded for the pixels corresponding to the PT deposited on PVDF membrane. Upon recoding RGB color codes of all the pixels along the vertical centroid, the algorithm records additional nine sets of horizontal axis pixel color codes, that correspond to four pixels above and five pixels below the vertical centroid in order to ascertain the colorimetric responses. The algorithm then constructs a 10 × 2000 matrix to determine red, green blue component of all the individual pixels along the scanning direction (Detailed description of image processing is provided in the supporting information; Fig. S1 (a)-(e)). Finally, the algorithm executes an averaging operation to yield a pixelated color code that is displayed at the user interface in form of a bar chart. In order to test the microstain recognition performance of the smart phone application, 4x4 pixel microstain has been created artificially on the image shown in Fig. 1b (25x magnification is shown in Fig. 1c) . RGB color codes were found to be as [221, 165, 79] on microstain region while it was [250, 187, 90] on the rest of the image. As shown in Fig. 1c , the red intensity profile centered at 250 drops significantly to 220 for the microstain region, assuring that the microstain with a slight color difference with respect to the background can be recognized by the smart phone application. The next validation experiments for the smart phone applications was conducted by creating an artificial droplet pattern as shown in Fig. 1d . The red, green and blue intensity profiles of the artificial droplet pattern exhibit two symmetrical minima corresponding to the outer and inner edges of the rim of the droplet pattern. These results show that the smart phone application is capable of recognition of both microstains and droplet patterns and might be subsequently utilized for colorimetric analysis of PT droplets on PVDF membranes. The red component exhibits the steepest change as compared to blue and green since the optical transition of PT is in the range of 500-600 nm. The algorithm is therefore set to utilize the red components for analysis and quantification of nucleic acids. In next step, we conducted experiments by using HBV DNA to validate smart phone application for pixelated nucleic acid assay. Fig. 2a shows a typical image analysis of reference, control, and sample spots (from left to right) in which HBV DNA concentration is 1 μΜ. The red intensity of control spot (PT + HBV DNA), is substantially lower than reference (PT) and sample (PT + HBV DNA + PNA) spots, indicating significant quenching of PT by HBV DNA at a concentration of 1 μΜ. The red intensity variation of control spot from 240 (PT) to 160 (PT + HBV DNA), as evaluated by the algorithm, concurs with the dark red color of the droplet profile observed from the corresponding digital images. However, at lower HBV DNA concentrations shown in Fig. 2b , naked eye interpretation of colorimetric response of the control spots may not be readily feasible. Therefore, in order to maximize the colorimetric responses, the stoichiometric ratio of PT with respect to HBV DNA concentration to be evaluated (PT concentration on PVDF) and the homogeneity of PT on PVDF membrane is optimized by adopting a multi-coating approach. Fig. 2b shows the images of 5, 6, 7 and 8 times PT centrifuged PVDF membranes with varying concentration of HBV DNA between 0 and 50 nM. The red intensity profile of 5 and 6 times PT centrifuged PVDF membranes changes from 189 to 182 and 188 to 186, respectively, upon consecutive addition of HBV DNA, whereas 7 and 8 times PT centrifuged PVDF membrane yield significantly larger changes in red intensity with increasing HBV DNA concentrations, from 189 to 154 and 188 to 155, respectively. Fig. 2c illustrates that there is no significant difference in red intensity changes upon addition of HBV DNA between 7 and 8 times PT centrifuged PVDF membrane. Fig. 2d Scheme 1. Schematic illustration of cartridge and smart phone-assisted nucleic acid assay. Step 1 illustrates the assembly of plastic cartridge consisting of three layers; Step 2 shows the transfer of HBV DNA sample to the cartridge and Step 3 shows the mounting cartridge on the UV-LED chamber that serves as an accessory for mounting the smart phone. Step 4 illustrates the smart-phone assisted BioRGB analysis yielding bar graphs that represents the pixelated (and averaged) RED intensities of the three sample spots. indicates that the total color response or hue of 5 and 6 times PT deposited PVDF membrane is lower than 7 and 8 times PT centrifuged PVDF membrane, further ascertaining that there is no substantial difference in colorimetric response upon HBV DNA addition between 7 and 8 times PT centrifuged PVDF membrane. Therefore, 7 times PT centrifuged PVDF membranes are utilized for the proposed pixelated nucleic acid assay. Fig. 3a shows the BioRGB output of the 7 times PT centrifuged PVDF membranes in the form of bar graphs that correspond to averaged red intensities of the individual pixels of the digital images of the membranes. As for sample and control membrane, the algorithm is set to yield a color code of 10 × 1000 pixels (starting from the edge of the droplet pattern, Fig. S1 (e) , as a droplet of sample typically spreads to over 1000 pixel diameter area). The algorithm eventually displays the averaged values of 500 pixels along the horizontal axis as 20 bar graphs for visual interpretation of colorimetric responses, as illustrated in Fig. 3a. Δ RED values (Fig. 3b shows the illustration of algebraic derivation of color matrix for obtaining Δ RED values by subtracting RGB color codes of control from that of sample) increases with HBV DNA concentration providing a linear correlation between HBV DNA concentration and Δ RED values. Fig. 3c illustrates the residual plots that show a Δ RED scattering of less than 1% over the concentration range of interest. The residual plot ascertains that BioRGB application is reproducible, with responses varying within 1% for the 1 nM to 1 μM concentration range of HBV DNA. The calibration curve illustrated in Fig. 3d , obtained from the average Δ RED values of corresponding concentrations shown in Fig. 3a , indicates good linearity within the concentration ranges of interest. The final validation of proposed methodology was conducted using the HBV DNA spiked into plasma. Fig. 4a illustrates that the digital image does not reveal a definite droplet shaped pattern for membrane upon addition of HBV DNA, and that visual identification of HBV DNA is not feasible for lower concentrations (around 1 nM). However, BioRGB analysis yields distinguishable Δ RED signals for 1, 10, 100 and 1000 nM as 10, 25, 50 and 60, respectively (Fig. 4b , difference between control and sample). It is to be noted that the algorithm analyzes the response from all the individual pixels rather than by the averaging regions of interest, an approach adopted by typical image analysis software. As concentration increases from 1 nM to 1 μM, the color saturation and darkening occurs, and therefore the control spot (HBV DNA) and sample spot (HBV DNA + PNA) are distinguishable by BioRGB. As shown in the residual plot in Fig. 4c , the scattering of Δ RED values are 2.5%, which is larger than for the responses obtained in DI. The major reason of the increase in scattering may due to increase in refractive index (turbidity) in plasma samples. However, the scattering observed in plasma samples does not deteriorate the data-driven decision of BioRGB. Fig. 4b illustrates that the proposed BioRGB smartphone application possesses a scattering of less than 2.5% (reproducibility of over 97.5%) within the HBV DNA concentration range of 1 nM to 1 μM. In the next step control experiments have been performed. The first control experiment perfomed with DNA1 (DNA1: 5' -TTT ATA GAA GTA GTG GTA CC-3′ non complementary sequence to PNA) shows that the responses of DNA1-PNA are much lower than HBV DNA-PNA (see S2 ). This result demonstrates that PNA is specific to HBV DNA sequence. The interference experiment has performed in the co-existence of target HBV DNA sequence and DNA1. The result shown in S3 reveals that the non-complementary DNA1 does not associating complementary PNA as compared to target HBV DNA and the effect of noncomplementary DNA1 on red intensity value is marginal. The response of the proposed assay to longer DNA sequence (DNA 31 = 31 base pairs) has been also tested since the real samples may contain longer sequence. The result shown in Fig. S4 demonstrated that red intensity for HBV DNA (shorter sequence) and DNA 31-PNA 31 (longer sequence) are nearly identical and this assures the proposed assay is applicable for the longer DNA sequences as well. The colorimetric responses shown in Fig. 4a are then analyzed by ImageJ software in order to validate the BioRGB analysis. RGB analysis yielded red intensity variations of 15, 25, 45 and 65 for 1, 10, 100 and 1000 nM of DNA, respectively, which are comparable to those obtained using BioRGB. However, these values tend to vary depending on the regions of interest that are subjective to human judgement. Furthermore, scattering intensities in RGB based colorimetric analysis are prone to be higher owing to manual section of pixels (as observed from Fig. S5 , for concentration of 10 nM and higher), which compromises the overall sensitivity and robustness of the assay. In contrary, the proposed methodology eliminates the error involved in defining the regions of interest for image analysis approach and also yields a sensitive approach for analyzing colorimetric responses.
