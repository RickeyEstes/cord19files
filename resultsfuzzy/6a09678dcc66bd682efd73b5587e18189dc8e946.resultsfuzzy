There were no statistically significant differences among the 3 groups in recovery rates and total cell numbers in the BAL fluid. The protein concentration of the BAL fluid obtained 6 hours after reperfusion was 0.16 Ϯ 0.05 mg/dL for animals undergoing transplantation without CPB, 0.40 Ϯ 0.16 mg/dL for animals undergoing transplantation with CPB, and 0.12 Ϯ 0.04 mg/dL for animals undergoing transplantation with CPB and ultrafiltration. The protein level of the animals undergoing transplantation with CPB and ultrafiltration was lower than that of the animals undergoing transplantation with CPB (P ϭ .02), whereas the serum protein levels of the 3 groups were essentially the same (2.53 Ϯ 0.26 mg/dL for group 1, 2.45 Ϯ 0.54 mg/dL for group 2, and 2.40 Ϯ 0.54 mg/dL for group 3). Interleukin 6 (IL-6) mRNA expression in the lung is discussed in Appendix E1 and Figure E1 .
