In this section, we study short-lived outbreaks and we delegate the discussion of long-lived outbreaks to Text S1. A key threshold characteristic of an infectious disease outbreak is the basic reproduction number R 0 , which measures the number of new infections caused by each infected individual at the beginning of the outbreak. Assuming initially that the fraction S 0 of the population is susceptible, we verify that the basic reproduction number in all models is R 0~b S 0 nzd : Our mathematical analysis shows that the infection dynamics are qualitatively similar for all three of the media influence functions. More precisely, if R 0 w1, then the number of infections initially starts to increase. The number reaches a maximum and then decreases to 0. The classical SIR model exhibits the same behavior. Though the behaviors of the models are qualitatively similar, quantitatively they are different. In the following, S final denotes the final (limiting) fraction of the susceptible population. Media Influence Function 1. f (S,I)~kIS We derive the following formulas for the key epidemiological quantities. Lemma 1 N The maximum daily prevalence (fraction) is N The attack rate (the total fraction of individuals who become infected) is Consequences for the outbreak. We compute the dependence of these quantities on the media influence intensity, k. The derivatives of I max and I total are negative which implies that as the media influence intensity increases these will decrease. Simulations for an outbreak in a small city. Figure 1 (a) shows the fractions of individuals in each population compartment during the disease outbreak. Figure 1 (b) illustrates the effect of increasing the media influence intensity, that is increasing k. The resulting I(t) curves are compared with I(t) for the classical SIR model. As can be seen, as the media influence intensity increases, the fraction who become infected decreases due to more and more individuals choosing to employ social distancing measures , and the maximum daily prevalence, I max , and the time of I max both decrease, which agrees with our mathematical predictions. Media Influence Function 2. f (S,I)~k IS 2{I We derive the following formula for the maximum daily disease prevalence. Lemma 2 N The maximum daily disease prevalence is Due to the more complex form of the media influence function it is not possible to derive a formula for I total . Consequences for the outbreak. We compute the dependence of the maximum fraction of infected individuals on the media influence intensity, k. The derivative of I max is negative which implies that as the media influence intensity increases the maximum fraction will decrease. The dependence of I total on the media influence intensity can be determined numerically for the parameters corresponding to the 1918 H1N1 pandemic influenza in the United States (Table 1) . For the values in Table 1 , we verify numerically that I total is a decreasing function of k. Without a formula, any other set of model parameters would need to be checked individually. Simulations for an outbreak in a small city. Figure 2 (a) shows the fractions of individuals in each population compartment during the disease outbreak. Figure 2 (b) illustrates the effect of increasing the media influence intensity, that is increasing k. The resulting I(t) curves are compared with I(t) for the classical SIR model. As can be seen, as the media influence intensity increases, the fraction who become infected decreases due to more and more individuals choosing to employ social distancing measures, and the maximum daily prevalence, I max , and the time of I max both decrease, which agrees with our mathematical predictions.
