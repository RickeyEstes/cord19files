Our search query resulted in 7193 records from Web of Science and PubMed (figure 1). We identified and removed 1434 duplicates, resulting in 5759 unique records that were screened based on title, abstract, keywords and full-text if necessary. Exclusions were mostly related to (i) topic, including the study of non-infectious diseases or infections in animals, plants and crops; (ii) discipline, including microbiological and clinical trial studies, and to a lesser extent to (iii) language and article type. Eventually, 178 articles were included for full-text analysis. The number of articles matching our eligibility criteria increased from 18 in 2010 to 38 rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J. R. Soc. Interface 13: 20160820 Models applied to influenza or ILI stand out, together with 'general' models. In the latter category, a hypothetical infectious disease is modelled, without specification of which disease (but often including optimistic statements about the generalizability of the application).
