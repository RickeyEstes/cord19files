Similar to the validation process, after solving the cases the new air system in terms of moisture content distribution, moisture condensation risk on cabin linings, capability in removing internally generated pollutants, and thermal comfort was analyzed. Fig. 5 , poles P1, P2, P4 and P5 are across the passenger thighs and seats in directly front of the passenger torsos with 5 cm, while P3 is in the aisle. Since P1 and P2 are at the window side, the both poles are shorter. When calculating the inhaled moisture content, we have assumed a passenger does not inhale the moisture released by himself or herself. That means the inhaled water vapor content profiles for a passenger were plotted when temporarily turning off the moisture generation of that passenger. Generally, as shown in Fig. 5 the mixing system holds uniform relative humidity of around 10%, which falls within the range of the measured values on airplanes [9] . Such low level of humidity may lead to discomfort complain. However in the new system, after humidification the humidity level is much elevated reaching 20% on average. In the aisle along P3, relative humidity is slightly higher because the dry bulb temperature of air is lower in the aisle and thus a little smaller for the saturation pressure. Note, the study only considers moisture generation from human respiration and neglects moisture generated from human skins during sweating or water evaporation from drinks.
