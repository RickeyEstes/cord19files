Insertion and lateral lipid response by reciprocal space mapping The homodimeric representative of the applied peptide motif H-(Tyr-Tyr) 4 -Lys-OH has already been shown to enable intermolecular interaction via its phenolic sidechain pattern within the aqueous phase (Alexopoulos et al. 2004 ). The homodimer species 2 adopts a membrane spanning orientation in DLPC bilayers (KÃ¼sel et al. 2007) and likewise tends to aggregation (Schneggenburger et al. 2009 ). Therefore, the GID approach was undertaken to evaluate if the latter observation of a membrane insertion and transmembrane alignment is likewise true for the designed hairpin species (2) and the recognition system (3) (Fig. 2) . Furthermore, it was our aim to screen the samples for any evidence of lateral peptide interaction, i.e., the formation of higher-order structures (low q k , q z ), as sometimes indicated by superstructure peaks (Constantin et al. 2007 ) as well as for regular intrahelical distances that can be revealed from the occurence of so-called helix peaks (Spaar et al. 2004 ).
