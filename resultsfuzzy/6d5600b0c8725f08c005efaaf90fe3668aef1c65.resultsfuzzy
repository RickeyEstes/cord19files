RA is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disorder affecting millions of patients in the US. Treatment of this progressive, degenerative disease demands constant use of anti-inflammatory drugs and often immunosuppressive treatments that increase susceptibility to infections and neoplasia (4, 15, 16) . Instead, intervention strategies that focus on redirecting or reeducating T cell responses to produce tolerance instead of inflammation have the potential of being a superior treatment for RA. To address the void for such tolerance induction, we queried whether a probiotic LAB engineered to express the potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-35 (Figure 1A) , would diminish arthritis. Expression of IL-35 by LL-IL35 was detected by Western blot analysis using a rabbit polyclonal serum against an MBP-IL-35 fusion protein [produced in-house; (61) ]. To test the therapeutic properties of LL-IL35, mice were challenged on day 0 with CII to induce CIA. Given its similarity, CIA is often exploited as an investigative tool to test novel strategies and therapeutics to prevent and treat RA. These mice were randomly divided into three groups for oral treatment: LL-IL35 (pBzMM150), LL vector (pMSP3535H3), or sterile PBS. Two treatment paradigms were tested: beginning intervention on day 14 resembling Salmonella-CFA/I treatment (60) with two additional doses on days 21 and 28 ( Figure 1B) or beginning intervention at disease onset on day 18, followed by a second dose on day 25 ( Figure 1C) . Clinical scores were performed in double blind, and followed until day 39 post-induction. We generally do not see changes in disease severity beyond 39 days post-CII challenge. Using the three-dose regimen, 50% of the LL-IL35-treated mice showed no symptoms and the remaining 50% developed minor symptoms as opposed to PBS-or LL vector-treated mice, who all developed severe arthritis by day 24 post-CII challenge. Notably, the severity of disease symptoms was significantly less (p < 0.001) in the LL-IL35-treated mice exhibiting an average clinical score of 1 in contrast to PBS-or LL vector-treated mice eventually achieving clinical scores of ∼9 ( Figure 1B) . To test if LL-IL35 is effective in arresting the disease after disease onset, additional groups of CIA mice were treated using a two-dose regimen on days 18 and 25. Under this treatment, 40% of the LL-IL35-treated mice developed CIA vs. 100% of those treated with PBS or LL vector (Figure 1C) . Compared to the threedose regimen, the disease severity was greater for the LL-IL35treated CIA mice subjected to the two-dose regimen, although significantly less (p < 0.05) when compared to similarly treated PBS-or LL vector-dosed mice. These data show that LL-IL35 can effectively reduce the symptoms of arthritis and the incidence of disease via its immunosuppressive capacity. Moreover, these results show that fewer doses of IL-35 delivered by LL are needed to curtail arthritis when compared to treatment with soluble protein (47, 48, 51, 52) . Analysis of knee joints was performed to determine the extent of neutrophil infiltration. In agreement with these clinical findings, the LL-IL35-treated mice had markedly reduced Ly-6G + CD11b + cells (neutrophils) infiltrating the joints (Figure 2A ) representing a 7-and 5-fold reduction compared to The synthetic insert encodes in order: the usp45 secretion peptide genetically fused in-frame to the p35 subunit, a short flexible linker, fused to the EBI3. The synthetic DNA also features an optimal Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence at the optimal distance from the ATG initiation codon, in addition to the SD sequence present in the vector. The nisin-inducible promoter and a transcription terminator are borne on the expression vector pMSP3535H3. (B,C) CIA was induced in groups of C57BL/6 males with chick CII emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. Two regimens were tested: orally treated with 5 × 10 8 CFUs of LL vector or LL-IL35 or sterile PBS on (B) 14, 21, and 28 days or (C) 18 and 25 days post-induction. Average clinical score per treatment group (left panels) represents severity of the disease, and incidence of arthritis depicts percent mice with affected joints in each treatment group (right panels). The sum of 10 mice/group is shown: (B) * p < 0.001 vs. PBS-dosed or LL vector-treated mice, and (C) ** p < 0.02, *** p < 0.05 vs. PBS-dosed mice and ++ p < 0.02 vs. LL vector-treated mice . PBS-dosed or LL vector-treated groups, respectively ( Figure 2B) . Hence, IL-35 can reduce inflammation of the joints in CIAchallenged mice. To investigate the possible mechanism of protection conferred by LL-IL35, CD4 + T cells purified from draining LNs were anti-CD3 + anti-CD28-restimulated and analyzed for cytokine production. These CD4 + T cells were obtained from mice dosed three times with PBS, LL vector, or LL-IL35 as described in Figure 1B . IFN-γ levels remained elevated between PBSdosed and LL vector-treated mice, in contrast to LL-IL35-treated mice showing 3-to 3.7-fold reduction (p < 0.001; Figure 3A) . Concomitantly, IL-17 levels were significantly less (p < 0.001) by 3.7-and 8.5-fold for LL vector and LL-IL35-treated groups, respectively, relative to PBS-dosed mice ( Figure 3B) . Moreover, treatment with LL-IL35 significantly reduced IL-17 by 2.3fold compared to LL vector-treated mice (p < 0.01). Minimal stimulation of IL-10 was detected in the restimulated CD4 + T cells from the PBS-dosed mice (Figure 3C) . In contrast, CD4 + T cells from LL vector-and LL-IL35-treated groups showed significantly increased IL-10 production (p < 0.05) by 1.8-and 2.5-fold, respectively. The difference between the LL vector-and LL-IL35-treated groups was significant (p < 0.05; Figure 3C ) as well. The stimulation of IL-10 by LL vectors has been reported by others (56, 57) . However, IL-10 induced by the LL vector-treated group was insufficient to suppress disease progression (Figure 1) and IL-17 production (Figure 3B) . IL-10's importance for suppressing CIA was previously demonstrated in IL-10 −/− mice with CIA being refractive to IL-35 treatment (48) , supporting the notion here of IL-10's relevance to CIA mice treated with LL-IL35. IL-35 has also been shown to stimulate IL-10 production (40, (47) (48) (49) . We have found that CD39 + CD4 + T cells are the primary Tregs responsible for resolving CIA (48, 60, 61) . CD39 is an ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1which hydrolyzes ATP into AMP, thus quenching inflammatory signaling by extracellular ATP (58, 63) . We also showed that CD25 + Tregs remained a subset of CD39 + CD4 + T cells, and that CD39 encompassed all of the Treg subsets (60) . In fact, CD39 + Tregs were protective against CIA (40, 60) . These Tregs are composed of two subsets, Foxp3 + and Foxp3 − , and are FIGURE 2 | Oral LL-IL35 confers protection against CIA via reduction of neutrophil influx into joints. Reduced clinical scores and disease incidence described in Figure 1B interchangeable (60) . Analysis of induction of CD39 + Tregs by the LL vector revealed no increase in the percentage of these Tregs in CIA mice (40) , and CIA had only a modest impact upon their induction (40, 61) . To examine the types of Tregs induced by LL-IL35 treatment, whole splenic and draining LN lymphocytes were cultured overnight with CII, and then pulsed with PMA + ionomycin to ascertain the type of Tregs induced in PBS-dosed and LL-IL35-treated mice. Lymphocytes were then stained for CD39, Foxp3, and CCR6 to identify the Treg subsets. Since CCR6 has been shown to be expressed by Tregs (53-55), we queried whether such Tregs may be induced as a consequence of IL-35 treatment. CD39 + CD4 + T cells were evaluated for expression of Foxp3 and CCR6 (Figures 4A,B) . Upon examination of splenic Tregs derived from PBS-dosed mice compared to those present in LL-IL35-treated mice, a modest increase (p < 0.05) in the frequency, but not the total number of CCR6 + Foxp3 + CD39 + CD4 + T cells, was observed (Figures 4C,G) . A modest difference (p ≤ 0.01) was also observed in the frequency and total number of splenic CCR6 + Foxp3 − CD39 + CD4 + T cells when compared to the PBS-dosed mice (Figures 4E,I) . However, when similar analysis was performed for Tregs obtained from the draining LNs, a 2.2-fold increase in the frequency (p < 0.001) of CCR6 + Foxp3 + CD39 + CD4 + T cells was stimulated by LL-IL35 treatment compared to those present in PBS-dosed CIA mice (Figure 4D) . The total number of these LN Tregs was also significantly (p ≤ 0.01) increased by 2.7-fold ( Figure 4H) . Subsequent analysis was performed on LN CCR6 + Foxp3 − CD39 + CD4 + T cells, and both the frequency and total number increased significantly by 2.9-(p ≤ 0.01) and 5.1-fold (p < 0.001), respectively (Figures 4F,J) . These studies demonstrate that indeed CCR6 + Tregs are induced by IL-35 treatment of CIA mice. Additional analyses were performed on both CCR6 − Foxp3 + and CCR6 − Foxp3 − CD39 + CD4 + T cells (Figures 4K-R) . Examination of the splenic CCR6 − Foxp3 + CD39 + CD4 + T FIGURE 3 | LL-IL35 reduces proinflammatory cytokines, IFN-γ and IL-17, with a concomitant increase in anti-inflammatory IL-10 production. CD4 + T cells were purified from PBS-or LL-IL35-dosed mice that received three treatments as described in Figure 1B . The LN CD4 + T cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and soluble anti-CD28 for 48-72 h, and collected supernatants were analyzed for (A) IFN-γ, (B) IL-17, and (C) IL-10 production. Depicted are the means ± SD of triplicate cultures as assessed by cytokine-specific ELISA; *p < 0.001, ***p < 0.05 vs. PBS-dosed mice; # p < 0.001, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.05 vs. LL vector-treated mice. cells revealed that both the frequency and total number were modestly and significantly (p < 0.05) reduced for the LL-IL35treated mice (Figures 4K,O) . The frequency of splenic CCR6 − Foxp3 − CD39 + CD4 + T cells was slightly and significantly (p ≤ 0.01) reduced ( Figure 4M ), but the total number of these CD39 + CD4 + T cells showed no difference between PBS-dosed and LL-IL35-treated CIA mice (Figure 4Q) . Similar analysis was also performed for the LN CCR6 − Foxp3 + and CCR6 − Foxp3 − CD39 + CD4 + T cells from the same treated CIA mice. While a slight reduction in the frequency of LN CCR6 − Foxp3 + CD39 + CD4 + T cells was observed for LL-IL35-treated mice (Figure 4L) , the total number of CCR6 − Tregs was significantly (p ≤ 0.01) elevated by 5-fold ( Figure 4P) . Examination of the frequency of LN CCR6 − Foxp3 − CD39 + CD4 + T cells also showed a modest, but significant (p < 0.001) reduction in LL-IL35-treated mice relative to PBS-dosed mice (Figure 4N ), but the total number of these LN T cells was significantly (p < 0.001) enhanced by 36% ( Figure 4R) . Hence, these analyses demonstrate that IL-35 treatment stimulates diverse subsets of Tregs including both CCR6 + and CCR6 − Tregs. Future studies will need to consider the longevity of these subsets for protection against CIA. Inquiring into the activity of these LN CD39 + Tregs, analysis for IL-10 production was performed (Figure 5) . Intracellular IL-10 measurements were conducted first for all CD39 + CD4 + T cells (both Foxp3 + and Foxp3 − ). The LL-IL35-treated mice showed 3.2-and 1.7-fold more IL-10-producing cells (p ≤ 0.01) than PBS-dosed and LL vector-treated CIA mice, respectively ( Figure 5A) . LL vector-treated mice showed 1.9fold increase in the number of IL-10-producing CD39 + CD4 + T cells compared to PBS-dosed mice (p ≤ 0.01; Figure 5A ). Examination of IL-10 + CCR6 + CD39 + CD4 + T cells (both Foxp3 + and Foxp3 − ) revealed that two-thirds of the total IL-10-producing cells induced by LL-IL35 treatment of CIA mice were derived from the CCR6 + subset (Figure 5B) . The CCR6 + CD39 + CD4 + T cells induced with LL-IL35 resulted in significant 3.2-and 1.8-fold increase in IL-10-producing cells than those present in PBS-dosed (p ≤ 0.01) and LL vectortreated CIA mice (p < 0.01), respectively. LL vector-treated mice showed 1.8-fold increase in the number of IL-10-producing CCR6 + CD39 + CD4 + T cells compared to PBS-dosed mice (p ≤ 0.01; Figure 5B ). These findings suggest that indeed both Foxp3 + and Foxp3 − CCR6 + CD39 + Tregs are the predominant source of IL-10, thus contributing to the amelioration of CIA subsequent LL-IL35 treatment. Such finding may mimic what is evident with human peripheral blood CCR6 + CD39 + Tregs (64) and CCR6 + Tregs found in patients with glomerulonephritis (65) . The data presented demonstrate the potency of IL-35 as an anti-inflammatory therapeutic. Moreover, this investigation further supports the multifaceted benefits of adapting recombinant L. lactis as a vector to deliver therapeutic doses of IL-35. In fact, previous studies by us (48) or others, using IL-35 to treat type 1 diabetes model (51) , IBD (52), or psoriasis (52) , required daily treatments with recombinant protein to control disease. In contrast, only two or three oral doses of LL-IL35 were sufficient to prevent the onset or stop CIA progression. Oral dosing has the substantial advantage of being less invasive circumventing the need for injections. LL-derived IL-35 eliminates the labor-intensive efforts needed to produce and purify the recombinant protein, dramatically reducing the cost of manufacturing this therapeutic. Moreover, IL-35 is a dimeric protein which adds to the difficulty and cost to generate. The L. lactis used for this study is a lab-adapted recombinant strain, originally derived from an industrial dairy strain capable of fermenting milk into a product that has the same textural and olfactory properties of yogurt (40) . We previously have demonstrated that the curative properties of our recombinant L. lactis are maintained when grown on a synthetic medium or used to ferment milk into a yogurt-like product (40) . These attributes make L. lactis an ideal tolerogen delivery platform for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
