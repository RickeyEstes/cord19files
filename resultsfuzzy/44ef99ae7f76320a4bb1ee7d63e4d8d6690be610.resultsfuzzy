For the models given in Eqs. (1)- (6) and (9), We have computed the equilibrium points, generalized reproduction numbers, sensitivity indices, dynamical behavior and the critical immunization levels by using the parameter values estimated by Gumel et al. [6] for the SARS epidemics in Beijing, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore. In this section, we will show the results for Beijing. We will then briefly discuss any differences between the Beijing results and the results for the other three regions in Section 8. The meanings of the parameters in the SEQIJR model are defined in Table 1 and the parameter values that we use are shown in Table 4 . To examine the effect of immunization, we will use values of ν = 0.01 corresponding to a disease-free equilibrium, ν = 0.000002 corresponding to an endemic equilibrium, and a critical value of ν corresponding to a value for the disease-free reproduction number of R d f ≈ 1. Substituting the parameters for Beijing in Table 4 into the system of differential equations for disease transmission in Eqs. (1)- (6) and (9), we obtain Eqs. (40). d J dt = 0.5I + 0.125Q − 0.047234J, Table 5 Initial population values used for numerical integration.  Using the parameter values given in Table 4 , we have computed and compared the disease-free and endemic results for the four regions. The overall behavior of the results for all four regions is similar, but with some differences in detail. We will compare the results for the reproduction numbers, the sensitivity indices and the critical immunity levels. Table 9 Ranking for best parameters to reduce R d f . Region
