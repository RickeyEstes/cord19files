Re-docking of a diverse dataset of pMHC complexes. We performed a re-docking experiment with a diverse dataset of pMHC complexes (Supplementary Table S1 ). Our dataset includes 10 of the most prevalent human MHC allotypes, bound to peptides with different lengths (8 to 10 amino acids) and a varying number of DoFs (29 to 41). The goodness-of-fit between predicted binding modes and the corresponding reference structures (i.e., the minimized crystal structures) is estimated in terms of RMSD. A "near native" reproduction of an experimentally-observed binding mode usually corresponds to an all-atom RMSD lower than 2.0-2.5 Å 17,47 . The results of our re-docking experiment show good reproductions of the 25 pMHC complexes (Fig. 4) , with an average all-atom RMSD of only 1.92 Å (±0.41 Å). The all-atom RMSD is less than 2.2 Å in 68% of the cases, and less than 2.5 Å in 98%; the highest all-atom RMSD is 2.61 Å. Note that most previous work in the field was reported using backbone (or Cα) RMSD only 13, 14, 16, 36, 50 . This means capturing the overall "shape" of reproduced peptides, but not necessarily the precise position of their side-chains. On the other hand, related work reporting all-atom RMSD was usually performed in less diverse datasets (e.g., only selected MHC allotypes or peptide lengths) 17, 34, 37, 40 . We report both Cα RMSD and all-atom RMSD for our re-docking experiment, which was conducted on a structurally diverse dataset of pMHC complexes (Supplementary Table S1 ). As seen from Fig. 4 , we do not observe any correlation between the all-atom RMSD and the number of DoFs (R = 0.39). For instance, the result for complex 4NT6 (9-mer, 31 DoFs) is worse than for complex 3VXS (10-mer, 38 DoFs). When considering all the variables listed in Supplementary Table S1, the strongest correlation (R = 0.5) is observed between peptide length and Cα LRMSD. By computing the Cα LRMSD we capture the accuracy of the backbone prediction. This is very meaningful information because a small error in the backbone has a bigger impact on the binding mode than a similar error in a side chain. DINC makes no initial assumption on the backbone conformation, and has no constraint related to templates or expert-knowledge on the expected conformation (Fig. 2) . In spite of that, our average Cα LRMSD is only 0.99 Å (±0.36 Å). As further discussed in the next section, a good reproduction of the backbone is obtained even when considering peptides with different lengths, or "non-standard" binding modes. Besides, similar levels of accuracy are obtained for very different MHC allotypes, highlighting the potential of DINC as a general method for pMHC structural prediction. Accurate prediction of diverse binding modes. The allotype HLA-A*02:01 is one of the most extensively studied HLA variants 17, 41 . It is the second most prevalent allotype in humans 67, 68 and arguably the HLA variant for which the most detailed and comprehensive data is available: more than 42,000 binding assays deposited in the Immune Epitope Database 69 . As reported in previous studies, HLA-A*02:01 binds mostly 9-mers, but also larger peptides. It was also reported that the HLA-A*02:01 binding cleft is fairly constrained, with little conformational variation across available crystal structures. It also presents a clear pattern of preferred anchor residues 41 at both peptide termini: usually positions 2 (p2) and 9 (p9) of the 9-mer ligands (Fig. 5) . Comparing available crystal structures, a shared conformational pattern was observed for the backbone of 9-mer peptides bound to HLA-A*02:01 35 . For example, this typical backbone pattern is observed in the crystal structure 3MRG, involving a virus-derived peptide (Fig. 5A) . Some cancer-related peptides, however, are known to present unusual binding modes 17 . For instance, in the modified melanoma-associated antigen MART1-A27L the amino-terminal anchor to the HLA-A*02:01 binding cleft is p1 instead of p2. This alternative anchoring pattern creates a sideways deviation of the backbone in the middle of the peptide 17 , resulting in an unusual binding mode (Fig. 5B, 2GTW ). In addition, larger peptides are known to present bulging conformations of the backbone, to accommodate a longer chain using the same anchoring pockets (Fig. 5A, 1I4F) . DINC was able to reproduce each one of these 3 alternative backbone conformations, with sub-angstrom accuracy (Fig. 6) . The most prevalent HLA allotype is HLA-A*24:02 67, 68 , which is known to bind 8-mers, 9-mers and 10-mers. As expected, the conformation of 8-mers is more linear, with almost no bulged region between the two peptide termini (Fig. 5C, 4F7T) . Currently, there are only two crystal structures of 9-mers bound to HLA-A*24:02, and they present different binding modes (Fig. 5C) . According to the researchers who described these structures, the virus-derived peptide resolved in 3I6L shows an unusual binding mode, with a much more exposed p4 as compared to a regular self-derived peptide (2BCK). Further analysis of other crystal structures shows that the backbone conformation seen in 3I6L is very similar to that of 10-mer peptides bound to the same HLA (data not shown). In our re-docking experiment, DINC was able to reproduce all these binding modes (Fig. 6) , as well as other 10-mers bound to HLA-A*24:02 (Supplementary Table S1 ). In the case of 3I6L, the authors claim that the observed binding mode is stabilized by an internal hydrogen bond established by p3, whose side chain is pointing towards the center of the binding cleft. The binding mode predicted by DINC for this complex does not feature this specific hydrogen bond (as determined by UCSF Chimera), but a similar orientation of p3 is observed (Fig. 6F) . The peptide's binding mode is greatly influenced by the shape and properties of the HLA cleft; a given peptide might bind differently to different HLA allotypes (e.g., using different anchor residues or having different side chains exposed for TCR interaction) 35, 70 . These structural differences are key for recognition by T-cells, and contribute to the diversity of cellular responses observed among individuals with different subsets of HLAs 1 . Although our dataset includes peptides bound to four different HLA-A allotypes, five HLA-B allotypes and one HLA-C allotype (Supplementary  Table S1 ), we can reproduce the conformational differences imposed by these different binding clefts (Fig. 6) . The results in this paper show that it is possible to develop a general pMHC geometry prediction method. In addition to the good reproduction of peptides' backbone, the average all-atoms LRMSD of 1.73 Å (±0.33 Å) demonstrates high accuracy reproduction of peptides' side chains (Supplementary Table S1 ). Therefore, not only the buried side chains (i.e., those facing the MHC cleft) were correctly predicted, but the overall geometry of the ligand was closely reproduced (including side-chains of the bulging portion of the peptide, which are more exposed for TCR interaction). Obtaining a good approximation of the pMHC complex geometry is essential for the use of predicted models as input for other structure-based analyses. Significance for T-cell-based immunotherapy. Thanks to the rapid technical developments of the last decade and our growing understanding of the mechanisms involved in cellular immunity, T-cell-based immunotherapy has emerged as one of the most promising approaches for cancer treatment 7,71,72 . Significant anti-tumor activity has been reported in a number of clinical trials, involving different cancer types 73 . Two melanoma-associated antigens, MAGEA3 and MART1, stand out among the leading tumor-derived peptides targeted by these immunotherapies (Supplementary Table S1 ). Figure 6 . Reproduction of very different binding modes. In blue, side view of nine different peptides bound to five different human MHC allotypes, as observed in the corresponding reference structures (identified by their respective PDB codes). In pink, side view of the best binding modes obtained by DINC when performing a redocking experiment with each complex. The MHC structure is not depicted, but the HLA allotype is indicated for each complex. Note that alternative peptide residues can be involved as primary anchors (p1/p2, p8/p9/p10) or secondary anchors (p3, p5, p6, p7), depending on the peptide length or MHC allotype. LRMSD (Cα), Least Root Mean Square Deviation for the alpha carbons of the peptide; RMSD (all), Root Mean Square Deviation for all atoms of the peptide. Additional information can be found in Supplementary Table S1 The peptide-antigens derived from MAGEA3 and MART1 can be expressed by multiple tumor types, but are not expressed by most normal tissues, therefore allowing for the development of antigen-specific T-cell-based therapeutics [74] [75] [76] . Unfortunately, unexpected off-target toxicities against healthy tissues have been reported [74] [75] [76] , raising serious safety concerns. For instance, lethal cardiac toxicity was observed in two patients undergoing treatment with T-cells specific to the MAGEA3 antigen 74, 75 . Later investigation showed that the therapeutic T-cells used in these patients were also recognizing an unrelated Titin-derived peptide, displayed by HLA-A*01:01 molecules in healthy cardiac cells 74, 75 . Although we usually refer to the peptides as being the targets recognized by the cytotoxic T-cells, TCRs actually recognize the combined surface of the peptide and MHC receptor, also referred to as the "TCR-interacting surface" of the pMHC complex (Fig. 1) . Each TCR is thought to be specific for a given pMHC complex, but structural similarity between unrelated complexes can be responsible for off-target activation of T-cells 8, 77 ; also known as T-cell cross-reactivity 6 . Using x-ray crystallography, Raman and colleagues 10 have confirmed the structural similarity between the pMHC complexes involved in the MAGEA3-Titin cross-reactivity (Fig. 7A,B) . Both of these pMHC complexes were included in our dataset (5BRZ and 5BS0). DINC was able to correctly predict the geometry of both peptides, bound to HLA-A*01:01, and reproduce the structural similarity of the resulting TCR-interacting surfaces (Fig. 7D,E) . The clinically relevant example described above highlights the significance of pMHC structural prediction in the context of T-cell-based immunotherapy. In this case, the two peptides have a sequence identity of 55%, which is already challenging for sequence-based cross-reactivity prediction. However, T-cell cross-reactivity can be triggered even by peptides with no sequence identity and low biochemical similarity 78 , and might be driven by specific structural similarities in hot-spots over the TCR-interacting surface 79 . In this context, structure-based methods for cross-reactivity prediction have been proposed, either clustering pMHCs of interest based on structural similarity 78, 80 , or integrating structural information and protein expression levels into sequence-based proteomic searches 81, 82 . This field will spawn significant developments in the coming years, particularly considering the importance of cross-reactivity prediction for T-cell-based immunotherapy 11 . Moreover, considering the costs and practical limitations of experimental methods for protein structural analysis, fast and reliable computational methods for geometry prediction of pMHC complexes should play an important role in this process.
