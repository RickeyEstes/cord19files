The clinical challenge of inter-mission variability of blood product availability was addressed by the use of two regimes within one retrieval team algorithm. The "Primary" regime is based upon the resources carried by the retrieval team and represents a minimum standard of major haemorrhage management for all patients. The "Inter-Facility Transfer" (IFT) regime provides guidance on delivering hospital-standard DCR, where possible, using locally available resources. The logistic challenges encountered by retrieval teams are extensive. The retrieval clinical coordinator is instrumental in reducing delays, maximising use of resources and maintaining handover of information. Their role was clearly defined and a checklist developed in order to avoid omissions. The protocol was adopted by Retrieval Services Queensland for state-wide use by fixed and rotary wing retrieval teams. Conclusions: This novel protocol addresses many of the specific clinical and logistic challenges faced by retrieval teams. The protocol contains specific guidance yet provides flexibility to encompass the variety of major haemorrhage scenarios encountered, which may range from roadside polytrauma to the inter-facility transfer of an intensive care unit patient. The goal is seamless transition of care with ongoing damage control resuscitation from point of referral, during transfer, and upon arrival at the receiving centre. Conclusions: An inverse relationship is observed as previously between pre-operative EndoCAb levels and outcome. A similar relationship can be seen also between the anti-staphylococcal antibody levels and outcome with a more pronounced infective component. The absence of a relationship between the varicella antibody levels may imply from this study that low pre-operative immunity relating to post-operative morbidity is specific to the peri-operative threat. Introductions: In view the adverse consequence of post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) encompassing hemodynamic deterioration, thromboembolic hazards beside the intolerable fast rate, and mortality; preventing POAF seems to be an ideal goal. The POAF events incidence reported to be 30 and 40 % in coronary artery bypass and valvular surgeries respectively. [1, 2] . We aim to assess the impact of a simple clinical practice guideline for POAF events prevention and highlighting the incidence in Asian population. Methods: Single center retrospective study conducted over one year, we enrolled all patients subjected to cardiac surgery (267), and patients with existing or prior AF were excluded. Patients were divided into two groups (group I) before and (group II) after implementing the CPG. Results: Both groups were matched regarding the age, gender, smoking history, preoperative ejection fraction, EuroSCORE, urgency of surgery and underlying surgery type valvular or coronary. There was a statically significant difference in POAF events was14.9 % in group I and vs 8.3 % in group II (P = 0.05). The overall total rate of Critical Care 2016, Volume 20 Suppl 2 POAF in all patients was 11.4 % that is below the rate in European centers. [1] Patients with POAF significantly required more inotropic support (p = 0.04), in addition they were associated with prolonged length of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay (p = 0.001 and 0.02 respectively). Conclusions: The argument of rhythm control in POAF would favor preventive measures that reduce post-operative transition from sinus rhythm with expected favorable effects of lessening the blood stasis and left atrial thrombosis chances. Introductions: Aim of this study was to investigate any beneficial effect on postoperative mortality and morbidity when a single dose of dexamethasone is administered during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in cardiac surgery patients. Methods: A total of 782 patients who underwent elective cardiac surgery procedures under the use of CPB in our department during 28 months period were retrospectively studied. In 499 patients a single dose of 8 mg dexamethasone was given during CPB( group A) while it was not administered in 283 patients (group B). The following factors were compared between 2 groups: Low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), prolonged mechanical ventilation (>48 hours), septicaemia, postoperative stroke, acute kidney injury (AKI) defined by RIFLE criteria, AKI requiring dialysis treatment, atrial fibrillation(AF), sternal wound infections and mortality. Statistical analysis was based on chisquare test Results: Group A consist of 499 pts, mean age 65.38 ± 9.8, mean EURO score II,1.86 ± 1.9. Group b consist of 283 pts, mean age 65.33 ± 11.7, mean EURO score II 1.7 ± 1.4. Results are shown on Table 18 . Conclusions: Dexamethasone administration during CPB, has no protective impact on postoperative LCOS, septicemia, stroke, AKI, atrial fibrillation, sternal infections and mortality. There is a tendency for correlation with prolonged mechanical ventilation protection and the severe form of AKI requiring dialysis but not statistical significant. Introductions: The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is used in a variety of clinical settings in which myocardial function is reduced. In cardiac surgery, its role on clinical outcomes is debated due to conflicting results of retrospective analysis and limitations of a recent prospective study. The IABCS study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of prophylactic IABP in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods: The IABCS study is a prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial in high-risk patients scheduled to elective cardiac surgery at the Heart Institute/University of São Paulo. Inclusion criteria were additive EuroSCORE > = 6 or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < = 40 %. Eligible patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to IABP group or control group. Removal of IABP catheter was accomplished after 24 hours of the procedure under the following circumstances: cardiac index > = 2.2 L/min/m2 and dobutamine infusion dose < = 5 μg/kg/min. The catheter was immediately removed if a severe adverse event related to the procedure was detected. The primary outcome was the composite endpoint of mortality and major morbidity in 30 days after cardiac surgery, according to the modified Society of Thoracic Surgeons definition, which included: prolonged mechanical ventilation (>24 hours), stroke, mediastinitis, need for reoperation, cardiogenic shock, and acute renal failure. Results: A total of 116 patients were enrolled from April 2014 to September 2015. Fifty-two patients were assigned to IABP group and 64 patients to control group. The mean age was 64 ± 8 years in the IABP group and 67 ± 9 years in the control group (P = 0.06). The median LVEF was 40 % (31-45) in the IABP group and 40 % (35-55) in the control group (P = 0.873) and the median EuroSCORE was 6 (4-7) vs. 6 (4-7), P = 0.873, respectively. The primary outcome was observed in 40.4 % in the IABP group and 37.5 % in the control group (P = 0.751 Introductions: Acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiovascular surgery is associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a potent endogenous natriuretic, diuretic, and vasorelaxant peptide. However, its effectiveness on AKI is uncertain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of ANP on renal function and medical costs in patients with AKI undergoing cardiovascular surgery. Methods: We conducted a multicenter prospective randomized placebo-controlled study in patients with AKI who underwent Definition of AKI used in this study was an increase in serum creatinine level > =0.3 mg/dl from preoperative level within 48 h after surgery. The patients were randomly assigned to receive a continuous infusion of low-dose ANP (0.02microg/kg/min) or placebo. The infusion of ANP or placebo continued until the serum creatinine level decreased to preoperative level. The primary endpoints were 1) changes in renal function during 90 days measured by serum levels of creatinine and cystatin C, and creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular filtration rate, and 2) need for renal replacement therapy during 90 days. The secondary endpoints were 1) length of ICU, 2) length of hospital stay, and 3) medical costs during 90 days. Results: Of the 77 enrolled patients, 37 were assigned to the ANP group (median age 72 yrs, male:female 24:13) and 40 to the placebo group (median age 74 yrs, male:female 31:9). ANP infusion did not significantly increase creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular infiltration rate compared to placebo. There was no significant difference in serum levels of creatinine and cystatin C, renal replacement therapy rate (1 of 37 patients in the ANP group vs 3 of 40 patients in the placebo group), length of ICU and hospital stay, or medical costs for 90 days. Conclusions: Low-dose ANP infusion did not show renoprotective effect nor cost-saving effect in the treatment of cardiac surgeryassociated AKI. Clinical trial registration number (UMIN 000006812).
