3.1. Sequence analysis of the promoter region of the chMDA5 gene A âˆ¼2.5 kb genomic fragment upstream of the chMDA5 gene was cloned. The fragment sequence was aligned against the 5 -upstream region of chMDA5 gene using the NCBI BLAST Assembled Genomes (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast), indicating 99% sequence homology with 5 -promoter region. The full length sequence of the MDA5 promoter has been submitted to the GeneBank database (accession number KT335979). Sequence analysis using the TFSEARCH ver.8.3 indicated that the MDA5 promoter region contains several putative transcription factor-binding sites, including binding sites for Sp1, GATA-1, TGGCA-binding protein, AP-1, AP-3, ER-alpha, T3R-alpha, C/EBP alpha, NF-1 (-like proteins) and NF-E4. In order to exploit the evolutionary relationship of promoters between chicken and other species, a phylogenetic analysis was performed. The chMDA5 promoter demonstrated closer evolutionary distance to bird MDA promoters, than to that of mammals. The closest evolutionary distance was to MDA5 promoter of turkey, in which RIG-I are also absent (Fig. 1A) . This result was similar to the phylogenetic analysis of the MDA5 gene in previous studies (Huang et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2012; Su et al., 2010) and is likely a reflection of the taxonomic relationship between these vertebrates. These results will be helpful for study of the innate immune system regarding to MDA5 and application of this promoter in expression of antiviral genes, as promoters with high homology would possibly bonded to similar transcription factors.
