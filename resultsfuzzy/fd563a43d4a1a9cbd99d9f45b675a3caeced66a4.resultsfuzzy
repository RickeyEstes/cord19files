Twenty patients out of 58 (34%) underwent PFT analysis for the detection and determination of disease severity. Eighteen out of 20 did second PFT analysis and were included in the study. Four out of eighteen (22%) had normal PFT, 1 (6%) obstructive, 2 (11%) restrictive, 11 (61%) combined obstructive and restrictive pattern ( Table 3 ). The severity of the PFT showed that 4/18 (22%) had normal PFT, 4 (22%) mild, 4 (22%) moderate, 2 (11%) severe and 4 (22%) moderately severe (Table 3 ). Follow up of PFT post viral infection showed no significant difference in the type and the severity of PFT. Out of the 58 patients, 45 (78%) patients are alive and 13 (22%) died. Three out of 13 patients who died (23%) had mucoid P. aeruginosa, 1 (8%) with Staphylococcus aureus, 1 (8%) with Streptococcus, 3 (23%) with E. coli, and 5 (38%) patients with other organisms.
