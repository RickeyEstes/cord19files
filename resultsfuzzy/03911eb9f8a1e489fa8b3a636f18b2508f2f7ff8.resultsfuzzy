No genetic variation was observed among the C. anatis DNA sequences, GenBank accession number AY704214. A 466 bp portion of the 16S rRNA DNA sequence was aligned with other protozoan sequences obtained from GenBank and examined for mismatches that reflected either substitutions or deletions. The mismatches were exploited to design primers that were unique to C. anatis. The amount of genetic divergence between C. anatis and the protozoan flagellates for the 466 bp region of the 16S rRNA gene obtained from GenBank (Ditrichomonas honigbergi U15505, Kalotermes gut symbiont AF215856, Koruga bonita AJ132467, Monotrichomonas sp. AF072905, Pentatrichomonas hominis AF124609, Tetratricho-monas gallinarum AF124608, Trichomitopsis termopsidis AF479642, and Tritrichomonas foetus AF466749) ranged from 8.2% to 11.2%. Two primers, one from each strand COCH-16S-F (5 0 -AAGGTTT-GTCATTTCAAAAT-3 0 ) and COCH-16S-R (5 0 -TCT TCCTCCTGCTTAAATAA-3 0 ) were designed. Based on the sequence, the expected sizes of the amplicon is 374 bp. Proper sized PCR products were obtained using conspecific DNA, whereas no product was obtained with template from the other species, i.e., no false positives were observed using known DNA. The C. anatis species-specific primers were tested for optimal annealing performance in a 41-59 8C temperature gradient with 2 8C intervals. The optimal annealing temperature for the FST specific primers was 43 8C. PCR conditions for the C. anatis specific primers consisted of an initial denaturation step of 94 8C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 8C for 45 s, 43 8C for 1 min and 72 8C for 1 min with a final extension step of 72 8C for 5 min. The C. anatis specific marker amplified successfully from C. anatis infected turkey gut and detected the flagellate protozoan from turkey feces (Fig. 1) . Using molecular diagnostics we identified C. anatis from the intestines of six poults and from six fecal samples collected from poults having laboratory infections. In addition, using molecular diagnostics, 8/18 (44%) adult house flies collected from the commercial turkey farm were found to contain C. anatis. This represented the first documented evidence that filth flies carry C. anatis in the poultry production environment and indicated that they may play a role in the dispersal and transmission of this protozoan parasite. Our polymerase chain reactionbased assay provided identification of pathogens by selective amplication of species or strain-specific regions of the organisms genome. The application of our method for the detection of C. anatis could help in determining the occurrence of the parasite in poultry facilities as well as for detection of the parasite in filth flies breeding in and around turkey production facilities that could serve as competent reservoirs.
