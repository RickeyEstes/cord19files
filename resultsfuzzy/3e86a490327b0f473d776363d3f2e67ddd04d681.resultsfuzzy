Given that the ATM/CHK2 pathway is activated upon DNA damage in order to modulate cell cycle progression, we assessed whether JEV infection results in cell cycle arrest. We analyzed the cell cycle by measuring DNA content with PI staining for mock-and JEV-infected cells at 24 h post-infection. JEV infection increased the proportion of cells in the G1 phase from 55.46% to 78.87% in U87 cells ( Figure 8A ). Similar G1 phase arrest was also noted in A549 cells ( Figure 8B ) and BE(2)C cells ( Figure 8C) . Therefore, JEV infection induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase.
