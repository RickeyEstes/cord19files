The finalized system dynamics models of a single hospital ( Figs. 5 and 7 ) illustrate feedback loops dependent on operational decision variables (patient-room design, ER occupancy control, patientvisitor management), which also drive the system behavior represented by the total number of infected patients (secondary infection). While the abovementioned general transmission dynamics model illustrates a causal loop diagram of first secondary infection model, this section constructs and analyzes models that incorporate operational decision variables and closely observe secondary infection outcomes. The right-hand side of the model represents increasing population infected with MERS, while the left-hand side of the model represents a decreasingly susceptible population. The nature of the loop does not account for the cure rate, but solely focuses on the sensitivity of the change in the exogenous variable. We performed two main scenario-based simulations and evaluated (1) the effect of ER overcrowding on secondary infection outcomes; and (2) the effect of patient room design on total patientcare performance.
