For the first time, we cloned inflammatory cytokines from African buffalo (Fig. 1) . The 801 bp African buffalo IL1␤ cDNA contained an open reading frame (ORF) with 266 amino acids (AAs). The deduced AA sequence includes six cysteine residues, one possible N-linked glycosylation site and carboxyl terminal endpoints for active proteins. The cDNA of African buffalo IL6 was cloned and found to be 627 bp, with an ORF encoding 208 AAs. A 208 AA sequence of African buffalo IL6, bearing a N-linked glycosylation site with four cysteine residues, was deduced from a 627 bp ORF. The 705 bp African buffalo TNF␣ cDNA contained an ORF of 234 AAs. The deduced AA sequence includes four cysteine residues, which are also conserved in the other species. Six African buffaloes were captured and T. parva infection was individually diagnosed by PCR and blood smear examination. The clinical signs of T. parva-infection, such as fever, anaemia and swelling of lymph nodes, were not observed in any the animals. Three animals were PCR positive and had microscopically detectable piroplasms on blood smears, indicating high parasitaemia (Table 2) . Quantitative real-time PCR showed that each of the T. parva positive animals had high parasite DNA load ranging from 10 −0.636 to 10 0.915 pg/0.5 mL whole blood, which corresponds to a lethal dose (>10 −1 pg) from the results obtained from the experimentally infected cattle with severe signs (Yamada et al., 2009 ). To verify if differences in the levels of cytokine expressions could correlate with the high parasitaemia, we used real-time PCR to measure the mRNA expressions of IL1␤, IL6 and TNF␣, in whole blood cells isolated from T. parva-infected African buffaloes, since these cytokines are elevated in T. parva-experimentally infected cattle (Yamada et al., 2009) . The mRNA expression of IL10 was significantly higher than those of uninfected animals, while iNOS induction was only detectable in T. parva-infected animals ( Table 2 ). On the other hand, TNF␣ expression level was lower than that of uninfected animals. IL6 was undetectable in both animals. Furthermore, to evaluate other anti-protozoan molecules, we investigated relative differences in expression of IFN␥, IL2, IL4 IL12p40, transforming growth factor (TGF) ␤1 and TGF-␤2 in African buffaloes infected with T. parva. The mean IFN␥, IL2, IL4, TGF-␤1 and TGF-␤2mRNA expression levels in infected animals were higher than those of uninfected animals, although there were large individual differences. In a previous report, we reported that in a diseasesusceptible cattle model, aberrant expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1␤, IL6 and TNF␣ was closely correlated with the increase in T. parva DNA load and severe clinical signs, such as pyrexia, dyspnoea and cachexia (Yamada et al., 2009) . Although African buffaloes become infected with T. parva, the infected animals exhibit fewer clinical signs and recover from parasite, which is fatal in cattle. Thus, the African buffalo is regarded as an important reservoir host of T. parva (Latif et al., 2002; Munang'andu et al., 2009) . Unexpectedly, T. parva-infected African buffaloes had high levels of parasitaemia despite Table 2 Theileria parva status of African buffaloes used in the study.
