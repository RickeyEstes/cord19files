A total of 80 lung transplant recipients were analyzed (63 double-lung and 17 single-lung transplant recipients) (Table 1). A total of 595 plasma samples were tested (mean number of samples per patient ϭ 7.4, range 4 to 12). Mean age was 49.6 years (range 19 to 68), which included 27 women and 53 men. Pre-transplant underlying lung disease included cystic fibrosis (n ϭ 18), emphysema/ chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; n ϭ 28), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n ϭ 21), ␣ 1 -anti-trypsin deficiency (n ϭ 5) or "other" (n ϭ 8). Maintenance immunosuppression was cyclosporine/prednisone/azathioprine (n ϭ 43), cyclosporine/prednisone/mycophenolate (n ϭ 29) or other (n ϭ 8). A total of 23 of 80 (28.8%) patients received induction anti-lymphocyte globulin. CMV prophylaxis consisted of intravenous ganciclovir for 2 weeks (all patients), followed by 12 weeks of oral ganciclovir (n ϭ 30), intravenous ganciclovir (n ϭ 10) or oral valganciclovir (n ϭ 40).
