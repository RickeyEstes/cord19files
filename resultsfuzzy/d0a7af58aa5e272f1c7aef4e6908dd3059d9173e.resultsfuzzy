The 26S proteasome mediates degradation of polyubiquitinated protein substrates labeled with polyubiquitin chains (Zhu et al., 2005) . Thus, we sought to investigate whether inhibition of proteasome leads to increased polyubiquitination of AAVP phage coat proteins. We performed these experiments in the M21 cell line as these cells were previously used for microscopic analysis of intracellular RGD4C/AAVP . M21 tumor cells were transduced with either targeted RGD/AAVP vector or non-targeted control in the presence or absence of MG132. Subsequently, the cells were analyzed for co-localization of AAVP particle proteins and ubiquitin by immunofluorescence as reported (Neumann et al., 2007) , by using antibodies against ubiquitin and phage coat proteins (Figure 4) . Confocal microscopic analyses showed strong co-localization of ubiquitin and AAVP coat proteins in cells treated with MG132 ( Figure 4) . These data prove accumulation of polyubiquitination of the AAVP coat proteins in the presence of MG132.
