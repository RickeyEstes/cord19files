The minicell vaccine was then tested for its ability to elicit immune responses after mucosal delivery. Mice were immunized three times each with minicells containing both recombinant GFP protein and plasmid DNA encoding the eukaryotic GFP expression cassette (pGFPVAX) by i.m., i.n., or p.o. routes. These minicells were the only type tested in these experiments because of their ability to induce higher immune responses after i.m. administration (see above, Fig. 2 ). Results illustrated in Fig. 3a indicate that mice immunized with minicells by any of the tested routes all generated GFP-specific IgG antibody titers in serum. Intramuscular delivery showed ∼4-fold increase in GFP-specific antibody titers over sera harvested from mice immunized by either the intranasal or oral routes. As expected, naïve mice showed no response. These data indicate that bacterial minicells could stimulate the formation of systemic immune responses after mucosal delivery. Because mucosal immunizations conferring protection against pathogens typically induce the presence of antigenspecific IgA in the mucosal lining, the GFP-specific IgA content of mice immunized by the various routes was compared. Fig. 3b shows that detectable amounts of IgA were found in the lungs of mice immunized by the i.n. route, but not in the lung lavages of mice immunized p.o. or i.m. Fig. 3c illustrates the detection of GFP-specific IgA in the intestinal lavage fluid of mice immunized by the p.o. route, but not in those immunized by the other routes of administration. Although the amount produced is low, these data indicate that minicells do have the potential to induce IgA production at the expected sites of mucosal immunization.
