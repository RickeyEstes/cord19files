Quantitation of the three marker compounds Method validation of quantitative analysis. Reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) is typically used for the analysis of ASF. However, quinolizidine alkaloids (e.g., MT, SPR and OMT) are very polar especially when they are protonated. This leads to insufficient retention and peak tailing on the RPLC columns. The present study employed an amino column to separate the chemical components in ASF in the hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) mode. As shown in Fig 2, the three marker compounds were well retained and separated with very good shape. In addition, other minor components were also eluted mostly early in the chromatogram. The assignment of MT, SPR and OMT was carried out by comparing the retention times and on-line UV spectra with those of standards. The HPLC method was validated for linearity, system repeatability, accuracy, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) in support of its application to quantitative analysis of the three marker compounds. The linearity of the HPLC method was assessed at six concentration levels of the three marker compounds as described in Table 2 . The calibration a y and x were, respectively, the peak areas and masses (μg) of the analytes. b LOD: limit of detection (S/N = 3) c LOQ: limit of quantitation (S/N = 10) curves were established by plotting the peak area versus the injected mass (μg) of the standard marker compounds. Acceptable linearity was demonstrated for the three marker compounds in the concentration range suitable for sample analysis as shown in Table 2 . System repeatability was evaluated by the peak area of the three marker compounds following consecutive injections of the mixed standard solution. The relative standard deviation (RSD) was found not to exceed 0.62, 1.15 and 1.10% (n = 6) for MT, OMT and SPR, respectively. The accuracy of the HPLC method was determined by recovery using the standard addition method. The mean recovery of the three marker compounds was between 98.4% and 100.1%, suggesting acceptable accuracy of the method. The LOD and LOQ were determined by appropriately diluting the mixed standard solutions and the results are summarized in Table 2 . Sample analysis. The content of MT, OMT and SPR in ASF samples and one reference sample (RS) was determined using the validated HPLC method, and the results are reported in milligrams per gram of ASF in Table 3 . Some variation in the content of each alkaloid was observed in the samples that were tested. For example, the highest contents of MT, SPR, OMT and the total amount (SUM) of them were in S14, meanwhile, the lowest contents of MT, SPR, OMT and the sum of them were in S19. In order to evaluate the discriminating ability of the marker compounds, principle component analysis (PCA) was performed using the individual contents of the marker compounds and the total amount (SUM) as the input data to construct a two-dimensional matrix with 29 observations and 4 variables (29x4). As shown in the loading plot (Fig 3A) , all four variables are positively correlated to PC1 with the sum of three marker compounds having the highest loading on PC1. In contrast, only MT is positively correlated to PC2 significantly and OMT and SPR have negative loadings on PC2. The two-component PCA model accounts for 95.40% and 3.94% of the variation in PC1 and PC2, respectively. The score scatter plot (Fig 3B) shows that all the samples are grouped into two clusters marked by Group1 and Group 2, respectively. The samples in Group 1 (S1, S2, S15, S17, S19, S23, S24, S25, S26 and S27) all have negative values on PC1, indicating that the content of the marker compounds were all relatively lower (in the ranges of 180.07-221.87 mg/g for MT, 173.33-234.39 mg/g for SPR, 63.34-88.55 mg/g for OMT and 416.74-537.52 mg/g for SUM, respectively). The samples in Group 2 (S3-S14, S16, S18, S20, S21 and S22) with positive values on PC1 have relatively higher content of the marker compounds (in the ranges of 217.96-261.54 mg/g for MT, 243.02-271.07 mg/g for SPR, 89.59-104.91 mg/g for OMT and 564.75-637.51 mg/g for SUM, respectively). Among 27 samples, only three samples (S17, S18 and S19) were found to be outliers (outside the ellipse) based on the content of the marker compounds. It is also interesting to note that the reference sample (RS) with a negative value on PC1 and the reference fingerprint (RFP) are situated very close to the origin, indicating the "synthesized" reference fingerprint (RFP) is very similar to an independently acquired reference sample.
