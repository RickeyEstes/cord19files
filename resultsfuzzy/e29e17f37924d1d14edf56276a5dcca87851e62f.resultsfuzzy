Peptide precursors to compounds 3−7 were synthesized in the solid phase using methods analogous to our previously reported results. 20−22 Synthesis of 1,4-triazole analogs also provided us with the first opportunity to synthesize and test nonsymmetrical N-methylation patterns (e.g., compounds 4, 5, and 6), as previous attempts to accomplish this using on-bead olefin cross-metathesis had met with modest yields, at best. The Cu(I)-catalyzed Huisgen cycloaddition was conducted on resin using methodology described by Meldal and co-workers. 38 In each case, this method provided the desired compound following cleavage from the resin and concomitant deprotection as a single major peak by analytical HPLC. In previous work, we have monitored binding-dependent quenching of benzo[g]quinoline fluorescence to determine dissociation constants. 21, 22 Unfortunately, initial attempts to measure the affinity of triazole-containing compounds for the HIV-1 FSS RNA by fluorescence titration were unsuccessful due to irreversible photobleaching of the compounds. Therefore, we measured binding constants by surface plasmon resonance (SPR; Table 1 ). In this assay, RNA is immobilized on the SPR chip while the compound is flowed through in solution. This allows for determination of kinetic rate constants of binding as well as thermodynamic parameters. 39 A comparison of the measured affinities for 1 and 3 indicates that substitution of triazole for olefin has no effect on affinity (within error). N-methylation of 3 had only a modest effect on affinity; compound 7 displayed the highest affinity with a binding constant 6-fold tighter than 3. As with previously described N-methyl amide analogs such as 2, affinity enhancements are largely driven by an increase in on-rate (k a ). This is consistent with the hypothesis that N-methylation reduces the complexity of the ground state conformational ensemble and favors a conformer or conformers able to bind the RNA, and with the known propensity of N-methylation to alter peptide conformation. 40 In order to test selectivity, SPR measurements were made using a competitive assay, in which a mixture of the compound plus a 5-fold excess of yeast tRNA (relative to compound concentration) in solution was flowed over the SPR chip. Of course, this constitutes an even larger excess of tRNA over the amount of HIV-1 FSS RNA immobilized on the sensor chip, and as such represents a stringent assay. We observed that, of the compounds tested, only 7 showed a significant change in K D in the presence of tRNA. Cellular permeability and toxicity were assessed in HEK293T cells. Toxicity was first examined via WST-1 assay. 41 All triazole-containing compounds were significantly less toxic than previously reported compounds ( Figure 3 ; previous data for 2 are shown for reference). Compound 5 in particular was essentially nontoxic up to the highest examined concentration of 110 μM. Although previous experiments have produced clustering of toxicity among closely related analogs binding the HIV-1 FSS, triazole-containing compounds were found to have  a Values previously reported in ref 21. b Values previously reported in ref 22 . Error is derived as the standard deviation from the mean of the averaged individual fits. a spread of toxicities. Differences between compounds 5 and 6 were particularly unexpected as these compounds are chemically similar; while compound 5 has a toxic dose, TD 50 , of ≥110 μM, compound 6 was found to be roughly twice as toxic (TD 50 = 60 μM). Flow cytometry revealed that the permeability of triazole analogs largely followed their methylation pattern, with tetra-N-methyl compound 7 displaying the greatest cell permeability, and the non-N-methylated compound 3 the least (Supporting Information). These results are consistent with trends previously observed for compounds 1 (unmethylated olefin) and 2 (tetramethylated olefin), which are provided in the figure for reference. We further evaluated compound selectivity by examining the effect of 0, 6.83, and 20 μM concentrations of compound 7 on HEK293T cells by RNaseq. A total of 17 872 transcripts were analyzed for each condition. The set of significantly altered genes relative to control (0 μM compound) for the two concentrations was compared using the Web tool Interacti-Venn. 42 One of the 6.83 μM-treated samples behaved as an outlier, and therefore the analysis was conducted both with and without considering this sample. Disregarding the outlier sample revealed 53 transcripts with a statistically significant change in both the 6.8 and 20 μM compound-treated conditions ( Figure 4 ). Of these, only two showed a greater than 2-fold change (considered biologically significant 4 ) in both sets: Genbank IDs RWDD4P2 and ElF4A1P2, both pseudogenes. Inclusion of the outlier sample in the analysis resulted in only a subset (13) of these transcripts called differentially expressed. Therefore, although we cannot a priori conclude that inclusion of the outlier is not biologically relevant, its exclusion produces the most conservative estimate of compound 7's effect on HEK293T cells. The 20 μM-treated samples showed a few additional transcripts with significant changes. These included the expressed genes early growth response 1 (EGR1; log 2 (fold change) = 1.69), microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta 2 (MAP1LC3B2; log 2 (fold change) = 5.56), phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type 2 beta (PI4KIIB; log 2 (fold change) = −1.66), and ubiquitin specific peptidase 41 (USP41; log 2 (fold change = −7.85). While the tested concentration is lower than that at which changes in WST-1 metabolism indicative of toxicity were observed (vide supra) for compound 7, these additional changes may reflect compounddependent increases in cell stress and will be examined further. Overall, however, the low number of significantly altered transcripts, and in particular the near absence of expressed genes altered, highlights the selectivity of compound 7 despite its status as the least-selective of the triazole analogs studied, based on tRNA competition SPR. We next examined the effect of triazole-containing FSS RNA binders on pseudotyped HIV virion production and infectivity. In this system, 43 HEK293T producer cells are first transfected with a proviral HIV plasmid modified such that the env gene is deleted, and the nef gene is replaced with green fluorescent protein (GFP) to assist with virion detection and quantitation. Cotransfection of a vesicular stomatitis virus type G (VSV-G) plasmid provides the envelope functionality in trans to enable production of single-cycle infectious virions. Visualizing GFP production through fluorescence microscopy also allows for a qualitative assessment of virion production in producer cells. Virions produced after a 24-h incubation with various concentrations of compounds were harvested and used to infect TZM-bl reporter cells with virion quantities first normalized via a p24 ELISA assay. TZM-bl cells express luciferase upon infection with HIV 44 (via the HIV LTR promoter), providing a quantitative readout of infectivity. Indinavir, an FDA-approved protease inhibitor, 45 was employed as a positive control. We observed that compounds 3−7 substantially decreased virion production in a concentration dependent manner, as evidenced by a decrease in GFP fluorescence (Supporting Information). Virions produced were less infectious, and infectivity decreased strongly with increasing concentration of the compound (Figure 5a ). New compounds were slightly less effective than previously reported compound 2; this is offset by their significantly lower toxicity. Western blots were used to assess the effect of FSS-binding compounds on the Gag/Gag-Pol ratio. Using a p24 antibody as a probe, all new compounds were found to increase the amount of Gag-Pol relative to Gag, with 5, 6, and 7 having the strongest effect (Figure 5b) . We also examined lysates from compoundtreated producer cells by Western blot. No significant changes in Gag/Gag-Pol ratios were observed relative to control, suggesting that most of the excess Gag-Pol and its products are packaged into virions (Supporting Information). To confirm the activity of compounds in a replicationcompetent virus, we examined the effect of compounds 2, 3, Varying concentrations of compounds were added, with each condition tested in triplicate. In preliminary experiments with compounds 2, 3, and 7, one-half of the medium was harvested at 2 days postinfection and replaced with an equivalent volume of medium ± compound. The medium removed was examined for viral particles using a p24 ELISA assay. This procedure was repeated at days 4 and 6 postinfection. These experiments revealed a dose-and time-dependent inhibition of HIV IIIB for all three compounds (Supporting Information), with very low (compound 3) or undetectable (compounds 5 and 7) levels of virus present for the highest doses at days 4 and 6 postinfection. Subsequently, full dose−response profiles were obtained for compounds 3, 4, 5, and 7, at 6 days postinfection ( Figure 6 ). IC 50 values were obtained via four-parameter logistic fits of these data. They indicate similar potencies for 3, 4, and 5 (15.33, 10.17, and 14.23 μM, respectively), and a somewhat higher potency for compound 7 (4.86 μM). Decreases in virus were not due to inhibition of cell growth; indeed, more cells were present in the compound-treated wells than in the untreated but virus-infected wells at day 6 (Supporting Information), as measured by Alamar blue assay. This effect is striking and consistent with compound-mediated protection from virus-induced apoptosis. Such an effect has been seen with other anti-HIV agents. 51 Compound 7 proved toxic to HIVinfected MT-2 cells at concentrations above 15 μM. Because FSS-targeted compounds inhibit HIV-1 via a different mechanism than existing antivirals, we also examined the ability of 3, 4, 5, and 7 to inhibit a multidrug-resistant strain of the virus. The patient-derived strain HIV-1 AD.MDR01 is resistant to a broad range of protease inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. It is also highly cytopathic. 52,53 Using a similar protocol to that employed for the HIV IIIB experiments detailed above, HIV-1 AD.MDR01 infected human MT-2 cells were treated with 15 μM doses of 3, 4, 5, and 7 and evaluated both for production of the virus (p24 ELISA) and cell survival (Alamar blue) at 6 days postinfection. We were gratified to observe that compound 7 inhibited this strain, and both 4 and 7 provided statistically significant protection against its cytopathic effect (Figure 7 ). There is a continuing need to develop new anti-HIV therapies, and particularly to explore novel therapeutic targets. 54 The HIV frameshift has been recognized for some time as an attractive potential avenue to viral inhibition, but previously the lack of effective strategies for sequence-selective RNA recognition has made addressing this target a challenge. Our past work demonstrated the feasibility of degrading the infectivity of pseudotyped HIV via FSS RNA-targeted compounds. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that this strategy can also yield compounds able to strongly inhibit replication of a laboratory strain of HIV in human T cells, and one compound inhibits a highly cytopathic, multidrug-resistant strain. This is a critical step in the validation of the HIV-1 FSS RNA as a therapeutic target. It is also important to note that frameshifting is not limited to HIV-1. It is widely used in many pathogenic viruses (for example, the SARS coronavirus 55,56 and HTLV-2 57 ) and also in eukaryotes, including humans. 58, 13, 59 These recoding processes are all possible control points for driving therapeutic outcomes. As such, the approach we have applied to frameshifting in HIV-1 should be extendable to synthetic molecule control over a broad range of recoding events. In the broader context of RNA recognition, this work also demonstrates that the use of 1,4-disubsituted triazoles as disulfide bioisosteres is effective.
