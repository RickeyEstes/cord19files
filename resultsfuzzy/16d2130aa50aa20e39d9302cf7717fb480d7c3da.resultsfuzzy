Enhanced inflammation in CCR5-null infarcts was associated with accentuated adverse remodeling. Both morphometric (Figure 7 , A, B, D-F) and echocardiographic studies (Figure 7 , C and G) demonstrated that CCR5 Ϫ/Ϫ animals had increased ventricular dilation after infarction when compared with wild-type mice. In the absence of injury, wildtype and CCR5-null hearts had comparable baseline LVEDD. In both wild-type and CCR5-null animals, LVEDD significantly increased after 7 days of reperfusion in comparison with preinfarction values, reflecting the development of dilative remodeling ( Figure 7C ). However, postinfarction LVEDD was significantly higher in CCR5 Ϫ/Ϫ hearts ( Figure 7C ), indicating worse dilative remodeling. Morphometric analysis confirmed that CCR5 absence was associ- Figure 6 . CCR5 deficiency results in impaired recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to infarcted myocardium. A: Real-time PCR showed that CCR5-null infarcts had markedly reduced mRNA expression of foxp3, a specific marker of Tregs, in comparison with WT (wild-type) infarcts after 6 hours of reperfusion (*P Ͻ 0.05 versus wild-type). B and C: Flow cytometric analysis of the CD4 ϩ subset as a percentage of CD3 ϩ T cells in wild-type (B) and CCR5 KO (C) infarcts. CCR5-null infarcts had a markedly lower number of CD4 ϩ T cells when compared with wild-type animals (wild-type 45% Ϯ 3.3 versus KO 13.3% Ϯ 1.2, P Ͻ 0.01). D and E: Expression of CD4/foxp3 by CD3-gated mononuclear cells from wild-type (D) and CCR5 KO (E) infarcts. CCR5 Ϫ/Ϫ mice had a significantly lower percentage of CD4 ϩ foxp3 ϩ Tregs in the infarcted heart than wild-type animals (foxp3 ϩ CD4 ϩ cells as a percentage of total CD3 ϩ cells, wild-type: 13.3% Ϯ 1.1 versus KO: 7.2% Ϯ 1.1, P Ͻ 0.05). A representative experiment derived from isolation of mononuclear cells from two infarcted hearts for each group is shown. For statistical analysis three independent experiments (each one using pooled cells from two infarcted hearts) were performed. Flow cytometry analysis of CCR5/foxp3 (F) and IL-10/foxp3 (G) expression in wild-type splenocytes showed that foxp3 ϩ Tregs were the predominant IL-10 -producing cells (IL-10 expression was found in 27.99% Ϯ 3.63 of foxp3 ϩ T cells versus 0.61 Ϯ 0.32 of foxp3-cells, P Ͻ 0.01). H and I: CCR5 ϩ Tregs had significantly higher IL-10 expression than CCR5-Tregs (IL-10 -positive cells, CCR5 ϩ / foxp3 ϩ 42.73% Ϯ 4.07 versus CCR5 Ϫ /foxp3 ϩ 28.8 Ϯ 4.25, P Ͻ 0.05) suggesting potent antiinflammatory properties of the CCR5-expressing Treg subpopulation. A single representative dot plot derived from experiment using one spleen. Three independent experiments (three wildtype and three KO spleen) were used for statistical analysis. ated with increased chamber dilation after infarction, demonstrating significantly higher LVEDV in infarcted CCR5-null hearts ( Figure 7D ). Accentuated adverse remodeling in the absence of CCR5 was not attributable to an increase in the size of the infarct; the size of the scar was comparable between wild-type and CCR5 Ϫ/Ϫ hearts after 7 days of reperfusion ( Figure 7E ). Infarcted CCR5-null hearts also demonstrated a trend toward an increased left ventricular (LV) mass (P ϭ 0.08; Figure 7F ), indicating increased hypertrophic remodeling. Both wild-type and CCR5-null mice exhibited a significant deterioration in systolic function after myocardial infarction, evidenced by a significant reduction in FS. There was no statistically significant difference in postinfarction FS between CCR5-null and wild-type infarcted hearts ( Figure 7G ).
