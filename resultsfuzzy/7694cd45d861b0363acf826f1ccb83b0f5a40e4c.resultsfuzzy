Impact of different metabolite extraction methods on proteomic analysis. Integrative multi-omics analysis is a powerful approach to study complex biological responses and has gained popularity in recent years (1) (2) (3) . In this context, the prospect of being able to perform multiple omics measurements on the same sample is very attractive but the method is still difficult to implement, likely due to the distinct optimal conditions for extracting different types of molecules. Aiming to develop a protocol for global multi-omic analyses of the same sample, we modified an extraction approach based on a chloroform-methanol-water solution to simultaneously obtain metabolite, protein, and lipid fractions. Since the protocol is well established and since we have applied it successfully for the analysis of lipids and other metabolites in several studies (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) , we focused our efforts on determining if the method is applicable for global proteomic analysis and the associated quantification of relative amounts of proteins (i.e., the determination of fold increase or decrease in protein expression). We tested the MPLEx method with the Gram-negative bacterium Shewanella oneidensis by extracting its proteins, lipids, and metabolites (n ϭ 5). As a comparison, we also performed extractions using 100% methanol (MeOH) or 100% acetonitrile (ACN) (n ϭ 5 [each]), which are commonly used solvents for metabolomics extractions. We found that significantly reduced total protein fractions were recovered after extraction of metabolites and lipids by all three methods compared to control samples prepared using a standard protocol (Control) (Fig. 1A) . These results are in agreement with previous data from the literature showing that some protein mass is lost during precipitation procedures (20) . We then evaluated if these protein losses affected the ability to obtain useful proteomic data, since a method that can simultaneously extract multiple omics sources from the same sample would be extremely useful for systems biology experiments and subsequent integrated data analysis, as well as in cases where limited sample amounts are available (e.g., a survey of data from the National Cancer Institute showed that obtaining an adequate number of samples to conduct a study is a major difficulty facing researchers [21] ). Thus, we investigated whether extraction with organic solvents would have a major impact on the coverage and the quantitative aspect of the associated proteomic analysis. To explore this issue, proteins extracted with MPLEx, ACN, and MeOH methods were digested in parallel with control samples, normalized by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, and analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) using the accurate mass & time (AMT) tag approach (22) . The results of the proteomic analysis of samples extracted with different methods showed that the numbers of peptides detected in the MPLEx samples were very similar (no significant difference) to the numbers seen with controls (Fig. 1B) . A significant increase in the levels of peptides was identified in samples extracted with ACN, but no significant differences between the control and MeOH extractions in the numbers of peptides were observed (Fig. 1B) . The overlap of the numbers of peptides identified in samples extracted with all protocols was very high, as shown by a similarity matrix (Fig. 1C) . The similarities between samples were even higher at the protein level ( Fig. 1D and E). The similarity of the proteome coverage results obtained by the different extraction methods is remarkable, considering that much larger (up to 3-fold to 4-fold) differences are observed just by digesting proteins using different buffers, surfactants, or denaturing agents, even without any previous extraction (23, 24) . Our results show that despite some protein mass losses, the choice of extraction protocol did not significantly affect the proteome coverage. The selective loss of a few proteins during the extraction procedure is expected and has been shown in a study carried out with human plasma samples only (20) . Another important feature for multi-omic analysis is that of being able to accurately identify differentially expressed or abundant molecules. In this context, if the extraction procedure affects the quality of the proteins, then it might increase the variance across different samples. Thus, we examined the correlation of the proteomics data between samples extracted with different organic solvents, and the results showed remarkable similarity at both peptide and protein levels ( Fig. 1F and G). We then calculated the variance of protein measurements by comparing different extraction protocols. Indeed, no significant differences in the distributions of coefficients of variance (CV) were observed comparing MPLEx with controls, with the CVs of the great majority of the proteins smaller than 25%, with peaks of Ͻ10% (Fig. 1H ). MeOH extraction led to CVs that were similar to but slightly smaller than those seen with the MPLEx and control samples (Fig. 1H ). On the other hand, ACN extraction had a bimodal distribution, with very low and very high CVs (Fig. 1H) , suggesting that some proteins are not reproducibly precipitated with this solvent. This phenomenon might be due to the fact that acetonitrile does not fully precipitate small proteins (25) . Taken together, these results showed that MPLEx did not affect the proteome coverage or the results of quantitative analysis of the S. oneidensis samples.
