In the weeks following the death of the patient in the OTC study, the FDA conducted a directed inspection of the clinical site and the Institutional Review Board at the University of Pennsylvania, as well as an inspection of the animal experiments conducted in support of the clinical program. All three inspections found deviations and deficiencies, including inadequate clinical monitoring and oversight of the clinical trial, inadequate reporting of adverse events, and failure to follow clinical and preclinical study protocols. As a result of these directed inspections, the FDA placed the remainder of the clinical studies under the same sponsorship on clinical hold and issued warning letters to the sponsor, to all of the clinical investigators involved in the OTC trial, and to the director of the preclinical laboratory facility. The FDA also issued a Notice of Initiation of Disqualification Proceedings and Opportunity to Explain (NIDPOE) Letter to the principal investigator. Redacted versions of these letters are available at the CBER w^ebsites [31, 32] . A second clinical inspection of a different site, using a different class of vector for gene transfer in cardiac and peripheral vascular disease also found numerous discrepancies in the conduct of the clinical trials and compliance with the regulations governing investigational new agents [31] . As a result of these two inspections, the FDA determined that a more systematic review of procedures to ensure compliance with regulations was warranted. This was accomplished by two specific activities. In March of 2000, the FDA issued a letter to all Gene Therapy IND or Master File sponsors requesting information on the gene transfer product characterization, a review of the preclinical safety studies to ensure any findings that met the criteria requiring an expedited report as per 21 CFR 312.32-33 were submitted, and a summary of the procedures to ensure adequate monitoring and adequate oversight. A copy of the March 6, 2000, letter is available at http://www.fda.gov/cber/genetherapy/gtpubs.htm. In The March 6, 2000, letter was sent to approximately 150 sponsors holding slightly less than 300 total active INDs or master files. Items 1-5 of the letter were questions regarding product testing and characterization data, test methods, specifications, information regarding other products produced in the facility, and quality control procedures. The goals were to: (i) ensure that all gene therapy products currently in clinical trials are adequately tested by contemporary standards, (ii) determine where testing requirements need to be made more stringent or relaxed, (iii) gather information to aid in development of additional guidance, (iv) gain information concerning product characterization and manufacturing processes and arrangements in order to move these products forward toward licensure, and (v) develop a mechanism to ensure that IND annual reports routinely contain updates of this information. In general, sponsors of adenovirus gene transfer trials have been in compliance with FDA recommendations and expectations regarding adenovirus vector product characterization. In addition, review of the adenovirus vector lot information led to recent changes in recommendations regarding vector infectious particle and total particle measurements as v^ell as a change in the recommendation regarding RCA. In addition to requests for information on manufacturing practices, the March 6 letter also asked sponsors to provide a summary of the monitoring program for each clinical study conducted under their IND and documentation of their oversight function. The intent w^as to confirm or bring sponsors into compliance v^^ith GCP as required under 21 CFR 312, subpart D, and as described in the ICH GCP guidance. FDA review^ of the descriptions of the clinical monitoring programs found that the monitoring programs in general incorporated many of the activities and procedures in accordance v^ith the ICH GCP guidance and the requirements listed 21 CFR 312, subpart D. How^ever, some areas of deficiencies were noted, including but not limited to lack of procedures to correct or remove noncompliant investigators, ensuring reporting of protocol modifications to FDA, and ensuring safety reports are filed to the IND in a timely fashion. The last question in the March 6 letter was intended to remind sponsors that certain findings from animal experiments, i.e., severe toxicities and/or deaths on study, also rise to the level of an expedited report. It asked the sponsors to verify that such data, if relevant, either had already been submitted as required under regulation, or, if not previously submitted, that the data be promptly submitted to the IND or master file. In general, most sponsors indicated they were already in compliance with reporting requirements for such data. The sites inspected were chosen at random. Specific questions regarding the background information on the product and the clinical study were developed by the inspection team, and focused on the conduct of the protocol, the reporting of adverse events, blinding of study medication where applicable, and whether the clinical end points were met. CBER field inspectors conducted the inspections between April and August 2000. In general, these inspections found that most sponsors, both commercial and academic, as well as clinical investigators, were in compliance with the regulations. Of the 70 sites inspected, 11 had no current, active clinical trials or had never initiated their proposed studies, and 23 (33%) required no further action from FDA. Approximately half of the sites had objectionable conditions or practices identified by the inspection team; however, in 33 cases (47% of total sites), only voluntary action to correct the deficiencies was called for. Only three sites were identified where official regulatory action (i.e., warning letters) was required. The most common deficiencies in all of these cases were: (i) failure to follow the protocol; (ii) an inadequate consent form; (iii) lack of supporting data for case report form entries and/or discrepancies between the source documents and the case report forms; (iv) inadequate drug accountability records; and (v) the failure to notify the Institutional Review Board(s) of protocol changes, adverse events, or deaths. In summary, the targeted inspections in gene transfer research clinical trials demonstrated, with a few exceptions, that studies were being conducted according to appropriate regulation and guidance. Where deviations were noted, they appeared to be similar to those found in routine inspections of Phase 3 studies of more traditional, biologic agents. The FDA will continue to conduct inspections of clinical, preclinical, and/or manufacturing sites involved in gene transfer research on "for cause" as well as routine bases as part of our role in protecting the safety of patients enrolled in these trials.
