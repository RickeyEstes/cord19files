Although there is much evidence that secretion or surface display of protective antigens on RABV strains yields better immune responses and protective immunity (Kang and Curtiss, 2003 ; see above), this is not always true and Sizemore et al. (2012) found that much higher antibody titers against Y. pestis F1 and LcrV antigens were induced when they were retained in the cytoplasm of the attenuated Î”phoPQ S. Typhimurium strain rather than when they were secreted.
