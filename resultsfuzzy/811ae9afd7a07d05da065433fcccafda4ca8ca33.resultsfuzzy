When studying all possible constitutional isomers of oxadiazolone preserving five-membered ring with the second O-atom attached to the ring, one has to consider all permutations of the three heteroatoms in the ring except the C-atom to which the external heteroatom is attached to. There are three different constitutional isomers with two adjacent N-atoms, derivatives of oxapyrazolone, and analogously there are three derivatives of oxaimidazolone, where the two N-atoms are separated either by C or O-atom (Scheme 1). All these types are labeled by the letters from A to F (Scheme 1). Each of the above compounds may undergo tautomeric changes related to the attachment of the ''acidic'' Hatom either to one of the N-atoms in the ring, the external heteroatom, or possibly to the C-atom in the ring to form CH 2 group (Scheme 2). These tautomers are labeled by numbers from 1 to 5. Attachment of the H-atom to the ring O or S atom results in ring opening and such non-heterocyclic structures are not considered further. Thus, in this study we considered 30 of C 2 H 2 N 2 O 2 and 30 of C 2 H 2 N 2 S 2 structures as well as 30 of C 2 H 2 N 2 OS and 30 of C 2 H 2-N 2 SO structures differing by external or internal position of the S-atom. However, not all considered structures appeared to be stable at the chosen computational level.
