To investigate the levels of ubiquitinated cellular proteins during PRRSV infection, we infected Marc-145 cells (a clone of the African green monkey kidney cell line MA-104) with PRRSV strain WUH3 at an multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. Cell lysates were collected at different time points post infection and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-ubiquitin. As shown in Fig. 1A , while the level of ubiquitinated cellular proteins was steady in mock-infected cells (lanes 1-3), it varied dynamically during the course of PRRSV infection. A decrease in ubiquitination was first observed at 6 h post infection (h.p.i.) (compare lanes 5 vs. 4), reaching a plateau phase between 12 and 36 h.p.i. (lanes 6-8 vs. 4). Although there was a slight rebound at 48 h.p.i. (lane 9), the level of ubiquitinated cellular proteins remained substantially lower than that of mock-infected cells (lane 4). When Marc-145 cells were infected with PRRSV at increasing MOIs, the levels of ubiquitinated cellular proteins were reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B) . Importantly, infection with UV-inactivated PRRSV, which is capable of receptor binding and internalization but not viral gene synthesis, did not alter the cellular level of ubiquitinated protein conjugates (Fig. 1B) . Similar results were observed in PRRSVinfected PK-15-CD163 cells (Fig. 1C) . These data demonstrate that the level of ubiquitinated cellular proteins is reduced in PRRSVinfected cells and that this is a result of active viral replication. Of note, the latter notion was also supported by the Western blot data that measured expression of PRRSV Nsp2 protein at different time points post infection (Fig. 1A) .
