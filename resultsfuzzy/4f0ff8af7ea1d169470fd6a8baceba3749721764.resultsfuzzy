In this study, we have reported a two-step way of hetero structuring magnetoplasmonic and fluorescent nanocrystals through immunoreaction for IBV detection. Firstly, ZrQDs and MP NPs were prepared, then antibodies was conjugated with nanomaterials ( Fig. 1AeD) . ZrQDs and MP NPs will stay apart from each other since no attraction between them at this point. Antibody-conjugated ZrQDs and MP NPs will come closer and will make a magnetoplasmonic-fluorescent nanohybrids structure while target analyte was added (Fig. 1E) . Then, external magnet can be used to separate nanostructured magnetoplasmonic-fluorescent ( Fig. 1F & G) , and the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of nanohybrids can be used to measure the analyte's concentration (Fig. 1H) . The fluorescence and absorbance spectra of Zr QDs were appeared at 412 nm and 378 nm, respectively ( Fig. 2A & B) . As-prepared Zr QDs showed chiral peak at 352 nm (Fig. 2C) . Zr QDs showed light yellow color at daylight, and blue under UV-light (Fig. 2D) . The quantum yield value of the synthesized Zr QDs was 9.16 % and the fluorescence lifetime was 1.92 ns. Zr QDs synthetic route was shown in Fig. 3A . After synthesis of Zr QDs, FEI Titan 8-300 TEM machine was used to take HRTEM of Zr NPs and QDs. As shown in QDs showed that the QDs size was 2e3 nm (Fig. 3C ). HRTEM image revealed Zr QDs contained lattice spacing of 0.2821 nm, indicating (100) lattice planes of the Zr (Fig. 3D) (Almyras et al., 2010) . Fig. 4 shows the XPS spectrum of Zr NPs (Fig. 4A) and QDs (Fig. 4B) . A peak of Zr 3d 3/2 and Zr 3d 5/2 were appeared in all the samples. In Zr NPs, the Zr 3d peaks were observed at 185.4 ev for 3d 5/2 and 187.7 ev for 3d 3/2 , as shown in Fig. 4A (Ali et al., 2014; Bakradze et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2015) . However, the peaks of Zr 3d 3/2 and Zr 3d 5/2 were slightly shifted for Zr QDs, probably due to the change and coupling of electronic state. The crystallinity of Zr QDs was analyzed by XRD spectroscopy and shown in Fig. 5 . It is clear from Fig. 3 that as-synthesized Zr QDs contain two crystalline phases: a monoclinic phase, marked with the red squares, and a tetragonal phase, marked with the blue squares. Zr QDs contain a higher component of the monoclinic than the tetragonal phase. The peak positions of Zr QDs and ZrO 2 are shifted a little bit (Ali et al., 2014; Eshed et al., 2011) , probably, due to the crystal defects formed during synthesis. The cytotoxicity of as-prepared Zr QDs was performed on C6 glioma cells using MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 6 , no obvious cytotoxicity effects on C6 glioma cells In this study, we performed the nanotoxicity effects of Zr QDs without surface modification. Insightful cytotoxicity study of as-prepared Zr QDs may be needed with surface modification with different biomolecules and their application on different cells in near future. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of spiky magneto-plasmonic nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 7A . The average size of particles was around 50 nm. Magnified close-up TEM image showed the surface of the MP NPs containing spiky tips of approximately 10 nm in size (Fig. 7B) . Naked eye color of solution was showed at the inset of Fig. 7B . The broadened plasmonic peak of the MP NPs was located at 598 nm (Fig. 7C) . The SQUID measurement of MP NPs has shown in The specificity of anti-IBV antibodies toward the target IBV was shown in Fig. 8 . A higher absorbance value of anti-IBV antibodies in comparison to others tells that anti-IBV antibodies have a strong binding affinity toward the target IBV. Anti-IBV antibodies binding with MP NPs and Zr QDs was shown Fig. 9 . A higher absorbance value for anti-IBV antibodies with nanomaterials indicates the confirmation of binding between antibodies and nanomaterials. Also, the change of zeta potential value further supported the conjugation of antibodies with QDs (Table 1) . FTIR spectrum analyzed for the amide bond formation between antibodies and MP ( Fig. 10) . The peak at 3500e3700 cm À1 and 1630e1690 cm À1 corresponds the NeH stretching and C¼O stretching of amide bond respectively. The fluorescence intensity of immune-linked magnetoplasmonic-fluorescent nanohybrids increased approximately 25% in comparison to antibody-conjugated Zr QDs (Fig. 11A ). The change in fluorescence intensity at different concentrated virus solution was investigated ( Fig. 11B and C) . The PL intensity changes with the different concentrations of virus solution was linearly responds in the range of 10,000 EID/50 mL to 100 EID/50 mL with an LOD value of 79.15 EID/50 mL. The selectivity of the proposed bioassay was examined with other virus strains, namely H5N1, H5N2, H9N2, H4N6, and FAdV. A significant difference of fluorescence intensity was observed with the target IBV compare to others, indicating that the proposed assay is highly selective for the target analyte (Fig. 11D ). The sensitivity of this assay was compared with the ELISA method ( Table 2 ). The colorimetric response of IBV using ELISA was 1000 EID/50 mL, tells us that the proposed fluorescence assay is 10 times more sensitive than ELISA. In this study, we have introduced aqueous soluble chiral Zr QDs for the first time. There is still much to be learned about the nature of Zr QDs, such as how excitonic properties arise on it, it's size-tunable optical properties, surface modification with different biological molecules, and the control of the interaction between Zr QDs and plasmonic metals.
