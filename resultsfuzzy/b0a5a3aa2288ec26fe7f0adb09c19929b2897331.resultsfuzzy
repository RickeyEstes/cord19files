In conducting the empirical estimation, this paper uses quarterly data of 58 semiconductor firms listed on TAIEX from 2003: 1Q to 2013: 4Q, gathered from the Taiwan Economic Journal databank. The data of CDS, VIX, and TED spread come from the Datastream database, Chicago Board Options Exchange, and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, respectively. 4 Thus, there are 2552 observations. 5 The reason for choosing these firms is that currently Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association represents approximately 70% of worldwide IC foundry revenue, around 55% of worldwide package revenue, around 76% of worldwide testing revenue, and around 20% of worldwide design revenue. Notably, these firms have different patterns of stock returns, which can satisfy the heterogeneity of cross-firm effects that influence stock returns differently. CDS is measured by the five-year CDS index written by the Citibank. Market return is measured by the Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX). Risk-free rate is measured by the return on 1-month time deposit. Following Fama and French (1993) , we can obtain the size factor (R SMB ) and book-to-market ratio factor (R HML ). First, we divide the semi-conductor firms into two groups based on market capitalization, i.e., small market capitalization (S) and big market capitalization (B). Second, we further divide each market capitalization group into three sub-groups based on break points for bottom 30% (L), middle 40% (M), and top 30% (H) of book-to-market ratios. Thus, we have six portfolios (SL, SM, SH, BL, BM, BH). Then the R SMB and R HML can be calculated from the following two formulas. where R is the portfolio return of group indexed by the subscript letter. Thus, R SMB is the average return of small market capitalization equity portfolio return minus big market capitalization equity portfolio return, and R HML is the average return of the high book-to-market equity portfolio return minus low book-to-market equity return. The results of descriptive statistics and panel unit root test for the variables under investigation are displayed in Tables A1 and A2. The results of the panel unit root tests show that all the variables satisfy the condition of stationarity. To confirm whether using the reconstructed PSTR models are proper, we perform the linearity testing and no remaining non-linearity test. The linearity tests are executed for various PSTR models, formed by different specifications of transition variables (CDS, VIX, and TED), location parameters (m = 1, 2), and lag length of transition variables (d = 0, 1, . . ., 6), by using LMF testing statistic. The 4 The historical data of Taiwan's VIX and CDS began in 2007 and 2008, respectively. In addition, the trading volumes of these two products are relatively rare in the first three years. Based on the considerations of enough observations in the panel context or the liquidity of market, the usefulness of the VIX and CDS in Taiwan is doubtful. In addition, Pao (2010) finds that there are long-run equilibrium relationships between the CBOE VIX and the volatility indices in other countries (Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, UK, and Europe). Moreover, 80% of the trading volumes in global CDS concentrate on the US. Thus, we do not execute the estimation of the PSTR models with Taiwan's VIX or CDS as the transition variable and engage in the comparison of the results by employing domestic VIX (or CDS) and global VIX (i.e., the CBOE VIX) (or CDS) as the transition variable. However, we hope to fill the gap in the future as the data are reliable. 5 This sample of firms is dictated by data availability. testing results of linearity are shown in Table 1 . Evidently, except for two cases of PSTR-CDS model with d = 4 and m = 1 and PSTR-VIX model with d = 4 and m = 1, the remaining cases significantly reject the null hypothesis of linearity. Thus, the stock returns display a non-linear dynamic path, and it is proper to adopt non-linear PSTR models to estimate stock returns and risk premiums. Once the non-linearity of stock returns is verified, we can perform the no remaining non-linearity test to determine the optimal number of transition functions. The testing results are displayed in Table 2 . 6 Clearly, most PSTR models have at least two transition functions. However, this study uses the AIC and BIC to determine the optimal PSTR models for different transition variables. For CDS as the transition variable (i.e., the PSTR-CDS model), the optimal model that has minimum AIC is the PSTR-CDS model with m = 2, r = 1, and d = 6. For the PSTR-VIX model (VIX as the transition variable), the optimal model is the one with d = 5, r = 1, and m = 2, and for PSTR-TED model (i.e., TED spread as the transition variable), the optimal model is the one with d = 6 and r = m = 1. Table 3 reports the estimation results of PSTR models with three proxies of investor sentiment as transition variables, and the standard F-F model. For the PSTR-CDS model, the transition parameter is 2.212 and two threshold parameters are 14.33 and 127.4. In terms of the PSTR-VIX model, the transition parameter is 225.7 and two threshold parameters are 12.82 and 14.70. Regarding the PSTR-TED model, the transition parameter and threshold parameter are 0.25% and 0.249, respectively. Evidently, the transition function in the PSTR-CDS and PSTR-VIX models is symmetric and in the PSTR-TED model is asymmetric.
