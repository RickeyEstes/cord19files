In a previous transcriptome profiling study using a surrogate LF model in monkeys we showed that significant changes in PBMC gene expression occurred during pre-viremic days 1, 2, and 3 [24] , clearly differentiating pathogenic versus non-pathogenic infections even before detectable virus replication. Clearly, a large part of the response to viruses is due to signal transduction of uninfected bystander cells. In this study, PBMC from three healthy donors were exposed to LASV or ML29 viruses at 1 MOI in duplicate and were collected at 4, 8, and 24 hours post-exposure (hpe) for isolation of total RNA. cDNA was hybridized to Affymetrix chips covering the whole human genome. Cluster and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that all samples clustered together by time (4, 8, and 24 hpe), by donor (3 healthy donors) and by treatment (unexposed, LASV-exposed, and ML29-exposed cells) ( Figure  S1 ). Since donor variation exceeded treatment variation, pairwise Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) was used to compare RNA samples before and after exposure for each donor at different time points. Differentially-expressed genes were defined as those that had at least a .2-fold changes with respect to media controls. A total of 122 genes were identified as being differentially expressed at tested time-points ( Figure 1 and Table S1 ). Gene expression changes in ML29 and LASV-exposed PBMC were detected at 4 and 8 hpe respectively, with all genes up-regulated in LASV in contrast to ML29 with 11 down-regulated genes (4 at 4 hpe and 7 at 8 hpe). At 24 hpe LASV-treated PBMC showed the maximum changes (122 genes) in comparison with ML29exposed samples. Gene ontology analysis of global changes in LASV versus ML29-exposed PBMC In order to have a general view of the pathways affected by both virus exposures we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed genes. The analyses revealed that the most affected genes were involved in type I IFN-stimulated pathways (21%-17 genes from 122), apoptosis (12.29%-15/122), and NFkappa B pathways (10.65%-13/122) ( Figure 2A) . Although, Several genes could be put into more than one category, the interferon-related genes had the higher percentage of presence. From those categories the immune response, defense response and response to viruses were selected for validation analysis ( Table 1 ). The most differentially expressed genes between LASV and ML29 are shown in Table 2 . LASV exposure up-regulates genes involved in innate immunity: IFN-stimulated genes, transcription factors, and genes involved in apoptosis As shown in Figure 2A , the most striking differences involved gene expression in three different functional categories: IFNstimulated, apoptosis, and NF-kB pathways, during the late timepoint, 24 h after exposure. To confirm the observed gene expression changes in PBMC exposed to LASV and ML29 viruses, the most affected probesets, the ISG, were selected for further validation. RNA samples from the 24-hr LASV-and ML29-exposed cells were assayed in duplicate using a human IFN and Receptors qRT-PCR Superarray kit (see Methods). Levels of expression of 17 gene-targets were expressed in fold changes (Table 1 and figure 2B ). Exposure of human PBMC to LASV resulted in over-expression of all 17 IFN-stimulated genes by 2-to 100-fold over background. Exposure of PBMC to ML29 had relatively little effect on the 17 tested genes. Comparative analyses showed a good correlation (76%) between the two techniques, DNA array and IFN qRT-PCR array (Table 1) . For a few genes measured in the DNA array, ML29 exposure gave a higher background than quantitation by real-time PCR. This is because the housekeeping genes we used for normalizing the PCR data, including GAPDH, were not constantly expressed in the compared data sets, whereas probesets used for normalizing the microarray data varied less than 0.04% in all data sets (see Methods). The most affected gene, IFI6, is the first IFN-stimulated gene known to inhibit apoptosis [46] . Among other most affected genes were IFI35, IFITM1, IRF-7, and SP110. While the function of the IFI35 gene is not well-defined, the IFITM proteins have roles in immune cell signaling and adhesion, cancer, germ cell physiology, and bone mineralization. IFITMs are also viral restriction factors that block entry of Influenza, Ebola, Dengue and West Nile viruses but not arenavirus-envelope pseudotyped particles [47] [48] [49] . IRF-7 is over-expressed in LASVexposed PBMC and others found that it could be up-regulated in 3-day LASV-infected monocyte-derived macrophages [50] . IRF-7 is also known to limit the burst size of LCMV in culture but is Table S1 in the supplemental material. Green color represents down-regulated genes (two-fold or more when compared with non-exposed control). Red color represents up-regulated genes (two-fold or more when compared with non-exposed control). doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002406.g001 not ultimately essential for LCMV clearance in vivo [51] . IRF-7 and IRF-3 are transcription factors which together with NF-kB and ATF-2/cJUN induce production of IFN-I. IRF-3 is required for the activation of IFN-b, which in turn, primes the expression of most IFN-a genes by IFN-induced IRF-7 through the STAT-1 pathway. Human SP110 plays an important role in resistance to intracellular pathogens such as human mycobacteria and intracellular cancers. Recently cellular proteins have been described that mediate the interaction of SP110 and viral proteins during viral infections [52] . Among apoptosis-related genes, the most striking difference was observed in the expression of matrix metalloproteinase, MMP-1 (interstitial collagenase), up-regulated .65-fold in LASV-exposed cells versus ML-29-exposed cells ( Table 2 ). Proteins of the MMP family normally breakdown extracellular matrix during embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. MMP-1 is known to interact with Tat, the HIV transactivating protein, and this interaction results in the degradation of Tat and depression of Tat-mediated neurotoxicity and transactivation [53] . Two other apoptosis-related genes, SPP1 and INHBA, were upregulated 14-and 20-fold, respectively (Table 2) . SPP1, a secreted arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD)-containing phosphoprotein 1 (previous names: osteopontin, bone sialoprotein I), enhances IFNc and IL-12 production and contributes to host defense, bone formation, and wound healing by stimulating macrophage migration as well as protecting against viral and bacterial infections through its pro-Th1 effect [54] . Inhibin-beta A (INHBA) joins Inhibin-alpha to form a pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion inhibitor. Inhibin has been shown to negatively-regulate gonadal stromal cell proliferation and to have tumor-suppressor activity. INHBA is also up-regulated by vaccinia and inhibits a diverse array of cytokines by enabling vaccinia virus E3 protein to antagonize several distinct but interlinked signaling cascades [55] . Exposure of human PBMC to LASV was associated with strong up-regulation (22-25-fold) of CXCL6 and IL1A genes in comparison to ML29 exposure ( Table 2) . Among CXC chemokines, CXCL6, a granulocyte chemotactic protein-2, shares the highest functional homology with IL-8. Both CXCL6 and IL1A exhibit disparate regulatory effects on recruited neutrophil responses [56] [57] .
