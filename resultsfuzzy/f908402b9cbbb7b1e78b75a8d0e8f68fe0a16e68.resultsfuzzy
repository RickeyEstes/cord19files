Especially the analysis of the survey data along the two dimensions ''expectational probability'' and ''impact'' provides valuable insights. In Fig. 3 , we illustrate the results for all of the 41 projections in the form of a scatterplot. Each number represents the corresponding projection listed in Table 1 . A diamond represents a projection where consensus among the experts was achieved. A black dot represents those projections, where consensus among the experts was not achieved. The distribution of projections in Fig. 3 provides interesting insights. It can be observed that most of the projections have an average impact of 3 or higher, as well as an average expectational probability of 50% or more. In general, this demonstrates the relevance of the projections developed in the first phase within the research project. The results indicate that the a priori formulation and selection of projections have accurately taken place. Another interesting result can be observed with respect to the consensus/dissent distribution. The results clearly demonstrate that projections, where consensus was not achieved, have an average expectational probability of 40-60%, whereas consensus projections predominantly exhibit a probability of 60-80%. This finding is rather common in Delphi studies (see e.g. Ogden et al., 2005, pp. 34-35) . By its nature, dissent is more likely to be associated with projections for which the future development is still difficult to assess. Clearly, for projections with high expectational probabilities (above 60%), the experts have a higher level of agreement. Further interpretation of the results will be provided in Section 4.2.
