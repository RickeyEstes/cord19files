The plastic-based microfluidic devices were fabricated by an injection molding technique. The microchannels-embedded master mold was obtained by a milling technique, and it was used for casing the microfluidic devices. In this case, COC was chosen as a substrate material to produce the device due to its great advantages over the other thermoplastic polymers in terms of optical, physical and chemical properties and biocompatibility. The total cycle time of the microinjection molding process took less than 1 min to replicate the COC substrate. After location of the master mold in the injection mold machine, COC was injected through the nozzle, and the microfluidic device was released from the mold. The production process and conditions are similar to the previous research which demonstrated various microinjection conditions to form microstructures [17] . Holes of 1 mm in diameter for an inlet and outlet ports were punched to load the sample and buffer solutions into the microchannels. As shown in Figure 1 , the channel depths are 200 and 500 μm with 450 μm in width, respectively. The diameter of the detection chamber is 1 mm, and it was coated with chromium and gold by sputtering for the immobilization of GBP-H1a fusion protein. The design and fabrication process of microfluidic device are described in Figure 1(A) . The key features of microstructures including welding lines, gold deposition on detection chamber, and backflow prevention structures are schematically demonstrated in Figure 1B . Previously, thermal bonding method has been popular to bond plastic-based microfluidic device. However, this method requires high temperature and takes too much time to bond it. Recently, an ultrasonic bonding method has been developed as an alternative solution to the thermal bonding. However, welding line is essential for bonding between plastic chips in this technique. In this experiment, we carefully designed the welding lines as shown in red color in Figure 1 (B), and these lines were melted during the ultrasonic bonding process for the sealing of the chips. After coating of gold, two COC plates were placed on the ultrasonic bonder (2,000X, Branson) and set the bonder in time mode with weld frequency of 20 kHz. After the setting of the mode, the COC was bonded as following conditions: (1) 800 Pa weld pressure, (2) 0.2 s of weld time, (3) 75% of amplitude, (4) 10 s of hold time, (5) 1.5 kPa of hold pressure. Occasionally, backflow of the buffer or target solutions occurs in microfluidic channels during the injection to cause a contamination problem. Therefore, there would be required a unique microstructure in a microchannel to prevent backflow of solution and contamination of microchannel. Among various methods, two different channel depths were applied into this device as shown in Figure 1(B) . This method was worked properly due to the pressure difference in the microchannel to prevent the backflow. The integrated microfluidic immunosensor chips can reduce the analytical time compared to the conventional methods. In addition, usage of plastic facilitates low-cost mass production of disposable and easy-to-use microfluidic chips. Previously reported plastic-based immunosensors required a surface modification step for the immobilization of biomolecules. Among these methods, silanization using 3-aminopropyltriethyoxysilane (APTES) is a widely used method for coupling of biomolecules onto the inorganic substrate [18] . However, silane is difficult to react with organic materials without any hydroxyl groups present on the surface by using UV/ozone treatment [5] . In order to overcome these issues, a specially engineered peptide was developed and used to immobilize onto the specific targeted surface, especially gold. There is no requirement of complicated steps for coupling of antibody or antigen. The GBP-H1a fusion protein can be simply and selectively immobilized in the microchannel on the gold surface as described in Figure 1(C) . In this device, Y shaped inlet channels with backflow-prevented microstructure and detection chambers were designed for an efficient immunoassay as shown in Figure 2 . The key features of microstructures in microfluidic device were successfully replicated using the microinjection molding, and they were confirmed through top and tilted scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S4800, Ibaraki, Japan) images as shown in Figure 2(C-F) . Due to the height differences between inlet channels and main channels (Figure 2(C,D) ), this could prevent the backflow of the solutions. This device is composed of three detection chambers with 1 mm in diameter for the further immobilization of GBP-H1a fusion protein as shown in Figure 2 , and these chambers may reduce the errors during analysis by averaging signals. All protuberant microstructures near to the microchannels were specially designed as welding lines. During the ultrasonic bonding process to bond the top and bottom of the microfluidic chip, these lines would be melted by concentrating the ultrasonic energies on the top of welding lines. To investigate the sensing window of the fusion protein, different concentrations (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100 and 200 μg/mL, respectively) of GBP-H1a fusion protein were immobilized onto the gold chip surface by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) microfluidics. A greater shift in resonance unit (RU) was observed by SPR analysis with increasing concentration of immobilized GBP-H1a fusion protein bound on the planar surface at various concentrations as shown in Figure 3(A) . These results suggest that the SPR sensor with GBP-fusion protein implemented on the gold surface can be an effective system for biomolecular immobilization. Furthermore, the concentration of GBP-H1a fusion protein was fixed to 100 μg/mL due to its best immobilization concentration. For the subsequent binding of anti-H1 Ab, different concentrations (1.5 to 400 μg/mL) of specific antibody were bound to the GBP-H1a fusion protein on the gold sensor chip. The saturated 4,000 RU value obtained with SRP experiments implies that about 4 ng of anti-H1 Ab was immobilized onto the gold surface area of 1 mm 2 . One RU is determined as 0.0001° of resonance angle shift and equivalent to a mass change of the 1 pg/mm 2 on the SPR sensor chip surface [19, 20] . Specific anti-H1 Ab against the H1 influenza surface antigen, which is a hemagglutinin subunit having a high immunogenicity and surface probability, was applied to the GBP-H1a fusion protein-layered surface to monitor specific binding between GBP-H1a fusion protein and anti-H1 Ab by SPR biosensor as shown in Figure 3(B) . To further investigate whether this microfluidic device can be used in immunoassay, we employed GBP-H1a fusion protein, BSA as a blocking agent and Cy3-labeled anti-H1 Ab. Cy3-labeled anti-H1 Ab is a strongly fluorescent molecule, and the fluorescence-based immunoassay is more sensitive compared to the most colorimetric assays in most of the cases [5] . The whole immunosensing process was carried out by using COC microfluidic chips at room temperature. The three detection chambers are included in one microchannel to verify the sensing results which may reduce the error of the signal. In addition, one chip is composed of three different detection zones to test different concentrations of the target Abs. First of all, 100 μg/mL of GBP-H1a fusion protein was injected through the microchannel for the immobilization on the surface of gold surface. After immobilization for 1 h, all the chips were washed with PBS solution and BSA solution (1 mg/mL) was injected to the channels to prevent the non-specific binding then washed with PBS solution. After the blocking and washing process, five different concentrations of Cy3-labeled-Ab (100, 50, 10, 5, and 1 μg/mL, respectively) were injected through the microchannel and left them for 1 h. After incubation for the further reaction, all immunosensors were rinsed with PBS solution three times, and the microchannels were blown off by air. All microfluidic immunosensor chips were examined under same conditions of confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss LSM510 Meta NLO, Göttingen, Germany) as shown in Figure 4 . At the low concentration of Cy3-labeled Ab applied, small fluorescent signals were observed in the detection chambers. As increasing the concentration of Ab, the whole detection chamber was covered with red fluorescence, and the signal intensities were also increased. In order to compare the signal intensity, the intensity profiles were also recorded because the fluorescence intensity is directly proportional to the amount of Cy3-labeled Ab attached to the surface of detection chamber. The fluorescence intensity changes at the center of chamber were measured, and their fluorescent images with same scale in Y-axis were showed. The fluorescent intensity graphs which correspond to each inserted white line also showed similar signal changing patterns compared with the fluorescent image. From these results, the specific binding of GBP-H1a was successfully immobilized on the gold surface, and the fluorescent images and emission profiles were subsequently increased due to the effective binding of Cy3-labeled anti-H1 Ab, which could be applicable in immunoassay onto the microfluidic chip surface. As a result, the fluorescent intensity depends on the number of immobilized Cy3-labeled-Ab in the detection chamber under the same incubation period. In addition, all detection chambers were analyzed using the line profiles. As increasing the amount of Ab, the intensity of line profiles also increases over the time, and the intensity line is getting increased, which is properly matching with fluorescence images. From the analyzed fluorescence results, the calibration curve, which represents the relationship between the fluorescence intensity and Cy3-labeled-Ab, is shown in Figure 4 (G). The regression equation could be expressed as: where I is the fluorescence intensity and C is the concentration (μg/mL) of Cy3-labeled-Ab with a correlation coefficient of 0.983.
