To verify the finding, that the transcriptional changes are mainly related to processes involving the immune system, the amount of CD3 ϩ T lymphocytes, CD45R/B220 ϩ B lymphocytes, IgG ϩ cells and CD107b ϩ macrophages was investigated in the spinal cord of affected mice (Fig. 5A-D) . Furthermore the MBP ϩ white matter area was assessed, to quantify the amount of demyelination (Fig. 5E ). Immunohistochemistry displayed multifocal to coalescing parenchymal inflammatory infiltrates as well as a progressively decreasing MBP immunoreactivity (Fig. 6) (Fig. 5A-D) . The MBP ϩ area was significantly decreased at 196 dpi in TMEVinfected compared to mock-infected mice (Fig. 5E) . The mean amount of each cell type or investigated protein was correlated to the respective gene expression employing Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, using the data from both groups and all four experimental days (n ϭ 47; Table 3) . Notably, the genes coding for the analysed proteins were all contained in the list of the 1001 differentially expressed genes (Table S1 ). All investigated genes displayed a significant, moderate to high, positive correlation between the level of transcription and the amount of the corresponding antigen, substantiating the microarray results (Table 3) . (FCGR1, FCGR3, FCER1G) , and complement components 1 (C1) and 3 (C3) . These results strongly support the recent observation of a robust intrathecal production of IgG antibodies by CD138 ϩ plasma cells in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis [45] . Furthermore, a local antibody production seems to be the best explanation for the higher antibody titres in the CNS compared to serum in about one-third of mice 3 weeks after TMEV infection [46] . The relative higher up-regulation of IgG2c compared to IgG1 in the present study could be an indirect hint towards a Th1-type response [40, 47] . Although detectable in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis in vivo, a contribution of anti-MBP antibodies to demyelination is unlikely [48, 49] . In contrast, a monoclonal antibody raised against TMEV was shown to be myelinotoxic due to cross-reaction with galactocerebroside of the myelin sheaths [50, 51] . Antibodies against galactocerebroside were also detected in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis, in vivo.
