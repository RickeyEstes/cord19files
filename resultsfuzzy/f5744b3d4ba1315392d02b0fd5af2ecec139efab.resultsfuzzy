Peptide pool screening of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by IFN-γ ELISPOT Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected 6 months after SARS CoV infection were stimulated in IFN-γ ELISPOT assays with overlapping peptide pools spanning the SARS CoV structural proteins (envelope (E), matrix (M), nucleocapsid (N), and S proteins) (11-12 peptides/pool, peptide concentration = 4 μg/ml). In the PBMC from one recovered SARS patient (SARS patient #1 -HLA-DR03 + 08 + ), there were 17 peptide pools that produced ≥ 25 IFN-γ spot-forming cells (Singh and Raghava, 2001; Rammensee et al., 1999) . Memory CD4 + T-cells directed against this peptide pool were detected by IFN-γ intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), but only after two rounds of in vitro re-stimulation and expansion (individual peptide concentration = 10 μg/ml) (% IFN-γ-producing CD3 + CD4 + T-cells: SARS patient #2 -2.6%, HLA-DR15 + SARS seronegative control -0.06%). Since SARS patient #1 had measurable memory CD4 + T-cell responses ex vivo, we stimulated patient #1 PBMC with 40 different individual peptides taken from the 17 positive pools in an IFN-γ ELISPOT assay (peptide concentrations = 10 μg/ml). We selected the five peptides with the highest IFN-γ SFC frequencies (range 14-21/10 6 PBMC) for further study. These five peptides were all from the viral S protein.
