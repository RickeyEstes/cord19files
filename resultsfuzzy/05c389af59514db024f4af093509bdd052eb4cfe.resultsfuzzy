All 94 serum samples had negative results for antibody against M. bovis. All 8 tracheal swabs and 41 nasal and ear swabs from exposed calves, as well as all 8 tracheal swabs and 37 nasal and ear swabs from control calves were culture negative for Mycoplasma spp. When counting only samples collected 4 wk after first exposure to mycoplasma in bedding, there were 8 tracheal swabs and 30 nasal and ear swabs from exposed calves, and 8 tracheal swabs and 30 nasal and ear swabs from control calves. The latter numbers, only beginning 4 wk after exposure, were used in the probability of detection of true infections calculations described below and shown in Table 1 . For control calves, this was to evaluate the possibility that they may have unintentionally become exposed to mycoplasma at the same time that exposed group calves did by contamination between calf treatment groups despite precautions taken.
