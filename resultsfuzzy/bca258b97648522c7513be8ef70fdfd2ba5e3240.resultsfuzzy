The rainfall time series of the five states and the weekly reported LF cases of the whole of Nigeria are shown in Figure 1 (a) and (b). We observe that the major LF epidemics usually occur in Nigeria between November and May of the following year. The cumulative lagged effects were observed via matching the peak timing of the rainfall and epidemic curves. In Figure 1 (c), we shift the rainfall time series of the five states by + 6 months to match the trends of the national LF epidemic curve in Nigeria. In Figure 1 (d) and (e), we find that the fit has a P-value <0.0001, which indicates a statistically significant association between the LF cases and shifted rainfall curve. We fit four different growth models to the LF confirmed cases and estimate the model-average reproduction number (R) after model selection. We show the growth model fitting results in Figure 4 and the model estimation and selection results in Table 1 . Most of the models have positive partial R-squared against the baseline AR(2) model. Most of the regions exhibit an epidemic turning point (τ) ranging from the epidemiological week (EW) 4-10, i.e. from the end of January to mid-March, in each year. Out of four epidemics in the states of Bauchi and Plateau, there are three estimated τs after EW 10 ( Table 1) Many previous studies adopted the instantaneous reproduction number, commonly denoted by R t , which can be estimated by a renewable equation, to quantify the transmissibility of infectious diseases [21, 23, 24, 37, 38] . The factors that affect the changing dynamics of R t include (i) the depletion of the susceptible population [32] or decrease in the exposure to infectious sources, (ii) the change, usually it is the improvement, in the unmeasurable disease control efforts, e.g. contract tracing, travel restriction, school closure, etc., [39] [40] [41] [42] and local awareness of the epidemic [33] , and (iii) the natural features of the pathogen, e.g. its original infectivity and other interepidemic factors [32, 33, 35] . In this work, we choose to use the average reproduction number (R) rather than R t , as the measurement of the LASV transmissibility. The estimated R summarises the LASV transmissibility over the whole period of an epidemic. The reasons why we prefer R rather than R t are as follows. First, the temporal changes of the susceptible population or decrease in the exposure to infectious sources are removed from the R estimates due to the nature of the growth models. Second, the changes of the susceptible population and/or disease awareness or control measures and the effect of the rainfall cannot be disentangled in the time-varying reproduction number, R t , the average reproduction number (R) adopted is a better proxy to explore the association between LF infectivity and rainfall. With respect to point (iii) and other heterogeneities of epidemics in different regions, we account for this issue by including the 'region' dummy variables in the LMER model in Eqn (3). These dummy variables serve as random effects to offset the regional heterogeneities of LF epidemics. Therefore, we can then quantify a general effect, i.e. the β in Eqn (3), of the lagged rainfall on the LASV R estimate among different Nigerian places. The association between total rainfall in a state and the LASV transmissibility (R) is modelled and quantified by the LMER model. In Figure 5 , we find a positive relation between rainfall and R. The estimated changing rate in R under a one-unit (mm) increase in the average monthly rainfall is summarised with different cumulative lag terms from 4 to 9 months (the t in Eqn (3)). The range of lag in the rainfall from 4 to 9 months had previously been explained by the time interval between the peak of the rainfall and the peak of the rodent population [7] . The estimates of the rainfall-associated changing rate in R with different lag terms were summarised in Table 2 . We report the most significant (i.e. with the lowest P-value) regression estimates that appear with a cumulative lag of 7 months. The habitats of the LASV reservoir, i.e. rodents, include irrigated and flooded agricultural lands that are commonly found in and around African villages [6] . The 7-month lag also coincides with the period between the dry and rainy seasons [43] . The association between rodent population dynamics and rainfall levels has been demonstrated in a number of previous studies [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Hence, we consider the 7-month lagged estimation as our main results. Namely, a one-unit (mm) increase in the average monthly rainfall over the past 7 months is likely to cause a 0.62% (95% CI 0.20%-1.05%) rise in the R of the LF epidemic. We also remark that this 'one-unit (mm) increase in the average monthly rainfall over the past 7 months' is equivalent to '7-unit (mm) increase in the total rainfall over the past 7 months'. The present finding of the impact of lagged rainfall on LF epidemics suggests that the knowledge of such weather-driven epidemics could be gained by referring to past rainfall levels. For instance, if a relatively high amount of rainfall occurs, local measures, such as rodent population control, could be effective to reduce the LF risk. This speculation could also be verified by examining the rodent population data of the Nigerian regions included in this work. The findings in this work are of public health interest and are helpful for policymakers in LF prevention and control. On the one hand, our findings suggest the existence of an association between rainfall and LASV transmissibility, which could be affected by the population dynamics of rodents [13] . On the other hand, the positive relation between rainfall and R indicates that rainfall, particularly in states with a high LF risk, can be translated as a warning signal for LF epidemics. The modelling framework in this study should be easily extended to other infectious diseases.
