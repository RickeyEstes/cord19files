Preparation and Characterization of siRNA−G4NH2 Dendriplexes. siRNA−G4NH2 dendriplexes at different N/P ratios were prepared and characterized with respect to their morphology, size and surface charge according to AFM, SEM and LS. The results are summarized in Table 1 . Details of the characterization for one N/P ratio (N/P = 20), including AFM and SEM micrographs, are shown in Figure 1 . It was observed that the hydrodynamic diameter of the dendriplexes did not vary substantially with the N/P ratio. As measured by LS, the size average of all N/P ratios combined was 257 nm. This value was confirmed by SEM (size average of 258 nm), and since these techniques provide a good representation of the sizes of dendriplexes in solution, they were preferred to the sizes estimated from AFM images (∼100 nm). Discrepancies between the sizes of dendriplexes obtained from LS and AFM images have already been reported, 28 and are likely due to sample preparation. As seen in the literature, 28, 37, 38 the size of dendriplexes usually displays significant heterogeneities, as is the case for polyplexes prepared with other cationic polymers. This heterogeneity has been attributed to the electrostatic and entropic nature of the complexation process. 37 The overall surface charge of the siRNA−G4NH2 dendriplexes were fairly similar, and did not show any specific trend as a function N/P either, with an average value of ∼34 mV, also in agreement with previous studies of dendriplexes with PAMAM dendrimers. 38 Gel Retardation Assay. The ability of G4NH2 to form complexes with siRNA as a function of the N/P ratio was investigated by gel electrophoresis combined with PicoGreen assay. The results are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 2 . The complexation efficiency (CE) of G4NH2 to siRNA is seen to be low (<80%) at N/P < 1. However, almost all siRNA was complexed with the PAMAM G4NH2 dendrimer at N/P ratios >2 (siRNA CE > 95%). These quantitative results assessed by PicoGreen assaymeasuring the uncomplexed siRNA remaining in solution after dendriplex formation, i.e., an indirect method of quantifying the siRNA CEwere confirmed by gel electrophoresis (inset in Figure 2 ). The siRNA band is seen to disappear in the gel as the N/P ratio increases, indicating that the siRNA was largely complexed with the PAMAM G4NH2 dendrimer and, thus, was unable to flow through the pores of the gel (compare lanes 2−11: siRNA− G4NH2 dendriplexes formed at N/P 0.2−30, with lane 1: untreated siRNA control). Therefore, these results reinforce the observation that highly positively charged PAMAM G4NH2 is able to condense siRNA into NPs very efficiently, since very little uncomplexed siRNA was found to be free in the supernatant after the complexation process (N/P > 2). Protection of siRNA by PAMAM G4NH2 against RNase Degradation. siRNA is vulnerable to degradation by RNases, 39 and one of the important potential advantages in using nanocarriers in siRNA therapeutic technologies is the ability to protect this frail cargo. Thus, in order to evaluate the ability of PAMAM G4NH2 to protect siRNA from RNase degradation, siRNA−G4NH2 dendriplexes were formed at several N/P ratios and incubated with the RNase A (the lowest concentration found to digest free siRNA completely −0.162 μg RNase A per 1 μg siRNA − as seen in the SI) for 6 h at 37°C , following RNase inhibitor and heparin treatments, and gel electrophoresis so as to release and quantify the nondegraded siRNA. The results are presented in Figure 3 . PAMAM G4NH2 a Zeta potential (ζ) and siRNA complexation efficiency (CE, indirect measurement) are also shown. LS was performed with dendriplexes at 80 nM siRNA, and in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 (for size) and pure water (for ζ). ImageJ was used to estimate the size of the dendriplexes from the SEM images: histograms of the measured diameters (> 400 particles) were fitted to Gaussian distributions, from which the average size and standard deviation was obtained. is seen to efficiently protect siRNA from RNase A degradation upon complexation. As seen in Figure 3 , for all tested N/P ratios, the siRNA released from the dendriplexes after being kept in contact with RNase A (lanes 3, 7, 11, and 15) was comparable to the siRNA extracted from the dendriplexes which were not exposed to RNase A (lanes 5, 9, 13, and 17positive controls, respectively). Next, siRNA−G4NH2 dendriplexes formed at N/P 5 were incubated with increasing concentrations of RNase A (0.35, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, and 3.5 μg per 1 μg siRNA) for 6 h at 37°C, following RNase inhibitor and heparin treatments, and gel electrophoresis, in order to probe the protection efficiency provided by the dendrimers at increasing RNase A concentrations. The results are shown in Figure 4 and again indicate that the siRNA was sufficiently protected from RNase degradation upon complexation with PAMAM G4NH2. Even at this relatively low N/P ratio (N/P of 5), the siRNA was well protected when kept in contact with very high concentrations of RNase A (3. In Vitro Release of siRNA from PAMAM G4NH2. The siRNA release from the dendriplexes was evaluated in vitro at 37°C , in citrate/phosphate buffer at pHs 7.4 and 5, in order to mimic cytosol and endosomes/lysosomes, respectively. 29 The results are shown in Figure 5 , and indicate that the siRNA in vitro release profile from dendriplexes (N/P 10, 20, and 30) is highly dependent upon the pH. The release is much slower at acidic medium than at physiological pH. At low pHs (<5) all primary and tertiary amines from PAMAM G4NH2 are protonated, 40 and consequently the electrostatic interactions between the positively charged dendrimer and negatively charged siRNA increase, which results in stronger binding and lower siRNA released at low pH. At physiological pH 7.4 the tertiary amines are deprotonated, and only the primary amines are protonated, 40 which decreases the electrostatic interactions between siRNA and G4NH2, and as a result, the release of the siRNA increases at higher pH. This degree of compactness observed at lower pHs is also manifested by the fact that no burst release is observed at pH 5.0. On the other hand, at physiological pH, a burst release was observed after 1−2 days, and it was ∼3.5% or 5.5 pmolbased on the initial loading of siRNA into dendriplexes. After 3−5 days, it was observed that 8−10% siRNA was released from the dendriplexes, which corresponds to 13−16 pmol. The results in Figure 5 show that 48, 24, and 34% of the total siRNA complexed with G4NH2 is released from the dendriplexes at N/P 10, 20, and 30, respectively, after 20 days in citrate/ phosphate buffer pH 7.4 at 37°C. While no literature results are available for the in vitro release of siRNA from PAMAM dendriplexes, we can contrast the results obtained here with the release of oligonucleotide (ON) from PEI polyplexes. 41 At N/P 15 and 40 in PBS pH 7.4 and 37°C, 55% ON was released from PEI after 20 days (i.e., ON was released faster from PEI at N/P 40 than N/P 15), a result somehow similar to that observed here−siRNA released slightly faster from G4NH2 at N/P 30 than N/P 20 in buffer pH 7.4. This is likely due to hydrophilization 41 operated by G4NH2, i.e., dendriplexes formed at higher N/P have increased G4NH2 content, which can contribute for more rapid entry of water molecules into the dendriplexes. Water molecules can penetrate throughout the G4NH2 interior, cause the dendrimer structure to swell (due to the favorable interaction of water molecules with the primary and tertiary amines), 42, 43 and thus release the siRNA. However, the amount of siRNA released from dendriplexes at N/P 30 was statistically significant different from that at N/P 20 at 12 h and day 2 only. Since the in vitro release was conducted with 24 In Vitro Cytotoxicity of PAMAM G4NH2 and siRNA−G4NH2 Dendriplexes. Cationic dendritic polymers, such as polypropyleneimine (PPI), poly-L-lysine (PLL), and PAMAM, may induce significant in vitro cytotoxicity due to the high density of cationic groups on their surface. 44 There are many reports discussing the concentration-and generationdependent toxicity of dendrimers, 13,28,44−46 which is a critical factor to be considered when evaluating the potential of dendrimers as nanocarriers for siRNA delivery. Here, in vitro cytotoxicity studies were performed with A549 cells by incubating them with free PAMAM G4NH2, and siRNA− G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P 30, according to the MTS cell proliferation assay. 31 The cell viability results are shown in Figure 6 . The results presented in Figure 6a indicate that the viability of A549 was >85% when the cells were in contact with PAMAM G4NH2 for 48 h at concentrations up to 5 μM. This result is in agreement with previous literature reporting that the viability of A549 cells was >80% for G4NH2 at low concentrations of 0.7 and 7 μM, as evaluated by MTT cell proliferation assay after 72 h of incubation. 47 Several other works report different cytotoxicity results for PAMAM G4NH2, 45, 46, 48 and thus, the cytotoxicity of G4NH2 is dependent upon concentration, cell type, and incubation time. 49 PAMAM dendrimers are known to be cytotoxic by causing membrane rupture, substantially related to the formation of cavities in the cellular membrane. 49 Toxicity and other dendritic properties (interactions, mechanisms of cellular uptake, and intracellular fate) are most likely governed by the surface groups. 50 The toxic effects of siRNA−G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P 30 (the highest N/P ratio applied in the gene knockdown experiments discussed next) to A549 were also investigated via MTS assay after 72 h of contact of dendriplexes with the cells. The results in Figure 6b indicate that the cytotoxicity of the dendriplexes at N/P 30 was low, even at the highest concentration studied−viability of A549 cells was ∼80% at 25 and 1.25 μM of G4NH2 and siRNA, respectively. In addition, the in vitro viability of A549 cells incubated with siRNA− G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P 30 (72 h) is comparable to that with G4NH2 alone (48 h) at the same G4NH2 concentration, e.g., cell viability of ∼90% (Figure 6a and b) at 0.25 μM G4NH2; and ∼75% and 80% (Figures 6a and b , respectively) at 25 μM G4NH2. Moreover, the in vitro viability of A549 cells after incubation with 5 and 50 μM G4NH2 alone (48 h) was found not statistically significantly different from that with 25/ 1.25 μM G4NH2−siRNA at N/P 30 (72 h) (n = 7, One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey's posthoc test, p value <0.05). These results suggest that siRNA−G4NH2 dendriplexes did not become more toxic than G4NH2 alone. It has been reported in literature that J-774 cells (macrophage-like cell line) showed 90−95% viability after 24 h incubation with siRNA−G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P 10 (0.05 μM siRNA) as measured by MTT assay. 51 Here, at the same 0.05 μM siRNA concentration, A549 cells showed ∼85% viability. This result is interesting since the time of incubation and N/P ratio were both 3-fold higher than that reported in literature. 51 Other work showed that the viability of A549 was reduced to 45% when the cells were incubated with G5NH2/ ON (20 mer and 0.16 μM) dendriplexes at N/P 15 for 4 h, following measure by CellTiter-Blue. 19 Here, at similar 0.125 μM RNA concentration, the viability of A549 cells was ∼80%. Thus, it can be seen that the in vitro cell viability resulting from the delivery of siRNA using PAMAM dendrimers is variable at some extent and depends on several factorse.g., dendrimer surface groups and generation, physicochemical properties of the siRNA−dendrimer dendriplexes, assay, experimental conditions, cell type and passage, and certainly, some interlab variability can be observed as well. The in vitro cytotoxicity results are necessary for the gene knockdown studies. When working in concentration regions of no toxicity, gene knockdown is not confounded with nonspecific toxicity. At the harshest conditions of the in vitro cytotoxicity studies, the cell viability of A549 was still ∼80% after 72 h of incubation with siRNA−G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P 30 containing 25 and 1.25 μM G4NH2 and siRNA, respectively. In contrast, at the harshest condition of the in vitro gene knockdown experiments (discussed next), the A549 cells were incubated for 6 h only, with dendriplexes at N/P 30 containing 1.95 μM and 80 nM G4NH2 and siRNA, respectively. At these G4NH2 and siRNA concentrations, the viability of A549 cells was at least ∼90% (Figure 6b) , and expected to be higher at smaller N/P ratios. It is worthwhile to mention that cellular debris (due to dead or damaged dying cells) was gated out during the FACS analyses to prevent any toxic effects of the G4NH2 alone and/or siRNA−G4NH2 dendriplexes to mask the true gene knockdown. In Vitro Gene Knockdown of siRNA−G4NH2 Dendriplexes. FACS of A549 cells stably expressing eGFP was used to investigate the gene silencing efficiency of siRNA−G4NH2 dendriplexes. Lipofectamine 2000 (LF) and TransFast (TF) were the commercial transfection reagents selected as positive controls. TF is originally designed as a transfection reagent for DNA, 32 but it has shown gene suppression of ∼60−90% when used to deliver siRNA in vitro. 52 Free siRNA was used as the negative control. A549 cells that were not transduced (no eGFP) were used as reference. Cellular debris was gated out during FACS to prevent the small toxicity of the nanocarriers to mask true gene knockdown. Transfection of eGFP stable A549 cells was performed with ds-siRNA targeting eGFP, the positive sequence siRNA(+), and an eGFP-mismatch ds-siRNA, the nonrelevant negative sequence siRNA(−). The results are shown in Figure 7 , and indicate that the gene knockdown efficiency of siRNA(+)−G4NH2 dendriplexes varied from 22 to 37%, and was intermediate between the positive controls (LF at 72% and TF at 70%), and free siRNA(+) (2.8%). The gene silencing efficiency of the eGFP cells treated with the commercial reagents and dendriplexes at N/P 5, 10, 20 and 30, was found to be statistically significantly different from that of eGFP cells treated with free siRNA(+) only. Additionally, no statistically significant difference was found when comparing the eGFP knockdown efficiency as a function of the N/P ratio (minimum n = 3, One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey's posthoc test, p value <0.05). Few reports in literature have investigated the in vitro knockdown efficiency by siRNA or antisense oligonucleotide (AON) delivered via dendriplexes to A549 lung alveolar epithelial cells. Dendrosomes (dendriplexes formed between G5NH2 and AON incorporated into liposomes) have shown suppression of the PKC-α gene expression between ca. 27− 74% at messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels, respectively. 19 Dendriplexes formed between folate−PEG appended to cyclodextrin−G3NH2 conjugates and siRNA have provided luciferase knockdown ranging from ∼15−50%, 3 and up to 80% with siRNA−G7NH2 dendriplexes. 18 Such variability in the in vitro gene silencing efficiency is expected due to the differences in the target gene, assay to assess the knockdown, experimental conditions during transfection (e.g., N/P ratio, treatment times, siRNA and AON concentrations), generation of the PAMAM dendrimer, and presence of other molecules/structures in the carrier. While no gene knockdown result has been reported for siRNA−G4NH2 dendriplexes on A549 cells, we contrast our results with the literature for other cell types. siRNA−G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P 10 caused 12.5 and 22% inhibition of eGFP expression in J-774 (macrophage-like) and T98G (human glioblastoma) cell lines, respectively, 51 and 10% eGFP knockdown in C-166 (mouse yolk sac embryo) cells. 48 Thus, the eGFP silencing efficiency (∼22−37%) obtained with siRNA−G4NH2 dendriplexes on the A549 alveolar epithelial cells is comparable to other cell types and falls within the range reported for other PAMAM-based dendriplexes (with and without the help of other molecules/structures). Despite this low-to-moderate gene silencing in vitro, the proposed siRNA− G4NH2 dendriplexes have the potential to demonstrate gene silencing in vivo (following optimization, but such is not the focus of this work), since PAMAM-based nanocarreirs have shown promising results in the delivering siRNA in vivo, even if the gene silencing efficiency in vivo is lower compared to that observed in vitro. 3, 23, 53 This is due to the siRNA potency, i.e., very small amounts of siRNA (once properly delivered to the target site) are shown sufficient for effective in vivo gene silencing. 54−56 It is worth noticing a reduction in eGFP expression in A549 cells is also observed when the scramble siRNA(−) was delivered using LF (34%), TF (19.5%), and G4NH2 (6−15%): Figure 7 . It has been shown that LF/siRNA(−) complexes cause measurable and undesirable gene silencing ∼25−50% in different cell types. 57, 58 This unwanted eGFP suppression is most likely due to off-target effects, 59 which can be due to toxicity of nanocarrier, 57 and also due to the similarity between the nucleotide sequence from the siRNA(−) and short motifs in mRNA and other unrelated genes not targeted during the transfection. 59, 60 Alterations in gene expression in vitro and in vivo have been also reported for several types of nanocarriers, including linear and branched PEI, 61 PEG−PEI, 61 polypropylenimine (PPI), 62 diaminobutane (DAB). 62 Off-target effects in RNAi are quite common and an issue of consideration when developing RNAi technologies, 60 but may be hard to avoid, 59 and are still not well understood. 61 In Vitro Gene Knockdown of siRNA−G4NH2 Dendriplexes Exposed to Propellant HFA. In order to test whether the biological activity of the siRNA was preserved after the Figure 7 . In vitro knockdown of eGFP expression in A549 cells stably expressing eGFP. siRNA−G4NH2 dendriplexes were prepared with siRNA as received from the supplier at N/P 5, 10, 20, and 30; with lyophilized siRNA stored in HFA-227 (HFA, at 25°C and saturation pressure of the propellant) and freezer at −20°C (FRE, at 253 K) for 2 months, at N/P 20. Specificity of the knockdown (siRNA(+) sequence, anti-eGFP) is maintained by comparison to effects with the siRNA(−) sequence (scramble). Lipofectamine 2000 (LF) and Transfast (TF) were the commercial transfection reagents used as positive controls, and free siRNA was the negative control. G4NH2 concentration at N/P 30 corresponds to 1.95 μM, and siRNA concentration in all systems was 80 nM. *,▼, ⧫ = statistically significantly different compared to eGFP A549 cells treated with free siRNA(+) as received; and ∇ = no statistically significant difference (n.s.d.) among N/P 5, 10, 20, and 30 prepared with siRNA(+) as received (minimum n = 3, One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey's posthoc test, p value <0.05). formulation in the pMDI (under HFA atmosphere), the gene knockdown activity of dendriplexes formed with siRNA(+) that was lyophilized and stored under HFA-227 at 25°C and saturation pressure of the propellant for two months, was compared to a control (lyophilized but stored at −20°C). Gene knockdown experiments were performed on eGFP A549 cells as discussed above, with dendriplexes having an N/P ratio of 20, and the results are shown in Figure 7 . Even after storage conditions in propellant HFA, it can be observed that the siRNA(+) was still biologically active to silence the eGFP expression in A549 cells: ∼69% and 22% eGFP knockdown for TF and dendriplexes at N/P 20, respectively. Similar values were obtained with the control siRNA(+) that was not stored under HFA-227, but at −20°C in freezer (FRE)67% and 22% for TF and N/P 20, respectively. The gene silencing efficiency was found to be statistically significant between the eGFP cells treated with TF/siRNA(+) and dendriplexes at N/P 20−for both storages in HFA and FRE, when compared to cells treated with free siRNA(+) as received. Most importantly, the gene knockdown efficiency provided by dendriplexes at N/P 20 (and TF) prepared with siRNA(+) as received, stored in HFA and FRE, was found not to be statistically significantly different (minimum n = 3, One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey's posthoc test, p value <0.05). Collectively, these results indicate that the biological activity of the siRNA is kept after long-term exposure in propellant HFA. Preparation and Characterization of Microparticles Loaded with Dendriplexes. There are major obstacles in the regional delivery of the dendriplexes to the lungs when using OI devices. While the dendriplexes are in the order of nanometers in size, the optimum aerosol size for deep lung deposition is in the micrometer range (0.5−5 μm). 63 Particles with an aerodynamic diameter <0.5 μm may be exhaled, while those >5 μm tend to be deposited in the mouth and throat, ending up in the digestive tract. Moreover, alveolar macrophages are most selective to particles of 1−3 μm, and less efficient toward larger (≳6 μm) and smaller (≲260 nm) particles. 12 In the case of pMDIs, another hurdle that needs to be overcome is the physical stabilization of the microparticle dispersions (suspension) in the low dielectric propellant HFA. 64, 65 It is necessary, therefore, to develop particle engineering strategies capable of forming stable suspension of the dendriplexes in the form of microparticles suitable for deep lung deposition and able to minimize the uptake by alveolar macrophages. We demonstrate in this work two such strategies. One consists in encapsulating the dendriplexes within mannitol microparticles, via spray drying; the other consists in using a CSLA co-oligomer shell that is formed during emulsification diffusion. Mannitol was chosen as it has high aqueous solubility, it is a generally recognized as a safe (GRAS) excipient widely used as bulking agent and nonactive carrier in dry powder inhalers. 66 Mannitol particles alone also have shown to have less adhesion/cohesion in propellant HFA, slower sedimentation rates, and superior aerosol performance than other sugars, such as lactose. 67 The CSLA co-oligomer was chosen because it is water-soluble and interfacially active at the W/O interface of the emulsion droplets (it migrates/resides at the interface formed between the small water droplets into the large ethyl acetate organic phase). 65 During the emulsification diffusion, the dendriplexes are kept within the water emulsion droplets, and then encapsulated by the CSLA co-oligomer residing at the W/O interface of the emulsion droplets. Thus, the organic phase is not expected to be in contact with the siRNA of the dendriplexes and/or affect somehow the dendriplex aggregates within the CSLA microparticles. In addition, the CSLA cooligomer is degradable and non-HFA soluble−i.e., the shell will not disintegrate in HFA but will break down when in contact with the fluid lining the lungs. 65 The ester groups from the LA are HFA-philic, 64, 68 and microparticles formed with CSLA shell have shown enhanced physical stability in propellant HFAs. 33, 36, 65 An important detail is that the nonactive ingredients used to form these microparticles (mannitol and CSLA) can readily dissolve in aqueous media 65, 66 as the fluid lining the lungs, thus releasing the nanosized dendriplexes, and consequently minimizing the alveolar macrophage uptake. In addition, it is also worthwhile to point out that we have previously shown that CSLA does not impact the gene transfer potential of CSLA-based microparticles as carriers for CS-pDNA complexes. 33 The size and morphology of the CSLA and mannitol microparticles containing siRNA−G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P Figure 8 . Size and morphology of (a) mannitol and (b) CSLA engineered microparticles loaded with siRNA−G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P 10 as determined by LS (main distribution on right) and SEM (lower lef t inset). Particles were dispersed in HPFP (2 mg × mL −1 ) to perform LS, and after that, the HPFP was evaporated, and 1 mL DI-water was added to dissolve the mannitol or CSLA shell, and LS was performed again, but at this time, the size of the dendriplexes released from the mannitol (or CSLA) was measured (upper lef t inset). 10 were evaluated by LS and SEM. The results are shown in Figure 8 . Microparticles were loaded with dendriplexes at N/P 10 instead of N/P 5 and 20 (even though dendriplexes at N/P 5, 10, and 20 resulted in similar in vitro gene knockdown efficiency, as shown in Figure 7 ) because N/P 10 produced slightly smaller and more stable dendriplexes in solution (please refer to Table 1 ) than did N/P 5 and 20. The hydrodynamic diameter of CSLA and mannitol microparticles measured by LS was found to be 2.0 ± 0.8 μm and 4.6 ± 0.9 μm, respectively, as shown in Figure 8 ; average and standard deviation were calculated based on eight (n = 8) independent batches. These results suggest that the spherical dendriplexes carrying microparticles are in the desired size range for appropriate deep lung deposition. 67 It is worthwhile to mention that the size of the dendriplexes at N/P 10 was measured by LS after contacting the microparticles with aqueous solution, and it was found to be 236 ± 75 nm and 192 ± 38 nm for CSLA and mannitol, respectively. Size distribution by LS is shown as inset in Figure  8 ; average and standard deviation calculated based on five (n = 5) independent experiments. Thus, the hydrodynamic diameter of the dendriplexes at N/P 10 released from the shell are readily comparable to those (Table 1 ) before loading into CSLA or mannitol microparticles and are nonstatistically significantly different (n = 5, One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey's posthoc test, p value <0.05). This demonstrates that the process of forming the microparticles does not seem to induce any undesirable irreversible aggregation of the dendriplexes. The siRNA loading efficiency (% siRNA encapsulated into microparticles from the initial content complexed with dendrimers) into CSLA and mannitol microparticles was measured via densitometry using ImageJ, 27 based on the images obtained from gel electrophoresis (insets in Figure 8 ) using the protocol discussed in Experimental Section. The siRNA loading efficiency within the microparticles of 49.0 ± 8.4% was found for CSLA (230 ± 20 ng siRNA per 1 mg CSLA particles), and 25.4 ± 4.0% (229 ± 47 ng siRNA per 1 mg mannitol particles) for mannitol. The final siRNA yield was 65% and 50% (w/w) after emulsification diffusion and spray drying, considering the initial content of CSLA and mannitol, respectively. The integrity of the siRNA after particle preparation was also observed using the same gel images (inset in Figure 8 ). The siRNA bands after particle preparation was found to be very similar (position in the gel) to the untreated siRNA control (compare lanes 1 and 3) . The intensity of the band in lane 3, which corresponds to the siRNA released from microparticles, is weaker due to the fact that less siRNA is added to the gel (see loading efficiency above). Collectively, these results demonstrate the feasibility of encapsulating siRNA-based dendriplexes into CSLA and mannitol microparticles via emulsification diffusion and spray drying processes, respectively. The siRNA was successfully loaded into such microparticles (which showed appropriate size for formulation in pMDIs), it conserved its integrity, and the hydrodynamic diameter of the dendriplexes was kept after particle processing and shell dissolution. Physical Stability of Microparticles Loaded with Dendriplexes in Propellant HFA. Sedimentation rate experiments of the microparticles containing dendriplexes at 25°C and saturation pressure of the propellant were performed in order to evaluate their physical stability in HFA. Microparticles were weighed into pressure proof glass vials, crimp sealed with 63 μL metering valves, and a known volume of propellant HFA-227 was added to make 2 mg × mL −1 . The particles were dispersed with the aid of a sonication bath for 30 min at 15−20°C. Stability of the formulations was determined visually via sedimentation rate/flocculation as a function of the time after stopping the mechanical energy input from the sonication bath. Digital images were taken, and the results are presented as insets in Figure 9 . Dispersions of both CSLA and mannitol microparticles containing siRNA−G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P 10 in propellant HFA-227 showed good physical stability. While some aggregation could be observed on the walls of the canister and in the bulk propellant, no strong flocculation/irreversible aggregation was observed (insets in Figure 9 ). Aggregates formed due to sedimentation could be easily redispersed by simple manual agitation. In the case of CSLA, the improved physical stability compared to dendriplexes alone, which are not dispersible in propellant HFA (see SI) arises due to the enhanced solvation of the ester groups from (LA chains) of CSLA by the propellant HFA. 64, 68 In the case of the mannitol, the reasons for the enhanced stability are less clear, but we expect to have an improved density matching to that of HFA-227 since spherical spray-dried mannitol microparticles produce densities ∼1.47−1.51 g × cm −3 (depending on the spray-drying conditions) 69 and the density of HFA-227 is 1.39 at 25°C. 34 Figure 9 . Aerosol properties of pMDI formulations prepared with siRNA−G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P 10 loaded into (a) mannitol and (b) CSLA microparticles. pMDI formulations at 2 mg particles (mannitol or CSLA) per 1 mL in HFA-227 at 25°C, and saturation pressure of the propellant. siRNA concentration of 290−550 ng × mL −1 for pMDI formulations prepared with mannitol loaded with dendriplexes, and 420−505 ng × mL −1 for those prepared CSLA loaded with dendriplexes. AC, IP, and F refer to actuator, induction port and filter, respectively. Insets: Physical stability of freshly prepared pMDI formulations. Moreover, the fact that the cohesive force for mannitol in HFA is relatively lower compared to other those of other sugars, such as lactose, 67 indicates an enhanced solvation of that surface in the propellant, but this is a relative observation, and no quantitative comparison with the cohesive interaction between CSLA particles and those with mannitol is available. Aerosol Performance of the pMDI Formulations with the Engineered Microparticles. An eight-stage ACI was used to quantify the aerosol properties of the HFA-based formulations containing the mannitol and CSLA engineered microparticles, with siRNA−G4NH2 dendriplexes (N/P 10) loaded within their core. As described earlier, free dendriplexes (negative control, with no mannitol or CSLA shell) did not disperse at all in propellant HFA-227 (the dendriplexes remained stuck onto the walls of the canister, and thus ACI tests could not even be performed). The siRNA content for the microparticle formulations was quantified by incubation of each ACI stage with RNase free DI-water (which broke down the mannitol or CSLA shell, thus releasing the dendriplexes to the aqueous solution) followed by freezing, lyophilization, heparin decomplexation assay (which dissociates the siRNA from the G4NH2), gel electrophoresis, and densitometry using the gel images, as described earlier. A summary of the results is shown in Table 2 , and plotted as % in Figure 9 . The FPF, an important aerosol characteristic that serves as a measure of the therapeutically beneficial portion of the inhaled mass of siRNA which would reach the lower respiratory tract, 70 was determined from the ACI results. The FPF for mannitol and CSLA microparticles was determined to be 49% and 46%, respectively, which is excellent, falling within those of commercial HFA-based pMDIs for small-molecule therapeutics (30−55% on average) 65,71 even though no optimization was attempted in our case. It is worth noticing that FPFs for both formulations were not significantly different (n = 2, One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey's posthoc test, p value <0.05). The respirable fraction (RF) (siRNA content collected from stage 0 to filter over the total siRNA released into the impactor 36 ) was found to be slightly higher for pMDIs formulated with mannitol microparticles (77%) than those with CSLA (64%), but these results were not statistically significantly different from each other (n = 2, One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey's posthoc test, p value <0.05). The MMAD and GSD are properties that characterize the particles in the aerosol spray. MMAD represents the aerodynamic diameter (AD) on a mass basis, and GSD is a measure of the spread of particle size around this median. 72 As seen in Table 2 , the MMAD and GSD of the CSLA and mannitol microparticles loaded with siRNA−G4NH2 dendriplexes were not statistically significantly different from each other: MMAD of 1.9 and 2.6 μm, and GDS of 3.7 and 3.8 on average, respectively (n = 2, One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey's posthoc test, p value <0.05). These results indicate that microparticles from both strategies, mannitol and CSLA, would be able to deliver siRNA to the deep lungs. The MMAD (by ACI) and hydrodynamic diameter (by LS) of CSLA microparticles were similar to each other (1.9 and 2.0 μm on average, respectively), but different for mannitol microparticles (2.6 and 4.6 μm on average, respectively). Differences between aerodynamic and hydrodynamic diameters of particles are somehow expected because the aerodynamic diameter is a property that depends on shape, density, and size (geometric diameter) of the particles. 73, 74 For spherical particles with density of 1, the geometric and aerodynamic diameters should be the same, provided that there is no aggregation. 74 Hydrodynamic diameter is expected to be slightly larger than geometric diameter 75 due to the presence of a solvation layer around the particle. The most significant difference in both strategies came in the form of the total siRNA recovered and the siRNA content in a single puff dose (n = 2, One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey's posthoc test, p value <0.05). While the fraction recovered in the mannitol formulation was only 28%, 85% was recovered in the CSLA formulation. The single puff dose in the mannitol formulation was only 9.5 ng, while that for CSLA engineered microparticles was 26 ng. These results indicate that the strategy of encapsulating siRNA−G4NH2 into CSLA microparticles using the emulsification diffusion technique seems to have greater efficiency for delivering siRNA to the lungs. Collectively, the results shown here indicate that pMDI formulations from both microparticle engineering strategies proposed produce aerosols conducive to deep deposition of siRNA to the lungs. However, in terms of total siRNA recovered and the amount of siRNA actuated from the pMDI, the CSLA strategy displayed a much greater efficiency.
