Vaccination has the potential to interfere with the results of assays that detect the antibody response to infection or assays that detect components of a pathogen itself. Interference with antibody test results can be specific or nonspecific. Nonspecific interference is rarely identified, but results from cross-reactivity between antibodies to vaccine components (such as albumin) and the reagents used in serodiagnostic tests. More commonly, specific interference with serodiagnostic tests for the infection that is targeted by the vaccine occurs. This especially problematic if (1) vaccination does not completely protect against infection, (2) the results of serologic tests are required for diagnosis, and (3) Interference with the results of assays that detect the pathogen itself (as opposed to the antibody response) occurs after vaccination with attenuated live vaccines that are shed by animals after vaccination. For example, cats may test positive using ELISA assays for FPV antigen after vaccination with attenuated live FPV vaccines, although for some assays, the rate at which this occurs is very low. 60 PCR tests can be positive for extended periods after vaccination with attenuated live vaccines. In some cases, sequence analysis of the PCR product can sometimes allow differentiation between vaccine and field strains, but this is currently performed only on a research basis. 61 Rapid PCR assays have also been designed that differentiate between vaccine and field strains of some pathogens, such as CDV or B. bronchiseptica. 62, 63 Quantification of organism numbers present in a specimen through the use of real-time PCR assays (e.g., for CDV) may shed light on whether natural infection (high organism load) or vaccination (low organism load) has occurred.
