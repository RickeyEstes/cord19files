ACE2 expression correlates with permissiveness to SARS-CoV S-driven infection SARS-CoV engages ACE2 for entry into permissive Vero E6 cells [15] ; however, it is unclear if SARS-CoV can use alternative receptors for infection of other target cells. Therefore, we investigated if ACE2 expression correlates with permissiveness to SARS-CoV S-mediated infection. To this end, total RNA from a panel of cell lines of known permissiveness to SARS-CoV S-driven infection was isolated, reverse transcribed, and the ACE2 sequence was amplified by nested PCR (Fig. 1A) . As a control, the GAPDH cDNA was also amplified. In a first round of PCR employing outer primers, GAPDH expression was readily detected in cDNA from all cell lines tested, whereas no signal for ACE2 was observed. In a second round of PCR with inner primers specific for ACE2, amplificates were obtained using cDNA from Huh-7, Hep-2, Vero E6, and 293T cells, which are susceptible to S-driven infection [1, 2, 9, 10] . In contrast, ACE2 sequences were not amplified from cDNA derived from HeLa, HOS, C8166, BL41, and NIH3T3 cell lines, which are largely refractory to S-mediated infection [9] [10] [11] . Thus, ACE2 expression in cell lines correlates with susceptibility to SARS-CoV S-driven infection, indicating that ACE2 plays an important role in SARS-CoV replication. We next analyzed if high amounts of ACE2 can augment infection of permissive cells by lentiviral pseudotypes harboring SARS-CoV S as described previously [9] [10] [11] . Plasmids encoding ACE2 and CD13, the receptor for human CoV 229E [14] , were transiently transfected into 293T cells followed by infection with pseudotypes harboring S. Both ACE2 and CD13 were efficiently expressed on the cell surface ( Fig. 3B and data not shown); however, only expression of ACE2 but not of CD13 enhanced S-driven infection compared to infection of control cells, confirming the specific interaction of SARS-CoV S with ACE2 (Fig. 1B) .
