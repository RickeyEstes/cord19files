Viral diagnostics has become an integral part of clinical management, with most results available within hours or a few days, rather than in weeks, as in the past. Each laboratory must select from an extensive and growing armamentarium of tests which tests to offer on site, based on the patient populations it serves, the need for rapid results, and the facilities, equipment, and expertise available. The prominent role of conventional culture, long the gold standard, is declining. Rapid cultures have a more limited menu, but provide results in a clinically useful timeframe. Rapid antigen tests have allowed testing for influenza and RSV at hospitals and clinics without virology laboratories, and results can be available within minutes at the point of care. Although sensitivity of rapid tests is suboptimal, especially for viruses with antigen variability, in young children who shed high titers of virus their impact on reducing unnecessary antibiotics and other testing has been documented (Bonner et al., 2003) . DFA staining of clinical samples has enjoyed wider application in the past 20 years, from herpetic skin lesions, to respiratory viruses and CMV viral load in blood, due to high-quality commercial MAbs, pooled antibody reagents for multiplex screening of specimens, and the use of multiple fluorophore labels to differentiate antibodies. DFA is a very valuable method when done well, due to its relative speed, multiplex capability, and greater sensitivity compared to other rapid antigen tests. Indeed, a single positive cell can be detected. DFA has also been shown to improve care and reduce costs (Barenfanger et al., 2000) . However, DFA requires a fluorescence microscope, extensive experience and judgment to differentiate specific from non-specific staining, attention to detail, and continual monitoring compared to culture or PCR to maintain quality. It is also manual, and all of these factors limit its availability.
