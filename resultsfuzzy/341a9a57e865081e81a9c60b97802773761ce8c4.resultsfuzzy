We demonstrate the advantage of our triplet estimator through analysis of influenza A-H3N2/B subtype divergence using the hemagglutinin (HA), matrix protein (MP) and non-structural (NS) genes. Each analysis is performed on 60 gene sequences constructed from 20 genomes each drawn from influenza subtypes A-H3N2, B and C. We download these data along with their dates of sampling from the Los Alamos Influenza Database [16] . We perform sequence alignment using ClustalX [24, version 1.8]. For consistency with previous studies of A-H3N2 HA evolution, we use the HKY model of nucleotide substitution [10] . We use the TREBLE algorithm, which implements a MCA, on sets of sequences solely drawn from a single subtype to derive within-subtype rates. The phylogenetic tree, generated by TREBLE, for the HA gene is depicted in Figure 2 (± 0.48) × 10 -3 s/s/yr and the subtype C rate is 1.31 (± 0.33) × 10 -3 s/s/yr. Lastly, for the NS gene, the rates are similar to those of the MP gene. The subtype A-H3N2 rate is 2.14 (± 0.25) × 10 -3 s/s/yr, the subtype B rate is 1.92 (± 0.20) × 10 -3 s/s/yr, and the subtype C rate is 1.68 (± 0.51) × 10 -3 s/s/yr. Table 1 presents these results. Figure 3 provides histograms of the bootstrap distributions for all three genes and subtypes. Assuming a molecular clock within a subtype and with the rates above, we generated the corresponding dates of the TMCRA. Figure 3 shows histograms of the TMRCA estimates for different genes and subtypes. All genes are similar in dating the TMRCA for A-H3N2 to approximately 1965 (1964, 1965, and 1962 for HA, MP and NS genes, respectively). These dates are consistent with the emergence of the A-H3N2 subtype into global circulation dur-ing the 1968 pandemic [1] . Both the MP and NS genes date the TMRCA of subtype B to 1943, while the HA rate places the TMRCA at 1953. This latter value is inconsistent with the influenza B sub-epidemics of 1950-51 but is consistent with the emergence of the more lethal Victoria strain of influenza B in 1953 [11] . Each of these estimates has a standard error of approximately 2 years and so these discrepancies may be accounted by measurement uncertainty. The 10 year gap between the TMCRA suggested by the different genes can be explained by a reassortment event. Finally, the TMRCA of subtype C is calculated as 1952 and 1953 by the MP and NS genes, respectively, while the HA gene places the TMCRA at 1906. This nearly half century discrepancy suggests that the subtype C HA gene experienced a markedly different evolutionary history than either the MP or the NS gene. A biologically plausible explanation would be a reassortment event. Another possible explanation is that non-MCA rate behavior has lead to substantial bias in dating the TMRCA. We now compare the results from pairwise rate estimates across subtypes A-H3N2 and B with those from application of the MCA to the same data. These results are summarized in Table 2 and Histograms of the time of most recent common ancestor for subtypes A-H3N2, B and C, respectively, derived from molecular clock estimates on hemagglutinin (HA), matrix (MP) and nonstructural (NS) gene sequences This discrepancy between the two sets of estimates of the TMRCA likely owes to the inability of the MCA to integrate information from the period of evolution between the two subtypes, leading to a substantial underestimate of the rate of substitution, and consequent underestimation of the date of the TMRCA.
