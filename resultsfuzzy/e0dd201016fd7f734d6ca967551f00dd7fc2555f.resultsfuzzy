We found these inhibitors resulted in efficient suppression of HCV replication and autophagy. We then attempted to clarify which of the three UPR-autophagy pathways might be most closely involved in the activation of autophagy by investigating the effects of combined use of the Salubrinal, 3-E-5, 6-D and sp600125 on the rate of HCV replication using the OR6 assay system. Salubrinal inhibited phasphorylated eIF2-alpha, LC3-II and HCV core protein, but not inhibited spliced XBP1 and phasphorylated JNK. 3-E-5, 6-D and sp600125 inhibited phasphorylated JNK, spliced XBP1, LC3-II and HCV core protein, but not inhibited phasphorylated eIF2-alpha. Combined treatment with three inhibitors of Salubrinal, 3-E-5, 6-D and sp600125 strongly enhanced the inhibition of both HCV replication and autophagy. These results indicated that combined use of the inhibitors was more effective than use of any of the inhibitors alone in suppressing HCV replication and autophagy (Fig. 4) . In addition, the concentrations of each of the inhibitors used in combination did not affect the cell viability rate (Fig. 4) . Thus, in regard to the efficacy of inhibition for HCV replication and autophagy, combined use of 3-E-5, 6-D and sp600125 appears to be the most efficient as compared to use of other combinations.
