One-hundred and fifty respiratory pathogens were identified from 100 (68%) patients. The microbiological methods by which pathogens were identified are described in Table 2 . Final conclusions regarding the CAP etiology are summarised in Tables 3 and 4. A single causative agent was found in 58 (39%) patients, of which 33 (22%) were viruses and 25 (17%) were bacteria. Polymicrobial infection was found in 42 (28%) patients, including viral infections with superimposed bacterial infection, tuberculosis with superimposed secondary infection, and other mixed-infections (multiple viruses, multiple bacteria, and combinations of virus(es) and bacteria) ( Table 3) . Seventy viruses were identified in 67 (45%) patients, with influenza A as commonest, identified in 20 (13.5%) patients. PCR detected 16 (80%) cases, while serology detected 10 (50%) cases ( Table 2 ). All influenza A viruses were H3N2. In 12 patients it was the single pathogen found (Table 3 ); in eight patients other pathogens were also involved (Table 4 ). Together, influenza A and B viruses caused 26 (18%) cases of CAP in our cohort either as single or as co-pathogen. The second commonest virus was rhinovirus, which in all 13 (9%) cases were detected by PCR. In six patients this virus was the single pathogen; in seven it was a co-pathogen. Parainfluenza virus was the third commonest virus, detected in 11 (7%) patients, mostly by PCR; five episodes as single pathogen and six as copathogen. Other viruses found were HcoV OC43, adenovirus, hMPV, and RSV; most were as co-pathogens, and detected by PCR. Eighty bacteria were found in 65 (44%) patients, with Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. pneumoniae as the most frequently diagnosed. K. pneumoniae was isolated from 21 (14%) patients; most (95%) from sputum cultures, and 5% from both blood and sputum cultures. S. pneumoniae was diagnosed in 20 (13%) patients, mostly (75%) by urinary antigen tests ( Table 2) . C. pneumoniae and M. tuberculosis were the third commonest bacterial species identified; each was diagnosed in 5% of patients. Other GNB (Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, and Burkholderia cepacia) were identified in 7 (5%) patients; most were isolated from sputum cultures. Burkholderia pseudomallei was not found. Blood cultures were positive only in 4 (2%) patients. Combinations of pathogens in 42 patients are presented in Table 4 . Frequent combinations of pathogens were K. pneumoniae + S. pneumoniae (n=5), adenovirus + K. pneumoniae (n=4), and influenza or coronavirus + S. pneumoniae (n=3 each). The etiology of CAP could not be elucidated in 48 (32%) patients. Pathogen detection was, predictably, related to the availability of diagnostic specimens. Out of 48 cases with unknown etiology, only one patient had complete laboratory specimens from which all tests results were negative. The other 47 had incomplete laboratory specimens; 46 of them had no positive results, and one had so many positive serology results that no conclusion could be drawn. Patients with severe disease (PSI class IV-V) were less likely to receive an etiological diagnosis compared to those with non-severe disease (PSI class I-III, P=0.01). One isolate of K. pneumoniae was an ESBL-producer, while the others were susceptible to antibiotics except to piperacillin (81% resistant) and nitrofurantoin (76% resistant). Of four regrowable S. pneumoniae, all were susceptible to penicillin, erythromycin, and vancomycin; one was intermediately resistant to co-trimoxazol, and three were resistant to tetracyclin.
