Three different HLA-A2 healthy donors PBMC were tested in cultures designed to prime and expand T cells specific to the HPV 18 E6 NLLIRCLRC peptide. At day 21, after three rounds of peptide stimulation, the T cell clones were collected and tested for cross reactivity by their ability to recognize and react to the corresponding HPV 11 E6 peptide. As shown in Fig. 2 , T cells primed with the HPV 18 E6 peptide demonstrate cross reactive properties in 3/3 donors by responding to the HPV 11 E6 peptide. The magnitudes of responses to the HPV 11 E6 KVLIRCYLC peptide in all three cases were similar to or greater than the responses detected to the HPV 18 E6 priming peptide (Fig. 2) . These results demonstrate that T cells specific for the HPV 18 peptide NLLIRCLRC are able to crossreact to the corresponding HPV11 peptide KVLIRCYLC.
