Cocrystal Structure of the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD with AMP. We were unable to find any previous reports describing the atomic structure of CoV N protein−RNA complexes. To begin to elucidate how RNA and the N protein interact, we determined the crystal structure of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexed with AMP. The complete statistics for the data collection and refinement of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexed with AMP are summarized in Table 1 . The complex contained one ribonucleoside 5′-monophosphate-binding site alongside two β strands (β2 and β3) ( Figure 1A ). As with apo HCoV-OC43 N-NTD, the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexes all contain a core located within amino acids 105−120 that comprises five β strands, one α helix, and a disordered loop that extends away from the core. The flexible loop region lies between β2 and β3 (residues 115−117) and exhibits a low electron density in the initial 2F o −F c map. The AMP base was inserted into a hole in the N-NTD that was almost perpendicular to the phosphate moiety ( Figure 1B ,C). The phosphate group was bound to a basic and conserved 5′phosphate-binding site that contained the largest positively charged region on the N-NTD surface. The HCoV-OC43 N-NTD has the same folding pattern as is found in the SARS-CoV, IBV, and MHV N-NTD; 20 however, the positions of the secondary structural elements and loops vary between the species. AMP binding to the N-NTD is clearly unambiguously defined in the resulting electron density maps provided in Figure 2A . AMP shows a temperature factor of about 20 Å 2 , compared with an average overall temperature factor of around 35 Å 2 . Figure 2B monophosphate with a distance of 3.8 Å, whereas the Gly 68 backbone forms hydrogen bonds with the monophosphate group in the AMP with a distance of 2.4 Å. Additionally, the carbonyl oxygen and amide nitrogen of the Ser 64 backbone form hydrogen bonds with the ribose 2′-hydroxyl substituents and N7 of the base with distances of 3.0 and 2.7 Å, respectively. Tyr 124 is located on the surface of the N protein in the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD and is directly involved in the interactions with the AMP base through π−π stacking. The phenolic hydroxyl group substituent on Tyr 126 forms hydrogen bonds with the sixth amino groups present in the AMP adenine ring with a distance of 3.1 Å. Hydrogen bonds also form between the 2′-hydroxyl group of the AMP ribose and the Arg 164 side chain. The Arg 122, Tyr 124, Tyr 126, and Arg 164 side chains generate a distinct ribonucleotide-binding pocket and interact with the ribonucleoside 5′-monophosphate via hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, and π−π stacking forces ( Figure 2C ). These amino acids are sequentially and structurally conserved in other HCoV N proteins ( Figure S2 , Supporting Information); therefore, they are likely essential for RNA recognition and interaction in all coronavirus N proteins. In addition, the structure of the N-NTD in the AMP cocomplex is essentially identical to the previously published structure of apo HCoV-OC43 N-NTD with a root-meansquare deviation (RMSD) value of 0.19 Å (123 equivalent Cα atoms) ( Figure 2D ). Only the phenyl group of F57 is displaced backward by 1 Å to prevent steric hindrance at the AMP entrance. We solved the structures of three additional HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexes (cytosine monophosphate (CMP), guanosine monophosphate (GMP), and uridine monophosphate (UMP)), all featured protein−RNA interactions similar to the interaction of the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD−AMP complex. See Figure S3 in the Supporting Information. A comparison of the amino acid composition of ribonucleoside 5′-monophosphate-binding sites in the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexes ( Figure S3D ) shows that amino acid residues Ser 64, Phe 66, Gly 68, Arg 122, Tyr 124, Tyr 126, and Arg 164 are interactive in more than two HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complex structures, indicating their importance in RNA binding. Compared to AMP, the higher B-factors of CMP, GMP, and UMP indicate the ligand for CMP, GMP, and UMP is quite flexible in the ribonucleotide-binding pocket of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD (Table 1; Table S1 , Supporting Information). On the basis of the electron density maps of similar resolution data, it appeared that the structure of the AMP complex showed better defined electron density for all components of the nucleotide ( Figure 2A ). These results suggest that this pocket is probably specific for AMP. More studies are needed to prove this in the future. RNA-Binding Activity Analyses of Wild-Type and Mutant HCoV-OC43 N Proteins. We replaced amino acid residues Arg 122, Tyr 124, Tyr 126, and Arg 164 with alanine and used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis to determine their interactions in the binding between the fulllength HCoV-OC43 NPs and RNA. Depending on the virus strain, there are two to four UCUAA pentanucleotide repeats, with the last repeat being UCUAAAC and termed the intergenic (IG) sequence at the 3′ end of the leader. 29, 30 Previous studies showed that HCoV N protein has high affinity for the intergenic sequence. 11, 31 Therefore, the repeated intergenic sequence of HCoV-OC43, 5′-bio(UCUAAAC) 4 -3′, was used as a probe in our SPR experiments. The association constants, K d (k d /k a ), for the various HCoV-OC43 N protein and RNA complexes were obtained from kinetic analyses of SPR experiments ( Table 2 ). The dissociation constants for RNA binding to R122A, Y124A, Y126A, and R164A range from 3.83 × 10 −8 to 8.13 × 10 −8 M and are much larger than those for the wild type (WT). Thus, we identified several amino acids in the HCoV-OC43 N protein that are important for RNA binding, especially R122, Y124, and R164. Previously, Keane et al. reported that R127 and Y127 in MHV, which correspond to R122 and Y124 in HCoV-OC43, play key roles in RNA binding. 23, 26, 27 In addition, the alanine substitution of Y94 in the NTD of the IBV N protein, which corresponds to Y126 in HCoV-OC43, led to a significant decrease in its RNA-binding affinity. These results are consistent with our observations. Since R122A, Y124A, and R164A mutants have significant effects on the RNA-binding activity of the N protein, we monitored levels of viral RNA encoding the M protein to determine the effects of R122A, Y124A, and R164A mutants on the viral replication. Because all OC43 genes are transcribed concordantly throughout HCoV-OC43 infection, levels of the M protein gene should reflect virus replication. Therefore, 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the mutant N protein and its WT counterpart followed by infection with HCoV-OC43. As shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information), in cells transfected with plasmids encoding the mutant N protein and infected with virus, levels of M RNA were significantly decreased compared to those detected in cells transfected with plasmids encoding the WT N protein. These results support the notion that these amino acids of HCoV-OC43 are important for RNA-binding affinity. Effect of PJ34 on Virus Replication and the RNA-Binding Affinity of the N Protein. Next, a virtual screening was performed, targeting the AMP-binding site of N-NTD. Potential hits with high docking scores (87 compounds) ( Table  S2 , Supporting Information) were further analyzed on the basis of these docking results. We found that nine of the potential hits showed interaction characteristics reminiscent of those between AMP and HCoV-OC43 N-NTD (Table S3 , Supporting Information). First, they all contain an aromatic core able to stack onto Y124 of the N-NTD. Second, the aromatic core contains hydrogen-bond-forming moieties to mediate the specific interactions with the N-NTD. Third, the aromatic core contains an attached branching moiety (or moieties) to fit into the ribonucleotide-binding pocket. More importantly, among the 87 potential hits, these 9 compounds were readily available commercially. We further studied the effects of the nine compounds on the RNA-binding capacity of N protein by SPR experiments. Two compounds, O3 and PJ34, decreased the RNA-binding capacity of N protein by more than 10% (Table S3) . Because PJ34 and O3 were predicted to bind to the N-NTD ribonucleotide-binding pocket, we next studied PJ34 and O3 in virus replication assays. To enhance virus replication, we transfected N cDNA into cells prior to infection because previous results showed that increased N protein expression enhanced replication. 20 In general, a 10 μM concentration of each candidate compound was used in subsequent assays. If the candidate compound at this concentration was effective, we considered the compound worthy of continued development. We monitored M mRNA levels in infected 293T cells in the presence of PJ34 and O3 at 10 μM both with and without exogenous N protein expression. Because the M gene is transcribed throughout the HCoV-OC43 infection, M mRNA levels should reflect viral replication. As predicted from previous studies, M mRNA levels were increased 7-fold in infected cells transfected with plasmid that encodes the WT N protein compared to those that did not receive transfected N cDNA (2.41 and 0.32 in the presence and absence of N protein expression, respectively) ( Figure 3A treatment with PJ34 at 10 μM ( Figure 3A ,B), whereas O3 treatment was not effective. PJ34 has been shown to have therapeutic efficacy in several noninfectious conditions. In one instance, PJ34 treatment reduced central nervous system inflammation and maintained neurovascular integrity in mice during the onset of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. 32 This compound also exhibited neuroprotective effects in both in vivo and in vitro stroke models. 33 To determine whether PJ34 hindered the HCoV-OC43 replication by interfering with the binding of the N protein to RNA, we used SPR to determine the effect of compound PJ34 on the RNA-binding affinity toward HCoV-OC43 N protein. In the presence of PJ34 under saturation conditions, RNA affinity for HCoV-OC43 NP decreased with decreasing resonance unit (RU) values for PJ34 ( Figure 3C ). The HCoV-OC43 N protein exhibited weaker RNA binding in the presence of PJ34 with a 5-fold increase in the dissociation constant ( Figure 3D ). Therefore, PJ34 antagonizes the binding activity between HCoV-OC43 N protein and RNA. Consequently, the data indicate that PJ34 interacts with the HCoV-OC43 N protein, decreasing RNA binding and subsequently decreasing viral replication. Crystal Structure of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD Complexed with PJ34. To determine the mechanism of PJ34 ( Figure 4A ) binding to the HCoV-OC43 N protein, N-NTD crystals were soaked in PJ34 under the conditions described in the Experimental Section. We used molecular replacement to resolve the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD−PJ34 complex structure at a 2.65 Å resolution and refined this model to an R work :R free ratio of 18%:22% (Table 1 ). The complex revealed additional unbiased density around the ribonucleotide-binding pocket of the N-NTD, suggesting that the affinity of N-NTD for PJ34 was sufficiently high to inhibit the RNA-binding affinity of N protein ( Figure 4B ). As with the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD−AMP complex, one PJ34-binding site was noted near the β2 and β3 strands ( Figure 4C ). The complex adopted a U-shaped β platform that contained five β strands across the structure and resembled the N protein NTDs in other CoVs. 23−26 On the basis of the surface charge distribution, the polycyclic ring of PJ34 intercalates into the N-NTD hole parallel to the long axis of the protein structure ( Figure 4D ). Parts A and B of Figure 5 reveal the detailed interactions with PJ34. The amino acid composition of this binding site includes Ser 64, Phe 66, Tyr 124, Tyr 126, and His 104. The NH functionalities from the backbone amide groups on Ser 64 are 3.3 Å from the carbonyl group on the PJ34 6-phenanthridinone ring, indicating that a hydrogen bond may form between Ser 64 and PJ34. Hydrogen bonds also form between the 6phenanthridinone ring and the backbone carbonyl group of Phe 66 via water molecules. The nitrogen atom in the PJ34 6phenanthridinone ring also forms a single hydrogen bond with the Tyr 126 side chain of the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD with a distance of 2.9 Å. The aromatic ring on the PJ34 6phenanthridinone participates in stacking interactions with the His 104 and Tyr 124 side chains. A comparison between the N-NTD in both its native and PJ34-complexed forms generated a low RMSD of 0.20 Å, indicating that binding with PJ34 requires no significant conformational change in the N-NTD ( Figure 5C ). The key PJ34-interactive residues of the native and complexed forms superimpose well; however, the phenyl group on the Phe 57 side chain in the N-NTD−PJ34 complex rotates over 90°, and the imidazole side group of His 104 moves back 0.8 Å to avoid steric hindrances and to accommodate PJ34. Comparison of Crystal Structures of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD Complexed with PJ34 and AMP. Comparison of the PJ34-and AMP-bound HCoV-OC43 N-NTD crystal structures demonstrates that PJ34 and AMP target the same pocket within HCoV-OC43 N-NTD. Although the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD− PJ34 and HCoV-OC43 N-NTD−AMP crystal structures superimpose with a low RMSD of 0.21 Å, the PJ34-binding orientation differs from that of AMP. PJ34 binds more closely to the N-terminus loop of the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD than does AMP, with the Phe 57 side chain rotating 90°counterclockwise upon PJ34 binding, compared to that of the AMP-bound HCoV-OC43 N-NTD. The branch moiety of PJ34 inserts into an interior core of N-NTD that is opposite the ribose moiety of AMP coming from the inside out. PJ34 also lacks a phosphate group and fails to match AMP's interactions with the positively charged Arg 122 ( Figure S5, Supporting Information) . Nevertheless, several of the examined interactions between the N-NTD and PJ34 were similar to those between N-NTD and AMP, particularly those with Ser 64, Tyr 124, and Tyr 126 ( Figures 2C and 5B ).
