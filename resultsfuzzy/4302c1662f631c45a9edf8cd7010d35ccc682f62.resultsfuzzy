Jean-Francois Rossignol, Romark Laboratories, Florida, USA. Nitazoxanide has been approved for treatment of diarrhoea associated with Giardia and Cryptosporidium infections. It has been used in more than 75 million patients in the USA and Latin America alone, hence has a known safety profile. It is an orally available, small MW drug, with what appears to be broad antiviral activity, including against influenza, PIV and RSV. Nitazoxanide appears to block the maturation of the influenza virus HA (Rossignol, 2014) . In a phase 2b/3 trial in 2010e11, comparing 300 mge600 mg twice daily in 624 patients, only treatment with 600 mg twice daily for 5 days was associated with a reduction in the duration of symptoms, and a 1 log 10 decrease in virus titer, in recipients with acute uncomplicated influenza (Haffizulla et al., 2014) . Nitazoxanide has also shown synergistic effects in vitro with NAIs (Belardo et al., 2015) . In a current Phase III trial, 600 mg of nitazoxanide is being compared to nitazoxanide plus oseltamivir, oseltamivir, or placebo.
