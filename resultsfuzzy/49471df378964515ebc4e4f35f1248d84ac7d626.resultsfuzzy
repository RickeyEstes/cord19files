Using a human airway cell culture model, we sought to understand which specific signaling events would be determinant components of the host response to MERS-CoV infection. We took a genomics-based approach and assessed the whole transcriptome by microarray analysis to 1) topologically characterize the kinetic and magnitudinal changes in the host response elicited by MERS-CoV Eng 1 and MERS-CoV SA 1 and 2) identify contrasting genes between the two viruses related to innate and proinflammatory signal stimulation. Utilizing cytokine treatment transcriptomic data sets derived from the same model system, we pursued cytokine signaling events in MERS-CoV-infected Calu-3 cells driving statistically significant contrasting gene expression observed between MERS-CoV Eng 1 and MERS-CoV SA 1. On the basis of the viruscontrasting genes, we predicted STAT3 as a regulator of MERS-CoV-induced host responses, with strain-specific differences in STAT3-mediated gene expression. Topological characterization of the host response shows spatio-temporal transcriptomic differences between MERS-CoV strains Human Calu-3 2B4 cells were infected with one of two different MERS-CoV strains, MERS-CoV SA 1 or MERS-CoV Eng 1, or with icSARS-CoV, and cell lysates were harvested throughout the infection course for microarray analysis. We first characterized topological differences of the whole transcriptome on Euclidean metric space for the collection of 93 samples (mock, MERS-CoV SA 1, MERS-CoV Eng 1 and icSARS-CoV) using recent methods from computational topology, including persistence homology [15, 16] . Many data reduction methods rely on embedding high-dimensional data into two dimensions. Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), for example, calculates coordinates for a 2-dimensional embedding of the experimental data by minimizing the deviation between embedded and original data (Kruskal stress). Persistence homology, on the other hand, performs computation of topological invariants in the dimension of the original dataset and is, unlike MDS, more stable under perturbation. To assess global kinetic dissimilarities across different CoV infections, we calculated topological differences between MERS-CoV SA 1, MERS-CoV Eng 1 and icSARS-CoV, each grouped throughout all time points and with data set-matched mock samples. The kinetics of the host response refers to the spread of infected samples relative to mock samples over time. There were large topological differences between MERS-CoV Eng 1 and icSARS-CoV (score: 2.42), and between MERS-CoV SA 1 and icSARS-CoV (score: 2.18), and moderate differences between MERS-CoV Eng 1 and MERS-CoV SA 1 (score: 0.29) (Methods and Table 1) . To further assess the magnitude impact of MERS-CoV infection in Calu-3 2B4 cells, we integrated viral genomic RNA levels into a topological assessment of host response differences. MERS-CoV genomic RNA was measured by qRT-PCR using primer (KL200F) located in the leader region (nt 9-28) and primer (KL201) located in the ORF1 region of the CoV genome ( Figure 1A and Additional file 1: Table S5 ). Additionally, we measured viral titers by plaque assay and found MERS-CoV SA 1 had more robust infectious viral particle production than MERS-CoV Eng 1, with significantly different viral titers at 18 and 24 hpi, despite similar viral genomic RNA levels at these late time points (Additional file 2: Table S4 ). In measuring viral genomic RNA and infectious viral particle production, we assessed two different stages in the viral life cycle and the data support differences in the kinetics of replication for the two MERS-CoV strains. Since our analysis focuses on the host response to infection and its origin in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immune responses, we computationally integrated viral genomic RNA with host mRNA to better assess the differences in host response kinetics. Towards this end, we used a filtered clustering method [17] that reduced the space of 93 samples to a clustering graph of 18 nodes. First, the viral genomic RNA levels were used as a filter to bin the samples into overlapping subsets with similar viral load (i.e., viral gRNA). Second, within each subset, samples that showed a high degree of interconnection were retained. Thus, there was high similarity in gene expression levels within each subset. For a graphical representation, each set of retained samples formed a node and nodes were considered as adjacent whenever they had at least one sample in common (Methods and Figure 1B Taken together, these whole transcriptome topological analyses showed robust differences in both kinetics and magnitude of the host response between MERS-CoV SA 1 and MERS-CoV Eng 1, despite similar viral replication. Another example where viral replication may not be the best readout of host response differences is icSARS-CoV. The deletion of the entire ORF6 gene of icSARS-CoV (icSARS-CoV ΔORF6) does not impact viral replication compared to wild-type icSARS-CoV, yet substantial differences in the host response between the two viruses are detected in Calu-3 2B4 cells [18] . Table S5 ). The error bars represent the standard deviation among triplicate samples. B. Clustering graph for samples according to their Euclidean distances in gene expression obtained by an integration of viral genomic RNA levels. Samples with similar viral genomic RNA levels were grouped together. Using statistical criteria on the single linkage heights between all samples, we extracted the highly interconnected part (with smaller linkage heights). These samples were compared to highly interconnected samples of a second group of samples with overlapping viral genomic RNA levels of the first group and so forth. Whenever two highly interconnected parts had at least one sample in common we defined the two groups as adjacent. In the clustering graph, adjacent sample groups are linked by an edge, the node color represents the average viral genomic RNA levels of each sample group. Edge length or distance between nodes in the graph does not recapitulate spatial closeness of samples. contrasting genes). In comparison to MERS-CoV SA 1, there was an earlier host response to MERS-CoV Eng 1 at 7 and 12 hpi. The accelerated Calu-3 response to MERS-CoV Eng 1 may be the result of the difference in kinetics of viral gRNA replication, with MERS-CoV Eng 1 more efficiently replicating at 3 and 7 hpi compared to MERS-CoV SA 1 ( Figure 1A) . Alternatively, the delay in the host response to MERS-CoV SA 1 may be due to the virus more efficiently evading innate immune responses that leads to enhanced viral replication compared to MERS-CoV Eng 1 (Additional file 2: Table S4 ). Between the two viruses there are amino acid differences in ORF4a and PLpro, viral proteins known to modulate the innate immune response during MERS infection [5] [6] [7] . We further examined host gene expression at the early time-points (3, 7 and 12 hpi) and found significant enrichment of genes associated with the STAT3 pathway. STAT3 pathway genes CDC25A, MYC, SOCS3 and SOCS4 were more strongly induced by MERS-CoV Eng 1 compared to MERS-CoV SA 1, particularly at 7 hpi ( Figure 3B ). Increased SOCS gene expression and decreased expression of PIM1 gene in response to MERS-CoV Eng1 indicated decreased STAT3 activity and possibly differential induction of apoptosis-related pathways. In a direct virus comparison, differential expression of pro-apoptotic BID, BAX, and BIM genes was observed at the early time-points and by 24 hpi there was extensive cytopathic effects caused by both viral infections that was likely the result of caspasedependent apoptosis, as previously shown for MERS infection [20] . Of the 4861 contrasting genes, 2653 genes were also DE against time-and data set-matched mocks. Hierarchical clustering of the 4861 DE genes resulted in distinct gene clusters, with striking expression pattern contrasts between MERS-CoV SA 1 and MERS-CoV Eng 1 at 18 and 24 hpi. As shown in Table 2 , functional analysis of the five most prominent clusters with contrasting gene expression revealed enrichment of integrin linked kinase (ILK) signaling and epithelial adherens junction signaling pathways, glutathione metabolism, and interferon and pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Genes related to glutathione metabolism included GSTM1 and GSTM3, which were strongly downregulated in response to both viruses. ISGs, IFIT1 and IFIT3, were highly induced in response to both MERS-CoV Eng 1 and MERS-CoV SA 1, with pronounced early up-regulation specifically in response to MERS-CoV Eng 1. Genes associated with ILK signaling and epithelial adherens junction signaling pathways were strongly downregulated in response to MERS-CoV SA 1, whereas MERS-CoV Eng 1 predominantly up-regulated expression of these genes at the late time points (Additional file 3: Figure S1 ). Within the highly enriched pathways, cellular genes including PVRL1, RHOF and CREBBP with highest expression contrasts between the two infections were chosen for confirmation by qRT-PCR (Additional file 4: Figure S2 ). Pro-inflammatory CSF3 gene was found more highly induced by MERS-CoV SA 1 (log ratios in MERS-CoV SA1 and MERS-CoV Eng1 respectively: 2.2 and 0.5), whereas CCL5 gene was more highly induced by MERS-CoV Eng 1 (log ratios in MERS-CoV SA1 and MERS-CoV Eng1 respectively: 0.71 and 2.2). Examination of the aforementioned contrasting genes showed that only a small number of those were already differentially expressed at the early time-points. For example, expression of RHOF gene in response to MERS-CoV Eng 1 was increased 4-fold relative to mock at 12 hpi, whereas MERS-CoV SA 1 did not induce RHOF gene expression at this timepoint. We therefore focused on differences in the host response mainly at the later time-points that had the highest number of contrasting genes. To some extent, this was also observed for IFN-α2 gene expression, which showed higher up-regulation in response to MERS-CoV SA 1 at 24 hpi, as confirmed by qRT-PCR (Additional file 4: Figure S2 ). In addition, IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2 were DE relative to mock with high up-regulation at 18 and 24 hpi for both viruses. There were no virus-specific differences in expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1α or TNFα-IP3, which were highly up-regulated in response to both MERS-CoV Eng 1 and MERS-CoV SA 1. The cell migrationpromoting factor, TNFα-IP2 [21] , was highly up-regulated for MERS-CoV Eng 1 alone (Additional file 4: Figure S2 ). Cytokines appear to be important for MERS infection. To explore potential mechanisms regulating cytokine activity in response to MERS-CoV, we designed a microarray experiment to analyze Calu-3 responses to various cytokine treatments and develop signatures that were then examined in the context of MERS-CoV-infected Calu-3 cells. Calu-3 cells were treated with either human recombinant interferon IFN-α, IFN-γ, TNF or IL-1α, and cell lysates collected at different time points posttreatment for microarray. We found 399 DE genes responsive to recombinant IFN-α and 261 DE genes responsive to recombinant IFN-γ, and as expected, the majority of these genes were up-regulated following stimulation [22] . In response to pro-inflammatory cytokine treatment, we found 76 DE genes responsive to recombinant TNF and 383 DE genes responsive to recombinant IL-1α, which were also differentially expressed in response to MERS-CoV SA 1 or MERS-CoV Eng 1. Many of these genes showed cytokine-specific expression for IFN-α (260 DE genes), IFN-γ (107 DE genes), and IL-1α (209 DE genes ( Figure 4A ). TNF induced the least number of DE genes compared to the other cytokines (8 DE genes) . Within the cytokine-stimulated genes we identified a set of 149 genes showing strong contrasts at late time points (18 and 24 hpi) between MERS-CoV SA 1 and MERS-CoV Eng 1 ( Figure 4B ).
