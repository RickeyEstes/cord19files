While relatively efficient methods have been developed for the introduction of sialosides, the preparation of acetylated analogues is less well developed. It was anticipated that compound 1 could be prepared by a regioselective chemical acetylation 23 of Neu5Ac (2) to give 9-O-acetylated sialic acid 3, which can then be enzymatically converted into CMP-Neu5,9Ac 2 (4) employing the recombinant CMP-sialic acid synthetase from Neisseria meningitis. This enzyme possesses a flexible substrate specificity and has been employed for the synthesis of CMP-sialic acid analogues such as CMP-Neu5,9Ac 2 . 24, 25, 30 The resulting compound can then be used for the enzymatic glycosylation 26 of the C-3 0 hydroxyl of chemically prepared glycopeptide 10 using the recombinant rat a-(2?3)-sialyltransferase [EC 2.4.99.4] expressed in Spodooptera frugiperda to give, after removal of the N a -CBz protecting group of serine, target compound 1. Sialyltransferases exhibit some flexibility with regard to the structure of their acceptors and are able to trans-fer modified sialic acids from corresponding CMP-derivatives. 24, 25, 27 For example, a rat liver a-(2?3)sialyltransferase has been used to transfer Neu5,9Ac 2 from the corresponding CMP-donor to various glycoproteins, 28 and a porcine liver a(2?6)-sialyltransferase has been employed for the chemo-enzymatic synthesis of Neu5,9Ac 2 -a-(2?6)-Gal-b-(1?4)-GlcNAc-a-OCH 3 . 24 Recently, a library of (2?6)-linked modified sialosides of Gal-b-(1?4)-GlcNAc-a-O-(CH 2 ) 3 N 3 , which includes four 9-O-acetylated sialoside derivatives, has been prepared using the flexible recombinant Photobacterium damsela [EC 2.4.99.1] a-(2?6)-sialyltransferase by a one-pot three-enzyme system. 29 The enzymatic synthesis of the Neu5,9Ac 2 -a-(2?3)-Gal-O-p-nitrophenyl glycoside has also been reported. 30 It was anticipated that C-9 derivatives of sialic acid (Neu5Ac) would be readily available from Neu5Ac by a chemical regioselective acetylation. 23 (4) . The reported purification strategy 25 gave a compound 4 contaminated with phosphorylated nucleotides (CTP, CDP and CMP) and a small amount of CMP-Neu5Ac and Neu5Ac. However, it was found that highly pure 4 could be obtained by removal of inorganic salts by selective precipitation 31 in an ethanol-H 2 O mixture (9:1, v:v, twice) followed by size exclusion chromatography over extra fine Biogel P-2 using ammonium bicarbonate buffer as eluent at 4°C. Glycosylation of thioglycoside 5 32 with properly protected serine derivative 6 26 in the presence of Ph 2 SO-Tf 2 O and DTBMP provided the a-linked glycopeptide 7 in 83% yield with excellent a-anomeric selectivity . Treatment of 7 with aqueous acetic acid removed the benzylidene acetal and acetylation of the resulting free hydroxyls gave compound 8 in excellent overall yield. Next, the azido moiety of 8 was converted into an acetamido derivative by reaction with thioacetic acid in pyridine [33] [34] [35] and the resulting compound 9 was treated with a mixture of TFA and water to remove the t-butyl ester, and then with NaOMe in methanol to cleave the acetyl esters to give glycopeptide 10. 36 At this stage of the synthesis, the Cbz group was kept intact because protection of the amino group of serine is required for glycopeptide synthesis. Next, attention was focused on the enzymatic sialylation of 10 using a CMP-Neu5,9Ac 2 donor (4) (Scheme 3). Thus, the recombinant rat a-(2?3)-sialyltransferase [EC 2.4.99.4] expressed in S. frugiperda and a calf intestine alkaline phosphatase [EC 3.6.1.1] were added to a mixture of 4 and 10 dissolved in cacodylate buffer (50 mM; pH 6.2) containing Triton X-100 and BSA. 37 After incubation at 37°C for 2 h, another portion of alkaline phosphatase and CMP-Neu5,9Ac 2 (4) was added and after occasional stirring for an additional 3.5 h, TLC analysis showed complete consumption of the starting material 4 and the formation of a new product. Purification of the crude reaction mixture by a reverse-phase C 18 column chromatography followed by an ion exchange chromatography using Biorad AG 50W-X8 (100-200 mesh, Na + form) at 4°C, gave a pure trisaccharide 11 in a yield of 69%. In addition, a small amount (<5%) of 9-O-deacetylated product was also isolated. Compound 11 is appropriately protected for glycopeptide synthesis. However, fully unprotected 1 could be obtained by catalytic hydrogenation over Pd-C to remove the N a -Cbz group followed by purification by a Biogel P-2 size exclusion column chromatography. The chemical shift of the C-9 protons clearly demonstrated the presence of the C-9 acetyl ester: 4.37 (dd, 1H, J 8 00 ;9 00 a ¼ 2:2 Hz, J 9 00 a;9 00 b ¼ 12:0 Hz, H-9 00 a) and 4.19 (dd, 1H, J 8 00 ;9 00 b ¼ 5:8 Hz, J 9 00 a;9 00 b ¼ 12:0 Hz, H-9 00 b). In conclusion, we have developed an efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of the trisaccharide 11, which is appropriately protected for glycopeptide synthesis. It has been shown that the rat recombinant a-(2?3)-sialyltransferase expressed in S. frugiperda can accept CMP-Neu5,9Ac 2 as a donor. The improved purification protocol for CMP-Neu5,9Ac 2 was essential for the successful transfer of CMP-Neu5,9Ac 2 to glycosyl acceptor Gal-b- and AG 50W-X8 (100-200 mesh) ion exchange resin were obtained from Bio-Rad; preparative C 18 silica gel (125 Å , 55-105 lm) was obtained from Waters and Iatrobeads 6RS-8060 (60 lm) were purchased from Bioscan. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using Kieselgel 60 F 254 (Merck) plates with detection by UV and/or by charring with 5% sulfuric acid in ethanol, cerium ammonium nitrate or p-anisaldehyde reagents. Solvent evaporations were done in vacuo with a bath temperature <25°C. Optical rotations were measured with a Jasco P-1020 polarimeter. Both positive and negative ion matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra were recorded using an Applied Biosystems 4700 instrument with gentisic acid as matrix. 1D and 2D 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded at 25°C on Varian Inova300, Varian Inova500, Varian Inova600 or Varian Inova900 spectrometers. Assignments were obtained from COSY and HSQC spectra. For 1 H spectra recorded in CDCl 3 , D 2 O and CH 3 OD and 13 C spectra recorded in CDCl 3 , chemical shifts are given in ppm relative to solvents peaks (CDCl 3 , 1 H 7.24; 13 C, 77.00; D 2 O, 1 H, 4.76; CH 3 OD, 1 H, 3.31, 4.78). 13 C Spectra recorded in D 2 O were indirectly referenced. (7) Ph 2 SO (83 mg, 0.411 mmol), di-t-butyl-3-methyl pyridine (90.4 mg, 0.441 mmol) and crushed activated molecular sieves 4 Å (500 mg) were added to a cooled solution (À70°C) of disaccharide 5, (120 mg, 0.147 mmol) in CH 2 Cl 2 (6 mL) prior to the addition of trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (58 mg, 36 lL, 0.205 mmol). After stirring the mixture at À70°C for 5 min, a solution of 6 (85.5 mg, 0.29 mmol) in CH 2 Cl 2 (0.5 mL) was added dropwise by syringe. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at À60°C for 1 h and then allowed to warmed to room temperature over a period of 3 h. TLC analysis (hexanes-acetone 70:30, v:v) indicated completion of the reaction, which was quenched by the addition of solid NaHCO 3 . After addition of CH 2 Cl 2 , the mixture was filtered, washed with H 2 O, aqueous NaHCO 3 and brine, dried (MgSO 4 ), filtered and concentration in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexanes-EtOAc 65:35, v:v) to provide 7 (122 mg, 83%);
