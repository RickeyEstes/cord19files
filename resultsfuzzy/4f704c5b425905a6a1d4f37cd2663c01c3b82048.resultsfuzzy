In this subsection the sensor locations, coverage maps, and sensing times are investigated for the three flow fields with the addition of placement and sensing constraints. The effect of the adding the constraints on sensing time and the coverage maps are analyzed. Three different placement problems are addressed for each flow field; 1) the placement of sensors with no constraints, 2) placement of the sensors with a placement constraint outside of the occupied space, and 3) a placement constraint outside the occupied space along with a sensing constraint of sensing only the occupied space. Placement problem 1) with no constraints is analyzed as a reference point for when constraints are added. Placement problem 2) is designed for critical application like CBW and TID applications. The expensive sensors are placed outside the space where occupants may damage these sensors, and the entire volume is Fig. 13 . Sensing volume fraction of the interested volume for the 3 flow fields for no constraints a), b), and c); a placement constraint of sensors outside the occupied space d), e) and f); and both a sensing constraint outside the occupied zone and a sensing constraint of sensing only the occupied space g), h), and i). observable by the sensor network to ensure that the source release location is observable. Placement problem 3) is designed for IAQ applications since the volume of interest is the occupied space where contaminants like CO 2 and VOCs levels need to be controlled. The placement of the sensors in problem 3) are also outside the occupied zone to limit the damage or movement of the sensors by occupants. Each problem is analyzed individually, and an analysis of all the problems is discussed at the end. To be consistent, a sensor accuracy is 1% is used for all the problems.
