In the iterations of numerical simulation, it was noticed that a steady quasi-periodic variation appears after around 8000 iterations, especially in the pure buoyancy-driven windless case. The residuals no longer decrease but are maintained at an acceptable level. The velocity and concentration fluctuate significantly, and the fluctuation amplitude is over 20% of the mean values. In principle, the thermal plume above a heat source is not stable because it may laterally oscillate at a certain frequency. In our investigation of the cascade effect, two-dimensional simulations are also performed, and it was found that if there is a wind outside the window blowing vertically upward, alternating indoor air flow patterns were observed at certain critical points of the iterations where aiding force and counter-aiding force are equivalent. The multiple numerical solutions of unstable airflows are not taken into account due to the limited computation resources. Large eddy simulation and transient simulation using two equation models are expected to perform better in these situations. However, they are much more time-consuming. The following results are from the converged field after 15,000 iterations in each case.
