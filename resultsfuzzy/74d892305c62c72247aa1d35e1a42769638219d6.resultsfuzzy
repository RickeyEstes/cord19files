Most of the patients were males (Table 1) with ranging ages eight to 92 years-old: interestingly, in the first period of this global epidemic there were few cases in young people under fifteen-yearsold [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Nevertheless, among known infected subjects outside China prevalence of males and distribution of age, at the time of diagnosis, resemble those in Chinese epidemic [4, 6, 15] . Although past medical histories were not always available [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , hypertension was the most reported underlying condition [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] in as many as 80% and 31.2% , respectively, in the case series from Ren et al. [9] and Wang et al. [12] . Chen et al. [10] have described mostly cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (40%) in their population. Furthermore, Ren and colleagues [9] have reported underlying chronic liver disease in their whole population (N=5) and this feature differs, at least so far, from the other cases of 2019-nCoV [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Huang et al. and Wang et al. [1, 12] have shown a rate of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) of about 2% and 2,9%, respectively. Subsequently Chen et al. [10] have reported a rate of about 1% of respiratory system diseases, different from an estimated COPD prevalence between 1.2-8.9% in different regions of China [16] . Moreover, interstitial lung diseases, history of smoking, bronchiectasis or asthma were underreported [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Diabetes was firstly mentioned by Huang and colleagues [9] and represented the main comorbidity in their cohort (8; 20%) and afterwards other Authors [11] [12] reported diabetes in about 10% of subjects. Furthermore, among cases outside Asia, Holshue et al. [4] have mentioned hypertriglyceridemia as the sole chronic illness of the first U.S. case of 2019-nCoV; on the other hand, German cases [6] were overall healthy.
