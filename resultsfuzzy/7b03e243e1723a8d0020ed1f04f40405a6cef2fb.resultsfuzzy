The TPE derivatives were prepared as shown in Scheme 1A. Compound 1 was synthesized by a McMurry coupling reaction [22] between two molecules of 4,4 0 -dihydroxybenzophenone. Compound 1 was converted to tetrapropargyl compound 2 by reaction with 3-bromo-1-propyne in the presence of K 2 CO 3 in acceptable yield. The chemical structures and molecular masses of compounds 1 and 2 were confirmed from their NMR and mass spectra. Lactosyl and 6 0 -sialyllactosyl moieties were introduced into compound 2 by click chemistry between the propargyl group of TPE derivative and the azide group of aglycon of oligosaccharide compounds (12-azidododecyl b-lactoside and 12-azidododecyl 6 0 -sialyllactoside) using CuSO 4 and sodium ascorbate as shown in Scheme 1B. 12-Azidododecyl b-6 0 -sialyllactoside was obtained by enzymatic reaction from 12-azidododecyl b-lactoside using ST6 in 70% yield. Because the solubility of TPE derivative and12-azidododecyl b-lactoside to water was low, they were dissolved in DMSO and added to the reaction solution. TLC analysis (chloroform-methanol-H 2 O, 5:4:1) of these mixtures showed no sign of the starting compound 2. Analysis of the MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of Lac-TPE and a2,6SL-TPE revealed a peak at m/z 2777.6 ([M+Na] + ) and 4030.9 ([M-4H+5Na] + ), respectively. By dot blot method using lectin we confirmed the binding specificity of two kinds of fluorescent oligosaccharide probes (Lac-TPE and a2,6SL-TPE). Lectins RCA120 and SSA are known to bind specifically to lactose and sialyl(a2,6)Gal/sialyl(a2,6)GalNAc sequence, respectively. Lac-TPE and a2,6SL-TPE bound to RCA120 and SSA, respectively (Fig. S1 ). These fluorescent oligosaccharide probes were confirmed to be useful tools for detection by dot blot method. It is usually necessary for the analytes to have plural bind- ing sites to form aggregate states in the solution. However, the analytes immobilized on the membranes were detectable even if they have only one binding site. Human influenza viruses bind preferentially to sialic acids linked to galactose by an a2,6 linkage. We examined whether influenza virus could be specifically detected by the fluorescence oligosaccharide probe, because the influenza virus possesses HA molecules at a high density (about 1000 molecules/virus) on its surface [23] . Fig. 1 Fig. 3 . The influenza virus with a concentration higher than 10 5 pfu/100 ll was significantly detected. It is well-known that influenza viruses bind to sialyl sugar chain receptors on host cell membranes. Trimeric hemagglutinin (HA) molecules on the surface of the envelope membrane of the virus plays an important role in influenza virus infection to human cells. The binding specificity of HA changes easily by a mutation of the HA gene (only two sets of amino acid exchange) [13] , so that the detection method of influenza virus using oligosaccharide probes is quite useful for diagnosis of the influenza virus. In conclusion, we developed a simple method for the preparation of fluorescence oligosaccharide probes. TPE derivatives with propargyl residues could be used for ligation to oligosaccharide compounds with azide residues by click chemistry. Because the ligation reaction proceeded with CuSO 4 /ascorbate in water/DMSO mixtures at room temperature, water-soluble compounds such as oligosaccharide could be easily ligated to TPE derivatives. By this technique, we prepared fluorescence oligosaccharide probes and demonstrated that a2,6SL-TPE can be used as fluorescent sensor for influenza virus.
