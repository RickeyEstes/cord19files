To estimate the variance-covariance matrix H t in (3), the conditional mean function m t ($) in (1) needs to be specified correctly. Existing studies showed preferential use of the autoregressive (AR) model or the autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) model as the conditional mean model (Shareef & McAleer, 2005) . Since it is well known that there are AR and seasonal effects in the tourism demand time-series, AR terms and 11 seasonal dummy variables are included in the conditional mean equation (Wong, Song, & Chon, 2006) . Thus, conditional mean equation can be written by where c i,0 , c i,1 , c i,2 , s i,n and D n denote coefficients and seasonal dummy variables; and conditional variance-covariance equations are given in (3)-(7) with M ¼ 4. As a result, various combinations of lag order for AR and ARMA models are constructed. Based on Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Schwarz Bayesian Criteria (SBC), AR of order 2 lag order 2, or AR (2), is selected. Table 3 shows the estimated results of the proposed MGARCH model using a maximum likelihood estimation method assuming multivariate normality of error distribution. All the autoregressive coefficients are highly significant. All negative values of c i,1 imply that all tourism demand is negatively related with the previous one. The results of conditional variance equations are b imply that the conditional correlation is time-varying. However, the seasonal effects cannot be created. For countries with island destinations, summer or winter effects turn out to be quite significant. For example, the Philippines and Singapore have strong positive winter effects, e.g., the ''January effect'' for Korean tourists to escape the cold climate at home. The conditional variances for Y jeju , Y phil , Y sing , and Y thai are plotted in Fig. 3 . For Jeju, although the volatility of tourist departures were higher than those of the other destinations before 1990, there have been less fluctuations since 1990. The volatility of domestic visitors to Jeju Island were rather stable despite positive mega events or unfavorable events that took place in Korea in recent years, including the Asian Financial Crisis (1997) (1998) (1999) Thus, it can be surmised that Korean outbound travel to these three Asian countries could have different determinants of volatility due to tourist behavior and various other events. Fig. 4 shows time-varying conditional correlations among the four destinations for Korean tourists. Three periodsdbefore 1988, from 1988 to the Asian Financial Crisis (1997), and 1997-2006dare examined and analyzed. Regardless of these categories, all conditional correlations for tourism demand among the three Asian destinations have shown increasing patterns. This implies that a positive relationship tends to increase as time progresses. However, for the conditional correlations of tourism demand between Jeju and the three Asian destinations, there have been negative conditional correlations over certain time horizonsdfor example, in the early 1980s, around 1990, and around 2000. The negative correlation in the early 1980s could be attributed to strict overseas travel control by the Korean government. The negative correlation during this period could be recognized as the ''substitute effect.'' It shows that the change in demand was entailed by the change in the rate of exchange rate between two goods (Varian, 2005) . Most tourists sensitive to the variability of the price could (1997) , there were distinctive ''U''-shape conditional correlations between Jeju and the three Asian countries. Those ''U''-shape conditional corrections can be attributed to certain macroeconomic variables or Korea's country-specific events. From 1997 to 2006, conditional correlations showed a decreasing pattern, a possible indication of sharp upward trends of Korean outbound tourists. All conditional correlations had similar trends from 1980 to 1988. However, when the Liberalization of the Travel Code was instituted in 1988, it had a significant impact on conditional corrections. It was not long before conditional correlations COR12, COR13, and COR23 appeared in the same trends, usually toward the upper drifts. 6 On the other hand, COR14, COR24, and COR34 displayed decreasing trends from 1988 to mid 1990s. 7 These correlations, COR14, COR24, and COR34, always remained below the former three conditional correlations. The Liberalization of the Travel Code (1988) affected clearly tourists' outbound decisions since tourists had more choices of their overseas vacation destinations. Conditional correlations including Jeju Island were always below the patterns of other conditional correlations. It is thus inferred that the Jeju Island was substituted by the Korean outbound tourists for the three Asian destinations. Therefore, it is important to further analyze the trend of Korean outbound tourism demand after a significant tourism policy change, in this case, after the Liberalization of the Travel Code was introduced in 1988. Unit-root and cointegration tests are first performed to construct the VECM model. If all variables are stationary, testing the cointegrating relationship among variables is not possible. Once the null hypothesis of a unit-root test is not rejecteddi.e., there are a unit-root and some variablesdthen a cointegration test can be performed. When there is no cointegration among variables, then VECM cannot be constructed. For a unit-root test, augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) tests are used, while the Johansen (1988) procedure is used for a cointegration test. Even though ADF (Dickey & Fuller, 1979) and PP tests (Phillips & Perron, 1988) can perform the test for unit-root, the two tests have slightly different purposes. The PP test is conducted to examine the existence of GARCH errors. The ADF tests unambiguously take into account a serial conditional correlation by modeling the structure in the errors, but not heteroskedasticity. However, the PP tests analyze both serial conditional correlation and heteroskedasticity using a non-parametric method. Table 4 reports the results of unitroot tests. Lag orders of ADF and PP tests are determined based on AIC. The test results strongly support the null hypothesis of unitroot for level, but not the first order differenced series of variables. This means that the variables are converted into stationarity after taking the first order difference. Since there is a unit-root for all prescribed variables, it is possible to perform a cointegration test based on the Johansen (1988) method. The critical values for the trace and the maximal eigenvalue test for testing the number of cointegrating vectors using the Johansen maximum likelihood procedure are available from several sources, including Johansen and Juselius (1990) . The critical values for these tests depend on how linear trends and seasonal dummies are included in the estimation. Johansen and Juselius (1990) Fig. 3 . Volatilities of Korean outbound tourism demand for the four destinations. 6 COR12, COR13, and COR23 denote a conditional correlation between Thailand and Singapore, between Thailand and the Philippines, and between Singapore and the Philippines, respectively. 7 COR14, COR24, and COR34 denote a conditional correlation between Thailand and Jeju, between Singapore and Jeju, and the Philippines and Jeju, respectively. vectors and moves consecutively to a large number of cointegration vectors. Table 5 illustrates the results of the cointegration rank test. There are six and one cointegrating vectors based on the trace and the maximum eigenvalues at the five percent significant levels, respectively. A VECM comprised of ten variables is estimated in this study. The process of lag length selection is important for the specification of a VECM (p) model. If the lag length of p is too small, the model cannot represent the data generating process. On the other hand, if the lag length of p is too large, the model may be over parameterized. Lag length of p ¼ 1 and 6 are chosen based on the AIC and SBC, respectively. Only VECM(1) is considered because the estimated results of VECM(1) and VECM(6) are very similar. The responses of COR14, COR24, and COR34 to a 'positive shock' given to each variable are plotted in Figs. 5-7. The 'positive shock' is measured by the Cholesky one standard deviation innovations. 8 For design purposes, only the impulse response function for the conditional correlation between tourism demand for Jeju Island and the rival destinations is presented. Fig. 5 shows responses of the conditional correlation between Thailand and Jeju Island (COR14). The response of COR14 to a shock to itself has been fluctuating smoothly up to ten months and converged to a positive constant, 0.024. For a shock to IPI, the response of COR14 moved monotonously to 0.0043 for the first ten months and reached 0.0044 in the long-run. The response of the shock to the real exchange rate of Thailand was negative for the first four months, but turned to a positive value and converged to 0.01 in the long-run. This can be regarded as behavioral change of potential tourists regarding Jeju Island. Since there was a positive shock in the exchange rate, price-sensitive potential tourists for Jeju were quick to change their travel plan for Thailand. Therefore, potential tourists for Thailand became actual arrivals so that the correlation between tourism demand of Thailand and Jeju decreased in the short-run. However, in the long-run, tourists who wanted to travel to Jeju and who did not go to Thailand before the exchange rate shock were likely to visit Jeju. This should make COR14 increase in the long-run. The shock to the conditional correlation between the Philippines and Jeju Island (COR34) made COR14 increase by 0.01 in the long-run. On the other hand, the response of COR14 to the conditional correlation between Singapore and Jeju Island (COR24) varied from zero, to À0.011 to zero during the first ten months, and was À0.012 in the long-run. The real exchange rates of the Philippines and Singapore impinged negatively, À0.0032 and À0.008 in the long-run. Thus, the Philippines and Singapore could be regarded as the substitutes for Jeju Island and Thailand. As it can be discerned from Fig. 6 , the positive shock to IPI affected COR24 slightly: À0.0008 to 0.0024 in the first ten months and 0.0024 in the long-run. The real exchange rate of Singapore impinged positively: 0.0040-0.0073 in the first ten months and 0.0072 in the long-run. For a positive shock to COR34, the response of COR24 decreased from zero to À0.001 in the first month, increased from À0.001 to 0.0035 up to ten months, and was 0.0034 in the long-run. The response of COR24 to a shock to the real exchange rate of the Philippines had been widely fluctuating, from zero to À0.012 up to ten months, and converged to a negative constant À0.012 in the long-run. This can be attributed to the changes in the behavior of actual tourists for Jeju Island and Singapore. Some price-sensitive tourists, including potential tourists for Singapore and Jeju Island, tended to alter their plans to visit the Philippines when there was a positive shock to the real exchange rate of the Philippines. Thus, the conditional correlation between the tourism demand of Singapore and Jeju Island was decreasing. However, it is not discernable whether the real exchange rate of the Philippines directly affected tourists bound for Jeju Island and Singapore. Fig. 7 describes responses of COR34 to positive shocks to tested variables, including COR34 itself. The response of COR34 to a shock to IPI was decreasing from À0.0035 to À0.0046 up to ten months and then converged to a negative constant, À0.0046. For a shock to the real exchange rate of the Philippines, the response of COR34 decreased sharply, from À0.0050 to À0.0082 during the first three months, then increased from À0.0082 to À0.0055 up to 18 months, and finally converged to À0.0055 in the long-run. Thus, the positive shocks to the real exchange rate of the Philippines and IPI affected the potential tourism demand of Jeju Island. Since there was a positive shock to the real exchange rate, some price-sensitive tourists originally planned for visiting Jeju were willing to change their decision for the Philippines. In addition, when income increased, the number of tourists destined for the Philippines increased, so that the correlation between the tourism demand of the Philippines and Jeju also decreased in the short-run and in the long-run. The responses of the shock to the real exchange rates of Singapore and Thailand were À0.004 and À0.002 in the long-run, respectively. Thus, Singapore and Thailand can be regarded in the long-run as the substitute destinations for the Philippines and Jeju Island for price-sensitive tourists. The variance decomposition (VD) method explains the analysis of the dynamic properties of a VECM. This decomposition enables researchers to comprehend the proportion of the fluctuation in a series clarified by its own shocks versus shocks from other variables. Generally, it is expected that a variable can explain almost all its forecast error variance during short periods and smaller proportions in the long-run. As it can be seen from Table 6 , COR14 was shown to be largely autonomous in variance decomposition, while other variables, COR24 and COR34, had an impact of about 8% on output in the COR14. The real exchange rates of the Philippines and Thailand had a more relative impact on COR14, compared with an average of 1.5% in IPI. The real exchange rate of Thailand had a nearly 8% impact on COR14, and the real exchange rate of the Philippines affected COR14 moderately, with an average of 5% variance, self-determined after five months, on COR14. COR24 was also shown to be mostly autonomous in variance decomposition, but COR14 explained less than 5% variance after ten months, and COR34 affected very slightly, about 1%, on COR24. Unexpectedly, the results of the real exchange rate illustrated that the variance of COR24 was better explained by an average of 11% after 18 months with the real exchange rate of the Philippines, compared with an average of 4.9% in the real exchange rate of Singapore. Although COR34 was also explained to be largely self-sufficient, with an average of 55%, the variance of COR14 had a strong effect, with an average of 30% variance of COR34 in the long-run. Additionally, the real exchange rate and IPI only marginally influenced COR34. Therefore, conditional correlations were shown to be mainly autonomous in VD, while other variables had an impact on output in the conditional correlation in their VD. In one case, such as COR24, the real exchange rate movements of rival countries were shown to be very sensitive to movements in the conditional correlations.
