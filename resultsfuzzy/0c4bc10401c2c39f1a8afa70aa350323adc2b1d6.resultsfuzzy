For DV and UFAD, concentration distributions for tracer gas, For 16 mm particles, particle concentrations were uniform and were approximately the same under the three TV strategies due to their large gravitational force. This finding indicates that for 16 mm and larger particles DV and UFAD may lose their advantages in providing better indoor air quality in the occupied zone than MV. In other words, the stratification phenomenon disappears. However, in these cases the intensive deposition is self-cleaning mechanism. Fig. 6 compares simulated concentrations of tracer gas to experimental data obtained from Cermak and Melikov [13] under DV at two measuring positions near the polluting and the exposed manikins (A and B in Fig. 3) . It was found that the profiles of the simulated results and the measured ones show a similar tendency. The discrepancies are mainly due to that the exact coordinates of the measuring positions and boundary conditions in the literature [13] are not clearly presented.
