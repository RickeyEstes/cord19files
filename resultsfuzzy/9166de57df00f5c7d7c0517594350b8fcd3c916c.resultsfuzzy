The mean age ± SD of women in group A and the average number of postmenopausal years was 56.4 ± 3.9 years (range, 51-63 years) and 6.8 ± 3.1 (range, 4-13 years). While in group B was 55 ± 5.2 (range, 45-69 years) and 6 ± 3.2 (range, 1-18 years) respectively. Prevalence of BV in group A was slightly lower (12.5 %) than among women in group B (13.3 %), but the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Absence of lactobacilli from vaginal smears without any symptoms of vulvovaginitis was found in 36.6% of women in group B and 11% of women in group A. High number of lactobacillus colonization was observed in only 10% of women who did not received HRT. Conclusions: Treatment of postmenopausal women with tibolone has no statistically significant effect on Ôfull BVÕ prevalence. However, it did seem to affect lactobacillus colonization of the vagina, altering the flora to premenopausal profile. The PCT basal levels in the control group patients were lower than 1 ng/ml (median 0.35, 5-95 percentiles 0.258-2-223). The higher values were obtained in COPD patients undergoing pneumonia (median 3.11, 5-95 percentiles 0.158-72-44). The neopterin basal levels in the control group patients were lower than 30 ng/ml (median 0.195, percentiles 0.014-5.334). The higher values of neopterin were also obtained in COPD patients affected of pneumonia. In addition, the PCT levels were higher in COPD exacerbated patients than in stable COPD patients. However, significant differences were only observed when comparing the exacerbated severe COPD patients (p = 0.018) to the stable COPD patients. Conclusion: We can conclude that PCT and neopterin show higher levels in COPD patients presenting pneumonia than in those presenting clinical exacerbation without pneumonia and those in a stable period of the disease. Furthermore, a correlation between PCT and the severity of the COPD is observed. The likelihood of the clinical diagnosis was enhanced by both anamnestic and epidemiological data, and serological confirmation was obtained by testing IgM with ELISA. 90% of the patients presented with a typical clinical picture of trichinosis, including fever, periorbital edema, myalgia (usually affecting the gastrocnemius muscle), and eosinophilia in the first days of disease. However, 5% of the patients showed eosinopenia (down to 2%) within the first days, which correlated with the severity of the disease. The clinical features of these latter patients also included myocarditis, neurologic disorders and respiratory failure.Treatment of trichinosis is known to be not satisfactory. In prescribing the antiparasitic therapy, attention should be paid to the phase of the disease, its severity and the eosinophyl blood count. Our approach was highly individualised and consisted of both etiologic and pathogenetic (or symptomatic) therapy. The etiologic therapy aimed at destructing intestinal worms, preventing the development of cyst walls around the larvae, and destructing the Trichinella larvae in the muscle fibers. We used mebendazol 0.3 g every 8 h for 10 days. This etiologic therapy was most effective in the incubation phase or in the first days of disease, when localisation of Trichinella still remained intestinal. Vice-versa, therapy with mebendazol during the muscular period of disease not only was less effective but could also lead to a further exacerbation of the symptoms. The symptomatic therapy included antihistaminic and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. In the most severe invasive forms, we used glucocorticosteroids (prednisolon 20-80 mg/day for 5-7 days). The CMV clinical syndrome manifesting in self by fever and other typical clinical signs was determined for 13 persons. In 11 cases the CMV infection was asymptomatic. A positive PCR test was obtained for 12 recipients out of 13 with symptomatic CMV infection and only for 5 out of 11-with asymptomatic infection. A negative PCR test was obtained for 6 patients with the asymptomatic infection and only for 1 with the clinical manifestation of the CMV infection. Thus, using the qualitative PCR method when only a positive or negative result is obtained without estimation of the amount of viral nucleic acids, the symptomatic CMV infection with early onset may be identified in 92.3% of cases (sensitivity of methods), though a positive result in also obtained in 29.4% of cases of the asymptomatic CMV infection. Therefore, specificity of method in as low as 54.4%. Conclusion: The positive prognostic value of the PCR test while seeking to have early detection of the symptomatic CMV infection requiring appropriate treatment is as low as 70.6%. Somewhat more valuable is the negative prognostic value of the PCR test-in the presence of a negative result, in 85.5% of cases there is no clinical manifestation of the CMV infection, and in such cases a specific antiviral treatment is not needed.
