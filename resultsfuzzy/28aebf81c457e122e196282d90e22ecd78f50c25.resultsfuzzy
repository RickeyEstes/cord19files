3.1. The effect of the number of people on concentrations of bioaerosols Fig. 1 shows that an increase in the number of people in the student hall results in increased concentrations of bacterial aerosols (y=1.62x+40.9, r 2 =0.9764, t-test p-value < 0.01). However, concentrations of fungal aerosols were not influenced by the number of occupants inside the test space (y=0.37x+42.8, r 2 =0.78). The concentrations of fungal bioaerosols did not vary significantly regardless of the number of human occupants in the student hall (t-test p-value > 0.05). Therefore, the experimental data in Fig. 1 support the hypotheses that humans increase the concentration of bacterial bioaerosols in indoor environments but that concentrations of fungal bioaerosols are not affected by the presence of humans. This result is in harmony with a previous study of underground subway stations (Heo & Lee, 2016) . For fungal bioaerosols, this result agrees with previous findings that occupants were not a significant factor for fungal bioaerosols (Adams et al., 2013) .
