In a total of 93.6% of the samples, FCoV nucleic acid could be detected. Only six PET samples tested negative, whereas all fresh organ samples tested positive. In respect to the expected lower RNA concentration in the PETs due to the formalin fixation procedure on one hand and due to the long storage time (2-3 years) on the other hand, we chose primers which amplified, compared to those employed by Posch et al. (1999 Posch et al. ( , 2001 , a smaller segment of the viral genome. With these primers we achieved a differentiation of the two types in 47 of 65 PET specimens and in 27 of 29 fresh organ samples, in addition two samples exhibited a questionable PCR result. As expected, the percentage of positive PCR results was lower in the PET samples than in the fresh organ samples. The sequencing results show even in the very short region, which had been sequenced, a clear discrimination between FCoV type I, FCoV type II and CCV strains (Fig. 1) . The 11 partial sequences of the Austrian FCoV type I samples show significant differences, compared to the reference strain KU2, which resulted in identity rates of (only) 86-91% to the reference strain; also within the Austrian FCoV type I samples several nucleotide changes can be noticed, indicative of a quite high mutation rate. The FCoV type II samples form an own group with an identity to the FCoV type I reference strain of only 73-75%, respectively. CCV exhibits an identity to FCoV-1 KU-2 of 72%; its much closer relationship to FCoV type II than to FCoV type I can nicely be observed by the similarity of several nucleotide changes of FCoV type II and CCV. These findings support the observation that FCoV type II may arise from recombinations with CCV . Nonetheless, CCV also exhibits several unique nucleotide changes. The sequencing data of one of the five samples showing double infections (Fig. 1) demonstrate clearly the plausability of such co-infections.
