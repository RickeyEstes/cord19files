Now we assess how control interventions that target different aspects of the disease process may affect the basic reproduction number R 0 , the total endemic prevalenceP and the endemic prevalence of symptomatic infectionP I . Each intervention is modelled by a change in one parameter of the model. For example, a vaccine that acts to decrease the susceptibility of hosts to both symptomatic infection and asymptomatic carriage is modelled as a decrease in the transmission rate β. We also consider interventions that change η (e.g. by quarantining symptomatic infectives), γ (e.g. through a mass drug administration), ξ (e.g. by treating only symptomatic cases), ω (e.g. by providing treatment that targets symptoms, not pathogen clearance), τ (e.g. by improving sanitation) and α (e.g. through a vaccine targeting pathogen strains associated with symptomatic infection, allowing carriage strains to persist). First, we determine whether the slope of R 0 (and thus the slope ofP because it is an increasing function of R 0 ) in the direction of any of these model parameters switches from being positive to negative as other parameters in the model are changed. If a switch in the slope of R 0 in the direction of one of these parameters is possible, then there is a risk that the corresponding intervention will be predicted to either reduce or increase transmission but lead to the opposite effect if estimates of other model parameters are inaccurate. It is straightforward to show that the condition always holds true for the parameters x ∈ {η, β}, and never holds true for the parameters x ∈ {γ , ξ }, which makes intuitive sense because increasing the infectivity of either infection type (through increasing β or η) or prolonging their periods of infectiousness (through decreasing γ or ξ ) will always result in more secondary infections on average per infectious case. For parameters controlling the relative frequency of appearance of asymptomatic carriers (x ∈ {ω, τ , α}), the reproduction potential of carriers A determines whether or not condition (3.14) holds true. For x ∈ {ω}, condition (3.14) only holds true when A > 1. If A < 1, then condition (3.14) holds true for x ∈ {τ , α}. In electronic supplementary material, figure S2 , we illustrate the dependence of ∂R 0 /∂τ on A. Clearly, decreasing τ causes R 0 to increase only if A < 1; otherwise it decreases. We also considered the effects of the same set of interventions on the endemic prevalence of diseasê P I . For x ∈ {β, η}, a similar result is obtained: ∂P I /∂x > 0 always holds true for x ∈ {β, η}. For parameters controlling the relative frequency of appearance of asymptomatic carriers (x ∈ {ω, τ , α}), the reproduction potential again plays a key role in determining whether ∂P I /∂x > 0 holds true. When A < 1, decreasing the relative frequency of appearance of symptomatic infectives (by decreasing τ or α, or increasing ω) will Overall, our analyses highlight how the relative reproduction potential of carriers A largely determines the effects of interventions on a pathogen's basic reproduction number R 0 , total endemic prevalenceP and the endemic prevalence of diseaseP I , when interventions are designed to alter the relative frequency of appearance of asymptomatic carriers (i.e. change τ , ω and α). In figure 4 , we provide examples of how A affects the outcomes of interventions targeting either the regression rate ω (figure 4a), the progression rate τ (figure 4b) or the symptomatic proportion α (figure 4c). The corresponding endemic prevalences of asymptomatic carriers, symptomatic infections and total prevalence before and after these interventions are shown in electronic supplementary material, figure S3 . Accordingly, if estimates of A are inaccurate there is the potential for an effective intervention to be assessed as unviable by the model, or for an ineffective intervention to be recommended for implementation.
