Using P19 cells, we demonstrated that NZFs were expressed transiently during neuronal differentiation, and forced expression of NZF cDNAs resulted in neuronal differentiation. These results suggest that NZF family have a function regulate neuronal differentiation. To elucidate in vivo functions of NZF family in detail, we generate knockout mice of NZF-2 and NZF-3 respectively. NZF-2 null mice are born alive, but die within 10 min after birth with cyanosis. On the other hand, NZF-3 null mice are viable, fertile and appear normal. These mice look normal morphologically. Then we generate double knockout mice of NZF-2 and NZF-3 by intercrossing. Double knockout mice have a forelimb posture abnormalities like arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. And we find out that the spinal nerves projecting forelimb and trunk are decrease dramatically in the double knockout mice embryo. , 2006) . In the present study, to examine the role of Runx3 in the development of DRG in more detail, we examined the development of DRG neurons in Runx3-deficient mice from the early embryonic stages to birth, using various markers for subpopulation of DRG neurons. In newborn Runx3−/− mice, parvalbumin-positive DRG neurons were greatly reduced in number, whereas calretinin-positive neurons were slightly decreased. Similar decreases were observed in embryonic days 14.5 and 15.5.
