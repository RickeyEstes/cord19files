In experimental infection of mice with influenza virus A/H5N1 A/goose/Krasnoozerskoye/627/05 we observed a high mortality rate of 75%. The death of animals was registered in 7-11 days after infection. The maximum number of dead animals was recorded on day 8 of the experiment. In previous virological studies, it has been shown that the selected isolate of HPAI H5N1 A/goose/Krasnoozerskoye/627/05 is highly pathogenic for mice and is capable of replicating in many organs, including the liver, without prior adaptation [10] . Visualization of viral antigen by IHC in the liver of infected mice showed that on day 1 of the experiment, and thereafter, the highest rate of replication of the A/H5N1 influenza virus was reported in sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells (Figures 1 and 2) , which was associated with their phagocytosis function. The maximum number of cells with signs of A/H5N1 influenza virus replication in mice liver was detected on day 3 of infection. The preferential detection of viral antigen in the sinusoidal cells is probably an evidence of the increasing viremia due to destruction of infected cells and releasing of new virus particles into the blood. At the histological examination of the liver of infected animals in the first six days, we registered expansion and congestion of major veins and sinusoids with signs of stasis and hemolysis of erythrocytes. From the first day after infection, we observed hepatocytes in a state of dystrophy, necrosis. Volume density of destructive changes of hepatocytes on day 6 postinfection was the largest and amounted to 93.78% (Figure 3) , which indicates the subtotal damage to hepatocytes and the development of liver failure. To day 10 of the experiment, the value of this indicator decreased slightly (Figure 3 ), which may indicate the activation of repair processes in the surviving animals. At the IHC study of cytokine profile, we registered expression of TNF-and IL-6 by Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells at the cellular level. The number of liver cells with IL-6 expression was the largest on day 3 of infection and gradually decreased to day 10 of the experiment (Figure 4 ). The total numeric density of the liver cells with the expression of TNF-was high on the first day and reached its maximum value on day 6. During the whole experiment, Kupffer cells were the dominant type of liver cells expressing proinflammatory cytokines. To assess the hydrolytic capacity of Kupffer cells of mice infected with A/H5N1 virus, production of lysozyme, cathepsin D, and myeloperoxidase was investigated. Increased expression of these enzymes was observed at all stages of the experiment. Already at the first day of infection significant increase of cells expressing lysozyme was recorded in the liver of infected mice, and the vast majority of them were provided by Kupffer cells. The value of this index increased to day 3; then there was an observed reduction of concentration of cells expressing lysozyme till the end of the experiment ( Figure 5 ). Also, lysozyme-secretory activity was detected in endothelial cells, but their numbers were insignificant compared with Kupffer cells. Probably, the prevalence of cells expressing the lysozyme in the early stages after infection has an adaptive nature in connection with a broad spectrum of activity of this enzyme, which belongs to the enzymes of "rapid response" destroying the peptidoglycan envelope viruses and enhancing the effectiveness of phagocytosis [21, 22] . Later, azurophilic granules are mobilized. They contain cathepsins, including cathepsin D as the most common [23] . The number of cells expressing cathepsin D in the liver of mice infected with A/H5N1 virus also reached its maximum value on day 3 of the disease with a gradual decrease to day 10 ( Figure 5) . The numerical density of cells expressing myeloperoxidase in the liver of infected mice was the highest in comparison with other investigated enzyme levels at all stages of observation, and it also reached a maximum on day 3 of the disease. To day, 10 there was a 1.6-fold decrease of this parameter (Figures 5 and 6 ). Myeloperoxidase oxidizes cofactors, translating them into an active form, thus providing a powerful microbicidal effect [24] . However, the output of myeloperoxidase in the extracellular space by exocytosis or phagocytic destruction can cause pathological action of the enzyme under the conditions for its development, for example, low pH values during ischemia. The resulting strong oxidants cause tissue damage of the organism [25] . Analysis of the results suggests that in conditions of depletion of lymphoid tissue caused by HPAI H5N1, a special role in protecting the organism from infection belongs to the liver as a key organ of the nonspecific protection. High HPAI H5N1 virus tropism for vascular endothelial cells of all organs promotes early viremia and generalization of infection. A/H5N1 virus persistence in cells of different histogenesis is associated with a significant activation of cellmediated immunity, resulting in an increased production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-and IL-6) that, on the one hand, is a protective mechanism consisting in the recruitment of immune cells into the focus infection and in the activation of regenerative processes in the organs via growth factors. On the other hand, an excessive accumulation of inflammatory cytokines facilitates the initiation of degradation processes [12] . A/H5N1 virus infection of mice was accompanied by early activation of the expression of myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, and cathepsin D by Kupffer cells. Intracellular proteases are the most important factors of nonspecific protection that provide the intracellular disintegration of the virus proteins. But, apparently, these mechanisms are ineffective for HPAI H5N1 viruses. High hydrolytic capacity of cells, being an early nonspecific protection factor, at the same time, can be a trigger point to initiate lysis of host cells (secondary alteration) with the development of spread destructive complications in the organs in case of phagolysosome membrane labilization after absorption of viral particles. Thus, defective antiviral response that triggers a cascade of cytokine-mediated responses, only exacerbates the destructive processes in the liver of experimental animals, which together with insufficient oxygen supply caused by damage of lungs lead to irreversible structural and functional changes and the early development of acute liver failure.
