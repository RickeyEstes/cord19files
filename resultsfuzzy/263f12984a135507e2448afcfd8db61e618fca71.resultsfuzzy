Regarding global sentiment, eight out of ten industry returns are significantly and negatively related with global sentiment, except for HEA being positively related, and OIL shows no notable positive relationship with global sentiment. The findings suggest that expected industry returns react diversely to local and global sentiments. Specifically, the results show that from the predictive relation, greater global market optimism lowers future industry returns. More exceptionally, local and global sentiments positively sway HEA, which is consistent with prior studies arguing that HEA is the next mainstream industry with fortunes to be made, and Asian economies are rushing to establish themselves as a major player here and to become a prime target for foreign investment. 12 Global sentiment shows no significant positive effect for OIL, which is consistent with our inference that conventional industries possessing bond-like and safer features are less affected by sentiment. It is worth noting that one of the most possibly important sources of the correlation between current shock to stock returns and the shock to sentiment is the business cycle fluctuation. After controlling for economic fundamentals, the residual from Eq. (1) is expected to be a purely irrational element in sentiment, uncorrelated with shocks to industry returns. However, the limitations of Eq. (1) are that heterogeneous effects in different sentiment regimes cannot be analyzed. The plausible nonlinearity in investor sentiment impact on expected industry returns and the asymmetry between high-and low-sentiments also cannot be taken into account and may generate bias. Hence, the next two subsections discuss the results of asymmetric sentiment-return nexuses.
