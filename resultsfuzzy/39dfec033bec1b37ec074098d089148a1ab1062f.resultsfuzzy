World primates synthesizing α-gal epitopes and their replacement with offspring-lacking the α-gal epitope and producing the natural anti-Gal antibody. Few individuals in early Old World primate populations, who carried mutations inactivating the α1,3GT gene, produced the natural anti-Gal antibody. This antibody production is analogous to the present day rare blood type "Bombay" individuals lacking blood group O (H antigen) and producing anti-H antibodies. Epidemics by enveloped viruses presenting α-gal epitopes that were synthesized by α1,3GT of ancestral Old World primates caused the extinction of these primates, whereas offspring-lacking α-gal epitopes were protected by the natural anti-Gal antibody they produced. These offspring ultimately replaced the extinct primates that conserved active α1,3GT. Ab-antibody. Reprinted from Galili, U., 2016 .

Glycobiology 26, 1140 Glycobiology 26, -1150 which were synthesized by α1,3GT in the infected host cells. However, the very few primates that were homozygous for the inactivated α1,3GT gene, lacked active α1,3GT enzyme, did not synthesize α-gal epitopes and produced the natural anti-Gal antibody. These few primates could have been protected by this antibody against viruses expressing α-gal epitopes. Anti-Gal protection could be mediated by several mechanisms, including: (1) neutralization and destruction of the virus by anti-Gal binding to the virus α-gal epitopes and activating the complement system, which induced complement-mediated lysis of the virus, (2) opsonization of the virus by anti-Gal could induce effective uptake and destruction of the virus by macrophages following Fc/Fcγ receptor interaction between the opsonizing anti-Gal and these cells, and (3) extensive uptake of anti-Gal opsonized viruses by macrophages and dendritic cells via Fc/Fcγ receptor interaction could result in rapid processing and presentation of immunogenic viral peptides by these antigen presenting cells (APC) that effectively transport the virus antigens to regional lymph nodes. This APC-mediated mechanism would have resulted in induction of rapid, potent humoral and cellular protective anti-virus immune responses. Thus, such an immune response could also protect against infecting viruses that "lost" their α-gal epitopes because of the initial infection of the host cells lacking α1,3GT. The ability of anti-Gal to markedly increase immunogenicity of vaccinating viruses by targeting them for effective uptake by APC is further detailed in Chapter 9 that describes the amplification of virus vaccine immunogenicity by α-gal epitopes linked to vaccinating viral glycoproteins (Abdel-Motal et al., 2006 , 2010 . Overall, the combined effects of the anti-Gal-mediated protective mechanisms could result in decrease in initial infecting virus burden, T cell-mediated destruction of cells infected by the virus, as well as destruction and neutralization of virus de novo produced in infected cells by elicited antibodies specific to virus protein antigens. The outcome of these protective mechanisms could be prevention of infective virus progression before it reaches lethal stages. Anti-Gal IgG crosses the placenta into the fetal blood in humans (Galili et al., 1984) . Anti-Gal is also present in colostrum and milk, as well as in other body secretions, primarily as the IgA isotype (class) (Hamadeh et al., 1995) . Thus, it is possible that anti-Gal-mediated protection against an infectious virus that presents α-gal epitopes also occurred in newborns. In the absence of competition from parental primate populations synthesizing α-gal epitopes, the small populations of offspring-lacking α-gal epitopes and producing the natural anti-Gal antibody replaced the extinct parental Old World primate populations that conserved active α1,3GT. It should be stressed that the proposed scenario could occur with any type of enveloped virus that presented α-gal epitopes, which was endemic to the Eurasia-Africa landmass because any enveloped virus propagated in cells containing active α1,3GT is likely to present α-gal epitopes. The process of selective evolutionary elimination of α-gal epitopes, which occurred in ancestral Old World primates, may not be feasible in all mammalian species synthesizing α-gal epitopes. One example is GT-KO mice. These mice develop cataract at the age of 6-9 weeks in the absence of α-gal epitopes (Thall, 1999; Sørensen et al., 2008) . Although GT-KO mice developing such cataract can survive in the protected environment of animal facilities, their survival would have been questionable in natural environments. In contrast, GT-KO pigs were not reported to develop the cataract observed in mice in the absence of α-gal epitopes.
