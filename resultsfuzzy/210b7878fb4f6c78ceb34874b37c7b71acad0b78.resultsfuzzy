WNVCp could bind to Hsp70 independently of ATP WNVCp is known to induce apoptosis by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase-9 activation in tissue culture (24) . Furthermore, when its gene is delivered to mouse brain or skeletal muscle, it can cause cell death and inflammation in vivo (24) . To further identify the functional role of WNVCp, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid assay using the entire region of WNVCp as bait. The result showed that several chaperones, including Hsp70, were able to bind to WNVCp. To confirm the binding ability of Hsp70 to WNVCp, recombinant Hsp70 and His-WNVCp were purified (Fig. 1A) . The interaction between purified recombinant proteins was tested using a Ni + -agarose pull-down assay (Fig. 1B) . The results indicated that Hsp70 was able to bind to WNVCp (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2) . ATP was added to the reaction system to exclude the possibility of denatured WNVCp binding to Hsp70 as an unfolded substrate (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4) . As a control, recombinant Hsp70 was shown not to bind to Ni + -agarose non-specifically (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6) . It is known that the presence of ATP facilitates the release of unfolded substrate from Hsp70 [1] . As a control, we carried out an interaction between Hsp70 and chemically denatured luciferase in the presence or absence of ATP (Fig. 1C) . The data indicated that, in the presence of ATP, the denatured substrates did not bind to Hsp70 (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4) . The immunoprecipitation assays of ectopic WNVCp overexpressed in a human kidney tumor cell line, 293T, with endogenous Hsp70 showed that the WNVCp and Hsp70 bind in cells, indicating physiologically viable interaction between the two proteins (Fig. 1C) . Overall, the interaction between Hsp70 and WNVCp was not affected, which suggests that WNVCp could bind to Hsp70 as a binding partner rather than binding to unfolded substrates. Furthermore, Hsp70 could directly bind to WNVCp independently of ATP. WNVCp could function as a negative regulator of Hsp70 by binding to its substrate binding domain (SBD) To further confirm the interaction between Hsp70 and WNVCp, we carried out refolding assays using purified Hsp70 and Hdj1 as folding mediators and b-gal and luciferase that had been chemically denatured by guanidium-HCl as substrates. This assay allows us to examine whether WNVCp could still bind to Hsp70 in the presence of its co-chaperone, Hsp40, and whether it could still function as a regulator of Hsp70. The data indicated that WNVCp was able to suppress 50% of the b-gal folding activities of Hsp70 when the ratio of WNVCp and Hsp70 was 1:1. When the ratio of Hsp70 and WNVCp was 1:2, the folding of bgal was almost completely suppressed, indicating that WNVCp could function as a potent inhibitor of Hsp70 inhibitor ( Fig. 2A) . Similar results were obtained using luciferase as unfolded substrate (Fig. 2B) . The regulation of Hsp70 by the Hsp70 partner proteins could take place through their binding to ATPase domain or SBD of Hsp70. For example, Hop, SGT, and TPR are individually known to interact with Hsp70 through its conserved carboxyl-terminal EEVD regulatory motif, while Bag1 and Hip interact with the ATPase domain [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] 11, 18, 26] . To examine the domain of Hsp70 responsible for binding with WNVCp, we purified the recombinant ATPase domain or SBD of Hsp70 (Fig. 1A) . The data indicated that the SBD was responsible for the interaction between Hsp70 and WNVCp (Fig. 3A) . Because WNVCp binds to the SBD, we further tested 3 and 4) of ATP, and protein complexes were precipitated (P: precipitated, lanes 2, 4, and 6) by Ni 2+ -agarose. Precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining. (C) Reaction mixtures containing Hsp70 (0.5 lM) and luciferase that had been chemically denatured by guanidium-HCl (0.5 lM) (lanes 1-4) were incubated (T: total, lanes 1 and 3) in the absence (lanes 1 and 2) or presence (lanes 3 and 4) of ATP, and protein complexes were precipitated (P: precipitated, lanes 2, 4, and 6) by Hsp70 antibody (5a5). Precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using mono-Hsp70 mouse (5a5) and poly-luciferase rabbit (L0159) antibodies. (D) The plasmid expressing HA-WNVCp was transfected into 293T cells. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA mouse antibodies. The whole cell extract (WCE) and immunoprecipitates (IP) were detected using anti-HA rabbit and anti-Hsp70 mouse antibodies. whether the carboxyl-terminal EEVD motif was required for the interaction between the two proteins. The EEVD motif is considered to be important for its role in linking the SBD and ATPase domain of Hsp70, which enables the crosstalk between the two domains [2] . Furthermore, this motif is considered important for the refolding activities of Hsp70, since the lack of this motif terminates the refolding activities of Hsp70 [2] . To identify the role of EEVD motif in the interaction between Hsp70 and WNVCp, we employed the HSP70AAAA mutant. In this mutant, the four amino acids, EEVD, of the C-terminus are changed to AAAA [2] . When this mutant was purified as a recombinant protein, it was easily degraded to the ATPase domain and SBD [2] . Thus, the purified proteins displayed both full-length Hsp70AAAA and ATPase domain (Fig. 3B) . The data showed that this mutant was not able to bind to WNVCp, which suggested that the C-terminus might function as a motif for the interaction with WNVCp (Fig. 3B) . WNVCp has been known to localize to the nucleoli when expressed alone [24] . Thus, we next tested whether the expression of Hsp70 could affect the localization of WNVCp. When both proteins were expressed, we found that WNVCp, usually localized to the nucleoli, was dispersed into the cytoplasm (Fig. 4) . These results indicate that WNVCp could interact with Hsp70 in the cells. 1 and 3) , and protein complexes were precipitated (P: lanes 2 and 4) by Ni 2+ -agarose. Precipitated proteins were analyzed as described in Fig. 1B. Furthermore, the interaction seems to affect the cellular localization of WNVCp from the nucleoli to the cytoplasm. It is not certain, however, whether Hsp70 participates in the nuclear export of WNVCp or inhibits its localization of WNVCp into the nucleoli. Taken together, WNVCp was able to bind to the substrate domain of Hsp70 and inhibited its folding activities. Conversely, Hsp70 seems to be able to induce the cytoplasmic localization of WNVCp through direct interaction. Hsp70 has a protective role against the cytotoxic effect of WNVCp Various viral proteins have been known to localize to the nucleoli, which could strategically aid in the propagation of many viruses. These proteins usually participate in the disruption of cytokinesis of mammalian cells, as seen in the N protein of the coronavirus and the capsid of human hepatitis B virus [27, 28] . It is also likely that the WNVCp might have disruptive activities against mammalian cells by localizing to the nucleoli. Moreover, the prevention of the nucleolus localization of WNVCp by Hsp70 might protect cells from the cytotoxic effect of WNVCp (Fig. 4) . To examine the cellular effect of WNVCp, we transfected the plasmid expressing WNVCp into the 293T cells and observed the cell cycle in the 293T cells. The data showed that WNVCp-induced G 2 arrest in 293T cells ( Fig. 5A and B, lane 2) . When Hsp70 was co-expressed, the cytotoxic effect of WNVCp was extinguished, which indicates that Hsp70 has a protective role against WNVCp ( Fig. 5A and B, lane 4) . It is assumed that, by forming a complex, Hsp70 inhibited the localization of WNVCp to the nucleoli and prevented the cytotoxic effect of the viral protein. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that Hsp70 is able to indirectly protect the cells from cytotoxic effects imposed by WNVCp, since Hsp70 generally functions against various stresses exerted on cells [1] . Our findings suggest that WNVCp could function as a negative regulator of Hsp70 chaperone activities by binding to the substrate binding domain of Hsp70 (Fig. 2) . At the same time, the cellular stresses imposed by WNVCp could be protected against by the ectopic expression of Hsp70 (Fig. 5) . WNVCp does not seem to bind to Hsp70 as an unfolded substrate, which could prevent its chaperoning of other substrates, as ATP did not have any effects on the binding abilities of Hsp70 and WNVCp (Fig. 1) . Thus, it is possible that Hsp70 might function as a negative regulatory protein of WNVCp, which weakened the cytotoxic effects of WNVCp. However, it is still not clear from these studies whether the toxic effect of WNV itself could be prevented by the overexpression of Hsp70. Furthermore, it has not yet been determined whether infection with WNV induced the expression of Hsp70, which, in turn, might function to protect cells from WNV-induced death. However, our studies suggest the possible role of Hsp70 as a protector of the cell against infection with WNV through the suppression of one of the toxic proteins of WNV. Although further studies are required to determine the detailed mechanistic pathways involved in the relationship between Hsp70 and WNV infection, this is a novel finding that suggests how WNV protein could be negatively controlled by the proteins of host cells. We expect that this finding will aid investigators in identifying the mechanistic pathway of how mammalian cells adjust to the WNV infection.
