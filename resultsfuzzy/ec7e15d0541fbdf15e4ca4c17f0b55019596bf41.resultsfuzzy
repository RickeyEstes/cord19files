Previous studies have highlighted the difficulties attending the differential functionalization of the hydroxyl groups present within the lycorine series (Takeda et al., 1958) . Previous work in our group has shown that highly selective mono-silylation of 1,2-diols can be achieved under certain conditions (McNulty and Mao, 2002) . The reaction of lycorine 2 with tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and pyridine in dichloromethane (DCM) (Scheme 2) was therefore investigated. To our delight, this reaction afforded the novel monosilyl ether 7 (in 82% yield), most likely due to the greater reactivity of the allylic pseudoequatorial 2-hydroxy group over the axially-orientated C-1 hydroxyl. The 1 H NMR spectrum of 7 (see Section 3) had the H-2 signal at d 4.29 (dd), upfield-shifted from d 5.37 (dd) where it resonates for lycorine (2) while COSY contours were established between H-2 and both H-1 (d 4.43, dd) and H-3 (d 5.42, dd). In addition, three-bond HMBC showed H-2 to be correlated to both C-4 (d 142.01, s) and C-10b (d 41.20, d) . Direct access to 7 allowed us to prepare the new allylic acetate 8, which was obtained in near quantitative yield from silyl ether 7 upon acetylation with acetic anhydride and pyridine, and its 1 H NMR spectrum showed the expected deshielding effect on H-1 (d 5.56, dd). Desilylation of 8 proceeded smoothly with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to give 1-acetyllycorine 9, the proton spectrum of which indicated a slight upfield shift for H-2 (d 4.15, dd) compared to 8, whose spectroscopic data (mpt, a D , IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR) was similar to literature values (Kobayashi et al., 1984) . Acetylation of 9 then provided in 97% isolated yield 1,2-diacetyllycorine 10 which had the H-2 signal at d 5.25 (dd) and its spectroscopic data were in close agreement with documented values (Kobayashi et al., 1984 . The minipanel of synthetic compounds 7-10 together with natural products lycorine 2 and pseudolycorine 6 were then screened for their ability to induce apoptosis in human leukemia (Jurkat) to $45% at 10 lM while the other analogues (7,8,10) exhibited indices at control levels. Nuclear morphological changes characteristic to apoptosis were visualized by Hoechst staining (Figs. 2 and 3), by which condensed nuclei of cells affected by the treatment are more fluorescent and fragmented in appearance. In parallel with Hoechst staining, cells were also treated with Trypan Blue, to evaluate the extent of necrotic cells, and subjected to Annexin-V binding assays as a further indication of the induction of programmed cell death (data not shown). The mild activity ($45%) exhibited by 1-acetyllycorine 9 indicates that a small substituent at C-1 is partly tolerated. Overall, it is clear from these results that a free ring-C 1,2-diol is required in the lycorine series (lycorine and pseudolycorine) for potent apoptosis-inducing activity since both the monosubstituted silyl ether 7 as well as disubstituted analogues (8 and 10) were all inactive. In the present study, apoptosis initiation was retained upon replacement of the 8,9-methylenedioxy group in lycorine 2 by 8-methoxy-9-hydroxy substituents in pseudolycorine 6. This is in contrast to the observation of Rinner et al. (2004) where substitution of the methylenedioxy group in pancratistatin 5 led to a 10 to 100-fold drop in activity. Intriguingly, the phenanthridine nucleus is common to the crinane, lycorine and pancratistatin series of compounds; with the N to C-10b ethano bridge common to crinane compounds and the N to C-4 ethyl tether characteristic of lycorine compounds. The present results also draw attention to the subtle, often critical nature of the region around the C-4a, C-10b ring junction. In the crinane alkaloid series, the apoptosis-inducing ability of the a-series far superseded those of the b-series (McNulty et al., 2007a (McNulty et al., , 2009 ) in all of the cases examined. The presence of a C-1,C-10b double bond in the pancratistatin series, such as narciclasine, is known to have no detrimental effect on its anticancer activity profile (Rinner and Hudlicky, 2005) . We have also demonstrated the mildly modulating influence of the C-1,C-2 double bond in the a-crinane compounds (McNulty et al., 2007a (McNulty et al., , 2009 . The introduction of a sp 2 hybridized carbon at the ring junction appears to introduce only a minor conformational effect on the pharmacophore. The C-3, C-4 double bond in lycorine 2 may play a similar conformational role to that in the crinane and pancratistatin series since dihydrolycorine derivatives have also been shown to possess activity (Jimenez et al., 1976) . The overall results (Fig. 1 ) superficially appear to be reminiscent of the strict requirement for apoptosis induction in pancratistatin 5, in which a minimum of three free hydroxyls in ring C is necessary for activity . However the 1,2-dihydroxy groups present in lycorines 2 and 6, which we now show to be required for activity, have the opposite absolute configuration to analogous positions as found in pancratistatin. Furthermore, the C-4a and C-10b ring junction in lycorines 2 and 6 is also opposite in configuration to that found in pancratistatin. Given the strict requirements of the ring-C hydroxyl groups that are known for activity in the pancratistatin series, it is remarkable to note that ent-pancratistatin derivatives have also been shown to have only slightly reduced anticancer activity (Hudlicky et al., 2002) . While removing a single hydroxyl group may result in inactive compounds, changing the absolute configuration of the entire molecule can result in retention of activity. These results demonstrate the importance and high sensitivity of the ring-C region in modulating cytotoxicity and heightens the possibility that all of these compounds (pancratistatin, ent-pancratistatin, narciclasine and now also the lycorines), may act upon the same biological receptor. In conclusion we have demonstrated the selective mono-silylation of the C-2 hydroxyl group in the alkaloid lycorine 2. This work allowed for the synthesis of a mini-library of differentially functionalized 1,2-diol lycorine derivatives. Biological assaying of these compounds demonstrated that the free 1,2-diol is a pharmacophoric requirement for induction of apoptosis in the lycorine series. Comparisons are drawn between this activity and that demonstrated by the pancratistatin/ent-pancratistatin structural types that may indicate a common pharmacophore, drawing attention to the critical nature of the ring-C region (stereochemistry and functionality) and subtleties that are manifest. Further structureactivity studies and biological assays aimed at elucidating the mechanism of action of these derivatives is in progress in our laboratories. Based on the structural similarity of the active compounds to that of pancratistatin, one can hypothesize that these compound could trigger apoptosis by activating Fas-associated Caspase-3, or by destabilizing mitochondria in Jurkat cells as has been previously observed (Griffin et al., 2007; McLachlan et al., 2005) . A significant amount of work must be done to delineate the biochemical mechanism of induction of apoptosis by these compounds.
