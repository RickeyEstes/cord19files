To determine whether the reduction of cyclin D1 protein was caused by replicating virus or as a cellular response to the presence of virus particles, the amount of cyclin D1 protein from IBV infected or UV-inactivated virus treated cells was compared to that of mock-infected cells (Fig. 1A) . Densitometric analysis indicated there was an approximately 14-fold reduction in the level of cyclin D1 protein in IBV-infected cells com-pared to either mock-infected or cells treated with UVinactivated virus (data not shown). This data are in contrast to the retrovirus, HIV, and DNA virus, cytomegalovirus, which can cause cell cycle perturbations in the absence of replicating virus [28, 29] . UV-inactivation of IBV was determined by Western blot analysis to detect viral proteins (Fig. 1A) and RT-PCR to viral RNA (data not shown). No viral RNA or their products were detected in cells treated with UV-inactivated virus. Real-time RT-PCR (TaqMan) was used to quantify the amount of cyclin D1 mRNA between mock-infected, UV-inactivated virus treated and IBV-infected cells. Total RNA was prepared from the three separate experiments and cyclin D1 mRNA from each sample analyzed in triplicate. Representative data from one experiment is shown (Fig. 1B) . There was no significant difference in the level of cyclin D1 mRNA Fig. 5 . Confocal microscopy analysis of the sub-cellular localisation of cyclin D1 (green) in mock and IBV-infected (red) asynchronously replicating cells at the times indicated post-infection. Antibody controls are also presented with the corresponding transmission phase contrast images. between each population, suggesting the reduction of cyclin D1 in IBV-infected cells is post-transcription. To confirm that real-time RT-PCR could distinguish between different levels of RNA, the amount of virus RNA was assayed at 0, 1, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h pi, using primer and probe sets to detect viral genomic RNA. The results indicated that there was an approximately 8-fold increase in viral genomic RNA between 1 and 24 h post-infection (each 40-C t value indicates a twofold difference) ( Table 1 ) and demonstrated that real-time RT-PCR can distinguish changes in RNA levels. Although IBV will infect dividing cells one of the major targets of infection is the upper epithelial cell layer [30] which contains quiescent cells in the G0 phase of the cell cycle. In order to model this, Vero cells were enriched in the G0 phase of the cell cycle by serum starvation which was confirmed by flow cytometry [6] (Fig. 2A) , resulting in an average of 87% of cells in the G0 phase, 10% in the S phase and 3% in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. This compared to non-confluent asynchronously growing cells, in which an average of 58% of cells are in G0/G1, 38% in S phase and 4% in the G2/M phase (data not shown and [6] ). The cells were then simultaneously released and treated with either UV-inactivated virus or infected with IBV and the levels of cyclin D1 protein (determined by Western blot) and mRNA (determined by TaqMan as per above) compared to that of mock-infected cells at 24 h post-infection and release. The data indicated that the amount of cyclin D1 protein was reduced in IBV infected cells compared to mock-infected or UV-inactivated virus treated cells (Fig. 2B) . However, the level of cyclin D1 mRNA was not significantly different for cells either treated with IBV or UV-inactivated virus or left untreated (Fig. 2C) . However, there was an approximately fourfold increase (two 40-C t values) in cyclin D1 mRNA in these cells compared to cells at 0 h (Fig. 2C) , which may reflect an increase in mRNA and protein synthesis due to entry into the cell cycle. Cyclin D1 mainly functions during the G1 phase and at the G1/S phase transition before being rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin pathway during S phase [17] . Cyclin D1 levels then begin to rise again in the G2/M phase. Therefore, we investigated the effect on cyclin D1 mRNA and protein in IBV-infected cells which had been enriched at either the G1/S or G2/M phase border. Vero cells were enriched in these phases using, either a double thymidine block or nocodazole treatment [6] . After treatment, cell cycle profiles were determined using dual flow cytometry and the data indicated that the cells had been enriched at the G1/S or G2/M phase border (Figs. 3A and 4A, respectively). For double thymidine treated cells there were an average of 88% of cells in the G1 phase, 3% in S phase and 9% in the G2/M phase, and in cells treated with nocodazole, there were an average of 20% of cells in G1, 23% in S phase and 57% in the G2/M phase, as described previously [6] . The cells were then simultaneously released and treated with either UV-inactivated virus or infected with IBV and the levels of cyclin D1 protein (determined by Western blot) and mRNA (determined by TaqMan as per above) compared to that of mock-infected cells at 24 h post-infection and release. The data indicated that the amount of cyclin D1 protein was reduced in IBV-infected cells compared to mock-infected or UV-inactivated virus treated cells for both cell cycle conditions (Figs. 3B and 4B ). There was no significant difference in the levels of cyclin D1 mRNA for both conditions (Figs. 3C  and 4C ). This mirrored the observations of cyclin D1 protein and mRNA in asynchronously growing and G0 enriched Vero cells, and indicated that reduction in cyclin D1 levels by IBV was not dependent on the cell cycle stage at the time of infection. Interestingly, in the cells enriched in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle whilst the amount of cyclin D1 protein was greater in mock-infected cells at 24 h post-infection compared to 0 h, in infected cells the amount of cyclin D1 remained unchanged compared to that at 0 h. This result could be attributed to the fact that in uninfected cycling cells cyclin D1 is rapidly degraded in S phase and then increases again in the G2 phase [31] , whereas IBV arrests cells in the early G2 phase of the cell cycle [6] and therefore cyclin D1 levels may not have started to increase. Previous Western blot data indicated that cyclin D1 protein levels were significantly reduced in infected cells by 24 h postinfection [6] . Immunofluoresence analysis of cyclin D1 in infected cells indicated that cyclin D1 protein was less than in mock-infected cells from 4 h post-infection and was absent from the nucleus by 24 h post-infection, reflecting the Western blot analysis (Fig. 5) . However, at early time points there are insufficient cells infected to distinguish cyclin D1 changes by Western blot analysis. Therefore, to study the degradation of cyclin D1 protein by Western blot analysis coupled to confocal microscopy time points post-16 h infection were utilised. In replicating cells, cyclin D1 can be phosphorylated on Thr286 by glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3b) promoting nuclear export and subsequent degradation in the cytoplasm [32, 33] . However, cyclin D1 can also be exported for degradation independently of GSK3b via unknown mechanisms [34] . To distinguish between these two possibilities, cells were either mock or infected with IBV and then treated at 8 h post-infection with varying concentrations of LiCl, which have been shown to decrease GSK3b activity [35] . Western blot analysis was used to detect cyclin D1, IBV and GAPDH proteins. The data indicated that the amount of cyclin D1 protein was greater in LiCl treated mock-infected cells compared to IBV-infected cells (Fig. 6A) and this was reflected in the accumulation of nuclear cyclin D1 as revealed immunofluoresence analysis (Fig. 6B) . Increasing concentrations of LiCl resulted in a dose dependent increase in the amount of cyclin D1 protein in both mock and infected cells. This indicated that there was a population of cyclin D1 whose nuclear export was GSK3b dependent. However, in IBV infected LiCl treated cells the amount of cyclin D1 was less than in mock-infected cells and therefore indicated that a population of cyclin D1 was still being targeted for degradation. Cyclin D1 is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm via the exportin CRM-1 [36, 37] . To test whether this was the case in IBV-infected cells, mock and infected cells were treated with the CRM-1 inhibitor, leptomycin B (LMB). To confirm that the LMB treatment was active in these experiments, an RNA export assay was used based on the export of HIV-1 REV that utilizes the CRM1 pathway [19] . A luciferase gene was placed within an inefficiently spliced intron that contained the REV response element (creating plasmid pLUCSALRRE). The pre-mRNA is normally retained in the nucleus and the exported, spliced mRNA lacks the luciferase gene. Export is facilitated through co-expressing HIV-1 Rev protein under the control of a CMV promoter (plasmid pRev), which ensures that the pre-mRNA is actively exported through the CRM1 pathway and luciferase activity would therefore be detected. The presence of LMB would inhibit the REV-dependent mRNA export, confirming that LMB treatment of cells was effectively blocking the CRM1-dependent export pathway. Therefore, in order to assess the activity of LMB Vero cells were transfected with pLUCSALRRE with or without LMB and also in the absence and presence of pRev (Fig. 7A) . The data indicated that in the absence of pRev there was no signif-icant difference in luciferase activity between LMB treated or untreated cells, and this level was taken as background activity. In contrast, when the pRev protein was present, the level of luciferase was 70% less in LMB treated cells compared to untreated cells, indicating that LMB reduced CRM1-mediated export. Immunofluoresence analysis indicated that in mock-infected cells in the presence or absence of LMB cyclin D1 was retained in the nucleus (Fig. 7B) . Whereas in the presence of LMB in infected cells cyclin D1 was observed in the nucleus, although to a lesser extent. (Fig. 7B) . The stabilising affect of LMB on cyclin D1 in infected cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 7C) . To test whether degradation of cyclin D1 in virus infected cells was mediated via the cellular proteosomal pathway cells were either mock or infected with IBV or treated with UVinactivated virus, and then treated 8 h post-infection with the proteosomal inhibitor MG132. This inhibitor has been used to investigate ubiquitin mediated degradation of cyclin D1 in coxsackie virus infected cells [38] . Western blot analysis was used to detect cyclin D1, GAPDH and IBV proteins. The data indicated more cyclin D1 protein in MG132 treated cells compared to untreated (Fig. 8A) , which was confirmed by immunofluoresence analysis of both mock and infected cells in the presence and absence of MG132 (Fig. 8B ). This indicated that in both mock and IBV infected cells the degradation of cyclin D1 was dependent on the cellular proteosomal pathway. However, as the amount of cyclin D1 in IBV infected cells was less than in mock infected cells treated with MG132 there may be a population of cyclin D1 that is being degraded via an unknown mechanism. In the presence of 5 mM LiCl and 10 lM MG132 cyclin D1 levels were part stabilised in IBV infected cells as revealed by both Western blot and immunofluoresence analysis ( Fig. 9A and B, respectively) (although there as variation on a cell to cell basis indicated by immunofluoresence). Although the treatment of infected cells with LiCl, MG132 or LMB results in the increased stabilisation of cyclin D1 compared to untreated infected cells, there is still less cyclin D1 than when compared to mock-infected treated cells, indicating that a viral protein and/or signalling pathway may be responsible for the export of cyclin D1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for its subsequent degradation. One candidate viral protein, could be the IBV N protein which can traffic between the nucleolus and the cytoplasm [22, 26] and interactions with the nucleolus and its proteins may be one mechanism by which RNA viruses can disrupt the cell cycle [39] . IBV N protein is a phospho-protein which binds RNA with high affinity [40, 41] . In the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), N protein has been shown to interact with cyclin D1 in cells expressing N protein [12] . To investigate whether IBV N protein could interact with cyclin D1 co-localisation studies using confocal microscopy and pull down studies were performed. However, no co-localisation was observed in cells expressing IBV N protein tagged to the fluorescent fusion protein, EGFP (Fig. 10A ). This may have been due to the fact that IBV N protein localises principally to the cytoplasm and nucleolus, rather than the nucleus [26, 42] , which is in contrast to cyclin D1 which is predominately nuclear, therefore the two molecules could not interact. To test this hypothesis a mutant EGFP-tagged N protein was used in which the nuclear export signal had been deleted and whose localisation was nuclear and nucleolar [26] . However, no co-localisation was observed (Fig. 10B) . Likewise, cyclin D1 was tagged N-terminally with ECFP, which resulted in the accumulation of the fusion protein predominately in the cytoplasm. Transfection of cells with this plasmid and also expressing EGFP-IBV N protein indicated that no co-localisation was observed between these two proteins in the cytoplasm (Fig. 10C) . No interaction was also found with a biochemical pull down of cell extracts using a recombinant his-tagged N protein [40, 43] anchored to a solid matrix as a target (data not shown). Whereas as a control N protein could pull down the tumour suppressor protein p53 (Fig. 10D ) which we have shown previ- ously co-localises with N protein [44] . Likewise IBV N protein co-localises with and can pull down nucleolin [15, 26] . The possibility remains that other viral proteins could direct the trafficking of cyclin D1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This study demonstrated that actively replicating IBV is required to decrease cyclin D1 and that this change is regulated post-transcription. This may be mediated by the arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle of infected cells prior to the stage when cyclin D1 levels would usually begin to rise. Furthermore, in infected cells cyclin D1 is redistributed from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where we hypothesize it is targeted for degradation, by a viral protein dependent trafficking pathway. However, the precise mechanism of this pathway remains to be determined.
