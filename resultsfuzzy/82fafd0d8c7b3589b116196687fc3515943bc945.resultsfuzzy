3.1. Coughing velocity vector measurement 17 males and 9 females were instructed to cough three times at the front side of the rectangular chamber in order to measure the initial exhalation velocity distribution. Fig. 2 shows an example of the coughing velocity vector change per time when a person coughs once. The position of the mouth of the tested person is at 100 mm on the y-axis in the figure, and the x-axis represents the distance from the mouth. The velocity vector was captured at each 70 ms as shown in Fig. 2 . For all 26 tested persons, 9 shots of velocity vectors for 560 ms were captured from each cough. Of these, three or four continuous shots showing the highest velocity distribution were assumed to be the initial velocity of the exhaled air from coughing. Fig. 3 shows the velocity size distribution in the x-axis direction of all velocity vector data obtained from four shots between 210 ms and 420 ms. The velocity at 0.5-1 m/s is most frequently observed possibly due to the addition of velocity vector from surrounding air, and hence, the maximum velocity of the exhaled air from coughing possibly ranges between 6 and 13 m/s. The velocities of the exhaled air from coughing by the adult males and females were separated into the x-axis direction velocity (u) and two y-axis direction velocity (v upward and downward). Each u and v velocity averaged from three times cough data was analyzed for all ranges and the sections that showed the highest velocity were selected. The selected velocity was averaged for all tested males and females separately and is shown in Fig. 4 . In the case of the males, the maximum u of the exhaled airflow from coughing was 14.4 m/s, while v was 5.2 m/s upward and À4.7 m/s downward. In the case of females, u was 10.1 m/s, while v was 2.7 m/s upward and À3.1 m/s downward. The coughing velocity vector combining u and v was 15.4 m/s (15.2 m/s downward) in the case of males, and the females showed around 70% of that of the males. The result is around 10% higher than the average air velocity (11.7 m/s) for both males and females observed by Chao et al. (2009) . The angle of the upward vector and downward vector was 19.9°and 17.9°for the males and 15°and 17.3°for the females, respectively. From the mouth, the angle of the coughed airflow was around 38°for the males and 32°for the females. The result is somewhat lower than the measured average angle (55°) reported by Gupta et al. (2009) .
