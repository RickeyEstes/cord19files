Editing and display of sequence differences in real-time BBB is primarily intended to be a sequence analysis tool focused on genome sequence comparisons, but the program also provides similar functionality to other alignment viewers and editors such as GeneDoc [15] and BioEdit [16] . BBB gives users the ability to load, correct and save alignments. Alignments loaded into BBB are easily edited by dragging sequences across the screen to insert Use of BBB to identify and correct small mis-aligned regions within alignments of large virus genomes Figure 1 Use of BBB to identify and correct small mis-aligned regions within alignments of large virus genomes. (a) Region of vaccinia virus (strain WR) and cowpox virus (strain Brighton Red) genomes aligned by DIALIGN2 (b) Manually corrected version of region shown in (a). Gaps and mismatched nucleotides are shown as red and navy blue boxes or bars in between the 2 sequences, respectively. and remove gaps; multiple sequences may be selected and edited as one. One of many unique features of BBB is that the main window displays the DNA or protein sequences together with flags that show all the nucleotide or amino acid differences that are present between the sequences shown in the window. This information provides very important visual cues as to the position of major and minor differences between the sequences in an alignment and is updated in real-time as the user makes edits to the alignments ( Figure 1 ). BBB provides a button to allow the user to skip through a sequence from one flagged nucleotide difference to the next, alleviating the need to scroll through an entire genome and detect the differences by eye. The sequence substitutions, insertions and deletions are flagged and color-coded in a single row between the pairs of sequences ( Figure 1 ). The program preferences can be set so that the difference data represents differences between each adjacent pair of sequences or to a consensus sequence calculated by BBB. In pairwise comparison mode, the first sequence is compared to the second, second to the third and so on, making BBB especially useful for visualizing evolution of sequences. When comparing to the consensus, the sequence differences indicated on the screen are those differences between each sequence and the consensus sequence, this allows for a global view of the alignment and easily identifies conserved/variable regions in genomes which is useful information in drug design and vaccine development. The consensus sequence generated from an alignment can also be saved to a file (FASTA format) for analysis with other software. During development, it was discovered that it was important to have the flags that highlight nucleotide differences updated in real-time as the user manually modifies the alignment. These flags are created for the displayed area only, and are then updated and augmented when needed, such as when the user changes the alignment, by inserting or deleting gaps, or changes the view, by scrolling or setting the display area. This enables BBB to work with multiple large genome sequences and keep an acceptable refresh rate for displayed data. A Block Glue option facilitates the movement of long sequence blocks that are bigger than the editing window by permitting the dragging of complete blocks without introduction of new gaps within the alignment. Often alignment errors are obvious to an experienced molecular biologist and the alignment can be manually corrected, simply by dragging the appropriate nucleotides into new positions. However, if there are doubts about the DIALIGN2 alignment or if there are a large number of sequences in the alignment, the user may choose to perform a local re-alignment of selected regions of the sequences using the ClustalW or T-coffee module of BBB. After the server completes an alignment, a new BBB window displays the new local alignment and the user is offered the option to import this new local alignment back into the original complete genome alignment. If required, forward and backward 3-frame translations of the DNA sequences can be displayed in the main sequence alignment window to help with alignment decisions. Methionines (green) and stop codons (red) are highlighted on the 3-frame translations, as are the genes that are associated with individual sequences through annotations in the BBB file. Figure 1 shows an example of a correction of a small mismatched region of two poxvirus genomes; breaking the single gap and moving the two resulting gaps reduces the number of mismatched nucleotides (not including those opposite a gap) from 10 to 3.
