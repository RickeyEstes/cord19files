Purity of synthetic and recombinant p7 protein Dye release assays have been previously performed with tagged p7 protein, either with FLAG [32, 33] or flu-antigen [25] . In our experiments we have used essentially tag-free p7, either synthetic or recombinant. The sequence of recombinant p7 protein used in the present work is shown in Fig. 1A , which includes 4 extra Nterminal residues (SNAM) [28] , whereas the sequence for the synthetic peptide started at Met (residue '0', Fig. 1A) . The fusion protein 6His-MBP-p7 was expressed at moderate levels after IPTG induction (Fig. 1B) . After purification using Ni 2+ -NTA resin (Fig. 1C) , the fusion protein was subjected to tobaccoetch virus (TEV) protease cleavage to remove 6His-MBP. Approximately 80% cleavage was achieved in 4 h (Fig. 1D) , and no further changes were observed after overnight reaction. The protein was successfully purified by RP-HPLC using an isopropanol gradient (Fig. 1E ). Pooled fractions were lyophilized and the purity was assessed by MALDI-TOF MS ( Fig. 2A) . Synthetic p7 was also purified by RP-HPLC (not shown) and the mass spectrum of the relevant fraction also shows one peak with the expected mass (Fig. 2B) . Both synthetic and recombinant p7 were subsequently lyophilized, and further resolubilized in methanol, HFIP, or other solvents, as indicated, prior to reconstitution in lipid bilayers. Effect of reconstitution protocol on p7 secondary structure The secondary structure of p7 was studied by using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy [34] comparing three methods of reconstitution: 'dialysis', 'direct' and 'addition' (see Materials and Methods). In these experiments, freeze-dried p7 was first solubilized in either methanol (M) or HFIP (H), to test the effects of these solvents on p7 conformation. Dialysis method. When recombinant p7 was first dried from HFIP, solubilized in detergent and reconstituted in DMPC lipid bilayers, the amide I spectrum showed that most of the protein is a-helical (trace H in Fig. 3A , henceforth referred to as form A), with a peak centered at 1658 cm 21 . In contrast, when recombinant p7 was solubilized first in methanol, a band centered at 1627 cm 21 appeared prominently, indicating an approximate 60/ 40% mixture of a-helix and b-strands, respectively (trace M in Fig. 3A , henceforth referred to as form B). Similar differences were observed using a synthetic form of p7 (not shown). Thus, regardless of the sample origin, a dramatic increase in b-structure is observed when the protein was pre-solubilized and dried from a methanol solution. For the a-helical form A, analysis of the amide I region showed that b-structure constitutes approximately 10-15% of the total, whereas the a-helix content was 73%, i.e., ,48 amino acids. This a-helical content is consistent with the reported 62% obtained for recombinant p7 in DHPC micelles [14] , the 70% obtained for synthetic p7 dissolved in 50% TFE [12] , and a recent NMR structure of a p7 variant in DPC micelles [20] , which is also mostly a-helical and roughly consistent with an a-helical hairpin model with two a-helical TM domains. In contrast, form B obtained after methanol solubilization showed b-structure and ahelical content of 40% and 55%, respectively. This corresponds to ,37 residues forming a-helices, too short to account for the two predicted a-helical TM domains, but too long for a single TM domain. Therefore, this sample is likely to contain incompletely, or incorrectly, reconstituted p7 protein. Direct method. When we used the direct method of reconstitution, i.e., without a detergent solubilization step, results were identical to the dialysis method. Specifically, samples dried from methanol (M) formed ,40% b-structure (Fig. 3B, curve 1) , whereas those exposed to HFIP (H) were mostly a-helical (data not shown). However, when that sample was subsequently vortexed, freeze-thawed, sonicated and repeatedly extruded, its b-structure content was reduced until the sample became mostly a-helical, i.e., form A (spectra 2-4 in Fig. 3B ). This phenomenon was also observed in samples that showed initially a high content of b structure obtained from dyalisis methods (Fig. 3A , see above) or by addition (see below). Addition method. The addition method is used in dye (CF) release assays [24] , where a small volume of solvent-solubilized p7 is added to preformed liposomes in aqueous buffer. In this case, p7 formed a significant (,40%) proportion of b-structure (Fig. 3C , see bands at 1635 and 1629 cm 21 ) regardless of the solvent used for p7 solubilization prior addition to liposomes: methanol, HFIP or TFE. The presence of b structure in the dyalisis and addition samples when methanol was used (Fig. 3A-B ) may be explained by comparison to the spectra of the dry p7 from HFIP or methanol solution (Fig. 3D) . In the first case, p7 was almost completely ahelical, whereas in the second case, p7 contained more than 50% of b-structure. However, the CD spectra of p7 in HFIP or methanol solution show no differences, with a high (,70%) percentage of helical structure (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that it is the drying procedure than induces b-structure formation, and not the solvent per se. This b-structure is retained even after reconstitution in lipids, unless the sample is extruded repeatedly afterwards. This also explains that when added to preformed liposomes, p7 adopts b-structure regardless of the solvent used (Fig. 3C) ; while p7 is predominantly a-helical in any of these solvents, poor incorporation of p7 in the bilayers after being briefly exposed to the aqueous environment results in bstructure formation.
