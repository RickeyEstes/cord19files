In this study, the opening of the mPTP was examined through application of the nonfluorescent, cell-permeant dye calcein-acetoxymethyl (AM), which is converted into the green-fluorescent dye calcein after acetoxymethyl ester hydrolysis by intracellular esterases. Figure 2A shows that overnight incubation of Vero cells with 0.003% H 2 O 2 induces massive loss of calcein from mitochondria due to pore opening. Thereafter a time course experiment was performed to identify mPTP opening during RV infection. Figure 2B indicates that, with 72 h post-infection as a rather late time point of infection, a notable portion of cells was positive for mPTP opening. Whereas the addition of z-VAD-fmk had no detectable influence on opening of the mPTP, the application of NIM811 and PFTµ appears to reduce its opening as indicated by an increase in the calcein signal ( Figure 2C ). To extend this data to Vero cells, Figure 2D highlights that after infection of A549 with RV, a loss of calcein from mitochondria was also observable at 3 dpi. The mitochondrial cyclophilin D (CypD) is a discussed regulatory component of the mPTP [21] [22] [23] . Taking this into account, the CPE induction by RV was assessed after overexpression of CypD and its PPIase mutants H168Q and R97A lacking the catalytic function as a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase. Figure 2E shows, that at 3 dpi and in comparison to the vector control (pcDNA3), overexpression of CypD and its PPIase mutants H168Q and R97A increases the number of floaters present in the supernatant of RV-infected Vero cells. In summary, at late time points of infection, RV induces a partial opening of the mPTP. Number of floaters was determined at 3 dpi in comparison to the vector control (pcDNA3).
