2.1. Synthetic chemistry C-5 substituted N-alkylazido-isatins 3 were prepared following our previously reported protocol [28] involving an initial basepromoted alkylation of isatins 1 with dibromoalkanes at 60 C in DMF to yield the corresponding C-5 substituted N-alkylbromoisatins 2. The subsequent treatment of 2 with sodium azide at 60 C resulted in the formation of the desired precursors 3 as depicted in Scheme 1. The precursors' 3 and ethnylferrocene 4 were subsequently utilized in the copper promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction to yield the desired 1H-1,2,3-triazole tethered isatinferrocene conjugates 5 [29] . The structure assigned to the hybrids 5 was confirmed on the basis of spectral data and analytical evidences. Compound 5f, for example, showed a molecular ion peak at m/z 458.0833 [M] Ã¾ while its 1 H NMR spectrum exhibited a singlet at d 4.08 corresponding to 5H (cyclopentadiene ring of ferrocene) along with singlets at d 4.31 (2H) and d 4.72 (2H) due to the ferrocene ring protons. The presence of a characteristic singlet at d 7.63 corresponding to the triazole ring proton ascertained the assigned structure which was further corroborated with the number of carbon atoms in the 13 C NMR spectrum.
