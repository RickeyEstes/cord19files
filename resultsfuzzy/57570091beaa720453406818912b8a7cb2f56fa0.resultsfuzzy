LC16m8 compared with that of other vaccines. Recently it was shown that with prolonged passaging in cell culture, LC16m8 undergoes a phenotypic reversion characterized by the production of plaques that are of intermediate size between wild-type LC16m8 and the precursor virus, LC16mO. This plaque-size heterogeneity can be mapped to the B5R gene where some variants exhibit point mutations upstream of the known B5R single-base deletion. These compensatory mutations correct the observed frameshift and lead to the reconstitution of a full-length B5R gene. Western blot analysis has confirmed a restored ability of these variants to produce a full-length B5R protein. In a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse LD 50 study, the pathogenicity of two revertant viruses and the LC16mO precursor strain was similar. In addition, plaque-purified LC16m8 and a construct of LC16m8 lacking the B5R gene were shown to have safety profiles comparable to that of MVA in the same animal models and to confer protective immunity in a mouse/intranasal vaccinia (Western Reserve [WR] strain) challenge study [47] . The specific clinical consequences that correlate with deleted or mutated genes in attenuated vaccinia strains are only just beginning to be studied. Orthopoxviruses are known to use a wide array of immunomodulatory strategies to establish a rapid and ongoing infection within the host [48, 49] . These mechanisms target the innate, humoral, and cellmediated immune pathways, using mechanisms as diverse as functional mimicry of host proteins, masking, and avoidance of innate antiviral pathways [48, 50] . It is not yet known what immunomodulatory mechanisms are used or altered by the attenuation of Lister to LC16m8. The complete genome sequences of the LC16m8, LC16mO, and Lister viruses have been published recently [33] and studies are underway to compare the genomic and proteomic profiles of this group with profiles of other orthopoxviruses.
