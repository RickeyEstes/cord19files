showed that the sequence homogeneity among the newly isolated strains (96.1-100%) was higher than that observed between the attenuated-type PEDVs and the newly isolated strains (89.6-98.8%). Likewise, the aa sequence alignment results showed a similar pattern (i.e., 96.7-100% among the current isolates and 91.1-100% between the attenuated-type PEDVs and the current isolates). More precisely, the newly isolated strain DR13 showed higher homology (97.2-98.7% for nt and 96.7-99.4% for aa) than both attenuated DR13 (89.6-90.7% for nt and 91.1-93.3% for aa) and CV777 (89.9-91% for nt and 91.1-93.3% for aa) (data not shown). A phylogenic tree was constructed using the ORF3 aa sequences from the newly isolated strains and the references isolates. All of the sequences were divided into four phylogenetic groups: group I contained current isolates and reference strain CH/S, group II contained reference strains DR13 and Chinju99, group III contained attenuated DR13 and CV777, and group IV current isolated strains GXNN04, GDJM02, GDHY01, and GDZJ05. Further analysis showed that the current isolated groups (I and IV) were independent of the reference strain groups (II and III) (Figure 2(a) ). Sequence analysis of the complete ORF3 genes showed that all of the newly isolated strains had intact ORFs that could regulate the translation of a 224 aa residues. Nevertheless, there was a large deletion region, approximately 51/49 nt (at positions 245-295/293), in the attenuated DR13 and CV777 PEDV, which accounted for the missing of 17/16 aa (YCPLLYYCGAFLDATI/I, at positions 83-98/97) ( Figure 2(b) ). The mutations observed at aa positions 7 (Q → X), 80 (V → F), and 182 (H → Q/Y) did not impact hydrophobicity (Figure 2(c) ). The Scientific World Journal isolates (CV777 and Chinju99), respectively. Meanwhile, the newly isolated strains showed 97.8-100% aa sequence homogeneity within the group and 95.6-98.7% and 97.3-98.7% when compared to those previously isolated Chinese strains and foreign strains, respectively.
