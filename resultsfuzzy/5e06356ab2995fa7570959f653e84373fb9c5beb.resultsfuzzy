The regression analysis and correlation coefficient of the results from the IgGr and IgGs ELISA and SNT on positive sera are shown in Fig. 1 . There was a very good positive correlation coefficient (r = 0.86, at P << 0.001) between the ELISA and SNT (for the 98 serum samples with ELISA units ~50) when data were subjected to simple linear regression analysis and the non-parametric rank correlation by the Spearman method.
