Sequence analysis of the 15 CCoV-I Greek strains in the 5' end of the S gene showed a 64.1-99.8% nucleotide (nt) and 60.6-99.6% amino acid (aa) identity to each other. The Greek strains shared the highest genetic relatedness with either one of the two CCoV type I reference strains, Elmo/02 (AY307020) and 23/03 (AY307021). According to the phylogenetic analysis result, the CCoV-I strains segregate with either Elmo/02 (2 strains, 84.9-87.2% nt identity) or 23/03 (74.1-92.8% nt identity), forming two unique clades of CCoV-I viruses. The strains AT/02/09/I/GR and AT/05/09/I/GR, detected in a pet shop outbreak, shared 63% nt identity to each other. All CCoV-I strains formed a separate clade within the same cluster of CCoV-I and FCoV-I viruses, which is separate from that of CCoV-IIa and FCoV-II (Fig. 2) . Sequence analysis of the 19 CCoV-IIa Greek strains in the 5' end of the S gene showed a 79.8-100% nt and 77.7-100% aa identity to each other. By excluding the strain ED/99/08/IIa/GR, the nt and aa identities among Greek CCoV-IIa viruses reached 99.7-100%. By BLAST, it was revealed that ED/99/08/IIa/GR shared the highest identity with the CCoV-IIa reference strain BGF10 (AY342160) (83.7%), while the rest of the strains showed the highest identity to CCoV-IIa reference strain CB/05(DQ112226).
