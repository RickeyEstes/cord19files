In order to mimic the first events of L. chagasi and dog PBMC interaction, the PIV stimulation assay was established in two steps, as previously described in mouse (Shankar and Titus, 1993; Soares et al., 1997) and human (Pompeu et al., 2001; Rogers and Titus, 2004) systems. In this report, PBMC were submitted to a primary course of stimulation by incubating with a low parasite ratio (1:1) followed by a second course of stimulation. Hence, PBMC primarily stimulated in vitro were harvested and then coincubated with autologous infected macrophages (10:1), which served as APCs, as previously described (Pompeu et al., 2001; Rogers and Titus, 2004) . First, experiments were conducted in order to determine the ideal conditions for the PIV assay. Dog PBMC were cultivated at different concentrations: 2.5 and 8 Â 10 6 cells/ml. In response to either ConA or L. chagasi stimulation, cultures at 8 Â 10 6 cells/ml displayed a significant reduction in cell viability after 4-6 days in culture, despite periodical reposition of medium. For in vitro priming, PBMC from non-exposed dogs were cultivated at 5 Â 10 6 cells/ml and were stimulated with one L. chagasi stationary-phase promastigote per cell for a period of 6 days. Cell viability was maintained at 99% as determined by trypan blue exclusion when half of the culture medium was replaced every day during the 6 days of primarily PBMC stimulation. Once the ideal conditions for the PBMC cultures were established, co-culture assays were performed. After 2 and 4 days of co-culture, the parasite load was quantified to determine the effect of PBMC stimulation on macrophage infection. In order to further characterize the nature of the PIV immune response of PBMC from these naïve dogs to L. chagasi, cytokine expression levels were determined after a second contact of these PBMC with the infected APCs. In a similar assay using human PBMC and macrophages, the in vitro system was capable of discriminating differences in immune responses from several non-exposed individuals to Leishmania (Pompeu et al., 2001) . In a previous work, we demonstrated that PBMC from immunized dogs produced factors able to stimulate macrophages to kill intracellular L. chagasi in vitro (Rodrigues et al., 2007) . We hypothesized herein that the macrophage response to L. chagasi co-cultivated with PBMC that had been subjected to primary stimulation in vitro would be a useful test to predict the immune responses of non-exposed dogs to Leishmania promastigotes or antigens. Hence, PBMC from the five naïve dogs that had been stimulated by L. chagasi were assessed for their ability to stimulate autologous macrophages to kill L. chagasi. In the present report, at 2 days of infection the parasite load in macrophages co-incubated with L. chagasistimulated PBMC (133.4 AE 11.8) was 2.3 times higher in comparison to that in cells incubated with unstimulated PBMC (58.3 AE 9.1) (Fig. 1A , one-way ANOVA, p < 0.01). This effect seems to be specific since ConA supernatant effect on parasite load (95.0 AE 14.2) was not statistically different from the effect of control unstimulated PBMC supernatant in infected co-cultured macrophages (58.3 AE 9.1). Finally, the enhancement in macrophage infection induced by L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC was reversed at 4 days of infection. Fig. 1B shows that, at this time point, macrophage response to infection did not differ among groups. It is possible that stimulated PBMC co-cultivated with infected macrophages produced cytokines that could control parasite infection by an effect dependent on cytokine accumulation in the cell culture supernatant. Previously, we have shown that macrophages cocultivated with PBMC from immunized dogs were able to produce NO, which correlated with an in vitro control of parasite infection (Rodrigues et al., 2007) . Different from our previous work (Rodrigues et al., 2007) , here we were not able to detect NO in cell culture supernatant. It is possible that in the present study co-incubation of macrophages with L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC from naïve dogs was not sufficient to induce detectable levels of NO by Griess reaction. To further characterize the dog's primary response to L. chagasi, the amount of IFN-g, IL-4 and IL-10 produced by these cells was assessed by ELISA. Since we were not able to detect cytokine in cell culture supernatants, presumably due to low cytokine secretion by primarily stimulated PBMC, qRT-PCR was used to determine cytokine expression levels in these PBMC that had been co-cultivated for 4 days with infected macrophages. Several works have demonstrated that qRT-PCR is a sensitive and reproducible assay that shows only minimal intra-assay variations (Hein et al., 2001; Listvanova et al., 2003; Tassignon et al., 2005) , and that it is especially useful to detect cytokine expression in experimental conditions, even when cytokines are not detected in cell supernatant (Hein et al., 2001) . Cytokine mRNA was normalized relative to expression of the housekeeping gene 18S rRNA and represented as log 2 of these values. It is generally accepted that IFN-g is needed for the control of and the protection from Leishmania infections. Evidence supports the notion that IFN-g is one of the Th1 prototype cytokines responsible for activating macrophages, leading to an efficient killing of the parasites (Murray, 1982; Murray and Nathan, 1999; Holzmuller et al., 2005) . Here, we observed that IFN-g mRNA expression levels by L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC coincubated with infected cells (median = 6.49; 95% CI = 5.08-8.19) ( Fig. 2A) are higher compared to the expression levels of unstimulated PBMC co-incubated with infected macrophages (median = 4.10; 95% CI = 1.17-7.29) (Friedman, p = 0.0417). This indicates that the enhancement of IFN-g expression is a specific L. chagasidependent mechanism. Independent of previous stimulation by L. chagasi, PBMC contact with infected macrophages induced higher IFN-g expression than control unstimulated PBMC co-incubated with uninfected macrophages, in which expression was very low (À0.15; 2.17, n = 2). Correlation analyses between IFN-g expression and the percentage of infected cells have been performed. As expected, IFN-g expression positively correlated with reduction in the percentage of infected macrophages when they were co-incubated with either unstimulated PBMC (p = 0.0088, r 2 = 0.42) or L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC (p = 0.0161, r 2 = 0.3699). These data show that the exposure of PBMC from naïve dogs to L. chagasi antigens leads to IFN-g expression levels that are related to the reduction of parasite infection in vitro. The IL-4 release in murine and human Leishmania infection models is related to Th2 response, and IL-4 production often occurs during disease progression (reviewed by Pompeu et al., 2001) . However, using a PIV murine model, we have shown that mouse PBMC stimulated with either L. major or L. amazonensis did not express IL-4 levels different from control cells, although these PBMC released IFN-g into the cell culture supernatant upon L. major stimulation (Veras et al., 2006) . The role IL-4 plays in the regulation of immunity in CVL is still poorly understood (Quinnell et al., 2001) . Previously, we have not detected differences in IL-4 expression by PBMC from immunized dogs, whether they were stimulated with L. chagasi in vitro or not (Rodrigues et al., 2007) . Similarly, we observed herein that, upon L. chagasi stimulation, PBMC Fig. 2 . IFN-g expression is up-regulated by PBMC from naïve dogs upon primary in vitro stimulation with L. chagasi. Quantitative mRNA of cytokine was determined by qRT-PCR of primary L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC and control unstimulated PBMC cultivated for 6 days and cocultivated for an additional 4 days with infected macrophages as described in Section 2. Each symbol represents a distinct dog donor: (*) Dog 2, (~) Dog 3, (!) Dog 4, (^) Dog 5, line = median value of IFN-g (A), IL-4 (B) and IL-10 (C) mRNA concentrations normalized to the concentration of the housekeeping gene 18S RNA expression represented as log 2 . To test statistical differences Friedman test followed by the Dunn's multiple comparisons post-test were used: L. chagasi-stimulated Â medium = *p < 0.05. expressed similar levels of IL-4 mRNA (median = 5.78; 95% CI = 0.53-8.86) compared to unstimulated PBMC (median = 4.38; 95% CI = 1.25-7.17) (Fig. 2B) . However, we have observed that IL-4 expression was higher when compared to the expression by the control unstimulated PBMC coincubated with uninfected macrophages (0.68; 2.61, n = 2). In this PIV system, IL-4 seems to collaborate with IFN-g in the control of parasite infection in vitro, since higher IL-4 expression positively correlates with control of parasite infection by macrophages co-incubated with either unstimulated PBMC (r 2 = 0.7973, p < 0.0001) or L. chagasi-stimulated cells (r 2 = 0.7167, p < 0.0001). This idea is also supported by the observation that a lower IFN-g/IL-4 ratio correlates with a lower percentage of infected cells when co-incubated with L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC (r 2 = 0.5997, p = 0.0007). It is plausible to propose that this direct correlation between the IFN-g/IL-4 ratio and parasite load is dependent on the higher correlation of both IFN-g and IL-4 expression with lower parasite infection. Several years ago, it was clearly demonstrated that IL-4 in the presence of low concentrations of IFN-g provides a strong stimulus for the killing of intracellular L. major . The synergism of IFN-g and IL-4 is apparently based on the ability of these lymphokines to induce the endogenous production of TNF-a . Recently, it has been demonstrated that extremely susceptible golden hamsters once immunized with a kinetoplastid membrane protein-11-encoding construct were protected in both pentavalent antimony responsive and antimony resistant virulent-L. donovani challenges. These animals were protected by a surge in IFN-g, TNF-a, and IL-12 levels, along with extreme down-regulation of IL-10. Expression of IL-4 was found to have a positive correlation to protection (Basu et al., 2005) . Recently, IL-10 has been clearly implicated in immunemodulation of murine and human models of VL (Nylen and Sacks, 2007) . The role IL-10 plays in CVL still is not very well defined (Lage et al., 2007; Santos-Gomes et al., 2002; Quinnell et al., 2001) . Here, we observed that IL-10 mRNA from L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC (median = 2.14; 95% CI = À1.69-8.00) was similarly expressed in unstimulated PBMC (median = 3.71; 95% CI = À1.72-9.18) (Fig. 2C ) either co-incubated with infected macrophages. This was similar to the IL-10 mRNA expression by un-stimulated PBMC coincubated with uninfected macrophages (3.71; 4.10). Interestingly, the co-incubation of infected macrophages with L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC neutralized the positive correlation of IL-10 expression with a decrease in infection that we observed in unstimulated PBMC that had been coincubated with infected macrophages. These data indicate that IL-10 seems not to participate in PIV stimulation of dog splenocytes. Similar to our work, no correlation with disease progression and IL-10 expression was observed in bone marrow cells from naturally infected dogs (Quinnell et al., 2001) or PBMC from experimentally infected dogs (Santos-Gomes et al., 2002) . In summary, we have established a PIV system with canine PBMC that allowed us to examine the early canine immune responses to L. chagasi infection. Briefly, when we co-cultivated L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC with infected macrophages, we found that IFN-g mRNA was up-regulated in these cells, compared to control unstimulated cells. IL-4 and IL-10 expression by L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC was similar to control unstimulated PBMC. Both higher IFN-g and IL-4 expressions by L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC and a lower IFN-g/IL-4 expression ratio correlated with reduction in the percentage of infection. Since this system allows the identification of canine primary immune responses, it could potentially be used as a screening test for the in vitro prediction of animal responses to vaccination or parasite infection.
