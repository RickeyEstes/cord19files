In the present study we overexpressed several long-loop S-crystallins of Octopus vulgaris in Escherichia coli. Only one of them, named OctS4, could be expressed and purified to homogeneity. However, efforts to crystallize the wild-type OctS4 were unsuccessful. Therefore, we modified the wild-type sequence by creating a number of mutants that are believed to be related to the binding of GSH or of electrophilic compounds (Extended data Fig. 1) . After a significant number of trials, a highly active mutant, Q108F, was successfully expressed and crystallized in the presence of GSH. We determined the crystal structure of the S-crystallin Q108F mutant at 2.35 Å resolution ( Fig. 1 and Extended data Table 1 ). A monomer of S-crystallin forms an asymmetric unit within the crystal, and a dimer of the protein that is similar to GST can be generated using a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis ( Fig. 1a and Extended data Fig. 2a) . Approximately 1600 Å 2 of the surface area of each monomer is buried in the interface of this dimer, comparing to 1300 Å 2 for the squid GST-σ 16 with 38% sequence identity to S-crystallin. Besides, the dimerization of S-crystallin and several of its mutants was confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation (Extended data Fig. 2) . The reported crystal structures of GST-σ are in complex with either 1-(S-glutathionyl)-2,4-dinitrobenzene (GSDNB) or S-(3-iodobenzyl) glutathione (GSBzI) 16 . In contrast to the above, we observed the presence of a GSH molecule within the active site of S-crystallin, located between the N-domain (β A to α 3) and C-domain (α 4 to α 10) of the protein (Fig. 1b) . There is a disulfide-bond between the thiol group of the GSH and residue Cys112 of S-crystallin. In addition, there is a polar interaction network (Fig. 1c) that consists of the glutamyl group of GSH interacting with residues Arg14, Gln64, Ser65 and Tyr97, the cysteinyl group of GSH interacting with residue Met51 and the glycinyl group of GSH interacting with residues His49 and Gly110. The two domains of S-crystallin are closer compared to those of GST-σ in complex with GSDNB; although the r.m.s distance between equivalent Cα atoms of the two structures is 1.3 Å (Fig. 2a) . When their N-domains are superposed, a difference of 3.5° can be seen in the orientation of their C-domains. Compared with the binding of GSH to S-crystallin, GSDNB has fewer hydrophilic interactions with GST-σ (Fig. 2b ). GSDNB has no interaction with residue Arg13 of GST-σ , which is equivalent to residue Arg14 of S-crystallin. In addition, due to the lack of a long loop between the α 4 and α 5 helices (residues 112 to 122), the glycinyl group of GSDNB does not interact with the C-domain of GST-σ , while its dinitrobenzyl group does have hydrophobic contact with Phe106. Similarly, the structure of GST-σ in complex with GSBzI indicates that the iodobenzyl ring of GSBzI is located in a hydrophobic pocket that consists of residues Phe98, Val102 and Phe106 (Extended data Fig. 3 ). Like other GSTs 17 , the different binding modes of the GSDNB and the GSBzI to GST-σ imply a more flexible active site that favors catalysis. In contrast, the equivalent residues in S-crystallin are Leu100, Met104 and Gln108, respectively (Fig. 2b ). These differences result in a collapsed pocket that may disfavor the binding of aromatic compounds. We characterized the GST activity levels of S-crystallin and its various mutants in order to evaluate the role of the above residues. Octopus GST-σ was purified from the digestive gland and then used as a standard for enzyme activity (Fig. 2c,d) . The GST catalytic activity (k cat ) of the wild-type S-crystallin is 0.24 s −1 , which is about the same to that of the S-crystallins purified from octopus lens 18 but only ~1/700, of that of GST-σ (it will be ~1/6000 if compared their catalytic efficiency by k cat /K m,CDNB ) ( Table 1) . Consistent with our structural observations, we found that the apparent binding affinity of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) to S-crystallin is lower than that with GST-σ , with an 8.3-fold increase in the K m,CDNB . By way of contrast, the apparent binding affinity of GSH with S-crystallin is significantly tighter than that with GST-σ , with a 43-fold decrease in K m,GSH . Kinetic analysis indicated that three single mutants, L100F, M104V and Q108F, have a higher k cat than that of wild-type S-crystallin with 10-to 44-fold increases, respectively (Extended data Fig. 4c ,d and Extended data Table 3 ). The K m,GSH of the L100F and M104V mutants of S-crystallin have 37-fold and 83-fold increases and are similar to that of GST-σ , while K m,CDNB of the M104V mutant shows a significant decrease and is almost identical to that of GST-σ (0.65 mM versus 0.47 mM). Interestingly, although the Q108F mutant of S-crystallin possesses the highest k cat among the three mutants, its K m,GSH is also very high and we were not able to estimate a reliable K m,CDNB due to unsaturated kinetic assays. This indicates that the mutation of Gln108 to Phe is beneficial for catalysis but is detrimental to the binding of the two substrates. These results suggest that, in order to obtain a more "GST-like" S-crystallin, no single mutant is suitable, but rather multiple mutations are necessary (see below). Another difference between S-crystallin and GST-σ occurs with residue Asp101, which is at the active center (Asn99 in GST-σ ) (Fig. 2b) . Although both residues are located in the vicinity of an arginine residue, the "charge-charge" interaction between Asp101 and Arg14 in S-crystallin is likely to diminish the important function of arginine residue, which is to stabilize the negatively charged intermediate state (the Meisenheimer complex) during catalysis 19 . Indeed, the mutation of Asp101 to Ala or Asn resulted in a minor increase in k cat in parallel with a decrease in the K m,CDNB of S-crystallin; albeit a 13-fold to 87-fold increase in K m,GSH (Extended data Fig. 4c ,d and Extended data Table 3 ). Mutation of other residues involved in the binding of GSH, such as Arg43 (to Lys) and His49 (to Asn) (Fig. 2b) , resulted in no significant differences in GST activity (Extended data Fig. 4a ,b and Extended data Table 3 ). On the other hand, based on our structural observations and our kinetic assays, the highly conserved residue Gln64 would seem to be essential for the binding of GSH and for catalysis ( Fig. 2b and Extended data Table 3 ). Next we focused on four key residues of S-crystallin, Leu100, Asp101, Met104 and Gln108, mutation of which resulted in large changes in catalysis or binding. The GST activity of the various double, triple and quadruple mutants of S-crystallin was characterized in order to delineate their mutual effects ( Table 3 ). The results suggest that, compared with of those from the single mutants, all double and triple mutants of S-crystallin have comparable or even higher k cat values, while there were no significant differences in the K m with GSH or CDNB. Furthermore, the quadruple mutant of S-crystallin, L100F/ D101N/M104V/Q108F, had the lowest K m,CDNB (0.18 mM) and the highest K m,GSH . Although there was only a 23-fold increase in activity for some unknown reason, the catalytic efficiency (k cat /K m,CDNB ) has a 518-fold increase (Table 1) . Nevertheless, based on the switch in the two substrate-binding affinities (increased K m,GSH and decreased K m,CDNB ) and the significant recovery of GST activity and catalytic efficiency, the double mutant D101N/Q108F and the quadruple mutant of S-crystallin would seem to result in a GST-like S-crystallin that has recovered GST activity and probably a more flexible active site 17 . In addition, another double mutant of S-crystallin, D101A/Q108F, showed the highest enzymatic activity in these mutants, which is only a 7-fold lower than that of GST-σ (Extended data Table 3 ). Our structure demonstrates that the long loop between the α 4 and α 5 helices of S-crystallin is able to bind to GSH through disulfide-bonding interaction via residue Cys112 and via a hydrogen bonding interaction with residue Gly110 (Fig. 1c ). Next we characterized the GST activities of the C112G and loop-deletion mutants of S-crystallin in order to evaluate the effect of these changes. Interestingly, the mutation of Cys112 to Gly did not influence the binding affinity of GSH to S-crystallin; although the GST activity of the mutant is 3-fold lower than that of the wild-type (Extended data Fig. 4a ,b and Extended data Table 3 ). This indicates that the disulfide bonding between S-crystallin and GSH is not essential for binding. This also helps to explain the observation that the equivalent residue in most other S-crystallins is a glycine 7,14 (Extended data Fig. 1 ). Not surprisingly, the deletion of the long loop (residues 112-122) resulted in an obvious decrease in the apparent binding affinity of GSH as with a 73-fold increase in K m,GSH but a similar k cat , compared to the wild-type S-crystallin (Extended data Fig. 4g ,h and Extended data Table 3 ). These features prompted us to make a mutant that consisted of the four key residues changed previously together with the loop deletion in order to generate a putative "ancestral" protein. However, other than the Δ loop/Q108F mutant of S-crystallin, the other mutations together with the loop deletion resulted in a low level of recovery of activity and poor binding affinity with GSH ( Fig. 2c ,d, Extended data Fig. 4g ,h and Extended data Table 3 ). Unlike the Q108F mutant alone form of the protein, the K m,CDNB of the Δ loop/Q108F mutant of S-crystallin can be precisely determined to be 1.9 mM. This suggests that existence of the long loop not only enhances the binding of GSH to S-crystallin but may interfere with the binding of electrophilic compounds. To understand the mechanisms by which changes in gene sequence generate shifts in function and therefore phenotype 20, 21 , it is necessary to analyze how the changes in protein structure mediate the effects that the mutations have on function 22 . Interestingly, a long-loop S-crystallin (OctS4) shows a significant increase in apparent GSH binding affinity compared to that of GST-σ . To evaluate the possible biological significances of such strong GSH binding, the thermal stability of S-crystallin without or with GSH was determined using circular dichroism spectrometry (Fig. 3a,b) . In the presence of GSH, the melting temperature (T m ) of S-crystallin was higher by 7 °C than that of the protein in the absence of GSH (Table 2) . Again, the mutation of Cys112 to Gly did not influence the T m enhancement in the presence of GSH (Extended Data Fig. 5a ,d and Extended Data Table 4 ). This indicates that the disulfide bonding between S-crystallin and GSH is not essential for this protection. Furthermore, denaturant-induced aggregation of S-crystallin was also observed using light-scattering analysis (Fig. 3c) . Our results suggested that S-crystallin aggregation is prevented by the presence of GSH in a dose-dependent manner. By way of contrast, GST-σ showed only a 1.7 °C increase in T m in the presence of GSH; although the T m of the free GST-σ is higher than that of the free S-crystallin. It indicated that GSH may not benefit to stabilize the GST-σ . Differently, previous studies have suggested that GSH binding is required to stabilize GSTP1-1 and Plasmodium falciparum GST [23] [24] [25] . The structural protection and aggregation prevention afforded to S-crystallin by GSH suggested that in the lens S-crystallin may bind to GSH and that this contributes to the overall stability of lens proteins. In addition, this explains why S-crystallin from the lens was unable to bind to a GSH affinity column in earlier studies 19, 26, 27 . Table 2 . (c,d) Denaturant-induced light scattering of S-crystallin (c) and its mutants (d). The aggregation traces of S-crystallin in 3.5 M urea without or with GSH at 1-2 mM were observed by light-scattering at 340 nm. The protein concentration was 10 μ M. The assays were repeated twice to ensure reproducibility.
