The method builds a large number of models (i.e., classifiers) that differ because of different rule selection parameters (i.e., criteria for selecting and excluding rules based on support, confidence, etc.) and different misclassification weights. The metrics (PPV, NPV, Sensitivity, Specificity, F 0.5 and F 3 ) for all classifiers are first computed on the fine-tuning data set. The two classifiers with the highest F 0.5 (emphasis on PPV) and the highest F 3 (emphasis on Sensitivity) on the fine-tuning data are selected as the final models computing predictions on the test data set. The results obtained when optimizing for PPV and when optimizing for Sensitivity are shown in Tables 4 and 5 , respectively. The most important results are the ones for the first test data set: this is the data set that is not used in training and finetuning the model, and that contains the same 40 provinces whose older data were used to develop the model. For the model with the optimized PPV (Table 4) , the test set PPV was 0.780 and the Sensitivity was 0.547. When all 81 provinces, including the ones with unreliable data reporting, were tested, both the PPV and Sensitivity showed small declines to 0.766 and 0.467, respectively. Thus, this model was able to generalize well even for provinces that were not used in training the model. Results obtained from the model optimized for Sensitivity on the test data from the 40 provinces in 2011 (Table 5) show a PPV and Sensitivity of 0.778 and 0.627, respectively. The PPV and Sensitivity for the 2011 data for all 81 provinces were 0.748 and 0.555, respectively. Once the prediction models described above were developed and finalized, data were obtained for 2012. These new data were pre-processed and used as input to the models previously trained (i.e., no re-training was performed) to obtain predictions for 2012. The results show that the model optimized for PPV (Table 4) , without any retraining, remains relatively robust: results are only slightly lower for 2012 than for 2011 data. The model optimized for Sensitivity (Table 5) shows more variation from 2011 to 2012 than the model optimized for PPV: Specificity and PPV stay at about the same level, whereas NPV and Sensitivity are decreased. This variation is also shown as a drop in F 3 values from 0.639 to 0.484. Overall, the models are relatively robust: their performance decreases gracefully when testing on data two years after the model training data, and when testing on data from provinces that were never used in training. Figure 5 . Incidence rate and predicted incidence rate for the province of Abra. Green bars correspond to prediction of LOW and red bars correspond to prediction of HIGH. When the incidence rate exceeds the threshold and a red bar is present, this corresponds to a TP; when the incidence rate is below the threshold and a green bar is present, this corresponds to a TN; when the incidence rate is above the threshold and a green bar is present, this corresponds to a FN. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002771.g005 Figure 5 shows the actual and predicted weekly incidence (4 week ahead prediction) for the province of Abra using the prediction model from Table 4 . There are two missed weekly HIGH incidences near 27 May 2011 and 27 September 2011, but most of the predictions are correct. Figure 6 shows the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for the dengue prediction models developed by the method presented. Figure 7 shows a map with the model prediction for the week 8/7-8/13/2011 made using data that would actually have been available on 7/10/2011. For 12 provinces, the predictions are HIGH incidence (shown in red) and for the remaining provinces the predictions are LOW incidence (shown in green). This type of map could be useful for public health professionals who would then have four weeks in which to prepare and implement mitigation strategies for the provinces predicted to have HIGH incidence. For comparison of these results with another simpler method, predictions were also made using a seasonal moving average method that uses only the weekly incidence values from the previous five years for prediction: When making a prediction for week k of the current year, note that week k-5 represents the most recent data values available for making a prediction 4 weeks in advance (similar to what our method uses). This seasonal moving average prediction (SMAP) is the average of the week k-5 dengue data from the current year and the week k dengue data from the four previous years. The results of the seasonal moving average prediction are shown in Table 6 . Figures 8 and 9 show a comparison between the SMAP model and FARM models optimized for PPV and Sensitivity, respectively. The FARM model performs better in terms of Sensitivity, F 0.5 , and F 3 on all data sets, and has a higher PPV on 2 out of 4 data sets. On the remaining two data sets, the higher PPV for the
