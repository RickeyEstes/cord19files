Adaptation of IBV from chicken embryos to Vero cells and analysis of the fusogenicity of S protein derived from the Vero cell-adapted IBV strain The Beaudette strain of IBV, grown in chicken embryos, was adapted to and serially propagated on monkey kidney cell line, Vero cells, for 65 passages [16] . A typical cytopathic effect (CPE) of coronaviruses, the formation of giant syncytial cells, was observed 2 days postinfection on the fourth passage and plaques formed 3 days postinfection after first three blind passages on Vero cells. Immunofluorescent staining of Vero cells infected with the third passage (EP3) in chicken embryos (p1), Vero cell passage 4 (p4), 6 (p6), 15 (p15), 36 (p36), and 65 (p65) showed that approximately 1%, 3%, 5%, 30%, 70%, and 75% cells, respectively, were positive (Fig. 1A) . Except in p1, the majority of these positive cells are in the form of syncytial cells (Fig. 1A) . These results clearly show that gradually increased infectivity of the virus to Vero cells was obtained. To assay the fusogenicity of the S protein derived from different passages of IBV, the S gene from EP3, p15, p36, and p65 was cloned into a plasmid under the control of a T7 promoter and expressed in Vero cells using a vaccinia/T7 expression system. As shown in Fig. 1B , the S protein of EP3 did not cause cell-cell fusion and syncytial formation; massive cell-cell fusion and syncytial formation were observed in cells expressing S protein derived from p15, p36, and p65. Under the condition used in this experiment, no apparent difference in the fusogenicity of the S protein derived from p15, p36, and p65 was observed (Fig. 1B) . These results demonstrate that adaptation of IBV to Vero cells increases the fusogenicity of the S protein.
