The mRPE65 protein model is shown in Fig. 1 as drawn by the VMD program. In this model, the mRPE65 protein has three domains and each domain consists of a righthanded twisted anti-parallel b-barrel, which is consistent with other reports in the literature (Chou et al., 1990a-c; Chou and Carlacci, 1991) . The hydrophobic interiors of these b-barrels are likely places to bind with the hydrophobic all-trans retinyl ester. Three palmitic acids bind with CYS231, CYS329 and CYS330 and their long carbon chains are all extended to the exterior of the protein. These long carbon chains are highly hydrophobic and prefer to reside in a hydrophobic environment, so it is expected that they will be located in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane and act as an anchor to immobilize the mRPE65 protein on the surface of the membrane. The model is shown in Fig. 2 as drawn by the VMD program. The sRPE65 protein is treated as a rigid body when the palmitic acid residues are added onto it because the binding site is remote from these residues and their main role is to anchor mRPE65 onto the surface of the membrane. Thus, it is very likely that the local conformational changes around the three palmitic acids will have little effect on the binding site of the protein. This strategy is similar to other investigations of pharmaceutically important proteins (Chou et al., , 2000 Chou, 1993 Chou, , 1994 Chou, , 2004d . Interestingly, the sRPE65 protein does not bind with any palmitic acids therefore its hydrophilic surface cannot be immobilized on the surface of the membrane and this may explain why mRPE65 is membrane associated but sRPE65 is cytosolic. The membrane association of mRPE65 may also give it an opportunity to interact with the all-trans retinyl ester buried in the membrane and extract it from the interior of the membrane to the hydrophobic interior of the protein. The three palmitic acids may also act to guide the all-trans retinyl ester into the protein. A similar mechanism for guiding a ligand into an active site and the channel of membrane protein is reported for the GABAA receptor (Chou, 2004a) and human potassium and sodium channels (Chou, 2004b) , respectively. This may explain the different binding affinities of mRPE65 and sRPE65 to all-trans retinyl ester. All-trans retinyl ester is highly hydrophobic and, therefore, it should be buried in a hydrophobic environment. In the model of the mRPE65 protein, the most favorable binding site for the hydrophobic all-trans retinyl ester is the hydrophobic interior of the b-barrel in each domain. Therefore, our model suggests that the binding site of the mRPE65 protein for all-trans retinyl ester should be located in the hydrophobic interior of the bbarrel in each domain. According to the docking energy results summarized in Table 1 , the binding site should be located in the b-barrel of domain two because the all-trans retinyl ester exhibits the lowest docking energy there. This conclusion is also supported by the observation that LEU450, whose mutation can cause dysfunction of mRPE65 (Kim et al., 2004; Wenzel et al., 2001) , is located at the b-barrel of this domain. LEU450 and TYR368 are very important to the binding of the all-trans retinyl ester because it has been observed experimentally that their mutations can cause dysfunction of mRPE65 (Kim et al., 2004; Wenzel et al., 2001; Yzer et al., 2003) . According to the docking energy results summarized in Table 2 , when the all-trans retinyl ester is docked near LEU450, its docking energy is lower than when it is docked near the center of domain two. The LEU450MET mutation also causes an increase in the docking energy when the all-trans retinyl ester is docked near residue 450. These results indicate that LEU450 is closer to the binding site than to the center of domain two and that LEU450 may be an intrinsic part of binding site. In contrast, when all-trans retinyl ester is docked near TYR368, its docking energy is higher than when it is docked near the center of domain two. The TYR368HIS mutation also causes a decrease of the docking energy when the all-trans retinyl ester is docked near residue 368. These results indicate that TYR368 is farther away from the binding site than the center of domain two and cannot be a part of the binding site. However the TYR368HIS mutation does increase the docking energy of all-trans retinyl ester when it is docked near LEU450 indicating this mutation can affect the binding site and the binding of all-trans retinyl ester. The binding site of mRPE65 for the all-trans retinyl ester was mapped by using the Autodock program and the Ligplot program. The docking energy results from this procedure are summarized in Table 3 . According to these results, the docking energy of the first iteration is substantially lower than those when the all-trans retinyl ester is docked near the center of domain two and LEU450 indicating this docking center is much closer to the binding site. The docking energy of the second iteration is also lower than the docking energy of the first iteration but it increases in the third iteration, therefore, the docking results of the second iteration were chosen as the binding site of mRPE65 for all-trans retinyl ester. The model of the binding site with the bound all-trans retinyl ester is shown in Fig. 3 Table 4 , both of these mutations cause the binding energy of all-trans retinyl ester to increase. These results may explain why these two mutations are observed to cause dysfunction of mRPE65. The van der Waals interactions are mainly responsible for favoring domain two as the domain containing the binding site for the all-trans retinyl ester. In other words, the size and shape of the binding site fit the ligand better than the center of domain two or the other domains. Hydrogen bonds also play an important role in the ligand binding as has been reported by others (Chou et al., 2000 (Chou et al., , 1999 (Chou et al., , 2003 (Chou et al., , 1997 Chou, 2004c Chou, , 2005 Chou, , 1992 . In our docking and Ligplot trials, THR457 in the binding site often forms hydrogen bonds with the binding ester to stabilize the complex. Furthermore, the mutations noted earlier also cause the internal energy of the all-trans retinyl ester to increase, implying that the ligand no longer fits well in the binding site of the mutants without added strain to its own structure.
