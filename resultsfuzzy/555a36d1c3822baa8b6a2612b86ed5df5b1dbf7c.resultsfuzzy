In order to study the initial disease progression and antibody response associated with MERS--CoV infection in rabbits, we infected nine New Zealand White rabbits with either a low dose (10 3 TCID 50 ) or high dose (10 5 TCID 50 ) of EMC/2012 (Fig 1) . None of the rabbits displayed overt clinical signs of illness in the 14 days following infection. Viral RNA titers were measured by qRT-PCR using primer pairs targeting the nucleocapsid protein (N3) and are reported as genome equivalents per gram of tissue [30] , as we found this method to be more sensitive and less variable than recovering infectious virus from infected rabbit tissues (Fig 2A and 2B and S1 Fig) as reported previously in the rabbit and other MERS-CoV animal models [22, 29] . We observed a transient infection following inoculation, with detection of viral RNA largely limited to the respiratory tract. In the nasal turbinates, viral RNA was detected only sporadically, although the titers increased after day 1 post-infection. In general, the higher dose of virus resulted in greater mean genome equivalent titers than infection with the lower dose of MERS-CoV (Fig 2A) . A dose-response was observed in the lower respiratory tract; with the 10 5 TCID 50 inoculum resulting in significantly higher titers than infection with 10 3 TCID 50 of virus on days 1 and 3 post-infection ( Fig 2B) (p values of 0.03 and 0.0001 respectively). Following primary infection with 10 5 TCID 50 , mild inflammation involving the perivascular, peribronchiolar, and alveolar interstitial regions was observed in the lungs at day 3 postinfection, with little to no cellular debris within airways (Fig 3A, S1 and S3 Tables). The cellular infiltrate was largely composed of eosinophils and macrophages and fewer lymphocytes and plasma cells (Fig 3A inset) . Inflammation was not observed following infection with 10 3 TCID 50 of virus or in media-only controls (Fig 3B and 3C and S1 and S3 Tables) based on blind scoring and digital quantitative analysis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed virus antigen following infection with the higher (10 5 TCID 50 ) dose of virus (Fig 3D and inset, S1 and S2 Tables), but not the lower dose or media-only inoculum (Fig 3E and 3F and S1 and S2 Tables). In a separate experiment, rabbits were inoculated with 10 6.5 TCID 50 of EMC/2012 (Fig 2C  and 2D ). Viral RNA titers in the lung were sustained until day 5, then dropped to almost baseline levels by day 10, and were undetectable on day 28 post-infection. Serum was collected for detection of MERS-specific antibodies by both ELISA and microneutralization (MN) assays (Table 1) . Eight weeks after inoculation, serum antibodies against the S protein were detected by IgG ELISA in all of the rabbits inoculated with 10 5 TCID 50 [geometric mean titer (GMT) 1016], but not in the group inoculated with 10 3 TCID 50 . Antibodies against the nucleocapsid (N) protein were detected by IgG ELISA in two rabbits previously inoculated with 10 5 TCID 50 and one rabbit with 10 3 TCID 50 . However, neutralizing antibodies were not detected in rabbits inoculated with any dose (10 3 , 10 5 , or 10 6.5 ) of EMC/2012 (Table 1) . These data indicate that there is a dose-response in MERS-CoV infected rabbits measured by viral RNA and antibody titers. The peak in viral titers occurs at day 3 post-infection, with higher titers observed following infection with 10 5 or 10 6.5 TCID 50 of virus. Since the 10 5 and 10 6.5 TCID 50 doses gave similar results, the 10 5 TCID 50 dose was chosen for the remaining studies. Neither anti-S nor anti-N protein antibodies provide protection from reinfection Our findings in rabbits are reminiscent of a few reports of human cases of qRT-PCR confirmed infection with MERS-CoV that failed to elicit either a neutralizing antibody response, or any detectable antibody response against the virus [6, 8, 31] . In order to determine whether such patients would be susceptible to reinfection, we repeated the MERS-CoV infection in the previously infected rabbits. Eight weeks after primary infection, we challenged six rabbits that had previously received the high or low dose of MERS-CoV with 10 5 TCID 50 of EMC/2012 (Fig 1) . Additional na√Øve rabbits were inoculated for comparison. As in primary infection, clinical signs were not observed upon reinfection. Neither group of reinfected rabbits had viral RNA detected in the upper respiratory tract, although viral RNA was detected in the primary infection control group (S2 Fig) . However, all groups had evidence of pulmonary infection. The rabbits infected serially with 10 5 TCID 50 of EMC/2012 (10 5// 10 5 ) had lower viral RNA titers compared to both the 10 3// 10 5 TCID 50 and 10 5 TCID 50 primary infection groups, with mean titers of 10 2.9 , 10 3.7 , and 10 4 TCID 50 eq per gram of tissue respectively ( Fig 4A) . Inflammatory changes were more severe upon reinfection compared to primary infection, with the greatest inflammation observed in the animals previously infected with the low dose of virus (Fig 3A, 4B and 4C, and S1 and S3 Tables). These severely inflamed regions were characterized by an abundance of eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes and plasma cells which formed densely cellular collars of inflammatory cells around the affected perivascular and peribronchiolar regions. In addition, the cellular infiltrate expanded and obscured much of the adjacent alveolar interstitium. The alveolar interstitium also contained regions of proteinaceous fluid and diffuse type II pneumocyte hyperplasia (Fig 4B inset) . This inflammatory response was driven by reinfection, and was not residual inflammation from the primary infection. This was confirmed by including a group of previously infected rabbits that received diluent alone in the reinfection study ( Fig 4D, and S1 Table) . The rabbits in the 10 3// 10 5 TCID 50 group had antigen levels comparable to primary infection, while the 10 5// 10 5 TCID 50 group had lower levels of antigen by IHC (Fig 4E and 4F , S1 and S2 Tables). These data indicate that low titers of non-neutralizing antibodies do not protect rabbits from reinfection, and may instead result in enhanced inflammation. The S protein-specific IgG ELISA antibody titers were boosted following secondary infection and remained detectable for five weeks, with a GMT of 6451 for the 10 3// 10 5 TCID 50 group, and a GMT of 4064 for the 10 5// 10 5 TCID 50 group (Table 1) . N protein-specific antibodies were found in all rabbits in the 10 3// 10 5 TCID 50 group and one of the 10 5// 10 5 TCID 50 group. Secondary infections in both groups resulted in the production of neutralizing antibodies, although the titer in one rabbit in the 10 3// 10 5 TCID 50 group dropped below the detection limit by five weeks post-infection (Table 1 ). Overall the 10 3// 10 5 TCID 50 group had lower neutralizing titers than the 10 5// 10 5 TCID 50 group, with GMTs of 27 and 73 respectively.
