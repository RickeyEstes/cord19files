We present the estimation result of our model with autoregressive order one, three and four in Table 2 . Although inclusion of more autoregressive terms increases the R 2 , it also leads to less degrees-of-freedom in estimation. We set the maximum number of lags equal seven and select the model with three autoregressive terms based on the BIC. The last row of Table 2 reports the F-statistic and the result indicates the coefficients are jointly significant. Both the level effect and the daily change effect are found significant. The level effect is found to be negative, thereby indicating that a bear market increases incidences of stroke; the first order daily change effect is also negative, thereby implying that downward daily stock market movements also increase incidences of stroke; the second order daily change effect is found to be positive, thereby indicating that great daily index movements increase incidences of stroke in a quadratic way. The level effect is found to be highly significant (p < 0.001), with the estimate of À4.396. This suggests that a 1000 point reduction in the stock market index leads to a daily increase of approximately 4.396 hospitalizations for occurrences of stroke. We can also obtain the index elasticity of stroke from the estimates. A 1000 point change in the stock market is about a 17% change off the mean. A 4.396 incidence decrease in hospitalization is about a 1.9% decrease off the mean. Therefore, the index elasticity of stroke is around 0.1. Daily stock market movements are found to have a negative effect whilst the squared daily changes are found to have a positive effect on incidences of stroke. This implies that the relationship between daily market movement and incidence of stroke is not only linear. The greater daily movement, regardless upwards or downwards, also increase stroke incidence. It indicates that when the stock market index went down by 1 per cent within a single day, there was an increase of approximately 1.581 (¼1.002 þ 0.579) in the number of hospitalizations for occurrences of stroke on that day. Note that the daily change effect was asymmetric due to the second order effect. If the stock market index went up by 1 per cent within a single day, there was a decrease of approximately 0.423 (¼À1.002 þ 0.579) in the number of stroke hospitalizations on that day. Moreover, the daily effect increased in quadratic manner when market went down: when the stock market index went down by 2 per cent within a single day, there was an increase of approximately 4.32 (¼2.004 þ 2.316) in the number of hospitalizations due to stroke on that day. The effects of stock index do not seem great in magnitude despite they are highly statistically significant in some cases. It may result from the health measure used in the study. An alternative measure can the number of stroke outpatient utilization but the national-wide outpatient dataset is not available to us. According to Chiu and Lien (2003) , the number of stroke outpatient utilization is about 13 times of that of inpatient utilization based on the data of a medical center. Our analysis exhibits significant weekday variations in occurrences of stroke; indeed, we find a significant Monday effect, similar to the prior studies (Jakovljevic, 2004; Kelly-Hayes et al., 1995) . Using Monday as the reference day, we find that there were approximately 35.106 fewer hospitalizations for stroke on Tuesdays, 37.695 fewer on Wednesdays, 41.456 fewer on Thursdays, 37.122 fewer on Fridays, 74.977 fewer on Saturday, and 113.188 fewer on Sunday. A seasonal (month) effect on occurrences of stroke is also discernible, with the number of hospitalizations for stroke increasing significantly during cold months (NovembereApril); this is again consistent with the prior studies (Chen et al., 1995; Ricci et al., 1992; Sobel et al., 1987) . The month effect is found to be most pronounced in December, when there were 9.979 more daily hospitalizations for stroke than in January. Finally, the number of daily hospitalizations for stroke during the period of the SARS outbreak was reduced by an average of about 46.411. Overall, there is a clear and significant upward time trend, which suggests a general increase in the number of occurrences of stroke between 2001 and 2007. The results based upon the separation of the data by gender are presented in Table 3 , from which we can see that the level effect of the stock index is negative for both males and females, but that the daily change effects are significant only for males. A 1000 point fall in the stock index is found to have increased hospitalizations for stroke by 2.772 for men, and by 1.821 for women. A 1 per cent fall in TAIEX within a single day is associated with an increase of 1.302 in number of stroke hospitalizations. In contrast, neither daily change effects are found to be significant for women. The patterns of the day-of-the-week effect and the month effect are similar to those found in the estimation for the full population sample. A point worth noting, however, is that whilst the upward time trend is highly significant for males, it has no significance for females. These effects are further examined by different age groups in Table 4 , which reveals that all the level and daily change effects are found to be significant for the elderly group. A 1000 point reduction in the stock index is found to have increased hospitalizations for stroke by 3.588 amongst the elderly, whilst a 1 per cent fall in the stock index within a single day is found to have increased hospitalizations for stroke for the same group by 1.026. Amongst the 45e64 age group, we find significance only for the level effect, and not for the daily change effects. Neither the level effect nor the daily change effect is found to have significant impacts on occurrences of stroke for the 25e44 age The number in the parenthesis is the NeweyeWest Heteroskedasticity Autocorrelation Consistent (HAC) standard error. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. Note that the pooled sample is the sum of men and women, so the coefficient for the level effect of the pooled sample is close to the sum of the coefficients of both genders. i.e., À4.4 z (À2.77) þ (À1.82). The difference may partly result from different model specification e 3 lags in men's estimation and 4 lags in women's estimation. a We set the minimum number of lags equals 0 and the maximum number of lags equals 7. group. However, the day-of-the-week effect, month effect and SARS effect are all found to exist in each of the three age groups, with the month effect being found to be stronger for the elderly group. It is again readily noticeable that the time trend has significance for the elderly group, but not for the other age groups. Our result suggests that stock index has stronger effects on male and elder people and it urges us to investigate the effects based on the data divided by both gender and age. Table 5 shows that all three effects are significant only in the elderly male group. The level effect is significant in the elderly female group and in the mid-age male group. Comparing Table 3 and Table 5 , we find that the significant effects for male are mainly driven by the elder males. Moreover, we find that the significance of two daily effects of the elderly group (in Table 4 ) is mainly driven by the elder males (in Table 5 ) since both daily effects are insignificant for the elder females.
