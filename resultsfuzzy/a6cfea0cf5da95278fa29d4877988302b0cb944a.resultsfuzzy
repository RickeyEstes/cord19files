Extraction method-to-method reproducibility was assessed by determining, for each combination of extraction day and RVP lot (Day 1 × Lot 1, Day 1 × Lot 2, . . . , Day 3 × Lot 3; 9 combinations in total), the overall percentage of expected calls across all 19 samples extracted by 3 separate methods (easyMAG TM , miniMAG TM , QIAamp MinElute); see Table 3 . Extraction day-to-day reproducibility for each combination of extraction method and RVP lot (Method 1 × Lot 1, Method 1 × Lot 2, . . . , Method 3 × Lot 3; 9 combinations in total), the overall percentage of expected calls across all 19 samples extracted on 3 separate days; see Table 4 . RVP lot-to-lot reproducibility was assessed by determining, for each combination of extraction method and extraction day (Method 1 × Day 1, Method 1 × Day 2, . . . , Method 3 × Day 3; 9 combinations in total), the overall percentage of expected calls across all 19 samples assayed by 3 separate lots; see Table 5 . Overall reproducibility within an extraction method was assessed by determining, for each extraction method evaluated, the overall percentage of expected calls across all 19 samples extracted on 3 separate days and assayed by 3 different RVP lots (Table 6) . Overall reproducibility across extraction methods, days and RVP lots was assessed by determining the overall reproducibility when results from all 9 combinations of extraction day × RVP lot for all 3 extraction methods are considered together for all 19 samples tested (Table 6) .
