Anti-HCV, Antibody to hepatitis C virus. serological surveillance and routine cleaning and disinfection. Frequent serological testing for HBsAg detects patients recently infected with HBV so that isolation procedures can be implemented before cross-contamination can occur. Environmental control by routine cleaning and disinfection procedures reduces the opportunity for cross contamination, either directly from environmental surfaces or indirectly by hands of personnel. In past studies, independent risk factors among maintenance hemodialysis patients for acquiring HBV infection included the presence of â‰¥1 HBV-infected patient in the hemodialysis facility who was not isolated, as well as a vaccination rate <50% among patients. 89 However, transmission has been rarely reported in the United States in the past 20 years because of high rates of vaccination, screening, and isolation. The most recent documented transmission in a dialysis clinic in the United States was due to reactivation of hepatitis B infection that occurred in a patient with previous infection who became antigen positive as a result of immunosuppression. 271 The CDC has received anecdotal reports of atypical hepatitis B serological test results among dialysis patients that may represent reactivation of HBV infection or HBV mutant strains; however, no further cases of dialysis-related transmission have been identified. Other risk factors for acquiring HBV infection include injection drug use, sexual and household exposure to HBVinfected contacts, exposure to multiple sexual partners, male homosexual activity, and perinatal exposure. Dialysis patients should be educated about these and other risks and, for those patients with active HBV infection (HBsAg positive), informed that their sexual partners and household contacts should be vaccinated. [272] [273] [274] HBV-infected patients should be evaluated for HBV treatment.
