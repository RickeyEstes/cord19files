The HR C Tetramer We began by studying a 44 residue peptide (called C44) corresponding to the predicted HR C region of SARS-CoV S2 (Figure 1 ). On the basis of circular dichroism (CD) measurements at 50 mM peptide concentration in neutral phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), C44 is w75% helical at 4ºC and displays a cooperative thermal unfolding transition with a melting temperature (T m ) of 40ºC (Table 1 and Figures 2A and 2B) . Sedimentation equilibrium experiments indicate that C44 is a tetramer (Figure 2C) . The X-ray crystal structure of the C44 peptide at 1.70 Å resolution (Table 2 ) reveals a unique lefthanded superhelix consisting of four antiparallel a helices crossing at an angle of w18º ( Figure 3 ). These helices form a cylinder with an overall diameter of w25 Å and a length of w60 Å . An exact dyad is perpendicular to the superhelical axis. The distance between the axes of diagonally related helices (with the same relative orientation) is w13 Å , whereas that between the axes of adjacent antiparallel helices is w9 Å . Unexpectedly, only the Leu and Ile side chains at the d positions interact between parallel helices (on diagonal) and stagger axially to form the hydrophobic core of the tetramer. Each cross-sectional d layer contains either two Leu or two Ile residues, which alternate from one pair of parallel helices to the other. In nine of ten layers, the dihedral angles c 1 and c 2 of the Leu and Ile side chains are approximately 260º,180º, corresponding to the most abundant rotamers for these amino acids (Ponder and Richards, 1987) . Residues at positions a and g in the neighboring helices pack against the leucines and isoleucines at d positions to complete the hydrophobic core (see Figure 3D ). Compared to the side chains of isolated helices, residues at the a, d, and g positions of the tetramer are substantially buried (>88%), those at the c and e positions are partly buried (w28%), while the b and f positions remain completely exposed. Approximately 6,000 Å 2 of solvent-accessible surface area (44% of the total accessible surface area of the four helical monomers) is buried in the tetramer. The C44 tetramer interface shows nonclassical ''knobs-to-knobs'' packing of the Leu and Ile side chains at the d positions between parallel helices (Gottschalk, 2005; Lupas and Gruber, 2005) . By contrast, adjacent (B) Sequence alignment of the HR N (top) and HR C (bottom) regions derived from SARS-CoV S2 with the corresponding residues of S2 proteins from other coronavirus genera. The sequences of SARS-CoV (Urbani strain used in this study), HCoV-229E (human coronavirus, strain 229E), MHV (mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM), and IBV (avian infectious bronchitis virus, strain LX4) are shown. The locations of the two isolated HR domains (N34 and C44) and two HR N /HR C complexes (N37/C34 and N50/C36) from SARS-CoV S2 are indicated. Core residue positions (a, d, x, or y) for the N34, N37, N50, and C44 coiled coils are shown (see text and Figure 5 ). Residues of the C34 and C36 peptides in direct contact with their respective N37 and N50 coiled coils are indicated by asterisks. Chemically similar residues among coronaviruses are colored red. antiparallel helices exhibit a new type of ''knobs-intoholes'' interaction (Bryson et al., 1995; Crick, 1953; Harbury et al., 1993) , whereby each Leu or Ile knob at a d position packs into a hole formed by the a and g residues of the neighboring helix and by two d residues in adjacent layers along the superhelical axis. This geometry results in a similar placement of atoms around the side chains at positions a and g. Knobs formed by a residues of one helix fit into holes formed by the spaces between the d and e residues on the neighboring helix and by two a residues in adjacent layers along the superhelical axis. Similarly, knobs at g positions pack into holes formed by the c and d residues of the neighboring helix and by two g residues in adjacent layers. Thus, the a, d, and g residues of the HR in the C44 tetramer segregate into four geometrically distinct helix-helix interfaces. By contrast, we note that residues at the a, d, and e positions of the lac repressor HR region participate in interhelical hydrophobic interactions (Deng et al., 2006; Friedman et al., 1995; Lewis et al., 1996) . In summary, the conserved C-peptide region within the S2 ectodo-main folds into a labile yet well-ordered, antiparallel, four-stranded coiled coil with unusual structural features.
