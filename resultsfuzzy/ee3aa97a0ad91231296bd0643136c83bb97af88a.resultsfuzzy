We apply our model to study the spread of ongoing epidemic of 2019-nCov (COVID-19) in India using aviation and railway networks as substrates. In these networks a link represents a direct flight/train between the given nodes. The sizes of our aviation and train networks are 69 and 320 respectively. Given the time scale of epidemic, it is reasonable to assume that the transport from city i to j via air is instantaneous, making the delay δ ij = 0. However the same assumption cannot be made for train transport, and we make the corresponding delay δ ij proportional to the geographic distance between the stations by assuming the average speed to be 50 All rights reserved.

As mentioned above, the η's are determined only up to the scale D by Eq(2), and hence their converged values depend on the initial guess. We start by calculating η i 's with starting guess of η = 1 for all the nodes. In practice, D depends on the actual migration data and its accurate estimation is beyond the scope of this work. Instead, we vary D and examine the behaviour of the system. We investigate the infected population of all the cities in time for both the networks separately, by first infecting Delhi with x Delhi (0) = 0.0001φ Delhi as it is well connected internationally. Fig. 1 shows the time series of infected population of several cities for D = 0.01. We note several key features of these time series. First, as a result of our modification of the SIR model that allows us to handle heterogeneous population sizes, the values of the maxima are proportional to the populations of the corresponding cities. Second, because β and γ are same for all the cities, bigger cities take longer to achieve their maxima. Also, for both the networks, most of the maxima occur in close proximity with each other implying the necessity of the preparedness against simultaneous large-scale outbreaks. Since the train network includes delay, the maxima tend to occur much later relative to that of Delhi. Because the train transport is the dominant means of transport in India, this shift of the peaks is more relevant for the response against coronavirus. After this, We take a more realistic situation in which more than one city is initially infected. For this, we consider six different cities and corresponding initial infected fractions: Delhi (10 −4 ), Mumbai (10 −5 ), Chennai (10 −5 ), Kolkata (2 × 10 −5 ), Bengaluru (10 −5 ), and Kochi (10 −6 ) with D = 0.01. The results are shown in Fig. 2 for the train network. The cities which are initially infected tend to peak earlier hence the peaks are no longer as synchronous as before. Because the delay in the air network is zero, this loss of synchrony is not as prominent, and we show only the network snapshots in Fig. 3 . From the figure, we see that almost all the nodes become maximally infected after about 90 days. The accurate estimation of the parameter D which is related to the migration is unavailable. Thus, to check its effect on the epidemic, we vary it and observe the behaviour of the time t max at which the infection maximum occurs for each city. The results are shown in Fig 4 with initial infection only at Delhi. D = 0 corresponds to quarantining Delhi from the rest of the nodes, and hence only Delhi has finite t max while for others t max is undefined. For D > 0, infection spreads to other nodes, and understandably very small values of D result in very large values of t max . Upon increasing D, the value of t max decreases rapidly as more fraction of individuals migrate among the cities. Interestingly, for each node except the initially infected one, there exists a critical value of D at which this trend reverses and t max starts increasing again. We can understand this unexpected behaviour with the following argument. When D is very high, it is analogous to having all the population wellmixed. As a result, too many infected individuals migrate from node to node to infect any one node effectively. In other words, too few infected individuals remain in any given city compared to low D. As a result, even the initially infected node takes long time to get maximally infected, and peaks for all the cities appear simultaneously.
