Production and proteolytic susceptibility of DmCPD1Bs Initial heterologous recombinant overexpression trials of DmCPD1Bs in the methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, rendered sufficient protein for structural studies. However, although we assayed several purification strategies, the presence of several bands in SDS-PAGE could not be avoided. N-terminal sequencing of these bands revealed that they were cleavage products of the target protein occurring after Leu189 that co-purified with the intact enzyme. Subsequent assays with different broad-spectrum inhibitors against the major classes of endopeptidases revealed that addition of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) during protein expression significantly limited degradation, giving rise to mainly two major bands (Fig. 1c , left lane). In contrast, inhibitors of metallo-, cysteine, and aspartyl proteinases had no appreciable effect. As a control, intact protein obtained in the presence of PMSF and purified was assayed for susceptibility to proteolysis by commercial trypsin and subtilisin. These experiments revealed similar degradation patterns to those observed during production in the absence of PMSF. In the case of subtilisin, cleavage occurred after Leu189, and for trypsin, cleavage occurred after Arg190 (Fig. 1c , right lane). According to the provisional genome sequence â€¡ (see Ref. 28) , P. pastoris apparently encodes four soluble serine endopeptidases: a putative Kex2 subtilisin-like proprotein convertase, a sequence relative of the mammalian Omi/HtrA2 family of trypsin-like serine proteases, and two putative orthologs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae YscB alias cerevisin (UniProt P09232). The latter enzyme belongs to the subtilisin/kexin family of serine peptidases and preferentially cleaves after arginine, tyrosine, or leucine according to MEROPS data-base. 29 Therefore, either of the cerevisin orthologs in P. pastoris may be responsible for the cleavage after Leu189 observed during recombinant overexpression of DmCPD1Bs. The two variant bands obtained (Fig. 1c , left lane) corresponded to species of between 52 and 58 kDa and did thus not coincide with the theoretical molecular mass of the protein (47 kDa). Treatment with endoglycosidase F and N-terminal sequencing revealed that they were glycosylation variants of the intact target protein. There are two potential glycosylation sites in the enzyme at Asn133 and Asn269. We tried to reduce heterogeneity by constructing two mutants, N133Q and N269Q. However, the expression yield of both single mutants was dramatically lower than that of the wild type. In addition, both mutants still displayed heterogeneous glycosylation. The double mutant N133Q/N269Q could not be expressed. These results underpinned the relevance of sugars for this protein, in good agreement with the importance of protein glycosylation in the secretory pathway. 30
