Evaluation of GSBUP-DEA model. We evaluate the resource efficiency of HKHA in each year by applying the LP of GSBUP-DEA Model (8) . The efficiency scores for all the hospitals during 2000-2013 are listed in Table 7 . According to Definition 1, the efficient DMUs' d Ã Table 7 that there are only 55% hospitals have higher efficiency values than the average, 0.870, which reveals the fact that there exists unfair resource allocation, inefficient resource utilization and poor management in HKHA. For example, Pok Oi Hospital has relatively lower efficiency in the earlier years, because it had no ED service before 2010. Queen Mary Hospital is regarded as one of the best hospitals in HK, but it faces the over-investment problem which lowers the efficiency value. Returns to scale (RTS) is the variation or change in productivity which describes the outcome from a proportionate increase of all the inputs. In DEA, an increasing return to scale (IRS) occurs when the output increases by a larger proportion than the inputs. Conversely, a decreasing return to scale (DRS) occurs when the proportion of output is less than the desired increased input during the production process. In Table 7 , the last column displays the HA hospitals' RTS in 2013. It reveals that if HKHA policy makers can properly increase the input of medical resources for the inefficient hospitals with IRS (i.e., Tung Wah Eastern Hospital and Pok Oi Hospital), these hospitals will achieve a higher service level than they expected. Notably, if HKHA policy makers continue to increase the hospital scale for the inefficient hospitals with DRS (i.e., Queen Mary Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital), it will be an uneconomic production process and even introduces unnecessary fiscal burden to the government. We take the year 2013 as an example, Table 8 shows the specific input-output factors, efficiency values and RTS status of each cluster. We find that KWC receives the most patient attendances; while KEC receives the least ones. In practice, HKHA allocates the medical resources for each cluster based on the patient attendances. Thus, HKHA should allocate the most medical resources for KWC and the least medical resources for KEC. However, this kind of method ignores the effect of medical case complexity of the patients. In fact, it is more reasonable to consider allocating the resources based on the complexity of the medical cases than purely on the patients' amount. In addition, the last column of Table 8 declares that the RTS status of KWC is DRS, indicating that the HKHA should reduce its medical resource inputs. Table 9 displays the slacks of each cluster measured by GSBUP, which is able to further validate the idea mentioned above. It is observed that the s D− of HKEC and HKWC with IRS is almost equal to zero; while their s G+ are not null, which means that the inefficient clusters with IRS are mainly caused by the inefficient resource utilization. On the other hand, the inefficient hospitals with DRS are mainly caused by the unfair resource allocation. This phenomenon can guide the HKHA policy makers to better control healthcare costs and improve healthcare efficiency under the service quality requirements. Considering all the slacks, the updated clusters' efficiency scores based on GSBUP-LP model can be calculated, as shown in the last column of Table 9 . The efficiency values of the comparison are displayed in Fig 2. It is observed that all the clusters' efficiencies are improved significantly, which further demonstrates that it is necessary to change the ideas for the medical investment standard. Evaluation of malmquist productivity change index. Table 10 reports HKHA hospitals' productivity change during the period 2000-2013. We observe that from 2000 to 2013, all the productivities of hospitals have made significant improvement. There are two major reasons: (i) SARS outbreak and (ii) Health services fees' reformation. The first diagnosed patient with SARS was on 21 February 2003 and the disease had widely spread in HK within just two weeks. The peak of the epidemic started from 24 March 2003, and there was a rapid influx of infected residents in HA hospitals, particularly the United Christian Hospital which was soon overwhelmed. Therefore, its productivity improves by 17.87%, particularly, the TEC and FS improve by 4.77% and 13.76%, respectively (see Table 11 ). On 29 March 2003, the Government and HA decided to designate the Princess Margret Hospital, due to its specialty in treating infectious disease, to receive SARS patients after diverting all its existing patients to other hospitals. Thus, its FS only improves by 1.81%. However, since the government intensified a strong technical support to the Princess Margret Hospital for resisting SARS, its TEC improves by 9.87% during 2000-2003 (see Table 11 ). Besides, the speed of the patient flow increase was unexpected. The additional manpower from other hospitals was deployed to Princess Margret Hospital for help, which is to reduce the medical resources input equivalently for the other hospitals. With the contribution from other hospitals to share the workload, the designation of Princess Margret Hospital officially ended on 11 April 2003. Furthermore, with the assistance of the necessary operational and information technology systems, a revised public hospital fees structure was implemented at the beginning of 2003 together with an enhanced waiver mechanism to better provide the available public resources to those in need. Along with the soaring SARS attendances, there is improvement in TEC for almost all the hospitals. Not surprisingly, the HKHA hospital productivity regresses from 2003 to 2007, since SARS has been gradually defeated during this period, and the patient attendances decrease a lot. In the periods, 2007-2010 and 2010-2013, the HKHA average productivity has generally increased except St. John Hospital, Tung Wah Eastern Hospital and North District Hospital, which are not the core and mainstream hospitals in HK. In particular, the St. John Hospital provides health services for the citizens living on the Cheung Chau Island, which is a geographically isolated place. Tung Wah Eastern Hospital and North District Hospital were once voted as the one with the highest emergency surgery mortality rates, therefore, their average TEC declines by 1.84% and 1.34% during 2007-2013 (see Table 11 ). In addition to the observations stated above, it is indicated in Table 10 that the productivity and FS of Pok Oi Hospital improve a lot during 2007-2013, as it has provided ED services since 2010. The most widely used method to model the DEA scores against exogenous factors is Tobit regression, which is suitable when the dependent variables are either censored or corner solution outcomes [33, 42, 43] . It is validated in [43] that the Tobit regression model is powerful in representing the second stage in DEA models. The relationship between exogenous factors and cluster efficiencies can be described by the following model: where HACE it describes the ith cluster's efficiency in the tth year. The symbol denotes the corresponding exogenous factor's value in the ith cluster of tth year. (β 0 , β 1 , . . ., β 7 ) are the unknown coefficients, and it * N(0, σ) are the independent and identically normally distributed residuals of the observations. In this study, we use the maximum likelihood estimation toolbox in R [44] to obtain the Tobit regression results, as presented in Table 13 . Firstly, the poverty situation of persons with disabilities has a positive influence on HA hospital efficiency; while median monthly domestic household income and education level affect the environmental efficiency negatively. Since the median income of each cluster has almost no relationship with population density (i.e., correlation coefficient = 0.03), the empirical results reveal an interesting phenomenon: the public hospitals that serve in a richer district, has a relatively lower efficiency in HK, since people with higher degree of education and income prefer to accepting higher quality service from the private hospitals. Secondly, the proportion of population aged over 65 and HA hospital efficiency has a negative correlation, because the elderly are more likely to suffer from life-threatening diseases. Many elderly patients are physically too weak to see the doctors. Moreover, one out of three elderly HK residents lives under poverty or disabilities, so they are usually unable to take good care of themselves once in sick. In other words, the aged population might increase the complications and the mortality rate. Therefore, the aged population have a negative correlation with the HA hospital efficiency. Thirdly, the proportion of patients come from the other clusters takes a positive correlation with the efficiency. The HA hospitals in HK are divided into seven clusters according to their geographical locations so that the healthcare service is evenly distributed across HK. Although the patients are expected to receive the same level of medical care, wherever they abide in, the quality of medical care are various across different locations. Thus, some patients abiding in the relative poverty districts may try to receive the better treatments from the other districts' hospitals, such as Queen Mary Hospital, belonging to the HKWC. These types of patients will increase the workload of some hospitals, which is validated by the regression results. Finally, the land area has no significant influence on HA hospital efficiency while population density has a weak positive influence. For example, New Territories has the largest land area in HK, while its population density is the lowest. Kowloon has the highest population density, at the same time, most of the poor with disabilities abide in this cluster. In addition, the land area and population density of Hong Kong Island lie in the middle, but the citizens are relatively richer. In conclusion, the geography factor has no significant influence on HA hospital efficiency.
