To examine the model predictions, À1 PRF efficiency was monitored in vivo using a dual fluorescence reporter system. In addition, compositions of the frameshift protein products were analysed by mass spectrometry. Analysis of the frameshift products revealed that the ratio of FS z to FS m was $4:1 in MB2 cells (Figure 9 ), thus indicating that the vast majority of À1 PRF events naturally occur through Pathways II and/or III. The model predicts that a smaller k pt should cause higher FS% and a lower fraction of FS m (Figure 8) . A prior study using yeast demonstrated that inhibition of peptidyltransfer promoted increased rates of À1 PRF, but did not differentiate between FS m and FS z products (36) . The model predicts that addition of chloramphenicol, a potent peptidyltransferase inhibitor in bacteria (37), should promote increased FS%. Consistent with the model, a 2.1-fold increase in FS% exp was observed in the E. coli culture containing 0.75 mg/ml chloramphenicol compared to the culture without the drug. The fractions of FS m for the culture with and without chloramphenicol were 17.3 and 20.4%, respectively (Figure 9a) . Although a slight decrease in the fraction of FS m was observed in the presence of the drug, the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The frameshift sequence for HIV-1 is U AAU UUU UUA, where a space separates each zero frame codon and the P-site of the recoding site is underlined. The E-site tRNA GUU Asn may form one canonical base pairing with the À1 frame UAA. In the MB2UCC strain, the sequence was mutated to U CCU UUU UUA (mutations shown in bold) where the E-site tRNA GGG Pro can potentially form one G:U and two C:G interactions. In the MB2CCC strain, the sequence was mutated to C CCU UUU UUA (mutations shown in bold) where the E-site tRNA GGG Pro can form three canonical base pairings with the À1 frame CCC. Because Pathway I requires that the E-and P-site tRNAs interact with the À1 frame, UCC and CCC as the À1 frame E-site codons may enhance this reaction, i.e. these codons would promote an increase in r t . The model predicts that a larger r t should result in a higher FS% due to increased production of FS m . Consistently, 1.2-and 1.4-fold increase in FS% exp are observed for the MB2UCC and MB2CCC strains compared to the MB2 strain, respectively (Figure 9b ). In the MB2UCC strain, 76.4% of the frameshift products were FS m , and in the MB2CCC strain, 90.3% of the frameshift products were FS m . These results suggest that changing the sequence to favor incomplete translocation, i.e. to favor Pathway I, can dramatically alter the composition of the frameshift product. To further our understanding of two types of frameshift proteins, the HTLV-1 pro-pol frameshift sequence was cloned into the reporter system. The extended frameshift sequence for HTLV-1 pro-pol is C CCU UUA AAC (where spaces separate zero frame codons and the slippery sequence is underlined). Similar to MB2CCC, the E-site tRNA GGG Pro can potentially form three canonical base pairings with the À1 frame CCC, which may create a favorable condition for Pathway I. Consequently, a significant amount of FS m among total frameshift proteins can be produced. Consistent with the model, the frameshift efficiency for HTLV-1 was 4.81% and the fraction of FS m was 39.4%.
