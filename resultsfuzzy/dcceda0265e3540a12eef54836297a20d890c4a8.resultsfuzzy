Figure 2(a) shows an optical image of a pristine single-walled carbon nanotube FET (swCNT-FET), which was obtained using optical microscopy (Sunny, Korea). Source and drain (Au/Pd electrodes) and SiO 2 film functionalized with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) are clearly evident in the image. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to reveal the CNT structures in the channel region. Figure 2 (b) clearly shows CNTs, which form a 5-μ m-wide and 20-μ m-long channel aligned between the source and drain electrodes. Stability and uniformity tests of the swCNT-FET were carried out. For the stability test, the temporal variation of source-drain current in the swCNT-FET was measured for 15 minutes and found to be negligible ( Fig. 3 (a) ). For the uniformity test, seventy-six swCNT-FET samples were fabricated and the distribution in conductance was measured. Figure 3 (b) shows that the distribution followed a log-normal function, which is typical for percolating conductive networks 26, 27 , and that the conductance was between 5 × 10 −8 S and 1 × 10 −6 S for 88% of the samples. The particle size distribution was measured following aerosolization of a solution containing virus and antibody particles, and removal of moisture. Figure 4 shows three different size distributions obtained for solutions containing the MS2 bacteriophage virus, the antibodies for the MS2 bacteriophage, and mixture of both particles. The quantity of virus particles in the virus solution was controlled to be the same as that of the antibody particles in the antibody solution. The virus, antibody, and virus-antibody bound particles had modal diameters of 24 nm, 23 nm and 46 nm, respectively, and the total number concentrations were 6.7 × 10 5 #/cm 3 , 6.72 × 10 5 #/cm 3 , and 5.94 × 10 5 #/cm 3 . Note that the virus and antibody particles were similar in size, and thus similar in terms of the total number concentration. When the mixed solution was aerosolized, the particle size distribution shifted toward larger particles, as expected; however, the total number concentration decreased compared with that obtained using the virus solution or antibody solution. This may be due to the fact that polyclonal antibodies were used, and so it is possible that unbound virus and antibody particles were present in the mixed solution. After the particles were aerosolized, they were electrically charged using a corona charger. The charged particles entered the nozzle, and were accelerated at the exit with a velocity of 1.17 m/s, and impinged on the substrate. We have previously shown 24 that the deposition domain on the substrate is circular, and that the diameter (or width) of the deposition domain is given by: where W is the width of the nozzle width and E s is the electrostatic number; i.e., where e = 1.6 × 10 −19 C is the elementary charge, E is the electric field strength, μ is the viscosity of air, U is the air velocity at the nozzle, d is the particle diameter, and C C is the Cunningham slip correction factor; i.e. 25 , where λ is the mean free path of air molecules (66 nm). The average charge number of particles, n, was determined both theoretically and experimentally; details of this can be found in the 'Methods' section. The average charge numbers were calculated using Eq. (5) (see the 'Methods' section); these were 3.31 for the virus, 3.16 for the antibody and 6.63 for the virus-antibody bound particles. These numbers are in good agreement with those obtained experimentally using Eq. (4); i.e., 3.05, 2.97, and 6.79, respectively. Therefore, we found that the virus and antibody particles had a similar charge number in addition to their similar size. The deposition widths for the aerosolized particles were calculated using Eq. (1); we find W p = 14.1 mm for the virus, W p = 13.9 mm for the antibodies and W p = 17.4 mm for the virus-antibody bound particles. The deposition widths were measured using a digital camera (D80, Nikon, Japan). A black enclosure was installed near the deposition location to shield the region form external light. The measured deposition widths were 14.6 mm for the virus, 14.1 mm for the antibodies and 18 mm for the virus-antibody bound particles. Therefore, the measured data were in good agreement with the results of the calculations. Figure 5 also shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) images for four deposition spots. As shown in Fig. 5(a,b) , the virus and antibodies were deposited as single particles. Virus, antibodies and virus-antibody bound particles co-existed in Zone 1 (W p < 14.6 mm; see Additional experiments were carried out using antibodies specific for the H1N1 virus, and not for the target bacteriophage MS2 virus. Figure 6(a) shows the size distribution of the aerosolized antibodies for the H1N1 virus. The particles had a modal diameter of 11 nm and a total number concentration of 6.58 × 10 5 #/cm 3 . A solution containing the target bacteriophage MS2 virus and antibodies for the H1N1 virus was prepared and aerosolized, and the aerosolized particles were electro-aerodynamically deposited. The deposition width was 14.4 mm (Fig. 6(b) ), which is almost identical to that for the virus deposition shown in Fig. 5(a) . Figure 6 (c) shows an SEM image of deposition; single particles can be seen deposited on the substrate, and particle agglomeration was not observed. It follows that no change in the size of the particles due to binding between the target bacteriophage MS2 virus and the antibodies for H1N1 occurred. Figure 7 shows the source-drain current as a function of the gate voltage (i.e., I-V characteristics of the swCNT-FET) before and after the deposition of the virus-antibody bound particles. Figure 7 shows a dramatic decrease in the current following deposition of virus-antibody bound particles. When the number concentration ratio of virus to antibody was 1:0 or 0:1, the current did not change from that measured with no particle deposition (control value). However, when the ratios were 0.01:1, 0.05:1, and 0.1:1, the current decreased to 93%, 87%, and 46% of the control value, respectively, supporting that only virus-antibody bound particle can affect the current change. When the ratio further increased to 1:1 or 10:1, the current decreased to 30% of the control value on account of the higher number concentration of virus particles. Detection of H1N1 virus was carried out to check the universality of our proposed method. The H1N1 virus, antibody for H1N1, and virus-antibody bound particles had modal diameters of 21.5 nm, 11 nm, and 31 nm, respectively, and the total number concentrations were 6.81 × 10 5 #/cm 3 , 6.58 × 10 5 #/cm 3 , and 5.83 × 10 5 #/cm 3 . The charge numbers for H1N1 virus, antibody for H1N1, and virus-antibody bound particles were 2.85, 1.44, and 4.31, respectively. Since the calculated deposition widths were 13.3 mm, 10.7 mm and 15.7 mm, respectively, for H1N1 virus, antibody for H1N1 virus, and virus-antibody bound particles, the swCNT-FET channel was located in the domain between 10.7 mm and 15.7 mm. Then particle deposition experiments were carried out and the change in source-drain current was observed. Figure 8 shows 20% decrease in the current after the deposition of the virus-antibody bound particles. The reduced current in the swCNT-FET that was observed in the presence of virus-antibody bound particle was most likely due to donation of electrons from negatively charged virus-antibody bound particles (see Fig. S2 in "Supplementary information"). Because of the p-type characteristics of the swCNT,
