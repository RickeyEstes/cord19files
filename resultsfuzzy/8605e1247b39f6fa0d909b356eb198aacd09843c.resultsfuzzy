The present section explore the stability for the model (3) by considering first the disease free equilibrium and the basic reproduction number denoted by R 0 . The disease free equilibrium for the model (3) is, Computing the basic reproduction number for the given model (3), we follows the work in [18] , where the necessary computations of the matrices F and V are shown by The spectral radius c FV À1 À Á is the required basic reproduction number of the model (3), we is given by Further, we can write R 0 in the form The DFE E 0 of the system (3) is locally asymptotically stable if R 0 < 1. Proof. For the proof, we obtain at DFE E 0 , the Jacobian matrix below, In above Jacobian matrix, the two eigenvalues are negative, that is Àl p twice ð Þand the rest can obtained through the characteristics equation below: In above equation the term under braces are less than R 0 and the coefficient a 4 is positive when R 0 < 1, and thus all the coefficients are positive. Further, the criteria of Rough-Hurtwiz for the fourth order polynomial is a i > 0 for i ¼ 1; 2 . . . ; 4 and a 1 a 2 a 3 À a 2 1 a 4 À a 2 3 > 0 can be easily satisfied by using the above coefficients. So, the model (3) at the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if R 0 < 1. In the present section, we consider the model (13) and using the parameters values shown in Table 1 to obtain the graphical results. The time unit is taken in days. Fig. 6 describes the individuals behavior for different values of the fractional order q. Fig. 7 is obtained by varying the initial values, which shows the asymptotical stability of the endemic equilibrium.
