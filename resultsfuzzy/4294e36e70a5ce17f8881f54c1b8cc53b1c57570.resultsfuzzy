3.1. Identification of novel arterivirus-like sequences in SI and archival possum tissues A consensus contig approximately 4.8 kb in size that returned significant TBLASTX hits to known arteriviruses was identified from the initial NGS data (Fig. 1) . The viral sequence was detected in archival samples from 14/15 WPD-affected possums and from 4/20 clinically healthy possums. As such, the proportion of possums positive for the novel virus was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) among animals with WPD than among clinically healthy possums, strongly suggesting an aetiological involvement of the virus in WPD. However, the satisfaction of more stringent criteria for establishing disease causation, including fulfilment of the original or modified Koch's postulates, is required to further support our initial findings (Williams, 2010) .
