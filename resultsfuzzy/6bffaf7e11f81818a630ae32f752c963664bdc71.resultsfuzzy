Interferon inducible and dsRNA activated 2-5 OAS is a critical component in the enzymatic reaction to form 2-5A polymer which is an activator of RNaseL. Together, the 2-5A/RNaseL system forms a vital part of innate immune system [4, 10, 11] . The activated RNaseL degrades the viral RNA and provides defense against infected viruses [14] . The variation in enzyme activity is attributed to non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism at the splice acceptor site in the last exon for at least OAS1. This variant of OAS1 enzyme is associated with increased viral infection due to lack of OAS enzyme function [25] . Here, we developed a simple method of detecting OAS by coupling pyrophosphates generated during the polymerization of ATP to form 2-5A in presence of the enzyme OAS to the conversion of MESG substrate to purine based product with absorbance peak at 360 nm by using a commercially available kit. The enzyme in the cell lysates was activated and purified using NaIO4 activated and poly I:C conjugated sepharose beads (Fig. 1) . The purified enzyme polymerizes ATP and releases pyrophosphates. Further, pyrophosphates are converted to phosphate in the presence of inorganic phosphatase to the reaction. In the presence of ribonucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), phosphates react with substrate MESG and converts it to 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine and ribose 1-phosphate (Fig. 1) . Earlier, this method has been utilized to measure phosphates released by enzymes like actin activated myosin ATPase [31] and phosphorylase kinase [35] and AcsD, an acyladenylate-forming enzyme from Pectobacterium chrysanthemi [36] . This method has advantage over several earlier less sensitive assay involving multistep reactions [37] .
