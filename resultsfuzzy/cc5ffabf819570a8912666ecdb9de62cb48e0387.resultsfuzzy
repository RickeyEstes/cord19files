When comparing the staff-and self-swabs collected on day 1, bactin DNA concentration was higher in the self-collected swabs (p = 0.008) (Fig. 2A) . The b-actin DNA concentration was higher in the self-swabs collected on or after day 2 than in the self-swabs from day 1 (p,0.0001). Interquartile distance was smallest in the staff-collected swabs and greatest in the swabs that were selfcollected at home, indicating lower variability in the staff-collected than in the self-collected swabs. b-actin DNA levels did not correlate with the duration of symptoms preceding the day of swab collection (Fig. 2B) . A respiratory viral pathogen was detected in 31% (23/75) of staff-and in 35% (26/75) of self-collected swabs collected on day 1 (p = 0.36, McNemar test). In both, the most frequently identified pathogens were human rhinoviruses A, B or C (12/27 positive swabs, 44%), human coronavirus OC43 (4/27 swabs, 15%) and parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3 or 4 (4/27, 15%). Table 2 contains the complete list of detected pathogens, expressed as percentages of all 75 swab pairs collected on day 1 in which a pathogen was detected in at least one of the two swabs. There was nearly perfect agreement between the staff-and self-swabs collected on day 1 in terms of pathogen detection (percent agreement = 93%, k = 0.85, Fig. 3 ). The overall sensitivity of self-collected swabs to detect a respiratory pathogen was 96%, compared to the staff-collected swabs (Table 3 ). This very good agreement between the staff-and self-collected swabs from day 1 is also evident in the flow diagram shown in Fig. 3 . Analyzing the results obtained with the self-swabs from day 2 or later, a viral pathogen was detected in 39% (26/67) of the swab pairs when the results of both nostrils were combined. When the swabs from each side were considered separately, a pathogen was detected in 31% (21/67) of the self-collected swab from the right and in 37% (25/67) of swabs from the left nostril. However, this apparent difference was not significant (p = 0.22, McNemar test). Comparing viral detection of these self-swabs with that of the staffcollected swabs from day 1 revealed substantial agreement Table 3 . Sensitivity and specificity of self-collected swabs, obtained in the study center, to detect viral respiratory pathogens (compared to staff-collected swabs)*. (percent agreement = 85%, k = 0.67). The detection of a viral pathogen was independent of the amount of b-actin DNA in both staff-and self-swabs collected on day 1 (Fig. 4) . Likewise, there was no association between viral positivity status and b-actin DNA levels across all samples (p for trend = 0.943).
