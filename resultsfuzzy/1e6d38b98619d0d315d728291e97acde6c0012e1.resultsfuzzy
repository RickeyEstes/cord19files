Estimates of resource gaps, and thus also avoidable mortalities, were very sensitive to the severity of the modeled pandemic scenario in relation to transmissibility and proportion of cases requiring hospitalization ( Figure S4) . A sensitivity analysis showed that under more severe (yet still plausible) pandemic scenarios, even Taiwan could experience substantial deaths due to shortages of hospital resources ( Figure S4A and S4C) . Furthermore, as the severity of the scenario increased, so too did the proportion of avoidable deaths that were attributable to gaps in hospital bed capacity (shown for Cambodia in Figure S4B and S4D) . It is important to note, however, that for the ranges of values explored for the basic reproduction number and the proportion of cases that become severely ill, consistent patterns were observed when comparing relative magnitudes of avoidable mortality rates across countries (and also across provinces within countries).
