COVID-19 related searches in Taiwan remained low in period of the first case was detected on December 12 th , 2019 (CNN, 2020) and continuously increased with the announcements of Taiwan' first imported case on January 21 st , 2020 (Taiwan CDC, 2020) . The same trend as occurred in worldwide and China (Strzelecki, 2020) . However, COVID-19 related searches in Taiwan continued to extend and reached its peak on January 30 th , 2020 as local cases were reported and the declaration of WHO for PHEIC was issued globally. It took two weeks for COVID-19 related searches to reach its peak and continuously declined afterward since the massive availability of information provided in online news reporting, video/radio news reporting, and health expert reporting (Keller et al., 2009) in the first week of February 2020, which was identified as peak of outbreak in observation period. In addition, face masks related searches in Mandarin also increased as raised of COVID-19 related searches. Public restlessness seems to drive immense purchases of face masks that lead to face masks shortage in Taiwan that forced Taiwan government to loosen restrictions on surgical mask imports (Tzu-yu and Yi-ching, 2020). And due to massive panic buying of masks, Taiwan government has announced in February 3rd that face masks will be distributed through National Health Insurance (NHI) contracted pharmacies and drugstores started from February 6 th 2020. This policy might also correspond with declined of masks-related searches after D point (Taiwan CDC, 2020) Otherwise, searches for handwashing related information were relatively stable in 20 points and quickly increased in the fourth week of January 2020. These searches were gradually increased as declining of COVID-19 and face masks related searches. This condition indicated that people were still gathering information about necessary handwashing practices for personal hygiene and protection while lacking face masks. According to Fig.1 , the dynamics of GT data in Taiwan were related with the vulnerability due to the confirmation of local COVID-19 and public restlessness given the announcement of international warning from the WHO. Therefore, GT data could be used to frame the proper timing for risk communications to the public. Additionally, Fig.2 showed huge numbers of COVID-19 searches in six J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cities including Taipei (100 points), New Taipei (73 points), Taoyuan (85 points), Taichung (80 points), Tainan (82 points), and Kaohsiung (87 points)."coronavirus 中文"was the term with the highest Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. This keyword represented a strong tendency of Taiwanese people to search for information in Mandarin language for disease and symptom-related information. Accordingly, GT data could also depict the information needed by users based on keyword utilization. In lag period, high to moderate correlations between Google RSV and COVID-19 cases were found in Taipei (lag-3), New Taipei (lag-2), Taoyuan (lag-2), and Tainan (lag-1). This finding reflected the increased of googling activities in one until three days before the increased of COVID-19 cases. While in Taichung and Kaohsiung, information searches increased in same day as increased of cases. Moreover, a distinct phenomenon found in New Taipei which indicated the increased of Google searches still found in two days after increased of COVID-19 cases. These findings indicated that GT can be used as a tool to monitor public restlessness toward COVID-19 epidemic infection in Taiwan at a range of 1 to 3 days before the increased of confirmed cases. In addition, the Taiwan Providing proper information during the outbreak through risk communication is urgently needed. Appropriate risk communication could help prevent infodemics (World Health Organization, 2020b) or an excessive amount of information circulating in affected populations which might induce public restlessness or panic. In response to the ongoing outbreak, our results demonstrated that GT could potentially define the proper timing and location for risk communication.
