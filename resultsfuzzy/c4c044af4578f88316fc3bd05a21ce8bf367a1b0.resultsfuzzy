After correction of shift of retention time, the TIC profiles of the fresh medical materials used for analysis were clearly shown in Fig. 2 . The number of the samples was 34, totally. They were collected from the four main areas in China to plant Houttuynia cordata Thunb, namely, Fujian (including Jiangxi), Yunan, Hunan and Sichuan provinces with a little difference of conditions for storage and transportation. In this work, the numbers of samples from the four areas were 8, 15, 3 and 8. The conventional chromatographic fingerprints technique for quality control attempted to establish a common state standard of the products obtained from different manufacturers. It can uniquely represent the medicine and differentiate from others. Then, the common pattern of good quality can be differentiated from the fakes of medicinal material. But this will be unavoidable to lose most useful information of two-way GC-MS data because of the deduction of data dimension. From the TIC profiles, it is easy to see there is significant qualitative and quantitative difference among most chemical components in these samples, as shown in Fig. 2 . The similarities among the original profiles and their mean profiles are only from 0.1922 to 0.5198. Most of them are less than 0.40. Therefore, the common features (patterns) of components in these samples are very difficult to be found out for quality control. In practice, the evaluation of sameness and difference of components in the same medicine only with different origins are not so easy. Additionally, data processing of these samples, such as correction of retention time shifts, challenges the conventional chemometric methods. Then, it is even difficult to get the relationships of presence and absence of target components among these samples unless to obtain all the components information using the existing chemometric methods. For succinct description purpose, only mean of the total mass spectral profiling (after normalization operation) acquired at the four different areas is shown in Fig. 3 . Obviously, the four mass spectral profiling is very similar to each other. The similarity of the 34 mass spectral profiling with their mean mass spectral profiling is between 0.8151 and 0.9909. The five minimum similarities also attain to 0.8151, 0.8692, 0.8735, 0.8809 and 0.8828, respectively. Most other similarities are more than 0.9500. So, the common information of mass spectral profiling among different samples, namely, the common features of medicinal materials of Houttuynia cordata Thunb, can be extracted out using mass spectral profiling. Furthermore, the special interested m/z points at mass spectral profiling are very useful to get the chromatographic profiles of components in mixture samples. Such information is very important for quality control of HMs. One can define the intensities of the interested m/z points, or the MC (s) at different m/z points, if necessary. Also, these extracted m/z points and chromatographic profiles are crucial in the study of metabonomics, such as the discovery of biomarkers or biomarker patterns on disease diagnosis. The main advantage of the strategy of mass spectral profiling for quality control of HMs is the effective employment of spectral information of all the components in GC-MS data, including the major and minor ones. It considers the important volatile components in Houttuynia cordata Thunb, such as terpenes and the ramification, and aliphatic compounds as a whole. With the help of the additional information of conventional chromatographic fingerprint, mass spectral profiling will assist one to get the comprehensive and integrated information of components in complex GC-MS data for experimental and industrial applications. In this section, the finished injection products collected from four factories were studied in detail. Their average TIC profiles were shown in Fig. 4 . The total number of samples was 82, which is largely more than the number of the medicinal materials analyzed in the above section. It is really a timeconsuming and challengeable task if only the conventional methods are used for alignment of shift of retention times, and then, other treatments. These samples were respectively collected from Zhengqing, Yaan, Lingrui and Ange corporations for HMs production. The front two factories locate in South China using fresh medicinal materials, and the latter two in North China using dried ones. The main task for quality control of such products is how to find the sameness and difference with discrimination analysis techniques, as well as the special interested components. Whether the dried medicinal materials can be used in production is a vexed question in China. In this work, the new technique may do a favor on solution of such problem. The numbers of samples for analysis of the above four factories were respectively, 13, 18, 45 and 6. The four average chromatograms shown in Fig. 4 are mean profiles of the samples extracted from the same manufacturers. From this figure, the main qualitative information of the components between retention time 16 and 21 min is very similar among them. But the difference in some other retention time regions can be found, especially to the third one (manufacturer C). The similarities of the 82 TIC profiles with their mean profiles are from 0.5826 to 0.9377. Most of them are from 0.7 to 0.9. In Fig. 5 , the clustering results of all the 82 mixture samples using the chromatographic profiles and PCA are shown with the first two principal components, titled PC1 and PC2, respectively. It is apparent to see the discrimination results are not very satisfactory for quality control of the products from the four factories. First, the samples from Nos. 1 to 13 of manufacture A are very dispersed and cannot differentiate from B (from Nos. 14 to 31) and C (from Nos. 32 to 76) very well. The samples of manufacturer D (from Nos. 77 to 82) are nearly mixed together with the samples of manufacturer C. Clustering of the twelfth sample of manufacturers A is false, in fact. The main sameness and difference of the sam- ples produced by fresh and dried medicinal materials cannot be clearly distinguished in the projection loadings plot. Then, the discrimination results are unacceptable used for quality control. On the other hand, the mean of total mass spectral profiling of the four different factories after normalization is shown in Fig. 6 . Obviously, the main feature of these spectra at different m/z points of mass spectral profiling is very similar to each other. As described above, the chromatographic profiles of the pure and/or mixed components at the m/z points can be further extracted and studied in detail. For example, if one is interested in the m/z point 207 at mass spectral profiling of the second manufacturer B, chromatographic profile of the component at this m/z point can be easily extracted from the original GC-MS data for validation. Then, the efficacies of the products from different factories can be possibly elucidated with mass spectral profiling. The similarities of the 82 mass spectral profiling with their mean profiling are between 0.8854 and 0.9937. Most of them are more than 0.9500. Obviously, the relative intensities of spectra at m/z points 58 and 71 in the manufacturers A and B using fresh medicinal materials are significantly larger than them with dried ones. The main reason is the degradation of some volatile components in the processes of drying, storage and production. The similarities between the samples of manufacturers A and B, C and D are respectively from 0.9113 to 0.9981, and from 0.9231 to 0.9990. Most of them attain to 0.9900. Compared with the similarities obtained from chromatographic fingerprints, mass spectral profilings of the products acquired at the same kinds of medicinal materials (fresh or dried) are more similar than the different kind. After deduction of the mean of mass spectral profiling (see Eq. (3)), the results of all the 82 samples with PCA analysis are shown in Fig. 7 : Here, denotations x, mean(x) and x new , respectively mean the original mass spectral profiling x, mean of x and the new vector after the operation. It is very clear to see that the samples collected from the four different manufacturers can be discriminated with very good performance. The four discrimination regions A1 and A2, B1 and B2 in the figure can be used to divide the samples from different factories into four parts very well. Furthermore, the samples manufactured by fresh (in A1 and A2) and dried medicinal materials (in B1 and B2) also clearly distributed in two different sides. Therefore, mass spectral profiling with the same medicinal materials has more common features. It is crucial for the quality control of HMs. On the other hand, the chromatographic profiles of components at the interested m/z points of mass spectral profiling can be used for further extraction of buried information in GC-MS data. In Fig. 8 , eight chromatographic profiles with different complexities at m/z points of mass spectral profiling are shown. The possible pure profiles with only one component are plotted in the first three profiles. At the same time, the molecular structures and pure spectra of the three components A, B and C are shown. The three components are very important bioactive constituents of Houttuynia cordata Thunb. With the help of mass spectral profiling, the qualitative and quantitative information of these components can be obtained at the target m/z points. So, the three compounds are very important for evaluation and improvement of the efficacy of Houttuynia cordata Thunb. Of course, some conventional methods such as EFA [19, 20] , HELP [21] [22] [23] , and FSMWEFA [43] , etc. can be further used for purity test of these components, if necessary. Other six mixed chromatographic profiles with two, three, four and more compsitions are shown from the forth to ninth profiles. It can be found that all the above three components A, B and C are included in the sixth and ninth chromatographic profiles. Therefore, the m/z points with contribution to these profiles are very helpful to provide possible efficacy information of Houttuynia cordata Thunb. All the nine chromatographic profiles in Fig. 8 are obtained from different m/z points. Most of them have more than two target m/z points. Of course, the sum of chromatographic profiles of different m/z points can be used for evaluation when the number of m/z points is more than one to a certain profile. These m/z points of mass spectral profiling are very important ref- erence indices to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative information or the variation rules of the active constituents. In general, it is not difficult to find out the interested m/z points at different mass spectral profiling for information extraction of one or more target components in HMs or metabolites in metabonomics. The m/z points with common contributions of different components are very rich in mass spectral profiling. In Fig. 9 , eight chromatographic profiles with two groups (one from Nos. 1 to 4 and another from Nos. 5 to 8) were extracted from m/z points 58 and 71 of the four manufacturers, respectively. It seems that the relative intensities of manufacturers A and B (with fresh herbs) at the two m/z points are significantly larger than the relative intensities in manufacturers C and D (with dried herbs) in Fig. 6 . Then, the chromatographic profiles at these m/z points can be extracted for further study. The relative quantitative information of components a1 and a2 in manufacturers C and D are smaller than the same components a3 and a4 in A and B (at m/z point of 58). The similar results of components b1, b2, b3 and b4 can also be obtained at m/z point 71 to show the quantitative variation rules of these components among different samples. It can be found that the qualitative and quantitative information of components in mass spectral profiling and their m/z points is very rich for the analysis of complex mixture samples. Such information is also useful to elucidate the mechanism of difference of active ingredients among different but related samples like HM products of different manufacturers. Mass spectral profiling of GC-MS is a powerful tool to further understand the integrated structures of contaminated mass spectral data and their corresponding chromatographic profiles of chemical components. It can be an effective strategy in the study of HMs, as well as metabonomics and system biology.
