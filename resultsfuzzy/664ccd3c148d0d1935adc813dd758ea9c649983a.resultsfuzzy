Nucleotide content Nucleotide content of SARS-CoV isolates favors T and A nucleotides. The corresponding percentages of letters in non-UTR regions of all the 96 isolates were found to be as follows: T (30.7940%), A (28.4246%), G (20.8121%), C (19.9535%), N (G, A, T, C; 0.0143%), R (Pur; 0.0005%), K (G or T; 0.0001%), M (A or C; 0.0002%), S (G or C; 0.0001%), W (A or T; 0.0002%), and Y (Pyr; 0.0004%). The overall ratio of (A,T)/(G,C) in the dataset was almost 3:2 (1.45). The ratio of Pur vs. Pyr nucleotides was almost 1 (0.97). The distribution of nucleotides (nt) over sequences of length 250 nt is given in Figure S1 (Supporting Online Material). It exhibits three peak-regions of T nucleotide in the second quarter of the genome (ORF 1a), and rather stable behavior in the third quarter of the genome (ORF 1b), as also observed by Pyrc et al (32) for a group of coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, and HCoV-OC43). Deviation of percentage of nucleotides over 250-nt blocks from the corresponding percentage in the whole dataset is given in Figure S2 . Except for 3' UTR where T nucleotide is underrepresented with even about -13%, the highest excess from the average is about +10% in four peaks, which is exhibited again by T nucleotide, three of them being between positions 7,000 and 11,000 (ORF 1a), complementary with the nucleotide A represented with -10%, and the fourth one in the S protein. Otherwise the nucleotides' offset oscillates rather regularly between -5% and +5% from the average.
