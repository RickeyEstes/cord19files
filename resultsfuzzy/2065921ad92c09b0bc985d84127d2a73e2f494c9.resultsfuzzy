3.3.1. DV flow rate effect Table 1 summarizes the effect of the DV flow rate on different parameters. As the DV flow rate increases, the stratification and critical heights are shifted upward resulting in an increase in Zones I and II heights and a decrease in Zone III height. It is clear that the increment of the DV supply rate strengthened the occupants' thermal plume and the upward velocity in Zone I. This velocity decreases from a maximum value at the floor level to zero at the stratification height due to air entrainment by the convective rising plumes. The vertical air motion by buoyancy effects leads to temperature stratification within the space resulting in a temperature increase from the floor to the ceiling levels (see Table 1 ). As DV flow rate increases, room air temperature gradient decreases. IPE was studied for different DV supply flow rates (50, 75, 100 L/ s) for a cough velocity of 22 m/s, 1 mm particles in diameter, and 1 m separating distance between occupants. Fig. 6a illustrates the effect of the DV supply flow rate on the variation with time of the normalized concentration at the breathing level of the exposed person. Logarithmic scale was used for the figure's axis for clarity of illustration. Three stages can be defined with respect to time for the different DV supply flow rates (Fig 6) . The first stage is dominated by the propagation and decay of the exhaled jet (Fig. 6a) and is very fast lasting for few seconds (Table 2a ). In the second stage, particles are redistributed by the ventilation system for several minutes. A final stage is the removal stage by deposition and upward transport by the DV system and has the largest period (Fig. 6a) . The observation of different exposure stages is in agreement with the findings of Xiaoping et al. [8] . Table 2a summarizes the periods of the three stages for each DV flow rate. The period of these three stages varied with the DV flow rate. The larger the flow rate is, the lower are the durations of the three stages ( Fig. 6a and Table 2a) . Furthermore, the effect of the DV flow rate on the duration of a stage is highest for the third stage and lowest for the first stage (Table 2a) . For the different flow rates, a concentration peak (penetration peak) is observed during the first stage due to the jet propagation. The higher the DV flow rate is, the lower is the penetration peak because a larger number of particles is convected upward by the DV system (Fig. 6a) . This observation is in agreement with the findings of Licina et al. [16] . A second inhaled concentration peak (redistribution peak) at DV supply flow rate below 75 L/s appears during the second stage since the stratification height is close to the breathing level which results in accumulating particles in the breathing zone (Fig. 6a) . As the DV flow rate increases from 50 to 75 L/s, the second peak is reduced and completely disappears for a flow rate of 100 L/s while the influence of the DV flow rate is less significant on the first peak which is dominated by the horizontal propagation of the exhaled jet (Fig. 6a) . The penetration peak (first stage peak) is two to three orders of magnitude larger than the redistribution peak (second stage peak). However, the duration of the first stage is much smaller than the second stage (Table 2a) . Fig. 6b represents the effect of the DV supply flow rate on the variation with time of the infection index. The rate of increase of the infection index is relatively high during the first stage and is reduced progressively with time to reach nearly zero at the end of the third stage. The profiles of variation with time of the normalized concentration and infection index are consistent with the work of Xiaoping et al. [8] . Within the set of studied conditions, the higher the DV flow rate is, the lower is the rate of increase of the infection index during the different stages. The inhaled dose during each stage for the different flow rates was calculated and results were summarized in Table 2b . For the different flow rates, the first stage represented the highest inhaled dose. As the DV flow rate increases, the infection index is reduced for the three stages but the rate of reduction is highest for stage 3 and lowest for stage 1 due to the decay of the exhalation jet with time (Table 2b) . Therefore, stage 1 presents the highest probability of cross-contamination between occupants. For a DV flow rate of 50 L/s, stages 2 and 3 represented a significant percentage of the total exposure. The DV system with a flow rate of 100 L/s reduced significantly the inhaled dose during stages 2 and 3 decreasing the total inhaled dose by 83% compared to a flow rate of 50 L/s. The DV flow rate of 100 L/s was adopted for the rest of the study.
