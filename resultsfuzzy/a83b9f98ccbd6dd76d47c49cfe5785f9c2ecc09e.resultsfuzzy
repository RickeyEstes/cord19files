The rainfall time series of the five states and the weekly reported LF cases of the whole of Nigeria are shown in Figure 1 (a)-(b). We observe that the major LF epidemics usually occur in Nigeria between November and May of the following year. The cumulative lagged effects can be observed by matching the peak timing of the rainfall and epidemic curves. In Figure  1 (c), we shift the rainfall time series of the five states by +6.5 months to match the trends of the national LF epidemic curve in Nigeria. To further test the credibility of this match, we use a simple statistical regression model of "case ~ α exp(β * rainfall) + θ", where α, β and θ are free parameters to be estimated, to check the outcome of the least-square fit. In Figure 1 (d)-(e), we find that the fit has a p-value less than 0.0001, which indicates a significant (statistical) association between the LF cases and shifted rainfall curve. We fit four different growth models to the LF confirmed cases and estimate the modelaverage reproduction number (R) after model selection. We show the growth model fitting results in Figure 3 and the model estimation and selection results in Table 1 . The models fit the epidemic data well, and most of them have AICs lower than the baseline AR(2) model. Most of the regions exhibit an epidemic turning point (τ) ranging from epidemiological week (EW) 4 to 10 in each year. Out of four outbreaks in the states of Bauchi and Plateau, there are three estimated τs after EW 10 ( Table 1) , and this state also has the largest number of LF cases in the outbreaks of both 2017-18 (41.9% of all cases) and 2018-19 (36.0% of all cases). Hypothesized spatial heterogeneity in the R is tested by Cochran's Q test. The testing results for the Rs in the five states are significant (i.e., p-value < 0.05) for both the 2017-18 and 2018-19 LF epidemics. Thus, we report the existence of spatial heterogeneity in LF epidemics in Nigeria. We choose to use the average reproduction number (R) rather than the instantaneous reproduction number, commonly denoted by R t [22, 23] , as the measurement of the LASV transmissibility. The R t is a series of time-dependent reproduction numbers, namely, timedependent effective reproduction numbers, which can be estimated by a renewable equation [20, 22, 23, 33, 34] . The factors that affect the changing dynamics of R t, include (i) the depletion of the susceptible population [28], (ii) the change (usually it is the improvement) in the unmeasurable disease control efforts (e.g., contract tracing) and local awareness of the outbreak [29], and (iii) the natural features of the pathogen (e.g., its original infectivity and other interepidemic factors) [28, 29, 31]. The estimated R in this work is a point estimate to summarize LASV transmissibility over a whole epidemic. Hence, the temporal changes of the susceptible population in (i), above, and local disease awareness and control related to (ii) do not affect R. With respect to point (iii) and other heterogeneities of outbreaks in different . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

These dummy variables serve as random effects to offset regional heterogeneities in LF epidemics. Therefore, we can then quantify a consistent effect (the β in Eqn (3)) of the lagged rainfall on the LASV R estimate. The association between local rainfall and LASV transmissibility (R) are modeled and quantified by the LRER model. In Figure 4 , we find a positive relation between rainfall and R. The estimated change rate in R for a one unit (mm) increase in rainfall is summarized with different cumulative lag terms (the t in Eqn (3)).  p-value: 0.044) with a regression R-squared of 0.36. We report the most significant (i.e., with the lowest p-value) regression estimates that appear with a cumulative lag of 7 months. The habitats of the LASV reservoir, i.e., rodents, include irrigated and flooded agricultural lands that are commonly found in and around African villages [6] . The range of lag from 4-9 months has previously been explained by the time interval between the peak of the rainfall and the rodent population [7] . The association between rodent population dynamics and rainfall levels has been demonstrated in a number of previous studies [6-10]. This relation could also be verified by examining the rodent population data in the Nigerian regions included in this work. The present finding of the impact of lagged rainfall on LF outbreaks suggests that knowledge of such weather-driven epidemics could be gained by referring to past rainfall levels. For instance, if a relatively high amount of rainfall occurs, local measures, such as rodent population control, could be effective to reduce the LF risk. The findings in this work are of public health interest and are helpful for policy-makers trying to achieve LF prevention and control. On the one hand, our findings suggest the existence of an association between rainfall and LASV transmissibility, which could be affected by the population dynamics of rodents [13] . On the other hand, the positive relation between rainfall and R indicates that rainfall, particularly in states with a high LF risk, can be used as a warning signal for LF epidemics. The modeling framework in this study can be easily extended to other infectious diseases. Table 1 . The summary table of the model estimations. Population numbers are summarized in units of one million. The "improvement" is the goodness-of-fit estimate, i.e., the partial Rsquared, from the baseline AR(2) model. The "weight" is the AIC-weight of the selected model, which is used for calculating the model-averaged estimates. The "NA" means a summary term that is not applicable to a certain model. The notation "-" means that the model cannot achieve a converging fitting outcome. The model-averaged estimates in each region are highlighted in gray.
