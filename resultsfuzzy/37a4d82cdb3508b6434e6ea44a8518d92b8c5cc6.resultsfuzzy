aerogel had the SiO 2 structure whose OAH characteristic absorbance band was observed at 3200-3700 cm À1 and 1620-1640 cm À1 for the "SiAOH vibration, 1088 cm À1 for the SiAOASi asymmetrical stretching vibration, and 1000-1200 cm À1 , 780-820 cm À1 , and 430-460 cm À1 for the SiAOASi strain stretching vibrations. Solid-state 29 Si MAS NMR spectroscopy is generally used to investigate the chemical environment of 29 Si atoms. According to the report of Legrand et al. [21] , the resonances of the different species of Si atoms in silica are located between À80 and À110 ppm, as identified by the Q n terminology. Q 0 denotes the silicon with no SiAOASi linkage and Q n denotes the silicon with n SiAOASi linkages, where n = 1-4. Generally, the tetra substitution (Q 4 ) results in a characteristic peak between À100 and À110 ppm. Similarly Q 3 occurs between À90 and À100 ppm and Q 2 occurs between À80 and À90 ppm. Fig. 3a shows the 29 Si solid-state NMR spectrum of the as-prepared silica aerogel. Its Q 4 characteristic peak appeared at À110 ppm, Q 3 at À102 ppm, and Q 2 at À92 ppm. Their proportion in as-prepared silica aerogel was Q 4 :Q 3 :Q 2 = 55.9:39.0:5.1. This suggests that more than 87.7% of the silanol groups were condensed during the sol-gel aging process. It can be concluded that the aerogel product had a stable silica network structure. Fig. 3b shows the 29 Si solid-state NMR spectrum for post-modification of hydroxyl to epoxy functional groups. Its T 3 characteristic peaks appeared at À66 ppm and T 2 at À57 ppm with a simultaneous Q 3 proportion that had dropped to 14.6%, indicating that about 22.3% of the aerogel surface was converted to the epoxy functional group. BET is an instrument utilized to probe the porosity, specific surface area, pore structure, and other physical surface prosperities of a material using an inert working gas. The extent of gas adsorption on the material is closely related to the nature of the sample and the gas. It is also dependent on the working pressure and temperature. An adsorption isotherm, which plots the amount of gas adsorption per unit weight of sample against the ratio of working pressure to the saturated vapor pressure of the gas, is usually presented as the measurement result. Fig. 4 shows the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm of the silica aerogel product, which exhibited a type-IV isotherm based on the classification of Brunauer et al. [22] . In this type of material, adsorption occurs in the micropores at very low pressure, followed by adsorption in the mesopores, with capillary condensation occurring at higher pressures, leading to the hysteresis loops [23] . The measurement indicated a specific surface area of 813 m 2 g À1 , pore volume of 0.78 cm 3 g À1 , and average pore diameter of 4.2 nm. After the epoxy modification, these levels dropped to 471 m 2 g À1 , 0.48 cm 3 g À1 , and 3.7 nm, respectively. The data suggest that modified silica aerogel was still a mesoporous material. Its large surface area ensured that the detection signal of the captured biological samples on the surface can be greatly intensified. Fig. 5 shows the magnified SEM image of silica aerogel. As shown in the image, the cluster surface is formed by a great many silica nanoparticles with an average size of around 100 nm. The interstitial space between those particles provides extensive capturing sites available for biological samples. Fig. 6a shows the arrayed aerogel dots on a slide ready for immobilizing the capturing probes. Fig. 6b shows the corresponding experimental design, which is with two replicated columns, especially for the experiment on the top four rows and controls on the bottom row. The positive and negative control spots validated the experimental process, normally with the positive signal on and the negative signal off. The binding capability of the as-prepared aerogel was initially investigated to preliminarily determine the optimal probe immobi- 7 . Determination of optimal probe concentration. Sp5-Cy3 (60-mer) served as the test DNA to preliminarily investigate the binding capacity of the as-prepared aerogel with DNA samples. Two replicated aerogel-dot columns were arrayed and the test DNA was loaded in a concentration titration of 100, 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01 lM. Cy3 fluorescence intensity was presented in a 32-bit colorimetric scale, with red the most intense, black the lowest, and white beyond the analysis capability of the image scanner (saturation). lization concentration by the test DNA, Sp5-cy3. As shown in the images of Fig. 7 , the fluorescence intensity was observed to vary with the Sp5 (60-mer) concentration of 10-0.1 lM. This can be compared with the low background generated by the aerogel at 0.01 lM of Sp5 DNA. Probe concentrations above 10 lM not only consumed excessive materials but pushed the intensity readings beyond the limit of the instrument. We thus chose 10-0.1 lM to further optimize the gene probe's concentration for immobilization. As shown in Fig. 8 , the optimization result showed that the best performance was with 10 lM ATP5Oc, so this concentration was adopted for further tests to demonstrate the functionality of molecular recognition. In the beginning, the ATP5Oc-immobilized aerogel prepared with the slide without acetone-washing was utilized to recognize the target human gene ATP5O. However, a heterogeneous DNAsample distribution was found on dots of the aerogel biochip (data not shown), indicating that the aerogel particles were unevenly distributed in the dots of the slide. This result was believed due to the slide's surface hydrophilicity caused by the pre-cleaning procedure. In order to improve it, another recognition test was carried out with the acetone-cleaned slide and the result is shown in Fig. 9 . The dots afterward became smaller, i.e., the aerogel particles had larger contact angle with the slide, and the majority part of each dots showed more homogeneous color, indicating that a better quality of the chip was achieved. In addition, the positive control dots on the bottom left of the aerogel slides was much brighter than that of the planar slides, indicating that the capturing capacity of the aerogel slide was much larger than that of the planar slide. At low-medium concentrations, both types of slides showed similar signal intensity. At concentrations of 40-120 nM, the flat surface started to reach its accommodation saturation for target molecules, but the intensity of the aerogel spot was increased with the concentration, indicating that the amount of the captured DNA was increased accordingly. Especially, at 360 nM, the aerogel spots even more obviously appeared higher capturing ability than the planar spots. In addition, the advantage of the larger amount of DNA captured by our aerogel biochip can be seen in Fig. 10 . Here, 1 ll of 20 nM DNA target was first added onto all top-four-row aerogel dots and then the slide was washed to remove the unbounded sample. The same procedure, including the target addition and the slide cleaning, was then applied to the top-three-row, top-two-row, and top-one-row dots for the second, third and fourth time, sequentially. Thus, the accumulated sample volume of each aerogel-spot row became 4, 3, 2 and 1 ll. After repeated washes, some aerogel dropped off from the slide to cause donut-shape spots, but the signal trend can still easily be seen. The 1 ll-sample row developed less signal intensity than that developed by the same samplevolume spot at Fig. 9 due to repeated washes. However, it is still clear that aerogel spots loaded with more sample volume significantly gained in signal intensity. The 4 ll sample row obviously had signal intensity higher than the 20 nM sample in Fig. 9 . It can thus be concluded that the aerogel functions as a sample reservoir collecting more samples to intensify detection signal. We had also run the identical experiment on a planar slide for a side-by-side comparison. The signal was again intensified with more DNA target added on the planar slide. Therefore a certain concentration can be detected more clearly with more DNA on both types of slides. However, as 3-4 ll of sample was applied, the aerogel slide started to exhibit orange and white colors, indicating that much more target DNA was captured and confirming much higher sample-binding capacity for the aerogel slide than the planar one. A blank test was also performed to clarify whether or not the previously observed signal should be attributed to the physical clogging of aerogel pores by DNA target, instead of to sequence specificity. The test was conducted by repeating the previous experiment on four target concentrations but on a plain aerogel surface, i.e., with no probe immobilization. The low background, as shown in Fig. 11 , indicates that the signals observed previously indeed came from the probe-target recognition. Fig. 12 shows the repeated test on a longer gene. In this test, human gene CANX (1027b) served as the DNA target and the applied conditions were identical to the previous shorter gene. As shown in the images, the longer DNA did not have a good penetration capability into the porous aerogel and thus generated a much lower intensity than flat slides since the screening effect of the aerogel had more effect on the longer gene. Fig. 13 shows the recognition test for a non-specific DNA target on the as-prepared aerogel. Human gene PSMA5 (432b) was recognized on the aerogel surfaces by 10 lM ATP5Oc probe, which was immobilized on the aerogel. PSMA5 target spread over the aerogel was 0, 40, 120, and 360 nM from the left to right slides with 8 replicate dots on each slide. Sp5-cy3 (10 lM) served as the positive (bottom left) and hybridization buffer as the negative controls (bottom right). The low background level suggests that our aerogel biochips were free from non-specific sequence recognition.
