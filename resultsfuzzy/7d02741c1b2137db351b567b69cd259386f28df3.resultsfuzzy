test results in panel B reveal that panel regressions based on the models I and II are statistically significant at the 10% level, but not for model IV, implying that the fixed effects method is appropriate for models I and II, and the random effects method is appropriate for model IV. Panel regression test results of the impact of CCG on ROA, ROE, TQ and SR are summarized in Tables 4-6. 2 Each table also presents test results with only the main explanatory variables, CCG and CCG 2 , excluding the control variables. Table 4 summarizes the panel regression test results of the effects of CCG on profitability measured by ROA and ROE. As shown in panel A, the corresponding coefficients of CCG and CCG 2 on ROA are 14.645 and -7.041, both of which are statistically significant at the 1% level. The significance of coefficients of CCG and CCG 2 remains when control variables GSALE and SIZE are included in the regression test. The positive coefficient of CCG and the negative coefficient of CCG 2 suggest that the relationship between CCG and ROA is curvilinear (i.e. an inverted Ushaped relationship between CCG and ROA). The explanatory power of CCG and CCG 2 on ROA, represented by adjusted R 2 value, is 22.3% (see panel A). Panel C of Table 4 reports that the corresponding coefficients of CCG and CCG 2 on ROE are 22.956 and −11.102, both are statistically significant at the 1% level. Test results also indicate an inverted Ushaped relationship between CCG and ROE. The significant influence of CCG and CCG 2 on ROE remains when test equation includes the control variables of GSALE and SIZE (see panel D). The explanatory Adjusted R 2 = 0.175 Prob. (F-statistic) = 0.000 Notes: CCG = (total corporate giving value)/(sale revenues) × 100. ROA (return on assets) = (net income)/(total assets). ROE (return on equity) = (net income)/(total equity). GSALE = the growth rate of sales and SIZE = the natural logarithm of the total assets. * Significant at the 10% level. ** Significant at the 5% level. *** Significant at the 1% level. power of CCG and CCG 2 on ROE is 15.6%, showing that CCG and CCG 2 can explain a higher percentage of variation in ROA than in ROE. However, neither CCG nor CCG 2 have a significant impact on SR. The coefficient of CCG, as shown in panel A of Table 5 , is negative, indicating that CCG lowers the stock return, but the negative influence is not statistically significant. The square term of CCG has a positive but insignificant effect on SR. The explanatory power of Adjusted R 2 = 0.053 Prob. (F-statistic) = 0.045 Notes: CCG = (total corporate giving value)/(sale revenues) × 100. SR = stock return. GSALE = the growth rate of sales and SIZE = the natural logarithm of the total assets. *** Significant at the 1% level. Adjusted R 2 = 0.415 Prob. (F-statistic) = 0.000 Notes: CCG = (total corporate giving value)/(sale revenues) × 100. TQ (Tobin's Q) = (market value of a firm)/(the replacement costs of assets). GSALE = the growth rate of sales and SIZE = the natural logarithm of the total assets. ** Significant at the 5% level. *** Significant at the 1% level. CCG and CCG 2 on SR is as low as 0.58%. Similar results are found after the control variables are included in the test equation shown in panel B. Test results of the impact of CCG on TQ are shown in Table 6 . The coefficients of CCG and CCG 2 are 281.117 and −122.541 and both are significant at the 5% level (see panel A). The results also suggest an inverted U-shaped relationship between CCG and TQ. The significant impact of CCG and CCG 2 on TQ remains when test equation includes the control variables of GSALE and SIZE (see panel B). The explanatory power of CCG and CCG 2 on TQ is high at 39.5%. Test results in Tables 4-6 reveal that the control variable GSALE has a significantly positive effect on ROA and ROE at the 5% level (see Table 4 ) and on SR at the 1% level (see Table 5 ). However, the effect of GSALE on TQ is not statistically significant (see Table 6 ). Firm size is significantly and negatively related to ROA, ROE (Table 4) and TQ (Table 6 ) at the 1% level. However, the relationship between SIZE and SR is not statistically significant (Table 5) . To provide a robustness check for whether test results of the impact of CCG and CCG 2 on hospitality firm performance (in terms of ROA, ROE, SR and TQ) reported in Tables 4-6 could be largely driven by a few observations with a relatively high value of CG and hence a high value of CCG, the study removes three influential observations (as shown in Table 1 ) and performs all panel regression tests again. Table 7 presents panel regression test results of a robustness check. Indeed, the test results of the effects of CCG and CCG 2 on hospitality firm performance in panel A of Table 7 are not significantly different from those reported in Tables 4-6 . Moreover, we remove the most influential hospitality firm (Ambassador Hotel) from the sample and re-run all analyses. Similarly, test results in panel B of Table 7 indicate that the coefficients of CCG and CCG 2 on ROA, ROE and TQ are still significant, suggesting that the inverted U-shaped relationship between CCG and corporate performance (ROA, ROE and TQ) remains.
