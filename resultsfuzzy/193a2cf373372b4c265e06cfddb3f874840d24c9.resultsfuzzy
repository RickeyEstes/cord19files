2.1. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) The original data contained four quality control (QC) samples and 24 experimental samples, and 1914 peaks were extracted. The original data were then adjusted by missing value recoding and normalization analysis. In total, 447 peaks were reserved and annotated. To provide an overview of the similarities and differences among the samples, we used PCA to annotate the compounds of I.indigotica (Fig. 1) .The total variance rate explained by PC1 and PC2 were 51.8% and 14.6%, respectively. In this model, the quality control (QC) samples gathered in the center of the score plot and the test samples of three nitrogen groups were separated obviously. The samples were all in the 95% confidence interval (Hotelling's T-squared ellipse), reflecting the stable detection conditions and good repeatability of the analysis process. The PCA plot of untargeted liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) data showed that the metabolic profiles of I.indigotica changed significantly in N-deficiency stress. To further investigate the effect of N-deficiency on metabolites of I.indigotica and to obtain group discrimination, we subjected the sample data to orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). By OPLS-DA, we could filter out orthogonal variables in metabolites that were not related to categorical variables, and analyzed nonorthogonal variables and orthogonal variables separately to obtain more reliable meta-group differences and experiments (Trygg and Wold, 2002) . All models passed the displacement test. To identify differential metabolites of the N deficient treatments in root and leaf samples, we performed multivariate data analysis with Student's t-test and fold change methods. As the screening criteria, we use the p＜0.05 (t-test) and VIP＞1 at the same time to obtain the differential metabolites between the low nitrogen treatments and CK. Then we visualized the results of screening differential metabolites in the form of volcano plots (Fig. 2) . The differential metabolites of roots in nitrogen deficient treatments were greater than those in leaves, and the up-regulated metabolites were greater than the down-regulated metabolites in N-deficient treatments. These results indicated that the roots had a more positive response to low nitrogen stress.
