Nine cases were successfully treated, 1 case succumbed to respiratory failure, and the success rate was 90%. Condition assessment and diagnosis. A detailed inquiry of the medical history was carried out to determine whether the children patients had a history of recurrent respiratory tract infection, and whether they had measles, whooping cough and other respiratory diseases prior to onset, as well as whether the children patients had a full-term birth or asphyxia, and if the growth and development of children patients after birth was normal (16) (17) (18) . Conditions such as fever, cough, extent of choked asthma, the presence or absence of breathing, faster heart rate, pulmonary rales, orthopnea, nose flap, three depression signs and cyanosis, as well as clinical manifestations of infected circulatory, digestive, and nervous system were assessed. Evaluation of blood routine examination, chest X-ray, and etiology test results were conducted. Psychological and social conditions of children and parents were also assessed (19) . Common condition assessment and diagnostic criteria included: i) Air exchange impairment, related to lung inflammation; ii) invalid airway clearance, related to excessive and sticky respiratory secretions, frail children patients, and inability to expectorate; iii) hyperthermia, related to lung infection; and iv) malnutrition, related to inadequate intake, increased consumption. Close observation of the condition. Attention was paid to changes in total peripheral resistance blood pressure (BP), the presence of double suction, such as nodding-like breathing, apnea and other conditions indicating respiratory failure. The presence of exacerbation of dyspnea, dysphoria, quickening heart rate, and an enlarged liver in a short period of time suggested heart failure (20) (21) (22) . Children patients with severe wheezing often suffered respiratory acidosis due to retention of carbon dioxide. Drowsiness, convulsions or coma in sick children suggested an occurrence of toxic encephalopathy. Medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthmatic drugs, cardiac drugs and other medications were administered to patients at the appropriate dosage, the appropriate time and in an accurate manner. Side effects of various drugs were observed, and if children patients showed signs of dysphoria, quickening heart rate, worsening asthma, or enlarged liver in a short period of time, indicating heart failure, then the infusion rate was reduced. In our study, close observation of consciousness, pupil changes and muscle tension was carried out, and if manifestations of intracranial pressure such as drowsiness, convulsions, irregular breathing and increased muscle tension appeared, immediate rescue steps were taken. Abdominal distension and decreased or disappearing bowel sounds were observed, in order to detect toxic intestinal paralysis in time (23) . Emergency treatment and therapy for respiratory failure. Type I respiratory failure refers to the lone presence of hypoxemia and absence of hypercapnia, featuring ventilation dysfunctions, blood change of PaO 2 ≤60 mmHg, and PaCO 2 which can be maintained at normal level or reduced (24) . Type I respiratory failure also refers to the coexistence of hypoxemia and hypercapnia, impairment of ventilatory function and gas exchange functions, severe lung lesion, obstruction of trachea and bronchia caused by sticky secretions, blood change of PaO 2 <60 mmHg, and PaCO 2 >50 mmHg. Main clinical manifestations of children patients with type I pneumonia with respiratory failure include, poor mental state or dysphoria, polypnea, cyanosis of lips, dyspnea, nasal flaring and three depression signs. These symptoms are difficult to distinguish from type II respiratory failure, and can be observed only by blood gas analysis, which shows a marked difference between type I and II. Type II respiratory failure shows symptoms of type I respiratory failure and in addition more often than not, it also has symptoms such as shallow breathing, irregular rhythm, slow breathing, drowsiness or coma and even jaw breathing in some patients (25, 26) . In our study, changes in condition and changes in blood were closely observed, and where required, a tracheal intubation ventilator was employed to improve the cure rate. Oxygen uptake. Nasal catheter is easily blocked by secretions, leading to failure of effective uptake oxygen, and is therefore difficult to utilize. We employed the conventional oxygen mask inhalation method, which is comfortable and without stimulation, and was easily accepted by children (27, 28) . After using oxygen, once hypoxia was improved, timely adjustment of the oxygen flow or deactivation of oxygen was needed, because inadequate oxygen concentration such as excessive or overtime concentration may lead to changes such as lung tissue edema atelectasis and proliferation of alveolar capillary. The humidification bottle contained 50% alcohol, aiming to reduce the alveolar surface tension and help improve ventilation. Maintenance of airway patency and administration of various aerosol inhalation therapies. i) This group of children patients took appropriate clinostatism according to the state of disease. Under normal conditions, the children were placed in a horizontal position, with neck raised high, in order that airways would be unblocked. For children patients with severe heart failure and wheezing, semi-recumbent position was taken to reduce the burden on the heart and lungs (29, 30) . For children patients with increased respiratory secretions, the lateral position was useful to expectorate and prevent aspiration. ii) Patients received daily routine aerosol inhalation, turning drugs into aerialfog-like fine particles, inhaled to the bronchioles or alveoli, which diluted secretions and had an anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic function and reduced local inflammatory exudates, in addition to reducing airway resistance and improving ventilation. Aerosol inhalation time was 10-15 min and afterwards sputum suction was carried out immediately in order to clear respiratory secretions. Commonly used drugs included: 20,000 units of gentamicin, 2-3 mg of α-chymotrypsin, 1-2 mg of dexamethasone, and 20 ml of saline. The dual role of the aforementioned ultrasonic aerosol inhalation was useful to reinforce treatment of children with severe pneumonia. According to the disease, aerosol inhalation was conducted every 4 or 6 h, with sputum suction ensuing, which produced a good suction effect for children patients with many sticky respiratory secretions. It should be noted that if patients had excessive sputum, the sputum suction was also carried out once prior to using ultrasound aerosol inhalation therapy, followed by thorough sputum suction. In the whole process of aerosol inhalation, providing oxygen inhalation or enhancing oxygen concentration effectively prevented the occurrence of hypoxemia (31) . iii) Hypocalcemia may produce laryngospasm and tongue tenesmus, which causes obstruction and sudden suffocation. First, the child patient's tongue tip was pulled outside the mouth, and then artificial respiration was conducted, with most patients being able to relieve themselves spontaneously. Pressurized oxygen was given, endotracheal intubation was carried out if necessary and calcium was replenished immediately. iv) When nasal obstruction caused breathing difficulties, 1% ephedrine drops were used after clearing away nasal secretions with a cotton swab, to maintain the airway patency. v) The diet of children with severe pneumonia was affected due to high fever, vomiting, diarrhea and other factors. When children patients were unable to eat, it was appropriate to supplement water, electrolytes, vitamins, and give them high-calorie, high protein, digestible food, that was eaten in small amounts but frequently, to prevent satiety from interfering with respiratory function. vi) Previous findings showed that, ambroxol and low-dose heparin coupled with aerosol inhalation significantly shortened the time of the disappearance of all the clinical signs and improved overall efficiency of the clinical treatment (32, 33) . There was no bleeding and other adverse reactions involved in the clinical treatment process, which had advantages such as easy administration, safe use, inexpensiveness, a significant effect, and less adverse effects in the treatment of children with severe pneumonia, and was thus worthy of wider application.
