3.1. The particle distribution of fly ash Using 300 g sample, particle size analysis of the raw fly ash and the powder activated carbon injected in the air pollution control devices of the incinerator was performed from À25 lm (À400 mesh) to +106 lm (+150 mesh) by wet sieving. Each size fraction was analyzed for the carbon content, i.e. LOI. The results are given in Table 2 . It indicates that about 98% of the raw fly ash has a particle size less than 106 lm which is most suitable for froth flotation (Uçurum, 2009) . LOI is 19.35% of the finest fraction (À25 lm) and LOI decreased with the increasing of particle size, which is opposition with coal fly ash whose carbon substance is enriched in the coarse size fraction (Altun et al., 2009) . Most of the carbon constituents of the raw fly ash distribute in particle size below 75 lm, which may be related to the injected powder activated carbon. It can be seen ( Table 2 ) that powder activated carbon has 74% particles with diameters lower than 38 lm and their LOI is above 67%.
