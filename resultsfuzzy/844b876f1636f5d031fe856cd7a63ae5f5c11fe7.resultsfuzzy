Immunodepleted BAL samples from WT and KO mice following exposure to filtered air or ozone (n = 4 for each of the groups under study) were subjected to 2D-DIGE and analyzed with Progenesis SameSpots. The arrangement of samples on the gels is shown in Figure 2 , including the switching of samples between Cy3 and Cy5 to prevent any potential dye bias. We were able to match a total of 454 protein spots in all of the samples. Figure 1 Characteristics of BAL cells. Following BAL the cells were removed by centrifugation and counted. Total cell numbers (A) were determined from an aliquot of cell suspension applied to a hemocytometer. Differential cell counts (B) were obtained by making cytocentrifuge preparations of BAL cells and doing differential cell counts. Gray bars represent FA-exposed samples and black bars represent ozone-exposed samples. Note that FA-exposed values are plotted in B, but values are very small (0.125% and 0% for WT and KO, respectively). Comparisons that were significantly different are indicated by a bracket and pvalues.
