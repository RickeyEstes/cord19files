NPA samples for RT-PCR were taken from all patients at admission; samples from 156 patients (71.6%) were positive. The mean time from disease onset to sample collection was 4.4 Â± 2.3 days. No significant difference in the mean sampling time was found between RT-PCR-positive or -negative patients. The optimal time for sample collection was day 8-10 when 13 of 14 patients (92.9%) were positive (Figure) .
