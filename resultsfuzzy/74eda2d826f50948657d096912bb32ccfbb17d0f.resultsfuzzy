We were interested only in studies of individual-level resilience but did not identify suitable search terms to exclude studies of resilience at higher and lower level units at the title/abstract screening stage. Furthermore, we did not limit the search to studies with resilience in the results sections of articles since this also had the potential to miss relevant studies. Thus, a large number of articles (5909) were yielded at this stage. Of these, 36 met inclusion criteria (figure 1). Although there are related and potentially overlapping terms, such as resistance and adaptation, we limited our search to the specific term of resilience used by the original authors.
