Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of HCV in a wide variety of nonserological fluids [7, 10] ; for instance, HCV has been detected in about 50% of saliva samples from plasma-positive individuals [11] . We reasoned that HCV might be present in nasal secretions at a similar prevalence and would therefore be detectable among a relatively small sample of viremic patients. Five consecutive plasma-positive clinic patients were selected for study and each contributed blood and nasal secretion samples for HCV RT-PCR analysis. The RT-PCR results confirmed the presence of HCV in the blood of all five subjects. The highest serum concentrations of viral RNA were detected in subjects 1 and 2 and the lowest in subject 5 (see Fig. 1 ); these findings were consistent with patient record viral loads. It is noteworthy that our assay detected HCV RNA in the serum of subject 5 (previously below the level of detection with commercially available assays), indicating low-level viremia, and verifying the high sensitivity of our analysis. HCV RNA detection from serum and nasal secretions of five intranasal drug users Significantly, HCV particles were also detected from the nasal secretions of subject 1 (Fig. 1) . This subject, a 56year-old African-American male, also exhibited the highest HCV serum viral load (34 500 000 IU/mL). HCV was not detected in the nasal secretions of the other four study subjects. This finding represents the first demonstration of the presence of HCV RNA in nasal secretions. Great care was taken to avoid sample contamination during all phases of the study. Blood samples of known serology were collected from each of the five subjects and tested for HCV RNA to confirm the validity of our laboratory procedures. The TRIzol assay used on the nasal secretion samples in this study has been shown to be effective for RNA isolation with a variety of other nonserological samples [11, 12] .
