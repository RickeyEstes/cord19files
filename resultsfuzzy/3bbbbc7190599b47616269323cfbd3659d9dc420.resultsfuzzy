For all positive-strand RNA viruses, the reliability and efficiency of a reverse genetics system depend on the genetic stability of a cloned fulllength cDNA, whose sequence is equivalent to the consensus sequence of viral genomic RNA. 27 Figure 1 shows a five-step strategy for the construction of a full-length infectious cDNA as a BAC for JEV SA 14 -14-2 28 : Step 1, purification of viral RNA from the cell culture supernatant of JEV-infected BHK-21 cells (Figure 1A) ; Step 2, synthesis of four overlapping cDNA amplicons (F1 to F4) spanning the whole viral genome ( Figure 1B); Step 3, subcloning of each of the four contiguous cDNA fragments into a BAC vector, creating pBAC/F1 to pBAC/F4 ( Figure 1C) ; Step 4, modification of the cloned cDNAs for in vitro run-off transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase, i.e., placing an SP6 promoter sequence immediately upstream of the viral 5'-end (pBAC/F1 Step 5, assembly of a full-length SA 14 -14-2 cDNA BAC, pBAC/SA 14 -14-2 ( Figure 1E) . Table 1 lists the oligonucleotides used in this cloning procedure. 28 For the construction of a functional JEV cDNA, the first important step is the synthesis of the four overlapping cDNA fragments using the purified viral RNA as a template for RT-PCR. Figure 2 provides a representative result for the four RT-PCR products that were electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel. This gel demonstrates clearly that a full-length JEV cDNA is amplified into four overlapping cDNA fragments. Occasionally, RT-PCR reactions might yield one or more additional virus-specific or nonspecific products that are mostly smaller than the expected product, because of the nonspecific annealing of primers during cDNA synthesis/amplification. On the other hand, little or no expected RT-PCR product would be amplified because of accidental RNase contamination during the viral RNA isolation or improper RT-PCR performance. The next key step is the cloning and modification of a partial-or full-length JEV cDNA in BAC, which is a relatively straightforward procedure that uses standard recombinant DNA techniques. 69 Figure 3 presents a representative outcome for the purification of the BAC clone containing a fulllength cDNA of JEV SA 14 -14-2 by banding in a CsCl-EtBr gradient. In this experiment, after centrifugation for 16 hr at 401,700 × g, two distinct bands, i.e., the E. coli chromosomal DNA above and the supercoiled BAC plasmid DNA below, are visible in the middle of the tube under longwave ultraviolet light. A minimal volume (~400 µl) of the lower BAC DNA band was carefully collected by poking a hole with a syringe on the side of the tube. Subsequently, the EtBr was extracted from the BAC DNA by butanol extraction, and the EtBr-free BAC DNA was concentrated by ethanol precipitation. The final step is the determination of the specific infectivity of the synthetic RNAs transcribed in vitro from the full-length SA 14 -14-2 BAC (pBAC/ SA 14 -14-2) after RNA transfection into permissive cells (Figure 4 ). This step involves three sequential steps: Step 1, linearization of the fulllength SA 14 -14-2 cDNA at the 3'-end of the viral genome ( Figure 4A) ; Step 2, production of synthetic RNAs from the linearized cDNA by runoff transcription ( Figure 4B); and Step 3, rescue of the recombinant viruses in BHK-21 cells transfected with the synthetic RNAs ( Figure 4C) . Experimentally, two independent clones of pBAC/SA 14 -14-2 were linearized with Xba I digestion and treated with MBN to remove the fourbase 5' overhang generated by the Xba I digestion. The linearized BACs were cleaned up by phenol-chloroform extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation. The linearization of the two purified BACs was demonstrated on a 0.8% agarose gel ( Figure 5A) . The phenol-chloroform extraction must be done carefully to ensure that the linearized BACs are RNase-free. Each of the two linearized BACs served as a cDNA template for runoff transcription using SP6 RNA polymerase in the presence of the m 7 G(5')ppp(5')A cap analog. The integrity of the synthetic RNAs was shown by running aliquots of the two transcription reaction mixtures on a 0.6% agarose gel, along with a reference 1 kb DNA ladder ( Figure 5B) . In this simple assay, the major prominent RNA band always migrated just below the 3 kb reference DNA band and appeared to be sharp. However, degraded RNA would have a smeared appearance on the same gel. An infectious center assay is the gold standard for determining the specific infectivity of the synthetic RNAs. This assay was done by electroporating BHK-21 cells with RNA samples, seeding equal aliquots of the 10-fold serially diluted electroporated cells in 6-well plates containing naïve BHK-21 cells (3 × 10 5 cells/well), and overlaying agarose onto the cell monolayers. After incubation for 4 days, surviving cells were fixed with formaldehyde and stained with a crystal violet solution to quantify the number of infectious centers (plaques), which corresponds to the number of infectious RNA molecules delivered into the cells (Figure 6A ). Since the cDNA template used for in vitro transcription has been proven to be non-infectious, 27 an aliquot of the transcription reaction mixture was directly used for electroporation. Electroporation is the preferred method for RNA transfection; alternatively, RNAs can be transfected by other methods using DEAE-dextran and cationic liposomes. RNA electroporation is very effective, but "arcing" of the electric pulse occurs rarely if salts are present in the electroporation reaction or if the electroporation cuvette is reused. The expression of viral proteins in RNA-transfected cells was examined by immunofluorescence assays using an anti-NS1 rabbit antiserum ( Figure 6B) . The production of viral particles accumulated in the supernatants of RNA-transfected cells was analyzed by plaque assays (Figure 6C) . Nucleotide position refers to the complete genome sequence of JEV SA 14 -14-2 (Genbank accession number JN604986).
