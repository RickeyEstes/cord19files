Our preliminary investigation showed that the older generation agrees more with "suffering a loss is good fortune" than the younger generation, and Study 2 showed that individuals' CLS scores increased with age. Those findings were consistent with the present finding that the past CLS scores collected by the retrospective method were lower than the current CLS scores and that there was no significant difference in past CLS scores among the groups. This consistency to some extent implied that the retrospective method was reliable. Reverse-predictive effect of Chikui likelihood on SEI and SWB We used hierarchical regression to test the reverse-predictive effect of CLS scores recalled for the past on SEI and SWB. The control variables were gender, age, education years, working years, and CLS scores assessed for the present. As shown in Table 12 and Figure 4 , the CLS scores recalled for the past significantly positively predicted SEI (β = 0.46, p < 0.05; ΔR 2 = 0.03, p < 0.05) for 20+-year alumni but did not predict current SWB for any of the three groups. In short, utilizing a retrospective method to measure participants' CLS score from years past, we found that the current relationship between Chikui likelihood and material (but not mental) benefits could be extended when asking participants to recall and assess their retrospective CLS score from years past. That is, CLS scores recalled for the past were correlated with higher levels of SEI in the present. This effect was strengthened as the interval between the time point of the memories and the present increased. Apparently, the prediction of SEI from earlier past CLS scores presented a time lag and an accumulated effect. This finding is consistent with a remark by Zheng Banqiao: "Losers gain more gradually (亏 者盈之渐)." However, this effect was not found in the relationship between Chikui likelihood and mental benefit. In sum, Study 3 duplicated the result of Study 2. The current CLS score was positively related to SEI and SWB. Furthermore, Study 3 verified the conjecture derived from Study 2. That is, the positive effect of Chikui likelihood on SEI became more significant as people aged, but the effect of Chikui likelihood on SWB did not change with time. We found that CLS scores recalled for the distant past (over 20 years) could significantly positively predict SEI, but this was not the case for the near past (1-year alumni and 10-to 13-year alumni). This effect was not found in the relationship between Chikui likelihood and mental benefits, which suggests that mental reward is gained spontaneously.
