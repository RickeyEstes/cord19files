The calculated binding energy values and hot spots of the wild type complexes are shown in Table 1 . The complexes ACE2-RBD (AE/BF) and 80R-RBD (AB/CD) show a close correlation between their interaction energies (−15.78/−14.82 kcal/mol versus −18.36/−16.53 kcal/mol) and buried surface area (1700Å 2 versus 2200Å 2 ), gap volume (7000Å 3 versus 4000Å 3 ), or binding affinity (1.70 nM versus 1.59 nM) (Hwang et al., 2006) . Those obvious associations indicate that the higher geometric complementarity, corresponding to the larger buried surface area and the smaller gap volume, offers the complex 80R-RBD rather than the complex ACE2-RBD the lower interaction energy and consequently the stronger binding affinity. Similarly, the correlation of binding energy with buried surface area is also found for the complex m396-RBD in which the heavy chain and the light chain contribute 66% and 34% to the total buried surface (Prabakaran et al., 2006) . And the RBD association energy of the former chain (−8.64 kcal/mol) is remarkably lower than that of the latter (−5.42 kcal/mol). The perfect agreements of computational predictions with structural observations or biochemical evidences strongly suggest the reliability of our protocols. As to the hot spots of complexes, the consistency between computational predictions and experimental evidences is clearly detected for RBD and receptor. In ACE2-RBD complexes, three receptor residues (GLU37, ASP38 and TYR41 on the chain A of complex AE or GLU37, TYR41 and LYS353 on the chain B of complex BF) form one hot spot cluster interacting with another hot cluster formed by five or six RBD residues (ARG426, TYR436, TYR475, TYR484 and TYR491 on the chain E of complex AE and the chain F of complex BF, whereas ASN473 only on the chain F). The interactions between the two hot clusters make the major contribution to the binding free energy of ACE2-RBD complexes. Notably, our predictions are in agreement with previous experimental alanine mutagenesis, which identified two hot spots on RBD (ARG426 and ASN473) (Chakraborti et al., 2005) and another two on receptor (TYR41 and LYS353) . In addition, computational alanine scanning on the sister complexes AB and CD successfully identify a RBD hot spot (ASP480) revealed in mutational binding analyses (Sui et al., 2005) . In sharp contrast to ACE2, the antibody 80R possesses four hot residues (TYR102, ASN164, ARG223 and TRP226) being scattered on the binding surface rather than centralized into a cluster. The difference in the number and distribution of hot spots might account for the large gap between the interaction energies of 80R-RBD (−18.3627 and −16.5309 kcal/mol) and those of ACE2-RBD (−15.7765 and The complexes AE and BF with the chains A, B for ACE2 and the chains E, F for RBD; the complexes AB and CD with the chains A, C for RBD and the chains B, D for 80R; the complexes HS and LS with the chains H, L and S for heavy and light chains of m396 plus RBD. for association with RBD, or the higher spike-binding affinity of 80R compared to that of receptor. Finally, only two neighboring hot spots (TRP91 and ASP92) are found on the light chain of m396 while none on the heavy chain. Thus, an interesting discovery is the fact that among the five or six ACE2-binding hot spots of RBD, three (TYR436, TYR484 and TYR491) are simultaneously 80R-neutralizing hot spots whereas only one (TYR491) is important for m396 neutralization. This finding indicates that 80R might have the greater potential than m396 for inhibition of spike-mediated infection. In summary, the consistency of calculations with experiments mentioned above further validates our approaches to characterize protein-protein interactions. The predicted replacements on spike RBD, cellular receptor or neutralizing antibody with significant increase in binding affinity are listed in Table 2 . The comparisons between virtual mutants derived from sister complexes of ACE2-RBD or 80R-RBD consistently identify a number of substitutions worth of biochemical and immunological experimental tests. For instance, recent experimental evidences revealed the great potential of ACE2 in the protection of several animal models from SARS-CoV-induced lung injury or severe acute lung failure Kuba et al., 2005 Kuba et al., , 2006 . Simultaneously, the crystal structures of the native and inhibitor-bound forms of ACE2 Towler et al., 2004; Turner et al., 2004) successfully laid a solid foundation for the discovery of novel small-molecule inhibitors of its enzymatic activity or spikemediated virus entry by chemical genetics (Huentelman et al., 2004; Kao et al., 2004) and the identification of its crucial activesite residues by site-directed mutagenesis (Guy et al., 2005a,b) . Very recently, a modest anti-SARS activity (IC 50 ≈ 0.1 mM) was observed for an ACE2-derived peptide containing two segments of receptor (residues 22-44 and 351-357) linked by glycine (Han et al., 2006) . It should be pointed out that both the experimentally confirmed hot spots (TYR41 and LYS353) and the predicted sites for replacements (THR27, LYS31 and HIS34) are nested in those two segments. Similarly, a small peptide derived from spike protein (residues 483-493) also block viral receptor recognition with IC 50 of 6.99 nM (Ho et al., 2006) . And our calculated two hot spots (TYR484 and TYR491) in combination with two target positions (TYR484 and GLN492) are located in this short fragment, too. Consequently, it is reasonable to anticipate that our blueprint could effectively increase the binding affinity of the two novel peptides to disrupt SARS-CoV infection.
