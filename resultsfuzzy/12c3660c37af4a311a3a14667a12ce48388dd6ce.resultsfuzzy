Journals themes expanded to focus on treatment and prevention after the outbreak onset. Within the review articles, while most of the scored topics saw a decreased frequency of representation after the 2013 outbreak began (Table 3) , there were several topics that received much greater attention after 2013. Review articles were far more likely to discuss elements needed for treatment and containment after the outbreak. For example, mentioning of contact tracing and isolation, detailing the recommended PPE, and the treatment recommendations were all more likely to appear after 2013. It is worth noting that the treatment and containment topics did not contain new information; this information garnered increased focus but did not differ from pre-2013 manuscripts as to reflect 'lessons learned' during the outbreak. Topics that did appear de novo after 2013 included the increased risk of spontaneous abortion for pregnant females and the established finding that hiccups may be a manifestation of EVD, which was overlooked by the review articles selected. The hiccup finding is not a trivial one; it was reported that MSF received early reports of patients with viral syndromes accompanied by hiccups [17] . While this is not a pathognomonic finding, a clustering of suspicious deaths, which included the presence of hiccups alerted MSF officials that the outbreak potentially represented a serious outbreak of hemorrhagic fever. This was the basis for their early appeals to the World Health Organization (WHO) to provide a rapid response to the first EVD outbreak in a densely populated area [17] . The academic press reviewed for the study did not cover behavior change or the local ministry of health. Academic journal articles were highly focused on the need for developing a vaccine or novel therapeutic to curtail the outbreak. Many went as far as to claim that the outbreak would not be contained without such discoveries [34, 36, 64, 68, 85] . However, the outbreak was controlled by standard methods of public health and behavior change communication (BCC) that even caused some modifications of vaccine studies due to a lack of background infection rates [120] (WSJ 241, 249, 257; CBS 26; Yahoo!/ABC 13; CNN 5). Even Table 3 . Completeness and accuracy scores by media type. Aggregate scores for coverage of topics were collected for each media type based on individual media outlets (S1 Table) . Nations impacted in the 2013-2016 outbreak were not counted against those sources that pre-dated the outbreak. academic press published late in the outbreak's time course did not detail the impact that nonpharmaceutical interventions had in infection control, nor did they discuss the need for international coordination with the local Ministry of Health within the afflicted region. In fact, a smaller percentage of articles mentioned these non-pharmaceutical interventions after the outbreak than before. Qualitative themes differed between print media categories. Attempting to distill the themes of each written media portions to a single topic, the academic press prior to the 2013 outbreak focused on the virus. The academic press after the onset of the outbreak instead focused on the disease. Magazines instead focused on the individual providers, often interviewing them directly for quoted insights. Newspapers focused on containment, both the measures to limit spread within and between nations. Blog posts tended to focus on the toll, outlining the cases and fatality. When accurately discussing the outbreak, alternative sites focused on geopolitical topics such as the choice for President Obama's Ebola Czar. There were no significant associations between completeness and generalized measurements of article prestige. Impact factor is often considered to be the central measure of a journal's prestige and, by proxy, the quality of the articles contained within them. However, there was no significant association between impact factor with either completeness (Fig 2A) or error rate; the articles with impact factors greater than 10 were all error free, however this did not reach statistical significance (Fig 2B) . Similarly, the numbers of authors, number of citations, and whether the journal was open access also had no association with either completeness or error rate (Fig 2C-2G) . Only page numbers correlated with completeness (but not errors) for academic publications (Fig 2H and 2I ; p = 0.003, R 2 = 0.234). However, a low number of printed pages did not preclude complete or accurate articles. In fact, the most complete academic paper [1] (80.6%) had no errors, only one author, and needed only 8 pages (below the average of 8.6) due to use of informative tables. This suggests that stereotypical measures of an academic paper's status would not be a valid means for readers to pre-screen review articles for EVD. Academic journals had significantly more completeness and errors per article. As expected, academic review articles were more complete than lay press articles, as would be expected of review articles aimed at complete coverage of their designated topic. The mean academic publication covered 45.1% of the gleaned topics while magazines (11.4%), newspapers (7.1%), blogs (9.3%), and alternative sites (4.9%) lagged behind (Fig 3A) . However, Wikipedia revealed one of the top scores with 77.6% after the outbreak and scored a 56.2% before the outbreak. The academic journals were typically over 8 pages while lay press articles were often less than two. Therefore, adjusted for page length there was only slightly and non-significantly higher for academic press (7% of total topics covered per page) compared to Wikipedia (5.5%), magazines (4.7%), newspapers (6.8%), blogs (6.9%), and alternative sites (4.3%). The lower score for magazines was, in part, due to greater presence of large pictures. As a somewhat unexpected finding however was that academic journals carried a higher error rate than magazines, newspapers, and blogs, but not alternative media (Fig 3B) . Although there was one academic paper with 30 different erroneous statements [68] , if this outlier were excluded the difference with alternative media would become significant but it would not change the significance for other lay press sources. Of note, errors in newspaper writings were associated with anonymous authorship and being a letter to the editor or editorial. Completeness and errors between magazines, newspapers, blogs, and alternative sites. Magazines were significantly more complete than newspapers and alternative media (Fig 3A) . No differences in accuracy were seen between magazines, newspapers, or blog posts (Fig 3B) . Coupled with the indistinguishable numbers on completeness per page and errors, this may inform the debate between so called 'new' and 'old' media. Alternative media articles were significantly less complete than blogs and magazines, and contained significantly more erroneous statements than all other forms of media (Fig 3A and 3B) . Of note however, there were notable differences in the focus of the coverage between lay press media ( Table 3) . Magazines tended to more closely mirror academic journal subject focus, covering symptoms, risk factors, pathogenesis, and virology. Blogs were more likely to cover epidemiological data, but were the least likely to discuss means to preventing spread within the population.
