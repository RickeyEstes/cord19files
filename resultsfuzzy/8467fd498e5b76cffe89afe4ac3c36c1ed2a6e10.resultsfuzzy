Here we discuss implications of our results for arbitrage opportunities and portfolio diversification. We also discuss implications of our results for the Efficient Market Hypothesis. Our results suggest that spot and futures prices are governed by the same set of fundamentals, such as the exchange rate of the US dollar, macroeconomic variables and demand and supply Note: *and ** denotes statistical significance at 1% and 5% level, respectively. Note: *and ** denotes statistical significance at 1% and 5% level, respectively. conditions, which are similar and interrelated in North American and European markets for crude oil. As stated above, cointegration implies the existence of a long-run relationship between two or more non-stationary series. Therefore, it is related to arbitrage, which is a representation of a long-run steady-state equilibrium relationship in a particular market (Karbuz and Jumah, 1995, p. 237) . Arbitrage can be formally defined as any activity that would generate a riskless profit through substitutability between spot and futures markets (Schwartz and Szakmary, 1994) . If two markets are cointegrated, in the long-run arbitrage is the force that brings these markets together (Narayan and Smyth, 2005) . As oil spot and futures prices are cointegrated, the potential for making riskless excess profits on, say, the WTI spot market based on information from the Brent futures market is limited in the long-run. The fact that in some of our models, the break points were found to be statistically significant indicates that the equilibrium relationship between spot-spot, spot-futures and futures-futures pairs changed during the sample period. Therefore, the appropriate cointegration model between the oil price series should include a structural break. This finding can be related to the properties of the convenience yield and the risk premium on the oil market. Masih and Masih (2002) suggested that cointegration of commodity markets does not exist if there is either a non-stationary risk premium or a non-stationary convenience yield. Since we found all bivariate relationships to be cointegrated, this is an indication of a stationary risk premium or convenience yield. Our findings are of relevance to energy hedge funds, which tend to be long in the market (Fusaro and Vasey, 2004a) . In past years energy hedge funds as well as macro funds have been very active on the spot and futures markets contributing to greater intra-day activity. The recent tendency for these funds is to purchase physical and oil and gas reserves as well as assets across the energy value chain from downstream to upstream (Fusaro and Vasey, 2004b) , which will affect prices for these two commodities in the future. Interestingly enough, in the literature there has been little research on trading strategies based on cointegration. According to Alexander et al. (2002) , a great deal of trading is still done based on the correlation between assets, which is commonly used by market participants to select financial assets for portfolio diversification. In this sense, cointegration is superior to correlation analysis in terms of selection of assets for one's portfolio. This is because portfolios selected on the basis of correlation might hold in one period, but break down in the next (Wilson, et al., 2003) . If the researcher uses standard cointegration techniques when there is a structural break, this can be misleading since the cointegration vector has changed. In our analysis all of the series are cointegrated with a structural break, which means that the equilibrium relationship between spot and futures pairs changed at least once over the sample period. Therefore, the correct formulation of the cointegrating relationship of oil prices in the portfolio should include a structural break, otherwise it will be specified incorrectly. However, the existence of the cointegrating relationship does not mean that opportunities for portfolio diversification are endless.
