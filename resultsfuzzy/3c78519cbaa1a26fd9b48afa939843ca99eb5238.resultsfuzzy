Generally, the synthetic approaches reported for the aforementioned acyclic aza-analogues 1-3 ( Fig. 1 ) involved two key steps: (a) transformation of a nucleobase into the corresponding N-amino-or N-aminoalkyl derivative; and (b) alkylation (or acylation) of the resultant precursor at the exocyclic amino group with a specific synthon bearing a dialkylphosphoryl function, followed by deprotection of the intermediate phosphonate esters. 5 Our strategy for the synthesis of the target 2 0 -azanucleosides 8 is outlined in Scheme 1. Based on our previous experience in synthesizing 0968 nucleoside aza-analogues, 7 we decided to achieve compounds 8 via simultaneous introduction of the aza and dialkylphosphoryl function to the nucleobase in one reaction step, that is, by N-alkylation of the nucleobase with the phosphonylated N-(pivaloyloxymethyl)sulfonamide 7 under Vorbrüggen's conditions. Synthesis of N-(pivaloyloxymethyl)sulfonamide 7 from diethyl (2-mesyloxyethoxy)methylphosphonate 8 5 or diethyl hydroxymethylphosphonate 6 is shown in Scheme 2. Starting from diethyl (2-mesyloxyethoxy)methylphosphonate 5, the p-toluenesulfonylamino function of 7 was introduced by two methods [Scheme 2, conditions (i)-(iii) or (iv)]. The first one involved the following steps: (i) transformation of 5 into azide 9 using sodium azide at room temperature; 9 (ii) reduction of 9 to amine 10 under Staudinger's conditions; 9 and (iii) N-sulfonation of 10 with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride; the overall yield of 11 was 59%. The second method [conditions (iv)], that is, direct reaction of 5 with p-toluenesulfonamide in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate, afforded 11 in 68% yield. We also tried to prepare 11 by reaction of diethyl hydroxymethylphosphonate 6 with N-(p-toluenesulfonyl)aziridine 10 12 in the presence of sodium hydride [conditions (v) ]. However, this approach was not satisfactory; 11 was obtained in a low yield of 23%. In the next step [conditions (vi)], N-alkylation of 11 with chloromethyl pivalate in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate gave N-(pivaloyloxymethyl)sulfonamide 7 in a high yield of 96%. Reaction of 7 with the pyrimidine nucleobases (thymine, 5-fluorouracil or uracil) was performed according to the one-pot base silylation/nucleoside coupling procedure using N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (BSA) as the silylating agent and tin(IV) chloride as the Lewis acid [Scheme 3, conditions (i)]. The thymine derivative 13a and the 5-fluorouracil derivative 13b were obtained as the only products in a yield of 83% and 55%, respectively. The only exception was the reaction of 7 with uracil; the desired azanucleoside 13c (the major product, 73%) and 1,3disubstituted uracil 14 (7%) were obtained. The minor product 14 was readily separated by column chromatography. Coupling of 7 with N 4 -benzoylcytosine under the same conditions, followed by treatment of the crude product (not shown) with ammonium hydroxide gave the cytosine derivative 13d in 80% yield [Scheme 3, conditions (ii) ]. The N-1 substitution pattern of the aza analogues 13 was confirmed by the interactions observed in the 2D NMR spectra of 13a and 13b (Fig. 2 ). In the 1 H-1 H ROESY spectrum of 13a, the 1 H-1 H interaction between H-6 of thymine and the H-1 0 protons was seen. In the 1 H-13 C HMBC spectrum of 13b, in turn, the 1 H-13 C couplings of the H-1 0 protons with both C-6 and C-2 of 5fluorouracil, as well as the coupling between H-6 and C-1 0 were observed. The final step [Scheme 3, conditions (iii)], dealkylation of 13 with bromotrimethylsilane (TMSBr) followed by treatment of the reaction mixture with a water/acetone mixture, afforded the desired phosphonic acids 8 in 63-82% yield. Structure and purity of derivatives 8a-c was verified by standard NMR and IR techniques as well as by elemental analysis. In contrast to 8a-c, solubility of the cytosine derivative 8d in water (5 mg/ca. 100 ml of water) and in conventional organic solvents, including dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide, was very low. For this reason, only IR spectrum and elemental analysis was performed for 8d. Therefore, in an attempt to transform 8d into the corresponding sodium salt, a suspension of 8d in a water/DMSO mixture was shaken with DOWEX Ò 88 ion-exchange resin (Na-form). Contrary to our expectation that 8d would gradually dissolve upon the treatment with the ion-exchange resin, the suspension (which was then identified by elemental analysis as the unchanged 8d) was still observed. Therefore, the time of shaking was prolonged for six months. Nevertheless, the conversion of 8d to its sodium salt was not satisfactory. Filtration of the unchanged 8d and evaporation of the solvents from the filtrate afforded a small amount of a solid (8ds, 15 mg from 50 mg of 8d) which was identified by elemental analysis as an equimolar mixture of 8d and its monosodium salt (not shown). The 1 H NMR spectrum of the mixture allowed us to confirm the structure of 8d. Unfortunately, solubility of 8d-s in DMSO or in water was too low to measure the 13 C NMR spectrum.
