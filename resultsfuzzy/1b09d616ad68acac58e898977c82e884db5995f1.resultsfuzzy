The S protein is one of the major antigenic proteins in SARS structural proteins The extracted proteins from Vero-E6 cells infected by the SARS-CoV were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide), transblotted onto a PVDF (Polyvinylidene Fluoride) membrane and immunorecognized by antibodies in the sera from SARS patients. As shown in Figure 1 , the cell extracts were analyzed by Western blot using three SARS sera. Although individual patient sera display different immunoreactivities against the same infected cell lysate, the major immunostaining bands are located around two regions (Figure 1 ), 50 kDa and 120-240 kDa. Be- cause the molecular weight (MW) of the N protein is 46 kDa, the protein band near to 50 kDa is reasoned to be the N protein. The N protein bands examined in this study have shown a constant expression; nevertheless, the immunostained bands around 120-240 kDa do not display a constant pattern. These bands are likely to be the S protein because the masses of these protein bands are over 120 kDa. Spike proteins have been reported to have multiple glycosyla-tion sites (14 ) . Therefore, it is not surprising that the SARS-CoV S proteins may show apparently different molecular weights due to variable extents in glycosylated modifications during infection. To confirm the bands around 120-240 kDa, these bands were excised and completely digested by trypsin. The tryptic frag-ments were analyzed by mass spectrometry to identify the composition of peptides ( Figure 2 ). The results from searching the peptide demonstrated that the S proteins are the major components in these gel bands. The sequence coverage based on the data of matched peptides is 72.2% for the S protein. Serological studies on coronaviruses have shown the existence of at least three antigenic groups within the family. For instance, the human coronavirus (HCV)-229E and the canine coronavirus (CCV) belong to Group I, MHV to Group II and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) to Group III (15 ) . Viruses within each subgroup have partial antigenic crossreactivity based on the S proteins (16 ) . Koch et al. analyzed the antigenic structure of the S protein from IBV, in which six antigenic sites were located at S1 and two were at S2 (17 ) . Since the S1 protein is responsible for the attachment to cellular host membranes, it is not surprising that this protein is stronger in antigenicity than the S2 protein. Therefore, in many coronaviruses, the S1 protein has been confirmed to correlate with serotype (18 ) . Identification of antigenic sites on the S1 protein has shown its significance for virus detection and classification (18 ) . In our Western blot experiment, the SARS-CoV S protein was also found to be a major antigenic protein. Does the SARS-CoV S protein have any homology to other coronavirus S proteins in the antigenic structure? Does the antigenic site on the SARS-CoV S protein appear biological significance during SARS infection? To address these questions, we extended our studies to search for the antigenic site(s) of this protein.
