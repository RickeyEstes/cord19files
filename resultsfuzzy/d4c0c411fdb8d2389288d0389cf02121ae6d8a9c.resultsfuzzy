Sequence analysis of the HEPN superfamily and identification numerous novel families Transitive, iterative sequence profile searches and hidden Markov model (HMM) searches with the originally defined HEPN domains [41, 42] used as the queries using PSI-BLAST and HMM-SEARCH3 programs recovered an extended set of homologous domains. These included two families of so-called "domains of unknown function" from the Pfam database, namely DUF4145 and DUF86 all of which, along with models for the C-terminal domains of several polymerase Î²-superfamily proteins (Pfam models: GlnD_UR_UTase, NTase_sub_bind and DUF294_C), are currently included in the Pfam clan named CL0291. Of these, DUF86 includes proteins, most of which were originally reported as being encoded by genes adjacent to those for MNTs [41, 42] . However, several representatives of DUF4145 are fused to restriction endonuclease (REase) and superfamily-II helicase modules, indicating that HEPN domains also commonly occur independently of MNTs. These iterative searches also recovered several borderline hits (e-values~0.05-.2) which shared a conserved motif with the known HEPN domains (Figure 1 , see below), suggesting that additional, divergent HEPN domains were likely to exist that might be difficult to detect using the standard iterative search strategies alone. Hence, we resorted to a two-pronged search strategy. First, we seeded PSI-BLAST and HMM searches with all the borderline hits that shared the conserved motif with the HEPN domain and constructed an alignment of the corresponding regions of the sequences that yielded significant hits in these searches. These alignments then were used to initiate profile-profile searches with the HHpred program against a library of profiles based on Pfam, Interpro and those prepared using sequences from the PDB structural database [44] . Second, we initiated HHpred searches using profiles of known HEPN domains (i.e. the models from the HEPN clan of the Pfam database augmented by the new members recovered in our searches) against the same library of profiles as in the first approach. We then selected all query alignments that recovered a known HEPN profile as the best hit as candidate novel HEPN domains. Each of these candidates was analyzed using secondary structure prediction, with the JPRED program, examination of conserved motifs, transitive recovery of known HEPN domains in profile and HMM searches, and additional profile-profile searches to test their membership in the HEPN superfamily (see Methods for details). The search strategy outlined above identified numerous families of domains (typically with probability of profile match in HHpred of 75-98%; Table 1 and Additional file 1) as being new versions of the HEPN domain. Strikingly, we observed that several of these newly recognized families correspond to the catalytic domains of RNases that have been previously biochemically characterized. These include the mRNA cleaving RNase LS family implicated in the defense against enterobacteriophage T4 [48, 49] , the tRNA anti-codon loop-cleaving RNase domains of RloC [50] and PrrC [51] also involved in the restriction of T4 [52] , and the kinase-extension nuclease (KEN) domain of RNase L which is involved in specialized splicing reactions and interferon-induced antiviral response in vertebrates [53, 54] . Consistent with these results, we also detected a novel version of HEPN domain in the pan-eukaryotic Las1 proteins involved in the cleavage and processing of the ITS2 linker RNA which separates the 5.8S and 25S/28S rRNAs in their common precursor [55] . The eukaryotic Swt1 proteins, which are involved in the degradation of pre-mRNA at the nuclear pore to prevent their exit to the cytoplasm [56] , also displayed a previously unknown version of HEPN domain. Many of the newly detected HEPN families showed additional connections to antiviral defense functions. Most notably, 6 families of domains, respectively typified by the AbiD, AbiF, AbiJ, AbiU2, AbiV and the Cterminal domain of AbiA, which are products of the (Table 1) . We also identified novel versions of the HEPN domain that comprised the Cterminal modules in a large group of COG1517-related proteins (including Csx1 and Csm6 subfamilies), which are encoded by genes found in a subset of the CRISPR-Cas loci (Table 1) [4, 57] . These findings suggested previously unappreciated roles of HEPN domains in RNA-processing, both in defense and in cellular RNA maturation. Importantly, these observations raised the possibility that at least a subset of HEPN domains might function as RNases with diverse target specificities. Beyond the above noted families, our analysis recovered at least 38 distinct families of domains that belong to the HEPN superfamily several of which can be further grouped together into higher order assemblages based on preferential recovery in profile or profile-profile searches (Table 1 and Additional file 1). These include functionally enigmatic families such as the MtlR family of regulatory proteins typified by the Escherichia coli mannitol operon regulators [58] . Other new HEPN domain families are labeled as "domains of unknown function" in the PFAM database, namely DUF3644, DUF4209, DUF2526, Ymh. Other domain families identified for the first time in this work were previously completely uncharacterized ( Figure 1 , Table 1 ). To better understand the biochemistry and biological roles of the HEPN domain we systematically analyzed the sequence features, potential active sites, structural variations and contextual connections of the HEPN superfamily proteins.
