We validated the method as described herein and successfully used it to quantify five constituents of YPFS in plasma samples after oral administration of YPFS decoction at three doses. YPFS was well-tolerated by all subjects with no apparent dose or time dependent toxic effects. The pharmacokinetic parameters terminal half-life (HL lz ), maximum concentration in plasma (C max ), and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from dosing time extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-N ) showed a trend of dose-dependence towards the detected constituents cycloastragenol, calycosin, GMV and cimifugin in YPFS, based on the doses administered orally (10, 20 and 40 g/kg; Fig. 4 , Table 5 ). Formononetin, calycosin, and GMV were rapidly absorbed, achieving C max in less than 30 min. Cycloastragenol was detected after 0.5 h in plasma and with time to C max (i.e., T max ) at around 12 h, a long mean residence time (MRT) of 17 h. We speculated that the astragalosides were hydrolyzed to cycloastragenol in the intestine or stomach, and then cycloastragenol was absorbed into the circulation. An unknown peak (17.2 min) was found in the same selected ion monitoring (513) channel one minute after the cycloastragenol position. It displayed similar pharmacokinetic behaviors as cycloastragenol. This unknown peak will be identified in a further study. Cimifugin showed multiple absorption peaks, and among all the detected constituents the concentration in plasma was particularly high (Fig. 4) . This might be because the YPFS contained free cimifugin as well as its precursor. Since these constituents, especially cycloastragenol and cimifugin, showed some dose-dependence in the pharmacokinetic profiles, these results provide helpful understanding of the therapeutic process of YPFS; however, it showed no obvious dose-dependence for formononetin over the approved dosage range, administration of a larger range of doses warrants further study. Previously it was shown that astragalosides from Radix Astragali have low permeability in vitro and poor bioavailability in vivo (Gu et al., 2004; Wen et al., 2008) . However, its aglycone cycloastragenol can be absorbed through intestinal epithelium efficiently . This is similar to prim-O-glucosylcimifugin, 4 0 -O-b-glucopyranosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol, and their aglycone cimifugin Xue et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2011) . It has been reported that changes in telomere lengths are relevant to immune function (Weng, 2012) , and cycloastragenol upregulates telomerase activity (Fauce et al., 2008; RÃ­os, 2010; Yung et al., 2012) . Furthermore, cimifugin inhibits nitric oxide production and contributes to the analgesic efficacy of Radix Saposhnikoviae (Okuyama et al., 2001; Wang et al., 1999) . Taken together, cycloastragenol and cimifugin have demonstrated good pharmacokinetic behavior in vivo. Therefore, cycloastragenol and cimifugin may be related to the effect of YPFS in diseases of the respiratory and immune systems. Moreover, these two metabolites may be valuable as immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory agents. However, further study is required to confirm the association between cycloastragenol, cimifugin, and YPFS and pharmacological effect, as such bioactive metabolites could be potential drugs.
