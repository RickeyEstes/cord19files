Given the biological importance of the PI3K/Akt pathway in viral infection, we initially investigated whether MPC/04 infection activates this pathway. In contrast to mock-treated cells (Fig. 1C) , MPC/04 infection rapidly increased Akt phosphorylation within 5-15 min post-infection (p.i.), which was followed by a decline in Akt phosphorylation 30 min p.i., with a return to background levels by 6 h p.i. (Fig. 1A) . To demonstrate that Akt phosphorylation depended on viral infection, the UV-inactivated virus was prepared and verified with a plaque assay. The result showed that inactivated virus did not lose the ability to activate p-Akt (Fig. 1B) . To determine whether Akt phosphorylation was PI3K-dependent, the role of PI3K in Akt phosphorylation following reovirus infection was investigated using the specific PI3K inhibitors LY and Wort or siRNA targeting the PI3K p85a subunit. As expected, pre-treatment with LY (50 lM) (Fig. 1D) or Wort (0.1 lM) (Fig. 1D ) completely inhibited Akt phosphorylation. MPC/04 infection did not increase the levels of p-Akt in cells transfected with siRNA targeting the PI3K p85a subunit (Fig. 1F) .
