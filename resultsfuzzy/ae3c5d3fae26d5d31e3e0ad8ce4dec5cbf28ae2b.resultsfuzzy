The ADG during the 1st mo of life was 374 g (95% CI, 357 to 391 g), during the 2nd mo, 596 g (95% CI, 575 to 617 g), and during the 3rd mo, 719 g (95% CI, 692 to 747 g). Mean BW a t the first visit was 42 kg (95% CI, 41.6 to 42.4 kg) and a t the last visit at about 3 mo of age was 93 kg (95% CI, 91.6 to 94.4 kg). The ADG during the whole 3-mo period was 565 g (95% CI, 552 to 578 g). The mean monthly ADG and mean total BW gain of the calves according to the presence or absence of diseases or FPT are presented in Table 1 . Although the absolute ADG was not our focus and although this kind of simple comparison may often be misleading, this table is provided to give a general idea of possible disease effects and also as a description of the ADG that were experienced by these calves. The calves gained a mean 5 cm in height monthly (95% CI, 4.9 to 5.1 cm). Height gain was 4.4 cm (95% CI, 4.1 to 4.6 cm) during the 1st mo, 5.6 cm (95% CI, 5.4 to 5.9 cm) during the 2nd mo, and 5.7 cm (95% CI, 5.4 to 5.9 cm) during the 3rd mo. Calf height at first visit was a mean 75 cm (95% CI, 74.7 to 75.3 cm), and height a t the last visit was 90.9 cm (95% CI, 90.6 to 91.4 cm).
