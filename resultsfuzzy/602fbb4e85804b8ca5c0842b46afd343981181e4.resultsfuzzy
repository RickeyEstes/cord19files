After an overall quality review, mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads, and then the cDNA library was constructed, with quality assessment. After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq platform and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. The sequence run of each sample yielded at least 42 million clean reads and the lowest value of the reads possessing a Q-score > 20 was 95%, and the bottom line of the reads with a Q-score > 30 was 88% (Table 1) . These results meet the requirements that more than 10 million reads are needed to construct a high quality eukaryotic transcriptome for discovering new genes and transcripts [45] . Importantly, all samples had between 71.81% and 77.45% of total reads mapped to the chicken reference genome, and the percentage of uniquely mapped reads was between 70.75% and 76.26% (Table 1) . Then, the mapped data were used to predict the novel transcripts and analyze the five major types of AS events, including SE (skipped exon), A5SS (alternative 5′ splice site), A3SS (alternative 3′ splice site), MXE (mutually exclusive exon), and RI (retained intron). The predicted novel genes were further analyzed together with the known genes. No significantly changed AS events were found between each group. The mapped data was normalized by calculating the FPKM and the distribution of mean FPKM per gene was found to be uniform between the four conditions (Fig. 2a) . The correlation of gene expression levels between all of the samples was investigated using the squared Pearson correlation coefficient (R 2 ), and the minimum value was 0.979 (Fig. 2b) . These results indicate that the expression levels of different genes or groups of genes are comparable, suggesting that the treatment is repeatable and has little variation. Therefore, the accuracy of the subsequent analysis of differentially expressed genes is likely to be high. Because the transcripts of the ARV genome do not have a poly-A 3′ tail [8] , there are no reads can be used to indicate the replication of ARV.
