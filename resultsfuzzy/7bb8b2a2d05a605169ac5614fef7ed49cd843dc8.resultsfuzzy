In June 2005 eleven 2-3-month-old puppies were imported to Italy from an East European country for commercial purposes. In the country of origin, the puppies underwent antibiotic (spyramicin for 8 days), antihelminthic (levamisole) and multi-vitamin treatment. Few days after the end of the quarantine period they started to show depression, decreased feed consumption and diarrhoea. A viral enteritis was suspected and samples were collected singularly and submitted for laboratory exam-inations. All puppies recovered spontaneously after 5-7 days of illness. Four (ID nos. 3, 6, 8 and 11) out of 11 samples collected and analysed by EM revealed the presence of astroviruslike particles. In one sample, parvovirus-like particles were also observed (Table 1) . Astrovirus-like particles appeared as small round, non-enveloped viruses of 27-30 nm in diameter with distinctive features due to small surface projections with a five to six point star-like appearance. Aggregation of viral particles was a common finding in the samples examined. The difference in size (27-30 nm vs. 18-20 nm) permitted to easily discriminate between astrovirus and parvovirus (Fig. 1) . In 6/7 of the remaining samples, no virus particles were revealed by EM. In one sample, parvovirus-like and coronavirus-like particles were detected. Astrovirus-positive samples by EM were submitted for virus isolation. Growth of astrovirus-like particles was not detected by EM in the cell cultures used in this study. In one sample (no. 8) rotavirus was isolated and identified by EM after two passages in cell cultures displaying CPE (Table 1) . Bacteriological cultures were not conclusive and analysis yielded negative results specifically for Salmonella spp., Yersinia spp. and Campylobacter spp. Parasitological examination revealed infestation by Toxocara canis in sample no. 11.
