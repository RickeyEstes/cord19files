A total of 1,021 NP microbiome profiles were obtained from 234 infants using 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing (Materials and Methods). These included 487 "healthy" NP samples collected in the absence of respiratory symptoms, and 534 "infection" NP samples collected during episodes of acute respiratory illness (ARI) during the first year of life. Three quarters of the infants (N=177) contributed at least two healthy NP samples at the age of ~2 months, ~6 months and/or ~12 months. Eighty percent of the infants (N=186) contributed a healthy sample before experiencing their first ARI. The 534 infection NP samples were from 184 infants who had experienced â‰¥1 ARI within the first year of life. NP samples were analysed from all (380/381) recorded LRI in this period, and a random selection of 20% breastfeeding on NP colonization at 2 months of age; the latter was unsurprising as nearly all infants (90%) were breastfed for at least 2 months. The abundance of Streptococcus in healthy NP samples was significantly lower amongst children whose parents reported having furry pets such as dogs or cats in the home (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70-1.0, p=0.046; adjusted for age at NP sampling). No other significant associations were detected for pets. Children attending day-care had significantly higher relative abundances of Haemophilus and Moraxella, and lower relative abundances of Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus ( Fig. 2A) , in both healthy and infection samples (note that very few children had commenced day-care by 6 months of age, hence the impact of day-care attendance was assessed at the 12-month time point only). Co-habiting with siblings was also associated with higher abundances of Haemophilus, Streptococcus and Moraxella, and lower abundance of Staphylococcus, during health and ARI (adjusted for age at sampling, Fig. 2B) . Importantly, amongst healthy samples, antibiotic usage in the four weeks prior to sampling was associated with higher abundances of Haemophilus, Streptococcus and Moraxella, and lower abundances of Alloiococcus and Corynebacterium (adjusted for age at sampling, Fig.  2C ). The composition of the healthy NP microbiome was also affected by the number of prior respiratory infections experienced, with higher abundance of Moraxella and lower abundances of Alloiococcus or Corynebacterium in samples following increasing numbers of ARIs ( Fig. S9) . At the MPG level, ARIs dominated by Haemophilus increased in spring-summer, while those dominated by Moraxella peaked in autumn-winter (Fig. S10) . We therefore tested for differences in relative abundance in autumn-winter and spring-summer, adjusting for age and number of prior infections; this confirmed significant seasonal effects on the abundance of Haemophilus (summer associated) and Moraxella (winter associated) amongst ARI samples, and a similar but non-significant trend amongst healthy NP samples (Fig.  2D) .
