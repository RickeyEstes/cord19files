Fifteen classification models were tested with the aim of finding the best GDA equation which is able to discriminate between proteins related with HBC and HCC. The attributes include 30 embedded/non-embedded star graph TIs obtained with S2SNet application and other 60 composed predictors, pTIs and dTIs. The values obtained for the training/predicting accuracies with the forward stepwise method are presented in Table 2 . The forward stepwise selection variable method conjugated with the embedded TIs and dTIs provides the best results for our data set with values of correctly classified compounds of 89.9%, 90.3% and 90.0% for the training, CV and full sets, respectively, and using only six/five parameters/variables (Eq. (14)). The embedded TIs have the name of the non-embedded ones plus ''e'' as suffix. The simple linear mathematical form of the model has been chosen in the absence of prior information. C=nC2score ¼ À 4:4 þ 1:7 Ã tr 3e þ 124:8 Ã Se À 126:5 Ã dJe þ 48:6 Ã dX2e À 45:9 Ã X5e (14) where N is the number of cases (C and nC), R c is the canonical regression coefficient, U is the Wilk's statistics, F is the Fisher's statistics and p is the p-level (probability of error). The above results are typically considered as excellent in the literature for LDA-QPDR/QSAR models (Castillo-Garit et al., 2008; Estrada and Molina, 2001; Marrero-Ponce et al., 2004; Morales et al., 2006; Vilar et al., 2008) . In order to check the variation of this model with the training/CV sets, we carried on a CV study by using ten totally random sets, including the initial one from the actual model (with the same 75% training and 25% CV). The classification values are presented in Table S1 from the supple-mentary material and show an average of 90.2% for training and 89.2% for CV. These values demonstrate the stability of the model with the selection of the classification sets. In order to illustrate the performance of the approach when applied to a single set of cancer related proteins (e.g. either breast or colon), we obtained two equations, one for HBC and other for HCC. Therefore, we have to consider that the Eq. (14) represents an input-coded multi-target classification model that can evaluate if a protein is HBC or HCC-related by using the HBC or HCC average Je and X2e values (contained in the dJe and dX2e differences). Eq. (14) can be reduced to two different equations, one for each type of cancer (HBC and HCC): HCC=nHCC2score ¼ À 20:8 þ 1:7 Ã tr 3e þ 124:8 Ã Se2Je þ 0:2 Ã X2e À 45:9 Ã X5e. The detailed classification results for each type of cancer obtained with Eqs. (14a), (14b) are presented in Table 3 . A similar input-coded multi-target classification model was obtained by using the forward stepwise method and the embedded pTIs and provides values of correctly classified compounds of 90.3, 91.0 and 90.5 for the training, CV and full sets, respectively (using seven/six parameters/variables) (Eq. (15)). C=nC2score ¼ À 4:1 À 118:6 Ã p tr 0e þ 80:7 Ã p tr 2e þ 1:4 Ã p tr 3e þ 100:3 Ã pSe À 101:4 Ã pJe þ 39:7 Ã pX2e, In order to evaluate if a protein is HBC or HCC-related, it is necessary to use the HBC or HCC probability inside the pTIs products. The classification values obtained for the individual equations are presented in Table 3 . The equations obtained are the following: HBC=nHBC2score ¼ À 5:6 À 0:3 Ã tr 0e þ 0:8 Ã tr 2e þ 0:6 Ã tr 3e þ 0:2 Ã X2e (15a) Table 1 Single amino acid mutations and the corresponding log-odd PAM250 value..
