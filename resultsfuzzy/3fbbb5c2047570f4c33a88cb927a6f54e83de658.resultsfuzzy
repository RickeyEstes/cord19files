It is informative and useful to run a simulation experiment on the computer to see how the real-world matches with the theory developed above. For this purpose, one can use a random number generator and a computer program to simulate the universe of the digital array chambers. If a panel has C chambers, consider a universe of C6K many chambers where K is a large number chosen for simulation. Choose some value of l as the true concentration of molecules in one chamber. Therefore, in total, there will be l6C6K molecules. Assign each of these molecules randomly to one of the chambers. Extract K panels out of this universe and for each of the panels, computep p~H C as an estimator of p and plot its histogram over all the K panels. The mean should be p = 12e 2l and standard deviation should be ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi . For each of these panels, estimate l and compute the 95% confidence interval. In 95% of the K panels, the true value of l should lie within the confidence interval. For our simulation experiments we chose M = 400, that is, l~4 00 765 . We chose K = 70000. In Figure 5 we show the histogram of H which is really same as distribution of P scaled by a factor of 765. In Table 1 we show how the predicted values match with the actual simulation values. In the same way, the sampling distribution of number of molecules matched with what is predicted by theory. Though the results of the simulation follow from elementary probability, we conducted these simulations in order to build more advanced simulations for ratios of concentrations later. They also illustrate the meaning of the confidence interval. We conducted simulation studies, using a random number generator and a computer program as in previous section, by choosing a ratio of 2 of concentrations of two genes, which are independent of each other, and building a distribution of estimated ratios over 50 thousand panels. In 94.9% of the panels, the true chosen ratio did lie in the computed confidence intervals thereby showing the correctness of our mathematical analysis. The copy number variation results for known ratios of 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 and 3.5 are shown in Figure 8 . Materials and methods for this experiment are discussed in next section. As the number of panels P increases, then the number of chambers C = 765 Pincreases and therefore the estimation of the ratio becomes more accurate as well as the confidence interval shrinks. When only 1 panel is used, there is significant overlap between 95% confidence intervals of certain ratios e.g. between ratio 2 and 2.5. There is no overlap when 3 or more panels are used. In all cases the known ratio lies within the computed 95% confidence interval. Note that using mathematical analysis one can find optimal numbers of positive chambers for each ratio which give smallest confidence intervals and which will therefore improve the results. In summary, Fluidigm's digital array is capable of accurately quantitating DNA samples and is a valuable platform for studying copy number variation. It is a robust technology that is sequencespecific, easy-to-use, and extremely flexible. We have presented mathematical and algorithmic solutions to analyze CNV on a digital array. The solution is an elegant application of statistical sampling and estimation theories to such an important real-world Table 2 . Given number of chambers C and counts H 1 and H 2 of the positive chambers in a digital array for the target gene and the reference gene, respectively, list of formulas needed to analyze copy number variation. problem. We have shown how one can compute the true concentration of a target sequence in a DNA sample and the associated confidence interval on this estimation, and how one can compute the ratio of true concentrations of multiple sequences and the associated confidence interval on the estimation of this ratio.
