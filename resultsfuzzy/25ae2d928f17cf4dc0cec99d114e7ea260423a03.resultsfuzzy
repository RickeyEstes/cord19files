To investigate the dynamical behavior of stochastic model (1.4) , the first concerning thing is whether the solution is global and positive. In this section we provide numerical simulation results to substantiate the analytical findings for the stochastic model reported in the previous sections. Using the Milsteins Higher Order Method mentioned in Higham [60] , we obtain the following discretization equations , Table 5 .1 for details). In addition, we always assume that the initial value of system (1.4) is (S 0 , I 0 , R 0 , r(0)) = (50, 1 , 0, 1) ∈ × S . We then divide our simulations into two cases: Fig. 5 .2 , for first two cases(i.e., R s 0 > 1 ), both appear skew to the right and the skewness becomes larger as the intensities σ (1), σ (2) of the white noise increases; in the last case ( R s 0 < 1 ), the PDF of the distribution of I ( t ) is concentrated on the small neighborhood of zero. Here we can conclude that the small environmental perturbations can generate the irregular cycling phenomena of recurrent diseases, while the large ones will eradicate diseases. This means the small perturbations of the white noise can sustain the irregular recurrence of the disease (such as influenza, SARS) in humans between two pandemics, and larger ones may be beneficial, leading to the extinction of the disease. In order to further illustrate the effect of the random switching on the transmission dynamics of the disease, we carry out another case. In Fig. 5 .3 represent the sample paths of I of state 1, state 2 and hybrid system. It is clear that the path of hybrid system is between the paths of state 1 and state 2, that is, the hybrid system is stochastically permanent if the two subsystems are stochastically
