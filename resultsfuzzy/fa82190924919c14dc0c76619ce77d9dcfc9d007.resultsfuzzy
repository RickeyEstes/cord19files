The five PPE ensembles were tested by staff a total of 37 times. A contamination event was defined as the presence of fluorescent tracer on the skin or PPE in a single 'body-map' area (e.g. forearm, hand, neck, and face), which was individually assessed for all four bodily fluids. Multiple contamination events were seen on all volunteers immediately after the exercise. Participants were instructed through the process of doffing by a PPE trainer to prevent deviation from guidelines. After doffing, fluorescence could still be observed in twelve body-map areas, affecting the face, neck, forearm and lower legs. A root cause analysis (RCA) was performed for each event; recorded contemporaneous observations, film footage and photographs were retrospectively reviewed by the same three researchers to determine the mechanisms of contamination. Breaches were identified as being related either to protocol failure, such as contamination of exposed skin, or complications in PPE doffing such as when removing boot covers. Results of this study are fully described elsewhere. 9 Results from the first testing phase were presented by the VIO-LET research group to the High Consequence Infectious Diseases Project Working Group, brought together at a full day meeting. This group comprised twelve NHS doctors and ten nurses from the Ebola surge capacity centres and those with experience in caring for confirmed VHF cases, with representation from Infectious Diseases, Microbiology, Virology and Infection Prevention and Control. Six representatives from HSE's laboratory including members of the project delivery team and PPE experts provided safety and technical expertise. In order to ensure oversight from a body independent of the NHS, two HSE specialist microbiologists contributed to the process, and the meetings were chaired by the Deputy Head of PHE's Emergency Response Department. As well as the test results and RCA findings, the expert group heard qualitative judgments gathered from participant feedback about ease of PPE use and comfort, both of which were considered important safety factors to improve users' compliance with protocols. In addition, the aim was for items selected to be available within the NHS supply chain, to allow access to all UK users, since bulk-buying of non-core items such as coverall suits resulted in procurement issues during the EVD outbreak. Ideally, items should not need modification, also donning and doffing protocols were to be developed to reduce user variability. All items apart from a hood were already available in the NHS supply chain. No hood currently in use fulfilled all necessary requirements: to be water repellent, covering the head and neck, easy to remove and not to compromise the function of the wearer's FFP3 respirator mask. Consequently, working with a bespoke PPE designer/manufacturer (KIT Design, Sheffield), a hood to fulfil the above requirements was developed using standard water-repellent surgical gown material. Reinforced gown material was not used as the head area had a low contamination rate in first phase testing. 9 Additionally, the thinner standard fabric would be cooler to wear, improving comfort. Taking all the information together, the expert group proposed a unified, consensus PPE ensemble to undergo testing: the 'HCID assessment PPE'.
