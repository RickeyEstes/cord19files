The maximum likelihood composite trees generated are shown at Figure 1 . The incongruent topology is evidenced by different branch sorting between phylogenetic trees of Tollip complete and G blocks trees, and between the current phylogenetic organization available at ToL. The most appropriate model for explaining the evolution of Tollip was found to be mtREV24 [60, 61] with following the parameters: BIC of 5424.48, AICc of 5006.19, lnL of -2432.61, Invariant sites n/a, and Gamma parameters of n/a. The groups were split based on the Tollip protein sequence, confirming the evolutionary relatedness constructed in the ToL project. Despite this, a new phylogenetic array suggests other relationships between protein sequences of these animals. In Figure 1B , notice a node formed by subgroups 13 to 17, which include porifera (subgroup 17) and cnidaria (subgroup 16), together with bilateria, subgroups 13 to 15. The other branch is composed just by vertebrata, group I, which remains like a monophyletic group in all the trees, confirmed by bootstrap values in Figures 1B and 1C , respectively 81% and 89%. The separated groups, based in the Tollip sequence reinforces the evolutionary relatedness constructed in the ToL project. Although, other relationships between the vertebrates are suggested. Indeed, the group I suggests a characteristic function of the protein in order of higher levels of organisms complexity, requiring a less stable molecule for the modulation of information which will be discussed later. In the group I, the primates (subgroup 1) are in two arranges, in Figure 1B the ptr and ggo (bootstrap value of 100%) are far the other primates (bootstrap value of 94%) suggesting one difference in complete sequence, the non conserved sites difference ptr and ggo from the others. The conserved sites separated the two primates too, Figure 1C , the two sequences hold similarities between them in this molecular level. In Figure 1C , there are two branches, one of them is formed by groups I to V and the other just by group III, except for subgroup 14. This configuration is due to the alignment of conserved sites in the sequences, showing the variability of Tollip sequences between different organisms. When the Tollip complete sequence was analyzed ( Figure 1B) , this configuration changed. The group III remains like a monophyletic group, the alignment of non conserved parts does not change significantly the branch, subgroup 14 returns to the group III and the subgroup 15 becomes paraphyletic relatively to group III. This allows us to consider group III as close enough to be relatively consistent throughout the entire analysis. The average length of Tollip was 262 amino acids with a standard deviation of 64 amino acids; and the molecular weight average was 31.33 kDa with a standard deviation of 6.78 kDa. Through splits decomposition and analysis of alignment, after block curing, we could estimate the proportion of invariant sites as 68.54% and the segregant sites counted was 77 in amino acid base. These findings suggest a tendency of recurrent duplications and/ or insertions, as well as deletions evidenced by variations in the length and mass of protein ranging between approximately 25% and 4.62 fold, respectively. But it is important to stress that the protein activity seems be intact or just slightly reduced, once its activity is essential to keep the health in animals. Tollip participates in several immune pathways, mediated or not by Myd88 [18, 19] , modulating the responses and the loss or reduction of its affinity to molecular complexes made between it and several other compounds, like IRAK-1 [20] [21] [22] [23] , could trigger an exaggerated response of the immune system, leading to death in some cases. Though, there are studies, like Didierlaurent's [62] , which affirm that mice lacking Tollip become healthy and fertile. Despite all identified polymorphisms and mutations of Tollip, we could not make any inferences about its role in the TLRtriggering activation of dendritic cells, without more in vitro and in vivo tests. Although, some studies [22, 62] have revealed that Tollip does not have a fundamental function in the TLRtriggering activation pathway of dendritic cells. Mutant mice lacking the tollip gene, when compared with wild-type mice, have been shown to not have significant differences. Therefore, mutations in key-residues for Tollip activity does not imply differences at the activation level of dendritic cells. The characteristics of proteins were evaluated (Table 1 ) and the distribution of instability index (ININ), aliphatic index (AI) and GRAVY followed the normal distribution (P Kolmogorov Smirnov test .0.05). The molecular weight showed a statically significant correlation coefficient with aliphatic index (p = 0.014; r = 20.4065); another characters showed correlations between the aliphatic index and the instability index (p,0.001; r = 20.5829), and between GRAVY and the aliphatic index (p,,0.001; r = 0.6714). These data are shown in Table 2 . The protein variability (Figure 2 ), was measured by the Shannon coefficient. We observed the Tollip G-block cured proteins, and the regions that have continuous conserved residues are probably responsible for the catalytic reactions or binding interactions. The variability of sequence lengths implies a complex organization of Tollip function or adjustment in diverse immune pathways. The standard deviation of the number of residues in a protein probably reflects a process of tertiary structure "stabilization", evidenced by increasing AI values, which were positively correlated (r = 0.366; p = 0.14) with arthropod group. Higher molecular weights showed higher hydrophobicity by AI (p = 20.407; r = 0.007) and GRAVY results showed similar findings, being correlated with AI too (r = 0.671; p = 3.7610 26 ). These aliphatic residues seem to be essential to the evolving process of this protein. The ININ revealed by itself a tendency of accumulation of instabilities in all groups except the arthropods, once a positive correlation of these values was shown between primates group (r = 0.515, p = 0.001) and another negative was shown between arthropods and ININ (r = 20.413; p = 0.006). These tendencies are related with a hydrophobization of the entire molecule, which increase the molecule lifetime, being advantageous for their group due to rapid molecular ratio and molecular turnover [63] [64] [65] . Primates revealed just a tendency to increase instability of protein (ININ; r = 0.515, p = 0.001); this is related to lower half-life in this protein. It is in agreement with the higher available energy in these animals, in opposite that observed in arthropods or small animals. The cell environment of superior chordata can be very unstable which enables physiological reactions, with rapid and efficient beginnings and ends. The Tollip has sites for ubiquitination [22] , which considerably reduces its life-time. In these groups of animals, it seems that Tollip has more sites available or sites with more affinity to ubiquitin. Starting from a virtual model of this protein, made from hsa sequence, at I-Tasser server using default variables had an estimated accuracy measured through TM-score of 0.3460.12 and a RMSD of 14.163.8 Ã… . We tried to identify the pattern of hydrophobic pockets, but it was seen that aliphatic residual apolarity is homogenously distributed along the entire sequence ( Figure 3.A and B) . The main residues, evidenced by conservation ( Figure 2 .A), likely construct the reaction pockets and in the order of the modular characteristics of this protein [66] , the alphahelixes and beta-sheets are domains for binding to specific ligands. Some ions showed to be important to conservation of tertiary structure as calcium II (BS Score 1.34-1.39, RMSD 3.00, TM-Score 0.349). It contacts with G69-D74-D121-E122-R123 residues, as can be seen at Figure 3 .C, that are relatively conserved. An organic compound, ligand 768 (1-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-3-{2imino-3-[2-(1-piperidinyl)ethyl]-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzimidazol-1-yl}-2-propanol), was found to be a ligand which contacts with E118-I131-A132-W133-L154 residues, as can be seen at Figure 3 .D, with a RMSD of 5.51, TM-Score of 0.25 and BS Score of 0.86. This ligand 768 is related with inhibition of calcium-dependent membrane binding activity of prothrombin and of factors Va, VIII and Xa of human coagulation pathway [67] by interaction with C2 domain. This interaction is consistent with Tollip modular criteria and its functions, revealing a potential need of Ca 2+ to maintain the C2 domain structure and could be potentially inhibited by 768 ligand. Splits graph (Figure 4 ) using a neighbor-net analysis, excluding parsimony uninformative sites, gaps and constant sites, showed a concentrated reticulation in the evolutionary history of Tollip, mainly disposed in superior animals. These groups present a complex diversification history. Indeed, these incongruences evidenced by trees (Figure 1 ) reveal an interesting clustering pattern in this protein, stressing the diversification of arthropod in detriment of others. This division is due to the diverse pathogenic Table 2 . Correlation between main assessed protein characteristics of Tollip.
