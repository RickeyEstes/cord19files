Viral respiratory pathogens were detected in 103/155 (66.5%) NPAs. The distribution of viral etiologic agents according to age is shown in Table 1 . The detected pathogens were RSV (32%), AdV (26.2%), PIV 1-4 (19.4%), RhV (18.4%), Flu (12.6%), MPV (12.6%), CoV (2.9%), and BcV (0.9%), respectively. RSV was identified more than any other virus (33/103, p<0.01). Only three CoV and one BcV infections were detected. AdV was also detected frequently (26.2% of RTIs). Parainfluenza viruses were detected in 19.4% of patients with PIV3 manifesting the major part of PIV (10.6%). Influenza viruses were found in 12.6% of samples with Flu A being the most common (8.7%). The most common pathogens in single infections (n=82; 79.6% total samples) were RSV (28%) and AdV (24.4%) with CoV and BcV comprising a much smaller percentage (2.4% and 1.2% respectively) ( Table 2 ). Coinfection with two or more pathogens were present in 21 samples (20.6%). Two pathogens were detected in 17 samples (16.5%), three pathogens in three samples (2.9%), and four pathogens were found in one sample (a two-year old boy with RSV, MPV, PIV2, and Flu A, who was hospitalized for URTI). The most common pathogens in coinfected samples were RSV (47.6%), RhV (47.6%), PIV (38%), AdV (33.3%), MPV (28.6%), Flu A&B (23.8%), and CoV (4.7%) where the most frequently detected coinfections were RSV/PIV (28.3% of coinfections) and RhV/AdV (19%) ( Table 2) . Patients positive for BcV and CoV were significantly older (mean 60 and 65 months, respectively) than other hospitalized patients (mean 33.7 months). Patients positive for RhV and RSV were significantly younger (mean 26 and 26.5 months, respectively) than other hospitalized patients (mean 42.6 months) (p<0.05); although patients with MPV and PIV had similar mean age (30.6 and 32.6 months, respectively) ( Table 1) . White blood cell counts were available for 90 (87.4%) of the patients. Leukocytosis was detected in 20 (22.2%) patients. Especially AdV (n=10) and RhV (n=6) were
