By using IFI prospectively, only 26 of the 85 nasopharyngeal aspirates (30.6%) were found positive, including 17 RSV, 9 ADV and 4 influenzavirus B; all of these infections were confirmed by the retrospective rt-PCR assay. The pneumococcal antigenuria, available in 60 cases, was positive in 13 patients, 3 of them exhibiting a threshold of 10 7 CFU/ml by conventional culture. In the three other pneumococcal infections, no antigenuria was available. Blood culture, performed in 38 cases (44%), was found positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae in only one case. By combining bacterial culture and retrospective rt-PCR assays, at least one pathogen was identified in 81 cases (95.3%). The number of detected pathogens was of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in 4 (4.7%), 30 Table 2) . From the 85 cases of CAP, 4 bacterial exclusive infections were observed (4.7%), 24 infections with at least one bacterium and one virus (28.2%) and 53 viral exclusive infections (62.4%). Coinfection by at least two viruses was observed in 37 cases (43.5%). Table 3 displays the distribution of the identified pathogens and specifies the various associations, the most common being ADV/RSV (10 cases), Haemophilus influenzae/ADV(8 cases) and hREV/BoV (8 cases). The monthly distribution of microbiological infections is depicted in Fig. 1.
