A hypothetical episode concerned with music concert in the central square of Novosibirsk is considered in the calculations, see Fig. 3 . The concert was hold from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. local time under meteorological conditions typical for the middle of July. The territory on which there was a crowd is shown in Fig. 3 with a dotted square. South-western wind was preset in the calculations with the velocity of 2 m s À1 at the height z ¼ 5 m above the underlying surface at the western boundary of the area under study, point ''A'' in Fig. 3 . According to the legend, during the concert the ''terrorists'' performed concealed use of a preparation of a highly pathogenic viral strain in aerosol form. A car with the aerosol source was running along the central street of the city crossing the square at the speed of 18 km h À1 . The source is shown by a solid line with an arrow in Fig. 3 . The spraying line was 250 m long. A total of 250 g of the preparation with the concentration of viral particles of 5 Â 10 10 g À1 was discharged into the atmosphere along the spraying line at the height of 2 m above the underlying surface. The spraying started at 3 p.m. It lasted for 40 s, which was much shorter than the concert duration. On this basis, the parameter hQi was preset as an ''instant'' linear source that occurred at 3 p.m. local time. Considering that the virus used by ''terrorists'' was very robust, the value b could be taken as zero. Aerodynamic diameter of particles was preset equal to 5 mm. Obviously, for the conditions set up for this case, V s value could be neglected. The calculations were performed on the difference template of 51 Â 35 Â 50 nodes with a step of 20 m along the horizontal line and 1.5 m along the vertical line, respectively. Fig. 4 presents the dependence of the number concentration of virus-containing aerosols hCi on the spreading time calculated at the height z ¼ 1.5 m above the underlying surface for points marked in Fig. 3 as 1 and 2 . It can be seen that the aerosol cloud crosses the area of the square heavily populated by people (shown with a dotted line) within less than 5 min.
