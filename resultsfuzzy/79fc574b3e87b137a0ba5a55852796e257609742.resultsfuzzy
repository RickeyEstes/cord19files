In general, to generate mature B cell for antibody production, 4 main mechanisms including the rearrangement of V, D, and J segments, the pairing of different VH and VL germline, the addition or deletion at the junctional site, encoded for CDR3 loop are involved. More diversity is further increased once the B cells have been stimulated with target antigen, inducing SHM at some hotspot to increase the affinity toward the foreign antigen. These four genetic processes have built a high diversity of variable region of antibodies [20] ). To study the genetic basis of our anti-DENV HuMAbs, the variable sequences of 19 IgGs isolated from acute dengue patients was studied. All of them were derived from blood sample of 3 patients of secondarily infected dengue virus serotype 2, within one week after the onset of fever [10] . HC and LC of all 19 IgGs were sequenced starting from human IgG leader peptide until constant region of IgG HC and LC. Only the variable regions were submitted to IMGT/V-QUEST to localize the FR and CDR. All sequences were productive IG rearranged sequences with no stop codon and in-frame junction, except 1 clone (23-5G8E3) have 5 aa insertion at CDR2. Variable region of heavy and light chain of 17 clones of them were submitted to database of DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) [12] . After comparing those sequences with germline database, 10 germline HCs and 11 germline LCs was used ( Table 2) . IGHV1-69 (5/19) and IGHV3-23 (5/19) are the major germline HC whereas IGLV7-43 is the major germline LC (Fig. 1A and B) . As IGHV1-69 was the highest HC germline used in our anti-DENV HuMAbs, interestingly, the highest percentage of IGHV1-69 HC germline was also previously reported from other anti-viral MAbs, such as influenza virus [14, 19] , HIV, SARS CoV, Hendra, and Nipah virus [16] . It was found that germline gene usages of both HC and LC were different among two libraries. HV1-46, HC3-33, and HV5-51 were most frequently found from library constructed from 40 days post infection PBMCs. In contrast, HV1-69 (26%) was the most frequently used HC germline from library constructed from 8 months PBMCs. Comparing with our study, that all 19 IgGs were generated from acute patient PBMCs from secondary dengue infection, it can be suggested that after primary infection, this IGHV1-69, which is the high frequency heavy chain germline presence in IgM repertoires [16] , should be the major group of germline heavy chain responsible for antibody production. After recovery, the human immune response can stay long in the human blood circulation. Once re-infection has occurred, the memory B cells were stimulated; therefore, high possibility of antibody production from this kind of germline heavy chain was observed. Other than the different combination of VH/VL to generate a high diversity of our anti-DENV HuMAbs, more variable were also found at the junctional site (length of CDR3). We found more variable occurred in HCDR3 of our HuMAbs, which ranged from 10 to 21 aa (Table 2 ), but not for LCDR3 which ranged from 9 to 11 aa (data not shown). This high diversity of HCDR3 was also observed from anti-HIV-1 antibody, which ranged from 4 to 27 aa, and considering as the determination of VH diversity of antibody repertoire [13] . Once the mature B cells have faced the dengue virus antigen, more diversity was enhanced by SHM. We observed these mutations throughout the variable regions with different degree, 5.1-21.6% variation for VH, with less variation for VL at 3.1-12.8%. Among 19 IgGs, three major groups are classified by type of germline HC. These 3 kinds of HC germline, which combined with 8 kinds of germline LC shared 13 HuMAbs. The other 7 HuMAbs have unique HC germline as shown in Table 2 . The alignment of HuMAbs HC from these 3 groups, along with their closest germline sequences, including their germline LC, as well as annotated FRs and CDRs are shown in Table 3 . It was noticed that among 4 HuM-Abs in Gr. 1, which used IGHV1-69 as HC germline, all of them used different germline LC (Table 3) . However, there is 1 HuMAb that showed the highest NT 50 , at 13 lg/ml, comparing with the other 3 which have NT 50 ranged from 1.1 to 1.6 lg/ml. It is implied Table 3 The amino acid sequences of heavy chain from 3 major groups, classified by type of heavy chain germline, of 13 HuMAbs in alignment of their predecessors germline, including type of its germline light chain and NT 50 . The CDRs and FR are located according to the immunogenetic annotation. The somatic mutations in the VH of each HuMAb are highlighted in gray color. that the combination of different HC and LC can greatly affect the binding of our antibodies with the target antigen (IGHV1-69 paired with IGLV2-11 is the less matched). In contrary, Gr. 3 composing of 3 HuMAbs (HuMAb 1B3B9, 4H12C8, 5E6B1) used the same HC and LC germline with different level of mutations. We found that, using the same originated germline, hypermutation also affect their NT 50 (Table 3) . Among these 3 HuMAbs, there are 2 HuMAbs (1B3B9 and 5E6B1) that showed the same level of mutation (14.4% and 13.4% for VH, and the same 13.5% for VL, respectively). Both of them showed the same NT 50 . In contrast, the other HuMAb (4H12C8) which have less variation comparing with its germline counterpart (5.1% for VH and 3.1% for VL) showed almost 2 times higher NT 50 concentration (Table 3) . However, for the less variation of same germline sequences, it can be suggested that germline-like antibody with low level of SHM can showed the relatively high binding with target antigen. This phenomenon was also previously evidenced by Chen et al. (2012b) . They supported that antibodies with minimally mutated can bind virus causing acute infection like SARS CoV, and Hendra virus with relatively high affinity, but not for chronic disease like HIV-1 [14] . Moreover, after detail characterization, 3 HuMAbs (1A10H7, 1B3B9, 1G7C2), which show the highest activity both in binding and neutralizing activities as previously described [12] was selected. It was noticed that these 3 clones did not showed the highest variation. Hence, it was suggested that the 4 mechanisms was generally play a role in increasing the binding affinity of one antibody toward the target antigen. To study the function of isolated VH and VL, those 3 best HuM-Abs were selected for production of rIgG, by subcloning of variable region of HC and LC to another 2 mammalian expression plasmids containing either constant HC or constant LC (kappa or lambda). The constructed plasmids were co-transfected to human embryonated kidney (HEK) 293T cell for rIgG expression, for testing of both binding and neutralizing activity. All three clones can bind to 4 serotypes of dengue virus infected Vero cell with the same manner as IgG secreted from hybridoma cell (Fig. 2) . Moreover, three of them also show almost the same neutralizing activity as those from hybridomas (Fig. 3) . To confirm the right combination of VH/VL from each monoclonal antibody, using the same constructed plasmid, different combinations of VH and VL constructs of those 3 HuMAbs were tested in the total of 9 combinations including the original VH/VL pairing. It was found that only the correct combination of each three clones can show the optimal binding activity by IFA. It was implied that the CDR loop, which is the region much responsible for antigen binding of these three clones need the correct combination of VH and VL and conformation to form the antigen binding site. For more understanding of affinity pathway, many more HuM-Abs with various activity, for example, low, moderate, and high NT titer are needed in identification of the critical position (hotspot) that are most likely to have a major impact on antibody activity and affinity.
