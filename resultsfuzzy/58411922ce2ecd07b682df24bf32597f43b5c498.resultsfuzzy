3.1. Material characterization 3.1.1. TiO 2 coating Fig. 2 shows the FTIR spectrum results of pristine PU, activated PU and TiO 2 /PU. The FTIR bands and their assigned vibrations are shown in Table 1 . The FTIR spectra indicate that the urethane group (-NH-CO-O-), which contains N-H, C-N, C@O and C-O bonds, in the pristine PU was successfully converted to an isocyanate group (-N@C@O) in the activated PU. The Si-O-Ti bond recorded in the FTIR spectra of TiO 2 /PU confirmed the silanization process between TTIP and APTES to create titanosiloxane (Scheme 1). As compared to the FTIR spectrum of the activated PU, the FTIR spectrum of TiO 2 /PU showed a strong increase in the N-H and C@O adsorption peaks, which are typical peaks of the urea group (-NH-CO-NH-). However, the isocyanate peak in TiO 2 /PU greatly decreased as compared to that of the activated PU. The peak intensity change revealed the successful formation of the urea linkage based on reaction between the isocyanate group of the activated PU and the amine group of the titanosiloxane (Scheme 1). Therefore, titania was successfully coated on the surface of PU by using the bridging role of APTES. Silicon in APTES Fig. 2 . FTIR spectra of pristine PU, activated PU and TiO 2 /PU. Fig. 3 shows the high-resolution XPS spectrum of the Cu 2p 3/2 peak of Cu in Cu-TiO 2 /PU. The Gaussian multipeak shapes were applied to fit the Cu 2p 3/2 peak to determine the state of copper in Cu-TiO 2 /PU. The peak analysis result revealed two components of copper in Cu-TiO 2 /PU: Cu + in Cu 2 O (932.3 eV) and Cu 2+ in CuO (933.5 eV) [29] . CuO in Cu-TiO 2 /PU was produced from thermal decomposition of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 during UV irradiation or calcination processes [22] . The UV irradiation (photo-reduction) and oxalic acid, rolled as a cleaner for the cleaning process, could reduce Cu 2+ into Cu + during the decomposition of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 to form Cu 2 O [30] [31] [32] [33] . Lin et al. reported that the Cu 2+ cations could penetrate into the TiO 2 lattice and substitute the Ti 4+ cations, leading to formation of Cu-O-Ti bonds [34] . The substitution of Cu 2+ into TiO 2 lattice was confirmed by XRD analysis (see Supplementary material). The substitution could also lead to the formation of Cu + in TiO 2 lattice. Therefore, the elemental states of the Cu dopant in Cu-TiO 2 /PU included Cu + and Cu 2+ , most of which existed in Cu 2 O and CuO forms, respectively, which are physically adsorbed on the TiO 2 surface. Another Cu + existed in the TiO 2 lattice in the form of Cu-O-Ti bonds. Fig. 4A shows that the pristine PU contained pores sized from 100 to 300 lm. Since, TiO 2 was smoothly and thinly coated on the PU surface in TiO 2 /PU, the TiO 2 layer did not greatly affect the pore size change of the PU substrate (Fig. 4B) . The SEM features of Cu-TiO 2 /PU exhibited small Cu 2 O and CuO particles that were deposited with good dispersion on the TiO 2 layer (Fig. 4C ). Fig. 4D shows the mixed mapping of Ti and Cu elements in the Cu-TiO 2 /PU material. The elemental mapping clearly shows that the Ti and Cu elements were deposited almost evenly or alternately on the PU frame, which may have caused the distinct photocatalytic activity of Cu-TiO 2 /PU for bioaerosol removal. The BET surface area of the synthesized TiO 2 /PU was 111.4 m 2 /g, which was much higher than that of PU (31.3 m 2 /g) or TiO 2 commercial powder (AEROXIDE Ã’ TiO 2 P25) obtained from Evonik Degussa Corporation (60 m 2 /g) [35] . The high surface area indicates that the immobilization process of TiO 2 onto the surface of PU, which could minimize the coagulation of the TiO 2 particles, strongly enhanced the surface area of TiO 2 . In addition, during (Table 1) contributing to enhancement in surface area and porosity of TiO 2 /PU [36] . Thus, the surface area of TiO 2 /PU could be higher than that of pure TiO 2 . The BET surface area of the synthesized Cu-TiO 2 /PU was 166.3 m 2 /g, which was higher than that of PU or TiO 2 /PU. This strong improvement in the surface area was attributed to significant deposition of small Cu 2 O and CuO particles on the TiO 2 layer (Fig. 4C) . The distribution of the particles increased the degree of surface roughness leading to increase in the surface areas of the Cu-TiO 2 /PU.
