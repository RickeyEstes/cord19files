Section:the results presented in this study strengthen our previous finding [20] that stem-loop structures situated just 3' to the retroviral frameshift sites are both highly stable and statistically significant relative to others in the gag-pol or gagpro and pro-pol junction domains (600 nt). a pseudoknot is defined in this article as a basepairing interaction of a loop with a free-base span (unpaired bases not within a loop) in an rna structure. the pseudoknot structure may result in a quasi-continuous coaxial extension of stem re-
