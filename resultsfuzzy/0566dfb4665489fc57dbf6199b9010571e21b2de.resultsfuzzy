Results from tests performed on the 300 fecal samples revealed that one horse (0.33%) had one Cryptosporidium oocyst and two other horses (0.66%) had Giardia cysts. The horses that were detected positive with Giardia cysts were both male Quarter Horses, aged 11 and 14. These prevalence results are consistent with the Cryptosporidium/Giardia Study conducted in California/ Detailed information on the positive Cryptosporidium horse. Only a single oocyst was detected in the fecal sample from this horse, suggesting that potentially the oocyst was ingested and then expelled without undergoing development within the microvillous border of the intestine of this horse. Three months after the initial laboratory detection of the Cryptosporidia oocyst, another fresh fecal sample was obtained from this same horse and retested for Cryptosporidium and Giardia using the same procedure. Results from the second Merifluor TM Direct Immunofluorescent Detection Procedure indicated that the horse was negative for both Cryptosporidium and Giardia. An aerobic fecal culture on the second sample indicated normal flora growth and the EM Scan/Elisa test was negative; in addition, no Salmonella was detected. The fecal exam results quantitatively indicated that there were 130 strongyle eggs per gram, suggesting that the horse was parasitized to some degree. This female Quarter Horse was 24 years old, immunocompromised, had bad teeth and poor digestion. In addition, the horse was ridden on trails on a daily basis as a part of a commercial riding establishment. At the time the first sample was collected, the horse had no abnormal, clinical signs associated with Cryptosporidium, with the excep-bTechmque used at the Veterinary Diagnosttc Laboratory at Colorado State University, Fort Colhns. tion of weight loss, per the owner. However, based on the case history of this horse, weight loss could conceivably be due to the 130 strongyle eggs per gram found in the fecal exam coupled with immunocompromisation, poor digestion, and bad teeth. The horse was taken out of the working string due to the weight loss and placed on pasture where it regained weight. The occurrence of the Cryptosporidia oocyst found in the first fecal sample could be attributed to the horse being allowed to drink water from the stream during long trail rides and the nearby high beaver population and running stream where the horse was housed. Overall Conclusion. Based on the low prevalence of Cryptosporidia in the trail horse population surveyed, it can be concluded that the adult recreational trail horse population in Colorado is not likely to be a significant source of Cryptosporidium environmental contamination in watershed areas.
