The LRDI approach circa 2007 used for the MS study (two generations behind the present LRDI approach) is not limited to MS. It is applicable to any chronic or infectious disease, and in some short studies I have done, could also be used to accelerate healing of wounds and injuries. In particular, for those diseases where diet plays a major role in determining whether or not the disease symptoms will occur, as in Dr. Wahls' case, the 2007 version of LRDI would probably be sufficient to identify diets that may have the same effect for other diseases that Dr. Wahls' diet had for MS. I firmly believe that the present incarnation of LRDI can be applied to any chronic or infectious disease, and for those whose causes can be identified, can generate results at least as good as those of Dr. Wahls, and probably better. Unfortunately, almost all the funding for healing from these diseases is focused on 'treatments' without understanding or eliminating cause. These have been, are being, and will continue to be dead-end approaches. They involve kicking the can down the road without addressing fundamental causes.
