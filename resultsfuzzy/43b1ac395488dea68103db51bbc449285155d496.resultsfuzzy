Two algorithm versions, one without and one with the calibration step were developed. The performance of these algorithms is shown in Table 3 . The most important requirement was to achieve a specificity higher than 98% which both algorithms attained. The algorithm with calibration applied in house 3 achieved 100% specificity. The sensitivity of the algorithm with calibration applied in houses 1 and 2 was always higher than 50%, respectively 57.52% and 50.82%, so these met the criteria. In house 3, the algorithm without calibration underperformed with only 16% sensitivity while the algorithm with calibration performed at 42%. The precision was always above 75% which indicates that three out of four detected sounds were calf coughs. Despite, using a specificity higher than 98%, only 75% of the detected sounds were coughs in house 1. The algorithm needs on average 96 min for one day of data on a desktop pc as described under Section 2.9. The results of the calibrated algorithm over the period from the 1st April to the 11th June are shown for each house in Figs. 6-8. These figures show the number of coughs detected per hour. In houses 1 and 2, 48 and 36 coughs, respectively, were detected on average per hour, while in house 3 only 16 coughs were detected per hour. The algorithm data of houses 1 and 2 show that most coughs were detected between 23:00 h and 12:00 h. In total 38% more coughs per hour were detected during this period. To detect periods of increased coughing, Figs. 6-8 were visually assesed. When the number of coughs increased from a constant low level we regarded it as the start of an increased coughing per- Table 3 The performance of the algorithm on the labelled data for each calf house. The results for house 1 are divided between training and validation data. The other houses provided validation data only. In these houses the results are divided between the non-calibrated and the calibrated data. The number of calves with high rectal temperature and high RS (GS1) and with high neutrophil number (GS2) were compared to the increased coughing periods (Figs. 9-11 ). The number of calves treated for BRD is also shown. It is evident that a greater number of calves presenting with BRD (GS1) were present in house 1 and 2 than in house 3. In total 24, 14 and, 6 animals presented with BRD in house 1, 2 and, 3 respectively. This is also supported by the number of coughs detected by our algorithm.
