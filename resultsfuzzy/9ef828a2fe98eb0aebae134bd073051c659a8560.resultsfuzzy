To design anti-HIV siRNA, we analyzed the 495 near fulllength HIV-1 sequences listed in Supplementary conserved siRNAs constituted only 0.3% of the possible siRNAs if >90% conservation is expected ( Figure 1A) . The fraction is still as small as 0.8% even if the threshold of the conservation is relaxed to 80%. On the other hand, siRNAs predicted to be functional by one or more guidelines (6) (7) (8) constituted 35.5% of the 4 417 157 siRNAs ( Figure 1B) . Taken together, siRNAs that are >80% conserved, and satisfy at least one guideline constitute only 0.2% of the siRNAs. In this condition, 20-30 siRNAs can be designed for each full-length sequence of HIV-1. These indicate that most of the randomly designed siRNAs are not suited for targeting HIV-1 efficiently. Figure 1C shows typical output from siVirus for designing anti-HIV siRNAs. A total of 182 sequences from HIV-1 subtypes B, C and CRF01_AE, which are the most prevalent HIV-1 genotypes circulating in Asia, were selected. The results were sorted by their degree of conservation, and filtered to display siRNAs that satisfy at least one efficacy guideline. The off-target search results against human genes are also shown. It is desirable to select an siRNA that has less off-target hits. To test the validity of siVirus, 35 siRNAs satisfying the guideline by Ui-Tei et al. (6) were designed against the conserved regions of HIV-1 genomes using siVirus and were assayed for inhibition of viral replication. Among them, 31 siRNAs effectively inhibited HIV-1 replication by >80% when each siRNA duplex was transfected at 5 nM (Y. Naito, K. Ui-Tei, K. Saigo and Y. Takebe, unpublished data).
