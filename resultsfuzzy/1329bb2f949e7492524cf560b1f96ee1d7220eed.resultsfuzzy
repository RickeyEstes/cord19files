Using CMK peptide and six compounds in Fig. 1 , we generated a set of seven eight-point pharmacophore models for SARS-CoV main proteinase, which is listed in Table 1 . These hypotheses exhibit different features due to the diversities of the compounds involved. Based on these models, we extracted a common four-point pharmacophore distance pattern shown in Fig. 2 , P1 is HBA, HBD and HPC, P2 is HBA and HPC, P3 is HBA and HBD, P4 is HBA and HBD. Such a pharmacophore distance pattern was subsequently used for the 3D database search. The pharmacophore searching in 3D database was conducted in the 3D NCI database, which has 250, 251 open structures ready for searching. Table 2 summarizes the results for similarity search of above-mentioned four-point pharmacophore model with constraints: (1) the distance ranges for P1P2, P1P3, P2P3, P1P4, P2P4 and P3P4 (Fig. 2 ) are 2-3, 2-3, 1.5-2.5, 5-6, 3-4 and 3-4 Å, respectively; (2) the compound is drug; (3) the antiviral probability is over 70%; (4) the compounds labeled as "No Name" is not in- Table 1 The eight-point pharmacophore models obtained by LigBuilder from seven peptide and compounds Pharmacophore Peptide/ compounds cluded. After review of these hitlists, 30 drugs were selected for further analysis, their chemical structures and bioactivities (documented in anti-HIV and anti-opportunistic infection chemical compound database, which contains approximately 100,000 compounds, http://www.apps1.niaid.nih. gov/struct_search/an/an_search.htm) are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 3 , respectively. It is noted that almost all drugs exhibited anti-HIV activity, and some of them have activities against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (puromycin), influenza [27] . Indeed, among the 30 drugs are six compounds that already exhibited anti-SARS-CoV activity experimentally: azauridine, pyrazofurin, ribavirin, 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine, dideoxyguanosine, and 5-bromo-2′-deoxycytidine [4, 5] . This shows that our pharmacophore model can lead to the discovery of potent anti-SARS-CoV inhibitors or at least provide some useful clues. Fig. 4 shows the mappings of the six compounds into the four-point pharmacophore model, which are mapped to 1-3 HBA, 1-2 HBD and 0-1 HPC. In addition, most of the remaining compounds have remarkable similarities with one of the above six compounds, for example, azauridine with 5-AZCR, alexan, arauridine and spongothymidin; 5-bromo-2′-deoxycytidine with emanil, fialuridine, floxuridin, radibud, thymidin and viroptic; dideoxyguanosine with angustmycin C, cordycepin, tubercidin, vengicide and vira-A. The superpositions for these compounds are shown in Fig. 5 . In summary, our results indicate that the existing 30 drugs identified by our pharmacophore model could be potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV, or at least good lead compounds for anti-SARS-CoV drug design.
