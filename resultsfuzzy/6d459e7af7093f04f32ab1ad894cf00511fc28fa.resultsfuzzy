For the discussion in this paper, I consider one output and six inputs. Available seat miles (ASM) is used as output of the airlines. Inventory adjustment of seats provides airlines active control to wither a difficult environment. Airlines adjust ASM quite frequently as had been the case soon after 9/11 and continue to do so at present. Unlike other aspects of the business (e.g. revenue passenger miles (RPM) or load factor (LF)), airlines have a greater decision-making authority over ASM and thus it serves as a good choice for output. Inputs are gallons of jet fuel, number of full time employees (FTEs); ratio of flight stage miles to trip stage miles; utilization of aircraft (in hours); number of seats per aircraft; and number of aircraft. Annual data for 1985-2006 is used. Data come from Airline Monitor's processing of Form 41 and T100 database that is publicly available at the US Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Vasigh and Flemming (2005) used RPM in addition to ASM as outputs, although airlines typically have very little control over the demand side of the market as usually represented by RPM. The RPM, i.e. those paying for a seat mile, results from a mixture of demand and price. Airlines produce and supply ASMs given an anticipated price and a host of other factors. Important in all are the FTEs and jet fuel. Together, they accounted for almost 60% of the airlines' operating expenses in 2008. Often, these inputs are considered to be variable costs of production and important factors in determining airlines performance. The ratio of flight stage to trip lengths is considered to be representing airlines' underlying preference for network configuration. For example, a passenger traveling from city A to city C non-stop has the same flight stage and trip length. However, if this itinerary requires a stop-over at city B, then, the flight stage miles increases without necessarily reducing the trip length between A and C. With a considerable reliance on hub-and-spoke network (Bhadra and Texter, 2004) , especially by the legacy carriers, it is expected that trip length and flight stage would diverge. The opposite would be true if the representative airline preferred spoke-to-spoke network, as appears to be the case for some of the LCCs. Since so much of the airlines business appears to ride on network configuration, consideration of this input as a measure of network configuration in the production of output, ASM, seems appropriate. Over the years, evidence has emerged that two operational factors leading to LCC efficiency are their quick turn-around of aircraft and rational fleet structure. Quick turn-around is, ultimately, reflected by utilization of aircraft. Rationalized fleet structure is represented by a measure of seats per aircraft; more homogeneous the number of seats per aircraft, the more rational fleet structure airlines are presumed to have (e.g. B737 for Southwest; or A320 for jetBlue). Larger aircraft may produce higher ASMs but at the cost of higher turn-around time. Furthermore, a heterogeneous fleet structure (i.e. variable number of seats per aircraft) may also impose burdens on productive efficiency that cannot be clearly understood without comparing performance of one airline (i.e. those using homogeneous fleet structure) to another (i.e. those using heterogeneous fleet structure). Utilizing aircraft efficiently is a variable input while seats per aircraft and number of aircraft are essentially fixed capital investments. In determining both the levels and efficiency behind given levels of ASM, these variables also play crucial roles. A relatively long period -1985 to 2006 -is considered for two reasons: first, airlines adjustments are often cyclical, intricately related to economic ups-and-downs. Technical adjustments that are not long enough are often unable to capture these cycles. Second, airlines operations are capital-intensive and require a long gestation period. This often requires substitution among resources that cannot be captured in a short time horizon. Consideration of longer time periods thus provides a greater window into understanding the nature of the substitutions that lead ultimately to technical efficiency. There are two components to technical efficiencies. First, an airline can be evaluated on the basis of its own technical performances over time -inter-temporal self-efficiency. That is, given the data for 22 years, one can use DEA methodology to evaluate representative airline's own technical efficiency over time. For the 13 airlines and 22 years, runs were made 2 to answer the question of how each airline has performed over time. As noted by Gillen and Lall (1997b) this is one of the significant benefits of the DEA measure in that it can be used for both inter-temporal as well as cross-sectional comparisons (Fig. 4) . The vertical axis measures the score of technical inefficiencies and the horizontal axis reporting annual years. As discussed earlier, the index has a lower bound of unity and represents efficient operation (i.e. producible equals to ASM produced), while index values greater than unity represents inefficiency. Results presented in the above figure indicates that while some airlines (Air Tran, Frontier, and Spirit) were doing relatively poorly in the beginning of their operations, their technical efficiencies improved and began to converge towards the index value of unity (i.e. technically efficient) as time progressed. Given limited operational history, for Spirit and Air Tran (erstwhile Valu Jet) in particular, doing well-required time and learning. Southwest's inter-temporal performance deteriorated between 1995-2000 and again in 2003. In the beginning of the period and shortly after 2003, Southwest's inter-temporal performance approached unity. It is also evident that almost all legacy carriers have done relatively poorly when compared against its inter-temporal performance earlier. However, all the legacy carriers appear to have gradually improved their technical efficiencies. In the final 3 years, for example, all the carriers' performances converged to unity. Thus, in aggregate, airlines seem to learn from their past operational performances and improved technical efficiencies when compared to their own historical performance. However, doing well compared to one's own performance does not mean that one cannot still do poorly compared with, or that one is efficient more generally. In an industry that is as competitive as the airline industry, suppliers also need to perform well within their peer group and over time. Thus, an annual technical efficiency index is constructed for each of the 13 airlines -a peer group efficiency index. How well each airline performed within its own industry group in a particular year and over time is the focus of the next result. Results are seen in Fig. 5 . All the LCCs registered efficient operations in the peer group efficiency measure throughout. This result does not come as a surprise and further confirms the existing belief that LCCs are technically efficient providers of air travel. The peer group inefficiency appeared to have been concentrated around in the middle of the 1990s, particularly during 1994-2000 and is pronounced for airlines such as Continental, Northwest, Alaska and USAir. A further interesting point is to note that prior to 1994 only Delta and Continental registered inefficient in their peer group comparison. Interestingly, American Airlines and United -two of the major legacy carriers -are found to be technically efficient. Generally speaking, the performance of US airlines have steadily converged over time. In 2006 and the year before, only USAir and Alaska demonstrated technical inefficiencies compared to all their peers. In 2004, Continental demonstrated technical inefficiency in addition to Alaska. While Alaska continues to operate, USAir has now merged with America West. The latter's performance had been fairly robust (with an efficiency index value of unity) over the entire 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999
