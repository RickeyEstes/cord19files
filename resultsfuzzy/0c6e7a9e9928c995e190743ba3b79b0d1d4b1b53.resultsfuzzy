Here we report, on the example of natural abundant menthofuran (3,6-dimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzofuran 1), first synthetically appropriate results on the transition metal-free crosscoupling of the furan ring with haloacetylenes 2a-g initiated by their grinding with most common solid oxides and salts (10-fold amount) without solvent and then allowing them to stand at room temperature for 1e72 h. The reaction course (conversion of reactants 1, 2 and the products ratio) was controlled by 1 H NMR spectra of the CDCl 3 extracts from the reaction mixture. Menthofuran was chosen as a furan representative, first, due to its higher nucleophilicity (donor effect of the cyclohexane ring and two methyl groups) compared to commonly available furan compounds and, second, because menthofuran is a popular natural product, which is contained in the peppermint and exercises a great effect on the aroma of that oil. 34 Also, it is the precursor of menthofurolactone and dehydromenthofurolactone, two compounds whose sweet and persistent coumarinic odor is the hallmark of premium-quality peppermint oils. 35e37 This well-known fragrance is also a potent hepatotoxin and is obtained from Mentha pulegium L., a plant used in folk medicine as an abortifacient. 37 A preliminary attempt to realize this reaction for furan and 2methylfuran has shown that only the corresponding cycloadducts are formed instead of the expected ethynylated furans. 38 We have started to study this reaction for benzoylbromoacetylene 2a (as acylhaloacetylene representative) using Al 2 O 3 as a solid medium. According to the experiments, after 1 h the reaction results in formation of ethynylfuran 3a along with the pair of diastereomeric cycloadducts of oxanorbornadiene structure 4a in 44:56 ratio (Scheme 1). The reaction is strictly regioselective: the bromine atom is neighboring the position 2 of the furan ring exclusively: NOESY interaction between protons of CH 2 -5 group and H-ortho protons of phenyl ring confirms C-4 location of benzoyl fragment. After standing reaction mixture for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h the content of ethynylfuran 3a increased to 64%, 80% and 88%, correspondingly, while cycloadduct content was diminished. These results indicate that cycloadduct 4a converts to ethynylfuran 3a with elimination of hydrogen bromide, i.e. the cycloadduct 4a is kinetic intermediate of the ethynylation. As it was shown on the example of cycloadduct 4a, such derivatives of menthofuran can be isolated and handled under normal conditions. We then turned our attention to other oxides and salts (SiO 2 , NaCl, K 2 CO 3 and K 3 PO 4 ) as solid media to implement the same reaction (Table 1 ). In the SiO 2 medium menthofuran was unstable and after 1 h the reaction mixture consisted of mainly the starting acetylene 2a (60%), content of ethynylfuran 3a and cycloadduct 4a being 26% and 13%, correspondingly. If NaCl was used as a solid medium, the main product was cycloadduct 4a (54%). The other products were ethynylfuran 3a (16%) and 3,3-bis(3,6-dimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzofuran-2-yl)-1-phenylprop-2-en-1-one (5) (19%) (Scheme 2). Acetylene 2a was also present in the reaction mixture (11%), while menthofuran was absent. Contrary to the exceptions in the presence of more basic medium (K 2 CO 3 , K 3 PO 4 ) ethynylation was a minor process, while the major one was cycloaddition (Table 1) . It is important to underline that, when neat reactants (1 and 2a) without a solid medium are ground, neither ethynylfuran 3a nor cycloadduct 4a are formed, while exothermic reaction take place resulting in resin-like product. Upon dropwise addition of furan 1 to cooled (10 C) acetylene 2a the obtained reaction mixture (room temperature, 1 h) consisted of cycloadduct 4a and propenone 5 in 60:40 ratio, no ethynylfuran 3a being detected. Interestingly, under these conditions (out of a solid medium) cycloadduct 4a was not transformed to ethynylfuran 3a, whereas in CDCl 3 it isomerized to 2-bromo-3-hydroxytetrahydronaphthalene 6a (Scheme 3). Thus as indicated above, Al 2 O 3 has proven to be a medium of choice from the oxides and salts studied for the synthesis of ethynyl derivatives of menthofuran 3a. Therefore, this oxide was used to evaluate the influence of halogen atom in acylhaloacetylene on the reaction course (Table 2) . Chlorobenzoylacetylene reacts with furan 1 to afford after 1 h cycloadduct 4a as major product (3a: 4a ratio is the 36: 62), the reactant conversion being complete. As anticipated, after 3 h, content of ethynylfuran 3a insignificantly increased and within 72 h the only product was ethynylfuran 3a. The reaction of furan 1 with iodobenzoylacetylene proceeds slower, after 3 h composition of the reaction mixture being 1: 2a: 3a: 4a: 5 ¼ 9: 17: 28: 11. In 72 h cycloadduct 4a disappears and the reaction mixture contains ethynylfuran 3a along with propenone 5 in the ratio of 49: 18 (Table 2) . Thus, in contrast to cross-coupling of pyrroles with acylhaloacetylenes in solid media, ethynylation of the furan moiety with acylhaloacetylenes proceeds through [4 þ 2]-cycloaddition followed by ring-opening with elimination of HHal. It is also in keeping with quantitative conversion of isolated cycloadduct 4a, upon its passing through SiO 2 or Al 2 O 3 column, into ethynylfuran 3a. As further experiments have shown, this ethynylation is also applicable for bromoacetylenes with formyl (2b), acetyl (2c), furoyl (2d), and thenoyl (2e) groups at the triple bond, which react with Scheme 1. Reaction of menthofuran 1 with benzoylbromoacetylene 2a in the Al 2 O 3 medium. For bromopropiolate 2f, the major reaction product was cycloadduct 4f, which in the CDCl 3 solution was isomerized to 2-bromo-3-hydroxynaphthalene 6f. Ethynylfuran 3f in this case was minor product, its isolated yield being just ca. 10% (Schemes 4 and 5). In the case of bromodiacetylene 2g, the only isolated product was bicyclic propiolate 6g, the isomer of the expected cycloadduct 4g (Scheme 6). Thus, it appears likely that the oxanorbornadiene intermediates such as 4a, reversibly generated on the first reaction step, transform to the ethynyl derivatives of menthofuran via zwitterion B with the positive charge distributed over the whole furan moiety. The latter eliminates hydrogen bromide in the concerted process (hydrogen releases from the position 2 of the furan moiety, Scheme 7). An experimental evidence for the proposed mechanism is the observation that cycloadducts 4 are gradually transformed to ethynylated products 3. The formation of the intermediate zwitterion B is supported by isolation of propenone 5 resulted from substitution of bromine atom either in zwitterion B or bromovinyl intermediate 7 (Scheme 8) . An alternative route to propenone 5 might be the nucleophilic addition of the second molecule of menthofuran to ethynyl derivative of menthofuran 3a (Scheme 8). However, as shown by a special experiment, ethynylfuran 3a did not add furan 1 under the reaction conditions. The mechanistic rationalizations here considered are supported by the fact that the furan derivatives, having no donor substituents, like furan-2-carbaldehyde and its acetals as well as 6methoxybenzofuran, happened to be reluctant in the reaction with haloacetylenes under the conditions studied (Fig. 1) . Indeed, the initial [4 þ 2]-cycloaddition is a typical Diels-Alder condensation with inverse electronic demand, i.e., diene (in this case furan moiety) should be electron-rich compound, correspondingly the opened form of cycloadduct, the zwitterion B, should be the more stable the stronger donor substituent are in the furan moiety.
