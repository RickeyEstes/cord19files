In order to further explore the alteration in the transcriptome profile of PK-15 cells during PDCoV infection, the global gene expression profiles of PK-15 cells after infection, including 24 hpi (INF_24h) and 36 hpi (INF_36h), as well as uninfected PK-15 cells (NC), which acted as negative controls, were obtained by RNA sequencing. A total of approximately 1.6 billion raw reads were initially generated through sequencing. After filtering out the reads with adapters, the reads with ambiguous nucleotides, and the reads of low quality, a total of nearly 156.2 million clean reads remained, with approximately 7.8 G bases per sample. Clean data were indicated by a low sequencing error rate (0.03%) and the high quality of identified nucleobases via sequencing (Q20 > 97%, Q30 > 92%). The guanine-cytosine (GC)-content of clean reads ranged from 52.94% to 54.2%. These high-quality clean reads were subsequently mapped to a reference genome (NCBI genome database: Sus scrofa 11.1) which exhibited total mapping rates > 94% and unique mapping rates > 91%. From this, approximately 21,416 expressed genes, including 5,874 novel genes, were identified per sample. The RNA sequencing statistics are listed in Table 1 . Table) . The DEGs in these 2 comparisons were the genes that were mainly affected during PDCoV infection. In order to identify the alteration of innate immune-related genes in host cells as PDCoV post infection time increased, porcine innate immune genes were further screened. Up to date, porcine innate immune genes have not been collected into a database which can be conveniently updated frequently. In addition, the anatomy, organization, and response of pig immune system are very similar to humans' [34] . Thus, the porcine innate immune genes that included in the DEGs were screened by referring to the innate immune genes list of the Inna-teDB (http://www.innatedb.ca/redirect.do?go=aboutIDB) which provides a total of 1,040 curated human genes related to the innate immune response. There were 156 and 23 swine innate immune genes that were differentially expressed in INF_24h versus NC and INF_36h versus INF_24h, respectively. In INF_24h versus NC, innate immune DEGs with 120 upregulated and 36 downregulated tendencies were identified in INF_24h compared to NC (Fig 4A) . In INF_36h versus INF_24h, 19 genes were downregulated in INF_36h while 4 genes were upregulated (Fig 4B) . Of note, most of the differential expressed innate immune genes including I-IFNs such as IFN-α1 and IFN-β1 (also known as IFN-β) were upregulated in cells at 24 hpi comparing to uninfected cells, and downregulated in cells at 36 hpi comparing to cells at 24 hpi, which indicated that innate immune response was initially enhanced and then inhibited in cells at 24 hpi and 36 hpi, respectively. In addition, these 2 comparison groups shared 400 DEGs (Fig 5A) . A total of 17 DEGs including IFN-α1 and IFN-β1 belonged to porcine innate immune-associated genes (Fig 5B) . Five of the 17 genes were randomly selected for validation via qRT-PCR, and the results showed that the relative expressions of these genes were coincident with our RNA sequencing results (Fig 6) .
