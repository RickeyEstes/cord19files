Microscopic examinations of the appendices revealed that, of the 29 cases in the study group, 17 had diffuse hemorrhages and 6 had focal hemorrhage in the lymphoid follicles and lamina propria (Fig. 1A) . A large number of lymphocytes and red blood cells were found in the lumen of the appendix of 20 cases with hemorrhage. Lymphocytic infiltration of the epithelium in both the luminal surface and the crypts is focally evident (Fig. 1B) . Eosinophils were Table 3 Comparison of white blood cell (WBC) count (10 9 /L) and neutrophils in differential WBC count (mean Ϯ SE) between patients at the school and controls * Neutrophil counts were processed into continuous variables with arcsine transformation.

There were significant differences in WBC count and neutrophils in differential WBC between patients at the school and controls. found in 14 of the 29 cases, infiltrating the lamina propria, submucosa, lymphoid follicles (Fig. 1C) , and transmurally in the muscle layers (Fig. 1D ). In 5 cases there was evident lymphocytic infiltration in the serosa, and in 2 cases there was hemorrhage in the subserosal layer. Parasite eggs were not identified in appendices. Two cases revealed characteristics of acute suppurative appendicitis. In contrast, among the 8 control patients, microscopic examination revealed characteristics of early acute appendicitis in 2 cases and characteristics of acute suppurative appendicitis in 6 cases, with infiltration of neutrophils in various layers of the appendices without hemorrhage and without eosinophils (not shown). Immunohistochemistry tests for enteroviruses and adenviruses were positive for relevant positive controls and negative for appendical tissue sections from all 11 cases from the high school and 8 control cases from the college, and negative controls (data not shown).
