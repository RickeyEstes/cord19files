Phenotypic and morphological characterization of P. alecto BM-derived dendritic cells and macrophages. We hypothesised that similarly to human and mouse bone marrow (BM)-derived mononuclear cells (MNC), bat BM-derived MNC would differentiate into macrophages in the presence of CSF-1, into bona fide dendritic cells (DC) in the presence of FLT3L, and into monocyte-derived DC in the presence of GM-CSF + IL-4 [24] [25] [26] [27] . Based on sequences obtained from the P. alecto genome 28 , we produced recombinant P. alecto CSF-1, GM-CSF, IL-4-GFP fusion proteins and a fusion protein comprising the functional unit of P. alecto FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L) called vaccibodies ( Supplementary Fig. S1a,b) . P. alecto FLT3L vaccibodies were initially produced to detect FLT3L-expressing cells among primary bat MNC but it showed good functional activity and, thus, was used in this study. In order to characterise BM-derived MNC by flow cytometry, we first validated that antibodies directed against human or mouse membrane molecules allowed to detect membrane molecules with a similar cellular expression pattern in P. alecto bat ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S1c ). Antibodies previously described as cross-species reactive and targeting membrane proteins that showed good conservation between P. alecto human and mouse were used ( Supplementary Fig. S1a ). We also used an anti-CD3 intracellular domain (highly conserved across-species) and a commercial anti-bat IgG (Martìnez Gòmez et al., Scientific Reports, in press). Among live CD44 + lung MNC, CD11b + cells could be split into MHC-II lo/− and MHC-II + cells while putative CD3 + IgG − T cells and CD3 − IgG + B cells could be detected among CD11b − cells ( Supplementary Fig. S1c ). This analysis showed that both CD11b + MHC-II − (putative monocyte/macrophages) and CD11b + MHC-II + (putative DC) expressed high levels of another myeloid cell marker, CD172a (SIRPα ), but did not express the B (IgG) and T (CD3) cell lineage markers (Fig. 1a ). Using these antibodies, we next analysed P. alecto BM-derived MNC cultured for 6 days (D6) with P. alecto FLT3L vaccibodies, GM-CSF+ IL-4 (GM/IL-4) or CSF-1 and compared them to the BM cells at Day 0 (D0, ex vivo) by flow cytometry (Fig. 1b -d, see Supplementary Fig . S1d for the total gating strategies). At D6, adherent cells from the three different culture conditions showed an increased size (FSC-A) and granulosity (SSC-A) as compared to ex vivo BM cells (Fig. 1b) , suggesting in vitro acquired activation in our culture conditions. It is important to note that most cells were adherent in these three culture conditions, while this was not the case when cultured in the absence of any of these growth factors. While 53.5% of ex vivo BM cells (D0) expressed the myeloid marker CD11b, 65.7% and 69.9% of D6 FLT3L-and GM/IL-4-cultured cells expressed CD11b, respectively. When cells were cultured 6 days in the presence of CSF-1, the proportion of CD11b + cells reached 84.8% (Fig. 1b,c) . Cells were also analysed for expression of CD172a (SIRPα ) and for MHC-II, with this latter molecule being expressed at an intermediate level by immature BM-derived dendritic cells (BM-DC) and at a high level by mature BM-DC obtained from both human or mouse BM 29 . From the five bats tested, among CD44 + CD11b + cells, a well-defined population of CD172a + MHC-II hi cells was observed only when cells were cultured 6 days with the pan-DC growth factor FLT3L (Fig. 1b,d) . A population of CD172a +/lo MHC-II int cells could also be detected in both D6 FLT3L and GM/ IL-4-cultured BM-derived cells, and only in low proportion in CSF-1-cultured BM-derived cells (Fig. 1b,d) .
