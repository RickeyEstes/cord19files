After the PEDV outbreak in the United States in 2013, followed by the fast spreading of the virus to Canada, Mexico, Korea, and Taiwan, an important turn in PED research has taken place [1] . Thus, a relevant increase of studies about the epidemiology, genetic structure, and characteristics of PEDV has occurred to get a better understanding of this disease, which is currently the most fatal in pigs and one of the economic concerns for the pig industry [4] . In the present study, an analysis of PEDV field sequences from Ecuador was conducted by comparison with all the PEDV S gene sequences available in the GenBank database. In addition, phylogenetic comparisons and Bayesian phylogeographic inference based on complete S gene sequences were conducted to track the origin and putative route of PEDV. The S gene of PEDV has more than 4000 nucleotides and encodes the S protein, which constitutes the spikes of the viral envelope, responsible for its high variability. The PEDV S glycoprotein is known to be an appropriate viral gene for determining the genetic relatedness among PEDV isolates [4] . The sequences obtained from the animals selected and the viral isolate PEDV/Cotopaxi/2014 were assembled, yielding a final fragment of 4414 nt of length for each one, all of them containing the 4160 nt of the complete S gene. The identity of the sequences obtained was 100% between them; therefore, to avoid redundant entries at GenBank database, the sequences were submitted as a single entry under the accession number KT336490. The genetic identity of the sequence KT336490 (thereafter mentioned as PEDV/Cotopaxi/2014) was initially inferred from BLASTn analysis sharing 99% with more than 94 isolates or strains of PEDV from US and Korea. The sequence of the PEDV USA/Colorado/2013 isolate (accession number: KF272920) was selected to compare the sequence PEDV/Cotopaxi/2014 since it showed the highest score from the BLASTn analysis. Thus, the sequence PEDV/Cotopaxi/2014 showed four nucleotide changes 1093AxG, 2454CxT, 3051CxT, and 3607CxT when both sequences were compared. Only two of these mutations led to amino acid changes when the deduced sequence was analyzed. The sequence PEDV/Cotopaxi/2014 showed the changes 360SxG and 1203LxF compared with the sequence of PEDV isolate USA/Colorado/2013. These mutations were not located at the neutralizing epitopes (SS2, SS6, or 2C10) [37] . Therefore, associations with possible adaptive advantages caused by escaping to the immune response of the host cannot be suggested. The mutation 360SxG was located into the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1 (Figure 1 ). Even though this domain has not been directly linked to PEDV tropism and functionality as in transmissible gastroenteritis virus and murine hepatitis virus [38] , it is recognized that it can influence virus infectivity [30] . Therefore, a mutation of serine in this domain could lead to an increase of the infectivity of the viral strains with this mutation, since serine is recognized as a catalytic residue of the trypsin (enzyme involved in the entry of the virus into the host cell in the digestive tract). Nevertheless, further virulence studies will be required to verify this role. [30] ; Chimera software v1.6.2 was used for visualization. Domains S1 (orange) and S2 (blue) are denoted. The C-terminal RBD of the S1domain is represented in pink; N-terminal RBD of S1 domain is highlighted in yellow. The mutation 360SxG found in PEDV/Cotopaxi/2014 is denoted and represented in red. The best-fit model and the shape parameter of the gamma distribution (alpha) for the tree are indicated in the upper-left side. The numbers at a node are posterior probability values estimated. All different genogroups are denoted; the different clades CI and CII previously described by Vlasova et al. [28] into the genogroup 2a are also denoted. The sequence of PEDV/Cotopaxi/2014 is highlighted in red. Blue rectangles denote PEDV strains previously classified as 2a in Zhang et al. [31] (see Figure 1B in Zhang et al. [31] ; the strains were clearly grouped into genogroup 2b but were denoted as 2a). The US INDEL sequences were also denoted. The phylogenetic relationships among the PEDV strains were reconstructed based on complete S gene by means of NJ, ML, and BI analyses. All algorithms yielded congruent results showing the same topologies, which was supported by moderate to high confidence values given by the bootstrap percentage and the posterior probability (Supplementary Material Figure S1 ). Even though the tree yielded by BI was the best, the statistical support for this tree was not significantly different from the NJ or ML trees (Supplementary Material Table S2 ). Thus, all topologies obtained showed two highly divergent genogroups (2a and 2b) (Supplementary Material Figure S1 ). For a better visualization of the results, a short tree obtained from 60 PEDV strains, representative of all genogroups or clades, was built by BI ( Figure 2) . Thus, the short tree showed the same distribution than the full tree (Supplementary Material Figure S1 and Figure 2 ). In Figure 2 , two clades belonging to the PEDV genogroups 2a and 2b can be clearly observed. In addition, from the genogroup 2a, two main clades (I and II) previously described by Vlasova et al. [28] were also obtained ( Figure 2 ). The sequence from the PED-outbreak in Ecuador PEDV/Cotopaxi/2014 was grouped into the clade II of PEDV genogroup 2a together with other sequences of isolates from Mexico, Canada, and United States ( Figure 2 ). This group was highly supported by 0.93 posterior probability value ( Figure 2 ). After the PED US outbreak, the virus rapidly spread to Canada and Mexico [4] . Whilst contaminated food by spray-dried porcine plasma positive to PEDV genome is pointed out as a possible way for introducing PEDV from US to Canada [18] , the legal movement of pigs is suggested as the source of introduction to Mexico (http://www.thepigsite.com/swinenews/36693/mexico-reports-83-outbreaks-of-pedv-to-oie/). In the group of sequences in which PEDV/Cotopaxi/2014 was included, the nearest country to Ecuador is Mexico, indicating that the movement (legal or illegal) of animals between Mexico and Ecuador could be a possible source of introduction of the virus to Ecuador. However, evidence about this possible link has not been found. Phylogeographic reconstruction identified a specific location for the root of the tree with posterior probabilities for state sp = 0.81 for the locality of China (Supplementary Material Figure S2 ). The phylogeographic study revealed the emergence of the Chinese PEDV strains followed by spreading to US in 2013 (Figures 3(a) and 3(b), Supplementary Material Video S1). Huang et al. [17] previously observed this result describing the US PED-outbreak as an intercontinental transmission of the Chinese strains. After introducing the Chinese PEDV strains to US the virus spread from US to Korea (Figure 3 (c), Supplementary Material Video S1). S. Lee and C. Lee [39] reported the circulation of new PEDV strains in South Korea that were genetically like PEDV strains that affected United States during 2013. This result suggested that the recent strains from South Korea might have been originated in the United States, caused by the importation of pig breeding stock during or after the sudden emergence of PEDV in the United States [39] . During 2010-2011, more than one-third of the total pig population in South Korea was slaughtered as control measure to foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks; thus a huge importation of breeding pigs from US was carried out without a proper implementation of a vaccination policy [39] . The phylogeographic study also revealed the introduction of the virus in Canada, Mexico, and Ecuador directly from the US (Figure 3 (d) and Supplementary Material Video S1). This result frames the most probable route of entry of PEDV to Ecuador from US. The sources of imports of live swine in Ecuador in 2014 were mainly from Chile and US (http://data.trendeconomy.com/trade/Ecuador/Import?com-modity=0103). Thus, this movement of pigs is suggested as the principal way for introducing PEDV to Ecuador. Because this is the first introduction of PEDV in Ecuador swine herds, a fast spread of the virus throughout the country is expected, especially because a vaccination policy against PEDV has not been implemented yet. Therefore, additional studies to decipher how the virus will be disseminated in Ecuador and to other South American countries will be required.
