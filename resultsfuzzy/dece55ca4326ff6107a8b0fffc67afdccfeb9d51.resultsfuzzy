Kinetics of vesicle fusion induced by wild-type DV fusion peptide Before solving the 3D structure of the DV fusion peptide, we assessed the fusogenic ability of this very short peptide using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assay for lipid mixing (Fig. 1a) . The result clearly demonstrated that the DV fusion peptide was able to induce vesicle fusion when the large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were composed of the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG), but not phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), or phosphatidylserine (PS). The requirement of PG for fusogenic activity may be related to specific features of this phospholipid such as the head group itself rather than a charge effect, since no fusion was observed for vesicles containing PS, another negatively charged phospholipid. Although the fusogenic capability of the E glycoprotein depends on an intact fusion loop, 11 it persists even after stripping the protein down to the loop itself, suggesting that the fusion-active structure is present in that small segment. This hypothesis has been reinforced by the recent solution of the structure of the prM-E complex, which showed that the M protein binds exactly on the fusion peptide region, blocking premature fusion. 20
