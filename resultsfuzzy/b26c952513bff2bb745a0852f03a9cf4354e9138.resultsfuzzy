Sequence analyses of the K 2P channel family revealed a patch of the conserved dibasic residues, R-X-R, immediately after the first transmembrane region (K. Hsu, J. Han, and E. Marban, unpublished) ( and thus did not conduct currents in the transfected cells, whereas TASK R40A and TASK AQA exhibited protein levels comparable to that of wild-type TASK. However, the latter two mutants showed functionally distinctive profiles. Therefore, we used these three mutants to test our hypothesis for the mechanism of Vpu-mediated release. These point mutations did not affect the expression of Vpu or the protein-protein oligomerization between TASK and Vpu in the heterologously expressed HEK-293 cells (Fig. S1 ). However, the interaction between Vpu and each mutant led to very different functional consequences. Both TASK R40A and TASK AQA exhibited fivefold higher single-channel activities than wild-type TASK, but Vpu inhibited only TASK AQA (70-80% inhibition, the same as for the wildtype channel in Fig. 2 B) . TASK R40A , with a singlechannel conductance threefold that of TASK AQA or the wild-type, maintained its currents and the cell membrane potential upon Vpu coexpression (Fig. 2) . TASK R40A also outperformed TASK and TASK AQA in restricting Vpumediated viral release (80% vs. 50% inhibition in Fig. 3 ). On the other hand, TASK R38A , with very little protein expression (Fig. S1 ), did not exhibit any detectable channel activities (Fig. 2) or the ability to suppress Vpu-mediated release (Fig. 3) . We observed that when TASK currents remained substantial, Vpu-assisted release was stagnant. There appears to be an inverse relationship between the magnitude of background K þ conductance and the efficiency of Vpu-mediated release. Conceivably, suppression of the stabilizing background K þ currents could unleash viral particle release. The sustaining background K þ conductance stabilized cell membrane at the polarized potentials: TASK R40A main-tained cell membranes at À60.3 5 3.2 mV (ÀVpu) and À55.2 5 2.9 mV (þVpu). But for TASK-1 and TASK AQA , their cell potentials were depolarized 10-20 mV from À60 mV upon Vpu coexpression (Fig. 2 C) . Nonetheless, their potentials remained more polarized than those cells bearing little or no background K þ conductance (i.e., À45 mV vs. À20 mV for TASK R38A -expressing cells). These differences in membrane potentials (Dj) conceivably could account for the observed 50-60% release inhibition by TASK and TASK AQA , and the 80% inhibition by TASK R40A (Fig. 3) . Nonconducting TASK R38A did not FIGURE 2 Vpu differentially affects the channel activities of TASK and its three functionally distinct point mutants.

(B) Channel activities (NP o ) were determined from individual inside-out patches. *P < 0.05 vs. TASK-1; ns P > 0.05 vs. TASK R40A ; # P < 0.05 vs. TASK AQA . Data are expressed as the mean 5 SE from 10-15 cells per group. (C) Vpu exerted different degrees of inhibition on the membrane potentials of the cells expressing different TASK mutants. Reversal membrane potentials in a Ringer-like solution were determined from whole-cell recordings using a ramp protocol. Vpu depolarized TASK and TASK AQA -expressed cells (*P ¼ 0.01 vs. TASK alone; # P ¼ 0.008 vs. TASK AQA alone), but not TASK R38A or TASK R40A -expressed cells ( ns1 P ¼ 0.1 vs. TASK R38A alone; ns2 P ¼ 0.25 vs. TASK R40A alone). Nonfunctional TASK R38A did not alter the cell membrane potentials. Data are expressed as the mean 5 SE from seven to 31 cells per group. FIGURE 3 TASK and its three point mutants exert different degrees of inhibition on Vpu-mediated viral particle release. The effects of TASK and its mutants on particle release were compared with the single expression of HIV-1 proviral NL4-3 (set at 100%). TASK R40A inhibited HIV-1 release more substantially than TASK-1 (*P ¼ 0.036). Vpu-(NL4-3/Udel) represents the level of HIV-1 release lacking Vpu assistance. Data are expressed as the mean 5 SE from four to five independent experiments. Biophysical Journal 99(6) 1718-1725 impose such a voltage barrier against virus discharge (Figs. 2 and 3) . Thus, the efficiency of Vpu-mediate release was directly proportional to the degree of membrane potential depolarization (Fig. 4) . In various physiological processes, background K þ conductance stabilizes the electrochemical membrane potential and hence reduces excitability and secretion (30-33). Our results suggest that the process of HIV-1 release was similarly affected by Dj (Fig. 4) . To dissipate the restricting electric field across a budding membrane, Vpu probably acts like a membrane depolarizer that diminishes the stabilizing background K þ currents. Indeed, when heterologously expressed in IL-2-activated, human CD4þ T cells, Vpu induced 15-20 mV of membrane potential depolarization. This Vpu activity functionally resembled that of TASK siRNA in dissipating the endogenous background K þ conductance in T lymphocytes (34) : both were capable of depolarizing transmembrane potentials and reducing membrane sensitivity to extracellular K þ (Fig. 5) . Others have shown that Vpu heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes also inhibits K þ permeation (15) . Thus, the function of Vpu is intrinsically linked to its propensity to oligomerize destructively with endogenous K þ channel subunits such as TASK (8, 17) . Because Vpu coexpression did not alter the unitary current amplitudes of TASK or its mutants (Fig. 2 A) , its inhibitory activity did not involve the formation of dysfunctional K 2P -Vpu hybrid channels on the cell surface. Instead, Vpu probably inhibited by reducing the number of functional background K þ channels on the plasma membrane, and this process likely took place intracellularly. Because Vpu is a connector to the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway, it is capable of accelerating degradation of interfering host proteins and channels (2, 8) . In this way, Vpu, and perhaps other viroporins as well, could remotely enhance virus discharge on the plasma membrane while being predominantly localized in the perinuclear regions (21, 35) . FIGURE 4 The efficiency of Vpu-mediated HIV-1 release is directly proportional to the degree of membrane potential depolarization. The plot combines data from Figs. 2 C and 3 and shows a direct relationship between residual cell potentials and HIV-1 release efficiencies. Each dot represents an averaged value. The observed relation can be dissected into two consecutive vectors: 1), membrane potential depolarization; and 2), release acceleration. As a proof of concept, we verified the direct involvement of Dj in HIV-1 release by manipulating membrane potentials. We adopted two methods to test the effects of depolarization on release. In the first approach, we depolarized cell potentials by knocking down the endogenous TASK channels in HeLa cells expressing vpu-inactivated HIV-1 (NL4-3/Udel), and found that this alone promoted viral release up to sevenfold (Fig. 6) . Knockdown of endogenous TASK1/3/5 elevated the rates of virus release more effectively in the absence of Vpu than in the presence of Vpu. Since HIV-1 particles are heterogeneous, the induced particles by membrane potential depolarization were also examined for infectivity. The viral particles released from the cells treated with TASK1/3/5 siRNA showed infectivity comparable to the particles from the cells treated with the nonspecific siRNA (Fig. S2) . Thus, depolarization-induced viral particles are functional. This result is reminiscent of an early finding that particles derived from vpu-inactivated HIV-1 NL4-3/Udel are as infectious as those derived from NL4-3 (28) , reinforcing the notion that membrane potential depolarization by either TASK siRNA or Vpu primarily affects the final fission step and not the earlier steps (e.g., packaging). In the second approach, we depolarized the cell membrane potential with high K þ culture media and observed whether HIV-1 release could be accelerated accordingly (as dissected in the two consecutive vectors in Fig. 4 (1 / 2) ). Cell culture media were replaced with depolarizing high K þ media 1 day after transfection with the HIV-1 proviral plasmids (NL4-3 versus NL4-3/Udel lacking vpu expression). In HeLa cells expressing NL4-3/Udel, high K þ -imposed depolarization enhanced virus release up to sevenfold (Fig. 7) . Depolarization-induced viral release was significantly less pronounced in the cells expressing complete HIV-1 (NL4-3) . The high-K þ effect was more evident in the absence of Vpu (Fig. 7) , pointing to an occlusive mechanism involving membrane potential depolarization. The results again support the notion that there exists a transmembrane voltage constraint for viral release that can be sufficiently dissipated by HIV-1 Vpu. To the extent that Vpu may form homo-oligomers, the channels thus formed may further attenuate Dj to promote viral fission and release (16, 17, 36) . In addition to the mechanism involving Dj presented here, BST2/tetherin was recently shown to be an important restriction factor for Vpu-mediated release (5, 6) . This discovery was based on earlier findings that the effect of Vpu on release enhancement is cell-type-dependent (37) . For example, the efficiency of viral release in HeLa and human CD4þ T cells is greatly enhanced by Vpu, whereas the efficiency in HEK-293T cells is Vpu-independent. Furthermore, because Vpu is capable of facilitating the release of widely divergent retroviruses, the mechanisms used by Vpu to promote release are likely intrinsic to various types of host cells (38) . Studies that examined differences in gene expression between Vpu-dependent (e.g., HeLa) and Vpu-independent (e.g., HEK-293T) cell lines showed that BST-2 is expressed in Vpu-dependent cells but not in Vpu-independent cells, and is an endogenous restricting factor against viral release (5, 6, 9) . It has been suggested that the rate of release in Vpu-independent (permissive) cells is not affected by Vpu expression because their endogenous BST-2 is too low to counteract Vpu effectively to limit the release. In contrast, in Vpu-dependent (restrictive) cells, viral release is limited in the absence of Vpu due to the comparably higher endogenous BST-2 levels. However, the protective effect of endogenous BST-2 in the restrictive cells can be diminished by Vpu expression, which allows acceleration of viral release (5) . Of note, overexpression of BST-2 in the permissive HEK-293T cells can induce massive retention of the NL4-3/Udel virions on the cell surface, thereby changing HEK-293T cells from Vpu-independent to Vpu-dependent (5) . It has been proposed that Vpu antagonizes BST-2 by accelerating degradation of BST-2 through its interaction with bTrCP and other components of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system (39, 40) . Thus, whether a cell type is permissive or restrictive appears to be influenced by the expression levels of the endogenous restriction factors. This notion also fits our mutant data, in which the degree of release enhancement by Vpu was directly proportional to the magnitude of inhibition Vpu imposed on background K þ conductance (Fig. 4) . To integrate the BST-2 model with the proposed depolarization mechanism, we investigated whether the effects of background K 2P channel activities on HIV-1 release were also cell-type-dependent. We first determined the endogenous TASK levels in HEK-293 (permissive) versus HeLa (restrictive) cells, and then assessed their impact on Vpumediated release. Current clamp experiments revealed that HeLa cells had more polarized resting membrane potentials than did HEK-293 cells (Fig. 8 A) . Based on the degrees of membrane potential depolarization by TASK siRNA, HeLa cells expressed significantly more TASK than HEK-293 cells (Fig. 8 A) . Knockdown of endogenous TASK depolarized both cell lines to similar voltages, indicating that TASK1/3/5 channels were primarily responsible for setting cell membrane potentials in these cell lines (Fig. 8 A) . Because HEK-293 cells expressed smaller background K þ conductance than HeLa cells, they were likely to impose smaller restricting Dj on particle release. Indeed, membrane potential depolarization induced by elevated [K þ ] out enhanced NL4-3/Udel release up to 2.5-fold in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 8 B) , and the enhancement was not as large as in HeLa cells (Fig. 7) . On the other hand, release enhancement by depolarization was much smaller (&50%) in the presence of Vpu for both cell lines (Figs. 7 and 8 B) , again suggesting depolarization as a triggering mechanism for Vpu-mediated release. Because elevation of extracellular K þ drove different cells to the same depolarized potentials, particle release from HEK-293 cells, which had smaller restricting Dj, was affected less by depolarization than release from HeLa cells (Figs. 7 and 8 B) . A comparison of the results from HEK-293 versus HeLa cells (Figs. 7 and 8) shows that their different degrees of NL4-3/Udel release enhancement by depolarization reflect the different degrees of membrane potential polarization (or, in essence, TASK expression) of the two cell lines. Conceivably, the size of background K þ conductance could also help determine whether a particular cell type is permissive or restrictive. How do the two proposed mechanisms (membrane potential depolarization and tetherin/tethering) fit into the release process mediated by Vpu? To ascertain whether the two mechanisms are linked at the protein level, we sought to determine whether the endogenous expressions of TASK and BST-2 were correlated. Knockdown of endogenous TASK did not affect the protein level of BST-2 in HeLa cells, indicating that the endogenous levels of TASK and BST-2 were independent of each other (Fig. S3) . Moreover, BST-2 was not expressed in HEK-293 cells at all (Fig. S3) , whereas TASK channels were expressed in both HEK-293 and HeLa cells, with a higher level in the latter (Fig. 8 A) . The endogenous expression of TASK channels in HEK-293 cells allowed viral release to be enhanced by depolarization through high K þ media (Fig. 8 A) or TASK knockdown (data not shown). Therefore, the mechanisms used by BST-2 and TASK to counteract Vpu-mediated release were independent of each other. The mechanisms of Vpu-mediated release involve at least these two independent physical parameters: 1), Dj Biophysical Journal 99(6) 1718-1725 elimination (noncontact); and 2), contact/tethering. TASK channels, and perhaps other background K þ channels as well, stabilize the electric field across a budding membrane, thereby counteracting Vpu-induced depolarization in a noncontact fashion. In comparison, BST-2 is proposed to bind both the viral and the host cell membranes, thereby restricting viral release through direct physical contact (5) . Because electric potential and contact/tethering have distinct physical properties, these two types of barriers are expected to play important roles during different stages of Vpu-mediated release. Before fission is completed, the viral and the cell membranes are continuous. Any significant changes in the membrane potentials of the host cells (such as depolarization, as presented here) could affect the fission process. Upon completion of virus-cell fission, their membranes become separate, so Dj in the host cells no longer has any impact on the viruses. After membrane fission, according to the tetherin/tethering model, endogenous BST-2/tetherin physically links the viral and the host cell membranes to prevent particle egress.
