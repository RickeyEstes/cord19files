Fifty-eight (22.9%) stool samples from 253 diarrheic calves contained toxins, 64 (25.3%) yielded isolates of C. difficile (Table 1) and 94 (37.2%) were positive by either method (Table 2) . Chi-square analysis revealed a significant ( p < 0.05) effect of bacteriologic culture results on toxin detection results; culture positive samples were more likely to be toxin positive (26 of 44, 40.6%) and culture negative samples were more commonly toxin negative (Table 1) . Only 16.9% (32 of 189) of culture negative calves were toxin positive (data not shown). Toxin negativity at any given sampling time is not uncommon in humans with CDAD (DelmÃ©e et al., 2005) , and these results in calves could reflect a similar situation. We have since developed improved methods for isolation of C. difficile from feces (Michael Anderson, Christine Coursodon, Michael Hailey, and J. Glenn Songer, unpublished results), and use of these may bring toxin detection and bacteriologic culture results more into agreement. Toxin positives were no more common among diarrheic calves than among nondiarrheic animals, but the former were more likely to be culture positive (Table 2 ). This nearly twofold higher rate of infection in diarrheic calves was not surprising, but the substantial rate of toxin positivity in nondiarrheic calves was unanticipated. Some nondiarrheic animals may have been incubating an infection, although only one diarrheic calf was observed in the source herd for nondiarrheic animals during the 4-month sampling period. Regardless, toxin positivity (accompanied by typhlocolitis) is not uncommon in nondiarrheic piglets (Songer, 2005) , and this may apply to calves, as well. The rate of C. difficile isolation from diarrheic calves in this work was higher overall than that reported by Rodriguez-Palacios et al. (2006) (25.3% versus 7.6%). Rates of isolation from nondiarrheic calves were nearly identical (12.7% versus 14.9%). In contrast, the rate of toxin detection by these workers in diarrheic calves was substantially higher than our findings (22.9% versus 39.6%); toxin detection in nondiarrheic calves was more common in the work reported here (30.2% versus 20.9%). The reasons for these discrepancies are not immediately apparent. tcdA and tcdB were present in all isolates (n = 71). Ribotype 078 was dominant among a randomly selected group of strains (31/33, 94%), to a greater extent even than in neonatal pig strains (Keel et al., 2007) . This ribotype is also isolated from human CDAD, often in the form of community-associated disease, which is apparently experiencing a remarkable exponential rise in incidence (Beaugerie et al., 2003; Hirschhorn et al., 1994; Levy et al., 2000) . Cases are typically in young patients (average 26 years) with no exposure to antimicrobial agents for !3 months before onset (Hirschhorn et al., 1994; Levy et al., 2000; Rexach et al., 2006) . Ribotype 002 (1/33, 3%) is uncommon in humans (JS Brazier, personal communication) and in pigs ($4%; unpublished data), but more common in a small sample (n = 20) of equine isolates (15%; unpublished data). Ribotype 033 (1/33, 3%) is also uncommon in humans (JS Brazier, personal communication) and has not been reported in food animals other than calves. Salmonella sp. was isolated from 18 of 253 (7.1%) samples from diarrheic calves and from 3 of 53 (5.7%) samples from nondiarrheic animals, a difference which was not statistically significant ( p $ 0.6; data not shown). The rate of isolation from toxin or culture positive calves was not significantly different from that in negative calves ( (100) Results of bacteriologic culture are significantly associated with outcome of toxin testing ( p < 0.05). . These data on co-infecting agents are limited, and are perhaps best viewed as providing a basis for hypotheses on which to plan future experimental work. A limited number of specimens (n = 60; 23 from diarrheic calves, 37 from nondiarrheic calves) were examined for presence of coronavirus, rotavirus, Cryptosporidium sp., and Giardia sp. Prevalence rates for coronavirus and Cryptosporidium sp. were substantially higher in nondiarrheic calves than in diarrheic (Table 4 ; p = 0.001), but differences in rates of rotavirus and Giardia sp. detection were not significant. The impact of these figures is lessened by the small number of observations in some cells (e.g., Giardia sp.). Among stools from nondiarrheic calves, those testing positive for toxins were most likely to contain the viral and protozoal pathogens (data not shown). Only two toxin positive samples from diarrheic calves tested positive for any of these four pathogens (one for Crytptosporidium sp. and one for Giardia sp.) and only five toxin negative samples from diarrheic calves tested positive (one for coronavirus and rotavirus, two for Cryptosporidium sp., and one for Giardia sp.). C. difficile culture positive specimens also containing these additional pathogens were rare (four from nondiarrheic calves, none from diarrheic). Among culture negative samples, additional agents were uncommon in stools from diarrheic calves (1-3 positives in 23 samples), but 30.3% (10/33) and 60.6% (20/33) of samples from nondiarrheic calves were positive for coronavirus and Cryptosporidium sp., respectively. C. difficile-positive specimens (by culture and/or toxin detection) were no more likely to be positive for any of these pathogens than C. difficile-negative specimens. Our results are somewhat different than those in a case: control study (Rodriguez-Palacios et al., 2006) which suggested that frequent demonstration of Cryptosporidium sp. in diarrheic calves did not confound a conclusion that C. difficile caused the diarrhea. Among specimens tested for all seven pathogens, six (two from diarrheic calves and four from nondiarrheic) were toxin positive and negative for all other pathogens; one specimen (from a Numbers with different letters are significantly different ( p < 0.005). a C. difficile or toxins detected. b Neither C. difficile nor toxins detected. Table 4 Specimens from diarrheic and nondiarrheic calves and positive in assays for viruses and protozoan parasites Agent Diarrheic (n = 23), pos (%) Nondiarrheic (n = 37), pos (%) All calves (n = 60), pos (%) Coronavirus 2 (8.7) a 11 (29.7) b 13 (21.77) Rotavirus 2 (8.7) a 4 (10.8) a 6 (10) Cryptosporidium sp. 3 (13) a 21 (56.8) c 24 (40) Giardia sp. 1 (4.4) a 3 (8.1) a 4 (6.7) Numbers with different letters are significantly different. nondiarrheic calf) was culture positive and negative for the others. Thus, the general trend is toward higher rates of these pathogens (with the possible exception of Giardia sp.) in C. difficile-positive calves. However, these data are limited in scope and support no firm conclusions, but suggest both the need and a direction for further study. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of antimicrobials for calf isolates were somewhat lower than those for swine isolates (Table 5 ; Post and Songer, 2004) . MICs for control strains were within limits prescribed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (Benning and Mathers, 1999; National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, 2001) . Others have reported in vitro anticlostridial activity of tylosin (Dutta et al., 1983) , and our findings concur; MICs 50 for erythromycin, tilmicosin, and tylosin were relatively low (0.25-0.50 mg/mL). Lack of bimodal distribution of susceptibility to erythromycin and tylosin suggests that erythromycin resistance elements encountered in strains from other species (Dzink and Bartlett, 1980; Delmee and Avesani, 1988; Farrow et al., 2001; Post and Songer, 2004) may be rare in this population. Human strains vary widely in susceptibility to tetracycline (Dzink and Bartlett, 1980; Delmee and Avesani, 1988) , but with the exception of a single outlier (susceptible at 0.125 mg/mL), these calf strains were susceptible only at 8-16 mg/mL. The low MIC 90 for virginiamycin (0.125 mg/mL) suggests that these strains may be susceptible in vivo, in contrast to strains from pigs, for which the MIC 90 was 16 mg/mL (Post and Songer, 2004) . Bacitracin had little activity against calf strains (MIC 90 64 mg/mL), in keeping with results for human, porcine, and equine strains (Jang et al., 1997; Citron et al., 2001; Post and Songer, 2004) . High MICs reported for cephalosporins (Dzink and Bartlett, 1980; Chow et al., 1985; Post and Songer, 2004 ) mirror our results for ceftiofur (MIC 90 128 mg/mL). Positive clinical outcomes seem unlikely for agents with an MIC higher than recommended doses. Microscopic examination of intestines of calves whose diarrheic stools were strongly toxin positive revealed villous degeneration in the jejunum and ileum and superficial mucosal erosion in the colon. Eroded areas had associated fibrinous exudates. Inflammatory infiltrates varied, but neutrophils and eosinophils infiltrated lamina propria in the jejunum, ileum and colon. Distended crypts in the colon contained degenerate epithelial cells and neutrophils, in keeping with findings in other species (Keel and Songer, 2006) . Large Gram-positive rods morphologically compatible with C. difficile were abundant in both the proximal and the distal colonic lumen, and the organism was isolated by bacteriologic culture. Toxins were found in the ileum and throughout the colon. Based upon these findings and precedent in other species, bovine neonatal CDAD should affect mainly the cecum and the colon (Keel and Songer, 2006) , but we examined effects of TcdA and TcdB on small intestine, as well. Inoculation of a duodenal loop with TcdA led to luminal accumulation of neutrophils, and fibrin associated with moderate numbers of sloughed, necrotic epithelial cells; hemorrhage and edema occurred in the lamina propria. Superficial mucosal erosions and neutrophil infiltration occurred in the jejunal, ileal, and colonic mucosa. Mucus, fibrin, neutrophils, and sloughed epithelial cells accumulated in the lumen of a loop in mid-spiral colon (Table 6) . Lesions in loops inoculated with TcdB were somewhat more severe, and included multifocal, ulcerative enteritis in the duodenum and the jejunum, marked villous necrosis in the ileum, and neutrophil infiltration into the small intestinal mucosa. Epithelium in a loop in upper spiral colon was hemorrhagic and necrotic, and neutrophils and lymphocytes infiltrated lacteals. The mid-colonic loop was hemorrhagic; deep ulceration extended to the muscularis mucosa, with mild infiltration by and exudation of neutrophils near ulcers (Table 6) . Mucosal lesions in loops exposed to both toxins were similar to those observed with individual toxins, but severe villous necrosis occurred in the duodenum and the ileum. Peyer's patch-associated lacteals in the jejunum were distended and contained lymphocytes; fewer neutrophils were noted than with individual toxins. Ileal mucosa was edematous, and inflammatory cells, including eosinophils, were found in the lamina propria. The loop in the upper spiral colon had deep mucosal erosions with hemorrhage and accumulation of mucus and cellular debris. The mucosal surface in the mid-colonic loop was necrotic, with vacuolation and some loss of supporting lamina propria. Mucus and cellular debris accumulated in the intestinal lumen, and inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, infiltrated into the submucosa. Weight:length relationships were calculated for control and principal loops and these were then compared (control: principal) to determine the ratios presented in Table 6 . Gross examination revealed no fluid accumulation in control loops, but TcdA and TcdB caused fluid accumulation in loops in the jejunum, the ileum, and the colon; TcdA and TcdB inoculated together produced similar effects in the ileum and the colon only. Detection of toxins in the colon in field cases and fluid accumulation in response to TcdA and TcdB intoxication in colonic loops suggests that the diarrheagenic mechanism is toxin-based. Further study will be required to elucidate specific events linking intoxication and fluid secretion. Results of the work reported here, in company with that of Rodriguez-Palacios et al. (2006) , support a working hypothesis that C. difficile infection and the accompanying intoxication can manifest as diarrhea in calves. C. difficile and its toxins were found in both diarrheic and nondiarrheic calves, and toxin positive diarrheic calves had enteric lesions. Purified TcdA and TcdB caused tissue damage, fluid accumulation, and neutrophil infiltration, suggesting that in vivo toxin production may lead to development of similar lesions. In -Palacios et al., 2007) became colonized, but neither toxins nor signs of enteric disease were detected. Further work with experimental inoculation, under various conditions, will be required to conclusively establish C. difficile as an etiologic agent. However, it is reasonable to conclude that calves may serve, at the very least, as multiplying hosts for this organism.
