Highlighted use cases describe the identification of top producer cell lines, decision making support, bioreactor data management, and full clone history report documentation (Fig. 1 ). Genedata Bioprocess, which was developed in collaboration with top pharmaceutical companies, can flexibly support various (non-linear) workflows and structure the collected information in a way that fosters collaboration across an organization. While increasing throughput is crucial to ensure the timely availability of optimal producer cell lines, high-throughput is only possible when automated processes in the laboratory and the resulting data collection and aggregation can be streamlined. Genedata Bioprocess helps to establish more productive processes by offering support and integration for automation stations and measurement devices. Thanks to the comprehensive workflow support and the possibility to integrate results from cell line stability experiments, product quality assessment, and bioreactor suitability tests, Genedata Bioprocess provides a unique way to evaluate cell lines. Comprehensive analysis of all data collected in the process helps to ensure the highest possible quality and minimize the time and resources needed for data analysis and management. Integration of bioreactor data analysis and visualization with other parameters measured in cell line development, streamlines clone evaluation in micro-bioreactors and supports highthroughput operations. Genedata Bioprocess comprehensively tracks the full clone history from the origin of the host cell line to the generation of the validated monoclonal producer cell line. For promising clones, the clone history report can be generated with one click. Besides supporting cell line development, Genedata Bioprocess is a comprehensive platform capable of tracking the complete bioprocess development process. Both basal and feed-spiked processes lasted for seven days with viabilities above 95% until Day 6. On day seven, a sharp decline in viability indicated the end of the batch process (Fig. 1a) . In feed-spiked medium, cells initially grew slower but reached almost twice as high peak cell concentrations (17.6 × 10 6 c/mL) than in basal medium only (9.79 × 10 6 c/mL). Remarkably, the integral of the viable cell concentration over the total process time (viable cumulative cell days [VCCD] ) was similar between both process strategies (Fig. 1c) . While mAb production plateaued after Day 4 in basal medium only (final titer 0.8 g/L), a continuous increase to three-fold higher final titers (2.4 g/L) was observed in feed-spiked medium (Fig. 1b) . The higher titers could be attributed to generally higher cell-specific productivities (qP), which remained rather constant (~70 pg/cell/day) in feedspiked cultures. In basal medium, the qP continuously dropped by 20% (Day 0 to 3), 50% (Day 4), and > 90% (Day 5 to 7) from 70 to 10 pg/cell/day in basal medium cultures. In average, the qP was 70% higher in feed-spiked cultures (Fig. 1d ). Transcriptome analysis of differentially expressed genes between cells grown in basal medium or feed-spiked medium were used to identify relevant GO terms that indicated a more active proliferative state for feed-spiked cultures (data not shown). The top GO terms significantly related to cell cycle and primary metabolism, cellular division, as well as nucleobase formation or regulation. Furthermore, GSEA revealed several significantly enriched set of genes related to gene transcription, DNA replication and repair, cell growth and proliferation, as well as inhibition of apoptosis in feed-spiked cultures. Thus, feed-spiking increased the proliferative activity of cultivated cells. Several of the identified genes appear as promising targets for cell line engineering, but have not yet been described in relation to high-producing recombinant cell lines and will need to be evaluated in future studies. In this study we established that the Tecan can be used as a robust platform for purification at small scale. We observed similar purification yields, intra and inter run. The analysis of the PQA1a level showed there is also very high reproducibility. And the pH of the eluate showed as well strong comparability as well. Table 1 shows the coefficient of variation (CV) of the yield, HMWS and eluate pH are low, demonstrating the good reproducibility of the purification. The strong reproducibility obtained between the different purifications showed that the Tecan and the AktaXpress are similar in terms of purification performance and PQA (Fig. 1a, b) . The Tecan is a versatile automated liquid handler allowing the screening of huge purification conditions (Fig. 1c) , the possibility to purify large quantities of samples, while the samples amount is limited. The Tecan has the potential to purify more than 150 samples/day, reducing timelines and allowing us to deliver faster to the patients. With a concentration range up to 40x10 6 cells/ml ( Fig. 1) and viability range at 75-100%, we obtained a correlation factor of 0.98 between the two compared methods. The large field of view allows the analyze of several thousand cells within a single image, keeping the statistical variability of the measure as low as 3%. Our measurement chamber prototype has demonstarted its capability for continuous Viable Cell Density and viability monitoring. We are now working at designing a steam strerilizable probe, and we envision Lensless Imaging to become the future method of choice for on-line monitoring of suspension cells cultures. The antennarity of the glycans is quite stable in all production phases. The degree of core fucosylation is very high in all products. A low fucosylation degree of antibodies may be favorable for a higher ADCC performance [2] . Some of the products showed an antennary fucosylation, which seemed to change not very much in different cultivation phases. Nevertheless, this might be an issue due to an antigenic impact in the patient. The antennary galactosylation changes noticeable for the antibody and α1-Antitrypsin. In both cases the degree is highest in the first phase. An incomplete galactosylation leads to truncated glycans. This leads inevitable to undersialylated antennas to be seen for α1-Antitrypsin. The sialylation is the highest in the early phases and decreases during cultivation time. Sialylation of a therapeutical protein is important for the half-life in the patient. Therefore highly sialylated products are desired [3] . In further studies the consistency of the galactosylation and the sialylation will investigated for fed batch and long term continuous cultures in comparison to batch cultures. Due to the feed solution or the fresh media being present during such processes, the supply situation should be excellent for the whole cultivation time. The differences between the MALDI-ToF and HILIC-FLD data originate from complex and unresolved chromatograms (Fig. 1b , chromatograms not shown). For that reason coupling of HILIC-FLD and MS is very much recommended. Background Novel biologics are often selected from a large library of lead candidates in the initial stage of preclinical and clinical developments. For this selection, there is a demand for high-throughput production of recombinant proteins of high quality and in sufficient quantity. Transient gene expression offers a rapid approach to the production of numerous recombinant proteins for the initial-stage developments of biologics. Mammalian cells are major host cells for transient gene expression, but they have the disadvantages of complicated operations and high cost of culture. Insect cells are easy to handle and can be grown to a high cell density in suspension with a serum-free medium. Insect cells can also produce large amount of recombinant proteins through post-translational processing and modifications of higher eukaryotes. Hence, insect cells have been recognized as an excellent platform for the production of functional recombinant proteins [1, 2] . In the present study, the production of an antibody Fab fragment through transient gene expression in lepidopteran insect cells was examined. Western blot analysis and ELISA of culture supernatants showed that transfected High Five cells secreted the Fab fragment with antigenbinding activity. In static cultures, transfection and culture conditions, such as Hc:Lc gene ratio, a serum-free medium, DNA:PEI ratio, and DNA amount per cell, were successfully optimized by flow cytometry of EGFP expression in transfected cells and the yield of the secreted Fab fragment measured by ELISA. The effects of culture temperature and initial cell density were also examined by comparing the cell growth and the production of Fab fragments in shake-flask cultures. Under optimal conditions (medium, PSFM-J1 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Japan); Hc:Lc gene ratio, 3:7; DNA, 5 μg/(10 6 cells); PEI, 10 μg/(10 6 cells); initial cell density, 1 x 10 6 cells/cm 3 ; temperature, 24°C), the yield of more than 100 mg/L of Fab fragment was achieved in 5 days in a shake-flask culture ( Fig. 1) . Transfection did not significantly affect the growth of High Five cells as compared with untransfected cells. Transient gene expression using insect cells may offer a promising approach to high-throughput production of candidate proteins for the development of biologics.  Highlighted use cases describe the selection of the best producer clones (Fig. 1a) , the identification of optimized media feeding strategies (Fig. 1b) , and the comparison of clone performance across different fermentation scales (Fig. 1c) . A special focus is on the analysis of data from micro-and bench-top bioreactors (such as the ambr15™ and DasGip™ systems) operated in parallel. These bioreactors allow for increased throughput of clone selection and process optimization studies, which in turn leads to an increase in data generation. Genedata Bioprocess supports integration with such systems and enables a comparison of data regardless of the instrument provider or scale. Automated bioreactor data analysis allows development groups to take advantage of even richer datasets and, as data management is built-in to the system, the data can be easily tracked and associated to historical records. Another focus is on cross-reactor scale comparisons. Data coming from different bioreactor scales can be easily imported into the platform and analyzed to establish the best conditions for upscaling. Genedata Bioprocess enables the correlation of process parameters (e.g., fermentation protocols, media recipes, bioreactor control parameters), with key performance indicators of the processes (e.g., Titer, qP) and the product quality attributes (e.g., aggregation, glycosylation profiles). Finally, bioreactor time course data can be tracked together with clone analytics and product quality parameters, which makes the platform uniquely able to support end-to-end biopharma development. Upstream bioprocesses are at particular risk of contamination from adventitious agents. The typical 0.1 μm filters used at this step protect bioreactors from bacteria and mycoplasma but offer no protection from viral contaminations. A new polyethersulfone (PES) upstream virus filter, Viresolve® Barrier, has demonstrated high levels of microorganism retention -full retention for bacteria and mycoplasma (>8.0 LRV -Log Reduction Value) and~5 LRV for small viruses, such as parvoviruses. It also has improved flow and capacity as compared to virus removal filters designed for monoclonal antibody purification. Given the small pore size of virus retentive filters, implementing a virus filter upstream of the bioreactor raises the question of whether critical cell culture media components are removed. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the cell culture performance and protein quality attributes using virus-filtered media to ensure that filtration does not negatively impact the process. Materials and methods EX-CELL® CHO media and corresponding feeds were processed through either Viresolve® Barrier filters or 0.22 μm filters (control). Media composition post-filtration was evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), inductively coupled plasma/ optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Recombinant CHO cells were cultured in fed batch culture. Cell density and viability were measured by Vi-Cell TM cell viability analyzer while metabolites were analyzed by BioProfile® FLEX analyzer. Shake flasks and bioreactors were utilized to verify that surfactants, such as poloxamer, (which are essential for shear protection in stirred tank bioreactors and can be difficult to filter) have not been removed during filtration. Monoclonal antibody titer was quantitated by Protein A HPLC. Characterization of the antibody product quality was assessed via weak cation-exchange chromatography (charge heterogeneity), size exclusion chromatography (aggregate profile), and 2-AB fluorescent labeling with NP-UPLC (glycan species). We implemented data structures and data handling systems, which mirror how these complex next-generation biologics molecules and cell lines are being designed, screened, and analyzed. The result successfully addresses workflows for TCR optimization and engineering. We exemplified this with the generation and evaluation of a panel of engineered TCRs with an alpha chain CDR3 randomization and successfully supported the analysis and selection of beneficial mutations. The system also successfully supported workflows for the design and generation of a panel of TCR-based bispecifics (TCR coupled with anti-CD3) using automated molecule registration and in silico cloning tools and subsequent capture of expression, purification, and functional and analytical characterization data. On the CAR-T cell front, the system is able to provide traceability of the work from antibody generation, optimization, CAR engineering (e.g., attachment to the scFv with CD3-zeta and co-stimulatory domains to mimic the natural TCR complex) to the engineering of the T-cell. The Genedata Biologics platform successfully enabled automation, increased data integrity and traceability during research and development work, and will contribute towards the industrialization of these very exciting novel approaches for cancer immunotherapy. Here, we present use cases showing how to identify and annotate liability sites prone to chemical modifications (Fig. 1a) and how to monitor CQAs of molecules allowing to assess developability more efficiently. We show how the analytical data generated in the course of a developability assessment are compiled to select the best drug candidate (Fig. 1b) . Implemented traffic-light systems indicate where molecules harbor issues such as in case of the antibody TPP-86, which is compromised by low temperature and repeated freeze-thaw operations. The same assessment views can also be applied on batches and cell lines. The underlying data can be visualized graphically. As an example, we show glycan types of products obtained from different cell line clones generated in a cell line development campaign for the molecule TPP-86 (Fig. 1c) . Even though the selected clone CLI-35 meets the glycosylation criteria (e. g., <13% afucosylation, <40% galactosylation, <2% sialylation), the produced Next-generation biologics molecules are composed from a number of specific subdomains. Each type of molecule is composed of a specific set of domains, which must be mirrored in the registration and further research and development workflow. Molecule registration and hit-selection using data from a number of assays is shown here using the example of CAR-T cells. The image is a screenshot from the Genedata Biologics™ software molecule harbors some stability issues as mentioned above. Therefore, more attempts would be needed either in formulation or in reengineering of the complimentarity determining regions (CDRs) in order to provide a developable TTP-86-like drug candidate. Background Environmental process variables are often used as tools to optimize the performance of mammalian cell cultures to achieve higher cell densities and high productivities of r-proteins (q P ). The manipulation of culture temperature in the range of mild hypothermia (MH) (35-30°C) [1, 2] , as well as different glucose availability scenarios [3, 4] , has been shown to improve productivity in different cell lines. However, the manipulation of these variables individually or together has a concomitant effect on the rate at which cells grow, masking the net response exhibited by the cells. In order to identify the effects of these variables, we have taken advantage of the use of the chemostat culture. The Utility Functions led to discrete agitation rates where not only homogeneous mixing but also a turbulent flow pattern and a suitable specific power input was guaranteed. The initial gassing rate of air supplied enough oxygen for 5 x 10 6 cells/mL in all bioreactors. Due to the used scaling methods the growth patterns in all bioreactor scales were comparable. Peak viable cell densities (VCD) of 20 -26 x 10 6 cells/mL were achieved and viability at the point of harvest was above 80 % in all scales. The final product concentration was in an acceptable range of 2.9 -3.6 g/L. Product quality attributes show comparability over the complete bioreactor range (Fig. 1) . The harvest criteria of 12 days gave a combination of viability and product concentration that made it easy to process the cell broth during cell removal and other downstream steps. After the adaptation process, suspension cultures without aggregates or clumps were obtained, with the same specific growth rate. A lower maximum cell density with the RVPM was reached, achieving 5x10 6 cells.ml -1 , compared with the SFM that reach cell densities between 8 and 9x10 6 cells.ml -1 in batch mode. The specific RV-VLPs productivity per cell was maintained, obtaining values of 0.88 and 0.90 EU.10 6 cells -1 .day -1 for the clone being cultured in SFM and RVPM, respectively. Taking into account that this producer clone can be changed directly from one medium to the other without lag phase or cell damage, and that in RVPM the maximum cell density reached was lower, this medium was proposed to be analysed in high cell density in perfusion mode for a continuous culture in bioreactor. Therefore, we performed two cultures in parallel to compare the efficacy of each media formulation in perfusion. As shown in Fig. 1 , we obtained very similar culture performances in both bioreactors; 14.4 EU.ml -1 and 16.1 EU.ml -1 of RV-VLPs for the commercial SFM and RVPM, respectively. After that, the harvests were evaluated by the NIH potency test obtaining a rabies vaccine potency of 1.2 IU.ml -1 for both cultures (being 1 IU.ml -1 the minimum potency required for animal vaccine). Thus, the results obtained represent an interesting advance in the optimization of this vaccine production process since the use of this new medium formulation represents a reduction of 40% of the total cost which will be reflected in a considerable reduction of the price of the vaccine dose. Background Vaccines are one of the most powerful and effective health inventions ever developedproviding tremendous economic and societal value; yet several factors hinder comprehensive immunization coverage. Traditional methods of biologics production, based on stainless steel bioreactors, allow pharmaceutical companies to achieve economy of scale, but are limited by high capital expenditures. Such approaches stifle manufacturing innovation and lack long-term cost-effectiveness and sustainability. Current innovations can cut biologics' production costs to revolutionize the mainstream use of biologic treatments, focusing on developing fast, potent and cost-effective vaccine production. Univercells' mission to make biologics affordable to all initiated a paradigm shift, targeting an innovative single-use manufacturing platform incorporating bioprocess into continuous operations. Univercells employs process intensification, using high volumetric productivity bioreactors; and unit steps integration, coupling USP and DSP into continuous operations. The objective is a down-scaled high-productivity process for a cost-effective manufacturing solution. The resulting micro-facilities are easily-deployable in developing countries, breaking entry barriers to biomanufacturing (Fig. 1) . Manufacturing and distribution advancements, from centralized to distributed, foresee affordable treatments' obtainability via supplying local populations with local production units. The results at 21 days post-transfection and selection clearly indicate that the Rps3 UCOE®-gpCMV and -hCMV combinations give the highest transgene expression as shown in Fig. 1 . The A2UCOE®-hCMV/gpCMV constructs were the next efficacious but 2-fold lower than the Rps3 UCOE® vectors. The SFFV promoter linked with either of the two UCOE®s was the least effective with expression levels 17-fold lower than the Rps3-CMV constructs. The Rps3 UCOE®-gpCMV/hCMV constructs are now being further modified to include elements that will provide optimal post-transcriptional pre-mRNA processing (splicing, polyadenylation, transcription termination, mRNA stability) thereby maximising stable cytoplasmic transgene mRNA levels and protein production. In the last 20 years, growing number of innovator biologics and biosimilars have formed a competitive environment, where speed and efficiency of generating robust and highly productive cell lines needs to be improved continuously. Through various advances, especially in media development and process optimization, product titers as high as 10 g/L were achieved in the pharmaceutical industry (Kim et al., 2012) for standard products such as monoclonal antibodies. Nevertheless, other proteins e.g. bispecific antibodies, Fc-fusion proteins or Fab-related products are difficult-to-express (DTE) in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) and may result in delays or even in termination of the cell line development process. We developed a new robust pool generation approach (CLD 2.0) addressing both, easy-and difficult-to-express molecules, while reducing timelines down to 5 months (CLD standard = 6 months), improving reliability of cell line development as well as clearly increasing obtained titers. The amount of IgG3 in the supernatant increased until 4-6 h after the inhibition of protein synthesis by CHX; however, it hardly changed thereafter (Fig. 1, upper panel) . At this point in time, however, around 40% of IgG still remained in the cells (Fig. 1, lower panel) , meaning that all of the synthesized IgG could not be secreted into the medium and remained in the cells for several hours. This result was almost the same as that of studies using IgG1-expressing cells [5, 6] . The localization of IgG in the cells was checked before and after the addition of CHX, with the results showing that IgG1 remained in the ER and was hardly seen in the Golgi apparatus [5] [6] [7] ; IgG did not seem to be efficiently transported to the Golgi apparatus. The SEC experiment showed that most of the IgG1 remaining in the cell seemed to form full-sized antibodies [5, 6] , but it could not be secreted despite this. High-chromosome-number CHO cells showed larger cell diameters, as determined by Vi-cell (Beckman Coulter) measurement. The predicted volume ratios, based on these diameters, are 2.24 (DG44-SC39:DG44-SC20) and 1.59 (IgG3-SC39:IgG3-SC20). The levels of β-actin and the products of most other genes that were detected by mRNA-seq differed by approximately 20% in the comparison between SC39 and SC20 (SC39 > SC20). Based on the analysis of gene expression levels per cell volume, approximately 90% of detected genes showed lower expression in both DG44-SC39 and IgG3-SC39 compared with the levels in DG44-SC20 and IgG3-SC20, respectively. In addition, the number of genes whose expression level was decreased in IgG3-SC39 compared with that in DG44-SC39 was larger than those showing the opposite pattern. The results of the comparisons between IgG3-SC20 and IgG3-SC39 indicate that differentially expressed genes were mainly related to cell growth (e.g. Myc, SMAD), apoptosis (e.g. Caspase), lipid metabolism (e.g. SREBP, PPARγ) and epigenetic histone modification (e.g. BRCA, HAT) pathways. The mRNA levels of Myc, SMAD, Caspase, BRCA and HAT related genes were lower in IgG3-SC39, while those of SREBP and PPARγ related genes were higher in IgG3-SC39. The effects of these pathways on antibody production should be examined in future. Jetcutter technology allowed us to obtain alginate microcarriers with a good homogeneity in size around 200 μm and sphericity comparable to commercial carriers (Table 1) . Best adhesion of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells was obtained on 0,1% gelatine coated alginate carriers (Fig. 1) . We observed limited apoptosis and human adipose-derived mesenchymal cells stemness was conserved after 14 days in culture (data not shown).
