In the first step we prepared the H5 HA extracellular domain in insect cells as previously described with removal of the foldon-histidine tag at the C-terminus and full cleavage of HA0 to HA1-HA2 by furin (Antanasijevic et al., 2014) . In the next step, HA was crystallized under conditions of an intermediate pH (100 mM cacodylate buffer/pH 6.5 + 200 mM NaCl + 2 M (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 + 10% glycerol). To learn more about the nature of the prefusion pH states, crystals obtained at pH 6.5 were soaked in cryo solutions of identical chemical composition, differing only in the final pH (pH 7.0, 6.5, 6.0 and 5.5). Note that the buffering range of cacodylic acid (pH~5-7) makes it ideally suitable for studying the pH range of interest. Following a 10 min incubation time in different cryo solutions, the crystals were frozen. Data acquisition and processing were performed as described in the Materials and Methods section and the final statistics are shown in Table 1 . For clarity, structures will be referred to according to the pH of the cryo solution applied. Accordingly, the structures for H5 HA at pH 5.5, 6.0, 6.5 and 7.0 were solved at 2.30, 2.11, 2.39 and 2.79 Å resolution, respectively. Overall, the 4 structures are found to be very similar. For example, the RMSD of the H5 HA backbone is~0.23 Å between the pH 7.0 and 5.5 structures. However, as shown in Fig. 1 (and Supplementary Figure  S1 ) an in depth comparison of the 4 structures reveals evidence of one important pH-sensitive effect, which involved a pair of conserved histidines found at the interface between the HA1 and HA2 subunits (and also in close proximity to the fusion peptide). At pH 7.0 HA1-H18 is forming a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl of HA2-M16. This interaction positions the imidazole ring of HA1-H18 towards the HA1-H38 side chain. In the pH 6.0 and pH 5.5 structures, a~120°r otation of the HA1-H38 side-chain around the C α -C β bond (i.e. the Chi1 dihedral) is observed. Thus at the lower pH values the HA1-H38 side chain now faces away from HA1-H18 side chain. At lower pH the side chain of HA1-H38 is stabilized in the new conformation via an electrostatic interaction with the HA1-E24 carboxyl group (i.e. a stabilizing cation-anion interaction). Additionally, the increase in positive charge of this site at low pH attracts a negatively charged sulfate group (from the cryo solution). Importantly, the structure at pH 6.5 captures both states of the histidine in this transition. Specifically, the side chain of HA1-H38 exists in two conformers (facing towards and away from HA1-H18) with~50% occupancy. The protonation of HA histidine residues is thought to be one of the triggers for the large conformational changes necessary for fusion of the viral and target membranes (Zhou et al., 2014; Xu and Wilson, 2011; Mair et al., 2014) . Notably histidines can participate in stabilizing cation-anion and destabilizing cation-cation interactions in proteins (Harrison et al., 2013) . Importantly, the kinetic barrier for the transformation of HA prefusion conformation to intermediate and postfusion states would be lowered by destabilizing cation-cation interactions (Harrison et al., 2013) . Although this work used crystals crystallized in the same condition and only exposed to differing pH conditions after formation, we were still able to find one striking change in the conformation of H5 HA between pH 5.5-7.0: the side chain interactions between HA1-18 and HA1-H38. As shown by Fig. 2a , the HA1-H18 and HA1-H38 pair brings together 2 discreet regions that are in close proximity to the stem loop, which becomes helical at low pH, and the fusion peptide, which inserts into the endosome membrane (Skehel and Wiley, 2000; Eckert and Kim, 2001) . Notably, at neutral pH the closest approach of the histidine side chains is 4.7 Å. This is consistent with other conserved histidine pH sensor pairs found in other proteins, where the side chain separations are < 7 Å (Harrison et al., 2013) . We attribute the rotation of HA1-H38 at lower pH to be due to protonation of both histidines and the resulting cation-cation repulsion as modeled in Fig. 2b . However, an alternative explanation is that the rotation of HA1-H38 is driven by an attractive interaction with HA1-E24 (closest approach is 3.9 Å at pH 6.0) or some combination of cation-cation repulsion and cation-anion attraction. Our observation of the HA1-H38 in two conformations at pH 6.5 (Fig. 1) implies that the pK a of HA1-H38 and/or HA1-H18 is~6.5. Previous work has shown that the HA fusion peptide becomes more highly exposed and dynamic at lower pH (Garcia et al., 2015) . Thus we suggest that charge repulsion between the two histidines plays a role in the increased dynamics and solvent exposure of the region proximal to the fusion peptide. As shown by Fig. 2c, H18 and H38 (as well as an acidic amino acid at position 24) of the HA1 subunit are conserved in many Group 1 HA but not all, suggesting that alternative pH sensors are present in other HA. Nonetheless, we note that previous mutagenesis studies of HA1-H18 have suggested that this residue plays an important role in regulating the pH of virus fusion (Reed et al., 2009) . Moreover, MD studies have suggested that the neutralizing antibody CR6261 inhibits entry by lowering the HA1-H18 pK a by~1 unit (Zhou et al., 2014) . In addition, studies on species dependent sensitivity of HA subtypes to the neutralizing antibody C179 have suggested that HA1-H38 plays a critical role in sensitivity to this antibody (Doud et al., 2018) . Finally, we note that the irreversible transition of H5 HA to the postfusion form occurs at pH~5.4 (Galloway et al., 2013) . Consequently, the observations presented herein for pH > 5.4 clearly apply to the prefusion forms on the pathway toward the fusion conformation.
