The pair-wise receptor sequence similarities ( g S i,1 , g S i,2 , and g S i,3 ) between host-species pairs for each virus family are shown in Table 1 . For logical comparisons, each virus contains at least one infected host (the primary reservoir, designated as "#" in Table 1 ). As shown in Table 1 , the similarity scores for the infected group (g = 1) were high, ranging from 0.790 to 0.988 for 1 S i,1 , from 0.841 to 0.996 for 1 S i,2 , and 0.794 to 0.962 for 1 S i,3 . All pair-wise comparisons in group 1 (human vs. primary reservoir, primary reservoir vs. host, and human vs. host) yielded high similarity scores, indicating a high similarity among receptor sequences. The similarity scores were comparatively low in the non-infection group (g = 2), ranging from 0.092 to 0.440 for 2 S i,1 , from 0.108 to 0.432 for 2 S i,2 , and from 0.130 to 0.416 for 2 S i,3 . For group 2, both the primary host species and non-infected species are listed to illustrate the differences in similarity. In pair-wise comparisons, all the non-infection cases yielded low similarity values, i.e., the receptor sequences differed significantly from each other. We assume that a low similarity in receptor sequences disfavors infection despite the existence of a common receptor. For example, enterovirus infects only Sus scrofa (pig); it does not infect Rattus norvegicus (rat) or Homo sapiens (human) because of the high transmission barrier. Similarly, for leukovirus, only Gallus gallus (chicken) is infected as a primary reservoir; because of the high transmission barrier, R. norvegicus and H. sapiens are not infected. These results imply that for non-infection cases, species barriers exist, and the propensity to cross the barrier is determined by the sequence similarity between the potential and primary host receptors. Similarity scores for rabies virus were low between Canis lupus familiaris (domestic dog) and Bos Taurus (domestic cow) ( 2 S i,1 = 0.280, 2 S i,2 = 0.373, and 2 S i,3 = 0.366) and also between B. taurus and H. sapiens ( 2 S i,1 = 0.267, 2 S i,2 = 0.371, and 2 S i,3 = 0.416) but were high between C. l. familiaris and H. sapiens ( 1 S i,1 = 0.947, 1 S i,2 = 0.985, and 1 S i,3 = 0.962). Clearly, C. l. familiaris is the primary reservoir, and transmission of the disease to H. sapiens is possible only because of the high human/ dog receptor similarity. Thus, for particular viruses, transmission of disease may be species-selective, although common receptors exist among species. Furthermore, infection specificity may be determined by the species barrier, which results from receptor differences. The values in Table 1 are plotted in Figure 1 to illustrate the differences among groups. The x-and y-axes denote g S i,1 and g S i,2 , respectively, where "g" is the group classification. All pair-wise similarity scores are shown. Groups 1, 2 and 3 are each well separated in the colour-coded two-dimensional space. The results provide clear evidence that the receptor sequences from cases of cross-species infection are well separated from those of other infection cases. From these observations, we conclude that receptor differences are a major contributing factor to the potential of a specific viral strain to cross species barriers for transmission. In other words, the species dependence of infection is indirectly related to the receptor sequence similarity. This finding implies that once the receptor sequences of the primary reservoir and possible hosts are known, we might be able to predict the likelihood of viral disease transmission. The accuracy of these classifications can be judged Figure 1 Similarity scores of among groups. Three kinds of pairwise similarity scores ( g S i,1 , g S i,2 , g S i,3 ) are plotted in two dimensional space to show clear differences among groups. Groups 1, 2 and 3 are each well separated; the results show clearly that the receptor sequences from cases of cross-species infection are well distinguished from those of other infection cases. by subsequent assessment of cases of actual zoonotic transmission to humans. Our analysis revealed significant differences in receptor similarity between infection and non-infection cases. The similarity values, and the experimentally determined group categories were fed into a statistical discriminant analysis to logically predict infection (or zoonosis, in the case of human infection). As described in the Materials and Methods section, the values D i 2 (i = 1, 2, 3) were calculated from the data in the Table 1 to yield results of a specific discriminant analysis. The statistical discriminant analysis was verified using a test set of four viruses that were deliberately excluded from the training set. The viruses whose groups were predicted using the discriminant analysis are shown in Table 2 . The first virus, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), uses Felis catus (domestic cat) as its primary host and CD4 as its receptor. According to the literature [22, 23] , FIV infection of humans is rare but has been reported. Our method categorized this case as nearinfection (G = 3). The second virus, classical swine fever virus, is known to be non-zoonotic and was classified as such by our method (G = 2). Thirdly, the encephalomyocarditis virus infects S. scrofa but has been known to cause sporadic infections in H. sapiens; it was classified as group 1 (G = 1) by our method. Finally, the Lass virus is known to be zoonotic and was classified as group 1 (G = 1) by our method. In Table 2 , the hydrophilic similarity scores (S 1 ) show less consistency, comparing to the hydrophobic scores (S2), with the predictive values (G). From the result, it could be said that the hydrophobic characteristics of receptor sequence might be the key contributor to the prediction. However, this observation should only be carefully interpreted because the variables (S1, S2, S3) are complementary in the statistical process.
