Strain-specific Ia Induction ofAstrocytes by JHM Virus . Primary rat glial cultures produced from SDE-susceptible (Lewis and congenic Lewis .BN) and SDE-resistant (BN) rats were treated daily with wild-type JHM virus, and analyzed 5 d after infection . As shown in Fig . 1 , uninfected control Lewis glial cultures typically contained no la' cells ( Fig . I a) , but at 5 d after infection, la' astrocytes became Cell type Oligodendrocyte cultures were >90% positive for galactocerebroside, and astrocytes were >90% positive for Ran-2 antigen stained as described in Materials and Methods . detectable ( Fig. 1 b) , as previously reported (7, 8) . In contrast, in glial cultures derived from disease-resistant BN rats, la was never observed after infection ( Fig. 1 d) with JHM virus. However, infection of cultures of congenic Lewis.BN rats led to astrocyte la induction to the same levels seen in the Lewis rat (Fig. 1 , e and f). Therefore, responsiveness to JHM virus with respect to la induction is controlled by Lewis rat genes located outside the RT-1 locus, and perhaps is related to disease susceptibility of these animals (4). Class I Antigen Expression on Glial Cells. The induction of class I molecules on mouse glial cells by a virus related toJHM virus, coronavirus A59, has recently been reported (18) . In the rat, class I antigens were spontaneously expressed in high constitutive levels on numerous glial cells in control cultures (Fig. 2) , in agreement with others (19) . As shown in Table I , spontaneous induction of class I antigens on pure astrocyte cultures increased over time after plating. Likewise, purified rat oligodendrocytes became strongly class I antigen-positive within 18 h after plating, had increased positivity at 2 d, and were stainable at least 7 d after plating (Table I) . This indicates that pure rat oligodendrocytes rapidly become class I-positive by conditions associated with cultivation and also that soluble class I inducers originating from other cell types were not involved in the rat, as they are in the mouse (18) . With respect to possible enhanced expression of the existing levels of class I antigens as a result of infection (18) , Fig . 2 shows that control glial cellconditioned supernatants containing no JHM virus induced class I antigens on naive cultures (Fig. 2a) to the same degree as virus containing supernatants in Lewis (Fig. 2b) , BN (2c), and congenic Lewis.BN cultures (Fig. 2d) . Therefore, no increase in either the percentage or fluorescence intensity of class I antigenpositive cells could be attributed to JHM virus . The shift of the entire population of fluorescing cells to higher fluorescence intensity channels produced by conditioned supernatant is consistent with the enhancement of class I antigens primarily on spontaneously expressing cells (Fig. 2) . Strain-specific Induction ofIa Molecules by Muramyl Dipeptide. We have recently reported (8) the capacity of the bacterial immune adjuvant, muramyl dipeptide (adjuvant peptide) to induce la molecules on astrocytes in a manner identical to that seen with JHM virus . As presented in Table II , muramyl dipeptide induces astrocyte la in the same strain-specific pattern as does JHM virus . This gives a further indication that the inducibility of la antigens on astrocytes of diseasesusceptible animals compared with resistant animals is not dependent on any one viral or bacterial inducer but related to strain-specific regulation of la molecules expressed at the level of the astrocyte . In this report we have analyzed the effect of JHM virus on la and class I antigen expression on glial cells of different rat strains . We show that JHM virus induces astrocyte la expression in strains susceptible to JHM virus-induced demyelinating disease but not in a resistant strain . Expression of class I antigens was different in the sense that class I genes were expressed before and after infection . Moreover, the expression of class I-positive cells of all rat strains was not appreciably increased by JHM virus above already high levels seen on control glial cells. The similar la-inductive capacity seen between JHM virus and muramyl dipeptide might provide clues to the role ofJHM virus in eliciting autoimmune Medium Demyelination caused by JHM virus infection of Lewis rat brain is mediated by T lymphocytes sensitized to both myelin basic protein and viral antigens (1, 4) . According to our findings, the ability of brain cells to present antigen in the context of class I antigens would appear to be similar between strains, not differing in relation to genetically controlled susceptibility to demyelinating disease. However, the differing degree to which JHM virus induces la antigens on astrocytes in susceptible and resistant strains, as described here, would have a major influence on la-restricted T cell activation and tissue damage .
