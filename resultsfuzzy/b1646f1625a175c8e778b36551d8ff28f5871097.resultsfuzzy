The previously mentioned ICA modelling procedure was applied to model hotel occupancy rates. The dataset used in this study was the monthly hotel occupancy rates grouped by geographical districts of Hong Kong from January 1996 to Feb 2009 (http://partnernet.hktb.com/pnweb/jsp/comm/index.jsp), representing the available data during the research. The hotel occupancy rates series were collected from six geographical districts which are labelled from X1 to X6. This classification of Hong Kong hotels by districts was to follow the official system used by the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB). The historical hotel occupancy rates of these districts are plotted in Fig. 1 . The time series in Fig. 1 have clear seasonal fluctuations. Moreover, these time series exhibit similar trends and have some overlaps. The pair-wise correlation coefficients among these time series ranging from 0.75 to 0.96, suggesting that the hotel occupancy rates in different districts show a high degree of consistent directional tendency. However, modelling multivariate time series with high correlation is more difficult than univariate cases and may cause the problem of collinearity. As such, the FastICA algorithms were used to decompose multivariate time series into mutually independent time series, and subsequently employed the IC ordering method to rank the ICs based on their importance in prediction. After that, univariate time series models were used on each independent series. The order of computed ICs and the sum of variance of corresponding IC are shown in Table 1 . The sum of variance refers to the summation of variance in the original time series which can be explained by a particular IC. A larger value of sum of variance relates to a stronger overall prediction power of the IC. According to Table 1 , the 1st IC is clearly the dominant IC that needs to be further examined. The key statistics of the 1st IC are presented in Table 2 . Table 2 reveals that IC1 is the common 1st IC of the original time series concerned. It explains the largest proportion of variance in the data, meaning that the 1st IC has very strong prediction power on hotel occupancy rates. The practical meaning of the 1st IC was further analyzed. Since hotel occupancy rates were monthly data, it is necessary to remove the seasonal effects and smooth the trends of the influencing factor. A moving average model with window size of 12-month MA(12) was applied to the 1st IC and results were plotted in Fig. 2 . The x-axis represents the time horizon from 1996 to 2009 and the y-axis denotes the level of the time series. As indicated in Fig. 2 , the curve is fairly stable in most years with the exception of two significant concaves in periods 1997-1998 and 2003-2004 . The weightings of the mixing matrix for the 1st IC (influencing factor) are all positive (see Table 2 ). This implies that when the curve goes down, hotel occupancy rates will decrease. The very sharp decrease of the 1st influencing factor in 2003 clearly indicates the damage to the hotel industry in Hong Kong. Having reviewed records of important events in the years where drops were noticed, outbreaks of serious infectious diseases were found in Hong Kong. The following events were the epidemics in Hong Kong which are characterized by the time series in the lower panel of Fig. 2 (HKTA , 1999; HKTB, 2005) . The timetables of the occurrences of infectious diseases actually match the 1st IC. In other words, the practical meaning of the 1st influencing factor is the impact of infectious diseases on hotel occupancy rates.
