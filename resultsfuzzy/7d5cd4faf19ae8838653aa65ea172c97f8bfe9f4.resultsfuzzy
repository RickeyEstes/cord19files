PEDV-3CL pro crystallized in space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 as a dimer in the asymmetric unit ( Table 1) . As reported for both human coronavirus 229E 3CL pro and SARS-3CL pro , PEDV-3CL pro is a homodimer containing three domains in each monomer ( Fig. 1) 11, 12 . The active site of PEDV-3CL pro , which contains a catalytic dyad formed from residues Cys144 and His41, is located in a cleft between domains I and II (Fig. 1a) . Domain III is involved in monomer dimerization, which is ultimately responsible for forming the active protease ( Fig. 1a) 12, 13 . In the absence of substrate, water and solvent molecules (MPD, DMSO, and IPA) reside in the active site of PEDV-3CL pro , which is solvent exposed on one side (Fig. 1a,b) . Interestingly, different solvent molecules are found in the respective active sites of the PEDV-3CL pro monomers composing the PEDV-3CL pro dimer, where the a single DMSO molecule resides in the Chain A active site and the Chain B active site houses both isopropanol (IPA) and 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) (Fig. 1b) . The presence of different solvent molecules in each of the active sites of the dimer supports the assignment of one biological dimer in the asymmetric unit. Least-squares (LSQ) superposition of PEDV-3CL pro and the unbound form of human coronavirus 229E 3CL pro (PDB entry 1P9S) 12 , which are both from the same alpha-coronavirus phylogenetic group and share 69.3% sequence identity, resulted in an all-atom root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) value of 1.69 Å and a C-alpha RMSD value of 1.28 Å (Fig. 2a) . The LSQ superposition of 229E-3CL pro and PEDV-3CL pro shows that the overall architectures of both the 229E-3CL pro and PEDV-3CL pro active sites in their unbound states are structurally very similar, and the active site residues of the catalytic dyad, residues Cys144 and His41 in both PEDV-3CL pro and 229E-3CL pro , are located in almost identical structural space within the active site cavity, which is solvent exposed on one side (Fig. 2b) . In the absence of substrate, both water and non-water solvent molecules (dioxane in 229E-3CL pro and MPD, DMSO, and IPA in PEDV-3CL pro ) are found in the active site (Fig. 2b) . In order to better understand the features of the PEDV-3CL pro active site that are important in inhibitor and substrate binding, we generated an LSQ superposition of PEDV-3CL pro and an inhibitor-bound form of feline infectious peritonitis virus 3CL pro (FIPV-3CL pro , PDB entry 4ZRO), which belongs to the same alpha-coronavirus lineage as PEDV-3CL pro and has 61.9% sequence identity (Fig. 2c) 14 . LSQ superposition resulted in an all-atom RMSD value of 2.11 Å and a C-alpha RMSD value of 1.69 Å. We found the overall active site architectures of the unbound PEDV-3CL pro and the inhibitor-bound form of FIPV-3CL pro to be remarkably similar with the catalytic dyad residues (Cys144 and His41 in both FIPV-and PEDV-3CL pro ) in nearly identical orientations despite Cys144 of FIPV-3CL pro being covalently modified by the inhibitor, compound 6 ( Fig. 2d) . Interestingly, in both the superimpositions of PEDV-3CL pro with 229E-3CL pro and FIPV-3CL pro , the loops comprising the protease subsites of the 3CL pro active site are in nearly identical structural locations, with the exception of the loop that comprises the S 2 subsite, the S 2 loop. The S 2 loop forms the outer boundary of the S 2 binding pocket and shows positional variability across the X-ray structures of 229E-, FIPV-, and PEDV-3CL pro , which may lead to differences in the size of the S 2 subsites across 3CL pro 's ( Fig. 2b,d) . Our observations of the overall conserved structural features surrounding the PEDV-3CL pro catalytic dyad, but subtle differences in the overall active site architecture, made us curious as to whether one of the inhibitors we developed for SARS-3CL pro would also inhibit PEDV-3CL pro15 . SARS-3CL pro belongs to a different phylogenetic lineage than PEDV-3CL pro and shares lower sequence identity (45.4%) with PEDV-3CL pro ; however, we reasoned that the similar tertiary structure and conserved active site architecture of 3CL pro 's would allow for inhibition by the same molecule. We therefore tested the inhibition of PEDV-3CL pro by (R)-16, which was developed as a non-covalent inhibitor against SARS-3CL pro with potential broad-spectrum activity (Fig. 3a) 15 . We found (R)-16 to inhibit PEDV-3CL pro with an IC 50 value of 25.4 ± 1.4 μ M, where the representative curve for (R)-16 inhibition of PEDV-3CL pro is shown in Fig. 3a and the data for (R)-16 inhibition of SARS-3CL pro has been previously published 15 . The previously reported IC 50 of (R)-16 against SARS-3CL pro is 1.5 ± 0.3 μ M 15 , which indicates a ~17-fold weaker interaction of (R)-16 with PEDV-3CL pro . The inhibition of PEDV-3CL pro by (R)-16, though weak, is significant because it indicates that the development of non-covalent broad-spectrum inhibitors of 3CL pro 's may be possible. To gain structural insights into how (R)-16 may bind to PEDV-3CL pro , a structural alignment of the X-ray structure of SARS-3CL pro :(R)-16 complex with PEDV-3CL pro was generated (Fig. 3b ). LSQ superposition of unbound PEDV-3CL pro and inhibitor-bound SARS-3CL pro (PDB entry 3V3M) 15 , where PEDV-3CL pro is from the alpha-coronavirus phylogenetic group and SARS-3CL pro is from the beta-coronavirus phylogenetic subgroup 2b, resulted in an all-atom RMSD value of 5.18 Å and a C-alpha RMSD value of 4.98 Å. The structural alignment shows that, similarly to 229E-3CL pro and FIPV-3CL pro , the overall active site architectures of SARS-3CL pro and PEDV-3CL pro are largely similar despite their lower sequence identity ( Fig. 3b-d) , and the residues directly involved in binding to (R)-16 via hydrogen-bonding interactions are all conserved (Gly142 and His162 in PEDV-3CL pro and Gly143 and His163 in SARS-3CL pro , Fig. 3c,d) . The active sites of both SARS-3CL pro and PEDV-3CL pro are solvent exposed on one side with the residues of their catalytic dyads, His41 and Cys144 (for PEDV-3CL pro ) or Cys145 (for SARS-3CL pro ), located in almost identical structural space (Fig. 3c,d) . The superposition shows that (R)-16 similarly occupies the S 2 -S 1 ′ subpockets in each of the 3CL pro active sites, where the tert-butyl amide resides in the channel leading to the active site, the tert-butylanilido group (P 2 ) sits in the S 2 pocket, the 3-pyridyl group (P 1 ) resides in the S 1 region, and the tetrahydrofuran (P 1 ′ ) occupies the S 1 ′ subsite (Fig. 3c,d) . As shown in the SARS-3CL pro 3V3M structure, the 3-pyridyl nitrogen of (R)-16 acts as a hydrogen-bond acceptor for SARS-3CL pro His163, with a distance of 2.8 Å between PEDV-3CL pro is colored in orange and 229E-3CL pro is colored light pink.

This interaction is likely conserved in the inhibition of PEDV-3CL pro by (R)-16 as His162 of PEDV-3CL pro is in an almost identical structural location as that of SARS-3CL pro His163. Additionally, the bifurcated interaction between the furan ring oxygen and the amide carbonyl oxygen of (R)-16 and the backbone amide NH of SARS-3CL pro Gly143 is mimicked by PEDV-3CL pro Gly142 (Fig. 3d) . Though (R)-16 apparently binds in the same orientation in the PEDV-3CL pro active site as it does in the SARS-3CL pro active site, and likely utilizes the same hydrogen-bonding interactions, the IC 50 of (R)-16 against PEDV-3CL pro is 17-fold higher than against SARS-3CL pro . We were therefore curious if the difference in position of the S 2 loop between PEDV-and SARS-3CL pro may be important for (R)-16 binding. A structural alignment of the ligand-bound structures of FIPV-and SARS-3CL pro (4ZRO and 3V3M, respectively) shows that compounds 6 and (R)-16 bind to the respective 3CL pro 's by positioning their sterically bulky, hydrophobic groups in the S 2 subsite (leucine and t-butylanilido, respectively; Fig. 4a ). This suggests that hydrophobic interactions between the inhibitor or substrate and residues of the S 2 loop are important for their binding. We then analyzed the reported X-ray structures and sequences for other alpha-coronavirus 3CL pro 's in the PDB databank including the enzymes from the following coronaviruses: FIPV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and human coronaviruses NL63 and 229E [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . A sequence comparison of the S 2 loops of FIPV-, TGEV-, NL63-, 229E-, PEDV-, and SARS-3CL pro shows that the SARS-3CL pro S 2 loop is one residue longer than those from the alpha-coronaviruses and shares no sequence identity with FIPV-, TGEV-, NL63-, 229E-and PEDV-3CL pro (Fig. 4b) . Additionally, the S 2 loop of SARS-3CL pro contains anionic amino acids, Glu and Asp, at positions 47 and 48, respectively. These variations in the S 2 loop between the alpha-coronavirus 3CL pro 's and SARS-3CL pro may explain the large observed difference in the IC 50 value of (R)-16 against PEDV-3CL pro as compared to SARS-3CL pro (25.4 ± 1.4 μ M vs. 1.5 ± 0.3 μ M, respectively). Furthermore, the combination of the increase in length and charge properties of the S 2 loop of SARS-3CL pro relative to that of the alpha-coronavirus 3CL pro 's likely changes the size and shape of the S 2 binding pocket and therefore may allow for increased variability at the P 2 site of inhibitor and substrate molecules. To further investigate the variation in the S 2 -subsite and relationship to inhibitor and substrate binding, we examined the recognition cleavage sequences in polyprotein 1ab of both PEDV-and SARS-3CL pro (Fig. 5) 21, 22 . The S 2 -subsite residue preference is identical for PEDV-and SARS-3CL pro in most all cleavage sites, with the exception of nsp5/6 and nsp12/13. SARS-3CL pro can accommodate a larger P 2 -phenylalanine, e.g. at the nsp5/6 cleavage site, while PEDV-3CL pro recognizes residues only as large as a P 2 -leucine at this position in the polyprotein. At the nsp12/13 cleavage site, PEDV polyprotein 1ab has a serine at the P 2 site, while SARS polyprotein 1ab has a P 2 -leucine. A larger size of the S 2 pocket in SARS-3CL pro is consistent with the SARS polyprotein 1ab having a phenylalanine residue at the P 2 position of the nsp5/6 cleavage site. This larger S 2 -pocket in SARS-3CL pro may allow for better binding of (R)-16, allowing the bulky t-butylanilido group to take full advantage of hydrophobic interactions within the S 2 subsite and position (R)-16 to optimize hydrogen-bonding with SARS-3CL pro Gly143 and His163.
