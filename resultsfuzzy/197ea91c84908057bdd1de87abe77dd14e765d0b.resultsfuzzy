Positive specimens for human metapneumovirus M and L genes were purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Sequenced were obtained by an automatic DNA sequencer (ABI Prism 3700; Applied Biosystems) using Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit Version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems). Nucleotide sequences obtained were aligned with sequences published previously using Macaw 2.0.5 program.
