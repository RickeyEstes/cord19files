Change in the inhibitory activity of the AESs after hybridization with the target DNA We used a 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer as the enzyme-inhibiting aptamer; this aptamer was screened using an evolution-mimicking algorithm and a library that contains a 15-mer prototype thrombin-inhibiting aptamer with 8-mer oligonucleotides added to both the 5 0 -and the 3 0 -ends [25] . Therefore, the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer contains the consensus sequence of the 15-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer that has already been determined to fold into a G-quartet structure [27] [28] [29] [30] , which is important for the inhibition of thrombin activity. Thus, the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer used in this study was expected to form a G-quartet structure. There are three loops in the 15-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer connected to the G-quartet structure: a T-G-T loop, a 3 0 -end T-T loop, and a 5 0 -end T-T loop. The T-G-T loop contacts thrombin directly [31] , therefore, the stem-and-loop structure was inserted into the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer at the 3 0 -end T-T loop or 5 0 -end T-T loop. We designed the stem-and-loop structure inserted into the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer in such a way that the conformational change in stem-andloop structure would lead to a conformational change in the thrombin-inhibiting aptamer, which would in turn cause a decrease in the inhibitory effect of the whole complex on thrombin. First, a stem-and-loop structure reported to be a molecular beacon [1] was used, since this DNA sequence has the ability to form a stem-and-loop structure composed of a 5-bp stem and a 15-mer loop. This structure is known to be destroyed during hybridization of its target DNA with the loop part. The diameter of a DNA double helix (approximately 20 Å ) is longer than the distance between two Gs of the G-quartet structure (approximately 17 Å ). Therefore, we expected that the difference would cause the distortion and destabilization of the G-quartet structure if the stem-and-loop structure were to be directly connected to the G-quartet structure. Therefore, we constructed two kinds of thrombin-inhibiting aptamers: one was a thrombin-inhibiting aptamer which has the stem-and-loop structure inserted at the 3 0 -end T-T loop directly (AES 1), and the other was a thrombin-inhibiting aptamer, to which a stem-and-loop structure with two additional T bases, one at the 3 0 -end and one at the 5 0end, was attached at the 3 0 -end of the T-T loop of the Gquartet structure (AES 2). The thrombin-inhibiting activities of these AESs were determined by measuring the coagulation activity of thrombin in their presence. The clotting time was approximately 10 s in the presence of only thrombin (Fig. 3A,  bar 1 ); the addition of the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer resulted in the extension of the clotting time to approximately 150 s, since it inhibited thrombin activity (bar 2). The clotting time was approximately 19 s in the presence of AES 1 (data not shown); however, it was approximately 45 s in the presence of AES 2, which has two additional T bases insertion (bar 3). This result indicates that the two additional T bases insertion prevented the G-quartet structure from becoming distorted. Although the inhibitory activity of AES 2 did not change in the presence of the 15-mer control DNA, which does not hybridize with it (bar 4), the clotting time for the AES 2 changed from 45 to 26 s as a result of the addition of its 15-mer target DNA (bar 5). This suggests that the hybridization of the target DNA with the loop site of AES 2 led to the destabilization of the thrombin-inhibiting aptamer site, causing a decrease in the inhibitory effect of the whole complex on thrombin. Next, we investigated whether this system is applicable to target DNAs with other sequences and other lengths. First, we designed AES SARS 1, which has a 5-bp-stem and a 15-mer-loop inserted into 3 0 -side T-T loop site, and the loop sequence was designed to contain a sequence complementary to a portion of the SARS coronavirus genome (nucleotide positions 15581-15595) [32, 33] , as well as two additional T bases insertion. The stem sequence was chosen so that its melting temperature (T m ) was slightly higher than of the hybrid between the loop and the target DNA (stem: 52.0°C; loop, 55.9°C) using the mfold program [26] . We analyzed a character of the AES SARS 1. AES SARS 1 as well as AES 2 inhibited the activity of thrombin, and the clotting time decreased from 53 to 27 s when the 15-mer SARS DNA was added (Fig. 3A, bars 6-8) . These results suggest that it is possible to detect other target DNA sequences using this DNA sensing system. We also constructed a thrombin-inhibiting aptamer which has a stem-and-loop structure with two additional T bases inserted at its 5 0 -end T-T loop. This AES had the same characteristics as AES 2; that is, the inhibitory effect on thrombin decreased when its target DNA was added (data not shown). This indicates that the stem-and-loop structure can be inserted into either the 5 0 -end or the 3 0 -end of the T-T loop of the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer. Finally, we designed AES SARS 2, 3, and 4, all of which have a 25-mer loop sequence, containing a sequence complementary to a portion of SARS coronavirus genome (nucleotide positions 15572-15596), inserted into the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer. Each of these AESs has two additional T bases insertion, and a 6-, 7-or 8-bp stem was used, respectively. AES SARS 2 had little inhibitory effect, and the inhibitory activity of AES SARS 4 did not decrease even when its target DNA was added. AES SARS 3 had a much higher inhibitory effect, and the clotting time decreased from 46 to 17 s when its target DNA was added (Fig. 3B ). For these AESs, the local T m of the stem-and-loop structure were predicted by the mfold program as follows: 67.9°C at the loop site, and 55.6, 62.9, and 69.8°C at the 6-, 7-, and 8-bp stem sites, respectively. Namely, when the T m of the stem site was lower than that of the loop site, the AES did not fold into a G-quartet structure, and when the T m of stem site was higher than that of the loop site, the AES structure seemed not to be disrupted by the hybridization with the target DNA. These results are similar to those obtained for molecular beacons, which suggests that the dehybridization of the stem site induced by the hybridization between the target DNA and the loop site is related to the disruption of the G-quartet structure. We constructed three types of AESs (AES 2, AES SARS 1, and AES SARS 3) for different target DNAs using a thrombin-inhibiting aptamer. We speculated that these AESs would inhibit the enzymatic activity of thrombin, and their inhibitory effects would decrease when their target DNAs were added. The G-quartet structure of the thrombin-inhibiting aptamer plays an important role in the inhibitory action of the aptameric complex on thrombin. In other words, these AESs would be destroyed when they hybridized with their target DNAs because they fold into G-quartet structures. To confirm our hypothesis, we investigated whether AES SARS 1 hybridizes with its target DNA and whether its G-quartet structure is destroyed when its target DNA is added.
