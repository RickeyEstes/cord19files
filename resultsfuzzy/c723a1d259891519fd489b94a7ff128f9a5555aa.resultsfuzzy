We spiked MS2, an unenveloped bacteriophage, and Phi6, an enveloped bacteriophage, into diluted synthetic and real sludge in porcelain, concrete, PVC, and polypropylene containers and measured partitioning among the liquid, solids, and the interior surface of the container. Figures 1 and 2 show the concentrations of MS2 and Phi6, respectively, in terms of PFU equivalents in three experimental replicates of each fraction derived from diluted synthetic sludge. The three fractions were 46 mL of liquid, 4 mL of wetted solids, and 1 mL of surface extract. MS2 and Phi6 partitioned similarly in synthetic sludge; concentrations were highest in the liquid and solid phases for all materials tested, with the exception of Phi6 in porcelain, where Phi6 concentrations were comparable in all three fractions. Mean concentrations of MS2 in each fraction were within 1 order of magnitude of each other, while mean concentrations of Phi6 varied by up to 2 orders of magnitude. Background concentrations of genomic material were detectable in both types of sludge, particularly for Phi6, but were at least 4 orders of magnitude lower than in the seeded sludge. Figures 3 and 4 show the concentrations of MS2 and Phi6, respectively, in terms of PFU equivalents in three experimental replicates of each fraction derived from diluted, real, anaerobically digested sludge. The variability was much larger in real sludge than in synthetic sludge, likely due to heterogeneities in the real sludge. The average concentration of MS2 in the solid fraction was ∼2 orders of magnitude lower than in the other fractions for all materials except concrete. Average concentrations of MS2 were highest in the liquid fraction for concrete, porcelain, and PVC ( Figure 3 ). In polypropylene, the highest concentration was found in the surface extract. The average concentrations of MS2 in the liquid and surface extract from concrete were of a similar order of magnitude; however, the surface samples exhibited much larger variability. Average concentrations of Phi6 in real, anaerobically digested sludge were highest in the liquid fraction for all materials. Average concentrations were ∼1−2 orders of magnitude lower in the surface extract and were 2−4 orders of magnitude lower in the wetted solids (Figure 4) . A mass balance indicated that the sum of virions recovered (PFUs) from all three fractions was roughly within 1 order of magnitude of the number of virions initially spiked into the samples (Table S5) , so the amount of virus recovered was close to the amount spiked into the samples. One exception was Phi6 in real sludge, for which the total amount of virus recovered was 2−3 orders of magnitude higher, on average, than the number of virions spiked into the samples for all four material types. A negative control consisting of sludge that was not spiked with virus failed to amplify, so the extra virus did not originate from the sludge. It appears that Phi6 replicated rapidly in host bacteria present in the sludge during the experiment, and thus, the partitioning results represent both spiked and new virus. Figure S2 shows the partitioning of MS2 and Phi6 among the three fractions for synthetic and real sludge and all four materials. In all cases, at least 94% of the virions partitioned into the liquid fraction. In synthetic sludge, up to 4% of virions partitioned to the solids, while in real sludge, no more than 0.8% of virions partitioned to the solids. In synthetic sludge, partitioning to the material surface was low, at most 1% except for Phi6 in porcelain, where 6% of virions partitioned to the surface. In real sludge, partitioning to the material surface was also low, although both MS2 and Phi6 partitioned more to the surface of concrete and polypropylene than to the surface of porcelain and PVC. This study demonstrates that partitioning of viruses in wastewater among the liquid, biosolids, and material surface does not mitigate the potential for aerosolization of virus, as most of the virus remains in the liquid phase. Airborne viruses have been detected at wastewater treatment facilities at concentrations as high as 3 × 10 6 genome copies m −3 for adenovirus. 17, 32 Previous studies have shown that virus removal efficiency in wastewater treatment plants ranges widely from 0 to 4 logs. 33−35 In contrast to our results, some of these studies have shown that viruses adsorb well to solids. Our results are consistent with the general finding that the extent of removal of bacteria is greater than the extent of removal of virus in conventional treatment plants. With respect to concerns about transmission of Ebola virus, one limitation of this study is that the surrogate viruses may not be representative of Ebola virus. Its filamentous shape may make it more or less prone to adsorb to solids and surfaces. Another limitation is that the time allowed for partitioning was only 5−10 min, which could be representative of the time excreta remains in a toilet before flushing but is much shorter than the residence time in sewers and at wastewater treatment plants. We have identified five potential sources of uncertainty in quantification of virus concentrations. Although our qPCR calibration curves had high R 2 values, the differing matrices of the three fractions may have produced varying extraction and amplification efficiencies. It is possible that genomic material from inactivated virus and/or exogenous genomic material was counted as PFU equivalents. Inhibitors are a challenge for any PCR analysis and if severe will result in false negatives or underestimates of gene copy levels. In this study, we expect that any effects of inhibitors would have been minimal, as we were operating at the mid to upper end of the calibration curve and did not have difficulty detecting virus in any of the samples. Also, the mass balances did not suggest a major loss of virus. Because of requirements of the experimental approach, the surface fraction also included any virions present in the residual liquid that remained in the bowls after pouring out the contents; allowing the bowls to dry out completely prior to swabbing would not have eliminated these virions. Previous studies have shown that the swabbing method recovers 7−58% of viruses from dry environmental surfaces, depending on the type of swab, virus, surface material, and virus assay (culture vs molecular). 26, 27 Thus, there is the possibility for both overestimation and underestimation of the amount of virus that partitioned to porcelain, concrete, PVC, and polypropylene in this study. The mass balance (Table S5) suggests that large amounts of virus were not lost during the experiment, but even if the actual numbers of virions on surfaces were 10 times higher, the majority of virions would still be associated with the liquid phase.
