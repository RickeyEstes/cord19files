The whole DNA sequences, all protein-coding DNA sequences and all protein sequences from complete genomes of the selected 124 large dsDNA viruses and 30 selected parvoviruses were analyzed. The trees of K = 3 to 6 based on all protein sequences and the trees of K â‰¤ 13 based on the whole DNA sequences and all protein-coding DNA sequences using the DL method [33] were constructed. After comparing all the trees constructed by the present method with the classification of the 124 large dsDNA viruses and 30 parvoviruses given in the VIIIth Report of ICTV [23] , we found that the trees for large dsDNA viruses and parvoviruses based on all protein sequences are better than those based on all protein-coding DNA sequences and the whole DNA sequences. Furthermore, for the phylogenetic trees of 124 large dsDNA viruses based on all protein sequences, the tree of K = 5 provides the best result among the cases of K = 3 to 6. We show this tree in Figure 1 . The trees for K = 4 and 6 are similar to but a little bit inferior to the tree for K = 5. The bootstrap consensus trees for the four big groups (Adenoviridae, Baculoviridae, Herpesviridae and Poxviridae) ( Figure 2 ) provide branch statistics for the tree in Figure  1 . For the trees of 30 parvoviruses based on all protein sequences, the trees for K = 4 and 6 are topologically identical, and are the best trees among the cases of K = 3 to 6. We show the tree for K = 4 in Figure 3 . The tree for K = 5 is similar to but a little bit worse than the trees for K = 4 and 6. Figure 4 shows the bootstrap consensus tree of Figure 3 . The distance matrices generated from our analyses are available from the first author via email yuzg1970@yahoo.com . We found that the DL method [33] and the modified DL method [41] give trees of the same topology for the same K for both data sets. As given in Figure 1 , despite numerous horizontal gene transfers among large dsDNA viruses [9] , our analysis can divide the 124 dsDNA viruses into nine families correctly. Our phylogenetic relationships of all 124 large dsDNA viruses are in good agreement with the latest classification in the VIIIth Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [20] . In the family Adenoviridae, Figures 1 and 2a support the division of this family into four genera Atadenovirus, Aviadenovirus, Mastadenovirus and Siadenovirus. All viruses in these four genera are grouped correctly. The topology of phylogeny for these four genera is identical to that shown in Figure one of [1] which supports the hypothesis that interspecies transmission, i.e. host switches of adenoviruses, may have occurred [42] . In Figures 1 and 2b , the family Baculoviridae is divided into two genera Granulovirus and Nucleopolyhedrovirus. All viruses in these two genera are classified correctly. The unclassified virus NeleNPV in this family groups with NeseNPV which belongs to genus Nucleopolyhedrovirus. So our result supports grouping virus NeleNPV to genus Nucleopolyhedrovirus. Another unclassified virus CuniNPV is located at the basal position of this family, as reported by Herniou et al [43] , with the Hymenoptera baculoviruses (NeleNPV and NeseNPV) and Lepidoptera baculoviruses (the remaining species) grouped together, as reported by Herniou et al [8] and Zanotto et al [44] . Thus the classification of CuniNPV is still unresolved in our analysis. The division of the family Poxviridae into two subfamilies Chordopoxvirinae and Entomopoxvirinae shown in Figures 1 and 2d is the same as in the VIIIth Report of ICTV. In the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae, the viruses in the genera Avipoxvirus, Capripoxvirus, Leporipoxvirus, Molluscipoxvirus, Orthopoxvirus, Parapoxvirus, Suipoxvirus and Yatapoxvirus group together correctly. The unclassified virus DPV is closely related to the genera Capripoxvirus and Suipoxvirus, so that our result supports assigning the virus DPV to the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae, in agreement with the results in [1] and [45] . In the subfamily Entomopoxvirinae, the viruses in genus Betaentomopoxvirus group together as expected. The division of the family Herpesviridae into subfamilies Alphaherpesvirinae, Gammaherpesvirinae and Betaherpesvirinae is clear. All viruses in the genera within each subfamily are grouped correctly in Figures 1 and 2c Figure 1 . The grouping of the unclassified virus HZV_1 with WSSV indicates its affiliation to the genus Whispovirus in the family Nimaviridae. The viruses in family Phycodnaviridae group together as expected. The virus APMiV of the genus Mimivirus but with no family affiliation nests within the family Phycodnaviridae suggests classification of the genus to this family. The viruses in the family Polydnaviridae cluster together correctly. As claimed by Gao and Qi [1] , our results could also provide some clues to the hypotheses on the origins and evolution of viruses of several families. Overall, the topology of our tree is similar to that of the tree in [1] and our tree is slightly better because the tree in [1] has 4 outliers (Cun-iNPV, IIV_6, IcHV_1 and OsHV_1) while ours has no outlier. Although the results using feature frequency profiles (FFPs) on a slightly larger data set showed the FFP method can also resolve the phylogeny of large dsDNA viruses [2] , the optimal feature length for FFP method is 8 implying that much longer computing time and larger computer space are needed as compared to our method with an optimal feature length of 5. As shown in Figures 3 and 4 , our analyses showed that the parvovirus genomes are separated into two major groups, with one group corresponding to the subfamily Parvovirinae and the other group corresponding to the subfamily Densovirinae. In the Parvovirinae group, the parvoviruses in the genera Parvovirus, Erythrovirus, Dependovirus, Amdovirus and Bocavirus group together as subgroups respectively. In the Densovirinae group, the parvoviruses in the genera Densovirus, Iteravirus and Brevidensovirus cluster together as subgroups correctly. All the groups and subgroups shown in Figure 3 using our method agree well with the latest classification of parvoviruses given in the VIIIth Report of ICTV [20] except PfDNV. PfDNV was classified into the Brevidensovirus in the VIIth Report of the ICTV [23] and reclassified into Pefudensovirus in the VIIIth Report of ICTV [20] . After the comparison on the genome structure, coding protein sequence homology, DNA sequence homology, 3-dimensional structure [46, 47] between PfDNV and other parvoviruses, Li et al [48] claimed that it would be more appropriate to classify pfDNV as Densovirus rather than Brevidensovirus. Thus the grouping of PfDNV with Densoviru in our tree (Figures 3 and 4) provides another piece of evidence for classifying PfDNV as Densovirus. Amdovirus and Bocavirus are newly defined genera in the subfamily Parvoririnae in the VIIIth Report of ICTV [20] . In the VIIth Report of ICTV [23] , the parvoviruses (AMDV and MVC) in these two new genera were grouped under Parvovirus. Their close relationship is also reflected in our trees (Figures 3 and 4) in which Amdovirus and Bocavirus cluster with Parvovirus as a separate branch. The parvoviruses AAV7, AAV8, AAAVa, BPV2, MPV, AdDNV and CeDNV are still not classified in the VIIIth Report of ICTV [20] . In our previous study [33] , the DL method applied to the analysis of 103 prokaryotes and six eukaryotes has yielded trees separating the three domains of life, Archaea, Eubacteria and Eukarya with the relationships among the taxa in good agreement with those based on traditional analyses. It has also been applied in analyzing the chloroplast genomes [33] to give reliable phylogenies of plants and algae. From the above discussion, it is clear that this method can successfully resolve the phylogeny of parvoviruses. The positions of AAV7, AAV8, AAAVa, BPV2, MPV, AdDNV and CeDNV in Figure 3 provide new insights on their classification. It is very interesting to note the assumption that small DNA viruses (genome size <10 kb) probably have different evolutionary history as compared to large DNA viruses [9, 49] . Our analyses showed that the DL method can be used to reconstruct the phylogeny of viruses with large difference in genome size (larger than 10 kb for large dsDNA viruses and less than 10 kb for parvoviruses). We also generated all the trees of the same K values based on the three kinds of sequences for the parvovirus data set 2 using the CV Tree method [34] . Yet no tree generated by the CV Tree method can clearly distinguish the subfamilies Parvovirinae and Densovirinae of parvoviruses. So for the data set of parvoviruses, the DL method is superior (from the biological point of view) to the CV Tree method in phylogenetic inference. Our approach is faster than the traditional approaches of phylogenetic analysis, particularly when dealing with a large number of genomes. Moreover, since multiple sequence alignment is not necessary, the intrinsic problems associated with this complex procedure can be avoided. Our method may provide a quick reference on virus phylogeny and a fast analysis of co-evolution of viruses and their hosts when their proteomes are available [1, 50] .
