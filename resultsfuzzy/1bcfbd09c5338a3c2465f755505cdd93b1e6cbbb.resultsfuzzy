The determined mole fraction solubility of ribavirin in binary solvent mixtures of (methanol + water), (n-propanol + water), (acetonitrile + water) and (1,4-dioxane + water) are presented in Tables 1-4, respectively. In addition, the relationship between the mole fraction solubility and temperature and solvent composition are shown graphically in Figs. 1-4. It can be seen that, for the studied solvent mixtures, the ribavirin solubility is a function of temperature and solvent composition. The solubility of ribavirin increase with increasing temperature and mass fraction of water for the binary systems studied. The maximum solubility of ribavirin is observed in water. It can also be seen from Tables 1-4 that, at the same temperature and solvent composition, the solubility of ribavirin in (methanol + water) is greater than those in (n-propanol + water), (acetonitrile + water) and (1,4-dioxane + water). This behaviour may be due to the relative strong polarity of ribavirin molecule. At the same composition, the polarities of the four mixed solvents rank as (methanol + water) > (n-propanol + water) > (acetonitrile + water) > (1,4-dioxane + water) [49] . Therefore, the solubilities of ribavirin in (methanol + water) are larger than those in the other solvent mixtures. It is noteworthy that the mole-fraction solubility of ribavirin (II) in water at 298.15 K determined in this work is 0.01741, which is a little larger than 0.0103 (142 mgÁmLl À1 ) reported by Benet [19] , Goodarzi [20] , Dave [21] and Chen [22] , 0.0109 (149 mgÁmL À1 ) reported by Vasa [23] , and 0.0124 (169.99 mgÁmL À1 ) reported by Prasanthi [24] . The difference may be due to many factors, such as determination method, equilibration time, purity, sampling, analysis method and so on. Based on study made by Vasa and Wildfong [23] , ribavirin (II) reached a maximum solubility within 30 min. On the other hand, it can also be seen from the plots of the ribavirin (II) concentrations in distilled water as a function of time that, when the dissolution time is 180 min, the concentration of ribavirin (II) in water remains increased obviously. Therefore, it can be speculated that if the time is prolonged, the ribavirin (II) concentration will also increase. In other words, the concentration (149 mgÁml À1 ) at 30 min is not the equilibrium solubility of ribavirin (II) in water at studied temperature.
