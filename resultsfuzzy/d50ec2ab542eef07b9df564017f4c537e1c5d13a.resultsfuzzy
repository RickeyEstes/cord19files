The interviews with the battle commanders revealed that there were no differences in the training schedules, living environments, or indoor hand washing methods. The hand washing method and cough etiquette were instructed to all trainees as a common curriculum, and bulletin board postings entitled "Hand Washing Method" were also displayed in the barracks and bathrooms of both groups. However, there was a significant difference in terms of hand washing during outdoor activities. While one battalion (the early hand washing group) performed hand washing during field training beginning in the first week, the other battalion did not perform hand washing during field training for the first 2 weeks. Beginning from the third week of training, we implemented the same hand washing methods for the late hand washing group that had not implemented it in the first 2 weeks. It was impossible to implement the same hand washing methods during field training as those performed in the barracks due to the lack of available tap water. Because of this, the hand washing method was modified as follows: water and basins for washing hands were provided via military trucks. Four wash basins were provided to each squad (about 10 trainees each). Wash basins were located in a row. The wash basin in the first row was filled with soapy water (a piece of soap was dissolved in about 4 liters of water) and the others were filled with only tap water. Under supervision of the squad commander, every trainee in each squad washed their hands in a line one after the other. After washing in the 4 basins, the squad commander distributed a bucket of water to each trainee. Hand washing was generally performed 3 times during field training: once in the morning after training for 2 hours, again before lunch, and again after training for 3 hours in the afternoon during field training.
