There are some differences between the conformations of the protein in the 3D similarity reference and 2GTB model. Therefore, we modelled 10 new homology models using the proteins in 3D similarity reference as templates and we redocked the 15 drugs to the 10 new homology models. 6 drugs (nelfinavir, pitavastatin, perampanel, praziquantel, zopiclone, and eszopiclone) show good docking scores and binding modes (Table 3) . Because eszopiclone and zopiclone was used to treat insomnia in a low dosage which may not be suitable to treat pneumonia, we carried out further binding free energy calculation for the rest 4 drugs. author/funder.

To provide insight into their binding mechanisms, the binding free energies were calculated by MM/GBSA and SIE approaches. In results of the MM/GBSA approach, the calculated binding free energies of nelfinavir-2GX4, pitavastatin-2GTB, perampanel-5NH0, and praziquantel-3V3M, are -24.69±0.52, -12.70±0.38, -14.98±0.34, and -6.51±0.21 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 4) , which highlight nelfinavir as the most active one. In pitavastatin-2GTB, perampanel-5NH0, and praziquantel-3V3M, the van der Waals interaction (E vdw ) makes a more significant contribution than the electrostatic interaction (E ele ) (
