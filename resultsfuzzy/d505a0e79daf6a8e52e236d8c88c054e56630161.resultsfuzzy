After concentration of the tissue culture fluid by PEG 6000, MHV3 was purified successively on a rate zonal sucrose gradient and on a density glycerol/tartrate gradient. In this density gradient, MHV3 sedimented in a homogeneous band at a density of 1.185 (data not shown). Typical coronavirus particles with a diameter in the range of 70 to 120 nm covered with surface projections 15 to 22 nm in length could be observed ( fig. la) . . 2c ). Densitometrie analysis of different fluorographs (data not shown) revealed that in all cases the label of this neoproteins was approximatively the same that the label of VGP=4 and was significantly higher that the label of VP,~. Consequently, the 18,000-dalton protein seems derived mostly from VGP=4 and represents the portion of VGP=~ loealised inside the lipid bilayers of the membrane. Thus VGP24 was partially concealed within the viral envelope, and 25 ~ of this polypeptide was accessible to the enzyme. VP~ which disappears after bromelain treatment has not been localised on the viral membrane. Although, this 18,000-dalton protein appears to be derived in great part from VGP~, it is impossible to determine if it represents a single species of protein or if it also contains a polypeptide of similar MW issued from VP~s. Consequently, our results cannot indicate whether VP~5 is completely, digested by bromelain as in the case for VGPI~o and VGPlo~ and thus appears loealised at the surface of the membrane or whether VP~ as VGP,~ is partially concealed in the viral envelope. The available data on the structural proteins of coronaviruses from different species reveal some variety in number and size [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19., 15, 16, 20] . In general, the particle contains four to seven proteins. All reports indicate the presence of a major non-glycosylated protein of 50 to 60,000 daltons located inside the virion. One or two polypeptides below 50,000 daltons have been found, and at least one of these is glycosylated. A portion of these low MW proteins is localised inside the lipid bilayer. The polypeptides of high MW (2 to 4) are all glycosylated and involved in forming the surface projections.
