When gnotobiotic or SPF laboratory animals have been used from the start, the interpretation of diagnostic test results is, for the most part, qualitative. The goal is to determine whether the animals tested have been exposed to a particular infectious agent. Accurate quantification of antibody levels or numbers of bacteria, for example, is only important insofar as clearly negative and positive results are easier to interpret than are equivocal results near the dividing line between positive and negative. The ideal test is one that in all cases clearly distinguishes between exposed and unaffected animals. With a typical test, however, a certain percentage of results are inaccurate, in that Table X Colony Schedule cific assay is one that gives a low percentage of false-positive resuits or, conversely, a high percentage of true-negative results in tests performed on unaffected animals ( Fig. 12 ) (Zweig and Robertson, 1987) . samples from unaffected animals may give false-positive reactions and those from exposed animals may yield false-negative results (Fig. 11 ) (Tyler and Cullor, 1989) . To this point in the chapter, the terms sensitivity and specificity have been used in their analytical sense. In that context, sensitivity is the ability of an assay to detect small amounts of analyte (e.g., antigen, antibody, or target DNA); specificity describes the selectivity of an assay reaction. These terms are defined somewhat differently in a diagnostic or statistical context. A sensitive assay is one that produces a low percentage of false-negative results or, conversely, a high percentage of truepositive results in tests performed on exposed animals. A spe- All Acutely ill; serum antibodies not yet detectable Immunodeficient or immunosuppressed; weak or no antibody response Older and recovered from infection Site where organism is not resident Small sample size Sentinels not adequately exposed via soiled bedding or contact to infectious agents carried by principals Rodent strain with autoimmune disease a Immunized or inoculated with biological material (e.g., tumor cells) a Maternal antibodies b Sentinels housed under less strict conditions than principals (e.g., principals kept in microisolation cages, but sentinels are in open cages) a Sera from animals with autoimmune disease or from those inoculated with biological materials may contain antibodies that react with microbial or nonmicrobial constituents in the antigen preparation. Antibodies to nonmicrobial constituents may not be detected in the control, leading to a false-positive result. b False positive in that maternal antibodies are not a response by the animal sampled to an infection. Besides being a consequence of the limits of test sensitivity and specificity, false-positive and false-negative results can be due to sample selection and laboratory errors. Examples of sample selection errors are shown in Table XI . Myriad laboratory errors can cause inaccurate results, including improper sample preparation and storage, sample mix-ups, deviation from accepted procedures, and result transcription mistakes. False-positive results should be suspected when reactions are borderline-positive or the prevalence of positive specimens is low. As demonstrated in Fig. 13 , the predictive value of positive results for a highly specific assay becomes negligible when the percentage of positive samples is low, e.g., less than 15% (La-Regina and Lonigro, 1988; Zweig and Robertson, 1987) . First-time positive findings should always be confirmed before acting. Confirmation is accomplished by repeat testing of the positive samples, by testing additional samples, and by using alternative assays and diagnostic methodologies to corroborate primary test results. For example, sera that are Mycoplasma pulmonis ELISA-positive might be repeat-tested for specific antibodies by IFA. Additional animals from the suspect colony could be cultured for mycoplasma and examined grossly and microscopically for lung lesions. Finally, mycoplasma isolates could be identified as M. pulmonis with species-specific antisera or by PCR with a species-specific primer set. Once results are confirmed, the options for eliminating or containing an infection discussed in Section III should be followed. It is worth reemphasizing that it is counterproductive to start a new SPF colony without first investigating the sources of the infection and making the necessary procedural and facility modifications to prevent a recurrence. In summary, no diagnostic test always gives accurate results. False-positive and false-negative results occur because of the incomplete specificity or sensitivity of tests and because of 13 .

(From Weisbroth et al., 1998, Fig. 8, p. 284.) sample selection and laboratory errors. Consequently, it is prudent to always confirm unexpected positive findings before deciding on a course of action. This is accomplished by repeat testing of the same and additional samples, using a variety of diagnostic methodologies.
