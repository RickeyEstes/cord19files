Outpatients enrolled with A(H1N1)pdm09 confirmed at the central laboratories are included in the FLU 002 cohort. The FLU 003 hospitalized cohort includes patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection confirmed at a central laboratory and patients who tested positive for influenza A by a local laboratory and negative for influenza A at a central laboratory during the initial 6 months of enrollment when A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was highly prevalent and the results of local RT-PCR testing did not record the influenza A subtype (see Appendix S2).
