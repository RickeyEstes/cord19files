Computational approaches, such as structural bioinformatics [76, 77] , molecular docking [66, 78, 79] , Monte Carlo simulated annealing approach [80] and QSAR [50, 81, 82] can timely provide very  The output of the model, MD-score, is a real value variable that scores the predicted goodness of fit for one MD trajectory. In statistical prediction, the following three cross-validation methods are often used to examine a predictor for its effectiveness in practical application: independent dataset test, sub-sampling test, and jackknife test [166] . However, as elucidated by [167] and demonstrated in [168] , among the three cross-validation methods, the jackknife test is deemed the most objective that can always yield a unique result for a given benchmark dataset, and hence has been increasingly and widely used by investigators to examine the accuracy of various predictors (see, e.g., [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] 27, [169] [170] [171] [172] ). In the current study, because the jackknife test would take a lot of computational time, we choose to use the independent dataset test to examine the prediction accuracy. The model was trained with a training series and later validated with an external validation series. In training series the model correctly classifies 79 out of 80 (specificity ¼ 98.75%) optimal and 226 out of 238 (sensitivity ¼ 94.96%) no-optimal MD trajectories. In external validation series the model correctly classifies 26 out of 26 (specificity ¼ 100%) optimal and 75 out of 78 (sensitivity ¼ 96.15%) nooptimal MD trajectories. These results represent total accuracy ¼ 95.91% and 97.12% in training and validation respectively. Previous QSAR works that use LDA as the classification technique accept this level of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy as indicative of high quality of the model [106,173-178þ ].
