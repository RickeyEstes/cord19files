For each set of experiments, we have considered four main factors: (a) Infected patients inserted during the model initialization (b) Transmission-rate of disease (c) Isolation: On/Off (d) Spread-ratio: Average, Slow or Fast. To observe the significance of these factors in the emergence of SARS virus in society, we have followed a sensitivity analysis method of changing each factor at a time to see what factor affects the most. Moreover, during the experimental phase of study our focus was to identify the inter-dependency among the factors. In our experiments we observed that if the intervention procedure of Isolating patients is not followed, then the number of infected patients increases substantially. Thus we came to conclusion that Isolation of patient is an important factor to control the spread of disease. Figure 1 denotes the results when the Isolation intervention is considered, while Figure 2 shows the results when the Isolation intervention is not considered.
