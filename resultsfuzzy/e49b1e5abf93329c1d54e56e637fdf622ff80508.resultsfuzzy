On April 16, 1 month after the network began to function, participating laboratories collectively announced conclusive identification of the new coronavirus as the causative agent of SARS. The announcement was made based on the results from the monkey studies done in the Netherlands laboratory. This virus was found in many SARS patients from several countries. The virus causes a cytopathogenic effect in two cell lines (Vero cells and fetal rhesus kidney cells). Electron microscopy of cell culture and respiratory samples from SARS patients show coronavirus-like particles. Immunofluorescent assays with serum from convalescent patients detect cells infected with the virus in cell culture. Reactivity with this new coronavirus could not be detected in serum from several hundreds of non-SARS individuals in the USA, Canada and Hong Kong. Generic coronavirus primers can detect the new coronavirus RNA in cell culture and in samples from SARS patients. Specific primers have been developed in several laboratories and are currently being compared for sensitivity. Hyperimmune sera against transmissible gastroenteritis virus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, and 229E human coronavirus react with the virus antigen in cell culture. Partial sequencing of the new coronavirus in several laboratories has confirmed its affiliation to the genus Coronavirus but shown dissimilarities with known members belonging to each of the three existing groups of this genus. Three diagnostic tests are now available, but all have limitations. Since the ELISA detects antibodies reliably only from about day 20 after the onset of clinical symptoms, it cannot be used to detect cases before they potentially spread the infection to others. The second test, an immunofluorescence assay, detects antibodies reliably after day 10 of infection. Various versions of real-time and block-based PCR tests are currently being developed to improve their low sensitivity and reduce the number of false-negative test results. All existing tests, used individually or in combination, can only confirm the disease in suspected or probable SARS cases. More work is needed before reliable, easy-to-use and sensitive tests become available in all countries. Work towards this objective is continuing and is proceeding at a rapid pace. Each laboratory has contributed substantially to the rapid identification and characterisation of the new coronavirus associated with SARS. [31] [32] [33]
