Results from the 4-step screening and appraisal process detailed in the Materials and Methods section are shown in Figure 1 . Briefly, WoS returned 125 unique papers pertaining to cow-calf separation and health. The titles of these papers were scanned, and 45 papers were subsequently excluded (7 of these were written in another language, and 38 concerned beef cattle or other species). Following an assessment of the abstracts (n = 80), an additional 32 papers were excluded. At this stage, 61 articles were sourced from the reference lists of the remaining papers, and from the reference lists of newly included papers. In the final exclusion stage, a further 39 papers were removed because they were review articles (n = 12), did not directly compare cow or calf health in relation to cow-calf contact (n = 25), or were literature-based mathematical models (n = 2). In total, 70 articles (comprised of 29 single-herd studies and 41 multi-herd studies) were selected for inclusion; 9 of these were included in 2 of the specific sections below, and 4 were included in 3 sections. The final manuscripts included in this systematic review were authored between 1971 and 2016. The studies originated from 6 continents and 30 countries, most commonly North America (n = 25: United States = 15; Canada = 5; Mexico = 5) and Europe (n = 20: Central Europe = 5; Scandinavia = 6; Western Europe = 8; Southern Europe = 1). Additionally, 4 studies originated from South America, 4 from East Africa, 5 from Asia (Middle East = 2; South East Asia = 3), and 3 from Oceania (Australia = 2; New Zealand = 1). These statistics include only those studies that specified regional information. The single-herd studies included between 2 and 7 relevant groups with a total sample size of between 4 and 464 animals. The multi-herd studies included between 3 and 2,915 herds with the total number of animals ranging from 240 to 32,622.
