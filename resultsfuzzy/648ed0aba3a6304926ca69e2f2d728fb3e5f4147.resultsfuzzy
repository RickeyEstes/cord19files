This question becomes more difficult the more one employs preclinical testing in preventive medicine programs (Clementi et al., 1995; Jacobson and Romatowski, 1996; Smith, 1995) . The predictive value of a positive result may be high when an animal is clinical, such as a cat with FIP. However, with early testing the problems of detecting cross-reacting viruses (feline enteric coronaviruses) increases, as does the question of whether the preclinical result accurately identifies an animal that is just infected or will progress onto disease (Evermann et al., 1995; Foley et al., 1997) . In infections such as EIA, the consequences of infection are just as severe as the horse that has clinical signs of EIA. This is because the infection is regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and all seropositive horses and mules are required to be reported, regardless of their health status. Assays for early detection of EIA infection have been reported to detect viral RNA in plasma samples as early as 48 hours after infection (Langemeier et al., 1996) . Similarly in bovine tuberculosis, caused byMycobacterium bovis, the consequences of a positive test result can be economically devastating due to stringent government regulations. This becomes particularly problematic because many tests currently available may cross-react with other mycobacterial species (Essey and Koller, 1994; O'Reilly and Daborn, 1995) . To determine what consequences the test results will have on the animal and the owner it is important to ask five key questions (Table  II) . Is the infection and/or disease of economic concern, such as EIA or M. bovis; is the infection and/or disease of zoonotic concern, such as E. coli 0157:H7; where is the microbial agent when not causing disease, such as with rabies reservoirs in bat populations; what are the contributing factors to the infection and/or disease process, such as pregnancy for CHV and other herpesviruses; and what factors can animal owners/veterinarians/public health personnel control to minimize or eliminate the risk of infection and/or the disease process? Table III lists some of the consequences of the infection and/or disease process. These range from no sale, as with a goat that is CAE seropositive, to euthanasia if a horse or mule is tested EIA seropositive. V. Where Are We Heading with Veterinary Diagnostics? Veterinary diagnostics, like their human counterparts, are already directing efforts toward more sensitive assays, which are capable of detecting infections very early (within hours of initial infection); subclinical infections that are the result of persistent infections acquired during gestation and masked by immune tolerance; latent infections due to herpesviruses and retroviruses; and infections that pose a public health risk (Barrett et al., 1997; Burr, 1996; Clarke, 1997; de la Torre and Oldstone, 1996; Rodriquez, 1997) . The evolution of diseases and the emergence of newly recognized pathogens have placed considerable pressure on new diagnostic technologies. The newer assays will assist in tracking the emerging infections, as well as linking causal association with disease to a firm cause and effect of the disease (Bryan et al., 1994; Holtzman et al., 1997; Hoet and Haufroid, 1997; Lipstich et al., 1996; McDade and Anderson, 1996; Poland et al., 1996) . 1. Is the infection and/or disease of economic concern? 2. Is the infection and/or disease of zoonotic concern? 3. Where is the microbial agent when not causing disease (microbial ecology)? 4. What are the contributing factors to the infection and/or disease process? 5. What factors can animal owners/veterinarians/public health personnel control to minimize or eliminate the risk of infection/disease process ?  TABLE III immune function (immune competence), (2) assays to monitor genetic resistance/susceptibility, (3) assays to monitor infections, (4) assays to diagnose disease and monitor response to treatment, and (5) assays to track emerging infections. As infectious agents continue to evolve, disease expression will change, resulting in the necessity to develop new diagnostic assays (Susser and Susser, 1996b; Wilson, 1994) .
