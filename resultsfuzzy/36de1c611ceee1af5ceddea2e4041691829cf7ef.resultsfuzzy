Despite the meticulous observation of these specimens, no DMVs were detected in this clinical material ( Figure 1 ). The only structures suggestive of virus-induced membrane rearrangements were small clusters of 10 to 30 single-membrane vesicles lying close to the ER and the lipid droplets (LDs), which are known to be involved in the production of HCV virions. This material studied (tissues embedded in Epon by conventional means) could not be used for immuno-electron microscopy, but these clusters of single-membrane vesicles were strikingly similar to the HCV membranous web initially described in Huh7 cells harboring the con1 subgenomic replicon [3] . The discrepancies between the results of different studies may reflect properties specific to the JFH-1 strain or its derivatives which have been used in many of the investigations showing DMVs to be the most prevalent membrane rearrangements in HCV-infected cells. It has been suggested in the coronavirus model that DMVs conceal the viral RNA, enabling the virus to evade the dsRNA-triggered antiviral responses of the host [11] . Thus, the induction of numerous DMVs may be a hallmark of the laboratory-adapted JFH-1 strain, reflecting its ability to achieve particularly high levels of replication in vitro by protecting its dsRNA in sealed compartments inaccessible to the host cell dsRNA-triggered antiviral responses. However, since the early observations of Huh7 cells harboring a con1 subgenomic replicon, DMVs have been reported in such cells [5, 12] . Thus, the concealment of viral RNA in DMVs may be part of the innate immune response mechanisms of the host cell itself, particularly in cell lines cultured in vitro, to limit viral replication. Alternatively, DMV formation may require levels of viral proteins achieved in cell cultures, but not in vivo. Indeed, HCV replication rates are much higher in HCV-infected cells or in cells harboring a subgenomic replicon than in vivo. HCV replication is highly sensitive to interferon and an interferon-containing environment, such as the liver, is probably less favorable to HCV replication than cultured Huh7.5 cells, which are unable to produce interferon. It has been suggested that HCV-induced DMVs in cell cultures are derived from single-membrane vesicles present at the early events of viral infection [6, 13] . These early events observed in vitro may reflect the situation in the liver of HCV-infected patients in vivo, the subsequent induction of DMVs being a specific feature of highly replicative HCV strains propagated in cultured cell lines in vitro. We cannot exclude the possibility that DMVs are present in vivo, but in too small number for detection in liver biopsy specimens, especially since these liver biopsy specimens represent only a small part of the whole liver. However, their absence from the several hundred hepatocytes observed per biopsy specimen is remarkable, given that 7% to 20% of hepatocytes are infected with HCV in liver biopsy specimens from HCV chronic carriers [14] . The absence of DMVs from the liver biopsy specimens studied could not be explained by technical issues, as the methods used for sample fixation and preparation for transmission electron microscopy in our laboratory are the same as those used to observe DMVs in cultured cells [4, 6] . Unfortunately, we were not able to confirm the presence of HCV non-structural proteins or HCV RNA in these single membrane vesicles, as these liver tissues were prepared in conventionally Epon-embedded blocks and thus precluded immuno-electron microscopy investigations. However, it should be noted that a structure very similar to that observed here was reported in the liver biopsy specimens from HCV-infected chimpanzees used for the initial description of the membranous web [2] . It remains unclear whether these discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo observations of HCV-infected cells also apply to other DMV-inducing positive-sense RNA viruses. However, this study provides the first description of the membranous web established by HCV in human liver.
