Synthesized compounds were first analyzed for binding to the HIV-1 FSS by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). This technique allows the equilibrium constant (K D ) and kinetic rate constants (k on , k off ) to be determined in a label-free format. 38 A 5′-biotin labeled HIV-1 FSS RNA upper stem-loop (sequence as in Figure 1 ) was immobilized on a streptavidinfunctionalized sensor chip. Compound solutions in HBS buffer (0.01 M HEPES, 0.150 M NaCl, pH = 7.4) were flowed over the RNA, and the reference-subtracted sensorgrams were recorded. The associative and dissociative phases of the experimental sensorgrams for at least five different concentrations were globally fit to a 1:1 Langmuir equation to obtain the binding constants. 39 Under these conditions, benzo[g]quinoline-containing compounds 4 and 5 bound the HIV-1 FSS with affinities (K D ) of 89 nM and 102 nM, respectively, in each case representing an approximately 50-fold increased affinity over 2 and 3 (Table 1) . Binding by benzo[g]quinoline containing monomer 6 was 200fold weaker relative to that of the dimers 4 and 5. Removal of one heterocycle "arm" also resulted in an approximately 200fold decrease in affinity for 7 and a 30-fold decrease for 8, while removal of both benzo[g]quinoline groups completely abrogated binding between 10 and the HIV-1 FSS RNA, consistent with our prior results, indicating the importance of the heterocyclic group for affinity. Disulfide linked compound 11 bound the target RNA with a K D of 0.741 μM, which is ∼7fold weaker relative to the olefin analogs 4 and 5. No binding was observed between the 2-ethyl benzo[g]quinoline carboxylic acid and the HIV-1FSS by SPR. Confirming their anticipated selectivity for the HIV-1 FSS, compounds 4−10 showed no binding to the HTLV-2 FSS by SPR at concentrations up to 3 μM (Supporting Information p S12). The dissociation phase for SPR traces obtained at the highest concentrations for compounds 4 and 5 were not well fit by a single-exponential function. To control for the possibility of compound aggregation interfering with the measurement, 40 we therefore reexamined these compounds using a running buffer containing detergent (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 0.005% Tween-20). This had only a marginal impact on the fitted kinetic parameters (Table 1) , suggesting aggregation is not a significant complicating factor in the assay. An SPR chip with a very low density of RNA provided similar dissociation constants (Supporting Information). To confirm thermodynamic dissociation constants measured by SPR with a fully solution-phase method, and to further assess sequence selectivity, fluorescence titrations were conducted. In these experiments, saturable quenching of benzo[g]quinoline fluorescence was observed as a function of added unlabeled RNA. Dissociation constants obtained in this manner ( Table 2 ) for 4 and 5 binding the HIV-1 FSS RNA are in general agreement with those obtained via SPR. By fluorescence we observe a 5-fold selectivity for 4 binding the FSS RNA vs total yeast tRNA, while selectivity for FSS RNA vs FSS DNA was 4-fold. The selectivity of 5 for FSS RNA vs tRNA was somewhat lower (2.14-fold). Curiously, unlike 4, 5 had no selectivity for FSS RNA vs FSS DNA. Thus, as 2 and 3 were previously found to have no measurable affinity for tRNA, we conclude that the increase in affinity obtained on replacement of the quinoline moieties of 2 and 3 with benzo[g]quinoline does come with a cost of some decrease in selectivity. This result is in contrast to what was observed in a related series of compounds optimized for binding triplet repeat RNA sequences relevant to type 1 myotonic dystrophy. 37 It is likely that these differences have a structural foundation, and further experiments will be needed to explore this hypothesis. Cell Permeation and Toxicity. Before analyzing the effect of compounds on HIV-1 frameshifting in cells, we verified that they were capable of crossing cell membranes, and not toxic at reasonable concentrations. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293FT) were treated with 4, 5, and 11 at concentrations of 50, 100, 200, and 500 μM for 12 h. Cells were then washed using standard methods 41 to ensure that cell staining was not simply due to surface capture. The inherent fluorescence of the benzo[g]quinoline chromophore in these compounds allowed direct visualization of cell penetration via fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 2 shows results for 50 μM treatment; additional images are provided in the Supporting Information), confirming that cells internalized all three compounds. Compounds did not appear to localize in any specific Cell viability was analyzed using the WST-1 assay. 42 Compounds were incubated with HEK 293FT cells cultured in DMEM for 24 h, after which a 10:1 media to WST-1 cell proliferation reagent mixture replaced the growth media for 2 h. Absorbance was then measured at 450 and 690 nm. Disulfide linked compound 11 proved toxic at concentrations above 10 μM, while no significant toxicity for compounds 4 and 5 occurred at concentrations below 60 μM (Figure 3 ). The higher toxicity observed for 11 relative to 4 and 5 is not surprising and likely reflects the lability of the disulfide bond in the reducing environment of the cell.
