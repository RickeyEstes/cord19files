Four hundred and forty-six cases of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia with symptom onset dates between January 2015 -December 2017 were included in the analysis. Table 1 presents the case counts as well as crude and age-and sex-standardized rates by province, sex, and age group. All 13 provinces in Saudi Arabia reported cases during this 3-year period. Riyadh province had the highest count of reported cases with 185 cases (42%), although Qasseem had the highest cumulative incidence (3.8 cases per 100,000 people), followed by Riyadh (2.54 cases per 100,000 people). The median age of cases was 58 years (range, 15-98), and 79% of cases were male. Age and sex proportions are similar to figures reported for primary cases in previously published literature [28] . Figure 3 presents the case count by month from 2015 to 2017 for the entire country. Cases were reported in every month of the year, although no clear seasonality is apparent. Temperature and humidity conditions were associated with case occurrence 8-11 days later. The odds of a MERS case 9 days after low minimum temperatures was 1.29 (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.06-1.58) higher than after control days, while low mean daily temperature was similarly associated with cases at 9 (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.02-1.54) and 10 day lags (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.04-1.56) (Fig. 4) . Conversely, high minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures were protective at similar lag days. For example, the odds ratios of MERS cases for the high mean daily temperature was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.61-0.96) with a 9-day lag, and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.58-0.92) with a 10-day lag. Humidity followed a similar pattern to temperature. When maximum daily humidity was low 8 days earlier, the odds ratio for a MERS cases was 1.35 (95% CI, 1.10-1.65). High humidity was associated with fewer cases across all three daily measurements (Fig. 5) . For example, the odds ratios of cases for high maximum daily humidity was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.53-0.86) and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.60-0.95) at 9-and 10-day lags, respectively. High visibility was positively associated with occurrence of a MERS case 7 days later, whereas low visibility demonstrated protective effects for risk of MERS (Fig. 6) . The odds of a MERS case 7 days after both minimum and mean daily visibility were high was 1.27 and 1.26 times higher than after control days (95% CI, 1.01-1.60 and 1.01-1.57). Conversely, when minimum and mean Wind speed results were conflicting, with low minimum daily wind speed and high maximum wind speed both positively associated with cases at similar time lags (Fig. 6) . The odds of a MERS case was 1.40 times higher 6 days after low minimum wind speed (95% CI, 1.05-1.87), while the odds ratio of cases for when minimum wind speed was relatively high was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.54-0.96). Conversely, the odds of a case when maximum wind speed was relatively high was 1.23 (95% CI, 1.003-1.50) (not shown in figure) .
