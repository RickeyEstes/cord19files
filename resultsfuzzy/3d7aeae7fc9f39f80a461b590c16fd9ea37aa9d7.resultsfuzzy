In order to compare the HPAI and LPAI infections in the trachea using our microarray, new tracheal explants were infected with either strains (HPAI or LPAI) and RNA were extracted and processed for microarray experiment as described in Materials and methods section. Sixteen microarrays were hybridised allowing four replicates for each experimental condition: 4 microarrays for each time point of the experiment (4 and 8 h p.i.) and for each strain (LPAI and HPAI). After normalisation of the raw data, we performed a first statistical analysis by comparing signals obtained with probes corresponding to infected tracheas (HPAIor LPAI-infected) versus signals obtained with probes corresponding to mock-infected tracheas. For this purpose, SAM software was used and results were considered for a calculated false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%. SAM plot results are presented in Figure 2A and B. At 4 h p.i., 49 spots were up-regulated and 148 spots were down-regulated in LPAI-infected tracheas whereas 36 spots were up-regulated but 0 down regulated genes in HPAI-infected tracheas (Figure 2A and B, left panel). At 8 h p.i., number of differentially expressed sequences significantly increased (Figure 2A and B, right panel). In LPAI-infected tracheas, 368 sequences were up-regulated and 493 sequences were down-regulated. In HPAIinfected tracheas, 175 sequences were up-regulated and 222 were down-regulated. This first SAM analysis gave us the difference in between infected samples compared to mock-infected ones. In a second approach, we performed a statistical analysis comparing the signals obtained with probes from HPAI-infected tracheas to signals obtained with probes from LPAI-infected tracheas. Such a comparison was possible as the reference sample used for the baseline was generated with the same pool of mock-infected duck mRNA. Results are presented in Figure 2C . A FDR fixed around 5% gave a very low number of significant differentially expressed spots between HPAI and LPAI samples: 8 down-regulated and 5 up-regulated at 4 h p.i. and 65 down-regulated and 19 up-regulated at 8 h p.i. for HPAI as compared to LPAI.
