We quantify the ability of our method to correctly identify clusters of cases linked by transmission, through measuring 1) the true positive rate (TPR, proportion of pairs of cases actually linked by transmission who are inferred to be in the same outbreak cluster), i.e. the sensitivity of detecting a transmission link and 2) the true negative rate (TNR, proportion of pairs of cases not linked by transmission who are inferred to not be in the same outbreak cluster), i.e. the specificity of detecting a transmission link. We also compare the estimates of the reproduction number and importation rate to the values used in the simulation. A summary of the results of our simulation study are shown in the main text in Figure 5 . S10 Fig shows the full estimates of the reproduction number and importation rate, i.e. central estimates as well as 95% confidence intervals. S11 Fig presents the root mean square error on the estimates of the reproduction number and the importation rate for all simulation and reconstruction scenarios considered, and suggests that estimates were precise across all scenarios.
