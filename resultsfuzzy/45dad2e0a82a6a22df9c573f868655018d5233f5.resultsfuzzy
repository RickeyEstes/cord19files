As an initial assessment of data collected during July 1998 through August 2001, WHO retrospectively verifi ed 578 outbreaks, of which 56% were initially picked up and disseminated by GPHIN (9) . Outbreaks were reported in 132 countries, demonstrating GPHIN's capacity to monitor events occurring worldwide, despite the limitation of predominantly English (with some French) media sources. One of GPHIN's earliest achievements occurred in December 1998, when the system was the fi rst to provide preliminary information to the public health community about a new strain of infl uenza in northern People's Republic of China (20) . During the SARS outbreak, declared by WHO in March 2003, the GPHIN prototype demonstrated its potential as an early-warning system by detecting and informing the appropriate authorities (e.g., WHO, Public Health Agency of Canada) of an unusual respiratory illness outbreak occurring in Guangdong Province, China, as early as November 27, 2002 . GPHIN was further able to continuously monitor and provide information about the number of suspected and probable SARS cases reported worldwide on a near real-time basis. GPHIN's information was â‰ˆ2-3 days ahead of the offi cial WHO report of confi rmed and probable cases worldwide. In addition to outbreak reporting, GPHIN has also provided information that enabled public health offi cials to track global effects of the outbreak such as worldwide prevention and control measures, concerns of the general public, and economic or political effects. GPHIN is used daily by organizations such as WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the UN Food and Agricultural Organization. HealthMap processes an average of 133. 5 Most alerts come from news media (92.8%), followed by ProMED (6.5%) and multinational agencies (0.7%). Built on open-source software components, EpiSPI-DER has been operational since January 2006. In response to feedback from users, additional custom data feeds have been incorporated, both topic oriented (by disease) and format specifi c (KML, RSS, GeoRSS), as has semantic annotation using UMLS concept codes. For example, the EpiSPIDER KML module was developed to enable the US Directorate for National Intelligence to distribute avian infl uenza event-based reports in Google Earth KML format to consumers worldwide and also to enable an integrated view of ProMED and World Animal Health Information Database reports. EpiSPIDER is used by persons in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia, and it receives 50-90 visits/hour, originating from 150-200 sites and representing 30-50 countries worldwide. EpiSPIDER has recorded daily visits from the US Department of Agriculture, US Department of Homeland Security, US Directorate for National Intelligence, US CDC, UK Health Protection Agency, and several universities and health research organizations. In the latter half of 2008, daily access to graphs and exhibits surpassed access to data feeds. EpiSPIDER's semantically linked data were also used for validating syndromic surveillance information in OpenRODS (http://openrods. sourceforge.net) and populating disease detection portals, like www.intelink.gov and the Research Triangle Institute (Research Triangle Park, NC, USA).
