Results were expressed as the log10 of the cytokine mRNA/G3PDH mRNA ratio. Each cDNA sample represented a single time point for an individual cat. Where cats were considered in groups, these values were averaged and the standard deviation calculated. When graphed the log 10 of the cytokine mRNA/G3PDH mRNA ratio was adjusted to zero at the start of the experiment, and all later values expressed as changes relative to that time point. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA with Bonferroni's post test. The relationship between OD and the concentration of the PCR product was analysed using Pearson's correlation coefficient.
