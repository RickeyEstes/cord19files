Comparison of the GC content and genome size distribution with other viruses Genome sizes of viruses range from a few hundred base pairs to a few hundred thousand base pairs (Figure 1 ). According to their genome sizes, the 2,498 virus isolates can be classified as three groups. The first group, also the smallest group corresponding to the low part of the figure, represents the viroids. The range of genome sizes of this group is between 120 bp (Avocado sunblotch viroid; NCBI accession number: AF404074) and 374 bp (Citrus exocortis viroids, NCBI accession number: N30870). The range of the GC content is between 35.5% (Avocado sunblotch viroid; genome size: 248 bp; NCBI accession number: AF404068) and 61.1% (Grapevine yellow speckle viroid 1; genome size: 365 bp; NCBI accession number: AF462165). Here, the two isolates of AF404068 and AF404074 demonstrate the sequence diversity of viroid genomes. Although they are only different isolates of Avocado sunblotch viroid, the difference of their genome sizes is still great. The third group, also the largest group corresponding to the middle part of the figure, is the most complicated one that includes all other kinds of viruses. The SARS-CoV belongs to this group. From the figure, it is easy to see that the GC content and genome size of the SARS-CoV are normal.
