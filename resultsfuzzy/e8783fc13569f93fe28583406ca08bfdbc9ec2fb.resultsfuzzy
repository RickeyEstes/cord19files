In all animals, the acellular matrix graft remained in its original position without evidence of incrustation or infection, and histologic examination showed complete epithelialization and progressive infiltration by vessels. At 10 weeks, smooth muscle fibers were observed; at 12 weeks, nerve fibers were first detected; at 4 months, smooth muscle cells had assumed regular configuration. Conclusions. The ureteral acellular matrix graft appears to promote the regeneration of all ureteral wall components. U reteral replacement has long been a subject of interest to researchers, and many surgical procedures and materials have been tried.le4 However, an entirely satisfactory method has yet to be found. Previous research has demonstrated that collagen-based materials, such as porcine small intestine submucosa (SIS), have the best potential regenerative capability.5 In this group of biomaterials, a new acellular matrix has recently been shown, in the bladder of the rat model, to serve as a scaffold consisting of collagen and elastin fibers for the ingrowth of all bladder wall components.6'7 In addition, the contractility of graftregenerated bladders has been observed in vivo (preliminary results). We designed the present study to determine whether this acellular matrix could be used as a free ureteral graft in a rat model. and the skin were closed.
