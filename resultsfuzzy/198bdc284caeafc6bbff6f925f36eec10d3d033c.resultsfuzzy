In order to reduce the risk of batch-to-batch variations for controlled experiments under different cultivation regimes, we established a parallel continuous production process for IAV propagated in MDCK suspension cells. In the set-up implemented, one cell bioreactor was used to feed two virus vessels (Figure 1) . As a starting point, we investigated the impact of RT (22 and 36 h) on the accumulation of DIPs and their impact on viral titers over a period of 20 days. Based on quantitative information available from qPCR and the mathematical model established, it is possible to describe the dynamics of the various cell populations as well as virus populations, i.e., infectious STVs, non-infectious STVs and replication-incompetent DIPs, and the DIP to STV ratio for both cultivation conditions.
