On Dec 19, The Lancet 1 posted the papers of the six fi nalists for paper of the year 2008 on our website and published Profi les from each research team. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] After 25 days of voting, during which 21 556 votes (each from a unique IP address) were cast, three papers have proved clear favourites with readers (panel). Among these, the editors' choice was Werner Hacke and colleagues' study of alteplase for ischaemic stroke 8 and the people's choice was the PEACE study of carbocisteine in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by Nan-Shan Zhong and associates. 9 What do these results tell us about research and readers in 2008? First, well-designed, imaginative studies that have the ability to change practice and benefi t large populations are highly valued by the medical community. Such trials deserve the support of collaborators, funders, and journals, and should be the benchmark for future investi gations. Second, sound design and appropriate settings are essential to convince clinicians and policy makers that interventions are eff ective. Each of these studies was a multicentre randomised trial in populations and settings appropriate for the intervention. Third, public health and global health matter. These studies provide new strategies for tackling large and important burdens of disease. Hacke and colleagues 8 extend the time-window for treatment of stroke, the most common cause of adult disability in the world. 10 The fourth Millennium Development Goal is a reduction by two-thirds in mortality between 2000 and 2015 for children aged less than 5 years. In Bangladesh, neonatal mortality accounts for 45% of the mortality in children in this age band. 11 The Projahnmo Study Group, led by Abdullah Baqui, reports a complex intervention that decreased neonatal mortality by one-third. 11 Such eff orts have helped to reduce annual worldwide mortality in under-5-year-olds from nearly 13 million in 1990 to less than 10 million in 2007. 12 Cigarette consumption in China exceeded 2000 billion in 2006 and is increasing. 13 In addition, indoor cooking fi res are common in rural areas. As a result of these risk factors, COPD is predicted to cause 65 million deaths in China between 2003 and 2033. 14 Hence, the work of Zhong and colleagues showing that carbocisteine can reduce exacerbations and improve quality of life at a relatively modest price has important implications for treating COPD in developing countries. Fourth, research has become a global enterprise, with papers from Bangladesh, China, and Germany competing at the highest level. As emphasised in The Lancet Series on health-system reform in China, 15 the importance of science from Asia will continue to grow as researchers increasingly turn to the region for larger, faster, and less expensive high-quality studies. Finally, each of these interventions underscores a failure in preventive health. Alteplase and carbocisteine are no surrogates for life-style changes to reduce risk factors for stroke and for COPD; just as community health workers
