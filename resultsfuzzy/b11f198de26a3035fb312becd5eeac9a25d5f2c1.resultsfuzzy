The performance of VIDISCA-454 in feces was investigated using broth suspensions from a sample-bank collected from HIV-1 infected individuals in 1994 and 1995 [8] . A norovirus infection was diagnosed in five people via real time RT-PCR [9] , the viral load in feces suspension ranged between 5 × 10 3 and 3 × 10 7 genome copies/mL. VIDISCA-454 was performed as described previously for respiratory material [6] , thus no extra purification methods like filtration were performed. In total, 22,661 sequences were obtained for these five patients and 225 of them were noroviral sequences. These sequences were present in the reads from three out of five positive patients. The three VIDISCA-454 positive samples had a viral load of 2.5 × 10 7 , 3.0 × 10 7 and 2.5 × 10 6 genome copies/mL, and 103 out of 5,301, 121 out of 4,909, and 1 out of 3,317 sequences were from noroviruses respectively (percentages are shown in Figure 1 ). The two samples which were negative had lower copy numbers, 5 × 10 4 and 5 × 10 3 genome copies/mL, and no norovirus sequence was detectable in the 4,160 and 4,974 reads respectively. Subsequently, the background sequences were examined to determine the source of the background. Surprisingly, hardly any known sequence acts as main competitor: about 80% of the reads are "no-hits". No-hits are sequences with good quality and an average length that share no recognizable homology with known sequences of the non-redundant NCBI database. The remaining 20% mainly consisted of bacterial sequences, probably originating from the gut microbiota. The performance of VIDISCA in blood products was investigated with sera from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected persons (n = 54). The viral load varied between 1.5 × 10 2 and 1 × 10 6 , with a mean of 5.6 × 10 4 RNA copies/mL. In total 278,944 VIDISCA-454-reads were retrieved, and 178 of them were HIV sequences. The 178 sequences originated from 36 out of 54 samples (65%). The samples in which HIV-1 was not detected by VIDISCA-454 had low HIV-1 copy numbers (range 2 × 10 3 and 1.8 × 10 4 ; mean 5.4 × 10 3 RNA copies/mL), whereas the VIDISCA-454 positive samples ranged in viral load between 2 × 10 3 and 1 × 10 6 (mean 8.3 × 10 4 ). The plot with the percentage of viral hits in comparison to the viral load is shown in Figure 1 . It illustrates a trend: an increased percentage of viral sequences with higher viral loads. For comparison, the relationship between viral load and percentage viral sequences for respiratory material and fecal material is also included in Figure 1 , and we observe that, in general, serum samples and respiratory samples have the same performance. For respiratory material, the background in VIDISCA-454 mainly consists of human ribosomal RNA (rRNA). In serum, the background is primarily of eukaryotic origin (33%), probably originating from human DNA, and only 9.5% of all sequences were from rRNA. Furthermore, a substantial amount of sequences were detected that originate from VIDISCA ingredients (vectors that produce the enzymes, etc.). This shows that the material is relatively clean and requires no further purification. We can exclude the possibility that the vectors were introduced in the clinical sample in our laboratory since most of the encountered vectors were never used. , and respiratory copan-collected swabs (▲). On the X-axis the viral load in a clinical sample is indicated, on the Y-axis the percentage of viral sequence reads: HIV-1 (blood), norovirus (stool), coronaviruses, adenoviruses, picornaviruses and influenzaviruses (respiratory material). The viruses and percentages in the respiratory samples have been published previously [6] .
