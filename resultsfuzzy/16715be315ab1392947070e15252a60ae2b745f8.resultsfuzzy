Recently, there have been encouraging developments regarding HIV vaccination. In the 1980s, in Thailand, there was a substantial increase in the prevalence of infection with HIV-1. [254] [255] [256] By first observation, these groups consisted of intravenous-drug users and commercial sex workers; this infected group then expanded to the general population. 101 By the mid 1990s, the overall seroprevalence of HIV-1 reached a peak of 3.7% among members of the Royal Thai Army and of 12.5% among people from Northern Thailand. 255, 257 The Thai Ministry of Public Health acted by starting an effective HIV-prevention campaign. With this effort, the number of new HIV-1 infections per year decreased from an estimated 143,000 in 1990 to 14,000 in 2007. 255, [258] [259] [260] Although this decrease was promising, there was still a desire to do more to prevent HIV infection. To achieve this goal, an HIV Phase III study was begun. The Thai Phase III HIV vaccine study, also known as RV144, opened in the fall of 2003. The placebo-controlled trial tested the safety and effectiveness of a prime-boost regimen of two vaccines: ALVAC-HIV vaccine (the prime), a modified canarypox vaccine, and AIDSVAX B/E vaccine (booster), a gp 120 vaccine. The vaccines were based on the subtype E and B HIV-1 strains that commonly circulate in Thailand. The subtype B HIV-1 strain is the most commonly found strain in the United States. The trial, conducted in the Chonburi and Rayong provinces of Thailand, enrolled 16,402 women and men aged 18-30 years at various levels of risk for HIV infection. Study participants received the placebo or ALVAC HIV vaccine at enrollment and again after 1, 3,
