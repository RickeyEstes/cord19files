R 0 , the so-called basic reproductive (reproduction) number of a communicable disease, defined as the expected number of secondary infectious cases generated by one typical primary case in an entirely susceptible and sufficiently large population (Anderson and May [1] ), is a key for controlling the epidemic spread. For instance, the general guideline for mass vaccination is that the herd immunity of a population against the disease must be above some critical immunization threshold q c that is a function of R 0 and some other factors like vaccine efficacy. A very simple but illustrative choice of such a critical immunization threshold is q c ¼ 1 À 1=R 0 , used in the traditional theory of epidemiology [1] under the unrealistic assumption (Benenson [3] , CDC [6] ) that the vaccine is perfectly effective. Although epidemiologists and theoreticians ( [3, 6] , Halloran et al. [24, 25] , Longini et al. [41] ) have been aware of this for a long time, no confident relation between the critical immunization threshold q c and the vaccine efficacy was drawn. It gives rise to the need of establishing more realistic epidemic models for the mass vaccination theory. A further motivation for establishing new epidemic models is the estimation of the basic reproductive number R 0 . As shown by the very recent case of the 2002-2003 epidemic SARS (Donnelly et al. [15] , Lipsitch et al. [36] , Riley et al. [53] , Bauch et al. [2] ), an accurate estimation of R 0 is essential for a successful control of newly emerging diseases by the public heath control measures. A large number of compartmental (both deterministic and stochastic) epidemic models (Anderson and May [1] , Hethcote [28] , Diekmann and Heesterbeek [14] ) have been proposed for this purpose (see Heffernan et al. [27] for a comprehensive review). But most of these models rely on the traditionally used assumption that both transmission processes of latency and recovery states are exponentially distributed. This assumption is biologically unrealistic, because it corresponds to assuming that such a transmission process is memoryless in the sense that the chance of change from a state 'A' to another state 'B' in a given time interval is independent of the time since the entrance into the previous state 'A'. More realistic distributions are, for example, the gamma or the log-normal distributions (Sartwell [54] ). However, the inclusion of gamma distributions, as shown by Lloyd [38, 39] and Wearing et al. [59] , could change drastically the patterns and dynamics of the epidemic models, as well as the estimate of the basic reproductive number R 0 . In this work, we will present (in Section 2) a new SEIR (susceptible-exposure-infective-recovered) epidemic model, which covers the classical SEIR model (Hethcote [28] ) as a special case and has the following advantage than most of the known mathematical epidemic models: our new SEIR model is suitable for the aim of incorporating epidemiological factors like the vaccine efficacy and the varying of transmission patterns into the model settings. Hence, it is reasonable to expect that our new SEIR model fits better to reality. Below we highlight the following three results obtained by our new SEIR model: a novel theory for the eradication of diseases by mass vaccination, a refined theory for the control of newly emerging diseases by the public heath control measures of isolating infectious individuals combined with contact tracing and quarantining suspected individuals, and four formulas for calculating the basic reproductive number R 0 . For simplicity, we assume as usual that the population under discussion is homogeneously mixed.
