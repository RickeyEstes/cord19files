Recombinant MERS-CoV PL pro preparation To date, there are still no studies describing the expression and purification of MERS-CoV PL pro proteins. In the present study, the expression vector was constructed and then various E. coli. strains such as BL21 (DE3) STAR (Invitrogen) and Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen) were used to explore heterologous expression of MERS-CoV PL pro . Finally, it was found that the STAR strain showed the best expression efficiency. After expressing the protein in E. coli and purification by nickel affinity chromatography and gel-filtration, the purity of recombinant PL pro was about 99% ( Figure 1A ). The size of the recombinant MERS-CoV PL pro was found to be between 30 and 45 kDa, which conforms to the theoretical mass (36.5 kDa). The typical yield was about 42 mg after purification from 0.8 liter of E. coli culture (Table 1) . After gel-filtration chromatography, the specific proteolytic activity of PL pro was 4 U/mg, increased by 5-fold, with 49.4% recovery rate. Furthermore, the recombinant MERS-CoV PL pro was digested by trypsin and then analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry to confirm the amino acid sequence (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). The molecular weight of fifteen peptides, which covered 60% amino acid sequence, was observed and confirmed ( Figure 1B and Figure 1C ). It indicated that our expression and purification of MERS-CoV PL pro by E. coli is successful. For convenience, in the present studies, the MERS-CoV PL pro domain (polyprotein 1a 1484-1800) is numbered to residue 2 to 317, while the first residue is a methionine. Secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure analysis of MERS-CoV PL pro Next, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures of MERS-CoV PL pro were investigated, respectively. CD measurement displayed a spectrum which shows negative ellipticity between 240 and 205 nm and positive between 205 and 190 nm (Figure 2 ). After analyzed by CDSSTR method [16] , the best-fit result showed that MERS-CoV PL pro has 23% of α-helix, 31% of β-sheet, and 46% of random coil. The consist is close to that of SARS-CoV PL pro (pdb code: 4M0W) by X-ray crystallography, which has 26% of α-helix, 36% of β-sheet, and 38% of random coil [12] . It suggests that both PL pro may have a similar scaffold. The Tyr/Trp fluorescence of MERS-CoV PL pro at the phosphate buffer without or with 9 M urea were also identified ( Figure 3 ). The measurement indicated that the fluorescent intensity of native PL pro (Figure 3 , close circles) shows a 70% increase, as compared with that of the denatured form in urea (Figure 3, open circles) . On the other hand, the fluorescence emission spectrum of the native MERS-CoV PL pro shows a maximum at 336 nm, while that of the unfolded one shifts to 340 nm. The tendency is similar to that of SARS-CoV PL pro [19] and suggests a folded structure. Next, we also performed AUC experiments to characterize the quaternary structure of MERS-CoV PL pro . Figure 4A shows a typical absorbance trace at 280 nm of the PL pro during the experiment. After fitting the signals to a continuous size-distribution model, it was clear that the PL pro was monomeric with a sedimentation coefficient of 2.8 S and molar mass of 35.5 kDa ( Figure 4B and Figure 4C ), consistent with that for SARS-CoV PL pro [12, 19] . All of these biophysical observation confirmed that the PL pro of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV should have a very similar structure; albeit they only show 30% sequence identity and 50% similarity [12] . Recent studies hypothesized that the homology model of MERS-CoV PL pro , like other coronaviral PL pro , is a right-handlike architecture consisting of palm, thumb and fingers domains [10, 25] .
