The most important etiologic agents for URTD that are prevalent in cats include FHV-1, feline calicivirus and Chlamydia [1, [15] [16] [17] . Identification of the particular agents in URTD is essential for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of individual infections and corresponding clinical management. RPA assays have been explored for molecular diagnosis of diverse pathogens [10] [11] [12] [13] . In this study, an exo-RPA assay was developed for rapid and specific detection of FHV-1. Specificity analysis showed that only FHV-1 DNA was positively amplified (Fig 1) . In contrast, feline calicivirus, Chlamydia psittaci and other viruses commonly seen in cats, i.e., FPV, BHV-1, PRV, were all tested negative (Fig 1) . These results were reproducible in 5 independent reactions, demonstrating high specificity of the exo-RPA assay for FHV-1 detection. Different copy numbers of pMD19-T-TK plasmid DNA were assayed by exo-RPA and realtime PCR. As shown in Fig 2A, the detection limit of the exo-RPA method was 10 2 copies/ reaction. Real-time PCR also had a detection limit of 10 2 copies/reaction (Fig 2B) . Thus, in terms of assay sensitivity, these data suggest that exo-RPA is comparable to real time PCR. The co-efficient of variations from 5 independent reactions (10 2 copies of template) was demonstrated in Table 1 , showing high reproducibility for both real time PCR and the RPA assay. A total of 120 clinical samples were tested by exo-RPA and real-time PCR. The results showed a complete diagnostic agreement between RPA and real time PCR (47 positive and 73 negative as shown by both methods). Reubel et al described a conventional PCR assay for FHV-1 detection [18] . They used agarose gel electrophoresis together with ethidium bromide staining to visualize the PCR product and observed that as low as 3x10 3 copies of FHV-1 genomic DNA could be detected. Weigler et al developed a real time PCR method for FHV-1 detection, which had a detection limit of 240 copies of FHV-1 DNA [7] , in line with our results obtained with real time PCR and the RPA assay. Compared with real time PCR, RPA has several advantages. First, RPA reactions are done at a constant temperature, requiring less-complex instrument. Secondly, RPA reactions are usually completed in 10-20 min, much faster than real time PCR that often takes > 60 min. Thirdly, commercial RPA reagents in vacuum-sealed pouches can tolerate temperatures up to room temperature for days without loss of activity (http://www.twistdx.co. uk/images/uploads/docs/TA01cmanual_Combined_Manual_RevI.pdf), eliminating the need of complex shipment and storage containers, which is convenient and fitting for field performance of rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests. Lastly, it has been shown that RPA primers and probes carrying 5-9 base pair mismatches do not influence the performance of RPA reactions [13, 19] , while such base pair mismatches can cause real-time PCR small probes to fail [20] . With the development of portable devices specifically designed for out-door use, e.g., Genie III Instrument, which are light and incorporate a rechargeable battery that can support operation for a complete day, the RPA assay developed in this study could become a useful tool for field diagnostic tests of FHV-1 infection. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the development of an RPA assay for the detection of FHV-1. In conclusion, the RPA assay is a simple, fast and cost-effective alternative to real time PCR for specific detection of FHV-1.
