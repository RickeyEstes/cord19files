Figs. 4 and 5 show the feature scores extracted from the frequency domain signals and the second level of the wavelet coefficients, respectively. According to Fig. 4 , there is a significant distance between F 5 and F 1 , so the threshold was set at 0.5. Therefore, 5 features were selected as the best sound features in frequency domain. According to Fig. 5 , there is a significant distance between F 9 and F 34 , so the threshold was 0.6. Accordingly, 5 features were selected as the best sound features (F 33 , F 7 , F 32 , F 2 , and F 9 ). These features were considered to diagnose Newcastle Disease, Bronchitis Virus and Avian Influenza based on chicken's sound. Features 1-25 belong to the approximation coefficients, features 26-50 and 27-75 refer to the first and second levels of the detail coefficients, respectively. As can be seen from the selected features, F 7 , F 2 and F 9 are approximation coefficients, F 33 and F 32 are firstlevel of detail coefficients, and no features were considered from the second-level of the detail coefficients. Therefore, the most important information of the sound signal was hidden in the approximation coefficients and in the first level of the detail coefficients. Time domain of the chicken's sound signals of the four classes of healthy, Newcastle Disease, Bronchitis Virus and Avian Influenza are shown in Fig. 6 . Time domain of the sound signals were transferred to frequency and time-frequency domains using fast Fourier transform and wavelet transform. Fig. 7 shows healthy, Newcastle Disease, Bronchitis Virus and Avian Influenza sound signals in time-frequency domain. The approximation (a2) and details (d2 and d1) of the four classes have some differences, which should be identified.
