Rotavirus and norovirus are beside adenovirus, astrovirus, coronavirus and parechovirus the 2 most common viral agents that cause infantile acute gastroenteritis (AGE). 1,2 Norovirus infections have historically been described as mild and self-limiting. This virus circulates in community environments, and evidence indicates that it is involved in cases of AGE in infants and adults. 2 Norovirus can be genetically divided into 5 genogroups (GI-GV), of which GI, GII, and GIV cause AGE in humans. 3 Norovirus GII has caused global AGE epidemics, and the genotype GII.4 has been predominantly associated with large outbreaks of AGE. 4 The potential severity of norovirus gastroenteritis is still underestimated. To our knowledge this is the first case of gastroenteritis caused by norovirus that presented initially with a severe clinical picture and a clinical course which was complicated by a secondary bacterial septicaemia. This sepsis may be due to bacterial translocation from the damaged intestine due to severe norovirus gastroenteritis. Several cases of secondary bacterial sepsis after rotavirus gastroenteritis have been published so far. Most of these children had an increase of temperature several days after the beginning of diarrhea. 5, 6 The sepsis was caused mostly by Gram-negative bacteria like Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which are normal commensals of the intestine, translocated into the blood due to the damaged intestine. The secondary gastroenteritis due to rotavirus in our case underlines the importance of this virus as a nosocomial pathogens causing significant morbidity in hospitalized children. 1 Recently, also translocation of norovirus from the intestine into the blood has been described by Takanashi et al. 7 Rotavirus is already known to cause viremia and extraintestinal manifestation. [8] [9] [10] The viremia starts at the beginning of the infection and lasts for three days in average. Circulation of norovirus in the blood of our patient may have contributed to the severity of the initial clinical presentation. However, norovirus in the blood of our patient has not been determined. According to a recent report, immunocompetent pediatric patients had a median duration of 16 days of norovirus shedding in stool specimens. 11 This is line with findings in our case during the second hospitalization period where norovirus PCR in the stools was negative 17 days after initial testing. General complications of norovirus infection, which especially occurs in winter seasons, are fever, dehydration, acidosis, low sodium, low potassium, hypoglycemia and headache. [12] [13] [14] Furthermore, norovirus is known to cause peripheral edema caused by hypoalbuminaemia. 14 Rarely, it is associated with CNS symptoms as convulsions and encephalopathy with altered consciousness. 15, 16 Our patient suffered from dehydration, low sodium, reduced potassium, hypoglycemia, elevated cortisol levels and creatinine kinase levels, raised liver enzymes, and impaired blood coagulation, which elaborates the diversity of clinical symptoms. In a recent Spanish prospective study it has been shown that norovirus gastroenteritis affects mainly children under 2 years of age and compared to rotavirus is slightly less severe and fever is less frequent. 17 The genotype GII.4 found in our case is the most prevalent genotype throughout several epidemic seasons during the past 15 years worldwide (1995/96, 2002/2003, 2004/2005, 2006/2007) . 3 The GII.4 strain is known to evolve rapidly by mutation and selection resulting in successive emergence of new variants (indicated by the first year of detection as 1996, 2002, 2004, 2006a, and 2006b ). In Germany, 63-76% of the norovirus outbreaks were caused by II.4 variants 2006a and 2006b during the last three epidemic winter seasons (2006/2007, 2007/2008, and 2008/2009 ). 18, 19 Last year, the emergence of a new variant (II.4 variant 2008) has been reported by several members of the Food-borne Viruses in Europe network (FBVE) (personal communication). 20 The case described here is the first report of an infection caused by the new GII.4 variant in Germany. Recently, a new variant of Norovirus GII.4/2007 and inter-genotype recombinant strains of NVGII causing acute watery diarrhea among children in Kolkata, India, has been described. 21 Since there are not yet sufficient clinical data to ascertain whether the new subtype in our case is more infectious or predestines to a severe clinical course, further clinical and molecular epidemiological studies are needed.
