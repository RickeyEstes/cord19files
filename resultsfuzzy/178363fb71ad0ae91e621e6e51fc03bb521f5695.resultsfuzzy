Overview of the GNE kinase domain monomer The overall structure adopts a typical bi-lobal kinase architecture. Both the N-lobe and the C-lobe have the a/b fold. Each lobe consists of a central b-sheet flanked by a-helices on both sides of the sheet. The last helix C-terminal to the C-lobe is part of the Nlobe and perpendicular to the interfacial helix of the C-lobe. Residues 475-498 of the N-lobe are invisible in the electron density map (Figure 2 ). The GNE kinase domain contains a type I zinc-binding motif GHx 9-11 CxCGx 2 G(C/H)xE, which forms an HC3 type zincfinger with residues H569, C579, C581, C586. The zincbinding motif is a characteristic feature for all ROK family members [14] . The kinase domain also contains a DxGxT type ATP-binding motif [15, 16] . The side chains of this ATPbinding motif residues point toward the cleft between the Nlobe and the C-lobe. Comparison with the actin/hexokinase/ hsp70 ATPase domains suggests that the disordered residues 475-498 form part of the binding pocket for the adenosine moiety of ATP [17] and are located near the DxGxT ATPbinding motif. Taken together, these findings suggest that the ATP binding pocket of the GNE kinase domain is located in the cleft between the two lobes.
