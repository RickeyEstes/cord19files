Significant differences in PBL gene expression patterns were seen in CFP patients compared with controls, with 3285 of 26,831 genes screened having a significance of p < 0.001. Findings are reflected in the principal component analysis shown in Fig. 1 , and the heat map in Fig. 2 . Significant differences in gene expression were not seen when CFP patients with recurrent symptoms were compared with those with only acute symptoms. In assessing differences in patterns of expression of genes/gene pathways, the strongest associations were with genes linked with platelet aggregation (h_ephA4Pathway) and chemokine gene expression (h_fMLPPathway) ( Table 1) . The finding of significant differences in PBL gene expression patterns between patients in the U.S. Virgin Island ciguatera population and a healthy control population from Florida must be approached with caution. It is well recognized that gene expression studies have the potential to yield false positive findings if the ancestry of cases and controls are not appropriately matched, as gene expression can be both heritable and under strong genetic control (Byrnes et al., 2009; Cheung et al., 2005) . In these studies, the majority of the CFP patients came either from the Virgin Islands or neighboring islands in the Caribbean; the controls, in contrast, tended to have Caucasian backgrounds. To confirm the findings, it will be necessary to conduct additional studies, with carefully matched cases and controls. Similarly, failure to find significant differences in gene expression between patients with recurrent and acute ciguatera is of uncertain relevance: acute case numbers, in particular, were small, and blood was drawn, in one instance, 4 months after the initial acute episode. There are also uncertainties regarding the physiologic relevance of the gene pathways that were shown to have significantly different expression patterns. Ciguatoxin, the causative agent for the disease, potentiates voltage-gated sodium channels, with resultant effects on neurons; there is also a suggestion that it has direct, calcium-mediated enterotoxin activity (Fasano et al., 1991) . While relevance to human cases is uncertain, there is one study of gene expression in mouse brains exposed to ciguatoxin in which there was enrichment of expression pathways related to complement and coagulation cascades (Ryan et al., 2010) . Given the clinical similarities between chronic ciguatera and chronic fatigue syndromes, it could be hypothesized that similar physiologic mechanisms were operational in the two syndromes. There was Fig. 1 . A 3D principal component analysis (PCA) plot of the RNA data that characterizes the trends exhibited by the expression profiles of ciguatera fish poisoning (gray) and healthy controls (black). Each dot represents a sample and the shade represents the type of the sample. some overlap with gene pathways identified in patients with chronic fatigue (e.g., ARF1 (Vernon et al., 2002) ; CEACAM family (Kaushik et al., 2005) ; however, more recent studies have raised questions about the relevance of these findings (Byrnes et al., 2009) . Ciguatera remains an important clinical entity in areas where there is high dependence on tropical reef fish for food. Identification of a biomarker for CFP (particularly recurrent or chronic CFP), and/or for CFP susceptibility, would have substantial clinical relevance, both in terms of diagnosis, and as a basis for development of therapeutic interventions. Findings of this preliminary study are intriguing: there is a need to follow-up on these results (with appropriate control populations) and to further explore potential physiologic relevance of the identified gene pathways.
