Atomistic structure of TM domain of Vpu, and features of the lumen of the pore A representation of the channel modeled in a hydrated lipid bilayer is shown in Figure 1 (B). A few pore water molecules can be seen, especially in the bottom half of the pore, towards the Cterminal opening. The channel consists of five helical TM domains held together predominantly by van der Waals forces, with the interface between the helices being formed by nonpolar residues [24] . The channel is wider at the C-terminal end than at the Nterminal end, leading to a relatively greater degree of hydration at this end. The residues Arg30 and Tyr29 at the C-terminal end of the TM domain face the exterior side of the channel, and they stabilize the protein in the lipid bilayer by forming hydrogen bonds with phospholipid headgroups [24] . The sidechain of Arg30 of each of the monomers is also able to form a salt bridge with a Glu28 residue on the adjacent monomer. Although Lys31 is directed towards the interior of the channel, it lies in a region that is sufficiently solvated, so that the residue is shielded from exerting any influence on any ion passing through the channel. The orientation of these residues in the channel is shown in Figure S1 (A). A serine at position 23 faces the lumen of the pore, and it marks the end of the small hydrophilic space at the C-terminal entrance of the channel. Figure 2 (A) shows the serine residue facing the interior of the pentameric channel. The pore is constricted in the middle, which is a largely dehydrated region, owing to the occurrence of hydrophobic residues. The kinetics of ion conduction through the pore is likely to be controlled by this long hydrophobic stretch. Initially, the nature of the pore was investigated by examining the electrostatic representation of the pore-lining residues in the channel shown in Figure 2 (B). In the surface representation, one monomer of Vpu has been omitted in the figure for clarity. The figure shows electronegative regions in red, and electropositive regions in blue. It can be seen that the top and middle region of the channel is constricted and lined entirely by nonpolar residues. Further down the channel, towards the Cterminal end, the pore widens, and the occurrence of a serine residue gives rise to a slightly hydrophilic region. The widening of the pore was shown to be due to the kink around the Ile17 residue (see Figure S1 (B)) [24] , which is in agreement with experimental data [19] . The serine residue can be seen as a red region at the bottom of the channel. The occurrence of such a hydrophilic region is expected to stabilize the permeating ion, thereby assisting ion transport. It follows that the length of the hydrophobic stretch would have been greater in the absence of this serine residue. The serine therefore reduces the effective length of the hydrophobic stretch, and notably, it has been reported previously that the Ser23RLeu mutant of Vpu is inactive towards ion permeation [28] . It is not practical to model events that occur at time scales longer than the ones that are practical with MD simulations. Additionally, insufficient sampling issues preclude calculation of free energies associated with such rare events. Use of umbrella sampling, which applies a harmonic potential along the predetermined reaction coordinate, allows sampling of intermediate states in the process of ion permeation with relatively less difficulty and with significantly less computing time, while at the same time allowing the calculation of the free energy change along the reaction coordinate using methods like WHAM [57] [58] [59] . An important step in employing umbrella sampling is the selection of the reaction coordinate. The axis of the pore has proved to be a valuable reaction coordinate in the study of ion conduction through channels [46] [47] [48] [49] 64, 65] . Using the pore axis as the reaction coordinate, the present study illustrates the energetics and atomistic mechanism of the ion channel activity of Vpu.
