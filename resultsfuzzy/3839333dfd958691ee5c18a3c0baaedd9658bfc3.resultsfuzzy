LANVERS, A., MERTENS, TH., and EGGERS, H. J. There are reports that herpes simplex virus (HSV) could be isolated from the genitourinary tract of up to 15 Ofo of males without manifest herpes. In order to confirm these results we first wanted to establish a method for typing possible HSV isolates. We used 3 published methods: a plaque test in chick embryo cells, a neutralisation test, and the analysis of the early HSV-proteins (SDS-PAGE). All 3 methods yielded identical results. We then tried to isolate HSV from 192 materials of 181 asymptomatic males (89 urethral swabs, 55 seminal fluids, 48 fresh tissue probes). All materials were immediately inoculated into tube cultures of two cell lines shown to be highly HSV-susceptible. Additionally, the tissue probes were co-cultivated with permissive cells. We also induced cell fusion (PEG) in such cocultures. Despite all efforts we did not isolate any virus from all these materials. For an experimental approach to answer the question as to which viral genes may control pathogenesis after peripheral infection of inbred mice with HSV, we have isolated a variant strain (ANG-path) that proved highly neuropathogenic both upon i.p. -or intravaginal infection from the apathogenic strain HSV-1 ANG. Two alterations of the ANG genome have been detected by restriction enzyme analysis: the loss of the amplifiable 500 b.p. nucleotide sequence typical for ANG and a 400 b.p, deletion approximately at the position mapped for the structural viral glyco-protein D. Despite the induction of interferon and NK-cells both variants multiply to a similar extent, probably in the same target cells of the peritoneum. The spread from the peritoneum, spleen, liver, thymus and local lymph nodes to the eNS seems, however, to be controlled by the action of gene products coded for in only one of the variants.
