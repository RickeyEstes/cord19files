* 17 patients from whom more than one organism was isolated have been excluded. Interferon was detected in 9. Sera were diluted 1: 10 and added to cultures of V3 cells which were challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus. The endpoint detected 1 reference unit 69/19 of human leucocyte interferon (IFNa). Interferon was detected in 45% of the children with febrile convulsions, 34% of the adults with influenza, and 15% of the adults with colds. It was found in the sera of 19 of the 65 patients from whom one virus was isolated (table) and from 14 of the 38 in whom a staphylococcus was cultured from the throat or in whom no organisms were found. Interferon is not found in the sera ofhealthy persons by this technique. The number of positive results seems to be related to the severity of the virus infection and also, possibly, to the type of infecting organism. Thus it was positive in half of the influenza and parainfluenza cases, in less than half of the enterovirus and coronavirus infections, and in hardly any of the' adenovirus and rhinovirus infections. The test is usually negative in infections with hepatitis and herpesviruses and always negative in uninfected subjects. The test was nevertheless positive in a substantial number of our patients whose illnesses resembled acute virus infections (such as febrile convulsions, acute gastroenteritis, and respiratory disease) but in whom tests for individual viruses were negative, so we believe the presence of interferon indicated that they had an otherwise unrecognised virus infection, although in some it may have been an infection with Haemophilus spp. The numbers are still small, but indicate to us that tests for serum interferon may be a useful adjunct in detecting infection with viruses, particularly those producing acute and severe disease, and that they may be positive in cases in which thorough diagnostic tests are negative. This approach might be useful when specific antiviral treatments are available and when interferon can be detected rapidly by biological testing4 or by radioimmunoassay using specific monoclonal antibody. SIR,-The observations of Dr Gannaway and Professor Mawer (Jan. 24, p. 217) who successfully transferred ten of eleven chronic epileptic patients from multiple to single drug therapy, accord with our own studies and support our view that there is much unnecessary polytherapy in the treatment of epilepsy. 1-3 In forty patients followed up prospectively for a year before and after cautious reduction of polytherapy we achieved and maintained single drug therapy in 72%. Amongst the latter an improvement in mental side effects occurred in 55% and, more surprisingly, seizure control actually improved in a similar proportion. The main reason for failure to reduce polytherapy was exacerbation of seizures during the difficult withdrawal phase. Further, seizure control in chronic patients is not as good as that which can be achieved with single drug treatment in new referrals with epilepsy.2 2 We have discussed in detail elsewhere3 the reasons that have perpetuated the traditional approach to the treatment of seizures with polytherapy. These include the early age of onset of epilepsy, the poor prognosis of some seizure types, the long-term nature of treatment, the availability of so many different drugs, the poor quality of anticonvulsant trials, the lack of guidelines (other than toxicity) to the limits to drug therapy, and, especially, the tendency to exacerbation of attacks during drug withdrawal. Although there is remarkably little evidence that polytherapy is superior to single drug treatment the problems associated with the former approach are all too apparent, including a wide range of chronic toxic effects and drug interactions, and failure to evaluate the relative merits of individual drugs. Thee is also evidence that polytherapy actually exacerbates seizures in some patients. The availability of blood anticonvulsant drug monitoring has significantly improved the modern pharmacological management of epilepsy.4 It is now possible to achieve good control with single drug therapy in the great majority of new previously untreated patients, provided the drug is taken reliably. In the event of failure of optimum monotherapy for any particular seizure type the benefits of an additional drug, although possible, are in our view still unproven. We doubt if there is any indication for adding a third or more drugs. The problems of chronic patients already on polytherapy are much more difficult to manage, but there is a strong case for rationalisation of therapy to two or even to one drug if possible. However, there are risks involved due to possible exacerbation during the hazardous withdrawal phase, especially in the more brain damaged patient. It is clearly easier to avoid than to reduce poly therapy and we would urge greater emphasis on the former. Amongst many others two particular questions stand out in relation to the pharmacological treatment of epilepsy. What are the limits to the efficacy of drug therapy other than those imposed by toxicity? What is the mechanism of the exacerbation of seizures during drug withdrawal and how can the risks be minimised? These questions are at the heart of the problem of polytherapy in epilepsy. They require urgent investigation because there are great pressures on doctors to add more drugs in the face of continuing seizures, although the evidence of additional benefit is lacking. SIR,-A couple of years ago we noted, in the unpublished tables from the latest decennial supplement on occupational mortality that leather workers in England and Wales had high mortality for motor neurone disease in 1970-72. The observation was based on very few deaths so we went back to the raw data for the previous decennial supplement for 1959-63 to see if these supported our observation. The table below summarises our findings: ' No clustering of cases was found when they were plotted according to last usual residence. Our analysis is based on death certificate diagnosis. However, we are not aware of an association between leather work and motor neurone disease. Preliminary inquiries revealed that many years ago arsenic was widely used in tanning (pre-1914) as were, to a lesser extent, lead and cadmium based pigments; none of these are in common use nowadays.
