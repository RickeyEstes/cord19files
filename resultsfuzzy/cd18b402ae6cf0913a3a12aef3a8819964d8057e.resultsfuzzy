The pig global immune response analysis showed interconnected canonical pathways involved in the regulation of translation and mitochondrial energy metabolism. Biological functions revealed in this meta-analysis were centred around translation regulation, which included protein synthesis, RNA-post transcriptional gene expression and cellular growth and proliferation. Furthermore, the oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondria dysfunctions, associated with stress signalling, were highly regulated. Transcription factors such as MYCN, MYC and NFE2L2 were found in this analysis to be potentially involved in the regulation of the immune response. The host specific response to PRRSV infection engendered the activation of well-defined canonical pathways in response to pathogen challenge such as TREM1, toll-like receptor and hyper-cytokinemia/ hyper-chemokinemia signalling. Furthermore, this analysis brought forth the central role of the crosstalk between innate and adaptive immune response and the regulation of anti-inflammatory response. The most significant transcription factor potentially involved in this analysis was HMGB1, which is required for the innate recognition of viral nucleic acids. Other transcription factors like interferon regulatory factors IRF1, IRF3, IRF5 and IRF8 were also involved in the pig specific response to PRRSV infection. (  Heterogeneity of gene expression data used in pig global immune response: microarrays chip platforms, challenge systems and pig tissues/cells We collected all publicly available microarray datasets that corresponded to pig immune response studies. The data were very heterogeneous (Additional file 1: Table S1 ) in term of chip platforms (e.g., Affymetrix, Qiagen, Operon, custom array), pathogens (e.g., PRRSV, Pseudorabies, Streptococcus suis), infected tissues (e.g., spleen, lung, kidney, pulmonary alveolar macrophages), and pig breeds (Landrace, Large White, Pietrain, Duroc and Wild boar). 29 microarray datasets that corresponded to 809 chips were considered in this study. Datasets quality checking identified 30 chips to be of insufficient quality for meta-analysis. Thus, for the pig global immune response, we used 779 chips that corresponded to 29 datasets; and for the pig response to PRRSV infection, we used 279 chips obtained from 6 datasets (Additional file 1: Table S1 ).
