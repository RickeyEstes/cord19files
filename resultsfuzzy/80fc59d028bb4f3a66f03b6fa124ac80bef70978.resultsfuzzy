in the young adult might lead to recruitment of cross-memory phenotype, but, as a consequence of crossreactivity, viral infections leave mice with much higher reactive T cells and altered disease pathology.  


Section:during mcmv infection of influenza a-immune mice there is a dramatic alteration of early cytokine profiles in the lung, as measured by rnase protection assay, with enhanced proinflammatory cytokines il-6, il-12, and il-1, as well as ifn‚ê•. influenza a-immune mice have essentially normal lung architecture, with only mild residual scaring (ii). mcmv infection of naive mice results in mild mononuclear infiltrates (i), but mcmv infection in influenza a-immune mice results in a severe mononuclear pneumonia (iii) with evidence of bronchiolization (iv).
