Be Developed for a Safe Antiviral Drug. The antiviral activity test showed that KIOM 198 has a remarkable ability to inhibit coronavirus propagation. Next, we investigated the toxicity of KIOM 198 using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay in Vero cells and MTT assay in mouse primary liver cells. Vero cells were lysed, mixed with 20 fold-diluted herbal extract, and the activity was measured using substrate. Figure 4 represents the cytotoxicity result of 27 antiviral herbal extracts in Vero cells. The extent of cytotoxicity of KIOM 198 is close to nothing, compared to other herbal extracts. And, when we checked the cytotoxicity of KIOM 198 on mouse liver primary cells, in the presence of 1.5 mg/mL, cell viability was more than 90% (Figure 4(b) ). These data suggest KIOM 198 could be a safe and nontoxic drug when it is used for antiviral therapy. 198, the intestine of piglet was free of disease symptom ( Figure 5(b) , right panel) compared to intestine of control pigs, which was thinned and filled with diarrheal material ( Figure 5(b) , left panel). Furthermore, we compared viral replications in the piglets, at 24 h, 48 h postinfection, and on necropsy. As shown in Figure 5 (c), no virus was detected in the feces of piglet dieted with KIOM 198 at 24 h postinfection. From 48 h of postinfection, viral number in the KIOM 198-dieted piglets was increased, but it was still 10-fold lower than control group. Taken together these results, KIOM 198 has strong inhibitory effect on PED viral growth in the pigs.
