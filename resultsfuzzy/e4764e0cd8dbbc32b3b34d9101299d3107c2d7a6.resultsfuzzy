Western blot experiments were performed for results validation. The results indicated that sera from terminal cancer patients showed obvious chemiluminescent lanes of SAA, while SAA could not be detected in sera from healthy controls when using the same volume of serum. Furthermore, the SAA protein abundance revealed by western blot was consistent with the MALDI-TOF-MS profiles for the corresponding samples (Fig. 5) .
