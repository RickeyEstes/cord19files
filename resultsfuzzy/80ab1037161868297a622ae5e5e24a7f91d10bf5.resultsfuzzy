The maximized likelihood provides a first quantitative answer to the objective question: 'How likely is it that the stochastic process resulted in the observed epidemic?'. The AIC c [21] is then a related measure of the expected predictive capability of the model that penalizes model complexity. The rescaled AIC c values, presented in figure 3 , allow for an immediate ranking of the competing models and show that the Win mechanism best explains the data. Following the rough rule of thumb of Burnham & Anderson [22] , the AoN hypothesis also receives substantial support (DAIC c 2). In contrast, the 2Vi and Mut models have considerably less support (DAIC c . 7), whereas the InH and PPI models have essentially no support (DAIC c p 10). This rule of thumb has proved to be efficient in many practical situations [22, 23] and can formally be justified by computing the evidence ratio of each competing model (electronic supplementary material, text S3). However, it has also been shown that one should be cautious regarding the systematic use of this rule of thumb when applying AIC corrections [23] , which motivates a more detailed analysis of DAIC c values. First, we identified that the differences in the log likelihoods (and thus AIC c ) accumulate during the inter-wave period, the second epidemic wave and the extinction period after the second wave (figure 4a-e, lower panels). Second, to investigate whether the differences in Figure 2 . The six models with six different reinfection mechanisms can be retrieved by adding to three common skeletons (in black) the transitions corresponding to the indicated colour. All models have five epidemiological states in common: susceptible (S), exposed (E), clinically ill and infectious (I ), temporarily removed from the transmission process (R) and protected in the long-term against reinfection by the same strain (L). To improve biological realism, durations of the states E, I and R are all gamma-distributed (electronic supplementary material, text S1.1). (a) The 2Vi (blue) and Mut (red) models implement a widely used history-based formalism [17, 18] with (i, j) e f1,2g 2 and i = j. Upper index stands for the infective strain, bottom index for the already-immunized strain, l i ¼ b i (I i þ I j i )/N is the force of infection of strain i and both strains are supposed to have the same mean latent, infective and temporary removed periods (electronic supplementary material, text S1.2). Hosts recovered from strain i enter the L i class and become completely protected against reinfection by strain i while remaining susceptible to the other circulating strain j. For the Mut model, the two strains are supposed to have the same transmissibility (b 1 ¼ b 2 , see electronic supplementary material, text S1.2) and to interact through a cross-immunity parameter s e [0,1] that acts by reducing the susceptibility to the other strain (electronic supplementary material, text S1.3). The dashed red arrow indicates that at time T mut if I 1 . 0, one infectious host with the initial strain (i ¼ 1) becomes infectious with the mutated strain ( j ¼ 2). (b,c) For the AoN, PPI, InH and Win models, l ¼ bI/N is the force of infection of the single strain. In the AoN model (red), we assume that hosts acquire full protection against reinfection with probability a, otherwise they re-enter the S class. In the PPI model (blue), we assume that all hosts develop long-term immunity that partially reduces the level of susceptibility through a protection factor s e [0,1]. In the InH model (green), we assume that infected hosts are able to clear the viral load with probability a, otherwise they suffer from an intra-host reinfection and, after some time, re-enter the I state. In the Win model (c), we assume host heterogeneity in the waiting time for acquisition of a completely protective immunity [9] : if some hosts re-enter the transmission process before protection is effective, they fall into a time window of susceptibility to reinfection (W ). We simply assume that all hosts remain in the W state for a duration that is exponentially distributed: this distribution has a positive density in zero, thus enabling some hosts to immediately enter the L class (electronic supplementary material, text S1.4). Parameter descriptions can be found in figure 3 . The transition rates to simulate the six stochastic models are provided in electronic supplementary material, text S1.5. AIC c correspond to visible, practically significant differences in reproducing the characteristic second wave, we performed predictive checks by simulating 10 5 time series under each ML-fitted model. Comparison of the behaviour of the best model (Win) with each competitor reveals superimposed dynamics with the AoN model and confirms that the dynamics of the four other models are different with respect to the second epidemic wave ( figure 4a-e, upper panels) . Furthermore, figure 4f shows that the extinction probability increases rapidly at the end of the first wave for the 2Vi, Mut and PPI models, whereas the Win and AoN models appear to be much more robust to stochastic extinctions during the inter-wave period. In the electronic supplementary material, text S4, we supplement a suite of statistical analyses to evaluate and compare the goodness of fit of these predictive simulations to the characteristic second-wave infection dynamics. Overall, these analyses support the view that, out of the models considered, the Win and AoN models explain the observed time series significantly better. Our predictive simulations emphasize the paramount role of demographic stochasticity in the multiple-wave infection dynamics on this small island. In particular, given the elevated risk of epidemic fade-out during the low-prevalence inter-wave period, we find that only a stochastic framework can accurately assess alternative reinfection hypotheses. Regarding the 2Vi hypothesis, R 0 estimates (figure 3) indicate that the two viruses should have had very different transmissibility (both viruses are supposed to have the same duration of infection). The resulting dynamics reveal that during the first epidemic wave, the highly transmissible virus outcompetes the poorly transmissible virus, which has a 35 per cent risk of extinction owing to ecological interference (electronic supplementary material, text S5). However, if the poorly transmissible virus manages to maintain a low prevalence until the end of the first wave, when the highly transmissible virus goes extinct, then it can initiate the second epidemic wave (electronic supplementary material, figure S8 ). On the other hand, the newly emerging variant in the Mut hypothesis has a 60 per cent chance of early extinction [24] because it has a low effective reproduction number R e 1.7 (electronic supplementary material, text S5) and only one host initially infected. This latter choice can be justified a posteriori: the ML estimated level of antigenic escape is high (s ML 20% ) and similar to that of antigenic cluster transitions occurring each 2-8 years at the scale of the global human population [25, 26] . However, we demonstrate in electronic supplementary material, text S6, that the AIC, the s ML and the risk of extinction are only weakly sensitive to the relaxation of this assumption. The case of the PPI hypothesis is more complicated. A previous analysis of a similar but deterministic model [12] has revealed that dynamics depend on a reinfection parameter sR 0 . When this parameter is well above a reinfection threshold (sR 0 . 1), reinfection becomes selfsustained and dynamics are SIS-like, whereas below this threshold primary infection dominates and leads to SIRlike dynamics. Our stochastic PPI model estimates sR 0 ¼ 1.18 and indicates critical dynamics: the reinfection parameter must be sufficiently high to reduce stochastic extinctions during the inter-wave period, but at the same time it must be sufficiently low to avoid sustained reinfection and therefore more than two epidemic waves. Put another way, epidemic fade-out after the second wave can only be reproduced near the reinfection threshold (sR 0 p1), which simultaneously generates a significant inter-wave extinction probability. The case of the InH hypothesis might seem surprising as its extinction probability remains null all along the epidemic. This result is in fact straightforward since reinfection in this model does not depend on a contact process and is not subject to demographic stochasticity. This reinfection mechanism is therefore very robust to the small population size but interestingly it is not supported by the statistical comparisons. This emphasizes the sensitivity and accuracy of our ML approach regarding the shape and the dynamics of the incidence time series (figure 4d). Finally, it is remarkable that the two best models perform almost equally well despite being based on antagonistic mechanisms. Indeed, the Win hypothesis assumes that 100 per cent of the infected hosts can be reinfected during a limited period lasting an average of 4.8 days, whereas the AoN hypothesis assumes that only 47 per cent of the infected hosts can be reinfected at any time. This superimposed dynamics is in fact specific to the epidemiological context of TdC and we show in electronic supplementary material, text S7, that the dynamics of these two models would differ both qualitatively and quantitatively in the epidemiological context of a large population. Win models (around 10), slightly lower for the PPI model, but more than twice as high for the InH model owing to an identifiability issue (electronic supplementary material, text S8). Overall, these high values for R 0 are somewhat unusual: R 0 is typically estimated around 2 for influenza, although exceptional cases have also been reported in closed populations [27] . We contend that a high value of R 0 as well as rapid spread (the first peak was reached after only 6 days) and a high attack rate (96%) can be expected in small, isolated communities [28] without pre-existing immunity [29] . Furthermore, estimates of the effective reproductive number from the TdC incidence time series [30] are in agreement with our estimates of R 0 (electronic supplementary material, text S9). The generation time (average time between primary and secondary cases) can be estimated by the sum of the mean latent period plus half the mean duration of infectiousness [31] . ML estimates under the two best models are 3.2 days (Win) and 3.3 days (AoN) and in agreement with those previously published for A/H3N2 [32] . Recently, Mathews et al. [11] fitted a deterministic model (similar to the AoN model) on the same dataset. Their parameter estimates were very close to our values except for R 0 (6.44 versus 11.27) and for the mean latent (1.36 versus 2.07 days) and infective (0.98 versus 2.44 days) periods. We suggest that this discrepancy is mainly attributable to the incorporation of demographic stochasticity in our approach. Indeed, deterministic models neglect the probability of stochastic extinction and should implicitly underestimate the above parameters that play a significant role during the inter-wave period (electronic supplementary material, figure S9 ). The estimate of the proportion of the total cases that were reported in the data, r, is 70 per cent under all models. As expected, this value is under the empirical threshold of 85 per cent owing to data uncertainties ( §2a) and the remaining discrepancy can easily be explained by undetected asymptomatic cases [11, 32] . Variation of the mean temporary removed period from one model to another is expected since interpretation of the R state depends on the reinfection mechanism considered (electronic supplementary material, text S1.1). In particular, ML estimates under the two best models are 13.61 days (Win) and 11.57 days (AoN) and in agreement with the duration of the short-term, cell-mediated protection, as we now discuss. (c) Immunological support for reinfection Our results suggest that heterogeneity among hosts (e.g. in the timely development of protective immunity) is a significantly more likely explanation for 1971's two-wave influenza outbreak on TdC than viral heterogeneity (e.g. in antigenic type). This suggestion finds empirical support in known mechanisms of immunity to influenza. In particular, both the Win and AoN mechanisms might be explained in light of genetic and/or ecological determinants of susceptibility. A multi-pronged innate [33] and adaptive [34] immune response is optimal for clearing influenza infection. The innate response is the first to be activated and plays a key role through its ability to control early viral replication and to promote and regulate the virus-specific adaptive immune response [33] . Cytokines are among the most important bridges between the innate and adaptive responses to influenza [35] . The adaptive response itself may be broken into two critical sub-components: (i) the cellular immune response by which antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) eliminate infected cells and thus prevent viral release, and (ii) the humoral immune response by which serum antibodies efficiently neutralize the virus (both of which are promoted by T-cell help [34] ). Antibodies can remain detectable for years after infection and prevent reinfection by the same strain as well as by sufficiently cross-reactive variants [36] . Genetic variation in any of these immune components might determine whether or how rapidly an individual develops protective immunity following primary influenza infection (in keeping with the AoN or Win hypotheses, respectively). It is important to note that during primary influenza infection, the innate and cellular responses play the key role in viral clearance whereas neutralizing antibodies are generated later and do not play a significant role unless the viral load is high/sustained [37] . The primary CTL response is detectable in blood after 6-14 days whereas the neutralizing antibody response peaks at four to six weeks [38] . Critically, the CTL response is downregulated after viral clearance [37] , disappears by day 21 post-infection [38] and is followed by a state of immunological 'memory' with antigen-specific T cells. The memory cells cannot prevent reinfection as well as specific antibodies could, but they can reduce the severity of the disease [37] . Together, these elements support the Win hypothesis: our parameter estimates indicate that the reinfection window occurred 17.8 days (s.d. 6.4 days) post-infection and lasted for 4.8 days (s.d. 4.8 days). This timing of susceptibility is in good agreement with the interval between the completion of CTL contraction and the full development of the neutralizing antibody response. Moreover, the reduced severity of most of the reinfection episodes in TdC ( §2) might be explained by the T-cell 'memory'. In agreement with the AoN hypothesis, it has been reported that a protective serum antibody response cannot be detected in approximately 20 per cent of subjects after natural influenza infection [38] . However, our estimate is much higher and indicates that about 50 per cent of the islanders did not mount a protective response following the first infection. It has been proposed that this lack of protective immunity could be related to a low prior exposure to influenza [11] . Interestingly, the high level of consanguinity among the islanders, together with evidence that genetic bottlenecks occurred in the history of the population [39] , may also have led to the overrepresentation of an unusual genotype involved in the control of influenza. Furthermore, ecological factors including the dose of virus that initiates infection and the time interval between primary and secondary exposure may shape Win or AoN immunity, or indeed may make Win immunity appear as an AoN phenomenon. For example, the amount of virus in the lung determines the multiplicity of infection of innate antigen-presenting cells, which in turn affects their ability to induce subsequent adaptive responses [33] . Additionally, the rate at which immunity to reinfection develops is likely to interact with exposure rates to determine susceptibility. For example, when force of infection is high (as on TdC), many hosts are likely to Explaining rapid influenza reinfections A. Camacho et al. 3641 be re-exposed to virus before their window of susceptibility to reinfection closes. If force of infection is low, then most hosts will have closed that window before re-exposure (electronic supplementary material, text S7).
