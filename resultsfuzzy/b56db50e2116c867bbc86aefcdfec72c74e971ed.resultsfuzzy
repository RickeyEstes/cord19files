After combining the data sets from the two trials, 3591 cases were In the IPD meta-analysis, none of the interaction terms between trial arm and trial ID was significant for any of the outcome variables. Thus, the consistency assumption for the IPD meta-analysis was satisfied. However, a significant interaction was observed between trial ID and hand washing for laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonisation only; therefore, we estimated the RR for trial ID stratified by hand washing. In the similar analysis, the risk of influenza was also lower in medical mask arm compared to control; however, the difference was not statistically significant (RR 0.81 and 95% CI 0.25-2.68) arm. Table 5 compares the results of this analysis with the individual studies.
