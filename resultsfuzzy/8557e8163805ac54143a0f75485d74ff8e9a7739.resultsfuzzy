We also distributed a questionnaire to SPs shortly after the end of the OSCE. The questionnaire included semi-structured questions about their reasons for joining the SP program, and their opinions on students' performance. The responses of SPs are summarized in Appendix 2. Both students and patients stated that being a SP was a worthwhile experience.
