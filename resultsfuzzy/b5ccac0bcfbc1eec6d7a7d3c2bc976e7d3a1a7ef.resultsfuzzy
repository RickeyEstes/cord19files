Such membranes reflect nothing more than the development of granulation tissue along the anterior border layer of the iris in response to increased levels of fibroblastic and angiogenic growth factors within the aqueous humor. Because the anterior border of the iris has no tight junctions, such growth factors are readily absorbed into the iris, where they stimulate microvascular and fibroblastic proliferation and migration from within the iris stroma. Ordinarily, a thin membrane of granulation tissue would have little functional consequence, but within the unforgiving environment of the globe this membrane can be devastating. Most commonly, it migrates across the face of the pectinate ligament to create the equivalent of a peripheral anterior synechia and thus secondary glaucoma (Fig. 5-59) . Alternatively, it may extend from the pupillary margin of the iris to the lens capsule, creating either posterior synechia or outright pupillary block; the pupillary margin of the iris normally floats along the surface
