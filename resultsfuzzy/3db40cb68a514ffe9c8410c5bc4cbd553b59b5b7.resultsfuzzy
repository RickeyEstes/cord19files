Standardized phenotypic testing and result interpretation are neither easy nor straightforward. How to best report results to provide optimal information to clinicians is an ongoing challenge for CLSI and other agencies [15] . An example of clinician confusion is the surprisingly common question, "Should I choose the antibiotic with the lowest MIC?" This leads to a teaching moment about the drug-bug relationship and the PK/PD aspects that should be considered. Other examples of difficulties are understanding the susceptibility pattern of methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (e.g., requests for cefazolin results) and requests for tetracycline susceptibility results for enterococci from sites other than urine. Despite these limitations, phenotypic testing is available for bacteria regardless of the location of infection (with appropriate reporting in mind). The microbiology laboratory can provide susceptibility results for Escherichia coli from cerebral spinal fluid, blood, urine, and bone, all with reasonable reliability. Phenotypic testing also allows nuance in interpretation. For example, a carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella isolate with a detectable enzymatic mutation may have an MIC of 4 or of 16. The decision to use meropenem as part of the treatment regimen may, in part, be determined by that MIC (and knowledge of this MIC could not be represented simply by detection of a carbapenemase gene). Phenotypic testing is the gold standard method for guiding antimicrobial treatment decisions. While molecular assays may change this, the inherent flexibility of phenotypic testing makes it a powerful tool in the treatment of infections. This, along with decades of experience basing therapeutic decisions on phenotypic results, as well as cost and ease, ensures that phenotypic testing will still be a part of the clinical microbiology laboratory's practice, at least for the near future.
