Till lately, two synthetic approaches to 9-[2-(R)-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]-2,6-diaminopurine were described. The first method is the stepwise approach starting from the isobutyl ester of D-(Ã€)-lactic acid. It can be converted to the tetrahydropyranyl derivative, reduced to (R)-2-(2-tetrahydropyranyloxy)propanol and tosylated. Synthesis of (R)-PMPDAP is based on alkylation of 2,6-diaminopurine with thus obtained (R)-2-(2-tetrahydropyranyloxy)propyl tosylate followed by removal of 2-tetrahydropyranyl and etherification of the free hydroxy group with diisopropyl tosyloxymethanephosphonate. 1a This process was also patented. 1b However, the total yield of the key intermediate, 9-(R)-(2-hydroxypropyl)-2,6-diaminopurine, is only 38% and the introduction of a phosphonomethyl residue followed by deprotection of ester groups via transsilylation reaction with bromotrimethylsilane and hydrolysis proceeds in the total yield 47%. The second method is based on condensation of 2,6-diaminopurine with the appropriate chiral synthon, that is, (R)-2-[bis(2-propyl)phosphonomethoxy]propyl]-p-toluenesulfonate ['(R)-PMP-synthon'], the compound prepared from (R)-1-benzyloxy-2-propanol by a multi-step process involving chloromethylation, Arbuzov reaction with triisopropyl phosphite, catalytic hydrogenation and final tosylation. 2 This method is appropriate for laboratory scale syntheses. In this work, we describe a new approach to (R)-PMPDAP utilizing nucleophilic reaction of 2,6-diaminopurine with (R)-propanediol carbonate. The advantage of this starting material is its commercial accessibility in high optical purity together with its better reactivity and higher yields compared to above mentioned (R)-2-(2-tetrahydropyranyloxy)propyl tosylate. 1 Despite the fact that (R)-propanediol carbonate is involved in industrial synthesis of tenofovir, 12 not many synthetic details using other nucleobases are described. A short communication was published regarding its use for synthesis of (R)-PMPA but this work does not contain any experimental details. 13 Recently, another more detailed paper on the industrial synthesis of tenofovir was issued but description of by-products in this synthesis is focused mostly on the final synthetic step, that is, preparation of the prodrug form (tenofovir disoproxil) and to analytical methods for their quantification. 14 In our case, base catalyzed reaction of (R)-propanediol carbonate with 2,6-diaminopurine proceeded to form the desired (R)-9-(2-hydroxypropyl)-2,6-diaminopurine (1) in high yield (above 80%) and regiospecificity to the position N-9 (Scheme 1). As a side effect, formylation of one of the amino groups occurs, always to the N 2 position. The formylated by-product 2 can be easily transformed to 1 in aqueous alkali. Other by-products, bis(hydroxyalkyl) derivatives 3 and 4 and the elimination product 5 are formed after longer reaction time; their total quantity in the mixture is very low (<3%) and they are easily removed. Introduction of a phosphonomethyl residue was performed using diisopropyl tosyloxymethanephosphonate or diisopropyl bromomethanephosphonate. 15 The first possibility does not require any protection of amino groups. Reaction performed under basic conditions in dimethylformamide afforded the desired phosphonate ester 6 accompanied by a small amount of N 2 and N 6 formyl derivatives, bis(phosphonomethyl) derivative 9 and also by a small amount of compound 5 as in previous step (Scheme 2). Both formylated products 7 and 8 could be transformed by basic hydrolysis to the desired intermediate 6 which was subsequently deprotected to the final product, (R)-PMPDAP by transsilylation reaction with bromotrimethylsilane followed by hydrolysis. 1,2 The yield of this final deprotection step leading to (R)-PMPDAP is in a range 60-80% which is in agreement with previously published data (79%). 2 An alternative method of preparation of phosphonomethyl derivatives is based on utilization of diisopropyl bromomethanephosphonate. This approach usually requires protection of amino groups. In our case, we selected a protection step with dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal. This reaction leads preferentially to mono-substituted product 11a (Scheme 3). Its further reaction with diisopropyl bromomethanephosphonate can be realized without necessity to isolate intermediates. This fact belongs to the main advantages of this process. Its particular disadvantages include complicated monitoring of the reaction course due to the presence of decomposition products originating from dimethylaminomethylene compounds and also a lower yield. Similarly as all other ANPs, (R)-PMPDAP has a highly polar character due to the presence of a free phosphonic acid function and, hence, unfavorable pharmacological properties can be expected. A phosphonate group subjected to the physiological pH deprotonates and an ionized drug molecule is mostly impermeant to the cellular membrane unless pinocytosis is involved. In addition, a phosphonate based drug can be thus absorbed by gastrointestinal tract in a limited scope which disqualifies the drug for oral applica-tion. In order to achieve oral bioavailability and intracellular delivery of ANPs, their transformation to appropriate prodrug form is highly advisable. 16 In our case, we decided to transform (R)-PMP-DAP to two structurally different types of prodrugs: an alkoxyalkyl (hexadecyloxypropyl) monoester and an amidate prodrug. The first type was synthesized by reaction of tetrabutylammonium salt of (R)-PMPDAP and hexadecyloxypropyl bromide in DMF. The reaction afforded neutral diester 13, which was subsequently transformed in alkaline conditions to hexadecyloxypropyl monoester 14 (Scheme 4 to a procedure developed originally in our laboratory: 17 an appropriate phosphonate ester (ethyl or diisopropyl) is treated with bromotrimethylsilane, followed by reaction with amino acid ester hydrochloride in a presence of triphenyl phosphine and bis(2pyridinyl)-disulfide (Aldrithiol) under basic conditions (Scheme 5). Methodology of preparation of (R)-PMPDAP utilizing (R)-propanediol carbonate enabled achievement of the final product of extraordinary optical purity. Despite the diverse manners of introduction of a phosphonomethyl group or work up of reaction mixtures, an enantiomeric purity of (R)-PMPDAP was always higher than 99%. Chiral analysis of the product was performed by capillary electrophoresis (CE) with b-cyclodextrin (b-CD) chiral selector. 18 Fast (ca. 11 min) separation of (R)-and (S)-enantiomers of PMPDAP was achieved by CE using 30 mM sodium tetraborate, adjusted by NaOH to pH 10.0 as background electrolyte (running buffer) and 20 mg/mL b-CD as chiral selector, see Figure 2a . Average enantiomeric purity degree of the analyzed samples (three batches, A-C) is given in Table 1 . High enantiomeric purity of the synthesized (R)-PMPDAP, batch B, is shown in Figure 2b .
