Technical approach for in situ protein purification on metal chelate surface microarray slides In situ protein purification on metal chelate chips synchronizes protein purification and immobilization significantly reduces time, effort and cost of post-protein expression processes, and generates high quality protein microarray chips reproducibly. The approach we present here can be combined with any expression system that yields fusion proteins with an N-or C-terminal hexa-histidine tag (His-tag). The same source set of expressed proteins allows routine reproduction of identical protein microarray chips. Both the microarray replicates and aliquots of cells expressing the recombinant proteins can be stored long-term without major concerns about the quality of the assays performed subsequently. This setup circumvents the problems caused by the long-term storage of purified proteins, which include protein degradation, precipitation and aggregation. Buffer exchange of purified and stored proteins at -80°C is not required. A flow diagram for in situ protein purification from E. coli cell cultures is shown in Figure 1 . Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli in 96-well block. Cell cultures were divided into aliquots in 96-well plates and stored as cell pellets at -80°C. The cell aliquots were subjected to lysis followed by in situ purification and immobilization of proteins via specific interactions of His-tagged proteins with a slide surface chelated with either Ni 2+ or Cu 2+ (Figure 1B) . High affinity interactions allow relatively strin-gent wash steps in which the majority of weakly bound proteins are removed. Protein microarrays are stored at 4°C or used directly.
