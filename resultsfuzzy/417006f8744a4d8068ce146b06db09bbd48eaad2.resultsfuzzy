Homology-Modeled 3D Structure of NDM-1 A total of 100 homology-modeled structures for NDM-1 were derived with each having a C-score. The C-score is a ''confidence score'' for estimating the quality of a computed model: a high Cscore signifies a model with a high confidence and vice-versa. Shown in Fig. 2A is the structure with the highest C-score that was used as a receptor for further docking studies. Meanwhile, we employed PROCHECK [52] to estimate the quality of our models. It was indicated by PROCHECK that there are 93.1% residues located in the ''core'' and ''allowed'' regions, 4.6% in the ''general'' region and only 2.3% in the ''disallowed'' regions ( Fig.  S1 ). In the computational structure, all the bond lengths for the main-chain residues and 91.9% bond angles for the main-chain residues are within the allowed limits. To further examine our computational model of NDM-1, we also used the tool of QMEAN, which is a scoring function of a linear combination of 6 structural descriptors [53] . The QMEAN score ranges between 0 and 1 with higher value to reflect a better quality of the model. The QMEAN score for the current computational model is 0.67, and the density plot of this QMEAN score is shown in Fig. S2 . To evaluate the absolute model quality, we also calculated a Z-score of the computational model in comparison with the scores of the reference X-ray structures of similar size from the Protein Data Bank (Fig. S3) . For each of the QMEAN components, a Z-score was computed in comparison with the average X-ray structures (the average value is 0, as shown in Fig. S4 ). Based on these analyses, we further examined the per-residue error (Fig. S5) , visualized using a color gradient from blue (reliable regions with estimated error below 1 Å ) to red (potentially unreliable regions with estimated error above 3.5 Å ). We found that the residues in the potentially unreliable regions were mainly located on the loop regions in the computational model, indicating that further molecular dynamics optimizations are needed, as described below. However, after a 3-ns molecular dynamics simulation, all the residues in our model were in the ''core'' and ''allowed'' regions. It can be seen from Fig. 2A that, like most of the other metallo-blactamases, the NDM-1 protein belongs to the a/b structural class [54] , with 3 helices and 7 b-strands. The 3 helices were exposed to the solvent. The N-terminal and C-terminal regions of NDM-1 can be superposed by a 180 degrees rotation around a central axis, indicating that the entire structure may have arisen from the duplication of a gene. It was found after superposing NDM-1 to its template structure 1ko3.pdb that the two structures share a quite similar backbone (Fig. 2B ) owe to their high sequence identity percentage. However, some a-helices and b-strands in 1ko3.pdb are not seen in the NDM-1 model because 1ko3.pdb contains 5 helices and 11 b-strands. This is due to the sequence deletion of NDM-1 in its C-terminal and N-terminal regions. It is instructive to note that such sequence deletion might make the b-lactam antibiotic drugs easier to access the binding pocket of NDM-1. Similar with other metallo-b-lactamases, the active site of NDM-1 presents two metal ion binding sites: His site and Cys site. Thus, two zinc ions can be detected in our homology model at both the His and Cys sites with a distance of 4.20 Å apart. According to some experimental data, the one located in the His site has a higher occupancy (1.3 fold) than that in the Cys site (Fig. 3A) . The zinc ion in the His site possesses a tetrahedral coordination sphere and is coordinated by His56, His58, and His125. The other zinc ion in the Cys site has a trigonal-pyramidal coordination sphere that involves Ser11, Asp60, and Cys144.
