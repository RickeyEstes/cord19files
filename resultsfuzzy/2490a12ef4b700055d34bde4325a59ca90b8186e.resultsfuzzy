Samples with discrepant results, defined as a sample that exhibited a positive result in one (or more) assay(s) and a negative result in another assay, were retested with all assays. For a given assay, discordant samples were tested two or three times and the final result was based on two coincident results independent of the retest results with any other assay. This approach was adopted according to standard practices in Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories for samples with unexpected results. Initially, 153 samples were classified as discrepant. From those 138 remained discrepant after retesting and 15 samples were reclassified. Samples that were positive by only one assay after retesting were submitted to the ISU-VDL for PEDV IFA (abbreviated here as IFA-ISU) (Thomas et al., 2015) and for the PEDV WV ELISA (abbreviated here as WV-ISU) (Thomas et al., 2015) in addition to submission to the DTU National Veterinary Laboratory in Denmark for a blocking ELISA (abbreviated here as DTU-bELISA) (Lohse et al., 2016) . Samples with discrepant results (n = 138), defined as a sample that did not exhibit coincidental results with all assays, i.e., exhibited positive results in one or more assays and negative results in any of the other assays, were further evaluated based on sample availability. A total of 96 samples from 28 farms were selected and tested by an IFA and the WV-ISU ELISA, and 83 of the 96 samples were tested by the DTU-bELISA (Table 4 ). The WV-ISU ELISA classified the highest number of farms as positive (23/26), including a sample on a PRCV positive, PEDV negative farm, while the IFA classified the lowest number of farms as positive (4/28). The DTU-bELISA classified 7/28 farms as positive.
