The OLS and quantile regression estimation results reported in Table 2 indicate that GTA has a significant effect on GS, even at the different quantiles of GS. Table 2 and Fig. 1 illustrate that the value of the estimated coefficients is positive and stable in magnitude as the quantile increases from .1 to .9, suggesting that the significant effect of GTA on GS is consistent. While MR positively and significantly influences GS based on the OLS regression estimation result, the significant influence exists only at certain quantiles of GS. According to the OLS regression estimation results in Table 3 , the effect of GTA on HER is found be positive, but this influence is not statistically significant at the 10% level, suggesting that the relationship between GTA and HER during the period from January 1983 to December 2013 is non-significant. However, this study yielded some interesting results by looking at the quantile regression tests. Quantile regression estimation results in Table 3 revealed that the estimated coefficients of GTA on HER have an expected positive sign and are found to be statistically significant only at the low quantiles but not at the median and high quantiles. As shown in Fig. 2 , the quantile regression results also show evidence of asymmetries. The estimated coefficients consistently increase in magnitude as the quantile increases from .1 to .6. However, the estimated coefficients even turn from positive into negative when the quantile is equal to .7 to .9. In comparison, both the OLS and quantile regression estimation results in Table 3 show that MR has a significant impact on HER, even at the different quantiles of HER.
