Thiophenol 4, obtained from phloroglucinol (Wolfers et al., 1975) or from 3,5-dimethoxyaniline by diazotization followed by reaction with Na 2 S + S or NaSH (Allen and Mackay, 1943) was subjected to Pechmann condensation with ethylbutyrylacetate in presence of sulphuric acid (Sethna and Phadke, 1953) . However, it yielded the undesired 7-hydroxy-5-methoxy-2-propyl-4H-thiochromen-4-one. The required 5,7-dimethoxy-4-propyl-2H-thiochromen-2-one 5 was obtained by a modified Pechmann method where triflic acid was used instead of H 2 SO 4 . Demethylation with AlCl 3 yielded 5,7-dihydroxythiocoumarin 6. Friedel-Crafts acylation (Olah, 1964) of 6 with tigloyl chloride yielded a 3:1 mixture of 5,7-ditigloyloxy thiocoumarin 7a and 5-hydroxy-7-tigloyloxy thiocoumarin 7b instead of the required C-8 tigloyl coumarin 7 (Scheme 1). In an alternate route (Sekino et al., 2004) thiocoumarin 5 was subjected to Friedel-Crafts reaction with tigloylchloride to yield 5-methoxy-7-hydroxy-8-tigloylthiacoumarin 8. Intramolecular oxo-Michael addition (IMA) of the latter furnished the chromanone 9. Subsequent demethylation of 9 with various reagents like BBr 3 /CH 2 Cl 2 at À70°C (Vickery et al., 1979) , BBr 3 -SMe 2 /CH 2 Cl 2 (Williard and Fryhle, 1980) , BF 3 -Et 2 O/CH 2 Cl 2 (Preston et al., 1983) , AlCl 3 /PhCl at 120°C (Chenera et al., 1993) , and MgI 2 /K 2 CO 3 /PhH (Sekino et al., 2004) under reflux for 15 days did not proceed satisfactorily to yield the expected demethylated product. With BBr 3 / CH 2 Cl 2 , compound 8 was regenerated, whereas the starting thiocoumarin 9 was recovered unchanged with other reagents (Scheme 2). Successful tigloylation was achieved via Friedel-Crafts reaction from compound 6 employing an appropriate solvent in a ratio CS 2 -PhNO 2 (7:3). The product 7 thus formed was cyclized with K 2 CO 3 yielded the desired 8,9-dimethyldihydrothiopyranones 10 as an 1:1 epimeric mixture. The required 'C' ring was constructed from 10 by reaction with 3-chloro-3methyl-1-butyne to yield chromene-chromanone-thiacoumarins 11 and 12 in a 1.8:1 ratio and in an overall yield of 34% (Scheme 3). Both the ketones 11 and 12 were separately reduced with NaBH 4 to afford (±)-3 and (±)-thia-calanolide C 14 in 44% and 71% yields, respectively. Reduction of 11 with NaBH 4 -CeCl 3 under Luche condition resulted in a 3:2 mixture of (±)-3 and (±)-thia-calanolide B (±)-13, respectively (Scheme 4). For the first time, in the calanolide series, especially in the thia-calanolide A synthesis, application of HPLC method for determination and separation of small quantities of the intermediates in the total synthesis of (+)-thia-calanolide has been developed. Resolution of a mixture of cis and trans of 10 was found to be excellent using Bondapak silica porasil 30 cm column. Resolution of (±)-3 was achieved by chiral HPLC (Chiralcel (OD), 9:1 hexane-isopropanol, 1 mL/min) to afford the two isomers (+)-3 and (-)-3 having optical rotation [a] D + 54.3°(c 0.5, CHCl 3 ) and [a] D À49.8°(c 0.3, CHCl 3 ), respectively (Scheme 5).
