Lectin Properties of b1CoV HEs A comprehensive set of b1CoV HEs, expressed as esteraseinactive Fc-fusion proteins (HE 0 -Fc), was compared for their Sia-binding properties. In accordance with previous findings (Tamura et al., 2013) . The positions of human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 are highlighted relative to those of animal lineage A betacoronaviruses, including the various b1CoV subspecies and classical mouse hepatitis virus-type murine coronavirus (MuCoV). ChRCoV-HKU24, Chinese rat coronavirus HKU24 (Lau et al., 2015) ; LAMV, Longquan Aa mouse coronavirus ; LRLV, Longquan RI rat coronavirus . The position of CRCoV, a recent split-off of BCoV, is indicated by a red dot. (See also Figure S1 .) (B) HE 0 -Fc lectins (2-fold serial dilutions, starting at 50 ng/mL) were compared by sp-LBA for relative binding to BSM (with 50 ng/mL BCoV-HE 0 -Fc set at 100%). (C) Conventional HAA with 2-fold serial dilutions of HE 0 -Fc fusion proteins of b1CoV members and HCoV-HKU1 (starting at 25 ng/well). Wells positive for hemagglutination are encircled. (D) High-sensitivity nanobead HAA. Non-complexed nanobeads (''beads only'') and nanobeads complexed with lectin-inactive mutant BCoV HE 0 F 211 A were included as negative controls. (Langereis et al., 2015) , the HEs of most animal b1CoVs bound to bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) in a 9-O-Ac-Sia-dependent fashion in solid-phase lectin-binding assays (sp-LBA; Figure 1B ). Remarkably, however, those of PHEV strain VW572 and prototypic OC43 strain USA/1967 (also known as ATCC-VR759; McIntosh et al., 1967) showed no detectable binding. In hemagglutination assays (HAA), more sensitive than sp-LBA, PHEV HE 0 tested positive, albeit weakly ( Figure 1C ). OC43 USA/1967 HE 0 , however, did not hemagglutinate. To augment HAA sensitivity through multivalency-driven high-avidity binding, we complexed HE 0 -Fc chimeras to protein A-coated nanobeads (Figure 1D ). For PHEV HE 0 , sensitivity was increased 250-fold as compared to the standard assay. Under these conditions, modest, but reproducible, hemagglutination by OC43 USA/1967 HE 0 was detected ( Figure 1D ). Apparently, it has lost most, though not all, of its lectin function. Our observations prompted the question of whether loss of HE lectin activity is a strain-specific trait resulting from adaptation to in vitro propagation or a characteristic also shared by naturally occurring OC43 viruses. We therefore RT-PCR-amplified HE genes from more recent sputum-derived OC43 strains (respiratory season 2005). The encoded proteins OC43/NL/A/2005 and OC43/NL/B/2005 HE 0 , representative for the two major HE lineages in OC43 (designated ''A'' and ''B,'' Figure S1 and vide infra), did not show any detectable binding by sp-LBA or nanobead HAA ( Figures 1B-1D) . Apparently, loss of affinity for 9-O-Ac-Sias as seen for OC43/USA/1967 HE is not an artifact. In fact, the data suggest that HEs of contemporary OC43 variants have lost receptor-binding activity altogether.
