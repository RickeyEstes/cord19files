The operating efficiency (stage 1) is similar among cruise lines, as shown in Fig. 2 , and all of them performed relatively well from an operational perspective. The non-operating efficiency, however, showed a completely different picture: the difference in average efficiency between the best performer (CCL) and the poorest one (NCL) is 0.623 (Â¼0.821e0.193). The RCL is in between with the average efficiency of 0.695. These results suggest that the variation of the cruise line performance arises mainly at the non-operating stage, which reflects the companies financial or accounting activities, e.g., interest payment and taxation. The efficiency scores suggest that relatively inefficient RCL and NCL can increase their net income (the final output of the non-operating stage) by improving their financial strategies. On the other hand, to identify the possible financial strategies to leverage their income, the determinants of efficiency should be examined. Table 5 lists the results that regressed the efficiency on several possible determinants. Model 1 has the overall efficiency as the dependent variable, Model 2 has the operating efficiency, and Model 3 has the non-operating efficiency. To check the multicollinearity among independent variables, variance inflation factors (VIF) are reported in the last column. VIF values of Total debt to capital and payroll are higher than the generally accepted cutoff 5 (Craney & Unit: $ thousand.
