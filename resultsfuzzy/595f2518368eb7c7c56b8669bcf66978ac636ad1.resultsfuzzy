Proteins identified by LMD-LC-MS and the protein profile of inflamed FT1DM pancreas tissue We identified a total of 300 different proteins. A total of 193 proteins were identified in the islet mixture from the three FT1DM patients, and 262 proteins were identified in the islets of at least one of the control patients (Table 1 and Tables S2 and S3) . Overall, 38 of the 300 proteins identified (12.7%) ( Table 1) were found only in the FT1DM islets, 107 proteins (35.7%) (Table S3) were found only in the control islets, and 155 proteins (51.7%) ( Table S2) were found in both control and FT1DM-affected islets. Most proteins have not been previously implicated as being involved in type 1 diabetes ( Table 1 ). The proteome of the control islets included insulin, glucagon, and proteins associated with glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, ribosomes, and secretory granules (Tables S2 and S3 ). Glucagon was identified in FT1DM-affected islets but insulin was not, which was in agreement with our previous pathological studies [10, 11] .
