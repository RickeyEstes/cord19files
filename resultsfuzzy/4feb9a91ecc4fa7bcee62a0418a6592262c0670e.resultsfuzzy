As a highly infectious publicly and politically high-profile disease, FMD affects millions of cloven-hooved animals and has attracted global concern [15] . A major problem in the control of FMD outbreaks in normally disease-free countries is the delay in onset of immunity following emergency vaccination [16] , and antiviral agents have the potential to provide vital protection during this delay. Amiloride has been reported to exhibit antiviral activity against CVB3 [6, 7] . However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous definitive studies on the antiviral activity of amiloride against FMDV, which belongs to the same family of Picornaviridae as CVB3. Analysis of the cytotoxicity of amiloride revealed that amiloride had little effect on cell viability. Treatment of 1000 μM amiloride induced mild cytotoxicity in the host cells at concentrations (Fig. 2 ). In addition, at this concentration, no differences in cell morphology were found between amiloride-treated and mock-treated IBRS-2 cells (data not shown). The CC 50 of amiloride estimated by Graphpad software was about 1879 μM. To investigate antiviral protection to the cells from CPE caused by FMDV infection, a serial dilution range of amiloride was used from 100 to 1000 μM. With the treatment of 400, 600, 800, and 1000 μM of amiloride, significant protection for cells from CPE (P < 0.01) (Fig. 3A) , other concentrations of amiloride were found to not provide effective protection to the cells infected with FMDV O/ MYA98/BY/2010 (Fig. 3A) . To further confirm the inhibitory effect of amiloride on FMDV replication in IBRS-2 cells, real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, and IFA were performed. The mean relative mRNA load of IBRS-2 cells treated with 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 μM amiloride was 106.46, 99.96, 0.050, 0.058, 0.027, and 0.017, respectively (mean relative mRNA load of mock-treated cells was set at 100) (Fig. 4A) . Consistent with these results, the FMDV VP1 protein was significantly suppressed following treatment with 400, 600, 800, and 1000 μM amiloride (Fig. 4B) . With regard to IFA, both control and IBRS-2 cells treated with 100 and 200 μM amiloride generated strong fluorescent signals at 12 h post-infection, whereas cells treated with 400, 600, 800, and 1000 μM amiloride showed reduced fluorescent signals (Fig. 5) . Therefore, amiloride represents a novel antiviral molecule against FMDV. Interestingly, amiloride exhibited antiviral activity against different strain of FMDV. The effective dose of amiloride against type A FMDV was from 200 μM (Fig. 3B ). As shown in Table 1 indicates that the cells that were not treated with amiloride. Values represent the mean ± standard deviation for three independent experiments. ***P < 0.001 compared with the control group. for A/GD/MM/2013 (3.28) were approximately two-fold higher than those for O/MY98/BY/2010 (5.92), indicating that amiloride could serve as a broad-spectrum drug to treat FMDV infections. To further investigate the action of amiloride against FMDV, viral attachment and entry assays were performed to determine which stage of viral lifecycle was affected by amiloride treatment. The results of the viral attachment tests revealed that the mean relative mRNA levels in IBRS-2 cells treated with 400, 600, 800, and 1000 μM amiloride were 93, 96, 90.5, and 92.5, respectively (with mean relative mRNA level in mock-treated cells set at 100) (Fig. 6A) . The findings of the viral entry experiments demonstrated that the mean relative mRNA levels in IBRS-2 cells treated with 400, 600, 800, and 1000 μM amiloride were 95, 96, 95, and 98, respectively (with mean relative mRNA level in mocktreated cells set at 100) (Fig. 6B) . Thus, no significant differences in the relative levels of viral mRNA were observed between drug-treated and mock-treated cells, indicating that amiloride had no effect on FMDV attachment and entry into IBRS-2 cells. To identify which stage of viral replication was inhibited by amiloride, a TOA experiment was performed. The IBRS-2 cells were incubated with amiloride at 0 h or 2, 4, 8, and 16 h after FMDV infection, and a Q-PCR and Western blot assay were conducted at 24 h postinfection to determine the relative mRNA levels and VP1 protein in the infected and untreated cells (Fig. 7) . The viral mRNA levels were noticeably inhibited by amiloride treatment at 0, 2, 4, and 8 h post-infection. The mean relative mRNA levels of cells treated with amiloride at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 h were 0.042, 0.019, 0.015, 0.069, and 96.52, respectively (with mean relative mRNA level of mock-treated cells set at 100) (Fig. 7B) . Similarly, the viral VP1 protein expression was also low even after amiloride treatment at 8 h post-infection (Fig. 7C) . However, only negligible inhibitory effects were observed after amiloride treatment at 16 h post-infection, indicating that amiloride blocked FMDV replication at the early stages of viral infection. Interestingly, previous studies have revealed that amiloride could inhibit CVB3 genome replication and act as a competitive inhibitor inhibiting the enzymatic activity of CVB3 3Dpol in cell culture, affecting VPgpUpU synthesis and RNA elongation [6, 7] . In particular, amiloride could compete with nucleoside triphosphates and Mg 2+ , and the molecular mechanism of action of amiloride against FMDV should be examined in detail. It has been reported that amiloride analogs have a different content inhibitory activity against CVB3 3Dpol [17] . Thus, it will be interesting to investigate and compare the efficacy of amiloride analogs such as EIPA, 5-(N,N-dimethyl) amiloride, and HMA against FMDV. Recently, we investigated the protective effect of amiloride in an FMDV-challenged suckling mouse model based on the anti-FMDV replication activity of amiloride in vitro. The findings revealed that 50 μg of amiloride showed better protection (33.3%) when compared with DMSO-treated group (8.3%) after 5 days post-infection. Nevertheless, larger studies are required to determine if there is a significant difference in the survival rate. In conclusion, FMDV infection in IBRS-2 cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by amiloride treatment. These in vitro results show that amiloride could be a promising novel antiviral agent that can be used in the early stages of viral infection before a vaccine-induced immune response is triggered; however, further studies are required to determine the exact mechanism of action of amiloride.
