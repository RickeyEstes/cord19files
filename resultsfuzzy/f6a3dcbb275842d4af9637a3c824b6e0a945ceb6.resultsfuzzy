The infection risk of SARS for a given passenger would be different under different gasper on/off distributions and with different source locations. In other words, for a given source location, the database contains many data points for each passenger, corresponding to different gasper on/off distributions. Using the database, this study calculated the mean, maximum, minimum, 75th percentile, and 25th percentile of the infection risks for each passenger with various source locations. Fig. 7(a) and (b) show the data for each passenger when the source was located at seats 4d and 4g, respectively, in the Boeing 767. The points, the upper and lower bounds of the error bars, and the upper and lower bounds of the boxes represent the mean, the maximum and minimum, and the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively, of the infection risks for each passenger. Note that these variations were caused by the different gasper on/off distributions. The results show that the gasper on/off distribution can significantly affect the infection risk for each passenger. For example, when the source was at 4g, the SARS infection risk for the passenger seated at 3c ranged from 0.08 to 0.92 under different distributions. This variation occurred because the gasper-induced flows altered the air distribution in the cabin, which in turn influenced contaminant transport from the source and the receptors. To keep the paper concise, only the results with the source at seats 4d and 4g are shown in the figure. The results with the source at seats 4e and 4f point to the same conclusion. Fig. 8 shows the results for the Boeing 737. This figure is analogous to Fig. 7 , except that the source in the Boeing 737 was at seats 4d and 4f. As in the Boeing 767, the SARS infection risk can be significantly influenced by the gasper on/off distribution. For instance, when the source was at 4d, the infection risk for the passenger seated at 6f ranged from 0.18 to 0.98 under different distributions. Therefore, for both the Boeing 767 and Boeing 737, the impact of gaspers on cabin air quality was significant. Figs. 7 and 8 show that turning on the gaspers may significantly affect the infection risk for each passenger. Statistically speaking, however, it is still unknown whether turning on a passenger's gasper will have a positive or negative impact on his/her infection risk. To answer this question, this study calculated the mean infection risk from the database for each passenger when he/she turned on his/her gasper. The mean infection risk for each passenger when he/she did not turn on the gasper was also calculated. Note that Figs. 9 and 10 included all cases in the database. Fig. 9 compares the mean SARS infection risk for the 49 passengers in the Boeing 767 when they turned their gaspers on and off. The horizontal axis indicates the mean infection risk when the gasper was off, while the vertical axis indicates the risk when the gasper was on. The solid line represents the 1:1 line, while the dashed line is the linear regression. Each point represents a passenger. If a point is located exactly on the 1:1 line, it means that there was no difference in the mean infection risk for that passenger when his/her gasper was turned on and off. If a point is above the 1:1 line, it means that turning on the gasper increased the mean infection risk for this passenger. If a point is below the 1:1 line, the risk was reduced by turning the gasper on. It can be seen in the figures that most of the points are close to the 1:1 line, and the slopes of the linear regressions are close to 1 with high R 2 values. These results indicate that, statistically speaking, the overall effect of turning on a passenger's gasper on the mean infection risk for the passenger was neutral for the general population. Fig. 10 is analogous to Fig. 9 , except that there were 42 passengers in the Boeing 737. Again, most of the points were close to the 1:1 line, and the slopes of the linear regressions were close to 1 with high R 2 values. The results for the Boeing 737 led to the same conclusion as for the 767: statistically speaking, if a passenger turned on his/her gasper, there was an equal chance of either a positive or negative impact on his/her infection risk. There are important practical implications of the results presented above. First, the gasper on/off distribution can significantly influence the infection risk for each passenger. Furthermore, statistically speaking, the overall effect of turning on a passenger's gasper on the mean infection risk for the passenger is neutral. That is to say, turning on a passenger's gasper could result in either a positive or negative impact on his/her infection risk. The practical implication is that, even though a gasper supplies clean air that is aimed at a passenger, it may actually have a negative effect on the passenger's health. If the specific gasper on/off distribution produces a high contaminant concentration in the region above a passenger's head, turning on the gasper may bring more contaminants into the breathing zone of the passenger as a result of the strong air entrainment [10] . Therefore, when a passenger is deciding whether or not to turn on his/her gasper, the conventional understanding that the clean air supplied from the gasper enhances the air quality is not necessarily correct. If the passenger's health is fragile, he/she should consider not turning on the gasper to avoid the possibility of increased infection risk.
