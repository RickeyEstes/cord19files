Total RNA was isolated from mouse lung homogenate using TRIzol® reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions and purified using the RNeasy® Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, MD, USA). Quantitative RT-PCR was done using iQ SYBR Green Supermix using iCycler by Bio-Rad, USA. 18S rRNA (sense, 5′-GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATT-3′, and antisense, 5′-CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG-3′) was used Fig. 1 The number of genes differentially regulated in the WT and Sphk2−/− mice exposed to PA shown as a Venn diagram. Data was analyzed using two-way ANOVA. Two-way ANOVA represents the analyses performed to ascertain the impact of three factors such as 1. Sphk2 gene KO, 2.PA infection, 3. Interaction of the gene KO and infection There are three circles representing the data derived from the two-way ANOVA. Circle labelled genotype shows genes affected by knockout of Sphk2 gene. Sphk2 −/− shows only 2 genes differentially regulated when the corresponding gene was knocked out. Circle labelled infection shows genes affected by PA. 375 genes differentially regulated by PA group compared to the corresponding control unaffected by other factors. The third circle shows genes affected by the interaction between the two factors ie Sphk2 −/− and PA. 1496 genes were solely affected by the interaction between Sphk2 −/− and PA as external control to normalize expression [31] . All primers were designed by inspection of the genes of interest using data from PrimerBank database (Harvard University, Boston USA). The sequence description of mouse primers used are given in Additional file 2: Table S1 . Negative controls, consisting of reaction mixtures containing all components but the target RNA, were included with each of the RT-PCR runs. The representative PCR mixtures for each gene were run in the absence of the RT enzyme after first being cycled to 95°C for 15 min in order to ensure that amplified products did not represent genomic DNA contamination. No PCR products were observed in the absence of reverse transcription. Direct comparison of four groups such as WT control, WT PA, Sphk2 −/− control and Sphk2 −/− PA was done using ANOVA test, as described earlier. The level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Validation studies were performed in more animals in addition to the cohort used in RNA-Seq studies. WT and Sphk2 −/− mice were exposed to PA for 24 h in our animal model of PA pneumonia. Lung tissues isolated at the end of treatment were investigated as described in the Material and Methods. In order to delineate the underlying biological events that could be related to the protective effect seen in Sphk2 −/− mice against PA pneumonia, pathway enrichment analysis was performed. The 6 M clusters of pathways were identified and grouped by similar functions, thus highlighting biological motifs most prevalent in our model are shown in here The genes identified as maximally differentially regulated are represented in the heatmap shown in Fig. 3 . The genes for RT-PCR validation were selected from those maximally differentially regulated genes and identified as significant from the various differentially regulated nodal pathways as they were related to cell migration, inflammation, epigenetic regulation of genome, and IL-6 signaling. Spata13, Hdc, Kdm6b, Gos2, Fosl2, Dgat1, Odc1, Smtnl2, Clec1a and Sox17 were therefore chosen for RT-PCR validation. In addition, these genes were also related to biologically relevant findings in our animal model. Western blot analyses were performed to validate protein expression of genes that were modulated in for Real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 12) . Immunoblots showed increased expression of KDM6B, SPATA13 and ODC1 in the PA exposed lungs of the WT mice compared to Sphk2 −/− mouse lungs. CLEC1A expression was significantly decreased in Sphk2 −/− mice exposed to PA, compared to WT PA. Western blots probed with corresponding antibodies were quantified by densitometry and normalized to the corresponding total protein. This finding correlated well with the results of the RNA-Seq and real-time RT-PCR analysis. Biological impact of Sphk2 deletion in the animal model correlates with the differential expression of genes in mouse lungs Our recently published data from the animal model showed that deletion of Sphk2, but not Sphk1, protected mice against PA-mediated inflammatory lung injury [11] . Catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of polyamine biosynthesis converting ornithine into putrescine. Putrescine is the precursor for the polyamines which are essential for cellular processes, ranging from DNA replication to apoptosis.
