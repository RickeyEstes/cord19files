Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3. The contribution of coinfection to severity was assessed using risk ratio and 95% (CI) for categorical variables and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous variables. For studies reporting multiple comparisons of virus combinations, all patients and events were joined if such procedure did not carry risk of including the same patients twice. For situations in which such risk was detected and for continuous outcomes, only combination with the largest number of patients was included in meta-analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was measured using I 2 test. Although serious heterogeneity was regarded as a sign of low quality of evidence, additional sub-groups analysis was considered necessary a priori regardless of heterogeneity. Random effect model were used for pooled OR and MD calculations. If basic required data on results were not presented (e.g.: measures of central tendency) and attempt to contact authors were not successful, the study was excluded from analysis. For articles that presented continuous variable as median, the standard deviation (SD) was calculated from interquartile range (IQ) dividing it by 1.35 if the sample size was considered large and the distribution of the outcome was similar to the normal distribution. In conditions above were not met, study was excluded from meta-analysis [23] . After preliminary analysis considering all included articles, main analysis was performed with studies including minimal set of viruses mentioned above. Analysis was stratified by age in order to assess possible differences in severity in studies including only infants (0-23 months), preschool children (0-59 months) and all children (0-18 years).
