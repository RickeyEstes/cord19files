The severe attenuation of MHV H277A growth in vivo prompted us to assess MHV H277A and HCoV-229E H250A replication in primary target cells. As shown in Fig 2A, MHV H277A replication in primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) was comparable to that of MHV-A59 . Data represent two independent experiments, each performed in duplicates. Mean and SEM are depicted. The 95% confidence band is highlighted in grey. The differences in peak levels of viral titers were calculated by using the non-linear regression model described in Material and Methods (peak MHV-A59: 6.0, MHV H277A : 5.6, p = 0.024, left panel; peak MHV-A59: 6.6, MHV H277A : 6.0, p = 0.016, right panel) and significance is displayed as * p < 0.05. (c) Viral titers of MHV-A59 and MHV H277A in liver and spleen of C57BL/6, IFNAR -/-, Mda5 -/-, TLR7 -/-, and Mda5 -/-/TLR7 -/mice at two days post intraperitoneal infection (500 pfu). Data represent three to four independent experiments, each based on two to three mice per strain and virus. Mean and SEM are depicted. Data points that show significant differences in a two-sided, unpaired Student's t-test are displayed; * p < 0.05, ** < 0.01, *** < 0.001. ND, not detected. until 9-12 hours post infection (h.p.i.), but was significantly restricted later during the infection. Moreover, replication of MHV H277A was even more severely reduced in bone marrow-derived murine macrophages, and accompanied by early induction of IFN-β expression (Fig 2B and  2C) . Notably, levels of IFN-β mRNA were only transiently (6 to 12 h.p.i.) elevated in MHV H277A compared to MHV-A59 infected macrophages, and declined along with viral titers and viral RNA during the late phase of infection. Likewise, replication of the EndoU-deficient HCoV-229E H250A was severely restricted in human blood-derived macrophages (Fig 2D) . We observed significantly elevated IFN-I expression in a panel of human macrophages derived from seven individual donors after infection with HCoV-229E H250A compared to wild-type HCoV-229E infection (Fig 2D) , consistent with reduced viral replication. Next, we addressed if, and to what extent, the growth defects observed for EndoU-deficient coronaviruses correlate with the induction of IFN-β expression. Mda5 has been described as the main RNA sensor of coronavirus infection in murine macrophages [29] . Compared to wild-type macrophages, IFN-β expression was reduced in Mda5-deficient macrophages following MHV H277A infection, as shown by qRT-PCR and IFN-β ELISA (Fig 3A and 3D ). Surprisingly, and again in contrast to the phenotype of the OMT-deficient MHV D130A [9] , MHV H277A replication was not restored in Mda5-deficient macrophages ( Fig 3A) . Similarly, although IFN-β expression was likewise reduced in MAVS-deficient macrophages, MHV H277A replication was not restored in MAVS-deficient macrophages (Fig 3B and 3D ). Even in IRF3/ IRF5/IRF7 (IRF3/5/7 -/-) triple-knockout macrophages, that display an almost negligible induction of IFN-β expression, MHV H277A replication was not fully restored (Fig 3C and 3D ). IFN-β protein assessed by IFN-β ELISA was below detection in all three macrophage genotypes (Mda5 -/-, MAVS -/-, IRF3/5/7 -/-; Fig 3D) . These results indicate that MHV H277A replication is either highly sensitive to already marginal amounts of IFN-I, or that other antiviral host cell responses may contribute to the attenuation of MHV H277A . Since activation of Mda5, PKR and OAS/RNase L are triggered by dsRNA, we assessed if MHV H277A infection results in increased appearance of cytosolic dsRNA. By using the dsRNA-specific antibody J2 for intracellular staining and FACS analysis we assessed the Fig 2B) , IFNAR -/-(data level of dsRNA in MHV-A59-and MHV H277A -infected wild-type and IFNAR-deficient macrophages at 4, 6, 9, and 12 h.p.i.. At 4 h.p.i. dsRNA was not yet convincingly detectable in both MHV-A59-and MHV H277A -infected wild-type macrophages (Fig 7A) . At 6 h.p.i. dsRNA peaks are clearly separated over mock and we observed a slightly stronger dsRNA signal in MHV H277A -than in MHV-A59-infected cells. This difference became convincingly apparent and statistically significant at 9 and 12 h.p.i. with dsRNA peaks of MHV H277Ainfected cells that clearly separated from dsRNA peaks of MHV-A59-infected cells (Fig 7A  and 7C, right panel) . Importantly, we also controlled for virus infection by staining for the replicase complex (nsp2/3), and as shown in Fig 7C (left panel) the peaks for nsp2/3 from in MHV H277A -infected wild-type macrophages did not exceed those of MHV-A59-infected cells. We obtained essentially the same result when we assessed dsRNA and nsp2/3 by FACS analysis following infection of IFNAR -/macrophages (Fig 7B and 7D) , suggesting that dsRNA is also increased in MHV H277A -infection under conditions of reduced host cell responses. Collectively, these results demonstrate that cytosolic dsRNA is increased in EndoU-mutant virus infection and suggest that elevated dsRNA is the trigger for the activation of Mda5, PKR, and OAS.
