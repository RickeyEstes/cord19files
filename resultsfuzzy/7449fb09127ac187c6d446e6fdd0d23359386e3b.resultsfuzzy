The results are shown in the table as a reduction number which covers the number of re-ductions relative to the saline treated control Conclusion: The intracellular results are surprising for the betalactams, since they are known for poor accumulation in cells. They even showed better results than rifampicin, which is known to be active both extra-and intracellularly. The poor reduction number seen for gentamicin intracellularly could be associated with its poor and slow penetration. Azithromycin and clindamycin reveal their bacteriostatic behaviour. In conclusion, the new In vivo model works satisfactorily and in future perspective, more complex pk/pd studies will be performed.
