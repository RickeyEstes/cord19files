An off-the-shelf, commercially available, RFID system was used to measure contacts in an ED. The data described here illustrate the complexity of interpersonal interactions in this setting. We found substantial differences in contact characteristics of the three mixing subgroups. In general, SS interactions were more numerous and longer than PP or PS interactions. Therefore, given a susceptible population of patients and staff, the biological gradient created by individuals in contact favors cross infection among staff. This finding is consistent with previous studies of contacts in the healthcare environment which highlight that Table 2 . Summary of contact characteristics per shift among patients and staff in an Emergency Department, over 81 shifts 1 . There were a total of 185 individuals in 81 shifts that did not make a contact while under surveillance. They are not included in these calculations. 2 The median and quartiles of each shift were calculated and the median of these values are reported. The median of all types will not be the sum of the 3 subtype medians. 3 All comparisons across groups types were significant by Friedman's test at p,0.0001, except for contact pairs/shift, which was significant at p = 0.004. Tukey's post hoc procedure was used to determine which groups were different and the ordering. 4 A contact event is defined as any two people being within 1 meter of each other; multiple discontinuous instances between the same two individuals are here counted as multiple contacts. 5 One contact pair is defined as any two people who have at least one instance of being within 1 meter of each other ( = an edge or link); multiple discontinuous instances are here counted as a single contact. 6 Total hours/shift is the sum of all instances of contact. NB: shift duration ranged from 5 to 12 hours. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0070854.t002
