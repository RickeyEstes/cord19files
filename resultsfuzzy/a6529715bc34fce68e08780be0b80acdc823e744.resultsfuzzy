Detection of SARS-CoV-specific proteins in virus-infected cells Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV at an m.o.i. of 5, and Western blotting analysis was performed using polyclonal rabbit serum (see Materials and methods) and cellular extracts obtained at 6, 12, 18, and 24 h.p.i. Nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins of SARS-CoV were detected after 6 and 12 h.p.i., respectively ( Fig. 1 ). Multiple bands appeared on the Western blots, because the M proteins of coronavirus are glycosylated and the N proteins are phosphorylated in the virally infected cells. These bands were not observed in extracts from cells that were not infected by SARS-CoV, indicating that the polyclonal rabbit sera specifically detected SARS-CoV proteins.
