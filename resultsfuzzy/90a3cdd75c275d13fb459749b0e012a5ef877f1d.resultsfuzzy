In this section the necessary conditions (16)- (19) are studied, from a numerical point of view; they are solved by using the © Matlab Optimization Toolbox and the function fmincon. It allows the finding of a constrained minimum of a function of several variables; this function uses sequential quadratic programming method [26] . It solves a quadratic programming subproblem [27] at each iteration in which a positive definite quasi-Newton approximation of the Hessian of the Lagrangian function was updated using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method [28] . Eq. (3) were discretized by using the classical trapezoidal rule dividing the time duration interval into n − 1 equally spaced subintervals; in the simulation we assumed n = 500 with ad hoc integration step in order to simulate a control period of one year. To discuss the effects of the control strategy over the number of susceptible and infectious subjects, the following values for the SIRC model were adopted: Table 1 of [2] ; the assumed values are particularly suited for the influenza A model: their estimation was based on clinical observation and on genetic studies on this kind of influenza. Moreover it was noted that cross-immunity and booster effects were constraints to the maximization of transmissibility and that large values of the contact rate ˇ may imply a delay in the spread of the disease; for the proposed choice of parameters this happens for val- ues of the reproduction number less than 2 that will not be considered in the present paper. As far as the constraints for the control terms, in [29] it has been noted that vaccination of all the entire susceptible individuals at one time is not possible; therefore they proposed a limitation on the vaccination control that we extended also for the quarantine strategy: Each control u and v was weighted in Eqs. (5) and (6) with the parameter 1 = 2 and 2 = 2 respectively. The weights in the cost index were chosen in order to privilege the minimization effect over the infective subjects with respect to the susceptible ones and with respect to the control terms that had been already constrained by the bounding box limits: The number of susceptible, infected, removed and crossimmune subjects was assumed normalized with respect to the total population, therefore they were limited between zero and one. Two different situations were considered; in the first one the epidemic was just at the beginning of its diffusion, whereas in the second the number of infected subjects is already significant at the beginning of the control action. The different initial conditions yielded results different in the peak of the epidemic spread and in the control effort, as will be pointed out later. The first choice for the initial conditions was: In the following this will be recalled as Case I. In Fig. 2 the two obtained controls are presented. Note that the control u, which acts directly over the susceptible, assumed its maximum value at the beginning of the control period till four months (more precisely, 126 days) and successively decreased monotonically, whereas the control v augmented to its maxi- mum value, that reached after almost two months and a half since the beginning of the treatment, and then it decreased monotonically from the third month and a half. The control over the infected subjects could be reduced almost to zero after about 6 months since the beginning of the treatment. In Fig. 3 the behavior of the susceptible, infected, removed and cross immune subjects when the two optimal controls were active is shown. To check the effects of the control strategy that directly acted both on susceptible and infected subjects, the same simulation of Fig. 3 was repeated also in other three situations: assuming no control, neither on susceptible nor on the infected, assuming the control only on the susceptible and finally considering the control only on the infected. In Figs. 4 and 5 the behavior of the susceptible and the infected subjects in the four analyzed situation are represented in the first eleven and twelve months of the control period, respectively. As far as the number of susceptible is concerned, its reduction with respect to the initial value S 0 was almost equivalent both when the strategy with double control was adopted and when only the susceptible were controlled, with a value of about 65%. In absence of all control actions or in presence of control only on the infected subjects the reduction with respect to S 0 was about 71%. Although the situation seems to be worse adopting the double control strategy, in Fig. 4 one can notice that the number of susceptible subjects strongly decreased at the beginning of the outbreak due to their relocation in the removed class, resulting in an important leak of potential infected people, as can be appreciated in the lower peak of epidemic and in its delay, Fig. 5 . To compare numerically the different strategies over the infected subjects, as reference situation was assumed the absence of control and the following percentage was evaluated: where the superscriptĪ represented the infected subjects in the reference situation of no control and I were the infected subjects in one of the considered control situations; it is a measure of the reduction of the peak of influence. The quantity q I was equal to −87% when the double control strategy was adopted, whereas when controlling only the susceptible or only the infected the same quantity was equal to −84% and −5% respectively. This result enhanced that the strategy that controlled both the susceptible and the infected yielded a more significant reduction in the number of infected subjects than the other control strategies. As far as the second situation considered the following choice for the initial values was assumed: In the following this will be recalled as Case II. This means that the control strategy started when the epidemic was already significantly widespread. In Fig. 6 the two obtained optimal controls are presented. Note that the control u assumed its maximum value at the beginning of the control period till one month and a half (more precisely, 44 days) and successively it decreased monotonically, whereas the control v augmented to its maximum value, that reached after one week since the beginning of the treatment, and then it decreased monotonically after about one month and a half. The control over the infected subjects should be reduced almost to zero after almost four months (113 days) since the beginning of the treatment. In Fig. 7 the behavior of the susceptible, infected, removed and cross immune subjects when the two optimal controls were active is shown. Also in this situation, to check the effects of the control strategy that directly acted both on susceptible and infected subjects, the same simulation of Fig. 7 was repeated in three situations: assuming no control, assuming the control only on the susceptible and finally considering the control only on the infected. In Figs. 8 and 9 the behavior of the susceptible and the infected subjects in the four analyzed situations are represented in the first seven months of the control period, respectively. As far as the number of susceptible is concerned, its reduction with respect to the initial value S 0 was almost equivalent both when the strategy with double control was adopted and when only the susceptible were controlled, with a value of about −70%. In absence of all control actions or in presence of control only on the infected subjects the reduction with respect to S 0 was about 67%. The effects of the control strategies over the number of infected subjects were analyzed by means of the q I quantity. It was equal to −31% when the double control strategy is adopted, whereas, when controlling only on the susceptible and only on the infected, the same quantity was equal to −26% and −5% respectively. This result enhanced that the strategy that controlled both the susceptible and the infected yielded a more significant reduction in the number of infected subjects than the other control strategies. Moreover, note that in the Case II, the peak of epidemic did not change significantly in time, even if, as already pointed out, changed significantly in its values, depending on the chosen control strategy. In both cases it is interesting to study the influence of the reproduction number (and therefore of the transmission parameter ˇ) on the optimal control strategy. Note that this parameter influences not only the contact rate of susceptible subjects, but also the possibility of re-entering in the removed compartment after the cross-immune period. Two new situations were considered: a reproduction number equal to 6 and to 10, i.e. equal to the half and end point of the allowed range. In Case I, forR = 6 it was noted that the control u(t) started from the maximum value allowed and decreased at day 21, whereas the control over the infected reached the maximum value at day 16, decreasing after 2 weeks. Similar results may be observed forR = 10, with the control over the susceptible that began to decrease from the maximum value after 13 days and the control over the infected that assumed the maximum value between the day eleven and twenty-three, and then decreases. In the case ofR = 6, as far as the number of susceptible is concerned, its reduction with respect to the initial value S 0 was about of 85%; this value, larger that the corresponding one obtained withR = 2, is reasonable since the contact rate is greater. The effects of the control strategies over the number of infected subjects was analyzed by means of the q I quantity that was equal to −15%, thus enhancing a less evident reduction of the number of infected subjects, than in the previous situation; also the peak location, that came earlier (about after three weeks), reflected the influence of the larger contact rate. The same considerations hold also in the case ofR = 10, in which the reduction of the number of susceptible individuals with respect to the initial value S 0 was almost constant whereas the q I quantity was equal to −7% and also the peak was located significantly earlier (day 14). Similar considerations hold also for the Case II of an epidemic already significantly widespread. As far as the control is concerned, forR = 6 the control over the susceptible subjects, starting from the maximum value allowed, began to decrease at day 10, whereas the control over the infected reached the maximum value at day 5 and began to decrease after about 3 weeks (20 days). Again, the optimal solution was a maximum effort at the beginning of the disease, and successively decreased. Similar results could be observed forR = 10, with the control over the susceptible that began to decrease from the maximum value after about a week and the control over the infected that assumed the maximum value between the day four and sixteen, and then decreased. Both forR = 6 and R = 10 the reduction of the number of susceptible subjects with respect to the initial value S 0 was about of 85%, thus confirming the behavior of Case I. Even more evident was the change in the location of the peak of the epidemic, being at about day 7 and 5 respectively, with a quantity q I equal to −5.68% and −3.02% for the two choices of the reproduction number, thus denoting the effects of an epidemic with a contact rate really significant and the limit of the control strategy with the chosen control parameters, in the case of an epidemic already widespread and a control action not as effective as it could be in the Case I.
