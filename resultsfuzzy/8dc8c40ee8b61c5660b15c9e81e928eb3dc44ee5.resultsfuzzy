The structurally aligned sequences that comprise hmG are summarized in Figure 2A . The R2R correspondences of WN and DENV could not be evaluated for the Motif G region (approximately PV 101-121), as the structural configuration of the segments of these viruses that would be expected to match the homomorph of Motif G (hmG) segment had not been determined. Within the homomorph, most of the ss-RdRps were highly similar (Figure 2A , top). BVDV is similar to the other ss-RdRps in the N-terminal segment, but no longer matches them at the C-terminal segment. Only Motif G, and not a homomorph, was identified in PHI6, IBDV and IPNV. In the region of Motif G, StralSV did not identify R2R correspondences between any of the RNA polymerases and REOV, ROTAV, HIV, TERT or DNA-dependent polymerases (TAQ, T7 DNAP, T7 RNAP and N4). There were structural discontinuities within the homomorph (noted by x in Figure 2A ) and similar discontinuities within the motif. These minor discontinuities identify species-specific differences within a segment that is otherwise highly continuous in several species. For example, FMDV has 3 AA between S87 and T90 (PV numbering) and therefore does not match the structure of PV 88-LD-89, which has only 2 AA. In contrast, WN and DENV have the same number of residues for the gaps from A388-R392 and G385-R389, respectively, but these segments were not structurally aligned by StralSV within the parameters used in this study. The segment PV-Y102 to A109 is a b-hairpin unique to picornavirus RdRps (11) . The numbering on NV and HCV clarifies that these regions are continuous in these species (and the other caliciviruses, RHDV and SAPV, though not numbered). Figure 2B and C illustrates the tertiary structure of the homomorph using a poliovirus structure (PDB:1RA6). Most of the N-terminal segment is a single helix that extends over nearly half of the surface of the protein. Both ends of the homomorph terminate at the exterior surface of the protein. The distance between the homomorphs of Motifs G and F1 was 20-37 residues in the ss-RdRps (in all species where both were present) and longer in the ds-RdRps (median 47 residues) ( Figure 1 ). Three components of Motif F have been recognized: F1, F2 and F3 (2, 5) . In some species there are sequence segments between these motifs. In all the species in our sample set except PHI6, in those species that have R2R correspondence within Motif F, the three F motifs are continuous; therefore, we have combined them, and the adjacent structurally aligned segments, into a single homomorph. The structurally aligned sequences that comprised homomorph of Motif F (hmF) for RdRps and HIV are summarized in Figure 3A . HmF extended five residues upstream from the N-terminal edge of Motif F1 [as defined by Gong and Peersen (9) ] and $20 residues downstream from Motif F3 [as defined by Gong and Peersen (9)]. HmF1 was found in all RdRp species except WN and DENV; it was not possible to evaluate R2R correspondence for this segment of WN and . The number of residues from the start of the polymerase structure to the start of the first homomorph is identified for each species at the left of the chart. The PDB structures, and consequently, sequence position numbers for KUNJ, DENV and TAQ, which are used throughout this article, do not begin at the polymerase; therefore, for this figure, the distance from the start of the polymerase is shown after the slash. For species lacking Motif G, the first identified homomorph is indicated at the left of the start position. The length of the polymerase of each species is listed at the right of the chart. DENV as the structure of this segment has not been resolved. Motifs F1 and F2 are always continuous if F2 is present, and Motif F2 is present in most species. Motif F2 is represented by a single residue in PHI6, REOV and ROTAV (dsRNA), two residues in HIV (RdDp), 15 residues in BVDV and 10 residues in HCV (two of which, in HCV, are structurally aligned to the other RdRps). Motif F2 varied in length from 6 to 15 residues. In PHI6, there was a 61-residue segment between F1 and F3. HmF3 was present in all RdRp species. Figure 3B and C illustrates the tertiary position of hmF. Most of the structure is hairpin-like, with some residues of Motif F2 at the apex, which is located at the exterior surface of the protein. HmF1 and hmF3 are approximately parallel for several residues. HmF3 then independently extends to the surface of the protein approximately opposite the Motif F2 site. Figure 3D shows the N-and C-terminal residues and some residues of the C-segment of hmF3 at the surface of the protein. Figure 3E shows the position of Motif F2 relative to the template tunnel. The segments between hmF and hmA are 8-17 residues in ss-RdRps and PHI6, 28-30 residues in ds-RdRps (REOV, ROTAV, IBDV and IPNV), 30-40 residues in RdDps (HIV and TERT) and DdRps (T7 RNAP and N4) and 102-131 in DdDps (TAQ and T7 DNAP) ( Figure 1 ). The structurally aligned sequences that comprise homomorph of Motif A (hmA) are summarized in Figure 4A . and IPNV (ds-RdRps) have fewer aligned residues. REOV (ds-RdRp) and HIV and TERT (RdDps) do not have R2R correspondence with the ss-RdRps. The DdRps (T7 RNAP and N4) and DdDps (TAQ and T7DNAP) share a homomorphic structure within the N-terminal segment, but it is substantially different from the RdRp structure and therefore is not included in the homomorph or Figure 4A . Within the motif, HIV corresponds only to NV and SAPV (only found using an HIV query), indicating a significant structural difference from other species; HIV also lacks R2R correspondence beyond the motif and therefore is not included in the homomorph. At the C-terminal segment of the homomorph, most species in the sample set, except HIV, have a homologous structure. At some sequence positions within hmA, a particular residue composition is conserved throughout a viral family (e.g. picornavirus), and a different residue composition is conserved in another viral family at the same position. This within-family sequence conservation (!75%) occurs at the following sequence positions (shown in Figure 4A , PV numbering): 214, 234, 237-240, 245 and 249. Within the N-terminal side of the homomorph, at the edge of the motif (PV 226-227), there is a minor discontinuity in structure homology ( Figure 4A ). The distance between the discontinuities in each species is provided in a column within the figure (white) that indicates the entire span over which discontinuity exists for each species. However, the loop represented by this discontinuity varies in length by only one to four amino acids. Figure 4B illustrates the tertiary structure of the hmA. Each end of the homomorph is at the exterior surface of the protein (Figure 4C ), and its center-the conserved Motif A-is at the surface of the template tunnel. The overall configuration of the homomorph is spring-like ( Figure 4D ). The species-specific loop within the homomorph is located at the exterior of the protein. The sequence segment between the homomorphs of Motif A and Motif B (hmB) is $4-20 residues in the RdRps, and mostly greater than 20 residues in the DNA-dependent polymerases. It is relatively long in REOV (41), T7 RNAP (81) and N4 (98). In the birnaviruses (IBDV, IPNV), Motif C precedes Motif A in sequence; this sequence inversion is described in a later section of this article, which describes Motif C. Motif B is a component of the largest homomorph identified in the RdRps. The homomorph begins 21 residues upstream from Motif B and extends 10 residues downstream. The motif is 15 residues long. The size of the homomorph is consistent in most species. The structurally aligned sequences that comprise the homomorph are shown in the top section of Figure 5A . They include all the RdRps in the sample set plus TERT (RdDp). Each of In cells with a light blue background filled with a number, the number is the sequence position of the adjacent matches for each species; numbers in the white column between them summarize the length of sequence that the non-matched sequence represents in each species. In this segment there are more residues in each species than between the corresponding residues in PV, indicating that this region is a loop that is absent in PV, and the loop length varies by species. At the left of the alignment (209-214, uncolored), there is a structure common to several species, but too few to qualify the region as part of the homomorph. (B) In this figure of poliovirus (PDB:1RA6), the N-terminal segment of the homomorph is blue and the C-terminal segment is brown. The terminal residues of HmA are at the exterior surface of the protein (PDB:1RA6). Motif A is centered within the homomorph at the wall of the template tunnel. (C) The terminal residues of the homomorph and the helix adjacent to each are constituents of the protein surface. (D) In PV, an insertion (red) at the C-terminal edge of the motif is lethal: L241-i-S242 (42) . A species-specific loop (green) affects the catalytic rate (in PV) (37) . these species matched a poliovirus query, indicating there is greater structural similarity than in other homomorphs and motifs. The N-terminal segment of the homomorph contains some discontinuities that are resolved by using R2R matches for alternative queries ( Figure 5A , lower section). The C-terminal segment of the homomorph is well represented in all RNA polymerases and TERT. No R2R correspondence was found between the residues comprising hmB in the RNA polymerases and residues in the DNA-dependent polymerases (T7 RNAP, N4, TAQ and T7 DNAP). The lower section of Figure 5A illustrates the dependence of the R2R correspondence on the query sequence. These differences make it possible to identify fine details between structures. Our definition of each of the homomorphs, however, is based on the inclusion of all R2R alignments using all queries in the sample set. The position of the hmB within the tertiary structure of PV is illustrated in Figure 5B . The N-terminal residue is at the exterior surface of the protein. The N-terminal segment is a classical b-hairpin protein structure that is folded back on itself and is almost entirely exposed on a surface nearly perpendicular to the face of the protein that contains the N-terminal residue ( Figure 5C ). The base of the loop transitions to Motif B at the template tunnel. The C-terminal side of the homomorph extends from the tunnel to the exterior surface of the protein ( Figure 5D ). The distance between the homomorphs of Motifs B and C (hmC) (Figure 1 ) is <6-17 in all RdRps except KUNJ and DENV, which are 36 and 35 residues, respectively. In the DNA-dependent polymerases, this distance is between 98 (TAQ) and 258 (N4) residues. In IBDV and IPNV, the segments between the homomorphs of Motifs B and D are 16 and 11 residues, respectively. The structurally aligned sequences that comprise hmC are shown in Figure 6A . Motif C is the only RdRp motif that is not a component of a larger homomorphic structure. The segments immediately adjacent to both flanks of Motif C do not even cluster into subgroups. Motif C is short-12 residues in most RdRps and folds sharply back on itself ( Figure 6B ). The highly conserved residues (labeled Motif C) are at the surface of the template tunnel and both the N-terminal and C-terminal residues are at the exterior surface of the protein ( Figure 6C ). In the birnaviruses IBDV and IPNV, there is a sequence inversion that results in the relocation of Motif C to a position immediately preceding Motif A. Figure 7A shows an alignment that documents this inversion. The top and bottom segments of Figure 7A illustrate that all species are well aligned upstream of Motif C (IPNV positions 365-372) and within Motif A (IPNV positions 399-409). RHDV, SAPV and BVDV are not well aligned within Motif C using the IPNV query, and therefore are missing from the middle section of Figure 7A (IPNV positions 382-393). The numbering of IPNV and IBDV is sequential, indicating that Motif C precedes Motif A in these species. The numberings of NV and HCV indicate there are R2R matches with IPNV at Motif C, but that over this segment the match is not in sequential order. Using a PV query, however, all of these species have R2R matches over this segment (shown in Figure 6A ). The IPNV query indicates that the structure of Motif C of the birnaviruses more closely matches NV and HCV than the others in the sample set. The difference in linear order that results from the sequence inversion is Figure 6 . (A) The high number of species that align to PV indicates that the structure of Motif C is highly conserved. Although A T7 DNAP query was required to identify the matches for the N4-TAQ-T7 RNAP species, it was achievable. HmC is the only homomorph for which there is R2R correspondence in all species of the study group. (B) Motif C (gold) is the only motif in the RdRps that is not a component of a larger structure. Motif C [illustrated using poliovirus (PDB:1RA6)] is tightly folded upon itself in a manner that places the highly conserved residues (yellow) at the tunnel wall, whereas the N-terminal segment of the motif (blue) and C-terminal segment of the motif (brown) are parallel to each other and penetrate the protein. (C) The terminal residues of both the N-and C-terminal segments are at the surface of the protein. compensated by a modified structure that maintains the motifs within a tertiary position that is similar to all other RdRps ( Figure 7B and C) . The distance between the hmC and hmD (homomorph of Motif D) is <10 residues in the RdRps. It is relatively large in PHI6 (25 residues) and is indeterminate in the DdDps, as neither Motif D nor its homomorph is within the PDB structures included in this study. The structurally aligned sequences that comprise the hmD are shown in Figure 8A . The homomorph is 21 residues long and consists of a 10-residue extension from the N-terminal edge of the motif plus the motif itself. The structure of the N-terminal segment is more highly conserved (i.e. has more R2R matches) than the motif. Various query sequences were tested with the expectation that they would capture additional alignments. The middle section of Figure 8A illustrates that this produced some improvement. For example, using an HCV query, there are R2R matches to TERT, TAQ and T7 DNAP. The C-terminal edge of the motif has some R2R correspondence, suggesting that the structure of the motif is moderately conserved. Using T7 DNAP as a query (lowest segment of the figure) , only a small portion of the C-terminal edge of Motif D and a few species have similar structures. There is no alignment of PHI6 within the N-terminal segment of the homomorph, because in this region PHI6 consists of a 24-residue loop between the end of Motif C and the start of Motif D. The tertiary structure of the hmD is illustrated in Figure 8B and C. This homomorph lies mostly at the exterior surface of the protein. The motif lines the wall of the polymerase tunnel. The segment between the hmD and homomorph of Motif E (hmE) is <15 residues in all structures in the sample set, except in IBDV and IPNV in which it is 28 and 40 residues, respectively. The structurally aligned sequences that comprise hmE are summarized in Figure 9A . HmE is large and in most of the ss-RdRps (PV, COXS, HRV, FMDV, NV, RHDV, SAPV, HCV, BVDV, WN and DENV) it is highly conserved. The motif is near the N-terminal edge and a loop region is located near the middle of the homomorph. The sequences vary in length due to the loop region. The length of hmE in the caliciviruses (30-34 residues) is shorter than those in the picornaviruses (36-37 residues); HCV and BVDV loops are 37 and 35 residues, respectively, and the loops of WN and DENV are the longest at 38 and 39 residues, respectively. There is strain-specific amino acid variability in this segment of HRV. HmE is well represented by all RdRps. No R2R correspondence was found with HIV or TERT. These species, however, are structurally matched to each other ( Figure 9A , middle section). There is considerable sequence similarity between PV and DENV within this homomorph; this is illustrated in the bottom section of Figure 9A by the shaded conserved residues. DdRps and DdRps are not included in the analysis of this region because the region is missing from the structures in our sample group. The tertiary structure of the hmE is illustrated in Figure 9B and C. Most of the homomorph is at the exterior of the protein near the NTP entry tunnel. Although it has extensive surface exposure, each terminus of the homomorph appears to be anchored by residues that are not part of the homomorph; as a result, the terminal residue at each end of the homomorph is exposed as a single residue at the exterior surface of the protein. Motif E is located near the N-terminal edge of the homomorph and contacts the surface of the NTP entry tunnel (2) . The C-terminal segment of the homomorph is folded back on itself in a manner that places the speciesspecific loop at the surface of the protein ( Figure 8C) . The homomorph forms a double strand through PV_M392, at which point the remainder of the homomorph is a single-stranded helix that emerges at the exterior surface of the protein. In PV, the C-terminal of hmE (R402) is exposed at the surface the protein and surrounded by the segment 28-SAFHYVFEG-36.
