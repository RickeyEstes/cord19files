Data acquisition FHV virions and VLPs were generated in cell culture and purified with multiple sucrose gradients as is well established for structural and biochemical studies. 30 We thus obtained highly purified viral RNA for RNAseq analysis by virtue of its encapsidation inside FHV virions and VLPs. We did not employ any additional RNA-selection steps, such as PCR or poly-A capture, which would yield a non-random population of RNA molecules. Moreover, the RNA encapsidated in FHV virions is directly relevant to virus infection as it is what may be delivered to another host cell during an infection. The purified RNAs were fragmented and prepared for sequencing analysis using Illumina protocols for obtaining millions of single short reads. We thus obtained two raw data sets corresponding to the RNA encapsidated by FHV virions and VLPs-hereafter termed the FHV-RNAseq and VLP-RNAseq data sets. We applied a stringent quality filter to our data sets, as described in Materials and Methods, obtaining a total of 28.9 millions and 19.6 millions reads all exactly 95 nt in length for the FHV-RNAseq and VLP-RNAseq data sets, respectively.
