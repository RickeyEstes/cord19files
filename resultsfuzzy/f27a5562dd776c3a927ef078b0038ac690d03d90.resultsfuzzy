Major findings for patient contacts are as follows: (1) the number of patient contacts (degree) are not related to patient demographic characteristics, but the time-weighted number of contacts (weighted degree) for black patients were higher than for non-black patients; (2) there are differences in number of contacts based on arrival mode and staff role; and (3) the effect of arrival mode is modified by the extent of crowding. With respect to arrival mode, EMS patients have a more consistent geographic pathway of care while patients arriving by other modes are more ambulatory and therefore more easily moved between various waiting, evaluation and treatment areas (for example waiting room, triage, registration, imaging, treatment rooms). Patients arriving by EMS enter through the ambulance bay entry and are moved directly into a treatment room where traditional arrival activities occur (e.g., registration, triage, specimen collection, EKG, etc.). In contrast, for "ambulatory" patients, traditional arrival activities occur in a variety of locations to which the patient moves as opposed to a single treatment room. Thus the increasing number of contacts that is associated with increased crowding does not affect EMS patients -as it does patients arriving by other modes -since they are effectively sequestered in a single room, leading to the observed statistical interaction. As for SP contacts, degree, weighted degree, and relative degree are all increased with crowding; thus in crowded conditions, staff have more contacts of longer duration with more patients. Because the provider to patient ratio is smaller than the non-provider staff to patient ratio, providers may become task saturated at an earlier point as conditions become more crowded and therefore become the rate limiting step in care delivery. For SS relative degree, providers < nurses < other, which suggests that the nonclinical staff work within smaller spaces filled with other staff colleagues. We will be exploring this possibility further in a planned future analysis of the geography of contacts.
