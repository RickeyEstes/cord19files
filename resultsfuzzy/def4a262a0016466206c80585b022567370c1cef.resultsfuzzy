Tregs, defined by the lineage marker forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), promote self-tolerance and limit autoimmunity (Belkaid and Tarbell, 2009; Campbell and Koch, 2011; Kim et al., 2007) , and altered Treg function is implicated in the manifestation of many autoimmune syndromes (Buckner, 2010) . Most severely, in the complete absence of Tregs, as exemplified by Treg-deficient scurfy mice or individuals carrying non-functional versions of the Foxp3 gene, life-threatening multi-organ autoimmunity and lymphoproliferative diseases manifest in early development (Brunkow et al., 2001; Gambineri et al., 2003) . Given the importance of Tregs in regulating conventional T cells, we extensively examined activation and homing molecule expression patterns on Tregs within CC-RIX lines. Most notably, there is a full range of Treg expression levels of the immunosuppressive marker CD73 across CC-RIX mice, from 3.5%-97.8% ( Figure 3A) . Similarly, the average frequency of Tregs from CC-RIX lines that expressed CTLA-4, a critical suppressive mechanism, ranged from 11.2%-86.2%. Finally, there were wide ranges of Tregs expressing CD44 and homing molecule b1 integrin (CD29) across CC-RIX lines ( Figures 3C and 3D ). Thus, our thorough analysis demonstrates the variation in Treg-mediated immunoregulation dependent on host genetics, thus providing a rich resource for additional immunoregulatory and immunogenetics research. Because of the large variation in frequency of Tregs we observed in overtly healthy and age-matched mice, similar to what has been observed in humans ( Figure 1E ), we further interrogated for a possible relationship between the number of Tregs and their suppressive capacity to address the question of whether Treg function could compensate for altered Treg frequency to maintain the overall health of the host. First we performed a linear regression analysis of Treg number by CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation, as indicated by Ki67 expression, or activation, indicated by CD44 or absence of CD62L expression. There was not a statistically significant correlation between Treg number and T cell proliferation or activation ( Figure S3 ), suggesting that mice with varying numbers of Tregs are equally able to control T cell proliferation and activation. This finding supported our hypothesis that mice with lower Treg numbers may compensate for this by having increased Treg activation or Treg-suppressive capacity to control immune activation, similar to mice with a higher number of total Tregs. Thus, we tested for correlations between Treg number and the frequency of various Treg activation or suppression markers and found that there was indeed a statistically significant inverse correlation between the number of Tregs and the frequency of Tregs expressing CTLA-4, CXCR3, or inducible T cell costimulator (ICOS) ( Figures  3E-3G) . Thus, our data support a model in which mice with lower numbers of Tregs may compensate for this by having increased activation or suppressive capacity of Tregs to maintain tolerance and overall health. Alternatively, mice with less functional or suppressive Tregs may have a compensatory expansion, perhaps because reduced suppression of T cells, mediated by CTLA-4, for example, results in abundance of IL-2 that can thus support expansion of the Treg population. Together, our data demonstrate that mice on different genetic backgrounds support a wide range of Treg frequencies while maintaining health, at least in part by altering the suppressive function of Tregs. Mouse Model Development Using the CC As demonstrated above, there is tremendous phenotypic diversity generated within T cell subsets dependent on the natural standing genetic variation available within the CC. To provide an example of the utility of the CC for development of new mouse models for immunology research, we focused on the extreme diversity observed in the frequency of Tregs ( Figure 1D ). The vast majority of research on Tregs over the past 15 years has used C57BL/6J mice, which have a population of Tregs comprising approximately 10% of the total CD4 T cell compartment within the spleen. To identify potential mouse models with different Treg frequencies (e.g., akin to the diversity observed in human cohorts; Figure 1E ), we further examined the frequency of Tregs in CC-RI strains that served as dams or sires in matings that resulted in CC-RIX lines at the extreme ends of Treg frequency ( Figure 1D ). We found that CC-RI strains CC030/GeniUnc, CC061/GeniUnc, CC051/TauUnc, and CC003/Unc had average Treg frequencies of 12.03%, 7.05%, 8.47%, and 4.66%, respectively ( Figure 3H) . Notably, none of these RI lines had Treg frequencies that were elevated or decreased to the extremes observed in the CC-RIX screen, although CC030 does have a consistently lower frequency of Tregs and might represent a model of decreased Treg activity. These results highlight the potential for emergent phenotypes within heterozygous animals (e.g., because of epistatic genetic interactions) and further underscore the utility of assessing F1 crosses to increase both the genetic and phenotypic diversity assessed. QTL Mapping Using the CC The CC was initially conceived of as a powerful resource for genetic mapping studies and integrated systems genetics approaches . To measure the amount of phenotypic variation attributable to genetic differences, we calculated the intraclass correlation (ICC) (Gelman and Hill, 2007) measures as an estimate of heritability (Table S4 ). In addition, to demonstrate the overall immune system phenotypic diversity among CC-RIX lines, we performed principal-component analysis (PCA) using the flow cytometry measures listed in Table S4 (using strain average values) and then plotted the top two principal components (PCs) to show strain clustering within these composite immune phenotypes ( Figure S4 ). This analysis demonstrates that there is tremendous overall immune system phenotypic diversity across the CC-RIX and not just diversity within single immune measures, as demonstrated in Figures 1,  2 , and 3. Further, although there is diversity among the lines with regard to multiple different cell populations, there are also a number of lines with quite extreme phenotypes that may thus be suitable for follow-up studies. Next, to demonstrate the utility of the CC for identifying QTLs contributing to population-wide variations in steadystate immune phenotypes, we performed QTL mapping on select T cell phenotypes using our flow cytometry data in combination with haplotype reconstructions of the CC strains generated from the mouse universal genotyping array (Mega-MUGA) platform (Morgan et al., 2015) . Through these proofof-concept studies, we identified several QTL candidates for follow-up, and below we highlight examples chosen because of high logarithm of the odds ratio (LOD) scores and clear founder effects. First, we found a QTL (Host Immunity 1, HI1) driving the frequency of CD73+ Tregs within the X chromosome near position 160 Mb-telomere ( Figure 4A ) that appears to be driven largely by a PWK/PhJ founder effect ( Figure 4B ). Confirming this locus, CC-RIX lines with a PWK/PhJ haplotype at position 166 Mb of the X chromosome have frequencies of CD73+ Tregs that are on the upper end of the range we observed across all CC-RIXs examined (Figures 3A and 4C ). This has clear implications on host immunoregulation at steady state because there is an inverse correlation between CD73+ Treg frequency and the frequency of activated CD8 or CD4 T cells ( Figure 4D ). To narrow our QTL regions to likely candidate genes, we utilized whole-genome sequence information from the 8 founder strains of the CC (Keane et al., 2011) . Guided by the allele effects underlying the QTL analysis (estimates of in which founder haplotype(s) causative genetic variants occur), we sought to identify genetic variants within the QTL regions that were consistent with allele effects underlying the QTL and also had an effect on the amino acid sequence and/or splice forms of a gene because these variants would be the highest-priority candidates for altering protein function. Accordingly, within the QTL, a total of 102,596 SNPs and 20,432 insertions or deletions (indels) segregate across the CC population. Of these, 248 SNPs and 14 indels cause coding or splice differences across 43 genes. Because a PWK/PhJ allele was the sole allele contributing to phenotypic differences, we focused on private PWK/PhJ variants. We identified 36 private PWK/PhJ SNPs and 2 indels within 22 genes (Table 1) as potential causal candidates. In addition to this QTL, we also identified a highly significant QTL (HI2) within the X chromosome at position 100-106 Mb driving the frequency of CXCR3+ Tregs ( Figure 5A ), CXCR3+ CD4+, and CD8+ T cells (data not shown). When we examined the founder effects, we found that PWK/PhJ again was a significant driver of this QTL for all three phenotypes ( Figure 5B and data not shown), with a clear trend toward low levels of CXCR3 expression on all three subsets of T cells of CC-RIX lines when there were PWK/PhJ variants at position 105.5 Mb on the X chromosome ( Figures 5C and 5D and data not shown). However, this QTL had a more complex pattern of allele effects depending on the phenotype. Although, in all cases, a PWK/PhJ allele drives a decreased frequency of CXCR3+ T cells for any of the three subsets of T cells, there is additional evidence for phenotype-specific allele effects leading to increases in frequency of each of these specific cell types. Specifically, there is a WSB/EiJ haplotype associated with increased CXCR3+ CD8+ T cells and also an NZO/HILtJ haplotype increasing CXCR3+ Tregs ( Figures 5B  and 5E ). In this 6-Mb region, a total of 55,082 SNPs and 12,377 indels segregate within the CC. This includes 149 nonsynonymous SNPs and 11 indels across 42 genes. PWK has 35 private SNPs and 5 private indels in 26 genes; NZO has 4 SNPs and 1 indel in 4 genes (Table 1) . WSB/EiJ has no private SNPs or indels within this region, suggesting that the effects of the WSB/EiJ haplotype may be due to regulatory variation. Of note, genes within this X chromosome QTL driving the low frequency of CXCR3+ T cells include Cxcr3 itself (Table 1) , likely demonstrating novel gene variants that result in altered expression levels within T cells. CXCR3 is a critical chemokine receptor used by T cells and other immune cells to migrate to tissue sites of infection and sites of autoimmune reactions, and Tbet+ CXCR3+ Tregs have been shown to provide protection from autoimmune diabetes (Tan et al., 2016) . Further study of CC-RI or CC-RIX with the PWK/PhJ haplotype in this region could better model human disease associated with altered T cell migratory activity and also be used to study the importance and function of this chemokine receptor itself. Finally, we identified a third candidate QTL within the X chromosome at position 140-145 Mb (HI3) driving the frequency of ICOS+ Tregs in the spleen ( Figure 6A ). Although this ICOS+ Treg result does not meet the threshold for statistical significance in our analysis, the allele effects are clear, and we include it here as an example of the diverse allele effects seen in the RIX population. An examination of the founder allele effects at this locus revealed that the PWK/PhJ haplotype was associated with an increased frequency of ICOS+ Tregs ( Figures 6B and 6C) , accounting for the extreme frequency at the higher ranges (Figure 6D) . However, there also appeared to be a second, NZO/ HILtJ allele that had an intermediate increase in ICOS+ Tregs relative to the other six haplotypes ( Figure 6B ). Within this region, there are a total of 51,137 SNPs and 10,884 indels segregating in the CC. Of these, 58 SNPs and 5 indels cause coding or splice differences in 18 genes. PWK/PhJ has 17 private SNPs and 2 private indels across 11 genes (Table 1 ). In contrast, NZO/HILtJ has no SNPs or indels, either private or shared, with PWK/PhJ in this region, suggesting the potential for regulatory variants to play a role in this locus. In summary, we highlight examples of QTL analysis for immunoregulatory phenotypes at homeostasis, with several potential candidate genes under the QTL identified for follow-up studies.
