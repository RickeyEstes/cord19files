A.2. Clinicopathological effect of ORT infection + IB 4/91 vaccination: Moderate clinical signs in the form of dullness, ruffled feathers, and rales were observed at 3 to 6 dpi without any mortality. Post-mortem examination of the 3 sacrificed birds revealed moderate tracheitis with presence of exudates, congestion in the lung, and bilateral air sacculitis at 3 and 10 dpi. The ORT infective strain was re-isolated from all 10 tracheal swabs as early as 3 and 10 dpi, and confirmed both morphologically and biochemically. A.3. Histopathological findings of the 3 sacrificed birds of group 1: Air sacs: Air sacs at 3 dpi showed severe thickening with mononuclear cell infiltration, as well as diffuse epithelial necrosis and fibrinous exudate covering the epithelial surface (Figure 4) . At 10 dpi, air sacculitis showed reduced severity in mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrations besides congestion. Lungs: Pulmonary lesions at 3 dpi appeared as granulomatous pneumonia, represented by aggregation of inflammatory cells with fibrosis pleuritis, desquamated necrotic epithelium and fibrin deposits in the parabronchial space. The same lesions showed marked perivascular edema at 10 dpi ( Figure 5 ). Trachea: At 3 dpi, the tracheal mucosa showed catarrhal tracheitis, goblet cell hyperplasia, lymphocytic cell infiltrations; loss of cilia was also observed and continued at 10 dpi, with mucosal and glandular epithelial hyperplasia, congestion and mononuclear cell infiltrations ( Figure 6) . B.1. The effect of ORT infection alone on final Bwt., total WG, and final FCR: ORT infection alone caused a decrease (P ≤ 0.05) in Bwt. by 221.7 gm (9.27%) and in total WG by 213.71 g (9.76%) compared to the control group. Total FCR in chicken group 2 was no different (P ≥ 0.05) from other groups.
