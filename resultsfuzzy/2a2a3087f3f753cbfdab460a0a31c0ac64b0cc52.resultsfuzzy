The predicted risks associated with the different types of replacement breeding cattle movements across the three study analyses are summarized in Table 5 . Overall, open beef cows with a calf at foot, pregnant beef heifers, and The percentage of simulation replicates that resulted in the generation of at least one additional PI calf in the herd within 2 years of the original seeding event. The results are based on a dynamic within-herd simulation model that makes use of the explicit demographic structure and movement patterns of 2895 beef herds and 546 dairy herds in Scotland from records stored in the Cattle Tracing System (CTS) database. A total of 1000 replicates were performed for each disease seeding event in the herds to capture the stochastic variation in the probability of purchased replacement breeding cattle being persistently or transiently infected with BVDV and the probability of generating at least one additional PI calf in the herd following disease introduction. The odds of particular types of replacement breeding cattle causing outbreaks were expressed relative to the "open heifer" group, which had the highest probability of being PI based on the average animal age at time of purchase. open dairy heifers were associated with the highest potential risk of causing BVDV outbreaks through cattle movements.
