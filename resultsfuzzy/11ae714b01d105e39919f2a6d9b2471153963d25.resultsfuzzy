The Enterobacter cloacae isolates from the transmission event were whole genome sequenced to investigate their identity. They depicted an identical new multilocus sequence type (allele variants depicted in Table 3 ), and carried both the AmpC beta-lactamase bla ACT-7 and the fosfomycin resistance gene fosA, indicating a clonal spread.
