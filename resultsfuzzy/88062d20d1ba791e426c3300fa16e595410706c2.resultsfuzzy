The baggage carousel expansion planning results for 3 years are shown in Table 10 . Twenty-three baggage carousels at Incheon International Airport were considered the candidate group for expansion from 2013 through 2015. As a result, baggage carousel no. 18 was expanded during the first quarter of 2013, baggage carousels no. 17 and no. 19 were expanded during the first quarter of 2014 and baggage carousel no. 5 was expanded during the first quarter of 2015. In 2013, the total over-waiting time after expanding baggage carousel no. 18 (TO-BE) was approximately 28,778,730 h, and the total over-waiting time before expanding the baggage carousel (AS-IS) was approximately 2,913,143 h. The passenger benefit after expanding the baggage carousel was calculated by multiplying the decrement of over-waiting time by the value of passenger time. The passenger benefit was $ 779,071.31 and the expansion cost was $ 473,098.33. Therefore, the B/C ratio of expanding no. 18 in 2013 is 1.65. Then, when we considered that baggage carousel no. 5 was added in 2013, the B/C ratio of expanding baggage carousels no. 5 and no. 18 at that time was 0.653. Thus, baggage carousel no. 18 was determined as the expansion carousel for 2013. In 2014, we first analyzed one baggage carousel expansion based on the AS-IS total over-waiting time of the expansion plan of 2013. Expanding baggage carousel no. 19 was the optimal solution, and the B/C ratio was approximately 2.41. We then used the AS-IS total over-waiting time (2,951,139.48 h) of the optimal expansion plan of one baggage carousel in 2014 to test the expansion test for two baggage carousels. The result was that the expansion of baggage carousels no. 17 and no. 19 was possible in 2014 (the B/C ratio ¼ 1.79) and no. 5 in 2015 (B/C ratio ¼ 1.76), respectively. According to the results, the expanded baggage carousels are included in gates with a high arrival rate and have a high allocation rate of baggage carousels. The allocation rate of baggage carousel no. 5 in gate B (25.59%) is 30.17%, and the allocation rate of baggage carousels nos. 17, 18, 19 in gate E (22.71%) is 22.22%, 30.64%, and 31.82%, respectively. Regarding expansion periods, all expansions occurred within a particular quarter of each year, and these periods had a relatively low passenger demand level. Therefore, expanding baggage carousels with high allocation rates during the relatively low demand period is more likely to produce good results for the plan to expand capacity at Incheon International Airport.
