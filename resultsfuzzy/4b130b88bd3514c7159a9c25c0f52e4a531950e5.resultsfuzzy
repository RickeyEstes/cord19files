After removing sequences representing less than 0.005 % of the total abundance, the median number of sequences per sample was 5407 (min.: 2760; max.: 8589; sd: 1283.3). When sequences were clustered at 97 % sequence identity 384 operational taxonomical units (OTUs) were identified. Taxonomic analysis identified 11 bacterial phyla, containing 80 genera, 53 of which were successfully identified with >80 % confidence. The most commonly amplified bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes) did not vary significantly over time (Fig. 3) . Streptococcus, Prevotella, Veillonella, Rothia, and Haemophilus were the 5 most common bacterial genera amplified, together accounting for 63.8 % of the total number of sequences. These genera contained 101 species level OTUs, 20 of which were successfully identified (>90 % sequence similarity).
