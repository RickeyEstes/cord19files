In this section, various simulations are conducted for the purpose of mimicking the epidemic spreading process on a community. The investigated community consists of N individuals (here, N = 10 0 0 for an illustration). The size of the community varies due to the fatal property of the epidemic. Furthermore, the studied community is assumed to be composed of two-layers (i.e., a physical layer and a virtual one). Hence, the effects of incorporating virtual layer on the epidemic spreading process can also be analyzed. The analyses here are conducted through MC simulation, which is furthermore validated through theoretical analyses. Simulation stops if stationary states or anticipated time steps are achieved. For each layer, the network topology is assumed to be a WS network, where each node relates to 4 nodes with the rewiring probability 1.0. Firstly, simulations are conducted for the UAU-SIRD model in Fig. 7 (a) (the model without t m ) . For comparison, theoretical analyses are also performed through the application of the formulas 2 and 3 . We mainly focus on the evolution of fractions of susceptible/dead/infected/recovered individuals. In Fig. 7 (a) , the obtained theoretical results are denoted by solid lines while the simulation results are indicated by solid points. As we see, the accuracy of the UAU-SIRD model is validated by the theoretical analysis. In particular, Pro I increases first which is incurred by the spreading of the epidemic; nevertheless, this value reduces after reaching the peak. This is due to the reason that the infected individuals are either recovered or dead and finally vanish after reaching the stationary state. Furthermore, in order to reflect the importance of considering virtual layer, the scenario of SIRD model without virtual layer is also shown (the fractions of dead and recovered individuals are illustrated) in Fig. 7 (b) . Compared with the scenario without virtual layer, the proportion of dead individuals with awareness decreases apparently; which is incurred by the information diffusion making susceptible individuals be aware of the epidemic. In such a case, preventive measures can be taken, and the infection probability is multiplied by a factor γ (0 < γ < 1). This indicates that the awareness of epidemic can reduce the infection probability of epidemic, which is also consistent with common sense. Furthermore, we can also conclude that the proportion of recovered individual will increase apparently if the virtual layer is considered. Nevertheless, before the stationary state, the range of individuals being affected/dead with virtual layer seems to be larger than that without virtual layer. Then, the effects of varying parameters on the focused value (the fractions of individuals being affected (i.e., P ro R + P ro D )) are shown in Fig. 8 . In Fig. 8 (a) , the effect of varying parameters combination of μ and λ on P ro R + P ro D is obtained through simulation-based approach. For validation, theoretical analyses are also presented in Fig. 8 (b) . For fixed λ, the range of individuals being affected reduces with the increase of μ since more individuals will be recovered if the recovering rate increases. For fixed μ, the proportion of individuals being affected reduces with the increase of λ. This is due to the reason that it is more easily for the epidemic information spreading process among nodes on the virtual layer. It indicates that the susceptible individuals are more likely to become aware of epidemic. Hence, the infection probability declines as a susceptible individual with awareness takes preventive measures. This will further reduce the infection probability for susceptible individuals. It thus becomes natural that the range of individuals being affected reduces. Next, if the recovery model depicted by Fig. 6 is investigated, corresponding analyses results performed through simulation-based approach are presented in Fig. 9 (a) . For comparison, the simulation results with t m = 10 are also presented in Fig. 9 (b) . It is clear that the number of dead individuals increases first and reaches a steady value after certain time steps (similar trends exist for the recovered individuals). However, the proportion of dead individuals increases, and the fraction of recovered individuals decreases apparently if t m is considered. Furthermore, the peak of proportion of infected individuals comes later for the scenario with t m yet the peak possesses a larger value. Moreover, as indicated by Fig. 9 (b) , the landmark of the curve for the proportion of recovered individuals is supposed to be at time step 10 marked by a circle; this is affected by the pre-provided recovery time for the investigated disease. For instance, the initially infected individuals can only be recovered at time step 10 if corresponding death does not occur; thus, the proportion of recovered individuals equals to 0 before 10th time step. To investigate the effects of different recovery time on the epidemic spreading process, analyses of several scenarios are presented in Fig. 10 . Here, the fraction of recovered and dead individuals is mainly focused and three scenarios with different t m (here, t m = 3, 6, 9) are considered. As indicated by the results, the recovery process of infected individual is advanced for smaller t m . The fraction of recovered individuals is larger if shorter recovery time t m is adopted while similar trends exist for the fraction of dead individuals. Furthermore, we also investigated the proportion of recovered/dead individuals if stationary state is achieved with the increment of t m (1 ≤ t m ≤ 10) in Fig. 10 (c) , respectively. As we see, for larger t m , the increasing of dead individuals or decreasing of recovered individuals becomes slower. Then, we try to analyze the effects of varying parameters on the focused values for the UAU-SIRD model with t m . For simplicity, the fraction of dead individuals is focused through simulation-based approach. Corresponding simulation results for the fraction of dead individuals and the parameter combination of μ d and λ are provided in Fig. 11 (a) for the scenario with t m = 4. Furthermore, theoretical results are also derived through adopting Eqs. (4) - ( 6 ) , while corresponding results are illustrated in Fig. 11 (b) . During the analysis for Fig. 11 , t m is set to be 4. Here, we mainly focus on the fraction of dead individuals for different parameter combination of μ d and λ (here, 0 ≤ μ d ≤ 0.5, 0 ≤ λ ≤ 0.7). As per the results in Fig. 11 (a) and (b) , for certain μ d (which is relative smaller), the varying of λ seems to play a trivial role in determining the proportion of dead individuals. This is also validated by the theoretical analyses. Nevertheless, for larger μ d , the increase of λ, to some extent, is capable of reducing the fraction of dead individuals. Furthermore, we also incorporate the relationship between the fraction of dead individuals and the parameters combination of γ and λ (here, 0 ≤ γ ≤ 0.5, 0 ≤ λ ≤ 0.7). The results obtained through simulation-based and theoretical analyses are presented in Fig. 11 (c) and (d) respectively. As indicated in Fig. 11 (c) and (d) , for a small and fixed γ , the fraction of dead individual decreases with the increase of λ. This also confirms the previous conclusion of incorporating virtual layers (similar to reducing the value of λ) on the epidemic spreading process. Nevertheless, for large γ , the increasing of λ seems to have less impact. This is due to the fact that for large γ , the reduced amount of infection probability is limited, which indicates that it is almost unmeaningful for the individual to be aware as there is less impact with taking preventive measures.
