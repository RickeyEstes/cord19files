A range of different pattern signals are directly correlated to specific diseases. Hence, chemical signals can serve for medical target identification, diagnosis, and actuation [1] . For the problem of a pandemic virus, the nanorobots are used for identifying and to predict bloodstream protein parameters, which can prevent against chemical reactivity hazards. A set of proteins or specific self-assembled chemical cells can be characterized as a typical virus, with profound consequences for a large population in the case of epidemic proliferation. Nanobioelectronics, using nanowires as material for embedded biosensors and integrated circuit packaging, can achieve maximal efficiency for applications regarding chemical changes [5] . Thus, using chemical sensors, nanorobots can be programmed to detect different levels of distinct proteins. The nanorobot should be useful, therefore, to find a virus, which may be proliferating into a person's bloodstream through cell invasion. Integrated nanobiosensors can be utilized enabling precise cell biology interfaces, and detecting different concentrations of chemical signals inside the body, it should provide real time medical monitoring to fight an epidemic disease in initial stages of contamination [12, 105, 106] . The chemical detection in a complex dynamic environment is an important factor to consider for nanorobots in the task of interacting with the human body. The nanorobots need to track the influenza development before a pandemic outbreak happens. The main cell morphological changes, given influenza infection, were taken for modelling bloodstream, which provides the necessary environment for medical nanorobot interaction analysis and prototyping (Figs. 8 and 9 ). The application of ultra-high frequency satellite communications network can be successfully applied for nanorobot data transmission, using wireless phones for long distance communication [7, 68, 69, 107] . The cell phone PDA (personal digital assistant) system provides also the person's identification with respective position for the moment the nanorobot detected some virus protein profile (Fig. 10) . Carbon nanotubes serve as ideal materials for the basis of a CMOS IC biosensor. In fact, carbon based sensor has been used successfully for in vivo protein detection [108] . Considering the importance of alpha-NAGA against neuroaxonal dystrophy [109] , small concentrations of this protein inside body can cause some false positives. Typical concentrations of alpha-NAGA protein are less than 1 nmole/min/106 cells. Normal concentrations of alpha-NAGA in the bloodstream are in average less than 2µl. For a person infected with influenza, alpha-NAGA concentrations from blood sample increases, ranging from 1.26 to 4.63 nmole/min/106 cells [16] . Therefore, if the nanorobot's electrochemical sensor detects alpha-NAGA in low quantities or inside expected gradients, it generates a weak signal lower than 50nA. In such case the nanorobot ignores the alpha-NAGA concentration, assuming it as expected levels of bloodstream concentration. However, if the alpha-NAGA reaches concentration higher than 3µl, it produces a current flow that corresponds to the rate of antigen enzymatic reaction, which generates a current higher than 80nA (Fig. 11) , hence activating the nanorobot. Every time it happens (Fig. 12) , the nanorobot emits an electromagnetic signal back-propagated for the monitoring integrated platform, which records the cell phone PDA associated with the person identification [107] . This approach can enable the headquarters to automatically identify the person infected with influenza, and send an urgent SMS to multiple recipients. Therefore, the members of a same group can take the necessary action to immediately assist who was infected, avoiding any possible pandemic outbreak. As a threshold to avoid noise distortions and achieve a higher resolution, at least a total of 100 nanorobots must emit a higher proteomic signal transduction for a same person (Fig. 13 ). In such case, the system considers a strong evidence of influenza contamination. Thus, the medical nanorobot can be extremely useful to identify a patient with early development of influenza (Fig. 14) .
