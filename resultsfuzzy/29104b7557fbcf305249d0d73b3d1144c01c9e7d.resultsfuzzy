Infrared absorption spectroscopy of the reaction product resulting from the heat and hydrochloric acid treatment of pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol An infrared absorption (IR) spectrum of the reaction product was recorded in a solid potassium bromide (KBr) pellet (Fig. 2) . No a,b-unsaturated, quinoid carbonyl absorption at wavenumbers between 1700 and 1600 cm À1 could be seen. Instead a very broad OH band between 3650 and 1800 cm À1 dominates the IR spectrum. It represents a valence bond vibration of hydrogen-bonded O-H, and, respectively, intra/intermolecular polymeric associated chelate O-H. At 2900 cm À1 a methyl group C-H and at 2825 cm À1 a methylene group C-H valence bond vibration can be identified. At 1590 and 1520 cm À1 C-C aromatic valence bond vibrations of a pyridine heterocycle can be detected. At wavenumbers of 1430 cm À1 a methylene C-H deformation vibration and 1395 cm À1 a methyl group C-H deformation vibration can be analyzed. Very characteristic is the aromatic C-O phenolic valence bond vibration at 1210 cm À1 . The two bands at 1065 cm À1 (Ar-CH 2 -OH) and 1110 cm À1 are aliphatic C-O valence bond vibrations. The absorption band at 820 cm À1 is fitting to a 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted aromate with one isolated CH. Taken together, already the IR data unequivocally proof the unusual 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl) -2 -methyl -4 -pyridinyl] -2,8,9 -trioxaadamantane-3,5,7-triol structure because the 6-hydroxy -4 -(hydroxymethyl) -1-methyl -8H- [1] benzopyrano [2,3c] pyridin-8-one alternative would have a strong a,bunsaturated, quinoid carbonyl absorption between wavenumbers of 1775 and 1650 cm À1 (preferably 1650-1700 cm À1 , p-benzoquinone 1669 cm À1 ). The predominant, very broad OH band from 3650 to 1800 cm À1 peaking at 3350 cm À1 pointed to strongly associated intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the solid state of the brown substance KBr pellet. A similar effect was observed in the IR spectrum (in KBr) of the polyhydroxyl, solvent-retaining compound tetrodotoxin. 3 UV spectrophotometry of the reaction product resulting from the heat and hydrochloric acid treatment of pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol An UV electronic absorption spectrum of the substance was recorded in 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution (Fig. 3) . The solubility of the material in water, ethanol, or dilute acid [dilute hydrochloric (HCl) and sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 )] is too low to work in these solvents. The product is soluble in sodium hydroxide solution and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to give yellow to brown solutions. The UV spectrum showed two maxima at 220.0 nm (e=22,443 L mol À1 cm À1 ) and 285.8 nm (e=11,591 L mol À1 cm À1 ), the molar mass for the cal- Figure 1 . The natural products tetrodotoxin and daigremontianin with oligo-oxa-adamantane structure and the synthetic adamantanes, or tricyclo[3.3.1.1 3, 7 ]decanes, amantadine, rimantadine, tromantadine, and memantine. culation of the molar extinction coefficient " was choosed as M=327.29 g/mol, the theoretic molar mass of 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyridinyl]-2,8,9-trioxaadamantane-3,5,7-triol (Fig. 3 ). This result can be reasonably interpreted in the way that a typical sodium phenolate [sodium phenolate in water: l 1,max =235 nm (e=9400), l 2,max =287 nm (e=2600)] is the chromophor of the compound. The structure 6hydroxy-4-(hydroxymethyl)-1-methyl-8H- [1] benzopyrano [2,3-c] pyridin-8-one would show an electronic absorption maximum at a wavelength of approximately 450 nm similar to the a,b-unsaturated carbonyl condensate B6PR. 11 Therefore, the UV spectrophotometry supplies us with strong evidence for 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyridinyl]-2,8,9-trioxaada-mantane-3,5,7-triol to represent the UV chromophor of the unknown product. Already now the spectral-analytic structure determination provides growing proof for being 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyridinyl] -2,8,9 -trioxatricyclo[3.3.1.1 3,7 ]decane -3,5,7 -triol the suspected structural composition of the material in question. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR) spectroscopy of the reaction product resulting from the heat and hydrochloric acid treatment of pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol The final structural proof could be made by examination of the 1 H NMR spectrum of the substance in deuterated chloroform (CDCl 3 ) (Fig. 4) . At the chemical shift d 2.50 a singlet of three protons of the heteroaromatic methyl group peaked. At d 3.32 six protons of the methylene groupings of the trioxa-adamantane-triol could be unequivocally identified. At d 4.85 (m, 2H, pyridine CH 2 OH) and d 5.90 (m, 1H, CH 2 OH) the intermolecular-associated hydroxymethyl group gave broadened multiplets emerging possibly from interaromatic charge-transfer complexation and hydrogen-bonding. At d 8.11 one heteroaromatic proton proofed to complete that no other structural composition was possible than 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl) -2 -methyl -4 -pyridinyl] -2,8,9 -trioxatricyclo[3.3.1.1 3,7 ]decane-3,5,7-triol. Ethanol, water, and the educt pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol were detectable as trace impurities from synthesis.
