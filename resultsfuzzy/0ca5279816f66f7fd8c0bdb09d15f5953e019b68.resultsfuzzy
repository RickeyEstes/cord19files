e cultured results of the samples were recorded. When the filter membrane method is in countable, the total number of colonies (CFU/piece) = (CFU/plate) × 50. When the filter membrane method is countable, the total number of colonies (CFU/piece) = (CFU/plate) + (CFU/ filter membrane). In the formula, " " is the average number of colonies on two parallel plates, and " " is the number of colonies on the filter membrane. When the colony number of the three methods are 0 CFU/, <1 CFU/ is used to represent the colony number of the three methods. Among them, the result was confirmed as negative if the number of bacterial colonies in the culture results was <1 CFU/piece, and the result was confirmed as positive if ≥1 CFU/piece.
