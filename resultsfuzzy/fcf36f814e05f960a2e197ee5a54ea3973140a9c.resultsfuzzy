New initiatives such as the UN Prequalifi cation Programme managed by the WHO (section 3) and the EMA's Article 58 391 adapt regulatory activities to global health purposes. Under Article 58, the EMA provides scientifi c assessments, in coordination with WHO, of medicinal products for human use in markets outside the EU. 392 Since 2007, US federal legislation has allowed for priority review vouchers (PRVs). However, PRVs have been criticised because there is no provision that the product should be made available and aff ordable, and PRVs can also be used for products already registered outside of the USA or by a company that did not invest in the R&D. 378, 393 A marketed antituberculosis medicine, bedaquiline, was off ered for prices of around $3000 in MICs and $900 in LICs. Yet in the USA it was marketed for $30 000 per treatment, despite having received a PRV and fast-track approval by the US Food and Drug Administration. Eff orts are underway to include access and novelty requirements into the legislation. 394 New regulations to encourage paediatric medicine development have been introduced by the USA 395 and the EU. 396 As of 2008, all new applications in the EU must include data for children (0-17 years) unless a specifi c waiver is approved. An increase in new paediatric formulations is possible, 397 yet the costs to society might become higher than the actual R&D investment. Whether these innovations meet priority needs or are primarily used to extend the market exclusivity of products with predominantly adult indications remains unclear. 398, 399 In 2016, the EU initiated a review of R&D incentive mechanisms, including those for paediatric R&D, to strengthen the balance of pharmaceutical systems in Europe. 400 Regulatory approval of new essential medicines poses great challenges, for example with onerous studies needed for new paediatric formulations 401 or assessments of new medicines for neglected diseases not prevalent in countries with stringent regulatory authorities. The Commission asserts that assessments of new medicines for neglected diseases should be led by regulatory authorities in the aff ected areas. These institutions will probably need further strengthening to do such reviews, through enhanced collaboration with stringent regulatory authorities and the WHO/UN Prequalifi cation Programme (section 3). Regional regulatory initiatives within zones with similar disease patterns should also be supported.
