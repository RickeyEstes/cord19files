Plasma immunoglobulin response. Specific anticcv-c54 IgM was detected in plasma from day 3 onwards, peaking initially at day 5 and then a second peak occurring in the one remaining dog on day 11 (Fig 2a) . Specific anti-ccv-c54 IgG was detected in plasma at low levels on days 4 to 7, peaking by day 10 before declining in the one remaining dog to moderate levels over the following four days (Fig 2b) . No specific anti-coY-c54 IgA was detected in any plasma sample at any time. Duodenal juice immunoglobulin response. In general, all three immunoglobulin classes to ccv-c54 were detected in duodenal juice (Fig 3) . Specific anticfv-c54 IgM levels peaked on day 3 after infection and declined gradually over the following 11 days (Fig 3) . No IgM was demonstrable on day 14. Anticcv-c54 IgG was first detected on day 7 and increased gradually over the following week, remaining elevated at day 14 (Fig 3) . Specific anti-cfv-c54 IgA increased gradually up to day 14 approximately paralleling the IgG response (Fig 3) ,
