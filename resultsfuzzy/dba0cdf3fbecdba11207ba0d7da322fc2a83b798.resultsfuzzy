In the self-assessment, the PoK taskforce reported that 39.8% of the 88 assessment indicators (seven indicators were not applicable for seaports) had been 'fully implemented', 53.4% had been 'partially implemented', while 6.8% were evaluated as 'not implemented'. The total score of the PoK was 77%. It was found that the communication link with senior health officials and SOPs for assessing urgent reports and disseminating information from the WHO were to be established. In addition, inspectors found a lack of knowledge about water management, swimming pool/spa, and air quality management on ships and terminal facilities. Emergency planning and PPEs toward radiological and chemical events were either absent or out of date, and a place had not been designated for decontamination. Concerning the preliminary external assessment, the total score of the PoK was 97%. Among the 88 assessing indicators, 76.7% were assessed as 'fully implemented', 22.2% as 'partially implemented', and 1.1% as 'not implemented'. The reviewer observed that, similar to the problems identified at the TIA, agencies in the PoK sometimes omitted the dissemination of the information to their partners in the PoEs. On the other hand, since the inspection of conveyances are sometimes closely linked with the management and the inspection of the port facilities (i.e. potable water, ballast water, and waste are transported between ships and seaport), it was appreciated that the PoK improved cross-sectional capacities by holding joint training programs for both ship and facility inspectors. In terms of emergencies, the reviewer perceived that the response system in the PoK has been improved since the self-assessment. It was also highly valued that the PoK planned 'cross-unit human resources support programs', which aimed to seek personnel belonging to other PoEs to support large-scale events immediately. It might help the surge capacity at the port in total. The previous two assessments provided the PoK with clear clues to identify their action plan, which was as follows: 1) Re-examining the communication flow, taking into account private sectors such as shipping agents; 2) completing the emergency response protocols toward PHEIC. Protocols shall not only be approved by both PoE stakeholders and central authorities, but also tested by drill exercises; and 3) taking the IHR core capacity requirements into consideration while planning the new travel center, especially for terminal facilities such as water supply system, waste management, toilets, food/ beverage services. External reviewers of the follow-up assessment scored the PoK 99.9% (Fig. 4) , which implied that 97.8% of the assessment indicators had been 'fully implemented', and 2.2% were 'partially implemented'. It was mentioned that the SOPs and arrangements were in place with several hospitals for the diagnosis and treatment of ill travelers, and isolation, if required, including those affected by radiation, toxic chemicals, or explosives. It was noted that the PoK Disaster Mitigation and Prevention Program had been integrated to handle chemical, microbiological, and radiological emergencies. The reviewers observed the breadth of equipment and supplies used by inspection staff trained in public health risk evaluation. However, the reviewers suggested that training courses shall be developed to address risks from recreational swimming and spa areas on ships, and systems developed for the detection, assessment, and application of the recommended measures. In addition, as a new PoK travel center is underway, it was suggested that strategic workforce planning should be undertaken in anticipation of the expansion of the PoK to ensure adequate staff to implement and strengthen the IHR core capacities ( Table 2) . Based on reviewers' suggestions, the TCDC implemented inspection and control measures for recreational swimming and spa activities on ships into the annual training program for ship sanitation inspectors. In addition, the Clarify the procedure of security inspection of air postal parcels. The preliminary external assessment (August 2011) Ensure vertical consultation within competent authorities, as well as horizontal information sharing among competent authorities at PoE when faced by an immediate risk. A communication exercise might be necessary, especially for events with mass casualty or high profile event. As water and food services highly rely on outsourcing companies, it might be required to review documents regularly, and to conduct direct inspection by competent authorities for monitoring the sanitation. Event information should be circulated rapidly not only to public health sectors but also to the large number of service providers and outsourcing companies involved at the airport. The competent authority to be responsible for airport facilities will be expected to play a more intensive role as the control center, and it might be necessary to consider the overall appropriate 'surge capacity' of the TIA.
