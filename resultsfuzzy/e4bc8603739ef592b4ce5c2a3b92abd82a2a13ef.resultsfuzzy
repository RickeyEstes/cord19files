Preparation and characterization of GLA loaded nanoparticles GLA loaded NPs were prepared by sonication/ solvent evaporation method. Encapsulation efficiency, drug loading, size, polydispersity index and zeta potential of GLA loaded NPs are reported in Table1. According to Table 1 , NPs size was in the range of 175 to 212 nm and the prepared nanoparticles were highly uniform and monodispersed (Figures 1a and 1b) . By increasing the drug to polymer ratio from 1:1 to 1:4, size was increased from 184 to 212 nm. This result may be related to an increase in viscous forces of droplets which resists against droplets break down by sonication especially in higher polymer concentrations. These resisting forces stand against the shear forces in the oil phase and determine the final size and particle size distribution in nanoparticles (26). Furthermore, Table 1 shows that by increasing the amount of polymer, higher encapsulation efficiencies were achieved. Maximum encapsulation efficiency was attained when the amount of drug to polymer ratio was 1:4. As it is observed higher polymer concentration is related to a higher encapsulation efficiency which may be explained in two different ways. First, it can be proposed that when the polymer concentration is high, the polymer molecules may precipitate on the surface of the dispersed phase droplets. As a result drug molecules diffusion through the two phases boundary is restricted and a higher encapsulation efficiency is achieved (27). Alternatively, it may be proposed that a higher polymer concentration can increase the viscosity of the system and make a barrier toward the free diffusion of drug molecules through the boundary phase of polymeric droplets (28). Table 1 also shows the influence of the acetone content on the size of NPs. The ratio between continuous and dispersed phases may have an effect on the stability and size of nanoparticles. As shown in Table 1 by increasing the ratio of the oil phase, the size of nanoparticles is slightly decreased and their encapsulation efficiency and drug loading is slightly increased. It has been suggested that by increasing the ratio of aqueous phase, the external surface energy of oil droplets, will be dispersed in a higher volume and results in a lower droplet breakage and subsequently the particle size will be increased. It should be mentioned that GLA is poorly soluble in water and has a higher affinity for the oil phase in an oil in water emulsion which will lead to a higher entrapment efficiency and drug loading with increasing the oil phase ratio (9). Another factor which was evaluated for its effects on the size of nanoparticles was sonication time which was between 1 and 20 min. The results shown in Table 1 suggest that an increase in the sonication time would result in a reduction in the size of nanoparticles. When a higher sonication time (10 min) is utilized, the high energy results in a rapid dispersion of oil droplets with a smaller size and a monomodal profile of distribution. The emulsification step is one of the most vital steps in the nanoparticles formation process. Inappropriate phase dispersion will result in the formation of larger particles with a wider particle size distribution. The NPs size is dependent on the size of droplets which are formed during the emulsification process. As a result by reducing the size of emulsion droplets, smaller nanoparticles can be achieved. Nanoparticles stabilization phase is a very significant step in the process of emulsification. Protection of nanodroplets is usually achieved by surfactant molecules utilization. Surfactant molecules prevent the occurrence of coalescence in nanodroplets and produce nanoparticles with a smaller particle size. Herein, a 0.5% concentration of PVA was used to stabilize the formed nanoparticles and develop some sort of coverage between the phases interface in oil in water emulsion. Other than size, zeta potential is another major characteristic of nanoparticles which may have impacts on both nanoparticles stability and cellular adhesion. Zeta potential was also measured in PLGA NPs and as shown in Table  1 , the values of negative zeta potential on the nanoparticles were reduced as the polymer concentration decreased from 1:4 to 1:1 drug to polymer ratio. This reduced negative charge may be attributed to the higher amount of unentrapped drug molecules with lower polymer concentrations and their shielding effect on the carboxylic moieties of PLGA molecules on the particle surface (29). It has been shown that the extent of phagocytosis is increased with an increase in NPs zeta potential where the minimum phagocytosis is related to the instance in which zeta potential is approximately zero (30). On the other hand, due to the negative surface charge of endothelial cells and their repulsive forces toward the negatively charged NPs, the half life of these NPs may increase in blood systemic circulation keeping the NPs more available to the phagocytic cells (31). Scanning electron microscopy SEM micrograph of GLA loaded NPs showed that NPs are roughly spherical and have smooth surfaces (Figure 2 ). All formulations appeared to be monodispersed and homogenous irrespective of their compositions. The NPs size obtained by photon correlation spectroscopy were larger than those observed by SEM which may be related to hydrodynamic diameter of swollen and inflated polymeric NPs in water (32). Differential scanning calorimetry DSC was used to investigate the thermal behavior of formulations. Figure 3 shows that pure PLGA exhibits an endothermic peak at 60 °C which can be related to its relaxation peak following the glass transition phase. Due to the amorphous nature of PLGA, no melting point was observed in PLGA thermograms. The pure GLA demonstrated a sharp peak at 300 °C which can be related to its melting point. The DSC thermograms of the physical mixture of GLA and PLGA showed peaks which were the result of plain superposition of each of the two substances DSC thermograms. The enthalpy reduction for the physical mixture of drug and polymer can be explained by the presence of smaller amount of drug molecules in the mixture in comparison with pure drug. The DSC curve of GLA containing NPs did not show the endothermic peak of GLA which suggests that the drug is incorporated into the nanoparticles in a disordered and amorphous shape. Any severe alteration in the thermal behavior of either the polymer or the drug may be related to drug polymer interaction (33). In the current study no formation of any new peak and no shifting of any peak in the DSC thermogram was observed.
