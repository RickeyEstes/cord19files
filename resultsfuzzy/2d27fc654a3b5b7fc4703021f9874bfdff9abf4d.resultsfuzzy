An essential subsequent activity is the confirmation of all screening reactive results. It is critical that all screening reactivity is properly and fully investigated to determine the true infection status of the donor. Any screening program will generate reactive results. In the case of blood donation screening, to ensure as high a level of safety as possible, this will result in the discard of the donation, but the status of the donor must then be determined to decide if either the donor is truly infected and must be referred for clinical investigation and management, or, as is often the case with a low risk donor population, if the screening reactivity is nonspecific and the donor is not infected and may still be able to continue to donate. The confirmatory testing performed must therefore be able to distinguish between true infection and nonspecific reactivity. There are a number of reasons why confirmation is important; first, if a donor is truly infected then clinical intervention may be required for the donor and all contacts of the donor need to be protected and investigated, as appropriate. Second, if a donor is truly infected, it is important to understand the donor's-specific risk(s) and how the donor selection process failed to identify the donor as high risk and defer them. Thirdly, if the screen reactivity is proven to be nonspecific, it may be possible to reinstate the donor and recall for future donations. The unnecessary loss of donors due to nonspecific screening reactivity is not acceptable; donors are a valuable resource and must be managed effectively. In many cases nonspecific reactivity is transient and also may be assay specific. As most screen reactivity in low risk populations is nonspecific, there is clearly the potential to permanently, and unnecessarily, lose significant numbers of suitable donors if such donors are not managed correctly.
