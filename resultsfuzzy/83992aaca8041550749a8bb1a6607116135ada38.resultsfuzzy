Initially, the fluorinated methylene ketones 6 and 7 were prepared from the ketone 5 [10b] (Scheme 1). Deprotonation of ketone 5 with 1.05 equivalent of LiHMDS, followed by fluorination with 1.1 equivalent of N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSi), provides both the monofluoromethylene ketone 6 and the difluoromethylene ketone 7 in 63% and 6% yields, respectively. Compounds 6 and 7 were then tested as inhibitors of SARS 3CL pro using a continuous fluorometric assay in which enzymatic cleavage of an internally quenched fluorogenic peptide substrate, (Abz-SVTLQSG-Tyr(NO 2 )R) leads to enhanced fluorescence [10a,10b]. The monofluoro ketone 6 shows weak inhibition against 3CL pro (10% at 100 lM concentration, Table 1) , and no improved inhibition was observed after 2 h preincubation with the 3CL pro . However, the di-fluoro ketone 7 displays stronger inhibition against 3CL pro (38% at 100 lM concentration, Table 1 ). Similarly, preincubation of 7 with the 3CL pro for 2 h shows no improved inhibition. These results suggest that the fluorinated ketones 6, 7 are non-covalent and completely reversible inhibitors for SARS 3CL pro . As proposed, fluorination leads to the substantial improvement in the inhibitory activity against the 3CL pro . The di-fluoro ketone 7 appears to be a reasonable mimic of the corresponding pyridinyl ester 1 (91% inhibition at 100 lM), with only 2-to 3-fold less potent inhibition. As the pyridinyl ester 1 (IC 50 = 7.9 lM) is only a moderate inhibitor among the pyridinyl esters (2-4, IC 50 = 50-63 nM), it seemed that the difluoromethylene ketone mimics of the very potent esters (i.e. 2-4) could inhibit SARS 3CL pro very strongly in a non-covalent and reversible fashion. Based on this assumption, a series of methylene ketones and fluorinated methylene ketones were synthesized. Synthesis started from halogen-substituted phenyl or pyridinyl acetic acids, most of which are commercially available materials except the 5-chloropyridinyl acetic acid 8a (Scheme 2). Esterification of carboxylic acids 8a-c yields 9a-c in 88% to quantitative yields. Treatment of 9a-c with LiHMDS to generate the anions, followed by the addition of pre-activated CDI/acid solutions, provides the b-keto esters 10a-d in 72-96% yields. Hydrolytic decarboxylation of the b-keto esters 10a-d gives the corresponding ketones 11a-d in 59-85% yields. Fluorination of the ketones 11a-d with 1.1 equivalent of LiHMDS and NFSi affords the corresponding monofluoromethylene ketones 12a-d in 50-88% yields. Similarly, fluorination of the ketones 11a-d with 2.2 equivalent of LiHMDS and NFSi generates the corresponding difluoromethylene ketones 13a-d in 34-85% yields.  Dash represents <10% inhibition. Compound 5-chloronicotinate 9a is not commercially available and was prepared as described in Scheme 3. Esterification of the commercially available 5-aminonicotinic acid (14) affords methyl 5-aminonicotinate (15) in 88% yield. Then treating the free amine of 15 with sodium nitrite under acidic conditions, followed by the addition of copper (I) chloride and copper (II) chloride yields the methyl 5chloronicotinate (16) in 79% yield. Hydrolysis of 16 with potassium hydroxide, and then acidic workup generates the acid 17 in 84% yield. Activation of 17 with ethyl chloroformate, followed by lithium aluminum hydride reduction produces the corresponding alcohol, which is readily converted by thionyl chloride to the chloride 18 in 76% yield over 3 steps. Nucleophilic attack of 18 by potassium cyanide provides compound 19 in 56% yield. Hydrolysis of 19, followed by esterification gives the desired ester 9a in quantitative yield. Compounds 11a-d, 12a-d, 13a-d were tested as inhibitors of SARS 3CL pro using the continuous fluorometric assay described above. The testing results, which only examine the initial binding affinity, are listed in Table 1 . Surprisingly, most of the methylene ketones (11a-c) as well as their fluorinated methylene ketone analogues (12a-c, 13a-c) inhibit 3CL pro poorly. However, the methylene ketone 11d and its fluorinated methylene ketone analogues 12d, 13d are good inhibitors of 3CL pro with IC 50 values of 13-57 lM. Interestingly, introduction of a fluorine substituent to this group of inhibitors bearing the p-chlorophenyl ring (11d, 12d, 13d) decreases the inhibitory activity $2fold, which stands in contrast to results with inhibitors 11a-c, 12a-c, 13a-c that are lacking this ring. This suggests that the three-ringed inhibitors (11d, 12d, 13d) may have a different binding mode from the two-ringed inhibitors (11a-c, 12a-c, 13a-c). After 2 h preincubation of 25 lM methylene ketone (11d) or fluorinated methylene ketones (12d, 13d) with 3CL pro , no improved inhibitory activity is observed, indicating that these compounds act as noncovalent fully reversible inhibitors of SARS 3CL pro . The inhibition mechanism was also examined on a longer time scale using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) studies. After mixing 10 equivalent of inhibitor 11d, 12d or 13d with 1 equivalent of 3CL pro , and incubating the solution for 24 h, no mass change is observed in the major mass peak of 3CL pro . This further demonstrates that compounds 11a-13d utilize a non-covalent reversible mechanism of inhibition. These compounds represent a new class of SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors, and to our knowledge, are among the most potent non-covalent and reversible inhibitors of this enzyme. As furan moieties have some potential to be metabolized rapidly in mammalian cells, two additional ketone analogues 25 and 28 were prepared and examined. Synthesis of 25 started from commercially available ethyl 2-chloro-2-oxoacetate (20) , as shown in Scheme 4. Nucleophilic reaction of 20 with TMSCHN 2 provides the diazo compound 21 in 68% yield. Treating the diazo compound 21 with copper salt generates the carbene intermediate, which readily reacts with 4-chlorobenzonitrile through [3+2] cyclization to form the ester 22 with the desired oxazole moiety in 14% yield. Hydrolysis of 22 with lithium hydroxide produces the carboxylic acid 23 in 94% yield. Activation of the acid 23 with CDI, and addition of this to the pre-generated anion formed by deprotection of 9c with LiHMDS, yields the b-keto ester 24 in 23% yield. Hydrolytic decarboxylation of the b-keto ester 24 gives the desired ketone 25 in 58% yield. The ketone 28 was also prepared in a similar method as described in Scheme 5. Compounds 25 and 28 were tested against SARS 3CL pro . Compound 25 inhibits the proteinase with an IC 50 value of 75 lM, and compound 28 displays 35% inhi- bition at a concentration of 100 lM (Table 1 ). It is known that for non-covalent and reversible inhibitors, hydrogen bonds, ionic and van der Waal's interactions play crucial roles in binding affinity to the target enzyme [22] . For inhibitors 11d-13d, the oxygen atoms of their furan rings are suspected to have hydrogen bonds with the 3CL pro [10b,23] . In contrast, that position may be occupied by the oxygen atom of the oxazole ring of 25 and the carbon atom of the isoxazole ring of 28, both of which have lower electron density and may thus give weaker binding to the 3CL pro . To gain further insight into the inhibition mechanism, modeling studies (Fig. 2 ) of 3CL pro with inhibitors 11a-13d were conducted [10b]. Since the S2 and S4 pockets in the active site of 3CL pro are relatively large, the shorter two-ringed compounds (e.g. 11c) cannot occupy the maximal volume in these S sites in any docked conformations. However, due to their extended end-to-end length, the three-ringed compounds can occupy more of the binding surface from the S2/S4 to the S1 pocket. Therefore, the three aromatic ring compounds (11d, 12d, 13d) are more effective in blocking the binding of substrates into the active site, and thus exhibit better inhibition against 3CL pro than the two-ringed ones, as revealed in the enzymatic assay. Based on our previous modeling studies [10b,23], the three-ringed esters utilize a non-covalent and reversible mechanism of inhibition in a S4-S1 binding mode, by blocking entry of substrates into the active site of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . This is supported by a recently reported crystal structure of a three-ringed thioester with the 3CL pro [24] . Docking results suggest that these ketone analogues (11d, 12d, 13d) adopt binding conformations similar to that of the corresponding esters (e.g. 4). Each of these three compounds is oriented in an extended conformation from S4 to S1 pocket, with the oxygen atom of their furan ring forming a hydrogen bond with the main chain NH of Glu166, an interaction that was also predicted for the three-ringed esters. The pyridinyl moiety preferentially binds inside the S1 specificity pocket, which limits the possible spatial orientations of the substituents at the a-position of the central ketone group. In the 3CL pro :12dand 3CL pro :13d complexes, the fluorine substituents of the inhibitor point towards the main chain carbonyl oxygen of His164 (Fig. 2) . This pushes 12d and 13d slightly out towards the solvent. Thus, the van der Waals interactions between the fluorinated compounds and the active site residues of the enzyme are likely to be weaker than those for 11d.
