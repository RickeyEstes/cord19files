Chaperone assisted expression of soluble rGST-COE and rGST-S1D Based on the sequence information of the spike protein of PEDV CV777 strain, we constructed pG-COE and pG-S1D expression plasmids, producing rGST-COE (containing 138 amino acids spanning the region of 499-636 amino acids) [17] and rGST-S1D (containing 153 amino acids spanning the region of 637-789 amino acids) [13] , respectively. However, unlike the previous reports [13, 17] , our initial attempts to produce rGST-COE and rGST-COE using a pGEX 6p-1 vector system with various induction conditions resulted in IBs (data not shown). Since, both of the COE and S1D regions contain 4 cysteine residues in the protein sequence, we also performed expression of these clones in E.coli Rosetta-gami™2 (DE3) (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) strain known to enhance disulfide bond formation in the cytoplasm, although the yield of soluble proteins was negligible (data not shown). Previously, chaperone co-expression system has been reported to improve the solubility of various aggregationprone recombinant proteins, such as human interferongamma, mouse endostatin, human ORP150 and human lysozyme [27, 36] . Therefore, we decided to test the effect of chaperone systems, such as trigger factor (TF), GroEL-ES, DnaKJE/GroEL-ES and GroEL-ES/TF, on the production of soluble rGST-COE and rGST-S1D. The pG-COE and pG-S1D expression plasmids were transformed in to the E.coli BL21, BL21/pTF16, BL21/pGro7, BL21/pG-KJE8 and BL21/pG-Tf2 chaperone competent cells. As shown in Fig. 1 , we found that co-expression of TF with recombinant proteins at 15°C was most useful in soluble production of rGST-COE and rGST-S1D compared to other chaperone combinations (Fig. 1) . Majority of the recombinant proteins were presented in insoluble fraction when expressed alone, while co-expression of recombinant proteins with TF resulted in up to 84 % soluble fraction for the rGST-COE, and 41 % for the rGST-S1D compared to 19~30 % of other chaperone systems. Total amount of recombinant proteins expressed were decreased to 40~50 % value of no chaperone induction. Interestingly, TF system is a cold shock chaperone, while the GroEL-ES and the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE systems belong to the heat shock chaperones and the ratios of chaperone combinations are critical in the folding or refolding process [30, 37] . In this study as we used commercial system, the ratios of chaperones or other conditions were not optimized for the PEDV antigen expression. Nonetheless, TF system is simple and most effective among the tested conditions for the soluble expression of PEDV antigens and do not require co-chaperones or ATP as compared to the GroEL-ES and the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE systems. Furthermore, TF, a ribosome associated chaperone, is the first chaperone that interacts with nascent polypeptide chains and assists co-translational protein folding [38] . Thus, TF may be essential for the correct folding of rGST-COE and rGST-S1D during initial de novo folding steps [27, 39] . It was reported that formation of GroEL/TF complex can further enhance binding affinity of GroEL to unfolded protein and facilitate protein folding or denaturation. However, co-expression of GroES-GroEL/TF system (E.coli BL21/pG-Tf2) was not successful in our case due to the growth inhibition observed upon chaperone induction (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 , SDS-PAGE revealed the expression of TF (56 kDa) induced by L-arabinose and the expression of rGST-COE (Fig. 2a) and rGST-S1D (Fig. 2b ) induced by IPTG. Recombinant proteins or chaperone TF was not produced without IPTG or L-arabinose induction, respectively. Insoluble recombinant proteins were produced with IPTG in the absence of L-arabinose. Soluble recombinant proteins were produced only in the presence of TF. As a result, it was confirmed that coexpression of TF highly improved the solubility of rGST-COE and rGST-S1D.
