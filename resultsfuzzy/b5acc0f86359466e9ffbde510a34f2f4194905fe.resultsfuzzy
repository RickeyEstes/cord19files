Samples were considered to be positive for a specific respiratory pathogen if results from conventional testing were positive and matched the TAC results. Samples were considered to be negative if the conventional testing and TAC testing both yielded negative results. In cases where the conventional testing result and the TAC result were discordant, the result of the confirmatory testing was regarded as the final result.
