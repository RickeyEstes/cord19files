† All were male injecting drug users (IDUs). Three were "muscle poppers". † Ages ranged from 25 to 33 years (medianZ26 years). † Visual disturbance (blurred or double vision) was an early feature in all presentations followed by dysarthria, dysphagia and progressive weakness. † One patient complained of a "heavy head" and another was "unable to hold their head up". † Respiratory arrest occurred in two patients (subsequent to their consideration as cases of botulism). † Three patients required mechanical ventilation and tracheostomies. † Of the three patients admitted to intensive care, the duration of mechanical ventilation ranged from 19 to 52 days (median Z45 days). † All four patients had soft tissue abscesses. Clostridium botulinum (type A) organisms were identified in two patients from excised abscess material by FSML. † Mouse bioassay performed at FSML identified botulinum toxin (Type A) in serum in three cases. † Although all patients waived botulinum anti-toxin, the interval between admission and administration of antitoxin ranged from 1 to 3 days. CONCLUSIONS: † Wound botulism should be considered in any IDU presenting with neurological symptoms or signs. † Early review by an anaesthetist is advisable and patients with suspected wound botulism who have not yet developed respiratory failure should initially be closely monitored in a high dependency unit of intensive care unit environment. † Outcome is worse when there is delay in administering botulinum antitoxin with longer requirements for mechanical ventilation and intensive care admission. Of these suspected cases, 25 were in England and 6 were confirmed, 3 from South Yorkshire and 3 from London. Wound botulism is characterised by a symmetric, afebrile, descending, flaccid paralysis. Common early symptoms include blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty in swallowing, breathlessness and muscle weakness. However, patients may present with respiratory failure due to rapid paralysis of respiratory muscles. There is no loss of sensation or of consciousness, which can lead to a 'locked in syndrome' if unrecognised. Management includes the administration of specific anti-toxin, wound debridement, antibiotic therapy and intensive respiratory support. Prognosis is good if the diagnosis is recognised and treatment commenced early, untreated the mortality is at least 25% 3 .
