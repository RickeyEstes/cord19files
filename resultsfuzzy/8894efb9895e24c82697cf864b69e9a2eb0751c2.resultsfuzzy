To determine if the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A was also necessary for the retention of DPAP A in the Golgi, a series of in-frame deletion mutations in the cytoplasmic domain were generated using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (see Materials and Methods). Deletion variants that lacked (Fig. 9) , although both proteins also showed a small amount of ER staining (Table I). Immunoblotting analysis of crude extracts prepared from cells expressing A22-AA-B showed a broadly migrating species on SDS-PAGE similar to AA-B and A-BB (data not shown; Fig. 6 B) , suggesting that the A22-AA-B protein transits the Golgi apparatus before its transport to the vacuole. Similar to the deletions in the cytoplasmic domain of Figure 8 . Immunolocalization of AA-B and A-BB. JHRY'20-1A (ste13A dap2A) cells containing plasmids expressing either AA-B (pCJR64, A-C) or A-BB (pCJR67, D-F) were fixed, spheroplasted, and stained with DPAP A antibody and Vat2p mAb. The cells were viewed by Nomarski optics (A and C) and by epifluorescence using filter sets specific for fluorescein (B and E) and rhodamine (C and F) fluorescence. DPAP B, this deletion delays exit of the fusion proteins from the ER; however, upon exit from the ER, the enzymatically active A22-AAA and A22-AA-B fusion proteins were transported to the vacuole. Thus, the cytoplasmic domain is both necessary and sufficient for the retention of DPAP A in the Golgi apparatus, and the signal for the retention of DPAP A maps to a 22-amino acid segment within the ll8-residue cytoplasmic domain.
