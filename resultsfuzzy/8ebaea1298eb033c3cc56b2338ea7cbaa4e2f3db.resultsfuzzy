Since the efficacy of G12 largely depends on its concentration in vivo , we injected two additional doses of G12 into the HDI-HBV mice at 40 and 65 days after the initial antibody infusion ( Fig. 2 a) . As expected, the G12 injection quickly reduced HBsAg to undetectable levels. However, the rebound time of HBsAg was shortened to ten days after the third G12 injection (data not shown), probably owing to the faster G12 clearance by MAHA. Interestingly, after prolonged follow-up, the mice that received three injections of G12 showed gradual clearance of HBsAg. Five out of six mice in the G12 group cleared HBsAg by four months after the first injection ( Fig. 2 b) . By eight months after the first injection, HB-sAg was cleared in all of the G12-treated mice, while more than half of the mice in the control and HBIG groups remained HB-sAg positive ( Fig. 2 c) . Three of six mice in the G12-treated group produced HBsAb, while only one mouse produced HBsAb in the HBIG group and no mouse produced HBsAb in the m336-treated group ( Fig. 2 d) . These data suggest that the long-lasting blockage of HBsAg by G12 may have evoked the host's anti-HBsAg humoral response.
