As mentioned in the Introduction above, the UpE, ORF1a, N2, and N3 assays can be used for screening because of their high sensitivity. [6] [7] [8] [9] Among these, only the primer and probe designs of the ORF1a assay showed 100% conservation of all sequence data available today (Table 1) . Minor mismatches were found for the UpE assay (one nucleotide substitution in two sequences) and N2 assay (one nucleotide substitution in one sequence), and significant mismatches were found for the N3 assay. The primer/probe regions were found to be well conserved, except for the N3 assay. In addition, mismatches were not found in the 3 0 end region of primers for the UpE and N2 assays ( Table 1 ). The sensitivity of the assays may not be greatly affected. No mismatches were found for the ORF1b assay. With regard to the sequencing assays, no sequence data that matched the sequence of the reverse primer for the RdRpSeq assay was found. However, a single common mismatch in all sequence data was found. When the mismatched nucleotide was corrected, the RdRpSeq assay matched all the sequence data perfectly ('corrected reverse primer', Table 1 ). In addition, viral sequences of the reverse primer region for the NSeq assay were not highly conserved; the sequence matched only 49% of strains. Based on these results, the use of a modified reverse primer for the assay is suggested, in order to reduce the possibility of a mismatch ('modified reverse primer', Table 1 ). Several mismatches among viral sequences in the primer/probe regions for molecular diagnosis were identified in this study. Such mismatches could lead to a lower sensitivity of the assay, thereby leading to false-negative diagnosis. The mismatched sequence data could have been generated by errors in PCR or sequencing during viral nucleotide sequence analysis because of the incorporation of the wrong nucleotide. 10 However, it is more likely that the RNA virus has evolved and that this has accidentally resulted in the induction of mutation/s in the region targeted by the primer/probe for RT-PCR, only 2 years after the establishment of the protocols. Fortunately, no or few mismatches were found for most of the MERS-CoV screening assays. Nevertheless, protocols for the molecular diagnosis of viral infections should be reviewed regularly after they are established, particularly for viruses that pose a great threat to public health such as MERS-CoV.
