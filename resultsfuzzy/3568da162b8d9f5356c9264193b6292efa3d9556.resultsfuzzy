The relative abundance of nidovirus mRNAs likely serves to regulate the relative concentration of their respective translation products during infection. It was therefore important to determine whether viral protein levels indeed mirrored the specific changes in viral mRNA levels caused by mutations in nsp1. To this end, we examined the intracellular accumulation of the EAV replicase subunit nsp3, and the structural proteins M and N, in cell lysates harvested 11 h after transfection (Fig. 6A) . When compared to the wt control, nsp3 was more abundant in cells transfected with the A1 and A4 mutants, in line with the increased genome levels 2)RNA] species produced in EAV-infected cells. The anti-leader sequence is depicted in light green. The in vitro-transcribed plus-strand probes used for detection of (2)RNA1 (pRNA1), (2)RNA6 (pRNA6) and (2) RNA7 (pRNA7) are shown. pRNA6 and pRNA7 target the leader-body junction sequences of (2)RNA6 and (2)RNA7, respectively. Note that hybridization with pRNA1 results in the protection of a single fragment, while the probes for (2)RNAs 6 and 7 each protect three fragments -one derived from the full-length sg minus strand, and two fragments derived in part from partial hybridization of these probes to larger viral (2)RNAs in which the target sequences are noncontiguous (exemplified for pRNA6). For simplicity, non-EAV sequences present near the termini of the three probes were omitted from the scheme. (B) Viral (2)RNA accumulation was analyzed at 11 h post-transfection for the ZCH, A1 and A4 mutants, and a wt control. Protected fragments were resolved on denaturing 5% polyacrylamide/8M urea gels and visualized by phosphorimaging. The constructs analyzed are labeled above the lanes (M, mock-transfected cells; (2) , no-RNase control that shows a band corresponding to 0.2 fmol of the full-length probe). Sizes (nt) of RNA markers have been indicated on the left. The single 327-nt protected fragment resulting from hybridization with the positive-sense probe for RNA1(2) is indicated. The probes for subgenome-length minus strands protected fragments derived from the full-length (2)RNA6 and (2)RNA7 (327 nt and 319 nt, respectively; denoted with LB), as well as from the (2)RNA6 and (2)RNA7 body sequences (188 nt and 180 nt, respectively; denoted with B) and the anti-leader sequence (139 nt; denoted with L). The presence of two bands in the size range of the anti-leader fragment has been described previously [55] . (C) The relative levels of minus-strand accumulation were quantified by phosphorimaging. For (2)RNAs 6 and 7, only the bands resulting from protection of full-length sg minus strands (denoted with LB in panel [B] ) were quantified. The values correspond to the means from three independent transfections that were normalized to the level of accumulation of each minus-strand RNA in the wt control, which was set at 1. Intracellular RNA from the same transfection samples for which plusstrand accumulation was quantified (Fig. 4B ) was used. Genomic minus-strand RNA levels are represented as dark blue bars. Error bars denote standard deviation. (D) The ratio of plus-strand to minus-strand accumulation for RNAs 1, 6 and 7 was calculated using the mean relative values obtained in Fig. 4B and Fig. 5C . doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000772.g005 observed for these mutants at the same time point (Fig. 4) . The intracellular levels of the M and N proteins were also in general agreement with the abundance of their corresponding mRNA templates (RNA6 and RNA7, respectively). Interestingly, even the modest reduction in RNA7 levels detected for the A1 mutant (,30%, Fig. 4B ) was reflected in a decrease in N protein levels (Fig. 6A) . The close correlation between mRNA and corresponding protein levels argues against the possibility that the engineered nsp1 mutations might have caused a defect in viral mRNA translation. Overall, these data establish that even modest changes in viral mRNA accumulation are directly translated into altered viral protein levels during EAV infection.
