Studies using mice defective in ISGs revealed their implication in antiviral defense (Table 2 ). Compared to the parental mice, PKR´/´mice are more susceptible to VSV infection and die from acute infection of the respiratory tract [47] . In addition, IFNα/β are unable to rescue PKR´/´mice from VSV infection [34] . However, the overexpression of human PKR in culture cells does not alter VSV replication [98] . The generation of triply deficient (TD) PKR, Mx1 and RNase L mice showed that IFN still inhibited VSV replication in their derived cell lines revealing the existence of other pathways [33] . Ablation of the PML gene by homologous recombination has shown that mice are viable and are able to develop normally. However, the loss of PML alters viral replication. Analysis of PML´/ḿ ice when compared to parental mice revealed that they were more susceptible to VSV infections [43] . Additionally, fibroblasts derived from PML knockout mice, PML´/´MEFs, exhibited enhanced VSV and RABV multiplication [42, 48] . P53 was discovered in 1980, and its connection to the IFN pathway was revealed over 20 years later by Taniguchi and colleagues who showed that Type I IFN directly induced p53 expression via an active ISRE motif in its promoter [36] . They also reported in the same study that p53´/´mice were more susceptible to VSV compared to parental mice and that the VSV yield was more than 30-fold higher in p53´/´MEFs than in wild-type. Using Ifit2 (ISG54) knockout mice, Fensterl et al. showed that they were more vulnerable to neuropathogenesis caused by intranasal VSV infection compared to parental or Ifit1´/´mice [38] . Interestingly, resistance to VSV conferred by Ifit2 was restricted to neurons. Tetherin´/´mice were generated and challenged with VSV [99] . Both Tetherin´/´and parental mice have similar tissue viral burdens after systemic infection with VSV. Intriguingly, only at short times post-infection did local intranasal infection of VSV result in lower viral titers in the lungs of Tetherin´/´mice compared to parental mice. Determination of IFN titers in the lung tissue of VSV-infected mice revealed that Tetherin´/´mice also had lower levels of IFNα compared with their parental counterparts [99] . This suggests that Tetherin may play a role in IFNα production. Viruses 2015, 7 3687
