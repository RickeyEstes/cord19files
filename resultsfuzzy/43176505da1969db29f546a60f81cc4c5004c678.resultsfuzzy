Bivariate screening identified 12 variables associated at P < 0.2 with liquid faeces in this age group (Table 2) . Among the enteropathogens, only K99 was positively associated with liquid faeces in this age group (OR = 4.6; 95% CI, 1.2-16.1; P = 0.02) (Salmonella was found in only three specimens and BCV was not included in multivariable modelling due to P > 0.2 in bivariate screening). An ad hoc LogReg model which included only the explanatory variables of presence/absence of the enteropathogens (and the random effect of farm) did not change the significance of these results. In the final model, the odds of liquid faeces was lower where only females (OR = 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9; P = 0.04), or females and males (OR = 0.2; 95% CI, 0.01-0.8; P = 0.02) were employed as calves caretakers, compared with farms employing only males (Table 3) . Cross-validation without imputation did not change the direction and significance of these results and caterpillar plots did not indicate significant variation between the effects of the farms. No abnormal ORs and CIs were revealed in the final model (Table 3) . Finally, no variables associated with increased odds of shedding of the enteropathogens were identified in this age group. Bivariate screening identified 15 variables associated at P < 0.2 with liquid faeces in this age group (Table 2) . Nine variables remained significant in the final model (Table 3 ). In particular, the presence of C. parvum (OR = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3-5.6; P = 0.02) and BRV (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3-5.9; P = 0.01) was independently associated with increased odds of liquid faeces. Conversely, BCV and Salmonella were not significant (Salmonella was found in four specimens and BCV was not included in multivariable modelling due to P > 0.2 in bivariate screening). BCV was found in a lower number of calves than BRV and C. parvum (Table 1) . Thus, in order to prevent Type II error, the strength of association between the presence of BCV and liquid faeces was assessed as in the younger calves using a parsimonious model that includedonly variables BCV, BRV, and C. parvum (and random effect of farm),with similar results: whereas BRV and C. parvum retained their significance, BCV was not significant (not shown). The results of the preliminary Ï‡-square test indicated that BCV and BRV were correlated, thus each agent was also fitted separately in this model, with consistent results (not shown). The effect of co-infection was analysed by removing the variables presence/ absence of C. parvum, BRV, BCV and Salmonella from the final model and fitting a new variable of values: 1, presence of any monoinfection; 2, presence of any co-infection; 3, absence of infection (and random effect of farm). In this model, the odds of liquid faeces was significantly greater in co-infection compared with the other categories (not shown) (specific co-infection combinations were not assessed due to the large number of permutations needed). Housing calves in open barns where animals were exposed to winter weather significantly increased the odds of liquid faeces compared with closed barns (OR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-12.2; P = 0.03). Administering colostrum within the first 2 h of a calf's life decreased the odds of liquid faeces compared with later administration (OR = 0.4, 95% CI, 0.02-0.8; P = 0.02). Conversely, feeding stored (OR = 4.8; 95% CI, 1.1-12; P = 0.04), or mixed (OR = 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3-8.8; P = 0.03) colostrum increased these odds compared with first-milked colostrum. Interestingly, feeding waste milk (mostly defined by farmers as milk from cows treated with antibiotics and/or mastitic milk) (OR = 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1-0.8; P = 0.01), and female calves (OR = 0.2; 95% CI, 0.07-0.7; P < 0.01) were associated with lower odds of liquid faeces. The odds of liquid faeces were also lower on farms using straw bedding compared with sawdust (OR = 0.2; 95% CI, 0.03-0.9; P = 0.03). Finally, vaccinating cows against calf enteropathogens using combined BRV, BCV and Table 2 Variables with P < 0.2 in bivariate screening analysis, with farm identifier modelled as random effect.
