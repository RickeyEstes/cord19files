SiRNA technology is a powerful tool for studying gene function; however, due to the potential for off-target silencing effects (Birmingham et al., 2006; Jackson et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2005; Qiu et al., 2005; Scacheri et al., 2004) , we validated our results by treating Huh7 or HeLa cells with two different proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and PS1, both of which are potent, cell-permeable, reversible inhibitors of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20S proteasome (Borissenko and Groll, 2007) . The cells were treated with MG132 or PS1, infected with WNV hFLuc VRP and then assayed for FLuc activity, WNV antigen accumulation (ELISA) and cell viability. Cell viability/cell number was measured by two methods: the MTT assay and an assay for cellexpressed RLuc activity. To simplify presentation of the results only the MTT values are shown, although RLuc activity correlated well with the MTT values in all cases. HeLa cells pre-treated with as little as 0.3 μM of MG132 showed a marked reduction in both WNV-driven FLuc activity and WNV ELISA antigen expression compared to mock-or DMSO-treated cells ( Fig.  2A) . Additionally, treatment with as little as 0.08 μM of PS1 ( Fig. 2B ) resulted in a greater than 70% inhibition in WNV activity compared to the DMSO vehicle treatment. Although the inhibitors appeared to be less effective at inhibiting WNV VRP infection/genome amplification in Huh7 cells compared to HeLa cells, treatment with both MG132 and PS1 resulted in substantially lower FLuc activity and WNV ELISA antigen expression compared to mock or DMSO treatment. Treatment with MG132, which was more effective than PS1 in these cells, led to a greater than 80% reduction in WNV activity with as little as 1.25 μM ( Fig. 2C ) while pre-treatment with PS1 at this same concentration resulted in an approximate 60% reduction in WNV activity (Fig. 2D) . Consistent with the inability of PSMA-specific siRNAs to impair VEEV VRP-driven FLuc activity, MG132-or PS1-treated Huh7 cells demonstrated little or no reduction in VEEV VRP-driven FLuc activity compared to mock-treated cells (data not shown). Throughout these experiments, only the highest concentration (20 μM) of MG132 and PS1 in either Huh7 or HeLa cells resulted in any major changes in cellular characteristics or a reduction in cell viability, measured by either MTT assay (Figs. 2A-D) or RLuc activity (results not shown). To monitor WNV antigen expression by another method and to help ensure the specificity and sensitivity of the ELISA assay, PS1-or MG132-treated HeLa cells were infected with WNV hFLuc VRPs and then the cell monolayers were harvested and assayed for NS3 expression by Western blot analysis. Consistent with the Fig. 2 studies, treatment of HeLa cells with PS1 resulted in a reduction in WNV protein expression at the lowest drug doses tested (Fig. 3A) . Additionally, treatment with MG132 resulted in a reduction in WNV protein expression compared to mock-or DMSO-treated cells, although, consistent with our FLuc and ELISA detection methods (see Fig. 2 ) the MG132-mediated effect on NS3 expression was less than that observed with PS1 treatment (Fig. 3B) . The NS3 antibody consistently recognized two bands. The lower band corresponds to the predicted molecular weight of NS3, approximately 70kd, while the top band may represent uncleaved NS2A-NS3 or NS3-NS4A. Levels of β-actin, which served as a loading control, were similar in all treatment groups with the exception of 20 μM MG132, where a (Panel A) Non-targeting, negative control (NEG) siRNA, WNV-specific, FLuc-specific, PSMA1-specific or PSMA2-specific siRNAs were transfected into Huh7 cells, incubated for 72 h and then infected with VEEV FLuc VRP or WNV hFLuc VRP for an additional 16 or 24 h, respectively. Cell monolayers were then assayed for FLuc activity (WNV or VEEV replication levels) and RLuc activity (cell number). Values are shown as % FLuc normalized to % RLuc compared to mock-transfected cells. Error bars represent standard deviations from the mean between three independent experiments and an asterisk represents statistic significance compared to NEG siRNA transfection (p b 0.05). (Panel B) Monolayers of siRNA-transfected Huh7 cells were harvested and assayed, by Western blot, for levels of PSMA1, PSMA2, WNV NS3 and β-actin (loading control). reduction in β-actin was observed, consistent with the cytotoxicity observed with this dose. IFA performed on proteasome inhibitortreated HeLa cells was consistent with the Western blot analysis (Fig. 4) . PS1 and MG132 treatment in HeLa cells reduced the detectable levels of both NS1 (Fig. 4A ) and NS3 (Fig. 4B ), although PS1 appeared to be more effective than MG132, consistent with our previous studies. Interestingly, both PS1 and MG132 appeared to be more effective at blocking NS1 protein accumulation than NS3, although the significance of this is not known (Fig. 4) . IFA performed on proteasome inhibitor-treated Huh7 cells showed a similar reduction in both NS1 and NS3 levels (results not shown). DAPI and phalloidin counterstains indicated that inhibitor-treated cells did not have any nuclear abnormalities or any major defects in their overall cellular architecture, arguing against a non-specific effect of the inhibitor on WNV genome amplification. Since both MG132 and PS1 are reversible inhibitors of the proteasome, it was possible to determine whether removing inhibitor treatment from cells would return WNV infection/genome amplification to levels observed in mock-treated cells. This type of experiment helps to ensure that the inhibitor treatment did not result in any permanent damage to other cellular processes which might be responsible for the inhibitor-induced inhibition of WNV VRP infection or genome amplification. To this end, Huh7 and HeLa cells were pretreated with MG132 or PS1 for approximately 2 h, after which the drugs were removed. The cells were then infected with WNV hFLuc VRPs following a 2 h 'recovery' period. Consistent with Fig. 2, Huh7 (Fig. 5A) and HeLa (Fig. 5B ) cells that were incubated with MG132 or PS1 demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in WNV-dependent FLuc activity and WNV ELISA antigen accumulation. However, WNV hFLuc VRP infection/replication in both Huh7 (Fig. 5A) and HeLa (Fig. 5B ) cells in which the MG132 and PS1 treatments were washed off was nearly identical to mock-or DMSO-treated cells for all doses of the inhibitors. These data suggest that treatment with the inhibitors did not have an indirect effect on the cell's ability to support WNV VRP genome amplification. Although WNV VRPs mimic WNV infection, it was important to examine the effect of proteasome inhibitor treatment on 'live' WNV infection, as well. Since proteasome inhibitor treatment had no effect on the ability of WNV hFLuc VRPs to infect cells, monolayers of HeLa cells were infected with WNV for 1 h prior to MG132 or PS1 treatment and assayed for WNV accumulation in the supernatant fluid 24 h later. Titrations performed on supernatants harvested from the treated cells indicated that proteasome inhibitor treatment dramatically reduced the production of infectious WNV particles (Fig. 7) . MG132 treatment of HeLa cells, as observed in WNV VRP experiments, was slightly less effective at impairing WNV production compared to PS1 treatment; however, the treated cells still demonstrated a near 80% reduction in secreted infectious particles compared to mock-treated cells with as little as 0.16 μM (Fig. 7) . PS1, on the other hand, demonstrated inhibition of WNV particle release similar to MG132 at a concentration of only 0.032 μM (Fig. 7) . The inhibition of WNV release was consistent with the inhibition of WNV VRP-induced FLuc activity and WNV antigen accumulation. These data indicate that inhibiting proteasome activity in these cell lines severely impairs the WNV genome amplification, suggesting that the proteasome is an important cellular co-factor during WNV replication.
