Data analysis and results reporting was performed in an automated fashion using on-board computer on the Ibis PLEX-ID system. For this assay, a customized reporting rule set was designed that allowed rapid and accurate detection of the biothreat targets. The biothreat assay report has 21 primer groups or threat clusters as shown in Figure S2 . These groups consist of primer pairs used to identify the target biothreat organisms. Each of the threat clusters is treated independently and the results are reported for each cluster separately. Thus, the presence or absence of each of the target biothreat clusters is directly reported. Mixed detections of two or more threats or a threat with an unrelated near neighbor in another group are also reported. Further, two additional metrics (Q-score and level) are provided in the report to assess the quality of the reported detection. The Q-Score is a rating between 0 (low) and 1 (high) of the confidence in the identification of the organism. The Q-Score is based on a number of different parameters such as, the multi-primer joint log likelihood ratio, which is an indicator of how well the hypothesized organisms as a group represent the observed data; the multiprimer single log likelihood ratio, which is an indicator of how significant the contribution of a single organism is to the solution; the fraction of missed detections, which represents the percentage of primers for a detected organism that should have produced known base count compositions, but did not; and, finally, the fraction of no data, which indicates the percentage of primers for a detected organism for which no known data exists within the PLEX-ID system. For the biothreat assay described here, a Qscore $0.85 is considered a reportable result. The level is an indication of the amount of the amplicon present in the sample reported as genome equivalents/well. This is calculated with reference to the internal calibrant as described previously [4] . The normal range for reporting these levels is between 0.16 and 106 the levels of internal controls in the assay, which in the case of the PLEX-ID Biothreat assay represents a working range of ,10 GE/ well to 1000 GE/well. In addition to the summary style report shown in Figure S2 , the system is capable of reporting organism/strain level matches based on the genomic sequence data in the PLEX-ID database ( Figure S3 ). This is provided as a research utility tool in a separate analysis workstation. Additional details for each of the matches, including the detected base compositions and levels, are available using this report. Figure S1 Biothreat assay plate layout. Left panel: Sample wells and target biothreat cluster for each primer pair are indicated. Each well contains two or three multiplexed primer pairs. Letters A through H represent 8 rows of a 96-well plate, whereas numbers 1 through 12 represent the columns. Each sample is analyzed in 16 PCR reaction wells and six samples can be tested per PCR plate. Details of the primer pairs are given in Table 1 . Right panel: The 96-well PCR plate layout. Each PCR well includes a synthetic nucleic acid template that serves as a calibrant. In multiplexed wells, this calibrant provides an amplicon similar to the amplicon expected for the organism shown in red. (DOCX) Figure S2 Example of PLEX-ID summary report. Each biothreat cluster is listed separately. Detection of an organism within a cluster is listed at the species level. If no organism within the cluster is detected, the cluster is marked as ''Not Detected''.
