Disease severity and anti-viral efficacy parameters For the following results, the scenarios with values of R 0 from 2.5 to 4.0, and the most viable strategies of 4 to 8 weeks of prophylaxis should be focused on, because of their substantial impact on the outcome. Figures A2 to A4 show the results of one-way sensitivity analyses with different combinations of R 0 and management strategies. Regardless of the values of R 0 , for a given strategy, the outcomes are most sensitive to the same parameters. For the strategy of no action, "days of medical leave without treatment" and "symptomatic proportion in infected persons without prophylaxis" had a substantial effect on the outcomes. "Days of medical leave without treatment" had 15% to 49% variation from the baseline outcome depending on the R 0 ; while "symptomatic proportion in infected persons without prophylaxis" had 19% to 25% variation. The outcomes were insensitive to hospitalization, case-fatality and the length of hospitalization in symptomatic infections. The treatment only strategies were sensitive to the "reduction in medical leave with oseltamivir treatment", in addition to "days of medical leave without treatment" and "symptomatic proportion in infected persons without prophylaxis". "Days of medical leave without treatment" had 20% to 96% variation from the baseline outcome depending on the R 0 ; "reduction in medical leave with treatment" had 22% to 60% variation; and "symptomatic proportion in infected persons without prophylaxis" had 19% to 25% variation. The outcomes were insensitive to the other input parameters. Prophylaxis strategies were also sensitive to the efficacy of anti-virals when used as prophylaxis, such as "oseltamivir efficacy in preventing infection in exposed persons", "oseltamivir efficacy in preventing disease in infected persons", "oseltamivir efficacy in preventing transmission of infection by infected persons"; in addition to the factors for treatment only. "Oseltamivir efficacy in preventing disease in infected persons" had 21% to 87% variation from the baseline outcome depending on the R 0 ; "oseltamivir efficacy in preventing infection in exposed persons" had 5% to 25% variation; "oseltamivir efficacy in preventing transmission of infection by infected persons" had 5% to 8% variation; "days of medical leave without treatment" had 25% to 75% variation; "reduction in medical leave with treatment" had 23% to 61% variation; and "symptomatic proportion in infected persons without prophylaxis" had 19% to 25% variation. The outcomes were insensitive to the other input parameters. Table A4 gives the multi-way sensitivity analysis using Monte-Carlo simulation (1,000 iterations) for disease severity and anti-viral efficacy parameters. For R 0 ≥2. 5, 8 This material, provided by the authors as a supplement to "Effectiveness of neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing staff absenteeism during pandemic influenza" (2007 Mar), is not part of Emerging Infectious Diseases contents. weeks of prophylaxis provided results that were sufficiently close to providing prophylaxis throughout the entire pandemic. For lower R 0 (≤2), prophylaxis for 6 to 8 weeks provided better outcomes compared to no action but not necessarily to treatment only. Outcomes for no action and treatment only were subject to a greater spread of uncertainty than those with adequate prophylaxis. For the base-case scenario (R 0 =2.5, Figure 3 , main manuscript), 6 weeks of prophylaxis had a marginal advantage over treatment only, while 8 weeks or more had a clear advantage over treatment. Other parameters pertaining to transmission dynamics Tables A5 and A6 show that the transmission dynamics parameters affect both the intensity of transmission within the HCW population, as well as the timing of the HCW epidemic. From a baseline of no patient-to-HCW transmission, even a small increment of patient-to-HCW transmission had the potential to increase peak absenteeism in HCWs (Table A5) ; the effect, however, saturated at higher values of H/P. With regards to epidemic timing, when patient-to-HCW transmission was minimized (H/P = 0), the HCW epidemic peaked at the same time as the peak in the general population. Increasing the H/P ratio shifted the HCW epidemic forward, such that it precedes that in the general population. At extreme values of H/P, the HCW epidemic peaked before the start of HCW prophylaxis. This occurred at about H/P = 2.08 for base case parameters. Therefore, for the subsequent analyses, we used values for H/P up to 2. As shown in Table A6 , changing the extent of transmission attributable to HCW-to-HCW contact had minimal effect on both the peak absenteeism and the timing of the HCW epidemic. Figures A5 to A10 show the combined effect of varying both patient-to-HCW and HCW-to-HCW transmission parameters simultaneously in two-way sensitivity analyses. For all relevant combinations of patient-to-HCW and HCW-to-HCW transmission shown with R 0 =2.5, 6 weeks of prophylaxis was sufficient to be at least marginally superior to treatment only, while 8 weeks of prophylaxis was clearly superior to the treatment only strategy. For pandemics of shorter durations (either in the entire population with higher R 0 ; or within the HCW population with an increased H/P ratio), shorter durations of prophylaxis are superior to treatment only -the reduction of peak absenteeism for 4 weeks of prophylaxis were as effective as 8 weeks prophylaxis. For pandemics of longer durations (lower R 0 or decreased H/P ratio), prophylaxis is inferior to treatment only. At R 0 of 1.5 and at lower H/P, even 8 weeks of prophylaxis is insufficient. However, for these longer duration pandemics, overall peak absenteeism is already low. Latent and infectious periods Figure 4 in the main manuscript shows the peak absenteeism with different treatment and prophylaxis strategies varying rates of growth (ζ), latent periods (α), and infectious durations (γ). The centre set of figures in A12 with α = 2 and γ = 4.1 was with our base case parameters. At low growth rates, although situations of inadequate prophylaxis are more likely, peak absenteeism is low (<10%) regardless of the This material, provided by the authors as a supplement to "Effectiveness of neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing staff absenteeism during pandemic influenza" (2007 Mar), is not part of Emerging Infectious Diseases contents. strategy chosen, and is relatively insensitive to the choice of prophylaxis duration. At higher growth rates where peak absenteeism is >10%, 6 weeks of prophylaxis is equal or superior to treatment alone, and 8 weeks is always substantially superior.
