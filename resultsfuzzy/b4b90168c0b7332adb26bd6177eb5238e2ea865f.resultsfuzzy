A total of 8822 and 8828 nucleotides were determined for strains 66/09 and 68/09, respectively, encompassing ORFs 2 (S protein), 3a, 3b, 3c, 4 (E protein), 5 (M protein), 6 (N protein), 7a and 7b. Alignment of the sequences with TGEV, CCoV and FCoV reference strains available in GenBank showed the highest identity to CCoV-IIb reference strain 119/08 (EU924791) (98.2% and 98.9% for 66/09 and 68/09, respectively). The two Greek strains shared an identity of 98%. The spike protein gene of both strains was 4374 nucleotides long, encoding a protein of 1457 amino acids. When compared to four TGEV-like reference strains (430/ 07, 119/08, 174/06 and 341/05), no insertions or deletions were observed. The two strains shared 97.6% aa identity to each other, while they showed the highest aa identity to CCoV-IIb reference strain 119/08 (98.3%). By Simplot analysis, the two strains displayed higher nucleotide conservation with the TGEV strain Purdue than with the pantropic CCoV-IIa strain CB/05, at the 5 0 -end of the S gene (Fig. 1) . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two Greek strains were more closely related to the four CCoV-IIb reference strains detected in dogs' organs (Fig. 2a) . The envelope protein was found to be 82 amino acids in length, like in most canine coronavirus strains and in three TGEV-like reference strains, 119/08, 174/06 and 341/05, with the exception of 430/07, which is 7 amino acids shorter. The Greek strains had high amino acid identity to each other (98.7%). E protein of strains 66/09 and 68/09 had the highest amino acid identity (100% and 98.7%, respectively) to the CCoV-IIb strains 341/05, 119/08, and to CCoV-IIa CB/05. In the E protein, phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two strains were closely related to CCoV type II strains (Fig. 2b) . The membrane protein (M protein) of strains 66/09 and 68/09 was found to be 260 and 262 amino acids long, respectively. Two amino acids were missing from the Nterminal end of the M protein of strain 66/09 in positions 24 and 36, as it has been also observed in reference CCoV-IIb strains 174/06 and 341/05. The two strains shared high amino acid similarity (94.6%). M protein of strains 66/09 and 68/09 had the highest amino acid identity to the CCoV-IIb reference strains detected in the organs (97.3% and 100%, respectively). Phylogenetic analysis of the M protein showed that the two strains were closely related to CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb strains (Fig. 2c) . The N gene (nucleoprotein) was found to be 1149 nucleotides in length, coding for a polypeptide of 382 amino acids. The two proteins were 98.1% similar. The amino acid sequences had the highest identity with CCoV-IIb 119/08 (98.6% and 99.4%, for 66/09 and 68/09, respectively). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two Greek strains were more closely related to CCoV-II reference strains (Fig. 2d) .
