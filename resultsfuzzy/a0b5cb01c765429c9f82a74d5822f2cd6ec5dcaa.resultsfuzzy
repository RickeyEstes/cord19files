We have recently reported on the use of 1 H NMR for the metabolic fingerprinting of G. glabra, G. uralensis and G. inflata extracts, targeting its secondary metabolites [17] . G (Fig. 1 ) was identified in these extracts from its well resolved singlet signals at d 0.82 (Me-28), 0.85 (Me-24), 1.08 (Me-23), 1.13 (Me-25& 26), 1.16 (Me-29) and 1.41 (Me-27), (Fig. 2C) . In the sugar region, signals at d 4.49 d (7.3 Hz) and 4.67 d (7.7 Hz) were assigned to anomeric protons of glucuronic acid moieties at H-1 0 and H-1 00 position in glycyrrhizin, respectively [17] . For detailed description on extracts chemical composition and glycyrrhizin concentration, see Farag et al. [17] . NMR signals were assigned using a combination of 2D NMR experiments ( 1 H, 1 H COSY, HSQC, and HMBC). Nevertheless, utilizing 1 D NMR and these 2D-experiments, G isomer conformational assignment could not be successfully confirmed in most licorice extracts, due to crowded 1 H NMR spectra with matrix signals which do not allow detection of signals of 18aor 18b-G. 2D ( 1 H-1 H) ROESY, a method based on proton-proton dipolar relaxation through space, was considered suitable to distinguish between 18-a and b isomers. ROESY spectra for a-and b-glycyrrhetic acid standard show distinctive crosspeaks between H-18 and its neighboring protons indicative for each isomer configuration. While the a-isomer exhibits 1,3-diaxial interaction between H-18 (d 2.37) and CH 3 -27 (d 1.39) as well as CH 3 -29 (d 1.24), the b-isomer shows interaction between H-18 (d 2.18) and equatorial CH 3 -28 appearing at d 0.82 ( Fig. 2A  and B ). ROESY spectra acquired from all licorice samples revealed that the presence of G in its b-form coincides with standard GA b-isomer crosspeak patterns (Fig. 2C) . The variance was assessed by analyzing samples from three biological replicas for each specimen. Analytical reproducibility was further assessed by measuring triplicate NMR measurements over 2 days for the biological sample GG1 and showing almost superimposed crosspeak results (data not shown). These results confirm previous reports highlighting that the b-isomer is the natural form of glycyrrhizin in G. glabra and extends to allied species studied in this paper such as G. inflata and G. uralensis. It should be noted that GA was present at trace levels in all extracts as revealed from LC/MS analysis [17] revealing that all signals assigned for GA aglycone by NMR were attributed to its glycoside form G. This result poses NMR as an appropriate tool for G isomer assignment without any chromatography step. The absence of a-glycyrrhizin, a product of the b-isomer under alkaline conditions [18] , shows that the samples were not subject to any major chemical isomerization or degradation and suggest that NMR can be applied to identify licorice samples that have undergone partial decomposition.
