A number of assays are available to detect D. immitis antigen and E. canis antibodies in canine samples. Because different reagents and methods are used in different assays, results can be discordant. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of 2 commercially available assays using samples from dogs in low and high risk areas for the target organisms. Adult dogs (n = 20) that were screened for D. immitis antigen in San Pedro, Belize in August of 2014 were selected as those likely to be concurrently infested by Rhipicephalus sanguineous and so at high risk for E. canis exposure. Sera were also collected from dogs entering two shelters in northern Colorado from May 2014 to October 2014; this area is considered low risk for both E. canis and D. immitis. A commercially available kit (SNAP 4DX Plus; IDEXX Laboratories) was used to assess serum from dogs on site in Belize and from thawed serum in Colorado. The sera was then stored at -20C until shipped on cold packs to a commercial laboratory (Antech Diagnostics; Lake Success, NY) for evaluation in the other assay (Accuplex 4). Agreement between the assays was determined using the kappa statistic. The results for the 2 assays for D. immitis antigen and Ehrlichia spp. antibodies using sera from the 2 regions are listed in the following Table. In the high risk area, agreement between the 2 assays was perfect for D. immitis and good for Ehrlichia spp. In the low risk area, agreement between the assays was worse than chance for Ehrlichia spp. and fair for D. immitis. When both regions were compared the agreement was good for both organisms. In low risk area, the Accuplex 4 detected D. immitis antigen in 4 more dogs than the SNAP4DxPlus. Since necropsy was not available whether this finding represents the previously described increased sensitivity of the Accuplex 4 cannot be determined. In the low risk area, the SNAP4DxPlus detected Ehrlichia spp. antibodies in 4 more dogs than the Accuplex 4. The Accuplex 4 is E. canis specific whereas the SNAP4DXPlus detects antibodies against other organisms like E. ewingii and E. chaffeensis which may explain the discordant results. Bartonella henselae is an important vector borne disease agent associated with clinical disease in many species including humans, cats, and dogs. Cats are a known definitive host and Ctenocephalides felis has been proven as a vector. Bartonella henselae can be grown from C. felis frass for at least 9 days. In a previous experiment, 1 of 4 research beagles was infected by B. henselae after nasal inoculation of infected C. felis frass. As cats frequently ingest C. felis and frass during grooming, the purpose of this study was assess the potential for oral B. henselae transmission after ingestion of infected C. felis. In this study, 4 purpose bred, 1 year old kittens from a barrier facility free of vectors were shown to be negative for FeLV antigen, FIV antibodies, Bartonella spp. antibodies, and Bartonella spp. DNA in blood by PCR assay. Two of the cats were infected with the CSU1 strain of B. henselae in a concurrent experiment. When used in the current experiment, the cats were shown to still be strongly positive for B. henselae DNA in blood using a previously published PCR assay targeting the 16S-23S intergenic region. A total of 25 female and 25 male C. felis purchased from a commercial laboratory were placed into two separate flea chambers, one of which was placed on the flank of each of the two B. henselae na€ ıve kittens and the C. felis allowed to feed for 5 days. At that time, the 10 of the C. felis from each chamber were removed from the chamber for assessment of B. henselae infection by PCR assay. The remainder of C. felis were cold stunned and were mixed together with the eggs and frass as a slurry with baby food and administered orally to one of each Bartonella spp. na€ ıve cast. Blood and sera were then collected weekly for 12 weeks and assayed for Bartonella spp. antibodies and Bartonella spp. DNA by PCR assay. The aliquot of C. felis collected from the chamber of each B. henselae infected cat was strongly positive for B. henselae DNA. Over the course of the 12 week study, neither of the orally inoculated cats developed Bartonella spp. antibodies in serum or Bartonella spp. DNA in blood. The two cats orally inoculated with B. henselae infected C. felis and frass had no evidence of dental disease or stomatitis and did not develop evidence of infection over the time period studied with the defined assays. These results suggest that normal cats ingesting B. henselae infected C. felis are unlikely to become infected. However, further experiments should be performed to assess this route of transmission using more sensitive assays like BAPGM culture plus PCR assay and to use kittens that are teething or cats affected by oral cavity disease to provide a potential portal of entry for B. henselae. Bacterial cystitis is common in dogs as both a primary disorder and as a complication of co-morbid conditions. An increase in urinary isolates resistant to antimicrobial drugs has been reported in recent years. Multiple drug resistant (MDR) organisms, defined as organisms with acquired resistance to at least one member of 3 or more classes of antimicrobials, seem to be commonplace in the Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of Missouri. We undertook a descriptive retrospective study of drug resistance of urinary isolates from the MU-VMDL from Jan. 1, 2014 1, to Nov. 19, 2014 Urine cultures were performed using calibrated loops delivering urine to both blood agar and MacConkey agar plates for aerobic bacterial isolation. Plates were incubated under routine culture conditions. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of resultant isolates was accomplished with the MIC technique using commercially prepared lyophilized trays. Breakpoints for determination of resistance or susceptibility were based on the standards set by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Antimicrobials included on routine susceptibility profiles differed slightly depending on organism (to exclude intrinsic resistance) but included aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin), potentiated penicillin and carboxypenicillin (amoxicillin-clavulanate, ticarcillin-clavulanate), natural and synthetic penicillins and carboxypenicillin (ampicillin, penicillin, oxacillin +2% NACL, ticarcillin), 1st generation cephalosporins (cefazolin, cephalothin), 2nd generation cephalosporins (cefoxitin, ceftiofur), 3rd generation cephalosporins (cefovecin, cefpodoxime), chloramphenicol, clindamycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin), imipenem, rifampin, and trimethoprim sulfa (TMS). The 4 most common isolates (E. coli, Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp) were evaluated. Innate antimicrobial resistance was defined for each of the four microbes of interest as follows: E. coliclindamycin, erythromycin, penicillin; Staphylococcus spp.aminoglycosides; Streptococcus spp.aminoglycosides; Enterococcus spp.aminoglycosides, all generations of cephalosporins, and TMS.
