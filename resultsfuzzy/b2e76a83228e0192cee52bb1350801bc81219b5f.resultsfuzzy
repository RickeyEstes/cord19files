The following models, each with different parameters, are found to provide a good fit to the data for the tranquil period. The first model considered was the parsimonious (0, d, 1) structure as suggested by Akaike information criterion (AIC): The dth difference of a series is denoted by D d . A seasonal difference is denoted by D s , where s is the period of the data. The Dth such seasonal difference is D D s . In Eq. (5), we use monthly data and therefore 12th difference the data first and then first difference the resulting series, which is denoted by D 1 D 1 12 X t . The second best model suggested by AIC was the (4, d, 6) structure: fðBÞð1 À BÞ 0:269 ðD 1 X t Þ ¼ yðBÞZ t , fðBÞ ¼ 1 þ 0:716B þ 0:144B 2 þ 0:297B 3 þ 0:618B 4 , yðBÞ ¼ 1 À 0:041B À 0:643B 2 þ 0:103B 3 þ 0:851B 4 À 0:214B 5 À 0:550B 6 . ð6Þ Note that the resulting structure in Eq. (5) took into account the seasonal difference, while Eq. (6) ignored it. The forecasting performance of both models will be compared later. A frequently used descriptive device for measuring forecasting performance is the sample MAPE (Makridakis & Hibon, 1979; Makridakis et al., 1984) . The coefficient MAPE measures the mean of absolute percent error of prediction and is given by whereX t and X t represent the forecast and actual values. The MAPEs for Eqs. (5) and (6) were 1.738% and 7.578%, respectively. Guided by AIC and out-of-sample analysis of forecasting accuracy, we choose the structure of Eq. (5) for the tranquil period. The results are illustrated in Table 2 along with the outcomes of previous empirical studies in an attempt to make a comparison. difficult to produce a value of MAPE less than 2%, as far as the ex post forecasting of monthly tourist arrivals is concerned. This is especially so when the prediction horizon lasts for 19 months. Among the models which rendered a MAPE of less than 2%, the fractionally integrated ARMA approach has a 4.15% and 6.41% improvement over the combined forecast and ARIMA (3, 1, 0) (0, 1, 0) 12 , respectively. The improvement over the rest of the models is even more remarkable. All pose doubledigit percentage MAPE improvement. The sample forecasts and actual arrivals are graphically illustrated in Fig. 4 . The forecasts follow the overall trend in tourist arrivals, and do capture the cyclical fluctuations that occurred during the prediction interval. The forecasts reproduce most of the turning points as well. Table 3 shows both the forecasts and actual numbers. For comparison among the models which manufactured MAPEs below 2%, the results of ARIMA (3, 1, 0) (0, 1, 0) 12 and the combined forecast models are also presented. Forecasts with minimal errors are in bold face. The mean and standard deviation of the absolute percentage errors are illustrated in Table 4 . Regarding the overall performances, the selected ARFIMA dominated convincingly.
