To examine the CME pathway in polarized MDCK cells, we first utilized pharmacological inhibitors that target the CME pathways in host cells. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), which prevents clathrin assembly, has been widely used to block CME including studies on the entry mechanism of influenza viruses in non-polarized cells [1] . Dynasore has an inhibitory effect on GTPase activity of dynamin with low cell toxicity [15] . Since the discovery of dynasore, it has been widely used as specific dynamin inhibitor for entry studies of various virus [16] [17] [18] . CPZ or dynasore were used to treat fully polarized MDCK II cells and non-polarized MDCK-CCL34 cells for 30 min before infection with influenza virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1). At 5 h post infection, cells were fixed and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. MDCK-CCL34 cells were more sensitive to the toxicity of CPZ than MDCK II cells; thus lower concentrations of CPZ were used to treat MDCK-CCL34 cells. The quantity of inhibitors used in the treatment did not affect cell viability (data not shown). Treatment with CPZ on both MDCK-CCL34 and MDCK II caused a substantial reduction on the number of NP expressing cells after influenza infection (Fig. 1A) However, dynasore treatment had a more obvious impact on polarized MDCK II cells than their non-polarized counterpart (Fig. 1B) . This evidence indicates a potential role of dynamin in the entry pathway of polarized MDCK II cells, while non-polarized MDCK-CCL34 cells do not depend as much on dynamin usage for entry. The effect of CPZ and dynamin on the canine kidney cells were further confirmed by western blot analysis (Fig. 1C) . The pharmacological approaches mentioned above indicate an important role of CME in influenza virus infection in both polarized MDCK II cells and non-polarized MDCK-CCL34 cells. However, we wished to examine specific components of the CME pathway. Conventional transfection methods with cationic lipid or adenovirus transduction are either of low transfection efficiency or not ideal for our study. To overcome the difficulty of recombinant protein expression, we used electroporation on monolayer cells as described in [14] . We electroporated WT or DN constructs of dynamin 2 ( Fig. 2A) , Eps15 (Fig. 2B) , or Epn1 (Fig. 2C) into fully polarized MDCK II cells and infected these cells with influenza virus at a MOI of 5 after 18 h post electroporation. Cells were then fixed and stained for confocal microscopy after 5 h of infection. Expression of the DN form of dynamin 2 or Epn1 resulted in a statistically significant reduction of percentage of GFP or EYFP expressing cells that were positive for viral NP expression, compared to the control WT version of the respective construct (Fig. 2D) . Unlike in nonpolarized cells such as HeLa cells described in a previous study [6] , Eps15-D95/295-GFP DN construct expression in MDCK II cells also significantly reduced the percentage of cells infected with influenza virus and expressing viral NP, comparing to its WT counterpart Eps15-DIIID2-GFP expressing cells. Recently influenza virus has been shown to be able to enter host cell via macropinocytosis pathway [7, 19] . To examine whether influenza virus can also utilize macropinocytosis in polarized MDCK II cells, we used 5-ethylisopropyl amiloride (EIPA), a macropinocytosis inhibitor that inhibits Na + /H + exchanger activity, to treat the canine kidney cells before infecting with influenza virus [20] . By examination of viral protein M1 in whole cell lysate using western blot analysis, we found that neither MDCK-CCL34 cells nor MDCK II cells were significantly inhibited by EIPA, compared to leading control, regardless of drug treatment concentrations (Fig. 3) . Our data suggest that similar to non-polarized MDCK cells, there exist redundant entry pathways (presumably CME) in polarized MDCK cells and macropinocytosis is not a preferential major pathway utilized by influenza virus in the cells used in this study. In non-polarized cell systems, influenza was shown to enter host cells via caveolae-independent entry routes [6] . To examine whether influenza virus enters polarized MDCK II cells via caveolae-independent entry pathway as in previous studies on non-polarized cells, we first treated the MDCK-CCL34 or MDCK II cells with different concentrations of caveolae-inhibiting drugs such as methyl-b-cyclodextrin (MBCD) and nystatin. As revealed by expression of viral protein M1 on western blot, treatment with high concentrations of MBCD were able to inhibit both polarized MDCK II cells and non-polarized MDCK-CCL34 cells (Fig. 4A) . In contrast, nystatin did not have an inhibitory effect on either cell type. To examine the caveolar-mediated pathway more specifically in polarized MDCK II cells, we electroporated GFP-tagged caveolin-1 WT or DN plasmids into polarized MDCK II cells before infection with influenza virus. Caveolin-1 is a major structural protein in the caveolae. Using confocal microscopy, both Cav1 WT and Cav1 DN expressing cells were able to be infected by influenza virus as shown by the positive signal of viral NP in the transfected cells ( Fig. 4C and D) . The discrepancy in influenza virus infectivity in MDCK II cell after treatment with MBCD and with nystatin may be due to the discrete modes of action by the two drugs: MBCD inhibition of influenza virus entry in both MDCK-CCL34 and MDCK II cells was not by inhibiting caveolae-dependent endocytosis, by altering the structure of cholesterol-rich domain in plasma membrane. A similar observation was also described in SARS-coronavirus entry studies [21, 22] . Taken together, our data demonstrated that, similar to non-polarized MDCK cells, influenza virus does not enter polarized MDCK II through caveolae-dependent endocytosis. To our knowledge, this is the first time that endocytic pathways employed by influenza virus in a fully polarized epithelial cell system grown on Transwell filters have been examined. Polarized epithelial cells are usually refractory to transfection and more difficult to work with compared to non-polarized cells. Components in the CME pathway have shown to be regulators of cell polarity [23, 24] , so to avoid DN cellular proteins disrupting formation of proper cellular polarity, we chose to introduce the DN constructs to the MDCK II cells after the cells had formed a tight monolayer and were fully polarized. Conventional transfection methods utilizing cationic lipid often yields low transfection efficiency in polarized epithelial cells (data not shown). Adenovirus transduction to introduce recombinant protein into polarized epithelia is another frequently used method. However, adenovirus can induce macropinocytosis and other undesirable signaling events after gaining access into host cell [25] [26] [27] [28] . Dynamin2 and Epn1 DN proteins had a small reduction on the percentage of MDCK II cells infected with influenza virus. This may be due to a masking effect by other endocytic pathways that the virus particles enter through while CME pathway was inhibited (at least partially) by dynamin 2 or Epn1 DN proteins. Unexpectedly, a large portion of polarized MDCK II cells expressing Eps15 DN were not able to be infected by influenza virus (Fig. 3D ). Eps15 is an adaptor protein that interacts with Epsin1, AP180, and synaptojanin via the Eps homology (EH) domains and recruits cargo adaptor protein AP-2 to plasma membrane [29] . The inhibitory effect of Eps15-D95/295 DN protein on influenza virus entry in polarized MDCK II cells suggests that Eps15 plays an important role for influenza virus entry in the CME pathway. The requirement of functional Eps15 for influenza virus in clathrin-coated pits could involve a different adaptor protein that is associated with Eps15. In non-polarized cell systems, it is well documented that influenza virus can enter host cells through CME [6, 8] . However, other entry routes, such as clathrin, caveolae-independent routes and macropinocytosis, have also been described [6, 7] , suggesting that influenza infectious entry utilizes different endocytic routes in different non-polarized epithelial cell types [30] . By using pharmacological and molecular approaches, our study demonstrates that influenza virus selectively enters polarized MDCK II cells via a clathrin-dependent route.
