Identification and bioinformatic analysis of fifo in Culex flavivirus and Quang Binh virus The available insect-specific flavivirus NS2A/NS2B sequences divide into two major phylogenetic clades (Fig. 1A ). The first clade (hereafter Clade 1) comprises CxFV, QBV and NAKV, while the second clade (hereafter Clade 2) encompasses CFAV, KRV and AEFV. It should be noted, however, that in phylogenetic studies performed using envelope gene sequences, CFAV clusters with CxFV instead of KRV (Hoshino et al., 2007) . CSA also belongs to Clade 2. We first identified fifo as an unusually long ORF conserved throughout all available CxFV sequences with coverage of the NS2A/NS2B region of the genome (six sequences; Fig. 2, panel 4) . In the CxFV Tokyo strain (GenBank ID: AB262759), the polyprotein coding sequence encompasses nucleotides 92-10183 and the maximal (i.e., stop codon to stop codon) coordinates for the fifo ORF are 3328-4290, giving rise to a 321-codon ORF in the +2 frame relative to the polyprotein coding sequence. The entire polyprotein coding sequence of AB262759 has 162 stop codons in the +2 frame out of a total of 3363 codons so, on average, a 321-codon region in the + 2 frame would be expected to contain 15.5 stop codons. Thus, the probability of obtaining an uninterrupted 321-codon +2 frame ORF simply by chance is extremely small. Indeed, if +2 frame stop codons within the polyprotein coding sequence are assumed to be randomly distributed, then the probability is of order p ∼ 2 × 10 -5 . To guard against the possibility that the absence of stop codons in the +2 frame could be due to an unusual amino acid composition in the NS2A/NS2B region of the polyprotein (e.g., these proteins are particularly hydrophobic), we used a simplified (i.e., single-sequence) version of the CCRT statistic of Chung et al. (2007) , as follows. A codon usage table for AB262759 was calculated using the entire polyprotein coding sequence. Then zero-frame codons in the fifo region were replaced with codons drawn randomly according to the frequencies in the codon usage table, while maintaining the zero-frame amino acid sequence. This randomization procedure was repeated 10,000 times, and the number of +2 frame stop codons (in the fifo region) was counted for each randomization. Only 0.02% of the randomized sequences had an uninterrupted + 2 frame ORF, and the mean number of + 2 frame stop codons was 8.3. Thus, although the amino acid composition of the NS2A/NS2B proteins does favour a reduction in the number of +2 frame stop codons (8.3 expected, compared with 15.5 expected if whole-polyprotein frequencies are assumed), the reduction is not enough to explain the presence of such a long + 2 frame ORF as a chance event. Further inspection showed that a long ORF was also present at this genomic location in the related QBV (GenBank ID: FJ644291; Fig. 2 , panel 4). Here, the maximal fifo ORF comprises 296 codons. Alignment with the CxFV sequences showed that the maximal QBV fifo ORF is 22 codons shorter at the 5′ end and 3 codons shorter at the 3′ end than the maximal CxFV fifo ORF. In fact (see below) the proposed ribosomal frameshift site is 5 codons into the QBV ORF and 27 codons into the CxFV ORF, so that the frameshift sites align and frameshifting would give access to a 295-codon ORF in CxFV and a 292-codon ORF in QBV. Within this ORF there are 286 point nucleotide differences (33%) between QBV FJ644291 and CxFV AB262759, and yet the open reading frame is preserved in both viruses. Next, the polyprotein coding sequences were analyzed for conservation at synonymous sites, as described in Firth and Atkins (2009) . The polyprotein coding sequences from QBV and six CxFV isolates were extracted, translated, aligned with CLUSTALW (Larkin et al., 2007) , and back-translated to a nucleotide sequence alignment. Beginning with pairwise sequence comparisons, conservation at synonymous sites (only) was evaluated by comparing the observed number of base substitutions with the number expected under a neutral evolution model. The procedure takes into account whether synonymous site codons are 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-or 6-fold degenerate and the differing probabilities of transitions and transversions. Statistics were then summed over a phylogenetic tree as described in Firth and Brown (2006) , and averaged over a sliding window. The analysis revealed a striking, and highly statistically significant (p ∼ 4 × 10 -16 for the total conservation within the whole fifo ORF), peak in polyprotein-frame synonymous site conservation in a region corresponding precisely to the conserved open reading frame, fifo (Fig. 2 , panels 5-8). Peaks in synonymous site conservation are generally indicative of functionally important overlapping elements. Although, in general, such elements may be either coding or noncoding, the extent (∼300 codons) and degree (Fig. 2, panel 6 ) of the conservation here would be unusual for a non-coding element. One other explanation for extended conservation could be recombination (though apparently relatively rare in the flaviviruses; Simmonds, 2006; Taucher et al., 2010) . However, recombination is expected to suppress the observed frequency of non-synonymous substitutions at least as much as the observed frequency of synonymous substitutions whereas the opposite effect is observed in this case. For example, in a comparison between QBV FJ644291 and CxFV AB262759, the relative frequencies of identical, distinct but synonymous, and non-synonymous polyprotein-frame aligned codon pairs were 36± 3%, 27 ± 3% and 37 ± 4% within the fifo region, and 28 ± 1%, 40 ± 1% and 32 ± 1% outside of the fifo region. (The observed frequencies are, of course, exact numbers. The 'error' rangesbased on simple Poisson statisticsare simply for assessing the statistical significance of the observed differences.) Thus, although the frequency of polyprotein-frame synonymous substitutions is greatly reduced within the fifo region (27 ± 3% compared with 40± 1% outside of fifo), the frequency of non-synonymous substitutions is in fact slightly increased (37 ± 4% compared with 32 ± 1% outside of fifo). Similarly, application of a variety of recombination-detection programs from the RDP2 package (Martin et al., 2005) failed to identify potential recombination in this region of the genome. Finally, recombination Fig. 2 . Conservation at synonymous sites in CxFV and QBV. Conservation was calculated for an input alignment comprising the polyprotein coding sequences from the CxFV sequences AB262759, AB377213, FJ663034, FJ502995, GQ165808 and EU879060, and the QBV sequence FJ644291. Panel 1 shows a map of the CxFV genome, along with the proposed overlapping gene fifo and the proposed frameshift site. Panels 2-4 show the positions of stop codons in the three forward reading frames. The + 0 frame is the polyprotein frame and is therefore devoid of stop codons. Note the conserved absence of stop codons in the − 1/+ 2 frame within the fifo ORF. Panels 5-8 depict the conservation at polyprotein-frame synonymous sites. Panels 5 and 7 depict the probability that the degree of conservation within a given window could be obtained under a null model of neutral evolution at synonymous sites, while panels 6 and 8 depict the absolute amount of conservation as represented by the ratio of the observed number of substitutions within a given window to the number expected under the null model (see Firth and Atkins, 2009, for details) . Note that the large sliding window size (75 codons) is responsible for the broad smoothing of the conservation scores at either end of the fifo ORF. The range of features detected by this type of analysis depends partly on the sliding window size − 75 codons is optimal for features with a width of 75 codons. If features cover fewer codons (e.g., many non-coding functional elements), then the corresponding conservation peaks may be diluted to such an extent that they are not distinguishable from background noise. does not provide an explanation for the other evidence presented herein (e.g., a conserved long open reading frame, a conserved and welldefined translation mechanism, and presence in all other sequenced insect-specific flaviviruses). We next inspected the sequences for a potential translation mechanism. It is unlikely that independent initiation (e.g., via an internal ribosome entry site or shunting mechanism) occurs since there is no positionally conserved AUG codon in the CxFV/QBV alignment, and some sequences have no AUG codon until 119 codons into the ORF. However, near the 5′ end of the fifo ORFs of both CxFV and QBV we found a conserved slippery heptanucleotide motif G GAU UUC (spaces separate polyprotein or zero-frame codons). The slippery site was followed by a 7-nt spacer and then a large RNA hairpin structure containing one unpaired residue and, in CxFV, a 1-bp symmetric bulge (Fig. 3) . The hairpin structure was essentially conserved in CxFV and QBValbeit with some minor differences near the apex, and some G:C to G:U or A:U to G:U substitutions in the stem that preserved the base pairings. Allowing for G:U codon: anticodon re-pairing at position 2 of the heptanucleotide, the combination of the G GAU UUC heptanucleotide and the 3′-adjacent RNA hairpin structure fit the consensus motif for − 1 ribosomal frameshifting. In fact G GAU UUH is a recognized shifty site. Frameshifting in Red clover necrotic mosaic virus and other dianthoviruses, besides certain umbraviruses, occurs at G GAU UUU (Bekaert and Rousset, 2005; Gibbs et al., 1996; Kim and Lommel, 1994) . Brierley et al. (1992) measured an in vitro frameshifting efficiency of 15.5% for G GAU UUA in the context of a 'minimal' infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) based 3′-adjacent pseudoknot, compared with 16.1% for G GGU UUA in the same context. Thus, all other things being equal, G GAU UUH may be expected to stimulate frameshifting as efficiently as G GGU UUH. Brierley et al. (1992) measured frameshifting efficiencies of 38.3% and 15.8%, respectively, for G GGU UUU and G GGU UUC. Although there is no reason to expect that these values (measured in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and in the context of the minimal IBV-based 3′-adjacent pseudoknot) are representative of values in insect cells infected with insect-specific flaviviruses, it nonetheless seems reasonable to suppose that frameshifting at this site has the potential to be highly efficient. Moreover, the functional importance of the G GAU UUC motif in CxFV and QBV is supported by the conservation of 'G' at position one, despite the corresponding polyprotein-frame codon encoding different amino acids in the two viruses (ccG/proline in CxFV; caG/ glutamine in QBV). Frameshifting at this location would result in the translation of a 295-codon (CxFV) or 292-codon (QBV) −1/+2 frame ORF (see Fig. 4 for an amino acid alignment), fused to the N-terminal region of NS2A.
