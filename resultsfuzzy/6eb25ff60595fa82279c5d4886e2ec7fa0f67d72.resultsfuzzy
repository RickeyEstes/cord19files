The results of the first part of the questionnaire showed that, among various home-related SBS symptoms, nose discomfort (e.g. running nose, sneezing) was the commonest in Hong Kong. The respondents strongly believed that their nose discomfort was building-related despite the absence of any central ventilation system in their apartment buildings. There are two implications. First, the results shed light on the controversy over whether the occurrence of SBS is mostly related to the physical indoor environment or psychosocial factors. Researchers have conducted most of their epidemiological indoor environmental studies in workplaces. The study added insight to the existing literature by arguing that SBS can also occur in residential buildings, which are presumably warm shelters for families and where job pressure should be less severe. Second, the nose symptoms are much commoner in Hong Kong than in Sweden, implying that home SBS could vary from place to place. Such a variation could be due to the fact that homes are generally less self-contained (e.g. rely more on natural lighting and ventilation) than offices so that the SBS exhibited at home depends very much more on the quality of the external environment. Further study is, however, needed to examine how much time people actually spend in the flat with the windows open or without using air-conditioners. The second part of the questionnaire revealed that noise was the major IEQ problem perceived by residents. In an apartment building, noise usually came internally from neighbors or drainage pipes and externally from traffic or construction sites. The result is consistent with the large number of noise complaints in Hong Kong. It is interesting to note that the respondents were generally satisfied with the ventilation despite their complaints about nose discomfort. This prompted us to carry out a statistical analysis of the relationship between SBS and perceived IEQ. The regression analysis showed that the occurrence of some of the SBS symptoms, in particular nose and head symptoms that could be attributed to such environmental factors as air quality and density, affected how respondents rated the IEQ of their apartments. Residents with nose and head symptoms gave a significantly lower rating of their overall IEQ than those without. This is the case even after the perception of individual IEQ factors (e.g. the quality of noise, light, and air) and building characteristics have been controlled. This finding has a very important implication for those who base the evaluation of internal spaces on perceived IEQ: the overall IEQ rating would be biased downward if the respondents have SBS symptoms. That is, even if respondents were satisfied with specific IEQ criteria, the overall IEQ could still be unsatisfactory to respondents with selfreported SBS symptoms. This could purely be a perception bias that has no bearing on the actual IEQ or SBS symptoms. Ignoring this bias might lead a housing manager to make a wrong decision on improvement measures. There are two approaches to solving this problem. One is to abandon any attempt to make subjective measurements and to base all improvement decisions solely on objective IEQ investigation. This approach, however, can be very costly if objective measurement is to be carried out frequently. It also undermines the importance of customer satisfaction. The other approach is to correct for the bias in subjective IEQ assessment. This is relatively easy: ask the respondents for their SBS symptoms in addition to their IEQ ratings, and use statistical methods, such as the Heckman's (1979) two-stage estimator, to correct for the bias. In this way, occupants' opinions can be effectively incorporated into the building management process (e.g. before carrying out objective IEQ investigation and after completion of improvement work).
