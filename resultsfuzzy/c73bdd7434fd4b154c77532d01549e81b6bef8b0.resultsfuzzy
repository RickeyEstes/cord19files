Model (2.3) is well posed, as established by the following theorem. þ is invariant under the flow of (2.3), with S i ði ¼ 1; 2Þ remaining positive. The total population within each patch converges to a steady state as t ! 1 and solutions are bounded. Proof. Under initial conditions (2.4), if for instance I 1 becomes zero at some time t 1 before I 2 becomes zero, then from (2.3b), dI 1 =dt ¼ m 21 I 2 P 0 at t 1 , which shows that I 1 is a non-decreasing function of t at t 1 . Hence, I 1 stays non-negative. Similarly, so does I 2 . Suppose now that at some time which implies that dS 1 =dt > 0 when S 1 is positive and small. Thus, there is no time t 2 such that S 1 ðt 2 Þ ¼ 0. Therefore, S 1 stays positive for t > 0 when the initial condition S 1 ð0Þ > 0. By a similar argument, we obtain the positivity of S 2 . From system (2.3), the differential equations governing the evolution of N 1 and N 2 are A simple calculation shows that the positive equilibrium ðN Ã 1 ; N Ã 2 Þ is the unique equilibrium of (3.1) and is a stable node, with ð3:2aÞ Since the positive orthant R 4 þ is invariant under (2.3) and that the total population is bounded, the individual components are also bounded. h
