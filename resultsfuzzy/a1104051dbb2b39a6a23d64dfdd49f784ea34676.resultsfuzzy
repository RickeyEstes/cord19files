Selection of ssDNA aptamers to recognize N protein of SARS CoV The N protein for selection of ssDNA aptamer was purified to homogeneity through sequential chromatography steps including Q-sepharose, Ni-IDA, and Sephadex G-75. The purified N protein was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using His probe-HRP (data not shown). The 88mer ssDNA library containing 45-nucleotide long random sequences was constructed and screened by SELEX to discover ssDNA aptamers that specifically bound to the SARS CoV N protein (Fig. 1) . To generate the ssDNA after PCR, λ-exonuclease was added to digest the phosphorylated DNA strand and the ssDNA band was confirmed by native PAGE at each cycle (data not shown). To isolate the ssDNA aptamers that displayed a high binding affinity for the N protein, a more stringent selection condition was employed at round no. 8 by decreasing the protein concentration as described in Materials and methods. Enrichment of ssDNA aptamers specific to the N protein was monitored based on the N proteinbiotinylated ssDNA aptamer interaction by ELISA (Fig. 2A) . ssDNA FIG. 3 . Affinity measurements and predicted secondary structure of aptamer 1. (A) Affinity measurement of N protein-selected ssDNA aptamers interaction by ELISA. The N protein was incubated with increasing concentrations of 5′-biotinylated aptamer 1 and 11. After addition of streptavidin-HRP, the amount of N protein-aptamer complex was calculated and graphed as a function of aptamer concentration. The graph was fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation and the K d was calculated (4.93 ± 0.30 nM (aptamer 1) and 9.02 ± 1.89 nM (aptamer 11)). (B) Predicted secondary structure of aptamer 1 using Zuker's MFOLD program. pools isolated after rounds 6, 8, 11, and 12 were tested for binding to the N protein. In these experiments, the absorbance at 492 nm increased significantly at round no. 11. After twelve cycles of selection, we obtained 15 different ssDNA aptamers, and the nucleotide sequences of these aptamers were determined (Fig. 2B) . Subsequent bioinformatic analysis was performed by ClustalW2, and the ssDNA aptamers were classified into four groups and five unrelated individual ssDNA aptamers as shown in Fig. 2B . Groups 1-4 contained characteristic clusters of nucleotides in the 45 random sequence region (indicated by asterisk). In group 1, four different ssDNA aptamers were shown to contain three nucleotides (TTG) followed by GC rich conserved sequences in the 45-base random region. Groups 2 and 3 were shown to have (CTTG) followed by (CAGTTCG) and (CAATA), respectively. In addition, several nucleotides were matched in group 4, but it was difficult to identify any characteristic clusters of nucleotides in the five unrelated individual ssDNA aptamers. Binding affinity measurements of selected ssDNA aptamers with N protein ELISA experiments were then performed using the 5′-biotinylated aptamer candidates identified above to assess the binding affinities of these aptamers to the N protein. The N protein was immobilized on Ni-coated plates and various concentrations of the 5′-biotinylated aptamer candidates were added. After addition of streptavidin-HRP, the absorbance at 492 nm was measured. The binding curve was fit to a hyperbolic equation based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and we were able to obtain the amplitude and K d value (Table S1 ). Of the 15 aptamer candidates, the K d values of two aptamers, named aptamer 1 and aptamer 11, that displayed high affinity were determined from the binding curve (Fig. 3A) . Although both aptamers showed high binding affinities to the N protein, aptamer 1 (K d = 4.93 ± 0.30 nM) exhibited a slightly higher affinity than aptamer 11 (K d = 9.02 ±1.89 nM). When we compared the K d values of the ssDNA aptamers with RNA aptamer (equilibrium dissociation constant of 1.65 nM), which was recently published (15), they were quite comparable. However, the nucleotide sequence and secondary structure of the selected RNA aptamer are different from the ones of our selected DNA aptamers. This suggests that the nucleotide component is not important for high affinity binding to the N protein. Therefore, proper binding to the protein might be more important for nucleic acid aptamers even though the exact binding site is unknown at present. In addition, the fact that natural RNA is very liable to digest by nuclease attack makes DNA a more suitable candidate for target protein detection. Based on the ELISA results, aptamer 1 was chosen for further bioinformatic analysis and the MFOLD program was used to predict secondary structures (Fig. 3B) . In this analysis, the 45 random sequence region of aptamer 1 (shaded nucleotides) was shown to consist of a major loop with a small hairpin and base-paired nucleotides with the defined sequences flanking the random region. The GC rich conserved sequence, as described in group 1 aptamers, was also found to be located at the stem-loop region (indicated by black line). Western blot analysis using selected ssDNA aptamer Western blot analysis was performed to determine if the selected ssDNA aptamer 1 can be used as a substitute for the N protein antibody. When various amounts of N protein (0-18.4 μg) were analyzed by Western blotting with 500 ng/mL of 5′-biotinylated aptamer 1, we found that the band intensities increased as the amount of N protein increased (Fig. 4A ). This indicates that the selected aptamer 1 bound to the N protein in dose dependent manner, and could be used as an alternative to antibodies for the detection of the N protein. We also performed a comparative Western blotting experiments with commercial His probe-HRP and Anti-N protein followed by secondary antibody conjugated HRP (Fig. 4B) . The result showed that the band intensities generated using the anti-N protein and aptamer 1 were similar to each other (lanes 2 and 3 in Fig. 4B) . However, the detection sensitivity was not significant when the His probe-HRP was used (lane 1 in Fig. 4B ) under the reaction condition described above. Our results suggest that the ssDNA aptamer isolated in this study could be used as an alternative to the antibody for the detection of the N protein. Because aptamers can bind to specific target proteins with high affinity, they have been referred to as 'chemical antibodies'. It is also worth noting that DNA can be synthesized easily while antibody generation relies on the immune system of animals. In addition, the fact that aptamers have higher stability than protein antibodies makes aptamers more useful in the development of diagnostic systems, such as viral infection and cancers (20) . Considering the importance of the N protein to SARS CoV infection, a method for the fast and reliable detection of the N protein should be established. In the present study, we developed a new ssDNA aptamer that specifically bound to the SARS CoV N protein. It is expected that the selected ssDNA aptamer 1 can be used for the sensitive diagnosis of SARS.
