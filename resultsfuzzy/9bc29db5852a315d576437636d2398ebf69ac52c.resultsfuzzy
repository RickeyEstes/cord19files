Given the great need for new interventions to fight infectious diseases, particularly those like malaria and tuberculosis where drug resistance is a major issue, drug repurposing/repositioning is becoming an important area of research. In cancer research, drug repositioning is becoming an effective path for improving treatment, particularly as researchers gain a better understanding of specific oncogenic mutations [32] . The repurposing of Imatinib and Crizotinib for additional cancer types (but with the same mutations) is example of the benefits gained from precision medicine, particularly the improved understanding of the genomic factors influencing disease development [33, 34] . So far, in infectious disease research most work in the area of drug repositioning has been done for antimicrobial treatments [35] [36] [37] . However, with increasing knowledge about host-virus interactions and the evolutionary relationships between viruses, along with improved development of targeted vaccine adjuvants [38, 39] , could repurposing techniques play a role in vaccine development as well? This is an intriguing question that remains to be answered, but which could provide promising opportunities for new vaccine candidates. While development of new interventions is crucial, techniques for improving delivery of treatments available now should also be a priority. With the advent of precision medicine, there is an emphasis on the discovery of clinically actionable information to ensure the well-timed delivery of the correct drug at the accurate dose specific for a given patient [40] . Precision medicine embraces the notion that molecular information improves the precision with which patients are stratified and treated [41] and has clear implications for vaccine development and delivery. Recent studies have begun to focus on examining the genetic variation related to vaccine-specific immune responses. For example, Ovsyannikova et al. have reported polymorphisms in CD46 and SLAM, both cellular receptors for the measles virus, are significantly associated with the immune response to measles vaccine [42, 43] . Studies like these will help shape omics-guided stratification and individualized delivery/dosing.
