Identification of putative G4 motifs in the promoter region of Mtb genes. To detect the presence of putative G4 motifs, the Mtb genome was scrutinized in silico assessing various lengths of G-islands and loops ( Supplementary Figures 1a and b) . A G4 was reported when at least four consecutive G-islands (n = 4) were identified. We also defined two parameters, l and d, corresponding to the minimal length of a G4 homopolymeric G-island and the maximum allowed distance between consecutive G-islands, respectively. Different combinations of l and d parameters were applied to allow the detection of G4 motifs with increasing stringency (i.e. 2 ≤ l ≤ 5 and d = 7, 11, and 15); we chose G4s with loop length up to 15 nucleotides since it has been reported that they can fold into stable G4s 59 . Computational searches have detected a high concentration of G4 motifs near promoter regions both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes and in some cases a possible role of G4 motifs in transcription regulation has been reported 60 . For this reason and because of the abundance of GC content in Mtb, we restricted G4 analysis to regions close to transcription start sites (TSS). A short and a long score were computed considering 15 and 50 nucleotides, respectively, both upstream and downstream of the G4 motif, according to Beaudoin et al. 61 ( Table 1) . The genomic coordinates of the predicted G4s both in the forward (Supplementary File S1a) and in the reverse strand (Supplementary File S1b) were intersected with the putative gene promoters, inferred by considering 50 nt upstream of the known primary TSS 62 (Table 1 and Supplementary File S2 "Primary TSS"). The G4 motifs overlapping promoter regions were ranked by the short and long scores (Supplementary File S2 "G4 overlapping promoters"). As expected, the amount of detected G4 motifs decreased with the stringency of the searching parameters (i.e. longer G-islands and shorter distance between them). Moreover, the distribution of the predicted G4s was homogeneous in the two strands of the genome, with a slight prevalence of the reverse strand in six categories (out of 12) as opposed to four categories, which were more abundant in the forward strand (Table 1) . To note that both the forward and reverse strand, depending on the gene, can be the coding strand in transcription. Genes with putative DNA G4 forming sequences in Mtb. Based on the described bioinformatics analysis, we identified 45 genes with a putative G4, upstream or overlapping their TSS, with at least 3 Gs in each island (therefore with the ability to form at least a three-stacked G4) and a short or long score ≥ 2 ( Table 2 and Supplementary File S2 "Candidate genes"). This threshold was chosen according to Beaudoin et al. 61 , which did not validate G4s with lower score. These genes were classified according to their functional category as reported in TubercuList 63 . In addition, a de novo function prediction based on Gene Ontology (GO) annotations was performed with the online server Argot2.5 64 to expand already available annotations and potentially define functions for those genes that are still hypothetical/unknown (Supplementary File S2 'Function prediction'). Globally, 35 genes out of 45 were annotated with at least one GO term: 8 of them had been previously unannotated, while the others were confirmed or expanded (Supplementary File S2 "Candidate genes"). We found that most G4s were distributed among the following functional categories: "cell wall and cell processes", "intermediary metabolism and respiration", "regulatory proteins", and "conserved hypotheticals" (i.e. conserved proteins with no confirmed known function). Among the identified putative G4s, the sequence upstream rv0166 (fadD5) (Supplementary File S2 "Candidate genes") had been previously reported by Thakur and colleagues to fold into a G4 structure 47 . The same authors reported two additional genes to display a G4 motif; these genes are not present in our analysis since they are not associated to reported TSS 62 . Scientific RepoRts | 7: 5743 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-05867-z Selected G-rich sequences in the Mtb genome fold into G4. Among the genes with a predicted G4 in their promoter region, we selected four candidates for further experimental validations, namely Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (zwf1), ATP-dependent Clp protease (clpx), Oxidation-sensing Regulator Transcription Factor (mosR), and membrane NADH dehydrogenase (ndhA) ( Table 2 ). The choice fell on putative G4s belonging to the most stable categories (at least three 'Gs' in each island and loops no longer than 11 nt), prioritizing those present in multiple categories (for instance zwf1 has a G4 that falls both in the 3_4_7 and 3_4_11 category) with at least one score > 2 and in the promoter of genes with a known function. G4 folding and topology was initially assessed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of K + , since this monovalent cation is reported to stabilize the G4 conformation. All the selected molecules in the presence of K + displayed the G4 CD signature ( Fig. 1a-d) . The zwf1 G4 structure exhibited a mixed-type conformation in K + , with a shoulder at 265 nm, a positive and a negative peak at 290 nm and 240 nm, respectively (Fig. 1a) . clpx G4 adopted a parallel-like conformation in K + , with a maximum at 265 nm and a minimum at 240 nm ( Fig. 1b) . mosR G4 folded in a mixed type conformation in K + showing a spectrum with two positive peaks (267 and 290 nm) and a negative peak at 240 nm (Fig. 1c) . Molar ellipticity values of all these structures increased in a K + -dependent manner, further supporting G4 formation ( Fig. 1a-c) . zwf1 and mosR displayed a G4-like CD spectrum (mixed-type conformation) also in the absence of K + , indicating high propensity to fold and stability. The ndhA G4 sequence transitioned from mixed-type in the absence of K + to fully antiparallel (CD spectrum with two maxima at 240 and 290 nm and a minimum at 265 nm) in the presence of K + 150 mM (Fig. 1d ). Overall our data indicate that the selected sequences of Mtb can effectively fold into G4 conformations. Stability of zwf1, clpx, mosR and ndhA G4s in the absence and presence of increasing K + concentrations (50-150 mM) was assessed by melting experiments monitored by CD, calculating the melting temperatures (T m ) according to the van't Hoff equation (Table 3 ). In all cases the CD signal decreased over temperature. For zwf1, clpx and mosR G4s a single transition between 20 °C and 90 °C was appreciable, leading to discrete T m values. ndhA G4 showed a peculiar behaviour, with a relatively high T m (60.5 ± 0.3 °C) in the absence of K + and two different T m values in the presence of K + ascribable to two transitions due to the presence of spectroscopically distinct species in solution. Overall we observed increase of T m values in a K + -dependent manner, indicating that G4s were stabilized by K + with increase of T m up to 34.1 °C ( Table 3) . Effect of G4 ligands on Mtb G4s. We next investigated Mtb G4 sequences in the presence of G4 ligands that have been reported to specifically recognize and stabilize G4 structures over double-and single-stranded nucleic acids. In particular, we tested a commercially available G4 ligand, BRACO-19 65 , and a newly synthesized compound, c-exNDI 2 21 Position of the found G4s in the Mtb genome is available in Supplementary Files S1a and S1b. of the two G4 ligands on the selected sequences in the presence of 100 mM K + was initially assessed by CD analysis: they induced mild conformational changes in Mtb G4s without affecting the main topology, which remained characteristic of the G4 conformation (Fig. 2 ). Table 2 . G4 sequences upstream or overlapping TSS in the Mtb genome, forming G4s with at least three stacked tetrads (at least 3 Gs in each G-rich island) and with short or long score ≥ 2. G tracts with at least three Gs are shown in bold. GG tracts are underlined since they may aid G4 folding. Tracts with the potential to form a bulged G4 (i.e. GXGG, where X is any of the three remaining bases) are additionally shown in italics. The symbol^ indicates genes, the corresponding G4 sequences of which were chosen for further investigation. Rv number is the gene numeration in the considered reference strain H37Rv. a Position of the last nt of the G4 motif with respect to the TSS. Asterisks indicate that the reported G4 sequence is in the reverse strand. G4 ligand-induced stabilization was assessed by CD thermal unfolding analysis. G4 ligands were able to highly stabilize Mtb G4s with T m values in some cases higher than 90 °C (Table 3 ). In cases where several transitions were observed ( Supplementary Figures 2 and 3) , T m values for each transition were reported (Table 3) . zwf1 G4 was the most efficiently stabilized sequence with an increase of T m higher than 41.5 °C in the presence of both BRACO-19 and c-exNDI 2 ( Table 3) . G4 folding of zwf1, clpX, mosR and ndhA sequences in the absence/presence of G4 ligands was additionally tested by the Taq polymerase stop assay (Fig. 3) . This technique allowes to evaluate G4 formation in a DNA template and G4 involvement in arresting the Taq polymerase processing. This G4-specific block can be then accurately solved in a denaturing polyacrylamide gel in terms of intensity and position in the sequence. For this purpose, the zwf1, clpX, mosR and ndhA oligonucleotides were added of a primer annealing region at their 3′-end. Moreover, additional T-flanking bases at both 5′-and 3′-ends were added to separate the 3′-end of the primer and the first G of the G4 portion. Samples were incubated in the absence or presence of 100 mM KCl (Fig. 3a, lanes 1 and 2, respectively) , and with 200 nM BRACO-19 or 100 nM c-exNDI 2 (Fig. 3a, lanes 3 and 4,  respectively) . A control template unable to fold into G4 was also used to exclude unspecific inhibition of the polymerase enzyme by the G4 ligands. Taq polymerase was tested at 47 °C on all DNA templates. In the presence of all Mtb G4 templates, G4 ligands blocked enzyme processing (Fig. 3a,*, ¤,  § and # symbols in lanes 3-4) . Stop sites resulted specific and located at or just before the first 5′ G-tract involved in G4 folding (Fig. 3b) . No stop site was detected on the negative control template (Fig. 3a) . Quantitative analysis of G4 stop bands showed increased G4 formation in the presence of G4 ligands for all G4-forming sequences (Fig. 3c) . Taken together these data indicate that the tested G4 binders strongly recognize and stabilize Mtb G4 sequences. Effect of G4 ligands on Mtb growth. The effect of BRACO-19 and c-exNDI 2 on Mtb growth was analyzed using a REsazurine Microplate Assay (REMA). As shown in Fig. 4 , both compounds were able to inhibit bacterial cell growth with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC 80 ) in the micromolar range; c-exNDI 2 was 10 times more potent than BRACO-19 with an MIC 80 of 1.25 μM vs 12.5 μM. The increased potency of c-exNDI 2 may be at least in part due to its higher efficiency in stabilizing Mtb G4s (Table 3) . However, the intracellular concentration reached by these compounds under the investigated conditions is not known. Interestingly, at least for BRACO-19, the MIC 80 was lower than the toxic concentration for eukaryotic cells 20 supporting the possibility to use G4 ligands to develop new antitubercular agents.
