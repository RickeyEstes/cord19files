MCE separates the analytes based on their charge states, hydrodynamic sizes, and geometries. With minimized EOF and well-controlled operating parameters, MCE has high stability and reproducibility in the first place. More importantly, the correlation between ion elution time and ion effective size could be obtained and used to calculate the effective radius of a biomolecule in solution. To better reconstruct their 3D structures, biomolecules were assumed to have ellipsoid shapes. With this ellipsoid approximation, a restrain curve was acquired for a biomolecule, which defines its aspect ratio versus its radius. This restrain curve was then used to evaluate or estimate the occurrence probability of each conformation acquired from MD simulations. The coupling of MD simulations with MCE experiments was first demonstrated for angiotensin I in an MS friendly solvent, and its conformations with top probabilities were picked out based on this scoring methodology. This method was then applied for the analysis of a peptide mixture in which somatostatin and bradykinin in a pH neutral solution were separated and structurally analyzed. The predicted structures of bradykinin and somatostatin obtained from this method were compared with those obtained from NMR measurements. Finally, performances of the home-built MCE−MS system were characterized through the analyses of biomolecule mixtures and BSA using a typical bottom-up proteomic strategy. Ion Motion Modeling. In MCE experiments shown in Figure 1 , a constant liquid flow was used to provide a driving force in a liquid channel (fused silica capillary in this case), and an electric field was also applied to separate different ions in the liquid channel. When dissolved in solutions, peptides, proteins, and other biomolecules are typically ionized, if pH of the solution is different from their isoelectric points. These ions will have directional motions when an electric field is applied, which is known as electrophoresis. On the other hand, ions will also experience a viscous drag force (F f ) when their motion speed is different from the liquid flow. Besides the amount of charge an ion possesses, ion migration time also depends on the size and geometry of the ion. In general, ions with larger effective sizes will experience stronger viscous drag force. Therefore, ion migration time (t) in MCE could be used to calculate the ion effective radius (R). To accurately calculate the ion effective radius, ion migration in MCE needs to be precisely controlled and characterized. Mathematical models were first established to study this ion migration process. The electric field force (F e ) acting on an ion could be expressed as in which q is the amount of charge possessed by the ion, E is the separation electric field intensity, U is the dc potential applied across the separation capillary, and L is effective length of the separation capillary. Different from neutral molecules, the velocity difference between ions and liquid flow causes a viscous drag force. where v r is the relative speed of an ion, η is the viscosity coefficient of the solution, and ξ = 6πηR. Under equilibrium, F e would be equal to F f . The absolute migration speed (v absolute ) could then be expressed as v v v absolute carrier r = + (3) in which v carrier is the flow rate of the liquid flow. EOF was minimized in MCE so that liquid flow rate could be precisely controlled. To minimize any residual EOF effects on the liquid flow rate, neutral markers (phenol or DMSO) were used to accurately measure the velocity of the liquid flow. Ion displacement (S) within the separation capillary could be determined by
