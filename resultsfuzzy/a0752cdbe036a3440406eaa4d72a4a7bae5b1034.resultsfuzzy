The DNA sequence encoding the full-length SUD (residues 349-726 of Nsp3; see Fig. 1A ), also referred to as Nsp3c, was successfully expressed with an N-terminal His-tag in E. coli (not shown) and in the in-vitro RTS wheat-germ system and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1B,  lane 1) . Besides the full-length SUD, a soluble, more stable minimal version, SUDc5b, was constructed by systematic N-and C-terminal truncation and produced, with an Nterminal His-tag, in E. coli (Fig. 1B, lane 2) . The identity of the proteins was verified by N-terminal sequencing (not shown) and reaction with anti-(His) 4 and anti-Nsp3 (SARS-CoV) (Fig. 1B, lanes 3-6) . Independent of the expression system used, the fulllength SUD displayed a strong and reproducible tendency to proteolytic (self-)degradation. This was reduced but still detectable in the preparations of the SUDc5b protein. Analytical size-exclusion chromatography and dynamic light-scattering measurements indicated that SUDc5b is a monomeric protein (31 kDa) (see Figs. S2 and S3A in Supplementary Material). We were able to show that both full-length SUD and its truncated version, SUDc5b, bind single-stranded DNA and RNA. For short nucleotides (decamers), this interaction is highly specific for oligo-guanidine nucleotides. Both deoxyribo-and ribo-G 10 are bound with comparable affinities ( Fig. 2A and B) . K d values derived from zone-interference gel electrophoresis (ZIGE; [18] ) are in the low micromolar range (in case of SUDc5b, 1.0 lM for (dG) 10 and 0.93 lM for G 10 ). The binding affinity is dependent on the length of the oligo(G) nucleotide. For SUDc5b, the highest affinity was found for (dG) [12] [13] [14] (not shown). For full-length SUD, the K d value derived from ZIGE is about 2.1 lM (Fig. 2C) . A database and literature search for potential oligo(G) stretches that might be recognized by SUD within the host cell revealed interesting potential targets. Since SUD does not seem to differentiate between DNA and RNA, the availability of potential binding sites will depend on the sub-cellular localization of the protein. Oligo(dG) sequences, so called G-strings, have been identified as binding sites for transcription factors in eukaryotic cells [19, 20] . Since there is no evidence for a nuclear localization of Nsp3 in the host cell [8, 14] , we focused on potential cytosolic interaction partners. Oligo(G) sequences are found in 3 0 -UTRs of several mRNAs including the mRNA for the human pro-apoptotic protein Bbc3 (Accession No. U82987; [21] ), the transcript variant 1 of the mRNA for the human MAP kinase 1 (NM_002745), the mRNA for the human RAB6B protein, a member of the Ras oncogene family (NM_016577), and the mRNA for TAB3, a component of the NF-jB signaling pathway (NM_152787). These proteins are prime candidates for an interference of the virus with cellular signaling pathways. Changes in the stability and/or translation efficiency of these mRNAs due to the binding of a regulatory factor should result in an altered response of the infected cell to extracellular signals. (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 , and 32 lM, lanes 2-7) of (dG) 10 . Lanes labeled c5b, A, C, and T correspond to nucleic acid-free protein, mixture of SUDc5b with 16 lM of (dA) 10 , (dC) 10 , and (dT) 10 , respectively. (B) SUDc5b in presence of increasing concentrations (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and  32 lM, lanes 2-7) of ribo-G 10 . (C) Full-length SUD (f-l) in presence of increasing concentrations (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 lM, lanes 2-7) of (dG) 10 . The truncated SUDc5b binds efficiently (K d = 0.45 lM) to an oligodeoxynucleotide (named bbc3-(dG) 14 ) of 24 bases in length, with a central (dG) 14 stretch, which we used as a model for the bbc3 mRNA. The replacement of the (dG) 14 stretch by (dA) 14 leads to a dramatically reduced binding affinity (Fig. 3) . Similar results were obtained for full-length SUD (not shown). To further assess the RNA-binding affinity of SUD and SUDc5b, a radioactive RNA probe (named bbc3-G 14 ) containing 14 G bases and flanking regions (a total of 48 bases) from the bbc3 gene (nucleotides 983-1030) was transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase from a synthetic deoxynucleotide duplex template harbouring the T7 promoter [22] . As a control for the specificity of the RNA-protein interaction, an RNA probe (bbc3-A 14 ) containing an A 14 -string instead of G 14 was prepared in a similar manner. An electropho-retic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to probe the interaction between SUD proteins and RNAs. To prevent non-specific binding of radioactive RNA probes to the proteins, a 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled tRNA was added to the reaction mixtures. As can be seen from Fig. 4A , full-length SUD is able to retard the mobility of the radioactive bbc3-G 14 RNA in a concentration-dependent manner (lanes 1-4) . An anti-Nsp3 antibody that had been tested for specific interaction with SUD (see Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6) , but not an irrelevant anti-T7 RNA polymerase antibody, supershifts the migration of the SUD-RNA complex (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 and 8, respectively) , implying direct and highly specific interaction between SUD and bbc3-G 14 . Both full-length SUD (Fig. 4A, lanes 2-4 and 6) and SUDc5b (Fig. 4B, lane 1) are able to retard the electrophoretic mobility of free bbc3-G 14 RNA due to RNA-protein complex formation. In contrast, bbc3-A 14 RNA is unable to form a similar complex either with full-length SUD (Fig. 4B , lane 4) or with SUDc5b (Fig. 4B, lane 5) , thus confirming the specificity of the RNA-protein interaction. Interestingly, the appearance of an additional, extremely slow-migrating band was observed with SUDc5b and bbc3-G 14 RNA (Fig. 4B, lane 1, asterisk) , but not with bbc3-A 14 RNA (lane 5). This is possibly due to a multimerization of a specific RNA-protein complex. The ability of SUDc5b to form multimers in presence of (dG) 8 was confirmed by dynamic light-scattering (Fig. S3B) . No interaction of bovine serum albumin (BSA), included as a further control of specificity, with bbc3-G 14 RNA (Fig. 4B, lane 2) or with bbc3-A 14 RNA (Fig. 4B, lane 6 ) was detectable. The observed affinity of SUD to the G-string of bbc3 RNA (bbc3-G 14 ) is highly specific, since a 1000-fold molar excess of tRNA is not able to prevent the formation of the complex. Moreover, the exchange of G 14 to A 14 completely prevents the interaction. Other possible interaction partners for SUD are the coronaviral RNAs within the infected cells. We found three potential binding sites in the genome of the TOR2 isolate of the SARS coronavirus. A single G 6 motif (nucleotides 21,604-21,609) and two C 6 -motives (nucleotides 17,386-17,391 and 28,157-28,162) are present in the (+)-strand (Fig. S4A ). SUDc5b also binds to G 6 -containing deoxyribonucleotides derived from these regions of the viral genome, again with an estimated affinity of approximately 1 lM (Fig. S4B and C) . The binding affinity to the reversed complementary sequences representing the opposite strand of the genome is considerably lower (Fig. S4) . However, in accordance with the preferred length of the oligo(G) stretch of 12-14 nucleotides, the highest binding affinity was found for the oligonucleotides derived from the human bbc3 mRNA. As mentioned before, G [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] motifs are present in the 3 0 -UTRs of human mRNAs encoding Bbc3, MAP kinase 1, RAB6B, and TAB3 proteins, all of which are components of cellular signaling pathways. It is conceivable that binding of SUD to these RNAs will result in an alteration of their stability, or translation efficiency, as it has been demonstrated for eukaryotic trans-acting factors such as HuR, CP1, and TIA-1 [23] [24] [25] [26] , and thereby will interfere with cellular signal transduction. Bbc3 is a pro-apoptotic protein that is induced by a variety of apoptotic stimuli. It is subject to transcriptional regulation by multiple cell death-signaling pathways [21] and has been demonstrated to mediate apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells [27] . Blocking Bbc3 production at the translation level could override the transcriptional activation and render a cell less sensitive to apoptotic signals. Similarly, an interaction of SUD with the TAB3 mRNA may contribute to the recently described NF-jB activation and the increased CXCL10 (interferon cinducible protein 10) levels observed in the blood of SARS patients [28] . In addition to the spike, nucleocapsid, Orf3b, Orf6, Orf7a, and PL2 pro proteins [12, 28] , SUD could thus be another component of SARS-CoV involved in the modulation of host-cell signaling pathways.
