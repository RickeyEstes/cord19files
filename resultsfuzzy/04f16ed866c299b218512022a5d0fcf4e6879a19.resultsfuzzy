To improve enrollment of transplant-eligible individuals with sickle cell disease and improve generalizability of findings, an international team-based learning collaboration was established between centers in the United States, United Kingdom, and France 7 [30] . With a focus on haplo-HCT, the group hypothesized that nonmyeloablative conditioning with the addition of thiotepa followed by infusion of marrow allografts and PTCy-based GvHD prophylaxis regimen would reduce graft rejection and improve transplantrelated outcomes (Figure 2) . Eligibility criteria, similar to the aforementioned studies, included patients between 1 and 70 years of age with at least one criteria for severe disease, including cerebrovascular event lasting longer than 24 hours, magnetic resonance imaging evidence of strokes, recurrent acute chest syndrome or vaso-occlusive crises, repeated hospital stays, or chronic lung conditions. Included participants had a favorable performance status and must not have had a matched donor. The Phase II study was conducted by de la Fuente et al. [30] with the primary end point being 1-year event-free survival, which included primary or secondary graft rejection, stroke, or death (Table 1) . Eighteen patients with a median age of 20.9 years were included, the first three of whom received the Johns Hopkins platform, the remaining 15 received thiotepa for conditioning due to graft rejection seen in 66% (2/3) initial patients. Greater than 95% myeloid engraftment was noted after at least 6 months of followup in 93% (14/15) patients. No further graft rejection was detected. All patients were alive at study completion. GvHD rates were favorable, with 13% (2/16) acute and 6% (1/16) extensive chronic GvHD noted. In addition, preconditioning did not appear to impact transplant-related outcomes on patients who received thiotepa. Importantly, all patients were off immunosuppression by 1 year followup. The findings indicate the potential for a single dose of thiotepa to improve the efficacy of haplo-HCT based on improved engraftment.
