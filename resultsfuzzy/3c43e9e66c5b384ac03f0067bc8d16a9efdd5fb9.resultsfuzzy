We first compare our simulation results with experimental data in [11] . In experiments [11] , various human glioma cell lines (U343, U87, U87DEGFR, LN229, Gli36DEGFR-H2B-RFP, X12) and Vero cells were used in in vitro and in vivo expriments. OV-Chase is an oncolytic HSV-1-expressing bacterial Chase-ABC driven by a promoter within the backbone of rHsvQ (control). In vitro studies, in order to see the spread of rHsvQ and OV-Chase in 3-dimensional glioma spheroids on brain slices, the spheroids were infected with 10 4 pfu (plaque forming units) of rHsvQ or OV-Chase. Then, infected areas for the cases of Chase(2) and Chase(+) were calculated by both visualization and quantification of infected cells by appearance of OV-encoded GFP over time. In in vivo studies, the glioma cells implanted stereotactically at a position 2 mm lateral to bregma at a depth of 3 mm for animal studies and animals were inoculated with control (PBS) or virus in the absence or presence of Chase-ABC ten days after tumor cell implantation. Intratumoral injections of HBSS or the indicated OV was performed for the mice bearing subcutaneous tumors with the initial average volume of 80 to 150 mm 3 . Seventy-two hours after viral infection, the amount of infectious viral particles and infected areas were quantified by a standard method. Figures In order to compare the computational results with experimental data, we calculated the relative infected area using density distribution of infected tumor cells i.e., we use the infected area relative to the total area of the glioma spheroid. Figure 2U shows relative infected areas with (black) and without OV-Chase treatment. This result is in good qualitative agreement with experimental data in [11] shown in Figure 2V . The experiments in [11] and the simulations in this paper demonstrate that OVchase treatment improve the infection of virus within the tumor thus decreasing the burden of cancer mass.
