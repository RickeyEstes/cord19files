Malaria rapid testing was performed at point-of-care on 968 (96%) patients. Of these, 327 (34%) were positive for malaria, including 150 (16%) that were positive for P. falciparum, 6 (1%) that were positive for Plasmodium non-falciparum species, and 171 (18%) that were positive for both P. falciparum and non-falciparum species. Of the 327 malaria positives whereby a thick film blood smear was performed, 4 (1%) revealed no parasite found, 17 (5%) were denoted as 1+, 133 (41%) were denoted as 2+, 111 (34%) were denoted as 3+, and 62 (19%) were denoted as 4+. Diagnostic evaluations using both AFI and respiratory TAC identified 31 different viral, bacterial and parasitic agents among 457 febrile patients contributing only blood specimens and 385 febrile patients contributing both blood and NP/OP specimens. There were 226 (25.6%) patients in which we did not detect nucleic acid for any of the 57 agents surveyed (Table 3) . Multiple codetections were also observed using both TAC assays (Tables 4 and 5 ).
