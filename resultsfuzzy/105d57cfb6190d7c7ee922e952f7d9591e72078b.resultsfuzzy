(1) where K is the equilibrium constant for formula (1), K A is the association constant, and K D is the dissociation constant. [R] is the concentration of the unbound receptor immobilized on the sensor surface. [L] is the ligand concentration in the bulk solution. [RL] is the concentration of the ligand-receptor complex on the sensor surface. To estimate the dissociation constant, the Langmuir isotherm equation was usually used to extract the dissociation constant by linear regression [27] [28] [29] [30] . Here the current changes were introduced to the Langmuir equation for calculating the dissociation constant. [L] where I is the current change at the bulk concentration of ligand [L] , and I max is the saturated current change. The dissociate constant can be extracted from the linear regression by using Eq. (3), as shown in Fig. 4(a) . The extracted dissociation constant from the linear regression was obtained as 1.62 × 10 −9 M. The Langmuir equation shown in Eq. (3) can be rearranged as the following expression: The right-hand side of Eq. (4) is equal to the ratio of ligand-receptor complex concentration [RL] to the total receptor concentration [R] max . Here this ratio is defined as the surface coverage ratio ˛, as shown in Eq. (5). Here the total receptor concentration is the sum of the unbound receptor concentration and the ligand-receptor complex concentration. The equation is shown as [R] max = [R] + [RL]. Fig. 4(b) shows the curve of surface coverage ratio from Eq. (5) using the dissociation constant extracted from Fig. 4(a) and the I/ I max obtained from the experimental results shown as dots versus the ligand concentration in log scale. It is obvious that the curve of the surface coverage ratio does not match well with those experimental dots. From Eq. (5), it is shown that the surface coverage ratio actually depends on the ratio of dissociation constant to the concentration of ligand, that is K D /[L]. When K D equals 10 folds or 10% of [L], the surface coverage ratio goes to around 9.09% and 90.91%, respectively. Beyond 90.91% or below 9.09% of the surface coverage ratio, increasing or decreasing the concentration of antigen does not change the surface coverage ratio much. Therefore, we conclude that for a one-binding-site model, the most significant change of the surface coverage ratio is within the range of the ligand concentration between one order higher and one order lower than the value of the dissociation constant. This was also shown by experimental data in literature [29] . Thus, ideally once the dissociation constant is determined, the highest sensitivity for the sensor is only within this two-order range of ligand concentration. On the other hand, for any experimental result, the surface coverage ratio between 9.09% and 90.91% should only cover two orders of ligand concentration for an ideal one-binding-site model. However, in Fig. 4(b) , it is significant that between 9.09% and 90.91% of the surface coverage, the experimental data points cover more than 3 orders of the ligand concentration. Therefore, it is not possible to fit these experimental points well into the surface coverage ratio with the one-binding-site model. The wide range of the ligand concentration within that coverage ratio (9.09-90.91%) may be resulted from multiple binding sites of the receptor. Compared with Fig. 4(a) , Fig. 4(b) is clearly more sensitive to see whether the onebinding-site model can really fit into the experimental data. Thus, the surface coverage ratio versus the ligand concentration will be used for finding out the number of binding sites and the associated dissociation constants. Here a two-binding-site model is proposed as the following. In the two-binding-site model, the chemical equations are described as below, (6)  where the K D1 and K D2 are the dissociation constants for the two binding sites on a receptor. The total current change is assumed to be the sum of the current change resulted from ligand-receptor complex at site 1 and at site 2, respectively, as shown in Eqs. (8) and (9). I = ˛1 I max 1 + ˛2 I max 2 (10) where ˛1 and ˛2 are the surface coverage ratio at site 1 and site 2 of the receptor. Let the left and the right side of Eq. (10) be divided by I max , and define ˛ ≡ I/ I max , c 1 ≡ I max 1 / I max , andc 2 ≡ I max 2 / I max . The ˛ in this two binding-site model represents the overall surface coverage ratio. It is obvious that c 1 and c 2 are constants, and c 1 + c 2 = 1. Then we can get Eq. (11), as follows: Fig . 5 shows the surface coverage ratio at different N protein concentrations from the average of three measurements and the curve-fitting for a two-binding-site model. The experimental data points nicely fit into the two-binding-site model. Two dissociation constants, (K D1 = 0.0955 nM, K D2 = 51.23 nM, c 1 = 0.7506, and c 2 = 0.2494) were extracted from the two-binding-site model. The correlation coefficient r 2 is 0.988. This result suggests that there are at least two SARS-N protein-CTD binding on the dsDNA. It was not reported the dissociation constants between the dsDNA and the SARS-N protein-CTD. However, it was observed in literature [5] that both RNA and dsDNA have very strong binding with the SARS-N protein-CTD, while the ssDNA has weaker binding compared with RNA and the dsDNA. RNA aptamer was reported to have a dissociation constant as 0.8 nM when binding to the SARS-N protein-CTD [31] . There is only single dissociation constant obtained due to the extraction of the dissociation constant simply from a one-bindingsite system. The value of the dissociation constant for RNA from the literature [31] is just between our K D1 and K D2 . Since both dsDNA and RNA have strong binding affinity with the SARS-N protein-CTD, we believe that the values of our dissociation constants are in a reasonable range. In another literature, ssDNA aptamer was reported to have dissociation constant as 4.9 nM when binding to the SARS-N protein-CTD [32] . Although the sequence of the RNA aptamer and the ssDNA aptamer is different from ours, the values of the reported dissociation constants are consistent with our results. Our results are obtained based on dealing with the whole system with full spectrum of the protein concentration. Chemically, the formula for this reaction may usually be expressed as Eqs. (12) and (13) . [RL] It may be argued that whether three-binding-site model or even higher number of binding-sites should be considered. To investigate that possibility, three-binding-site model was used to fit the experimental data, and it looks like the fitting is also very nice, as shown in Appendices A and B. However, we can easily find that for the three dissociation constants extracted from the three-binding-site model, the K D2 and the K D3 are very close, and their values are almost the same as the K D2 extracted from the twobinding-site model. Needless to say, the K D1 extracted from the three-binding-site model is almost the same as the K D1 extracted from the two-binding-site model. We therefore can conclude that if two-binding-site model can be well fitted with the experimental data, it is not necessary to try with higher number of binding-site model. The methodology that we adopt in the analysis of the dissociation constants and the number of binding sites in this research mainly relies on the full range of the protein concentration, from low surface coverage to full saturation, which allows us to see the whole response for full range of the protein concentration. This is a very important key to investigate the complete information about the affinity between the protein and the dsDNA. If the sensor was only tested with a small range of the protein concentration, but not the full range until saturation, then the information about the number of binding sites and the dissociation constants extracted from the curve-fitting technique may be misled into wrong results and conclusion. We found that for some researches the range of the ligand concentration is sometimes ignored. To investigate the full range of the ligand concentration, the model that utilizes the surface coverage ratio is very successful to handle such many orders of magnitude of the ligand concentration. Therefore, the binding-site model using the surface coverage ratio together with the HEMTs becomes a simple and useful tool for the analysis of the binding affinity between the SARS-N-protein and dsDNA. In conclusions, AlGaN/GaN HEMTs immobilized with dsDNA have been used to bind SARS-N protein-CTD, and to elucidate the number of binding sites on the dsDNA and the dissociation constants. Two dissociation constants, K D1 = 0.0955 nM, K D2 = 51.23 nM, were obtained by fitting the experimental results into the two-binding-site model. The AlGaN/GaN HEMTs and the binding-site models were demonstrated to be very efficient and cheap tools to investigate the information of the number of binding sites on dsDNA for the SARS N-protein CTD and the dissociation constants which is important for studying the SARS virus genome packaging process.
