• Disease results from autonomous secretion of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyroxinine (T3). Negative feedback on the pituitary suppresses release of thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) and normal thyroid tissue atrophies. • Cause is unknown but may involve diet (iodine content, frequent changes, food additives), environmental causes (in cat litter, toxins, pollution, exposure to allergens), genetic mutation, abnormal immune and/or hormonal responses. • 70% of the cats have both thyroid glands affected. GIT signs may result from polyphagia, malabsorption or intestinal hypermotility. Polyuria/polydipsia may result from diuretic effects of T4, increased renal blood flow, associated renal insufficiency or compulsive polydipsia. Cardiac effects result from a high output state, induced, in part, by a demand for increased tissue perfusion to meet the needs of increased tissue metabolism. Cardiovascular changes include left ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial and ventricular dilation, increased myocardial contractility, and decreased peripheral vascular resistance. Other contributors are the direct effect of thyroid hormones on cardiac muscle and the nervous system. Associated cardiac hypertrophy may cause congestive heart failure with tachycardia, a gallop rhythm, systolic murmurs, dyspnea, apathy, hindlimb weakness due to aortic thromboemboli or collapse. Associated hypertension may be seen as ocular hemorrhage, or may cause clinical signs associated with cerebrovascular accidents, dementia and/or renal failure. • Up to 85% of cats with hyperthyroidism may develop systemic hypertension, either initially or even some time after apparently successful treatment. 


Section:99% of cases of hyperthyroidism result from benign nodular hyperplasia/adenoma.
Section:1% of cases result from mild to moderately malignant thyroid carcinoma.
