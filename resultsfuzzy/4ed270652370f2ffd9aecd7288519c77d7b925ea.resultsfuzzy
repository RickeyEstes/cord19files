Ultrastructure analysis reveals formation of DMVs during viral infection of E. huxleyi Infection of the noncalcifying E. huxleyi CCMP2090 (hereafter E. huxleyi) by the double-stranded DNA virus EhV201 revealed a lytic dynamic of infection whereby the host culture is lysed within 72 h postinfection (hpi; Fig. 1a ). Intracellular viral DNA accumulated in the cells before the onset of release of extracellular viruses to the media (Fig. 1b) . This host-virus temporal dynamics resembles the kinetics of infection observed in natural populations (Bratbak et al., 1993; Vardi et al., 2012) . Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of infected cells revealed compromised cells within 24 h of infection (Fig. 1c-e) . Degradation of nuclear material is apparent, as well as shrinkage of the chloroplast. These observations are in agreement with previous data whereby a reduction in photosynthetic efficiency occurs after the onset of the lytic phase, concomitant to activation of PCD-like processes mediated by caspase activity (Bidle et al., 2007; Vardi et al., 2009; Kegel et al., 2010; Kimmance et al., 2014) . Interestingly, in almost all the observed infected cells, we detected DMVs (Fig. 1d,e) . Quantification of the DMVs in the TEM images of infected and control cells revealed a significant difference in their abundance. In infected cells, we counted 2.65 AE 0.24 DMVs per cell, whereas in control cells we observed 0.3 AE 0.1 DMVs per cell (average AE SE, n = 20, P < 0.05). The presence of DMVs indicates a major redistribution of cellular membranes during infection of E. huxleyi with EhV. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of chemically fixed virions (Fig. 1f) suggested that the virion is composed of at least two, and possibly three, layers surrounding the electron-dense DNA core. We used cryotomography on unfixed virions to establish the characteristics of these layers (Fig. 1g,h) . While we cannot unequivocally determine the nature of the three layers surrounding the DNA core, the thickness of the outer two layers, c. 4.6 and 4.8 nm, suggests that they are lipid bilayers (Hollinshead et al., 1999) . These results are similar to those found in all the NCLDV-clade viruses, including two other members of the phycodnaviridae, PBCV1 and EsV1, that contain membranes internal to the capsid (Van Etten et al., 2002) , and emphasize the substantial requirement for membranes during infection, the source of which is not known. The observed DMVs suggest the occurrence of membrane redistribution during infection, which may provide a source for the massive requirement of viral membranes.
