Of all samples tested for non-pneumococcal organisms, only 1 paired sera (from a patient with pneumonia and positive nasopharyngeal culture for Sp5) was positive for M. pneumoniae (Table 1) . Seroconversion to C. pneumoniae occurred in 1/11 paired sera, and another sample taken two weeks following the illness (from a patient with pneumonia and positive nasopharyngeal culture for Sp5 for whom an early sera testing was not available) yielded a high antibody titer for C. pneumoniae. S. pneumoniae was isolated from 4 of the pneumonia cases (two blood cultures, two endotracheal cultures). All were Sp5. One additional, partially treated pneumonia case, had gram-positive diplococci in sputum gram staining, but the organism did not grow in culture. S. pneumoniae was isolated from 55/124 (44.35%) sampled controls (Table 1 ). An additional 3/18 staff members tested were positive for S. pneumoniae. Of the 58 positive samples, 49 (84.5%) were positive in nasopharyngeal cultures. In 9 cases, only oropharyngeal culture was positive. All 58 S. pneumoniae isolates from controls were serotyped: 35 (60.3%) were Sp5. The other 19 isolates belonged to 10 different serotypes: 23F (4), 15B/C (4), 10B (3), 35B (2), and one of each 3, 6B, 9V, 16F, 17F and 18F. The remain- ing 4 isolates were non-typable. Of the 52 isolates recovered from contacts, 27 (51.9%) were Sp5. All Sp5 isolates were susceptible to penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol; 4 Sp5 isolates from carriers were nonsusceptible to TMP/SMX. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was performed on all Sp5 isolates and all showed an identical pattern (Fig. 2) . We compared PFGE of Sp5 from the current outbreak to those among Sp5 from children in southern Israel during 2004-2006. A total of 24 isolates from nasopharynx (n = 9), middle ear fluid (n = 9) and blood (n = 6) were available. All 24 isolates belonged to the same clonal type as the outbreak strain, but only 5/24 had a pattern fully identical to the outbreak strain (Fig. 3) . Multilocus sequence typing of one representative blood Sp5 isolate from a pneumonia case, showed an allelic profile identical to the Colombia 5 -19 clone (ST-289, according to http://www.mlst.net).
