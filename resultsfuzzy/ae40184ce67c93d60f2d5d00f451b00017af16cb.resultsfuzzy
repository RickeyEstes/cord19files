No clinical sign was observed during the experiment and the daily weight gain (DWG) was similar in challenged groups (Figure 1 , R1 to R4), control pigs (R5) and in individuals from the contact groups (data not shown). No resistant E. coli was isolated either before inoculation of pigs in the contact groups or in the negative control group throughout the entire experiment. All animals in the inoculated control group had positive resistant bacterial counts on the contact-day (D 0 ) after which these counts declined steadily from D 1 to the end of the experiment (D 10 ) ( Figure 2 ). All inoculated pigs in the contact groups had positive resistant bacterial counts on D 0 , i.e. one day after their first inoculation. Individual bacterial counts in inoculated pigs increased until day 1 post-contact, ranging between 4.66 and 8.96 log 10 (CFU/g). The bacterial counts of the inoculated pigs then decreased over a period of 3 to 5 days. An inverse trend, with an increase in bacterial counts, was observed in 13 of the 23 inoculated pigs between day 4 and day 10 post-contact. This was probably due to the infectious pressure exerted by contaminated contact pigs as such a tendency was not observed in the inoculated control group. A similar pattern was observed in the contact groups with a lag of 1 to 2 days. Nineteen out of 28 contact pigs had positive bacterial counts on day 1 post-contact and all pigs in the contact groups were found positive on day 2 post-contact. An overall decrease in bacterial counts was observed until the 6 th day post-contact. Similar transmission behaviours were observed in all the pens. No significant difference was found in individual bacterial counts according to the number of pigs per pen (5 and 2 trials involving 3 or 4 inoculated pigs respectively, in contact with 4 na√Øve pigs) either in inoculated or in contact pigs ( Table 1) . Equivalent bacterial counts were recorded on days 8 and 10 post-contact in both the inoculated and contact groups (p = 0.66) (Figure 2 ). During the experiment, the resistant bacterial counts in at least one sample from 12 contact and 8 inoculated pigs was below the detection limit of the method, but the resistant strain could not be detected on D 10 in only three pigs. All but 5 inoculated pigs (18/23) had bacterial counts over 10 6 CFU/g on D 0 and D 1 . Only 7 of these high-shedders still showed high shedding levels on day 2 post-contact. The moderate shedding level, between 10 5 and 10 6 CFU/g, was found to be a transient phase between low-and high-shedding.
