Cell cycle arrest induced by PCV2 infection occurred in G0/G1 phase depends upon viral replication. Research evidence has shown that activation of p53 involved PCV2-induced apoptotic response 31 , thus, we want to determine whether PCV2 infection of PK15 cells regulated cell cycle progression. Synchronized PK15 cells maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing no serum for 48 h were infected with PCV2 strain BJW 36 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 50% tissue culture infective dose units (TCID 50 ) per cell and incubated with MEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). At the indicated time points postinfection, nuclear DNA content was measured using propidium iodide (PI) staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A , we observed an obvious accumulation of cells in G0/G1 phase in the synchronized PCV2-infected cells at 18 and 24 h postinfection. To examine whether cell cycle arrest induced by PCV2 is associated with virus replication, we used an UV light-irradiated PCV2 (equivalent to an MOI of 1) to infect synchronized cells. The G0/G1 cell cycle arrest was not detectable in cells infected with UV-treated PCV2 or in mock-infected cells (Fig. 1B) . The histograms were further analyzed quantitatively by a curve-fitting program to determine the percentage of cells in each of the G0/G1, S, and G2/M phase (Fig. 1C) . Higher percentages of PCV2-infected cells were in the G0/G1 phase at 18 and 24 h postinfection, at which time about 10 and 55% larger G0/G1-phase populations were present in the PCV2-infected cells than in the mock-infected cells, respectively. The cell population in G0/G1 phase after infection with UV-treated PCV2 decreased significantly as compared with that in the PCV2-infected cells, but which is comparable to that in mock-infected cells (Fig. 1C) . Together, these data suggest that PCV2 is capable of inducing a G0/G1 phase arrest in the infected cells dependent upon virus replication. Involvement of key molecules in regulating PCV2-induced cell cycle arrest. Many host molecules participate in regulation of the G1/S transition, such as cyclin-Cdk complexes, pRb, and CKI molecules 43 . In order to further confirm the key molecules responsible for PCV2-induced cell cycle arrest, synchronized PCV2-infected cells were assayed for expression of several host G1/S transition proteins by Western blotting at 18 and 24 h postinfection. As shown in Fig. 2A , there were decreases of cyclins D1 and E in the PCV2-infected cells as compared to mock-infected cells. In contrast, no significant difference was observed in the amounts of p21 between mock-infected and PCV2-infected cells at the indicated time points postinfection ( Fig. 2A) , indicating that PCV2-induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest did not involve the activation of p21, as observed for murine coronavirus 22 . As a downstream target of cyclins D1 and E, the level of phosphorylated retinoblastoma (p-Rb) was significantly reduced after infection ( Fig. 2A) . Densitometric analysis further confirmed that the amounts of cyclins D1 and E, as well as p-Rb were markedly smaller in the PCV2-infected cells than in mock-infected cells at 18 and 24 h postinfection (Fig. 2B) . These results indicate that PCV2 infection limited the expression of cyclins D1 and E followed by inhibiting Rb phosphorylation, and in turn leading to a block in the G0/G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. Similar observations were reported in other viruses, such as measles virus 44 27 , and MNV 30 . This indicated that a reduction in the amounts of G1 cyclins may be a common mechanism by which some viruses including PCV2 block G1 cell cycle progression. shown that many viruses are capable of exploiting G0/G1 cell cycle arrest for their efficient replication 22, 27, 30 . To investigate whether the cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase induced by PCV2 infection was advantageous for virus replication, total lysates from synchronized or non-synchronized PCV2-infected cells were harvested individually at 24 h postinfection. The non-synchronized cells were maintained in normal MEM containing serum. As shown in Fig. 3A , the expression level of viral ORF2 protein in total cell lysates from synchronized cells was higher than that in non-synchronized cells as determined by Western blotting and further densitometric analysis. In order to determine whether the increase in viral protein expression would facilitate progeny virus production, supernatants from infected cells were examined for virus production by an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). As expected, more PCV2-positive signals were seen in the synchronized cells as compared to the non-synchronized cells (data not shown). Evaluation of PCV2-positive cells showed that PCV2 virus production was increased by about 23% after synchronization treatment (Fig. 3B ). This is consistent with the pattern of viral protein expression levels (Fig. 3A) . The results indicated that PCV2 can exploit the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle for its own growth. miR-15a was upregulated in PCV2-infected cells. The above results indicated that the G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in PCV2-infected cells was mediated by decrease of cyclins D1 and E. Research data has shown that miR-15a/16 family share many common targets including cyclins D1 and E, regulating the G0/G1 cell cycle progression 36, 37 . This prompted us to analyse whether these two host miRNAs are co-regulated after PCV2 infection and they involved G0/G1 cell cycle arrest induced by PCV2 replication. Thus, we determined the expression levels of both miRNAs in the synchronized PCV2-infected PK15 cells by real-time RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 4 , significant upregulation of miRNA-15a (3.7 folds) was observed in the synchronized cells at 24 h postinfection as compared to that in mock-infected cells. In contrast, miR-16 expression levels were not obviously changed after PCV2 infection, comparable to that in mock-infected cells (Fig. 4) . miR-21 and miR-34a have been also shown to regulate the cell cycle progression by targeting relevant G1-to-S transit proteins. Therefore, we further determined the expression levels of miR-21 and miR-34a in the synchronized PCV2-infected PK15 cells and found that no obvious changes were observed as compared to that in the mock-infected cells (Fig. 4) . These results demonstrated that PCV2 infection mediated upregulation of only miR-15a expression, which prompted us to speculate that miR-15a may involve in PCV2-induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest.
