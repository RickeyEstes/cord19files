In unmanipulated and sham-injected (uninfected) C57BL/6 mice (H-2 b) only low levels of MHC class I were identified in restricted brain regions. Specifically, faint immunostaining of cell surfaces for D b was seen in choroid plexus, meninges and blood vessel walls but not on neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes or microglia. No inflammatory infiltrates or immunostaining for LCMV antigens were found in the brains of control animals. Mice infected acutely by i.c. inoculation with LCMV showed dense inflammatory infiltrates of the meninges ( Fig. 1A and C) . Inflammatory cells were also seen along the ependymal lining of the ventricles and around the choroid plexus. The brain parenchyma showed no obvious abnormalities. Viral antigens were identified in the choroid plexus, the meninges, the ependymal epithelium and in some of the inflammatory cells that infiltrated these structures (Fig.  1B) . These findings are all consistent with previous observations (Gilden et al., 1972; Walker et al., 1975; Doyle and Oldstone, 1978) . Immunostaining for D b in the acute infection revealed a substantial increase in the expression of MHC class I over control levels in specific sites. Intense O b expression was found in choroid plexus, meninges and ventricular ependyma as well as on the cells that comprised the inflammatory infiltrates whereas no increase in MHC class I expression was found within the brain parenchyma ( Fig. IC and D) . In some areas a close topologic overlap was documented between the expression of viral antigens and host MHC class I molecules in adjacent sections ( Fig. 1B  and D) . Total body irradiation prevented the marked increase in MHC class I expression, the neurologic illness and the inflammatory infiltrates that were seen in acutely infected immunocompetent mice whereas the amount of viral antigen in irradiated and non-irradiated mice was similar (Table 1 ). This suggests that the upmodulation of MHC class I by acutely infected host cells is induced primarily by the cellular immune response rather than directly by the LCMV infection itself. It is tempting to speculate that the increased MHC class I expression is mediated by cytokines released from infiltrating immune cells. The increased expression of MHC molecules by acutely infected cells would be expected to enhance their interaction with immune cells and may contribute to the immunopathology. In brains of mice persistently infected with LCMV no inflammatory cells were found despite the presence of LCMV antigens in most brain regions. Consistent with previous observations (Buchmeier et al., 1980; Rodriguez et al., 1983) LCMV antigens were seen primarily in cells with neuronal morphology. In some cases LCMV antigen was also found in cells of the choroid plexus and the ventricular ependyma confirming earlier results (Gilden et al., 1972; Lampert and Oldstone, 1974; Fazakerley et al., 1991) . In contrast to the acute infection, in which LCMV antigens co-localized with upmodulation of D b, the presence of LCMV antigens was not accompanied by focal increases in the expression of host MHC class I molecules ( Fig. 1E and F) . LCMV can be cleared from the brain parenchyma of persistently infected mice by adoptive transfer of LCMV-specific CTL from immunocompetent H-2 matched donors (Oldstone et al., 1986) . However, this clearance is not accompanied by inflammatory infiltrates and there is no evidence that LCMV-infected neurons can be lysed by LCMV-specific CTL in vivo (Klavinskis et al., 1989; Joly et al., 1991) . In vitro LCMV-infected neuronal cells can be lysed by LCMV-specific CTL but only after treatment with interferon-y or following expression of exogenous MHC class I . Our current results suggest that LCMV infection by itself does not induce detectable MHC class I expression on neuronal cells in vivo. Why LCMV-infected neurons fail to express MHC class I molecules in vivo is unclear. While activated T cells are able to traverse the blood-brain barrier (Wekerle et al., 1986 (Wekerle et al., , 1987 they may not be able to interact with infected neurons in sufficient numbers because of the relatively sheltered location of neurons within the neuropil. It is also possible that other brain cells, such as astrocytes, produce factors that interfere with MHC induction on neurons. Further, differentiated neurons in vivo may be inherently unable to express MHC class I at significant levels as suggested by recent studies on cultured neuronal cells . This may provide a selective advantage by excluding these irreplaceable cells from destruction by CTL. The escape of neurons from CTL surveillance would, however, also allow non-lyric viruses to persist in neurons over the animal's life span. Results reflect immunocytochemical findings in brain sections from 3-month-old female C57BL/6 mice (n = 4/group for Nos. 1-3; n-3/group for No. 4). (+) Dense immunostaining by peroxidase reaction (see brown labeling in Fig. 1B-E) . (-) No immunostaining above background levels (see Fig. 1A and F). Groups 1-3 were acutely inoculated as adults whereas group 4 was persistently infected at birth. Mice were killed for histologic analysis 7 days after the acute i.c. inoculations. At this time all mice in group 1 were ill, whereas all the other mice appeared normal.
