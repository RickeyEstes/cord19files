Chemistry. The dihydrorugosaflavonoid moiety has three rings A, B, and C ( Figure 1 ). 30, 31 All of the synthesized compounds have dissimilarities in ring B. The ring A has a hydroxyl group at the 7 th position and an ester group at the 5th position. Rest of the changes are only in ring B with differently substituted benzene. They were obtained during the synthesis of analogues of rugosaflavonoid (6a−f) as an intermediate before the synthesis of the final product (Scheme 1). 31 As per Gaspar et al., 27 flavonoids are still a valid scaffold in medicinal chemistry. Recently, Lani et al. have published the antiviral potential of baicalein and fisetin against CHIKV. 34 These compounds possessed the same backbone, so it was pertinent to check their inhibitory potential for CHIKV. Recently, the synthesis of these compounds has been reported by our group. 30 All of the spectral data have been provided in the Supporting Information (Supporting Information File 1). In Silico Studies. Molecular Docking of nsP3 with Halogenated Dihydrorugosaflavonoids. The nsP3 has three key domains, a central zinc-binding region, a very conserved Nterminal macrodomain, and a poorly conserved, not properly structured acidic and highly phosphorylated C-terminal domain. The functions of various cellular proteins to influence signaling, stress granule assembly, and viral replication are controlled by the C-terminal domain. 35, 36 The exact role of the central zinc-binding region and N-terminal macrodomain is not well categorized. Macrodomains are known to have a conserved protein fold detected from archaea to higher eukaryotes considered for their affinity to the small molecule ADP-ribose and its analogues. In positive-strand RNA viruses such as alphaviruses, coronaviruses, and hepatitis E virus, the macrodomains are the integral part of the nsPs. 37−46 According to Rungrotmongkol et al., 47 the molecular understanding of the particular binding of ADP-ribose to the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain revealed that nsP3 amino acids Asp 10, Ile 11, Asn 24, Asp 31, Gly 32, Val 33, Cys 34, Ser 110−Tyr 114, Val 133, and Arg 144 act as the critical residues in the binding pocket, which make molecular contacts with the ligand. Also, the ribose and diphosphate units of the ADP-ribose were found to play a significant role in making molecular contacts with the amino acid residues of nsP3 in the CHIKV nsP3− ADP-ribose complex (Figure 2a,b) . The chloro derivative of dihydrorugosaflavonoid (5c) showed interaction of halogen with Arg 144 (Figure 2c ). The carbonyl oxygen of ring C formed hydrogen bonds with Ser 110, Thr 111, and Gly 112. Asp 10 and Ile 11 are also nearby. Val 33 interacted with ring oxygen. 5c also showed bonding with Leu 109. Thr 114 interacted with the carboxylate group attached with ring A. All of these amino acid residues of the binding pocket are critical and are also active in the binding of nsp3 macrodomain with ADP-ribose ( Table 2) . The bromo derivative of rugosaflavonoid (5d) showed binding in the potential site pocket of the nsp3 macrodomain and showed interactions with Asn 24, Gly 112, and Asp 31 ( Figure 2d ). The docking scores of 5c and 5d were found to be −7.54 and −6.86 kcal mol −1 , respectively (Table 1) . These effective binding interactions ( Table 2 ) indicate that these compounds may interfere with the function of nsP3 macrodomain and thus inhibit the replication of CHIKV. Therefore, to evaluate the inhibitory potential of halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids against CHIKV, the antiviral assays were performed using Vero cell lines by observing the cytopathic effect (CPE), plaque reduction assay, the quantification of the viral genome RNA by qRT-PCR, and using immunofluorescence imaging. ADME/T Analysis. In the process of drug discovery development, various rules were considered but suffered various limitations. 48 Therefore, a combination of pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK), which explains the interaction of an organism with the drug, is important to be studied. PD evaluates what the drug does to the body, and PK explains how body responds to the drug. The main components of PK are absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), finally associated with toxicity (ADMET). Although ADME properties explain the utmost pharmacological performance of small molecules, the toxicology study ensures no injury to the organism with no side effects. According to Hodgson, "A chemical cannot be a drug, no matter how active nor how specific its action, unless it is also taken appropriately into the body (absorption), distributed to the right parts of the body, metabolized in a way that does not instantly remove its activity, and eliminated in a suitable mannera drug must get in, move about, hang around, and then get out". 49 Haplessly, to address all of these parameters is time-consuming and cumbersome due to the intricacy of human body, where all of these parameters affect each other. It has not only limitations to interactions within the body but also several restrictions due to gender, age, genetic state, disease, etc. In this case, in silico technologies can be helpful to compute these calculations based on the mathematical algorithm used in the in silico software. Although it does not give full guaranty that it is going to work 100% in the living system, it saves our time in the selection of molecule to be considered for further studies. Therefore, ADME/T properties were studied using Qikprop software of Maestro. In Table 3 , 31 values of parameters such as QP log Po/w, QP log HERG, QPP Caco, QP log BB, QPP MDCK, QP log Kp, QP log K hsa , and percentage of human oral absorption are shown for compounds 5a−f. QP log Po/w reports the expected octanol/water partition coefficient. Its range should be −2 to 6.5. The values for 5a−f obtained were between 2.2 and 2.7. QP log HERG predicts IC 50 values for the blockage of HERG K+ channels. Its defined range is above gives an idea about the apparent Caco-2 cell permeability in nm s −1 . The Caco-2 cell is a model for the gut−blood barrier. Below 25, it is considered as poor, and above 500, it is considered as significantly good. Its computational values for compounds 5a−f were found to be between 318 and 411, which are not great but not poor also. QP log BB calculates the brain−blood partition coefficient. Its acceptable range is −3 to 1.2. The compounds (5a−f) under study showed these values from −1.13 to −0.76. QPP MDCK predicts apparent MDCK cell permeability in nm s −1 /MDCK cell, which is identified to be a good imitator for the blood−brain barrier. Its acceptable range is 25−500. Its values for dihydrorugosaflavonoids (5a−f) were obtained between 150 and 465. QP log KP predicts the skin permeability. Its acceptable range is −8 to −1.0. For compounds 5a−f, its values were obtained between −2.9 and −2.1. QP log K hsa predicts affinity toward human serum albumin. Its tolerable limit is −1.5 to 1.5. For compounds 5a−f, its values ranged between 0.68 and 0.207. It is mentioned that the percentage of human oral absorption range of 25% is weak and 80% is significant. For compounds 5a−f, these values were obtained between 88.32 and 90.67. These results support that the compounds have all of the values in the acceptable range. Antiviral Studies. Cell Cytotoxicity Testing. The tetrazolium-based cell viability assay was conducted to investigate and detect the maximum nontoxic dose (MNTD) for both the compounds 5c and 5d. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay is dependent on the reaction of water-soluble compound (MTT) with an insoluble formazan product by viable cells with active metabolic activity. Thus, the color produced due to the formation of formazan is a suitable marker of only viable cells. Different concentrations of the 5c and 5d compounds were assessed by MTT assay at 24 h. Both compounds did not display toxicity up to 85 μM as >70% of Vero cells were viable (Figure 3a,b) . Half-maximal cytotoxicity (CC 50 ) was calculated from the plotted graph and represented as a dotted line. So, all of the antiviral assays were performed using 30−70 μM concentration of both the compounds. Assessment of Antiviral Activity via Cytopathic Effect. After evaluation of MNTD for both the compounds, the different non-cytotoxic concentrations of 5c and 5d compounds were screened on virus-infected Vero cells to find out the possible effects of the compounds. Viral-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) assay was evaluated at 48 hpi (Supporting Information File 1). The compounds 5c and 5d exhibited a significant reduction of CHIKV-induced CPE at less than 70 μM concentration. Plaque Reduction Assay. The reduction in the CHIKV infectivity in the presence of 5c and 5d compounds was assessed by plaque reduction assay. In the case of 5ccompound-treated CHIKV, virus inhibition was observed Dihydrorugosaflavonoids; QP log Po/w: predicted octanol/water partition coefficient (acceptable range: −2.0−6.5); QP log HERG: predicted IC 50 value for blockage of HERG K+ channels (acceptable range: above-5.0); QPP Caco: predicted apparent Caco-2 cell permeability in nm s −1 (Caco-2 cell is a model for the gut−blood barrier) (in nm s −1 ) (<25, poor; >500, great); QP log BB: predicted brain/blood partition coefficient (−3 to 1.2); QPP MDCK: predicted apparent MDCK cell permeability (in nm s −1 ) (<25, poor; >500, great) (MDCK cells are considered to be a good mimic for the blood−brain barrier); QP log KP: predicted skin permeability (−8 to −1.0); QP log K hsa : prediction of binding to human serum albumin (acceptable range: −1.5 to 1.5); percentage of human oral absorption (<25% is poor and >80% is high). nearly up to 95% at 70 μM, 88% at 50 μM, and 80% at 30 μM concentration, while 5d-treated-CHIKV showed 92% at 70 μM, 86% at 50 μM, and 84% at 30 μM, as compared to control ( Figure 3 ). Other compounds (5a, 5b, 5e, and 5f) did not show inhibition of CHIKV. The effective concentration (EC 50 ) of 5c and 5d was determined from antiviral curves. The EC 50 of 5c compound was 26.14 μM (Figure 4a ) with a selectivity index (CC 50 / EC 50 ) of 4.33 (CC 50 = 113.4 μM (Figure 3a) ). The EC 50 of 5d compound was 28.39 μM (Figure 4b ; selectivity index = 4.19; CC 50 = 119 μM (Figure 3b) ). The reported EC 50 values are the means of two experiments, which are performed in triplicates. It clearly shows that 4′-halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids (5c and 5d) possess better inhibitory potential than other substituted dihydrorugosaflavonoid compounds for CHIKV. Quantitative Real-Time PCR. Conventional RT-PCR methods are still one of the reliable diagnostic methods for studying viral load in supernatants and clinical samples. Here, qRT-PCR was used for validating the antiviral effect of 5c and 5d by quantifying CHIKV RNA levels in the infected cells. The reduction in the viral RNA level was observed when treated with 5c and 5d compounds at 24 hpi. The CHIKV RNA levels upon treatment with 70 and 50 μM 5c were reduced to closely 95 and 90%, respectively, whereas in case of 5d, with 70 and 50 μM, the RNA levels of CHIKV were reduced to ∼ 93 and 91%, respectively ( Figure 5 ). Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA). Immunofluorescence staining allows rapid diagnosis of viral antigen in the infected cell using monoclonal antibodies against the virus-specific antigen. One of the two envelope glycoproteins present in the chikungunya virus named E2 glycoprotein has been used as the viral antigen in this study for virus detection by IFA. Here, CHIKV at an MOI of 1 was propagated in Vero cells for 36 h with 5c and 5d compounds at 70 and 50 μM concentrations. IFA measured detection of the intracellular virus with an envelope-specific monoclonal antibody (E2 mAb). Additionally, no E2-expression was visualized in a negative control sample, while CHIKV-infected cells were positive for E2expression. Figure 6 clearly shows that both 5c and 5d compounds inhibited CHIKV at 70 and 50 μM concentrations. Due to nonavailability of an antiviral drug or vaccine against CHIKV, various approaches have been considered all over the world to identify the lead molecules restricting CHIKV infection or replication. In this piece of work, molecular docking of dihydrorugosaflavonoids with nsP3 showed their interaction with the key residues of nsP3 that bind ADP, which supports the possibility and indicates that these compounds are potential antivirals for CHIKV. This is confirmed in this study by performing various antiviral assays. The CPE and plaque reduction assay displayed that compounds 5c and 5d potentially inhibit CHIKV infection. Further, qRT-PCR assay results clearly show the potential of these two compounds in the suppression of viral RNA levels in infected cells. Furthermore, the antiviral activity of dihydrorugosaflavonoids toward CHIKV is also well delivered by IFA.
