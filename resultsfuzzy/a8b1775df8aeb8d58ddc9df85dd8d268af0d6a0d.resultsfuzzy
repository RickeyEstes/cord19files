3.1. Cloning, expression and purification of ferret recombinant IL-2 Ferret recombinant IL-2 containing a C-terminal hexahistidine tag, assembled in the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS, was successfully expressed in mammalian HEK 293F cells using transient transfection. The protein was purified from culture supernatant using IMAC, and the peak fraction chromatographed over a Superdex 75 gel filtration column under conditions to minimise endotoxin contamination. Three peaks were observed eluting from this column; peak 1 migrated at the column void volume (>80 kDa) and contained mainly high molecular weight host cell proteins that co-purified with multimeric ferret IL-2 during IMAC; peaks 2 and 3 migrated with apparent molecular weights of~50 kDa and~30 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1) . SDS-PAGE analysis of these peaks identified peak 2 as a covalently-associated homo-dimer of ferret IL-2, and peak 3 was monomeric ferret IL-2 which was confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing, with 10 cycles giving the expected sequence of APTTSSSTK (data not shown). Under reducing conditions, monomeric ferret IL-2 migrated as a broad band adjacent to the 14 kDa molecular weight standard, consistent with a theoretical molecular weight of 16,056 Da for the His-tagged recombinant protein following removal of the signal peptide. While peak 3 (monomer) appeared homogeneous when analysed under reducing conditions (a trace of contaminating disulphide-linked dimer is seen under non-reducing conditions), additional nonspecific, higher molecular weight protein was observed in peak 2 (dimer) in addition to IL-2 (Fig. 1) . A total of 37 mg of monomeric ferret IL-2 was purified to homogeneity from a 1.6 L transient HEK 293F culture. The protein was assessed as >98% pure by SDS-PAGE analysis and had minimal endotoxin contamination (1.90 endotoxin units/mg IL-2).
