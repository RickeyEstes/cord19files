Results were determined using a "workbook" (computational algorithm) in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) designed to convert the raw data produced by the Raider or the Jaguar to the final output format. Data were analyzed, and the tests were scored based on the amplification curves and melt profiles of the sample. Samples were considered positive if the FAM Ct value was Յ40, the amplification curve shape was appropriate, and the FAM melt profiles yielded a melting temperature (Tm) Ϯ2°C of those expected for RSV (74°C), Flu B (68°C), or Flu A (63°C) ( Figure 1A ). Samples were considered indeterminate if the FAM Ct value was Ͼ40.0 with an appropriate FAM Tm and amplification curve shape; indeterminate samples were repeated once. Samples were considered negative if the internal control (MS2) was positive (Tm of 73°C in the AP-593 channel) ( Figure  1B ) and the FAM Ct value was Ͼ40.0 with an incorrect or nonexistent Tm or an abnormal amplification curve.
