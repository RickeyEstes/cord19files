3.1. DNA amplification by PCR device Fig. 2 shows the operation of HA-RTC PCR device with the aforementioned stable and uniform temperature distribution. Preliminary experimentation employing the RTC microheater was performed. PCR efficiency is affected by interactions between the device surface, and the biomolecules in the PCR solution (including mineral oil of identical temperature for the sample as a reaction mixing overlay). Due to the mechanism of surface structures on PCR device, suitable surface treatment is required to ensure the success of PCR on-chip device for DNA amplification (Gong et al., 2006) . Considering that the increased heat transfer on the device can facilitate thermal equilibrium, the reaction time could further be reduced. Due to the hydrophobicity of the spin- coated graphene thin film, the PCR reagent has a large contact angle (CA) and height, as shown in Fig. 2a. Fig. 2b shows the hydrophilic surface of a graphene electrode having a hole arrays structure, the lower droplet height and CA enabling more heat flux and thermal conductivity during heating, thereby improving thermal efficiency. (Crafton and Black, 2004; Wu et al., 2016; Hänichen et al., 2019) . In this study, the spin-coated graphene with the CA of 110 ± 1°was measured that thin-film device surface (Fig. 2a) was hydrophobic, as shown in Fig. 2c . After forming the graphene electrodes with hole arrays structures (Fig. 2b) , the structure property of PS-laser-ablated surface on thin-film device can be the hydrophilic surface where CA was 44 ± 1°, as shown in Fig. 2d . These binary structures of the holearray patterns and the MLG sheets have demonstrated the wetting characteristics of the material surface, which can indicate that HA-RTC PCR device has wettability gradient surface Ngo and Chun, 2017) . PS-laser ablated patterns of hydrophilic surface permitted wettability modification of a hydrophobic surface (graphene layer). The ablated surface can generate the required surface tension gradient for the design of PCR device for DNA amplification. The temperature monitoring and microheater inside the PCR device along a programmable controller were used to form a temperature control module, which can perform the precise on-chip platform of PCR thermal cycling. Finally, the detecting gene for BKV was amplified and detected.
