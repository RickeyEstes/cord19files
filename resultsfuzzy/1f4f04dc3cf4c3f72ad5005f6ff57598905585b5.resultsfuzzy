After assembling and mapping sequenced reads, we obtained 19 complete genome sequences, of which GDS10 had a closest relationship with CO13 on phylogenetic tree and were deposited in GenBank (accession no. MH107321). GDS10 was isolated in Guangdong Province in 16 Jun 2013. The full genome length of GDS10 is 28,041 bp (excluding the poly-A tail). The S protein of GDS10 is 1 aa longer than that of CO13, which is the first reported sequence after PEDV being confirmed in the USA in April 2013 (Marthaler et al., 2013) . Asp aa is inserted into S protein at the site of 232. GDS10 strain shares 99.9% sequence identity with CO13. GDS10 strain shares 100% aa identity with CO13 in E, M, N and ORF3 proteins, 99.9% in ORF1ab protein, and 99.5% in S protein. Phylogenetic tree based on the whole genome of GDS10, US PEDV strains, and all available strains obtained prior to the early of 2013 indicated that all PEDV strains could be divided into genogroup G1a, G1b, G2a, and G2b. All US strains clustered into 2 branches of G2a clade. 6 strains were the initial US strains and 3 strains contained insertions and deletion in the spike gene (S INDEL). These may be multiple PEDV strains being introduced into USA at the same or similar time. GDS10 clusters with the initial US strains more closely than AH2012 (Fig. 1) , providing evidence of a common ancestor. Divergence of coronaviruses is driven by genetic recombination (Hu et al., 2017) . To accurately determine how the US strains are related to GDS10, we performed a recombination analysis with representative strains of different subtypes. Bootscan analysis suggested PEDV strains of G2a genotype were possibly conductive to diversifying new USA strains during the continuous progress of PEDV by potential reconstruction events while other subgroups were barely involved. As shown in Fig. 2 , GDS10 and AH2012 recombined with CO13 in partial ORF1ab, 3â€² half of S, ORF3, E, M and N, in partial ORF1ab, respectively. In conclusion, we report the preliminary data on the phylogenetic and recombinant analyses of PEDV strain GDS10 with CO13 strain. GDS10 strain was more closely related to CO13 than AH2012, denoting GDS10 and CO13 shared a common ancestor. The determination of source of the emergent strains would help to explain the way by which the viruses could have been accessible to and infected USA pigs.
