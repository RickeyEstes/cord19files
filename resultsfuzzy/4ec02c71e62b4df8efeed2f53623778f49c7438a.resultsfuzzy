To validate the stability of the vaccine-MHC complexes molecular dynamics was performed. For this purpose, the high ranked complexes Table 3 Results of T-cell epitope prediction. The labled sequences with (*) are shared Tcell epitopes between MHC-I and II risterected epitopes. The share epitopes with high affinity to more MHC-I and MHC-II alleles were screened for further evaluation. A total number of 44 and 47 MHC-I restricted epitopes were predicted for Gc and Gn respectively which among them 12 and 13 shared epitopes were selected for further evaluation. MHC LGCPKIPLL formed by PatchDock were subjected to MD simulation. As the first step, energy values, pressure, temperature, volume and density of the system were checked at the equilibration steps and the end of the simulation. The results revealed that MD simulation steps were performed appropriately. The backbone RMSD of the vaccine-MHC complexes are depicted in Fig. 8 . The results demonstrated that in both studied complexes after a gradual increase in backbone RMSD until the 6th ns the systems almost reached steady state. In fact, the protein vaccine and MHC molecules try to get the best conformation relative to each other during the MD simulation. Radius of gyration is an important indicator of protein compactness and stability. Therefore, the R g values of the vaccine-MHC alleles were monitored during MD stimulations (Fig. 9) . The results showed that the R g values of both the vaccine-MHC-I and MHC-II complexes decreased significantly after three and four ns respectively, which indicated the complexes gained more compactness and stability during MD simulations. In other words, this trend revealed suitable interactions between our proposed vaccine and MHC alleles.
