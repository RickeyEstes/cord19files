Our results confirm that it is possible to rapidly identify potential etiologic organisms. The results of the FilmArray were available within a mean of 1.8 hours, urine antigens in 5-7 hours, and our laboratorygenerated standard PCR respiratory virus panel, and PCRs for S. aureus and S. pneumoniae within 12-30 hours. As treating physicians remain skeptical and providers express worry that there might be a concomitant bacterial infection, we added at least 1 serum PCT level. A large number of European and now study groups in the United States confirm that pure viral infections do not result in elevated PCT levels (Becker et al., 2008; Falsey et al., 2012; Gilbert, 2011; Schuetz et al., 2012 Schuetz et al., , 2013 . The serum levels of PCT increase with invasive bacterial infection or a combined bacterial-viral infection. Further, the short 2-hour turnaround time for PCT levels should assist in early treatment decisions.
