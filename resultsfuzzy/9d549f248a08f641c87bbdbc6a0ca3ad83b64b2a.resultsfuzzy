Docking simulations of the five POM isomers of 1,6-PTi 2 , 1,5-PTi 2 , 1,11-PTi 2 , 1,4-PTi 2 , 1,2-PTi 2 with SARS 3CL pro were carried out using Affinity/Insight II, the results are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1 . The representative structure of POM/3CL pro complexes is shown in Fig. 4 . The results show that all the five POM ligands interact with the 3CL pro receptor just in the active site region including the catalytic residues. Hydrogen bonds are formed between POMs and several key residues including the catalyst residues of 3CL pro His41/Cys145. The ligand-receptor interaction of POMs/3CL pro generally causes energy decreasing and conformation changing; accordingly these changes should influence the enzyme catalytic activity of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro . Binding energy of the five Ti-containing a-Keggin POMs of 1,5-PTi 2 , 1,6-PTi 2 , 1,11-PTi 2 , 1,4-PTi 2 and 1,2-PTi 2 with the SARS-CoV 3CL pro receptor are summarized in Table 1 . Where ''D'' represents energy difference originated from steric hindrance between POMs and 3CL pro , ''D 1 '' represents electrostatic energy changing of the complex, and ''D 2 '' is the total energy changing. As is shown in the results that, for all these five ligand-receptor complexes, the electrostatic energy (D 1 ) both decrease remarkably, which indicates that the highly negative charged POM inhibitors interact with the 3CL pro and therefore cause electrostatic energy to decrease. Furthermore, the electrostatic interaction is strong enough to overcome the unfavorable steric effects, therefore results in total negative energy (D 2 ) in all the five complexes. Binding energy is an important criterion for reliable virtual screening. Several researches have performed virtual screening study of SARS-CoV 3CL pro using small molecular like AG7088 as reference molecule [35, 36] . As is shown in our investigation that, binding energy of POM/3CL pro complex is much higher than that of some small organic molecules. This indicates that POMs may even more prone to bind with 3CL pro than small organic molecules. What is more, an important conclusion can be drawn from our study is that, the total binding energies of the five complex systems follow the order of 1,2-PTi 2 /3CL pro > 1,4-PTi 2 /3CL pro > 1,5-PTi 2 /3CL pro > 1,6-PTi 2 /3CL pro > 1,11-PTi 2 /3CL pro , which can provide perfectly well interpretation on the relative stability of the five POM/3CL pro complexes. Relative information about hydrogen bonds interaction is listed in Table 2 . There are eight hydrogen bonds formed in the 1,6-PTi 2 /3CL pro complex, and six hydrogen bonds in the 1,2-PTi 2 /3CL pro complex. Moreover, it is clearly shown that the OTi 2 of POMs contributes much to hydrogen bond formation within all the five ligand-receptor complexes. Our former DFT calculation have shown that in these POM isomers, the charge loading of OTi 2 is much stronger than that of other bridging oxygen and terminal oxygen. That should be the reason why the two systems of the 1,2-PTi 2 /3CL pro complexes and the 1,4-PTi 2 /3CL pro complex are much more stable than the others. It should be noticed that there are only six hydrogen bonds in 1,11-PTi 2 /3CL pro and the terminal oxygen also attends hydrogen bonds formation. Our quantum chemistry calculation also proved that the charge loading of the terminal oxygen is smaller than that of OW 2 . Therefore, it is easy to interpret why the complex of 1,11-PTi 2 /3CL pro is the least stable one among all the five ligand-receptor complex systems. In addition, it should be noticed from the hydrogen bonding interaction shown in Fig. 5 that, POMs interact with 3CL pro in the active site region with several positive charged amino residues including the active site catalysis residues. Those key residues for ligand-receptor interaction including Thr26, His41, Cys44, Asn142, Cys145, Clu166, Asp187 and Gln189, are all polarity residues, this make them easy to form hydrogen bonds meshwork and increase the complex stability. What is more, during the course of POMs/SARS-CoV 3CL pro complex formation, the atom charge loading properties and the electrostatic characteristic are very vital elements that keep the enzyme-inhibitor interaction. Therefore, the atom charge loading property and the electrostatic characteristic are two vital elements keeping POM/3CL pro complex stable and deserve paying Note: D is the energy change originating from the steric hindrance. D 1 is the energy change of electrostatic energy. D 2 is the total energy change of electrostatic energy plus steric hindrance.
