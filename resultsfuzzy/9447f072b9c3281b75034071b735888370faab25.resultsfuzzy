Based on our microarrays results, we selected representative mRNAs, microRNAs and lncRNAs for validating. For real-time PCR, 7500 Real-Time PCR System (ABI) and SYBR Green Master (Takara) were used. Each sample and negative controls had at least three technical replicates. GAPDH, β-actin and 5S rRNA were amplified under the same conditions as internal controls. The relatives fold change was calculated based on the -ΔΔct method [36] . To validate the mRNA, microRNA, and lncRNA microarray results, we subjected 13 DE mRNAs and 18 DE miRNAs to quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (Tables 1 and 2) . Generally, the qRT-PCR data matched the microarray data, with foldchange values of representative mRNAs and miRNAs in qRT-PCR displaying trends similar to those reflected in the results of microarray analysis. On one hand, the 13 selected mRNAs were primarily associated with leucocyte transendothelial migration signalling pathways. In this pathway, ITK, PLCG2, CXCL12, VCAM1, CLDN1, ZAP70, THY1, and MLLT4 expression levels significantly decreased with IBV stimulation, whereas only IL-6 expression significantly increased in IBV-infected avian BMDCs (Fig. 5a) . On the other hand, among the 18 tested microRNAs, gga-miRlet7g, gga-miR19a, gga-miR1595, Data points shown in red represent significant differentially expressed genes; P < 0.01. b Heat map of differentially expressed mRNAs in IBVstimulated avian BMDCs. All of the biological replicates were pooled and calculated to identify differentially expressed mRNAs based on a threshold fold change > 2 and P < 0.01. The blue and the yellow group represent two groups. The blue one represent control group, with G1 × 1, G1 × 2, G1 × 3 at the bottom. Whilst the yellow one represent IBV-infected DCs, with G2 × 1, G2 × 2, G2 × 3 at the bottom. c Primary GO categorisation and KEGG pathway analyses based on differentially expressed mRNAs in IBV-stimulated avian BMDCs gga-miR1624, gga-miR1809, gga-miR2131, gga-miR24, gga-miR106, gga-miR122b, gga-miR1607, gga-miR1462, and gga-miR21 were significantly up-regulated when stimulated with IBV. In contrast, gga-miR1601, gga-miR1816, and gga-miR1694 were significantly downregulated after IBV stimulation (Fig. 5b) .
