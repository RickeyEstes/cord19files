To examine the effect of FGL2 on development of anti-viral T cell responses in the liver, hepatic mononuclear cells were isolated from the liver of fgl2 +/+ or fgl2 2/2 mice on day 8 pi and stained for MHC Class I tetramers specific for the viral peptide epitopes GP [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] and NP 396-404 . Targeted deletion of fgl2 increased numbers of virus-specific CD8 + T cells for both LCMV epitopes ( Figure 4A and 4B ). Liver sections from infected fgl2 +/+ or fgl2 2/2 mice were also analyzed for the presence of CD8 + T cells by immunostaining. Quantification of CD8 + T cells in liver tissue by morphometric analysis confirmed that the frequency of CD8 + T cells was significantly greater in the fgl2 2/2 mice compared to fgl2 +/+ mice on day 8 pi ( Figure 4C ).
