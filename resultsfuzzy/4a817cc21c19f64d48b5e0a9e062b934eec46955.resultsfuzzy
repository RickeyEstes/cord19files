An improved B cell immortalization method was developed for the fast generation of IgG-producing B cell lines from IgG þ CD22 þ peripheral blood B cells. This procedure is characterized by simultaneous B cell stimulation by CpG2006 and B cell infection by EBV during 2 weeks at 50 cells per well (Fig. 1) . After this immortalization phase, the cells are restimulated during 7 days by CpG2006 and IL-2. FACS sorting for the isolation of IgG þ CD22 þ cells resulted in the highest yield (1.4 Â 10 4 cells out of 1 Â 10 7 PBMC), purity (>99%) and immortalization efficiency (83%, donor 3 in Fig. 2a ) when compared to magnetic selection alone or in combination with FACS sorting (data not shown). No IgM þ immortalized B cell lines were recovered after FACS sorting, although several IgM þ wells could be found after magnetic selection. Consequently, IgG þ CD22 þ FACS sorting was proven to be the best choice for IgG þ B cell isolation prior to B cell immortalization. This enrichment of IgG þ B cells before immortalization was performed to select for IgG-producing immortalized B cell lines. Autoantibodies of the IgG isotype are mostly implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. For example, oligoclonal IgG bands (OCB) have been described in the CSF of patients with MS and are used as a diagnostic indicator [16, 17] . In several autoimmune diseases, including myasthenia gravis (MG) [18, 19] , systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and RA [20] , IgG responses against autoantigenic targets are present. Therefore, it is interesting to focus on IgG responses when examining humoral immunity in autoimmune diseases. The high immortalization efficiency on FACS sorted cells (83%) was confirmed on 2 other healthy donors (donors 1e2 Fig. 2a) . Considering all 3 individual immortalization experiments, an immortalization efficiency of 53e83% could be achieved (Fig. 2a) . Variations in culture conditions were tested together with the immortalization experiments in donors 1 and 2 (Fig. 2b) . A mean Table 1 Sequences of VH and J gene-specific primers. immortalization efficiency of 55% was hereby obtained for the improved method, as indicated by the mean percentage of IgG-and growth-positive wells (Fig. 2b) . Variation in CpG2006 and IL-2 concentration revealed that the most efficient B cell stimulation and immortalization could be obtained with 1 mg/ml CpG2006, without the addition of IL-2 during EBV infection (data not shown). CpG2006 was used for B cell stimulation during immortalization as it was previously shown that this ligand of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) [21] increases immortalization efficiency when administered during EBV infection [13] and causes polyclonal B cell activation and proliferation [22e24] . Some studies revealed that CpG2006 suppresses viral infection as it protects against several viruses [25, 26] and induces the production of anti-viral cytokines and other proteins [27, 28] . Concerning EBV, CpG2006 has only been shown to suppress the initiation of lytic EBV infection via inhibition of lytic gene expression [28] . Such connection, however, has never been demonstrated for latent EBV infection during B cell immortalization in vitro. Moreover, we have shown a positive effect of CpG2006 on B cell activation and a higher immortalization efficiency when CpG2006 is administered to cells when immortalization is in progress (data not shown). In contrast to the increase that has been described in CpG2006 elicited B cell activation [29] or immortalization [30] by IL-2, we could not detect an amplification of B cell immortalization when IL-2 was administered during the B cell immortalization phase (data not shown). Since the IL-2 receptor is mainly present on activated B cells [31] , it is likely that IL-2 exerts a stimulating effect on B cell proliferation and growth rather than on B cell activation. This is also reflected in the higher immortalization efficiency when CpG2006 and IL-2 are combined for restimulation in comparison with the addition of CpG2006 or IL-2 alone (Fig. 2a) , although the difference was not statistically significant. Addition of CpG2006 increases the effect of IL-2 given that TLR9 expression is elevated after EBV infection and CpG2006 stimulation [32] , rendering the immortalized cells even more responsive to CpG2006. B cell spectratyping provides further insights into the clonality of the resulting immortalized B cells, which can be useful to evaluate the need for cloning of the B cell lines. A monoclonality rate of 87% was demonstrated, while the remaining 13% of the investigated B cell lines appeared to be biclonal (Fig. 2c) . This preferential generation of monoclonal immortalized B cell lines can be explained by the immortalization process itself. EBV-infected B cells undergo a proliferative crisis in which most of the cells die because of apoptosis. Surviving B cells become activated and eventually transform into lymphoblastoid immortalized cell lines [33] . Consequently, the outgrowth of multiple immortalized B cell lines is rare when starting with low B cell numbers per well. Nevertheless, the high monoclonality rate provides a major advantage for our B cell immortalization method in combination with the high immortalization efficiency. Subcloning using limiting dilution is no longer necessary, which considerably reduces the time span in which monoclonal antibodies can be produced.
