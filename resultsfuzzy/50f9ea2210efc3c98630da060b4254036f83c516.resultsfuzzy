3.1. Expression of bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM, bx-PA-NcPROF, and PA-NcPROF in Silkworms In this study, three NcPROF constructs were generated. PA-NcPROF has a PA tag sequence at its N-terminus ( Figure 1A) , whereas bx-PA-NcPROF has the signal sequence of bombyxin from B. mori at its N-terminus ( Figure 1B) . Meanwhile, bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM has the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of GP64 from BmNPV at the C-terminus of bx-PA-NcPROF ( Figure 1C ). The bombyxin signal peptide (bx) is responsible for the secretion of recombinant proteins to the hemolymph of silkworm larvae [17, 18] . The GP64TM were used as a fusion partner with NcPROF as a target protein to be incorporated into the cell membrane [19] . All NcPROF constructs were observed in both the fat body and hemolymph when they were expressed in silkworm larvae (Figure 2A ). PA-NcPROF, bx-PA-NcPROF, and bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM comprise 176, 195, and 226 amino acids, respectively, and their estimated molecular weights are 19, 21, and 25 kDa, respectively. All NcPROFs were expressed and verified intra-and extracellularly in Bm5 cells ( Figure 2B ). The molecular weight of PA-NcPROF was approximately 25 kDa by western blotting. The molecular weight of native NcPROF in this study was similar to that of full-length profilin expressed in E. coli (22 kDa) [12] . This finding suggests that PA-NcPROF expressed in silkworm larvae may be not modified posttranslationally. bx-PA-NcPROF was observed in the fat body and hemolymph at 25-30 kDa as a large obscure band that appeared as two bands. The molecular weight of the lower band was the same as that of PA-NcPROF and that of the upper band was larger than that of PA-NcPROF. This finding suggests that bx-PA-NcPROF may be partially modified posttranslationally after the cleavage of the bombyxin signal peptide. In fact, N128 was predicted as an N-glycosylation site estimated by NetNGlyc 1.0 Server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/). The bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM product was observed at 30-40 kDa by western blotting. Interestingly, bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was observed in the hemolymph and culture medium although it was fused with the transmembrane domain of GP64. In our previous report, N. caninum-derived antigens NcSAG1 and NcSRS2 fused with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of GP64 were not observed in hemolymph [9] . In this study, bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was secreted into hemolymph, in part, and the culture medium from Bm5 cells. It has been reported that profilins of T. gondii and Babesia canis were partially secreted even though no signal peptide is predicted in these genes [20, 21] . In this study, NcPROF was also secreted regardless of the addition of the signal sequence. To investigate N-glycosylation of the N-glycan of three NcPROFs, PNGase F treatment was carried out ( Figure S1 ). Molecular weight of each NcPROF was not changed between before and after the PNGase F treatment, indicating no N-glycan was attached into the three NcPROFs. These results suggest that the two bands of bx-PA-NcPROF did not come from its N-glycosylation. Hence, it showed that the bx-PA-NcPROF and bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM were not posttranslationally modified with an N-glycan in endoplasmic reticulum even though these proteins have the bx signal peptide. In addition, the discrepancy of the molecular weight of each PROF to its estimated that was not caused by the N-glycosylation. In nature, estimated pI of this NcPROF is around 4.89, which may have influence on the mobility of NcPROFs on the SDS-PAGE gel [22] . In addition, the negative charge of acidic residues may create repulsion and this repulsion caused the anomalous migration of protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gels [23] . This may be the reason why the molecular weight of bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was increased. The expressed NcPROFs in the Bm5 cell culture broth were further investigated by ultracentrifugation ( Figure 3 ). It showed that PA-NcPROF and bx-PA-NcPROF were not precipitated by ultracentrifugation (100,000× g), while bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was pelleted. Normally, transmembrane proteins are anchored in the membrane fraction of cells and are not easily secreted. However, glycoproteins from some viruses are secreted and are partially incorporated into extracellular vesicles when they are overexpressed [24, 25] . Moreover, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of GP64 from BmNPV facilitated the display of recombinant proteins on BmNPV particles. These findings suggest that bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was secreted as nanoparticles or by display on the envelope of BmNPV particles. bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was then purified from silkworm hemolymph using anti-PA tag agarose. As shown in Figure 4A , bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was successfully purified as a single band in SDS-PAGE and was further verified by western blotting ( Figure 4B ). This finding indicates that bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM does not display on the surface of BmNPV particles because no band was observed in the purified sample except for bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM. These results suggested that bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM forms only some nanoparticles and can be secreted into hemolymph and the culture broth. The yield of purified NcPROF-GP64TM was approximately 14 µg from 3 mL of larval hemolymph. Interestingly, PA-NcPROF and bx-PA-NcPROF could not be purified from hemolymph using the same protocols as bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM. From the results, it was demonstrated that, without modification of the transmembrane region at the C-terminus for both constructs, bx-PA-NcPROF was only slightly purified and PA-NcPROF was almost impossible to be purified from hemolymph ( Figure S2 ) although a portion of bx-PA-NcPROF was secreted into hemolymph compared with bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM (Figure 2A) . However, when 0.5% (w/v) nonyl phenoxypolyethoxylethanol (NP-40) was added, both bx-PA-NcPROF and PA-NcPROF could be purified from hemolymph and showed positive bands at 30 kDa and 25 kDa, respectively ( Figure S2 ), suggesting that bx-PA-NcPROF and PA-NcPROF were aggregated abnormally and the aggregates were dissolved with NP-40.
