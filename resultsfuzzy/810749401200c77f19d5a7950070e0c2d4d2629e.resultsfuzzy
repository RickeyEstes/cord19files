To examine whether the inhibitory effects of USP25 on SEVinduced type I IFN signaling is due to its deubiquitinase activity, wild-type USP25 (USP25-WT) and its mutants (C178A and H607A) lacking DUB activity were co-transfected with the promoter luciferase reporter plasmid of IFN-β, IRF3, NF-κB and ISRE, and the luciferase activity was detected. The results showed that USP25-WT remarkably inhibited SEV-induced activation of IFN-β ( Figure 6A ), IRF3 ( Figure 6B ), NF-κB ( Figure 6C ) and ISRE ( Figure 6D ) in a dose-dependent
