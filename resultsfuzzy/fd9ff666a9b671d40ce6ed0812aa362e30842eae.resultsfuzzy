This question requires understanding the concept of anergy. Anergy refers to an inadequate immune response and may be a result of several variables including: The age of the patient, the overall health of the patient, immunosuppression, and many other factors. In this problem, the poorly controlled HIV status implies that the patient is immunosuppressed and incapable of demonstrating a response to the PPD. Therefore, the PPD will be negative, despite the patient actually having tuberculosis. This question is an example of a Type II error. Also known as false-negative error and beta error, type II error occurs when something is declared as false, when it is actually true. This type of error may occur in cases of anergy and testing within the window period, amongst many other examples. A type I error occurs when something is declared as true, when it is actually false. This type of error is also known as false-positive error and alpha error. An example of a type I error would be a positive PPD due to nontuberculosis mycobacterium exposure. In this instance, a positive PPD would indicate that a patient has been exposed to tuberculosis, when they have not. Another example of a type I error would be a positive RPR while testing for syphilis in a patient that has Lyme disease, lupus, malaria, or is pregnant. 


Section:d. this is a type ii error because the result is likely negative when the disease is present
