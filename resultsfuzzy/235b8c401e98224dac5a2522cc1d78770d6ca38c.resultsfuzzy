Plasma IgG at 24 h Differences in birth BW or age at first feeding were not detected (Table 3) . Plasma IgG was undetectable in all 0-h samples, which verified calves did not nurse their dams. Plasma IgG increased to 13.76 ± 0.66 g/L in MC-fed calves and 13.84 ± 0.65 g/L in CR-fed calves at 24 h. Differences were not detected between treatments in 24-h IgG or apparent efficiency of absorption (AEA). The AEA was 19.2 ± 0.8 and 20.3 ± 0.8% for MC-and CR-fed calves (Table 4) . Calves fed CR had greater plasma IgG concentrations at 24 h than previously reported (5.0 to 8.3 g/L) for bovine serum-based products (Arthington et al., 2000a (Arthington et al., , 2000b Quigley et al., 2000a) . In previous research, CR provided 90 g of IgG. In the present experiment, calves received 250 (Holsteins) or 180 (Jerseys) g of IgG. The IgG concentrations were similar to those reported in calves fed the same dose of this CR (Quigley et al., 2002) . The AEA was in the low end of the range of previously reported values for MC (30 to 35%) and CR (30%) (Quigley et al., 2002) , but similar to a recent experiment conducted at Virginia Tech using an earlier formulation of the same product . There was concern that volume of fluid may have been confounded with treatment as calves fed CR received a greater volume of liquid than those receiving MC. However, the mass of IgG fed was similar regardless of treatment, and Stott and Fellah (1983) found that mass of IgG fed was more important than concentration of IgG fed. Jersey calves had higher 24-h IgG concentrations than Holsteins (16.47 ± 0.71 and 11.12 ± 0.60 g/L), and absorbed IgG with 21.9 ± 0.9% efficiency compared with 17.0 ± 0.7% for Holsteins (Table 5 ). Jersey calves maintained greater plasma IgG concentrations than Holsteins from d 1 through d 15. No differences in IgG concentration or AEA were found between male and female Jerseys, but Holstein males absorbed IgG more efficiently and attained higher IgG concentrations at 24 h than females (Table  5 ). Breed differences in IgG absorption have been reported previously and may result from differences in body size and plasma volume (Quigley et al., 1998a) . Plasma IgG concentrations less than 10 g/L were observed in 15 calves (19.2%), and 24-h IgG concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 21.09 g/L (Table 6 ). Percentage of calves with FPT was within the range of normally observed values but is high given tightly controlled experimental conditions. Average age of calves at first feeding was 1.05 h, and only 5 calves were more than 2-h-old at first feeding. All calves received MC or CR containing greater than 66 g/L IgG. Calves were fed following best management practices, yet still experienced a high rate of FPT. Reasons for the high frequency of FPT in female Holstein calves were not apparent, as all calves were treated similarly during the trial.
