We sought to preserve the proteolytic processing sites of the yeast AMF signal peptide of pPICZ while installing the Gateway cassette just upstream of them. When the Gateway destination vector pDest-910 (Materials and methods) was recombined with a Gateway entry clone of the gene of interest that contained the six amino acids lost during pDest-910 construction, the resulting expression plasmid encoded the complete AMF signal peptide fused to the protein of interest, with 9 extra amino acids encoded by the Gateway attB1 site (Figs. 3 and 4) . The hybrid human IFN-gene Hy3 was cloned into pPICZ with restriction enzymes XhoI and NotI and ligase, and into pDest-910 by Gateway recombination. For REaL cloning, it was necessary to remove an XhoI site within the Hy3 gene of the PCR template by sitedirected mutagenesis. Since both expression vectors had lost 23 bases of the mating factor signal peptide coding sequence as a result of the XhoI digestion, the Hy3 gene was PCR ampliWed with primers that added those 23 bases to the 5Ј end of the Hy3 coding sequence. For REaL cloning the PCR primers contained XhoI (5Ј) and Shaded codons in B derive from the attB1 site, and represent amino acids that are added to the signal peptide by conversion of the secretion vector to the Gateway system. The mature Hy3 sequence is italicized, CDLPQTƒ NotI (3Ј) sites. The PCR primers also contained attB sequences for cloning by Gateway recombination into the donor vector pDonr223, i.e., the same PCR product was used for both REaL and Gateway cloning. Inserts and junctions of both types of clones were fully sequenced, then the insert of the Gateway entry clone was transferred into pDest-910 by in vitro recombination. The base and amino acid sequences of the relevant regions of the Gateway and REaL clones are shown in Fig. 4 . The two P. pastoris expression plasmids pHy3-REaL and pHy3-Gateway were electroporated into strain X-33 and selected on zeocin plates. Single colonies were picked into broth medium and frozen glycerol stocks were made. Supernatants from shake Xask cultures induced with methanol were spotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with anti-IFN-2a antibody (data not shown), which also detects Hy3; both cultures were positive for secreted Hy3. Both REaL and Gateway strains were then grown in 1 L cultures in minifermenters with pH and dissolved oxygen control. Following initial growth with glycerol as a carbon source, the cultures were transitioned to methanol feeding and grown for 90 h after the start of methanol induction (Wnal cell densities were approximately 0.5 kg wet weight per liter). Culture supernatants were harvested every 24 h and either applied directly to an SDS-PAGE gel that was subsequently stained with Coomassie blue (Fig. 5A ) or probed on a dot blot (Fig. 5B) . The human IFN Hy3 produced by both the REaL and Gateway clones migrated identically on an SDS-PAGE gel. Both Hy3 and the IFN-2c standard migrated as doublets, with the Hy3 doublet migrating more slowly than the 2c doublet. Both the REaL and Gateway Hy3 proteins were partially puriWed and their N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined. The upper and lower bands of the Gateway and REaL Hy3 proteins (Fig. 5) had the same sequences, NH2-EAEACDL,, showing that while the Pichia homolog of Kex2 had cleaved at the expected site (Fig. 4) , the Ste13 homolog did not. IneYcient Ste13 processing of the AMF signal peptide in Pichia is common (for example, see [5, 6] ). Migration of IFNs as doublets on SDS-PAGE is presumably due to disulWde bond formation, since extensive heating with reducing agent considerably diminished the doublets (our unpublished observations). The Hy3 protein is a synthesis of the amino 94 amino acids of IFN-2c and the carboxy 71 amino acids of IFN-21a [2] . We used puriWed 2c protein to estimate the concentrations of Hy3 produced by the Gateway and REaL strains at time points in our fermentation (Fig. 5) . The Gateway strain was more productive early in the run, but the REaL strain ended up secreting about as much protein. Comparison to the 2c standard on both the SDS-PAGE gel and the antibody dot blot suggested concentrations of secreted Hy3 protein of 100-150 mg per liter. Since neither of these expression strains was selected for multiple copies of the expressed gene, we assume that each contains one copy per P. pastoris genome, the most common number. The Gateway and REaL culture supernatants had similar speciWc antiviral activities, on the order of 10 7 international units/mg protein (approximately 10% pure). They also had similar antiproliferative activities, approximately 2 ng/ml inhibited cell proliferation by 50%. These results show that the presence of amino acids in the yeast mating factor signal peptide corresponding to the Gateway attB1 site does not signiWcantly aVect the secretion of recombinant Hy3 from P. pastoris cells during fermenter growth. While other proteins may behave diVerently, the ease with which genes of any size or restriction map can be cloned for secretion via Gateway make this method an attractive alternative to standard cloning methods to attempt production of secreted proteins in P. pastoris.
