Unfortunately, the correct comparison of GED parameters of 4-MePyO and non-substituted pyridine-N-oxide looks to be impossible because of large uncertainties in GED values obtained for PyO [14] . According to quantum chemical calculations the insertion of the methyl group in para e position to the PyO has no significant effect on the structural parameters of the pyridine ring, excluding only the ipso-angle : C2C1C5, which changes from 120.6 in PyO to 115.9 in 4-MePyO (B3LYP/cc-pVTZ). It is interesting to note, that the substituent effects on the geometry of heterocyclic ring are rather similar to the tendencies for the benzene ring [36, 37] . Thus, the presence of the electron-donating CH 3 substituent leads to the decrease of the ipso-angle. Furthermore, according to the calculations the r(N/O) bond lengths appear to be also sensitive to a Fig. 1 . b Uncertainties in r h1 s¼(s sc 2 þ(2.5s LS ) 2 ) 1/2 (s sc ¼ 0,002r, s LS estandard deviation in least-squares refinement), for angles s ¼ 3s LS . c p i e parameter refined independently. Table 6 . The CeC and CeN bond orders in the ring for both molecules, as well as the values of the distances from Tables 3 and 5 show that these bonds do not correspond to either single nor double bonds. This confirms the existence of p-conjugation in the pyridine rings. The C1eC6 bond order for 4-MePyO corresponds to the single CeC bond. It is interesting to note that Q(NeO) in both molecules can not be interpreted as exact single or double bond. Moreover, the introduction of an electron-donating substituent increases the bond length N/O, slightly reduces the corresponding bond order and significantly increases the electron density on the oxygen. One can conclude that in this case the nucleophilic properties of the molecule increase. Furthermore, as it has been mentioned previously [18] the introduction of electron-donating substituents to the heterocyclic ring of N-oxides results in increasing ability for complex formation. Our experimental and calculated data (Tables 3, 6 and 7) reveal the incorrectness of the authors of [15] in their conclusion about more single NeO bond character in 4-MePyO. The delocalization of electron density between occupied Lewis type (bonds or lone pairs) NBO orbitals and formally unoccupied (antibonding) non-Lewis NBO orbitals corresponds to a stabilizing donor-acceptor interaction. The energy of these interactions can be estimated by the second order perturbation theory. Table 7 collects the largest values of calculated second order interaction energies (E 2 ) between donor-acceptor orbitals in PyO and 4-MePyO. In both cases several values correspond to the interactions related to the resonance in the pyridine ring, i.e. the interactions between p(CeC) and p*(CeC) and between p(CeC) and p*(CeN). The nature of semipolar NeO bond was explained in detail [18] . The largest second order interaction energies (E 2 ) in both molecules corre- To study the substituent effect on the aromaticity the nuclear independent chemical shifts NICS(1) have been calculated by using B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ approximation. NICS(1) values correspond to the negative isotropic shielding (in ppm) at 1 Å above the ring plane. The calculated values of NICS(1): À7.40 (PyO) and À7.36 (4-Me-PyO) are very close to each other. Thus, from the NICS(1) values one can conclude that the introduction of CH 3 group does not noticeably affect the aromaticity of the pyridine-N-oxide. Furthermore, the data of Table 5 do not confirm the conclusion of the authors of [15] about changing the aromaticity with substitution, which was made by analyzing the average values of bond length in the pyridine ring.
