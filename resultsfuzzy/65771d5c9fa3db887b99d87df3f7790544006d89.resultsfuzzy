As a result of this drift, PEs were calculated only for the 1.0e2.5 and 2.5e5.0 mm particle concentrations. Table 1 details the protection efficiencies for the hallway adjacent to the patient room during aerosol release into the room with the ventilation system in the baseline and modified (whole floor negative air) operation modes. The maximum measurable PE was greater than 99% for the 1.0e2.5 mm and 2.5e5.0 mm particles during both the baseline and modified operation modes. The average PE, as measured during the 2.5-hr test in the baseline mode, and including the four entry/exits into the patient room, was 99.8% for the 1.0e2.5 mm particles and >99.7% for the 2.5e5.0 mm particles. During the modified mode, the On average, the PE was statistically significantly lower using the modified ventilation airflow rate compared to the baseline condition (p < 0.0001). During the four door entry/exits the average minimum PEs were lower during the modified mode (93.5e93.6%) than those for the normal mode (98.6e98.7%). Lower observed PEs in the modified mode may be explained, at least in part, by the 52% reduction in the outdoor air ventilation in the hallway. Thus, particles released into the hallway from the patient room accumulated to higher concentrations with the lower ventilation rate. The measurement uncertainty of the particle counters is estimated to be Â±10%. For a PE of 98%, this measurement uncertainty translates into an uncertainty for the PE of approximately 0.5% (i.e. 97.6%e 98.4%).
