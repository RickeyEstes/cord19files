Diamides seem to be promising candidates for antibacterial agents with very strong anti-MRSA activity, as it was published recently [13] . In the present study the series of nine newly synthesized diamides was evaluated as prospective bactericidal agents against representatives of multidrugresistant bacteria, three clinical isolates of MRSA, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (methicillin-susceptible) as the reference and quality control strain. Since SALs and their analogues are known as compounds with bacteriostatic effect [31] , this is the first study where SAL-like compounds were considered as prospective bactericidal agents and the dependence of bactericidal effect of these compounds on time and concentration was evaluated. Thus, absolutely novel microbiological characteristics of these compounds were revealed in the present study. Recently MIC values of diamides expressed as molar concentrations in mol/L were published [13] . To allow comparison with MBC values of the present study, MICs in g/mL were calculated and are recorded in Table 1 along with the activity of reference antibacterial drugs, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin. Potential bactericidal activity of diamides was assessed using MBC assay [26] . MBC values of all tested compounds are recorded in Table 1 as well. Based on the obtained results, all compounds assessed as active according to MIC values in our previous study (1f-i) showed low or moderate MBC values against all four strains. The MBC values of these compounds did not exceed the highest tested drug concentration and ranged from 1 to 16 g/mL. In all cases, there were comparable MBC values for the clinical isolates of MRSA and the S. aureus reference strain. Bactericidal activity is defined as a ratio of MBC to MIC of â‰¤4 [32] . Table 1 bactericidal activity is expressed in bold. As mentioned above, SALs are known to exhibit a bacteriostatic effect [31] , so it was very interesting to discover that diamides possess bactericidal activity. The amide bond (-CONH-) can cause interactions with a variety of enzymes [33] ; therefore the presence of two amide bonds could be responsible for the bactericidal effect of diamides against MRSA. The activity of SALs and their analogues results from multiple mechanisms, which are still under investigation; for example, it was found that SALs are capable of inhibiting transglycosylases in later stages of S. aureus (including MRSA) cell wall biosynthesis [12] . These enzymes catalyse the step prior to the transpeptidation in the peptidoglycan biosynthesis and are responsible for polymerization of lipid II, which occurs at the outer face of the membrane [12] . Since antibacterial agents targeting cell wall biosynthesis act as bactericidal agents [30, 34] , the failure in the cell wall biosynthesis due to the inhibition of transglycosylases could be responsible for bactericidal activity of diamides against MRSA. Based on these findings, antibacterial active diamides with bactericidal effect against all four tested strains as prospective bactericidal agents were chosen for subsequent timekill curve studies to determine the real dependence of bactericidal effect on concentration over time.
