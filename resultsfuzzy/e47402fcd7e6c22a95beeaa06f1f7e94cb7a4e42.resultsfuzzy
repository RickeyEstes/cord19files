The number of published articles found using the abovementioned keywords in ISI Web of Science (1910epresent) vs. publication year is shown in Fig. 1 . Although studies and articles related to indoor air cleaning have increased rapidly since 1993, we have not been able to read and analyze carefully all these articles as this was beyond our collective ability. Of the 133 articles thoroughly reviewed and discussed by the panel, 59 articles were judged relevant and conclusive. We found that the number of articles with real environment data (field test) depends on the specific air cleaning technologies. For example, catalytic oxidation, ozone, and plasma are mostly tested in laboratory settings. For the traditional technologies such as filtration, sorption and UVGI, many studies were in completed in real environments. Table 1 summarizes the distribution of reviewed articles in either laboratory or real environments. The performance of air cleaners is best measured and compared (between cleaning devices) by a Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) which is defined as the product of the single-pass removal efficiency and volumetric airflow rate through the cleaning device. However, many of the articles that were reviewed in this study did not include an explicit determination of CADR, nor were single-pass removal efficiency or volumetric flow rates provided to allow for an implicit calculation of CADR. Figs. 2 and 3 summarize the reported CADR and single-pass removal efficiency in the 59 reviewed articles (Tables 2e6).
