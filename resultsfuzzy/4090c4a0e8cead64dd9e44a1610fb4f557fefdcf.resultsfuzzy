Following these methods, we have developed a murine model for ZIKV infections. Ifnar1 -/mice at 6-8 weeks of age were infected with 1 x 10 4 focus-forming units (FFU) of the ZIKV by retroorbital injection. Pathological symptoms and signs (Figure 1A) , as well as weight changes ( Figure  1B) , were observed in the Ifnar1 -/mice after an infection with the ZIKV. The murine brains showed obvious edema and hyperemia ( Figure 1C) . Meanwhile, the testes shrank gradually ( Figure 1D) . Furthermore, pathological changes and the destruction of tissue were found in the brain and testes (Figure 2A) . We performed an immunofluorescence assay to detect the ZIKV in the brain and testes (Figure 2B) . High viral loads were detected in the brain and testis by immunostaining ( Figure 2B ). Immunohistochemistry showed a robust infiltration of CD3 + T cells into the mice brain after the infection with the ZIKV (Figure 2C) . To detect and evaluate ZIKV-specific T-cell responses, we prepared a mouse MHC-I H-2D b -E 294-302 tetramer. The peptide E 294-302 can help the H-2D b renature properly and yield a high amount of the soluble MHC-I (Figure 3A) . In the shift assay, a high efficiency in biotinylation could be observed ( Figure 3B) . Subsequently, three streptavidin fluorescence (APC, PE, and BV421)-tagged pMHC-I tetramers were produced to detect ZIKV-specific T cells (Figure 3C) . The PE-labeled tetramer had a higher efficacy to detect the specific CD8 + T cell compared to the APC-and BV421-labeled tetramers, though the difference was not statistically significant. Using the E 294-302 tetramer, we detected ZIKV-specific T lymphocytes in the spleen of the infected mice by flow cytometry at 7 d post-inoculation of the ZIKV (3.49 ± 0.45%). Also, similar to the method described in section 3 of this protocol, with 4 weeks post-immunization of AdC7-M/E vaccine, ZIKV-specific T lymphocytes were detected in the spleen (6.89 ± 1.36%) (Figure 4) . Furthermore, we detected the lymphocytes infiltrated into the immunoprivileged organs, such as the brain and testes, after the ZIKV infection. The gates were set to select for CD3 + CD8 + T cells in total lymphocytes of the brain and testes. A high ratio of the E 294-302 tetramer-specific T cells could be detected in the brain (42.2% in CD3 + CD8 + T cells) and the testicular (26.4% in CD3 + CD8 + T cells) lymphocytes ( Figure 5 ).
