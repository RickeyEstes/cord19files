3.1. Inhibition of MERS-CoV 3CL pro and viral infection by 6b, 6c and 6d Peptidomimetic compounds were synthesized according to our reported method (Kuo et al., 2008) . Preliminary screening of these peptidomimetic compounds against MERS 3CL pro were done at 50 mM. Compounds inhibiting more than half of the protease activity under such condition were selected for further IC 50 measurements. Using enzymatic assay, the compounds 6b, 6c and 6d showed IC 50 of 2.4, 4.7 and 1.7 mM against purified 3CL pro of MERS-CoV, respectively (Table 1) . These compounds also inhibited SARS 3CL pro at lower IC 50 values of 0.7, 0.5 and 0.2 mM, respectively. To evaluate the ability of these compounds to block viral replication, we performed cytopathic inhibition assay using MERS-CoVinfected Huh-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, compounds 6b, 6c and 6d efficiently suppressed viral replication with EC 50 of 1.4, 1.2 and 0.6 mM, respectively (Table 1) . Though it is usual to see EC 50 higher than IC 50 , due to the presence of membrane barrier, we observed EC 50 to be smaller than IC 50 . This could be due to the higher concentration (300 nM) used for in-vitro enzymatic assay because it is a weakly associated dimer . In fact, they inhibited 50 nM SARS 3CL pro , a tight dimer, in the submicromolar range (Table 1) . These compounds had CC 50 larger than 100 mM for 6b and 6c or 58.6 mM for 6d against uninfected cells, resulting in selectivity index (S.I.) values larger than 71.4. As expected, compound 6a which was inactive in the enzyme assay did not suppress viral replication. GEM, used as a positive control according to a previous report (Dyall et al., 2014) , was less potent in inhibiting MERS-CoV infection with an EC 50 value of 8.3 mM. It also showed marginal toxicity and thus decreased viability of mock cells by 20% or more at the concentrations above 3.7 mM (Table 1 and Fig. 1 ).
