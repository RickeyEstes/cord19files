Forty-three horses met the inclusion criteria. One horse did not have CBC data available for the duration of hospitalization and was removed from analysis. Not all data were available for all horses. Horses ranged in age from 1 to -25 years (mean, 10.5 years) and included a variety of breeds, with the largest single group being Warmbloods (12/42; 29%). There were 25 geldings, 15 mares, and 2 stallions. Complete patient demographic data are presented in supplemental Table 1 . Eight of 42 (19%) horses were classified as ECoV-positive, 12 of 42 (29%) were classified as Salmonella-positive, and 22 of 42 (52%) were UNK. The presenting complaints recorded at the time of admission were similar among groups (Table 1) . Fever (21/42; 50%) and colic (11/42; 26%) were the most common presenting complaints, followed by anorexia and diarrhea (9/42; 21% each). Presenting physical examination findings were similar among groups (supplemental Table 2 No significant differences were found for any variable between horses diagnosed with ECoV and Salmonella. Horses with ECoV had significantly lower neutrophil counts than UNK ( Figure 3A) . However, horses with ECoV were no more likely to be neutropenic than horses with Salmonella (odds ratio, 0.909; 95% confidence interval, 0.177-3.912) or UNK (odds ratio, infinity; 95% confidence interval, 0.891-infinity). The total white blood cell count was significantly lower in horses with Salmonella than in UNK horses ( Figure 2 ). Horses with Salmonella were more likely to be leukopenic than were UNK horses (odds ratio, 11; 95% confidence interval, 1.521-127.8) but no more likely to be leukopenic than ECoV (odds ratio, 0.152; 95% confidence interval, 0.011-1.361). No significant differences in lymphocyte or platelet counts or fibrinogen concentration were found among groups ( Figure 3C,D) . Serum biochemistry data are summarized in Table 2
