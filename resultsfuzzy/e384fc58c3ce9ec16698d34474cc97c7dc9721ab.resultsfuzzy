Study objectives: We compare the hemolysis rates of blood samples and the turnaround times for the results of commonly performed laboratory tests delivered to the laboratory from an ED by a pneumatic tube system with those delivered by human courier. Methods: We studied all consecutive measurements of serum hemoglobin and potassium ordered from 2 EDs of a multisite tertiary care hospital system, 1 with a pneumatic tube system and the other using human couriers. Synchronized time stamps were used to record turnaround times for the results. Hemolysis was determined by using a standardized laboratory measure. Time data were normalized by log transformation (ln[minutes+1]), and then a comparison of sites was conducted with analysis of variance. Hemolysis rates of the 2 delivery systems were compared by χ 2 analyses. Results: The Table demonstrates significantly shorter median turnaround times for hemoglobin potassium when transported via a tube system. Its hemolysis rate was 7/121 (5.79%). Analysis of variance performed on the normalized turnaround time data revealed a main effect of test F(1,660)=406 (standard error of the mean had a positive D-dimer test result, with a threshold of more than 0.35 µg/mL. Of these patients, 76 (11%) had a diagnosis of PE, and 74 of these patients had a positive D-dimer (>0.35) test result. With a D-dimer threshold of more than 0.35, the sensitivity was 0.97 and the specificity was 0.29. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.15 and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 0.99. With a D-dimer threshold of more than 0.50 µg/mL, the sensitivity was 0.93 and the specificity was 0.41. The PPV was 0.17, and the NPV was 0.98. Conclusion: Our data are consistent with the findings of other studies that evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of D-dimer testing in the diagnosis of PE. Our ED currently performs D-dimer testing based solely on physicians' clinical judgment. The specificity of our D-dimer testing may be improved by the use of previously described clinical criteria to increase the pretest probability of PE. Raising our D-dimer threshold to more than 0.50 would increase our D-dimer test specificity, with a slight decrease in sensitivity. Gums JG/University of Florida, Gainesville, FL Study objectives: Staphylococcus aureus bacilli frequently are isolated from skin and skin structure specimens. Infection severity determines antimicrobial treatment, with initial empiric therapy guided by reported susceptibility patterns of isolated etiologic bacteria. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends targeting definitive therapy to known pathogens to prevent antimicrobial resistance. Methods: The ongoing Antimicrobial Resistance Management (ARM) program was initiated in 1997 with establishment of a surveillance database. To date, 251 US hospital laboratories from 6 regions (northeast, north central, southeast, south central, northwest, and southwest) have submitted more than 17 million inpatient and outpatient isolates representing 16 organisms and 44 antibiotics. Data from antibiograms and sensitivity reports of S aureus, methicillin-susceptible S aureus, and methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) isolates from 1990 to 2002 were reviewed by using a Web-based analysis tool to determine resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics, including fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) and other antibiotics (vancomycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and nafcillin/oxacillin). Results: Total number of isolates and percentage of isolates resistant to each antibiotic were determined nationally and regionally. Nationally, S aureus isolates were more resistant to levofloxacin (41.4%; n=123,868) than to ciprofloxacin (38.7%; n=256,178), with greater resistance to levofloxacin seen in north central (47.9% versus 39.4%) and northeast (52.4% versus 41.9%) regions. These data suggest cross-resistance between ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. Resistance to ciprofloxacin was greater than to levofloxacin in south central (34.2% versus 20.0%) and southwest (32.2% versus 23.0%) regions. S aureus isolate susceptibility to erythromycin nationally was 51.1% (n=274,873). Compared with erythromycin, S aureus isolates had a much greater susceptibility to clindamycin (73.6%; n=165,683). This difference was seen in every region, with the smallest comparative difference noted in the north central (52.5% versus 54.3%) region. Susceptibility to nafcillin/oxacillin nationally was 64.9% (n=360,460), which ranged from 62.2% in north central and northeast regions to 72.8% in southwest regions. Most of the change in susceptibility to nafcillin/oxacillin and ciprofloxacin throughout the past decade has occurred in the past 5 years (1998 to 2002) , with ciprofloxacin sensitivity declining with increasing levels of MRSA. Percentages of S aureus isolates remaining susceptible to vancomycin were similar (range 99.8% to 99.9%). val [CI] 1.8 to 3.4). Pediatric patients aged between 6 months and 13 years were less likely to receive antiemetics (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.99), as were black patients (OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.91). Conclusion: Antiemetics are administered to a minority of ED patients with nausea or vomiting, with most patients receiving promethazine. Multivariate analyses suggesting that pediatric and black patients receive antiemetics less frequently require further study. Further studies will track changes in antiemetic use in subsequent years.
