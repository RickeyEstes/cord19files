Several studies have provided biochemical, molecular, and immuno-histochemical evidence of NOS-2 induction following focal cerebral ischemia. Two separate reports demonstrated the induction of NOS-2 activity following permanent MCA occlusion in rats (Yoshida et al., 1995; Iadecola 1995a) . Both studies found an increase in NOS-2 activity at 2-3 days post-occlusion, with a return to baseline by seven days. The time course of NOS-2 induction suggests that NO generated from this isoform does not contribute to the early stages of ischemic injury. Iadecola et al. (1995~; have also investigated NOS-2 mRNA and protein expression in response to focal ischemia. Following permanent MCA occlusion in rats, NOS-2 mRNA was detected by 12 h, peaked at 48 h and returned to baseline by seven days post-occlusion. Immunoreactivity for NOS-2, observed at 48-96 hours after ischemia, was detected only in neutrophils invading the infarct and was not seen in resident cells (Iadecola et al., 1996) . Transient 260 focal ischemia in rats also leads to NOS-2 induction, though with different spatial and temporal patterns of expression than seen following permanent occlusion. Two hours of MCA occlusion, followed by reperfusion, resulted in maximal expression of NOS2 mRNA at an earlier time point, and detection of protein predominantly in vascular cells, rather than in neutrophils (Iadecola et al., 1996) . In mice, permanent MCA occlusion using the filament model of ZeaLonga et al. (1989) leads to the induction of NOS-2 mRNA and protein expression. Using in situ hybridization, we were able to detect NOS-2 message at 24, 48 and 72 h (latest point studied), but not at 6 h post-occlusion ( Fig. 2) . At 24 hours after ischemia, NOS-2 immunoreactivity was observed primarily in what appeared, morphologically, to be inflammatory cells within the infarct (Figure 2) . However, at 48 and 72 h NOS-2 immunoreactivity was also observed in cells morphologically resembling astrocytes, as well as by GFAP staining on adjacent sections (Fig. 2) . These NOS-2 positive cells were located primarily in regions surrounding the infarct. In contrast to previously published reports, these data indicate that resident glial cells, in addition to infiltrating cells, express NOS-2 in the ischemic brain. The differences in our findings compared to previous reports may reflect the differences in total infarct volumes produced as a result of using different surgical procedures (cauterization versus filament occlusion). The infarct volume generated with the filament model of MCA occlusion was typically greater than 80 mm3 (Loihl and while infarcts produced by cauterization were generally smaller ( < 40 mm3), and predominantly cortical (Iadecola et al., 1997) . 


Section:produces a localized, destructive lesion or infarct, with necrosis of all cellular elements in the territory normally perfused by the occluded vessel. ischemic stroke occurs most often in humans as the result of a thromboembolic vascular occlusion, secondary to atherosclerosis, in which there is a focal deposition of plasma-derived lipids that inhibits normal flow. in rodent models, focal ischemia can be induced by either permanently or transiently occluding the middle cerebral artery (mca).
