Of the 86 dispatched questionnaires, 41 were returned for a 48% respondent rate. The ratio of medical centers to regional hospitals was about 1-2; this compared to the ratio of 1-4 according to DOH; thus in our study, more a greater number of medical centers responded, presumably because the non-respondents were mainly from regional hospitals who serve a more restricted geographical area and thus have less IS personnel (average two to three persons most) in their IS department, and may not currently be able to implement EMR exchange. Approximately 57% of EMR exchange adopters were from medical centers. Among the respondents, the proportion of EMR exchangers was 34% which is slightly different from that of the population obtained from the DOH (29%); see Table 1 . Among the respondents, five returns were incomplete. Therefore, only 36 were available for statistics analysis. The majority of the questionnaire respondents were male (92%), aged between 40 and 44 (28%). About 83% percent of the respondents had more than two years of experience in the IS department and 25% were directors with over ten years of experience (see Table 2 ). Mailing surveys with a return of 30% are generally considered satisfactory; thus the respondents to our study represent a reasonable sample of the population. The discriminant analysis of the research model is shown in Table 4 . Our study used the Wilks' Lambda value to test whether or not the means between the two groups (EMR exchanger and nonexchanger) were significantly different. The value of Wilks' Lambda (0.647) and Chi-square of 13.5 indicated that the research model had a significant effect in separating the two groups (p = 0.036). Using discriminant loading analysis can avoid the collinear problem and thus it is relatively stable in analyzing small samples. In general, the discriminant loading has to be greater than 0.3 to be significant. Among the six variables, that uncertainty, perceived benefits, influence, and reciprocal investments all were significant and had a loading greater than 0.3; they therefore contributed a significant influence in discriminating the two groups (see Table 4 ). Both EMR exchangers and non-exchangers considered trust and asset specificity as of average importance. Thus they had no effect on the willingness to implement cross-hospital EMR exchange; their discriminant loadings were À0.019 and À0.012, respectively.
