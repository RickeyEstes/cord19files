Due to the biosafety risk, MERS-CoV must be handled in a BSL-3 laboratory, whereas VLPs can be rapidly generated under BSL-2 conditions as an immunogen inducing high antibody titers. In addition, the horse provides little risk to humans and produces high antibody yields, making these animals an effective source for production of hyperimmune sera (Zheng et al., 2016) .
