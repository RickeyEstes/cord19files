Confluent Vero E6 cells grown in a 24-well culture plate were incubated with 100 CCID 50 SARS-CoV (which corresponds to 8.5 · 10 7 SARS-CoV genome copies) for 20 min. Intracellular levels of viral RNA were determined by quantitative RT-PCR every 30 min between 1 and 5 h post-infection and every 60 min between 6 and 12 h post-infection (Fig. 1A) . At least 4 replicate experiments were performed to determine the intracellular amount of viral RNA copies. After washing the Vero E6 cells 5 times with PBS, a remaining background of 3.4 · 10 4 copies per 10 6 cells was detected. From 1 to 5 h post-infection, the intracellular viral load remained nearly constant. A statistical significant (P < 0.05) increase in the number of intracellular RNA copies was first observed at 6 h post-infection. After this initial amplification, the titer of the intracellular viral RNA increased exponentially, reaching a titer of 9.6 · 10 6 RNA copies per 10 6 cells at 12 h post-infection. Extracellular levels of viral RNA in the cell supernatant were determined every 60 min by means of quantitative RT-PCR from 1 to 12 h post-infection (Fig. 1B) . Extracellular viral load quantitation was performed in at least 9 replicates. After washing the Vero E6 cells 5 times with PBS, the remaining background was determined to be 1.5 · 10 4 RNA copies/ml. From 1 to 6 h post-infection, the extracellular viral load remained nearly constant. A significant (P < 0.0001) increase in the number of extracellular viral RNA copies, i.e., a nearly 10-fold increase in viral RNA load from 4.0 · 10 4 to 2.8 · 10 5 genome equivalents/ml, was observed 7 h post-infection. After this initial extracellular raise, the viral RNA in the supernatant continued to increase, reaching viral RNA titers as high as 1.1 · 10 7 copies/ml at 12 h post-infection. Measuring viral RNA does not imply the presence of live virus. For this purpose, we determined the infectious viral titer of the supernatant collected at different time points post-infection (Fig. 2) . During the first 5 h, no infectious virus could be detected in the culture supernatant. Infectious progeny SARS-CoV first appeared in the supernatant 6 h post-infection at a low titer (2.1 · 10 1 CCID 50 /ml), and a larger proportion of infectious progeny virus appeared at 7 h post-infection, at a titer of 5.2 · 10 2 CCID 50 /ml. By 12 h post-infection, Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV had produced an infectious virus titer of 5.2 · 10 3 CCID 50 /ml. Our aim was to determine the kinetics and the length of one viral cycle of SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells. Our observations suggest that one replication cycle of the SARS-CoV takes 7 h to complete and that onset of intracellular RNA replication is at 6 h post-infection. When comparing the absolute increase of copies, we see that the difference between the initial viral RNA load and the viral load 12 h after infection is more definite extracellular than intracellular. Intracellular we distinguish a 3 · 10 2 -fold increase, while in extracellular a growth of 2 · 10 3 -fold is observed. When elucidating the mechanism of antiviral action of a particular antiviral compound, it is often important to be able to carry out so-called time-of-drug-addition assays. This time-of-drug-addition assay allows one to obtain a first rough idea about the step in the replication cycle at which the compound exerts its antiviral activity. Besides electron microscopic based information, no data about the growth of SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells were available. Our results provide further insights into the SARS-CoV replication cycle. An antiviral compound, which remains its antiviral activity at a time point of 6 h post-infection or later, is not likely to interfere with the attachment, penetration or replication of the genomic RNA, but rather with the processing of viral proteins, assembly or release of the virions.
