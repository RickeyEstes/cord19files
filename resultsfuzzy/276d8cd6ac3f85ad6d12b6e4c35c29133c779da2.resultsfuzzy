In this study real-time RPA and LFD-RPA were developed, and optimized to detect Brucella spp. in different animal samples. The target sequences selected for amplification were Brucella spp. bp26 for Realtime RPA amplification and IS711 for LFD-RPA amplification. These target sequences are conserved between the different species of Brucella and are generally used for PCR target gene assays [21] .
