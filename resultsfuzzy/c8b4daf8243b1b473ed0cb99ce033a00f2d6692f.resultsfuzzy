FIV peptides (N-acetylated and C-amidated) derived from the proximal membrane region of GP-36 have been assessed for antiviral activity [31] . Therefore N-acetylated and C-amidated, WEDWVGWI, AEDWVGVWI, WEDAVGWI, and WEDWV-GAI were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-FITC binding to FPR. Fig. 1 shows the effect of these peptides on binding to W190/N192, R190/K192, and R190/N192. Only WEDWVGWI exhibited appreciable inhibition similar to what Giannecchini et al. [31] observed for inhibition of viral infection by FIV inhibition. The dose dependence of WEDWVGWI, formyl-NleWEDWVGWI, and formyl-NleNleWEDWVGWI inhibition of formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-FITC binding to W190/N192, R190/ K192, and R190/N192 was determined. The results are shown in Table 1 . Thus the addition of a formyl-Nle had no affect on affinity and the addition of formyl-NleNle increased the affinity to FPR ∼ 2-fold. W190/N192 exhibited a ∼ 2 fold lower affinity for all three peptides. Since downregulation is a hallmark of receptor activation [33] and the trafficking of FPR expressed in CHO cells to endocytotic vesicles following treatment with fMLF has been thoroughly investigated [34] , we chose this assay as a highly precise way to evaluate ligand activation of receptor. Fig. 2A shows a time course of loss of surface receptor for the three FPR variants following treatment with 3 μM formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe. All exhibited t 1/2 of ∼ 5-6 min but W190/N192 downregulated to a lesser maximum extent. Fig. 2B shows recovery of surface receptor after treatment with formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe for 1 h. All three variants exhibited partial recovery of surface receptor after downregulation with slightly higher recovery observed with W190/N192. We then determined the peptides concentration dependent downregulation surface expression of the receptor to assess whether the peptides exhibited agonist, partial agonist, or antagonist activity. As we observed for other viral peptides [8] , WEDWVGWI did not cause any downregulation at concentrations up to 25 μM, but 25 μM WEDWVGWI inhibited the downregulation with 300 nM formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe by ∼ 50% in all three FPRs (data not shown). However, formyl-Nle-WEDWVGWI behaved as a partial agonist (Fig. 2B) when compared with formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe (Fig. 3A) . Only weak partial agonist activity was observed with W190/N192 (34 ± 3%, P b 0.0001 vs. either R190/K192 or R190/N192), and greater partial agonist activity was observed with R190/K192 (55 ± 2%) and R190/N192 (58 ± 4%). W190/N192 also exhibited a higher EC 50 for downregulation than R190/K192 or R190/N192 but the difference was not significant. Formyl-NleNleWEDWVGWI behaved as a full agonist for all three FPRs (Fig. 4A ), but the EC 50 for W190/N192 (300 ± 40 nM, P b 0.0001 vs. either R190/K192 or R190/N192) was 5-7 fold higher than either R190/K192 (40 ± 3 nM) or R190/N192 (60 ± 8 nM) despite the observation that the K i s differed by only two fold. The observed EC 50 s were more than 10 fold below the respective K i s for R190/K192 and R190/N192 and 3 fold below the K i of W190/R190, implying that formyl-NleNle-WEDWVGWI was 3 times more effective in activating R190/ K192 and R190/N192 than W190/N192. This large difference in EC 50 vs. K i is in marked contrast to what we observe with formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe (Fig. 3A) where the EC 50 s are similar to the K i s we previously reported [8] ; EC 50 = 175 ± 20 vs. K i = 160 ± 25 for W190/N192; EC 50 = 75 ± 5 vs. K i = 62 ± 8 for R190/K192; EC 50 = 50 ± 7 vs. K i = 67 ± 16 for R190/N192. Thus, formyl-NleNleWEDWVGWI appears to behave as a "super agonist" with R190/K192 and R190/N192, so that occupation of only 5% of the receptors is able to bring about the internalization of 50% of them. We also tested formyl-NleNleWEDAVGWI (Fig. 4B ) for its ability to cause downregulation of the receptor. Its behavior was essentially identical to that seen with formyl-NleNleWEDWVGWI. This is in contrast to WEDAVGWI which was N 10 fold weaker than WEDWVGWI in binding to the three FPRs. We also tested formyl-NleNleWED. This peptide exhibited very little downregulation at concentrations up to 50 μM with all three FPRs. Thus the VGWI portion of the peptide, formyl-NleNleWEDWVGWI, appears to be essential for FPR activation. We tested formyl-MYVKWPWYVWL, which we had previously shown to have essentially identical K i s for W190/N192, R190/K192 and R190/N190 [8] of 130 nM, for its ability to downregulate surface receptor (Fig. 5A) . R190/K192 exhibited the lowest EC 50 of 44 ± 4 nM about 3 fold below the observed K i and a maximum downregulation very similar (89%) to that seen with formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe (Fig. 3A ). R190/N192 had a 2 fold higher EC 50 (P = 0.005) than R190/K192 and maximum downregulation similar to that observed with formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe. W190/N192 had a EC 50 14 fold greater than K192/N192 (P = 0.0002) and 6 fold greater than R190/N192 (P = 0.0006) and a maximum downregulation slightly reduced (74%) compared to that seen with formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe. This reduction is consistent with the reduced (65%) stimulation of GTPγS binding of W190/ N192 FPR by 300 nM formyl-MYVKWPWYVWL compared to R190/K192 or R190/N192 FPRs reported previously [8] . We carried out a protein blastp search (http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/Blast.cgi?PAGE=Proteins&PROGRAM= blastp&BLAST_PROGRAMS=blastp&PAGE_TYPE= BlastSearch&SHOW_DEFAULTS=on) with the sequence MMWEDAVGWI (Nle is a oxidation resistant analog of M) to identify sequences which were most similar in sequence to formyl-NleNleWEDAVGWI. Bacteria (taxid:2) was used as the search organism. Two sequences of reasonable similarity to MMWEDAVGWI at their N-terminus were identified (Only Ntermini would be formylated). One was protein MAP 4176 from Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis and the other was protein JNB 01080 from Janibacter. Only the MAP 4176 sequence was investigated and it had MFEDAVAWF as its Nterminal sequence. Formyl-MFEDAVAWF was synthesized and evaluated for binding and downregulation. Formyl-MFEDA-VAWF's K i was 4 fold higher for W190/N192 than for R190/ K192 or R190/N192 (Table 1) . We also determined the EC 50 for downregulation. Formyl-MFEDAVAWF behaved as a full agonist with all three FPRs (Fig. 5B) and this peptide activates W190/N190 ∼10 fold more weakly than either R190/K192 or R190/N192. EC 50 s for W190/N192, R190/K192 and R190/ N192 were 13,000 ± 1000 nM, 1000 ± 80 nM, and 1500 ± 100 nM, respectively (P b 0.0001, W190/N192 vs. either R190/ K192 or R190/N192). Formyl-MFEDAVAWF exhibited some similarity to the N-terminus of CHIPS so we synthesized the peptide FTFEPFPTN, which corresponds to the N-terminus of CHIPS, and also formyl-MFTFEPFPTN. We tested commercially available CHIPS for its ability to inhibit formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-FITC binding but could not detect any inhibition at 50 nM with any of the FPR variants. FTFEPFPTN produced very little inhibition of formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-FITC binding also with at most 30% inhibition at 100 μM with the three FPR variants. Formyl-MFTFEPFPTN was very effective at inhibiting all three variants (Table 1 ) and exhibited significantly different K i s for W190/N192, R190/K192 and R190/N192 with K i s of 71 ± 4 nM, 16 ± 0.7 nM, and 9.5 ± 0.2 nM, respectively (P b 0.0001 for each variant vs. each of the other two). We also tested formyl-MFTFEPFPTN for its ability to downregulate W190/N192, R190/K192 and R190/N192 (Fig. 5C ). The EC 50 s were 19± 1 nM, 3.1 ± 0.2 nM, and 6.8 ± 100 nM, respectively (P b 0.0001 for each variant vs. each of the other two) and the maximum downregulation was very similar to that see with formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe. The addition of formyl-methionine to the N-terminus of FTFEPFPTN enhanced the affinity ∼10,000 fold, and formyl-MFTFEPFPTN exhibited an affinity similar to that seen with CHIPS (K d ∼35 nM) [11] . It should be noted that while CHIPS was originally isolated as a secreted protein from S. aureus [35] , many of the experiments were done using CHIPS expressed in Escherichia coli [10, 11, 36] , and the properties of FLIPr were determined only on the E. coli expressed protein [12] . E. coli expressed proteins would be expected to have an N terminal formyl-methionine. However, the authors noted no difference with the E. coli expressed CHIPS [11] .
