High levels of ZIKV RNA were detected in sperm isolated from the caudal epididymis at 7 d.p.i. and persisted until at least day 21 d.p.i. (Fig. 2a) . Sperm cells from ZIKV-infected mice stained positive for ZIKV antigen at 21 d.p.i (Fig. 2b ). At 7 d.p.i there was an increase in the percentage of fragmented sperm with dissociation of the sperm head from the tail in ZIKV-infected mice compared to uninfected mice (one-way ANOVA P ¼ 0.0473), and at 14 d.p.i., the majority of sperm harvested from infected mice were fragmented (Fig. 2c) . The mean total sperm counts in the ZIKV-infected mice at 21 d.p.i. were 29 Â 10 4 ml À 1 , thus significantly reduced compared to 48 Â 10 4 ml À 1 in the uninfected mice (Mann-Whitney test P ¼ 0.0022; Fig. 2d ). Moreover, the percentage of sperm that were motile (Fig. 2e ) and progressively motile (Fig. 2f) were significantly reduced in ZIKV-infected mice at 21 d.p.i. (one-way ANOVA P ¼ 0.0001). In ZIKV-infected mice the percentage progressive motility became increasingly diminished as the infection progressed. ZIKV prME protects against ZIKV-induced testis damage. In order to determine whether the vaccine could protect against ZIKV-induced damage to the male reproductive tract a ZIKV-prME DNA vaccination study was initiated. Five-week-old Ifnar1 À / À mice received two vaccinations by the i.m. route with electroporation-mediated DNA delivery at 2-week intervals with 25 mg of the control vector (pVax1) or ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine (ZV-prME). Mice were challenged 2 weeks after the second immunization with a total of 1 Â 10 6 p.f.u. of ZIKV strain PRVABC59 by the s.c. route. The testes and epididymis were harvested at 28 d.p.i. from sham-vaccinated and vaccinated mice and compared to testes obtained from age-matched phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) mock-infected and ZIKV-infected mice. Unvaccinated and sham-vaccinated mice that received a ZIKV challenge lost weight and 30% of the mice were euthanized due to weigh loss and other morbidity, including hind-limb paralysis ( Supplementary Fig. 3a-c) . Conversely, prME-vaccinated mice did not show signs of morbidity and mortality ( Supplementary Fig. 3a-c) , exhibiting normal pathology comparable to unchallenged control mice. Following ZIKV challenge, high ZIKV RNA loads were detected in the testes of unvaccinated and sham-vaccinated mice, but no detectable virus was present in the testes of the synthetic prME-vaccinated mice (Fig. 3a) . Moreover, there was an evident reduction in testis size (Fig. 3b) and weight (Fig. 3c ) in all unvaccinated and sham-vaccinated mice that received a ZIKV-challenge compared to the uninfected and prME-vaccinated mice (two-way ANOVA P ¼ 0.0001). The testis size (Fig. 3b) and weight (Fig. 3c) were not significantly different in sham-vaccinated compared to untreated-infected mice. Histopathological analysis revealed that unvaccinated or sham-vaccinated mice exposed to ZIKV suffered severe damage to the testis with the normal architecture disrupted Figure 1 | ZIKV infection of the testis and epididymis. Ten-to eleven-week-old male Ifnar1 À / À mice were inoculated with 5 Â 10 5 p.f.u of ZIKV strain PRVABC59 by a subcutaneous route (s.c.) into each hind leg (1 Â 10 6 p.f.u. total) and compared to PBS mock-infected mice (n ¼ 6). The testes and epididymides were collected at the indicated d.p.i. (a) ZIKV RNA copies in the testis of mice measured by quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR. Results are expressed as genome equivalents per gram of tissue. The horizontal hatched line indicates the limit of detection (o100 copies per ml). ARTICLE with massive loss of seminiferous tubules and replacement by fibrous tissue and inflammatory cells, whereas prME-vaccinated mice showed normal phenotypes as for uninfected control mice ( Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 3d,e) . The epididymal lumens of prME-vaccinated mice appeared unremarkable; however, the unvaccinated and sham-vaccinated mice contained primarily necrotic debris and degenerated cells (Fig. 3e ). Viral antigen staining was observed within the epididymal lumens of unvaccinated and sham-vaccinated mice, but no staining was detected in prME-vaccinated mice (Fig. 3e) . Immune cell infiltrates into the testes consisting of CD4 þ , CD8 þ and NK cells ( Supplementary Fig. 3d ) and macrophages ( Supplementary  Fig. 3e ) were observed in unvaccinated, but not prME-vaccinated mice exposed to ZIKV. At 77 d.p.i. the weight of the testes of unvaccinated and sham-vaccinated infected mice were significantly reduced compared to both mock-infected and prME-vaccinated infected mice, respectively (one-way ANOVA P ¼ 0.0001) ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). ZIKV prME protects against ZIKV-induced damage to sperm. High levels of ZIKV RNA were detected in sperm isolated from the caudal epididymis of unvaccinated and sham-vaccinated mice exposed to ZIKV, but signals from mock-infected and prME-vaccinated mice for these tissues were below the limit of detection of the assay (Fig. 4a) . Sperm cells from unvaccinated and sham-vaccinated ZIKV-infected mice stained positive for ZIKV antigen at 28 d.p.i, although most cells were negative, whereas sperm cells from mock-infected and prME-vaccinated mice were all negative (Fig. 2b) . We observed that the percentage of fragmented sperm with dissociation of the sperm head from the tail was significantly elevated in ZIVK-exposed unvaccinated and sham-vaccinated mice, compared to prME-vaccinated mice (Fig. 4b,c ; one-way ANOVA P ¼ 0.0464). Moreover, the prME vaccine fully protected against the reduction in total sperm counts ( Fig. 4d ; one-way ANOVA P ¼ 0.0443), motile sperm ( Fig. 4e ; one-way ANOVA P ¼ 0.0153, Supplementary Movie 1), and progressively motile sperm ( Fig. 4f ; one-way ANOVA P ¼ 0.0048). At 77 d.p.i. sperm parameters still had not returned to initial levels in unvaccinated and sham-vaccinated mice while the mock-infected and prME-vaccinated mice continued to have normal sperm parameters ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). There was no statistical difference in the level of ZIKV RNA in sperm or with any of the sperm parameters between the sham-vaccinated and infected mice.
