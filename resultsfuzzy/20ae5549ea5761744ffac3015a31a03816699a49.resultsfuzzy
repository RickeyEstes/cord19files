Given that disruption of PD-1:PD-L1 signaling augmented IFN-γ production by anti-viral CD8 T cells in vitro, we hypothesized that PD-1 could be playing a role in controlling neuroinflammation in vivo. Upregulation of MHC class II expression on microglia is a commonly used indicator of neuroinflammation (9, 51, 52) . Comparing MHC class II expression on microglia from brains of MuPyV infected WT and PD-L1 −/− mice, we found significantly higher I-A b (MHC class II) surface expression on microglia from PD-L1 −/− mice at 8 dpi ( Figure 3A) ; however, by 45 dpi MHC II expression levels on microglia of WT and PD-L1 −/− mice were comparable ( Figure 3B) . These data point toward an acute-to-persistent infection phase remission of the heightened inflammatory environment in the PD-L1 −/− mice. Furthermore, we found that brain microglia from mice that were adoptively transferred with IFN-γ-sufficient MuPyV-specific TCR transgenic CD8 T cells upregulated I-A b expression, but no I-A b upregulation was seen in mice that received IFN-γ deficient-transgenic TCR CD8 T cells ( Figure 3C) . These data support the likelihood that IFN-γ released by CNS-infiltrating, virus-specific CD8 T cells contributes to neuroinflammation during MuPyV encephalitis. To obtain a more comprehensive view of the role of PD-1 signaling in controlling neuroinflammation, NanoString gene expression analysis using a 254 gene mouse inflammation panel was performed on brains from acutely (8 dpi) and persistently (35 dpi) infected mice. At 8 dpi, a higher number of genes were upregulated in PD-L1 −/− (50 genes) vs. WT mice (25 genes) ( Figure 4A) . However, in persistent infection, the inflammatory landscape profoundly changed, and did so differently between WT and PD-L1 −/− mice. For example, in WT mice, a number of genes were uniquely expressed in the 8 dpi and 35 dpi datasets. In contrast, the gene set upregulated in PD-L1 −/− mice at 35 dpi represented a subset of those same genes that were upregulated at 8 dpi (Figures 4B,C) . These differences were further reinforced by principal component analysis (PCA) which showed that the inflammatory gene expression profile in the brains of WT mice at 35 dpi were significantly different from both uninfected as well as 8 dpi WT mice (Figure 4D) . These observations suggest that the neuroinflammatory environment changes considerably over the course of MuPyV infection in the WT mice, while PD-L1 −/− mice show fewer differences between acute and persistent infection. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) revealed major differences in the neuroinflammation signaling pathways in MuPyV-infected WT and PD-L1 −/− mice. A heightened inflammatory state is indicated in PD-L1 −/− mice by engagement of pathways involved in interferon signaling, dendritic cell maturation and recognition by Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) at 8 dpi ( Figure 5A) . Conversely, at 35 dpi the neuroinflammation FIGURE 5 | PD-1 signaling alters inflammatory pathways in the brain during MuPyV infection.

These data provide further evidence for a sustained inflammatory response in WT mice but not in PD-L1 −/− mice. Using upstream regulator analysis of IPA, we found that TNF-α and IFN-γ, mediator of CD8 T cell effector function and other inflammatory mediators like IL-15, IL-21, NOS2, STAT1, and NF-κB had higher z-score and -log(p-value) at 35 dpi in PD-L1 −/− mice than WT mice (Supplementary Figure 3) . These data suggest that PD-1 protects against neuroinflammation during acute MuPyV infection, but paradoxically, ablation of this signaling pathways results in failure to sustain an inflammatory response during persistent infection. Lack of PD-1 signaling due to genetic ablation of PD-L1 resulted in an increased fraction of CD103 + MuPyV-specific CD8 bT RM but did not affect virus levels. CD103 expression has been associated with improved functionality in CD8 T RM cells (56) . To test bT RM recall responsiveness, we re-inoculated >45 dpi WT and PD-L1 −/− mice i.c. with MuPyV and compared their ability to control this homologous virus challenge. Five days after re-inoculation, persistently infected WT and PD-L1 −/− mice showed similar increases in numbers of total CD8 T cells, but significantly more D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells were seen only in the brains of the re-infected WT mice ( Figure 7A) . The difference between total and virus-specific CD8 T cell numbers in the re-infected WT mice suggested that this increase was predominantly due to recall expansion of anti-MuPyV CD8 bT RM rather than recruitment. Importantly, re-infected PD-L1 −/− mice had an ∼87-fold increase in virus load in the brain, whereas WT mice showed roughly a 6-fold increase in virus levels ( Figure 7B ). D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells from the brains of WT and PD-L1 −/− mice at day 5 post-challenge also exhibited similar abilities to produce IFN-γ and degranulate (e.g., CD107a/b + ) upon LT359 peptide stimulation ( Figure 7C) . The recall response upon re-infection was mainly due to the activation of CD103 + cells, as only CD103 + cells showed high proliferative potential as indicated by their Ki67 expression. We also observed a moderate decrease in Ki67 + cells in PD-L1 −/− mice ( Figure 7D) . These observations are in line with data in Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure 3 , showing PD-1 signaling deficiency results in failure to sustain an inflammatory environment, resulting in poorer virus control. Moreover, these data support the likelihood that neuroinflammatory factors induced by PD-1 signaling are required to maintain immunologic defense against resurgence of a persistent viral encephalitis.
