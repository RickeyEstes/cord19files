All piglets challenged with 7 × 10 6 copies of K14JB01 developed diarrhea. The PEDV copy number increased significantly (up to 10 7 copies) in fecal samples taken at 1 dpc, and decreased gradually thereafter. The PEDV copy numbers in the fecal samples were as follows: 10 7.06±1.24 at 1 dpc, 10 6.69±1.33 at 2 dpc, 10 5.68±1.13 at 3 dpc, 10 5.06±1.37 at 4 dpc, and 10 4.98±1.25 at 5 dpc. The piglets also suffered severe dehydration, resulting in mortality. The death rates were as follows: 0% (0/9) at 1 dpc, 22.2% (2/9) at 2 dpc, 33.3% (3/9) at 3 dpc, 44.4% (4/9) at 4 dpc, and 66.7% (6/9) at 5 dpc (Table 1 ). The IC assay showed that all piglets were PEDV-negative prior to challenge. All fecal samples obtained on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 post-challenge generated strong bands in the IC assay.
