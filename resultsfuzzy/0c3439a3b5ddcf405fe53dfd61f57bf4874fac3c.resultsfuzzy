The prevalence of viral respiratory tract infections in tested patients differed between suspected CAP and HAP, and between patients admitted in and outside the influenza season (Table 2 ). In the influenza season, viruses were found in 65 of 190 (34%) of suspected CAP patients, and in 17 of 50 (34%) of suspected HAP patients. Outside the influenza season, 17 of 92 (19%) suspected CAP patients and 7 of 45 (16%) suspected HAP patients tested positive for at least 1 virus. In the influenza season, the most prevalent pathogen was influenza virus (26 of 190 (14%) in suspected CAP and 5 of 49 (10%) in suspected HAP). Outside the influenza season, influenza virus was not found. Ordering of virus tests was mostly performed on the day of ICU admission, in both suspected CAP and HAP cases (Fig. 2) . In all patients that were tested for influenza virus, the results of the test changed antiviral prescription in 157/367 (43%) of patients: in 149 of 158 (94%) patients oseltamivir treatment was discontinued after a negative test, and in 8 of 9 (89%) patients without empirical antiviral treatment, oseltamivir was started after a positive test result.
