Overall, both platforms exhibited high sensitivity for detecting known pathogens in the validation panel. All runs were valid according to the specifications for the negative, positive and extraction controls. The FTD platform detected 100 true positives out of 104 total possible pathogens and TAC detected 92 true positives out of 99 total possible pathogens (totals were adjusted to account for the availability of different targets in the two tests: the FTD platform did not include Legionella targets; the TAC platform did not include Staphylococcus aureus, parainfluenza virus type 4, coronavirus 229E or coronavirus OC43 targets). The overall sensitivity was 96.1% and 92.9% for FTD and TAC, respectively, which is closely aligned to the 100% sensitivity that has been reported for FTD and the 89% overall sensitivity that has been previously reported for TAC (Kodani et al., 2011; Prill et al., 2012; Weinberg et al., 2013) . Among the clinical specimens (N = 149), a total of 163 and 216 positive results were detected by the FTD and TAC assays, respectively. Percent agreement was high (N90%) for all but three of the pathogen targets (Table 3) . Of those three (rhinovirus, enterovirus and S. pneumoniae), only rhinovirus and S. pneumoniae showed statistically significant differences. TAC detected 49 rhinovirus positive results whereas the FTD platform detected 18. Similarly, TAC detected 90 positive S. pneumoniae results whereas the FTD platform detected 75 in the same specimen set. The average Ct value of Rhinovirus positive and S. pneumoniae positive results detected by TAC but not by the FTD platform was 28.8 and 32.4, respectively. With the exception of S. pneumoniae and rhinovirus, fewer than 10% of the specimens tested positive for any of the 13 pathogens.
