Our initial attempt at determining a common motif of conserved peptide sequences in the L1 gene of HPV, of all types available in our database as given in Table 1 , met with little success. While signals for low variability were observed, these were heavily influenced by the preponderance of HPV16 data in our database; in fact, detailed inspection of the peptide stretches corresponding to the signal regions showed little homology between HPV16 and HPV18 sequences. This is observable from the nucleotide plots also (Fig. 2) , which shows close similarity between HPV16, HPV33, and HPV35, and between HPV18 and HPV45, but the two groups have distinctly different plots, indicating significant differences in base distribution. In our previous analyses for vaccine targets, we had considered large numbers of sequences of only one primary type, viz., the neuraminidase 19 and hemagglutinin 21 of influenza A genomes, or VP7 proteins of rotavirus. 20 In the present instance, we have to consider different types of the HPV where the similarities within sequences of each type are greater than similarities between sequences of different types; we note that, as remarked by Chen et al. 39 , if the difference of the L1 gene of a cloned sequence from any other characterized type becomes 10% or more, a new type is claimed to have been established, else these are all strains of the same type group. The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) shows explicitly that the strains of each type belong to individual groups and the different types form separate clades: the HPV18 and 45 belong to one clade and HPV16, 33, and 35 to another. The 2D graphs (Fig. 2 ) also show at a glance the close similarities between HPV16, 33, and 35, and also between HPV18 and 45, and indications of where the two groups are different. Thus, our earlier experience could not be repeated here, which has to be considered as intertype differences. However, there can be large differences within a type too: eg, HPV type 16 from Iran (KM058666) and African type 2 variant (AF472509) are quite different, but because these are dsDNA types of viruses, we expect they will be regionally, ie, within the population groups, stable. Considering the preponderance of data, only the former variety of HPV16 and related sequences were used for our analyses. The analyses for the three high-risk types, HPV16, 33, and 35, were done together using the p R technique mentioned in the "Materials and methods" section with a 12 aa window, and the p R -values at each aa position were scanned to determine the number of different values. These numbers were then smoothed over a range of 12 positions, and a running average computed over the complete sequence. Next, ASA profiles were determined for several samples of the selected HPV types using the SABLE server, which has been found to be quite reliable. Taking an average of the solvent accessibility numbers determined residuewise for each sequence from SABLE, and then taking the running average of 12 aa, we get a smoothed out solvent accessibility profile whose peaks indicate highest solvent accessibility around that residue position. By our logic, the regions where the lowest variety numbers for aa stretches match with the highest values of the ASA profiles represent potentially the best situated highly conserved surface accessible peptide segments in the protein sequence. Figure 3 shows the plots of these two profiles of the high-risk HPV16, 33, and 35 types, where the five regions so identified are marked by short horizontal lines for further analysis. To identify in terms of aas the regions we had determined in the varieties vs ASA profiles, we scanned the aa sequences of the HPV16, 33, and 35 of those regions. The three HPV types were found to have very close similarities in the peptide stretches, extending, in fact, to several aas beyond the 12 aa windows. aa variety vs ASA profile curves were also drawn similarly for HPV18 and HPV45 and appropriate peptide segments were identified. Table 2 lists the peptides for all identified segments for the five high-risk HPV types, and also of the low-risk HPV11 determined by a similar method. Since the HPV virion capsomers are composed of five L1 proteins, and one L2 each, it is possible that a surface accessible antigen in one protein may get covered by the folds of a neighboring protein. Step three of our search for vaccine target regions is to verify the surface accessibility of the identified regions through protein crystal structure. For this exercise, we used 2R5H for HPV16, 2R5I for HPV18, 2R5J for HPV35, and 2R5K for HPV11 available from the Protein Data Bank and individually checked for each of the regions in space-fill models; since no structure was available for HPV33 and HPV45, detailed comparison had to be omitted here. Figures 4-7 (HPV16, HPV18, HPV35 , and HPV11, respectively) give snapshots of the identified peptides highlighted in yellow in one of the proteins of the pentameric structure of the capsid assembly. In the case of region 1 of HPV16, which was surface accessible for a solitary HPV protein, this peptide stretch is almost entirely covered by the adjacent protein and, therefore, has to be rejected as a vaccine target candidate. Region 2 was found to be entirely viable. In the case of regions 3 and 4, the original 12 aa stretches were found to be surface situated, but 5 aas at the 5â€²-end were found to be covered by the neighboring residues, ie, even if these extended segments belong to a group of conserved residues, the parts beyond the original 12aa stretches are not viable as candidate vaccine targets. Interestingly, the two regions, 3 and 4, are on two sides of the protein, but both are surface accessible. These segments that are not available for consideration as potential vaccine targets are marked in red in Table 2 . Region 5 listed in the table could not be tested in a similar manner due to the nonavailability of these stretches in the protein crystals. Notes: these are listed regionwise to show peptide segment similarities. the segments marked in red are covered by neighboring proteins/sequence overlaps. since HPV33 crystal structure was not available, overlap regions could not be ascertained, but can be expected to be similar to those for HPV35; similar considerations applied to HPV45 compared with HPV18. The next stage is to determine if the identified regions have epitope potential to enable immune response. For this, we used the IEDB server to test for T-cell MHC II epitope regions using two alleles, namely, HLA-DRB1-01-01 and HLA-DRB1-04-01. Table 3 shows that all the regions we had identified passed the MHC II test, although in some instances one or the other allele gave results that were just outside the permissible range for generating immune response. However, none of the regions of any of the three HPV types failed in both alleles. Likewise, we tested for B-cell humoral response through the ABCpred server, which has been known to predict epitope regions for B-cell response with about 66% accuracy. As can be seen from the results extracted in Table 4 , we find that in this instance all our regions passed this test with high acceptability ranks, except for region 4 for HPV35 whose score was outside the critical range. Both, linear and conformational epitopes, are found on the L1 protein surface, but it is well established that most of the neutralizing antibody production are through conformational epitopes. 27, 40 Ludmerer et al. 41 showed that a distinct surface-exposed linear epitope overlaps the neighboring conformational epitope in both HPV11 and HPV16 VLPs and that neutralizing epitopes also bind to a linear epitope. Combita et al. 42 experimenting with mice model confirmed the existence of linear epitopes inducing cross-neutralization, but also inferred that such cross-neutralization will not exceed 1% of the effects of the dominant conformational epitopes. Type-specific and cross-reactive linear epitopes have been determined on the L2 protein surface also, 43 but for the present purposes, we restrict our analyses to the L1 protein epitopes only. Our tests above identified linear epitopes but since the papillomavirus L1 proteins have mostly conformational epitopes, we tested for discontinuous epitopes on the aa sequences also through Ellipro available in the IEDB web server. We found that for all the HPV types we investigated, almost all the identified peptides had overlaps with the conformational epitopes. The figure 5. Display in space-fill rendering of HPV18 L1 protein pentameric structure (2R5I). The conserved surface-exposed segments identified by comparison of protein variability and ASA profile analysis as given in Table 2 peptides that had the overlaps are marked in Table 5 . Table 5 also shows the percentile rank of binding affinity for HLA for MHC Class I predicted by the IEDB server; a number of peptide regions show low ranks, which indicate high binding affinity. The remaining test was envisaged for autoimmune possibilities. In the protein-protein BLAST analysis using the nonredundant protein sequences from GenBank, PDB, SWISSPROT, etc., the results were found to match the super papillomavirus family with no matches with any non-HPV protein. The final list of identified peptide stretches that met all our criteria and could serve as potential peptide vaccine targets are given in Table 5 . We have ended up with four possible surface accessible highly conserved peptide regions in each of the HPV16, 18, 33, 35, 45 , and HPV11, with some being common to several types. Some show less binding affinities in T-cell or B-cell activity, other regions appear to have purely linear epitopes with no overlaps with any discontinuous epitopes, but by and large, every peptide segment identified in this exercise show prospects of eliciting immune response; in some instances, cross-neutralization between types seem possible. What would be required, however, are wet laboratory experiments and adjuvant combinations to validate this model of alternate strategies and improve and expand upon the possible multivalent peptide vaccine approach to the prevention of HPV-induced cancers. cervical, genital, and other cancers and the sufferings these cause, and the large variety of the virus, such preparations are to be strongly advocated. Notes: "Y" represents acceptable binding affinities. The discontinuous epitopes for HPV18 could not be determined due to mismatch with homologs.
