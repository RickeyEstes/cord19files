The persistent nature of neurotropic TS43 in culture may reflect the delayed mechanism of primary demyelination in rat brain. This system will allow a detailed analysis of the effect of viral persistence upon specialized glial functions including myelin maintenance. 


Section:cells infected with wt or ts43 fuse to form syncytia, whereas pl infects only scattered single cells.. wt infects all cells by ten days, ts43 by 4 weeks and pl does not spread substantially even after 4 weeks. after cultures are clear of glial cells, fibroblasts repopulate the dish, apparently resistant to viral infection. these results reveal differences in direct virus-glial cell interactions of 3 strains of jhm corona virus and parallel the findings in the infected rats.
