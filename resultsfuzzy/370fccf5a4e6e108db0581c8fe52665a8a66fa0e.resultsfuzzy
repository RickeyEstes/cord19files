, or spinal cord (C) of infected mice at day 28 p.i. were stimulated for 5 days under various conditions including: 1) CpG, 2) irradiated feeders pre-incubated with viral lysate, 3) CpG with irradiated feeders, or 4) CpG with irradiated feeders pre-incubated with viral lysate. After culture, virus-specific IgG secreting ASC were enumerated by ELISPOT using virus coated plates. Pre-existing ASC numbers were determined by 4 h (h) direct ex vivo ELISPOT. Data represents the mean ± SEM ASC per 10 6 cells based on cells plated prior to CpG stimulation from 3 to 4 pooled mice. ASC frequencies per animal were determined using the average frequencies of 3-5 wells showing spots within linear dilution range. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments. Significant differences between conditions at 4 h and 5 days indicated by * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001, and **** p ≤ 0.0001. for 5 days in the absence of feeders decreased ASC recovery compared to direct ex vivo ELISPOT analysis suggesting feeders provide survival factors. The same in vitro stimulation method used for JHMV immune splenocytes was applied to analyze virus-specific IgG Bmem in brain and spinal cord following intracranial JHMV infection. Moreover, surface IgG + CD138 − B cells indicative of Bmem are detectable at day 28 p.i. during persisting JHMV infection (Phares et al., 2014) . To examine Bmem specificity, single cell suspensions from brains and spinal cords at day 28 p.i. were serially diluted and stimulated under optimal conditions previously determined for splenic B cells using CpG for 5 days in the presence of irradiated feeders with or without viral lysate. Cells were then transferred to ELISPOT plates and assessed for virus-specific IgG ASC (Fig. 2B) . We focused on IgG as the vast majority (∼70%) of isotype switched virus specific ASC in the CNS secrete IgG isotype Ab, with a minor contribution of IgA secreting ASC (Tschen et al., 2002) . Pre-existing virus-specific ASC were measured in a direct 4 h ex vivo ELISPOT assay. In contrast to splenocytes, neither brain or spinal cord cells revealed Bmem to ASC conversion, as indicated by no increase in spots relative to the numbers obtained from direct ex vivo ELISPOT analysis. This finding was independent of addition of viral lysate. Rather than increasing, virus-specific ASC after CpG stimulation were actually 3-fold lower in the brain (∼1 × 10 3 ASC) and 2-fold lower in the SC (∼2 × 10 3 ASC) relative to pre-existing ASC (Fig. 2B,C) . This suggested that cell death during strong stimulation and prolonged culture of CNS cells or loss in the washing/transfer procedure leads to premature attrition of pre-existing ASC. This is supported by studies with LCMV, which have suggested direct ex vivo ASC assays may yield higher ASC frequencies than those observed after prolonged culture, thereby complicating calculations and potentially underestimating ASC converted from Bmem (Slifka and Ahmed, 1996b) .
