In addition to using P58 IPK2/2 mice to determine the role of P58 IPK during influenza virus infection, we were also interested in determining whether these mice could provide new insight into the unusually high virulence of the virus responsible for the 1918 influenza pandemic. Infection with 5610 6 PFU of r1918 resulted in the death of all P58 IPK2/2 mice by day 4 post infection and the death of all wild-type animals by day 7 ( Figure 6A ). This corresponded to an LD 50 of 10 1.8 PFU for P58 IPK2/2 mice and 10 2.5 PFU for wild-type mice. Similar to PR8, wild-type mice required five times the dose of r1918 to achieve fifty percent mortality, as compared to P58 IPK2/2 mice. The increased mortality of P58 IPK2/2 mice was again not due to differences in Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis was performed on a sample set derived from P58 IPK2/2 and wild-type mice infected with the PR8 strain of influenza virus in triplicate at 1 day post infection. All infected samples were compared to genotype-matched mock-infected samples via microarrays analysis. Replicate samples were then in silico error-weighted pooled and re-ratioed to compare P58 IPK2/2 gene expression to wild-type gene expression. Following GSEA analysis using only those genes which were significantly regulated, the top gene ontology categories related to the immune response were selected (see Figure S7 for entire table). An edge is placed between gene ontology categories if they share common genes, and the edge's thickness increases as the number of common genes increases. The log 10 ratio of P58 IPK to wild-type gene regulation is noted for selected gene ontology categories. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000438.g004 viral load, since viral titers were nearly identical in P58 IPK2/2 and wild-type mice ( Figure 6B ). Microscopic examination revealed lung pathology similar to that reported previously [22, 30] . We then used global gene expression profiling to determine the transcriptional response of P58 IPK2/2 mice to infection with r1918 and to evaluate similarities and differences in the host response to r1918 and PR8. We began our analysis by comparing lung gene expression profiles of r1918-infected and mock-infected P58 IPK2/2 mice and selecting for genes that were expressed at a higher level during virus infection. We then determined which genes among this group were expressed at a lower level in r1918infected wild-type mice. Because these genes were induced in P58 IPK2/2 mice in response to virus infection, but were expressed at a lower level in virus-infected wild-type mice, the infectioninduced expression of these genes appears to be impacted by the presence or absence of P58 IPK . This same analysis path was then used to analyze the gene expression data generated from the PR8 infections described above, again resulting in a set of infection-induced genes, the expression of which appears to be impacted by the presence or absence of P58 IPK . Of the annotated genes in this set, 65 were also present in the final set of genes identified from the r1918 virus infection data. The majority of these genes (47 of 65) are associated with inflammatory, immune response, and cell-death pathways and their expression patterns in P58 IPK2/2 and wild-type mice are shown in Figure 7A . Because these genes were all expressed at a higher level in P58 IPK2/2 mice, they may therefore be associated with the increased pathology and mortality rate observed in these animals. However, of particular interest are the set of genes present in the middle panel of this Figure, which were induced in P58 IPK2/2 mice in response to infection with either PR8 or r1918, but which were induced in wild-type mice only in response to the r1918 virus. To evaluate the functional relationships of these genes more closely, we used Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) to create a network of the set of genes in the middle of Figure 7A , showing direct or indirect interactions reported for these cell-death-and inflammatory-response-related genes ( Figure 7B ). The network is centered around tumor necrosis factor (Tnf), which is interesting because activation of Tnf-related pathways has been shown to be associated with H5N1 influenza viral infections of macrophages [31] . This pattern of expression suggests that these genes may also contribute to the exceptional virulence of the r1918 virus, but,
