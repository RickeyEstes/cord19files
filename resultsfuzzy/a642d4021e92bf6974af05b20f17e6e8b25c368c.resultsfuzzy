Viral or atypical bacterial pathogens were detected in 348/ 407 (85?5%) NPAs. The most commonly identified pathogens were RSV (37?3% of patients), AdV (24?8%), hRV (18?9%), hBoV (18?7%), hMPV (10?3%) and Mpp (9?8%) [ Figure 1 ]. Parainfluenza viruses were identified in 8?4% of samples with PIV3 representing the majority (4?9%). Coronaviruses were found in 3?2% of samples with OC43 being commonest (1?7%). The commonest pathogens in single infections (n = 187; 45?9% total samples) were RSV (43?3%) and hRV (18?2%) with AdV and hBoV comprising a much smaller percentage (8?6% and 4?8% respectively) [ Figure 2 ]. Co-infection with two or more pathogens was present in 161 samples (39?6%). Two pathogens were detected in 124 (30?5%) samples, three pathogens in 33 (8?1%) samples,
