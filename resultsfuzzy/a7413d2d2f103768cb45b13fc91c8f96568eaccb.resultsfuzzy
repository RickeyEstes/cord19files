Design and Synthesis of c-exNDIs. We have designed and synthesized a small library of new and water-soluble c-exNDIs (2−11, Scheme 2), where the NDI core has been merged to the dihydrobenzophenazine polynuclear heterocycle (highlighted in red in Scheme 1). The choice has been made based on the pK a values of the N,N-dimethylpropan-amine side chains: the pK a values are above 7 (pK a1 = 8.1, pK a2 = 8.6), 52 suggesting that the side chains are mainly protonated under physiological conditions. This aspect ensures good solubilizing properties, reducing self-aggregations. We discharged the shorter N,N-dimethylthyl-amine side chains, as their pK a values are much lower (pK a1 = 5.6, pK a2 = 7.4). The c-exNDIs are structurally characterized by a larger flat core than the NDIs. This feature should improve π-stacking interaction implementing the binding to the G4. Indeed, DFT calculation performed at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory in gas phase indicated that the dimension of the c-exNDI core supported a more extensive overlap to the quartet of the G4 structure (Supporting Information, Figure S1 ). Enhancement of the ligand steric hindrance accessing the outside G4 quartets might offer an opportunity to implement selectivity as well. Furthermore, the proposed structural extension on the NDI scaffold should merge the useful optoelectronic properties (absorption, emission, and singlet oxygen sensitizer) of functionalized NDIs to those of substituted dihydrobenzophenazines. Compounds with both H and Br substituents at the Y position were considered to evaluate the effect of a bulky substituent (Br) at this position. To synthesize the c-exNDIs, we developed the synthetic protocol highlighted in Scheme 2. According to published methods, the imidation reaction of the readily available 2,6-dibromo-1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride yielded the 2,6-dibromo-substituted NDI, under acidic conditions, in almost quantitative yield. Subsequently, a two-step protocol starting from a nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S N Ar) in the presence of an excess (2.5 equiv) of ortho-diaminophenyl derivatives in DMF as solvent at 70°C for 16 h afforded a 60:40 mixture of monobrominated and debrominated products in an overall quantitative yield. The ring closing reaction following the S N Ar in one pot (step a, in Scheme 2) occurred through a Tchitchibabin mechanism, with the elimination of hydride favored by the formation of a sixmembered ring. The second S N Ar on the remaining aromatic bromide was carried out by dissolving 3 in neat N 1 ,N 1dimethylpropane-1,3-diamine. To improve the reaction yield, we optimized a microwave-assisted protocol (150°C, 200 psi, 250 bar, 200 W, 3 min, sealed reaction vessels) to give product 9, which crystallized from the reaction mixture. We achieved the synthesis of the permanently charged quaternary ammonium salts 10 and 11 with a classical exhaustive methylation, in the presence of MeI at rt for 16 h. All the synthesized ligands (2−11) were purified by preparative HPLC (CH 3 CN:H 2 O and 0.1% CF 3 COOH as eluent). Further anion exchange yielded 2−9 as hydrochloride salts. On the contrary, 10 and 11 were investigated as iodide quaternary ammonium salts. c-exNDIs Greatly Stabilize G4 with a Preference for the LTR Conformations vs the Telomeric Sequence. To detect the ability of the new c-exNDIs to bind and stabilize the G4 conformations of the HIV-1 LTR promoter, two G4forming LTR sequences were employed: LTR-III and LTR-IV, both composed of four GGG tracts ( Figure 1A ). When embedded within the full-length G-rich sequence of the LTR promoter, LTR-III is the most stable G4, while LTR-IV folds when induced by G4 ligands. 27 A FRET melting assay was performed to assess the degree of stabilization of the LTR-III and LTR-IV G4 by c-exNDIs. The minimal intramolecular G4forming human telomeric (hTel) sequence ( Figure 1A ) was employed to evaluate the activity of the c-exNDIs on one of the most highly represented and accessible cellular G4: in fact, the TTAGGG repeat is present as 2000−3000 double-stranded (ds) and 50−200 single-stranded sequences at the human telomeres. 53 A double-stranded (ds) DNA was also added to address specificity toward the G4 conformation (Supporting Information, Table S1 ). While this kind of assay is typically performed using molar excess of the tested compounds, we here initially employed equimolar amounts of the target DNA sequence and compounds (i.e., 0.25 μM) to better differentiate the stabilization efficiency among the different c-exNDIs. The melting temperatures of the LTR-III, LTR-IV, hTel, and dsDNA G4 conformations were sufficiently similar (66.9, 61.9, 66.9, and 66.5°C, respectively) to allow a meaningful comparison. In the presence of the c-exNDIs, a marked increase in the stabilization of the G4-forming oligonucleotides was observed ( Figure 1B and Supporting Information, Table  S2 ). Among the tested c-exNDIs, 2, 3, 4, 10, and 11 were the most efficient ligands, with a stabilization on LTR-IV G4 of 10−16°C at equimolar amounts. At 4-fold c-exNDI:DNA molar ratio, the stabilization increased to above 25°C, which is the maximum increase measurable in these settings (data not shown). The other c-exNDIs showed intermediate (4°C ≤ ΔT m < 7°C, 5, 6, and 7), or low (ΔT m < 4°C, 8 and 9) level of stabilization on LTR-IV G4. Compounds 2 and 10 stabilized LTR-III G4 above 10°C. Among the G4 structures, hTel G4 was the least efficiently stabilized, whereas stabilization on dsDNA was negligible. Only compounds 10 and 11 displayed a significant stabilization on dsDNA, indicating that the presence of two permanent charges (the quaternary ammonium moieties) favors an unspecific binding to the negatively charged nucleic acid. In general, the H series of all derivatives (Y = H, 2, 4, 6, 10; Scheme 2) was more active and more selective for the viral G4s compared to the Br substituted ones (Y = Br, 3, 5, 7, 8; Scheme 2). Compounds 2, 3, and 10 exhibited a difference in stabilization of LTR-IV G4s vs hTel G4 equal or above 6°C, which roughly corresponds to 40% of the overall stabilization efficiency ( Figure 1B and Supporting Information, Table S2 ). Because oligonucleotides used for FRET analysis display fluorophore-modified ends that may influence the measured stabilization, additional techniques using label-free oligonucleotides were employed. Compound 2, a representative of the best ligands, was assayed by circular dichroism (CD) on LTR-IV, LTR-III, and hTel G4s. At 4:1 c-exNDI:DNA ratio, a stabilization higher than 27°C was obtained on both LTR-III and LTR-IV (Supporting Information, Figures S2A and S2B ), while hTel G4s was stabilized by only 19.9°C (Supporting Information, Figure S2C ), confirming a preference for the viral G4s. A Taq polymerase stop assay was performed on the LTR-III, LTR-IV, and hTel templates. A control template unable to fold into G4 was used to exclude unspecific inhibition of the polymerase enzyme by the c-exNDI. Compound 2 induced an intense stop site at the most 3′ G tract in each G4-forming template ( Figure 1C ), indicating effective stabilization of the G4 conformation by the compound. This effect was significantly more relevant on the viral sequences vs the
