In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number (denoted R 0 ) of an infection can be viewed as the number of cases one case generates on average over the course of its infectious period [28] . This is one of the most important indexes in evaluating the risk of an infectious disease. The asymptotical dynamic behavior of infectious diseases can be reflected by the steady state, which implies the disease will die out or persist in the future. Therefore, we first provided some mathematical analysis results of Model (2), whose proofs are shown in Appendix A. • Model (2) has the following positively invariant set: • Making use of the next generation matrix (see [29] ), we obtained the basic reproduction number of Model (2) as follows: (4) • This model has a disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium P * = (S * 1 , S * 2 , S * 3 , E * , I * , R * ), which is determined by the following equations • If R 0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium P 0 is globally asymptotically stable.
