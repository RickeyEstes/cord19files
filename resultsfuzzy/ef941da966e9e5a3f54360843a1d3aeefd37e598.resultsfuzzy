Illumina Hi-seq (2 × 100) pair-end sequencing of asymptomatic honey bees from Devon was carried out on colonies that either survived (GD2) or collapsed (GD1) because of OCL (Highfield et al., 2009) . To assess DWV diversity within the samples the raw reads were searched against a custom DWV family database (including KV and VDV-1 genomes) and reads matching to any of the DWV genomes were extracted. The coverage for the number of reads that matched to a custom DWV BLAST database was estimated using the Lander/Waterman equation (that is, the depth of sequencing). Genome coverage depth ranged from 457 to 165 927 × (average coverage was 86 838 × ) (Supplementary Table S1 ). De novo assembly of the Illumina reads yielded a complete genome of a type A variant as well as of a novel DWV variant that we named Type C (Supplementary Table S2 ). Competitive alignment to the now three master variants revealed that out of the~30 million DWV blast positive reads,~27 million were assembled to one of three genomes (Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Figure  S1 ). Around 3 million assembled to type A,~3.5 thousand to type B and~24 million to Type C. As expected, more reads align to the 3′ region of the genome than the 5′; an artefact of the reverse transcription 3′ bias (Brooks et al., 1995) . Although reads aligned to the whole of the Type C genome, the depth of coverage was lower at the 5′ region (Supplementary Figure S1 ). In addition, coverage of the 5′ region of the type A variant was unusually high, indicating that this disproportionate coverage in the 5′ regions of type A and C could be the evidence of recombination between the two variants. Because of the low read depth and coverage for type B in our samples, a full genome could not be assembled (Supplementary  Table  S3 and Supplementary Figure S1 ). Nonetheless, closer examination of 3′ region where the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene is located (Baker and Schroeder, 2008) revealed that the Devon type B variant shared 100% identity to VDV-1 type B genome in this region (Supplementary Figure S2) . The sequence identity of our newly assembled type A and C variants was compared with other members of the DWV complex (Table 1 and Figure 1 ). Both type B and C differ from the type A nucleotide sequence in similar regions of the genome. However, type B and C share only 79% nucleotide identity in the polyprotein encoding region of the genome and 89% identity in the amino acid sequence. Phylogenetic analysis showed the relationship of the novel type A and C variants from Devon to previously sequenced viruses (Figures 2 and 3) . The type A genome clustered with other type A variants, whereas Type C formed a distinct and separate branch, thereby confirming the originality and thus new master variant assignment of DWV Type C. Given that type A and C can recombine with each other, we screened for any genomes with evidence of recombination and excluded them from the analysis in order to comply with the assumptions underlying phylogenetic reconstruction. The Type C genome codes for a full-length polyprotein and translation of the genome permitted the amino acid sequence to be compared with more distant members of the genus Iflavirus (Figure 2 ).

Plot created by mVISTA (Frazer et al., 2004) . F. exsecta virus 2 and Sacbrood virus was analysed using a Bayesian inference of phylogeny of a conserved region of the RdRp amino acid sequence ( Figure 2 ). The DWV sequences were attributed to three main groups (type A, B and C). The nucleotide consensus sequences created by Vicuna for type A was found to be 98.2% identical to the type A reference DWV genome. The analysis suggested that the new Type C genome is clearly related to type A and B, and forms a distinct clade to other members of the family Iflaviridae (for example, Sacbrood virus) that are all only distantly related to a dicistrovirus outgroup, F. exsecta virus. In addition, a Bayesian analysis of the polyprotein encoding region of the sequences was carried out using an MCMC model, permitting a molecular clock model to be run within BEAST v1.8.1 (Figure 3 ) (Drummond et al., 2012) . Divergence times were calculated based on a tip-dated coalescent model, with an evolutionary rate prior based on three independent tip-dated fragments of DWV type A. The samples in the tree span 11 years (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) , and the samples used for estimating the evolutionary rate span 11, 13 and 22 years for the RdRp-, capsidand lp-fragments, respectively. The Bayesian tree of the nucleotide sequences had a similar structure to the amino acid tree, showing that the Type C viral variant is distinct from type A and B. The molecular clock estimation predicts that Type C diverged from the other DWV variants 319 years ago (57-1010 95% highest posterior density), and type A and B disassociated from each other 181 years ago (38-497 95% highest posterior density). This estimate is unlikely to be biased by substitution saturation, as there is no evidence for saturation in our data set (Xia et al., 2003) . The phylogenetic analysis concludes that the DWV quasispecies is made up of three distinct master variants. However, the number of variants is not exhaustive and it is conceivable that more variants will be added in the future as the use of NGS becomes increasingly prolific. The result further suggests that Type C has not recently emerged, but rather is an established DWV variant. Moreover, using reverse transcriptase-PCR to amplify a region of the DWV RdRp gene, Martin et al. (2012) attributed a novel variant to the type B swarm of variants, although it is now clear that this novel variant was in fact Type C. The presence of Type C in Hawaii implies that this variant is widespread and not specific to the United Kingdom. It also confirms that it has not emerged recently as the Hawaiian sample originates from Kauai that has yet to be colonised by Varroa , suggesting Type C is part of the wild-type DWV quasispecies. The high levels of heterogeneity within viral RNA populations mean that viruses are able to occupy large areas of sequence space and consequently are able to exist in multiple hosts (Domingo and Holland, 1997) . DWV is a 'generalist' known to infect bumblebees (Genersch et al, 2006; Fürst et al., 2014) , V. destructor (Ongus et al., 2004) and other insects (reviewed in Manley et al., 2015) . Further work is required to ascertain whether Type C causes acute wing deformities in honey bees or its presence is because of viral 'spill over' from another host. Three of the four samples in this study were taken from a hive (GD1) that went on to collapse from OCL. However, as type A and the type A-C 5′ recombinant were also present, it remains unclear which variant was responsible for OCL. It is worth noting however that between 85% and 98% of the reads in hive GD1 were Type C that make up the Type C or the A-C recombinant genomes (Supplementary Table S1 ). The second hive (GD2) that survived OCL contained roughly equal levels of type A and C reads (which includes reads that make up the A-C recombinant); yet, the coverage indicates that the viral load was much lower in this hive. Moreover, the low abundance of DWV type B in these Devon colonies appears to confirm the observation made in the colonies from Swindon (Mordecai et al., 2016) ; that is, DWV type B is not present at sufficient levels to protect the honey bee from the virulent type A, or possibly C variants (as well as any recombinants between A and C). In addition, Varroa mites in the Devon colonies were controlled using chemical methods, thereby potentially preventing the mites from transmitting type B into the honey bees; as observed in the Swindon Apiary (Mordecai et al., 2016) . A recombinant between DWV type A and B has been reported previously (Moore et al., 2011) , and found to be hypervirulent as it was more efficient at replicating than other variants when co-injected directly into the haemolymph of honey bee larvae . As it is presently unclear whether the Type C variant or the A-C recombinant lead to disease, further direct manipulation experiments such as those carried out by Ryabov et al. (2014 could be crucial in determining whether the novel Type C genome and any of its recombinants are hypervirulent. The large number of DWV Type C and A-C recombinant reads in the Devon samples (Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Figure S1 ) suggests that these variants are able to Figure 3 Bayesian phylogeny of the polyprotein encoding nucleotide sequence using an MCMC model (BEAST).

The capacity of DWV to exist as a swarm of recombining variants and occupy large amounts of sequence space may be one of the factors contributing to its capability to maintain a persistent infection. Defining DWV as a quasispecies with discrete master variants is comparable with the current categorisation of several other RNA viruses. The genetic variability within Hepatitis C virus has been classified into four hierarchical strata: genotypes, sub-genotypes, isolates and finally background variation of the quasispecies (Farci and Purcell, 2000) . A total of seven Hepatitis C virus genotypes exist to date, differing from each other by 415% over their complete coding region (Smith et al., 2014) . Similarly, Japanese encephalitis virus is currently classified into five genotypes based on sequence identity that differ in replication efficiency in a range of hosts (Han et al., 2014) . In order to further our understanding of DWV and the impact of the virus on honey bees as well as other hosts, a more progressive classification of the DWV quasispecies would be prudent, that is, the new classification of DWV as a quasispecies with at least three master variants that can recombine with each other. Bioinformatics pipelines designed for eukaryotes and prokaryotes are not necessarily suited to studying viral systems. For example, pipelines incorporating reference assemblers could hinder the discovery of novel virus variants. The genome sequences presented here are representative of the different variants found within a sample; however, the Vicuna pipeline is not suited to analysing the further level of diversity around these variants, for which diversity models are better suited, such as those developed by Wood et al. (2014) . As well as being of significance to globally important honey bee health, the ability to study highly heterogeneous virus genomes is of wider importance. Cross-species virus transmission and emergence of new epidemic diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, Ebola and influenza are major threats to public health (Parrish et al., 2008) . Exploring the extent of viral diversity in RNA quasispecies, of which DWV may be a suitable model, may offer insight into the mechanisms by which viruses are able to transmit between different hosts as well as how viruses are able to develop resistance to antiviral therapies (Domingo et al., 2012) . Further study of the DWV quasispecies may help to explain how DWV is able to exist as multiple variants in many hosts, and may elucidate mechanisms by which it establishes a persistent infection among several hosts but only proves pathogenic in some.
