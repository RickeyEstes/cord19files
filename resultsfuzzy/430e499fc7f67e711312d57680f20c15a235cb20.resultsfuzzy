Specific primers were designed according to the results of the Illumina sequencing, flanking the region of the conserved RdRp domains. Primer sequences are listed in S1 Table. For cDNA synthesis total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification were done as described above using 2 Î¼L cDNA. PCR products were gel purified and sequenced. Virome sequencing of R. solani isolate DC17 The dsRNA extract of the R. solani isolate DC17 showed a diverse pattern of dsRNA fragments after gel electrophoresis indicating the presence of multiple mycoviruses. At least six dsRNA fragments with a mobility corresponding to the sizes of approximately 0.85 to 12 kb were identified (Fig 1) . Sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq System resulted in a total of 930,558 paired-end reads yielding 279 Mb sequence information. After quality analysis, 0.1% of these reads were excluded from further analysis. Based on at least 90% sequence identity over a minimum of 40 bases, reads were assembled into 144 contigs with sizes between 12.8 and 0.4 kb. In total, 40.2% of the contigs were classified as viral sequences based on a BLAST search corresponding to about 84% of the used reads. The average read coverage of the contigs was approx. 270-fold, but great differences between contigs were observed (~15x-4500x). Based on the assembled virome data, it was possible to identify 17 contigs encoding different viral RdRp domains. For detailed analysis, these RdRp domains were re-sequenced based on whole RNA extracts and partial domains were completed. These data were used for taxonomic classification. The identified RdRps belong to four different protein families (Pfam) corresponding to either the alphavirus-like superfamily, the picornavirus-like super family or the Narnaviridae. They showed similarities from 31 to 93% to RdRp domains of viral sequences deposited in the NCBI database. Putative members of the family Narnaviridae identified in R. solani DC17 Viruses of the family Narnaviridae are the simplest of all RNA viruses consisting only of one small single-stranded RNA of 2.3 to 3.6 kb, which codes for a single RdRp gene [46] . The family is divided into the two genera Narnavirus and Mitovirus. The members of the Narnaviridae are only distantly related to other RNA viruses infecting eukaryotes and share higher sequence similarity to bacteriophages of the family Leviviridae [47] . The analysis of the conserved RdRp domains revealed that the R. solani isolate DC17 is the host of six different mitoviruses. Sequence comparisons with all recognized members of the genus Mitovirus allowed the identification of the four conserved motifs I to IV previously described for mitoviruses by Kitahara and coworkers [48] . Multiple alignments identified these motifs as motif F to C and, additionally, motif E and D were detected in this study (Fig 2) . So far, 18 different mitoviruses have been characterized in the genus Rhizoctonia, the majority of them in R. solani [49, 50] . Analysis of the conserved RdRp domain indicated that five of the mitoviruses found in this study, represent novel species, as they display only limited sequence similarity to the mitoviruses described so far (Fig 3) . These mitoviruses were named Rhizoctonia solani mitovirus 16 to 20 (RsMV-16 to 20). The RdRp domain of one mitovirus identified in the analyzed virome shows high sequence similarity of 92% to Rhizoctonia solani mitovirus 9 (KP900918.1). Since only a partial sequence of this virus has been deposited in the NCBI database, no comparison of the complete RdRp protein was possible, to check whether both viruses fulfill the species demarcation criterion of less than 90% amino acid sequence similarity over the complete RdRp protein [8] . This mitovirus was presumably considered as Rhizoctonia solani mitovirus 9 DC17. Putative member of the family Endornaviridae identified in R. solani DC17 Viruses belonging to the family Endornaviridae are found in algae, plants and fungi [8] . They possess a non-segmented genome of 14 to 17 kb which codes for a single large polyprotein [7] . The polyprotein always carries a conserved RdRp domain (pfam00978), specifying its affiliation to the alphavirus-like superfamily. Other typical conserved replicase motifs like a methyltransferase, helicase or glycosyltransferase are missing in some species [51] . The CDD search of the deduced gene products derived from the deep sequencing analysis of dsRNA revealed the presence of one conserved RdRp domain belonging to the pfam00978 family. It is 45% identical to the conserved RdRp domain of Soybean-associated endornavirus 1, which is the species in the NCBI database showing the highest level of similarity [52] . Seven conserved motifs (A-G), typical for members of the family Endornaviridae were identified by sequence alignments with all recognized members of this family (Fig 4) . This indicates the presence of a novel endornavirus, named Rhizoctonia solani endornavirus 3 (RsEV-3). This finding was confirmed by a phylogenetic analysis of the conserved RdRp domain within the alphavirus-like superfamily which placed this novel virus within the family Endornaviridae. So far, three mycoviruses belonging to the family of the Endornaviridae were described to infect the genus Rhizoctonia, namely Rhizoctonia solani endornavirus-RS002 (RsEV-1), Rhizoctonia solani endornavirus 2 (RsEV-2) and Rhizoctonia cerealis endornavirus 1 (RcEV-1) [28, 50, 53] . Sequence comparisons showed that RsEV-3 and RsEV-1 possess 44.2% The scale represents a genetic distance of 0.1 amino acid substitutions per site. Bootstrap values < 50% are not shown. Analyzed species include mitoviruses identified in Rhizoctonia as well as species of the family Narnaviridae recognized by the ICTV. Species identified in this study are marked with dots. Analysis was conducted using MEGA 6.06 and the sequence alignment algorithm MUSCLE [45] . amino acid homology across the conserved RdRp domain. Comparison of the conserved motifs revealed that the RdRp domain of RsEV1 is incomplete, as the motifs C to E were missing. Sequence comparison of the remaining RdRp domain shows a homology of 52.5% to RsEV-1. Recently, the genome of RsEV-2 was deposited in the NCBI database [50] . Both viruses share 63.2% sequence identity within the RDRP domain. Due to the high conservation within this region, similarities between different members of the Endornaviridae can also be high, like it is the case for the Bell pepper endornavirus and Phaseoulus vulgaris endornavirus, which share a sequence homology of 74% within their RdRp domains. Putative members of the order Tymovirales identified in R. solani DC17 The order Tymovirales comprises four viral families. Viruses belonging to the Alphaflexiviridae, Betaflexiviridae and Gammaflexiviridae feature a filamentous morphology, whereas members of the Tymoviridae are icosahedral. So far, three mycoviruses belonging to the order Tymovirales have been recognized by the ICTV; all of them represent own genera [8] . Whereas Botrytis virus X (Botrexvirus) and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum debilitation-associated RNA virus (Sclerodarnavirus) belong to the Alphaflexiviridae, Botrytis virus F represents the only member of the family Gammaflexiviridae [54] [55] [56] . The search for conserved RdRp domains with the deduced gene products of the virome of R. solani DC17 revealed the presence of two domains assigned to pfam00978, which were distantly related to each other and to several members of the order Tymovirales. Sequence comparisons with the type species of all genera within the order allowed the identification of the seven conserved motifs A to G (Fig 5) . A phylogenetic analysis of this region including all families of the alphavirus-like super family, placed both viruses within the order Tymovirales (Fig 6) . They form a distinct clade, which indicates that they may represent members of a so far uncharacterized family within this order. The novel viruses were named Rhizoctonia solani flexivirus 1 (RsFV-1) and Rhizoctonia solani flexivirus 2 (RSFV-2).
