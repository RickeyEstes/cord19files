The synthetic routes to the bridging ligand bpibH 2 and the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex is presented in Scheme 1. The ligand bpibH 2 was prepared through condensation of 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione (2) with benzene-1,4-dicarbaldehyde according to literature methods [40] . By the action of an ethylene glycol solution of bridging ligand bpibH 2 (3) and the precursor complex cis-[Ru(phen) 2 Cl 2 ] was converted into 4 under Ar atmosphere, then, by the action of an ethylene glycol solution of 4 and the precursor complex cis-[Co(phen) 2 Cl 2 ]Cl was converted into the title complex under Ar atmosphere (51% yield). The desired Ru(II)-Co(III) complex was isolated as its perchlorates and purified by column chromatography. The title complex was characterized by elemental analyses, mass spectra and NMR spectra. The heterodinuclear Ru(II)-Co(III) complex displayed resolvable 1 H NMR spectra in d 6 -DMSO, all proton resonance signals are assigned through 1 H-1 H COSY (COSY = correlated spectroscopy) experiments and the 1 H NMR spectra of the heterodinuclear complexes. The well-defined 1 H NMR spectra of the heterodinuclear Ru(II)-Co(III) complex is given in Fig. 1 , which permit unambiguous identification and assessment of purity. Due to the shielding influences of the adjacent the bridging ligand bpibH 2 and phen, the phen protons of complexes exhibit two distinct sets of signals. In addition, the proton resonance on the nitrogen atom of the bridging ligand bpibH 2 imidazole ring was not observed, because the proton is active and exchanges quickly between the two nitrogens of 9. the imidazole ring. A similar example has been reported previously [43, 44] . The absorption spectrum of the heterodinuclear complex was recorded in acetonitrile solvent at room temperature (Fig. 2) , which showed well resolved bands in the 200-600 nm range. The lowest energy absorption bands at 459 nm for heterodinuclear complex are assigned to the metal-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition. The high energy absorption bands are attributed to the intragand π → π* transition by comparison with the spectra of the bridging ligand [45] . The application of electronic absorption spectroscopy in DNA/ RNA-binding studies is one of the most useful techniques [46] . Complex binding with DNA/RNA through intercalation usually results in hypochromism and bathochromism, due to the intercalative mode involving a strong stacking interaction between an aromatic chromophore and the base pairs of DNA/RNA. The extent of the hypochromism commonly parallels the intercalative binding strength. Fig. 3 . shows the UV and visible spectra of the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex titrated with CT-DNA and yeast tRNA. As can be seen from Obviously, these spectral characteristics suggested that the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex could strongly interact with CT-DNA and yeast tRNA, and the hypochromism of the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex binding with CT-DNA is higher than that of the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex binding with yeast tRNA. Compared the hypochromism of the UVvisible spectra for both CT-DNA and yeast tRNA binding of the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex with that of CT-DNA binding of its parent complex [Ru(phen) 3 ] 2+ (hypochromism in MLCT (MLCT = metal-to-ligand charge transfer) band at 445 nm is 12% and the red shift is 2 nm) [47] , which interacts with CT-DNA through a semiintercalation or quasi-intercalation [48] , and considering that the UV-vis spectrum of [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2+ (bpy= 2,2′-bipyridine), a typical electrostatic binding complex, has been demonstrated to be unchanged upon the addition of CT-DNA [49] , these spectral characteristics obviously suggest that both CT-DNA and yeast tRNA binding of the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex used in this paper are most likely through a mode that involved a stacking interaction between the aromatic chromophore bpibH 2 and the base pairs of CT-DNA and yeast tRNA. In order to further elucidate quantitatively the affinity of the Ru (II)-Co(III) complex binding to CT-DNA and yeast tRNA, the intrinsic binding constants K b were obtained by monitoring the changes in absorbance at the three bands (263 nm, 377 nm and 459 nm respectively) with increasing concentration of CT-DNA or yeast tRNA using the following equation [50] : where [Nucleic acid] is the concentration of CT-DNA or yeast tRNA in base pairs, the apparent absorption coefficients ε a , ε f , and ε b correspond to A obsd /[Ru], the absorbance for the free Ru(II)-Co(III) complex, and the absorbance for the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex in the fully bound form, respectively. K b is the equilibrium binding constant in M −1 , C t is the total metal complex concentration, and s is the binding size. The K b values of the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex binding with CT-DNA and yeast tRNA are listed in Table 1 . From Table 1 , we can see that although Ru(II)-Co(III) complex yielded hypochromism in the all bands induced by CT-DNA are bigger than that induced by yeast tRNA. Based on that the extent of the hypochromism commonly parallels the intercalative binding strength, the DNA-binding affinity of complex should be greater than that of yeast , we can deduce that both binding modes of the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex to CT-DNA and yeast tRNA are most likely intercalation, that is, the bpiH 2 ligand of the complex intercalates into the double-helical regions of yeast tRNA as it interacts with CT-DNA [25] . Also, the characteristics of UV and visible spectra, as well as the binding constants obtained demonstrate that yeast tRNA binding of the complex is stronger than CT-DNA binding. A possible explanation for this observation may be due to the A-form configuration and the L-shaped tertiary structure of yeast tRNA, in which the major groove, is wide and shallow, thus its base pairs are well exposed and can be attacked by complexes easily. In addition, the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex may bind to the bugle region of yeast tRNA, and that may be another reason why RNA binding affinity of the complex is greater. Luminescene spectroscopy is one of the most common and at the same time most sensitive ways to analyze drug-nucleic acid interactions. Support for the above intercalative binding mode also comes from the emission measurement of complex. Upon excitation using a wavelength of 459 nm, the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex is luminescent in Tris buffer at room temperature, with the fluorescence maximum at 604 nm. As shown in the steady-state luminescene spectra of 1 μM solution of the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex in the presence of CT-DNA or yeast tRNA (Fig. 4) . Upon addition of CT-DNA (Fig. 4a) , the fluorescence-emission intensity increases by a factor of ca. 1.74 and saturates at a [DNA]/[Ru-Co] ratio of 2.4. This indicates that the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex strongly interacts with DNA, which efficiently 'protects' it, since the hydrophobic environment inside the DNA helix reduces the accessibility of solvent H 2 O to the complex, and because complex mobility is restricted at the binding site this results in a decrease of the vibrational modes of relaxation and thus higher emission intensity. In contrast, for yeast tRNA binding of the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex, the fluorescence intensity of the complex decreased gradually upon the addition of yeast tRNA (Fig. 4b) which suggested that yeast tRNA can partially quench the fluorescence of Ru(II)-Co(III) complex. This quenching of fluorescence of the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex by yeast tRNA is most probably due to electron or energy transfer between the Ru(II) complex and yeast tRNA caused by a stronger interaction of the complex with yeast tRNA [60] . The hypochromism of the peak reached as high as 64.8% and saturates at a [DNA]/[Ru-Co] ratio of 3.0. Compared with that for CT-DNA, the change in emission for yeast tRNA titration was smaller. In addition, the inset of 6 ] as quencher may provide further information about complexes binding to DNA or RNA, but cannot determine the mode of binding. We decided to perform some experiments at ambient temperature, using a similar method as that described by Satyanarayana et al. [61] . As illustrated in (Fig. 5) , in the absence of CT-DNA (Fig. 5 , top, dotted lines) or yeast Trna (Fig. 5, bottom, dotted lines) , Ru(II)-Co(III) was efficiently quenched by [Fe(CN) 6 ] 4− , resulting in a linear Stern-Volmer plot, and the slope, namely K sv is 9.68. However, in the presence of CT-DNA (Fig. 5 , top, solid lines) or yeast tRNA (Fig. 5,  bottom, solid lines) , it is difficult to be quenched, which may be explained by the fact that the bound cations of Ru(II)-Co(III) is protected from the anionic water-bound quencher by the array of negative charges along the DNA and RNA phosphate backbone [41] . Fig. 5 indicated that the fluorescence quenching curves were in good agreement with the linear Stern-Volmer equation. For CT-DNA and yeast tRNA, the slopes, namely K sv are 0.40 and 0.08. In the presence of CT-DNA and yeast tRNA, the final fluorescence intensity was originally 71.1% and 81.8%. The curvature reflects different degrees of protection or relative accessibility of bound cations, a large slope for the Stern-Volmer curve parallels poorer protection and low binding. The result thus further confirms that Ru(II)-Co(III) binds to yeast tRNA more strongly than to CT-DNA. To further clarify the interactions between the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex and DNA, viscosity measurements were carried out on CT-DNA by varying the concentration of the added complex. Hydrodynamic measurements that are sensitive to length change (i.e., viscosity and sedimentation) are regarded as the least ambiguous and the most critical tests of a binding model in solution in the absence of crystallographic structural data [33] . A classical intercalation model demands that the DNA helix must lengthen as base airs are separated to accommodate the binding ligand, leading to the increase of DNA viscosity. In contrast, a partial or non-classical intercalation ligand could bend (or kink) the DNA helix, reduce its effective length and, concomitantly, its viscosity [62] . The effects of the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex together with ethidium bromide (EB) and [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2+ on the viscosity of rod-like DNA are shown in Fig. 6 . EB has been well known to binding with DNA through the intercalation mode. While for complex [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2+ , which has been known to bind with DNA in electrostatic mode, it exerts essentially no effect on DNA viscosity. On increasing the amounts of Ru(II)-Co(III) complex, the relative viscosity of DNA increases steadily, which is similar to the behavior of EB. The increased degree of viscosity, which may depend on its affinity to DNA follow the order of EB N Ru(II)-Co(III) N [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2+ . A similar sharp increase in relative viscosity has been observed on the addition [Ru(bpy) 2 (dppz)] 2+ , which was proved to be bound to DNA by intercalation. The results suggest that the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex binds to DNA through a classical intercalation model. Such a result is consistent with the foregoing hypothesis. However, viscometry cannot be used to study the interaction between yeast tRNA and metal complexes, since yeast tRNA is not a linear structure. In fact, no obvious change in viscosity was observed for yeast tRNA in the presence of the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex. Equilibrium dialysis experiments may offer the opportunity to examine the enantioselectivity of complexes binding to nucleic acid [63] . Racemic solutions of the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex dialyzed against CT-DNA or yeast tRNA for 32 h, and then subjected to CD analysis. During the course of the dialysis at intervals of time, the CD signals started from none, increased to the maximum magnitude after 32 h dialysis of the complex, then no longer changed. That is to say, the CD signals of the complex neither increased nor decreased at the end. The CD spectra in the region of 230-630 nm for complex the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex after its racemic solution had been dialyzed against CT-DNA and yeast tRNA are shown in Fig. 7 . As shown in Fig. 7 showed two distinct sets of CD signals, with two positive peaks at about 280 nm and 420 nm, two negative peaks at about 300 nm and 470 nm, and the CD signals for the dialysate of the complex dialyzed against yeast tRNA were much stronger than those for the complex dialyzed against CT-DNA. The presence of CD signals indicates enrichment of the enantiomer binding less favorably to yeast tRNA or CT-DNA. Although the complex was not resolved into the pure enantiomers, and we cannot determine which enantiomer binds preferentially yeast tRNA or CT-DNA, it is evident that the complex interact enantioselectivly with both yeast tRNA and CT-DNA, and that the complex is a better candidate for an enantioselective binder to yeast tRNA than to CT-DNA. According to the proposed binding model by Barton and co-workers [11] , the Δ enantiomer of the complex, a right-handed propeller-like structure, displays a greater affinity than the Λ enantiomer with the left-handed CT-DNA helix due to moreappropriate steric matching. Although the configuration of CT-DNA is different from that of yeast tRNA, both yeast tRNA and CT-DNA have the same right-handed helix structure. Therefore, we can deduce that the Δ enantiomer of the complex may bind more favorably to both yeast tRNA and CT-DNA than the Λ enantiomer does. In addition, the phenomenon that the CD signals for the dialysate of the complex dialyzed against yeast tRNA are much stronger than those for the complex dialyzed against CT-DNA, which implies that the Ru(II)-Co (III) complex binding with yeast tRNA shows more enantioselective than that with CT-DNA. Therefore, for yeast tRNA, the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex is a better enantioselective binder. The Ru(II)-Co(III) complex was tested in a cell proliferation assay on two human cell lines, HL-60 and HepG2 cells. Cis-platin has been included as the control, and it shows high cytotoxicity, which are in accordance with the literature reports [64] . The IC 50 values were calculated after 48 h of incubation with complexes and are listed in Table 2 . As shown in Table 2 , the Ru-Co complex demonstrated different cytotoxicity against selected tumor cell lines in vitro, namely, the human HL-60 cells are more sensitive to the Ru-Co complex than HepG2 cells. Compared the Ru-Co complex with cis-platin, the former displayed lower antitumor activity against the tumor cells tested. The results indicated that the toxicity of the Ru-Co complex was found to be concentration dependent, namely, the cell viability decreased with increasing complex concentration. Although higher complex concentration reduced the percentages of cell survival, there is a significant difference in susceptibility between the Ru-Co complex and cis-platin. It's well known that, due to exist leaving group (chloride ion) in cisplatin, its cytotoxic effects through covalent binding to DNA form cis- DDP-DNA adducts, which interferes with DNA replication and transcription and ultimately induces cell death. However, no leaving group exists in the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex, therefore, the anti-tumor mechanism of the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex may not occur with the DNA cross-linking reaction. Furthermore, the anti-tumor mechanism of the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex does not seem entirely like that of some organic molecules, such as drugs adriamycin and daunorubicin, which inhibit tumor by inserting DNA. According to the results, we speculate that the antitumor activity of the Ru(II)-Co(III) complex not only may be related to inserting DNA, but also related to the specific molecular shape of Ru(II)-Co(III) complex and the chemical structure and nature of the inserted ligand. The purpose of the Giemsa staining was to gain information about the apoptosis of complexes on HepG2 cells. After exposuring to 20 μM tested complexes, the majority of the HepG2 cells displayed classic morphological features of apoptosis, including nuclear condensation, cell shrinkage, and formation of apoptotic bodies which shows purple and cytoplasmic concentration which shows dark red (Fig. 8a, c) , while the control cells showed red (Fig. 8b . The results suggested that complex induce HepG2 cells reduction in viable cell number partially through induction of HepG2 cells apoptosis. However, which only qualitatively depicts apoptosis of the cells influenced by the Ru(II)-Co (III) complex. Further studies in detail are currently underway to quantitatively determine the complex effect on the cells apoptosis.
