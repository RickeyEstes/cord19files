Prior to each series of potentiometric titrations, the glass microelectrode was calibrated by using an appropriate standardizing system (tetra-n-butylammonium picrate + picric acid) in both solvents studied. In acetone (AC) and acetonitrile (AN), plots of the potential difference E vs: lg c ðHAÞ =c ðA À Þ were almost straight lines over the À1.0 to 1.0 interval on the logarithmic scale, and slopes of the glass electrode response (s) were found to be dependent on the nature of the solvent, ranging from (58 to 61) mV (close to the Nernst theoretical values). A graph of the calibration of the glass electrode in acetonitrile (squares) and acetone (circles) is presented in figure 2 . The characteristics of the glass electrode for these plots can be described by the following equations:  where (E ) is a standard potential difference and (s) a slope of the glass electrode response, with their standard deviations in parentheses, respectively. It is worth noting that (tetra-n-butylammonium picrate + picric acid) buffer was employed in all our measurements due to its relatively short stabilization time of the potential difference values in solvents studied. The parameters, s and E calculated from the calibration measurements of the glass electrode together with the experimentally established relationships E = f(lg c B /c BH+ ) in both solvents, served to determine the values of stability constants of the homocomplexed cations with symmetric hydrogen bond bridges OÁ Á ÁHÁ Á ÁO, as well as the acid dissociation constants. These numerical values were determined by means of a computer programme based on the general method of Kostrowicki and Liwo. A graphical representation of the potentiometric titration is shown in figure 3 , where potential difference (E) is plotted against lg c B /c BH+ in acetonitrile for the 3,5-dimethyl-4-chloropyridine N-oxide system. As seen, the titration curve has a typical sigmoid shape. This confirms the existence of the stable cationic homocomplexed cation (PyOHÁ Á ÁOPy) + . It is worth mentioning that similar shapes of the potentiometric titration curves have also been observed in the experiments carried out by Van der Heijde [38] and Harlow [39, 40] , who investigated the homoconjugation equilibria in acetonitrile, acetone, pyridine, benzene, toluene, and sulfolanes. The values of homoconjugation constants (expressed as lg K BHB þ ) for symmetric cations resulting from the reaction of 4-halo (Cl, Br) pyridine N-oxides with conjugate cationic acids in acetone (AC) and acetonitrile (AN) are listed in table 2. These constants reveal that cationic homoconjugation equilibria are present for all BH + /B systems in AC and AN. Furthermore, analysis of the homoconjugation FIGURE 2. Plot of potential difference E against concentration for the calibration of the glass electrode for the (tetra-n-butylammonium picrate + picric acid) standardizing system in acetonitrile (squares) and acetone (circles). constants shows that these values are charged with small standard deviations (0.02 to 0.19) for all 4-halopyridine N-oxide derivatives in both solvents studied. The homoconjugation constants obtained in acetonitrile are by a factor of about (0.06 to 0.63) greater (on average 0.32) than values determined in other aprotic solvents (acetone) with a greater donor number. This confirms the general tendency that the range of homoconjugation involving N-oxides increases with the decreasing donor properties of the solvent. The smaller values of homoconjugation constants in acetone in relation to acetonitrile can be interpreted as being due to a stronger solvation of cationic acids (BH + ) constituents of the hydrogen-bonded complexes by the more basic acetone, thus weakening the hydrogen bonding. Consequently, based on the results of our previous [41] and present studies, the sequence of non-aqueous solvents classified according to the increasing strength of cationic homoconjugation of organic N-bases with conjugate cationic acids, can be arranged as follows: nitromethane > benzonitrile > acetonitrile > propylene carbonate > acetone > methanol > N 0 ,N 0 -dimethylformamide > dimethyl sulfoxide. Moreover, detailed potentiometric studies indicated that the values of stability constants of the homocomplexed cations formed by oxygen-containing N-oxides studied (expressed as lg K BHB þ ) in acetonitrile are of the same order of magnitude as those determined in acetone. The loga-rithms of the constants range from 2.46 to 3.15 and 2.18 to 2.82 in acetonitrile and acetone, respectively. Based on this, the correlation analysis was made between the lg K BHB þ values of the 4-halopyridine N-oxides in both solvents studied. As a result, after rejection of the most aberrant data points (2,5Me 2 4ClPyO) the following relationship was obtained: where standard deviations are given in parentheses and R denotes the correlation coefficient. This means that a correlation between the values of the logarithms of the homoconjugation constants in AN and AC does exist. The energies of formation of the homocomplexed cations and Gibbs free energies calculated at the RHF and MP2 levels and by using the PCM model of solvation are also collected in table 2 together with the values of lg K BHB þ in both solvents studied. Inspection of these data shows that all the calculated energetic parameters fall within a narrow range. Cationic homoconjugation energies (DE BHB þ ) calculated at the RHF and MP2 level oscillate around À121.3 kJ AE mol À1 (from À109.3 to À129.1), the values of the Gibbs free energies DG BHB þ (RHF) oscillate around À71.1 kJ AE mol À1 (from À60.7 to À78.2), and those calculated within the polarizable continuum model (PCM) accounting for solvation effects around À41.8 kJ AE mol À1 (from À37.7 to À47.1). The results of theoretical calculations conform with the experimental data because both the logarithms of the homoconjugation constants and the theoretically calculated energies and Gibbs free energies of homoconjugation are contained within a narrow range of values. In a continuation of this study, based on these experimental and theoretical data, an attempt has been made to establish a correlation between these approaches. After consideration of all the systems, the correlational coefficients were low, ranging from 0.76 to 0.87 in acetone, and 0.60 to 0.92 in acetonitrile. Eliminating one point that is most distant from the correlation line (2,5Me 2 4ClPyO in TABLE 2 Listing of cationic homoconjugation constants of the substituted 4-halopyridine N-oxides determined potentiometrically in acetone (lg K AC BHB þ ) and in AC and 3,5Me 2 4BrPyO in AN, respectively) improved the correlational coefficients. The following relationships were obtained (R denotes the correlation coefficients):  This relatively high correlational coefficients R revealed an existence of linear relationships between the values of stability of homocomplexed cations of the multisubstituted pyridine N-oxides determined in solution and those calculated in vacuo. Moreover, these findings show that the sequence of changes of the stability constants of the homocomplexed cations [BHB] + in polar non-aqueous solvents can be predicted on the basis of the cationic homoconjugation energies calculated by ab initio methods. An additional aim of this work is to determine the acid dissociation constants for cationic acids conjugated with 4-halopyridine N-oxides in both solvents studied. These values (expressed as pK a values) are listed in table 3. It can be observed that they are characterized by relatively small standard deviations. The pK a values in acetone are relatively low, of order of 5 (the highest value 5.86 being for the 3,5Me 2 4BrPyO) and lower. This finding can be explained in terms of the presence of strong electronaccepting substituent (a halogen atom) at position 4. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that values of pK a in acetonitrile for the conjugate acids of N-bases are by more than ten orders of magnitude lower than those of carboxylic acids pK AN a values falling in the range 17 to 21 [42] , phenols pK AN a values are of the order of 16 to 27 [43] and only 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those for mineral acids [44] , including sulphuric acid (pK AN a ¼ 7:9), nitric and hydrochloric acid (pK AN a ¼ 8:9 for both). In addition, the pK a values of the N-oxides studied in acetone (DN = 17) are by four orders of magnitude lower than those determined in acetonitrile (DN = 14.9), and two orders of magnitude higher than those in polar amphiprotic methanol (DN = 19.1 [19] ). This means that the strength of the cationic acids conjugated with the substituted pyridine N-oxides increases in the following series of solvents: AN < AC < MeOH, which is in agreement with the basicity of these solvents. Table 3 also shows the values of acidity constants for the N-oxides in aqueous solutions, pK W a . In view of missing experimental data in water, these constants were estimated from a linear relationship previously derived [45] for other pyridine N-oxides: pK AC a ¼ 1:33pK W a þ 4:32, taking into consideration the pK a values determined experimentally in acetone.
