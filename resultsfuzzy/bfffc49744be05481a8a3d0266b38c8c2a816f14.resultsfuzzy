TEV-ÁNIb Has Greater Within-Host Fitness than TEV in N. tabacum 35S::NIb Li and Carrington (1995) generated transgenic N. tabacum cv. Xanthi plants expressing TEV NIb under control of the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35 S promoter, referred to here as N. tabacum 35S::NIb. TEV variants with disruption of the polymerase GDD amino acid motif, the nuclear localization signal, or the NIb N-terminal cleavage site could replicate in these transgenic plants, whereas replication was not supported in wild-type plants. Moreover, a TEV variant missing NIb altogether could also infect these transgenic plants and induce symptoms after 7 dpi, similar to the wild-type virus. Tromas and Elena (2010) also generated a TEV variant missing the NIb cistron, referred to here as TEV-ÁNIb. TEV-ÁNIb can infect N. tabacum 35S::NIb, but not the wild-type N. tabacum, in agreement with previous results (Li and Carrington 1995) . TEV is the full-length wild-type virus, capable of infecting both wild-type N. tabacum and 35S::NIb transgenic plants. When wild-type N. tabacum plants were coinoculated with different mixtures of TEV:TEV-ÁNIb (1:100 to 100:1), we detected only infection by TEV. Coinfected wild-type plants were probably not observed because the low cellular multiplicity of infection of TEV in N. tabacum (Tromas et al. 2014 ) precludes cellular coinfection, especially early in infection. TEV-DNIb has a 16% smaller genome than TEV. If 1) a relationship between genome size and virus replication exists (Sakai et al. 1999; Zwart et al. 2014) and 2) dependence on in trans NIb expression for replication does not impose a large fitness burden to the virus, then NIb deletion in the virus genome will cause a faster replication and a selective advantage over a full-length wild-type virus. We therefore inoculated 15 N. tabacum 35S::NIb plants with a 1:1 mixture of ground infectious tissue with TEV and TEV-DNIb and measured the ratio of the two variants at 7, 21, and 63 dpi using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Five plants were analyzed for each time point, meaning that each data point represents an independent measurement. On the basis of these data, we estimated the selective advantage for TEV as the per day selection rate constant W (Materials and Methods). A significant, upward-sloping linear regression was observed between time and the ratio of the TEV-DNIb:TEV ( fig. 1 ; r 2 ¼ 0.632, F 1,14 ¼ 22.330, P < 0.001), meaning that the ratio of the viruses shifts significantly toward TEV-ÁNIb, and this virus therefore has a significantly higher competitive fitness. We estimated that W ¼ 1.028 þ 0.006 d À1 (þ1 SD), suggesting that TEV-DNIb will slowly displace the wild-type virus in transgenic plants. If genome size was inversely proportional to fitness and the 16% reduction in genome size were the only determinant of fitness for TEV-DNIb, we would expect The 95% confidence interval for our estimate of W is 1.016-1.040 d À1 , suggesting that 1) there is a cost to depend on in trans NIb expression, but 2) this cost is partially compensated for by faster replication of TEV-DNIb, resulting in a higher W than the wild-type virus. Our data therefore support the idea of a relationship between genome size and fitness, and suggest that viruses harboring deletions in NIb will outcompete the wild-type virus in NIbexpressing plants. Therefore, NIRV expression might also lead to conditions favoring the replication of virus variants, with deletions in the gene(s) encoded for by the NIRV. However, the accumulation of viruses with large genomic deletions due to in trans expression of virus' genes will also depend on mutational supply, specifically how often recombination generates viruses with deletions in NIb that conserve the reading frame in downstream genes.
