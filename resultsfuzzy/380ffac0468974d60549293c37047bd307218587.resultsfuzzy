The (Table 2 ). We chose one positive sample in each farm for sequencing, and the three samples were identified as PDCoV. The prevalence of PDCoV in suckling piglets of the three farms was up to 84.8%, and 68.1% in sows. There was the same prevalence rate (57.1%) in weaned pigs (30-60 days old) and fattening pigs (over 90 days old) ( Table 2 ). All the infected pigs had vomit and diarrhea symptoms, but some sows infected with PDCoV showed transient diarrhea only lasting for 1 day. In addition, RT-PCR results of PEDV, TGEV, SADS-CoV and PoRVA/B/C detection were all negative.
