Of the daily symptom screenings conducted in 1015 employees who worked during the 2007-2008 outbreak, 254 had respiratory symptoms prompting the collection of a nasal wash. Ninety-one nasal wash samples (34%) had at least 1 respiratory virus detected, including 14 samples (15%) with RSV. Multiple other respiratory viruses detected in employees included human metapneumovirus (n ¼ 12; 13%), influenza A (n ¼ 14; 15%), influenza B (n ¼ 13; 14%), coronavirus (n ¼ 18; 20%), parainfluenza type 1 (n ¼ 2; 2%), and parainfluenza type 3 (n ¼ 2; 2%). Twelve employees had RSV detected from December 20, 2007 to March 13, 2008 , with 2 employees positive on repeat testing. Ten (83%) had direct patient contact; 4 of these worked in the transplant or oncology departments. The first employee with RSV detected had no direct contact with patients with documented RSV, although she had been symptomatic since early December with an upper respiratory illness. Of the 12 employees with RSV, only 1 had contact with a patient with documented RSV. However, transmission between the employee and patient seemed unlikely because the timing of symptom onset and diagnosis dates did not indicate an epidemiologic link between the 2 cases.
