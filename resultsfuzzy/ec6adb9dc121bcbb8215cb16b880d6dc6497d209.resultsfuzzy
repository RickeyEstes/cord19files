It . https://doi.org/10.1101/294488 doi: bioRxiv preprint To isolate and sequence pre-miRNAs we first immunoprecipitated AGO proteins from HEK293T cells with the pan-AGO-2A8 antibody (42) (Fig. 1A) . RNA was purified from AGO immunoprecipitates, dephosphorylated and labeled with P 32 -Î³-ATP. Autoradiography of the RNA gel showed a major band at 20-25 nt, representing mature miRNAs, and several other prominent bands between 50-80 nt, corresponding to the size range of pre-miRNAs (Fig. 1B) . We excised gel slices from both of these regions and generated high-throughput sequencing libraries, referred to herein as miRNA-seq and pre-miRNA-seq libraries, respectively. Previous attempts to sequence pre-miRNAs have been unsuccessful due to the inaccessibility of the pre-miRNA 5' ends. Therefore, we used a method that attaches the 5' linker through a CircLigase-mediated cDNA circularization step (see Methods) (19, 29) . Using this approach, we successfully generated high-throughput sequencing libraries for both pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs. We obtained 27.8 and 9.8 million reads with sufficient adapter sequence from the pre-miRNA-seq and mature miRNA-seq libraries, respectively (Table S1). Given that pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs contain non-templated modifications at their 3' ends, we reasoned that standard alignment pipelines would be limited in their ability to align these sequences to miRBase. Therefore, we developed an alignment pipeline that utilized the first 35 nt of the pre-miRNA-seq (18 nt for miRNA-seq) reads for alignment (Fig. 1C) , followed by Smith-Waterman local alignment to extend the read as far as possible along the mapped miRNA sequence (see Methods) (43) (44) (45) . After all possible nucleotide matches were made, we selected .

We performed this analysis on pre-miRNA-seq, miRNA-seq, and smRNAseq (without IP) from human HEK293T cells as well as pre-miRNA-seq and mature miRNA-seq data previously generated using the same technique on MEFs (19) . We successfully aligned 10.8% of pre-miRNA-seq, 98.7% of miRNAseq, and 52.4% of smRNA-seq reads to the human miRBase v20 annotation set (Figs. 1D, S1A, and Table S1 ). We were not surprised to find such high rates of mapping for mature miRNAs, however, a 10% mapping rate for pre-miRNAs is significantly higher than previous attempts to sequence pre-miRNAs without pre-miRNA specific primers (0.8%) (27) . Using the datasets previously generated from MEFs, we had a much higher rate of pre-miRNA-seq reads mapping (44%), but mapped fewer miRNA-seq reads (90.3%) ( Fig. S2A and Table S1 ). These differences likely represent variable experimental conditions and amounts of starting material and/or biological differences in the smRNA populations between these two mammals. Overall, we obtained pre-miRNA-seq reads mapping to 367 annotated human microRNAs and 267 annotated mouse microRNAs (Table S2) . For libraries prepared from smaller RNA species, we mapped reads to 931 (HEK239T miRNA-seq), 567 (MEF miRNAs-seq), and 1,364 (HEK293T smRNAseq) miRBase miRNAs. We examined the size distribution of mapped pre-miRNA-seq reads and found that they were broadly distributed between 55-65 nt in both cell types (Figs. 1E and S2B). In contrast, miRNA-seq reads, were tightly . CC-BY 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

We determined the abundance, end concordance, and non-templated additions for all mapped miRNAs and generated coverage plots to represent these data, which are available for download at http://gregorylab.bio.upenn.edu/AGO_IP_Seq/ (Table   S2 ; examples in Figs. 1G-H). Together, our biochemical and bioinformatic approaches provide a data rich resource for the global and unbiased analysis of pre-miRNAs in two mammals.
