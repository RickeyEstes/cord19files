To standardize the fermented H. cordata (FHC) manufacturing process, 6 Bacillus strains were isolated and identified using 16S rDNA sequencing. The results of BLAST analyses showed that the sequences were most closely related to various strains of the Bacillus genus, with a maximal identity of 99%. The phylogenetic tree, which was constructed on the basis of 16S rDNA sequences, is shown in Fig. 1 . The 16S rRNA gene domains of the strains 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 consisted of 1388 bp, 564 bp, 556 bp, 1441 bp, 556 bp, and 522 bp, respectively (Fig. 2) . They were confirmed to belong to the Bacillus genus, and identified as B. amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum FZB42 T , B. licheniformis ATCC 14580 T , B. aerius 24K T , B. methylotrophicus CBMB205 T , B. safensis FO-036b T , and B. sonorensis NRRL B-23154 T strains (Fig. 3) . The different strains were designated as SMh-1 to SMh-6. Thus, all the species isolated from these extracts belonged to the Bacillus genus. Notably, majority of Bacillus species are assigned the "generally regarded as safe" (GRAS) status (Patel et al., 2010) . Philip et al. (2009) have showed that fermentation increases the flavonoid content (Philip et al., 2009) . FHCE and HCE were examined for their flavonoid composition by using HPLC. Individual constituents were identified by comparing their peaks, UV spectra, and retention times, with those of the corresponding reference standards (Fig. 2) . The percentage of each flavonoid was estimated using a calibration curve. The flavonoids present in the FHCE and HCE were rutin (2.1 mg/100 g, 1.1 mg/100 ml), quercitrin (16.6 mg/ 100 g, 11.8 mg/100 g), and quercetin (0.5 mg/100 g, 0.2 mg/ 100 g). The contents of rutin, quercitrin, and quercetin increased in the FHCE by 1.9-fold, 1.4-fold, and 2.5-fold, respectively, compared to the HCE. The increase in the flavonoid content of FHCE was attributed to the change in the organic content, which was due to fermentation carried out by the Bacillus strains identified in the FHCE. This broad spectrum of nutraceuticals with different characteristics allowed a comprehensive assessment of the cytotoxicity associated with these flavonoids as well as a comparison between the different cytotoxicity assays and the different fish cell lines, namely, RBL-2H3 and RAW264.7. To determine the cell viability of RAW264.7 macrophages and RBL-2H3 cells that had been treated with HCE and FHCE, we used an MTT assay. In this assay, a mitochondrial enzyme in living cells, succinate dehydrogenase, cleaves the tetrazolium ring, converting the MTT to an insoluble purple formazan. Therefore, the amount of formazan produced is directly proportional to the number of viable cells. The cytotoxic effects of FHCE and HCE on the 2 kinds of cells, namely, RAW264.7 and RBL-2H3, were studied at different concentrations, i.e., 1000 µg/ml, 100 µg/ml, and 10 µg/ ml. Cell viability was not affected by FHCE and HCE at any of these concentrations. Thus, FHCE and HCE are not cytotoxic. Macrophages are the first line of host defense against bacterial infection and cancer growth (Higgins et al., 2007) . Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria can quantitatively induce iNOS-mediated cellular responses and Fig. 4 .

In our study, LPS treatment decreased cell viability with increasing doses, indicating that LPS has dose-dependent effects on cytotoxicity. We evaluated the protective effects of FHCE and HCE by testing the in vitro cell viability of RAW264.7 cells treated with LPS (LD 50 , 38.64 µg/ml LPS). Protective effects of FHCE and HCE on LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells at 1000 µg/ml, 100 µg/ml, and 10 µg/ml were 94.14%, 88.61%, and 76.28%, respectively, and 88.76%, 67.58%, and 55.70%, respectively. These results showed that fermentation of H. cordata increased the viability of LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The expression of flavonoids in LPS-induced inflammatory cells is shown in Table 1 . As expected, FHCE induced higher levels of rutin, quercetin, and quercitrin compared to HCE. The flavonoid levels in LPS-stimulated FHC-treated cells were similar to those in FHCE-treated cells. The effects of different concentrations of FHCE and HCE on HepG2 cell viability are shown in Fig. 5 . The percentages of inhibition induced by 1000 µg/ml, 100 µg/ml, and 10 µg/ml FHCE and HCE on HepG2 cell viability were 38.31%, 47.40%, and 50.54%, respectively, and 47.72%, 62.66%, and 68.66%, respectively. In addition, the detection of rutin, quercetin, and quercitrin at approximately 20 µM, 100 µM, and 20 µM correlated with the effects observed in the MTT assay (Table 1) . Viability and activity of the HepG2 cells treated with FHCE were lower than those of the HepG2 cells treated with HCE at various con-centrations. These results showed that traditionally fermented H. cordata products contain Bacillus strains. Treating cells with extracts derived from fermented H. cordata inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory cell death and inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells. FHCE also have an increased content of flavonoids, including rutin, quercetin, and quercitrin. Our results also indicated that the flavonoid constituents of FHCE exhibit excellent anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-stimulated cells. These results suggest that the effects of fermentation on H. cordata warrant further investigation. abcdef Means in the same row not sharing a common superscript are significantly different between groups at p < 0.05. * p < 0.05 in two-sided student's t-test on FHCE and HCE.
