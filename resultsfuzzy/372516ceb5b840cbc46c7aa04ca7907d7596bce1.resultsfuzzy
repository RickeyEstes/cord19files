The main steps involved in the construction of the genosensor were immobilisation of a single strand of nucleic acids (probe), hybridisation with a complementary strand (target) and electrochemical detection. As electrochemical detection was carried out indirectly, using an enzymatic label (AP) that converts a substrate in an electroactive product, the electrochemical behaviour of several substrates in this system was studied first.
