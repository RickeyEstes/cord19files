All the primers for both ( , ) settings are provided as Supplementary data as are the predicted amplicon start and end positions in each target genome from a multiplex of the primers for a given viral target set. Tiled amplification of these viruses required from 2 to 116 primers (Table 1) . Primers are predicted to be specific to the target organisms for the most part, although not exclusively (Tables 3 and 4) . In separate seminested PCR reactions, forward primers were paired with a reverse primer from an overlapping reaction to verify that product was generated for each overlapping region. 5 3 Figure 2 : Diagram of the murine hepatitis virus (MHV) genome regions for which primer sets were tested. The approximate position of each region amplified by primer sets is shown (MHV genome is not drawn to scale). Each multiplex reaction consisted of primer sets that do not overlap in regions amplified. Each region is amplified using 3 forward primers and 3 reverse primers (Table S1 ; see Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/101894). For example, the A primer set consists of 3 forward primers (A1F, A2F, and A3F) and 3 reverse primers (A1R, A2R, and A3R). To verify that each region is amplified in the multiplex reaction, a second set of seminested PCRs were performed using the amplicons from the multiplex reaction as a template. For example, to ensure region A was amplified, the PCR product from the A mix multiplex was diluted 1 : 10,000 and used as template in a PCR reaction with AR1 primer paired with BF2 (Table S2) . Primers are labeled according to genome region (A-I) and primer direction (F = forward, R = reverse). The few cases of off-target amplification come from closely related organisms in the same family such as Old World (OW) and New World (NW) Arenaviruses or other Flaviviruses amplified by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) multiplex. The three exceptions were a single amplicon of 2830 bp from a BAC clone of Zea mays (maize) from the Ebola 3 kb multiplex, a single amplicon of 3610 bp from Methylococcus capsulatus str. Bath from the OW Arena S segment 3 kb multiplex and a single amplicon of 851 bp from a human BAC from a library at CalTech. All three of these predicted nontarget amplicons result from a single primer in each of those reactions performing as both forward primer (FP) and reverse primer (RP). Nonetheless, the primer multiplexes described here should strongly favor the preferential enrichment of desired targets. Deriving each primer set required multiple sequence alignment and a call to run tile primers in the current PriMux software distribution (http://sourceforge.net/projects/primux/). In comparison, primer design with the JCVI pipeline for any of these target sets would require the following steps: (1) inspection of a phylogeny for the full target set to build multiple smaller clade-level sets with no more than 10% sequence variation, (2) realignment of the clade-level sets, (3) running of the JCVI pipeline on each clade set, (4) assessing which target sequences are not amplified after one design round and rerun the pipeline on those sequences for each clade, (5) and repeating step 4 until all target sequences are predicted to be amplified. Multiplexed primers were tested in the lab as primer pairs in individual reactions then as multiplexed reactions. Twentytwo of the primer pairs worked and four failed to give a product and were paired with other primers in subsequent testing or if necessary, replaced with an alternative primer. Amplicons were detected in the expected size ranges, confirming amplification of the expected regions from the multiplexed sets ( Figure S1 ). In some cases extra bands were present, but they were generally smaller than the targeted size; this was common when the template cDNA was obtained from a clinical sample rather than high titer cell culture derived viral stock from this study. The PCR products generated with these highly multiplexed assays were then sequenced using Illumina ultradeep sequencing with a high fidelity polymerase. These primers yielded high coverage averaging 150,000x of the genomic regions amplified by the multiplex primers.
