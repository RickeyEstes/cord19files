Given these differences between configuration-type models and ERGMs (the former models better capture the degree distribution, the latter models better capture clustering) it is unclear which model should best capture epidemic dynamics. For the HS75, HS60 and relationships networks, final size results for ERGMs show closer agreement than the configuration-type models to those of the empirical network. On the other hand, the difference from using a configuration-type model may be small. Results for the HS75 network illustrate some advantage to including subgraphs of size 4, but no advantage for larger subgraphs. After including subgraphs of size 4, differences with using an ERGM may be considered small enough that the configuration-type models are sufficient. As the density increases, the differences in final size from using those subgraphs becomes negligible. We must emphasize again the special role that cliques can play. None of our networks exhibit household structure, whereby a separate network process creates cliques within households which are then loosely connected to each other. We would expect to observe a larger impact from including cliques in those networks. By comparison, the random network models ("ER", "ER fix") show the worst agreement with results from the empirical network. They are indistinguishable from each other in the examples shown here. When the final size is very high (above 60%), final size is consistently overestimated by these models. Below 60% they may either over-or under-estimate, although they under-estimate when the density is not too high. Because these models are not effective in capturing either the degree distribution or clustering, it remains unclear how to attribute differences in epidemic dynamics to these two features. In the case of high density, highly clustered networks like HS6, there is little variation between the models. Differences from using the empirical network are generally small. Cliques are undoubtedly present, but because the edge density is so high, cliques arise naturally from the large number of edges. This is a different mechanism for clique formation than the one underlying household structure. Our results are largely consistent with results of Miller [8] which argued in the context of configuration models, that 1) for reasonable networks clustering is only important for final size if node degrees are typically small, and 2) as a consequence, for moderately large transmissibility final size will be unaltered by clustering. Our HS75 network has the smallest node degrees and illustrates some effect of clustering on SIR final size, while HS60 and HS6 have larger node degrees and more clustering but reveal no significant differences in SIR final size across network models with varying amounts of clustering. Miller [8] argues that although "clustering" is usually taken to mean triangles, it could also refer to other short cycles such as squares and 2-triangles that can also impact the spread of infectious diseases. Some of the network models considered here (especially the ERGM) are parameterised to capture such network features. However, even in a network with mean node degree of 2.5 we found only small differences arising from the ability of a network model to capture such features. A much larger difference is apparent from what might be considered the absence of clustering in our HS75 network due to long chains off a highly-connected core. The results on epidemic duration show similarity between edge-triangle models and the ERGM, and all show mean epidemic durations that are too short compared to the observed network. Long chains can slow an epidemic by increasing the number of transmissions required to reach nodes and might also increase the number of cutpoints in the network. Each cutpoint has the potential to interrupt the epidemic by transmission failure. Overall, this suggests there may be advantage in exploring subgraphs that promote longer chains in addition to ones that promote increased clustering. A common theme in our results is that results for edge-triangle models are between ERGMs and Erdős-Rényi models. This really is not surprising. Edge-triangle models capture some, but not all, of the number of triangles captured by ERGMs, due to overlapping triangles that must become stubs. In addition, edge-triangle models randomly rewire stubs in a manner that removes structure, not unlike the random edges of Erdős-Rényi networks. Another observation we can make arises from the fact the edge-triangle models have far fewer 3-and 4-triangles than the ERGM, yet show comparable final size results. Our results suggest that while they play an important role in fitting ERGMs, these subgraphs are not playing an important role in determining epidemic dynamics.
