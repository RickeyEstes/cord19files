This section presents numerical studies, demonstrating the efficacy of the models whose primary known data are given in Section 5. Lingo (www.lindo.com) software was used to solve [M2] and [M3] . The purpose of the numerical experiments is to demonstrate application of the proposed methods for evacuation and temporary resettlement of people in Wenchuan County after the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake. Table 4 summarizes the six experimental scenarios, corresponding purposes, and experimental steps. Via these experiments, the proposed models are demonstrated; the effects of parameters on solutions and their sensitivities are analyzed; the consistencies of or conflicts between various costs are quantitatively studied. The analytical results can be used for decision-makings for post-disaster evacuation and temporary resettlement. Performance of [M2] or [M3] is examined in each scenario. (Fig. 6) (2) Demonstrate the effects on f Psych , f GInt , f Trans and f Build , and the effects on f P and f C when they have equal weights (1) Use P 0 as the base setting of parameters; (2) Set the weights in W to 0.

( 1) because their values will be changed when the parameters change. Table 5 presents values of min(f ⁄ ) and max (f ⁄ ) for the first and second experimental scenarios. (2) Experimental results by minimizing only f Psych , f GInt , f Trans , f Build or f C (Fig. 6) . (1) By minimizing f Psych , the evacuation and resettlement can be completed within the first 9 days. The psychological penalty cost reaches its lowest (0) after six days, and building cost remains high from day 1 to day 7. The psychological intervention cost also reaches the allowed maximum within the first 5 days. Minimization of psychological penalty cost increases the costs of building shelters and psychological intervention. (2) The minimum of f GInt reaches 0 while psychological penalty cost increases gradually during the first 7 days. Minimization of psychological intervention delays building shelters and victim evacuation. Therefore, minimizing psychological intervention cost lowers psychological penalty costs and ignores the importance of evacuation and resettlement. (3) Minimizing f Trans reduces the NIP and the number of infective people who attempt to evacuate. Therefore, the number of temporary shelters will also be minimized. Psychological penalty cost also reaches its minimum on the sixth day. Psychological intervention cost gradually increases during the first 6 days and then declines to 0 the following 4 days. However, the reduction in this value does not minimize building cost. Generally, the minimization of transportation cost is paid by the psychological intervention cost and building cost. (4) The minimization of f Build postpones building temporary shelters. Before construction of many temporary shelters, psychological penalty cost and psychological intervention cost increase gradually. This increase in monetary costs is also reflected by the increase to the NIP and number of mental health workers needed. (5) Minimizing psychological intervention cost has effect similar to those effects of minimizing f Build . Psychological penalty cost gradually increases over the first 7 days. As building cost increases, psychological penalty cost decreases because more victims can be evacuated to temporary shelters. (3) When weights of the costs returned by solving [M2] and [M3] are equal, the resulting solutions indicate that building costs have almost the same tendency during the first 10 days, whereas the other three costs (psychological penalty cost, psychological intervention cost, and transportation cost) are distributed differently (Fig. 7) . When the four costs are equally weighted, psychological penalty cost is high while psychological intervention cost is minimized (Fig. 7(1a) ). The curves of the four costs are explicitly distributed (Fig. 7(2a) ). As indicated by the curves (Fig. 7(1b) and (2b)), many mental health workers are needed during the period from day 3 to day 9 in the results of solving [M3] . When the sum of monetary costs (psychological penalty cost, psychological intervention cost, and transportation cost) is a single objective, the significance of psychological intervention is reflected by the fact that many mental health workers are deployed. However, when the four costs are weighted equally, building cost remains high while psychological penalty cost is also high. (4) Table 6 presents sensitivity test results for eight groups of parameters (P I 0;s ; P S 0;s ; a; C P (4) Although psychological intervention cost is directly affected by C P t , it has no effect on other costs. (5) Notably, P PU t affects psychological intervention cost mostly, followed by psychological penalty cost. Rationally, because the number of mental health workers is limited, sufficient workers in the early stages would be recruited when the recruit cost is high. When P PU t is increased markedly, the psychological intervention method will be used excessively, which can be seen with the large increase in psychological intervention cost, while its effects on other costs are minimal. (6) Decreasing P ZU t affects the four costs significantly, especially psychological intervention cost. By decreasing P ZU t , decision-makers will use the capacities as many as possible, such that capacities in the early days after a disaster with high building costs may be fully utilized. When P ZU t is increased to the extent that resettlement sites can accommodate all disaster infective victims soon after the disaster, no worker is needed to treat the victims at the disaster sites. (7) Although C INC t directly affects building cost, it affects psychological intervention cost more, and affects psychological penalty cost consistently. The effect of C INC t on transportation cost is minor. (8) Transportation cost is markedly affected by C T s;d and also slightly affects psychological intervention cost; however, it does not affect the psychological penalty cost and building cost. (4) Fig. 8 shows the effects of varying the initial stock of shelters at resettlement sites P A 0;d on the four costs. Notably, this study does not consider the cost for reserving the initial stock of shelters. With the increase in stock, the building cost decreases linearly; psychological intervention cost drops to almost 0 when the stock increases to 500 at each resettlement site; psychological penalty cost drops rapidly when stock reaches 1000 and then declines slowly; the varying curve of transportation cost reaches the minimum and then increases very slowly. (5) By solving the [M3] with different weights for psychological penalty and monetary costs, 101 pairs of the two costs are obtained. Fig. 9 shows the distribution of solutions and their Pareto font. A decrease of 80% to psychological penalty cost can be achieved by increasing monetary cost by 37.5%. (6) Fig. 10 shows the effects of different psychological penalty costs associated with wait times on the solutions. Here, a linear function (t) and four functions with different coefficients (1/4, 1/2, 3/4 and 1) for squared wait times (t 2 ) are considered and computational results for the four costs are compared. Psychological intervention cost, transportation cost, and building cost increase almost linearly when e a (t) is formulated as t, t 2 /4, t 2 /2, 3t 2 /4 and t 2 . However, the increase in psychological intervention cost is fastest. Psychological penalty cost increases nonlinearly when e a (t) is sequentially formulated as t, t 2 /4, t 2 /2, 3t 2 /4 and t 2 . When e a (t) is formulated as 3t 2 /4 and t 2 , the cost increases rapidly. The discussion of experimental results is generalized as follows. (1) The costs of psychological penalty, psychological intervention, and transportation and building shelters may be correlated or conflict. First, minimizing psychological penalty cost is consistent the increased costs for building shelters and psychological intervention. Second, when psychological intervention is excessively emphasized, the evacuation and resettlement process is delayed. Third, although transportation cost is minor when compared to total monetary cost, it is representative of the number of victims affected by panic spread because it is computed based on the number of evacuated victims. Fourth, building cost conflicts with psychological intervention cost and psychological penalty cost. Further, psychological intervention cost and psychological penalty cost also conflict. Fifth, minimization of transportation cost indicates that the number of victims influenced by panic spread is reduced, which in turn increases psychological intervention cost. Finally, when psychological penalty cost and the entire monetary cost are considered separately, psychological intervention cost can be used to balance psychological penalty and psychological intervention costs. (2) Of all eight groups of parameters, P I 0;s affects solutions most. All costs are related to the number of infective people and the increase in number of infective people. When the value of P I 0;s is increased and resources are limited, the costs of psychological intervention and psychological penalty will increase markedly. The initial number of infective people and susceptible people affect the four costs greatly. Therefore, these numbers should be reduced as much as possible. Although the number of infective people cannot be reduced, some susceptible people can be persuaded to take part in the rescue processes. Therefore, mental health workers can focus on infective people. The psychological pressure due to wait times (a) imposes great effects on costs related to victim psychology. (3) Psychological intervention may be overused when the number of available mental health workers is adequate. This overuse does not reduce psychological penalty cost significantly, and it also does not affect building and transportation costs significantly. (4) Expanding the limits of resources (e.g., mental health workers, reserved resettlement resources and replenishment capability for resettlements) can affect psychological intervention cost and psychological penalty cost considerably. And the expansion itself may have a high cost because the probability of disaster occurrences is in fact low. Therefore, the increase in replenishment capability is practical for critical relief resources. (5) Although the unit cost of building a shelter affects building cost directly, it affects psychological intervention cost more, and also affects psychological penalty cost. Therefore, controlling unit building cost for temporary shelters contributes markedly to cost reductions related to victim psychology. Increasing the supply of shelters by emergency supply chain management and logistics is important to post-disaster psychological relief. (6) In comparing to psychological intervention cost and building cost, the ratio of transportation cost to the overall monetary cost is small. Although the ratios affect solutions, they can be neglected. However, when disasters such as earthquakes and landslides occur, road damage may increase transportation costs and evacuation difficulties. (7) Psychological intervention cost is the cost affected most by the initial resettlement capacity because infective people can be accommodated quickly after a disaster. Then, the psychological penalty cost and building cost can be markedly reduced. Therefore, improving the stock of temporary shelters or providing alternatives can reduce psychological and monetary costs significantly. (8) By the Pareto analytical tool, the tradeoffs between psychological penalty cost and monetary cost can be examined. In the experiments, a small increase to monetary cost (37.5%) can cause psychological penalty cost to decrease significantly (80%). Therefore, when the budget allows, psychological penalty perceived by victims can be minimized. By extending the proposed methods, the tradeoffs among four costs are revealed. (9) The magnitude of psychological penalty cost induced by wait times directly affects total psychological penalty cost. However, this magnitude cannot be determined directly according to disaster type or other simple quantification methods. It is affected by the extent of damage, disaster severity, and post-disaster natural and social environments. Therefore, minimizing the strength of panic and panic spread is important for evacuation and resettlement, and the recovery of disaster areas. Psychological intervention and timely rescue are general ways to reduce the strength of panic and panic spread.
