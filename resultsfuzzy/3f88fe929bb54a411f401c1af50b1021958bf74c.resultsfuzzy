To study exposure in the two zones, Figs  and (x ¼ 0.6, y ¼ 0.2, z ¼ 0.26) for zones 1 and 2, respectively. Results obtained by the well-mixed model are depicted for comparison. The concentration level in zone 1 decreases exponentially. At this sampling point (breathing height), the well-mixed model predicts a slower decrease compared to the drift-flux model. Besides the advection process, the overall particle decay rate is augmented by the low vertical mixing rate. It is shown in Fig. 5(a) -(c) that the upward dispersion rate is low and hence at the breathing height, the concentration is low. For the well-mixed model, the concentration in the entire zone is always uniform. For zone 2, the concentration profile at the breathing height increases to reach a peak and then starts to decay. particle sizes shown here, there is a very low concentration during the first 60 s at the breathing height. This differs significantly from the well-mixed model prediction. The lag time to reach the peak concentration also varies notably between the two models, 180-240 s for the drift-flux model and 60-180 s for the well-mixed analytical model. The peak concentration levels predicted by the drift-flux simulation are always less than those predicted by the well-mixed model. In summary, due to the underlying homogeneous assumption, the wellmixed model underestimates the breathing height concentration in zone 1 and, more significantly, it severely overestimates the concentration in zone 2 for 0-120 s. The decay rates predicted by the both models also differ. Particles may be trapped in stagnant regions and cannot be removed instantly, so a smaller decay rate is thus predicted. The well-mixed model cannot account for this stagnation phenomenon. One crucial parameter for IAQ assessment is the exposure (or dose). We present the normalized accumulated exposure ð R T 0 C þ dtÞ versus time for the first 6 min. The accumulated exposures (Figs. 6(b) and 7(b)) are calculated based on numerical integration of the corresponding concentration profiles as shown in Figs. 6(a) and 7(a). For zone 1, the initial concentration is maximum but decreases rapidly with time and finally approaches zero. This results in a decreasing exposure rate with time. As expected, the well-mixed model always predicts a lower exposure as compared to the current simulation. Exposure in zone 2 shows very different trend. The initial simulation exposure is low, but the trend is increasing with time. For all particle sizes presented, the predictions by the wellmixed model are always higher than those predicted by the drift-flux simulation. This can be explained by the trend observed in Figs. 6(b) and 7(b) in which the exposure predicted by simulation is always higher. By conservation of mass, the accumulated exposure in zone 2 must show the opposite trend as observed in Figs. 6(a) and 7(a). For 10 mm particles, the deposition rate is very high and significant loss occurs in zone 1 before advection becomes important. The validity of using a single-point concentration as a surrogate for the entire zone has been discussed by Klepeis (1999) . The author suggests that in realistic situations, the well-mixed assumption generally holds, on the condition that the exposure time is much longer than the emission time.
