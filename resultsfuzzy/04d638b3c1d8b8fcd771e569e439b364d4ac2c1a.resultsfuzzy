A total of 442 samples collected between November 2012 and April 2014 were analysed for the evaluation of the Luminex assay. Three hundred forty-eight samples were from children (â‰¤15 years old) and 94 samples from adults. The male/female ratio was 0.62 (273): 0.38 (169). The median age of children was 1 year (Interquartile range, IQR: 1, 2) and of adults 46 years (IQR: 34, 72). Overall, 302 specimens (68.3%) were positive by either Luminex or reference assays or both. One hundred forty samples (31.7%) remained undiagnosed. ENT/Rhi was the most frequently detected pathogen by the two techniques (159 over 403 total count of all pathogens, 40%), followed by hBoV (n = 45, 11%) and PIV3 (n = 42, 10%). Less frequently detected were ADV (n = 32, 8%), hMPV (n = 29, 7%), InFA (n = 22, 6%), hCoV (n = 22, 6%), RSV A and B (n = 21, 5%), PIV4 (n = 12, 3%), InFB (n = 10, 2.5%), PIV1 (n = 6, 1%) and PIV2 (n = 3, 0.5%). Regarding mixed-infection, the Luminex assay also detected more co-infections compared to the reference assays: 68 versus 47. The maximum number of pathogens detected in a single patient was 4. Parechoviruses were detected in four samples by the reference assays, but were not included in the Luminex assay. HCoV were not subtyped by reference assays. also detected by Luminex assay (true positive rate or "sensitivity" against reference assays as gold standard). There were 112 pathogens detected by Luminex but not detected by references, corresponding to an additional 1.8% (95%CI: 1.4-2.1) positives. In addition, there were 24 pathogens detected by reference assays but not detected by the Luminex, corresponding to an additional 0.3% (95% CI: 0.2-0.6) positives.
