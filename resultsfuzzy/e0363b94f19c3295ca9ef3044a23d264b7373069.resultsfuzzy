Comparison with the existing system-GeneMark.hmm No coronavirus-specific annotation systems have been available so far. Currently, GeneMark.hmm is commonly used for gene-finding in virus genomes [10] . We submitted the SARS-CoV TOR2 genome to Gene-Mark.hmm website using default settings and the prediction result is listed in Table 1 . It can be seen that the predicted 'gene 1' is questionable, because of its short length and the lack of a start codon. An important structural protein gene (small envelope protein E), which is located from 26117 to 26347, was not predicted by GeneMark.hmm. Moreover, we submitted the same genome sequence several times to the website, however, the prediction results were not identical at all times, indicating that the system is unstable. An important structural protein gene (N protein), which is located from 28120 to 29388, was predicted as 'gene 10' and 'gene 11' (marked with * in Table 1 ) in some predicted results. Sometimes, 'gene 9' (marked with * in Table 1 ), a quite conserved ORF in all of the 11 SARS-CoV genomes mentioned above, was not predicted. Compared with GeneMark.hmm for gene-finding in the SARS-CoV genomes, the performance of ZCURVE_CoV is better (see Table 3 in the supplementary materials).
