We also investigated the effect of polyproteins that are cleaved to produce a number of polypeptides. ). When we incorporated these to the prediction of percent disorder for the whole genome, we found that both methods produced almost similar values of percent disorder (œÅ = 0.87, p < 2.2 x 10 -16 ; Figure   S3 ). We repeated the complete analyses by substituting percent disorder with the new percent disorder obtained from cleaved peptides and found similar results. Thus, while for individual proteins, investigators need to consider carefully whether they are interested in the disorder in the precursor polyprotein, or as is more usually of interest, in the mature post-cleavage products, it is important to ensure that the predictions are carried out on the appropriate state, since disorder is greater at protein termini. However, for this overall survey it is unlikely that the true cleavage states of all protein products are known. Our overall analysis will tend towards under-predicting the disorder of proteins found within poloyproteins, since in general incomplete viral genome analysis under-predicts cleavage. However, the overall analysis appears insensitive to the minor biases introduced by this under-prediction.
