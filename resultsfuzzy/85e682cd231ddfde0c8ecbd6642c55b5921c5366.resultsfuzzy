Applying the Bayesian approach offers the advantage of introducing prior distributions and thus has the potential to incorporate knowledge on the spread of influenza based on previous studies or observations of epidemics into the model. Informative priors, including sceptical and enthusiastic ones on the protective effect of vaccination, were incorporated. Combined with the weight of the evidence derived from the collected data using the proposed Bayesian Table 6 Estimated results of Bayesian hierarchical models with random slopes using sceptical priors and enthusiastic priors on the effect of vaccination (estimate (95% credible interval)). Greenwood hierarchical models, we were able to obtain estimates on the protective effect, updated by data. Table 6 Using an enthusiastic prior showing a belief in risk reduction attributable to vaccination that concentrated at 25%, the estimated effect (β 00 ) updated by data was −0.32 for the Greenwood model and the Reed-Frost model. This figure corresponds to a risk reduction of approximately 30%, which lies between 25% (i.e., the prior belief) and 45% (i.e., the evidence provided by the data) and results from the average of the prior and the evidence derived from the data, as weighted by their strength. The comparison of the DIC between models with the two informative priors shows that the model with sceptical priors performs better. Fig. 4 represent the predicted number of cases using the fixed-effect model based on the Reed-Frost model, the fixed-effect model based on the Reed-Frost model with a generation effect, the random-intercept model based on the Reed-Frost model with a generation effect, and the random-slope model based on the Reed-Frost model with a generation effect. The predictions were applied to all subjects (Fig. 4, first column) , to those not having been vaccinated (Fig. 4, second column) , and to those who were vaccinated (Fig. 4 , third column). Considering the results of the prediction as they were applied to the overall group and the unvaccinated group, the predicted number of influenza cases was close to the observed one, with a narrow 95% CI range for all models, except for the fixed-effect model based on the Reed-Frost model with a generation effect. Although the point estimates of the predicted number of cases were close to the observed values for the prediction using the fixed-effect model based on the Reed-Frost model with a generation effect (Fig. 4, second row) , the ranges of the 95% CIs were wide. Considering the prediction applied to the unvaccinated group, the predicted results deviated from the observed numbers of cases substantially in almost all sizes of households for all models, owing to the low vaccination rates (4.1%, Table 1 ) and relative small sizes of samples compared with the unvaccinated group. Despite this deviation, the ranges of the 95% CIs for the fixed-effect model based on the Reed-Frost model with a generation effect and the random-slope model based on the Reed-Frost model with a generation effect covered the observed number of cases in the vaccinated group.
