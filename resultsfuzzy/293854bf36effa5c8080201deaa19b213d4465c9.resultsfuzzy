During the study period, 1031 patients were recruited consecutively in the study sessions, of which only one patient was excluded from the analysis as the doctor was required to remove the facemask as the patient was unable to hear ( Figure 1 ). All patients consulted the participating doctor only once during the study period. The number of patients participating per doctor ranged from 103 to 128 for the nine doctors. The characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1 . The gender and age group distribution of the participating patients were similar to previous Chinese-CARE measure studies in Hong Kong [30, 31] . Between the MASK and NoMASK groups, age and education differed significantly. Thus age and education were included in the process of mixed model building to adjust for the potential confounding effect. The distributions of the four known important Chinese-CARE score predictors (general health, type of problem, knowing the doctor and consultation time length) were similar between both MASK and NoMASK groups, but were also included for the analysis as independent predictors. The mean CARE score of the MASK group (33.93) was significantly lower (p = 0.04) than the mean of NoMASK group (34.91) ( Table 2 ). There were no significant differences between mean scores of patient satisfaction and patient enablement between the two groups, which was confirmed by regression analysis. Table 2 illustrates the unadjusted mean score value of CARE, PEI and satisfaction of the two groups. Among the four established CARE related predictors, "knowing the doctor" was pre-identified as a doctor-related factor that may potentially interact with facemask wearing on CARE measure. Figure 2 shows the total raw CARE score plotted by mask status and "knowing the doctor". Patients that were familiar with their doctor had, on average, higher CARE score than patients that were not familiar with their doctor (7.25 CARE score difference). Wearing a mask had little effect when the patient didn't know the doctor well (−0.84 CARE score difference), but among patients who knew their doctor well, CARE scores were further reduced by (−4.71 CARE score difference). This suggests a potential interaction effect.
