To develop PLANT-Dx, we first sought to create pathogen detecting molecular sensors based upon the Small Transcription Activating RNA (STAR) regulatory system. 11 This transcription activation system is based upon conditional formation of a terminator hairpin located within a target RNA upstream of a gene to be regulated: alone, the terminator hairpin forms and interrupts transcription of the downstream gene, while in the presence of a specific trans-acting STAR the hairpin cannot form and transcription proceeds ( Figure S2 ). Previous work showed that the STAR linear binding region can be changed to produce highly functional and orthogonal variants. 15 Here we sought to utilize this by replacing the linear binding region with sequences derived from genomic pathogen RNA to create new viral sensors. To do this, we utilized the secondary structure prediction algorithm NUPACK to identify regions within the genomes of CMV and PVY, that are predicted computationally to be unstructured for target RNA design (Note S1). 16 Once viral STARs were designed, reporter DNA constructs were then created in which these target sequences were placed downstream of a constitutive E. coli promoter and upstream of the CDO reporter gene coding sequence. We next designed RPA primer sets to amplify and transform a pathogen's genomic material into a DNA construct capable of synthesizing a functional STAR. Specifically, a T7 promoter and antiterminator STAR sequence were added to the 5′ end of a reverse RPA primer, which when combined with a forward primer, amplified an approximately 80 nucleotide (nt) viral sequence to produce a double-stranded
