Comment Panel B and C: How is the multiplication of these mutant viruses in autophagy deficient cells? If growth kinetics of mutant viruses are similar to that of parental virus, this would allow the authors to confirm the antiviral role of autophagy on MERS-CoV and to reveal a possible requirement of orf4b or orf5 to counteract it. Response: "Deletion of p4b and p5 led to a decreased accumulation of P62 and LC3B-II/I, suggesting that both proteins contribute to the inhibition of the autophagic flux (Fig.  S4C,D) . The p4b-and p5-deleted viruses as well as the WT control virus grew to higher levels in ATG5 knockout Vero cells compared to WT cells (Fig. S4E,F) . However, the p4b and p5-deleted viruses showed overall an up to 10-fold decreased replication in both WT and ATG5 knockout cells compared to WT virus suggesting a p4b-and p5-dependent attenuation of virus replication that is independent of ATG5directed autophagy." Comment Figure 6 The titer of the legend does not reflect the results. No data in this figure demonstrates that SKP2 inhibition reduces viral replication. 


Section:the reviewer also noted an intriguing point, to which we only can offer a speculation at the moment, namely the apparent effect on the overall levels of lc3b (lc3b-i). we quantified lc3b-i separately, and confirmed a difference, which came out nonsignificant though. we mention this now in the discussion as follows (starting at the end of page 24): "….the absence of p4b and p5 during mers-cov replication may also result in lower lc3b levels compared to mers-cov wildtype-infected but also to the mock-infected control cells. this points to a more complex interaction between virus replication and autophagy; p4b and p5 may counteract a response of the host to viral infection, but the functional relevance of their link to autophagy requires further investigation….".
