Conclusion: The findings reveal that newly synthesized NP proteins are required for influenza virus replication and provide a basis for the development of shRNAs expression Plasmids as prophylaxis and therapy for influenza infection in humans. 


Section:results: the influenza virus a and b np genes when targeted with each shrna expression plasmid vectors in mdck cells, inhibited virus production in influenza virus infected-mdck cells. again, baculovirus-mediated shrnas proved equally effective mediators of inhibition by down-regulating influenza virus replication in the influenza virus infected-mdck cells.
