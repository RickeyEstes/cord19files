In order to explore the relationship between tested blood markers and disease conditions in COVID-19 patients, we first randomly selected 5 death cases and monitored dynamic changes in blood tests for each patient from Among all factors, LYM% showed the most significant and consistent trend ( Fig.1F ), indicating that this indicator might reflect the disease progression. In addition, we also investigated the indicators reflecting liver, kidney and myocardial functions. Significant changes in these indicators were usually accompanied by organ failure and cytokine storm syndromes (data not shown), which occurred at the end of disease course and thus could not reflect disease progression. Therefore, we only focused on lymphopenia in COVID-19 in the present study.
