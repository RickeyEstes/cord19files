Halomethyleniminium salts (VM Reagent) have found extensive use as formylating, halogenating and dehydroxylating reagents. 17 In addition, many kinds of heterocyclic compounds such as pyridines, quinolines, thienopyridines, quinolones, isoquinolones, naphthyridines, pyrans and furans can be efficiently prepared by ring closure reaction from acylamides under the VM conditions. 18 Although N-(2-acetylphenyl)acetamides (6) afforded 4-chloro-3formylquinolines (7), not oxazine compounds, by reaction with VM reagent at 90°C, 18a we expected the reaction of 2-acetyl-3-cyanomethylcarbonylaminobenzo[b]furans (9a, 9b) and 2-acetyl-3-ethoxycarbonylaminobenzo[b]furan (9c) prepared from 2-acetyl-3-aminobenzo[b]furans (8a, 8b) 15 to give some oxazine compounds. However, both reactions of 9a and 9c with VM reagent at low temperature (24°C) afforded 8-bromo-4-chloro-3-formylbenzo[b]furo[3,2-b]pyridine (10a), accompanied by loss of cyanomethylcarbonyl and ethoxycarbonyl groups, respectively, as shown in Scheme 2. The reaction of 9b with VM reagent also afforded 4-chloro-3-formyl-6-methoxybenzo[b]furo[3,2-b]pyridine (10b). These results were similar to the case of benzene derivative 6. We predicted that the 2-acetyl-3-(2-aralkenylcarbonylamino)benzo[b]furan derivatives (9d-o) having a stable conjugating carbonyl group on the nitrogen at 3-position would be favorable for cyclization between the 2-acetyl group and the 3-acylamino group. Some kinds of 2-acetyl-3-acylaminobenzo[b]furans (9d, 15 9e-g, 9h, 15 9i-o) were prepared by reactions of 8a and 8b with various acid chlorides such as (E)-5-phenylpenta-2-enonyl chloride, 19 cinnamoyl chlorides, 20 (E,E)-5-phenylpenta-2,4-dienoyl chlorides, 21 crotonyl chloride, 2-hexenoyl chloride and (E)-2-methylbut-2-enoyl chloride. The physical and spectral data of 2-acetyl-3-acylaminobenzo[b]furans (9) were listed in Table S1 , see Supplementary data. To a VM reagent prepared from POCl 3 with dry N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF) at 6°C was added 2-acetyl-5-bromo-(E)-3-cinnamoylaminobenzo[b]furan (9d). The reaction mixture was stirred at 25°C for 30 h, and an orange precipitate was deposited. Purification of the orange precipitate (presumed to be the immonium salt) 1 was difficult because of its chemical instability. An orange suspension of this precipitation in water was treated with 10% NaOH aqueous solution with vigorous stirring, and an orange powder was obtained (Method A). The orange powder could also be obtained by treating the orange suspension with triethylamine (Method B). Recrystallization of each orange powder from CHCl 3 -ethyl acetate (5:1) gave orange needles (representative 5a, mp 213-216°C, 46% (Method B)) (Scheme 3). 1 H NMR (HMBC, HMQC), MS and elemental analysis data of 5a supported cyclization of oxazine ring fused at the 2-and 3-position of the benzo[b]furan ring. Compound 5a was presumed to be a novel (E or Z)-(8bromo-(E)-2-styrylbenzo[b]furo[3,2-d][1,3]oxazin-4-ylidene)acetaldehyde with a characteristic exo-formylmethylene group on the oxazine ring. These data were, however, insufficient to confirm the structure of 5a. Attempts to prepare single crystals of 5a for X-ray analysis were unsuccessful. Thus, 5a was treated with diethyl 2-(diethylamino)-2-oxoethylphosphonate (11a) under Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) reaction conditions to afford a butadiene derivative (12a) of which single crystals were successfully prepared. X-ray analysis of 12a demonstrated it to be (Z)-4- Fig. 1 ). 1 Consequently, a novel oxazine compound 5a was determined to be (Z)- on the basis of physical data of 5a and X-ray analysis of 12a. The reaction of 9d with VM reagent gave a mixture of (Z)-5a and (E)-5a in a ratio of (Z)-5a:(E)-5a = 98:2 (by 1 H NMR). Both the oxazine ring closure mechanism to 5 from 9 and the reason for predominant production of the Z-isomer (5) were discussed in the preliminary communication. 1  3]oxazin-4-ylidene}acetaldehydes (5b-l) under the same reaction conditions. The Z-isomer was preferentially produced in all of these reactions. Five predominant Z-isomers ((Z)-5d, 5e, 5i, 5k, 5l) were isolated. Results and the physical data of 5e-l were listed in Table S2 , see Supplementary data. The ring closure reaction of 2-acetyl-(E)-3-aralkenylcarbonylaminobenzo[b]furans (9) with VM reagent generated two different fused-rings, that is, the oxazine ring of 5 and the pyridine ring of 10, depending on the functional group at the 3-position. The 2-acetyl group of 9 is indispensable for these ring closure reactions, 22 Isomerization of the Z-isomers ((Z)-5) to corresponding the Eisomer occurred in their solution. The (Z)-isomer ((Z)-5a) in DMSO-d 6 solution isomerized to (E)-5a in a time-dependent manner reaching a constant ratio of (Z)-5a:(E)-5a = 5:2 after 48 h according to 1 H NMR analysis. The isomerization of two mixtures, A ((Z)-5a:(E)-5a = 92:8) and B ((Z)-5a:(E)-5a = 62:38), was also examined in toluene solution and found to reach a constant equilibrium at the ratio of (Z)-5a:(E)-5a = 5:2 after 15 h by HPLC analysis (Fig. 2 ). 23 These results suggested that (Z)-5a would be more thermodynamically stable than (E)-5a. The heat of formation of (Z)-5a was calculated to be 0.5 kcal/mol lower than that of (E)-5a. 1 The isomerization between (Z)-5a and (E)-5a would be caused by the formyl group which conjugated with the exo-methylene. This was supported by the absence of isomerization of (Z)-2- ((Z)-13a and (Z)-13b) prepared by NaBH 4 reduction of the respective (Z)-5a and (Z)-5c. We prepared thirty derivatives using the exo-formylmethylene group of 5 by Method C (NaH) and Method D (TiCl 4 ), as shown in Scheme 4. The compounds (5) were reacted with 11 phosphonate reagents (11) 24 in the presence of NaH under HWE reaction condi- POCl 3 -DMF Selected HMBC data of (Z )-5a X-ray analysis and structure of 12a tions to afford the corresponding butadiene derivatives (12) (Method C). The reactions of (Z)-5a with N-substituted dialkyl 2amino-2-oxoethylphosphonates (11a-d) gave the corresponding were reacted with (Z)-5a to afford the corresponding (Z) . Reactions of (Z)-5a with diethyl cyanomethylphosphonate (11h) and tetraethyl methylenediphosphonate (11i) gave the butadiene derivatives (12h and 12i), respectively. Only a NOE correlation between H a and H c was observed among the three olefinic H of 12a-i (Scheme 4). This suggested that the carbon-carbon double bond introduced by the HWE reaction has an E-form and the two carbon-carbon double bonds of the butadiene moiety are oriented with the s-trans conformation. This result was compatible with the structure of 12a identified by X-ray analysis (Fig. 1 ). Physical and spectral data of the butadiene derivatives (12) were listed in Table S3 , see Supplementary data. An aldehyde (Z)-5c was treated with 11b, 11e, 11f, 11g, 11h, 11i and 11k to afford the butadiene compounds 12p, 12q, 12r, 12s, 12t, 12u and 12v, respectively. Reaction of (Z,E)-5g with 11f and reaction of (Z)-5i with 11i gave 12w and 12x, respectively. Reaction of (Z)-5a with diethyl-4-chlorobenzylphosphonate (11j) afforded the unexpected phosphonate 12j which appeared likely to have been formed by dehydration instead of dephosphonation, similar to the Knoevenagel condensation mechanism. The terminal carbon-carbon double bond of 12j has the E-form because of the observation of only NOE between H a and the hydrogen of the phenyl ring (Scheme 4). Because we expected enhancement of the binding to bone hydroxyapatite, the phosphonate group was introduced to the molecule of 12. An aldehyde (Z)-5a was reacted with 11b, 11f, 11h, 11i in the presence of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl 4 ) and N-methylmorpholine (Method D) to produce the corresponding butadiene derivatives (12k-n) bearing a phosphonate group Ratio of (Z )-5a : (E )-5a Isomeric mixture comp.  12a-12j, 12n-12x, 12a c 11a R 1 = CON(C 2 H 5 ) 2 , R 2 = H, R 3 = C 2 H 5 11b R 1 = CONCH 2 CH 2 OCH 2 CH 2 , R 2 = H, R 3 = C 2 H 5 11c R 1 = CONHC 6 H 4 (3-O CH 3 ), R 2 = H, R 3 = C 2 H 5 11d R 1 = CONH(CH 2 ) 2 C 6 H 3 (3, 4-OCH 3 ), R 2 = H, R 3 = C 2 H 5 11e R 1 = COOCH 3 , R 2 = H, R 3 = CH 3 11f R 1 = COOC 2 H 5 , R 2 = H, R 3 = C 2 H 5 11g R 1 = COOC(CH 3 ) 3 , R 2 = H, R 3 = C 2 H 5 11h R 1 = CN, R 2 = H, R 3 = C 2 H 5 11i R 1 = P O(OC 2 H 5 ) 2 , R 2 = H, R 3 = C 2 H 5 11j R 1 = C 6 H 4 (4-Cl), R 2 = H, R 3 = C 2 H 5 11k R 1 = COOC 2 H 5 , R 2 = CH 3 , R 3 = C 2 H 5 12a R 1 = Br, R 2 = H, R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 =CON (C 2 H 5 ) 2 , R 5 = H 12b R 1 = Br, R 2 = H, R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 = CONCH 2 CH 2 OCH 2 CH 2 , R 5 = H 12c R 1 = Br, R 2 = H, R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 = CONHC 6 H 4 (3-OCH 3 ), R 5 = H 12d R 1 = Br, R 2 = H, R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 = CONH(CH 2 ) 2 C 6 H 3 (3, 4-OCH 3 ), R 5 = H 12e R 1 = Br, R 2 = H, R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 = COOCH 3 , R 5 = H 12f R 1 = Br, R 2 = H, R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 = COOC 2 H 5 , R 5 = H 12g R 1 = Br, R 2 = H, R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 = COOC(CH 3 ) 3 , R 5 = H 12h R 1 = Br, R 2 = H, R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 = CN, R 5 = H 12i R 1 = Br, R 2 = H, R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 = PO(OC 2 H 5 ) 2 , R 5 = H 12j R 1 = Br, R 2 = H, R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 = PO (OC 2 H 5 ) 2 , R 5 = C 6 H 4 (4-Cl) 12k R 1 = Br, R 2 = H, R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 and R 5 = PO(OC 2 H 5 ) 2 , CONCH 2 CH 2 OCH 2 CH 2 12l R 1 = Br, R 2 = H, R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 and R 5 = PO(OC 2 H 5 ) 2 , COOC 2 H 5 12m R 1 = Br, R 2 = H, R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 and R 5 = P O(OC 2 H 5 ) 2 , CN 12n R 1 = Br, R 2 = H, R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 = R 5 = PO(OC 2 H 5 ) 2 12o R 1 = Br, R 2 = H, R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 = COOC 2 H 5 , R 5 = CH 3 12p R 1 = H, R 2 = OCH 3 , R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 = CONCH 2 CH 2 OCH 2 CH 2 , R 5 = H 12q R 1 = H, R 2 = OCH 3 , R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 = COOCH 3 , R 5 = H 12r R 1 = H, R 2 = OCH 3 , R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 = COOC 2 H 5 , R 5 = H 12s R 1 = H, R 2 = OCH 3 , R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 = COOC(CH 3 ) 3 , R 5 = H 12t R 1 = H, R 2 = OCH 3 , R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 = CN, R 5 = H 12u R 1 = H, R 2 = OCH 3 , R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 = P O(OC 2 H 5 ) 2 , R 5 = H 12v R 1 = H, R 2 = OCH 3 , R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 = COOC 2 H 5 , R 5 = CH 3 12w R 1 = Br, R 2 = H, R 3 = CH=CClC 6 H 4 (4-Cl), R 4 = COOC 2 H 5 , R 5 = H 12x R 1 = Br, R 2 = H, R 3 = CH=CHC 6 H 5 , R 4 = PO( OC 2 H 5 ) 2 , R 5 = H 12y R 1 = H, R 2 = OCH 3 , R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 and R 5 = PO(OC 2 H 5 ) 2 , CONCH 2 CH 2 OCH 2 CH 2 12z R 1 = H, R 2 = OCH 3 , R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 and R 5 = P O(OCH 3 ) 2 , COOCH 3 12a a R 1 = H, R 2 = OCH 3 , R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 and R 5 = PO(OC 2 H 5 ) 2 , COOC 2 H 5 12a b R 1 = H, R 2 = OCH 3 , R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 and R 5 = PO (OC 2 H 5 ) 2 , CN 12a c R 1 = H, R 2 = OCH 3 , R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 = R 5 = PO(OC 2 H 5 ) 2 12a d R 1 = Br, R 2 = H, R 3 = C 6 H 5 , R 4 and R 5 = PO( OC 2 H 5 ) 2 at the terminal carbon. 25 An aldehyde (Z)-5c was also reacted with 11b, 11e, 11f, 11h and 11i to afford the butadiene derivatives 12y, 12z, 12aa, 12ab, 12ac, respectively, under the conditions of Method D. Tetraethyl methylenediphosphonate (11i) produced diphosphonate compounds 12n and 12ac slowly by reaction with 5a and 5c, respectively, while the reaction of ethyl diethylphosphonoacetate 11f with 5a and 5c proceeded smoothly to give monophosphonate 12l and 12aa, respectively. These reactions might proceed via a cyclic titanium complex. 25e 4H-3,1-Benzoxazines showed various kinds of physiology activity. 2-8 Therefore we performed two kinds of small scale bioactive assays to find novel bioactivity for compounds prepared here. First, we evaluated the anti-osteoclastic bone resorption in vitro of seven representative compounds ((Z)-5a, (Z)-5l, 12a, 12b, 12d, 12f, 12j) prepared in this work. By coculture of fresh bone marrow preosteoclasts expressing the receptor activator of NF-jB (RANK) with calvarial osteoblasts that express the ligand for RANK (RANKL), bone resorbing osteoclasts developed and formed resorption pits on a dentin slice. PGE 2 stimulated pit formation, and estrogens (e.g., estrogen 2 (E 2 )) inhibited PGE 2 -stimulated pit formation by suppressing the RANKL effect. 26 Among the compounds tested, the ethyl ester 12f and phosphonate 12j showed potent inhibition comparable to E 2 , whereas the amide (12a, 12b, 12d) and exo-formylmethylene compounds ((Z)-5a, (Z)-5l) were inactive (Fig. 3) . 27 The butadiene moiety with an ester or a phosphonate functional group might play an important role in inhibiting osteoclasts. Several estrogenic agents such as 2-methoxyestradiol and E 2 were reported their growth inhibitory activity against human pancreatic carcinoma (MIA PaCa-2) and breast cancer (MCF-7). 28 Therefore, the aldehyde 5f and butadiene derivatives 12p and 12w were selected as representative compounds and evaluated growth inhibitory activity in vivo against MIA PaCa-2 and MCF-7, and the results are shown in Table 1 . 29 The butadiene amide (12p) inhibited MIA PaCa-2 more than 5-FU. The exo-formylmethylene compound ((Z)-5f) showed more inhibitory activity against MCF-7 than 5-FU. The butadiene ester (12w) was inactive against both types of cancer cells. Thus, two series of selective MIA Paca-2 inhibitory new compounds were found, and examinations of their inhibition mechanism of these compounds is preparing. In conclusion, we established a new oxazine ring formation method using the reaction of 2-acetyl-3-(2-aralkenylcarbonylamino)benzo[b]furans with VM reagent. This led to a novel application of the Vilsmeier reaction for heterocyclization. (E and Z-(8-bromo- [1, 3] oxazin-4-ylidene)acetaldehydes (5) bearing the characteristic exo-formylmethylene group at the 4-position were prepared by this reaction. 30 Unsaturated aldehydes (Z)-5 were reacted with several phosphonate reagents under two reaction conditions to afford the butadiene derivatives (12) having an ester or phosphonate or amide group on the terminal carbon in the butadiene moiety. The butadiene ester and phosphonate compound (12f, 12j) showed potent anti-osteoclastic bone resorption activity comparable to E 2 (17b-estradiol), and the evaluation of these activities of most of all prepared compounds is under way. These results including detail mechanism of biological activities will be reported elsewhere in due course. The exoformylmethylene compound (Z)-5f and the butadiene amide 12p inhibited cell growth of MIA PaCa-2 and MCF-7, respectively. In vivo studies for two kinds of biological activities are in progress, aimed at developing new drugs for osteoporosis and pancreatic cancer.
