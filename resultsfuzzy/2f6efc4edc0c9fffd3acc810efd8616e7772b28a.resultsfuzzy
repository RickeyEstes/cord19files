Here, we took advantage of the recent publication of the structures of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in its pre-fusion state (doi.org/10.1126/science.abb2507) and of known structure of the SARS-CoV spike protein to comparatively apply our interaction epitope prediction method MLCE. The application of MLCE to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD, aa 319-591) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (pdb code 6vsb; doi: 10.2210/pdb6vsb/pdb) 15 and of the SARS-CoV spike protein (pdb code 5x58; doi: 10.2210/pdb5X58/pdb) ( Figure 1 ) shows that the two protein regions that contain potential interaction regions/Ab-binding epitopes share the same topological localization at the two opposite ends of the 3D structures ( Figure 1 ). However, this trait appears to be the only common one. The linear sequences that correspond to the predicted interacting epitope regions are reported in Table 1 . Importantly, the predicted epitopes for SARS-CoV spike RBD show a good degree of overlap with the epitopes mapped for neutralizing Ab 80R 16 , S230 17 and m396 18 , providing a relevant validation of our approach. However, in spite of the high degree of structural similarity between the two spike proteins, these mAbs failed to bind SARS-CoV-2 RBD, probably due to the low degree of sequence conservation in the regions contacted by these antibodies. The fact that most of the SARS-CoVdirected mAbs are not reactive against the novel betacoronavirus once more highlights the need to discover specific epitopes in SARS-CoV-2. Actually, except for the common topological localization, the predicted Ab-binding epitopes differ between the two proteins, both in their sequence and 3D structural organization (Table 1 , 2 and Figure 1 ). In some cases, linear sequences spanning distant segments of the primary structure come together in the three-dimensional structure to form extended substructures potentially (pre)organized for binding. This is particularly true for the conformational epitope at the N-and Cterminal region of SARS-CoV-2 RBD: the interacting region spans a large part of a well-defined betasheet subdomain (Table 1 , 2 and Figure 2 ). It is tempting to suggest that the expression of such subdomain in isolation could give rise to a highly immunoreactive molecule [19] [20] [21] . In SARS-CoV-2 RBD, the knowledge of substructures representing potential conformational epitopes may be helpful in guiding the development of peptide-based immunogens able to elicit antibodies that specifically target the cognate protein to which the predicted epitopes belong (Figure 2 ). Simply speaking, the termini of the linear segments making up the conformational epitopes could be aptly bridged with a number of Gly residues sufficient to approximate the distance in the experimental structure (Table 3 ). Antibodies raised against these molecules, which recapitulate the main determinants of immunoreactivity of the full protein, could have useful applications in a therapeutic setting [19] [20] [21] . Furthermore, information on potentially specific SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD-specific epitopes The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.990267 doi: bioRxiv preprint function both as antigen-mimicking baits to target virus-specific antibodies in patients' fluids, and as immunogens to generate new Abs able to detect relevant antigens [22] [23] . Importantly, after we ran our predictions on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, crystal structures of this domain in complex with the cellular receptor protein ACE2 was reported by 24 and by Yan et al. 25 . Of note, one predicted interaction region almost completely overlaps with the substructure of spike protein RDB engaged in binding with ACE2 (478 TPCNGVEGF 486). Synthetic mimicry of this sequence could aptly generate high priority candidates aimed at disrupting PPIs between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and its cell receptor ACE2. Such molecules could be used to block viral entry into cells. Similarly, our approach also predicts a patch on SARS-CoV spike RBD, which is partly involved in binding ACE2 (see 26 ). Overall, while the two RBD proteins likely evolved from a common ancestor and share a common fold, they are characterized by different sequences. The physico-chemical properties determined by such sequence differences, efficaciously unveiled by MLCE, reverberate in the modulation of the networks of intraprotein interactions that underlie the (pre)organization of regions for potential recognition of binding partners (cell receptors or antibodies). These results represent, to the best of our knowledge, one of the first molecular physical-chemistry based rationalization of the reasons why some of the tested SARS-CoV RBD monoclonal Abs do not have appreciable cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD 15 , despite the fact that the two domains were recently reported to display the same affinity for the ACE2, with KD values of 15.2 nM and 15 nM for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, respectively 27 . In this complex scenario, our predictions can help disentangle some of the issues related to betacoronavirues infectivity and immunological response.

The structures were used as input for epitope prediction using the Matrix of Local Coupling Energies method (MLCE), which combines the analysis of structural determinants of a given protein with its energetic properties [3] [4] . This approach allows to identify nonoptimized, low-intensity energetic interaction-networks, corresponding to those substructures that can be more prone to establish interactions with Antibodies, and be suitably recognized by binding partners. Briefly, the contiguous where * is the a-th eigenvalue and % * is the i-th component of the corresponding eigenvector. The eigenvector with the most negative correspondent eigenvalue contains most of the interaction information for the stabilizing interaction of the system.
