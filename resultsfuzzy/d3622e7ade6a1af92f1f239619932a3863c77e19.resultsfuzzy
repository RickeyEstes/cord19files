In an adequate acute immune response, IL-10 presence should not affect virus clearance; however sustained expression during immune priming or secondary responses can favor persistence or chronic infections. This fine balance between the inflammatory response crucial to virus clearance and the IL-10-mediated immune regulation necessary for T cell homeostasis and host tissue protection can be subverted by viruses to allow replication and spreading. 


Section:il-10's supportive role for effective virus clearance is very apparent in cns infections. virus-induced encephalitis results from an excessive immune-induced inflammation designed to control viral infection. il-10-deficiency aggravates this immunopathology in flavivirus or coronavirus infections with cns tropism
