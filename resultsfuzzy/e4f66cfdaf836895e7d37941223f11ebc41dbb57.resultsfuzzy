To develop PLANT-Dx, we first sought to create pathogen detecting molecular sensors based upon the Small Transcription Activating RNA (STAR) regulatory system (11) . This transcription activation system is based upon conditional formation of a terminator hairpin located within a target RNA upstream of a gene to be regulated: alone, the terminator hairpin forms and halts transcription of the downstream gene, while in the presence of a specific transacting STAR the hairpin cannot form and transcription proceeds (SI Figure 2) . Previous work showed that the STAR linear binding region can be changed to produce highly functional and orthogonal variants (15) . Here we sought to utilize this by replacing the linear binding region with sequences derived from genomic pathogen DNA to create new viral sensors. To do this, we utilized the secondary structure prediction algorithm NUPACK to identify regions within the genomes of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and potato virus (PVY), that are predicted computationally to be unstructured for target RNA design (Supplementary Note 1) (16) . Once viral STARs were designed, reporter DNA constructs were then created in which these target RNA sequences were placed downstream of a constitutive T7 promoter and upstream of the CDO reporter gene. We next designed RPA primer sets to amplify and transform a pathogen's genomic material into a DNA construct capable of synthesizing a functional STAR. Specifically, a T7 promoter and anti-terminator STAR sequence were added to the 5' end of a reverse RPA primer, which when combined with a forward primer, amplified a 40 nt viral sequence to produce a double-stranded DNA encoding the designed STAR which contained the target viral .

In this way, we anticipated that combining the CDO-encoding reporter construct and RPA amplified DNA into a cell-free gene expression reaction (12 , 17) would lead to the production of a detectable colorimetric output signal. We began by investigating the ability of PLANT-Dx to detect the presence of in vitro transcribed (IVT) RNA designed to mimic specific target regions of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). We observed rapid color accumulation in samples containing 1 nM of purified transcription product versus the no-RNA negative control (Figure 1B) . To test for modularity, we further developed sensors and primer sets for the detection of potato virus Y (PVY), and confirmed function with the same assay ( Figure 1C) . The specificity of our system was also tested by interrogating the crosstalk between the product of various RPA reactions and noncognate molecular sensors. Specifically, we tested color production from cell-free reactions containing the reporter DNA construct for CMV with the PVY IVT-derived RPA product, as well as the converse, and found color production only between cognate pairs of input RPA and reporter constructs ( Figure 1D) . We next interrogated the inherent limit of detection of our system through titration of input IVT products ( Figure 1E ). This demonstrated our ability to detect the presence of target nucleic acid sequences down to the picomolar range. Surprisingly, this sensitivity is lower than that previously reported for RPA (3) and is most likely due to loss in amplification efficiency from the addition of the long overhangs present within our primer sets. We next set out to determine whether this methodology was able to differentiate between plant lysate obtained from healthy plants versus lysate infected with CMV virus. To test this, we input 1 uL of CMV-infected plant lysate, or an equivalent volume of a non-infected plant lysate control, into the PLANT-Dx reaction system. Here, we observed rapid color change only from reactions with infected lysate when compared to healthy lysate (Figure 2A) . To demonstrate that this assay can be monitored by eye, reactions were carried out and filmed within a 31áµ’C incubator ( Figure 2B) . With the naked eye, we detected accumulation of a yellow color only within reactions that were incubated with infected lysate, while no such production was witnessed in reactions with uninfected lysate. A notable drawback of current gold standard diagnostics is the need for peripheral equipment for either amplification or visualization of outputs. Even simple heating elements for controlled incubations are a major hindrance during deployment within the field and can be costprohibitive. We sought to exploit the flexible temperature requirements of both RPA and cell free gene expression reactions by attempting to run our diagnostic reactions for CMV infected lysate using only body heat. This resulted in clear yellow color only in the presence of infected lysate, with no major difference observed between these reactions and those previously incubated within a thermocycler and plate reader (Figure 2C ).
