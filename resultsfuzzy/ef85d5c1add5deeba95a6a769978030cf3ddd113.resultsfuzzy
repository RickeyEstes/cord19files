The surface pressure (π)-molecular area (A) and surface potential (ΔV)-A isotherms of representative PSM, DOPC, and CHOL were measured on 0.02 M Tris buffer with 0.13 M NaCl (pH 7.4) at 298.2 K (Fig. 2) . The π-A isotherm of PSM shows a phase transition pressure (π eq ) of~21 mN m −1 (solid arrow), at which the monolayer phase starts changing from a liquid-expanded (LE) to liquid-condensed (LC). The extrapolated area, which is the molecular area of the ordered-state part on the π-A isotherm at π=0, of PSM is~0.48 nm 2 . DOPC forms a typical expanded monolayer with an extrapolated area of~0.79 nm 2 . In contrast, CHOL forms a typical condensed monolayer (liquid or solid state, see Fig. S2 in Supplementary material) with a limiting molecular area of 0.38 nm 2 , which is in good agreement with the cross-sectional area of CHOL molecules computed on the basis of average tilt angle [53] . Values of π eq , phase collapse pressure (π c ), and its corresponding collapse area (A c ) of PSM, DOPC, and CHOL are shown in Table 1 . The surface potential (ΔV) generally reflects orientational and conformational changes of monolayers upon compression. The ΔV values of all monolayers vary positively upon compression, which means that the molecular orientation in a monolayer is improved in the direction normal to the surface plane [54] . When the PSM, DOPC, and CHOL monolayers are compressed up to the close-packed state, their ΔV values reach~354,~418, and~401 mV, respectively. These results are in good agreement with those of previous studies [55] [56] [57] . In case of PSM, the slope of ΔV-A isotherm changes at 0.51 nm 2 (indicated by an arrow), which corresponds to the LE/LC phase transition. This result suggests that molecular orientation of PSM is abruptly improved when the phase is changed from the LE to LC state. In situ morphological observations for a one-component monolayer at the air/water interface were carried out by BAM and FM. BAM images of DOPC and CHOL monolayers show a homogeneous LE phase (dark contrast) and an LC phase (bright contrast), respectively (see Fig. S3 (B), (C) in Supplementary material). As for PSM, the phase transition (π eq =~21 mN m −1 ) from the LE to LC phase is observed when transition is judged from the dark-bright contrast (Fig. S3(A) in Supplementary material). In order to further investigate interfacial behaviors of one-component monolayers, FM possessing greater resolution and magnification was then performed, even though the doping probe was in the sample. Fig. 3 shows fluorescence images of PSM monolayers on 0.02 M Tris buffer (0.13 M NaCl, pH 7.4) at 298.2 K. Fluorescent probes (here, NBD-PC) dissolve selectively into the LE phase in the monolayer state. Therefore, in contrary to bright and dark regions in BAM images, those in FM images correspond to LE and LC phases, respectively. Below π eq =~21 mN m −1 , FM images are homogeneously bright. However, the nucleation of LC domains is apparent at the transition point, and further compression leads to growth of LC domains in starburst-like shapes up to 25 mN m −1 . Above 30 mN m −1 , edges of LC domains become unclear. The size of LC domains in PSM remains constant, even though LC domains of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine (DPPC) grow by lateral compression [58] . It is considerable that the degree of hydration around the head group of PSM, which possesses amine and hydroxyl groups, is stronger than that of DPPC, which reflects growth of LC domains by lateral compression.
