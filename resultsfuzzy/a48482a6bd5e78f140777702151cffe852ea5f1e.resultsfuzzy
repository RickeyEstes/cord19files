Codon usage bias in genes is an important evolutionary parameter and has been increasingly documented in a wide range of organisms from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Two theories-neutral evolution and natural selection-have been used to explain the origin of codon usage bias [3, 28, 29] . If a synonymous mutation occurs at the third codon position, it should result in a random codon choice, with GC and AT being substituted proportionally among the degenerate codons in a gene [30, 31] . In contrast, if translational selection pressure influences codon usage, the bias should be significantly positively correlated with expression levels, with some translation-preferred codons appearing more frequently than others. Previous studies have demonstrated that genes within a species often share similar codon usage patterns, though a few species, such as Bacillus subtilis, appear to refute this [32] .
