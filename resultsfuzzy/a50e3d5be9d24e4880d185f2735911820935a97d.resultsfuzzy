The results of the two simulation studies are presented in Table 5 . In simulation study I, the fixed effect ˇ and the variance of random herd effect 2 0 were estimated well with relative biases not exceeding 2%. Further, the "model-based standard errors" (posterior sd) of ˇ was on average very close to its empirical standard deviation, and the probability converges of ˇ and 2 0 were somewhat over the nominal. For 2 1 , and 2 2 , the average posterior medians were very close to the true values, but the average posterior means were larger than the true values, with substantial relative biases of 48% and 35%, respectively. The 2 1 estimate showed strongly CI over-coverage, whereas the estimate of 2 2 had CI under-coverage. The mean squared errors were similar to the posterior-mean and posterior-median estimates of the ˇ and 2 0 , and smaller mean squared error for the posterior-median estimates of the 2 1 and 2 2 than for the posterior-mean estimates. In simulation study II, the ˇ, 2 0 and 2 1 were estimated very well based on both the posterior means and posterior medians with relative biases of at most 1.1%, 3.4% and 4%. For 2 2 , estimation based on the posterior medians performed better than for posterior means. The CI converges of all model estimates were good except for 2 1 where CI under-coverage was observed.
