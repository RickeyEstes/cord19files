Infectivity titers of bacteriophage T2 were reduced by OJ and GJ to 25-35% of the control (Po0.05). CJ, however, reduced bacteriophage T2 infectivity titers at T 0 to undetectable levels (Fig. 1a) . Similar results were obtained for bacteriophage T4, wherein CJ reduced viral titers by more than 1 log 10 (i.e., 92% of control). OJ and GJ affected a bacteriophage T4 reduction in titer by ca. 20% (Fig. 1b) . Due to the rapidity of these reactions, the marked antiviral effect imparted to bacteriophages T2 and T4 by CJ is suggested to have occurred at an early stage in the virus replication cycle. Based on the similar inactivation patterns identified between the bacterial virus species tested, extended studies were performed using the bacteriophage T4. Incubation at 4 and 23 1C for 60 min of CJ-treated bacteriophage T4 affected a reduction of infectivity titers to undetectable levels. Under identical assay conditions, no significant differences in titer yield occurred among the bacteriophage T4 controls following inoculation at 4 or 23 1C (P Â¼ 0:39; Table 1 ). Variations in temperature are recognized to exert an effect on virus loss of infectivity, with increased temperature associated with increased rate of virus ''kill.'' However, temperature-induced inactivation rates may differ between viruses (Babich and Stotzky, 1980; Feng et al., 2003) . In the current study, temperatures of 4 and 23 1C had no effect on control titer yields. These data not only denote the relative stability of the bacteriophage T4 at 23 1C, but further indicate the significant antiviral effect mediated by CJ. Infectivity titers of the bacteriophage T4 were undetectable 30 min after virus inoculation when treated with CJ concentrations of 10%, 30%, or 50%. CJ concentrations o0.01% CJ displayed no antivirus activity (Fig. 2) .
