Benefitting from the clinical diagnosis, the authors were able to narrow the range of the laboratory examinations, and, based on the positive result, the subsequent isolation and identification methods focused on FHV-1. The glycoprotein B (gB) gene and thymidine kinase (TK) gene have been selected for the study of molecular phylogeny [7, 8] . A 253 bp sequence was obtained, and alignment analysis determined that the TK gene cloned in this study shared a high identity (from 99% to 100%) with that of other FHV-1 isolates (Figure 1) . A 566 bp fragment of the gB (glycoprotein B) gene was also cloned, and was found to share 100% identity with that of other FHV-1 isolates. Therefore, its phylogenetic tree was omitted here. The two sequences have been deposited in Genbank whose accession numbers are ** and **, for TK gene and gB gene fragment separately. The phylogenetic tree based on the TK gene sequences showed that the isolate investigated in this study, was closely related to the ten isolates of FHV-1 ( Figure 2 ), a result consistent with the alignment analysis. All isolates of FeHV-1 appear to be relatively similar, as they antigenically belong to one serotype [9] . The TK gene is a conserved gene, and the target fragment is located in its highly conserved region. Therefore, the above results are strong evidence for the presence of FHV-1.
