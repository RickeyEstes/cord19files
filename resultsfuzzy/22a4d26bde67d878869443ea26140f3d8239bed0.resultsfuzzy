Lifespan Following Infection 279 Infected lifespan varied significantly between males and females and the extent of 280 this variation differed between host genetic backgrounds ( Figure 1a ; Table 1) . 281 Genetic background explained the most variance of any predictor across models 282 assessing mating (7%) and sex (10.9%). Interactions with sex and mating also 283 explained a further 2.7% and 1.5%, respectively ( Figure 5 ; Table 1 ). We found no 284 evidence that mating affected the lifespan of females following DCV infection ( Figure  285 1a; Table 1 ). Viral load at death (VLAD) was not affected by genetic background, sex 286 or female mating status ( Figure 1b ; Table 2 ), and flies that died sooner following 287 infection had greater VLAD than those that died later ( Figure 1c ; Table 1) .
