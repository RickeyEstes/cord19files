During the study period for this analysis (1 January 2005 to 31 March 2006), 8239 respiratory specimens from individual patients and respiratory outbreaks were tested using the universal probe designed to detect lineages A and B of hMPV as described in Section 2. Analysis of the data shows that 778 specimens were positive for hMPV giving an overall positive rate of 9.4% during this period. The C t values for positive samples ranged from 18.3 to 44.9 representing a wide distribution in viral load, the mean C t value was 30.2 with a standard deviation of ±2.74. Specimen types for the 778 positive samples were diverse and included 697 upper respiratory specimens (89.6% of all positive specimens) and 81 lower respiratory specimens (10.4% of all positive specimens) as shown in Table 1 . Age-specific data was available for 8213 samples. The positive patients ranged in age from 18 days to 99 years with the majority of positive specimens from patients less than 6 years as shown in Fig. 2 . A total of 1566 (19%) and 856 (10%) of the samples tested were from patients <12 months and 12-24 months of age, respectively. The positive rate for hMPV was significantly higher in the younger age groups as compared to those >24 months of age (χ 2 , p < 0.001).
