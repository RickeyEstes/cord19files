As the unwieldy algebraic expressions in Eqs. (13)-(15) render further analytical analysis impractical, we adopt numerical simulations in order to investigate how well our model performs in simulating the situation of an economy on the cusp of industrialisation subjected to a large mortality shock and ensuing unprecedented emigration flows. In the Lagerlöf (2003a,b) model, the timing of industrialisation is an outcome of the stochastic set of exogenous mortality shocks. In order to perform our modelling exercise, we make the model deterministic through simulating the model with one set of mortality shocks ω Rt . In this way, the time scale can be set so that the baseline economy industrialises in a given time period, as in Lagerlöf (2003b) , where a similar technique is used to extract the difference in timing of the industrial revolution between England, France and Sweden. As discussed in Section 2, we characterise Ireland as being on the cusp of industrialisation prior to the famine. Thus set the baseline economy to industrialise within the period 1825-1850. 26 Having chosen the parameters as outlined above, we now consider the extent to which an exogenous mortality shock occurring at a point where a country is on the cusp of industrialisation impacts upon this process of industrialisation. To facilitate this, we begin by simulating our benchmark model which represents Irish long run economic and demographic growth, where we assume that Irish economic and demographic development would have followed a similar path towards industrialisation as did England, France and Sweden, and identify the point at which industrialisation is triggered by the modelling set-up (i.e. h N 0). We deem this switch to industrialisation to represent the period just prior to 1850-that is, we define the date of industrialisation as the first period when h t N 0. In the period starting in year 1850, we apply the exogenous mortality shock to our benchmark model, i.e. t F =1850. This shock represents the occurrence of the 1845-1852 famine. This initial case is then used as a benchmark against which the impact of the famine on Irish development can be compared. We also consider the hypothetical situation for a more severe mortality shock than that experienced in Ireland over the 1845-1852 period. This allows us to hypothesise about the impact of a more severe mortality shock on the Irish industrialisation process, when that shock occurs on the cusp of Irish industrialisation. For this case, we choose ω F = 0.041, which means that in this harsher famine case only 50% of the Irish pre-famine population level remains after the famine. 30 In all, we simulate three distinct cases: (i) our benchmark model, which represents the Irish development path towards industrialisation in the absence of the famine mortality shock, (ii) a "famine scenario", where a mortality shock proportionate to that actually experienced in Ireland over the 1845-1852 period is modelled, and (iii) a "severe famine scenario", where we hypothesise a mortality shock far more severe than that actually experienced in Ireland. Figs. 4 and 5 present the results for the important variables of our model (population, GDP per capita, emigration, and education time) over the 1700-2300 period, with each graph presenting the three simulated scenarios together for ease of comparison. In order to provide a meaningful interpretation of the simulations presented in Figs. 4 and 5, we must be clear on what these simulations can and cannot explain. The insights that can be gleaned from these simulations concern (i) the occurrence or otherwise of industrialisation, in terms of a take-off in population and GDP per capita, due to a sufficiently mild set of mortality shocks, (ii) the occurrence or otherwise of such an industrialisation when the country under consideration (Ireland, in this case) is stricken with a significant exogenous mortality shock (such as that arising from the Irish famine) above and beyond the mild "run-of-the-mill" mortality shocks when that country is on the cusp of its industrialisation process, (iii) if industrialisation does occur in the aftermath of this exogenous mortality shock, to what extent is this economic and demographic take-off delayed, and (iv) if, in the Irish case, the exogenous mortality shock arising from the famine of 1845-1852 had been significantly larger than that actually experienced, would the outcome in terms of the occurrence and timing of industrialisation have been significantly altered? Among the issues not addressed by our simulations are the following: exact measurement of population, emigration or GDP per capita in levelswe use initial values and scaling factors that ensure that the variables are within a reasonable order of magnitude to depict the long run development of the Irish economy; forecasting of future levels of Irish population or GDP per capita; and the synergies and interactions that may occur once GDP per capita taken off, arising from factors such as international trade, foreign direct investment, structural change and so on. 31 In short, the focus of our simulations based on a simple, stylised model is the occurrence and timing of industrialisation. Regarding the occurrence of Irish industrialisation, over time our benchmark model does industrialise (as illustrated by the take-off in population and GDP per capita in Fig. 4 ) as a sufficiently mild set of mortality shocks leads to lower mortality and rising population growth which through the scale effect on human capital production raises human capital productivity and brings about a quality-quantity switch at the point in time where education time (that adults dedicate to their children) becomes operative (i.e. h N 0). This, of course, is exactly what the Lagerlöf (2003a,b ) is designed to achieve. As outlined above, the period in which our benchmark model industrialises is then set to 1825 i.e. h t N 0. What is of particular interest to us, of course, is what happens to industrialisation, and the population and GDP per capita take-off, when an exogenous mortality shock such as that which struck Ireland in 1845-1852 occurs on the cusp of the industrialisation process. As 30 Note that we set D t = D = 1 and F(C t − 1 ) = F = 1 in the calibration of ω F . Fig. 4 . Population levels (left) and levels of GDP per capita (right), 1700-2300. Notes: the solid line corresponds to the benchmark case, the dashed line corresponds to the "famine scenario", and the crossed line corresponds to the "severe famine". The vertical axis of the GDP per capita graph is given in 1990 US$, as per Lagerlöf (2003b) . 31 It should be noted that this model represents one means of explaining industrialisation and long-run growth. As such, it yields insights into simplified feedback effects between a set of key variables. illustrated by our "famine scenario" in Figs. 4 and 5, industrialisation in terms of h t is preserved during the famine periodthat is, h t N 0 in 1825 and the famine shock is not severe enough to cause the Irish economy to de-industrialize in terms of this variableand a definitive take-off does still occur but is delayed by about 75 years. The post famine population level appears to revert back to its Malthusian level within 50 years, but a definitive take-off does not occur until about 1950. One can compare these results to what has been observed in the Irish demographic trends discussed in Section 2: after the initial mortality shock the Irish population continued its decline well after 1890, falling a further 5% between 1891 and 1926 and then remaining relatively stable until the 1960 s, when it eventually began to pick up. Our model results predict a relatively swift recovery to the average Malthusian level of population. Since our model only takes into account the direct effects that the famine had on demographics, through mortality and emigration, and not the impact of the famine on fertility and nutrition, the simulated population level may be somewhat overestimated. That said, our simulation results are broadly in line with those demographic trends observed in Ireland: a substantial fall in the level of population after the famine, a recovery to the average pre-famine level and then a definitive take-off in the midtwentieth century. Our "famine scenario" GDP per capita also broadly resembles the empirics of Section 2 in that a clear take-off in Irish GDP per capita occurs post 1960. This suggests that the impact of the famine delays the GDP take-off associated with industrialisation by approximately 75 years. This "famine scenario" simulation also captures the strong post-famine economic performance experienced by Ireland over the 1860-1913 period, as discussed in Section 2. But what facilitates the recovery and subsequent demographic and economic take-off, and what determines how quickly or slowly this process occurs? We have augmented the original Lagerlöf (2003a,b) to allow two channels through which the post-famine economy can recover: (i) labour productivity and (ii) human capital accumulation. In our modelling set-up, we aim to incorporate empirically observed labour productivity trends and this is achieved in our simplified labour productivity specification by using emigration flows in order to endogenize labour productivity trends. This allows us to capture in our simulations the findings of Geary and Stark (2002) , whose results indicate that the strong Irish post-famine economic performance partly was driven by labour productivity growth, arising from labour market outflows and TFP growth. While labour productivity may have contributed significantly to the post-famine economic performance, our modelling set-up also affords human capital accumulation a prominent role. In the Lagerlöf (2003a,b) model, industrialisation is measured by the variable h t , which is the time that parents spend educating their children. In our model, we augment this in Eq. (10) by assuming that GDP per capita in the previous period facilitates the transfer of education infrastructure into the next period which is inherited by the next generation of adults and used in the education of their children. Through this mechanism we assume that this period's GDP per capita contributes to the accumulation of next period's human capital. If a large mortality shock was to occur in the original Lagerlöf (2003a,b) model, the resulting impact on human capital would be entirely negative: due to the fall in population density associated with large scale mortality, knowledge transfer is hampered (through Eq. (9) above) and human capital production, H in Eq. (8), declines. Our set-up, however, mitigates this fall in human capital production: due to the gain in GDP per capita brought about by rising labour productivity, post-famine human capital accumulation gets a "push" which prevents the famine mortality shock from causing de-industrialisation (i.e . h t becoming nonoperative). In this way, as the post-famine economy experiences a sudden increase in GDP per capitabe it from efficiency gains from increased emigration or through TFP gains, this raises the standards of living and helps to rebuild the level of human capital in the aftermath of the famine. This human capital recovering process turns out to have a decisive impact on the process of industrialisation, in that the economy remains industrialised (in terms of h t ) in the aftermath of the famine mortality shock. This retention of the ability to produce human capital may provide an explanation as to why the recovery appears to occur relatively swiftly: the economy remains in an industrialised state despite the onslaught of the famine mortality shock and once the level of population returns back to the Malthusian state, h t can continue to drive the demographic and economic take-off which had been delayed by the famine. 32 This characterization of human capital is in line with the findings of Crayen and Baten (2009), who report a small deterioration in Irish numeracy (a proxy for human capital) directly after the famine, with convergence back to pre-famine levels occurring around 1870. After 1870 a take-off in 32 Simulation analysis of the interaction between factors in the model that may be responsible for the transition to the Modern growth regime has also been undertaken. These factors are (i) a series of soft mortality shocks, (ii) the dynamic labour productivity specification captured through the variable D t and (iii) the scale-effect that allows GDP per capita to increase human capital production, F(C t − 1 ). Our results show that the increase in labour productivity that occurred after the famine, in conjunction with the resulting increase in GDP per capita and its impact on human capital transfer, played a determining role in post-famine industrialisation( in terms of h t ) and thereby speeded up the postfamine recovery. Results are available from the authors on request. Irish numeracy is observed and convergence to numeracy levels of other developed North European countries is reached in the 1920s. Fig. A1 and 2 in the Appendix provide a comparison of the timing of the industrialisation "take-off" for observed Irish population and GDP per capita data and our "famine scenario" simulations. It should be emphasised that Fig. A1 and 2 do not attempt to predict the observed series in levels: the data used to calibrate the model (British population data points and parameters taken from Lagerlöf (2003a, b) ) creates gaps between the actual and simulated series. The comparison of this take-off timing illustrates the usefulness of this class of unified growth model for the modelling of large scale mortality shocks, as well as displaying features that could be further refined in future research. Indicative of the usefulness of the model is the fact that the timing of the take-off of actual and simulated GDP per capita coincides almost exactly circa 1950. The population graph (A2) identifies a number of shortcomings of the model: (i) the size of the famine shock may be impaired due to the initial population data points used to calibrate the model (ii) the simulated population series rebounds relatively quickly after the famine shock. This reflects the fact that the number of channels through which the aftermath of the famine shock can impact population is limited in our simplistic model. A host of demographic factors, for example post-famine health, nutrition or the age and gender of emigrants, are not explicitly included in the model but may have long-run consequences for postfamine population growth. Simulated population take-off occurs circa 1925, while actual population take-off was delayed until 1960. Lastly, we consider the hypothetical case where the exogenous mortality shock arising from the Irish famine of 1845-1852 is significantly larger than that actually experienced. Would the outcome in terms of the occurrence and timing of industrialisation have been significantly altered? As is clear from "severe famine" scenarios of Figs. 4 and 5, industrialisation does occur in this more severe case and population and GDP per capita do still take off. 33 However, in our simulations this industrialisation (i.e. h t becoming operative) is now delayed by 250 years compared to the benchmark "no famine" scenario, and when compared to the case in which the famine did occur, this "severe famine" scenario yields a delay of a similar length of time in the eventual take-off of GDP per capital and population levels. 34 What can one conclude from this "severe famine" case? It seems that a harsher famine at the cusp of industrialisation does indeed act as a larger deterrent to industrialisation in terms of demographic and economic growth. Perhaps the most important insight to be gleaned from this "severe famine" scenario in Figs. 4 and 5, however, is that the impact of this harsher famine could be so significant that it serves to completely de-industrialise the economy, in terms of the education time variable h t . The post-famine economy would then recover to its Malthusian level but remain stuck at this level for a protracted period of time until demographic and economic take-off eventually occurs (through the human capital accumulation mechanism of the model). Clearly, one could envisage that if, on the cusp of industrialisation, Ireland had been struck by a more prolonged famine than that caused the potato blight of which ruined the harvest of 1845, 1846, and 1848 or by a famine more deadly in terms of mortality and displacement, Ireland may not have been in a position to initiate its successful industrialisation in the 1960s.
