To examine the capacity of influenza viruses to cause severe disease following ocular inoculation, and to better identify those features specific to ocular inoculation, we inoculated ferrets by either the traditional i.n. route (using a 1 mL inoculation volume) or the i.o. route (using a 100 ml inoculation volume) with 10 6 EID 50 of NL/219, NL/230, or Brisbane virus and collected systemic tissues on day 3 p.i. (Table 3 and 4). While i.n. inoculation with the H7N7 viruses tested in this study results in high virus titers throughout the respiratory tract of ferrets, H7N7 virus dissemination following i.o. inoculation was generally restricted to the upper respiratory tract, with a .3 log reduction in titers in nasal turbinates (p,0.05) and only sporadic virus isolation in trachea and lung samples compared with intranasal inoculation (p,0.005) ( Table 3) . A similar pattern of virus dissemination following H7N7 i.o. virus infection was observed when ferrets were inoculated by the i.n. route using a 100 ml and not 1 mL inoculation volume ( Table 3 ). The H1N1 virus Brisbane replicated with comparable efficiency in nasal turbinate samples regardless of the inoculation route or volume chosen, but similar to H7N7 virus ocular infections, did not consistently replicate to high titers in lower respiratory tract tissues. Unlike virus dissemination to the respiratory tract, virus spread to the intestinal tract was not contingent on the route or volume of inoculation. Despite restriction of virus following i.o. inoculation to upper respiratory tract tissues compared with traditional 1 mL intranasal inoculation through day 3 p.i., virus introduced by the ocular route was still capable of causing lethal disease, as ferrets inoculated with the HPAI H5N1 virus Thai/16 by the ocular route required euthanasia days 7-8 p.i. due to development of neurological signs (Table 1) . Ferrets which succumbed to Thai/16 virus infection following ocular inoculation exhibited pronounced lymphopenia in peripheral blood and systemic spread of virus to all regions of the respiratory tract and brain comparable to 1 mL intranasal inoculation, albeit with reduced lethargy and a delayed time-to-death ( [32] and data not shown). These data suggest that ferrets inoculated by the ocular route succumb to a similar course of disease as intranasally inoculated ferrets, however following i.o. inoculation there is a delay in both the kinetics of virus dissemination and the development of neurological signs and severe disease, potentially owing to differences in virus inoculum reaching lower respiratory tract tissues at the time of ocular inoculation. Ocular tissue is not routinely titrated following i.n. inoculation of influenza virus in ferrets, making it difficult to elucidate if viral titers in ocular tissue are a function of i.o. inoculation or are detected regardless of the inoculation route. Therefore, we collected both left and right whole ferret eyes and all surrounding conjunctiva/eyelid for virus titration from ferrets inoculated by the intranasal or ocular route with NL/219, NL/230, or Brisbane viruses (Table 4) . Surprisingly, sporadic viral titers from both left and right eye and conjunctival tissue were detected following HPAI H7N7 virus infection by both i.n. (using either a 1 mL or 100 ml inoculation volume) or i.o. inoculation routes (Table 4) . While the magnitude of viral titers and viral RNA was generally similar between intranasal and ocular routes of inoculation, realtime RT-PCR detected CW-positive samples with a greater sensitivity compared with viral culture. Isolation of virus from ocular tissue may be a reflection of the ability of these HPAI viruses to spread to extra-pulmonary tissues post-inoculation as previously described [26] . However, virus was also detected in left and right conjunctival tissue following i.n. or i.o. inoculation of the H1N1 virus Brisbane, a virus which lacks a high capacity for systemic spread [28] . Comparable levels of viral RNA were isolated from CW samples from ferrets inoculated with Brisbane virus by either intranasal or ocular routes, although infectious virus was only detected in CW samples collected from the eyes of ferrets inoculated by the ocular route. To confirm that virus detected in the eye and conjunctiva was associated with tissue-specific virus replication, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to visualize the presence of influenza A nucleoprotein (NP) in ferret ocular tissues. As shown in Figure 3 , influenza virus antigen was detected in epithelial cells from both the lacrimal glands in the conjunctiva and the ciliary processes in the eye collected day 3 p.i. from ferrets inoculated by the ocular route. These results indicate that the route of virus inoculation in ferrets can affect the extent of virus dissemination in respiratory tract tissue, but extra-pulmonary spread, notably to ocular tissue, is present regardless of the point of entry once an infection is established.
