The work in this section contains two parts. For the isolated building scale, concerning the comprehensive performance of combined wind and buoyancy effect, part 3.1 gives the airflow streamlines and tracer gas mass fraction distribution around the building in the close window mode. Since the heated wall is on the windward side, the thermal plume generated by natural ventilation is adjacent to the windward surface. Part 3.2 firstly shows the concentration distribution along the windward wall in the open window mode. Then for the room scale, part 3.2 illustrates the mean temperature and air exchange rate (ACH) of each room. Furthermore, an evaluation index, reentry ratio, is introduced in to analyse the inter-flat transmission characteristics. So this part mainly concerns the situations within the objective building.
