PRRSV ORFs 2 -7 have been shown to code for four glycoproteins (GP2-5), the membrane protein (M) and the nucleocapsid protein (N), respectively. Sequence analysis of strains VR-2332 and RespPRRS indicated that there were 15 nucleotide changes in this region, and all but one of which resulted in amino acid alterations. There were four amino acid mutations within GP2. One amino acid change (aa10, LF) was located within the predicted signal sequence of GP2, but the nucleotide mutation (G 12102 U 12102 ) also altered amino acid 9 from an aspartic acid to a tyrosine of a putative ORF2a protein (Wu, Christopher-Hennings, and Nelson, unpublished data) . The remaining three GP2 changes (aa 122, A S; aa 128, K R; aa 130, V M) were clustered in an eight amino acid region in the middle of the protein sequence, predicted to be located on the exterior of the virion. The three amino acid Fig. 4 . Viral growth curves of PRRSV strains VR-2332 () and RespPRRS () reveal that RespPRRS has enhanced growth kinetics in vitro. Results are representative of three separate experiments. The number of plaques were determined in triplicate for two separate viral dilutions and were found to deviate by less than 5% in each individual experiment. vealed that this mutation had reverted back to a VR-2332-like sequence while maintaining all other ORF 5 and 6 mutations and the avirulent viral phenotype (data not shown). The other M protein mutation was shown to be the result of two nucleotide changes within the codon for amino acid 121, altering the sequence from an arginine to a glycine (R G). Curiously, both carboxyl terminal GP5 and M mutations resulted in a R G change.
