4.1. Pressure excursion over loading followed by cleaning Fig. 6a shows the experimental pressure excursion of a clean filter followed by loading to a maximum allowable pressure (somewhat arbitrary) followed by cleaning by backpulse and backblow as described earlier. This cyclic loading/cleaning was repeated 5 more times. The duration of the first loading cycle was quite long 5.6 h to reach the maximum set pressure limit of 850 Pa followed by backpulse and backblow which took 0.6 h and the pressure drop was restored back to 100 Pa. On the other hand, the 2nd loading cycle only took 3.2 h to be followed by a constant cleaning of 0.6 h. The 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th loading took even less time but quite consistently constant, respectively, at 2.3, 2.8, 2.1 and 1.85 h, and each loading was followed by a 0.6-h cleaning. These are all summarized in Table 1 . Fig. 6b shows only the experimental loading behavior in closer details. The behavior of the 1st loading cycle is concave upward (depth filtration with aerosols filling both the skin region and the filter interior) followed by a linear trend (cake filtration). On the other hand, the behavior of 2nd and subsequent cycles are all predominantly concave downward (later attributed to only skin loading) followed by again a linear trend (cake filtration). Note at the start of loading the pressure drop recorded is denoted as Dp o (see Fig. 5b ) and this value increases with increasing cycle, see Fig. 6a . For example, Dp o is 22 Pa for a clean filter, after the first loading and cleaning, it jumps up to 104 Pa at the beginning of the 2nd loading cycle, 147 Pa for the 3rd, 147 for the 4th, 172 Pa for the 5th and finally 197 Pa for the 6th. Dp o makes a large jump from 1st to 2nd due to formation of a skin layer and thereafter the skin layer keeps tightening over repeated loading and Dp o keeps creeping upward but at a much slower pace. For reference, Dp o is also compiled in Table 1 . As will be seen, Dp o is an important measurement ''quantifying" the skin characteristics (inversely related to the skin permeability, or inversely related to the square of capillary radius).
