For growth performance data, after removal of chronics (n = 6) and animals that died (n = 1), trace-mineral source had no effect on d 14, 28, or final BW (P = 0.87) or ADG (P ≥ 0.24; Table 4 ). This concurs with Sharman et al. (2008) , who reported no differences in ADG during a 28-d receiving period in newly received steers supplemented with either sulfate or organic amino acid complex trace minerals at levels equal to those used in the present study. Because a hydroxy source was not included, a comparison for the hydroxy source is not possible. Garcia et al. (2014) reported no difference in ADG of newly received calves fed either NRCrecommended trace-mineral levels or 3 times those levels as inorganic or 50:50 inorganic:organic sources. Engle and Spears (2000) also found no difference in ADG among growing steers individually fed various levels of Cu from sulfate, citrate, hydroxy, or proteinate sources over a 56-d growing phase. Arthington and Spears (2007) investigated the effects of Cu supplemented at 100 mg/d from either sulfate or hydroxy sources in growing heifers and likewise reported similar ADG for both treatments. However, in regard to trace-mineral supple-mentation from sulfate or organic sources, results have not been consistent. Kegley et al. (2012) observed an increase in ADG and final BW over a 42-d backgrounding period in newly received calves supplemented with organic trace minerals versus calves supplemented with sulfate sources at levels identical to those fed in the current study. Average DM consumption of the corn dried distillers grain supplement did not differ (P ≥ 0.35) for any period during the experiment (Table 5 ). Recent research indicated that young calves consumed more creep feed fortified with hydroxy trace minerals compared with creep feed supplemented with sulfate sources of trace minerals (Saran Neto et al., 2014) . In an additional project, when given a choice between supplements, early weaned calves preferred supplements formulated with hydroxy trace minerals versus supplements containing organic and sulfate sources of trace minerals . However, the trace-mineral concentrations in the supplements in the preference study were 5 to 13 times greater than those in the current project, and in this project no differences were observed in how rapidly the cattle consumed these receiving supplements. Sixty-two percent of the calves in the current trial were treated with the initial antibiotic for BRD (Table  6) . Dietary treatment had no effect on the number of calves treated once (P = 0.95), twice (P = 0.71), or 3 times (P = 0.55) for BRD. Numerically, one calf fed sulfate sources was deemed chronic versus 2 and 3 calves fed organic and hydroxy trace-mineral sources, respectively; however, the difference was not significant (P = 0.81). One calf fed hydroxy trace minerals died. Dietary treatment had no effect (P = 0.81) on the average antibiotic cost per calf, the percentage of calves that relapsed (P = 0.64), or the percentage of calves treated twice (P = 0.71; Table 6 ). The day calves received their first, second, third, or last antibiotic treatment was not affected (P ≥ 0.39) by trace-mineral source (Table 6) . Dorton and coworkers (2006) reported similar morbidity results in calves supplemented with either sulfate or organic Cu, Zn, Mn, and Co sources beginning at the ranch after weaning and continuing through a 28-d feedlot receiving phase. Like-wise, Sharman et al. (2008) observed no effect on total morbidity in newly received steers supplemented with Zn, Mn, or Cu from either sulfate or amino acid complexes. However, these authors reported a tendency for an increase in percentage repulls (defined as when an animal is treated more than once for morbidity) in steers supplemented with amino-acid-complex trace minerals compared with no difference in percentage relapse observed in the current study. It is important to note that Sharman et al. (2008) used a point scoring system to assess morbidity in which 1 point was assigned for exhibiting each of the following respiratory symptoms: ocular discharge, nasal discharge, coughing, rapid breathing, and depressed appetite. In addition, 2 additional points were assigned if rectal temperature exceeded 39.5°C, and any steers with a total of 4 or more points were considered morbid and treated with an antibiotic. In the current study, animals were not considered morbid and treated with an antibiotic unless their rectal temperature was ≥40°C regardless of the type or number of symptoms exhibited. These differences in morbidity scoring systems could play a role in the difference between the studies. As was the case with growth performance, morbidity results have not been consistent across trials. In a previous study, Kegley et al. (2012) reported a tendency for a decrease in the percentage of calves receiving a second antibiotic treatment and a tendency for the second treatment to be administered 1-d later in calves that were supplemented with amino-acidcomplex trace minerals versus those supplemented with sulfate sources. A total of 175 calves were measured for BVD type 1 antibody titer response to respiratory vaccination. Antibody titer response was compared in all calves as well as the subpopulation that had no detectable antibody titers on d 0 (naïve calves; n = 117). There was a day of sampling effect (P < 0.0001) in all groups as most calves developed antibodies in response to vaccination. However, dietary treatment had no effect on antibody titer response in all cattle (P ≥ 0.70) or in naïve cattle (P ≥ 0.83) nor was there a treatment × day interaction in either group (P ≥ 0.95; Figure 1 ). Bovine viral diarrhea type 1 virus is only 1 of 5 viral agents that were present in the respiratory vaccine, which also included BVD type 2, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, bovine parainfluenza 3, and bovine respiratory syncytial virus; all viral agents present in the vaccine have been associated with respiratory-tract disease in feedlot calves (Plummer et al., 2004) . Thus, BVD type 1 antibody titer response alone cannot be used to describe trace-mineral source effect on vaccine response. Kegley et al. (2012) reported no difference in BVD virus (which encompasses both BVD type 1 and 2), bovine respiratory syncytial virus, or bovine parainfluenza 3 after vaccination but did observe increases in infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus antibody titers in calves supplemented with sulfate sources of Zn, Mn, Cu, and Co compared with those supplemented with amino-acid-complex sources of Zn, Mn, and Cu, and Co glucoheptonate. Because the current study did not examine any virus other than BVD type 1 titers, a direct comparison cannot be made. However, George et al. (1997) reported improved antibody titer response 14 and 28 d after vaccination to infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus vaccination in calves supplemented with organic trace min- erals versus inorganic minerals. Thus, as seen in previously discussed results, the variability that exists in growth performance and morbidity results for supplemental trace-mineral sources extends to antibody titer response to vaccination. Trace-mineral source had no effect on plasma Cu (P = 0.92) or Zn (P = 0.83) concentrations (Table 7) . All dietary treatments exceeded current NRC (1996) recommendations for Cu and Zn; therefore, differences in plasma concentrations of these trace minerals were not anticipated. Both Cu and Zn plasma concentrations were in the adequate range (0.7 to 0.9 mg/L for Cu and 0.8 to 1.4 mg/L for Zn; Kincaid, 1999) on both sampling days. However, plasma concentrations of Cu are not particularly sensitive to deficient Cu intake as plasma concentrations are not consistently reduced until liver Cu is <40 mg/kg (Claypool et al., 1975) . Thus, it is possible that animals can be marginal in Cu, especially in the short term, without changes in plasma Cu. Plasma Zn concentrations are sensitive to Zn intake, especially if fed at extremely low or extremely high levels, but Zn can also be affected by age, stress, infections, and feed restriction (Kincaid, 1999 ). In addition, Engle et al. (1997) reported a reduced cell-mediated response to phytohemagglutinin injection in calves fed 17 mg/kg Zn compared with calves fed 40 mg/kg Zn with no changes in either plasma or liver Zn concentrations, concluding that cell-mediated immune response may be decreased before functional Zn deficiency symptoms are present.
