The comparisons of the proposed method with the other methods are shown in Tables 4, 5 and 6. If the value in the table is "#", it means that the algorithm does not support the prediction of the length of the sequence, such as TT2NE. The results of the proposed method and the compared methods are all run 10 times for each sequence. Table 4 , in terms of sensitivity, the proposed method provides the best results in nineteen sequences, of which 9 sequences predict 100%. In addition, there are 3 sequences predicting with sensitivities greater than 90%. In terms of specificity, the specificity of 8 sequences in Table 5 is more than 90%, including that the specificity of 6 sequences is 100%. For F-measure, there are 14 sequences exceeding 82%, including 9 sequences above 90%. The proposed method has average sensitivity, specificity, and F-measure of 91.1, 86.9, and 88.0%, respectively. In addition, the average sensitivity of the proposed method is better than the CyloFold method by 7%, better than the TT2NE method by 4.4% and better than the HotKnots method by 12.3%. In case of the average of specificity, the proposed method is better than the CyloFold method by 3.2%, better than the TT2NE method by 13.7% and better than the Hot-Knots method by 13.1%. In case of the average of Fmeasure, the proposed method is better than the CyloFold method by 5.3%, better than the TT2NE method by 8.9% and better than the HotKnots method by 13.1%.
