Our research group's continued interest in the syntheses of diverse carbocyclic nucleosides 10,11 has led to the development of a reliable method for the synthesis of cyclopentenol (À)-7. 12 We recently reported the Cp 2 TiCl-catalyzed reduction of Boc cycloadduct (AE)-6. 13 The reaction was performed on large scale (50 mmol) and an isolated yield of 79% was obtained after the resultant silylated alcohol was deprotected with a simple acidic work-up with 1 M HCl (Scheme 1). Kinetic enzymatic resolution of (AE)-7 was achieved with commercially available immobilized Candida antarctica B lipase to ultimately form the enantiopure alcohol (À)-7. 12 Cyclopentenol (À)-7 was coupled with 3-oxo-3-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)propanoic acid 8 to form allyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl malonate (À)-9 in high yield (Scheme 2). As previously reported, malonate (À)-9 underwent facile decarboxylative rearrangement in the presence of Pd(dba) 2 and dppe to provide homoallylic ester (À)-10 with complete diastereo-and regio-control. 14 Formation of the p-allyl palladium complex proceeded on the less hindered face and anti attack by the in situ generated nucleophilic alkoxy ethenolate species afforded the product with retention of configuration. Reduction of (À)-10 with 2 equiv of diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL-H) yielded the desired alcohol (À)-11. 14 We then turned our attention to construction of the chloroguanine base. 2, 15 Upon deprotection of the Boc group with 12 M HCl, aminoalcohol (À)-11 underwent nucleophilic aromatic substitution with 2-amino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine to afford alcohol (þ)-12 in 50% yield over two steps (Scheme 3). Azo coupling of (þ)-12 with 4chlorobenzenediazonium chloride followed by reduction of the resulting aryl azo compound with Zn in acetic acid afforded triaminopyrimidine (À)-13. 2-Propanol was selected as the co-solvent over ethanol due to the formation of side products from reaction with ethanol. 16 Cyclization of (À)-13 with triethyl orthoformate in the presence of catalytic acid provided chloroguanine (À)-14. Careful monitoring of the reaction time was necessary to prevent substitution of the 6-Cl group with ethanol, which formed an inseparable byproduct. 17 Chloroguanine (À)-14 was refluxed in 0.33 M NaOH for 2 h to produce 5 0 -homocarbovir (À)-3a in 60% yield (Scheme 4). Alternatively, (À)-14 was stirred in 2-propanol at 70 C in the presence of excess cyclopropylamine to form 5 0homoabacavir (À)-3b in 80% yield.
