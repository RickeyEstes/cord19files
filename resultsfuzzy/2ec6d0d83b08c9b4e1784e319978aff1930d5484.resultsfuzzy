The means and confidence intervals for each cohort were plotted in the following manner (see Figure 2 , e.g., plot). First, all cohorts were plotted on a single graph with solid lines representing observations that occurred before the expected impact of the GFC (i.e., 2009 -2010). Second, two close-up plots for each wellbeing domain were created, highlighting particular comparisons of interest. These close-up plots also provide insights into the comparisons of interest for the PSM and DID models. The first close-up compares the 1990 and 1987 cohorts at ages 17 to 21. The second compares the 1990 and 1984 cohorts at ages 20 to 24. Given space restrictions, we provide an example plot for general wellbeing only (see Figure 3 ). However, all graphs, means and 95% confidence intervals, and an interactive graph are available from the paper website at https://pdparker.github.io/GFCweb/. Microdata is available by application from the Australian Data Archive (https://www.ada.edu .au/). A visual inspection of all the graphs suggested that the 1987 and 1990 cohorts had similar (or slightly higher) levels of wellbeing across domains than the earlier cohorts before the GFC. However, a relatively large gap emerges between the earlier and later cohorts, starting at age 19 for the 1990 cohort and age 22 for the 1987 cohort. Thus, results were consistent with the hypothesis that the GFC had a negative impact on wellbeing. Interestingly, there was some evidence of recovery in 2011 (ages 21 for the 1987 cohort and 24 for the 1990 cohort), where in many cases the wellbeing levels returned to those of the other cohorts before again diverging and growing progressively larger. Finally, the first wave of the 1984 cohort was well below trend and may represent an outlier for consideration in later models. The close-up graphs provide strong evidence for the negative impact of the GFC with most of the relevant contrasts displaying overlapping confidence intervals in the years prior to the GFC before diverging. It was on this basis that we explored the hypotheses using PSM and DID models. As a robustness check to the PSM results we ran a series of DID models. In this case two sets of models were estimated. First, we compared the 1990 cohort (who went through the GFC at age 19) to the 1987 cohort. Second, we compared the 1987 cohort (who experienced the GFC at age 22) with the 1984 cohort. Negative DID estimates represent the disadvantage of the GFC exposed cohort over the comparison cohorts in terms of wellbeing. For the DID at age 19, we found significant results for 11 wellbeing variables when we assumed a common trend (satisfaction with money was not significant) and all 12 were significant when we controlled for cohort specific trends. Of these, nine had effect sizes larger that .10. In order of effect size these were satisfaction with leisure time, social life, future prospects, independence, work, career prospects, home life, general, and people in general. Interestingly, the GFC appeared to have a small positive effect on satisfaction with money. At age 22, results not controlling for trend were significant in all domains but only two domains when controlling for cohort specific trends (satisfaction with career prospects and work; see Table 3 ). As we noted above, the first time point for the 1984 cohort was considerably off trend and thus likely exerted considerable leverage on the linear trends. Thus, we also estimated these models excluding the first wave. This resulted in seven out of 12 significant results, with only career prospects having an effect size of the GFC greater than .10. Using z tests, the GFC had significantly larger effects for 19-year-olds than 22year-olds in terms of satisfaction with leisure time, where you live, social life, living standards, and future prospects (ordered in terms of size of difference).
