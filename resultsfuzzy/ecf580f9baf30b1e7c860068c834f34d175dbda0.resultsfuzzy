Next, we explored whether the enhanced EMCV and CV replication observed upon depletion of ATG13 or FIP200 also resulted in higher virus production (Figs. 6 and 8). Infecting ATG13-or FIP200-depleted cells with either EMCV or CV led to a significant reduction in the percentage of surviving cells compared with the control or any other ULK complex component (Fig. 6 C and Fig. 8, A and C) . Analysis of the infective virions released from the cells revealed that the virus titers were increased twofold to fivefold in ATG13-or FIP200depleted cells compared with control cells, which was not observed when other ULK complex components or ATG7 were knocked down (Fig. 6 D and Fig. 8, B and D) . A higher virus titer for EMCV and CV was also observed in ATG13 −/− MEFs (Fig. 2 D) . Conversely, doxycycline-induced overexpression of ATG13 or FIP200 reduced the CV titer in HEK293T cells compared with the noninduced control cells (Fig. 6 , E, H, and K). We furthermore investigated whether these two proteins also control infections caused by other members of the picornavirus family: enterovirus 71 (EV71; member of the EV-A species; Bible et al., 2007) , coxsackievirus A21 (CVA21; member The indicated genes were depleted in U2OS cells, and long-lived protein degradation was measured upon 2 h of amino acid starvation (n = 4). (C) The indicated genes were depleted in U2OS cells before automatically quantify the endogenous p62 puncta (n = 3). All data are presented relative to the control (folds).

Depletion of FIP200 and ATG13 reduced the percentage of surviving cells infected by the three tested viruses (Fig. 9 A) . The decrease in cell survival upon ATG13 and FIP200 depletion was always accompanied by an increase in virus progeny ( Fig. 9 B) , which was not observed upon ATG7 depletion. These results strongly indicate that ATG13 and FIP200 play an important role in controlling the vast majority of picornaviral infections independently of their role in autophagy. ATG13 and FIP200 regulate picornaviral replication through a mechanism that does not directly interfere with viral components or the type-I IFN response A possible mechanism how ATG13 and FIP200 might influence virus replication could be through the IFN-α/β response pathway regulation. Therefore, we tested the mRNA transcription levels of TNF-α, IFN-β< and CXCL10 upon knockdown of either ATG13, FIP200, or ATG7 (Fig. S4 , C-E). We did not observe a significant change in TNF-α and IFN-β mRNA levels (Fig. S4 , C and D), whereas CXCL10 mRNA levels were elevated upon ATG13, FIP200, and ATG7 depletion (Fig. S4  E) , indicating that autophagy is important for its regulation, as previously documented (Kaizuka and Mizushima, 2015) . To gain more insight into the potential process through which ATG13 and FIP200 control picornaviral infections, we explored by protein mass spectrometry (MS) whether ATG13 and FIP200 bind viral factors or eventually different proteins when cells are exposed to CV infection. To this aim, we induced HA-ATG13 or HA-FIP200 expression in HEK293T-REx cells with doxycycline for 24 h and infected them with CV for 6 h or left them uninfected. HEK293T-REx cells not carrying a construct served as a control. Cells were subjected to HA immunoprecipitations and analyzed by liquid chromatography/ tandem MS (Suzuki et al., 2015a; see Table S6 for complete . (E and F) The indicated ATG genes were depleted HeLa cells before infected with EMCV (E) or CV (F). Cells were stained using antibodies against viral proteins and the number of infected cells was determined by automated quantification of immunofluorescence images (n = 3). (G) U2OS cells were infected or not with EMCV or CV, or they were nutrient-starved (EBSS). ATG13 and phosphorylation of ATG13 on serine 318 (p-ATG13) levels were determined and quantified by Western blot (n = 4). Asterisk indicates a crossreacting band. (H) U2OS cells depleted or not of ATG13 were infected or not with EMCV or CV, or they were nutrient starved. Levels of ATG13, the S6 protein, and the S6 protein phosphorylated in serines 235 and 236 (p-S6) were analyzed by Western blot. All data are presented relative to the control (folds).

As expected, ATG13 and FIP200 were binding the other subunits of the ULK complex (Behrends et al., 2010) in infected and uninfected cells, as well as known interactors such as ATG9A (Suzuki et al., 2015b) and components of the C9orf72-SMCR8-WDR41 complex recently found to regulate autophagy (Sullivan et al., 2016; Fig. S4 F) . Importantly, we did not find an interaction between either ATG13 or FIP200 with any of the CV proteins, or main changes in the interactome of ATG13 and FIP200, upon infection ( Fig. S4 F and Table S6 ). In addition, a distribution analysis of ATG13 and FIP200 during CV and EMCV infection in U2OS cells by immunofluorescence showed no colocalization between these two proteins with the viral replication complexes (unpublished data). Furthermore, depletion of ATG13, FIP200, or ATG7 did not change the localization of either EMCV or CV replication complexes compared with the control cells (Fig. S5, A-D) . We also did not observe differences in the morphology of the CV replication structures upon ATG13 depletion compared with the control by electron microscopy (Fig. S5, F and G) . This type of analysis, however, showed that there are more cells displaying typical CV replication structures, which appear late in CV life cycle (Fig. S5 E, category 1; Limpens et al., 2011) , confirming the finding that ATG13 depletion accelerates the infection by this virus (Fig. S5 E) . Altogether, these results strongly suggest that ATG13 and FIP200 regulate picornavirus replication through a process that does not directly interfere with viral components.
