Direct sequencing of Case X. It was observed that a single case deviated in the identification of the mutation in exon 19 between Therascreen PCR and the LAMP assay. To confirm this result, direct sequencing of the target site of exon 19 was performed. Direct sequencing results demonstrated no mutation in exon 19 in Case X, which was concordant with the results of the LAMP assay. To reconfirm the status of EGFR mutation in Case X, four additional FFPE tissue blocks in Case X were used to extract further DNA samples. The hematoxylin-eosin (HE) images of these FFPE blocks are presented in Fig. 2 . Following removal of normal lung tissues, DNA samples were extracted as aforementioned, and investigated using Therascreen EGFR PCR and a LAMP assay. In all the four samples, the deletion mutation in exon 19 was identified using both Therascreen PCR and LAMP assays. Furthermore, direct sequencing revealed a novel exon 19 EGFR deletion mutation in samples a and b; NG_007726.3: g.160744_160761delinsGCA represented the deletion of nucleotides g.160744 to g.160761 (ATTAAGAGAAGCAACATC, data not shown), which were replaced by a GCA nucleotide triplet, changing GGAATTAAGAGAAGCAACATCTCC to GGAGCATCC (data not shown), resulting in shortening substation in the protein (p.Leu747_Ser752delinsHis).
