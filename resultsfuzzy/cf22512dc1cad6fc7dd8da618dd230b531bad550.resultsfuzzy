The last year has seen some consensus emerging, particularly in the UK and USA, in two important areas: the use of cortico-steroids in the management of adults with bacterial meningitis the management of drug sensitive and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis For bacterial meningitis; the first randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of adjunctive steroids (301 adults) showed a reduction in the proportion of patients who had unfavourable outcomes (15% vs 25%, p ¼ 0:03) and the proportion of patients who died (7% vs 15%, p ¼ 0:04). The benefits were most obvious in patients with pneumococcal meningitis (N Engl J Med 2002; 347:1549 -1556). Adjunctive dexamethasone therapy is now recommended for most adults with suspected pneumococcal meningitis. However, most health care-associated infections are endemic and result from cross-transmission related to inappropriate patient-care practices. To improve healthcare workers' (HCW) compliance with practices, infection control should learn from the behavioural sciences. Infection control professionals play key roles in the identification and prevention of nosocomial infections. They act as observers, educators and, ultimately, should become change agents. Changing behaviour and shifting social norms at multiple levels through the HCW community are among the key challenges of infection control today. Although a modification of patient-care practices is vital for infection prevention, this issue has received only little attention in the medical literature. During the latter half of the 20th century, it was suggested that social behaviour could be best understood as a function of people's perceptions rather than as a function of real life. This assumption gave birth to several models based on social cognitive variables to improve our understanding of human behaviour. Cognitive variables used in these models include: knowledge, motivation, intention, perception of threat, outcome expectancy, perceived and actual behavioural control, and social pressure. These determinants shape behaviour; they are acquired through the socialisation process and, importantly, are susceptible to change. Some social cognitive models (Health Belief Model, Health Locus of Control, Protection Motivation Theory, Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Self-Efficacy Model) have been applied to evaluate predictors of health behaviour but, so far, none has been successfully applied to explain behaviour in the field of infection control. Successful strategies to improve infection control practices result from their multidimensional aspect. Successful behaviour change can well by explained by applying the theory of Ecological Perspective, which is based on two key ideas: a) behaviour is viewed as being affected by and affecting multiple levels of influence; b) behaviour both influences and is influenced by the social environment. Levels of influence for health-related behaviours and conditions include intra-personal, inter-personal, institutional, and community factors, as well as administrative support. Intra-personal factors are individual characteristics that influence behaviour such as knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and personality traits. Inter-personal factors include inter-personal processes and primary groups-family, friends, and peers-that provide social identity, support and role definition. HCWs can be influenced by or are influential in their social environments. Behaviour is often influenced by peer group pressure. Social Cognitive Theory states that people learn not only through their own experiences, but also by observing others' actions and the results of those actions, as well as through modelling. Institutional factors to be considered to promote change include the availability and easy access to rules, policies, as well as technical and informal structures that help to promote recommended behaviours. Responsibilities for each HCWs' individual group must be clearly recognised and defined. Community factors are social networks and norms that exist either formally or informally between individuals, groups, and organisations. For example, in the hospital, the community level would be the ward. Community-level models are frameworks for understanding how social systems function and change, and how communities and organisations can be activated. The conceptual framework of community organisation models is based on social networks and support, focusing on the active participation and development of communities that can help evaluate and solve health problems. Public policy factors include local policies that regulate or support practices for disease prevention, control, and management. The institutional administration must openly support the creation of a multidisciplinary task force to address the problem of infection cross-transmission within the ward or the hospital. By this, it mandates representative members of the multidisciplinary institutional team to come together to identify the problem and to develop strategies to resolve it; it also endorses the choice and options taken and mobilizes the hospital resources needed to implement the strategies. Based on behavioural theories and reported experiences, multimodal intervention strategies have more chance of success than single approaches or promotion programmes focusing on one or two elements only. Similarly, social models that include several levels of cognitive determinants have more chance of success to explain change in behaviour. Concrete examples applied to infection control issues will be presented. Studies are needed to assess the key determinants of infection control practices and behaviour promotion among the different populations of HCWs, to develop methods to secure senior management support, and to implement and evaluate the impact of the different components of multimodal programmes to promote optimal infection control practices. The 5-year data collected showed a total of 626 adult patients who underwent transplants. This unit accepts patients over the age of 18 years. 11 patients had infection with rhinoviruses accounting for 40% of viral diagnosis. Other viruses present include, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (22.2%), influenza A (18.5%), Para influenza (PIV) (14.8%) and enteroviruses (7.4%). Herpes simplex and CMV infections were excluded from the study and no adenovirus infections were found. Only patients with rhino viral infections will be further discussed in this report. The frequency of infection due to rhinoviruses was 1.8%. The prevalence being higher in allogeneic compared with autologous recipients. 2 out of a total of 4 deaths were directly attributable to a rhinovirus respiratory infection.
