To test the modelling components of the AMPP, we performed an automatic structural characterization of a tetrameric α-helical membrane channel Aquaporin0 in DDM solution. The AMPP was utilized in all three pipeline regimes: i) with the high resolution model available ii) with detergent composition and the protein primary structure (FASTA sequence) known iii) plain ab initio modelling (no a priori information). The models generated from these three modelling trajectories are displayed in Figure 6 (as the protein was known to be tetrameric, P4 symmetry was utilized in MONSA and DAMMIF). Figure. 6. Examples of automatically reconstructed Aquaporin0 PDC models by the AMPP pipeline utilizing MEMPROT (hybrid modeling with known protein model (PDB:2B6P) and unknown detergent belt) (A), MONSA (multi-phase ab initio, the model was built from precalculated searching volume; fourfold symmetry around z-axis is imposed) (B) and DAMMIF(C) (single phase ab initio also with P4 symmetry applied). The first row shows the side view cross-section of the PDC components that is represented with a section inside the detergent corona; protein beads are green for ab initio models and colored according to atom type for the hybrid model, detergent tails and heads are blue and red, respectively. The second and third rows represent the top and the side view of the models. Expectedly, the automatically generated Aquaporin0 models display more adequate structural details with increasing amount of a priori information. The single phase based model generated ab initio by DAMMIF (Fig. 6C) provides only the overall shape roughly approximating that of the protein-detergent complex. This reflects the limitation of the ab initio shape determination procedure, which must assume constant density inside the particle. The more information-rich multi-phase MONSA and MEMPROT models (Fig. 6B, A) display a good level of similarity, with the hybrid model generated using the latter program being more detailed and arguably having a higher resolution. For the multi-phase MONSA modeling path the starting cylindrical search volume used for protein-solvent phases was considerably larger than the final model and contains a spherical core with the fixed protein phase (green area shown in Figure 5B ). However, after the minimization procedure the volume occupied by the protein phase becomes only slightly larger than the central fixed spherical volume, and the MONSA models do display protrusions resembling the four α-helical "legs" expected for Aquaporin0. These models are similar to those generated using the hybrid modeling path with MEMPROT, where the protein structure is assumed to be known. The automatically generated models using the three modeling paths of the pipeline provide good fits to the experimental data at low angles, thus the overall particle shapes coincide and are well described by the data. The deviations observed at higher resolution ( Figure 7) reflect contributions from the detergents including the complex contrast situation, which is not accurately captured by the simplified modeling procedures used. This intentional simplification was justified for the sake of speed, such that preliminary models are generated that describe the gross structure of PDCs and do not attempt to describe internal inhomogeneties. One of the simplifications we implemented for the MEMPROT modeling was to assume a horizontal detergent torus with a circular geometry, and a fixed ellipticity e = 1. It should be stressed, that further model refinement is recommended in order to obtain more accurate and detailed models, using initial parameters suggested by the pipeline, and as necessary additional penalties as required (such as increased penalty for looseness and/or discontinuity, a higher number of experimental points and dummy beads in the MONSA grid, free ellipticity parameter for MEMPROT, etc). Similar results were obtained from the mechanosensitive channel T2 experimental data obtained at the P12 beamline (Figures 7b-8 ). There is a high degree of similarity between the three types of models generated, and interestingly, MONSA does reconstruct models with a void in the protein phase (green beads in Figure 8 ). This void is maintained also when an increased penalty for the bead discontinuity during minimization is introduced. Upon inspection, the high resolution model of a homologous structure, the MscS ion channel of T. tengcongensis (PDB: 3T9N) also displays a void in the extracellular domain of the structure. Thus the multiphase ab initio reconstruction reliably generates features consistent with those expected for the T2 ion channel. Figure. 8. Automatically reconstructed T2 models by the AMPP pipeline utilizing MEMPROT (hybrid modeling: 3T9N pdb model with found shape of detergent corona) (A), MONSA (multi-phase ab initio with P7 symmetry) (B) and DAMMIF (single phase ab initio, P7 symmetry) (C). The first row shows the side view cross-section of the PDC components that is represented with a section inside the detergent corona; protein beads are green for ab initio models and colored according to atom type for the hybrid model, detergent tails and heads are blue and red, respectively. The second and third rows represent the top and the side view of the models. The reconstructed MONSA model of the T2 channel protein fit the data reasonably well up to s = 0.25 Å -1 . The on-the-fly generated MEMPROT model fits only up to s = 0.09 Å -1 , which corresponds to the real-space resolution D = 2π/s ~ 60 Å. It is also worth noting that atomistic models are often incomplete, missing eg. density for flexible loops which could not be resolved at high resolution. In general, to reliably reconstruct a PDC it is recommended to utilize both methods (full ab initio with MONSA, and hybrid with MEMPROT) and compare the results. Thus, the ab initio modelling is an important component of the automated MP modelling procedure implemented here. In summary, an automated SAXS-based data analysis pipeline modified for multi-contrast systems has been developed and implemented at the P12 beamline of the EMBL (Petra-III, Hamburg). The pipeline facilitates the determination of the overall parameters and automated construction of low-resolution structures of solubilized PDCs. Given that the interpretation of the SAXS data from membrane proteins is by far non-trivial task, these results and models are
