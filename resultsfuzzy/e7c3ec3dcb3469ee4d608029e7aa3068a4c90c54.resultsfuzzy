1) Choice Of System For Quantum Calculations: Choosing the system size is critical to start; if too small, the result will be unrealistic, if too large there will be no result at all in a finite time. Boundaries matter. We avoid most of the difficulties of the boundary by using a large cluster (976 atoms in the first results, which we review here; an 1180 atom calculation is in progress). Using many fewer atoms (672 atoms) led to the collapse of the structure, and a clearly nonsensical result; too many of the side chains had been deleted, leaving a cavity in the center of the VSD. The surrounding residues, including the backbone atoms, collapsed into this cavity. While not done for this purpose, this also helped show that the backbone is not inherently immobile in these calculations. (It also suggests that an RC mutation, which leaves a volume of the order of 100 Å 3 , could be subject to collapse, so that the SCAM results must be evaluated with this in mind.) The 976 atom structure contained all the side chains that could interact with each other. There is no cavity, so no collapse, and we observe no vertical motion of the backbone of S4 either. The central region of the cluster in this case is far enough from the boundary that we can be reasonably confident that the changes calculated on transferring protons in the center are accurate. We have already discussed the fact that what we get is the energy minimum, which corresponds to 0 K. We noted this does have one advantage, in that it allows comparison with Xray structures that are determined at temperatures below the lowest phase transition of water, and are thus presumably not very different from the 0 K structures. Cryo EM structures are of course also determined at low temperature. (An alternative, starting from snapshots of MD simulations (124) , and then finding an energy minimum, seems to combine disadvantages of both methods.) By using a larger structure we minimize boundary issues. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/371914 doi: bioRxiv preprint We have carried out quantum calculations on 29 states of the 976 atom section (904 atoms of protein plus 24 molecules of water in a cleft at the extracellular end) of the VSD of K v 1.2, where "states" refers to some combination of the field on the system and the position of a proton that can occupy positions on one of several side chains. 2) Results: A triad of residues, Y266, E183, R300, exchanged a proton when the membrane depolarized. The triad is very similar to a triad in bacteriorhodopsin from the 1.52Å resolution structure of Lanyi et al (rcsb pdb: 1p8H) (71) . Bacteriorhodopsin is known to transmit protons. The hydrophobic section of the VSD is capable of transferring a proton. There is, below this triad, a second triad that would provide a next step in the path for the proton, in going from open to closed. These are linked through the Y266, the other two members of the second triad being R303 and E226. We can propose a path all the way from this group through to the gate. The triads shown in Fig. 6 are further along in the path than the YRE triad discussed above. In the section in the middle of the calculated region (the Y266, R300, E183 section), there are two possible pathways for the proton to go through, either via the tyrosine Y266, or the glutamate E226. The two possible proton pathways are shown in Fig. 7 . The difference in energy of the states is comparable to the exchange plus correlation energy differences.

The much larger electrostatic and kinetic energy terms more than made up for the differences, but if these relatively small differences in XC terms were neglected, the states would still be placed out of order.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/371914 doi: bioRxiv preprint tyrosine that has to ionize to make that pathway work. It appears that mutating this to a phenylalanine must interrupt this path, and make it more difficult to open the channel. The experiment has been carried out by Dr. Carlos Bassetto and Professor Francisco Bezanilla, and it showed approximately a 1.7 fold drop in slope of the gating current -voltage curve, showing that eliminating the possibility of ionizing this residue did interfere with gating, as predicted. In the standard models, one might expect, if anything, that given the slightly smaller volume of phenylalanine, a Y266F mutation might increase the probability of gating, rather than decreasing it, because it would be easier for S4 to slide up. Since the E226 path remains, the channel still functions, but not as well. This evidence supports the model we propose, and tends to refute the standard model. There must be a gating charge, so that there must be a shift in the center of charge. For the 976 atom case, we used NBO to find the charges on all the atoms. Then, by dividing the system into 11 3 Å slices, and adding all the charges on the atoms in each slice, we determined the center of charge in the two cases of low energy (-70 mV, Y266=R300=E183=0 nominal charge, 0 mV Y266 negative, R300 positive, E183 zero nominal charge). For the -70 mV case, the center of charge was at 19.6 Å, for the 0 mV case, at 8.3 Å, for a shift of 11.3 Å. This is very nearly just what it should be, but it must be taken with caution, as the error bar on this value may be several Angstroms. The total charge on the system is always +2. GATING MODEL FROM THE COMPUTATION: If proton transfer provides gating current we should find a way in which intracellular protons could close the channel, while protons that have left the intracellular section would allow it to open. We note that near the gate there is a histidine (H418 in the 3Lut numbering) on the C terminal end of the pore helix S6, which could affect gating if charged. If this histidine is deleted, the channel stops functioning (162) . There are also two glutamates on T1 in the neighborhood. While none of these shows conclusively that there is a spot at which the proton chain stops, they do show that there are possible places for the protons to act on the channel gate. Further work will be required to show which of these residues acts, or which combination does. The presence of proton acceptors adds to the plausibility of the model. The fact that T1, the intracellular section just below the membrane, is involved in gating (22, 163, 164) is itself interesting. Several suggestions as to how to integrate this into standard models have been made, although it is not obvious how to do so. T1 sits partially below the VSD and has an unusually polar interface. Also, given the geometry of the system, there is space for water molecules at the bottom of the VSD, just above T1. These waters help form a path that could conduct protons. Wang and Covarrubias (164) found that the cysteines in T1 react at very different rates with an MTS reagent; reaction depends on ionization of the cysteine, which suggests a possible reason for the difference in The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/371914 doi: bioRxiv preprint rates; it also suggests a role for a proton, since the ionization of the cysteine requires the transfer of a proton. T1, together with the water at the intracellular surface, appears to create a path for protons; this does not necessarily include a role for the ionization of cysteine in T1, but it does make it probable that the ionization of T1 cysteines may be important. We can hypothesize a path to (toward) the gate from the section we have already computed by examining possible hydrogen bonds that could create a path for the H + to follow. Fig. 8 suggests how this would be possible. In Fig. 8 , the postulated path shows only the S1 hydrophobic residues, but there are neighboring helices, and very likely water between them. Oliver and Deamer showed increased H + permeability through a membrane with a group of alpha helices of hydrophobic residues (165) , analogous to what we postulate here. Beyond the section that we have already calculated, we must show how a proton cascade can reach the gate, if the gate opens as a consequence of deprotonation, or closes with protonation. In Fig.   8 the path for protons that proceeds from the section we have calculated through an intracellular path to the gate includes T1, which, as noted earlier, has been shown to be involved in gating. This part of the path does involve water. The calculated section is voltage dependent, while this intracellular section is expected to have little direct voltage dependence, although it would shift protons depending on the state of the channel because of the change in protonation of the residues above it, which do respond to voltage shifts, in a sort of domino cascade. As the voltage sensitive protons shift, they pull/push the next members of the cascade. THE STRUCTURE OF THE GATE: Finally, when we get to the gate itself, we observe that essentially all models assume that there is an increase in the diameter of the gate to admit K + ions. There is debate as to the size of the opening, or the extent of the opening compared to the closed conformation; a quite small increase in diameter would be adequate, of the order of about 4 Å(166), meaning a 2 Å displacement per VSD. There is also a cavity in the pore in which an ion is found in the X-ray structure. An incoming potassium ion would have to interact with such an ion, which could knock back an incoming ion that moved beyond the entrance to the pore toward the cavity. This ion has no particular force pushing it into the gate; there is a concentration dependence of the free energy of the ion in the external solution(102) (see Fig. 3 ) that suggests a free energy gradient on K + that might help somewhat, especially with getting the ion into the .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/371914 doi: bioRxiv preprint gate. We have done a limited calculation of the interaction potential that suggests that the water so substantially reduces the interaction energy between an ion at the gate and the cavity ion that, as long as the ion at the gate stays at the gate, the repulsion energy is almost zero. However, the ion then cannot advance, or displace the water or the ion in the cavity. Therefore, we proposed that the gate would have to oscillate, complexing and holding the incoming ion, which then cannot be knocked back, so that the ion in the cavity would proceed to the bottom state of the selectivity filter, given a little time, once the bottom state of the selectivity filter becomes available. Once the cavity cleared, the ion at the gate could move into the cavity, not so much having pushed the previous ion forward, as having simply allowed it to move, and then replaced it. The cycle is indicated in Fig. 9 , reproduced from (40) . This implies that the gate can complex K + well enough to force the ion in the cavity to move up, or at least allow it to move up. The complex must not be so tight that, once the cavity becomes available, it cannot release the K + ; the cavity location is then of lower energy than the solution, so that the ion moves into the cavity rather than back to solution, and the current continues. Here it is interesting to compare the KcsA closed structure to the K v 1.2 open structure, for both of which X-ray structures exist. Kariev and Green noted that the gate opening was about a 3 Å increase in the radius of the intracellular gate (167) .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/371914 doi: bioRxiv preprint appears to be an increased density of water at the gate, rather than a change in protein conformation or gate diameter. Adapted from ref. (40) Then the 15 Å N -N distance (between nitrogens of two prolines from opposite VSDs in K v 1.2) would be consistent with the entrance of a hydrated K + , with the ion not yet complexed by protein. A calculation of the pore region, with a total of 50 water molecules in a total of 870 atoms showed that there was no difference in the N-N distance with a K + at the gate, but about three more water molecules clustered there, for a total of thirteen, compared to about ten when the ion was just below the selectivity filter. Apparently water is responsible for the oscillating gate effect. An ion can be tightly held by the increase in the number of water molecules that are both hydrogen bonded to the protein and linked to the ion. Moving the ion relaxes the water conformation, allowing another ion to approach. Both KcsA and K v 1.2 have linear ln[K + ] vs ln σ curves, which should correspond to a barrier, as we discussed earlier (Fig. 3 ). If we compare the need for a barrier to the steps for an oscillating gate, the most obvious step to have the barrier is ab in Fig. 9 . Here an ion from solution must enter the gate, bring the gate, with its water, to the position that complexes the ion, and rearrange the water in the cavity. Thus the model is consistent with the data; since the free energy gradient should affect an ion at the gate, but not further up the pore, the concentration dependence seems to require that that the barrier demonstrated by Fig. 3 be at the intracellular end of the pore. Summary on VSD calculation: The energy, atomic charges, and bond order in the VSD calculation depended on both the proton position and the applied field. The net result was that the energy for the closed (-70 mV) state is lower with arginine, glutamate, and tyrosine all neutral, while the open state has a proton transferred from tyrosine to arginine (tyrosine negative, arginine positive, glutamate neutral). This calculation is being extended to the remainder of the proton path; a plausible path has been postulated. SPECIFIC COMPUTATIONAL METHODS: In the QM calculations reported here, we have obtained the structures of the energy minima by optimization at HF/6-31G* level. This includes exchange but not correlation energy, in addition to all those terms that have classical analogues (kinetic energy, electronnuclear interaction, and electron-electron and nuclear-nuclear repulsion). However, the omitted correlation energy, while the smallest term, is still not negligible in determining the differences in energy c) Providing a hypothesis that shows much of the remainder of a path that a proton could follow from gate to the extracellular surface of the membrane.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/371914 doi: bioRxiv preprint d) Considering several experiments that are typically ignored or interpreted in contradictory fashion in order to fit them to the standard model, when more natural interpretations are consistent with proton transport. e) Consideration of analogous systems, such as H v 1, cytochrome c, bacteriorhodopsin, and the flu M channel that are known to transmit protons, It is of particular interest that all of these, like the VSD of the K v channel, have the same tyrosine-arginine-glutamate arrangement in the apparent proton path, as well as other similarities (e.g., an RER/RDR triad) that would create a proton path. It would be of interest to investigate other proteins that transmit protons to determine whether this triad is a recurring motif in proton transport in proteins. f) The K v 1.2 channel at least has an increase in water density at the gate when an ion is present. The KcsA channel has an interesting water structure at the gate. Although water is not involved in the triad proton transfers, it is critical to the behavior of the channel. g) The center of charge shifts very nearly just as much as one would expect; this result must have a fairly large error bar attached, but it is almost exactly what should be expected. Taken together we have considered as much as possible of the relevant evidence, and found that the evidence supports proton transport as the source of gating current better than it supports the standard models.
