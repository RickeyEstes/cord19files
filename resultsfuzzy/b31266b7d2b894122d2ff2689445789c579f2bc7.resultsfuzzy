Almost all of the previous analyses revealed that SARS-CoVs form a distinct group different from the other three groups of coronaviruses. However, the question that how SARS-CoVs emerged suddenly still remains open. Rota et al. and Marra et al. performed phylogenetic analysis based on sequence alignments using different genes. The results indicated that SARS-CoVs belong to a new group but the original group that SARS-CoVs were derived from could not be determined . The detection of SARS-CoV-like viruses in Himalayan palm civets and other small animals in live retail market indicates a rout of interspecies transmission, although the natural reservoir is unknown. Virus infection was also detected in humans working at the same market. All the animal isolates retain a special 29-nucleotide fragment, which is not found in most human isolates . Stavrinides and Guttman made phylogenetic analysis on the SARS virus replicase, surface spike, matrix, and nucleocapsid proteins. The results support a mammalian-like origin for the replicase protein, an avian-like origin for the matrix and nucleocapsid proteins, and a mammalian-avian mosaic origin for the host-determining spike protein. They proposed that a recombination event between mammalian-like and avian-like parent viruses within the S gene might have taken place (Stavrinides and Guttman, 2004) . However, the phylogenetic inference based on genome contents tends to locate the recombinant outside of related genomes, such as seen in Fig.  3 . Therefore, we emphasize that it is very unlikely to trace back the evolutionary history such as the recombination event using the method presented. The present method reflects the global characters of genomes because the whole genome is taken into consideration. The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3) reveals that the SARS-CoVs have undergone an independent evolution path after the divergence from the other coronaviruses. As can be seen from Fig. 3 , the distance between the SARS-CoVs and all the others is the greatest. We supposed that the precursor of SARS-CoV may have existed in some hosts and developed separately for many years. Grigoriev found that the mutational patterns in SARS-CoV genome were strikingly different from the other coronaviruses in terms of mutation rates (Grigoriev, 2004) . Phylogenetic analysis based on codon usage pattern suggested that SARS-CoV was diverged far from all the three known groups of coronavirus (Gu et al., 2004) . The overall level of similarity between SARS-CoVs and the other coronaviruses is low . We suppose that this is due to different evolution paths. The isolation of SARS-CoV-like virus in Himalayan palm civets indicates a route of interspecies transmission. We hypothesize that some events such as the nucleotide deletion or mutation in some important genes of the precursor may have resulted in the change of host range.
