The first step is to amplify heavy-and light-chain immunoglobulin variable regions ( and ) using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To obtain first-strand cDNA for PCR reaction, messenger RNA (mRNA) needs to be extracted from hybridoma cells before reverse transcription. The success to obtain a correct sequence for each and mainly depends on the selection of primer set and optimised conditions of PCR reaction. Different primer sets have been developed for amplifying the variable domains [14] [15] [16] [17] . Mouse Ig-Primer set is also commercially available. For example, the one from Novagen has been successfully applied in many previous studies (e.g., [18] [19] [20] [21] ). In order to determine the sequence of DNA products from PCR, blunt end ligation with a DNA topoisomerase provides an efficient way to clone the DNA into a vector [22] . While the use of polymerase with proofreading activity significantly reduces the chance of mutations being introduced in the PCR amplification step, the sequence alignment of multiple clones will also easily reveal a mismatch that is found in a rare clone. In most of the clones, an identical sequence should be obtained. However, if two or more sets of sequences are obtained, then, it is very likely that the hybridoma cells used for mRNA extraction are heterogeneous, implicating that hybridoma cells need to be further subcloned. Once the correct and sequences have been obtained, they can be subcloned into vectors containing the constant region of the human heavy and light chain, respectively ( Figure 1 ). These vectors are designed for mammalian expression and can be home-made or commercially available. An example of the latter is the pair of pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1 and pFUSE2ss-CLIg-hk vectors from InvivoGen. Expression of the human-mouse chimeric antibody is achieved by transfecting the vectors into a transfectable mammalian cell line like the Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells (HEK 293). The secreted antibody can then be purified from the culture supernatant and tested to determine if it still retains the antigen-binding capacity after chimerization. A direct comparison with the mouse monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma will reveal if there is any incompatibility between the mouse variable and human constant regions in the mouse-human chimeric antibody. The previous methodology is summarized in Figure 1 and has been used to convert the mouse mAb 1A9 to its chimeric human-mouse form. mAb 1A9 is an antibody generated in mice against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein [23] . As shown in Figure 2 , both the mouse 1A9 and chimeric 1A9 are able to bind to spike protein in HEK 293-FT cell lysates that were transfected with plasmid containing the full-length spike gene, pXJ3 -S.
