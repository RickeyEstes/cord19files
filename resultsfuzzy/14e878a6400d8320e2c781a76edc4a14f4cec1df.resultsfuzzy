Patient characteristics. A total of 221 specimens were collected from children presenting with symptoms of ARI between September 2009 and February 2012 ( Table 1) . The socio-demographic characteristics of the study patients are presented in Table 1 . Overall, the study consisted of 130 males (58.8%) and 91 females (41.2%) with patients' median age of 1 (IQR: 0 -5) years. Seventy-four patients (33.5%) were children under one year of age, 105 (47.5%) were between 1 to 6 years old, 33 (14.9%) were 6 to 12 years old, and 9 (4.1%) were 12 to 18 years old. Sixty-seven (30.3%) of the children had an underlying disease (asthma, immune-deficiency, allergic rhinitis, or cystic fibrosis). At the time of diagnosis 13 (5.8%) patients were receiving chemotherapy, and 95 (43%) had received an antibiotic. Virological characterization. Samples were screened for 11 virus targets included in the ResPlexII respiratory panel. Of the 221 ARI episodes, 116 (52.5%) were confirmed to be of viral etiology being positive for at least one of the virus targets tests ( Table  2 ). The majority (n=103; 88%) of viral ARI episodes were observed in children under 6-year of age (chisquare, p<0.05). Figure 1 shows the frequency of each of the viruses detected in the study population. Overall 188 viruses were detected. Rhinovirus (RhV) was the most common virus detected in 81 (69.8%) patients followed Cystic fibrosis 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 2) . A significant majority (n=46; 93.9%; chi-square p-value<0.05) of coinfections occurred in children under six years of age. The most frequent viral co-infections involved two viruses (n=33), 10 cases had a triple infection, 5 had four viruses detected, and one case had five viruses. Almost half cases of Rhinovirus (50.6%) were positive for at least another virus in the panel. CVEV positive cases also had a high rate of coinfection (73%). Moreover, hMPV and INFB were detected in 9 samples, and all were co-infected. Table 3 summarizes the correlation of different viruses among our patients. Several correlations enhancing infectivity were evident in our analysis. Of note, RhV was the most frequently detected virus in co-infections and was significantly associated with RSVB, INFB, PIV3, hMPV, and CVEV. Underlying conditions and clinical presentation. We next analyzed the correlation between each of the viral etiologies or co-infection with the underlying conditions ( Table 2) . To simplify the analysis, we treated subtypes or genotypes of a virus as a single group (e.g. RSV for RSVA and RSVB, etc.). Having an underlying condition or receiving chemotherapy or a course of antibiotics were not found to be a risk factor for having a viral etiology or co-infection ( Table 2) . Additionally, we investigated the seasonal variation of viruses. Rhinovirus infections were detected throughout the year however the peak rate occurred during the main rainy months (November, December), likely for Coxsackie/Echovirus and RSV. On the other hand,Influenza A virus infections had a peak in the fall (September, October); (Figure 3 ). In terms of clinical symptoms, fever, cough and rhinorrhea were major symptoms observed in most of the patients infected with one or more respiratory virus ( Table 2) . Chisquare analysis revealed a significant correlation between rhinorrhea and INF, CVEV, and RhV and coinfection ( Table 2) . Bivariate logistic regression was then performed to determine the risk associated with these infections. Our analysis revealed that RhV or A multivariate logistic regression model was used to examine the correlates of rhinorrhea in the study patients. Variables were put in the model in order of strength of their correlation with rhinorrhea as per the bivariate analysis. The effect of each variable on the model was assessed, and the variable was kept if it significantly contributed to a better fit of the model. The final model included the following variables: RhV and CVEV. The results of the multivariate model showed that CVEV was independently associated with rhinorrhea (OR: 4.73; CI: 1.59 -14.07). CVEV infected patients were 4.73 times more likely to have rhinorrhea compared to none-CVEV patients controlling for RhV. Unlike the bivariate analysis, RhV was not significantly associated with rhinorrhea (OR: 1.78; CI: 0.91 -3.48). RhV infected patients were 1.78 times more likely to have rhinorrhea compared to none-RhV patients controlling for CVEV; however, this was not statistically significant. Discussion. We demonstrated that viral infections are responsible for at least half of the ARIs in children in Lebanon. Rhinovirus infection was the most common etiology of ARI consistent with other studies from Lebanon and other countries. 18, 20, 21 In neighboring Jordan and Egypt rhinovirus incidence was second to RSV, but the population captured in these studies was younger than that included in our study. 22, 23 The overall viral ARI incidence (52.5%) in our study lower than that recently reported by Finianos et al. (70%) in Lebanon. 18 Both studies targeted children; however, Finianos et al. screened their specimens for more viral targets than those included in our analysis. In our study we did not test for HCoV, AdV, EV, and HBoV which collectively accounted for 50% of viral ARI in the study by Finianos et al. The coinfection rate in our study (42.9%) was higher than that previously reported in Lebanon (37%), Qatar (21.4%), and Egypt (10.8%). 18, 23, 24 This incongruence could be because CVEV, which was frequently detected with other viruses in our study, was not screened in the previous studies from the region. 18 CVEV infections are not commonly reported in studies investigating respiratory infections. In our study, CVEV infection constituted 38.8% of all viral ARI cases and was independently associated with rhinorrhea. This incidence is much higher than that reported in other countries. A recent study in Latin America reported that CVEV was associated with 3% of the ARI cases. 25 In Central America, CVEV was even much lower (0.3%). 26 The very low prevalence of CVEV in other regions might have discouraged its testing. Given the high prevalence of CVEV in Lebanon, we recommend testing for enteroviruses, including (CVEV). Co-infections were found to be more common younger children in Lebanon, and that is similar to a previous study done in Mexican children showing that the majority of coinfections occur in children <6 months of age. 27 Younger children are likely to be more prone to infections due to their lack or still weak immunity to respiratory viruses. The effect of coinfections on disease outcomes is not well understood. 28 Patients coinfected with pandemic H1N1 influenza and rhinovirus tended to have milder clinical severity when compared with non-rhinovirus coinfections; 29 while the patients coinfected with HMPV and RSV were prone to a higher risk of severe bronchiolitis. 30 Additionally, the prevalence and severity of obstructive airway disease were higher in patients with coinfections. 31 In our study, coinfection was associated with higher risk of rhinorrhea but not with more severe symptoms like dyspnea. In contrast, some studies showed no correlation between coinfection status and clinical severity. 32, 33 The complexity of viral coinfections and the large number of respiratory viruses involved make challenging to study the effect of coinfection on disease outcome in a clinical setting. Therefore, there is a need for developing in vitro or in vivo models to allow a better understanding of coinfections. For example, dual infection with INF was shown to suppress RSV growth in vitro. 34 The suppression of RSV by INF was suggested to be due to competition for protein synthesis and budding from the cell surface. Further studies are warranted to investigate the interactions among respiratory viruses during coinfection and their effect on the host.
