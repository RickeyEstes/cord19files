Estimation results for the specified models indicate that strong GARCH effects are evident in virtually all of the regressions, with the sum of estimated (statistically significant) coefficients very close to one. This finding is consistent with the literature on high frequency exchange rate dynamics. 19 The estimated daily conditional correlations from the bivariate CCC-GARCH and DCC-GARCH models are plotted in Fig. 4 . 20 The estimates obtained within the CCC framework show that Hong Kong and Taiwan are the two Asian countries whose forward market returns have the strongest interdependence with China: their conditional correlation coefficients are 0.31 and 0.31, respectively. Malaysia and Indonesia show the lowest conditional correlations: 0.04 and 0.11, respectively. 21 Fig. 4 (continued) . 19 For the sake of brevity, the GARCH estimation results are not presented here, but are available from the authors upon request. Qualitatively similar results arise for maturities of three, six and nine months. 20 Because of the model's popularity, Tse (2000) has outlined an LM test that evaluates the constant correlation model against the alternative of the DCC dynamic structure. This computationally convenient test examines the restrictions imposed on a model which encompasses the CCC model. We do not pursue the test in our paper because it is based on the normality assumption. 21 The size of the conditional correlations provides credence to the notion that Chinese financial markets remain partially de-linked due to the absense of full currency convertibility. Further insights can be gained by allowing the correlation matrix to vary over time. As is evident from Fig. 4 , in all cases NDF market return correlations exhibit significant variation, ranging between a maximum of 0.8 and a minimum of -0.4, and have a number of spikes. Apart from a handful of negative values, each of the graphs in Fig. 4 displays conditional correlations of the returns with China, which are all positive. Moreover, the observed correlation coefficients display three distinct changes of pattern over the given time span. At the beginning of the sample period, the correlation coefficients of each of the countries display a sudden drop followed by a sharp increase between January and September 1998. The magnitude of such shifts appeared to be particularly relevant for Hong Kong, Indonesia and Singapore, but this evidence is common to all the countries studied. The Asian crisis, in fact, began in Thailand in the late spring of 1997 with substantial speculative attacks on the local currency, and continued with its floatation in summer 1997. Speculators also attacked the Indonesian and Korean currencies. Thus, there is strong evidence that during periods of stress and high volatility both the magnitude and persistence of comovements increased significantly. 22 Evidence of the second pattern change in conditional correlations between all markets and China is found prior to the regime change in July 2005, when the coefficients trended upwards. Despite this, the timing and magnitudes of the increases differ noticeably from country to country. In the case of Hong Kong and Singapore, the rise in correlation with China occurred at the end of 2003, coinciding with appreciation of the Hong Kong dollar in autumn 2003. 23 Hong Kong's correlation coefficient subsequently increased from near 0 to more than 0.4 in March 2005, while the corresponding figure for Singapore rose to approximately 0.3 over the same period. The bivariate conditional correlations between Malaysia, Philippines and Taiwan have remained relatively stable over the sample period. Malaysia has continued to manage its exchange rate in an active manner since September 2, 1998, when the Malaysian authorities quite openly fixed their bilateral USD exchange rate, and have defended this parity through sterilized foreign exchange market interventions. This exchange rate policy is reflected in the drop in correlation with China after the Malaysian Central Bank's announcement, followed by stabilization of the coefficient at values close to 0. In contrast to this, both the Philippine Peso and Taiwan Dollar were floated, on March 15, 1998 and April 3, 1989 respectively, and display relatively strong interdependence with China over the whole sample. In particular, the daily correlations fluctuate around 0.22 in the case of Philippines and around 0.31 in the case of Taiwan. It would appear that the correlation structure of those countries with respect to China has not changed significantly since adoption of a flexible exchange rate regime. Finally, after the Chinese exchange rate regime change in July 2005, the time-varying conditional correlations of some countries show a distinct drop. This change appears to be particularly relevant for Hong Kong. While the RMB was delinked from the USD, Hong Kong has continued its currency board system which is designed to respond automatically to fund flows in and out of Hong Kong and maintain a stable exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the USD. Thus far, our analysis must be accompanied by one important caveat: the discussion has focussed on estimation of time-varying comovements across countries, while abstracting from the economic forces that may bring about these volatility spillovers. This raises a number of valid questions which must now be tackled: What are the factors that cause such co-movements? Are they regional in nature or can they be traced to specific developments in individual countries? These issues are discussed in the next section.
