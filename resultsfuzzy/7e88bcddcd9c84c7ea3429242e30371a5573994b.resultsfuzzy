Figs. 10 and 11 show the paths of aggregate visits and respiratory visits under the counterfactuals described above. The simulation isolates respiratory visits because Fig. 5 and Table 5 indicate that respiratory visits contribute substantially to the overall decline in visits. In each figure, we calculate the ratio of aggregate visits by period under Counterfactuals 1-3 to aggregate visits under Counterfactual 4. The solid black line presents average visits by non-movers per period from our first counterfactual in which non-movers experience peer effects. The dashed line shows the result for the second counterfactual, which excludes the response to peer effects. The difference between this line and the solid line represents the contribution of peer effects to the overall response. Finally the dotted line shows the response under the third counterfactual, which only includes the response to public information. The difference between the dotted line and the dashed line represents the response to unobservable peer group shocks. Our simulation of visits for all diagnoses suggests that SARS incidence (public information) was the sole driver of the initial, sharp decline in visits. Peer group shocks and peer effects prolonged the decline beyond the peak in SARS incidence. By Period 13 (just after visits reach their nadir), unobservable shocks and peer effects account for nearly half of the continued suppression in visits. 25 By the end of the epidemic in Period 16, visits remained almost 20% below normal and peer effects account for roughly one-third of all visit suppression. 26 We find qualitatively similar results for respiratory visits in Fig. 11 .
