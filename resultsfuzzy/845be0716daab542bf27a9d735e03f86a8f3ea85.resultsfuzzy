Results are shown in Figures 1 and 2 for a representative RNA assay (influenza matrix) and DNA assay (EHV-1) with a combination of positive controls and clinical samples submitted for routine diagnostic testing. The fluorescence signals emitted throughout this typical reaction are shown in Figure 1 , which plots raw fluorescence values per cycle. All relative cycle threshold (Ct) values were automatically generated by the amplification machine software. Background fluorescence was used as a separate metric for assessment of loading quality rather than incorporating it into the fluorescence readings prior to calculating Ct values. The analytical limit of detection (LOD) for each target was calculated based on the overall mean of the Ct values at the 95% detection level plus 2 standard deviations in a pool of controls for all targets. The highest dilution where at least 95% of the replicates were positive for the representative assays was 50 copies; detection of 5 copies was successful in 50% of replicates. Neither assay was detected at below one copy. The LODs for the RNA and DNA assay were calculated at Ct values of 21.92 and 20.05. These values were considered to be the cutoffs for reporting values as positive vs. suspect (potentially not repeatable). Other aspects of analytic performance of the targets was assessed using serial dilutions of pooled positive controls run on three different days (Figure 2) . The average efficiencies of the representative RNA and DNA assays were 101.1% and 106.6%; the overall mean efficiency for all targets was 101.3%. The assays also had good linearity (R 2 >0.98). Variation within replicate through-holes typically was within standard deviations of 0.2 for both clinical samples and controls. No cross-reactivity between any of the targets was observed. The Final Results worksheet in the supplemental file shows representative quantitative results for 10 clinical diagnostic samples and 4 controls. The clinical samples are a subset of the types of samples routinely tested including nasal/oropharyngeal swabs, lung tissue, and fecal samples. One (equine) fecal sample in this set shows a failed MS2 internal control, which indicates the presence of inhibitors in the sample. This is typically managed by dilution of the eluted sample and/or re-extraction. As is the case here, the negative amplification control should be negative for all targets, and the negative extraction control should only contain the internal control. In the clinical set, samples produced Ct values for betacoronavirus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine distemper virus A, canine parainfluenza virus, canine pneumovirus, and influenza A. Table 1 . Schematic of the amplification plate and target locations. The plates used for nanoscale real-time PCR testing on this platform are microscope slide-sized and are arranged in 48 subarrays of 64 through-holes, with a total of 3,072 through-holes for individual reactions. One subarray is shown here, with 18 targets in triplicate. Each sample is added to one subarray by the liquid handler. Plates are coated with hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds to retain reagents in through-holes via surface tension. The stainless steel chip is "photolithographically patterned and wet-etched to form a rectilinear array of 3,072 micro-machined, 320 Âµm diameter holes of 33 nl each" Table 2 . Plate transfer map. A color-coded plate transfer map for using a fixed 8-channel pipette to transfer from the 96-well preamp plate to the 384-well plate is shown. Alternately, an adjustable pipette may be used. The same procedure is performed each time regardless of how many samples are in the plate.
