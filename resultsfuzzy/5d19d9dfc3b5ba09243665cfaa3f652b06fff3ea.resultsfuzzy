First, we look at the variance equation in Table 1 . In the variance equations of both models, all the signs are consistent with our expectations. Coefficients on the asymmetric terms in the variance equations are negative and strongly significant at the 1% level for various specifications, implying that negative shocks tend to cause higher volatility than positive shocks. This result is consistent with the studies of Nelson (1990) , Engle and Ng (1993) , Glosten et al. (1993) , and other empirical asymmetric GARCH studies. Second, in the skewness equations of both models in Table 1 , the coefficients are generally significant at the 5% level, indicating that conditional skewness is time-varying, which is consistent with the findings of Harvey and Siddique (1999) , Jondeau and Rockinger (2003) , Brooks et al. (2005) , Leon et al. (2005) , and Lanne and Saikkonen (2007) . The coefficients on t 1 in the skewness equations of both models are positive, implying that good news has a positive impact and bad news has a negative impact on the skewness of the returns. This shows that our asymmetric terms in the variance equations and skewness equations are consistent with each other. The asymmetric terms in the variance equations tell us that the distribution of the returns is negatively skewed for the estimation period, whereas the asymmetric terms in the skewness equations tell us that today's returns are more negatively skewed when the market receives bad news on the previous day. Third, in the skewness factors equation of Table 1 , the coefficients on DTO t Crisis t , I and DSI t Crisis t , I are negative and strongly significant for various specifications in both models, indicating that both turnover and market short interest have a statistically significant power in predicting conditional skewness during the two crisis periods. Specifically, during the two crisis periods, negative conditional skewness is more pronounced when people disagree about the market more or the short sale constraints are increasingly binding. However, heterogeneous beliefs and short sale restrictions do not seem important to the determination of market conditional skewness during market growth since the coefficients on DTO t and DSI t in our baseline specifications, specification (1) for the SN-GJR-GARCH model and specification (4) for the SN-Q-GARCH model, respectively, are not statistically significant. In other words, our results indicate that the short sale constraints and differences in opinions contributed to negative asymmetries during the two crisis periods but did not do so during the periods of market growth. These results confirmed our prediction, since the Hong and Stein (2003) theory of rational bubbles predicts negative asymmetries if and only if the bubble bursts and the market enters a downward adjustment period. Note that in specifications (3) and (6), when we omit the crisis indicator and its related terms, heterogeneous Fourth, we decompose the skewness equation in our baseline specifications, i.e., specification (1) for the SN-GJR-GARCH model and specification (4) for the SN-Q-GARCH model in Table 1 , into two parts: where part I is defined as and part II is defined as The first part of the skewness equation s t viewed conditional skewness as analogous to heteroskedasticity and modeled conditional skewness as a function of lagged skewness and shocks. Under the specification s t is stable over time and thus, the instability of the conditional skewness is brought to us by S t . Fig. 10 plot the conditional skewness decomposition for the SN-GJR-GARCH and SN-Q-GARCH model. It shows us how the skewness factors bring instability to conditional skewness. First, the skewness factors contribute more negative skewness during the crisis periods. Second, conditional skewness clearly does not mean reverting during the crisis periods. Last, we compare the robust conditional skewness measure proposed by Ghysels et al. (2011 Ghysels et al. ( , 2016 in Fig. 9 with the conditional skewness estimated by the SN-GJR-GARCH and SN-Q-GARCH model (i.e., specification (1) and (4) in Table 1 respectively). The comparison is shown in Fig. 11 . From the figure, we can see that both measures predict less negative (i.e., more positive) asymmetries during the bubble phase and, thus, give us additional evidence to support our modified theory. Table 2 shows the estimation results of the SN-GJR-GARCH and SN-Q-GARCH models with different market direction indicators. As mentioned in the previous section, the crisis indicator is somewhat arbitrary; therefore, as a robustness check, we also test the yearly, quarterly, and weekly market direction indicators. As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the yearly market indicator spots similar turning points in the market, whereas the quarterly market indicator spots more frequent changes in the market direction than the crisis indicator. The crisis and yearly indicators help us test how conditional skewness responds to the general market decline for a relatively long period of time. The quarterly market indicator, which can be seen in Fig. 6 , helps us test how conditional skewness responds to more frequent changes in the market direction, and the weekly market direction indicator, which can be seen in Fig. 7 , helps us test how conditional skewness responds to short-term changes in the market direction. The estimation results are presented in Table 2 . All coefficients on "DTO t I and "DSI t I" are negative and strongly significant when the yearly and quarterly market indicators are used. However, we find that market turnover has only mild statistical power in forecasting conditional skewness, while market short interest is not important in determining the skewness of market return even during periods of general market declines when the weekly market direction indicator is used. This result may imply that the degree of heterogeneous beliefs and short sale restrictions in the market has an effect on conditional skewness when the downward trend in the market persists for more than a week. It is also possible that the weekly market direction indicator that we have used to obtain the above results may be a noisy proxy for indicating real changes in the market direction. Finally, in Table 3 , we test the effect of past returns on conditional skewness by including cumulative returns in our model. Both Hong and Stein (2003) and Hueng and McDonald (2005) found that past returns as far back as 36 months are negatively related to conditional skewness. Therefore, following Hueng and McDonald (2005) and Hong and Stein (2003) , we define cumulative returns as , where R t is the simple return between times + t 1 andt . For t < 750, we set Ï„ as the number Standard errors in parentheses. *p < 0.10, **p < 0.05, ***p < 0.01. of maximum possible days that we can use. We drop the first five observations such that our shortest cumulation period is five days. Fig. 12 plots cumulative returns (RET t ) against time. For each specification, we estimate the SN-GJR-GARCH and SN-Q-GARCH models with RET t as additional skewness factors measured in percentage. Table 3 presents the estimation results. We find that past returns have no predictive power on conditional skewness when skewness factors are included. However, when we omit the skewness factors, the coefficients on the cumulative return are negative and strongly significant. This result is similar to the results shown in Hong and Stein (2003) and Hueng and McDonald (2005) .
