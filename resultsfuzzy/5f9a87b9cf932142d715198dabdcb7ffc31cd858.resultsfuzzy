This section provides the empirical results of forecasting the monthly visitor arrivals by air transport for New Zealand's eight key tourist source markets. As mentioned in Section 4, the SARIMAX/(E)GARCH model has two components: the Box-Jenkins SARIMAX model and the (E)GARCH volatility model. In using the SARIMAX/(E)GARCH volatility model for modelling the monthly visitor arrivals by air transport from New Zealand's eight key tourist source markets, all of the time series for visitor arrivals by air transport need to be stationary. Fig. 2 shows that visitor arrivals by air transport from all tourist source markets are relatively volatile. Table 4 also shows the estimation results of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root tests and indicates that all the time series of visitor arrivals by air transport are non-stationary, except for South Korea. After we applied first-order differencing, all of the time series became stationary at above the 0.05 significance level. Furthermore, the estimation results of the Hylleberg, Engle, Granger and Yoo (HEGY) seasonal unit root tests are shown in Table 5 , which also verified that all of the time series are seasonally stationary. The SARIMAX models for New Zealand's key tourist source markets were determined by the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the lowest Schwarz information criterion (SIC) values. In addition, the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) diagnostic correlograms as well as the Ljung-Box Q-statistics proved that the residual series of all of the time series in the SARIMAX model have 'white noise' characteristics. Table 6 shows the estimation results of the SARIMAX/(E)GARCH volatility models for New Zealand's eight key tourist source markets. All the volatility models provided accurate and reliable forecasting performance with lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values. In particular, the MAPE values for all countries are below 3.61%, and thus the forecasting performance accuracy of the SARIMAX/(E)GARCH volatility models is considered to be highly accurate according to the criteria set by findings of Lewis (1982) . A primary interest of this study is to establish accurate forecasting models for modelling and forecasting the monthly visitor arrivals by air transport from New Zealand's eight key tourist source markets. The adjusted-R 2 (Adj-R 2 ) values are high for most tourist source markets, indicating a good fit; however, the lower Adj-R 2 value for China might suggest that other factors are driving and affecting Chinese visitor arrivals by air transport to New Zealand.
