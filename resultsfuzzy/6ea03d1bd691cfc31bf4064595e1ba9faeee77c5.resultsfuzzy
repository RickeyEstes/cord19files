The extra-cellular domain of the NiV G gene was cloned downstream of a T7 promoter in the pRSET vector system, which allows the expression proteins via transcription by T7 polymerase. NiV G gene was expressed as a protein attached at its amino-terminus to a polyhistidine peptide. As shown in Fig. 1A , an extra protein band with the expected M r of approximately 57 kDa appeared in the insoluble fraction of the extract of bacteria containing the recombinant plasmid and was absent in the corresponding fraction of bacteria containing the vector without an insert. The time course study showed that the highest level of expression could be achieved after 5 h post induction (data not shown). An immunoreactive band of approximately 57 kDa was detected by the pooled anti-NiV sera on a Western blot (Fig. 1B) , confirming the expression of the recombinant G protein. The inclusion bodies, which were extracted from bacterial cells using B-PER reagent, were washed several times with the same reagent to remove most of the contaminants. Two reasonably pure protein bands of approximately 57 and 47 kDa were observed in a polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie blue (Fig. 1A) . The lower band was detected with swine anti-Nipah sera but not with anti-His (data not shown), indicating that it could be either a bacterial protein or His-tag deleted proteolytic product derived from the recombinant protein. The extracted inclusion bodies were (1) Cells containing the vector without an insert, (2) recombinant G before purification, (3) purified inclusion bodies, (4) purified by affinity chromatography. (B) Western blot of the above samples using swine anti-NiV sera. The same number of the bacterial cells was used for the first two lanes. solubilized in 6 M guanidine HCl containing buffer and directly purified on Ni-NTA matrix under denaturing conditions. Subsequently, the urea was gradually eliminated from the purified protein by dialysis and the protein renatured again. The concentration of the purified recombinant G protein from the total bacterial cell proteins was estimated to be approximately 0.01-0.03 mg g âˆ’1 of the wet weight of bacterial cells. Light scattering of the purified protein showed monodispersity with a hydrodynamic radius (R h ) of 14 nm, whereas the inclusion bodies were found to be polydispersed, and polymodal regression analysis in- dicated 98% of one species with R h 200 nm and 2% of the another species with R h 1700 nm. In order to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the recombinant G protein as antigen for detecting antibodies in NiV positive swine sera a quantitive immunoassay was carried out. A total of 20 NiV positive sera and 5 negative sera from healthy swine were tested, and the results showed that the purified G protein reacted specifically with antibodies in NiV positive samples (Fig. 2) . This reflects the reliability of the purification procedure in eliminating bacterial contaminants from the G protein. Inactivated NiV is currently being used as a coating antigen in ELISA for detection of the anti-NiV antibodies in serum samples. The process of growing the virus in cell cultures, however, requires BL4 laboratories. In addition, the use of NiV is restricted in certain countries due to biosecurity considerations. Therefore, an ELISA based on a recombinant protein, as capturing antigen, is simpler to produce and perform than ELISA based on inactivated virus. The latter is hazardous and not suitable for large-scale surveys. In order to assess the suitability of the G protein as an ELISA antigen for the detection of specific anti-NiV antibodies, a recombinant pRSET vector was constructed, which could be used to express the recombinant G protein in E. coli BL21 SI. Production of such recombinant proteins in E. coli as capturing antigens for diagnosis of diseases caused by viruses have been widely used including turkey coronavirus (Loa et al., 2004) , Marburg virus (Saijo et al., 2001) , Norwalklike virus (Yoda et al., 2000) , measles virus (Warnes et al., 1995) , African fever swine virus (Freije et al., 1993) , Lassa virus (Barber et al., 1987) , and hepatitis B virus (Stahl et al., 1982) . Furthermore, the advantages of using a prokaryotic host to produce recombinant G protein would be considerable due to the ease of scale-up, and the low costs involved in growing bacteria. A strong specific signal was observed in Western blots confirming the specific immunoreactivity of the recombinant G protein. The results of the Western blot analysis and ELISA test suggest that the recombinant G protein exhibits the antigenic epitopes and conformation necessary for specific antigen-antibody recognition. The inclusion bodies before purification showed negligibly low background on Western blot but when used as the coating antigen in ELISA, a relatively high background was observed. This was probably either due to the presence of bacterial protein (s) and/or existence of some antibodies recognizing conformational epitopes in ELISA. The results of the light scattering also confirmed the impurity of the inclusion body sample and monodispersity of the purified recombinant protein. Based on the molecular mass of the recombinant G protein (57 kDa) and the assumption that it is spherical form, the calculated radius of the protein is about 3.4 whereas the R h of the purified protein detected by DLS was about 14 nm. This implies that the protein most probably exists in multimer forms (trimer or tetramer). In order to ensure a more consistent binding pattern of the coated antigen to the ELISA plate and to avoid the high background, it was decided to use affinitypurified recombinant G protein as the coating antigen. The validation of the recombinant G protein ELISA was carried out using 25 samples of swine sera. The aim was to determine the variability of negative and positive sera using ELISA based on recombinant G protein. The newly established assay was able to distinguish clearly the two groups of samples based on their reactivity. However, the result of the ELISA should be interpreted cautiously, since proper standardization of the ELISA requires sera from experimentally infected animals followed by testing a more significant number of field serum samples. Unfortunately, it was not possible to obtain sera from experimentally infected animal sera due to lack of the BL4 laboratory throughout this study and also to the limited availability of the field sera.
