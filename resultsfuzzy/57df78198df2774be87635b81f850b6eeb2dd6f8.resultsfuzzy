We anticipated finding a wide variety of indices covering diverse outcome measures and therefore planned to summarise these narratively. Because of the range of outcomes included we did not expect to be able to perform metaanalysis. We listed performance and validity statistics as reported by the original papers or validation studies alongside each other, for comparison. We did not expect to find indices specifically designed for measuring physical multimorbidity in relation to any aspect of mental health. Therefore, for separate narrative synthesis we planned to seek those indices that mentioned mental illnesses or symptoms, either as comorbidities or as outcomes.
