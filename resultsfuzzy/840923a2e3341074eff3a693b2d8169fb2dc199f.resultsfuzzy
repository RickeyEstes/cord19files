Among the 254 patients, 49% were classified as definite CAP, 7% as probable, 11% as possible and 33% were excluded by the adjudication committee (Table 3) . Although the PCR findings were not different according to the diagnosis probability, among the 125 patients with definite CAP, 44 (35%) had positive PCR results and 81 (65%) were PCR negative. Among the 83 patients with excluded CAP, 21 (25%) were PCR positive. The probability of PCR detection of rhinoviruses was significantly higher in excluded CAP than in the other three groups combined (10/21 (48%) versus 10/57 (18%), respectively, p 0.01), whereas there was no difference in detection of influenza viruses (9/21 (43%) versus 18/57 (32%), respectively). Referring to the category of diagnosis, the sensitivity and specificity of multiplex PCR were 35% and 74%, and the positive and negative predictive values were 56% and 54%, respectively.
