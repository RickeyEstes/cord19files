We investigated how long it took for the blood EBOV to turn negative in the surviving patients. All 146 survivors were followed up from the time of diagnosis (when blood EBOV was first detected) to the time of recovery. The median time for a surviving EVD patient to become blood EBOV negative was 20.31 Â± 7.62 days, and the range was from 7 days to 49 days. Of the total number of survivors observed, 63.69 % (93 cases) turned negative for blood EBOV within 3 weeks after the diagnosis, and 87.67 % (128 cases) turned negative 4 weeks after the diagnosis (Fig. 1 ).
