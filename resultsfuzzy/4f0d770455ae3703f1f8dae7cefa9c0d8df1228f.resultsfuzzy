Comparison of the 1D-FTIR spectra Fig. 1 showed the overall pattern of both spectra which indicated the basis absorption of mid infrared for the raw material of I. indigotica. The spectra were compared with those in the report on ''The Compilation of 2D-IR Chinese Herbal Medicines'' [14] . Both the spectra showed two strong peaks at 2925 cm À1 and 2854 cm À1 respectively which were assigned to methylene (CH 2 ) in their asymmetric and symmetric stretch vibration absorption for alkaloids, steroids and triterpenoids plant content [15] . Most of the peaks bound together and overlaid but the characteristic peaks were clearly visible in the range of 1800 cm À1 to 500 cm À1 . Hence, the interpretation have to be based on raw material. There are 5 major peaks with two strong peaks achieving absorbance >0.3 and accompanied by a few peaks which could be combined. The peak at 1745 cm À1 on both spectra exhibited similar intensity for the content of aldehydes, ketones and carbonyl stretching vibration. On the other hand, peak at 1656 cm À1 on both spectra was considered as the absorption of OAH bond bending vibration, C@O stretching vibration of flavonoids and NH þ 3 of amino acids. Not much differences of the two spectra was found except the peaks in the range of 1500-1200 cm À1 which was about 7 cm À1 different within both spectra (1435.96-1429.15 cm À1 and 1265.53-1258.34 cm À1 ), indicating the absorption could be initialed from different bonds. The region between 1429.15 cm À1 and 1265.53 cm À1 in SP4 spectrum was closer, whereby region between 1435.96 cm À1 and 1268.34 cm À1 expanded wider in C4 spectrum. The peaks around 1429 cm À1 and 1435 cm À1 were attributed to CAH bond bending in methylene as well as OAH bond in-plane bending vibration from flavonoids and amide peak. In addition, peaks around 1265 cm À1 and 1258 cm À1 were attributed to C@O bond of flavonoids, steroidal and triterpenes. In the range of 1200-1020 cm À1 , the absorption peaks were considered strong and most of them were attributed to organic anhydrides, ethers, sugars as CAO bond of glycosides and CAN bond of amine. Comparison of second derivative spectra Fig. 2 showed the second derivative spectra of SP4 and the control C4. The important regions were shown in the highlighted boxes. The overall picture showed peaks in the spectrum of SP4 were sharper in the two highlighted zones, especially the peak at 1747 cm À1 which showed stronger than that at 1745 cm À1 of C4 in intensity. The region around 1500 cm À1 had double peaks at around 1544 cm À1 in C4 but a single peak at 1537 cm À1 in SP4. This scenario occurred oppositely for the single peak at 1512 cm À1 in C4 and double peaks around 1516 cm À1 in SP4. Fig. 6 . Synchronous 2D-FTIR correlation spectra of SP4 and C4 in the region of 1400-800 cm À1 . Fig. 3 continued the description on the second derivative in the range of 1200-800 cm À1 which consequently played the crucial role of the fingerprint of these samples. The figure was conveniently divided into 3 regions for discussion. First region was observed the peak at 1188 cm À1 in SP4 which disappeared in C4. The peak at 1166 cm À1 in SP4 might be assigned similar absorption with the peak at 1162 cm À1 in C4. The similarity of this region in these two spectra also included derivative in the peak at 1108 cm À1 ; peaks at 1105 cm À1 and 1079 cm À1 of C4 was derived from the peak at 1108 cm À1 in the first derivative spectrum. Both were separated by 26 cm À1 . However, peaks at 1111 cm À1 and 1076 cm À1 in SP4 were separated by 35 cm À1 . SP4 showed different pattern of derivative to C4. As mentioned earlier, the absorption in the range of 1200-1020 cm À1 is attributed for organic anhydrides, ethers and sugars. A report for determination of salylic acid, syringic acid, benzoic acid and anthranilic acid in Radix Isatidis by Wang et al. [16] showed a similar evidence. The derivative from the peaks from 1057 cm À1 to 984 cm À1 in C4 showed slight changes and the peak at 984 cm À1 obviously sharper in SP4. Most of the peaks in the third region of C4 were not as sharp as in those of SP4. Fig. 4 showed the second derivative spectra in the range of 800-400 cm À1 . The lower wavenumber of this range below 500 cm À1 showed fewer big and sharp peaks due to the possibility of noise. The region focused on around 600 cm À1 as the huge peak was specifically located in this region on 1D spectra. The small peaks in the highlighted area could be differentiated by the pattern of absorption in C4 and they are considered constantly low and steady. While in SP4, the scenario changed as the peaks fluctuated. However, most of the peaks showed weak intensity. The peak at 666 cm À1 in SP4 was about twice as high as that at 667 cm À1 in C4. Nakanishi and Solomon [17] reported that the wavelength of absorption in the 700-600 cm À1 referred to the bending of CAH where its overtone may appear around 1250 cm À1 . Compared with 1256 cm À1 in the spectrum of C4 and SP4, diagnostic value is limited.
