There were 205 farms tested for IBV, from which 117 broiler and 13 layer farms were positive. Fayom, Ismailia and Benisuif governorates had the highest number of positives. However, Port-Said, North Sinai, Cairo and Aswan were tested negative for IBV using real-time RT-PCR. The positive percent of the IBV in broiler were higher than layer farms as it reached up to 65.4% in broilers while it was 50% in layer farms. As shown in Table 2 . The allantoic fluids were collected and tested for confirmation of IBV by RT-PCR and they were positive as indicated in Fig. 2 , where the 13 selected isolates showed specific 400 bp of SP1 gene.
