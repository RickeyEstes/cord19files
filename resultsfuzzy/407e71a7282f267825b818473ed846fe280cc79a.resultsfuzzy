Figs. 2 and 3 show the predicted steady state averaged velocity contour at the mid-plane of section Y-Z and at the plane crossing the manikin closer to the air inlet respectively. A cooled-jet can be easily identified near the low-level of the floor and a strong vertical buoyancy-plume is formed above the heated manikin. One key feature of displacement ventilations is the low inlet velocity. As the cold air flows around the manikin and picks up the heat, the velocity increases rapidly. It is noticed that the low momentum cooled air (0.2 m/s) near the floor level absorbs heat from the two occupants and creates a dominant vertical thermal plume in the boundary layer around each occupant. The airflow velocity is fairly weak in all regions except inside the buoyancy plume [35] and the bulk velocity is less than 0.1 m/s. This low velocity will influence significantly the convective transport of aerosol. Fig. 4 shows the predicted averaged temperature contour along the mid-plane of Y-Z direction. This shows you a clearer picture on how the temperature varied from the cooled-inlet to the exhaust. Fig. 5 shows an instantaneous velocity at the same plane. Two similar but unequal strengths of vertical plumes can be observed. Inferring carefully from both figures, it can be seem that the buoyancy plume of the heated manikin near the inlet is warmer and stronger than another one. It is due to the coolest air contacting that heated manikin while the air contacting the other manikin has been warmed. It is not straightforward to compare the experimental data with those modeling results directly. The particle counter output is number (or mass) concentration expressed in particle number (mass) per cm 3 . The native output for the Eulerian and Lagrangian models are concentration or dimensionless concentration. To compare with both Eulerian and Lagrangian modeling results, the (concentration) data obtained by the counter was transformed to a dimensionless concentration and is defined as where C(x, t) is the temporal concentration at the measuring point x and C Vol ðt ¼ 0Þ is the initial volume-averaged concentration for the entire chamber. It was evaluated by calculating the particle injected during the emission period (0.1 s) and divided by the volume of the chamber. Figs. 6-8 show the experimental measured steady state airflow pattern and temperature distribution prior to the emission of aerosols. The results were compared with those predicted by the LES. All the results were measured at mid-plane along Y-Z. The velocity profile along the centerline of the inlet duct (i.e. Y ¼ 0.075 m) is shown in Fig. 6 . Excellent agreement between the modeling and experiment can be observed. Due to the very low velocity and the sensitivity of the velocity probe used, there was no measurement data for Z greater than 0.6 m. It is interesting to note that a small recirculation zone is existed at Z ¼ 0.7-0.75 m. Fig. 7 shows the temperature measurement along a central vertical line (i.e. Y from 0 to 0.5 m). The computational prediction experimental data consistently overestimates the measured temperature for most of the locations. It is interesting to notice that the discrepancy decreases with the Y-direction. The simulated results were fluctuated temperature while the experimental results were averaged value. Besides, the discrepancy may also be attributed to the uncertainty of the thermocouples. Fig. 8 depicts the temperature profile along the Z-direction at the vertical height of the spray gun. Since the separation of the two manikins was less than 0.2 m, seven thermocouples were placed. It can be seen that the measurements and modeling results agree well as it shows the increasing trend when it approaches the heated manikin. Concentration evolutions were measured in three streamwise locations for two different transverse points. Figs. 9-12 show the experimental results for four locations and the results are compared with the two modeling predictions. The x-axis is the elapsed time after the aerosol emission and the y-axis is the dimensionless concentration. It should be noted that unlike Reynolds averaging methods LES gives instantaneous concentrations of particles that are convected by a turbulent flow. All the reported results were measured downstream of the emission point. Hence it can be anticipated that the concentration will decay with elapsed time. Regardless of the modeling approaches or experimental results, first three figures show clear decay profiles. For Fig. 12 where the location is at the exhaust, the result is more complex as both Lagrangian and experimental results depict non-decay profiles. It can be seen that the variation of the experimental measurement at point F is very small which is ranging from 0.01% to 0.07%. Further investigation is required to explain the observation. It is also interested to compare the ''decay'' rate for different locations as the decay magnitude should be correlated to the ''local'' air velocity. This issue will be addressed in future work. The experimental results were best fitted by an exponential function using the least square method and the corresponding decay rates are shown (Figs. 9 and 10). Inferring from the results Figs. 9 and 10, the decay rates are comparable to each. By taking into account of the uncertainly of the particle counter used which is AE12%, the agreement between the experimental results and the computational modeling predictions is acceptable [36] . In this work observable discrepancy between the modeling results by Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches is seen. More experimental results are required to validate the accuracy of the model.
