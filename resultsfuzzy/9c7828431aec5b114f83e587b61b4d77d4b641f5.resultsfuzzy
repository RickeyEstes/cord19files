Upon inoculation, both vFL12-and parental virus-inoculated groups developed symptoms of PRRS similar to those typically described when young pigs are inoculated with a virulent strain of PRRSV (Rossow et al., 1995) . These symptoms were expressed in our experiment by lethargy, lack of appetite, roughness of hair coat, occasional sneezing, some coughing, and some diarrhea most of which started within 48 h postinoculation. The intensity and duration of the symptoms seemed to correlate closely with the kinetics of the development and the intensity of hyperthermia (Fig. 5A) . The vFL12-inoculated group exhibited a hyperthermic peak that was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the temperature baseline in the sham-inoculated control group, specifically from days 3 to 6 postinoculation. Interestingly, in the parental virus-inoculated group, which also developed some degree of hyperthermia, the thermal peak was less promi-nent, modestly rising above the normal temperature curve registered for the sham-inoculated group. The symptoms exhibited by the vFL12-inoculated group were the more prominent of the two groups as observed by the amount of food left unconsumed or the degree of alertness of the animals. In addition, the higher severity of the disease observed in the vFL12-inoculated group was further evidenced by the fact that one of the animals died of typical secondary complications to PRRSV infection at 23 dpi. A necropsy and diagnostic workup on this animal showed immunohistochemical detection of PRRSV in several tissues and histopathological lesions suggestive of colonization by Streptococcus suis or Salmonella. Infectious vFL12 was isolated from multiple tissues, including lymph nodes, lung, spleen, and kidney. The parental virus-inoculated group exhibited milder symptoms of infection although the shaminoculated control group remained healthy during the study period. Based on the time points postinoculation that we used to follow the viremia profile, it can be inferred that the peak of infectious PRRSV titer in blood must have occurred during the first week postinoculation, with an ensuing sustained and slow decay afterwards, which is typical of infection with virulent strains of PRRSV (Fig. 5B ) (Yoon et al., 1996) . By the end of the observation period at 22 days postinoculation, a detectable viremia, a titer above the 10 1.5 TCID 50 /ml detection threshold of the assay, was still evident in two of the animals of the vFL12-inoculated group and in three animals of the parental virus-inoculated groups. Further evidence of in vivo replication was obtained by analysis of the PRRSV specific seroconversion, as indicated by the curve of S/P ratios from the commercial Idexx ELISA kit. Although both antibody curves (Fig. 5C ) indicate occurrence of a robust PRRSV replication, it should be noted that the response in clone inoculated group was significantly higher (P < 0.05).
