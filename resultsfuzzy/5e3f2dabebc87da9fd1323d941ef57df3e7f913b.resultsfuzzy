Hsp27 deletion mutants were used to determine the region of the heat shock protein that interacts with eIF4E ( Figure 1a) . The results showed that eIF4E interacts only with the Hsp27 C1 mutant, while protein/protein interaction was inhibited when Hsp27 was truncated in its C-terminal part (N1 and N2 mutants) (Figures 1b-1c ). To evaluate how the Hsp27/eIF4E interaction is involved in chemo-resistance, cells were transfected with the Hsp27 deletion mutants prior to docetaxel treatment in combination with androgen deprivation in rat colon carcinoma cancer cell line (REG) cells that have no endogeneous expression of Hsp27. The analysis of cells viability showed that cells sensitivity to chemotherapy (docetaxel) and androgen withdrawal (serum free media) increased in the presence of the N1 and N2 mutants ( Figure 1d ). Thus, our data confirmed that loss of Hsp27/ eIF4E interaction via truncation of Hsp27 C-terminal region restores chemo-and hormone-sensitivity in cancer cells. To evaluate the effects of Hsp27 phosphorylation on its interaction with eIF4E Hsp27 mutants corresponding to constitutively unphosphorylated (3A) or phosphorylated (3D) forms were used (Figure 1e) . The results showed that N1 and N2 correspond to two different variants of the N-terminal region of Hsp27 protein (residues 1-93, and 1-173, respectively), whereas mutant C1 corresponds to the Hsp27 C-terminal region, containing the last 113 protein residues (residues 93-205). The fulllength WT Hsp27 sequence was used as control. No endogenous Hsp27 expression REG cells transiently transfected or not (NT) with plasmids containing WT Hsp27 and N1, N2 and C1 and proteins were extracted for: (b) Western Blot analysis of histidine and vinculin protein levels from total cell lysates (TCL) and (c) Western Blot analysis of histidine and eIF4E protein levels after immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-eIF4E antibody (d) MTT quantification of REG cells viability. (e) Schematic representation of Hsp27 wild type (WT) and phosphorylation mutants of Hsp27 (3A and 3D) used in this study. In the former case, the 3A mutant of Hsp27 was specifically constructed by replacing the serine residues 15, 78 and 82 with alanine; concomitantly, the 3D Hsp27 isoforms was obtained by replacing the same serine residues with aspartic acid. (f) Western Blot analysis of histidine and vinculin protein levels from total cell lysates (TCL) and (g) Western Blot analysis of histidine and eIF4E protein levels after immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-eIF4E antibody. (h) MTT quantification of REG cells viability was performed on cells transiently transfected with plasmids containing WT Hsp27 and phosphorylation mutants of Hsp27 prior to treatment with docetaxel in serum-free media (a condition mimicking androgen deprivation) *** P≤0.001. (i) Overall view of an equilibrated MD snapshot of the Hsp27 WT/eIF4E complex. The proteins are visualized by their van der Waals surfaces, colored as follow: Hsp27 WT, firebrick; eIF4E, khaki. The amino acids of Hsp27 mainly involved in binding eIF4E are highlighted as follows: purple, residues belonging to the WDPF domain; green, residues belonging to the flexible domain. See text for details. (j) Per residue enthalpic contribution to WT Hsp27 binding with eIF4E. Only those Hsp27 amino acids affording a meaningful contribution to protein-protein formation contributing (ΔH bind,res < -0.80 kcal/mol) are shown for clarity. From this analysis, it further appears that the Hsp27 α-crystallin domain is practically ineffective in Hsp27/eIF4E binding since residues belonging to this Hsp27 region display a negligible contribution to protein-protein binding enthalpy. (k) Overall view of equilibrated MD snapshots of the eIF4E in complex with Hsp27 N1, N2 and C1 truncated mutant isoforms. In each panel, the proteins are visualized by their van der Waals surfaces, colored as follows: Hsp27s, firebrick; eIF4E, khaki. The amino acids of Hsp27 mainly involved in binding eIF4E are highlighted as follows: purple, residues belonging to the WDPF domain; green, residues belonging to the flexible domain. Interestingly, the overall structure of Hsp27 N1 is de facto strongly affected by the loss of the α-crystallin domain, which plays a major role in the overall correct chaperon folding required for effective binding to eIF4E. the interaction of eIF4E with the phosphorylated form of Hsp27 (3D mutant) was similar to the one observed with the WT protein, while partial inhibition of the interaction was found with the unphosphorylated form (3A mutant) (Figure 1f-1g) showing that phosphorylation regulates the interaction. To understand the implication of Hsp27 phosphorylation on cell drug resistance, transfected cells were treated with docetaxel in serum free media. The analysis of cell viability showed that the unphosphorylated 3A mutant of Hsp27 restored sensitivity to cell death driven by docetaxel and androgen withdrawal, while no effect on cell viability was observed in the case of the constitutively phosphorylated mutant mimics (3D) ( Figure  1h ). The same results have been obtained in LNCaP prostate cancer models (data not shown). These results demonstrate that Hsp27 phosphorylation partly regulates Hsp27/eIF4E interaction and confirm that loss of this interaction can induce treatment-sensitivity. To rationalize these results at a molecular level, first extensive molecular dynamics (MD) run was carried out on the WT Hsp27/eIF4E complex (Figure 1i ). The retrieved inter-protein binding free energy ΔG bind value of -11.86 kcal/mol (Table 1 ) revealed a good affinity between the two polypeptides, in agreement with the experimental evidences. A per-residue binding enthalpy (ΔH bind,res ) analysis [13, 14] allowed to determine which Hsp27 residues are mainly involved in this interaction ( Figure 1j ). Accordingly, we found that WT Hsp27 binds the initiation factor mainly by exploiting the initial residues of the domain WDPF (W=tryptophan, D=aspartic acid, P=prolin and F=phenylalanine) and the final residues of the flexible domain in the C-terminal region, these last providing a favorable contribution to the binding two times larger than that afforded by the amino acids of the N-terminal part ( Figure 1k ). The same computational approach was applied to the binding of the three truncated forms of Hsp27 (i.e., N1, N2, and C1) to the eIF4E protein. As expected, the ΔG bind values of the truncated forms were all less favorable compared to the WT protein (Table 1 ). Yet, a specific trend could be clearly discerned. Indeed, the presence of the C-terminal part still endow the Hsp27 C1 mutant with good eIF4E binding capability, inducing only a small decrease in binding affinity with respect to the WT (ΔG bind(C1) = -9.99 kcal/mol). On the other hand, the Hsp27 N2 isoform is still able to maintain a minimal affinity against the eIF4E through its WDPF residues; however, the absence of the C-terminal region leads to a strong reduction of the interaction surface ( Figure 1h ) and this, in turn, reflects into a loss of almost 6 kcal/mol in ΔG bind (Table 1) . Lastly, the presence of the sole WDPF domain in the N1 Hsp27 mutant form allows the formation of a network of very weak interactions with eIF4E, reflecting in a plummet of ~9 kcal/mol in the relevant value of ΔG bind (Table 1, Figure 1i ). In aggregate, our in silico results confirmed that the most important interactions involved in binding of the Hsp27 protein with the initiation factor eIF4E are provided by its C-terminal part, strictly in agreement with the co-immunoprecipitation experiments.
