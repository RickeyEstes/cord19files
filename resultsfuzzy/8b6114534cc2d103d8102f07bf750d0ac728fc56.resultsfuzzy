Practical applications of monoclonal antibodies in clinical veterinary medicine must be preceded by a firm basic knowledge of the structural character, virulence factors, and pathogenic mechanisms of disease-producing bacteria. The structure of this chapter is based on the structure of bacteria. It should become readily apparent that as more is known about the role of a particular structural component in the causation of disease, the more firmly based is speculation about the applications of monoclonal antibodies against that bacterial component. The limitations of space prohibit extensive discussions of the disease conditions presented in this chapter. Although an attempt is made to provide sufficient background material on each disease, readers not familiar with clinical veterinary medicine are referred to a standard textbook of veterinary medicine for further clarification (12) .
