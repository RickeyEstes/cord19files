Standard techniques utilizing RAT (for RSV and influenza A/B) and viral culture yielded positive results for at least 1 pathogen in 99 of 499 (20%) samples. RAT was positive in 66 (63 RSV, 3 influenza A) samples. Viral culture was positive in 63 samples (29 RSV; 18 adenovirus; 5 enterovirus; 5 parainfluenza 3; 3 parainfluenza 2; 2 influenza A; and 1 influenza B). RSV was detected by RAT (alone) 38 times, by culture (alone) 4 times, and by both RAT and culture 25 times. Influenza A was detected 1 time in culture (alone) and 2 times by both RAT and culture. Only 6 samples that tested positive by standard techniques gave negative SVPCR array RP results: these included 3 viral cultures positive for adenoviruses, 1 for enterovirus, and 1 for influenza A virus (the last was confirmed by positive influenza A RAT). One additional sample positive for RSV by RAT was negative by viral culture and SVPCR array RP. One patient with a positive RAT for RSV had a discordant viral culture that grew only adenovirus. That patient's SVPCR array RP identified RSV as well as R/E but not the adenovirus. Of the 499 samples tested by SVPCR array RP, 344 (69%; 3.4-fold higher than standard techniques) were positive for a total of 408 pathogens (Table 1) , including 275 (73%) of 377 specimens from younger children and 69 (57%) of 122 from older patients. This difference is significant (P ¼ .001). Excluding coronaviruses, hMpV, and HBCV, which our routine virologic diagnostic assays cannot detect, SVPCR array RP detected 318 viruses (3.2-fold higher than standard techniques). At least 1 pathogen detected by standard techniques correlated for at least 1 pathogen detected by SVPCR array RP results except for in the 6 cases noted above. Only 5 bacterial infections were detected: 4 B pertussis and 1 M pneumoniae. The pathogens most frequently identified by SVPCR array RP were R/E in 181 of 344 (53%), RSV in 95 of 344 (28%), and hMpV in 39 of 344 (11%). RSV detection was significantly higher in younger children (95/377 or 25%) as compared with older patients (10/122 or 8%; P .001). Frequency of the 3 pathogens most commonly detected by SVPCR array RP testing during the study months is shown in Figure 1 . Fever, as the only qualifying sign or symptom, was the single inclusion criterion for enrollment in only 28 (6%) of all participants having viral respiratory testing ordered by the treating clinician. Nine of these 28 (32%) had positive SVPCR array RP results. Those with positives results included 6 with R/E, 2 with RSV, and 1 with parainfluenza 2. One participant with R/E had coinfection with parainfluenza 3. More than 1 pathogen was identified in 57 SVPCR array RP specimens (11% of the total and 17% of those testing positive). Of those, 49 (86%) tested positive for 2 and 8 (1.4%) for 3 (Fig 2) . Multiple pathogens were detected in 49 younger children (13% of the total and 18% of those with a positive SVPCR array RP) but only in 8 older patients (6.6% of the total and 11.7% of those with a positive SVPCR array RP test). This age difference in the number of coinfections was not significant (P ¼ .277). Of those with coinfection, 36 of 57 (63%) would have required combined contact and droplet isolation precautions (gown, gloves, and mask) based on the pathogen combinations identified. Combined precautions are also recommended for adenovirus, which was detected in 17 singly infected patients. Therefore, 53 of 344 (15%) of those with at least 1 pathogen identified, or 11% of the months. The other pathogens were not tested because their numbers were too small. z RSV detection differed significantly in all children aged < 24 months (combined) compared with those ! 25 months (P value .001). x Coronavirus values are combined totals within the age categories and included HKU1, NL63, OC43, and 229E. 499 tested, would have required combined isolation precautions (Fig 2) . To estimate the theoretical number of children who may have been assigned to the wrong level of isolation precautions, only the RAT and SVPCR array RP assays had results available in time to impact isolation precaution determinations as culture is significantly slower. Thus, only the RAT and SVPCR array RP results were used in the calculation. Only 66 RAT were positive compared with the 344 who had at least 1 pathogen identified by SVPCR array RP. The difference between the 2 assays is 278. Standard testing with RAT could have wrongly assigned isolation precautions (either no precautions for a false negative RAT or single precautions when there should have been dual precautions (for coinfection) based in increased yield from SVPCR array RP) in 278 of those 344 (81%) with a positive test result or 278 of the 499 (56%) total participants.
