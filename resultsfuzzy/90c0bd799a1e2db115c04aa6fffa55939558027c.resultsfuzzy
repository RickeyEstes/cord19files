3.1. X-ray structure determination of the MERS PLpro-ISG15 complex We determined previously that the core MERS-CoV PLpro-ΔUbl2 enzyme, i.e. without its adjacent N-terminal ubiquitin-like 2 (Ubl2) domain, is thermally stable, retains its full kinetic activity and substrate specificity profile and has an increased ability to readily form crystals that diffract to high resolution compared to the enzyme with the Ubl2 domain (Clasman et al., 2017) . We therefore used the MERS-CoV PLpro-ΔUbl2 construct for the crystallization of the MERS-CoV PLpro-ISG15 complex, which was generated by reacting MERS-CoV PLpro-ΔUbl2 with the full-length, human ISG15 protein that was modified with a reactive, propargylamide (PA) group at its C-terminus. The PA group on ISG15 reacts with the catalytic cysteine and forms a covalent complex that can be readily purified (Supplementary Data: Fig. S1 ). From this point on, we will refer to the MERS-CoV PLpro-ΔUbl2 construct as simply "MERS-CoV PLpro" for simplicity. Three complete X-ray datasets were collected on crystals of the MERS-CoV PLpro-ISG15 complex that were grown at three different citrate concentrations (0.2, 0.3 and 0.35 M). Unexpectedly, analysis of the electron density surrounding the Zn-finger motif for the PLpro-ISG15 complex crystals grown from 0.35 M citrate revealed no observable electron density for the Zn 2+ atom in the Zn-finger motif even though these crystals diffracted to the same resolution and grew in the same space group as the crystals grown at the two lower citrate concentrations (Supplementary Data: Fig. S2 ). At citrate concentrations of 0.2 M and 0.25 M, the Zn 2+ atom in the Zn-finger motif is clearly visible in electron density suggesting that the higher concentrations of citrate chelated the Zn 2+ and thereby depleted it from the Zn-finger. Therefore, the X-ray structure of the MERS-CoV PLpro-ISG15 complex grown from crystals at 0.2 M citrate was determined to a resolution of 2.3 Å (R work = 17.1% and R free = 21.5%). A summary of the X-ray data collection and refinement statistics are provided in Table 1 . The enzyme crystallized in space group R3 with two identical copies of the PLpro-ISG15 complex in the asymmetric unit. The PLpro chains from each dimer were virtually identical with a RMSD of 0.08 Å over Cα atoms from 255 residues while human ISG15 exhibited slightly more conformational diversity with a RMSD of 0.8 Å over 151 Cα positions.
