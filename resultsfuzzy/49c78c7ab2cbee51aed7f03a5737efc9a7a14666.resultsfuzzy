Next generation sequencing technologies have recently been used to characterize the microbial diversity and functional capacity of a range of microbial communities in the gastrointestinal tracts of several mammalian species (Eckburg et al., 2005; Gill et al., 2006; Guan et al., 2007; Qu et al., 2008; Swanson et al., 2011) . Recently, the newly introduced bench-top next generation sequencing (NGS) machine, 454 GS Junior system allows individual research laboratory access to high through-put sequencing technology. Similar to the parental 454 GS systems, the 454 GS Junior system enables a comprehensive view into the diversity and metabolic profile of microbial communities of complex samples. Analysis of the reads can yield a high percentage of species identification in complex metagenomes and even higher in less complex samples. Long sequence reads from 454 GS Junior pyrosequencing can also provide the enormous specificity needed to compare sequenced reads against DNA or protein databases and give unambiguous assignment of even closely related species. 454 GS junior pyrosequencing generated a total of 152,494 sequences with average read length of 405.24 bp. De novo assembly of our feline metagenome sequences gave 5405 contigs with 83 contigs> 2 kb and 2659 contigs> 500 bp. The average contig length was 656.19 bp while the longest contig was 5231 bp and the shortest was 100 bp. The sequences have been submitted to NCBI Gene Bank with genome project ID 62073 under the cat fecal metagenome (CFM) project, and also available within a short read archive under the accession number SRA029158.2.
