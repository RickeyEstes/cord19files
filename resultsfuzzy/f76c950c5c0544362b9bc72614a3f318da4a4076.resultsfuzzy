Virtual screening and core hopping The detailed procedure of discovering the desired dual agonists is shown in Figure 2 . The lead-now database from ZINC was screened by utilizing the Glide5 software for its optimal performance targeting the PPAR receptors (PPARα:1k7l and PPARγ:1k74). 35, 36, 49 The top hit, ZINC36728034 (see Figure 2 ) was selected as the optimal lead compound for further modification according to the well known structures of ragaglitazar and GW409544, as shown in Figure 2 . 43, 75 Consequently, the phenyl group rendered by red color in ZINC36728034 (see Figure 2 ) is modified into an acidic group colored with blue, as shown in Comp#0 (Figure 2 ). The functional acidic group also exits in the following structures muraglitazar, 76 faraglitazar, 77 GW6471, 78 GW7845, 77 CHEMBL166572, 79 and so on. The new molecule Comp#0 was designed with the intention so it has stronger affinity than ZINC36728034. Subsequently, the core hopping method was used to search the fragment database for the desired chemical groups to replace the amide group (ie, the R 0 group) (Figure 2 ). Doing this was to help lengthen the Comp#0 structure so as to make it better fit the roomy space in arm 2 (see Figure 1 ). As a result, the amide group (ie, R 0 group) of Comp#0 in Figure 2 was replaced by each of the best ten R groups (ie, the R 1 to R 10, as marked on the right side of Figure 2 ). Subsequently, they were used to generate the whole molecules (ie, Comp#1 to Comp#10) through the core hopping approach (see Figure 2 ). The ten compounds displayed the same chiral center (S) of the submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Dovepress Dovepress α carbon atom of the acidic group with the ragaglitazar and the GW409544 (see Figure 2 ), and the other compounds of Comp#5 to Comp#10 with the other preferred chiral centers in R groups allowed them to match the active pocket. The above strategy of this study is very similar that in to our previous paper; 38 however, the starting point at which the study was carried out is very different. This current study used virtual screening as the first operation to find the novel scaffold against PPARs; we also used a previous study for this same purpose, 80 and we then developed new compounds with the core hopping method, while the previous study mainly modified the well known ligand GW409544 though the use of two steps of the core hopping method. 38 At first glance, the current study is quite similar to a previous study, 38 for we used the same protein targets, fragment database, core hopping method, and molecular dynamics modeling, but the detailed approaches are completely different. Therefore, it will be necessary to combine both studies that use the core hopping method for novel drug development in order to provide more comprehensive information.
