Development of CSNCFs involves the initial synthesis of AgNPs followed by impregnation of the AgNPs into cellulose fibers. The current approach involves the use of 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7% (w/v) GA and GG solutions as reduction media for the preparation of AgNPs from 0.588 mM AgNO 3 . The conversion of Ag + ions into silver nanoparticles was due to the reduction action of functional groups present in GA and GG (Dorjnamjin, Ariuna, & Shim, 2008) , where the pendent hydroxyl groups of GA and GG were assumed to be actively involved in the reduction process. Further, the high molecular chains present in GA and GG provide stabilization for the formed AgNPs. The impregnation of AgNPs in to the cellulose fibers was done by immersing and rotating the cellulose fibers in the poly-AgNPs solutions of GA and GG at 300 rpm for 24 h at ambient temperature of 27 • C in the orbital shaking incubator, and subsequently taken out and dried. Silver nanoparticles deposited on the cellulose fibers were considered to be attached due to physical interactions with the surface hydroxyl groups of cellulose (Gardner et al., 2008) . The schematic representation of the formation of silver nanoparticles on the cellulose fibers was illustrated in Fig. 1 . Formation of silver nanoparticles was predicted by color change form colorless to ruby red color of poly-AgNPs solutions and was further confirmed from the UV-vis spectra with intense absorbance band exactly between 430 and 450 nm. This was due to surface plasmon excitation vibrations of the silver nanoparticles (Duran et al., 2007; Shankar, Rai, Ahmad, & Sastry, 2004) . The UV-vis spectra of the various GA and GG AgNP solutions taken after reduction time of 80 h was shown in Fig. 1A . From the figure, it was clear that increase in the maximum intensity was observed with corresponding increase of GA and GG concentrations. Furthermore, for the same concentration, GG showed high intense peaks than GA. Absorption peaks at 432. 51, 434.65, 435.71, 434.74, 437 .95 and 443.16 nm were observed for GA 0.3%, GA 0.5%, GA 0.7%, GG 0.3%, GG 0.5% and GG 0.7% respectively. Also for the same concentration, poly-AgNPs solution of GG showed absorption maxima at higher wavelength than poly-AgNPs solution of GA. This red shift indicates either an increase in size or aggregation of AgNP in GG solutions than in GA solutions (Hettiarachchi and Wickramarachchi, 2011) . The same can be confirmed by TEM analysis, where the GG-AgNPs were larger in size than GA-AgNPs were seen. The increase in absorption with time, up to 80 h was shown in Fig. 2 . The formation of AgNPs in polymer solutions (GA, GG) was conformed from TEM analysis. From the shown TEM images ( Fig. 1B  and C) , it was clear that the AgNPs formed were spherical in nature with an average particle size of 5 ± 3 nm in poly-AgNPs solution of GG (Fig. 1B, a and b ) and 4 ± 2 nm in poly-AgNPs solution of GA (Fig. 1C, a and b) . From TEM analysis, it was concluded that the size of the formed AgNPs was in between 2 and 8 nm, which was about 62% size compacted than earlier work (Ravindra, Murali Mohan, Narayana Reddy, & Mohana Raju, 2010), where the size of AgNPs was around 21 nm. Furthermore, the size of AgNPs in poly-AgNPs solution of GG solutions was larger than size of AgNPs in poly-AgNPs solution of GA solution, which was further supported by UV-vis data where the surface plasmon resonance of the formed AgNPs form GG reduction were observed at higher wave length (red shift) than from GA reduction. It was expected that both GA and GG stabilize the AgNPs by well-established chemical bonding between the functional groups (Sreedhar, Keerthi Devi, & Deepthi, 2011; Abdel-Halim et al., 2011) . This can be technically concluded, as the aggregation of AgNPs was not found in TEM images, which may be attributed due to the effective passivation of the surfaces and the suppression of the growth of the nanoparticles through strong interactions via the functional molecular groups of GG ( OH) and GA ( OH, COOH). The formation of silver nanoparticles inside the polymer network (GA and GG) was also investigated by FTIR analysis. The FTIR spectra of pure GA, pure GG, aqueous solutions of GA, aqueous solution of GG and aqueous polymer/silver nanoparticles (Ag 0 /GA and Ag 0 /GG) solutions were recorded, in order to identify the functional groups involved in the synthesis of AgNPs.
