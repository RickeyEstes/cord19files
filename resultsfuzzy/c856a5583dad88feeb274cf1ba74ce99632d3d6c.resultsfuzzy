The nuclear change of PEDV infected cells was monitored by confocal immunofluorescence assay. As can be seen in Fig. 3 , with the PEDV replication, the nuclear of infected cells gradually gathered, piled up, some of which split into fragments. These gathered nuclears and nuclear fragments and the surrounded cytoplasmic membrane formed a multinucleated syncytium. At the end stage of infection (72 h post-infection), the nuclear of infected cell split into condensed fragments completely. To investigate the molecular mechanism of PEDV-induced apoptosis in host cells, we detected the timecourse activation status of AIFM1, caspase-3, caspase-8 in PEDV-infected Vero cells. The results showed that AIFM1 was cleaved upon PEDV infection. The amount of truncated AIFM1 was increased gradually (Fig. 4a) . The cleaved caspase-8 was also detected at 24 h post infection (B), while the cleavage of caspase-9 was not observed in the whole course. Consistent with AIFM1 and caspase-8 activation, the downstream effector caspase-3 (C) and substrate PARP (D) were also cleaved in response to PEDV infection. This together suggested PEDV infection not only activates AIFM1 but also induces the extrinsic apoptotic pathway activation. The relative changes of Western blot band intensity of AIFM1 precursor and activated AIFM1, as well as the cleaved caspases-3, − 8 and PARP to β-actin were shown in Fig. 4e -j. The effect of PEDV infection on caspase-3, − 8 and − 9 activations was further confirmed by using caspase activity assay kits at 48 h post infection. The relative fold changes (OD 405 nm) of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 in the PEDV infected cell lysis were shown in Fig. 5 . The results showed that PEDV infection results in obviously Caspase-3 activation and caspase-8 activation, but no activation of caspase-9. The results are also consistent with above western-blot results.
