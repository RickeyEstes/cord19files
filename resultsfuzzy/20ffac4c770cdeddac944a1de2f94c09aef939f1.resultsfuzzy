The network ILM was the model for which the best results were expected since the observed epidemic was simulated using a network ILM. Further, the true underlying contact network over which the observed epidemic was generated was used in the fitted model. For all 27 parameter combinations of study one and all 8 parameter combinations of study two, H ðFÞ are zero for the network ILM. Results of the MPSE for the network ILM were generally favorable compared to the other models tested. The non-network models fit were the geometric ILM, exponential ILM, constant piecewise model and the homogeneous mixing model. There seem to be no obvious simple relationships between H ðFÞ and either e in or r. However, with a ¼ 0:1 and infectious period equal to six time units there was an apparent increase in H ðFÞ with increasing e in . The network parameter that had by far the greatest effect on H ðFÞ was e out . All non-network models produced the lowest H ðFÞ values for parameter combinations involving e out ¼ 0:0. The H ðFÞ values for all non-network models were substantially higher than the H ðFÞ values for the network ILM. Non-network model H ðFÞ values ranked on average from lowest to highest were given by constant piecewise model, geometric ILM, exponential ILM, and finally the homogeneous mixing model. Results between the geometric ILM and exponential ILM were often similar. Plots of the fitted probability of a susceptible individual becoming infected by an infectious individual against the distance between the two individuals for each of the fitted models under the posterior means, along with the true model, for study one can be seen in Fig. 3 for various combinations of the network parameters. Similar to the H ðFÞ results, MPSE values were highly related to the e out value, with the lowest MPSEs from e out ¼ 0:0. Model performance for the MPSE depended on the e out value. In all cases the network ILM had the lowest MPSE values followed by homogeneous mixing model, constant piecewise model, exponential ILM, and geometric ILM for e out ¼ 0:05 and 0:2 however, for e out ¼ 0:0 the homogeneous mixing model performed the poorest. Increases in the number of super-spreaders, the number of connections for each super-spreader and the spatial de-
