To assess the performance of VIGOR, five sets of annotated sample sequences were downloaded from Gen-Bank. These included influenza virus, rotavirus, coronavirus, SARS coronavirus and rhinovirus. VIGOR was compared to three separate gene finding programs: GeneMarkS, ZCURVE_V and FLAN. GeneMarkS [2] and ZCURVE_V [14] both are ab initio universal gene finding programs. FLAN is a web-based gene prediction tool specific for influenza viruses that was developed at NCBI for the Influenza Genome Sequencing Project and has been widely used to annotate influenza sequences [15] . FLAN uses the similarity based approach, comparing the influenza genomic sequences with annotated influenza peptide sequences to identify open reading frames. GeneMarkS and ZCURVE_V were run for all sample genomes, while FLAN was run only on influenza genomes. The results were evaluated by comparison between the gene finder predictions and annotations in GenBank. Sensitivity (Sn) and Specificity (Sp) were employed to evaluate the performance of the programs tested. Sn is defined as the percent correct predictions out of all annotated genes in the dataset. Sp is defined as the percent correct predictions out of all predictions. Correct predictions are those which are the same as the Gen-Bank annotations. Any prediction that was not identical to the GenBank annotation was inspected manually by similarity searching against the NCBI non-redundant (NR) protein database. If the new prediction was highly similar (E value <1e-10) to a viral protein spanning 95% of the homologous protein length, it was categorized as a correct prediction. A partially correct prediction was assigned when the prediction overlapped with the Gen-Bank annotation in the same reading frame but with a different start codon. An incorrect prediction was assigned when the prediction overlapped with the Gen-Bank annotation but in a different reading frame, or cannot be validated by sequence similarity.
