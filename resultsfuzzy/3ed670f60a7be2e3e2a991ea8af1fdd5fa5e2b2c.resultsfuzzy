Coronaviridae S2 proteins are believed to be functionally equivalent to the transmembrane subunits of Retroviral ENV. However, using well-known sequence comparison algorithms [15, 16] , we found that there is no sequence homology between the S2 protein of SARS-CoV and HIV-1 gp41. Markedly, LearnCoil-VMF [17] , helical wheel analysis and protein topology prediction [18] reveal that the SARS-CoV S2 protein consists of the same elements that were characterized in HIV-1 gp41 (Figure 2b ): (I) N-HR, a Leucine/ Isoleucine heptad repeat appears on residues 913-1000 of the SARS-CoV CUHK-W1 isolate (Figure 3a) .; (II) C-HR, a Leucine/Isoleucine heptad repeat appears on residues 1151-1185 ( Figure 3b ); (III) the loop between these two HRs is longer than that of gp41, and is confined by four Cysteine residues and nine Proline residues that might conform a double loop structure; (IV) a transmembrane region is predicted adjacent to the C-terminus of the protein [18] ; (V) a Tryptophan/Tyrosine-rich motif is located between the C-HR and the transmembrane domain (Figure 4) . The results reveal similar structural motifs in HIV-1 gp41 and SARS-CoV S2 proteins, suggesting an analogous membrane fusion mechanism induced by the two viruses. The helical wheel diagram serves as an equivalent to the Spartan scytale, the first military cryptographic device, consisting of a cylinder with a strip of paper wound around it. The recipient has a rod of the same diameter, on which he wraps the paper to read the message. Herein, the prior knowledge of the 3.5 periodicity learned from the HIV-1 gp41 structural studies, is used to decipher the structural features of the SARS-CoV S2 protein. In general, SARS-CoV S2 and HIV-1 gp41 share the hairpin structure. However, it is worth noting that the N-HR of S2 is longer than that of gp41 and contains more Leucines and Isoleucines. Furthermore, while the C-HR of gp41 barely shows any heptad repeat signal, the C-HR of S2 has a perfect Leucine/Isoleucine heptad repeat in its "d" positions. The antiviral activity of Enfuvirtide was reported as early as 1993 [19] , while it took few years until the fold of gp41 core complex was discovered [3] and its crystal structure being solved [1, 2] . Based on these structural studies, peptides corresponding to the C-HR of gp41 core complex, such as C34, were synthesized and found to efficiently inhibit HIV-1 induced membrane fusion [1] . Interestingly, Enfuvirtide, which is a shifted version of these Cpeptides, does not comprise the residues that were shown to be essential for their inhibitory activity [20] . Indeed, others and myself reported that in some cases C34 is more potent in inhibiting HIV-1 gp41 induced membrane fusion than Enfuvirtide [21, 22] . Thus, the SARS-CoV sequence corresponding to C34 has higher chances to block SARS-CoV entry.
