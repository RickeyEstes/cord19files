The GPEI is a data-driven program. Laboratory results confirm geographic locations of poliovirus transmission and are used in planning of responsive immunization actions. Data sharing relationships were established among laboratories and immunization and surveillance personnel ( Figure 2 ). In early phases of the GPEI, electronic data management systems and Internet were absent from many laboratories in resource-constrained settings. WHO mobilized resources and designed databases, procured computer and communication equipment, and trained laboratory personnel in electronic data management. Currently, laboratories share databases weekly with WHO and national authorities. WPV, VDPV, and partial genomic nucleotide sequence results, however, are shared within 1-2 days of their availability. Separate databases are maintained by laboratories that sequence viruses, but sequences are shared among laboratories as needed to perform phylogenetic analyses, particularly related to virus importations and VDPV emergence. In the event of new scientific discoveries, all laboratories making significant contributions to testing and analysis are represented among coauthors of scientific publications.
