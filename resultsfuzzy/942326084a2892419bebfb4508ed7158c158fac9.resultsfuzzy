The ISVdb houses and provides GUI access to imputed probabilistic genotype and diplotype data, for all eight founders and all (as of March 24, 2016) 72 CC strains. CC allelic state is imputed at all exonic (6 100 bp) founder SNPs and indels (which can be as long 100 bp), but not at founder large structural variant positions . According to the ISVdb estimates of allelic state across strains, the genotype in most variants is known with high certainty ( Figure S1 in File S10). Variants with uncertain genotype appear widely and evenly distributed across the genome ( Figures S2-S103 in File S10). Residual heterozygosity, a key driver of uncertainty, is estimated to affect 3:1% of exonic (6 100 bp) variants overall, but can vary dramatically between strains and chromosomes; e.g., the proportion of variants affected by residual heterozygosity ranges from 0 in CC003 on chr 2 to 0.38 in CC056 on chr 8 (Table S1 ). Note that heterozygous variants are defined as those with at least a 25% chance of continuing to segregate. Approximately 72.6% of (the polymorphic) CC strain variants are identical to the B6 mouse reference genome (Table S1 ). Intronic (8.8%), downstream (4.3%), noncoding transcript (3.4%), and upstream variants (2.9%) differing with respect to B6 are the next most common mutations, while alleles expected to have a large effect, such as stop-gain (0.003%) or stop-loss (0.001%) mutations, are extremely rare (Table S2) .
