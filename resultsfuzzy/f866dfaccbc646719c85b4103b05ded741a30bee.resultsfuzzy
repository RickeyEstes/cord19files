SCV helicase nsP13 has been shown to have dsDNA unwinding activity and was shown to belong to the family of SF1 helicases (28) . Like many SF1 helicases, the SCV helicase requires an exposed ss DNA or RNA for binding to the nucleic acid complex and the helicase translocates along the nucleic acids by hydrolyzing ATP. We have previously shown that ss DNA or RNA stimulates the ATP hydrolysis activity, but dsDNA does not (25) . Although the crystal structures of a few typical SF1 helicases complexed with DNA were revealed (29,30), e.g. Rep and PcrA, only a computational 3D model has been proposed for the SCV helicase nsP13 (20) . Therefore, details about the nucleic acid unwinding mechanism of SCV helicase nsP13 have to be deduced from biochemical studies only. Hence, we investigated how the mechanistic efficiency of dsDNA unwinding by nsP13 is affected by the structural features of the dsDNAs, such as duplex length, ssDNA tail length and artificial ss gap between the two DNA duplexes. Single-turnover kinetics of duplex DNA unwinding by nsP13 Because nsP13 has been shown to unwind both DNA and RNA duplexes that have a 5 0 -tail (6,7), we designed DNA duplexes with a 5 0 -tail at one side as the unwinding substrates to investigate the single-turnover kinetics of DNA unwinding by the helicase. Previously, analysis of nucleic acids unwinding by the coronavirus helicase was performed using a multiple turnover kinetics experiment, in which the helicase may rebind to the substrates after completion of a cycle of unwinding (6, 7) . In contrast, our experimental setup of the single-turnover condition enabled us to obtain quantitative aspects of the unwinding kinetics, especially the processivity of unwinding by the helicase. The reaction scheme is shown in Figure 1A , in which the helicase is initially allowed to bind to the substrate without ATP hydrolysis. In the absence of ATP hydrolysis, unwinding was not observed (data not shown). However, the addition of magnesium ions to the reaction allowed the helicase to unwind the DNA duplexes ( Figure 1A ). The duplex DNA unwinding reaction was initiated by adding a solution of MgCl 2 (13 mM) and a large excess (3.0 mM) of trap oligonucleotides (unlabeled bottom strand) to a mixture of the pre-incubated reaction containing duplex DNA substrates (5 nM) and helicase (200 nM). The trap oligonucleotides served to prevent the re-initiation of unwinding by trapping free helicases and  any helicases that dissociated from the substrates during unwinding (Supplementary Data). The trap oligonucleotides also prevented reannealing of the displaced bottom strand (Supplementary Data). Under the single-turnover reaction condition, the nsP13 helicase unwinded the dsDNA substrates and generated ssDNA products that were resolved by non-denaturing PAGE ( Figure 1B ). The kinetic time-course of ssDNA accumulation was plotted and fitted to an exponential function to obtain the reaction amplitudes and unwinding rates of only the helicases that were initially bound to the DNA substrates.
