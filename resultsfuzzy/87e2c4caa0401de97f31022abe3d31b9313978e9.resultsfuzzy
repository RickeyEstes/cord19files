Respiratory viruses were analyzed in 1764 samples. HRV testing was added in 2012 and HRV was analyzed in 795 samples. One or more respiratory viruses were identified in 51.0% of the patients (Table 1) . HRV (23.0%, 183/795) and RSV (22.7%, 401/1764) were the most commonly identified viruses in hospitalized children, followed by PIV (13.4%, 236/1764), HBoV (8.4%, 149/1764) and ADV (6.2%, 110/1764). Other viruses such as IFV (4.4%), HMPV (2.2%) and HCoV (0.6%) were identified in small proportions. Multiple viral combinations in samples were found, including 223 dual, 37 triple and 3 quadruple combinations. Common combinations are listed in Table 2 . Six respiratory bacteria were analyzed among 1816 samples. One or more respiratory bacteria were identified in 26.2% (475/1816) of the patients. The most commonly detected bacteria were K. pneumoniae (11.5%, 209/1816), S. pneumoniae (9.5%, 173/1816) and S. aureus (4.0%, 73/ 1816), followed by H. influenzae (2.5%), P. aeruginosa (1.9%), and Group A streptococcus (0.4%). Multiple bacterial combinations in samples were found, including 52 dual and 8 triple bacterial combinations. K. pneumoniae/S. pneumoniae co-infection was the most frequent combination. Eight viruses and 6 bacteria were tested in 1728 samples, among which 883 (51.1%) were identified with at least one respiratory pathogen. 240 (27.2%, 240/883) were viral/bacterial combination among positive cases. Among 9 death cases, 6 patients were identified with at least 1 respiratory pathogen, including 2 boys with single virus (IFV, HRV respectively), 2 boys with dual virus (PIV/HRV, PIV/HBoV respectively), 1 boy with triple virus (RSV/PIV/HRV) and 1 girl with both virus and bacteria (PIV/S.pneumoniae). None of the pathogens was identified in the rest of 3 boys.
