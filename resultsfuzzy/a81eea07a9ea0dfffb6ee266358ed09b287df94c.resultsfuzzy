At the first sampling in 2013, 622 out of 1347 sampled herds were BRSV-antibody positive and 973 were BCV-antibody positive, i.e. a proportion of test positive of 46.2% for BRSV and 72.2% for BCV as previously reported (Toftaker et al., 2016) . The national control program started in March 2016, resulting in BTM samples from 1565 herds in the study area. On this final screening, 688 herds (44.0%) were antibody positive for BRSV and 1210 herds (77.3%) were antibody positive for BCV. Of the initially negative herds that were also sampled in 2016, 178 (29%) had changed status for BRSV and 89 (29%) for BCV. An overview of counts and proportions of test outcomes are presented in Table 1 .
