Since no experimental data was available for this case, this study used the Lagrangian and Eulerian models as benchmarks to assess the performance of the Markov chain model. This investigation used a grid resolution of 1,446,790 in the simulation, which was sufficiently fine to capture the turbulent flow in the room [12] . The evaporative process is almost instantaneous for droplets with a diameter of 1 mm [32] . The time step size was 0.1 s. The independence test showed that this time step size was sufficiently fine to capture the transient features. The calculations for this case were performed over a time period of 5 room time constants. For the Lagrangian model, the particle number injected from the source was 2.29 Ã‚ 10 6 , which was calculated using the method proposed by Chen et al. [33] . Fig. 6 compares the time-varying particle concentration distributions predicted by the Markov chain model with those predicted by the Lagrangian and Eulerian models in the first 100 s. All three models show that the exhaled particles initially moved upward with the thermal plume generated by the index person. The particles then dispersed throughout the room and reached the receptor. It can be seen in Fig. 6 that the Markov chain and Lagrangian models both predicted slower particle dispersion than did the Eulerian model. Note that both the Markov chain and Lagrangian models use the principle of the random walk model (Eq. (14)) to calculate the turbulent diffusion, while the Eulerian model includes the turbulent diffusion term in the particle governing equation. The numerical diffusion introduced by the Eulerian model may be an important reason for its more dispersive characteristics. Generally speaking, the trends in transient particle transport predicted by the Markov chain model agree well with both the Largangian and Eulerian models. For the calculation as a whole in this case, the Markov chain model was 8.0 times faster than the Lagrangian model and 6.3 times faster than the Eulerian model.
