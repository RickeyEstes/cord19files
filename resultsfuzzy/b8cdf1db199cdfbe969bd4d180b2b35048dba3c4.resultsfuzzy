Quantitation of viral loads in samples that were HAdV-positive using the AB PCR showed a range from 1 to 6.08 log with a mean of 3.07 log and an SD of 1.5 log (Fig. 1A) . For HBoV-positive samples, the viral load ranged from 1 to 7.70 log with a mean of 3.02 log and an SD of 2.50 log ( Fig. 2A) . To standardize HAdV and HBoV quantitation in the samples, the albumin gene was quantified in parallel with HAdV and HBoV DNA in all 90 positive specimens. As expected, the number of cells in the nasal aspirates differed from one sample to another. In nasal samples which were positive for HAdV, the mean albumin gene copy number was 2.88 log with a range from 0.18 to 4.28 log and an SD of 0.89 log (Fig. 1A) ; in samples positive for HBoV, the mean copy number was 3.21 log with a range of 1.26-4.15 log and an SD of 0.74 log ( Fig. 2A) . The number of copies of the albumin gene is proportional to the number of cells in the sample, and HAdV and HBoV particles are also cell-associated in clinical samples. Thus, results can be expressed as the ratio of the number of copies of HAdV or HBoV to the number of copies of the albumin gene. This allows to compare results obtained from different nasal aspirates and ensures that the number of cells in each nasal sample (and thus the quality of the sampling) is not a limiting factor. The ratio of HAdV copies to albumin DNA copies ranged from 0 to 404.78 with a mean of 53.14 ( Fig. 1B ) and the ratio of HBoV copies ranged from 0 to 8012.82 (mean ratio: 910). Four samples had a ratio >1000 that indicated a high HBoV DNA level (Fig. 2B) . Next, the HAdV DNA and the HBoV DNA were quantitated according to the severity of the disease. A severe disease was defined when low respiratory symptoms were present and a non-severe disease was defined in the presence of high respiratory symptoms only. The HAdV copy number ranged from 1 to 5.53 log with a mean of 3.06 log and a SD of 1.38 log in the severe-disease group. In the non-severe disease group the HAdV copy number ranged from 1 to 6.08 log with a mean of 3.07 log and a SD of 1.65 log. The mean number of HAdV copies was comparable in the two groups, whether the disease was severe or not (3.06 log versus 3.07 log). The ratio of HAdV copies to albumin DNA copies ranged from 0 to 404.78 with a mean of 62.82 in the patients with severe disease, and from 0 to 103.57 with a mean of 26.52 in the patients with non-severe disease. There was no statistical difference between these two groups. The HBoV copy number ranged from 1 to 7.7 log with a mean of 3.99 log and a SD of 2.95 log in the severe disease group and from 1 to 4.3 log with a mean of 1.75 log and a SD of 1.01 log in the non-severe disease group. The mean number of the HBoV DNA copies was higher in the severe-disease group than in the non-severe disease group (3.99 log versus 1.75 log) and the difference was significant statistically (P = 0.006). The ratio of HBoV copies to albumin DNA copies ranged from 0 to 8012.82 with a mean of 1883.15 in the patients with severe disease, and from 0 to 87.33 with a mean of 6.35 in the patients with non-severe disease. The difference between the two HBoV-positive groups, severe and non-severe, remain statistically significant after standardiza- Fig. 2 .

For one 6-month old female patient two nasal aspirates were available at a 3-day interval. The viral load of HBoV in the first nasal aspirate was 7.7 log and was dramatically decreased 3 days later. The viral load in the second nasal aspirate reached 3.32 log. This patient was hospitalized in the pediatrics department for feeding difficulties and weight loss in an underlying context of bronchiolitis diagnosed one week before. A first nasal aspirate was sampled at admission and virus detection by conventional methods was negative. Three days later when the second nasal aspirate was performed the symptoms improved. This patient was not included in the statistical analysis because it was an isolated case. HAdV and HBoV were co-detected in 3 cases. The HAdV viral load was high in one case (5.48 log) and mild in 2 cases (2.18 and 2.04 log). Low level of HBoV viral load was detected in these 3 cases (<1 log). Low respiratory symptoms (severe disease) were present in one case and high respiratory symptoms (non-severe disease) were present in the other 2 cases. The research of PCR inhibitors and extraction efficiency was conducted on 100 negative samples for the detection of HBoV and HAdV by the duplex AB PCR. All these samples were tested positive for the detection of the T4 phage. The Ct varied between 30.30 and 33.76 and the Ct for the reference control (water extract with T4 phage) was 30.89. The conclusion is that no PCR inhibitors were present in these samples.
