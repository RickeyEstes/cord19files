A reference range for haematological parameters is given in Table 2 .2. The haematological picture gives an indication of the general health status of a rabbit. Stress and a range of diseases will alter haematological parameters. Hinton et al. (1982) analysed the haematological findings in 117 healthy and diseased rabbits and found that blood cellularity was a good indicator of disease especially with regard to erythrocytes (these tended to be depressed) and lymphocyte counts (the counts were variable; however, heterophils tended to become dominant in acutely ill animals). These findings are in agreement with studies of experimental infections in rabbits Krueger, 1988, 1989) and in a clinical study by Harcourt-Brown and Baker (2001) . In this study, significantly higher red cell counts, haemoglobin values, haematocrits and lymphocyte counts were found in rabbits kept outside with unlimited access to grazing and exercise. A comparison was made with rabbits kept in hutches and those suffering from dental disease. (Gillett, 1994) Comment Erythrocytes 4-7 Ã‚ 10 12 /L Anisocytosis, polychromasia, small numbers of nucleated red blood cells and Howell-Jolly bodies can be normal findings in rabbit blood films.
