PREDICT is likely the most comprehensive wildlife viral detection and zoonotic disease capacity development program in the world to date. It achieved major advances in understanding wildlife viruses and the factors that contribute to their spillover into human populations on a global scale and in building capacity in less developed countries for the rapid detection and control of EIDs (Fig. 19.3) . Through PREDICT, more than 2500 people, including government personnel, veterinarians, students, physicians, laboratory technicians, field biologists, and hunters, were trained in biosafety and PPE, surveillance methods, laboratory techniques, and disease outbreak investigation. PREDICT worked with more than 32 diagnostic laboratories around the world to institute low-cost methodologies for conducting PCR assays for rapid detection of viruses in wildlife samples. By humanely sampling more than 56,000 nonhuman primates, bats, rodents, and other wildlife at high-risk human-wildlife interfaces, PREDICT detected 984 unique viruses in wild animals and people, 815 of which were novel. This effort more than doubled the number of known mammalian viruses in the world. to government partners and interactions with communities about PREDICT created unique opportunities to allay fears about or animosity toward wildlife and to talk about the intrinsic value of wildlife populations, intact habitats, and biodiversity. In its current phase (2014-2019), PREDICT has embarked upon an even larger scope with a more intense focus on the dynamics of zoonotic viruses in wildlife, people, and livestock (primarily influenza, filovirus, paramyxovirus, and coronavirus) and the human behaviors that drive their
