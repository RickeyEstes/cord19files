The archetypical model for secondary demyelination is Wallerian degeneration (see Ch. 32). When a peripheral nerve or a myelinated tract in the CNS is cut or crushed, axons and myelin in the distal segment degenerate, demonstrating that the integrity of the myelin sheath depends on continued contact with a viable axon. During Wallerian degeneration in the PNS, there is a rapid loss of myelin-specific lipids and proteins within a week or two, with a concomitant increase in lysosomal enzymes. Between the second and fourth week after nerve section, most of the myelin debris has been removed by Schwann cells and macrophages, and remyelination of regenerating axons begins. Degeneration of CNS myelin is a much slower process than in the PNS and takes place primarily within macrophages/microglia (not within the myelin-synthesizing cells, as in the PNS). Secondary demyelination occurs in a variety of acquired and genetic CNS disorders that initially affect neurons, including mechanical trauma, infarcts, tumors, motor neuron disease, and sphingolipidoses such as Tay-Sachs disease, generalized gangliosidosis and Niemann-Pick disease (see Chs. 41 and 43). The isolated myelin from these diseases is usually of the 'nonspecific pathological type' that was discussed earlier in the context of some inherited primary demyelinating disorders.
