NP pneumococcal carriage was highly prevalent in both groups: 28/30 (93.3%) in cases vs. 53/ 60 (88.3%) in controls (p = 0.71). The calibration curve for NP pneumococcal DNA quantification showed a linear behavior over six orders of magnitude, defining a linear range between 2.6•10 3 and 2.6•10 8 copies/mL. The correlation coefficient R 2 was 0.997 and the slope of the standard curve was -3.572 resulting in an efficiency of 90.6% for real-time PCR. Both parameters fell within the acceptable limits previously established. Among study samples, quantification of NP pneumococcal load by lytA real-time PCR showed a significant difference in mean load between cases and controls (7.0 log 10 copies/mL vs. 5.8 log 10 copies/mL, p<0.001). Capsular typing revealed that cases were more extensively colonized by invasive serotypes 1, 5 and 7F/A (46.4% vs. 3.8%, p<0.001) and more frequently co-colonized by different serotypes (84.0% vs. 39.0%, p<0.001). Considering all serotype carriage events separately in each group, the most frequent serotypes identified in cases were 7C/ (7B/40) (27.3%), 5 (10.6%), 6A/B (9.1%), and 23F (9.1%), whereas for controls, serotype 6A/B predominated (19.7%), followed by 19F/C/B (14.8.%), 7C/(7B/40) (13.1%) and 14 (11.5%). Comparatively, mean NP pneumococcal load of cases recruited after the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine did not substantially differ from that of cases recruited in the pre-vaccine period (6.8 log 10 copies/mL vs. 7.1 log 10 copies/mL, p = 0.52). Half of the cases (50%) tested positive for HIV. HIV-positive cases did not present with a significantly higher mean pneumococcal load than those being HIV-negative (7.3 log 10 copies/mL vs. 6.8 log 10 copies/mL, p = 0.22). Of note, data of co-infection with HIV were not available from control samples. Malaria co-infection was detected in 2/30 (6.7%) of cases. Respiratory viral infection (mono-or multiple) was highly prevalent in both cases (14/30, 46 .7%) and controls (17/60, 28.3%), but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). A total of 33 viruses were detected, 16 in cases and 17 in controls, with rhinovirus being the most predominant finding in both groups (n = 25, in 10 cases and 15 controls), followed by adenovirus (n = 5, four cases and one control), parainfluenza virus (n = 2, one case and one control), and influenza (n = 1, one case). Median hemoglobin (Hb) levels were significantly lower in cases than in controls (74 g/L vs. 103 g/L, p<0.001), similarly to median hematocrit (HCT) values (23.5% vs. 31.0%, p<0.001). In contrast, no significant differences were found in median platelet (PLT) and white blood cell (WBC) counts. Table 2 describes results of laboratory microbiological and hematological tests in the two groups.
