Prevalence and divergence of CAVV along a gradient of habitat modifications. Between February and June 2004, 7,067 mosquitoes were trapped along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient in the area of the Ta National Park, Côte d'Ivoire. The gradient comprised sampling sites in the primary (pristine) forest, in secondary (modified) forest, in agriculturally exploited forest edge areas, and in adjacent human settlements (14) (15) (16) . Initial analyses by cell culture and electron microscopy yielded viral particles with CoV-like morphology in supernatants of C6/36 cells infected with mosquito homogenates. A short genome fragment with low but significant identity to ORF1b of CoV was identified (14) . This virus was tentatively named Cavally virus (CAVV), after a river near the sites where mosquitoes were caught. Extensive attempts at virus isolation from adult female mosquitoes pooled in small numbers (up to 23 mosquitoes per pool) yielded virus in 40 (9.3%) of the 432 pools tested. As shown in Table 1 , virus was most frequently isolated from Culex mosquitoes, especially Culex nebulosus. Mosquitoes of the genera Aedes, Anopheles, and Uranotaenia were also found to be infected but at lower rates. CAVV was present in all sampled habitat types but with the highest prevalence in human settlements (Table 1) . Analysis of variance showed the observed virus isolation rate in human settlements (and only there) to be significantly different from the mean isolation rates (F test, P Ͻ 0.00001) and from all isolation rates in any other habitat. In order to gain insight into the genetic diversity of CAVV, a 603-nucleotide (nt) genome fragment representing the 1b polymerase gene region was amplified and sequenced from all positive pools. The pairwise genetic distance between the isolates was up to 15% at the nucleotide level and up to 9.9% at the amino acid level. In particular, the nucleotide distance of isolate CAVV/A4/CI/2004 from all other isolates ranged between 13.5 and 15%, whereas the range of distances was below 1.8% for all other CAVV isolates. This suggested the presence of a diversified virus population comprising two different clusters whose distance is compatible with different species. CAVV is an insect-associated virus whose hosts were encountered along a gradient of anthropogenic habitat modifications. To examine possible influences of habitat modification on virus diversity, average nucleotide distances over sequence pairs were determined within the amplified 603-nt fragments from all pools and were assigned to one of the habitat types from where the respective isolates originated, i.e., (i) primary forest or research camps within a primary forest (9 isolates), (ii) secondary forest (5 isolates), (iii) plantations (6 isolates), and (iv) villages (19 isolates). The mean numbers of nucleotide exchanges in pairwise sequence comparisons were determined within the samples pertaining to each habitat type. CAVV/A4/CI/2004 was excluded to prevent bias from a virus that may be evolutionarily disconnected from the main clade (putative second species). In habitat types i to iv, the mean pairwise exchange rates within the 603-nt fragment were 4.35, 2.8, 0.6, and 2, respectively. Even though isolates from villages predominated numerically in the data set, the level of diversification was highest in primary forest (chi-square test on exchange rates, P Ͻ 0.01). To estimate the habitat association of the putative common ancestor of the 39 virus isolates, sequence fragments were subjected to phylogenetic analysis using a minimum evolution model, considering either the numbers of pairwise synonymous nucleotide exchanges or the percentages of overall (synonymous and nonsynonymous) pairwise nucleotide exchanges. CAVV/A4/CI/ 2004 was used as an outgroup. Phylogenies were subjected to ancestral state reconstruction under a parsimony assumption. These simple models of phylogeny and trait evolution were chosen because the ordered and sparse pattern of nucleotide exchange across the alignment suggested the absence of multiple or saturating exchanges. As shown in Fig. 1 , ancestral state reconstruction suggested the most recent common ancestor linked to the outgroup, as well as the common ancestor of the ingroup, to have existed in a primary forest habitat. This matches the general concept wherein novel viruses are being transferred to areas of human settlement in the course of agricultural exploitation of primary habitats. We tested 269 pools of 1,716 adult male mosquitoes collected during this survey for CAVV infection by specific real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (14) . CAVV was not detected in male mosquitoes, suggesting that CAVV is likely dependent on amplifying vertebrate hosts. Viral growth and morphology. Virus growth kinetics and morphological presentation in insect cells were studied. Cells showed strong cytopathic effects (CPE) manifesting in aggregation of cells at 48 h postinfection (hpi) ( Fig. 2A and B) . Virus replication was measured by real-time RT-PCR every 3 h for 2 days. Maximal RNA concentrations were reached at 15 to 18 hpi, indicating a fast replication cycle (Fig. 2C) . Enveloped, spherical CoV-like virions with a mean diameter of 120 nm and large, clubshaped surface projections were detected in cell culture supernatants at 48 hpi by negative staining electron microscopy (Fig. 3) . In ultrathin sections of fixed insect cells analyzed by transmission electron microscopy at 48 hpi, vesicles containing spherical, potentially enveloped particles were observed in the cytoplasm of infected cells. These were 50 to 60 nm in diameter and lacked surface projections ( Fig. 3A and B) . A role for these vesicles filled with virions resembling steps during virus maturation, as shown for other plus-strand RNA viruses, remains to be investigated (28) (29) (30) . Furthermore, tubular structures likely of viral origin were detected in the cytoplasm of infected cells (Fig. 3A) . Separation or adsorption of putative virions on cell membranes is shown in Fig. 3C . These particles were morphologically indistinguishable from typical particles encountered in cleared cell culture supernatant (Fig. 3D) . Full genome sequencing of isolate CAVV/C79/CI/2004 was achieved by a combination of adaptor-based random RT-PCR and ultradeep sequencing. The entire CAVV genome comprised 20,108 nt, excluding the 3= poly(A) tail (GenBank accession number HM746600), a size intermediate between that of arteriviruses (13 to 16 kb) and CoV or RoV (26 to 32 kb) (17) . The genome contained seven major ORFs, as well as untranslated regions of 362 and 570 nt at the 5= and 3= ends, respectively ( Table 2 ; Fig. 4A ). In an effort to identify potential functional domains, the seven ORFs were compared by psiBLAST to a database restricted to nidoviruses ( Table 2) . Putative replicase polyprotein genes. The replicase genes of nidoviruses share several domains and features conserved across the families Arteriviridae, Coronaviridae, and Roniviridae (25) . These are (from the N to the C terminus) transmembrane domain 1 (TMD1), TMD2, a 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) (31), TMD3, a ribosomal frameshift site (RFS) (32, 33) , an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (34), a zinc-binding domain (ZBD), an RNA helicase (HEL), and a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (Nen-doU) (35, 36) . CoV, ToV, and RoV also share a 3=-5= exonuclease (ExoN) upstream of NendoU (37) and a ribose-2=-Omethyltransferase (MT) at the C terminus (38, 39) . CoV and ToV also encode an ADP-ribose 1-phosphatase upstream of TMD1 (19, 40, 41) . Using TMHMM v2.0, three hydrophobic regions comprising putative multiple membrane-spanning domains (TMD1 25 L-L 47 , TMD2 1128 I-Y 1272 , and TMD3 1727 Y-M 1780 ) were identified within the first predicted ORF of the CAVV genome. Three TMDs are also found in ORF1a of CoV and ToV, whereas RoV has four TMDs (18) . However, the position of CAVV TMD1 was similar to that in RoV (18) . Between TMD2 and TMD3, a putative 3CL pro domain was identified. Comparative sequence analysis suggested that the CAVV 3CL pro domain is a cysteine protease with a Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad (see Fig. S1a (Fig. S1c) . Although short regions with low similarity suggest conservation of the ExoN and MT domains, reliable alignments could not be generated and biochemical evidence remains to be obtained to confirm the functionality of these domains. Putative RFS. Expression of the second major ORF of nidoviruses involves a programmed ribosomal frameshift into the Ϫ1 reading frame, occurring just upstream of the ORF1a stop codon (32, 33) . The overlap region of ORF1a and -1b typically contains a slippery heptanucleotide sequence and a downstream RNA pseudoknot structure that together promote ribosomal frameshifting (32, 33) . With minor variations, previously identified nidovirus slippery sequences conform to the XXXYYYZ consensus sequence conserved in many ribosomal slip sites on viral RNAs (for a review, see reference 42). Thus, for example, ArV, CoV, and ToV use 5=-(U/G)UUAAAC and RoV uses 5=-AAAUUUU as a slippery sequence (18, 42) . The short (~35-nt) ORF1a/1b overlap region in CAVV does not contain heptanucleotide sequences related to those of other nidoviruses. The only XXXYYYZ-like sequence identified in this region of the CAVV genome is 7829 CCCUUUG. However, previous systematic mutagenesis studies of ribosomal slip sites (43) revealed that the CCCUUUG heptanucleotide sequence does not promote efficient Ϫ1 ribosomal frameshifting in vitro and, to our knowledge, has not been reported to mediate efficient ribosomal frameshifting in viral or cellular systems. Further analyses revealed 7835 GGAUUUU as a further candidate slip site. The GGAUUUU sequence conforms to the simultaneousslippage model introduced by Jacks et al. (44) . More importantly, data obtained for red clover necrotic mosaic (diantho) virus (RC-NMV) (45, 46) have shown that this sequence mediates efficient Ϫ1 ribosomal frameshifting and thus expression of the downstream p57 polymerase ORF of RCNMV. Furthermore, the CAVV 7835 GGAUUUU sequence is located 5 nt upstream of an energetically favorable RNA secondary structure. Both the length of the spacer element and the presence of a putative stem-loop structure adjacent to the proposed frameshift site support the idea that CAVV ORF1b expression is mediated by Ϫ1 ribosomal frame- shifting at this site. Even though direct experimental evidence would be desirable to further corroborate this prediction, it seems reasonable to suggest that ORF1a/1b-encoded sequences are fused at a 2491 Leu-Asp-Phe-Ser junction site. Regulation of transcription. Although all nidovirus subgenomic mRNAs are 3= coterminal, different families and genera have different subgenomic mRNA 5= ends. ArV and CoV subgenomic mRNAs contain a common 5= leader sequence derived from the 5= terminus of the genomic RNA. The leader template is fused to nascent minus strand mRNA templates via a copy choicerelated template switching process called discontinuous extension of minus strands or discontinuous transcription (DT) (47, 48) . Copy choice occurs at transcription-regulating sequences (TRS), comprising short conserved sequence motifs that follow the leader and precede each downstream gene's ORF (48) (49) (50) . In contrast, the subgenomic mRNAs of RoV do not contain leader sequences (24) . Synthesis of subgenomic mRNA templates is believed to be mediated solely by attenuation of minus strand synthesis, involving mRNA transcription on minus-stranded replicative intermediates (nondiscontinuous transcription [NDT]) (26) . ToV uses DT to express RNA2 and NDT for RNAs 3 through 5, respectively (51) . To investigate the nature of subgenomic mRNAs in CAVV, total RNA was isolated from CAVV-infected cells and subjected to Northern blot analysis. RNA from noninfected C6/36 cells served as a control. To avoid detection of defective interfering RNAs, cells were infected at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) with virus obtained from limiting dilution endpoints of early-passage supernatants. Northern blot probes were generated against the most 5= 107 nt and the most 3= 556 nt of the genome (Fig. 4B) . Additional probes were generated for the major predicted ORFs (Fig. 4B) . Apart from a band corresponding to the genome size, fragments of approximately 4.7, 2.7, and 1.8 kb were detected with the 5= probe. These were also represented in a blot with the 3= probe, suggesting that these RNAs are 5= and 3= coterminal with the genome (DT, Fig. 4C ). Additional bands of ca. 1.4, 1.2, and 1.0 kb were detected with the 3= probe but not with the 5= probe, compatible with an NDT mechanism. The ORF2a probe detected the genome and two additional bands, one corresponding to a subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) starting upstream of ORF2a, the other within ORF2a (Fig. 4A) . No band corresponding to a separate sgRNA for the predicted ORF2b was observed. A prominent band of 1.8 kb was seen with all probes in and downstream of ORF3a, suggesting an sgRNA starting upstream of ORF3a. A minor band of 1.4 kb was confirmed with the probe placed in ORF3b and all downstream probes. Two additional minor bands of ca. 1.2 and 1.0 kb were seen with the ORF4 probe and the 3=-end probe. According to estimated molecular weights, these corresponded to sgRNAs starting ca. 300 and 500 nt upstream of the initiation codon of ORF4 ( 19399 AUG). Functional studies are required to determine these positions more precisely, as size estimates are based on RNA gel electrophoresis only. To identify potential fusion sites indicative of DT, one-step RT-PCRs were conducted for each sgRNA detected by Northern blotting. Sense primers were placed at intervals starting from the 5= end of the genome approximately 300 nt into the genomic sequence (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Antisense primers were selected according to the projected sizes of the sgRNAs. RT-PCRs targeting the 4.7-kb and 2.7-kb bands resulted in products with sense primers up to at least 126 and 152 nt, respectively, from the 5= end of the genome. The 1.8-kb band was associated with PCR products up to 202 nt from the 5= end of the genome. PCR products of various and unexpected sizes were observed for the smaller potential sgRNAs (i.e., all sgRNAs smaller than the 1.8-kb band in the Northern blot). Representative PCR products for all putative sgRNAs were cloned and sequenced. PCR products of unexpected sizes from small subgenomic mRNAs yielded sequences indicative of misprimed amplification in various positions of the genome, and it was concluded that these subgenomic mRNAs were generated by NDT, lacking a leader consistent with the Northern blotting results. The three sgRNAs that were clearly codetected with 5= and 3= probes revealed potential sites of fusions between genome leader and downstream mRNA sequences. Different sites were used for each sgRNA, as shown in Fig. 4B . Nevertheless, all sgRNAs had an A/C-rich region immediately downstream of the fusion region in common. It should be noted that Northern blot detection intensities of the 4.7-kb and 2.7-kb bands corresponded well between the 5= and 3= probes, whereas the detection intensity of the 1.8-kb band was much greater with the 3= probe than with the 5= probe (Fig. 4C) . This matched the presence of a much smaller fusion region in the RT-PCR product of the 1.8-kb sgRNA. Given the high intensity of the 1.8-kb band, we suspected that a major fraction of the total amount of this sgRNA would not contain a fused leader element; nonetheless, several variant fusion sites were detected in parallel clones for all subgenomic mRNAs. Further studies are required to characterize in more detail the various CAVV RNA species and their functional relevance in CAVV genome expression. Initial predictions on structural protein genes. Sequence analyses of proteins predicted to be expressed from the 5 major ORFs in the 3=-proximal region of the CAVV genome revealed little (if any) similarity with other viral (and cellular) proteins, confirming that CAVV diverged profoundly from other nidoviruses and complicating functional assignments of these proteins. As summarized in Table 2 , two proteins are expected to be expressed from sgRNA 2. ORF2a is predicted to encode a type I glycoprotein featuring a C-terminal membrane-spanning domain and multiple glycosylation sites. Based on these predictions, the protein likely represents a functional equivalent of the S protein of other nidoviruses, which remains to be confirmed in further studies. The predicted translation start codon of ORF2b is the second AUG on the subgenomic mRNA2, located just downstream of the ORF2a start codon, suggesting that ORF2b may be translated by a leaky scanning mechanism. ORF2b encodes a highly basic protein (pK a , 10.8) with a molecular mass of 24 kDa. Both its size and its charge suggest that this protein may be the viral nucleocapsid protein. Among nidoviruses, this upstream position of the (presumed) N protein gene in the CAVV genome is unusual but has its precedent in members of the family Roniviridae (52). ORF3a and -3b encode proteins with predicted molecular masses of 18 and 14 kDa, respectively. Database searches failed to reveal close homologs of these proteins. Protein analysis software predicts the presence of membrane-spanning domains in both proteins (residues 95 to 117 in ORF3a and residues 73 to 95 in ORF3b), suggesting that both proteins are integral membrane proteins. The ORF3a protein likely contains a signal peptidase cleavage site, 15 Ala-Met-Ser|Ala-Glu, and is predicted to be glycosylated, further supporting a role as a membrane-spanning structural protein of the virus. The specific mechanism used to express the ORF3b gene product is unclear but may involve internal ribosomal entry, as shown previously for several downstream ORFs expressed from coronavirus subgenomic mRNAs (53) (54) (55) (56) . Further studies are required to establish if ORF3a and ORF3b proteins have functions related to those of the membrane-spanning M and E proteins of other nidoviruses. ORF4 encodes a small protein of 50 amino acid residues with unknown functions. Phylogenetic analyses reveal a novel cluster of insect nidoviruses. In order to identify the phylogenetic relationship of CAVV with other nidoviruses, we conducted phylogenetic analyses of protein alignments of conserved motifs within 3CL pro (ORF1a), RdRp, and HEL (ORF1b), as well as the putative structural S protein (Fig. 5) . In all phylogenies, CAVV branched from a deep node in the nidovirus tree above the Roniviridae family. In the ORF1b and S genes, CAVV had a most recent ancestor in common with the subfamilies Torovirinae and Coronavirinae. In 3CL pro , it branched from an ancestor it has in common with the subfamily Torovirinae. The low bootstrap support at this root point suggested that CAVV might also branch from an ancestor it has in common with Torovirinae and Coronavirinae. Although formal classification criteria for nidoviruses are not established, this phylogenetic positioning suggested CAVV to be a profoundly separated cluster of nidoviruses that might constitute a new family of nidoviruses with a phylogenetic position between Roniviridae and Coronaviridae on one side and Arteriviridae on the other.
