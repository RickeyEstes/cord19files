The mRNAs of intron-containing genes are more stable than those of intronless genes in yeast strain Y262 (Table 1) . Strangely, we found that the mRNAs of intronless genes are more stable in yeast strain rpb1-1 (Table 1) , although the difference is very small. Different from human genes, the mRNAs of the yeast intronless genes we analyzed are significantly longer than those of intron-containing genes (Supplementary Table S1 ). We further compared the mRNA stabilities between intronless genes and introncontaining genes with similar mRNA length and similar GO annotations as above (as intron-containing genes are rare in yeast, we selected intronless genes with similar functions and mRNA lengths to pair with each intron-containing gene). The mRNAs of intron-containing genes are still more stable than those of intronless genes in yeast strain Y262, but less stable in yeast strain rpb1-1 (Fig. 1) . Controlling for mRNA length, mRNA stability and intron number are positively correlated in strain Y262, but not in strain rpb1-1 ( Table 2) .
