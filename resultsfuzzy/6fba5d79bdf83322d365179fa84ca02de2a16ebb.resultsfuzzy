Raw data. Fig. 1 illustrates raw data. The left panel (Fig. 1a) , a typical thermal image, shows skin temperature measured in different regions of the subject's face. One complication is that the subject inevitably shifted position of his head during the long measurement times, thereby presenting the possibility that the apparent temperature might shift owing to change in the measurement focus. To compensate for this possibility, we made differential measurements between two regions of the forehead, one blank region (cosmetic-free), one region to which cosmetics were applied. Showing the excellent reproducibility of the measurement over extended times, Fig. 1b illustrates apparent absolute temperature plotted against time. Naturally, this healthy subject's skin temperature of ≈ 34.35 C was below his body temperature, which was normal. Creams, powder. In Fig. 2 , the effect of applying cosmetic is considered. Depression of skin temperature is plotted against time after the cosmetic was applied. Cosmetic #1, marketed as a tone-up brightening cream, produced the largest depression of skin temperature. Skin temperature was depressed by at least 2 C for 15 min and 1 C for 20 min, likely because evaporation of volatile components lowers temperature. The evaporation rate was notably slow, perhaps because the volatile components (water) also dissolve in the skin. After the cosmetic had remained on the skin for 40 min, it was washed with cosmetic remover and strikingly, the skin temperature remained depressed by ≈ 0.8 C. This semi-permanent depression of skin temperature likely reflects the presence of residual solid-state brightener specified as an active ingredient in the product's marketing. Cosmetic #2, marketed as a natural moisturizing cream, also depressed the skin temperature by at least 2 C for 15 min and 1 C for 20 min. After this time, the skin temperature continued to decrease, probably reflecting the continuing absorption of cream into skin. After 40 min, no further change was observed. Cosmetic #3, a powder highlighter containing dry powder, mica and talc, produced similar depression of skin temperature as the long-time effect of cosmetic #1, except that it lacked the strong temperature depression associated with evaporation of copious volatile liquid. The steady-state temperature depression was ≈ 0.8 C. FIG. 3. Sunscreen influence on thermal temperature measurement. Temperature depression is plotted against time for cosmetic #4, an emulsion sunscreen, and cosmetic #5, a broad-spectrum cream sunscreen. The remarkably strong temperature depression of cosmetic #5, despite its lower SPF value, appears to be because it is a cream. The inset, a thermal image of the subject's face, illustrates the cosmetic-coated region of the forehead. Fig. 3 , depression of skin temperature is plotted against time after sunscreens were applied. Cosmetic #4, an emulsion sunscreen, produced no depression of skin temperature after 5 min, reflecting rapid evaporation of the alcohol carrier liquid. However, cosmetic #5, a broad-spectrum cream sunscreen, produced markedly long-lived depression of the skin temperature for times extending beyond 30 min.
