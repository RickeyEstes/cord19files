Liquorice is largely used as a flavouring and sweetening agent, but has been proposed also for various clinical applications (Armanini et al., 2005) . According to many pharmacopeias, liquorice presents demulcent and expectorant properties for dissolving and facilitating the discharge of mucus in catarrhs and for upper respiratory tract diseases and is currently employed in cough preparations (Blumenthal et al., 2000) . Ulcer-healing properties, which may result from stimulation of mucus synthesis, have been documented (Blumenthal et al., 2000) . Liquorice preparations have been studied as possible adjuvant in treating spasmodic pains of chronic gastritis (Bradley, 1992; Wichtl and Bisset, 1994) . It also shows anti-inflammatory and mineralocorticoid properties due to the presence of glycyrrhizinic acid and its metabolite glycyrrhetinic acid, which is an inhibitor of cortisol metabolism. Liquorice also may have mild laxative activity (Armanini et al., 2002) . In a trial for gastric ulcer disease (Bardhan et al., 1978) , however, liquorice did not demonstrate any benefit. The effects first reported by Dioscorides and Al Razi referring to beneficial effects on excessive tissue growth around nails, in the eye and in form of tumours have been confirmed in vitro by demonstrating that liquorice causes apoptosis. This is evident from its antineoplastic effect against melanoma and gastric cancer cells (Ma et al., 2000; Wang and Nixon, 2001; Kobayashi et al., 2002) . Besides the antiproliferative effects shown with liquorice, new useful applications have recently been described in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (Saeedi et al., 2003) , suggesting a potential role for the drug in allergic/inflammatory diseases of the skin. In addition, liquorice has been reported to be useful for inflammatory lesions induced by ultraviolet radiation (Fujita et al., 1980; Halder and Richards, 2004) . Further new and interesting studies have recently been reported. In vitro antiviral effects were observed for viruses causing respiratory tract infections like influenza virus and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus, the Hepatitis B virus and Epstein Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), encephalitis causing viruses like herpes simplex virus and Japanese encephalitis virus (Badam, 1997; Utsunomiya et al., 1997; Sekizawa et al., 2001; Sasaki et al., 2002; Cinatl et al., 2003; Lin, 2003) . Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that liquorice extracts possess antiatherogenic effects and can inhibit LDL oxidation. The administration of small amounts of liquorice-root extract may act as potent antioxidant in atherosclerotic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (Fuhrman et al., 1997) and in moderately hypercholesterolemic patients (Fuhrman et al., 2002) . Regarding the therapeutic applications of liquorice in diseases of the urinary tract, Ross (2001) described a diuretic effect only in association with other herbs.
