The efficiency of IFITM-mediated entry inhibition depends on the viral vector. We first asked whether the nature of the virion on which a viral glycoprotein is presented can impact IFITM-dependent entry inhibition. To address this question, we compared IFITM-mediated inhibition of entry driven by murine leukemia virus Env (MLV-Env), simian immunodeficiency virus Env (SIV-Env), and FLUAV hemagglutinin/ neuraminidase (FLUAV-HA/NA) presented in the context of retrovirus (MLV, SIV)-and rhabdovirus (vesicular stomatitis virus [VSV])-based vectors. For these experiments, 293T target cells previously transduced to express IFITMs or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) as a negative control were chosen as targets for transduction. For analysis of SIV-Env-dependent transduction, target cells were additionally transfected to express rhesus macaque CD4 and CCR5. Entry of MLV and SIV vectors pseudotyped with FLUAV-HA/NA was reduced by 60 to 80% upon expression of IFITM2 and IFITM3, while MLV-Env-driven entry was barely inhibited by IFITM proteins, as expected (Fig. 1A) . Similarly, entry of retroviral particles bearing SIV-Env was only modestly reduced by IFITM proteins. In contrast, expression of all IFITM proteins reduced entry of VSV vectors bearing MLV-Env, SIV-Env, or FLUAV-HA by at least 60% (MLV-Env) or 80% (SIV-Env, FLUAV-HA) (Fig. 1A ) and the relative susceptibility to inhibition by IFITM proteins was not dependent on the amount of particles used for transduction (not shown). These results raised the question of whether Env proteins presented on VSV vectors are generally more susceptible to inhibition by IFITM proteins or whether other factors accounted for the differential inhibition. For instance, the reduced IFITM sensitivity of MLV and SIV vectors relative to VSV vectors could be due to reduced glycoprotein incorporation and/or generally diminished entry efficiency of the latter, which might increase IFITM sensitivity. However, Western blot analysis of SIV-Env incorporation into MLV, SIV, and VSV particles did not point toward major differences (Fig. 1B) , although the ratio of gp120 to gp160 was somewhat higher for MLV than for SIV/VSV particles (not shown) and a comparison of the luciferase values measured in lysates of transduced cells revealed that relative sensitivity to IFITM was not linked to entry efficiency (not shown). Alternatively, gene expression from VSV but not MLV or SIV vectors might be inhibited by IFITMs. To address this, we used a VSV minireplicon system dependent on the expression of T7 polymerase and cells stably expressing IFITM2 or -3, in which antiviral activity of IFITMs can be more readily visualized than in transduced cells. Transfection of 293T control cells and cells stably expressing IFITM2 or IFITM3 with plasmids encoding the minireplicon system yielded comparable signals (Fig. 1C) , indicating that VSV gene expression was not inhibited by IFITMs. Moreover, transduction of these cells by VSV vectors bearing Machupo virus glycoprotein (MACV-GPC), which is known to be IFITM insensitive (6) , was only slightly inhibited by IFITMs, and similar results were obtained for a vector bearing the Nipah virus glycoproteins (NiV-G/F) (Fig. 1D ), in keeping with the concept that IFITMs do not block VSV gene expression. In contrast, transduction mediated by FLUAV-HA was strongly blocked by IFITM2 and IFITM3 expression (Fig. 1D) , confirming that the IFITM proteins exerted antiviral activity in the cell lines tested. Collectively, these results demonstrate that IFITMs do not interfere with VSV gene expression, a finding compatible with a previous study examining the sensitivity of intact VSV to blockade by IFITM proteins and tetherin (24) . As a consequence, one must postulate that the particle context in which a viral glycoprotein is presented can impact sensitivity to IFITM, with VSV-based vectors being associated with higher IFITM sensitivity than retroviral vectors. We next used a simple, two-component system to further explore the potential impact of the virion background on IFITM sensitivity. For this, particles based on HIV Gag and Ebola virus (EBOV) VP40 proteins fused to the ␣ fragment of ␤-galactosidase were pseudotyped with VSV-G and used to transduce 293T cells stably expressing IFITM2 or -3. In addition, the target cells were transfected to express the fragment of ␤-galactosidase. VSV-G was chosen for pseudotyping of the Gag and VP40 particles, because only this glycoprotein (and not, for instance, EBOV glycoprotein [EBOV-GP] or HIV-Env) consistently yielded signals 30-to 50-fold over background. VSV-G-driven entry was previously shown to be modestly inhibited by IFITM2 and IFITM3 (6), a finding confirmed in the present study with a VSV vector (Fig. 1D ). In keeping with these findings, VSV-G-driven entry of Gag particles into cells expressing IFITM2 or -3 was reduced by up to 70% relative to entry into control cells (Fig. 1E ). In contrast, IFITM2 expression had no appreciable impact on VSV-G-driven entry of VP40 particles and blockade of entry by IFITM3 was less efficient than that measured for Gag particles (Fig.  1E) . These results provide further evidence that the efficiency of the inhibition of viral entry by IFITMs can depend on the nature of the virions presenting the entry-mediating viral glycoproteins. IFITM sensitivity of SIV-Env-driven entry depends on the efficiency of Env incorporation into virions. The observations that SIV variants can differ in the efficiency of Env incorporation into virions (25, 26) and in sensitivity to IFITM (17) stimulated us to investigate whether these two processes are linked. To answer this question, we produced MLV particles in cells transfected with increasing amounts of SIV-Env-or MLV-Env-encoding plasmids, employing the conditions described for Fig.  1B . The differences in the amount of Env incorporated into virions had no effect on IFITM sensitivity of MLV-Env-driven entry ( Fig. 2A) . Similarly, we had previously observed that the efficiency of virion incorporation of the EBOV-GP does not alter sensitivity to IFITM (27) . In contrast, reducing the amount of SIV-Env in MLV particles markedly increased IFITM sensitivity in a concentration-dependent manner ( Fig. 2A) . This effect was confirmed in the rhesus macaque-derived sMAGI (simian multinuclear activation of a galactosidase indicator) cell line (28) , which expresses endogenous IFITM3 (Fig. 2B) . Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of IFITM3 expression (Fig. 2B) markedly increased FLUAV infection, as expected, and augmented the efficiency of SIV-Env-mediated transduction (Fig. 2C) . The latter effect was inversely correlated with the efficiency of virion incorporation of SIV-Env (Fig. 2C) , suggesting that the number of SIV-Env trimers present on the virion surface can impact sensitivity to IFITM. The antiviral activity of IFITM3 plays an important role in the defense against influenza and potentially other viral diseases (8, 29) . It is thus of significant interest to determine the full range of viruses susceptible to inhibition by IFITMs. It is well established that IFITMs target host cell entry (6) , and several studies employed vector systems to determine whether viral entry is blocked by IFITM expression (6, 7, 22, 27) . We observed that SIV-Env-and MLV-Env-driven entry is IFITM sensitive when these glycoproteins are presented in the context of VSV, but not MLV or SIV, particles. These findings were not due to differential transduction efficiency or major differences in particle incorporation of Env, although it should be pointed out that Gag/M-protein levels cannot be directly compared and that minor differences in particle incorporation efficiency might have remained undetected. Similarly, these observations were not due to a differential impact of IFITMs on retroviral or rhabdoviral gene expression, which were both unaffected ( Fig. 1C and data not shown) . Notably, virus-like particles (spherical) based on HIV-p55Gag and harboring VSV-G exhibited a higher sensitivity toward inhibition by IFITM2 and -3 than the corresponding particles based on EBOV VP40 (filamentous), and no appreciable differences in particle incorporation of VSV-G were observed (not shown). Therefore, one must postulate that sensitivity of viral Error bars indicate SD. The results were confirmed in three separate experiments. Numbers above bars indicate the averages from four independent experiments for which transduction of control cells was set as 100%. Statistical analysis was carried out for normalized data. (B) sMAGI cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs, and IFITM3 expression was analyzed by an immunoblot assay employing an IFITM3-specific antibody. Similar results were obtained in two separate experiments. (C) sMAGI cells transfected as described for panel B were transduced with MLV vectors bearing escalating amounts of SIV-Env, and transduction efficiency was determined as described for panel A. In addition, the cells were infected with FLUAV encoding Gaussia luciferase, and luciferase expression in culture supernatants was analyzed at 48 h postinfection. The average from three independent experiments (two for FLUAV) is shown. Error bars indicate SEM. glycoproteins to IFITMs can depend on the virion context. It can be speculated that virions of different shapes might exhibit a different propensity to be taken up into the cell via certain uptake mechanisms and thus to be exposed to IFITM proteins. As a consequence, studies with viral vector systems must be complemented by examination of authentic viruses to draw firm conclusions regarding IFITM sensitivity. The efficiency of IFITM-mediated inhibition of HIV and SIV entry into target cells is isolate dependent (17) , for at present unclear reasons. We found that the efficiency of SIV-Env incorporation into the envelope of MLV vectors determines the degree of sensitivity to IFITM. This finding suggests that differences in Env incorporation could contribute to the differential IFITM sensitivity of SIV-isolates. In contrast, the amount of MLV-Env (present study) or EBOV-GP (27) inserted into particles does not modulate IFITM sensitivity. These discrepant observations might be accounted for by differential inhibition of these glycoproteins by IFITMs. Thus, it has been documented that amphotericin B treatment rescues SIV but not EBOV-GP-mediated entry from blockade by IFITMs (17, 27) , demonstrating that IFITMs can indeed interfere with viral entry via different mechanisms. Moreover, the recent demonstration that Env and IFITMs interact in transfected cells (shown for HIV-1 Env in reference 21) raises the question of whether such interactions also occur during entry and might contribute to the IFITM-mediated entry blockade. In this case, increasing the amount of SIV-Env in the particle envelope might allow the Env to surpass in titer the IFITM molecules available to inhibit viral entry. In sum, we identified novel parameters that can impact the sensitivity of viral entry to IFITMs. Our findings should facilitate endeavors to fully define the range of viruses targeted by IFITMs and could help to understand how viruses might evade the antiviral activity of these proteins.
