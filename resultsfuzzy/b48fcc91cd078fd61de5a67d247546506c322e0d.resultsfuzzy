Out of 83 samples, 5 (6.0%) contained FeKoV RNA. All the positive samples were identified from diarrhoeic cats (5/37), with a prevalence rate of 13.5%. Three of the FeKoVinfected samples were also positive for FPV and FECV, while two samples tested positive only for FeKoV. Partial 3D sequences were determined from all the positive samples and compared with cognate sequences available in the databases. By FASTA and BLAST analyses all the sequences displayed the closest nucleotide (nt) identity (91.0-94.0%) to the FeKoVs recently discovered in South Korea (Chung et al., 2013) . The full-length genome sequence of one FeKoV strain (TE/52/13/ITA) was determined and deposited in Genbank under accession number KM091960. The TE/52/13/ITA genome was 8,201-nt in length excluding the poly(A) tail and shared the highest nt identity (96.0%) to the Asian prototype strain FK-13 (Cho et al., 2014) , while identity to CaKoVs and AiVs was 80.0-83.0% and 75.0-77.0%, respectively. The predicted polyprotein (2436 aa) encoded by a single open reading frame (7,467 nt), was flanked by a 646-nt-long 5 0 untranslated region (5 0 UTR) and a 244-ntlong 3 0 UTR. The polyprotein comprised a leader protein (L), three structural proteins (VP0, VP3, and VP1), and seven nonstructural proteins (2A to 2 C and 3A to 3D). The positions of the cleavage sites on the polyprotein were predicted by sequence alignments and NetPicoRNA analysis (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPicoRNA). Likewise in other kobuviruses, the predicted cleavage sites were consistent with L/VP0, VP3/VP1, VP1/2A, 2A/2B, 2B/2 C, 2 C/3A, 3B/3 C and 3 C/3D sites, all which contained Q/G residues, but the VP0/VP3 and 3A/3B cleavage sites, which contained E/G and Q/A residues. The aa identity between strain TE/52/13/ITA and FK-13 in the P1 (853 aa), P2 (636 aa) and P3 (779 aa) regions was 98.0%, 100% and 98.0%, respectively. Based on sequence and phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1) , the two FeKoV strains formed a tight group (bootstrap value 100%) distinct from CaKoVs, MuKoV and AiVs, within the species Aichivirus A. The findings of this study demonstrate that FeKoVs are not geographically restricted to South Korea, where they were first signalled (Chung et al., 2013; Cho et al., 2014) . Our results also provide further evidence that a distinct group of kobuviruses (i.e. FeKoVs) within Aichivirus A species, but with peculiar genetic signatures, circulates in cats. Accordingly, FeKoVs should be considered as common constituents of feline enteric viroma. In this study, FeKoVs were detected only in diarrhoeic animals, with a prevalence rate similar to that reported in South Korea (Chung et al., 2013) . Some of the FeKoV-positive cats were also infected by other feline pathogens such as FPV or FECV. These findings were not unexpected, as mixed infections are not infrequent, chiefly in animal communities such as shelters. Although these results demonstrated that FeKoVs are common viruses of cats, it is not clear whether they also play a role as enteric pathogens. Large structured epidemiological studies and comprehensive characterization of FeKoV strains identified from other geographic areas and experimental infections might help clarify their global distribution, genetic heterogeneity and possible association with enteric diseases in cats. Several pieces of evidences indicate that enteric viruses of carnivores may have a zoonotic potential: (i) infection of young children by rotavirus strains of canine and feline origin has been documented repeatedly (De Grazia et al., 2007) ; (ii) having dogs in or near a home has been recognized as a risk factor for acquisition of IgA antibodies specific for noroviruses (NoVs) in infants in a seroepidemiologic study conducted in rural Mexico (Peasey et al., 2004) ; (iii) IgG antibodies specific for NoVs of carnivores (genotype GIV.2) have been detected in human serum samples (Di Martino et al., 2014) and dogs can be infected, in turn, with human NoVs of different genotypes (Summa et al., 2012) ; (iv) IgG antibodies specific for human AiV (strain A846/88) were detected in dog and cat sera in a serological study conducted in Europe (Carmona-Vicente et al., 2013) . Accordingly, considering the close genetic relatedness of these novel kobuviruses with AiVs, and the strict social interactions between humans and cats, it will be important to address whether cross-species transmission of kobuviruses might occur between carnivores and humans.
