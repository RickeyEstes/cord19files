Selection of Muc4 as a SARS-CoV disease associated gene 48 In earlier studies, incipient CC lines were used to identify four QTLs associated with 49 SARS-CoV phenotypes in female mice, one of which was mapped on the basis viral titer in the 50 lung at four DPI (Gralinski et al., 2015) . A subsequent study utilizing both male and female F2 51 mice derived from a highly susceptible and highly resistant CC mouse line identified five more 52 SARS-CoV-associated QTLs, three of which were mapped at least partially on the basis of viral 53 titer (Gralinski et al., 2017) . Located on chromosome 16 from nucleotides 31,583,769-54 36,719,997, the pre-CC QTL accounted for 22% of the variation in viral titer, which ranged from 55 over 10 8 PFU/lobe to below the limit of detection (10 2 PFU/lobe). The F2 QTLs, by comparison, 56 were located on chromosomes 18, 7, and 12 and explained 12.9%, 12.3%, and 5.4%, 57 respectively, of the observed variation in titers from high 10 2 to low 10 7 PFU/lobe. Thus, while 58 SARS-CoV titer in the lung is clearly influenced by multiple host genetic factors, the preCC QTL 59 on chromosome 16 was chosen for candidate gene selection and validation. Analysis of allele 60 effects revealed that the founder PWK/PhJ was the main driver of low SARS-CoV titer in the 61 lung ( Fig. 1A) , and PWK/PhJ also had lower titers than any other founder strain at four DPI 62 (Gralinski et al., 2015) . We therefore used private SNPs or In/Dels found in PWK/PhJ to reduce 63 the potential targets in the QTL to seven ncRNAs and 74 genes for downstream analysis. 64 To prioritize the list of ncRNAs and genes within the QTL, the relationship between RNA 65 transcript levels and viral titer in the lung was examined. Sixty seven preCC mice had both 66 microarray and titer data available, of which sixty had titers above the limit of detection 67 (Gralinski et al., 2015) . Of the 74 candidate genes, 54 had one or more probes on the 68 microarray (Table S4) Table S5 ). Using 70 infection data from the founder mice, Muc4 RNA expression levels mimicked the allelic effects 71 of the QTL with PWK/PhJ mice exhibiting low Muc4 RNA levels (Fig. 1C ). Other potential 72 targets included Lrrc33, Sec22a, Parp14, and Ildr1; however, these genes either have little 73 known linkage to viral replication and the immune response (e.g., Lrrc33, Sec22a, and Ildr1) or 74 the directionality of the correlation did not support their relationship to viral titer in the lung 75 (Parp14). For Muc4, high levels of expression at mucosal surfaces and in various human 76 cancers have been reported (Andrianifahanana et al., 2001; Chaturvedi et al., 2008; Kamikawa 77 et al., 2015) . In addition, Muc4 plays a role in cell and anti-apoptotic signaling (Chaturvedi et al., 78 2008; Funes et al., 2006; Moniaux et al., 2007) . Together, the data suggest that Muc4 may play 79 a role in viral titers at day 4 post SARS-CoV infection. 80 Muc4 drives sex-based difference in weight loss 81 To examine the role of Muc4 during SARS-CoV infection, we utilized Muc4 -/mice 82 (Rowson-Hodel et al., 2018) which have no gross differences in behavior, overall health, size, or 83 lung function, the latter phenotype measured by plethysmography. Muc4 -/and WT control mice 84 were infected with SARS-CoV and examined over a four-day time course. Following infection, a 85 significant sex-based difference in weight loss between Muc4 -/and WT mice was observed 86 (Table S3) . Female Muc4 -/and control were essentially indistinguishable through two DPI (Fig.  87 2A). However, infected Muc4 -/females continued to lose weight through day four, with 42% (6 88 of 14) meeting euthanasia requirements (≥20% weight loss) and another 42% (6 of 14) requiring 89 increased observation (≥10% weight loss). In contrast, the WT mice held static between days 90 two and three and began to recover by day four, with no mice meeting the requirements for 91 euthanasia and only 13% (2 of 15) requiring increased observation by a margin of ≤0.1g. This 92 Muc4-driven difference in weight loss was not observed in male mice following infection with 93 SARS-CoV (Fig. 2B) . 94 Muc4 has minimal impact on viral load 95 Next, the impact of Muc4 -/on SARS-CoV viral load was measured. Lung lobes from 96 male and female Muc4 -/and WT mice were harvested at two DPI, an acute timepoint previously 97 associated with high SARS-CoV titer (Sheahan et al., 2008) , and at four DPI, the timepoint at 98 which the QTL on chromosome 16 was mapped (Gralinski et al., 2015) . Surprisingly, despite 99 trends for higher mean viral loads in Muc4 -/mice on day 2 and day 4, virus titers were not 100 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Similarly, despite differences in 101 weight loss, viral titer in the lung also exhibited no sex effect (Table S3) . Given the distribution 102 of Muc4 in mucosal surfaces, viral load was further interrogated with IHC to determine whether 103 Muc4 might impact viral tropism in a way not readily determined by the measurement of 104 infectious virus per lobe. Upon examining SARS-CoV antigen staining, however, no significant 105 differences in antigen distribution were noted between Muc4 -/and WT mice in either airway or 106 parenchymal staining ( Fig. 3B and 3C ). Together, the results indicated that the loss of Muc4 had 107 minimal impact on SARS-CoV viral load or distribution. female Muc4 -/mice as compared to female WT mice. In contrast, male Muc4 -/mice induced 116 similar damage to male WT mice (Table S1) . 117
