Introduction: Determining the clinical significance of any given sequence variant requires an integrated evaluation of information from multiple genomic data sources, such as variant location mapping, predicted cDNA and amino acid sequence change, minor allele (population) frequency, insilico prediction scores, somatic and germline mutation databases, and comparison with previously identified variants (inhouse knowledgebase). Software tools to visualize the mapping of sequence variant to peptide structure have been developed and used predominantly in research projects. We investigated the scope for applicability of data visualization techniques to assist in the interpretation of sequence variants from NGS-based somatic mutation testing. Methods: We developed a modular, browser-based visualization widget using JavaScript using widely-used, freely-available libraries such as jQuery. The widget can consume publicly-available or custom web services via AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to obtain data for visualization for a variety of annotations. The interactive graphical user interface utilizes HTML, SVG and CSS, and is encapsulated in an HTML element for easy integration with any web application. An application programming interface (API) provides developers with a variety of configuration options for programmatic control over the widget. Intuitive user interface and easy integration into existing clinical workflows were important design considerations. Results: The data visualization widget was successfully incorporated into a clinical variant management and reporting application used at our institution with minimal change in codebase. It rendered an integrated visualization of the variant location, functional domain mapping, and details and prevalence of a variant of interest when compared to in-house knowledgebase or external databases. For example, during review of uncommon or rare somatic variants, the widget provided visual overlay of the existing variant with variants from the COSMIC database while preserving the positional mapping to the functional protein domains. During routine clinical case workup, it minimized the requirement for separate review of multiple data sources such as pFam, uniprot, COSMIC and other data sources. Conclusions: Data visualization is powerful approach for presenting and interpreting complex genomic data, in clinical as well as research settings. We developed a modular, browser-based widget, which was easily configurable and incorporated into our existing clinical application. Integrated data visualization provided a novel and valuable user experience for variant interpretation, especially with high test volumes. Introduction: Somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) have significant diagnostic and prognostic value in many types of cancer, including glioblastoma (GBM). SCNAs are often identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), but massively parallel sequencing (MPS) can also be used to infer copy number based on read depth. It is, however, challenging to predict SCNAs from targeted re-sequencing of limited gene panels due to uneven coverage of the genome and variation in the efficiency of molecular baits, particularly when no matched normal control is available. Methods: Fifty-four GBM specimens (tumor cellularity ranging from 60 to 97%, average 84%) were subjected to MPS following enrichment of a 516kb target by hybrid capture at Genomics and Pathology Services at Washington University. Target space encompassed the coding regions of 131 genes, selected introns, and a tiled 35kb genomic backbone spaced at 10Mb across all chromosomes. Alignment files generated within the clinically validated pipeline were fed to CNVkit for copy number prediction using both on-and off-target reads. Fifteen cases with no discernable SCNAs were included as an averaged control for normalization. Results were compared with FISH profiles to determine accuracy. Results: Using standard parameters, CNVkit performed robustly on the assay, providing fine resolution of ontarget regions and as well as a broad view of the entire genome. Polysomy of chromosome 7 was detected from MPS data in 45 of 54 GBMs, including 19 of 20 cases with focal EGFR amplification (7p11.2). All cases with EGFR amplification also showed monosomy of chromosome 10 and focal loss of CDKN2A (9p21.3), whereas these aberrations were found in 68% and 56% of cases with unamplified EGFR, respectively. TERTpromoter mutations were common in both EGFR-amplified and unamplified GBM (69% of all cases), whereas TP53 mutations were more common in cases with unamplified EGFR (65% versus 5%). MPS-based detection of focal EGFR amplifications was concordant with FISH in the 39 cases tested with jmd.amjpathol.org â–  The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics both methods. Conclusions: Overall, massive amplifications (e.g., EGFR) were detected with greater accuracy from MPS data compared to lower copy number polysomies and single copy loss. Factors influencing the reliability of SCNA predictions include the quality/quality of input DNA, tumor cellularity, and tumor heterogeneity. The DNA reference material was tested by NGS using Ion Ampliseq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2. All 15 mutations were detected. The allele frequencies of mutations could be modulated by mixing engineered cells with wild-type GM24385 cells; a dilution series generated 15%, 7%, and 4% target allele frequencies (AF). Mutation frequencies for the 15% target AF material ranged from 9.6% for ERBB2 p.A775_G776insYVMA to 15.8% for EGFR p.T790M. The RNA reference material was tested by ArcherDx FusionPlex Lung Thyroid Panel, and all twelve fusions were detected as "strong evidence" fusions (per Archer Analysis Software v3.3). There was a ten-fold range observed in the detection levels: SLC34A2-ROS1 had only 34 unique, spanning reads, whereas FGFR3-TACC3 had 328. These differences in breakpoint-spanning reads on NGS were very consistent from one lot of the reference material to the next, and were also observed for digital PCR analysis. One possible explanation is sequence-specific damage caused by formalin fixation. Testing was also successful on the Thermo Fisher OncoMine Focus Assay and Ion Ampliseq RNA Fusion Lung Cancer Research Panel. Conclusions: Highly multiplexed, cellular reference materials with a well characterized background (GM24385) are needed to monitor the whole process of both RNA and DNA NGS tumor profiling assays and to aid in assay optimization and verification of lower detection limits. The ability to create multiple synthetic DNA mutation or RNA fusion targets enables clinical laboratories to ensure their assays perform appropriately even when the variants are rarely observed in the laboratory. The histologic grading of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms into low grade and high grade groups identifies patients with distinct prognosis. The molecular alterations that define these unique subsets, however, are less wellknown. Previous studies were controversial as to the role of GNAS mutations and loss of SMAD4 by immunohistochemistry in correlating with tumor grade. We explored characteristic molecular alterations between two histological groups of appendiceal mucinous neoplasm and their association with overall survival. Methods: Seventy-four surgical resections of primary appendiceal mucinous neoplasms underwent mutation analysis by next-generation sequencing between 2012 and 2015 at MD Anderson Cancer Center. These tumors, classified by degree of differentiation following the WHO grading system, consisted of 21 low grade tumors and 53 high-grade tumors. Substitutions as well small insertions and deletions in 50 cancer-associated genes were reviewed using next-generation sequencing-based AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot panel v2. We analyzed frequently identified somatic mutations in appendiceal mucinous neoplasms and their association with tumor grade. Results: Tumor grade was significantly associated with GNAS mutations, KRAS and GNAS co-mutation, and TP53 mutations. Low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms harbored more frequent GNAS mutations (71%), either alone or in combination with KRAS (67%) than high-grade tumors (30% and 21%, respectively; p<0.01). In contrast, high-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms had more frequent TP53 mutations (34%) than low-grade tumors (0%; p=0.002). SMAD4 mutations were found in seven high-grade tumor (13%) and three low-grade tumors (14%); the frequencies of SMAD 4 mutations was not associated with tumor grade (p=1.0). Patients with KRAS and GNAS co-mutation showed a better overall survival than patients without these co-mutations (log-rank test; hazard ratio 0.164; 95% confidence interval, 0.0627 0.8765; p=0.04). Conclusions: Low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms have different molecular alterations such as frequent GNAS mutations and co-mutation with KRAS compared to high grade tumors, which harbor frequent TP53 mutations. Identification of these mutations in appendiceal mucinous neoplasms may be helpful as useful diagnostic markers to aid in the distinguishing of these two clinically important subsets. Introduction: NGS is used extensively in research for the molecular characterization of cancer. This has primarily focused on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples, the use of which is limited by surgical feasibility, tissue availability and patient preference. An emerging field of study has focused on circulating-free DNA (cfDNA), sometimes termed "Liquid Biopsy." These fragments of DNA are released by the tumor mass into the circulatory system, and their mutational information can often shed light on tumor characteristics. Although accepting it has the potential to be a valuable source of clinical information during diagnosis, treatment and monitoring for disease recurrence, the liquid biopsy field is still nascent, and lacks an integrated NGS workflow solution with proven performance. Methods: QIAGEN is an established expert in the field of sample preparation for liquid biopsy. The combination of the QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit with the GeneReader NGS System and the GeneRead QIAact Actionable Insights Tumor Panel provides the first true Sample to Insight workflow solution for analyzing cfDNA. A set of 16 liquid biopsy samples from non-small cell lung cancer patients and cfDNA reference standards (Horizon), with allelic frequency at or above 1%, were used for this study. DNA was extracted from the liquid biopsy samples using the QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit. The reference standards did not require extraction and were used to confirm detection of low frequency variants (typical of cfDNA samples). cfDNA from the liquid biopsy samples and reference standards were run through the complete QIAGEN GeneReader workflow, including a new QIAGEN Clinical Insight (QCI ) Analyze bioinformatics pipeline developed specifically for liquid biopsy applications. Results: Analysis of the 16 liquid biopsy samples for EGFR-associated mutations, designed to assess system performance on biological samples, identified seven to be EGFR mutation positive (either L858R or deletion mutations) that were verifiable using PCR based technologies. Testing of the fully characterized cfDNA reference standards identified all mutations covered by the Actionable Insights Tumor Panel, with 100% consistence with those reported in ddPCR studies. Both single nucleotide and insertion-deletion variants were correctly identified down to a 1% allele frequency threshold. Conclusions: These data show that high sensitivity and high performance consistency have been achieved with both cfDNA reference standards and liquid biopsy samples with the complete QIAGEN GeneReader workflow for liquid biopsy. This is the first study of its kind to systematically demonstrate the accuracy of a liquid biopsy assay combined with the robustness of a fully integrated NGS system. Introduction: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease, often presenting with metastasis at diagnosis. Several genetic mutations as well as alterations of miRNA expression have been described in PDAC, however it is unclear how these alterations contribute to metastatic disease. Our goal in this study was to analyze and compare miRNA expression and NGS sequencing results in metastatic and non-metastatic PDAC. Methods: PDAC samples from twenty-four patients were analyzed. Five cases were excluded because of inadequate tissue. Eleven cases were from patients with metastatic disease (M:F = 2:9; age 60.4Â±8.1 years). Eight cases were from patients without metastasis (M:F = 1:1; age 73.1Â±6.9 years). For each sample, seven unstained FFPE tissue sections were used for miRNA extraction using the miRNeasy FFPE Kit (Qiagen). Expression of miRs was evaluated using the TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied jmd.amjpathol.org â–  The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics Biosystems) with primers specific for RNU6B (internal control), miR-10b, miR-21, miR-148a, miR-196a and miR-217. Real-time PCR was performed on the AB 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. The expression level of each miRNA was calculated using the formula log2 (2 -). For NGS, DNA was extracted from eight FFPE slides, and quantified using the PicoGreen method. Sequencing was then performed using the IonTorrent PGM on 318v2 chips. Variants were annotated using GoldenHelix SVS software 8.3.4. Results: Metastatic sites included lung (4 cases), liver (3 cases), abdominal wall/peritoneum (3 cases), and bone (1 case). The miRs in both metastatic and non-metastatic groups had similar expression patterns: miR-10b (underexpressed), miR-21 (overexpressed), miR-148a (inconsistent), miR-196a (underexpressed), and miR-217 (underexpressed). Seven cases failed QC for NGS, three due to DNA concentration and/or quality, and four failed qPCR. Like miR expression, NGS results were similar among metastatic and non-metastatic groups. Tumors from both groups contained KRAS (5 cases), TP53 (4 cases), CDKN2A (2 cases), and APC (2 cases). One case of non-metastatic disease showed a RET mutation. Of metastatic disease, one case each showed a SMAD4 mutation, and a JAK3 mutation. Three cases were wild-type. Conclusions: Expression patterns of miR-10b, miR-21, miR-148a, miR-196a, and miR-217 in PDAC were not predictive of distant metastasis. Similarly, NGS results revealed a variety of variants in both patients with and without metastasis. No correlation was seen between variant(s) and miRNA expression pattern. Studies evaluating the genetic basis for metastasis may lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer.  R. Ruiz-Cordero, A. Khanna, G. Lyons, R. Bassett, M.

Introduction: Comprehensive molecular profiling of lung adenocarcinomas (LADC) has identified three different molecular subtypes: terminal respiratory unit (TRU) based on EGFR, proximal-inflammatory (PI) based on TP53, and proximalproliferative (PP) based on KRAS mutations. Herein we correlate results of FISH and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) in LADC cytology samples to stratify by these molecular subtypes. Methods: LADC patients with fine needle aspirations between May 2010 and October 2015 for diagnosis and staging were identified to collect demographic, clinical, FISH (ALK, ROS1, MET) and NGS data. Frequency tables with number of patients and proportions for categorical variables. To assess relationship between the molecular subtypes and age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, vital and aneuploidy statuses, cross-tabulations and Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used. Results: 283 LADC patients were included (mean age=65y, female=53%, Caucasian=76%, Asian=9%, other=14%, current/former smokers=77%, Alive=65%). 82% of cases were run on NGS, 14.5% on Sanger or Pyrosequencing platforms and 3.5% did not have molecular data. NGS yielded positive mutations in 93% of cases with TP53 (43%), KRAS (34%), and EGFR (25%) being the most frequently mutated genes. Molecular results showed TRU=14%, PI=16% and PP=16%, EGFR/TP53 and TP53/KRAS co-mutation=19%, other genes mutated=12%, no mutations detected=18%. In keeping with the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (TCGA) results, we also found that TRU subtype is more frequent in Asian women (p=0.01) and never-smokers (p<0.0001), while least associated with ALK/ROS1/MET positive tumors (p=0.0089). The PI subtype did not show any significant differences by ethnicity (p=0.90), gender (p=0.18), smoking (p=0.17), vital status (p=0.74), or FISH results (p=0.12); however this group had a significantly higher number of cases with aneuploidy and ALK/ROS1/MET positivity (p=0.0012). The PP subtype was significantly associated with Caucasian women (p=0.003) and smokers (p=0.0002), but was not associated with ALK/ROS1/MET positivity (p=0.0161) or aneuploidy (p=0.61). Among patients with mutations detected by NGS, about 25% were deceased, compared with 76% of patients with no mutations detected by our NGS panel (p=0.0135). Conclusion: Our study confirms that cytology specimens are suitable for FISH and molecular testing. Whereas the clinical significance of aneuploid cells found in FISH in cases of LADC is not completely understood, aneuploidy seems to be associated to the PI molecular subtype. Our results confirm previous associations identified by TCGA as well as new additional information. Further studies evaluating the possible worse scenario of NGS-mutation-negative patients are in progress to corroborate this finding. With this method, we evaluate the 95% CI of NIPS PPV for trisomies 13, 18, and 21 (T13/18/21) . Sampling all parameters shows that CI breadth mostly varies by maternal age (MA): for example, the CI width for T21 is +/-11% at MA=20yr down to +/-4% at MA=40yr. Low mean PPV for T13 and T18 leads to asymmetric CIs: the T13 PPV CI at MA=20yr and gestational age (GA) 12 weeks has a lower bound 13% below the mean of 20.8% but an upper bound 23% above the mean. All CIs are dominated by SPEC uncertainty: at MA=20yr, the T21 CI is +/-10.5% when sampling only over SPEC, +/-4% using only prevalence, and +/-0.1% sampling only SENS. We repeated the analysis using SENS and SPEC from a smaller (N=3,322) study (Porreco RP, et al. 2014) . As expected, at MA=20yr GA=12wk the mean T21 PPVs using parameters from the meta-analysis or the smaller study are similar, but the CI using the meta-analysis is much tighter (+/-12.6% vs +/-32.9%). Conclusions: Our results show that larger meta-analyses of NIPS specificity could narrow the PPV confidence interval two-fold for T21 or fourfold for T13 and T18 (motivating outcome data sharing among laboratories), but that additional gestational prevalence data will then be needed to further improve the precision of PPV estimates. The utility of providing PPV is well-justified even with the estimated CI. This work further demonstrates the need to use large meta-analyses to establish sensitivity and specificity rather than smaller individual studies.
