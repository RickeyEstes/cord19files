TBHQ Inhibits the Entry of H3 and H7 HA Previously, our groups have shown that pseudovirus containing envelope proteins from Ebola, HIV, Influenza and SARS-CoV on a background of HIV core proteins are useful surrogates for infectious virus [31] , [32] , [33] , [34] . As noted above, the small molecule TBHQ has been reported to inhibit H3 HA-mediated influenza entry [17] , [28] , a Group 2 HA that is phylogenetically related to H7 HA. Accordingly, we first tested the inhibitory properties of TBHQ using pseudovirions containing H3 HA. As shown by Figure 1 , TBHQ inhibits H3 HA-mediated entry with an IC50,7 mM (purple triangles), which is in agreement with the previously reported IC50 for inhibition of H3 influenza infection [17] , [28] . Next, we tested the inhibitory properties of TBHQ using pseudovirions containing H7 HA. As shown by Figure 1 , TBHQ inhibits H7 HA-mediated entry with an IC50,6 mM (black squares). In a next step, specificity to HA is shown by the lack of detectable inhibition for VSVG-mediated entry, pseudovirion containing an unrelated envelope protein ( Figure 1 , red circles, [31] , [32] , [33] , [34] . Finally, the toxicity of TBHQ was determined to be CC50.100 mM as shown in Figure 1 (blue triangles). Taken together, these experiments show that the small molecule TBHQ inhibits H7 HA-mediated entry with a similar potency to that of influenza H3 infection.
