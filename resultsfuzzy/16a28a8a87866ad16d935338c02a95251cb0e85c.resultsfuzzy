The 3D Jury system found three significant hits (3D scoreO90) which have a similar fold to ORF3 (threading Naturally, a question arises: what information about ORF3's function we can get from its 3D structure? The above three templates (1LVL, 3GRS and 1GES), which belong a FAD/NAD-linked reductase family, lead us to the speculation that ORF3 may be a protein related to FAD/NAD-binding. This seems consistent with the speculation that ORF3 may encode a protein related to Table 1 The sequence alignment between ORF3 and 1LVL and the secondary structure ATP-binding [1] , because FAD/NAD is generally used as an oxidant to yield ATP [9] . In order to collect as many evidence as possible for such a speculation, we employed VAST, DALI and CE to search the structure neighbors of ORF3. We found that the top hits, except the above templates, focus on the following dehydrogenases (also belong to the FAD/NAD-linked reductase family): 1OJT (lipoamide dehydrogenase from bacterium Neisseria meningitides), 1JEH (lipoamide dehydrogenase from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae), 1LPF (lipoamide dehydrogenase from bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens), 1EBD (dehydrolipoamide dehydrogenase from bacterium Bacillus stearothermophilus), and 1DXL (lipoamide dehydrogenase from pea Pisum sativum). The superpositions between these enzymes and ORF3 are shown in Fig. 2 . It can be seen from the revised structure alignment (Fig. 3 ) that there are a number of similar structural patterns showing conservative residues (bold representation). In particular, among them are partially conserved FAD-bind motif (marked as '#') and NAD-binding motif (marked as '$') [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . This suggests that there could be a link between ORF3 and FAD/NAD-binding protein indeed. Finally, the non-canonical interactions in ORF3 protein structure were identified by NCI program and the results showed that there are three pairs of main chain-side chain interactions: Tyr160 (donor) and Phe43 (acceptor), Phe43 (donor) and Tyr206 (acceptor), and Ile232 (donor) and Phe231 (acceptor). Among these interactions, Phe43 forms two N-H/p bonds in a sandwich fashion: one donates to Tyr206, and one donated by Tyr160, as existed in human rac1 [15] and SARS-CoV main protease [16] . These noncanonical bindings fix the big helix Phe43 locate to the two loops Tyr160 and Tyr206 locate, hence stabilizes the structure of ORF3 protein (Fig. 4) . These results can be used for rational design of mutagenesis experiments and analysis of conservation of interactions at functional sites. In recent years, the non-canonical interactions have been shown to be important for the stability of protein structure [17] [18] [19] and ligand recognition [20] .
