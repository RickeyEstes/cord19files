3.1. Molecular cloning and the structure of porcine CLEC4G cDNA and gene To identify the porcine homologue of human CLEC4G, a series of sequence similarity searches in the GenBank database were performed. A porcine cDNA sequence with the GenBank accession number AK232603 that shared significant sequence homology with human CLEC4G cDNA was identified. Based on this sequence, we designed gene-specific primers and then successfully amplified a 909-bp fragment containing the complete coding region of pCLEC4G cDNA from pig liver by RT-PCR (Fig. 1) . In addition, a smaller fragment representing a pCLEC4G isoform lacking the transmembrane domain (807 bp) was also identified (Fig. 1 ). Besides these two isoforms, a series of higher-molecular-weight bands were amplified (Fig. 1) , which are recognized as the intermediate products of pCLEC4G pre-mRNA during splicing (see discussion below). The pCLEC4G gene (2721 bp), which was not available on the public draft assembly of pig genome project in the early 2008, was also cloned by using the genomic PCR with the same pair of PCR primers (Fig. 1 ). As illustrated in Fig. 2a , the pCLEC4G gene is encoded by nine exons spanning the complete coding region of the gene in which the exact sizes of the exons 1 and 9 are not yet known. The sequence of all the nine exons was identical to that of the cloned 909-bp cDNA as well as to the pCLEC4G EST, indicating the authenticity of the cloned gene. The sizes of eight introns vary from 110 to 320 bp, and the sequences of all acceptors and donors on the introns conform to the GT-AG rule. Like other type II C-type lectins, the putative coding region of pCLEC4G encodes four domains, CT, TMD, neck and CRD, from the amino-to the carboxyl-terminus (Fig. 2b) . The 3 0 -end of exon 1 and the 5 0 -end of exon 2 encode the CT. The remaining part of exon 2 encodes the TMD. The neck region spans the entire exons 3-6 and the first 5 nucleotides (nt) of exon 7. The rest of the exon 7, the entire exon 8 and the 5 0 -end of the exon 9 encode the CRD (Fig. 2a) . During the preparation of this manuscript, a S. scrofa chromosome 2 clone CH242-334A8 (working draft sequence; GenBank accession number CU929919) without any assigned gene loci was released on September 24, 2008. Our cloned pCLEC4G gene sequence is nearly identical to the sequence between nucleotides 148,895 and 146,200 (minus strand) on this clone. However, there exists a gap with unknown length in this region of the clone corresponding to the 3 0 -partial intron 7, the complete exon 8 and the 5 0 -partial intron 8, which has determined in our cloned pCLEC4G gene (data not shown).
