Through the years, we have identified certain antimicrobial susceptibility results that are misinterpreted by clinicians. Such misinterpretation leads to additional but unnecessary testing (eg, "special MIC") or use of alternative antibiotics. The AS team and microbiology laboratory have developed supporting guidance incorporated within test results to overcome these issues. Examples of comments included in test results are listed in Table 6 . Furthermore, special or extrasusceptibility testing must be approved by a member of the AS team.
