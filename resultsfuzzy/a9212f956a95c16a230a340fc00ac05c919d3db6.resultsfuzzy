From the survey results, we found that local ethnic groups have the strongest ties to bushmeat consumption, particularly the Minahasa and Sangir tribes, which constitute the majority of vendors (97%) and buyers of flying foxes (85%). North Sulawesi is one the few provinces in Indonesia with a Christian majority, and individuals strongly maintain their identity by using different religious beliefs as indicators. One way in which this difference manifests itself is through the lack of dietary restrictions for Christians, and the consumption of bushmeat is seen as reinforcement of one's identification as part of the group. Locals believe that during holidays or other special occasions (e.g. birthdays, weddings), they should serve several types of ''unique meat'' (daging unik) to enliven the atmosphere. Despite its name, ''unique meat'' belies the level of abundance and ubiquity at which it occurs in the market. ''Unique meat'' encompasses any kind of meat not available through domestication (e.g. beef, pork, chicken, duck) and refers to wild animals such as: endemic black macaques (Macaca nigra), pythons from Kalimantan (Python reticulatus or P. curtus) (Stuebing, 1991) , water monitors (Varanus salvator), Sulwaesi wild pigs (Sus celebensis) (Milner-Gulland and Clayton, 2002) , and Bornean bearded pigs (Sus barbatus). Species are valued by rarity, and occasionally available in the market in limited quantities. Flying foxes are commonly found in the market, making them considerably cheaper and more accessible than these other types of ''unique meat''. The price of other bushmeat varies from Rp 20,000 to 60,000 (US$2.00 to $6.00), depending on the season, market, and availability of stock. These ''unique meats'' can only be found in North Sulawesi, making it the iconic local delicacy of the province. According to the vendor survey responses, approximately 30-50 kg of flying foxes are sold each day, with an increase to 100-300 kg on Saturdays and Mondays. The average weight of P. alecto is 674 g (Churchill, 2008) , equivocating that to about 45-75 individuals sold per day and 150-445 individuals sold during the Saturday and Mondays. Flying foxes are sold both by weight and by individual with a high variance in price (Rp 7500-45,000 or US$0.75 to $4.50) corresponding to individual size. All of the vendors indicated in the responses that they earned over Rp 30,000,000 (∼US$3000) annually, and this was the major form of income for them. Though they also stated that exact amounts were difficult to recall and may vary between vendors, by their estimates, they had a net income of Rp 50,000,000 (∼US$5000) annually. Exact financial data were not available from Harrison et al. (2011) , but in both their study and ours, selling flying foxes was the major source of income for vendors (Harrison et al., 2011) . Comparison to prices in the past cannot be made, as Lee et al. (2005) did not address income earned. Peaks in bat trade coincide with special occasions, potentially reaching 300 kg/day. The highest intensity is in December as part of Christmas and New Year festivities (60%-70%). While more people consumed a single bat daily, the overall volume of bats consumed was higher during religious celebrations (Table 1 ). Significant increases in consumption coinciding with holidays suggested that peak consumption was tied to celebration of religious events, as respondents cited the holidays specifically. A secondary peak occurs during the months of June through August, which coincides with local celebrations of Blessing Day (Pengucapan Syukur), a traditional harvest holiday with varying dates between areas. A minor increase in consumption may also occur around Easter. Locals also believe that eating the liver and heart of flying fox can cure asthma. Very few people were deterred from eating bats due to their smell or appearance and viewed bats as a reliable protein source. Local villagers consider flying foxes clean animals because they live in the forest and only eat fruits. All respondents eat bats at least once a month and showed no preference towards any particular sex or species for consumption (Table 1) . The local villagers expressed that they would not feel any negative feelings, such as anger or disappointment, if they could not eat bats, but it is normalized in their current behavior because it is so readily available. Because of this availability, locals are unaware of the impact of consumption on natural habitats. Based on the awareness survey, local villagers have a significantly different understanding of the bats as compared to university students (Fisher's Exact Test, p < 0.05) (Fig. 2) . Students are aware of the ecological role of flying foxes, and express that it was important to initiate conservation action, whereas the locals do not. However, students do not know very much about the specifics of the species nor the bushmeat trade (importing mechanism, severity of trade, impact of hunting, number consumed). Neither group has any awareness of the potential disease risk that the bushmeat trade poses.
