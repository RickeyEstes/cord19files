Identification and characterisation of Ae. aegypti lincRNAs In total, 3,482 putative lincRNAs in 1,114 Ae. aegypti genome scaffolds were identified (S2 Table) . The Ae. aegypti lincRNA genes displayed a slightly lower GC content (mean: 40.1%) in comparison to 47.8% in their protein-coding gene sequences (Fig 2A) . The lower GC content or AT enrichment is a typical characteristic of lincRNAs and our findings are congruent with predicted lincRNAs in other species [14, 39, 40] . The majority of Ae. aegypti predicted lincRNAs are smaller than 3000 bases and their length distribution is represented in Fig 2B. These mosquito lincRNA candidates are notably shorter in length than protein-coding genes, demonstrating another well-known characteristic of lincRNA transcripts (Fig 2C) [41, 42] . The majority of Ae. aegypti genome scaffolds contain less than five lincRNA loci (~80%), however, 23 of scaffolds (2%) were enriched with more than 10 lincRNAs (Fig 2D) . The detailed information of these scaffolds, which contain the highest number of lincRNAs are summarized in Table 1 . We examined all the identified lincRNAs to determine their association with Ae. aegypti miRNA precursors and piRNA clusters. We found that the pre-miRNA sequences of aae-miR-2940 and aae-miR-285 are located in lincRNAs 1431 and 3299, respectively. We could not detect any other pre-miRNA sequences identified in Ae. aegypti in the lincRNAs. Also, lincRNA 1978 and 792 are originated from two previously reported piRNA clusters [43] located at supercontig 1.478 and 1.98, respectively. LincRNAs demonstrate low evolutionary sequence conservation even among closely related species [10, 14] . We used the BLAST algorithm bit score to identify the level of similarity among Ae. aegypti lincRNA sequences with other closely related insect genomes such as Aedes albopictus, Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles gambiae ( Fig 3A) . As expected, most of the identified lincRNAs showed high level of similarity with Ae. albopictus genome sequence and probably are genus specific. The E-value cut off 10 âˆ’50 was applied to our screening with the BLAST algorithm to identify the conserved sequences. Although the Ae. aegypti lincRNAs shared high level of sequence similarity with the genome of Ae. albopictus, only 62 and 7 lincR-NAs had sequence similarity with Cx. quinquefasciatus and An. gambiae, respectively (Fig 3B) . They were mostly limited to a single short region with high conservation.
