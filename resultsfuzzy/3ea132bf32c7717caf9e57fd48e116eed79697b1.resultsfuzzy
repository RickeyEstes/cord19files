Biopanning to identify phages bearing specific peptides to bovine rotavirus In the past, immunoglobulins have been used to treat rotavirus diarrhea, nevertheless, application of immunoglobulins is relatively expensive and their side-effects are uncertain [14] . It is also reported that compounds isolated from the roots of G. uralensis may be potent anti-rotavirus agents in vivo [15] , however, their antiviral effects have not been evaluated clinically. In vaccination, although progress has been made in the development of live, attenuated oral vaccines, improved vaccines are still needed, particularly in developing countries due to the unsatisfactory effect of those vaccines [16] . At present, effective diagnostic tests for screening viruses are important for prevention of BRV. Phage display technology is a good approach for ligand identification of targets and phage-displayed peptides from combinatorial libraries that interacting with hepatitis B virus, adenovirus type 2, Andes virus, Sin Nombre virus, Hantaan virus, Avian H5N1 Virus and coronavirus have been selected [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . In this study, we used the BRV as an immobilized target followed by biopanning process using a 12-mer phage display peptide library to select ligands to this virus. Because the viruses were harvested from the cells, we performed a subtract panning to decrease potential reaction background. Additionally, we gradually increased concentration of Tween 20 to improve the specificity of biopanning. The results showed that the titer of the eluted phages was increased gradually (data not shown). After the last panning, twelve phage clones that were able to bind to BRV were identified by ELISA, in contrast, the control phages had a negligible binding ability to this virus ( Figure 1 ).
