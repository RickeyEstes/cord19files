The above results indicate that cathepsin B inhibits the CD4independent mNDK vector infection in cells with high cathepsin B activity. To confirm that cathepsin B inhibits the CD4-independent vector infection, the effects of cathepsin B overexpression on the CD4independent vector infection were analyzed in 293T cells, in which cathepsin B is expressed at a low level. 293T cells were inoculated with an MLV vector encoding cathepsin B and puromycin-resistance genes, and were selected by puromycin. The puromycin-resistant 293T cell pool indeed had elevated level of cathepsin B activity compared to the control 293T cells (Fig. 7A) . The cathepsin B overexpression significantly inhibited the CD4-independent vector infection, but did not the CD4-dependent infection (Fig. 7B) . When the cathepsin Boverexpressing 293T cells were treated with CA-074Me at 25 mM, the CD4-independent vector infection was enhanced (Fig. 7C) , as in HeLa and TE671 cells. These results suggest that cathepsin B is a host defense factor against the CD4-independent infection, but not against the CD4-dependent infection.
