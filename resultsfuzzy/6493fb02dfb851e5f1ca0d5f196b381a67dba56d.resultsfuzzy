We identified the c-myc-gene in all analysed samples. between 55% and 81% when the swab was taken between 0 and 6 days (Figure 2 ). Between 1 day and 4 days, it was between 71% and 81%, respectively. Confidence intervals from day 4 onwards were large due to small numbers. Although PR varied by week of symptom onset between 0% and 100%, it reached 50% in most weeks and was not statistically significantly different during the PIC (Figure 3 ; upper left).
