Four hundred fifty-three subjects were enrolled in the study between An inverse relationship between serum RSV antibody levels and incidence of RSV-MARI was observed ( Figure 2 ). Higher antibody levels to each of the RSV antigens were associated with a lower incidence of RSV-MARI, and the relationship was most clearly seen in season 2 possibly due to more subjects with RSV-MARI and available serology in season 2 versus season 3 (20 vs 8, respectively). Season 1 was not included because subjects were being enrolled throughout the year, and preseason blood was not available for many subjects. In addition to the 42 subjects with per protocol RSV-MARI, an additional 57 RSV infections were also identified. Of these, 55 had For all viruses, the addition of sputum testing resulted in (11.8%-50.0%) increased viral detections during illness (Table 3) . for severe illness and hospitalizations in prior studies. 6, 7, [18] [19] [20] However, in our population of adults with Class III/IV COPD and CHF, it was surprising that illnesses were not as severe as expected. In a previous study of high-risk adults with COPD and CHF of varying stages including mild or moderate disease, the rate of RSV-MARI was 4.40/100 person-seasons, similar to the rate of 4.68 observed in this study. 2 In that study, 16% of high-risk patients were hospitalized and 4% died when infected with RSV. When all RSV infections, including serologic diagnoses in this study, were considered, 17% of RSV-infected subjects were hospitalized and there were no deaths. Notably, 35% of infected patients either were asymptomatic or had a mild illness that did not require any medical intervention. Regular exposure to children required for participation in this study may have led to higher infection rates (7%-14.6%) compared with those observed in previous surveillance and vaccine studies (2%-3%). 21, 22 One explanation for lack of severe illness in this very frail population might be that regular exposure to children resulted in recent RSV infections before the study leading to increased protective baseline immunity. 23 attention. Influenza with abrupt illness onset and fever tends to drive patients to seek medical attention within several days. 5 The typical RSV illness begins with a cold and progresses over several days to dyspnea and wheezing. The average time to seek medical attention is 5-6 days by which time virus may no longer be detectable in the upper airways. 33, 34 In addition, because RSV infection in adults represents reinfection, a rapid amnestic antibody response may obscure a rise in antibody if acute sera collection is delayed. Finally, because the analysis of acute and convalescent sera is not possible in patients that die, results may have been biased toward milder illness. In summary, RSV, as well as other respiratory viruses, led to significant morbidity in high-risk persons with cardiopulmonary disease. The finding that RSV can result in relatively mild disease in patients with very advanced COPD and CHF highlights the incomplete understanding of disease pathogenesis in adults. Given our results, immunoprophylaxis with an RSV monoclonal antibody of a select high-risk adult population may not be practical. However, given the overall burden of RSV in older adults, programs to develop vaccines for active immunization may be a feasible approach.
