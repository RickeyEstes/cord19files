In the experiments conducted in this research, 27 kinds of gait patterns were identified by experienced experts who specialize in prosthesis training. 912 gait training patterns were collected from the leg-amputees during real gait training process and were classified by an expert. The classification accuracy ratio was computed by using the leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) technique [31] to examine the effectiveness of the proposed training system. Notably, the LOOCV method removes a single sample in each trial, trains on the rest, and then tests the classifier on the removed single sample. The classification results are given in Table 1 . It can be seen that, in average, accuracy ratio of the proposed training system is 89.0716%, the testing root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.1307, and the its standard deviation (DEV) is 3.86%. It implies that the proposed prosthesis training system not only detects the movements of leg-amputees, but also classifies most of the gait patterns correctly. Meanwhile, the performance of the three compared classifiers is about the same. Notably, the computation time comparison for the three classifiers, as shown in Table 2 , reveals that the computation time required for both the training and the testing stage is insignificant for FLNNs. The simulation results thus exhibit the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed prosthesis training system.
