Strain P11-23B was isolated from a marine mud sample and assigned as Streptomyces sp. P11-23B based on the analysis of its 16S rDNA gene sequence, which matched (99% identity for a 1361 bp stretch of sequence) those of seven Streptomyces strains (Supplementary Data, Figure S 1 and Table S 1 ). Culture of this marine actinomycete was grown in Gause's liquid medium (50.0 L). The extract prepared from the culture of P11-23B showed significant activity against the proliferation of human glioma cells with inhibitions of 87.17% for glioma U87-MG cells and 86.84% for U251 cells. Separation of this active extract by ODS column chromatography, following by HPLC purification, afforded three compounds 1e3. Compound 1 was proved to be the known cyclodepsipeptide valinomycin based on its NMR and HRESIMS data, melting point, optical rotation value, the analysis of its acidic hydrolysates by chiral HPLC and GC analyses, and the comparison with literature data (Pettit et al., 1999; Tabeta and Saito, 1985) . Valinomycin (1) was previously isolated from several Streptomyces species (Heisey et al., 1988; Lim et al., 2007; Park et al., 2008; Pettit et al., 1999) and is well known to enhance the K þ permeability of several membrane systems including mitochondria, erythrocytes, and lipid bilayers (Bhattacharyya et al., 1971; Haynes et al., 1969) . This cyclodepsipeptide was also reported to have activities against tumors, bacteria, fungi (Lim et al., 2007; Park et al., 2008; Pettit et al., 1999) , and severe acute respiratory-syndrome coronavirus (Wu et al., 2004) . Valinomycin (1) is composed of four units of D-valine (D-Val), L-valine (L-Val), D-a-hydroxyisovaleric acid (D-Hiv), and Llactate (L-Lac) with a trimer structure of cyclo-(D-Val-L-Lac-L-Val-D-Hiv) 3 . For its 13 C and 1 H NMR spectroscopic data assignments, see Table S 2 (Supplementary Data) . It was noted that each of the four units displayed characteristic NMR signals, which allowed for differentiation of the four units. The unit L-Lac was easily recognized by its NMR signals of d C 172.7 (C-1), 70.4 (C-2), 17.3 (C-3) and d H 5.32 (1H, q, J ¼ 7.0 Hz, H-2) and 1.44 (3H, d, J ¼ 7.0 Hz, H-3), while D-Hiv had its characteristic signals of d C 171.0 (C-1), 78.7 (C-2), 30.4 (C-3), 16.8 (C-4) and d H 5.02 (1H, d, J ¼ 3.11 Hz, H-2). The D-Val and L-Val could be distinguished from their chemical shifts of C-1, C-2, H-2 and the coupling constant values of 3 J CH-NH . The unit D-Val was indicated by its characteristic NMR signals at d C 170.2 (C-1), 59.1 (C-2) and d H 4.10 (1H, dd, J ¼ 10.0, 8.1 Hz, H-2), 7.88 (1H, d, J ¼ 8.1 Hz, NH-2), as compared with their counterparts of L-Val at d C 172.0 (C-1), 60.6 (C-2) and d H 3.96 (1H, dd, J ¼ 10.2, 6.2 Hz, H-2), 7.80 (1H, d, J ¼ 6.2 Hz, NH-2). All of these characteristic NMR signals mentioned above are very helpful for the structure elucidation of the new compounds of streptodepsipeptides P11A (2) and P11B (3) .16 in the fifth zone was assigned to a methylene (b-CH 2 ). The remaining 20 carbons, which appeared at d C 9.41e19.92 in the sixth zone, were assigned to 20 methyls (g-CH 3 or b-CH 3 ). The 1 H NMR spectrum of 2 also showed six NH signals at d H 7.89 (d, 7.9 Hz), 7.84 (d, 6.0 Hz), 7.83 (d, 8.0 Hz), 7.83 (d, 8.0 Hz), 7.77 (d, 6.2 Hz), and 7.76 (d, 5.8 Hz) . All of the above data suggested that compound 2 was composed of 12 units, including six amide groups (amino acids) and six ester groups. Acid hydrolysis of 2 produced D-Val, L-Val, D-Hiv, L-Lac, D-2-hydroxybutanoic acid (D-Hba) as determined by chiral HPLC and GC analyses using the standard compounds as references. Detailed COSY, HSQC, and HMBC spectroscopic analyses confirmed the presence of 12 units including three L-lactates, three L-valines, three D-valines, two D-a-hydroxyisovaleric acids, and one D-2hydroxybutanoic acid (D-Hba). As shown in Fig. 2 , the a-NH and a-CH protons of each valine had a COSY correlation, while the a-CH proton of each unit displayed a COSY correlation with the b-CH (or b-CH 2 for D-Hba, or b-CH 3 for L-Lac) proton, which was correlated with the g-CH 3 proton. HMBC correlations (see Table 1 and Fig. 2) further supported the structure of each unit. According to the foregoing NMR correlations and the NMR data comparison of The sequence of the 12 units of compound 2 was established based on the following HMBC and NOESY correlations (Table 1 In order to further confirm the locations of L-Val and D-Val, compound 2 was partially hydrolyzed using 3N LiOH to produce three dipeptides of L-Lac-L-Val (2a), D-Hiv-D-Val (2b), and D-Hba-D-Val (2c). The structures ( Fig. 1) of 2a, 2b, and 2c were deduced from their HRESIMS and 1 H NMR data. Further acid hydrolysis of 2a, 2b, and 2c furnished free amino acids of L-Val for 2a and D-Val for 2b and 2c, which were confirmed by chiral HPLC analysis using the standard amino acids as references. The sequence of the 12 units of compound 2 was also supported from the results of MS-MS analysis.

Both compounds 1 and 2 were isolated from strain P11-23B and might have the same overall biosynthetic pathway, suggesting 1 and 2 should have a similar sequence for the 12 units. Based on the above evidence, the structure of 2 was determined as cyclo- , and 20 methyls (d C 16.78e20.03). Acid hydrolysates of 3 were found to be D-Val, L-Val, D-Hiv, and L-Lac as determined by chiral HPLC and GC. Further detailed NMR spectroscopic analysis, in combination with the HRESIMS data, indicated that the structure of 3 was very similar to that of 2, except for another L-Lac moiety in 3 instead of the D-Hba moiety in 2. The 13 C and 1 H NMR data (Table 2) Three isolated cyclodepsipeptides (1e3) were assayed for their activity against the proliferation of four different glioma cell lines by SRB method. The results ( Fig. 3 and Table 3 ) showed that new streptodepsipeptides P11A (2) and P11B (3) had potent activity with IC 50 values of 0.3e0.4 mM for 2 and 0.1e1.4 mM for 3, while known valinomycin (1) showed much stronger antiproliferative activity with IC 50 values ranging from 7.6 to 30.0 nM, probably because of its symmetrical trimer structure (Pettit et al., 1999) . The control doxorubicin (DOX) had activity with IC 50 0.4e3.3 mM. The two new compounds were also tested for activity in inhibiting growth of normal human astrocytes (HA). As shown in Table 3 , the ratios of IC 50 for HA to glioma cells were within the ranges of 23e30 for 2 and 3e35 and for 3. Streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) was also assayed for its ability to arrest the cell cycle and induce apoptosis in glioma cells. Flow cytometric analysis was used to measure the DNA content to determine if an alteration of the cell cycle occurred following the treatment of streptodepsipeptide P11A (2). U87-MG cells were incubated with 0.8 mM streptodepsipeptide P11A (2), DOX (0.8 mM) as positive control, or without compound treatment as negative control (CON) for 12 h and then stained with PI and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. The percentages of each phase in the cell cycle were described in Fig. 4 and Table 4 . Cell population at the G 0 / G 1 phase was significantly increased by 40.92% after the treatment of 12 h, when compared to the control (CON). This alteration indicated that streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) blocked U87-MG cell cycle at the G 0 /G 1 phase. Positive control DOX (0.8 mM) also had a 49.69% increasement of DNA content at the G 0 /G 1 phase. A similar result was also obtained from the streptodepsipeptide P11Atreated U251 cells ( Fig. 4 and Table 4 ). Flow cytometric analysis with annexin V-FITC/PI double staining was applied to quantify the apoptosis induced by streptodepsipeptide P11A (2). After 72 h of treatment, streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) (0.8 mM) caused an increase of 20.40% in total apoptotic cells (early and late apoptotic cells), when compared to the control (CON, Fig. 5 ). Streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) was further investigated for its effects on several important tumor metabolic regulators including HK2 (glycolysis), PFKFB3 (glycolysis), PKM2 (glycolysis), GLS (glutaminolysis), and FASN (lipogenesis). Firstly, the expression levels of HK2, PFKFB3, PKM2, GLS, and FASN in four different glioma cell lines of SHG-44, U87-MG, U251, and C6 were tested by western blot. It has been found that all five tumor metabolic regulators were highly expressed in the U87-MG cells (Fig. 6A) . Thus, the effects of streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) on expression levels of these regulators in the U87-MG cells were evaluated. U87-MG cells were treated by streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) (5 mM or 10 mM) for 48 h. Protein prepared from the streptodepsipeptide P11A-treated U87-MG cells was subjected to western blot analysis. The results (Fig. 6B ) indicated that HK2, PFKFB3, GLS, and FASN were highly down-regulated in the streptodepsipeptide P11A-treated U87-MG cells, when compared to negative control (CON, U87-MG cells Table 3 Activity of streptodepsipeptides P11A (2) and P11B (3) (2) had no obvious effects on ACO2 and ATPB expression levels, but increased the level of Cyto-C. These data suggested that streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) might selectively regulate tumor metabolic regulators of HK2, PFKFB3, PKM2, GLS, and FASN. The increased expression level of Cyto-C also implied that streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) might change the tumor metabolic pathway to the process of oxidative phosphorylation. Valinomycin (1) is known to induce uptake of potassium in membrane of erythrocyte (Bhattacharyya et al., 1971) . Therefore, the ability of streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) to enhance the K þ permeability of human erythrocytes was also evaluated. Human erythrocytes were treated with tested compound (2) or positive control valinomycin (1) for 90 min. The results (Table 5) showed that streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) at concentrations of 0.01 mM, 0.05 mM, and 0.1 mM induced 22.36%, 66.46%, and 86.10% increase of intracellular K þ in erythrocytes, respectively, when compared to the negative control (CON, human erythrocyte without compound treatment). The positive control valinomycin (1) at the same concentrations also enhanced the K þ uptake by 19.06%, 83.43%, and 75.3%, respectively. These data indicated that both valinomycin (1) and streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) had the property to significantly induce uptake of K þ in membrane of erythrocyte. Some small molecular compounds have been reported to have antitumor activity by targeting tumor metabolic regulators, such as hexokinase (HK) inhibitors: 2-deoxyglucose, lonidamine, and 3bromopyruvate; PKM2 inhibitor: shikonin and TLN 232; FANS inhibitors: orlista, cerulenin, and EGCG (Galluzzi et al., 2013; Jones and Schulze, 2012; Menendez and Lupu, 2007) . It was noted that most of these active antitumor agents targeted only one tumor metabolic regulator. Interestingly, streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) had obvious effects on several important tumor metabolic regulators, which were from different metabolic pathways. It has been proposed that modulating multiple targets could be beneficial for prevention and treatment of complex human diseases such as cancer (Bishayee and Block, 2015; Morphy and Rankovic, 2007) . Whether streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) has the potential for developing novel anticancer drug need to be further evaluated.
