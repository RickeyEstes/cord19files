Discrepant results were interpreted by considering the results of the first two assays along with those of the AdvanSure RV assay, as shown in Table 3 . All seven specimens showing positive results for coronavirus with the AdvanSure RV assay were also positive with Anyplex II RV16 but were negative with Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v2. By contrast, specimens that were positive for metapneumovirus (N = 8) or parainfluenza type 3 (N = 4) with the Ad-vanSure RV assay also showed positive results with Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v2 but were negative with Anyplex II RV16 (Table 3 ). Table 4 shows the results of each assay for the viral supernatants of various strains. The three kits had comparable performances for most of the tested strains. However, the Anyplex II RV16 assay was unable to detect adenovirus types 12 and 31, while adenovirus type 18 was not detected by the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay. The AdvanSure RV assay missed detecting three types of adenoviruses (31, 40, and 41), and erroneously typed the enterovirus as a rhinovirus (Table 4) .
