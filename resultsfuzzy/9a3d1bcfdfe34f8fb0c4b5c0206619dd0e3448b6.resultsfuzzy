Because of the highly inhomogeneous land use in the study area, the PLW field near different locations is evaluated separately for the conventional and twisted wind flows. In the analysis, the velocity ratio (VR) is calculated at different test locations such as the perimeter of the site, roadsides and road intersections, and groups of low-, medium-and high-rise buildings. The VR at test locations is used to plot wind rose diagrams for the CWP and CWP-TWPs (combinations of the conventional and twisted wind profiles) and is subsequently employed to calculate the VR w value with the adjusted p values using the three correction methods.
