Many heterologous proteins expressed in E. coli fold improperly and aggregate, leading to the accumulation of inclusion bodies wherein the proteins remain essentially insoluble. Functional VP6 particles from human rotavirus A have been expressed in several eukaryotic vector systems, including animal, insect, and yeast cells. 31,32 A recent study from Zhao et al reported the in vitro assembly into VLPs of the VP6 protein expressed in E. coli. 13 According to their protocol, however, the VP6 protein accumulates in the bacterial cell as insoluble aggregates, and a complicated renaturation process is required to restore the native folding, which is competent to self-assemble in VLPs. As demonstrated by the enormous progress in the optimization of the production of recombinant proteins, the expression level and solubility of proteins may be enhanced by the use of fusion partners that can be cleaved after production. In the present study, we compared the results of the expression in E. coli of VP6 fused to three different affinity tags: hexahistidine, TRX, and SUMO. For all these tags, known to be successful for the expression of difficult targets, we constructed N-terminal fusions that could be separated from VP6 following expression using different proteases. VP6 fusion proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells, and the expression levels using the different vectors were subjected to a pilot expression test. Based on the optimization experiments (data not shown), we concluded that the best expression conditions for the fusion proteins involved incubation to an A 600 of 0.6, addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 0.25 mM, and then further incubation for 12 hours at 25Â°C. We used the optimized conditions for the expression of all three different VP6 fusion proteins. To evaluate the ability of different fusion tags to enhance VP6 expression and solubility in E. coli, soluble and insoluble fractions of induced and uninduced bacteria were assessed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Figure 2 , there was a clear difference among the fusion tags with respect to their ability to enhance expression and solubility. The His 6 -VP6 construct was observed to have a high yield of expression, even if the total amount of the protein produced was insoluble. The TRX fusion tag was observed to have a lower enhancement of total expression, but a moderate quantity of recombinant protein (20%) was present in the soluble fraction. The SUMO-VP6 fusion yielded the best levels of expression, being the only tag able to preserve protein solubility, with about 80% of viral fusion protein expressed in a soluble form. Such different impacts of gene fusions on the expression and solubility of VP6 protein led us to proceed with large-scale expression and purification of just the SUMO-VP6 protein.
