Table 3 also reveals that the PTEs of the two sectors of finance, insurance and real estate and transportation and storage are higher than the other two sectors. The financial service sector has been apparently continuous working on business process reengineering (BPR). The financial holding companies established since 2002 have also created capital efficiency in the financial service sector. The transportation and storage sector has the second highest efficiency score among these four service sectors over the period 2001-2008. The wholesale and retail trade sector obtains the lowest efficiency in the service sectors during 2001-2008. This result indicates that the financial service and transportation and storage sectors have a competitive capability for using less capital, labor, and energy to yield a certain GDP. From the statistics of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics of the Executive Yuan in Taiwan, total employment in the wholesale and retail trade sector is the highest among the service sectors, accounting for 1.77 million persons (17%), in contrast to 0.69 million persons (6.6%) in the lodging and catering sector, and 74,000 persons (0.7%) in the real estate sector. This finding shows that the wholesale and retail trade sector needs much improvement in the input of resources, especially on labor savings. The PTE of the lodging and catering sector obviously deceases after 2003. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 weakened Taiwan's economy as well as its tourism industry. This event also proved that the slowdown in the economy had a great impact on lodging and catering businesses.
