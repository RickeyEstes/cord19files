Aim of our work is the development of peptide microarrays for the specific and sensitive detection of antibodies from fluid samples, i.e. human serum. Our approach is based on synthetic peptide probes with biotin linkers for site-specific immobilization via biotin-avidin affinity on activated glass substrates. When full protein sequences are reduced to short peptides, e.g. an immunodominant linear epitope, a high percentage of the remaining functionalities can contribute to the peptide-protein interaction and, consequently, modification of these functions reduces the native affinity. Immobilization strategies are required which react orthogonal to multivalent amino acid residues. Site-specific coupling of peptides to solid supports was reported using covalent methods [8] [9] [10] [11] 21] and taking advantage of the biotin-avidin interaction [21] . To our experience, however, the biotin-avidin affinity binding, although well characterized and frequently used, is unexpectedly challenging on the chip surface with nanoliter volumes of peptide solutions. In particular, the spotting buffer has to be optimized for individual physicochemical properties of peptides and steric interference on the surface can drastically reduce the coupling efficiency. To address this problem, we established a novel strategy using solution phase pre-coupling of biotinylated peptides to NeutrAvidin and direct spotting of conjugates onto activated surfaces. This method is particularly advantageous, since the peptides contribute to less than 10% of the mass of conjugates and therefore, the physico-chemical properties of the PNACs are almost exclusively determined by the NeutrAvidin, uniforming the handling of entire peptide libraries. To optimize the peptide/protein ratio for the pre-coupling, we tested the NA saturation using different molar excesses of fluorescence labeled biotinylated peptide with constant protein concentration of 2 mg ml −1 and over night incubation. The results are presented in Fig. 3 . The diagram shows the inset molar peptide excess in relation to the resulting NA saturation. A five-fold molar peptide excess almost leads to saturation of the NA binding capacity of four biotin molecules. Higher excesses further drive the coupling to saturation, but reduce the efficiency of the reaction. The results underline the reliability of solution phase coupling of biotinylated molecules to avidin. Using the presented reaction conditions, a molar peptide/protein ratio of 5:1 is suggested for efficient pre-coupling of biotinylated peptides to NA. The small amount of free peptide in solution after coupling eliminates the need for separation of unbound molecules prior to spotting. In addition, higher proportions of peptide solvent can drastically reduce the binding of NA to the chip surface (data not shown). In principle, the immobilization of PNACs on glass surfaces can occur covalently or by simple adsorption. Various types of surface chemistries can be considered, with aldehyde and epoxy surfaces for covalent and amino surfaces for adsorptive coupling being the most popular, since prefabricated slides are readily available. We tested the specified chip substrates in terms of suitability for immobilization of PNACs. Simultaneously, the optimum protein concentration for the microdispensing and a suitable spotting buffer was to be determined. The results of these experiments are depicted in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4a shows images of the surfaces after printing of different PNAC concentrations and removal of unbound molecules, the diagram in Fig. 4b displays the relative fluorescence intensity of the spots. Fig. 4c shows the reaction course of adsorptive NA immobilization onto amino silane for a selection of different buffer compositions. Fluorescence intensities are related to the density of NA molecules per square millimeter. The physisorption of NA on amino silane surfaces leads to the highest density of the protein layer with simultaneously good spot morphology and low spot-to-spot and chip-to-chip deviations. The aldehyde and epoxy surfaces exhibit lower binding capacities and result in unfavorable spot morphology, however, surface tailored spotting buffers may improve this effect. Increasing the spotted protein concentration from 0.1 to 0.4 mg ml −1 results in a strong gain in surface density while this effect is significantly lower with further increase from 0.4 to 0.6 mg ml −1 . 0.8 and 1.0 mg ml −1 protein concentration lead to spotting artefacts, e.g. comets and smearings, and are not considered for data evaluation. For the adsorption of NA (0.4 mg ml −1 ) to amino silane, highest protein densities of approximately 10 10 molecules/mm 2 are achieved using pure 10 mM PBS buffer for spotting. The reaction reaches saturation state after 18-24 h. All buffer supplements lead to a slower reaction rate and 20-50% reduced protein binding. Our findings are consistent with previous reports that adsorptive binding of proteins leads to the potentially highest density of surface layers, but this reaction can be relatively slow due to the rate of protein arrangement and partial unfolding on the surface [22] . The current protein density using 0.4 mg ml −1 NA corresponds to approximately 30% of the theoretical monolayer, assuming an idealized globular NA molecule with a footprintsize of 20 nm 2 [23] . With an average of 1.5 solution exposed binding sites per NA molecule, the surface contains at least 30 fmol peptide probes per square millimeter readily available for antibody capture. Protein adsorbates, however, are less stable than covalently linked immobilizates. Continued desorption of PNACs in the course of microarray processing, e.g. incubation and washing, can cause significant decrease of the entire assay sensitivity as a result of reduced binding capacity in the spots and simultaneous competition of antibodies with free peptide ligands in solution. To address this issue, we determined the rate of desorption of NA immobilizates from amine coated glass slides during incubation in physiological medium and compared the results with the desorption from aldehyde coated slides. Fluorescently labeled NA was spotted in 0.4 mg ml −1 onto both amine and aldehyde coated glass slides and incubated in buffered solution at 37 • C for 0-144 h. At specified points of time, the remaining NA density in the spots as well as the activity of the adsorbates, i.e. the biotin binding capacity, was determined. Fig. 5 shows the outcome of the investigation. The diagram displays the percentage of surface detected NA amount and activity in relation to the period of incubation. On either surface, a considerable desorption of NA is observed during the first 24 h of incubation, associated with a comparable loss of biotin binding capacity. Further incubation leads to marginal desorption. The protein density adjusts at about 15-20% of the initial layer. Hence, protein adsorbates on amino silane are sufficiently stable for microarray applications which normally involve physiological conditions and short terms of incubation and washing. Interestingly, immobilizates on aldehyde surfaces that have the capacity for covalent binding desorb in a highly similar way to the adsorbates. Most likely, reversion of initially formed Schiff's base intermediates between primary amines of NA and aldehyde groups on the surface results in release of the protein. Mild reduction of the Schiff's Base, however, yields a stable covalent bond and may eliminate the observed effect. To prove the suitability of our peptide microarray concept for antibody detection, we spiked the six model monoclonal antibodies into PBS buffer and diluted human serum with 1 g ml −1 final concentration of each mAb. The solutions were analyzed on peptide microarrays using 3 h incubation at room temperature for the PBS sample and over night incubation at +4 • C for diluted serum. The results of these experiments are displayed in Fig. 6. Fig. 6a shows an exemplary fluorescence image of the peptide microarray after antibody incubation in grey scale, Fig. 6b the quantitative evaluation of signal/background ratios. All antibodies are successfully detected well above the detection limit. The peptide microarray exhibits clearly defined and very homogeneous spots. Signal-to-background ratios of the antibody detection range from 36 (T7-mAb) to 125 (Hel-mAb). Importantly, no unspecific signals are observed when the arrays are selectively incubated with only one type of mAb (data not shown). Our results confirm the benefits of utilizing conjugates of pep- tide probes and a carrier protein for the chip production. The peptide specific physico-chemical characteristics, e.g. pI and hydrophobicity, are leveled by those of NeutrAvidin, leading to unified properties of the spotted molecules and clearly improved spot morphology, thus paving the way for standardized protocols. The differences in quantitative detection are presumably the outcome of unequal antibody affinities to the cognate peptide antigens. In addition, the native mAb affinity can be considerably altered by the surface presentation of the peptide antigen, e.g. the accessibility of the binding site and the immobilization direction. This is an important issue of our current research and optimization efforts.
