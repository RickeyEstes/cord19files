In 2003, a questionnaire survey was conducted at five national hospitals in Kathmandu City [10] . These five hospitals were included in this study (2011) . The results of the 2003 questionnaire were compared with those of this study (2011), including manuals, ICCs, in-service training and preparedness of personal protective equipment (PPE). A comparative statistical analysis of the 2003 and 2011 results was carried out by the Fisher's exact method using SPSS Ver19 for Windows. Comparison of nosocomial infection control conditions between 2003 and 2011 at five national hospitals showed an improvement trend. Particularly, preparation of PPE and disinfectants remarkably improved as shown in Figure 4 (P = 0.0238 and P = 0.004, respectively), categories in which all five hospitals met the standard quantity. In 2011, four out of five hospitals (except for one specialized hospital) were conducting in-service training, while only one hospital was conducting such training in 2003 (P = 0.099). Among these four hospitals, manuals were on hand and an ICC was established (P = 0.4167).
