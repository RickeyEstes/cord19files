Proteomes of RNA viruses are more ancient than proteomes of DNA viruses A series of experiments determined the relative age of each viral subgroup. (i) Evidence from ToD. We zoomed into the most ancient core ABEV Venn group and separated FSFs belonging to each of the seven viral replicon types (Fig. 5C) . In all viruses, regardless of the replicon type, median nd values were very low (see white circles), indicating that they shared ancient FSFs with cells. Likewise, each viral subgroup had a longer tail toward the right, suggesting that HGT may have played evolutionary roles only very recently. The most ancient ABEV repertoires were derived from dsRNA, minus-ssRNA, and ssDNA viruses, suggesting that they predated dsDNA viruses in evolution. (ii) Ariadne's threads traced in evolutionary time. We traced FSF domain ages onto the threads of FSFs shared between viral subgroups (Fig. 6A) . The oldest domains were spread in a transect that unified minus-ssRNA, plus-ssRNA, and dsRNA proteomes. This pattern was clearly evident in violin plots that describe FSF age in the threads along the early timeline of domain evolution (nd < 0.3) (Fig. 6B ). Once again, the proteomes of minus-ssRNA viruses were particularly enriched in ancient domains, suggesting that perhaps ssRNA was involved in virocell origins (read below). (iii) Evidence from trees of proteomes (ToP). To describe the evolutionary relationships between the proteomes of cells and the proteomes of viruses (taxa), we reconstructed ToP from the abundance and occurrence of 442 ABEV FSFs (phylogenetic characters). The ABEV group was selected because it includes many FSFs of ancient origin (median nd~0.4; Fig. 5A ), the entire abe core (Fig. 3B and table S5 ), and ancient FSFs in Ariadne's threads (Figs. 4B and 6A). Because biases in taxon sampling could influence tree reconstruction, we randomly sampled a set of 368 proteomes (taxa) from cells and viruses, including up to 5 viral species from each viral order or family and 34 proteomes corresponding to only free-living organisms in Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. The rooted phylogeny dissected proteomes into four supergroups (Fig. 7A ). Viruses formed a distinct paraphyletic group at the base of ToP that was distinguishable from cells by 76% bootstrap (BS) support. In turn, archaeal organisms were clustered paraphyletically in the more basal branches (black circles), whereas Bacteria and Eukarya formed monophyletic groups (blue and green circles) supported by 66% and 100% BS, respectively (Fig. 7A) . This topology supported an ancient origin of both viruses and Archaea and a sister relationship between Bacteria and Eukarya, which goes against some gene sequence-based phylogenies (58-60) but is congruent with a number of structure-and functionbased studies [discussed elsewhere (18, (61) (62) (63) (64) (65) ]. The most basal taxa corresponded to RNA and retrotranscribing viruses. These included well-known dsRNA viral families that have segmented genomes such as Birnaviridae, Partitiviridae, and Picobirnaviridae (2 segments); Chrysoviridae and Quadriviridae (4 segments); and Reoviridae (10 to 12 segments). Nodaviridae that have bipartite genomes (that is, two segments) and "capsidless" Narnaviridae (both plus-ssRNA viruses) also occupied the most basal positions in ToP along with dsRNA and dsDNA-RT viruses. Other very ancient viral groups included retrotranscribing viruses (Caulimoviridae, Hepadnaviridae, and Retroviridae), ssDNA viruses (Anelloviridae and Inoviri-dae), dsDNA viruses (Plasmaviridae and Polydnaviridae), ambisense arenaviruses, and minus-sense influenza viruses (Fig. 7A ). It has been hypothesized that retrotranscribing viruses likely mediated the transition from an ancient RNA world to the modern DNA world (66) . Remarkably, in our tree, retrotranscribing viruses originated before bona fide DNA viruses, validating the hypothesis (Fig. 7A) . Another interesting position was that of polydnaviruses, which are "symbionts" of endoparasitic wasps (67) . These viruses also encode segmented dsDNA genomes. These observations suggest the presence of segmented viral genomes (mostly RNA) in ancient cells and the late appearance of "capsid-encoding" and DNA viruses. A tree of viruses (ToV) reconstructed from abe core FSFs ( fig. S4 ) further confirmed an early origin in RNA viruses. Although the distribution patterns of replicon types were not entirely clear-cut, there was clear enrichment of RNA viral proteomes at the base of ToP, specifically minus-ssRNA and dsRNA viruses. This tree was poorly resolved partly as a result of the limited number of phylogenetic characters that were used to distinguish proteomes and largely as a result of the patchy distribution of abe FSFs in viral proteomes (a consequence of reductive evolution in viruses). Finally, grouping viruses by host type (that is, archaeoviruses, bacterioviruses, and eukaryoviruses) did not yield three independent groups, suggesting that viruses, regardless of host type, could be structurally (and evolutionarily) more related to each other ( fig. S5 ). It also suggests that viruses can jump hosts [for example, severe acute res-piratory syndrome (SARS) and Ebola viruses, loss of RNA viruses in prokaryotes (44) ], and thus, evolutionary relationships based on virus-host preferences should be considered with caution [sensu (43) ]. All characters were parsimony informative. Differently colored branches represent BS support values. Major groups are identified. Viral genera names are given inside parentheses. The viral order "Megavirales" is awaiting approval by the ICTV and hence written inside quotes. Viral families that form largely unified or monophyletic groups are labeled with an asterisk. Virion morphotypes were mapped to ToP and illustrated with images from the ViralZone Web resource (131) . No picture was available for Turriviridae. a Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Fibrobacter, Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, and Thermotogae. (B) A distancebased phylogenomic network reconstructed from the occurrence of 442 ABEV FSFs in randomly sampled 368 proteomes (uncorrected P distance; equal angle; least-squares fit = 99.46). Numbers on branches indicate BS support values. Taxa were colored for easy visualization. Important groups are labeled. b Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, Fibrobacter, Firmicutes, and Planctomycetes. c Amoebozoa Chromalveolata. We evaluated ToP phylogeny by comparing it against ICTV and structure-based classifications. ToP recovered some well-known relationships. For example, the genera Flavivirus (Flaviviridae) and Alphavirus (Togaviridae) were grouped together, suggesting their close evolutionary association (66% BS). In fact, alphaviruses were initially classified by the ICTV under Flaviviridae but were later assigned their own genera in Togaviridae. Both viral families show striking similarities in virion architecture (enveloped and spherical) and genome replication strategies (monopartite linear plus-ssRNA). Similarly, Polyomaviridae, Closteroviridae, Coronaviridae, and many others also formed individual monophyletic groups (indicated by asterisk in Fig. 7A ). Another largely unified group was that of filamentous dsDNA archaeoviruses (Rudiviridae and Lipothrixiviridae) that have been classified under the order "Ligamenvirales" (68) . Similarly, viral families in the "nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses" group (Poxviridae, Phycodnaviridae, Ascoviridae, Asfarviridae, Iridoviridae, and Mimiviridae) formed a paraphyletic group at the very derived positions. This group also included the recently discovered pandoraviruses (69) and pithoviruses (70) and the oddly placed bacteriophage (Myoviridae). The close grouping of all giant viruses supports the proposal of the viral order "Megavirales" (71) and a previous reconstruction (19) . However, herpesviruses and Caudovirales that share the common HK97 capsid protein fold did not form a single group (47) , but they were in close proximity (Fig. 7A ). In turn, Adenoviridae and Tectiviridae that belong to the PRD1/adenovirus-like lineage were closely clustered. Similarly, Totiviridae and some Reoviridae of the BTV-like lineage occupied basal positions. Some members of the picornavirus-like lineage (for example, Luteoviridae, Caliciviridae, and Picornaviridae) and retrotranscribing viruses also clustered together, but clear-cut structure-based viral lineages did not materialize in ToP. Other discrepancies also existed with regard to viral families defined by the ICTV that did not form unified groups. However, ICTV classifications are subject to revisions and do not always yield evolutionarily informative classifications. In light of these, ToP reconstructed from the abundance of conserved FSF domains present a "third" and global view of the evolutionary relationships of viruses, which adds deep lineage relationships to ICTV and structure-based classifications. ToP also provide interesting information regarding the evolution of virion morphotypes. Most basal branches were populated by spherical or filamentous virions (two of the simplest designs from the point of view of tensegrity). They gradually become more decorated, with additional features such as spikes and glycoproteins (retroviruses) in spherical virions, and rod-like designs (inoviruses) likely evolving from filamentous versions. Perhaps the rods and spheres combine to form the head-tail morphotype so abundant in prokaryotic viruses. Thus, mapping of virion morphotypes onto ToP likely hints toward the origin of viruses from a limited number of structural designs (43) . However, we caution that morphological similarities may also stem from convergent evolution. At this point, we lack evidence to confirm homologies between different virion morphotypes. Nevertheless, the early appearance of spherical and filamentous virions harboring segmented RNA genomes is remarkable and worthy of further attention. (iv) Evidence from distance-based networks. Typically, viral proteomes encode far less proteins and in lower abundance relative to the proteomes of cellular organisms (except for some giant viruses). To account for such differences and to test whether the phylogeny in Fig. 7A was not influenced either by HGT or by technical artifacts associated with our choice of phylogenetic model, we used FSF occurrence in distance-based networks reconstruction (Fig. 7B) . The resulting topology still favored a "tree-like" structure ( Fig. 7B) , suggesting that the phylogeny of Fig. 7A was not influenced by processes that could artificially increase genomic abundance. Moreover, none of the viral proteomes clustered with their hosts (for example, plant RNA viruses did not group with plants), indicating that the predicted cellular nature of viruses was not attributable to HGT from their hosts but was likely a result of ancient coexistence. The phylogenomic network retained most evolutionary relationships defined earlier by ToP but also recovered a closer grouping of herpesviruses with Podoviridae (Caudovirales) that was not so clear in ToP derived from genomic abundance, supporting the proposal that the two viral groups are closely related (47, 72) . (v) ToP derived directly from the age of protein domains. We also developed a multidimensional scaling approach to study the evolution of cells and viruses: the evolutionary principal coordinate (evoPCO) analysis (Fig. 8A) . The evoPCO method combines the power of cladistic and phenetic approaches by calculating principal coordinates directly from temporal evolutionary distances between the proteomes of species (see Materials and Methods). The distance between proteomes reflects phylogenetic dissimilarity in the age of FSF domain repertoires (that is, nd values) and can be displayed in 3D temporal space, assuming that the age of an FSF is the age of the first instance of that FSF appearing in evolution. Because proteomes are biological systems that are made up of component parts (that is, FSFs in this case) but describe cellular organisms and viruses, each component (regardless of its abundance) contributes an age to the overall age of the cellular or viral system. This factor, when taken into account, results in a powerful projection of a multidimensional space of proteomes onto a 3D temporal space that allows visualization of evolutionary relationships. (57) was added as an additional sample to infer the direction of evolutionary splits. a Ignicoccus hospitalis, b Lactobacillus delbrueckii, c Caenorhabditis elegans. (B) A distancebased NJ tree reconstructed from the occurrence of 442 ABEV FSFs in randomly sampled 368 proteomes. Each taxon was given a unique tree ID (tables S1 and S2). Taxa were colored for quick visualization. The evoPCO method revealed four clouds of proteomes in temporal space that correspond to viruses and to the three cellular superkingdoms (Fig. 8A ). The first three coordinates explained~85% of the total variability. Using the previously reconstructed proteome of the last common ancestor of modern cells as reference point (57), we inferred viruses as the most ancient supergroup, followed by Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya, in that order (Fig. 8A) . This topology supports earlier results from comparative genomic and phylogenomic analyses, adding a fifth line of evidence in support of the early origin of viruses. Remarkably, Lassa virus, which belongs to Arenaviridae and harbors segmented RNA genomes, appeared at the most basal position of the evoPCO plot, supporting the early origin of segmented RNA viruses in ToP (Fig. 7A) . Some giant viruses appeared more derived, supporting their ancient coexistence with cells (19, 73) . The topology and ordering of proteomes in evoPCO analysis were further supported by a distancebased neighbor-joining (NJ) tree (Fig. 8B) reconstructed directly from the temporal distance matrix, which retained the cohesive and ancient nature of the viral supergroup. The NJ tree made explicit the early origins of RNA viral families and was largely congruent with ToP recovered earlier (Fig. 7A) , validating the power of the evoPCO strategy. 


Section:results therefore highlight two important phases in viral evolution: (i) an early cell-like existence of viruses (the precursors of modern virocells) and (ii) a late transition to the viral mode, as we know it today.
