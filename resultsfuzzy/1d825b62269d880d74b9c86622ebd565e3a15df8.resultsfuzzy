Photosensitization resulting from endogenous pigment accumulation occurs because of a congenital enzyme deficiency causing abnormal heme synthesis, with the resultant blood and tissue accumulation of photodynamic agents, such as uroporphyrin I, coproporphyrin I, and protoporphyrin III. Bovine congenital hematopoietic porphyria is the result of a deficiency in uroporphyrinogen III cosynthetase, a key enzyme in heme biosynthesis. The condition is inherited as a simple recessive trait affecting many breeds, including Shorthorn, Ayrshire, Holstein, and Jamaican cattle. It has also been Sargison ND, et al
