With the exception of the adenoviruses, the majority of the known viruses causing respiratory tract disease are RNA viruses, a group of viruses whose genomes are generally considered to exhibit higher rates of mutations. Mutation rates for some RNA viruses such as HIV1 and influenza A have been extensively studied, and there exist large sequence databases for these viruses. However, for some important respiratory viruses such as RSV and parainfluenza 1 the number of available sequences, and hence knowledge of sequence variation, is very limited, with some groups now undertaking projects sequencing more genomes of these important agents. 46, 47 Because most molecular assays rely on hybridization between a primer and target sequence to detect the virus, lack of knowledge of the full extent of sequence variation could result in the inability to detect a particular viral strain or newly arising mutant. Such an event has already occurred in Sweden, where a strain of Chlamydia trachomatis with a deletion mutation rendering it nondetectable by 2 widely used commercial molecular assays spread around the country, likely aided by the production of falsenegative results by what were presumed to be gold-standard diagnostic tests. 48 With more laboratories switching to molecular assays for the detection of respiratory agents, it will be necessary for both laboratorians and clinicians to remain vigilant for cases of what appear to be viral respiratory tract infections with negative molecular results. With no formal surveillance system currently in place, sentinel laboratories with culture and high-throughput sequencing capabilities would be one solution for monitoring the emergence of sequence variants not detectable by standard molecular assays. Before the availability of sequence data, rhinoviruses and enteroviruses were classified in separate genera of the family Picornaviridae. Sequencing of the majority of the genomes in both groups revealed that they were so closely related that both genera have now been combined into the single genus Enterovirus. 49 The close genomic similarity between the enteroviruses and rhinoviruses has made it difficult to design PCR assays that can reliably discriminate between the 2 groups, with most multiplex assays reporting specimens positive for "rhinovirus/enterovirus," a situation that can cause confusion for people receiving the results who may be thinking in terms of rhinoviruses classically causing common-cold-like infections and enteroviruses causing aseptic meningitis and other systemic illnesses. Unpublished data from the authors' own laboratory, where more than 100 positive "rhinovirus/enterovirus" from multiplex PCR testing of upper and lower respiratory tract specimens were subjected to sequencing, revealed all the positives to be rhinovirus types, with one exception. This exception was an isolate of enterovirus 68, an enterovirus type known to be a cause of respiratory tract infections. [50] [51] [52] Furthermore, other enterovirus types have also been implicated as causes of respiratory tract illness. 49 Therefore, in most cases where a "rhinovirus/ enterovirus" result is reported from a patient suffering from a viral respiratory-like illness, it is likely to be due to a rhinovirus or an enterovirus capable of causing a respiratory tract infection, although the presence of an asymptomatically shed enterovirus cannot be ruled out. Virus-testing laboratories will play an important role in educating other health care workers about the changes in picornavirus taxonomy and the interpretation of results reported as positive for "rhinovirus/enterovirus."
