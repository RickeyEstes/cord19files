In 22 out of the 57 (38.6%) NPAs taken from the cases of respiratory infection the target-agnostic HTS analysis did not identify any known respiratory viral pathogen (Table 5 ). In these samples, only bacteriophages, Torque teno virus, HPV, Human PoSCV5-like circular virus, and Human polyomavirus 4 (WU polyomavirus) were identified (Table 5 ). Further analysis of the unidentified contigs assembled from these samples by looking for sequence homologies to known viral proteins (BLASTx) returned no significative results. Although some hits to viral proteins were identified, all of these contigs mapped also to other protein sequences in the Gen-Bank database with the same e-values, and with comparable ranges of coverage and identity percentage values, and thus could not be considered viral-specific hits. Representative examples of such kind of identifications are shown in Table 6 . Reads that did not form contigs were mapped against the nr Genbank database with DIAMOND [30] . The analysis showed that those reads matched to proteins of bacterial or human origin or belonging to bacteriophages, and no putative novel virus was identified (results not shown). We compared the bacterial hits identified by targetagnostic HTS analysis in these samples with those identified in the specimens taken from the control group. Several contigs were identified by BLASTn analysis as wellrecognized bacterial respiratory pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, all these hits to bacterial respiratory pathogens were not exclusive of the specimens taken from the cases of respiratory infection and could be identified also in the specimens taken from the control group (results not shown). Since our analysis is not designed to be quantitative, no conclusions regarding frequency could be made.
