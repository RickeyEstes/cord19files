3.1. Radical scavenging capacity EGCG derivatives (compounds 1-3) were effective in scavenging DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radicals (Zhong & Shahidi, 2011) . The radical scavenging capacity of EGCG was significantly enhanced by the esterification process and incorporation of the fatty acids, which was attributed to the increased lipophilicity and hence greater accessibility/affinity of the derivatives to the lipophilic DPPH radical than the parent EGCG molecule. In this work, the EGCG derivatives were evaluated for their ability to scavenge the more biologically relevant peroxyl radical, which was measured as oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). The ORAC assay utilises a biologically relevant radical source and has been established as a standard method for assessing the activity of hydrophilic antioxidants. In this study, a modified ORAC assay procedure for lipophilic antioxidants, proposed by Huang et al. (2002) , was employed; this procedure uses acetone/water as the solvent and RMCD as a solubility enhancer. The results showed that peroxyl radicals generated by AAPH were scavenged by EGCG and its derivatives (compounds 1, 2 and 3) to a greater extent (15-85 folds) than by the reference antioxidant trolox (Fig. 2) . Compound 4 was not examined for its antioxidant activity as all hydroxyl groups in EGCG were esterified with butyric acid leaving no hydrogen donors available. The ORAC values of the derivatives were higher than that of the parent EGCG molecule, indicating their greater hydrogen atom donating ability under the test conditions. The decreased number of hydroxyl groups in EGCG derivatives did not appear to negatively affect the antioxidant activity of the test compounds. Wright, Johnson, and Dilabio (2001) stated that the number of hydroxyl groups in EGCG is largely irrelevant to its antioxidant activity, and it is the strategic placing of such groups that does matter. The substituents on the phenyl ring play an essential role in the efficacy of phenolic antioxidant via both electronic and steric effects. Electron donating groups at the ortho and para positions are able to lower the activation energy for hydrogen abstraction and thus enhancing the hydrogen donating ability of the antioxidant (Singh, O'Malley, & Popelier, 2005) . In the EGCG derivatives, the O-acylation replaced the strong electron donating hydroxyl group (a combination of inductive and resonance effects) with a weaker electron donating ester group, which would presumably lead to compromised hydrogen donating ability of the molecule. However, the substitution also hinders the formation of the moderately strong hydrogen bonding of the adjacent hydroxyl groups in the EGCG molecule. These intramolecular hydrogen bonds contribute to the stabilisation of the molecule and increased bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) of the O-H bond, i.e. resistance of the hydrogen atom to dissociation (Wright et al., 2001) . Ortho-substitution of EGCG might result in enhanced hydrogen atom donating capacity by reducing intramolecular hydrogen bonds and BDE. Sterically, the acylation might have altered the threedimensional conformation of EGCG, which might facilitate hydrogen atom donation, hence increasing its radical scavenging capacity. Conformational characteristics are also important factors that affect the activity of antioxidants. Hakamata et al. (2006) reported that planar catechin (the catechol and chroman structure are constrained to be planar) showed a hydrogen transfer rate that was 5-fold faster than that of the native (+)-catechin. The scavenging activities of catechin against DPPH and AAPH radicals were increased by switching to the planar conformation. In this study, the acylation of hydroxyl groups on the phenyl ring might have led to planar conformation formation or other steric changes that enhance the p-conjugation of the substituents with the phenyl ring and hence the hydrogen donating ability of the molecule. In addition to the conformational attribute, the steric crowding caused by incorporation of high-molecular-weight bulky moieties might contribute to the greater hydrogen donating ability of the EGCG derivatives. Lucarini, Pedrielli, and Pedulli (1996) demonstrated that ortho-substituted phenols had lowered BDE due to the steric repulsion between the substituents and the hydroxyl group, especially when the substituents are bulky. In summary, the combined electronic and steric factors discussed above might explain the overall improved radical scavenging activity of the EGCG derivatives. Among the derivatives, compounds 2 and 3 containing PUFA showed higher ORAC values than compound 1 which had a saturated alkyl chain. The superior hydrogen atom donating capacity of compounds 2 and 3 may be due to the presence of electron-rich double bonds in the PUFA that may alter the electron distribution on the phenyl rings as well as the bent structures of PUFA chains that may help form more sterically-favoured conformations for facilitating hydrogen atom donation.
