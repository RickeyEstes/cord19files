The acute phase response of the two most prominent Eckersall et al., 1999) bovine acute phase proteins, SAA and haptoglobin, was studied in young calves after experimental infection with BRSV. Although most animals including controls had Mycoplasma spp. at necropsy, the infection method (Tjùrnehùj, 2000) reproduced disease through monoinfection with BRSV as indicated by the lack of pathological lesions and clinical signs in the control animals (see Table 1 ). In three calves out of 16 included in this study, either P. multocida or P. avium (both common respiratory (co-)pathogens in cattle (Bisgaard et al., 1991) ) were found upon necroscopy. The serum concentration of both SAA and haptoglobin remained low in all mockinfected control animals at all times with SAA concentrations below 17 mg/ml and haptoglobin concentrations below the detection limit of the ELISA (18 mg/ml, Fig. 1A ). The SAA concentration became elevated in 11 out of 12 experimentally infected animals within 6 days post infection (p.i.) (Fig. 1A±C) . In most cases this elevation was detectable at day 5 p.i, and peaked around day 5±8 p.i. Peak concentrations were in the 60±80 mg/ml range which is 5±7 times the normal SAA concentration as de®ned by the four control animals. In one of the two animals followed for 15 days p.i., a secondary response was noted on day 15 p.i. (animal No. 15, Fig. 1C ). Generally, changes in haptoglobin concentrations followed the changes in the SAA concentrations seen in individual animals, although low SAA responders did not show any haptoglobin response at all (Fig. 1A: animal No. 5, Fig. 1B : animal Nos. 12±14). The maximum response of haptoglobin was seen on day 6±7 p.i. and reached 8±10 mg/ml, which is approximately 500 times the detection limit of the assay (18 mg/ml). The secondary response of animal No. 15 was also seen with haptoglobin, although the second peak was at day 12 p.i. The two fastest SAA responders (animals Nos. 2 and 3) in Fig. 1A also belonged to the group of the three fastest haptoglobin responders; these animals were found to be infected with P. multocida at necropsy. Bacterial infection (with P. avium) was also found in animal No. 15, probably being the cause of the secondary responses of haptoglobin and SAA in this animal (Fig. 1C) . The other two animals from which bacteria (P. multocida) were isolated were followed for 8 days only and thus a putative secondary acute phase response was not detected. The response to BRSV-infection of both SAA and haptoglobin, developing during days 4±8 p.i. coincided with development of fever in most animals (Table 1 ). One exception was animal No. 5 (Fig. 1A) which was the lowest acute phase responder with both SAA and haptoglobin but did show a signi®cant pathology score of three and had 1 fever day in contrast to animal No. 6 which had no fever days (but a pathology score of three) and which had a higher acute phase response with both proteins. Generally, the acute phase responses could be ranked after the area under the response curve and correlated with the number of days with fever (see Table 1 ). Although in some cases with mild clinical signs (animals 12±14, Fig. 1B ) haptoglobin did not react while a Animals are listed according to number of fever days. If number of fever days are identical, the animal with highest lesion score is listed ®rst. The acute phase rank is derived from the area under the acute phase response curve of the protein in question until the day of sacri®ce, with 1 being the biggest area. b Mycoplasma dispar, Mycoplasma bovirhinis or Ureaplasma diversum. c P. multocida. d No response could be detected. e P. avium. SAA showed a low response, the magnitudes of the SAA responses of these animals were not correlated to either fever or pathology score (Table 1) , and generally the haptoglobin concentrations correlated better with disease severity. As a rough guideline, severe BRSV infection correlated with haptoglobin concentrations above 1 mg/ml at day 7 p.i. while less severe infection correlated with concentrations above the detection limit but below 1 mg/ml at day 7 p.i. (compare Table 1 and Fig. 1A±C ). For SAA, concentrations around 30±40 mg/ml were associated with mild disease and severe disease resulted in concentrations at or above 60 mg/ml. Although no reports have been published previously on the induction of SAA after viral infection in cattle, the SAA and haptoglobin concentrations reported here are within previously reported ranges for normal and acute phase concentrations in cattle after various experimental bacterial infections and aseptic in¯ammations (Werling et al., 1996; Boosman et al., 1989; Alsemgeest et al., 1994; Horadagoda et al., 1999; Conner et al., 1986; Eckersall and Conner, 1988; Skinner et al., 1991; Gruys et al., 1993; McNair et al., 1997; Nakagawa et al., 1997) . The haptoglobin concentration was demonstrated before to correlate with severity of clinical signs in mastitis cases (Makimura and Suzuki, 1982; Spooner and Miller, 1971; Conner et al., 1986) and in an experimental study of Haemophilus somnus infection (McNair et al., 1997) . Skinner et al. (1991) found that haptoglobin concentrations of more than 200 mg/ml indicated mild infection, values above 400 mg/ml diagnosed severe infection, while extended pathological conditions were typically associated with haptoglobin concentrations in the 1±2 mg/ml range (Skinner et al., 1991; Saini et al., 1998) . In Godson et al. (1996) , maximum haptoglobin concentrations correlated with maximum rectal temperature, sick score, weight change and decreased zinc concentration as well as with death after experimental herpesvirus type-1/P. haemolytica co-infection. Alsemgeest et al. (1994) found that bovine SAA was a more sensitive indicator of acute disease than haptoglobin. Also, while a bovine SAA response was found within 360 min after intravenous LPS, no increase in haptoglobin was found in the same time frame (Werling et al., 1996) . Similarly, Horadagoda et al. (1993 Horadagoda et al. ( , 1994 found SAA to react more rapidly than haptoglobin to experimental P. haemolytica infection. The difference in the inducibility of SAA and haptoglobin by acute and chronic disorders, respectively, was recently con®rmed in cattle with various acute or chronic diseases (Horadagoda et al., 1999) and SAA was also reacting more rapidly and sensitively than haptoglobin in the present study (see above). In man, SAA is the acute phase protein that is most sensitive to viral infections (see e.g. van Leeuwen and van Rijswijk, 1994) . In conclusion, this model of BRSV infection (Tjùrnehùj, 2000) leads to strong and reproducible SAA and haptoglobin acute phase responses, the magnitude of which correlated well with the severity of disease, even if infection with BRSV is not believed to have a viraemic phase and leads to pathological changes that do not involve actual tissue damage (Collins et al., 1996) . In other studies, viral infection, either experimental (bovine herpes virus followed for 4 days after infection (Godson et al., 1996) ) or natural (rinderpest virus (Spooner and Miller, 1971) ) did not give rise to elevated haptoglobin. However, an acute phase haptoglobin response was observed in foot-and-mouth disease virus infections (Ho Èfner et al., 1994) , simultaneously with or a couple of days later than viraemia and clinical disease. Also, bovine herpes virus infections did lead to a haptoglobin response when animals were followed for more than 4 days p.i. (Godson et al., unpublished results) . Haptoglobin reached maximum concentrations up to above 10 mg/ml while SAA increased up to around 80 mg/ml, both proteins peaking around day 8 p.i., and setting off at day 5 p.i. Haptoglobin reacted with the biggest relative increase but SAA was most sensitive to BRSV-infection. None of the control animals showed any sign at any time of haptoglobin above the detection limit of the assay or SAA above normal levels even if Mycoplasma spp. were isolated from all control animals. It must be concluded therefore that bovine haptoglobin and SAA can react to viral infection. Considering the timing of the response and the correlation between the magnitude of the response and the severity of the infection, it can be established that viruses causing only local pathology can indeed induce acute phase responses, most probably indirectly via virus-mediated tissue perturbations.
