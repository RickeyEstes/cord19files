The detailed investigations we performed and which we describe previously demonstrated: We have derived stable averaged results of the optimized NS5A diffusion constant on the ER surface for the NS5A/Alone and NS5A/OtherNSPs cell types based on 10 realistic reconstructed ER scenarios combined with 10 respective experimental FRAP time series. The final averaged results for both cell types are shown in Table 1 for the ER manifold surface and for the 2D planar case. The diffusion constant for the NS5A/Alone cells was approximately 4-fold larger than that of the NS5A/OtherNSPs cells (for both geometry types, i.e., ER surface and 2D planar geometry case). Hence, the estimated value for the NS5A/OtherNSPs is significantly smaller then that one of NS5A/Alone and indicates that in the presence of other NSPs, the NS5A mobility is substantially reduced, presumably due to a higher amount of NS5A clustered to DMVs or membranous web regions. The parameter estimations based on simplified 2D planar geometry, rather than the ER surface setup, caused a decrease of the diffusion constant values by a factor of approximately 2 (for both cell types). Thus, geometric simplifications as used often within simulations of biophysical processes change the results significantly. Table 1 . Averaged final NS5A diffusion constant D ns5a as described in Section 3.7. The final values are computed by means of the averaging process of the single results (as described in Section 2.7) which was shown graphically within Figure 7 . We give results for the case of the use of the ER geometry setups as described in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, but also for a simplified classical 2D planar consideration, cf. Section 3.6.
