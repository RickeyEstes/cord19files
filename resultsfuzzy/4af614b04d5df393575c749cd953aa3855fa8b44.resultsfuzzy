Data analysis has revealed five themes and fifteen sub-themes. These themes are 1) Stress of the outbreak, 2) Factors perceived to contribute to outbreak occurrence, 3) Factors perceived to contribute to success of outbreak control, 4) Factors inhibiting outbreak control, and 5) Longterm institutional gains in response to the outbreak management ( Table 2 ). In the results, themes are presented in bold and sub-themes (codes) are presented in italic bold typing. Data analysis identified five themes and fifteen sub-themes.

The high stress of the outbreak: All participants reported that the MERS-CoV outbreak was seen to constitute an episode of the most pressing and serious significance to the organization and country. Consistently across interviews, it was described in such terms as a "serious and straining situation" and a "situation that carries national and international significance". Frontline HCWs and senior decision-makers alike not only perceived this high gravity, but also the high and diverse demands the outbreak placed on them personally ("A very demanding situation"). Throughout the interviews, participants described the outbreak as being a period of severe and sustained "tension", "doubts", "challenges", "fear", and "anger". Frequent visits, communications and collaborations from external regulatory agencies (such as the Saudi Ministry of Health, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention "CDC" and the World Health Organization "WHO"), were perceived to be useful but also served to add stresses and responsibilities amidst the pressurized situation which led to near-closure of this large institution. The perceived seriousness of the crisis was reported to motivate staff to expend maximum effort to assist in its management. However, the high levels of stress were exacerbated by a pervading sense that controlling the outbreak involved "hard and uncertain progress" because whether and how the situation would improve was seen to be very unclear. Data analysis identified five major themes and fifteen sub-themes. The major themes were 1) the high stress of the outbreak, 2) factors perceived to contribute to outbreak occurrence, 3) factors perceived to contribute to success of outbreak control, 4) factors inhibiting outbreak control, and 5) long-term institutional gains in response to the outbreak management (Table 2 ). In the results, themes are presented in bold and sub-themes are presented in italic bold typing.
