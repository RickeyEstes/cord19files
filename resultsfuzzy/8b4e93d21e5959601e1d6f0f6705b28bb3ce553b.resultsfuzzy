Glial-committed progenitor cells were dissected from the striatal region of the brains of day 1 postnatal C57BL/6 mice and cultured for 6 days before use in transplant, resulting in the growth of numerous neurospheres containing progenitor cells (Figs. 1A, B) . These cells were characterized by immunostaining for NG2 (data not shown), confirming that the majority of cells are oligodendrocyte progenitor cells as previously reported (Totoiu et al., 2004) . Differentiation of these cells in vitro resulted in approximately 60-70% oligodendrocytes, 20-30% astrocytes, and 5% other cell types in agreement with previous studies (Totoiu et al., 2004) . Our results agree with previous findings that transplantation of glial-committed progenitor cells to mice chronically infected with MHV (day 12 p.i.) resulted in substantial remyelination 21 days post-transplant as evident by
