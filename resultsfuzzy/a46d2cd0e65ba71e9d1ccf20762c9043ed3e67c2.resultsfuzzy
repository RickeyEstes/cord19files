Clinical features and laboratory findings The clinical, radiological, and physiological measurements obtained at the time of the initial visit are shown in Table 1 . The mean age of 55 patients was 48.9 ± 10.5 years (range, 23-68 years), and 36 patients (65 %) were women. There were 47 nonsmokers, six former smokers, and two current smokers. The mean duration of respiratory symptoms from onset to lung biopsy was 6 months (20.2 ± 50.9 months; range, 0.8-360 months). All patients were followed for a mean duration of 64.3 ± 26.7 months (range, 14-120 months). The patients were diagnosed as follows: 21 with CTD-NSIP (including seven with polymyositis/dermatomyositis; seven with rheumatoid arthritis; four with of Sjögren syndrome; two with systemic sclerosis, and one with microscopic polyangiitis), 14 with NSIP-Ab (+), and 20 with NSIP-Ab (−). There were no differences among the three groups according to age, sex, cough, and dyspnea. Symptoms of arthralgia, Raynaud's phenomenon, skin rash, and dry eye or mouth were highly associated with the CTD-NSIP and NSIP-Ab + groups compared with the NSIP-Ab-group (Table 2) . No differences among the three groups were noted in arterial blood gas and HRCT findings. Abnormalities of pulmonary function were similar among the three groups and were characterized by restrictive defects with impairment of diffusion (Table 3) . During follow-up, three patients (15 %) with cellular NSIP died (two from lung infections, one from liver failure), and six (21 %) and four (80 %) patients with mixed or fibrotic NSIP, respectively, died from progression of lung disease.
