Although 57 hospitals stated that they have adopted EDI, the findings showed that 63.2% of the EDI are actually internal EDI, which cannot be called EDI if a stringent definition is applied. As far as EDI volume is concerned, the overall volume of 57.9% seems optimistic. However, purchasing and logistics, the two individual business functions involving the most interorganizational transactions, have volumes lower than 25%. Other business functions such as inventory, accounting, finance, IT, and hospitalization administration are more likely related to inter-departmental EDI usage within the boundaries of a hospital. From the aspect of document diversity, a hospital in China normally has hundreds of different document types. The results of this study show only 11.6 document types on average are handled through EDI connections. The majority of document types are still manually processed, implying a large space for improvement for EDI development in China's hospitals. Similarly, the low percentages (less than 25%) of EDI breadth denote that the hospitals have established EDI connections with only a very limited number of trading partners. This finding implies that the adoption of EDI is still in its early stage for both the hospitals and other firms. In addition, most hospitals only use EDI at the file-to-file level. At this level, 93.0% of the EDI documents do not contain image information, indicating that EDI is mostly used to support hospital administration and simple professional healthcare tasks. These findings suggested that EDI has been adopted by a number of hospitals in China, but its usage is at a relatively low level. Given that high-level hospitals have more resources, we anticipate that Level III hospitals should exceed Level I and Level II hospitals in all of the four dimensions of EDI usage. Surprisingly, few differences were identified among the three hospital levels. Other than the fact that Level III hospitals have significantly greater EDI volumes in purchasing and IT and a greater EDI depth, there are no other statistically significant differences among hospital levels. The results of differences among hospital levels are interpreted with great caution because a convenience sample was used which might not represent the general population of hospitals in Beijing. For example, seven Level I hospitals were selected from a total of 230; it is very likely that this sample was biased. A plausible explanation of the lack of EDI differences between Level III hospitals and lower-level hospitals is that those Level I and Level II (especially Level I) hospitals who sent their managers for continuous education in Beijing University are likely to be the ones who put more emphasis on technology and have more resources. These Level I and Level II hospitals may tend to be champions with respect to leveraging advanced information technologies; therefore, the level of their EDI usage is shown in this study to be close to that of the Level III hospitals. Nevertheless, the major objective of this paper is to depict the EDI usage status in China's hospitals. The selection of Beijing and the inclusion of more Level III hospitals enable us to study a sample where EDI usage would more likely be great. Based on a reasonable analysis of the sample, it can be inferred from the results that in general the various aspects of EDI usage in China's hospitals will be less than the extent of EDI usage in our sample.
