Using Table 2 . The newly determined sequences have been deposited in the NCBI nucleotide sequence database and assigned the following accession numbers: KC340952 (farm numbers 1 and 2); KC340953 (farm number 7); KC340954 (farm numbers 8 and 11); KC340955 (farm number 10); KC340956 (farm number 13); KC340957 (farm number 14); KC340958 (farm number 18). For 9 farms positive for PToV, the RT-PCR yielded a product of the anticipated size of 451 bp. Sequence analysis confirmed that the product was porcine torovirus specific. Those that shared the same sequence were neglected. Pairwise comparison of nucleotide sequences of the partial S gene confirmed that the strains are more closely related to the porcine torovirus. Comparison of the nucleotide (exclude the primer sequences) and deduced amino acid sequences of the fragment of the S gene of Chinese PToV strains showed that the Chinese PToV strains were highly conserved for the region, which had 90.2%-99.8% nucleotide and 93.7%-99.3 deduced amino acid identity with each other, and they formed a single lineage on the phylogenetic tree ( Figure 1 ). The Chinese PToV strains were 90.9%-95.1% and 89.4%-96.5% identical to those porcine torovirus (AJ575372.1; GU196786.1) while only 38.3%-40.7% and 8.7%-10.8% to those of bovine torovirus. While, among the Chinese PToV strains, 6 strains clustered most closely with the the PToV Markelo/Netherlands strain, KC340955 clustered with GU196786. These results indicated that different PToV strains were circulating in China. Previous researches suggested that more than two different PToV strains could circulate simultaneously in an area; moreover individual animals could be infected by two strains during their productive life [5, 17] . In China, PToV-associated diarrhea has not been reported; even there was little information about PToV epidemiology. However, longitudinal, serological, and virological studies on PToV in piglets were carried out in Spanish and Europe and also RT-PCR method and realtime PCR were developed to detect PToV qualitatively or quantitatively in Korea [5, 6, 8, [17] [18] [19] . PToV epidemiology in China should be paid attention to. Our study first reported Gene sequences were aligned using the ClustalW method and the phylogenetic tree was performed by the neighbour joining method using 1000 bootstrap. Sequences from this study were marked red. the existence of PToV in China, and PToV molecular epidemiology was also conducted in the study. PToV has been detected in swine diarrhea samples and also high incidence of PToV infection in diarrhea samples was observed in our study. It was worth noting that two diarrhea samples were tested positive for PToV alone, and a previous study has reported a diarrhea sample tested positive for PToV alone when a survey for enteric pathogens in diarrheic pigs was carried out [20] . However, the impossibility of growing the virus in culture cells has precluded the development of PToV. We could not make the conclusion if there was any necessary connection between the two, or a relationship exists between PoTV and the other enteric pathogens identified. We could not ignore the importance of PToV and diagnosis of porcine diarrhea should include PToV examination. Further studies to reveal the epidemiological status of PToV infection in China are needed to be developed. In addition to investigating the molecular epidemics using RT-PCR, further immunological method should be established to detect serological prevelence of porcine torovirus in Chinese swine herds. Future researches will focus on the epidemiology and pathogenic potential of PoTV.
