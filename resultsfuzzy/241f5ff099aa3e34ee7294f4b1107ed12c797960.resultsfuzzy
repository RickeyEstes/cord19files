A total of 37 selected studies were classified based on principal study type into drug screening, preclinical studies, or clinical studies. This resulted in 11 drug screening, 23-33 17 preclinical studies, 34-50 and 9 clinical studies. [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] Drug screening studies We summarized the main characteristics of selected drug screening studies and listed all positively testing drugs with confirmed regulatory approval (supplementary file 2). These studies were a heterogeneous group that included 8 highthroughput screens and 3 virtual drug screens. Six of these studies introduced new drug screening methodologies and carried out pilot screens. In addition, different studies used varying methods to detect positively testing drugs. The most commonly applied technique was the measurement of luciferase activity in infected cells, a technique used in 3 studies. 23, 28, 31 Other applied techniques included measurement of the inhibition of enhanced green fluorescent protein expression and inhibition of beta-lactamase activity. In addition to the conduction of drug library screens, 3 studies included additional preclinical trials (in vitro and in vivo) on selected drug candidates. 24, 25, 27 Relevant items from these trials were extracted and analyzed together with the results from other preclinical studies. Due to the significant variation of selected study types, designs, participants, and reported outcome measures, we chose to carry out a narrative synthesis of results rather than a meta-analysis. Based on our eligibility criteria, we selected a total of 11 potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of EVD for further analysis. We summarized the data extracted on each potential drug (Table III) .
