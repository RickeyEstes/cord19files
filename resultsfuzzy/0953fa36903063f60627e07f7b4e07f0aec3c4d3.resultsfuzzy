We started by comparing the whole-genome expression profiles in the brains of the BALB/c and the 129SvEv mice upon infection with MHV. To this end, mice were inoculated intranasally with 10 6 TCID 50 of MHV strain A59 or with PBS (control). Groups of mice (n = 4) were sacrificed at 2 and 5 days post inoculation after which the brains were harvested and total RNA was isolated. The extent of virus replication was determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR targeting MHV-specific RNA sequences as described earlier [21] . Previously, we demonstrated that the viral RNA load correlates well with viral infectivity in tissue homogenates [17] . While no viral RNA could be detected yet at 2 days post inoculation (data not shown), viral RNA was observed in the brain of both mouse strains at day 5 ( Figure 1A ). As expected, the BALB/ c mice displayed a much higher viral RNA load than the 129SvEv mice. Next, the RNA extracts were processed for microarray analysis using the PBS-inoculated groups as the reference. In total, 57 and 121 genes were significantly differentially expressed (≥ 1.5 fold change) in BALB/c mice at 2 and 5 days post infection, respectively. In contrast, in the 129SvEv mice, no significant induction of gene expression was observed. The results are depicted in Figure 1B as a gene tree that was built based on the genes with a significantly altered expression level in BALB/c mice at 5 days post infection (i.e. expression-based cluster analysis). From these data we were able to identify host genes, the increased expression (≥ 1.5 fold) of which could already be detected at day 2 (i.e. early genes; Figure 1C ) or only at day 5 (i.e. late genes; Figure 1D ). The group of earlyinduced transcripts contained many IFN-inducible genes, including the well-known interferon regulatory factor 7 (Irf7), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1), and 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (Oas) genes (Additional file 1A). Within the cluster of "late" genes (Additional file 1B) several chemokines (i.e. Ccl2, Ccl5, Ccl7, Cxcl9, and Cxcl10) could be identified. Next, in order to construct a functional association network, we applied the STRING 8.0 software [22] to the list of proteins encoded by the "early" and "late" genes. We also included known interactors of our hits in this analysis, while proteins that did not demonstrate any known interactions were excluded for clarity. The results are shown in Figure 2A and 2B. Functional association network analysis of the proteins encoded by the "early" genes revealed two main modules. One module contained several proteins involved in antigen presentation, while the other module contained numerous proteins involved in the type I IFN response. The key player in this latter module appeared to be Irf7, which is the master regulator of type I IFN-dependent responses [23] . Functional association network analysis of the proteins encoded by the "late" genes revealed a large network of proteins involved in host-pathogen interactions. Although the microarray analyses did not reveal the induction of IFN-γ gene expression itself, IFN-γ appeared at a central position in the network. In addition, the induction of a type I IFN response was also evident from this network as demonstrated by the presence of the transcription factors Irf1 and Irf8, both of which demonstrated elevated mRNA levels upon MHV infection. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that MHV infection induces a robust IFN response both at 2 and 5 days post infection, in which the transcription factors Irf7, Irf1, and Irf8 appear to be the key players. At 5 days post infection, a type II IFN response also becomes apparent. To confirm and extend these observations, we next analyzed the induction of type I and II IFN gene expression (i.e. IFN-α4 and IFN-β1, and IFN-γ, respectively) by using quantitative RT-PCR. In agreement with the microarray expression profiles, significant induction of these type I and II IFNs could only be detected in the MHV-infected BALB/c animals ( Figure 1E ). The observation that the BALB/c mice, unlike the 129SvEv mice, exhibited abundant expression of IFN-responsive genes upon MHV infection appears counter intuitive as the 129SvEv mice are much more resistant to the infection than the BALB/c mice. Apparently, the resistance of 129SvEv mice to MHV infection is not controlled by a more robust IFN response. The reason for the observed difference in susceptibility between the different mouse strains after intranasal inoculation is not known. MHV-A59 was recently shown to replicate efficiently in the liver of 129SvEv mice after intraperitoneal inoculation [11] . Interestingly, the resistance of 129SvEv mice after intranasal inoculation is not restricted to infection with MHV, as it was also observed for vesicular stomatitis virus [24] . The microarray expression profiles described above suggested that the induction of an IFN response correlates with the viral load within the brain. To confirm this, we examined the data of the individual BALB/c mice at 5 days post infection in more detail. Clearly, the animals with the highest viral loads (mouse 2 and 4; Figure 3A ), also dis-played significantly higher levels of induction of type I and II IFN expression ( Figure 3B ). Likewise, the amplitude of the gene expression profiles ( Figure 3C and Additional file 2) of the individual mice also correlated with the viral loads in the brain. These observations are in agreement with results obtained by the profiling of SARS-CoVinfected macaques [25] . Also in that study a positive correlation between virus load and the induction of gene expression was observed. A few genes (n = 6), including ISG20, showed an inverse correlation with the viral load. We currently have no explanation for this observation as expression of ISG20 is known to be induced by type I IFNs [26, 27] . Interestingly, ISG20 has been shown to exhibit antiviral activity against other viruses [28, 29] . To study the role of type I IFN-independent and -dependent gene expression in the control of MHV infection in vivo in more detail, we next made use of the IFNAR-/-mice [30] . These mice are highly susceptible to MHV infection as compared to the parental 129SvEv mice [11, 17] . Indeed, when these mice were inoculated intranasally with 10 6 TCID 50 of MHV-A59, viral RNA levels in their brains became much higher than in animals from the parental strain at 5 days post infection ( Figure 4A ). Interestingly, at this time point the viral RNA levels in the IFNAR-/-mice were comparable to those in the brains of the BALB/c mice. However, efficient dissemination of the infection, resulting in high viral loads in the liver as determined by quantitative RT-PCR, was only observed in the IFNAR-/-mice and not in the wild-type mice, which displayed viral RNA levels just above background ( Figure  4B ). Thus, in agreement with previous studies, a type I IFN-dependent response is required to inhibit virus dissemination [11, 15] . Whole-genome expression profiling of brains of the IFNAR-/-mice revealed the significantly induced expression of 73 genes (≥ 1.5 fold) at 5 days post infection. In contrast, at day 2, hardly any alterations in gene expression could be detected in these knock-out mice (Additional file 3). Figure 4C shows an expression-based cluster analysis of these 73 genes for the wild-type and IFNAR-/mice. Comparison of the complete expression profiles of these mice revealed that the transcriptional profile at day 5 in the IFNAR-/-mice has a larger similarity with the profile at day 2 of the parental 129SvEv mice than with that of the knock-out mice at day 2 post infection ( Figure 4C ). This observation may suggest the presence of an early host response to infection with MHV in the parental mice, even though no significant induction (≥ 1.5 fold) of gene expression could be detected ( Figure 1B) . Such a response, may not be evident in transcriptional profiles of whole organs, but might only be apparent at the cellular level. We speculate that early decisive events are happening in initial target cell populations such as DCs and macro-Early and late transcriptional responses to infection with MHV As the knock-out mice lack a functional type I IFN receptor, the upregulation of gene expression observed in these mice apparently occurs independently of type I IFN signalling. Not much is known yet about type I IFN-independent responses to infection. The observation that the transcriptional upregulation of Irf1 was independent of type I IFN signalling is consistent with the notion that IFN-γ can also induce expression of this gene [32,33]. The type I IFN receptor-independent expression profile within the brains of IFNAR-/-mice after MHV infection Likewise, we also observed increased transcription of Ifitm1 and Ifitm3 independent of type I IFN signalling, again corresponding with the literature [34, 35] . Interestingly, the expression of various genes encoding proteins involved in antigen presentation (i.e. H2, B2m, Psmb8, Psmb9, and Ctss) was also increased in the absence of type I IFN signalling. Psmb8 and Psmb9 encode immunoproteasome subunits which facilitate antigen presentation to CD8 + T cells after virus infection, a process that is primarily regulated by IFN-γ [36] . Furthermore, also the expression of the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) invariant chain, also called CD74 [37], was increased upon infection of the knock-out mice. These data are in agreement with the observation that the induction of genes involved in antigen processing is independent of STAT1 activation by . We also observed the transcriptional upregulation of the 3 isoforms of metallothionein (Mt1, Mt2, and Mt3), which encode proteins known to scavenge toxic metals [39] . The induction of these genes, which was not apparent in either wild-type mice, could reflect an acute-phase reaction in the brain of MHV-infected IFNAR-/-mice, which likely contributes to pathogenesis as has been shown for other viruses [40-42].
