Considering the total resolution of the CE separation and the running time, the optimal buffer system containing 15 mM borate, 40 mM phosphate, 15 mM SDS, 15% acetonitrile and 7.5% 2-propanol was employed for the analysis. The typical MEKC chromatograms of the standard and sample solutions using the optimized buffer condition were shown in Fig. 4 . The peaks of Baicalin, Baicalein and Wogonin presented in the chromatogram of the sample solutions were identified by comparing the mobility times and the characteristic of the UV spectra of the peaks with those presented in the standard solution.
