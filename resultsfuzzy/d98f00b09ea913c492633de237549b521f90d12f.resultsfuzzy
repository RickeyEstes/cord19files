University General Hospital ATTIKON¨, 4th Department of Internal Medicine, University of Athens, Athens, Greece Objectives: To evaluate the sensitivity of disk diffusion test with cefoxitin (30 mcg) in the detection of methicillin resistant CNS compared with minimal inhibitory concentration test (MIC) since during the last decade CNS emerged as significant clinical pathogens in serious infections. Methods: Susceptibility tests were performed after determining MIC test according to NCCLS guidelines and cefoxitin disc of 30 gr (Kirby Bauer, BD sensi-disc; Becton Dickinson) in 35 • C. An inhibition zone diameter ≤24 mm indicated methicillin resistance whereas>24 mm indicated methicillin sensitivity according to NCCLS guidelines. All strains with MIC 0.5-1 g/ml were investigated for the presence of mecA gene with PCR using mec A1(5 -AAATCGATGGTAAAGGTTGGC-3 ) and mec A2 (5 -AGTTCTGCAGTACCGGATTTGC-3 ) primers. Results: From a total of 380 CNS isolates, 128 (33%) were methicillin sensitive (MIC ≤ 0.25 g/ml) and 205 (53%) methicillin resistant (MIC ≥ 2 g/ml) while 47 (14%) presented with a range of 0.25 g/ml < MIC <2 g/ml. In 137 isolates with MIC ≥ 2 or MIC ≤ 0.25, cefoxitin disc (30 g) inhibition zone diameter and MIC were correlated as follows: Nocardiosis is an infection associated with severe morbid conditions especially in immunocompromised patients. The diagnosis, presently based on direct examination and conventional cultures, is difficult, time consuming and often delayed or prevented due to the relatively slow growth of these bacteria, and the empiric therapeutic decision before sampling. The objective of this study was to develop a PCR-based assay for the rapid detection of Nocardia directly from human clinical samples. The technique consisted in a 16S-specific amplification combined with a chemiluminescent hybridization. The probe was obtained by PCR from DNA of the type strain Nocardia asteroidesATCC 19247 T . DNA extraction and amplification from specimens (bronchoalveolar liquid, skin biopsy and cerebral abscess) seeded with serial dilutions of Nocardia asteroides ATCC 19247 T allowed the evaluation of the analytical sensitivity of the assay which reached 10 3 CFU/reaction after agarose gel electrophoresis and 1 CFU/reaction after transfer and hybridization. The applicability of the PCR assay to diagnose human nocardiosis was evaluated by investigating eighteen clinical human samples. For patients with nocardiosis confirmed by conventional cultures, clinical specimens were positive with a sharp chemiluminescent signal after hybridization. No amplification was observed for 20 clinical samples from patients with confirmed tuberculosis used as a negative control. These results highlighted the high specificity and sensibility of the PCR protocol presented in this study. It appeared useful in the rapid diagnosis of nocardiosis directly from clinical samples without culture, resulting in timely and appropriate clinical management that can amount to significant savings for patients. and this technique became current in routine. We tested hybridization protected ARNr or HPA (Gen-Probe) compared to standards techniques (direct immunofluorescence) (Direct IFD) for C. trachomatis, examination and culture for N. gonorrhoae). The doubtful or conflicting tests were confirmed by a technique of competition (PCA). We studied 208 patients (144 endo-cervical samples and 64 urethral samples). Our results were analysed statistically. In woman, 21 cases of C. trachomatis were diagnosed (14.58%) and two cases of N. gonorrhoae (1.38%). In man, 10 cases of C. trachomatis were diagnosed (15.62%) and five cases of N. gonorrhoae (7.81%). In conclusion, the technique of HPA enabled us to improve the diagnosis of these two types of bacteria, which could be underestimated by the standards methods. Objective: Rapid appropriate antibacterial treatment is important to improve the prognosis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococccus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. RT-PCR can identify S. aureus (Sa) and detect methicillin resistance. We used it directly in positive blood culture (BC) bottles with Gram positive cocci (GPC) upon direct smear examination (DSE) to provide clinicians with fast and accurate results and evaluate the impact of these results on treatment changes and appropriateness.

The long-term evolution of these patients and benefit of these regimens are best described in large prospective cohorts. Methods: All consecutive PI-naive patients presenting at 47 French HIV clinical centers in 1997-1999 for whom a PI-containing regimen was initiated (except for primary infection) were prospectively included in the APROCO-ANRS EP11 study. Data were recorded at the initiation of PI therapy (baseline), at months 1, 4, and every 4 months thereafter: sociodemographic and clinical data, CD4+ and CD8+ cells counts, and plasma HIV-1 RNA level. All clinical and laboratory adverse events were prospectively recorded. Results: 1281 patients were included, 45% antiretroviral-naïve, 77% males, mean age 38 years, 39% homosexuals, 16% injecting drug users, 33% heterosexuals. At baseline, mean HIV-1 RNA was 4.4 log 10 copies/ml, mean CD4+ cell count 294/mm 3 , 21% had AIDS. At 5 years, 648 patients were still followed-up and 84% still on HAART (40% without a PI), 4% on a dual antiretroviral combination and 7% had stopped antiretrovirals. Estimated survival was 90% (92% in patients without prior AIDS, 84% in those with prior AIDS), progression to a new AIDS-defining event 16% (6% in patients without prior AIDS, 28% in those with prior AIDS), the cumulative probability of any serious adverse effect (SAE) was 30%. At 5 years, 76% had HIV-1 RNA < 2.7 log 10 copies/ml. Mean CD4 + cell count was 573/mm 3 , 74% had gained more than 100 cells/mm 3 since baseline and 93% had CD4 + above 200/mm 3 .
