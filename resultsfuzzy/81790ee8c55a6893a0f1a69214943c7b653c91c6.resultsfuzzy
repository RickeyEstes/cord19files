To investigate the effect of infection with NDV on cell cycle profiles and to determine whether the replication of NDV is necessary for specific cell cycle anomalies, asynchronously growing cells were mockinfected or infected with intact virus or UV-inactivated NDV for 24 h and then analyzed by flow-cytometry. HeLa cells were used in these experiments, as they are permissive for NDV infection and have been used as a model cell type to study virus-cell interactions. Representative cell cycle profiles and histograms are shown in Fig. 1 . An obvious accumulation of cells in the G 0 /G 1 phase was evident in NDV-infected cells when compared with mock-infected cells (Fig. 1A) . Further analysis of the plots using Prizm (Fig. 1B) revealed that the proportion of cells in each of the G 0 /G 1 , S, and G 2 /M phases were similar in the mockinfected cells and cells infected with UV-inactivated virus (Fig. 1) . UV inactivation of NDV was confirmed by the absence of the N protein in the cells treated with the UV-inactivated NDV at 24 h post infection (Fig. 1C) . Thus, we concluded that NDV infection resulted in G 0 /G 1 cell cycle arrest, but the arrest was dependent on virus replication.
