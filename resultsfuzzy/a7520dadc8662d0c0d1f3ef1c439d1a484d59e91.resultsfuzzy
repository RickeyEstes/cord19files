(a) Rationale for the use of the recombinant ORF expression vector pGE374 Fig. 1A diagrams the ORF vectors used in our experiments. In the prokaryotic expression vectors, pGE372 and pGE374, the 5' end of the Escherichia coli recA structural gene (35 codons), is located upstream from the E. coli ZacZ gene, which lacks the promoter and translation start site. The IacZ gene encodes a functional j?Gal. However, synthesis of the enzyme requires the recA transcription and translation initiation signals. In pGE372, the recA and IacZ genes are in-frame. In pGE374, the downstream IacZ sequence is out-of-frame with the recA A
