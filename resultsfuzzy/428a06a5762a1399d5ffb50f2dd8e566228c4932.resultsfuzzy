We first investigate how the vaccination dynamics changes with the cost for vaccination in both the purestrategy case and the continuous-strategy case in lattice population. The results are summarized in Fig. 2 where several obvious differences in the final epidemic size and the final vaccination level in square lattice are observed. Firstly, in Fig. 2(a) , there exists a value of c at which the final vaccination level f V in the pure-strategy case is equal to that in the continuous-strategy case, below which the vaccination level is smaller in the continuous-strategy case, while above it the opposite effect takes place. Secondly, in Fig. 2(b) , the final epidemic size f R in the continuous-strategy case is less than that in the pure-strategy case for all c below the high cost threshold. 2 Combining these two aspects, we found an unexpected phenomenon that a lower level of vaccination in the population leads to a lower level of spreading of disease in the continuous-strat- In order to explain the above results, we show several typical snapshots for the pure-strategy case and the continuous-strategy case in the equilibrium state in Fig. 3 . It is remarkable that the vaccinated population is scattered in the continuous-strategy case and clustered in the pure-strategy case. It is clear that the vaccinated individuals in the inner part of the cluster of vaccinated individuals have no effect on the spread of infectious diseases (during the epidemic spreading-stage). For convenience, we called those individuals, whom are not vaccinated and have at least one vaccinated neighbor, as indirect beneficiaries whom pay for nothing but have decreased infected risk due to their vaccinated neighbors. By doing extensive statistics on the number of indirect beneficiaries for any c, we found that there are more indirect beneficiaries in the continuous-strategy case than those in the pure-strategy case. For example, at c ¼ 0:3, indirect beneficiaries take up 39:14% of the population in the continuous-strategy case in Fig. 3(b) , vs. only 30:87% in the pure-strategy case in Fig. 3(e) . That is to say, although the vaccinated individuals are low, the area of influence (the number of indirect beneficiaries) is high in the continuous-strategy case. As a In the well-mixed population, it is almost impossible that an individual is surrounded by all vaccinated neighbors. In other words, every vaccinated individual will affect the spread of infectious diseases. Secondly, the area of influence is the same for both the continuous-strategy case and the pure-strategy case. So, there is no difference for the final epidemic size and the final vaccination level in the pure-strategy case and the continuous-strategy case in Figs. 2(c) and (d). Most of the strategies from the strategy set will disappear when the system reach equilibrium state in a single imitation mechanism [ Fig. 5(a) and (d) ]. Considering the diversity of choice in people, we incorporate strategymutation mechanism into the continuous-strategy case. We assume that the individuals may randomly choose a vaccination strategy again from the strategy set with probability l, which is the mutation probability of the vaccination strategy, after using the Eq. (1) updating their vaccination strategy in every season [ Fig. 1(b) ]. Because the individuals with strategy mutation randomly choose a vaccination strategy from the strategy set, the possible vaccination strategies for the individuals are conservative. As shown in Fig. 4(a) , there is a value of c, where the final vaccination level for different values of l cross at f V ' 0:5, below which, the lower the mutation probability, the higher vaccination level, while above it the opposite effect takes place. How can we find the special value c? There are two kinds of people, those who experienced strategy mutation and those who don't, in the whole population. The total vaccine coverage affected by the mutation probability l is determined by the change of the number of the two kinds of people. If the proportion of vaccinated is the same among the individuals experienced strategy mutation and those did not, the total vaccine coverage will be independent on l. As mentioned before, the individual needs to choose a vaccination strategy from the strategy set in the presence of strategy mutation, such that the average proportion of vaccinated among the individuals with strategy mutation is 50%. If the average proportion of vaccinated individuals in the total population is 50%, there is no difference for any value of mutation probability l. So, we can find the value c under which the vaccination level is equal to 50% in l ¼ 0. Below the special value c, the vaccination level will be diminished by the individuals with strategy mutation for the vaccination level is greater than 50% in l ¼ 0. So, the lower the mutation probability, the higher vaccination level. In Fig. 4(b) , we want to focus on the relationship between (f V ; f R ) in the stationary state for arbitrary c in [0, 1]. We show the relationship between the final vaccination level f V and the final epidemic size f R for the pure-strategy case, the continuous-strategy case without mutation and the continuous-strategy case with mutation when the value of c varies from 0 to 1. We can clearly see that the final epidemic size f R in the pure-strategy case is greater than that in the continuous-strategy case without mutation and the continuous-strategy case with mutation for all values of f V . The qualitative properties of the results obtained from the continuous-strategy case with mutation on ER network and BA network are the same as the results on square lattice (not shown here). Finally, we study the distribution of vaccination strategy for several different c in both the continuous-strategy case without mutation and the continuous-strategy case with mutation. The results are presented in Fig. 5 , from which we can see that the peak value is almost identical to the average percentage of vaccination Fig. 5(a) , (c) and (d). However, if the distribution of the strategies is truncated by the lower boundary, say x ¼ 0% , as reflected in Fig. 5(b) , the peak value will deviate somewhat from the average percentage of vaccination. It is clearly that the distribution of the strategies in the continuous-strategy case with mutation is more widely than that in the continuous-strategy case without mutation. The strategy-mutation mechanism can effectively guarantee the reappearance of the strategies of vaccination. If the value of the peak is less than 50% (c = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 in the lattice population and c = 0.1 in the ER network), the peak will move to the left when the mutation probability l increases. First, we assume that the population is in an equilibrium state of non-mutation mechanism. In this moment, we incorporate strategy-mutation mechanism to the population. As mentioned before, the average proportion of vaccinated among the individuals with strategy mutation is 50%. That is to say, the equilibrium state will be broken. Due to the self-interest, the rest of people will decrease the vaccination probability to reach a new equilibrium state. So, we obtain that the total vaccine coverage is increasing [ Fig. 4(a) ] and the peak will move to the left [ Fig. 5(a)-(c) ] if the value of the peak is less than 50% (the total vaccine coverage is less than 50%). If the value of the peak is greater than 50% (c = 0.7 in the ER network), the peak will move to the right when the mutation probability l increases. If the value of the peak is approximately equal to 50% (c = 0.3 in the ER network), the peak will nearly the same when the mutation probability l increases.
