PCR, the GM index and mycological examination were positive in respectively 10, 2 and 11 of the 13 cases of non-invasive chronic aspergillosis. Therefore, the sensitivity of PCR (76.9% CI, 54-99.8%) was considerably superior to that of the GM index (15.4% CI, 0-35%) (p < 0.005) and similar to that of mycological examination (84.6% CI, 65-100%). Positive predictive values (PPV) for all forms of aspergillosis were 71.9% (95% CI, 60.2-83.6%), 64.5% (95% CI, 47.7-81.3%) and 61.5% (95% CI, 48.3-74.7%) for PCR, GM and mycological examination respectively. However, considering these tools for the diagnosis of IA only, leads to decreased PPVs (Table 2) . Indeed, for the invasive forms, PCR yielded 54.4% PPV (95% CI, 41.5-67.3%) and 99.3% negative predictive value (NPV) (95% CI, 98.6-100%), while the
