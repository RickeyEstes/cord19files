The large conductance Ca 2+ -activated K + (BK Ca ) channel currents in response to resveratrol were examined in the condition of the intracellular dialysis with solution containing EGTA 0.15 mM and the extracellular solution containing CaCl 2 1.8 mM. The potassium outward currents were elicited by 300 ms depolarization of membrane potential to +70 mV from holding potential −50 mV. To evaluate whether resveratrol could affect the BK Ca currents in cortical neurons, the effects of resveratrol on the current amplitude were examined in the presence of TEA, a BK Ca channel blocker. The net response subtracted before and after treatment with TEA, was defined as BK Ca channel current. A putative BK Ca channel activator NS1619 was used as a positive control. The current difference between application of TEA, combination of NS1619 and TEA (Fig. 1a) , or combination of resveratrol and TEA (Fig. 1b-d) in the same cell was the component of activated BK Ca currents. TEA-sensitive K Ca currents recorded at +70 mV were not significantly altered after exposure to resveratrol at 10 μM (Fig. 1b) , whereas higher concentrations of resveratrol (20 and 40 μM) enhanced TEAsensitive K Ca currents. The peak outward currents recorded at +70 mV before and after exposure to resveratrol (20 μM) were 139 ± 18 pA and 230 ± 6 pA (n = 3), respectively (Fig. 1c) . Resveratrol (40 μM) further enhanced TEAsensitive K Ca currents. The peak outward currents recorded at +70 mV were 254 ± 12 pA and 622 ± 13 pA (n = 3), respectively (Fig. 1d) . The BK Ca channels are both voltage-gated and intracellular Ca 2+ dependent [41] , which are sensitive to TEA or paxilline [38] . When activated by cell membrane depolarization and elevation of intracellular Ca 2+ concentration, BK Ca channels allow the efflux of K + out of the cell, thus repolarizing and hyperpolarizing the membrane potential. This turns off voltage-dependent Ca 2+ channels and thus inhibits the influx of Ca 2+ into the cell. These negative feedback mechanisms allow BK Ca channels to play an important role in regulating firing properties. BK Ca channels are expressed in various brain neurons where they play important roles in regulating action potential duration, firing frequency and neurotransmitter release [34] . The present study revealed that resveratrol enhanced TEA-sensitive potassium currents, suggesting that it is capable of stimulating BK Ca currents in cortical neurons. To further elucidate the effect of resveratrol on the activity of BK Ca channels, the single-channel recording with a cell-attached configuration was performed in human cortical neurons. These studies were performed in symmetrical K + (145 mM) concentration and the bath solution contained 1.8 mM Ca 2+ . The cells were held at +60 mV. As shown in Fig. 2a , when resveratrol (10 μM) was applied to the chamber, the activity of channel openings was significantly increased. However, no change in single-channel amplitude was demonstrated in the presence of resveratrol. These findings suggested that its binding site should not be located in the pore region of the BK Ca channels. In addition, resveratrolinduced changes in the probability of channel openings were reversed by a BK Ca channel blocker paxilline (1 μM) (Fig. 2b) , revealing that the components affected by resveratrol are mediated by its action on BK Ca channels. Sodium currents were evoked by a depolarizing pulse to −20 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV. Being a positive control, TTX, a voltage-gated sodium channel blocker, significantly reduced sodium current amplitude (Fig. 3a) . Resveratrol (10 and 20 μM) significantly decreased sodium current amplitude at the level of −20 mV within 5 min, whereas resveratrol (5 μM) did not affect the amplitude of sodium currents (Fig. 3b) . To calculate the percentage inhibition of resveratrol on sodium currents, the cells were depolarized from −80 to −20 mV with a duration of 50 ms and the peak amplitude of sodium inward currents was measured. The amplitude of sodium currents in the control condition was taken as 100 % and those exposed to different concentrations of resveratrol were then compared. Fig. 3c illustrated that resveratrol (5-20 μM) reduced the amplitude of sodium currents in a concentration-dependent manner. In fact, the TTX-S sodium currents and BK Ca currents are important in shaping the action potential of neurons [3, 13] . The effects of resveratrol on cellular excitability were examined in rat cortical neurons with repetitive firings evoked by positive current injection. For the measurement of evoked action potential firings in currentclamp, the membrane potentials were held at −60 mV. During a 6 s injection of a positive current (ranging from 5 to 30 pA), repetitive firings could be evoked in these cells. The frequency (Hz) of action potential firings was determined by dividing the number of action potentials by the duration of the recording period. Resveratrol (20 μM) was applied into the chamber for 2 min and reduced the action potential firing frequency from the control value of 6.9 ± 0.3 Hz to 0.4 ± 0.2 Hz (n = 8) (Fig. 4a) . Similarly, when the cells were treated with TTX, a specific sodium channel blocker, or BK Ca channel activator NS1619 (5 μM), the frequency of action potentials was significantly decreased in embryonic rat cortical neurons (Fig. 4b, c) . The effects of resveratrol on action potential firings were also examined in the presence of two BK Ca channel blockers, TEA or paxilline, to evaluate whether resveratrol could suppress the increased excitability of cortical neurons evoked by inhibition of BK Ca channels. As shown in Fig. 5a , application of TEA increased the action potential firing rate from the control value of 3.5 ± 0.3 to 5.7 ± 0.7 Hz. In the presence of 20 μM resveratrol combined with TEA, the increase in firing rate evoked by TEA was reduced to 0.1 ± 0.1 Hz. In addition, when the cells were treated with paxilline, the action potential firing rate was also increased. After applications of resveratrol combined with paxilline, the increase in firing rate evoked by paxilline was significantly reduced (Fig. 5b) . These results suggest that BK Ca channel opening and sodium channel inhibition by resveratrol could underlie, at least in part, the inhibition of action potential firing in the cortical neurons. Resveratrol has been reported to stimulate BK Ca currents in human vascular endothelial cells and human cardiac fibroblasts [24, 51] , which might be associated with its cardioprotective effect. The present study demonstrated that resveratrol could stimulate the activities of BK Ca channels in cortical neurons. In fact, BK Ca channel is considered to be one of the intrinsic molecular determinants for the control of neuronal excitability in the central nervous system and play a role in the etiology of some neurological diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated the implication of BK Ca channels in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) pathology [22] . In fact, a selective BK Ca channel opener molecule (BMS-204352) rescues a broad spectrum of behavioral impairments (social, emotional and cognitive) in an animal model of FXS [17] . Resveratrol might be also beneficial to patients with FXS. BK Ca channels also play an important role in seizure etiology. Loss-of-function BK Ca channel mutations can lead to temporal lobe epilepsy, tonic-clonic seizures and alcohol withdrawal seizures [34, 35] . Paradoxically, some mutations in BK Ca channel subunit can give rise to channel gain-of-function that leads to development of idiopathic epilepsy (primarily absence epilepsy) [34] . Thus, both loss-of-function and gain-of-function BK Ca channels might serve as molecular targets for drugs to suppress certain seizure phenotypes including temporal lobe seizures and absence seizures, respectively. Actually, resveratrol has been found to reduce the kainateinduced temporal lobe epilepsy [16, 54] , suggesting that resveratrol might have potential for treatment of this seizure type through activation of BK Ca channels. There are nine recognized members of the voltagegated sodium channel family (Na v 1.1-Na v 1.9). Of these, Na v 1.1, Na v 1.2, Na v 1.3 and Na v 1.6 are highly expressed in the central nervous system [10] . In particular, the Na v 1.1, Na v 1.2 and Na v 1.6 sodium channels are expressed in cortical tissue [55] , which are all TTXsensitive [5] . Consistently, we found that the sodium currents recorded in the rat cortical neurons are totally blocked by TTX. It appears that Na v 1.1, Na v 1.2 and Na v 1.6 sodium channels should be the targets for resveratrol. It has been shown that resveratrol suppresses the TTX-S sodium currents in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons [21] that plays an important role in pain transmission [1, 53] . Inhibition of sodium currents by resveratrol may account for its analgesic effects [12, 14, 44] . The a Functional expression of the voltage-gated sodium current in embryonic rat cortical neurons. Superimposed current traces in control (top panel) and during exposure to 2 μM TTX (lower panel).

Current-clamp configuration was made in these experiments. All cells were bathed in Tyrode's solution containing 1.8 mM CaCl 2 . Trains of action potentials were evoked by a depolarizing current step. a Original potential traces obtained in control (upper) and in the presence (lower) of resveratrol (20 μM) by injecting a threshold current. b The potential traces obtained in the absence and presence of TTX (2 μM). c The potential traces obtained in the absence and presence of NS1619 (5 μM). In the presence of resveratrol, TTX, and NS1619, the action potential firing frequency was significantly decreased Fig. 5 Resveratrol reduced TEA-or paxilline-evoked increases in action potential firing in embryonic rat cortical neuron. a Action potential firing was measured in control, in the presence of TEA (1 mM), and TEA combined with resveratrol (20 μM). b Action potential firing was measured in control, in the presence of paxilline (20 μM), and paxilline combined with resveratrol (20 μM). TEA and paxilline significantly increased the action potential firing frequency. Upon application of 20 μM resveratrol in the presence of TEA and paxilline, the excitability was suppressed significantly present study demonstrated that resveratrol can inhibit the TTX-S sodium currents in rat cortical neurons. Several lines of evidence revealed that the pathophysiology of both acquired and inherited epilepsy is associated with abnormal expression or function of voltage-gate sodium currents [29] . The Na v 1.1 or Na v 1.2 mutations are associated with generalized epilepsy and inherited epilepsy [6, 19] . Together with the observations that the protective effects of resveratrol against seizure activities caused by kainic acid or pentylenetetrazole [16, 45, 46, 48] , our findings suggest that in addition to activation of BK Ca channels, blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels in the cortical neurons might also contribute to the anti-seizure effects of resveratrol.
