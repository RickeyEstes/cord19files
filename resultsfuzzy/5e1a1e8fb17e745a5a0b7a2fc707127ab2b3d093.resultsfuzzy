We investigated ACE2 protein levels after influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in CNE-2Z cells. The cells were infected with PR8 or CA07 at the multiplicity of infection (moi) of 1 and 5. Control cells were mock-infected with allantoic fluid from SPF chick embryos. The cell lysates were obtained at 12 hpi and 24 hpi, and then ACE2 protein levels were detected by Western blotting. The results showed that ACE2 was decreased after infection with two strains in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 1a and b) . ACE2 protein levels showed clear decline at a high moi of 5 at 24 hpi. The decline of ACE2 protein levels was also observed in 293T-ACE2 infected The cell lysates of CNE-2Z were obtained at 12 hpi (a) and 24 hpi (b) with PR8 or CA07 viruses at moi of 1 and 5. Control cells were mock-infected with AF. (c) Flow cytometric analysis of CNE-2Z cells infected with PR8 or AF (control) at 24 hpi using anti-ACE2 antibody. (d) The cell lysates of 293T-ACE2 were obtained at 24 hpi with PR8 or CA07 viruses at moi of 5. (e) Total RNA of CNE-2Z after 24 hpi with PR8 or AF (control) was obtained. PR8-infected A549 cells were used as cell control. ACE2 mRNA level was analyzed by real-time PCR. All graphs represent the means ± S.E.M. *P < 0.05 were considered statistical significant. with either PR8 or CA07 viruses (Fig. 1d) . Further, ACE2 protein levels in CNE-2Z cells were examined by flow cytometry. The fluorescence intensity of ACE2 was decreased after PR8 infection at 24hpi (Fig. 1c) . Then, the ACE2 mRNA levels in CNE-2Z cells were analyzed by real-time PCR; However, the ACE2 mRNA level was not altered after PR8 infection compared with mock-infected cells (Fig. 1e) , and as a control, there was hardly any ACE2 mRNA expression in A549 cell lines. These results suggested that influenza virus infection downregulated ACE2 protein levels. 3.2. Influenza virus-induced ACE2 protein downregulation was not due to ACE2 shedding, and it was not dependent on TACE We next asked if ACE2 protein decline was due to ACE2 shedding into cell culture supernatants. Firstly, the cell supernatants of CNE-2E and 293T-ACE2 were obtained at 24hpi after infection with PR8 or CA07 strains at a moi of 5; Control cells were mock-infected with AF. It was showed that ACE2 shedding into supernatants both from mock-infected cells and virus-infected cells ( Fig. 2a and b) . The ACE2 protein levels in cell supernatants were actually decreased rather than increased after infection with PR8 or CA07, which suggested that ACE2 shedding was not responsible for influenza virus-induced ACE2 protein decline. Previous study has demonstrated that binding of SARS-S to ACE2 induced ACE2 shedding in a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-␣)converting enzyme (TACE)-dependent manner (Haga et al., 2008) . So, we further tested if ACE2 protein levels in cell lysates would be increased after TACE knockdown. In order to efficiently knockdown TACE expression, CNE-2Z cells were infected with retrovirus expressing shTACE. TACE mRNA expression levels were analyzed by real time-PCR after 48 h retroviral transduction; and presented up to 70% knockdown (Fig. 2e) . However, ACE2 protein levels were not altered in cells infected with retrovirus expression shTACE compared with those expression shCtrl ( Fig. 2c and d) , which suggested that ACE2 downregulation induced by influenza infection did not depend on TACE. 3.3. ACE2 protein decline in cell lysates was related to ACE2 protein degradation by proteasome pathway ACE2 Shedding could not provide convincing explanation for the previously observed ACE2 protein decline in cell lysates. Then, Fig. 2 . ACE2 shedding was not responsible for influenza virus-induced ACE2 protein downregulation, and TACE knockdown did not affect the levels of ACE2 downregulation. The cell culture supernatants of CNE-2E (a) and 293T-ACE2 (b) cells were obtained at 24 hpi after infection with PR8 or CA07 strains at a moi of 5; Control cells were mock-infected with AF. The levels of ACE2 protein were detected by Western blotting. Densitometric analysis normalized to the corresponding control levels was expressed as fold change. (c, d) CNE-2Z cells were infected with the retroviruses either expressing shTACE or shCtrl. After 48 h, cells were infected with PR8 or CA07. The cell lysates were taken at 24 hpi, and then ACE2 protein levels were detected by Western blotting. (e) Real-time PCR analyzed TACE mRNA expression levels after a 48 h of retroviral transduction. All graphs represent the means ± S.E.M. *P < 0.05 were considered statistical significant. we wonder whether ACE2 protein decline was due to ACE2 degradation by proteasome pathway. So, we treated CNE-2Z cells with MG132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor (Lee and Goldberg, 1998) , or solvent DMSO as control. The results showed that ACE2 protein levels increased after MG132 treatment (Fig. 3a) . Moreover, MG132-pretreated CNE-2Z cells accumulated much more ACE2 protein after PR8 infection compared with DMSO-pretreated control cells (Fig. 3b) , which suggested that ACE2 protein decline induced by influenza virus was related to protein degradation. Accordingly, ACE2 protein degradation by proteasome pathway most likely accounted for the ACE2 protein decline after H1N1 infection as previously observed. According to above results that the decline of ACE2 protein size occurred very early after infection, we wondered whether there was a similar but extracellular effect on ACE2 molecular by treatment with influenza virions. Thus, recombinant ACE2 proteins of equal quality were directly coincubated with influenza virions or AF (control). The results showed that ACE2 protein levels were decreased after coincubation recombinant ACE2 proteins with PR8 or CA07 (Fig. 6a) ; and ACE2 protein molecular weight seemed to be declined. The results indicated that the shift of ACE2 molecular weight was most likely due to directly cleavage by influenza virions rather than cell surface proteases. Neuraminidase (NA), a major surface glycoprotein of the influenza virus, possesses critical enzymatic activity (Mitnaul et al., 1996) . Hence, it is reasonable to suspect that ACE2 molecular weight decline might be related to NA enzyme activities. 293T-ACE2 cells were transfected with either pcDNA-N1 or pcDNA-EGFP to generate positive expression of N1 and EGFP (Fig. 6b) . The results showed that cells transfected with pcDNA-N1 resulted in ACE2 molecular weight decline compared with those transfected either with or without pcDNA-EGFP plasmid (Fig. 6c) . The downregulation of ACE2 protein levels could also be induced by pcDNA-N1 transfection into 293T-ACE2 cells compared with cells mock-infected with AF (Fig. 6d) , which suggested that ACE2 molecular weight decline might due to NA enzymatic activity.
