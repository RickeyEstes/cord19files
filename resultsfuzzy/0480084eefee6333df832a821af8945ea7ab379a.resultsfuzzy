In the final models, the number of professional visitors, as well as the number of visitors in direct contact with animals were significantly associated with species, herd size and season (Tables 4 and 5 ). For both of the outcomes, species and herd size were included in the negative binomial part of the model (representing counts of visitors) while species, herd size and season were included in the logistic part of the model (representing the probability of no visits at all). Although an interaction between herd size and species was found, the models were not stable with this interaction term (i.e. resulted in extreme incidence risk ratios and confidence intervals) and it was therefore excluded from the final models. The geographical differences seen in the univariable analyses were not observed when other risk factors were accounted for. For both professional visitors and visitors in direct contact with animals, visits were more likely in large herds compared to small and medium herds. From herds reporting these types of visits, there were also more visitors in herds with cattle, compared to other species. However, the numbers of visitors in direct contact (i.e. including both professional and non-professional) were higher in hobby farms compared to large and medium sized farms. In addition, Total 1498 Contact-log response rates disaggregated by farm types according to species and by regions. *Selection was based on species and region. Reported species was not always consistent with species registered on farm. These respondents had not used the coded response letter and their selection strata could therefore not be identified. professional visits were less likely in summer compared to spring and autumn.
