In the present model, we especially care about the coupled effects of local movement and prearranged interaction. In this section, the following parameters are given. The overlapping size is d x = d y = 1. The overall spatial size is L × L = 100 × 100. The initial ratio of infected individuals is ρ I = 0.05. To reduce the influence of boundary effect, the segregated spatial domain is given as a square domain, that is, d x = d y . In Fig. 1 we give the time-dependent ratio of infected individuals ρ I for different time scale τ . In Fig. 1 (a)-(c), the ratio of prearranged linkage is φ = 0.002. In Fig. 1 Fig. 1(a) shows that,  for τ = 0, which corresponds to the situation where the contact between different individuals only results from random walk, ρ I increases slowly with time and finally reaches an intermediate level of ρ I ∼ 0.6. As τ increases from τ = 0.001 to τ = 0.1, the relaxation time decreases while the ratio of infected individuals in the final steady state increases with the rise of τ . Similar results are also found in Fig. 1(d) . Therefore, within the range of 0 < τ < 0.1, the existence of shortcuts between segregated spatial domains has a great impact on the outbreak of the epidemic. The ratio of infected individuals in the final steady state is sensitive to the degree of activation of the prearranged linkage. Different from the results in Fig. 1(a), (b) shows that, within the range of 0.1 < τ < 0.5, the ratio of infected individuals in the final steady state is insensitive to the degree of activation of the prearranged linkage. As τ increases from τ = 0.15 to τ = 0.45, the ratio of infected individuals in the final steady state keeps the highest value of ρ I ∼ 0.9 and changes little with the rise of τ . Similar results are also found in Fig. 1(e) . Fig. 1(c) shows that, as τ increases from τ = 0.5 to τ = 0.99, the relaxation time increases while the ratio of infected individuals in the final steady state decreases with the rise of τ . For τ = 1, which corresponds to the situation where the contact between different individuals only results from the prearranged linkage, the ratio of infected individuals in the final steady state is a low level of ρ I ∼ 0.37. Different from the results in Fig. 1(c) , (f) shows that, within the range of 0.5 < τ < 1, the ratio of infected individuals in the final steady state changes little with the rise of τ . Such results indicate that, for a small value of φ, which corresponds to the situation where the relationship network is disconnected, the existence of local movement can prompt the outbreak of the epidemic globally. For an intermediate or a large value of φ, which corresponds to the situation where there is no disconnected individuals or disconnected clusters in the relationship network, the outbreak of the epidemic is determined by the structure of the relationship network. As we keep an eye on the role of the prearranged linkage between different spatial domains in the outbreak of the epidemic, the role of activating the prearranged linkage in the present model is similar to the role of the existence of shortcuts in the two-dimensional small world epidemic model in Ref. [64] . Only activating a small number of the prearranged linkage can prompt the outbreak of the epidemic globally. In order to find the quantitative relation between ρ I and τ for a given φ and the quantitative relation between ρ I and φ for a given τ , in Fig. 2(a) , we give ρ I as a function of τ for φ = 0.001, 0.002, 0.004. In Fig. 2(b) we give ρ I as a function of φ for τ = 0.1. Fig. 2(a) shows that, for a small φ = 0.001, within the range of 0 < τ < 0.02, ρ I increases quickly from ρ I ∼ 0.58 to ρ I ∼ 0.78. Within the range of φ > 0.02, ρ I changes little with the rise of τ . For τ > 0, an increase in φ leads to an overall rise of ρ I . Fig. 2 (b) tells us that, for a given τ = 0.1, only within the range of 0 < φ < 0.008, ρ I is quite sensitive to the change in φ. Within the range of φ > 0.008, ρ I reaches its maximum value and changes little with the rise of φ. Such results indicate that, in the scenario where the individuals are confined to segregated spatial domain, the existence of a small number of shortcuts can effectively lead to a rise of the ratio of infected individuals, which is similar to the result found in the small world network [64] . The above results indicate that the evolutionary dynamics in the present model is determined by the mobility pattern and the connection pattern. To find out the relationship between local behavior and global behavior, in the following, the effects of three parameters on epidemic control are investigated respectively. The three parameters are: the area of segregated spatial domain s, the frequency of the interactions resulting from prearranged linkage τ , and the ratio of segregated spatial domains with activity restriction ζ (called slow domain in the following). Fig. 3(a) displays the averaged ratio of infected individuals ρ I as a function of s for φ = 0.01 and τ = 0, 0.001, 0.01 respectively. For τ = 0, as s increases from s = 9 to s = 121, ρ I increases quickly from ρ I ∼ 0.04 to ρ I ∼ 0.58. As s increases from s = 121 to s = 2601, ρ I increases slowly and finally reaches its maximum value ρ I ∼ 0.62. Increasing τ leads to an overall rise of ρ I within the whole range of 9 ≤ s ≤ 2601. The smaller the value of s, the more sensitive of ρ I to the change in τ . The above results indicate that, by narrowing the segregated spatial domain (called activity domain restriction in the following), the epidemic spread may be inhibited, the effect of which depends on whether there exists global interaction or not. A higher frequency of global interaction will make activity domain restriction become less effective. Fig. 3(b) shows the relationship between the change of ρ I , ρ I = ρ s=2601 I − ρ s=9 I , and the time scale τ . A log-log relation between ρ I and τ , ρ I ∼ aτ −b , in which a ∼ 4.2 × 10 −6 and b ∼ 1.53, is found. To find out whether local mobility restriction can effectively inhibit the global spread of epidemic, in Fig. 4(a) we plot the averaged ratio of infected individuals as a function of the ratio of slow domain ζ . In the slow domain, the moving probability is given as v slow = 0.1v. For τ = 0.001, as ζ increases from ζ ∼ 0 to ζ ∼ 0.9, ρ I decreases continuously from ρ I ∼ 0.74 to ρ I ∼ 0.4. For a larger τ , ρ I also decreases continuously with the rise of ζ but the slope of line becomes gentle. The above results indicate that, local mobility restriction may inhibit the global spread of epidemic, the effect of which depends on whether there exists global interaction or not. A higher frequency of global interaction will make local mobility restriction become less effective. In Fig. 4(b) we plot the relationship between the change of ρ I , ρ I = ρ ζ =0 I −ρ ζ =0.5 I , and the timescale τ . A log-log relation between ρ I and τ , ρ I ∼ a ′ τ −b ′ , in which a ′ ∼ 1.19 × 10 −5 and b ′ ∼ 1.46, is found. Such results indicate that the ratio of infected individuals is related to the average moving probability. An increase in the ratio of slow domain leads to a decrease in the average moving probability and then a decrease in the ratio of infected individuals. The results in Figs. 3 and 4 indicate that, to make activity domain restriction and local mobility restriction become more effective on epidemic control, we should firstly slow down the frequency of global interaction. Or else, both the epidemic control methods cannot play their proper role.
