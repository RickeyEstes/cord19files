Dr. Ganapathyraju and I are co-authors on one publication titled "Global genetic Competing Interests: analysis in mice unveils central role for cilia in congenital heart disease" published in Nature (May 2015). I was part of this publication for mapping mutations in mutant mice with congenital heart disease using next generation sequencing. Dr. Ganapathyraju had constructed an interactome with the genes recovered from the forward genetic screen. I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.
