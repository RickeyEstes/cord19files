Viral-vector rAd5 encoding S1 protein IM Immunization with rAd5 constructs expressing CD40-targeted S1 fusion protein (rAd5-S1/F/CD40L) offered complete protection to hDPP4 transgenic mice against MERS-CoV challenge and prevented pulmonary perivascular hemorrhage. DNA encoding S or S1 protein IM DNA encoding S1 protein elicited stronger antibody and cellular immune responses in mice than that encoding the S protein. Both DNAs encoding S1 and S proteins induced neutralizing antibodies that cross-reacted with MERS-CoV strains of human and camel origins.
