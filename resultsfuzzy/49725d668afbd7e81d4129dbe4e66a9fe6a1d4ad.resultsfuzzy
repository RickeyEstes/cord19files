When the two taxonomic group databases being compared yield similar scores for a query protein, this indicates that each group contains at least one protein with about the same degree of pairwise similarity to the query protein. A set of query proteins with scores that are similar between the two databases creates a diagonal between the two axes. When a point lies closer to one axis than to the other, this indicates that its best blast hit in the taxonomic group represented by the nearer axis has a greater degree of pairwise similarity to the query protein than its best match in the taxonomic group representing the opposing axis. Any tendency of a set of query proteins to skew towards a particular taxonomic group might suggest a common evolutionary origin for those sequences either through descent from a common ancestor, or through multiple horizontal gene transfer events. Each point on the graph is plotted based on the score of its single highest scoring hit in each of the target databases. In many cases, the target database provides many hits with scores that are nearly as high as the score for the single best hit. So the identity of the protein with the single best hit is only one representative of the group of all proteins with hits that exhibit closely related scores. The BLASTP bitscore is one of several metrics that can provide an indica-tion of the degree of similarity between two proteins. No pairwise sequence metric can definitively establish an evolutionary relationship between two protein sequences, but many, including bitscore, can give clues regarding protein similarities. The similarities can be collectively examined to gauge general trends in the similarity between proteomes, and individual similarities might be suggestive of evolutionary relationships between proteins, which may then be followed up using more rigorous methods of investigation, such as phylogenetic analyses, to assess the nature and likelihood of possible evolutionary relationships between individual proteins.
