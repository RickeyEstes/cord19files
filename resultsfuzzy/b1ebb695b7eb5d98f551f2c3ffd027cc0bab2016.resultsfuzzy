Real-time PCR assays were developed to the three parvoviruses detected here using HTS (horse parvovirus-CSF, novel eqcopivirus, and bosavirus). Real-time PCR assays using previously described conditions were used for equine hepaciviruses and the recently identified hepatotropic equine parvovirus-H pathogen [12, 19] . These PCR assays were then used on all 94 available equine plasma, CSF, and respiratory swabs (from 68 horses) described above. The positive detections are shown with Ct values that are inversely proportional to their nucleic acid target concentration (Table 2 ).  Real-time PCR assays were developed to the three parvoviruses detected here using HTS (horse parvovirus-CSF, novel eqcopivirus, and bosavirus). Real-time PCR assays using previously described conditions were used for equine hepaciviruses and the recently identified hepatotropic equine parvovirus-H pathogen [12, 19] . These PCR assays were then used on all 94 available equine plasma, CSF, and respiratory swabs (from 68 horses) described above. The positive detections are shown with Ct values that are inversely proportional to their nucleic acid target concentration (Table 2) . Bosavirus (originally reported in bovine serum pools) [26] was detected in every one of the 13 respiratory swab samples with nearly identical C T value. These respiratory swabs had been preserved in a transport media spiked with fetal bovine serum from the same commercial product. None of the other equine samples (plasma and CSF) were preserved using fetal bovine serum and none showed the presence of bosavirus parvovirus DNA by HTS or real-time PCR. Because bosavirus was originally described as a contaminant of fetal bovine serum [26] we ascribe its detection to the use of contaminated fetal bovine serum spiked into every respiratory swab sample. The most commonly detected virus was the new eqcopivirus detected in 16/94 samples (14/68 horses). Its highest detection rate was in 4/14 plasmas from respiratory cases. Three of the four plasma positive samples also had matching respiratory swabs, two of which were also positive indicating the presence of eqcopivirus genomes in both plasma and respiratory swabs and revealing a possible mode of transmission through respiratory fluids (Table 2) . When the eqcopivirus prevalence in plasma samples from respiratory cases (4/14 or 28.6%) was compared to that in plasma from healthy animals (7/41 or 17%) the difference (measured using Fisher's exact test) yielded a non-significant p value of 0.443 (Table 3 ). The next two most prevalent viruses were the hepatotropic parvovirus-H and equine hepacivirus both found in 11/89 samples including 3 co-infections. All detections were in plasma samples except for two hepacivirus positive respiratory swabs (Table 2 ). No evidence of higher virus prevalence was detected between cases and health controls (Table 3) . Lastly the horse parvovirus-CSF was detected in eight samples from eight horses in all sample types (plasma, CSF, respiratory swabs) also with no obvious association with either neurological or respiratory disease when comparing prevalence in plasma samples (Table 3) . When the real-time PCR Ct values were compared (using unpaired two tailed T-test with Welsh's correction) no statistically significant differences were found between cases and controls.
