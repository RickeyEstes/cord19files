Strong TcaR Binding to ssDNA Oligomers Revealed by EMSA TcaR is known to bind and regulate the ica promoter [4] . We previously identified that TcaR most strongly interacts with IcaR DNA1 (a 33-mer pseudo-palindromic sequence containing consensus sequence TTNNAA) compared with other designed IcaR DNA fragments [17] . However, when using the sense strand of IcaR DNA1 (IcaR DNA1S) and the antisense strand of IcaR DNA1 (IcaR DNA1A) ( Figure 1A ) as controls in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), the result demonstrated that TcaR shows a stronger preferences toward ssDNA fragments (IcaR DNA1S and DNA1A) ( Figure 1B) . To determine the type and length of the TcaR-binding site on ssDNA, a series of GC-rich and AT-rich ssDNA segments were designed ( Figure 1A ) [20, 21] . Their TcaR binding ability was tested using EMSA. As shown in Figure 1C , TcaR does not significantly interact with 17-mer GCrich (GC17) and AT-rich (AT17) ssDNA oligomers, but shows strong interaction with 33-mer GC-rich (GC33) and AT-rich (AT33) ssDNA sequences with a preference toward the 33-mer ssDNA sequence with a molar ratio of 1:1. Thus, we suggest that TcaR prefers binding to the 33-mer ssDNA. In order to evaluate the minimal DNA binding length of TcaR, GC-rich fragments of different lengths were designed. As seen in Figure 1D , GC-rich fragments with 33, 29, and 25 bases showed similar binding strength to TcaR; with TcaR forming a large, apparently multimeric complex with GC33, a small complex with GC25, and both small and large complexes with GC29 in EMSA. These results indicated that the minimal observed ssDNA fragment size to allow TcaR binding ranges between 17 to 25mer; providing useful information for the design of a DNA fragment with precise length suitable for crystal packing. Up to now, only three MarR family protein complex structures have been reported, and the first one is complexed with dsDNA [13, 16, 22] . The second one is complexed with salicylate [12, 17, 22, 23] and we discovered the third case which is complexed with antibiotics [17] . We have already obtained TcaR-ssDNA crystals and collected X-ray diffraction data to 3.6 Ã… resolution at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan), beamline BL12B2. However, the phase problem is still the main challenge and the works are currently under progress. Moreover, to investigate whether TcaR preferentially binds to ssDNA or dsDNA, the ability of ssDNA to compete with the TcaR-dsDNA complex was evaluated. For the competition assay, the IcaR DNA1 probe was preincubated with TcaR (dimer) protein to allow formation of the dsDNA-TcaR complex prior to mixing with increasing amounts of single-stranded GC33 DNA. It has been known that ssDNA products have lower migration velocity compared to its dsDNA counterparts in polyacrylamide electrophoresis [24, 25] . As shown in Figure 1E , ssDNA, as a competitor, interfered the binding of TcaR to the dsDNA, suggesting a binding preference for ssDNA. To further confirm this result, IcaR DNA1 and GC33 ssDNA oligomers were mixed, and their interaction strengths with TcaR were compared using EMSA ( Figure 1F ). Findings indicated that increasing the concentration of TcaR produces a ssDNA band shift greater than that for dsDNA, confirming a stronger interaction between TcaR and ssDNA. Moreover, to investigate possible pH effect of ssDNA binding activity of TcaR, a series of buffers with increasing pH were tested for their potential interfere in TcaR-ssDNA binding. As shown in Figure 1G , the EMSA results showed that TcaR had a strongest affinity for GC33 at pH 8.0 and the affinity was reduced by decreasing pH. Consequently, the result indicates that the ssDNA binding activity of TcaR is pH-dependent. To clarify whether the ssDNA binding site of TcaR is close, or identical, to the dsDNA binding site, a TcaR quadruple mutant (4 positively charged amino acids responsible for DNA binding mutated to alanines to produce R71A/K73A/R93A/K95A) [17] was designed and its ssDNA and dsDNA binding ability tested. As seen in Figure 1H , the mutant failed to interact with either dsDNA or ssDNA. This indicated that these amino acids are essential for binding in both ssDNA and dsDNA.
