The fractions of the susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered can be computed as a function of time based on the equations above and shown in Figure 1 for both MSIR and MSEIR models. The exposed and the infected peak at certain time and the recovered increases during the same time of period, which is consistent with observations and other models in the literature. Since k 1 and k 4 are functions of virus particle volume fraction and environment temperature, the fraction in each category should change with these two parameters, too. Besides virus particle volume fraction and temperature related terms in Eq. 2 and Eq. 3 , the remaining is related to virus particle radius and mass, and the spacial volume under consideration. Clearly, large virus particle size and mass lead to large rate constants. For clearly showing the relationship between rate constants and virus particle volume fraction and temperature, we may rearrange Eq. 2 and Eq. 3 as below: B and C are a constant for a specific virus and a spacial volume, when virus particles are under normal shear forces during a transmission. For simplification reason, we may assign a numeric value to both B and C, thus the impact of virus particle volume fraction and temperature on the fraction of the infected can be evaluated illustratively. The infected against virus particle volume fraction is plotted in Figure 2 . A much stronger dependence of virus particle volume fraction is predicted with MSIR model than MSEIR, possibly due to the buffering effect caused by the "exposed" category in the latter. For MSIR model, an explosive increase of the infection is predicted when virus particle volume reaches about 45%. It 8 All rights reserved.

The relationship between the infected and virus particle volume fraction seems to be reasonable, as intuitively more infection is expected if many virus particles are present in a system. Some researchers have already claimed that infectious disease transmissions are a percolation phenomenon in nature 36 and applied percolation theory to study epidemic spreading 36, 37 . Our prediction is in line with those research work. intentionally assign similar parameters for these two models for comparing epidemic difference. MSIR model predicts a earlier and higher infectious peak position than MSEIR model. S 0 is assumed to be 1. The infected is not only dependent on virus particle volume fraction, but also dependent on the temperature, which is shown in Figure 3 . The energy barrier term E 0 of course determines how temperature may impact disease transmission rate thus the number of the infected. The infected in MSEIR model shows a much stronger temperature dependence and decreases rapidly with temperature changing from 0 to 60 â€¢ C, while the infected in MSIR model just decreases a little bit with temperature. Higher temperatures definitely can reduce 9 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The original SIR and SEIR models only consider "the removed" that may contain both the recovered and the death. Figure 5 shows the recovered (a) and the recovered plus the death (b) against time, predicted with both MSIR and MSEIR models. Theoretically, the same rate constants obtained from the infected data 11 All rights reserved.

Unfortunately, these two groups of data provided by CCDC don't match each other and cannot be integrated into one model. If the same parameters like k 1 , k 2 , k 3 , k 4 , k 5 obtained from the infected data were used for the removed data regressions, the predicted with MSIR and MSEIR models were 8 and 13 times smaller than the reported, respectively, no matter that the recovered only or the addition of the recovered and the death is used. In average, there is almost 10 times difference between these two group of data. If the removed data are accurate, then the infected should be 10 times larger than the reported, which turns out that 724360 people should be infected by Feb. 17, 2020. Note that the regressions are relatively poor for the recovered and even worse for the recovered plus the death. The long latency period and lack of an effective drug to cure the disease may add complexity of claiming a patient to be fully recovered for this new kind of disease, which could contribute to the poor 12 All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is Another critical parameter in infectious disease is the basic reproduction number, R 0 , which can be computed with Eq. 29. With the parameters obtained from the infected data provided by CCDC, the calculated R 0 is plotted against time in Figure 6 . Initially, R 0 is really high, but decays rapidly and approaches a steady value. However, our method is straightforward and can potentially be used to standardize R 0 calculation.
