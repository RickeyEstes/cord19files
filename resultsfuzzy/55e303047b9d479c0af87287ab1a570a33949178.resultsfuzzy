Neonatal calf diarrhea is considered one of the most serious constraints of animal production. The incidence of calf diarrhea occurs all over the year with some increase in calving seasons. Schwartz and Dioli (1992) reported that morbidity and mortality rates due to camel calf diarrhea could reach up to 30% and 100%, respectively. Abbas et al. (1992) reported that camel calf diarrhea affects about 33% of the neonates causing 23% mortality in Sudan. In our study calf diarrhea was reported in 184 out of 2308 camels examined clinically during one year, the prevalence of diarrhea was found to be 8.0% in calves ranging from one month to one year. This was in agreement with Agab (2006) who reported an incidence of 10% diarrhea in a dairy camel farm in Al-Qassim region, central Saudi Arabia. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the epidemiology of camel calf diarrhea with emphasis on group A rotavirus and bacterial infections at six different areas in Saudi Arabia. Epidemiological data were collected either from camel owners or the pastoralists. It was noticed that there was no significant difference in morbidity rate among the six different areas of study as shown in Fig. 1 . A total of 308 camel calves were selected for laboratory investigations of which 184/308 (60%) were diarrheic calves. It was noticed that camel calf diarrhea is considered one of the main killing diseases of camel calves up to 6 month of age. The analysis of the data collected revealed that the occurrence of the disease was reported in all areas of the study and the statistical analysis using SPSS program showed that there was no significant difference in morbidity rates in the different areas of study as well as in the two seasons studied (Table 1) . The results obtained were in disagreement with the previous reports that the incidence of calf diarrhea increases during the calving seasons due to the increase in susceptible individuals with the persistence of the causative agent in the environment (Babuik et al., 1985) . In the present study three different techniques were used, latex agglutination and immuno chromatographic technique for the detection of group A rotavirus antigen in fecal specimens and ELISA technique for group A rotavirus antibody in serum. ELISA was and still considered as one of the main techniques that is used for the detection of group A rotavirus antigen in feces. Mohamed et al. (1998) was the first to report the detection of group A rotavirus in 11 out of 117 (9.4%) samples from 1 to 3 month old diarrheic camel. In our study group A rotavirus was detected in 48/256 (18.7%), 41/278 (14.7%) and 34/255 (13.3%) samples from one month to one year old diarrheic and healthy calves using latex agglutination, ELISA and immuno chromatographic techniques, respectively (Fig. 2) . Concerning the latex agglutination technique Hughes et al. (1984) described the use of latex agglutination test (LA) for the detection of group A rotavirus antigen in human stool. The high specificity and low sensitivity of LA was described by Al-Yousif et al. (2001) . In this work 28/169 (11.7%) positives have been detected in total specimen examined while 34/157 (21.7%) positives were detected in diarrheic specimens. It was noticed that most of LA positive samples (21 out of 28) were highly positive with ELISA. All latex positive as well as doubtful samples were from diarrheic calves, which may indicate that this test can detect group A rotavirus antigen only in high concentration. The test can be used to screen diarrheic fecal samples for group A rotavirus antigen, but negative samples have either to be tested by other technique or re-tested after being concentrated. The use of the immuno chromatographic test (IC) for the detection of group A rotavirus was evaluated by De Verdier and Esfandiari (1996) . IC was compared with ELISA for group A rotavirus antigen in 161 bovine, porcine and equine fecal samples. Eighty-nine percent sensitivity and 99% specificity of the IC test were found. In the present study IC test detected 23 out of 157 (14.6%) group A rotavirus antigens in diarrheic camel calf samples. The results showed a comparable sensitivity of IC and latex agglutination test although the results of both tests revealed some differences with the ELISA test. It was noticed that most of the camel owners ignore the microbial causation and believes that calf suckling during the hot weather mainly causes camel calf diarrhea naturally and they usually stop calf suckling when diarrhea is observed. This practice in fact is valuable in case of group A rotavirus induced diarrhea, as it was proved that the main cause of diarrhea is the persistence of lactose in the lumen causing osmotic drain attracting body fluids into the lumen (Flewett and Wood, 1978) . But there is usually no compensation by fluid therapy which explains the high mortalities observed that is most probably due to dehydration. On the other hand asymptomatic group A rotavirus infections detected in this study were prevalent infections, not incident infections The findings from this study suggest that asymptomatic group A rotavirus infections are transmitted through the same routes as group A rotavirus is associated It is therefore likely that host immunity, rather than infection route or dose, determines whether disease develops after infection or not. ELISA was successfully used to detect antibodies against group A rotavirus in human and various species including bovine, chicken and swine (Corthier and Franz, 1981) . In these works antibodies to group A rotavirus were found to be existing in camel sera from all areas of study as detected using ELISA with an overall percentage of 15%. The results of antibody ELISA obtained in this study indicated the low prevalence of group A rotavirus infection in the six areas of study which is completely different from that obtained by (Khatter Pandey, 1990 ) who reported antibody titers in more than 50% of the positive samples, which may indicate that the animal had been exposed to group A rotavirus infection several times, and most of the positive results were found in more than one year age group thus strengthening the hypothesis that those animals had been exposed to group A rotavirus several times. The first group A rotavirus infection was most likely to occur during the first month of age and at this age most of the calves receive group A rotavirus antibodies through colostrums. Maternal antibodies may neutralize the virus leading to absence or low titers of antibodies in serum, which then increases due to subsequent exposures. Positive group A rotavirus antibodies were detected in healthy camel calves and adult camels and then in diarrheic. This may be attributed to the fact that usually the antibody titers during the infection are low and increase to reach high level in recovered and clinically healthy animals in which previous infections were more likely to be occurred specially in endemic areas. Concerning the sex distribution of positive sampled animals for detection of rotavirus antibody, females were found to possess slightly higher positives than males in the different age groups tested. Generally the prevalence of camel calf diarrhea in this study is not high (8.0%) but it was at an alarming rate. Therefore attention should be focused on this problem.

Thus this work is considered as a screening test for this problem which should be considered by a team and should be well funded to cover all aspects of the problem. Brucella infection in farm animals is considered a great problem in most countries of the world. Thus, the early detection of Brucella infection in a herd or flock is a pre-requisite for the successful control and elimination of one of the major problems considered to be a predisposing factor leading to infertility and sterility along with the possible transmission of infection to man (Wasseif, 1992) . Camels are not known to be primary hosts for any of the Brucella organisms, but they are susceptible to both Brucella melitensis and Brucella abortus and the infection rate depends upon the infection rate in primary hosts animals in contact with them, this may further suggest the role of small ruminants in the occurrence of camel brucellosis (Agab et al., 1994) . The results of serological diagnosis of brucellosis in camels at different locations are summarized in (Table 2 ). Most positive cases (18.18%) were from Al Assafia location. Camels were tested serologically for Brucella antibodies, by ELISA and RBTP, positive result for the disease was found to be (8.98%) and (5.4%), respectively. Brucellosis in camels seems to display less clinical signs than in other ruminant animals. The survey of our study confirms the existence of brucellosis among camels in Saudi Arabia. The health authorities should recognize this and apply intervention strategies in order to prevent and control brucellosis in the future. The ELISA method used in this study detected higher reactors than RBTP, this may be ascribed to the fact that the test is more sensitive in detecting IgM as well as IgG immunoglobulin (Stemshorn et al., 1985) . Although Brucella spp. organisms were not isolated in this study because of inadequate facilities, the evidence showed clearly the occurrence of the disease. Prevalence of B. abortus antibodies and pathogenic bacteria in all age groups of camels showed that infection in the animals may have started early in life probably through suckling and persisted into adulthood (Table 3) . This is in agreement with Oloffs et al. (1998) , who reported that 30% of the sero positive animals in Uganda were younger than three years of age and among them was a 2-year-old bull. In this study E. coli was isolated from 99/170 (58.2%) samples during dry and wet season (Table 4 ). This may confirm the significance of E. coli in the causation of diarrhea in camel calves. These findings were in agreement to other investigators Salih et al. (1998) , Mohamed et al. (1998 ), Zakia (2004 and Abubaker et al. (2006) who isolated 66%, 40.04%, 22.55% and 27.3% E. coli, respectively. Isolation of E. coli does not necessarily mean disease unless virulence factors are identified such as toxins and/ or fimbriae (Yang et al., 2011) . In this study toxin producing E. coli strains (ET E. coli) were isolated from 7% of diarrheic camels (Table 4), which indicates the strong correlation between the camel calf diarrhea and detection of enterotoxogenic E. coli. Previous reports from various countries have reported Salmonellosis in camels, in Egypt (Osman, 1995) , UAE (Wernery, 1992) , and Ethiopia (Molla et al., 2004) . Moreover, Selim (1990) reported that healthy camels can be carriers of Salmonella species and Salmonella have been isolated from feces and lymph. Camels that are chronic carriers of Salmonella species may present a human health hazard through consumption of camel products (Matofari et al., 2007) . Continuous surveillance studies for Salmonella in human and animals are important, since new Salmonella serovars are emerging yearly and serotyping is very important to the epidemiology study (Kim, 2010) . In the present study, Salmonella species were isolated from 35/280 camel feces with the percentage of 14.7% as shown in Table 4 . The recorded infection rate of Salmonella species in camel feces is near to those reported by Molla et al. (2004) whose result was 15.1% and Salmonella species were isolated from camel-calf diarrhea (13%) in eastern Sudan (Salih et al., 1998) . On the other hand, a higher infection rate with Salmonellosis in calf camel (13%) was recorded by Salih et al. (1998) . The variation of Salmonella species incidence could be attributed to the overcrowding and transportation stresses which increase the excretion of Salmonella species.
