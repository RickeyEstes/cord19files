IV may influence host range, and, probably, gene constellations affects the relative replication capacity of viruses in different hosts (Parrish and Kawaoka, 2005) . Dominance of viral subpopulations in vivo can be due to cells offering higher permissivity to variant forms of a virus, or to depletion of cells due to cytolytic infection, and survival of other cell types permissive to other viral variants (Centlivre et al., 2005; Sala et al., 2006) . Cell dynamics can exert an important influence on short-term virus evolution and pathogenesis. (See Chapter 6 for a description of the dependence on host cell variation for the initiation of a persistent infection of FMDV in cell culture.) Not only nonstructural proteins, modifications in viral RNA may also contribute to host-specific viral fitness. RNA structural elements and mutations within the elements may influence the adaptation of arboviruses to alternative hosts (Ventoso, 2012; . From an evolutionary perspective, the capacity of viruses to use alternative receptors and to modify receptor specificity or intracellular preferences by modest genetic change-involving short distances in the genotypic sequence space (Chapter 3)-may manifest a necessity of viruses to parasitize increasingly differentiated organisms. Any virus whose capacity to expand cell tropism was limited by genetic The figure has been adapted from Núñez et al.

A large virus population size is the key to provide a sufficient number of variants with new potential cell recognition specificities. That is, the application of the Darwinian principles to longterm evolution of viruses is expected to have produced a flexible virus-host cell interaction in the sense that it may be modified by limited genetic change in the virus.
