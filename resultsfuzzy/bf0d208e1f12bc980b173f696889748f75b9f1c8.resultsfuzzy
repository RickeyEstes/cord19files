White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) ie1 promoter, in the context of a baculovirus vector, has shown strong activity in many cell lines (Liu et al., 2005; ; unpublished data). To explore the potential of baculovirus-based vaccine against H5N1 virus, we constructed a recombinant baculovirus containing a HA-expression cassette under the control of WSSV ie1 promoter, named as vAc-HA (Fig. 1A) . Based on this virus, we also constructed a HA-expression baculovirus vector containing one VSV G-expression cassette under the control of baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, named as vAc-G-HA (Fig. 1A) . For the generation of the recombinant baculovirus vectors, AcMNPV polyhedrin promoter-controlled VSV G expression cassette or WSSV ie1 promoter-controlled HA expression cassette were inserted into the shuttle vector pFastBac1 and integrated into the baculovirus genome within DH10BACÃ¤ according to the protocol of Bac-To-Bac system (Invitrogen). HA cDNA was then placed upstream of the SV40 terminator in pFastBac1 vector and downstream of WSSV ie1 promoter. A control virus, vAc-Bacmid, was constructed by integrating empty pFastBac1 vector into bacmid genome (Fig. 1A) . Infection of insect Sf9 cells with vAc-G-HA resulted in extensive cell-cell fusion (Fig. 1B) . The phenotype was due to the very high expression level of VSV G protein with membrane-fusion activity by polyhedrin promoter [18] . We also examined the kinetics of virion production in Sf9 cells through generating a one-step growth curve of infectious virus production (Fig. 1C) . The temporal kinetics of the growth curves [16] of these viruses were similar, although peak virion production of vAc-G-HA lagged behind those of vAc-HA and control vAc-Bacmid. Titer of vAc-G-HA increased to 10 9 PFU (plaque forming unit)/ml at 120 h p.i., while vAc-HA and vAc-Bacmid generated the same titer at 96 h p.i. (Fig. 1C) . The extensive syncytium formation of Sf9 cells infected with vAc-G-HA might delay the release of virions in the late infection. We next purified vAc-HA, vAc-G-HA or vAc-Bacmid from the supernatant of infected insect cells by ultracentrifugation. To investigate whether HA was displayed on the membrane of vAc-HA and vAc-G-HA, the purified virions were treated with 1% Triton X-100 for 15 min to disrupt the viral membrane structure, and then viral nucleocapsids were collected through ultracentrifugation. Polyclonal antibody against HA protein was raised in Guinea pigs using His 6 -tagged HA1 as antigen [19] . Western blot analysis with the anti-HA1 serum showed that HA was detected in the purified virions before treatment with Triton X-100, and not detected in the collected pellet comprised of only viral nucleocapsids ( Fig. 2A) . Interestingly, we found that the HA was partially cleaved to HA1 and HA2 in both the infected SF9 cells and the purified vAc-G-HA particles, which was similar to that of the purified H5N1 virions (Fig. 2A) . These data suggested that baculovirus vector could display HA-like viral glycoproteins, with similar post-translational modification to their natural products. Western blot assay using anti-VSV G monoclonal antibody also indicate that, as expected, VSV G was membrane associated structural component in purified vAc-G-HA virions (Fig. 2B) . To determine whether the baculovirus surface-displayed HA protein sustained authentic biological property, we tested the hemagglutination activity of purified virions of vAc-HA and vAc-G-HA (Fig. 2C) . Every 25 ll of vAc-HA or vAc-G-HA at a titer of 10 10 PFU/ml gave a hemagglutination titer of around 2 8 in the standard hemagglutination assay [21] . Our results indicated that co-display of VSV G with HA would not significantly reduce the displaying efficiency of HA on baculovirus membrane. To test the ability of ie1 promoter to express HA gene in non-insect cell lines transduced with baculovirus, transduction assay [17] was performed with vAc-G-HA in two typical cell lines available here: canine MDCK and chicken Df-1 cells. Fig. 2D showed that vAc-G-HA efficiently transduced the tested cell lines as indicated by the positive fluorescent cells. The expression was further confirmed by Western blot analysis of the total cellular extract with anti-HA1 serum as shown in Fig. 2E . Transduction of these cells with vAc-HA also resulted in the expression of HA but with less efficiency (data not shown). The immunogenicity of vAc-G-HA and vAc-HA was then subsequently investigated through intra-muscularly immunization of 7 week BALB/c mice (five mice each group) with purified virions. The inactivated H5N1/PR8 vaccine strain (provided by CDC, United States) amplified from MDCK cells was used as positive control; while vAc-Bacmid vaccinated mice served as negative control. At 4 weeks after intramuscular vaccination with 256 HA unit of purified baculovirus particles or inactivated H5N1/PR8 virus, the mice were boosted with same amount of virions. One week later, the mice were bled through retro-orbital plexus, and the pooled serum from each group of 5 mice was tested individually for antibodies against HA by ELISA [20] and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays [21] . ELISA test was set up to monitor the HA-specific antibody level by coating 96-well microplates with 60 ng purified His 6 -tagged HA1 protein per well. As shown in Fig. 3A , mice immunized with vAc-HA or vAc-G-HA developed significant antibody response as detected by ELISA in which purified HA1 protein was coated as antigen; while the mice immunized with vAc-Bacmid displayed only background sera titer. Both vAc-G-HA and vAc-HA induced serum HI antibody responses in the immunized mice, with a titer of 2 6 (Fig. 3B) . The HI titers of baculovirus vectors were comparable to those mice vaccinated with the vaccine strain H5N1/PR8 that has an average titer of 2 8 (Fig. 3B) . The vaccine strain demonstrated a similar HI titer as the H5 influenza virus that was reported by Takada et al. [15] . In the ELISA test, antibody response induced by vAc-G-HA was around 18% higher than that of vAc-HA, which is in consistence with other reports that VSV G-containing baculovirus might have advantage in transducing foreign gene in vivo. Surprisingly, the H5N1/PR8 vaccine strain induced higher level of antibody response as shown by the ELISA; accordingly the induced anti-sera demonstrated four fold of HI activity higher than the HA-displaying baculoviruses ( Fig. 3A and B). The specific and significant antibody response from the baculovirus-vaccinated mice indicated that, the HA molecule displayed on the viral surface or expressed through viral transduction sustained its authentic antigenicity, although the baculovirus might be less immunogenic than the influenza virus as suggested in our test.
