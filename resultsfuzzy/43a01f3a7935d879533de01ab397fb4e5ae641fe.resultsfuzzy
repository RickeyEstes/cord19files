The abilities of the synthetic compounds to inhibit the protease activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro were evaluated. Briefly, IC 50 value of each inhibitor was assessed from the apparent decrease of a substrate (H-TSAVLQSGFRK-NH 2 ) by the digestion with R188I SARS 3CL pro as described previously. 28, 29 Cleavage reaction was monitored analytical HPLC and the cleavage rates were calculated from the decrease of the substrate peak area. Determining the kinetic parameters at a constant substrate concentration and different inhibitor concentrations assessed K i values. The initial rate measurements were determined as previously described using a fluorescence-based peptide cleavage assay with a fluorogenic substrate, Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans. 24, 30 The rate of substrate cleavage was detected by the increase in fluorescent over time (see Section 6.7). Tables 1-3 report the IC 50 and/or K i values as the mean of 3 independent experiments. In our previous report, inhibitor 1 was found to be a moderate SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitor with an IC 50 value of 9.5 lM and a K i value of 2.20 lM. In a first attempt to investigate the effects of the N-terminal substituents (P4-moiety) on the activity profile of 1 (Table 1) , the inhibitory activities of a series of aromatic (2a & 2b) and aliphatic (2c & 2d) carbamates were evaluated. None of these compounds showed inhibitory potency comparable to 1. The same result was obtained for the acyl derivatives, such as 2e and 2f. Interestingly, the derivative 2g (IC 50 = 6.8 lM), a phenoxymethyl carbonyl, displayed a slightly higher activity than 1. Thus, the presence of the phenoxymethyl carbonyl at the N-terminal position appeared to enhance the activity of 1. The molecular modeling study involving 1 and the 3CL pro enzyme ( Fig. 1 ) provided insight and understanding into the binding of the inhibitor to the active site of the enzyme (See Section 4 and Fig. 2) . The introduction of a spacious warhead group (P1 0 ) was suggested as a means for increasing the inhibitory activity; therefore, we modified inhibitor 1 to include larger units, such as 4,5dimethylthiazole, 5-methylthiazole, benzothiazole and a series of 5-arylated thiazoles at the P1 0 position. The compound bearing 4,5-dimehtylthiazole, 2h, displayed a lower inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 22 lM) than 1. Compounds 2i and 2j bearing benzothiazole exhibited four-to fivefold higher activities (2i; IC 50 = 1.7 lM, 2j; IC 50 = 2.3 lM) than 1 and 10-to 13-fold higher activities than 2h. Notably, 2i exhibited very potent inhibition with a K i value of 4.1 nM. This finding strongly suggested that the benzothiazole unit in 1 was a suitable chemical warhead group for occupying the S1 0 -site. In the subsequent studies, inhibitors 2i and 2j were advanced as lead compounds for further optimization. A series of electron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituents were introduced onto the phenyl ring of the P4-moiety of 2j. Indeed, compounds with an electron donating substituent such as methoxy, hydroxyl, or N,N 0 -dimethylamino at the o-, p-or m-positions (2k, 2l or 2m: p-, o-or m-methoxy, respectively; The most promising inhibitor was the m-N,N 0 -dimethylamino derivative (2p), with a K i value of 3.1 nM; however, analogs with an electron-withdrawing substituent (2q: p-carboxyl or 2r: pnitro) displayed relatively low potencies. These results strongly suggested that an electron-donating substituent on the phenyl ring of the P4-moiety was important and favorable to enhance inhibitory activity against 3CL pro . Isosteric replacement around the P4-scaffold in the context of 2j yielded notable differences from the inhibitory activities of 2j. Replacement of phenoxy (2j) with pyridinyloxy (2s) did not hamper the inhibitory potency. Interestingly, the potency was recovered upon phenylamino substitution (2t: IC 50 = 1.5 lM). The chain length between the P4-carbonyl and the phenyl group contributed significantly to the inhibitor potency, as indicated by a decreased in the activity of the analog 2u (IC 50 = 7.5 lM). A variety of substituent groups were introduced into the P2moiety (3a-d; Table 2 ). Initially, the stereochemistry of P2 and a size-appropriate amino acid residue at the S2-position in 2i were tested. Compound 3a, in which L-leucine was replaced with D-leucine, dramatically reduced the inhibitory activity. Replacement with bulky hydrophobic side chains, such as cyclohexylmethyl (3b) and benzyl (3c) resulted in solubility issue in the enzyme assay, and replacement with polar glutamic acid (3d) did not increase the inhibitory potency. L-leucine, therefore, appeared to provide a suitable stereochemistry and appropriate size for the P2-moiety to fit into the S2-pocket. This result also well correlated with the docking study. The hydrogen-bonding property of the pyrrolidone structure at the P1-side chain of 1 was studied with an imidazole moiety. As shown in Table 2 , none of these compounds (4a-c) exhibited notable inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CL pro . Thus, the cyclic amide (c-lactam) at the P1 site was crucial for potent inhibitory activity. The P1 0 -moiety was next examined by varying the 5-substituted thiazoles (5a-i; Table 3 ). The inhibitory activities (K i values) of compounds 5a-i are listed in Table 3 . Analog 5a (K i = 60 nM) showed 15-times lower activity than 2i; however, the other 5-arylated thiazoles (5b-i) generally exhibited very low inhibitory activities compared to 5a, although the K i values of some inhibitors, including 5b, 5g-i, were in the submicromolar range. These studies confirmed that the benzothiazole unit was appropriate as a warhead group for the P1 0 -moiety.
