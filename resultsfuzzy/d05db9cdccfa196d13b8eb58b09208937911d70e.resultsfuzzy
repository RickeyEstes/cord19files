Sequence retrieval of salivary protein and assurance of antigenic conduct. In order to design an immunogenic multi-epitope subunit vaccine, the sum of 33 A. stephensi salivary protein sequences was retrieved from the NCBI protein database. Major proteins name is salivary lysozyme, a salivary protein precursor, salivary galectin, salivary lipase, anti-thrombin anopheline, salivary protein SG3, salivary apyrase, salivary secreted serine protease inhibitor, salivary defensin and salivary cecropin. Among 33 salivary protein sequences, only 14 proteins were found to be antigenic as predicted by ANTIGENpro. These 14 sequences were selected based on their score obtained for the probability of antigenicity and all these proteins having a score of â‰¥08 23 . Obtained score for antigenicity probability clearly denoting the antigenic nature of selected protein sequences which can be used for the subunit vaccine designing 24 .
