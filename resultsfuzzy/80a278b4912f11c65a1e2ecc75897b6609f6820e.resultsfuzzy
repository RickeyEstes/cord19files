We thank the reviewer's comment. We also noticed that GLDC expression level in lung is lower than that in other organs such as liver and kidney. Nevertheless, we hope the reviewer agree with us that functionally important genes for disease pathogenesis are not necessarily the highly expressed ones. Although GLDC is not highly expressed in lung, rs1755609 is a strong eQTL in lung as shown in Fig 1B. 3. Line 254: "the outperformance...": compared to what? Certainly not to zanamivir administration. We meant that AOAA in mouse experiment is surprisingly better than that in cellular experiments of A549 cells. The "outperformance of â€¦" was followed by "We further demonstrated that in the H1N1-infected Balb/c mice, AOAA-mediated amplification of antiviral response and suppression of viral growth are even more prominent than its in vitro effect in A549 cells." 4. Please specify whether the mice were sedated or not for the intranasal inoculations. We followed the protocol approved by Lab Animal Unit of our institute, an animal center with AAALAC accreditation. In the approved protocol, mice are anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine cocktail which contains 70-100mg/kg ketamine and 10-20mg/kg xylazine prior to intranasal administration and inoculation. We have incorporated these details in the manuscript accordingly on page 14. 


Section:in panel 4e (panel 5e in the re-submission), we monitored gldc knockdown in the course of infection, i.e., 24 and 48 hours post infection, intending to verify gldc depletion throughout the infection experiment and to exclude the possibility that virus infection may boost the expression of depleted gldc. in fig 2, no infection was involved. the knockdown effect of gldc sirna has been consistently verified by western blot although we don't show the western blot result in
