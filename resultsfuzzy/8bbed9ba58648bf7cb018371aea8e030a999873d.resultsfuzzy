Of the 300 questionnaires sent to the primary care doctors of GOPCs, 126 were completed and returned, giving a response rate of 42%. Demographic information for the doctor respondents is shown in Table 1 . Since there is no primary care registry in Hong Kong, we were unable to compare the demographic information of the respondents to those of the rest of the primary care doctors in Hong Kong. When compared to the findings of the 2009 Health Manpower Survey on all registered doctors, we found a higher proportion of female doctors in our survey than in the Health Manpower Survey (57% male and 43% female as compared to 72% male and 28% female). The mean age of doctors in our survey was 36 years as compared to a median age of 45 years in the Health Manpower Survey. In our survey, 96% of doctors worked full time and 77% had a postgraduate qualification, with 55% having a diploma in family medicine, 10% a masters in family medicine, and 44% a fellowship in family medicine. Twelve individual interviews were conducted among physicians in two selected GOPCs between September and December 2009. Two themes were explored: increased workload and attitudes towards influenza vaccination.
