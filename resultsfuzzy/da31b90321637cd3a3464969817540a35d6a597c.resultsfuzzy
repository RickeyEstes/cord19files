We first present the experimental evidence for GO morphology change upon surface modification. We then present a series of fluorescence spectra of different reaction mixtures for the characterization and optimization of assay parameters such as the quenching effect of tau-FITC on bare GO, on antibodyconjugated GO and on BSA-blocked GO surface. Finally, we show how analyte tau can be detected across a wide range of concentrations based on the fluorescence-signal change of tau-FITC. The limit of detection and also selectivity of the assay are given.
