that the high dynamics of Zika NS2B-NS3pro complex detected by CD and NMR is mostly resulting from the C-terminal region of Zika NS2B, we cloned and expressed a His-tagged Zika NS2B(48-74) with the C-region deleted. Despite its low expression level and insolubility, by growing many liters of E. coli cells, we managed to purify a sufficient amount of NS2B(48-74) for refolding with NS3pro. Interestingly, NS2B(48-74) is capable of forming a soluble complex with NS3pro (Fig. 1E) . However, its NMR peaks are much more broad even than those of linked NS2B-NS3pro ( Fig. 2A) , most likely due to µs-ms conformational dynamics or/and dynamic aggregation. On the other hand, its intrinsic UV fluorescence spectrum indicates that its four Trp residues are similarly buried as linked and unlinked Zika complexes with the fulllength NS2B (Fig. 2D ). Most interestingly, as judged from its CD spectrum which has the maximal negative signal shifted to 207 nm and has positive signal at 191 nm (Fig. 2E) , this author/funder. All rights reserved.

However, despite being less disordered, this complex showed no detectable enzymatic activity even with the protease concentration up to 20 µM, suggesting that this complex is completely inactive. Previously, we have generated a truncated Dengue NS2B with the C-terminal residues deleted but the short NS2B lost the capacity in forming a soluble complex with its NS3pro. However, we generated another truncated NS2B with only residues 77-84 deleted, which was designated as NS2B(48-100; Δ77-84). Interestingly, NS2B(48-100; Δ77-84) was able to form a soluble complex with its NS3pro, which appeared to be highly disordered as reflected by its CD spectrum, as well as highly dynamic as judged by its NMR spectrum (12) . Together, these results clearly indicate that unlike Dengue one, Zika NS2B indeed has a dynamic and disordered C-terminal region even in the enzymatically active complexes with its NS3pro domain. Nevertheless, our results suggest that this C-terminal region is absolutely required for implementing the catalytic actions, implying that the closed conformation might be indeed the enzymatically-active conformation, as previously speculated (20) (21) (22) (23) 31) , because the deletion of the C-terminal region completely abolishes the potential of Zika NS2B-NS3pro complex to form the closed conformation. Additionally, despite being highly disordered, the C-region might have other functional roles such as to maintain functional dynamics to facilitate HCV replication (32, 33) . author/funder.
