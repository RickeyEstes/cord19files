A total of 37 clinical respiratory samples from patients with ARIs caused by a broad panel of DNA and RNA viruses or of unknown etiology were analyzed in a single mNGS workflow. Libraries were sequenced to a mean of 5,139,248 million reads passing quality filters (range: 270,975 to 13,586,456 reads). Human sequences represented the main part of NGS reads for both positive samples (mean = 61.3%) and negative samples (mean = 67.1%), but not of NTC which was mainly composed of bacterial reads (67.8%). The proportion of viral reads ranged from 0.006 to 85.2% (mean = 9.6% for positive samples and 0.6% for negative samples, Additional file 1). Viral metagenomic results were then validated according to the criteria described in the Methods section. QCT1 (MS2 molecular detection performed before library preparation) was negative for NTC. After sequencing, viral contamination represented 0.13% (4245/3,215,616) of the total reads generated from NTC including 2 MS2 reads (MS2 RPKM = 173). For targeted viruses, 21 reads (RPKM = 480) and 185 reads (RPKM = 1.1E + 04) mapping to influenza A(H3N2) and HBoV were detected, respectively. The positive EQC was successfully detected at QCT1 (MS2 PCR positive at 25 Ct) and after the sequencing step (QCT2; MS2 genome coverage = 99.7%, MS2 RPKM = 5.5E + 05). Regarding IQC results, 37/37 samples passed QCT1 (MS2 PCR Ct values < 37) and were therefore further processed. A total of 33/37 samples passed QCT2 (MS2 RPKM > 0; Fig. 3 ). For these 33 samples, MS2 genome coverage ranged from 15 to 100% (Additional file 2). The 4 samples that did not pass IQCT2 included one sputum that was previously tested negative using real-time PCR (sample # 37), one HCoV positive sputum (sample # 11, Ct = 32), one HBoV positive nasopharyngeal swab (sample # 19, Ct = 30), and one nasopharyngeal aspirate tested positive for HBoV and CMV (sample # 23, Ct = 15 and 31, respectively). For sample # 37 and sample # 19, none of the real-time PCR targeted viruses were detected after bioinformatic analysis. For sample # 19, we sequenced a replicate which similarly failed both IQC and HBoV detection. We could not test any replicate for sample # 37 owing to insufficient quantity. Viral metagenomics results for sample # 23 were validated as viral reads represented 85.2% (9,489,578/ 11,144,324) of the total reads generated (Fig. 3) . For sample # 11, the number of reads mapping to HCoV was 9/ 5,125,947 with a HCoV genome coverage of 0.2%. Results were therefore not validated for this sample. Overall, mNGS results were validated for 34/37 samples including 26/28 positive samples and 8/9 negative samples.
