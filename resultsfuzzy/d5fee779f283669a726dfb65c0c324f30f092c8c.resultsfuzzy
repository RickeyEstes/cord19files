Because subsequent interpretation of mucosal lymphocyte population data depended upon confirmation that IEL and LPL were not contaminated by substantial numbers of lymphocytes from underlying locations, the ileum pieces snap-frozen at each processing step were carefully examined by light microscopy. Fig. 1 contains photomicrographs of representative hematoxylin stained ileum pieces obtained from 1.5-week-old calf ileum, with Peyer's patch designated P: intact ileum (panel A), ileum after IEL removal'(pane1 B), and ileum after LPL removal (panel C). Before processing, ileum contained readily recognizable intact villi (panel A arrow). Removal of IEL resulted in retention of an essentially intact lamina propria compartment (panel B arrow). Continuous Peyer's patch nodules also remained intact. Because nearly all of the IEL and most of the epithelial cells were removed, the villi appeared collapsed. Digestion of the lamina propria membrane released numerous underlying lymphoid cells. However, the process was not complete, as many LPL remained attached (panel C arrow). Continuous Peyer's patch remained intact as well; thus, the resulting LPL did not contain Peyer's patch cells. These results were consistent with those reported by other investigators for these procedures (Wilson et al., 1986; Myers and Schat, 1990) , and indicated that the cell suspensions recovered from epithelium and lamina propria contained only the cells normally found in those locations in the intact ileum. IEL and LPL from calves from the three age groups were compared to determine the extent to which the ileal mucosa became populated with lymphocytes after birth. Fig. 2 contains a representative set of photomicrographs of sections of hematoxylin and eosin stained ileum from a newborn calf (panel A) and a 1.5-week-old animal (panel B). The newborn calf ileum contained relatively few lymphoid cells, when compared with ileum from the older animal, suggesting incomplete development of the lymphoid compartment of calf ileal mucosa at birth. The number of lymphoid cells recovered from ileal mucosa was consistent with a paucity of lymphocytes in newborn calf ileum (Fig. 3) . Over 2 x lo7 lymphoid cells were recovered from villous epitbelium of newborn animals, compared with 7 X 10' cells for 1.5-week-old calves. This represented a significant increase (P = 0.034) in the number of IEL recovered from 1.5-week-old calves compared with newborns. Approximately 1 X lo8 lymphoid cells were recovered from villous epithelium of 3-week-old animals, a substantial, but not statistically significant, increase when compared with 15week-old animals. The number of lamina
