Study duration and treatment compliance. The median participation in the study was 29 days for both groups, with a range of 3-57 days with BNO 1016 and 3-86 days with placebo. Compliance with treatment, according to tablet count, was 99.7% in the BNO 1016 group and 100.2% in the placebo group. Major symptom score (MSS). The baseline (mean MSS) at enrolment was without statistical differences between the two treatment groups (Table I) . MSS improved gradually in both groups during the 15-day treatment period by a mean of 10.02 ± 1.61 to 2.47 ± 2.55 for BNO 1016 and 9.87 ± 1.52 to 3.63 ± 3.63 with placebo (Table I, Figure 2 ). The difference between treatment groups at visit 5 was statistically significant in favor of the BNO 1016 product (FAS, p < 0.0001). An obvious difference in MSS between the two groups was already evident at visit 4 (day 10), indicating a faster recovery for the BNO 1016 group, showing a difference of 0.94 score points with mean scoring values Figure 3 shows combined analysis of ARhiSi-1 and ARhiSi-2: response (healed or improved) to treatment from visit 2 (day 3) to visit 5 (day 14). Quality of life measures. SNOT-20 total score results are shown in Table IV . A highly significant difference in favor of BNO 1016 was evident at the end of treatment (p = 0.0015). Safety results. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were not reported in either the ARhiSi-1 or the ARhiSi-2 trial. In ARhiSi-1 a total of 42 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 33 patients of the SEP (safety evaluable population, n = 450): 33 AEs in 26/300 patients (8.7%) under
