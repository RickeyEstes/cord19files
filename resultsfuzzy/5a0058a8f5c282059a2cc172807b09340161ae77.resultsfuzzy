Laboratory results are summarized in Table 1 . Complete blood count indicated total nucleated cell count within the normal ranges for all horses throughout the study. Additionally, mild lymphopenia (reference range, 1600-5800 cells/Î¼L) was noted in 2 horses of group 1 at 4 DPI (Table 1 and Figure 1 ) and in 2 horses of group 2 (Table 1 and (Table 1) for 2, usually nonconsecutive, days. In group 1 horses, nasal shedding occurred 2 days after onset of fecal shedding. In group 2 horses, nasal shedding occurred 3-5 days after exposure, and 3 days before onset of fecal shedding. Only Horse 4 exhibited detectable viremia at 12 DPI (Table 1 ).
