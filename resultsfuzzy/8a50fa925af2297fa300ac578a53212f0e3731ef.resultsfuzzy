The X-ray structure of HIV-1 RTeDNA complex after incorporation of tenofovir diphosphate is an ideal starting point for further rational and targeted drug design (Fig. 2a) . 17 In the complex, two amino acid residues (Arg 72 and Gln 151) in the binding site of the HIV-1 RT are oriented towards the C-2 0 methyl group of tenofovir diphosphate (Fig. 2a ). Apparent incapability of the C-2 0 methyl group to substantially interact with the two polar amino acids of the HIV-1 RT led us to reason that replacement of the C-2 0 methyl with a polar group able to interact with Arg 72 and/or Gln 151 would increase the binding affinity of such an inhibitor to HIV-1 RT. Our docking studies indicated that replacement of the C-2 0 methyl group of tenofovir diphosphate (Fig. 2a) with a carboxyl group could, theoretically, lead to formation of up-to four new hydrogen bonds with arginine 72 and glutamine 151 (Fig. 2b) . The initial docking studies indicated that (S)-CPMEA (7a, Fig. 1 ), an analogue of PMEA (1) bearing a carboxyl group at the C-2 0 position of the aliphatic chain, potentially is a good candidate for strong binding affinity in the enzyme pocket of HIV-1 RT. Moreover, (S)-CPMEA (7a) can be considered to be a direct structural modification of PMPA (2) or HPMPA (3) with oxidized 2 0 -methyl or 2 0hydroxymethyl functions, respectively, or can also be looked upon as an O-phosphonomethyl derivative of AHPA (6, Fig. 1 ). Thus, compound 7a, as well as the other CPME analogues, was expected to display a wide range of biological properties. Generally, two strategies could be utilized for the synthesis of the target analogue, (S)-CPMEA (7a, Fig. 1 ): (a) direct oxidation of the properly protected HPMPA followed by the removal of the protecting groups and (b) alkylation of adenine (or 6-chloropurine) with a suitable alkylating agent containing the protected carboxylic function, followed by deprotection (and ammonolysis in the case of 6-chloropurine). The oxidation of the protected HPMPA derivative seems to be the more relevant and straightforward method for the synthesis of the compound 7a, while the 'synthon' approach seems to be too laborious and less effective. Thus, diisopropyl (S)-9-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine (8a, Scheme 1) was chosen as the suitable starting material. This can be prepared in sufficient amounts according to the previously described procedures. 18 Nowadays, there are a considerable number of oxidizing agents, which can be used under relatively mild reaction conditions and which tolerate number of functional groups. 19 Our goal was to develop a simple, mild and clean oxidation of the HPMPA derivative 8a, which would tolerate the presence of the unprotected amino group at the C-6 position of the purine moiety. The conversion of the 5 0 -hydroxyl group of 2 0 ,3 0 -protected purine nucleosides to the corresponding 5 0 -uronic acids is often accomplished by oxidation with an excess of KMnO 4 in aqueous KOH solution under conditions of high dilution. 20 An attempted oxidation of compound 8a under analogous reaction conditions only led to complex reaction mixtures (TLC). A simple and efficient oxidative conversion of primary alcohols to the corresponding methyl esters using I 2 /K 2 CO 3 in MeOH has been reported by Mori and Togo. 21 Nevertheless, an attempt to prepare the methyl ester of derivative 9a by the direct oxidative esterification of compound 8a under the reported reaction conditions was not successful (Table 1) . Ruthenium tetroxide (RuO 4 ), another widely used oxidizing agent, 19 is ideal when a very vigorous oxidizing agent is needed but mild reaction conditions must be maintained. Since RuO 4 can decompose explosively, it is mostly prepared in situ by oxidation of RuCl 3 or RuO 2 . A mild oxidation of nucleosides to the corresponding 5 0 -carboxylic acids by use of RuCl 3 /NaIO 4 and RuCl 3 /K 2 S 2 O 8 /KOH systems has been reported. 22 Since RuCl 3 was found to be a very hygroscopic reagent, not easy to handle, RuO 2 was our oxidizing agent of choice. Oxidation of diisopropyl HPMPA (8a) with RuO 2 /NaIO 4 afforded the derivative 9a in a satisfactory yield (63%, Table 1 ). The oxidation was carried out in a mixture of acetonitrile, chloroform, and water (1:1:2) according to the described procedure used for the preparation of adenosine 5 0 -uronamides, 23 with an addition of concentrated HCl to pH 2.5. Despite the good isolated yield, purification was tedious and column chromatography had to be repeated several times to obtain pure (S)-CPMEA derivative 9a, probably owing to the fact that phosphonates strongly bind metal ions. Thus, a cleaner and less laborious procedure was still desirable. Commercially available 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) is a reagent of choice for oxidation of various organic substrates. 24 TEMPO belongs to the class of stable organic nitroxyl radicals commonly used for the oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols. 19, 24 Mild and efficient oxidation of alcohols to ketones and aldehydes using catalytic amounts of TEMPO and stoichiometric amounts of [bis(acetoxy)iodo]benzene (BAIB) has been developed. 25 This method differs from most other TEMPO-mediated oxidations in that it generates acetic acid and iodobenzene as by-products and avoids inorganic contaminants. 25 This oxidizing system was successfully employed for the oxidation of 2 0 ,3 0 -protected nucleosides to give the corresponding 5 0 -carboxylic acids. 26 In our case, oxidation of HPMPA derivative 8a with the TEMPO/BAIB oxidizing system afforded the expected product 9a in a 71% yield (Table 1 ). An even better yield (87%) of the (S)-CPMEA derivative 9a was achieved when BAIB was replaced with NaClO 2 /NaClO (sodium hypochlorite is a readily available and inexpensive oxidant, household bleach). This oxidizing system (TEMPO/NaClO 2 /NaClO) 27 offers a clean reaction and easy work-up based on the isolation of the product by flash chromatography on silica gel followed by crystallization. This efficient procedure offered compound 9a in very high purity. Finally, the desired product (S)-CPMEA (7a) was obtained in a 76% yield by ester cleavage of compound 9a under the standard conditions (Me 3 SiBr in MeCN). 28 Analogously, oxidation of enantiomeric diisopropyl (R)-HPMPA (8b) using the TEMPO/NaClO 2 /NaClO system afforded the derivative 9b in a 70% yield. Subsequent deprotection of compound 9b gave the free phosphonic acid 7b in a 50% yield. Unfortunately, none of the oxidizing systems listed in Table 1 afforded (S)-CPMEA (7a) by direct oxidation of free HPMPA (3, Fig. 1 ), confirming the importance of the diester protection of the phosphonate group during the procedure, and synthetic transformations in general. Eventually, we decided to verify the more general applicability of our optimized oxidation protocol, and it was utilized for the preparation of CPME derivatives bearing other nucleobases (Scheme 2, Table 2 ). Thus, the expected diisopropyl CPME analogues 9 were obtained by the oxidation of the corresponding HPMP derivatives 8 with TEMPO/NaClO 2 /NaClO in high yields (76e87%). The functional groups of the unprotected nucleobases are usually very well tolerated during the oxidation process. The only problem was observed with compounds bearing 2-aminopurine bases containing a guanidine motif (guanine and 2,6-diamino purine). Treatment of the HPMPG derivative 8g 18b and HPMPDAP derivative 8h 18b with TEMPO/NaClO 2 /NaClO gave complex and colourful reaction mixtures and no desired products were isolated (entries 7 and 8, respectively, Table 2 ). To overcome the undesirable reactivity of the 2-aminopurine bases, we decided to protect the amino groups of compounds 8g and 8h with the benzoyl group. Thus, the N 2 -benzoylguanine derivative 8i 18b was prepared in 49% yield from compound 8g in pyridine by sequential treatment with Me 3 SiCl, BzCl, water and aqueous ammonia (Scheme 3). Subsequent oxidation of the benzoyl derivative 8i with TEMPO/NaClO 2 /NaClO afforded the carboxy analogue 9i in 78% yield (Table 2, entry 9). Direct deprotection of the phosphonate moiety of compound 9i using Me 3 SiBr in acetonitrile 28 afforded the N 2 -benzoylguanine derivative 7i in 52% yield (Table 2, entry 9, Scheme 3). In order to obtain CPMEG (7g), the benzoyl group of derivative 9i was removed first, using MeONa solution, followed by the removal of the isopropyl groups from the intermediate 9g (Scheme 3) . Analogously, the HPMPDAP analogue 8h was protected as its dibenzoyl derivative 8j (in 47% yield), which was then efficiently oxidized using the TEMPO/NaClO 2 /NaClO system to compound 9j in 80% yield (Table 2 , entry 10, Scheme 4). Finally, CPMEDAP (7h) was obtained in 38% yield from compound 9j by simultaneous hydrolysis of both benzoyl groups and diisopropyl esters using 1 M Scheme 1.
