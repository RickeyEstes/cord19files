Expression, purification, and biochemical characterization of MHV-S HE We produced the ectodomain of MHV-S HE (residues 25-403) as an Fc-fusion protein, either in enzymatically active (HE-Fc) or inactive form (HE 0 -Fc), by transient transfection of HEK293 cells. MHV-S HE 0 -Fc bound to horse serum glycoproteins (HSG), which are decorated with 4-O-acetylated sialic acids (4-O-Ac-Sia), but carry little to no 9-O-Ac-Sias (Figure 2A ; [29] ). The receptor determinants in HSG could be destroyed by treatment with MHV-S HE-Fc, but not by treatment with BCoV-Mebus HE-Fc (a sialate-9-O-acetylesterase; Figure 2B ). No binding of MHV-S HE 0 -Fc was observed to bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM), a glycoconjugate devoid of 4-O-Ac-Sias (Figure 2A ; [30] ). The MHV-S HE ectodomain, released from HE-Fc by thrombincleavage, retained proper sialate-4-O-acetylesterase activity when assayed for substrate specificity with a synthetic di-O-acetylated Sia (5-N-acetyl-4,9-di-O-acetylneuraminic acid a-methylglycoside, aN-eu4,5,9Ac 3 2Me; Figure 2C ). In hemagglutination assays, MHV-S HE 0 specifically bound to 4-O-acetylated Sias ( Figure 2D ). The combined findings show that the recombinant MHV-S HE proteins are biologically active, both as Fc fusion proteins (Figures 2A and B) and after the removal of the Fc tail by thrombin-cleavage ( Figures 2C and D) , which we take as an indication for proper folding and protein stability.
