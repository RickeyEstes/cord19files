The potential risk of indirect transmission through the contact of hands with virus-contaminated surfaces has been increasingly emphasized as a cause of the pandemic spread of influenza A virus, in addition to the classical direct transmission by droplets from the infected individuals (7, 8) . To quantitatively evaluate this potential risk of indirect transmission among college students, the present study analyzed the ability of influenza A virus to retain its infectivity and transmissibility on clothing worn by students in daily life. In total, nine types of clothing (Table I) that had been used for several months or years as ordinary clothes, with regular washing, were collected from students. Humans can produce respiratory droplets by several means, including breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing. Since there are natural variations in the number and size of such droplets generated from the same individual during these activities, it is difficult to determine the size and number of droplets. The size of the droplets exhaled by infected individuals vary widely (µm-mm). Although the droplets with a smaller size are likely to be dominant (9) , in the present study, a 10-µl volume (~2.7 mm in diameter if spherical) was arbitrarily selected to quantitatively contaminate the clothing with the virus. Namely, a 10-µl sample of virus preparation was deposited on the test cloths and the contaminated cloths were maintained in air for 20 min to mimic the actual situation that may occur between the time of clothing contamination and the time of exposure to the hands of the second individual. After leaving for 20 min in air, the cloths were transferred to glass test tubes, the contaminated virus was extracted with PBS containing 0.1% BSA by vigorous mixing with a Vortex mixer, and the amount of infectious virus recovered in the extract was measured. Notably, the measured values reflect only the infectious virus recovered in the extracts, not those irreversibly absorbed on the cloths. Such irreversibly bound viruses, even if infectious, are not transmissible to others. As shown in the last column of Table I , the amount of infectious virus recovered markedly differed among the clothing samples. For the jersey, one-piece, jeans and hemp pants, the recovered virus infectivity was below the level of detection, indicating that during the 20-min period, these cloths inactivated or irreversibly bound the influenza virus. These cloths were followed by the black sweater, parka and cardigan, in this order, with the cardigan the least effective in inactivation or irreversible virus absorption. There appeared to be essentially no or marginal loss of the virus infectivity for the T-shirt and white sweater. These results indicated that the ability of influenza A virus to retain transmissibility in contaminated clothing strongly depended on the nature of the clothes. Four clothing samples (jersey, cardigan, T-shirt and white sweater), that exhibited marked differences in the recovered virus infectivity at 20 min (Table I) , were compared for the kinetics of the loss of infectivity. Fig. 1A shows the time course, in which a trend is clear. For the white sweater, there was essentially no loss of virus over the 20-min incubation period (diamond), which was similar to the control (open circles), in which the virus preparation was inoculated on the inner surface of the glass test tube. For the cardigan (triangle) and T-shirt (square), a gradual loss was observed, while virus infectivity was rapidly lost for the jersey (closed circle). These results correlate with the relative remaining virus infectivity at 20 min, with the exception of the T-shirt. Variation for the T-shirt may have been caused by differences among the clothing samples with regard to the time necessary for the evaporation of water from the deposit, since we observed that different samples from the same items of clothing often showed variability in virus recovery, and this variability was often very noticeable among independent experiments. Although little experimental fluctuations were observed for the PBS control and the white sweater, both the cardigan and T-shirt, which were intermediate in virus recovery (Fig. 1A) , exhibited strong variation among the experiments, suggesting that recovery from these samples may be easily influenced by variations in the experiments. The presence or absence of these variations in virus recovery may be associated with the observation that the mode of absorption of virus-containing liquid into test cloths is quite variable among samples from different types of material, as well as numerous samples from the same item of clothing. For example, the absorbance of virus-containing solution was stable in all of the samples from the white sweater, whereas in some samples from the cardigan and T-shirt the solution was immediately absorbed, yet in others it remained unabsorbed for a longer period of time. These observations support the importance of water in the deposit for the maintenance of the infectivity and transmissibility of influenza virus on contaminated clothes. Previously, a non-physiological pH was shown to cause the inactivation of certain enveloped viruses (14) ; thus, pH alteration may be involved in the observed decrease in the virus infectivity recovered in the extracts. The pH of the sample cloths was measured by soaking in 20 volumes (volume/weight) of distilled water at room temperature for 3 or 48 h, with occasional mixing using a Vortex mixer. However,
