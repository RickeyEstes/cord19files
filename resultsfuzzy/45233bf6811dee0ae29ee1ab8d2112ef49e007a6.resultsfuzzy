It was shown that PRCV can replicate in the intestinal tract of 1-week-old HDCD piglets. However, pigs on farms usually become infected between 5 to 10 weeks of age, while having maternal antibodies. It still has to be determined if PRCV can replicate in the small intestine in piglets of this age and in the presence of maternal antibodies. Intestinal replication of PRCV could have important consequences regarding lactogenic immunity of pigs against TGEV infection if it induces anti-TGEV-IgA antibodies in the milk of sows by stimulating the gut-mammary link (Bourne et al., 1977 ) . 


Section:virus was excreted in the faeces for several days without being isolated from tonsillar swabs. the intestinal infection with tlm 83, therefore results in production and release of infectious virus into the gut lumen.
