We also investigated other recombinant proteins known to form soluble aggregates. Previously, we observed that the Clonorchis sinensis SPARC protein is refractory to soluble expression in E. coli. To prevent the formation of inclusion bodies, the protein was expressed by fusion with LysRS, a potent soluble carrier protein [10] . The RS-SPARC fusion protein predominantly remained soluble (>95%) after sonication, however, the soluble yield was lower (~25%) after mild lysis ( Figure 5A ). Most of the mild lysis protein pellet was transferred to the soluble fraction (>95%) after sonication, equivalent to the soluble yield obtained from bacterial lysates after sonication. However, the physico-chemical properties of the soluble fraction were markedly different in a simple Ni-affinity chromatography. Higher yield was noted for sonicated samples in the eluted fraction, yet a significant portion was present in the flow-through (FT) fractions (fraction #1-3) that did not bind the Ni-affinity matrix ( Figure 5C ). This failure to bind the Ni-affinity column was probably due to shielding of the affinity tag (hexa His peptide at the fusion junction) by oligomeric aggregation. In contrast, despite having a lower yield than sonication ( Figure 5B ), the recombinant RS-SPARC prepared by mild lysis predominantly bound the Ni-affinity matrix, with very little, if any, left in the FT fractions ( Figure 5D ). It is likely that exposure of the His-tag enabled binding to the affinity column, reflecting a proper folding of expressed protein. The smaller band (~70kDa), co-purified with the RS-SPARC fusion protein (~90 kDa, arrow), was probably due to proteolytic cleavage near the fusion junction [24] .

The smaller band (~70kDa), co-purified with the RS-SPARC fusion protein (~90 kDa, arrow), was probably due to proteolytic cleavage near the fusion junction [24] . The protein purified by Ni-affinity was analyzed by SEC. Properly folded fusion proteins were expected to form dimers due to the dimeric conformation of the LysRS protein [25] . The protein obtained by mild lysis was predominantly present as a dimer (~180 kDa), whereas the sample prepared by sonication consisted largely of oligomeric units (fraction #14, 1544 kDa) and void volume (fraction #9, >5000 kDa) in addition to the expected dimers ( Figure 6A ). The balance between dimers and multimeric oligomers differed significantly in the two samples when examined by SDS-PAGE ( Figure 6B ). Our results suggest that the presence of soluble oligomeric aggregates was a general phenomenon in the recombinant expression of target proteins, and further highlights the importance of screening the physico-chemical quality of soluble proteins at the beginning of purification.
