Epidemic forecasting will be demonstrated using an experimental data set obtained using a large-scale agent based simulation model [203, 204] of a virtual town of P = 5000 inhabitants, created in accordance with the Australian Census Bureau data. The agent based model is rather complex (takes a long time to run) and incorporates a typical age/gender breakdown, family-household-workplace habits, including the realistic day-to-day people contacts for a disease spread. The blue line in Figure 22 .32 shows the number of people of this town infected by a fictitious disease, reported once per day during a period of 154 days (only first 120 days shown). The dashed red line represents the adopted SIR model fit, using the entire batch of 154 data points and integration interval δ = 0.0052 days, with no process noise, i.e., w k = 0 in Eq. (22.50 ). The estimated model parameters are:α = 0.2399,β = 0.1066,ν = 1.2042. These estimates were obtained using the importance sampling technique of progressive correction [202] . Figure 22 .32 serves to verify that the adopted non-homogeneous mixing SIR model, although very simple and fast to run, is remarkably accurate in explaining the data obtained from a very complex simulation system. The true number of infected people in forecasting simulations is chosen to be the output of the agent based population model, shown by the solid blue line in Figure 22 .32. The measurements are generated synthetically in accordance with Eq. (22.49) and discussions above, using the following parameters: ς = 1.05, b j = 0.25, σ j = 0.01, for all j = 1, 2, 3, 4 monitored syndromes. Independent measurements concerning all Nz = 4 syndromes are assumed available on a daily basis during the first 25 days. The problem is to perform the estimation sequentially as the measurements become available until the day number 25, and at that point of time to forecast the number of infected people as a function of time. The initial pdf for the state vector was chosen as p( , and uniform distribution, respectively. The imprecise measurement parameter is adopted as ς ∈ [1.03, 1.07], while its true value The number of particles is set to 10,000. Figure 22 .33 shows the histograms of particle filter estimated values of α, β, and ν, after processing 25 days of syndromic data (i.e., in total 100 measurements). The histograms in this figure reveals that the uncertainty in parameters α and β has been substantially reduced after processing the data (compared with the initial p(α 0 ) and p(β 0 )). The uncertainty in ν, on the other hand, has not been reduced, indicating that this parameter cannot be estimated from syndromic data. While this is unfortunate, it does not appear to be a serious problem in forecasting the epidemic mainly because the prior on ν in practice is fairly tight ( ν ≈ 1). This is confirmed in Figure 22 .34 which shows a sample of 100 overlaid predicted epidemic curves (gray lines) based on the estimate of i, s, α, β, ν obtained after 25 days. Figure 22 .34 indicates that the forecast of the peak of the epidemic is fairly accurate, while the forecast of the size of the peak is more uncertain. Most importantly, however, the true epidemic curve (solid red line) appears to be always enveloped by the prediction curves. More experimental results can be found in [199] .
