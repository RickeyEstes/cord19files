The results page supports selection of sequences from the search set for analysis or download. Search parameters are displayed at the top of the results page, and a table displays retrieved sequences and associated metadata. The individual columns within the table can be selected to display specific sets of metadata and hyperlinked GenBank and BioSample accessions (29) . BioSample records store an extended set of sample descriptors and are linked to Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (30) records, allowing users to easily find sequence read data associated with retrieved GenBank sequences when available. One new feature is the ability to collapse identical retrieved sequences for all viruses as described in the preceding section. When identical sequences are collapsed on the query page, they will be represented by a single sequence on the results page with the number of collapsed sequences shown in the 'Identical sequences' column (see Figure 2 ). Clicking the arrows in the 'Identical sequences' column displays the individual sequences and makes them selectable. Users can now customize sequence titles including the FASTA defline of downloaded sequences and tree labels using the 'Customize label' tool. The defline can be modified to include various types of data such as the sequence accession number, calculated genomic The Ebolavirus module search interface with all elements opened and several example searches displayed in the query builder. The search page is divided into three elements. The first element supports selection of protein or nucleotide sequences based on standardized metadata terms generated by processing pipelines described in the text. Menus support filtering of sequences based on gene or protein names, host, isolation country and isolation source, and collection and release dates ranges can be set with text boxes. Additional filters are accessible with a drop-down arrow revealing options for environmental or laboratory isolates, vaccine strains, keyword or sequence string searches, and optional menus tailored to specific viruses. The second element supports searches based on GenBank accessions -either using the text box or by uploading a text file of accessions. The third element includes the query builder where the number of sequences retrieved from individual searches can be viewed by clicking one of the 'Add query' buttons. When multiple searches are added to the Query Builder, the total number of unique sequence records is also summed. A checkbox is provided that allows identical sequences to be collapsed and represented by the oldest sequence on the results table. Clicking the 'Show results' button opens a separate browser tab and displays all of the sequences meeting the criteria in each of the checked queries in the results interface. region, host, isolation source, collection date or country, as well as field-separators such as pipes or slashes. Userselected titles will also be displayed in multi-sequence alignments and trees as described in the following section.
