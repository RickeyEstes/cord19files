GM-CSF, at doses of 0.1 to 100 U/ml, induced IL-6 production in microglia in a time-and dose-dependent manner, as assessed by bioassay with the IL-6 dependent cell line MH60 and MTT colorimetric assay ( Fig. 1) . At doses ofl to 100U/ml and time of >8h, the effect of GM-CSF on IL-6 production was statistically significant (P < 0.001) relative to unstimulated cultures at the corresponding times. The maximal effect of GM-CSF on IL-6 production was apparent after 12 h or 24 h of stimulation with each dose examined. The induction of IL-6 by GM-CSF was inhibited by antibodies to GM-CSF in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2) ; the inhibitory effects of the anti-GM-CSF antibodies was statistically significant (P < 0.001) at a dilution of 1:105, and the antibodies completely abolished the effect of GM-CSF (100 U/ml) at a dilution of 1:103. In contrast to its effect on microglia, GM-CSF did not induce IL-6 production in astrocytes. One to 100 U/ml GM-CSF did not induce IL-6 production by astrocytes (Fig. 3) . Among the CSFs, only GM-CSF, but not IL-3 or M-CSF, induced the IL-6 production in microglia ( Fig. 4) . The induction of monokine production by GM-CSF in microglia was specific for IL-6; GM-CSF had no effect on the production of IL-1 or TNFa, whereas LPS, used as a positive control, induced all three monokines (Fig. 4) . The induction of IL-6 production in microglia by GM-CSF was inhibited by IL-4 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5) . GM-CSF induced the expression of IL-6 mRNA in microglia in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6) . The inhibition of GM-CSF-induced IL-6 production by IL-4 was also confirmed at the mRNA level (Fig. 6 ). IL-4 by itself did not induce IL-6 activity (Fig. 5) or IL-6 mRNA (Fig. 6 ).
