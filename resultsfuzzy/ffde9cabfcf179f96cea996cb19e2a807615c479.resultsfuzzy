2.1. Efficiency of the photocatalytic process for water disinfection 2.1.1. Comparative efficiencies of P-25 and PC500 TiO 2 photocatalysts for the inactivation of two E. coli strains This study was aimed at understanding if the modification of the bacteria surface by the increase of the number of fimbriae (E. coli PHL1273) could modify the photocatalytic degradability of E. coli. In E. coli PHL1273 strain, a gene coding for a green fluorescent protein has been incorporated in the genome in order to visualise the strain by fluorescence microscopy. This strain also carries the ompR234 mutation which increases the synthesis of curli, a particular type of fimbriae allowing the bacteria to better adhere to abiotic surfaces [18] . These curli or fimbriae should (i) improve the adsorption of bacteria on the photocatalyst and (ii) be directly in contact with the photocatalyst. In a first approach, TiO 2 Degussa P-25, used as a world reference, has been used to study the inactivation of both E. coli strains. Fig. 1 shows the changes in the survival of E. coli (PHL849 and PHL1273) bacteria concentration using TiO 2 Degussa P-25. From this result, we can see that the inactivation of both bacterial strains was similar. In our experimental conditions, it was 1,E+00 impossible to determine whether the adhesion of E. coli 1273 on TiO 2 was increased or not. With respect to the obtained results, the inactivation of both E. coli strains on TiO 2 P-25 seems to be similar. However, it is difficult to imagine that the presence of more fimbriae on bacteria does not modify the inactivation. The active species generated at the surface of titania during the irradiation should be more in contact with fimbriae than with the membrane. Thus, the fimbriae should be oxidized in competition with the membrane. This hypothesis is in agreement with the measurement of ammonium cations in solution. Ammonium ions, obtained from the degradation of aminoacids present in fimbriae, were detected only in the case of E. coli PHL1273. In conclusion, the similarity of the two curves suggests that the oxidation of fimbriae does not lead to the inactivation of bacteria during this irradiation time. The second experiment has been performed using TiO 2 Millennium PC500 having a higher surface area, a smaller particle size and an isoelectric point (IEP) lower than that of TiO 2 P-25 [8] . As seen in Fig. 2 , PHL1273 strain, having more fimbriae, was more quickly inactivated than PHL849 strain in the presence of PC500. To explain this result, it can be suggested that the adhesion of PHL1273 on PC500 could be stronger. But how to explain this higher adsorption while no difference is observed with titania P-25? It may be due to the more negative overall charge of PHL1273 compared to that of PHL849 strains. Moreover, if the adhesion of PHL1273 strain on PC500 was really more important than that of PHL849 on the same photocatalyst, it should be considered either that the degradation products (aldehydes, acids, ions.) originating from the degradation of fimbriae participate in the inactivation of the bacteria or that the smaller particles of PC500 penetrate more easily in the membrane of PHL1273. Future studies are programmed to better understand this phenomenon.
