A final discussion on the results presented in the previous sections, with particular reference to Sections 5 and 7, is shortly reported in this section. The approach followed in the present work aims to put in evidence the effects of incoming and/ or outgoing migrations, when they involve healthy individuals who do not put a great attention to the modalities of the spread of virus or infected persons not aware of being ill and contagious. Among the goals of such an analysis, there is the possibility of previewing and understanding the characteristics of the behaviors of some classes of individuals under particular external contributions. The main aspects that can be evidenced once the numerical results are compared and interpreted are as follows: (i) An immigration involving healthy individuals not well informed on the risks of unwise behaviors produces an increment in people in all the classes of the population, since the interactions producing virus transmission increase. However, at steady state, the ratio of the healthy population and the one of infected individuals with respect to the total one is constant. (ii) Emigration involving the same population as in Case (i) implies an evolution opposite to the previous one, with a decrement in people in all classes, leading, at steady state, again to constant ratios, but with the presence of oscillations in the transient. This peculiar behavior is interesting to be stressed since there are time intervals with increment in individuals, healthy and infected, despite the emigration phenomena. This fact does not characterizes the behavior of the dynamics when the vaccination, which acts on the same subjects, is applied. (iii) When the immigration involves infected people unaware of their status, the effect is the expected one: the number of healthy people decreases while all the infected ones increase. This produces an increment in the total population, but it is due to a higher number of infected individuals. (iv) The emigration among people of the same class as in Case (iii) at steady state shows the opposite behavior with respect to the previous case, as expected. However, the transient is characterized by an oscillatory behavior, as in the Case (ii); this fact implies that a correct interpretation of the population dynamics cannot be correctly performed over shorttime period.
