All patients had detectable levels of IL-18 mRNA in the uninvolved skin. F l e x u r a l P a l m o p l a n t a r P l a q u e a n d g u t t a t e P l a q u e a n d p a l m o p l a n t e r P l a q u e a n d f l e x u r a l P l a q u e a n d n a i l s mean Â± SD and median levels of cytokine gene expression in each skin biopsy at the different times before and after receiving medication, whether topical or systemic. Comparisons between median IL-18 expression levels with percentiles in all studied patients are demonstrated in Figure 1 . Significantly lower IL-18 expression in uninvolved skin than lesional skin before treatment (p = 0.001) and lesional skin after treatment (p = 0.002) was demonstrated in all studied patients as one group. The IL-18 expression in the psoriatic skin lesions after treatment was significantly lower than lesional skin before treatment (p = 0.023). Interleukin-18 mean expression levels in nonlesional and lesional skin (before and after treatment) in the different subtypes of psoriasis are shown in Figure 2 . The highest expression level was noted in plaque and nails clinical subtype of psoriasis. Among patients receiving topical steroids, significantly lower IL-18 expression was detected in non-lesional skin than lesional skin before treatment (p = 0.012) and after treatment (p = 0.012). No statistical significance could be obtained when comparing the change of expression before and after topical treatment (p = 0.069). Individual variations of the IL-18 expression levels in non-lesional and lesional skin before and after re ceiv ing topical steroids are demonstrated in Figure 3 . Interleukin-18 expression and the response to treatment in patients with psoriasis In patients receiving methotrexate, significantly lower IL-18 expression was detected in non-lesional skin than lesional skin before treatment (p = 0.018). The change of expression levels in lesional skin after treatment was not statistically significant when compared to non-lesional skin (p = 0.069) and lesional skin before treatment (p = 0.12). Individual variations of the IL-18 expression levels in non-lesional and lesional skin before and after receiving systemic methotrexate are demonstrated in Figure 4 . In the correlation between IL-18 expression and different demographic and behavioural characteristics of the studied patients as one group. A significant correlation was obtained between IL-18 expression levels in psoriatic lesions and the severity of psoriasis expressed by PASI score (r = 0.72 and p = 0.001) and disease duration (r = 0.40 and p = 0.01). No significant correlation could be revealed between IL-18 expression levels in psoriatic lesions and patients' age, smoking state, predisposing factors or coexisting diseases.
