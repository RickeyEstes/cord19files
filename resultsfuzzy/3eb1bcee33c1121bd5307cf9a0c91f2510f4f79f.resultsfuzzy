The enriched GO process terms can be used to point out the human processes that are attacked by DNA/ RNA viruses. All enriched GO process, function and Table 7) are also important to highlight common infection mechanisms shared by the two types of viruses. Enriched pathway terms for five specific human protein sets are listed in Tables 8-10 , presenting the certain characteristics of DNA and RNA viruses attack strategies. Similar to GO enrichment analysis results, these human protein sets are only DNA virusestargeted and only RNA viruses-targeted (Table 8) , 4-DNA viruses-targeted and 4-RNA viruses-targeted (Table 9) , and DNA-RNA viruses-targeted (Table 10) . Pathway enrichment analysis results are provided in Data S5 for all of eight virus-targeted human protein sets under investigation.
