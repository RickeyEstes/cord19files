From 30 March 2010 to 30 March 2012, SVA received 268 referrals that requested analysis of diarrhoeal calf samples for the presence of Cryptosporidium. The referrals included 801 samples, of which 782 were sent for analysis of Cryptosporidium (and sometimes other pathogens), whereas 29 faecal samples were sent for analysis of other pathogens but not Cryptosporidium. The referrals also included 125 blood samples for control of TP. Referrals were from 192 herds and 51 herds sent samples on two (n = 33), three (n = 15), five (n = 2) or six (n = 1) occasions. Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected by routine diagnostic methods in 242 (31.0%) samples from 91 (48.7%) herds. The sample prevalence was 32.7% (141 of 431) in year 1 and 28.8% (101 of 351) in year 2 (v 2 = 1.4, degrees of freedom (df) = 1, P > 0.05). For herds with multiple referrals, Cryptosporidium oocysts were identified zero to three times. Of 242 Cryptosporidium-positive samples, 218 samples from 82 herds contained enough faeces to allow further analysis, and 198 samples were positive by microscopy after concentration. Estimated oocysts per gram (OPG) in these samples ranged from 100 to 11 Â 10 7 . Samples determined as Cryptosporidium-negative after concentration were considered as false positives. Species was successfully determined by ssrRNA analysis in 187 of 198 samples (94.4%). Four of the 11 samples with undetermined species contained C. parvum subtypes in GP60 analyses, giving a total of 191 samples (96.5%) with successful species determination. Cryptosporidium parvum and C. bovis were identified in 178 (93.2%) and 13 (6.8%) samples, respectively. Cryptosporidium ryanae was not found. Of the 13 C. bovis samples, seven were determined as mixed C. bovis/C. parvum by ssrRNA-RFLP. Sixty-eight herds were positive for C. parvum only, five for C. bovis only and both species were detected in six herds. In three herds with one referral and one Cryptosporidium-positive sample each, neither species nor subtype could be determined. By GP60 analyses, subtypes were successfully determined in 171 of 198 (86.4%) samples. Of these, 166 were C. parvum and five were mixed C. bovis/C. parvum (Table 1 ). The subtype family (SF) but not subtype could be identified in another five samples, because the sequence started within the repetitive region. A total of 27 C. parvum subtypes were identified (Table 1) . Sixteen new subtypes were identified and submitted to GenBank (Accession Numbers JX183796-JX183811) ( Table 1) . Six subtypes had a unique number of TCA/ TCG repeats, whereas 10 had the same number of repeats as previously reported subtypes but shifts in the TCG position within the repetitive region and/or one or two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the post-repetitive region compared with reported sequences. IIa subtypes were most common, with a dominance of subtype IIaA16G1R1 (Table 1) . For IId subtypes there was a slight dominance of IIdA20G1e (Table 1) , a subtype variant first reported by us (Silverlås et al., 2010b) . Three other subtypes, IIaA21G1R1, IIdA22G1c and IIdA23G1, which were first reported in Sweden (Silverlås et al., 2010b) were also identified, as well as a variant of one of those (IIaA21G1b). With the exception of three herds, only one subtype per herd was identified when multiple samples (n = 2-9) were analysed; also in herds with repeated samplings. In one of those three herds, only C. parvum was detected and samples with different subtypes were sent on the same occasion. In the other two herds, subtypes were identified in both C. parvum and mixed C. bovis/C. parvum samples. In one herd, samples were taken 8 months apart and subtypes differed in the C. parvum and mixed C. bovis/C. parvum samples. In the other herd, all samples were sent on the same occasion and two different subtypes were identified in the C. bovis/C. parvum sample, one of those being identical to the C. parvum subtype of that herd. One was a dairy herd, one a fattening herd and for the third herd there was no information about herd type.
