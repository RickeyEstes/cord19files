This report describes an assay designed to detect a DNA sequence of a genetic element in the soybean genome coding for CP4 EPSPS that confers tolerance to the herbicide Roundup5. The assay described here is designed in a duplex format to allow simultaneous amplification and detection of the RR2Y insertion and the endogenous soybean gene, lectin (lec), as an internal control. Amplification of an endogenous gene such as lec confirms (1) the general activity of the RPA amplification/detection "machinery" of the reaction; (2) the effectiveness of the sample preparation procedure; and (3) the input of the correct sample type (soybean in this case). The DNA junction between the soybean genome and the inserted CP4 EPSPS cassette is well characterized, allowing RPA oligonucleotide primers and probes to be designed to detect the "junction sequences" unique to RR2Y. Figure 1 (b) depicts the differences in the sequences of the conventional soybean and RR2Y soybean genomes at the site of insertion. The junction sequences are unique to the soybean RR2Y event and therefore deliver a high degree of molecular specificity. A number of primers and probes were designed across the junction sequence and screened for the amplification of RR2Y target by measuring the fluorescence output of the appropriate detection probes. Similarly, a number of primers and probes were designed and screened against the lec gene sequence. After ranking the primer/probe combinations according to performance, one probe and one primer pair each were chosen for the amplification and detection of the RR2Y and lec targets by RPA. Sequences of the primers and probes used for the RR2Y duplex RPA assay are included in Table 1 (see Figure 1 (c) for the localization of RR2Y primers and probe at the locus).  RPA reactions for RR2Y and lec targets were carried out and amplification of the targets was monitored fluorimetrically in real time using Twista portable fluorometer (TwistDx Limited, Cambridge, UK). Purified genomic DNA isolated from conventional, RR1, or RR2Y soybean seeds were used as templates to determine the specificity of the assay, as observed by detectable signal in 5-15 minutes (Figure 2(a) ). The results demonstrate lack of amplification of the RR2Y target when conventional soybean DNA lacking the specific insertion was used as the amplification template. The transgenic inserts in RR1 and RR2Y have different junction sequences with the flanking soybean genome; therefore, amplification was not observed when RR1 DNA was used instead of RR2Y DNA as template. Exponential amplification was readily observed when RR2Y DNA was used as the template by itself (100% (w/w) RR2Y) or mixed with either the RR1 (0.1% (w/w) RR2Y in RR1) or the conventional DNA (0.1% (w/w) RR2Y in conventional). An earlier onset of amplification was observed when 100% (w/w) RR2Y DNA template was used instead of 0.1% (w/w) RR2Y, demonstrating that the onset of target detection is dependent upon the amount of target DNA. Amplification of endogenous lec target is observed when conventional soybean or RR1 or RR2Y soybean genomic DNA was used as the template indicating the presence of active reaction mix and sufficient template for amplification. PCR reactions were performed with the same purified genomic DNA as above to confirm the identity of the samples. The PCR products were separated in an ethidium bromide stained agarose gel and visualized under a UV transilluminator (Figure 2(b) and Table 2 ). The PCR amplification products obtained using the RR2Y specific primers were consistent with the results of the RPA reactions. PCR was also performed using RR1-specific primers and specific amplification was observed using the RR1 soybean DNA as template. All samples, except for the reactions lacking any genomic DNA (no template control, NTC), displayed positive PCR amplification products with lec primers at the expected size range. These results combined with the RPA assay data confirm that the designed RPA assay is specific for DNA isolated from RR2Y soybean. The specified level of discrimination of the RR2Y assay is to detect 0.5% (w/w) of RR2Y material in a mixture with 99.5% of non-RR2Y (conventional or RR1) soybean seed material. Due to the nature of the sample preparation procedure, in practice about 10-30 ng of total soybean DNA was analyzed per RPA reaction which corresponds to about 4000-12000 copies of genomic DNA. In a typical reaction at the specified discrimination level of 0.5% (w/w), 20-60 copies of the RR2Y target may be present to act as template for RPA. The copy numbers were calculated based on the genome size of soybean. In order to meet this requirement, first, the sensitivity of the RR2Y analyte detection must be high enough to be able to detect as low as 20 copies per reaction and, second, the assay must perform without significant loss of sensitivity, even in the presence of a comparatively large amount of total soybean DNA. The sensitivity of the duplex RPA formulation was assessed by challenging it with different amounts of target DNA purified from RR2Y soybean seed samples as template (between 100 and 10 copies per reaction; see Figure 3 (a)). A positive amplification signal was generated in all cases for the RR2Y containing samples, demonstrating that the sensitivity of the RR2Y is very high (e.g., positive detection was achieved in all 7 samples which contained 10 copies of RR2Y target). The time of onset of detection was approximately 5-7 minutes after the initiation of the reaction. Positive signals were also generated in all cases for the lec control reaction (Figure 3(a) , right panel).
