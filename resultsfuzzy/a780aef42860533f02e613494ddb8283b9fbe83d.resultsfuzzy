Without considering other factors, this paper focused on the influence of three factors, namely, population density, individual heterogeneity, and mobility on infectious disease spread, and the SLIRDS model based on cellular automata was constructed. In order to verify the validity of the model, this paper took pandemic influenza A (H1N1) as an example to simulate the spread process of pandemic influenza A (H1N1). In this paper, we used MATLAB simulation software (R2013b, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) to carry out 200 simulation experiments; the simulated curves are realizations of the average from all simulations. According to the latent and infectious characteristics of pandemic influenza A (H1N1), the time step of simulation is in days, and the total time is set to T = 40. The simulated initial number of members of the infected population was consistent with the actual number of members of the infected population, and we assumed that the proportion of the initial latent population was 0.15%. First, the number of members of the infected population in the SLIRDS model simulation experiments was compared with the actual data of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in Beijing in Mainland China (June-July 2009) [24] . The comparison results are shown in Figure 3 . (2) When ( , ) ( ) = 2 , when ( ( , ) ( )) < , ( , ) ( + 1) = 2. Otherwise, ( , ) ( + 1) = 3. Meanwhile, individual illness time ( ( , ) ( )) = ( ( , ) ( )) + 1. (3) When ( , ) ( ) = 3, when ( ( , ) ( )) < , ( , ) ( + 1) = 3. Otherwise, the individual enters into dead state with probability , and ( , ) ( + 1) = 0; the rest of individuals have recovered and acquired immunity, and ( , ) ( + 1) = 4. Meanwhile, individual immunization time ( ( , ) ( )) = ( ( , ) ( )) + 1. (4) When ( , ) ( ) = 4, when ( ( , ) ( )) â‰¥ , individual immunity to the infectious disease disappears with probability . The individual then turns into susceptible state, ( , ) ( ) = 1. (5) At each time step, all individuals move.

The comparison results are shown in Figure 3 . In Figure 3 , the abscissa is the time step of simulation and the ordinate is the number of infected individuals. The correlation coefficient of the two sets of data is 0.97215 by t-test. It shows that the simulation results are close to the actual data and that the model is reasonable and effective.
