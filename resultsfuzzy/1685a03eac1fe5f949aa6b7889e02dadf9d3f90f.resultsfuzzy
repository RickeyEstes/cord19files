continuous arms race with their hosts, the outcome of which might ultimately result in either viral persistence, clearance of the viral infection, or death of the infected cells. The arsenal of antiviral defenses and viral counter defense mechanisms is vast and very diverse among the different phyla of life. Plants, insects, nematodes, and fungi mostly (if not exclusively) rely upon an innate immune response, whereas mammals have evolved an adaptive response in addition to this first line of defense. In the former organisms, the antiviral component of the innate immune response is mainly based on a highly conserved process commonly referred to as RNA silencing, or RNA interference (RNAi). In this phenomenon, long double-stranded RNAs of viral origin are cleaved by the RNase Dicer into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are then assembled into effector complexes that contain a member of the Argonaute (Ago) family; this results in targeted degradation of viral messenger or genomic RNAs (1) . In mammals, another type of innate immunity has evolved to control viruses (2) . The initial recognition of nonself viral nucleic acids by extra-and intracellular sensors triggers the activation of type I interferons (IFNs) (3) . This leads in turn to the upregulation of numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (4) , which either directly trigger a signaling cascade directed against the viral infection or mobilize other cells of the immune system. ISGs encode proteins involved in apoptosis induction, protein synthesis blocking, or in the regulation of mRNA editing or RNA degradation (5) . One key factor involved in IFN type I-mediated host defense is RNase L, a latent cytoplasmic endoribonuclease that is activated by 2=,5=-oligoadenylates in response to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing and that cleaves both viral and cellular RNAs (6) . Although extensive deep sequencing analyses have been performed to identify siRNAs in mammalian cells infected with several RNA viruses, there is so far no good evidence for a possible antiviral role of RNAi in mammalian somatic cells (7) . Nevertheless, another class of small noncoding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), has been shown to play an important role during viral infection in mammals. miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved small RNAs derived from large primary transcripts, which are sequentially processed by the respective nuclear and cytoplasmic RNase III enzymes, Drosha and Dicer, to generate mature single-stranded~21-or 22-nucleotide (nt) RNAs (8, 9) . Similar to siRNAs, they are incorporated into an effector Ago-containing RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), whereby they mediate posttranscriptional regulation of target mRNAs via partially complementary sites (10) . On one hand, miRNAs of cellular origin can directly or indirectly regulate viral infections (11, 12) . On the other hand, some viruses have evolved the capacity to encode their own miRNAs, which represent an ideal tool to stealthily modulate the cellular environment. To date, viral miRNAs have been almost exclusively identified in the genomes of DNA viruses, mostly herpesviruses (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) , with the notable exception of bovine leukemia virus, a retrovirus with an RNA genome (18) . It has been commonly assumed that cytoplasmic RNA viruses cannot encode miRNAs, not only because they do not have access to the nuclear biogenesis machinery but also because their genomic integrity would be destabilized by miRNA processing (19) . Nevertheless, it has recently been demonstrated that the insertion of a cellular miRNA precursor into the 3=-end nontranslated region (NTR) of Sindbis virus (SINV) genomic RNA leads to its cytoplasmic processing without affecting the viral replication (20, 21) . The arthropod-borne SINV is a small, enveloped, positive, single-stranded RNA virus and is the prototype for the alphavirus genus. Alphaviruses represent a group of widely distributed human and animal pathogens, which pose a serious public health threat (22) . Some of them induce febrile and arthritogenic diseases, while others can cause highly debilitating diseases, such as encephalitis. The SINV genomic RNA is capped and polyadenylated and is infectious as naked RNA. Upon entry into the cytoplasm by endocytosis, the host translational machinery recognizes the genomic RNA, and four nonstructural proteins are produced (23) . Their expression is sufficient for the establishment of replication complexes and the synthesis of a complementary antigenomic negative RNA strand. The antigenome is necessary for the replication of the viral genome and the production of a subgenomic RNA that ensures the translation of the structural proteins during the late phase of infection (24, 25) . To date, SINV has not been shown to give rise to any small RNA species in mammalian cells. As such, we decided to investigate the small RNA profile of SINV-infected human and African green monkey cell lines. Using small RNA cloning and deep sequencing techniques, we provide evidence that the SINV genome is a source of small RNAs in infected mammalian cells. Some of these small RNAs accumulate to levels detected by Northern blot analysis. We set out to identify the factors involved in their biogenesis and show that they do not depend on the RNA silencing machinery, but rather, that they are downstream products of the cytoplasmic IFN-induced endoribonuclease RNase L. Finally, we also present experimental evidence that these viral small RNAs are modified at their 3= extremity. Altogether, our results indicate that the SINV-derived small RNAs could represent key markers of the host defense mechanism. 


Section:importance in a continuous arms race, viruses have to deal with host antiviral responses in order to successfully establish an infection. in mammalian cells, the host defense mechanism relies on the recognition of viral rnas, resulting in the activation of type i interferons (ifns). in turn, the expression of many interferon-stimulated genes (isgs) is induced to inhibit viral replication. here we report that the cytoplasmic, interferon-induced, cellular endoribonuclease rnase l is involved in the accumulation of a novel small rna population of viral origin. these small rnas are produced upon sinv infection of mammalian cells and are stabilized by a 3=-end modification. altogether, our findings indicate that in our system rna silencing is not active against sindbis virus (sinv) and might open the way to a better understanding of the antiviral response mediated by a novel class of small rnas.
