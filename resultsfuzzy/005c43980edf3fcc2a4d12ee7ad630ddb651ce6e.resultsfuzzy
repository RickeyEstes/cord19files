To achieve a simultaneous diagnostic performance, dual quantum dots-mediated separate fluorescence signals for each test line (TL) and control line (CL) with two different emission filters must be measured. SRDFDS can normalize the positive sample compared to the negative sample using each value of TL/CL [TL1/CL for H5-HA detection with 580 nm emission filter (F580 nm) and TL2/CL for influenza A with 650 nm emission filter (F650 nm)] and the fold of control. Finally, all results obtained by SRDFDS can be analyzed with dual fluorescence signals leading to accurate diagnostic result using only TL1/CL or TL2/CL. Fig. 3A shows the strategy of signal analyses measured by SRDFDS. The TL2/CL value at 580 nm and TL1/CL value at 650 nm of the positive sample (ii in Figure 3A ) were divided by the corresponding values of the uninfected sample (i in Figure 3A ) to normalize and obtain the final TL/CL value (fold of control). The TL/CL values of the counterpart test lines (iii and iv) were also obtained to check cross-reactions and further increase accuracy. As shown in Table 1 , inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) were less than 11 % for all TC/CL values. Following SRDFDS measurements, all diagnostic strips were observed under UV excitation with or without two emission filters to further confirm the accuracy of the assay (Fig. 3B) .
