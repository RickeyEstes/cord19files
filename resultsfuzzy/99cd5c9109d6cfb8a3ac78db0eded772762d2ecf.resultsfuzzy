Cow-calf pairs grazed corn residue at ENREC for approximately 151 d (November 11 to April 10). At PREC, the grazing period was approximately 139 d (November 22 to April 9). Dry-lot cow-calf pairs consumed 12.3 kg of DM/d (ENREC) or 11.9 kg of DM/d (PREC) on average throughout the trial. Cow performance is presented in Table 3 . Initial cow BW and BCS were similar between treatments at both locations (P ≥ 0.50). Cows that were managed in the drylot at ENREC had greater ending BW and BCS compared with cows grazing cornstalks (P < 0.01). Cows wintered on cornstalks at ENREC lost BW (33 kg) and had a 0.46-unit decrease in BCS, whereas cows in the dry-lot gained BW (40 kg) and had a 0.24-unit increase in BCS. At PREC, a significant difference was observed between treatments for cow BCS change (P = 0.04). Body condition score increased by 0.03 units for cows wintered in the dry-lot and decreased by 0.26 units for cows wintered on cornstalks. No significant differences (P ≥ 0.41) were observed between treatments for any other cow performance variables at PREC. Overall, the pregnancy rate was 90% of cows exposed, but the number of cows is too small to make a treatment comparison. Reproduction data required that cows had a treatment applied before the breeding season; therefore, treatment effect on pregnancy rate could only be measured for yr 2 and 3 at ENREC and yr 2 at PREC. There were 61 (CS = 33; DL = 28) and 19 (CS = 10; DL = 9) cows total from ENREC and PREC, respectively, that met these criteria. At ENREC, pregnancy rates were 98 and 83% for CS and DL cows, respectively. Pregnancy rates at PREC were 88 and 89% for CS and DL cows, respectively. The performance of the cows grazing cornstalks is in agreement with Griffin et al. (2012) , who reported that lactating, June-calving cows winter grazed on corn residue and fed a dried distillers grain-based supplement (0.45 kg per cow daily; 28% CP; prorated for delivery 3 d per week) lost BW and BCS. In the present experiment, the loss in BCS for cows wintered on cornstalks implies that the amount of energy provided was less than anticipated. An overestimation of the quality, residue intake, or both may explain the reduced performance of cows grazing cornstalks. More supplement might be needed to maintain BCS while grazing cornstalk residue. However, after weaning (April) the opportunity likely exists for a now dry cow with a low energy requirement to increase BCS on a low quality diet (4.5 kg of TDN/d) in the 4 mo before calving. The increase in BCS and BW observed in cows managed in the dry-lot over the winter indicates that DL cows were overfed and not at maintenance. This increase in BW and BCS while program feeding was also noted by Loerch (1996) and Gunter et al. (2000) . It is possible that cows become metabolically adapted during restricted intake and, therefore, have reduced energy requirements (Boardman et al., 2016) . Furthermore, limit feeding confined cows may influence diet digestibility. Trubenbach et al. (2014) observed a 4.5-percentage unit increase in apparent OM digestibility when cows were restricted to 80% of energy maintenance requirements. Warner et al. (2011) reported that nonpregnant, nonlactating cows limit fed (1.3% of BW) a diet consisting of 41% wet distillers grains with solubles and 59% corn residue tended to have greater ADG compared with cows with ad libitum intake Ending date = April 10 at ENREC and April 9 at PREC. 7 BCS on a 1 (emaciated) to 9 (obese) scale (Wagner et al., 1988) . of a mixture of bromegrass hay, corn residue, and alfalfa haylage. Jenkins et al. (2015) also reported an increase in BCS in gestating cows limit fed (1.4-1.7% BW) diets containing wheat straw and up to 65% wet distillers grains with solubles and sugar beet pulp (DM basis). These data suggest that the energy provided to cows in limit-fed systems may be underestimated or the energy required by confined cows is overestimated. This is difficult to adjust because the NRC model (NASEM, 2016) does not predict this outcome for the cow limit fed a nutrient-dense diet. However, Shike et al. (2009) reported maintaining BCS when limit feeding (1.7% BW) confined, lactating cows diets containing up to 75% dried distillers grains or wet corn gluten feed. Furthermore, we do not know the separate intakes of the cows and calves in either the dry-lot pairs or the stalk-grazing pairs, and the NRC models do not have requirements for pairs. Therefore, we cannot realistically estimate the efficiency of use of energy by either the cows or the calves. Performance of calves is presented in Table 4 . Calves at PREC were approximately 10 d older than calves at ENREC at the onset of the cornstalk grazing period. Similar cow-calf production effects were observed at both locations. Initial calf BW was not significantly different between treatments (P ≥ 0.08). Calves wintered in the dry-lot had greater ending BW and BW change compared with calves grazing cornstalks (P ≤ 0.04). Likewise, calves wintered in the dry-lot had greater ADG and BW per day of age compared with calves grazed on cornstalks (P ≤ 0.03). The observations of this experiment are in agreement with those of Griffin et al. (2012) , who also reported similar weaning weights and ADG for June calves grazed on cornstalks and weaned in April. Numerically, the cows grazing cornstalks at PREC gained 9 kg, whereas the cows at ENREC lost 33 kg. Calves at PREC gained 0.7 kg/d, whereas those at EN-REC gained 0.6 kg/d. In vitro analysis of the corn residue from each location was conducted to determine whether residue quality was related to the apparent differences in performance of the pairs grazing cornstalks. In vitro OM digestibility and DOM of corn residue from ENREC and PREC are presented in Table 5 . Assuming cattle consume residue (husk, leaf, and sheath) in the same proportion as it is produced on the plant (18% husk, 55% leaf, and 27% sheath; Gardine et al., 2017) , DOM of consumed residue in the current experiment was 42.6 and 55.7% at EN-REC and PREC, respectively. The 13.1% unit difference in DOM of corn residue observed between locations may explain variation in cow-calf performance. A partial budget of incorporating winter cornstalk grazing into a semi-confined cow-calf production system indicated that grazing cow-calf pairs on corn residue was a more profitable system compared with year-round confinement. Sulc and Tracy (2007) also suggested integrating crops and livestock, particularly through residue grazing, improves economic sustainability for crop and livestock operations. A partial budget using data from ENREC (Table 6 ) suggested that winter grazing cow-calf pairs on corn residue resulted in a greater net profit of $112 per pair compared with feeding cow-calf pairs in the dry-lot over the winter. At ENREC, grazing cornstalks saved the system $216 per pair (additional cost − reduced cost). Because the calves wintered on cornstalks at ENREC were 49 kg lighter at weaning compared with calves wintered in the dry-lot, income was decreased by $104 per calf. The dry-lot cows gained weight and were likely overfed, which would increase the cost slightly. Cows that grazed stalks lost weight and were fed extra feed during the subsequent dry-lot phase before calving at a cost of $20 (Table 6) . Cows were at similar BW before calving. A partial budget for PREC (Table 7) indicated that grazing pairs on cornstalks over the winter resulted in $92 greater net profit per pair compared with cow-calf pairs fed in the dry-lot. By grazing cow-calf pairs on cornstalks at PREC, $175 (additional cost − reduced cost) was saved compared with feeding in the dry-lot. The 37-kg-lighter weaning weight of calves wintered on cornstalks compared with calves fed in the dry-lot resulted in $83 less income per calf. Overall, the decrease in production cost more than offset reduced performance of calves wintered on cornstalks at both locations.
