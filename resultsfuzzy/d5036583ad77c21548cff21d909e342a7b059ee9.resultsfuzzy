Evaluation of HE stained slides by light microscopy revealed a mild to moderate, multifocal, lymphoplasmahistiocytic and suppurative rhinitis characterized by low numbers of intraepithelial neutrophils and lymphocytes and infiltration of the lamina propria and submucosa by low to moderate numbers of lymphocytes, single plasma cells, and macrophages (Fig. 1A, B) . These findings are reminiscent of previous observations in other large animal species though lesions in alpacas are relatively mild and lack the necrotizing component that has been described for dromedaries, llamas, and pigs (Adney et al., 2014; Haagmans et al., 2016; Vergara-Alert et al., 2017) . The commercially available monoclonal and polyclonal anti-MERS-CoV nucleocapsid antibodies, which were used as positive controls, revealed a strong intracytoplasmic and cilia-associated staining pattern in numerous cells (Fig. 1C, D) according to formerly published results Haverkamp et al., 2018) . A specific staining was absent in all negative controls as expected. For evaluation of human mAbs by immunohistochemistry, two of the tested antibodies (1.2g5 and 1.10f3) were applied in three different dilutions and three different pretreatments in a preliminary experiment to identify the best method for the use of human mAbs on FFPE tissue ( Table 1) . As a result, heat-induced antigen retrieval and application of the antibody in the lowest dilution revealed the best staining effects. According to these results, all other antibodies (1.6c7, 1.6f9, 4.6e10, 7.7g6, 3.5g6, 1.8e5) were tested with heat-induced antigen retrieval and in the lowest dilution. The use of the 1.2g5 antibody in a 1:5 dilution with heat-induced antigen retrieval showed the strongest signal of all tested non-commercially available antibodies. Detected antigen was present multifocally in the cytoplasm of ciliated respiratory epithelium and segmentally along the apical membranous region of few infected cells ( Fig. 2A) . The observed staining pattern was comparable to descriptions by others investigating the distribution of MERS-CoV in tissue sections of different infected animal species (Adney et al., 2014; Haagmans et al., 2016; Haverkamp et al., 2018; Vergara-Alert et al., 2017) but the number of labeled cells was considerably lower. Staining with the same antibody without pretreatment revealed a similar distribution of viral antigen in a comparable number of cells but a less prominent expression pattern (Fig. 2B) , which is most likely linked to the lack of antigen unmasking which takes place during antigen retrieval (Shi et al., 2011) . Detection of MERS-CoV antigen by the 1.2g5 antibody was almost completely absent with pretreatment by enzymatic digestion in all three dilutions, resulting only in a pale brownish signal interpreted as nonspecific background staining (data not shown). The antibody 1.10f3 showed a strong non-specific background staining in all dilutions and pretreatments. A moderately intense antigen-specific signal was detected multifocally in cilia of few cells using the lowest dilution and citrate pretreatment (Fig. 2C ). Of the six remaining antibodies (1.6c7, 1.6f9, 4.6e10, 7.7g6, 3.5g6, 1.8e5), only antibody 1.6c7 showed a mild multifocal staining of cilia accompanied by a strong background reactivity (Fig. 2D) . The other five antibodies (1.6f9, 4.6e10, 7.7g6, 1.8e5, 3.5g6) did not reveal any recognizable specific staining of MERS-CoV antigen on FFPE tissue along with no to very mild (1.6f9, 4.6e10, Fig. 3A, B) , mild (7.7g6, 1.8e5, Fig. 3C , D) and strong (3.5g6, Fig. 3E ) non-specific background staining. By contrast, all antibodies displayed a distinct signal by immunofluorescence staining of MERS-CoV-infected Huh-7 cells in culture (Widjaja et al., 2019) . Possible explanations for the lack of immunoreactivity on FFPE tissue include effacement of conformational epitopes by formalin fixation and/or antigen retrieval protocols (Smedley et al., 2007) . The tested antibodies in the present study were derived from transgenic mice expressing chimeric antibodies containing human variable domains and constant antibody domains of rat origin. For generation of fully human antibodies the human variable heavy and light chain encoding gene segments of the antibodies isolated from MERS-S immunized mice transgenic for human V genes were cloned into human IgG1 heavy and light chain expression vectors, respectively (Widjaja et al., 2019) . All these antibodies are directed against MERS-S and belong to six distinct epitope groups that interfere with three critical entry functions in vivo. In particular, 1.2g5, 7.7g6, 1.6f9, 1.8e5, and 4.6e10 are neutralizing antibodies directed against the receptor binding domain (RBD) S1B of the MERS-S protein (Widjaja et al., 2019) , which facilitates virus binding to the DPP4 receptor on the host cell surface Raj et al., 2013) . The neutralizing antibodies 1.6c7 and 3.5g6 bind to the ectodomain of the membrane fusion subunit S2 which mediates fusion of the viral and cellular membranes Widjaja et al., 2019) . By contrast, antibody 1.10f3 is a nonneutralizing antibody that recognizes the sialic acid binding domain (Widjaja et al., 2019) . Since the positive staining antibodies 1.2g5, 1.10f3 and 1.6c7 recognize epitopes that belong to different functional groups (DPP4 binding, sialic acid binding and membrane fusion, respectively), the suitability of mAbs for use in immunohistochemistry cannot be predicted from the function of their target epitopes in vivo.
