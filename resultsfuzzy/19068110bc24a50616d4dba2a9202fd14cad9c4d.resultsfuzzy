Structural transitions accompanying autoproteolysis A 6-h room temperature incubation of ThnT purified from heterologous expression afforded autoproteolytically activated enzyme suitable for X-ray crystallography. Wild-type ThnT crystallized under similar conditions and in the same space group as the mutationally inactive precursor ThnT T282C. Diffraction to high resolution and phasing by molecular replacement yielded the 1.8-Å crystal structure of wild-type ThnT. For clarity, all residues of ThnT referenced hereafter will be numbered according to their position in the precursor protein. Autoproteolysis generates two subunits, α and β, composed of residues 1-281 and 282-399, respectively. Like most structurally characterized Ntn enzymes, the subunits of ThnT remain intimately intertwined after activation with global features comparable to their uncleaved forms (Fig. 2a) . 11, 19 The N-6His tag and the first 23 residues of the α-subunit were not observed, as was the case for the T282C structure. A short linker sequence leading into the scissile bond of the proenzyme, residues 274-281, showed few tertiary interactions and modeled with very high average B-factors (41.4 Å 2 ). 13 These disordered residues comprise the C-terminus of the α-subunit, and as we anticipated, they are not observed in the structure of mature ThnT. Interestingly, comparable disorder in precursor proteins and nascent C-termini has been found in many autoproteolytic systems. 14, 20 This observation is readily explained as a strategy employed to promote dissociation of the C-terminus, which must occur to expose the active site of the mature enzyme. The N-terminal residue of the β-subunit is the characteristic N-terminal threonine residue central to autoprocessing and substrate catalysis (Fig. 2b) . Surprisingly, the peptide ω angle of Thr282 consistently refined to a strained 167°. Comparable strain was observed at this position in the proenzyme inactive state, and we hypothesized that this destabilization was used to help drive formation of the reactive conformation. 13 Hence, it appears that retention of this unfavorable geometry is a consequence of the selection for an active site that can promote two different chemical reactions. The energetic penalty of straining this bond may be offset by the hydrogen bond between the carbonyl of Thr282 and the amide nitrogen of Asn217, which would be disrupted upon relaxation of the ω angle. The amide proton of Phe144 and δNH 2 of Asn217 comprise the oxyanion hole of ThnT for autoactivation. 13 In the major conformer of the precursor structure, a single water molecule occupied the oxyanion hole, taking the place of the reactive carbonyl. A similar placeholder is not observed for mature ThnT; instead, a glycerol molecule and additional water molecules are bound in the active site (Fig. 2b) . In addition to dissociation of the nascent Cterminus, three structural rearrangements in the vicinity of the active site were identified (Fig. 3a) . Notably, the solvent-filled groove that may represent the substrate binding site is not present prior to autoactivation and is only revealed upon a conformational change in residues Arg74-Thr80, which includes cis-trans isomerization of the Gly77-Pro78 peptide bond (Fig. 3b ). This dramatic structural rearrangement is promoted electrostatically by reorienting the carbonyl of Arg74 away from Asp321 and positioning it 1.4 Å closer to the side chain of Lys300. The new conformation allows the amide nitrogens of Gly76 and Gly77 to hydrogen bond with the backbone of Leu318 and Asp321, respectively. Additionally, there is a net release of four water molecules, which is entropically favorable. 21 These transitions stabilize the loop relative to the uncleaved form, which is corroborated by a decrease in the average B-factor of the loop from 18.5 Å 2 prior to cleavage to 11.6 Å 2 in the mature enzyme. Together, these data demonstrate that specific structural features of ThnT promote the isomerization of the Arg74-Thr80 loop. Two other motifs undergo a structural transition upon autoproteolysis. Residues Leu318-Gly322 were observed in two conformations of one subunit in the T282C structure but collapse to a single observable state in both subunits of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3c) . The role of this apparent conformational flexibility is unclear. However, proximity to the active site and hydrogen bonding interactions with the Arg74-Thr80 loop (described above) suggest its relevance. Residues Asp338-Phe348 were not observed in the structure of the precursor protein but were modeled in the structure of mature ThnT. A subset of these, Pro337-Asp341, refined with a high average B-factor of 43.9 Å 2 , suggesting that they retain considerable flexibility after autoactivation. Conversely, Ala342-Phe348 were well resolved, with the side chain of Phe348 extending across the dimer interface and dividing the active site of the adjacent heterodimeric unit into two distinct sections. Because this conformation is not This converts to a single observable conformation after autoproteolysis. One pre-cleavage conformation would have a steric clash with the trans conformation of the G76-P77 loop, suggesting that the dynamics of these loops may be coupled to one another. sterically accessible prior to dissociation of the newly formed C-terminus, formation of the observed state must occur relatively late in the maturation of the active site.
