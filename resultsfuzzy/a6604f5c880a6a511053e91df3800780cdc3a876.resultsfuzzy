Apisarnthanarak et al. 70 Thailand, 2012 Case report-5 melioidosis patients located through active case surveillance. 5 cases reported excess flooding of homes and 0 had traditional risk factors for melioidosis. All cases survived. Auld et al. 22 Canada, 2000 Outbreak investigation-E. coli O157:H7 and Campylobacter outbreak. Outbreak occurred several days after heavy rainfall (5-d accumulation 130-140 mm). Heavy rainfall hypothesized as a causative factor of the outbreak. Carrel et al. 72 Bangladesh , 1983-2003 Longitudinal study-21-y data cluster analysis of health surveillance and Geographic information System to investigate temporal and spatial distribution of cholera following flood protection interventions. 8,500 confirmed cholera cases. Two clusters of lower than expected cases, 3 clusters of higher than expected cases found (p < 0.001). Following flood protection interventions, overall decrease in cholera incidence, differences in the geography of high vs. low spatial clusters of cholera, and shifts in location of unusually high spatio-temporal cholera clusters. Harris et al. 73 Bangladesh Hashizume et al. 23 Bangladesh, 1998 Routine data-number of observed cases of cholera and non-cholera diarrhea per week during flood and post-flood periods compared with expected numbers. During flooding, cholera cases 5.9 times higher (95% Ci 5-7) and non-cholera cases 1.8 times higher (95% Ci 1.6-1.9) than expected. Post-flood period, cholera cases 2.1 times higher (95% Ci 1.9-2.4) and non-cholera cases 1.2 times higher (95% Ci 1.1-1.3).

Studies assessing the relationship between infectious diseases and flooding: Rodent-borne Amilasan et al. 47 The Philippines, 2009 Hospital-based investigation-investigating risk factors for leptospirosis mortality following flooding. Prospective surveillance and retrospective data collection. Outbreak of 471 leptospirosis cases, 51 cases died. Patients predominately young and male. Delayed initiation of treatment, older age, jaundice, anuria, hemoptysis increased risk for death. Bhardwaj et al. 33 india, 2006 Case-control study-identifying risk factors for leptospirosis during flooding. 62 confirmed cases and 253 age and sex matched fever and healthy controls given a questionnaire. Chiu et al. 48 Taiwan, 2004-2008 Routine data-analyze characteristics of patients with laboratory-diagnosed leptospirosis and correlate onset of symptoms with exposure to floodwater. 6 patients identified with history of contact with contaminated soil/water. 5/6 patients (83%) suffered from leptospirosis after typhoon. Dechet et al. 44 Guyana, 2005 Routine data-laboratory testing on suspected leptospirosis hospitalizations and deaths. Confirmed outbreak of leptospirosis after severe flooding. Sero-epidemiogical study-evaluated leptospirosis risk in flood-exposed population. 7/44 patients exposed to floodwaters exhibited anti-Leptospira specific igM antibodies and 5 confirmed positive. Re-testing months later found significant antibody titers > 100 against serovar Copenhangeni in 3 cases (6.8% seroconversion rate). Flooding appeared to be sole risk factor, verification not possible due to lack of control group. Radl et al. 43 Austria, 2010 Outbreak investigation-leptospirosis. 1st documented outbreak of leptospirosis in Austria. Four serologically confirmed cases, all triathlon athletes. Triathlon preceded by heavy rainfall (22 mm (Appendices A, D) older studies have shown associations. In Romania, flooded basements were a significant risk factor for WNV in apartment dwellers (p = 0.01). 59 In 1997, heavy rains in Moravia, Czech Republic resulted in flooding, and mosquito populations in the area amplified immediately. 60 WNV activity was reported in the area. Hubálek and Halouzka 61 stated environmental factors such as flooding can facilitate the re-emergence of WNV. be overwhelmed by the flood waters. 51 While flooding may initially wash out vector populations, they return when the waters recede. Receding flood water can provide ideal breeding habitats. Therefore, vector-borne diseases are likely to have mid-term to long-term impacts on health following flooding (Fig. 1) . Vector-borne virus outbreaks are strictly determined by the presence of the pathogen and particular competent disease vectors. 52 The current and future establishment of exotic mosquito species in Europe is a cause for serious concern, as the newly introduced species may already be disease vectors or could potentially become vectors. West Nile virus (WNV) emerged in Europe after heavy rains and flooding, with outbreaks in Romania in 1996-1997, the Czech Republic in 1997, and Italy in 1998. 53 The 2002 flood in the Czech Republic resulted in mass mosquito breeding with a biting frequency peaking at 70 bites per person per minute. 54 Specimens from 497 flood-affected residents were examined serologically for mosquito-borne viruses. Paired serum samples showed one Tahyna virus infection among 150 residents. Jiménez-Sastré et al. 55 sampled dwellings in Tabasco, Mexico, post-flood for dengue fever cases and found the geographical distribution of dengue fever cases was associated with the proximity of two permanent bodies of water. Chen et al. 21 found heavy precipitation was a significant risk factor for dengue fever (RR = 1.96; 95%; CI 1.53-2.52). Additionally, more non-European Appendix D. Studies assessing the relationship between infectious diseases and flooding: vector-borne Hassan et al. 56 Sudan, 2007 Outbreak investigation-Rift valley fever. 747 confirmed human cases including 230 deaths. Outbreak followed heavy rainfall with severe flooding. Hubalek et al. 54 Czech Republic, 2002 Routine data-specimens from residents in flooded area examined serologically for mosquito-borne viruses. Antibodies detected after flood for Tahyna, Sindbis, and Batai viruses, with only activity found for Tahyna virus among 150 residents. Jiménez-Sastré et al. 55 Mexico, 2010 Cross-sectional study-convenience sampling of dengue fever in flooded colonies. 3 cases with positive serology of igG (0.6%) and 5 cases of positive igM (0.9%). Geographical distribution associated with proximity to 2 permanent water bodies. Tong et al. 57 Australia , 1998-2001 Routine data-assessment of variability in environmental and vector factors on Ross River virus transmission. wu et al. 58 China, 1979-2000 Longitudinal study-review of retrospective data to determine intermediate host snail dispersal patterns and acute and chronic infections of schistosomiasis after floods. Average number of acute schistosomiasis cases recorded in flood years 2.8 times higher than in years with little to no flooding. Re-emerging and new snail infested areas in flood years on average 2.6 and 2.7 times larger than in years with normal water levels. Flooding of marshlands identified as main driver for vector dispersal. responsible for local disease transmission, the factors that influence transmission, location of breeding ground, and which measures of control should be implemented. Local destruction of breeding sites after flooding has receded is extremely effective, so individuals should remove unused vessels and stagnant water when possible. Water storage containers need to be covered to protect from disease vectors, such as egg-laying female mosquitoes. Individuals can protect themselves against mosquito bites by using repellents during biting hours, mosquito nets, and screens in doors and windows. Individual and community awareness and participation is essential for successfully reducing the risk of infectious diseases following flooding. Understanding the social and cultural influences on response behavior in the time of a flood emergency is crucial to inform the design and targeting of warnings and health education messages. 1
