No PCV2 antigen was detected in control or HPS4-infected group by Real-time PCR in the whole experiment. The kinetics of serum viral loads was shown in Fig. 1 . PCV2infected or PCV2/HPS4 coinfected group exhibited a dramatic increase in PCV2 serum load from 3 DPI. Meanwhile, the PCV2 viral loads in PCV2/HPS4 coinfected piglets were significantly higher than in PCV2-infected piglets at 21 DPI and 28 DPI, the maximum level of which in PCV2/HPS4 coinfected piglets reached to 1.87 × 10 8 copies/ml at 21 DPI. The PCV2 genome loads in tissues are summarized in Fig. 2 . All piglets in PCV2-infected and PCV2/HPS4 coinfected groups contained PCV2 antigen in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, lymph nodes and tonsil. 5 piglets in coinfected group and 3 piglets in PCV2-infected group contained PCV2 antigen in the brain. The maximum value of PCV2 genome loads reached to 2.04 × 10 10 copies/g in PCV2-infected (2.04 × 10 10 copies/g) and 3.17× 10 10 copies/g in PCV2/HPS4 coinfected piglets from the tonsil. The PCV2 loads of heart, lung, kidney, brain and lymph nodes in PCV2/HPS4 coinfected piglets were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that in PCV2-infected piglets. Indirect ELISA was performed to detect antibodies against PCV2. The mean PCV2 antibodies S/P (sample/ positive) ratios of pig serum collected were determined (Fig. 3 ). All piglets were negative for antibodies against PCV2 before inoculation. The control and HPS4-infected group remained seronegative to PCV2 throughout the experiment. PCV2-specific antibodies were seroconverted at 14 DPI in PCV2 group, and in PCV2/HPS4 coinfected The levels of the PCV2 antibody were lower in PCV2/ HPS4 coinfected group than that in PCV2-infected group during the whole experimental period and were significantly lower at 14 and 28 DPI. Co-infection with PCV2 and HPS4 resulted in further reductions in total and differential peripheral blood leukocyte counts The total number of WBC in PCV2/HPS4 coinfected group was significantly decreased at 3, 7 and 14 DPI in comparison to the other three groups (Fig. 4a) , and the total WBC Count in PCV2-infected group was significantly lower than the other three groups at 14 DPI. However, the WBC counts in HPS4-infected group appeared significantly higher than the other three groups from 3 DPI to 7 DPI. The total number of monocytes in PCV2/HPS4 coinfected group was significantly lower at 3, 5, 7 and 14 DPI compared to the control and HPS4-infected group (Fig. 4b) , while the number of monocytes in PCV2-infected group decreased significantly at 3, 5 and 7 DPI in comparison to the control group. The number of peripheral blood lymphocytes in PCV2/HPS4 coinfected group was significantly reduced at 3, 5 and 14 DPI in comparison to the control and HPS4-infected group (Fig. 4c) . Compared with the control group, the total number of lymphocytes in PCV2infected group decreased significantly at 3, 5 and 7 DPI, while the number of lymphocytes in the HPS4-infected group was significantly lower at 7 DPI. The number of granulocytes in HPS4-infected group significantly increased at 5 and 7 DPI in comparison to the control group (data not shown). The pathological lung lesions in PCV2/HPS4-coinfected piglets showed severe widened alveolar septa and lymphocytes infiltration (Fig 5a) . The lymphoid nodes lesions showed severe lymphocyte depletion and disintegration (Fig 5b) . The kidney lesions in PCV2/HPS4coinfected piglets included mild focal hyperplasia of the mesenchymal cells (Fig 5c) . The histopathologic lung lesion in PCV2-infected group mainly exhibited a small amout of lymphocytes infiltration (Fig 5d) . The lymphoid nodes lesions showed a considerable degree of depletion, and germinal center atrophy in lymph nodule (Fig 5e) . The kidney lesions in showed renal vein expansion and congestion (Fig 5f) . The lungs lesions in HPS4-infected group followed by lymphocytes infiltration and widened alveolar septa (Fig 5g) . No obvious lymphoid nodes lesions were observed (Fig 5h) , and the kidney lesions were swelling in epithelial cells of proximal tubule (Fig 5i) . No pathological lesions were observed in control group tissues ( Fig. 5j-l) .  


Section:co-infection with pcv2 and hps4 resulted in an increased amount of virus in serum and tissues
