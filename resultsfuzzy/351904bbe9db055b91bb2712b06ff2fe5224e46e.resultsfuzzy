We further analyzed samples excluding workers of age 60 and over. In Korea, 60 is the legally mandated retirement age, and thus the hiked unemployment rate might not be caused by MERS vulnerability, but possibly the substantial number of compulsory retirement persons. For this reason, workers, who aged over 60, were excluded from the analysis and the result is shown in Table 5 . The results of the analysis show that there is no significant difference with Table 4 . In addition, when we consider the different time trends from June, July 2010 to Jun, July 2014, the unemployment effect of rural area becomes relatively mild. It is presumed that these results are drawn by higher proportion of persons, who aged 60 and over, in rural than urban area, as the rural area is relatively more aged. Nevertheless, the direction of our results is consistent. Moreover, we further analyzed the temporary quit for voluntary reasons and the temporarily laid-off from June, July 2014 to June, July 2015. 6 The "temporary quit for voluntary reasons" is defined as "personal affairs (temporary illness, accident, and annual leave)", and the "temporarily laid-off" is defined as "slump, sluggish or shut down workplaces". In accordance with the definitions, the analysis result indicates that for the entire labor market, the temporarily laid-off are hiked after the MERS incident. In rural areas, after the epidemic, the probability of the temporarily laid-off increased in both the group aged between 15 and 49 and the group over 50s. In urban area, after MERS outbreak, the group aged between 15 and 49 shows a higher probability of temporarily laid-off while the possibility for temporary quit by voluntary reasons was higher for the group of over 50s. We could argue that in the urban labor market, the population over 50 s tends to quit their jobs temporarily more to avoid the MERS infection (Table 6) . According to the analysis results, despite its low morbidity and mortality rates, the MERS epidemic had a negative effect on the labor market. The fear of contagion can be said to have become amplified when many people were put in quarantine, which exacerbated the employment condition in the labor market. As Fenichel (2013) pointed out, social distancing can result in the deterioration of the welfare of people who do not belong to the target group when a quarantine policy is 'overdone'. As Eichelberger (2007) argued in his study, the contagion of fear that becomes widespread through rumors and the mass media could have a significant impact on the economy. Particularly for a country with a small territory, like the Republic of Korea, the mere fear of contagion can cause a great jolt to the labor market. In urban areas that suffered a more direct impact of contagious disease, the direct effect from the disease dominated its indirect effect (S Direct > S Indirect ) because the group vulnerable to MERS endured a direct impact to their employment conditions. In contrast, although rural areas experienced a less direct impact of the infectious disease, the rural labor market actually suffered more severe losses than the urban market did. These results confirm the hypothesis that the indirect effect caused by economic losses due to behavioral changes among urban people for fear of contagion might dominate the direct effect of the disease (S Direct < S Indirect ). This argument can thus be corroborated by the fact that the economically active age group, that is, those aged less than 50 years, suffered a relatively more severe blow in the rural labor market. These results are similar to the argument posed by the World Bank (2014) that a contagious disease can have an impact on the economy through two channels: a direct effect of the disease and an indirect effect of people's behavioral changes. 6 Should the MERS epidemic reduces a labor supply, the wage rates could be increased. Stated reversely, when it reduces a labor demand, the wage rate could be decreased. In Korea, however, it is well known that the seniority based wage system, where the yearly wage change is mostly determined by seniority, is prevailed (Woo and Cho, 2016) . Unlike the performance based wage system popular in many developed countries (e.g, the job-based wage system in US), the seniority based wage system makes wage sluggish in response to the economic conditions or the change in labor supply and demand. OECD also evaluates the Korean labor market is rigid due to the seniority based payment and the high employment protection for the regular workers (Cho, 2005; Cho and Keum, 2009; OECD, 2017) . When people, who are vulnerable to epidemics, quit their jobs temporarily to avoid the MERS infection, the impact should be observed instantly during the epidemic period. Thus, instead of focusing on wage rates, we further analyzed the temporarily laid-off and temporary quit by voluntary reasons from June, July 2014 to June, July 2015.
