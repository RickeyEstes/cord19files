Mapping short RNA-seq reads and estimating transcript expression levels Genomic Short-read Nucleotide Alignment Program (GSNAP) was used for alignment and genome construction, and Cufflinks to determine if differential expression and changes in transcript abundance were statistically significant [21, 22] . The RNASeq yielded 55,527,464 reads for the control, 43,263,207 reads for the HP-PRRSV, and 34,555,783 for VR-2332 libraries after quality trimming and excluding any reads less than 25 bp. Cufflinks was used to measure transcript abundances in fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM). The Cuffdiff output contained normalized FPKM for comparison between libraries (Additional file 1). These values were used to calculate the fold change (log2 transformed) in expression between the experimental unit and the control. Examination of the RNASeq data indicated that there were major changes in transcript abundance occurring in the PRRSV-infected TBLN-based unique transcripts [Cuffdiff output (Additional file 1)]. Of these total transcripts, 632 were found to be significant hits in the HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 library and 633 were significant in the US PRRSV VR-2332 library (Table 1) . Of those 632 significant hits within the HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 library 55 hits were up-regulated and 69 were down-regulated more than 3-fold whilst in the US PRRSV VR-2332 library 4 hits were up-regulated and 116 were downregulated more than 3-fold. This derived catalog of expressed genes represents the first comparative analysis of the HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 and VR-2332-infected TBLN transcript abundance profiles and provides a database that informs us of genes involved in normal TBLN physiology, as well as genes whose abundance is altered by PRRSV infection.
