The computational study continues by investigating the pollutant transmission among households in a multistory building. As shown in Fig. 1 , the gaseous pollutant of HCHO is released at the center of the first floor room. The ventilation opening will change according to one of the six window styles shown in Fig. 2 . The pollutant transmission under different ambient temperatures and HCHO release rates are compared first, followed by a discussion of the impact of window types and open areas on pollutant transmission and infection risk.
