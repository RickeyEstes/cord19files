Protein results show a large disparity between finished and draft data. There are 113 protein signature candidates for finished Marburg data compared with only two protein signature candidates for Marburg draft (Figure 7 ). For variola, using all available target data, 97, 14, 6 and 0 protein signatures are predicted using finished, low error, intermediate error and high error draft target data, respectively ( Figure 8 ). Thus, sequencing errors substantially reduce the detection of amino acid sequence conservation, even if sequencing errors occur at the low rate of 10 À4 -10 À5 across most of the genome. The pattern of how additional sequences reduce the number of protein signature candidates also differs for draft compared with finished sequence data. With finished data, there is a large range in the number of peptide signature candidates predicted with 17 or fewer variola genomes, and this range narrows around the lower bound with >17 genomes. With 16 genomes, the 75% quantile mark approaches the final predicted number of 97 signatures ( Figure 8A ). This pattern indicates that there is a set of 97 peptides that are highly conserved among all currently sequenced variolas, which are unlikely to be eroded even as more sequence data are obtained. In other words, additional sequence data are probably not needed at this time in order to computationally predict good peptide signature targets, and as few as 16 finished target sequences would most likely have been adequate to generate this same list of $100 peptide signatures. Draft data, in contrast, whether they are of low or high quality, mask the above pattern ( Figure 8B and C): the range and 75th quantile of the number of peptide signatures gradually decline with each additional target sequence (rather than a sudden, sharp drop as is seen with the finished data), suggesting that additional target sequences would continue to erode the number of peptide signatures. This occurs since sequencing errors occur at random, in different locations in each of the draft target genomes, and obscure the truly conserved peptides. One might falsely infer from peptide SAP results based on the draft data that additional sequencing (beyond the 28 variola major genomes used here) would be useful in generating peptide signature candidates. In actuality, however, SAP analyses using the finished sequence data indicate that there are already ample sequence data for peptide signature prediction.
