The PPV of Nph specimen examination by PCR discovered a considerable, pathogen-dependent variability. The highest PPV (92%) was found for S. pneumoniae, the most prevalent pathogen. S. aureus and M. catarrhalis demonstrated low PPVs and weak association between MEF and Nph PCR results, having a high proportion of MEF-negative/ Nph-positive results. Remarkably, the S. aureus DNA was always detected in a combination with the other NAs, and the M. catarrhalis DNA was more prevalent in the nasopharynx than in the middle ear. These data may suggest that both species are more likely to colonize the Table 3 The value of PCR results from the nasopharynx in predicting the presence of a pathogen in the middle ear.
