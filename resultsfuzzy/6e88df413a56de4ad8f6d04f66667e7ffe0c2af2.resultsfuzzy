All ASFV ORFs were weighted and ranked using Vaxign methods as described in the Methods section. The Vaxign top 30 ranked ORFs are provided in Table S1 in the online version at DOI: http://dx.doi. org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2017.01.004. Although the Vaxign ranking was used as the basis for selection of vaccine candidate antigens, the final candidates selected for immunogenicity evaluation in swine considered additional factors, such as gene function, and previously reported antigenic and immunogenic properties of particular genes. Based on these considerations, twelve of the top 30 Vaxign ranked ORFs and two previously well characterized antigens with reported induction of neutralizing antibodies which may facilitate protective immunity, B646L (p72) and CP204L (Neilan et al., 2004) , were also selected for attempted expression in both HEK 293 cells and in MVA viral vectors (see Table S2 in the online version at DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2017.01.004).
