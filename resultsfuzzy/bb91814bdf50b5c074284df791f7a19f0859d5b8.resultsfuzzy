This stage includes the outcomes of this research. The scope is not only to compare the previous published research to each other, but also to determine the importance of the research field of syndromic surveillance using web data. In this section, the results of this systematic review are presented based on the 225 papers that are relevant to the examined subject and finally selected. 2.3.1 RQ1: Is the academic interest growing or declining? To be able to answer this question, we must see the development of the articles and other items that were published each year from 2004. That means that we must find when these publications were made and determine the trend. The first (relevant) one is published in 2004 and concerns the study of Johnson et al. (2004) , while the last one was published in 2018. Many studies occurred after 2009 as a result of the 2009 influenza pandemic. A lot of articles refer to influenza and particularly to the H1N1 virus that was responsible for many cases with severe symptoms during that year. This virus type has an unusual characteristic: it does not affect people over 60 years old but many young people, adults, and children. This virus type can lead to pneumonia if not early diagnosed and treated. The term swine flu was used by the news media in America and a lot of money were directed to the treatment of this disease. For instance, in Russia, the government has allocated 4 billion rubles (US$140 million) to buy the initial 43 million doses of vaccines, to perform In Fig. 2 .3, the thicker line represents the number of publications per year, while the dotted thinner line represents the trend, as it was calculated from the following polynomial formula: y 5 0:3042x 2 2 1:3639x 1 2:7626 where y is the expected number of publications and x is the current year-2003 Most articles per year are observed in 2017 (50 articles), but from 2013 until 2017, each year over 20 articles have been published regarding syndromic surveillance using the Web, except from the year 2015, in which we observe 12 publications. It seems that many scientists, research centers, or organizations appreciate the usability of the Web to provide data and tools for monitoring epidemics and outbreaks when they are effectively used along with the science of statistics. During the year 2018, we have allocated only 20 articles, but this is normal since this systematic review is conducted in June 15, 2018. As a result, the number of publications for the year 2018 is calculated as 50, using the abovementioned formula. The results of this analysis answers to the first research question that the academic interest grows over time. Health issues are widely discussed in this research field as it is critical for modeling and predicting purposes concerning public health. Of the 225 publications, 161 (71.55%) refer explicitly to one or more health subject or disease. Some researchers conducted researches for more than one health subject (6.22%), while others focused on one disease (65.33%). There is a relatively large percentage of researches that did not examine specific diseases, but the syndromic surveillance generally (28.45%). Table 2 .1 includes all cases. The relative % column indicates the percentage of the publications containing at least one health subject/disease. As we can see in this table, 103 published articles are related exclusively to influenza (45.78%, relative percentage 63.98%), 10 articles are about dengue, 5 articles are about HIV/AIDS, 4 articles are about malaria, 4 articles about cancer or breast cancer, and 3 articles about Ebola exclusively. There are also two references for foodborne illnesses and two for hand, foot, and mouth epidemics. Other health subjects are discussed once, such as the African swine fever, malaria, Lyme disease, listeria, foodborne illness, Ebola, depression, dementia, communicable diseases, cholera, human papillomavirus, measles, respiratory syncytial virus, syphilis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. As we see, not all the abovementioned are diseases that can be transmitted, although depression is s special case of psychological phenomenon (disorder) related to individuals. However, regarding public health, the research revealed that the Web can be a useful source of data for other nontransmitted diseases or disorders as cancer , or depression (Yang, Huang, Peng, & Tsai, 2010) . There are also articles which examine more than one disease and we include them separately in the table. Such cases are influenza and listeria, influenza and pertussis, cholera and dengue, influenza, cholera and rabies virus, influenza and dengue, and influenza and tuberculosis. Three studies include more than three diseases in their area of examination. Another aspect is the keywords used to retrieve data from the internet for those researchers who have built specific databases for this purpose. In 78 studies, the scientists used as a search term, the name of the disease, in the language of the country they examined or using the English-speaking terms. Others used the words for their symptoms or other keywords, for example, "cold" to detect influenza, based both on the weather conditions of this common disease and on social media (Shikha, Younghee, & Mihui, 2017) . Weather is an important factor for the development of epidemics and we will come back to this matter, since there are some researches from scientists that are classified as relevant. We will further discuss the potential of weather forecast to help syndromic surveillance using the Web. The above results show an analysis regarding the time, the epidemics, the location, the web data, and the data analysis methods, which are presented in the examined researches and included in this review. Regarding the time, more publications are made every year based on researches from various countries from the world. This is normal, as technology and web continuously advances. The data from the web are now abundant and many scientists can take advantage of it. Many fields of science are now included in this effort to harness the web and estimate epidemics and health issues. Computer science, statistics, sociology, and medicine work together to investigate the appropriate method to exploit the web data. Various methods are used to analyze the data in a complex framework with the ultimate goal for the social benefit. While broadband internet is nowadays widely used as the data speeds are growing with VDSL and ADSL lines (Very high speed digital subscriber line, Asymmetric digital subscriber line) by using fiber optics cables, there is still a part of the world undeveloped, such as Africa, Central America, or South America. As we saw, only four studies examine web data for Africa, one for Central America, and six for South America, as people in these countries may still have not the economy power, the expertise, or the infrastructure to widely use web services. That's why the data volume is limited in these geographical areas. On the other hand, more advanced countries seek the way of using web data for health purposes. Regarding epidemics, influenza seems to provide plenty of data and this explains the big percentage of studies that use data for this disease. It is also a disease with many health complications and a large number of deaths annually and worldwide. Twitter is found to be used in a large scale, as it may give many and useful advantages. Through the special APIs (REST and STREAMING API), there is the capability to track messages real-time, geolocated from almost every part of the world. The messages from Twitter, called tweets, provide the sufficient amount of data that can be further analyzed to help in the estimation of epidemics, although this procedure requires more computer programming techniques and algorithms. Google services, on the other hand, such as the search engine or the Trends, are also extensively used and are found to be also accurate enough to track epidemics. Nevertheless, as we have conducted researches with these two popular data sources, we believe that the potential of social media and Twitter particularly is bigger, despite certain constraints and limitations.
