leader-body junction (related to Fig. 3E) . This table extends the information for the recombination events using the canonical leader TRS joined to noncanonical 3 ′ sites. "Startpos" is the genomic coordinate where the first AUG appears in the resulting recombination product. "Resultingsequence" shows the sequence near the recombination site with the nucleotides from the 5 ′ -side in lowercase, and those from the 3 ′ -side in uppercase. "Annot_cds" is the name of an ORF that shares the start codon position with the recombination product by the "first AUG" rule. "Annot_cds_start" and "annot_cds_end" indicate the interval of the annotated canonical ORF that matches to the start codon in the recombination product. "Startmatch_name" and "startmatch_offset" show the canonical ORF that overlaps with the position of the first appearing AUG in the recombination product, and the distance between the AUG and the start codon position of the ORF. "Stopmatch_name" and "stopmatch_offset" show the canonical ORF that overlaps with the expected stop codon position in case the translation starts at the first appearing AUG, and the relative coordinate of the "expected" stop codon Kim et al.
