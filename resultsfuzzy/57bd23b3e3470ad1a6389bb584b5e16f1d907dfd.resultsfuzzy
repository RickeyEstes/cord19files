Recently, Yuan and co-workers showed that the overexpression of SARS-CoV 3b in COS-7, Vero and 293 induces cell-cycle arrest but they could only observed significant apoptosis in COS-7 cells (Yuan et al., 2005a) . Here, a time-course study was performed to characterize the profile of cell-death induced by the over-expression of 3b in Vero E6 cells in order to understand the role of 3b during the viral replication cycle in Vero E6 cells. In addition, the cell-death profiles of full-length 3b and a deletion mutant, 3b 124-154, which lacks the C-terminal 30 amino acids, were compared to that of Bax, a classical apoptosis inducer. The general opinion is that cell death can either be as a result of necrosis, defined as a passive and non-physiological type of death caused by accidental and acute damage to the cell, or the consequence of apoptosis, defined as an active and genetically regulated process of cell suicide by which an organism eliminates senescent, abnormal and potentially harmful cells (for reviews, see Ameison, 2002; Guimarães and Linden, 2004; Los et al., 2002; Nelson and White, 2004; Zhivotosky, 2004) . These two forms of cell death are distinguishable by their morphological and biochemical effects on the cell. However, recent studies have shown that necrosis is also highly regulated and a fine regulatory line exists between necrosis and apoptosis as many anti-apoptotic mechanisms are also effective against necrosis (for reviews, see Proskuryakov et al., 2003; Tavernarakis, 2002, 2003) . For the sake of simplicity, we shall use the term necrosis to refer to the form of cell death not involving the apoptotic early steps, and secondary necrosis to describe the subsequent degradative changes that apoptotic cells undergo at the late stages of apoptosis. Vero E6 cells were analysed at 6, 12, 18 and 48 h after transfection with plasmids for expressing HA-3b, HA-3b 124-154 and HA-Bax to determine the degree of apoptosis and necrosis. The expression of the proteins were detected using anti-HA monoclonal antibody ( Fig. 1A and B ). As shown in Fig. 1C , the over-expression of 3b and 3b 124-154 resulted in a slight increase in caspase 3 activity, which is a hallmark of apoptosis, at 6 h post-transfection. The level of caspase 3 activity continued to increase until 12 h after transfection but showed gradual decrease at 18 and 48 h after transfection. Consistently, the expression of 3b and 3b 124-154 also resulted in cleavage of endogenous PARP, which is a substrate of activated caspase-3 (Fig. 1A) from 12 h onwards. This profile mirrored that of Bax, except that the level of caspase 3 activities for 3b and 3b 124-154 were lower than for Bax at all the time-points and that Bax already showed high level of caspase 3 activities and PARP cleavage at 6 h ( Fig. 1B and C) . These results are somewhat different from the report by Yuan et al. (2005a) where the over-expression of 3b did not induce apoptosis in Vero cells, and furthermore, showed that the C-terminal 30 amino-acids of 3b are not important for apoptosis induction. The discrepancy may be due to differences in transfection efficiency and/or sensitivity of the assays used. In all cases, we noted that a decease in caspase 3 activity after 18 h of transfection, suggesting that the apoptotic cells were going into secondary necrosis. A key marker of a cell undergoing necrosis is the loss of their membrane integrity and the release of their cytoplasmic contents into the surrounding culture. Thus, the CytoTox-ONE assay (Promega), which measures the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from cells with damaged membranes, was used to quantify the degree of necrosis at different time-points. For the over-expression of 3b and 3b 124-154, significant amounts of LDH were released as early as 6 h post-transfection as compared to the low level of LDH released from mock transfected cells (Fig. 1D) . The levels of LDH then increased gradually up to 12 h. Interestingly, the level of LDH released from cells expressing Bax was about the same as for 3b and 3b 124-154 at 6 h, 12 h and 18 h, even though the level of apoptosis caused by the over-expression of Bax was consistently higher that caused by 3b or 3b 124-154. The gradual increase in the level of necrosis in the Bax expressing cells was expected as apoptotic cells would undergo secondary necrosis lanes 1-4) , a potent apoptosis inducer in transiently transfected Vero E6 cells. All proteins were tagged at the N-terminal with a HA motif for easy detection. Cells were harvested at 6, 12, 18 and 48 h post-transfection and the expression levels of HA-tagged proteins were determined with anti-HA antibody (middle panel). Mock transfected cells were used as negative control. The same samples were assayed for the cleavage of endogenous full-length PARP, which is a hallmark of apoptosis, from 116 to 83 kDa (upper panel). Equal loading of total cell lysates were verified by using an antibody to detect endogenous actin (lower panel). (C) The CaspACE fluorometric assay system from Promega Corporation was used to measure the activation of caspase-3 protease activity, which is another hallmark of apoptosis. (D) The CytoTox-ONE homogenous membrane integrity assay from Promega Corporation was used to measure the amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released from necrotic cells. For (C and D), these assays were performed at each time-point for HA-3b (solid black bars), HA-3b 124-154 (unshaded bars), HA-Bax (solid gray bars) and mock transfected cells (striated bars). All experiments were performed in duplicates and the average values with standard deviations are plotted. at the late stages (Ameison, 2002; Guimarães and Linden, 2004; Los et al., 2002; Nelson and White, 2004; Zhivotosky, 2004) . These results showed that the expression of 3b induces necrosis as early as 6 h post-transfection when the level of apoptosis was very much lower than that for Bax. Again, the C-terminal 30 amino acids of 3b do not have any effects on its ability to induce necrosis. At time-points greater than 6 h post-infection, it appears that both necrosis and apoptosis (and secondary necrosis) were occurring simultaneously in cell over-expressing 3b or 3b 124-154. At 48 h post-transfection, there was a surge of LDH release from cells expressing 3b or 3b 124-154 or Bax or even the mock transfected cells, indicating that by this time, the Lipofectamine reagent used for transfection had some unspecific cytotoxic effects or the cells were over-grown (Fig. 1D) . Thus, subsequent experiments were only performed up to 18 h post-transfection. TUNEL assays were performed to examine whether the 3b and 3b 124-154 could induce DNA fragmentation, a common phenomenon of apoptosis. At all the time-points, DNA fragmentations were observed in 3b-and 3b 124-154-transfected Vero E6 cells. A representative set of data for 18 h post-transfection is shown in Fig. 2 (first and second rows) . DNA fragmentations in cells expressing 3b or 3b 124-154 (note that the typical transfection efficiency achieved in this study was about 30%) were indicated by FITC positive signals while nuclei of all the cells in the field were counterstained using propidium iodide. DNA fragmentation was also be detected in the cells transfected with Bax (Fig. 2, third row) and in cells that were treated with DNase I (positive control) (Fig. 2, fifth row) . Under the same exposure conditions, there was no sign of DNA fragmentation in the mock transfected cells (Fig. 2, fourth row) . Next, the subcellular localization of 3b and 3b 124-154 was examined by subcellular fractionation studies performed at 6, 12 and 18 h post-transfection. Consistent with previous report (Yuan et al., 2005b) , the full-length 3b protein was found to partition solely in the nuclear fraction at all the time-points (Fig. 3A) . The 3b deletion mutant, 3b 124-154, was initially found in the cytoplasmic fraction (6 h post-transfection), but with time, could be more efficiently detected in the membrane and nuclear fractions (Fig. 3B) . As a control for the fractionation method, endogenous actin was detected in the cytoplasmic fractions for all transfections. Next, indirect immunofluorescence was also performed at 18 h post-transfection to compare the subcellular localization of 3b and 3b 124-154 in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 3C) . Consistent with the fractionation experiments above, indirect immunofluorescence revealed that the 3b protein was localized primarily in the nucleolus of transfected cells and somewhat less around the nucleus. The latter is likely to be the nuclear membrane as 3b was isolated in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 3A ). In contrast, 3b 124-154 was localized to the perinuclear regions, while Bax was diffusely localized in the cytoplasm. Since the fractionation experiments showed that 3b 124-154 was found predominantly in the membrane and nuclear fractions at late time-points (Fig. 3B) , it is likely that the intense staining around the nucleus represents both perinuclear membranous organelles, like the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus, as well as nuclear membrane, with the latter being partitioned into the nuclear fraction. Amino acids 134-154 of 3b have been previously shown to contain a nucleolar localization signal (Yuan et al., 2005b) . Consistently, we observed that unlike full-length 3b, the 3b 124-154 mutant was not efficiently transported to the nucleolus. In summary, we demonstrated that Vero E6 cells transfected with a construct for expressing 3b underwent necrosis as early as 6 h after transfection and underwent simultaneous necrosis and apoptosis at later time-points. At all the time-points analysed, the apoptosis induced by the expression of 3b was less than the level induced by Bax but the level of necrosis was comparable to that induced by over-expression of Bax. Hence, it is clear that 3b induces necrosis at the early time-point and apoptosis (and secondary necrosis) at late time-points. The deletion mutant 3b 124-154 behaves in a similar manner indicating that the localization of 3b does not seems to be important for the celldeath pathways since full-length 3b is localized predominantly to the nucleolus, while the mutant is found to be concentrated in the peri-nuclear regions. Recently, Yount et al. (2005) showed by reverse genetics experiment that recombinant virus containing a deletion of the ORF3a, which resulted in the movement of ORF3b to the 5 end of the mRNA and an increase in the level of 3b expression, has a lower viral yield than wild-type virus. On the other hand, if both 3a and 3b are deleted, there is no significant difference from wild-type virus, thus suggesting that the over-expression of 3b may have a deleterious effect on viral yield (Yount et al., 2005) . It remains to be determined if the necrotic effect on the cells caused by the over-expression of 3b could play a part in reducing the viral titre. Interestingly, Hussain et al. (2005) reported that the 3b protein can also be expressed from an independent subgenomic RNA but this is a rare event. Given the findings that over-expression of 3b can cause rapid necrosis and may reduce virus titer in cell culture systems, it is crucial to further understand how the expression level of 3b is modulated during SARS-CoV infection. Many virus genomes encode gene products that can modulate apoptosis and the regulation of apoptosis in infected the host is an important determinant in the struggle between virus and host for survival (for review, see Barber, 2001; Benedict et al., 2002; Boya et al., 2001; Hay and Kannourakis, 2002; Mori et al., 2004; Thomson, 2001) . However, the role of necrosis in viral infection is less clear, partly because the necrosis process is less well-studied. Nevertheless, to date, necrosis has been shown to play an important role during viral infection by at least four viruses (An et al., 2000; Espinoza et al., 2005; Miller and Fox, 2004; Ran et al., 1999) . Whether or not necrosis is important for SARS-CoV infection remains to be determined. Interestingly, necrosis was observed in different tissues obtained from SARS-CoV infected patients (Chong et al., 2004; Ding et al., 2003; Lang et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2005) and many SARS-CoV infected laboratory animals, including cynomologus macaques Kuiken et al., 2003) , rhesus macaques (Qin et al., 2005) , common marmosets (Greenough et al., 2005) , golden syrian hamster (Roberts et al., 2005b) and aged BALB/c mice (Roberts et al., 2005a) . However, necrosis was not observed in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells (Yan et al., 2004) , suggesting that the level of 3b may not be sufficient to induce necrosis in Vero E6 cells. However, we cannot rule out that the expression of 3b may be higher in SARS patients and/or SARS-CoV infected animals than in SARS-CoV infected cell culture. Further studies using animal models will be necessary to give a more definitive answer.
