We performed 10-fold cross validation of the SVM model with several datasets which contain different ratios of positive to negative data (1:1, 1:2 and 1:3). Due to the randomness of selecting negative data, we constructed three different datasets for each ratio of positive to negative data. Table 3 shows the results of the cross validation. The best performance of the SVM model was observed in the balanced dataset with 1:1 ratio of positive to negative data. As expected, running the SVM model on unbalanced datasets resulted in lower performances than running it on the balanced dataset with 1:1 ratio of positive to negative data. Datasets are available at http://bclab.inha. ac.kr/VirusHostPPI. We also examined the contribution of features to the prediction performance of our SVM model. Table 4 compares different combinations of features in 10-fold cross validation of the SVM model with the 1:1 dataset of Table 3 . Among the single features, RFAT was better than the others (i.e., FDAT, AC, composition, transition, and distribution) in all performance measures. With RFAT alone, the SVM model achieved an accuracy above 83% and an MCC above 0.668, which indicates that RFAT is a very powerful feature in predicting virus-host PPIs. Although RFAT is a powerful feature, performance gain was obtained with it was used with combination of other features. For example, using three features of RFAT, FDAT and AC showed a better performance than using RFAT alone. The best performance of the SVM model was observed when all six features were used. Table 5 shows the results of testing the prediction model on 2 independent datasets of PPIs of H1N1 and Ebola virus, which were not used in training the models. As discussed earlier, proteins of H1N1 virus have a sequence similarity of 9.6% to those of other viruses, and proteins of Ebola virus have a sequence similarity of 10.9% to other viruses on average. Despite such a low sequence similarity of proteins in test datasets to those in training datasets, all prediction models trained with TR1-TR4 showed a relatively high performance in independent testing. Prediction models trained with host-virus PPIs (TR2 and TR4) showed a slightly better performance than those trained with human-virus PPIs (TR1 and TR3) in both H1N1 and Ebola viruses. The models showed a higher sensitivity for
