Results of estimation by both PraiseWinsten and NeweyeWest procedures are displayed in Table 3 . The results are similar in general, representing the reliability of the model, although there are some differences in significance and magnitude of the coefficients for variables EX, APT and dummy variables, as noted. The Since the NeweyeWest procedure is only expected to outperform the PraiseWinsten method in the presence of higher-order autocorrelation, inferences were subsequently made based on the results from the PraiseWinsten estimation method. The coefficients of income and real effective exchange rates were the greatest in size and highly significant, consistent with the results of preceding studies (Lim, 1997) . A one percent increase in average household income caused 1.5 percent increase approximately, in the number of quarterly outbound travelers. The effect from purchasing parity changes was relatively smaller at 0.65 percent. As hypothesized, the income elasticity greater than unity confirmed that outbound travel is considered as a luxury good by the Korean people. Accordingly, the consumption of international travel increased at a rate greater than that of income. The coefficient of APT was significant and stable across both models. A one percent increase in apartment prices in Korea caused an approximately 0.39 percent increase in the number of outbound travelers per quarter. Although the magnitude of the effect on aggregate demand was less than one third of that from income, the results nevertheless serve as evidence of the effect of adjusted expectations of wealth on consumption patterns. Korean demand for outbound tourism seems to not only rely on actual income, but also on expected future earnings based on housing price gains during the sample period. As a result, Hypothesis 1 was supported and the current study found that housing assets had a significant wealth effect on Korean demand for outbound tourism. On the other hand, Hypothesis 2 was rejected in both models with a low probability. A number of potential factors may have contributed to this finding. One possibility is that the high volatility of stock prices might prevent owners from viewing the appreciation as a permanent gain. The insignificant results could also be attributed to inefficient estimation; quarterly data may have insufficient sensitivity as stock prices are highly volatile in nature, as seen in Fig. 1 . Yet another possibility is that the wealth effect from financial assets could be insignificant at the aggregate level. This may be due to a comparably low allocation of relative wealth in the stock market, which accounts for less than 20% of total household wealth, whereas housing assets account for more than 75%. The smaller amount of total investments in equity stocks, which resulted in a trivial absolute increase in expected wealth, may also account for the result (Cho, 2006) . Among the quarter dummies, the third quarter, which includes the Korean summer vacation season, was the most sizable and significant. The dummy variables for macro events, except for the September 11 dummy, were significant. The Asian Financial Crisis, the net effect of depressed income and purchasing parity, decreased outbound travel demand by roughly 1 percent. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) decreased outbound travel demand by approximately 4 percent. A possible explanation for the insignificant coefficient of the 9/11 DUMMY variable is the effect of substitution to other destinations. Although trips to the US from Korea significantly declined immediately after the 9/11 attack, total outbound demand may have been sustained by substituting other nearby destinations, such as Southeast Asia or Oceania, that had a relatively lower perceived risk of terrorism (Lim, 2004) . As observed, the effect of unrealized wealth, the net of income and purchasing power parity changes, seems to influence the outbound travel of the Korean people. Although the effect is rather small compared to the two most important variables that govern international travel, we nevertheless found a significant causal relationship between expectations of wealth and the decision to travel internationally. Consequently, distinguishing wealth and income in travel demand may be an important task based on analytic results. Even though the wealth effect may only be conditionally present for certain economies and asset types, Korean economy tourism demand can be partly explained by appreciation in housing assets. For example, tourist surveys often utilize the income levels of tourists to explain tourism demand or expenditure (Jang, Bai, Hong, & O'Leary, 2004; Jang, Ismail, & Ham, 2002) . However, in order to produce more efficient estimates of income and/or price effects on tourism goods, changes in net assets and the relative location of a person in the society's wealth distribution curve can be taken into account. Income and wealth variables are likely to be correlated with one another since they are both subject to the greater movements of the national economy. This suggests that efficiency of conventional tourism demand models can be enhanced and their accuracy improved by utilizing important wealth variables.
