Wallinga and Teunis developed a likelihood-based algorithm that relies upon symptom onset data to determine the mean effective reproduction number, R e , over time [47] . Denoting L ij as the relative likelihood that case j was the source of infection for case i, the Wallinga-Teunis algorithm for SARS outbreaks is comprised of In Eq. The mean basic reproduction number, R 0 , for the 2003 Taiwan outbreak is related to (a) the total number (670) of follow-on infections, (b) reported daily onsets of illness in Fig. 1 and (c) mean effective reproduction numbers in Fig. 2 . If O(n) symbolizes the reported number of illness onsets on day number n, the defining relationship for R 0 becomes where n = 4, 14 and 114 are the respective day numbers for the onset of the index case, the immediately following onsets and the final onset. The resulting value of R 0 is 2.23, which conforms to comparable findings of Lipsitch and co-authors. Since DEs (versus IDEs) represent a more conventional approach to the reconstruction of outbreak dynamics, a system of parallel or analogous DEs can serve as a baseline for assessing the merits of the basic and network models put forward here. The desired DEs encompass many of the parameters in Tables 1 and 2 and the principal free parameter is still the SARS transmission rate. This rate is assumed to be a fixed non-zero constant within a time interval corresponding to the duration of SARS transmission (in Fig. 2 ) and its numerical value assures a total of 670 follow-on infections. Employing lower-case labels for populated compartments and sub-compartments, the initial conditions for the DEs are eð0Þ P 1; ð45Þ Note that s, x s , e, c, c iso , r, h r and h f are, respectively, analogs of S, X S , E, I, X I , R, H R and H F . A system of eight DEs is mathematically defined below: _ cðtÞ ¼ ð1 À u 2 ÞeðtÞ=l 1 À cðtÞ=l 3 ; ð51Þ _ c iso ðtÞ ¼ u 2 eðtÞ=l 1 þ cðtÞ=l 3 À ð1=l 2 þ 1=ðl 2 À l 3 ÞÞc iso ðtÞ; ð52Þ Although Eq. (20) still defines the functional form of the new infection rate in the above equations, an epidemic curve no longer constrains the time history of p(t) or, for that matter, b(t). Of particular interest is the following specification of the disease transmission rate: where the adjusted value of b FIX is 0.4899, U stands for the Heaviside step function and t off equals 110 days. Lastly, since definitions of all parameters in Eqs. (46)-(55) are already at hand, the reasoning behind compartmental entry and exit rates (as well as delays) is evident. Fig. 3 contains two sets of numerical results from the basic epidemic model (Eqs. (2)-(4) and (9)- (19) ) and one set of numerical results from the system of parallel DEs (Eqs. (44)-(55) ). Regarding the basic epidemic model, red curves signify that both the backtracking Monte Carlo algorithm and the IDEs relied upon Gamma PDFs, while green curves are connected with an input of Exponential PDFs. Differences between red and green curves for the same compartment or sub-compartment are generally quite small; the exceptions are results for X I (n) and H R (n). But even small differences between red and green curves for either p(n) or I(n) can lead to more noticeable differences between red and green curves for b(n). This is to say that b(n) tends to follow the ratio of p(n) over I(n), assuming a small outbreak in a large population. Black curves in Fig. 3 describe numerical results from the system of parallel DEs. The three curves for p(n) yield the same total number of follow-on infections, but the black curve is in stark contrast to the companion red and green curves. Of course, the slow rise and sharp decline of the black curve for p(n) are due to the assumed rectangular shape of the transmission rate. Slow rise times are likewise distinguishing aspects of the other black curves in Fig. 3 . Since the basic epidemic model and Gamma PDFs may have yielded the most realistic results in Fig. 3 , some detailed aspects of the red curves are worth mentioning. As many as 3000 people were quarantined in a single day ($D + 95) and the maximum number of people in quarantine (on any given day) was found to be 50 000 ($D + 115). Similarly, the calculations show that nearly 175 (50) SARS case-patients were (were not) in hospital isolation on or about D + 85. And after D + 24 or so (20 days after onset of the index case), the calculated waveform of the time-varying transmission rate is close to the waveform in Fig. 2 . In passing, note that red curves in Fig. 3 and Eq. (20) gave rise to the points (vice solid curve) in the upper graph of Fig. 1 . Focusing on the network-based model, the total number of new infections in the jth connectivity class is the subject of Fig. 4 . The contents of this figure originate in Eq. (36) , where the new infection rate, p j (t), is summed over all time steps (t = nDt and Dt = 1 day). With regard to the upper graph of Fig. 4 , the combinative mixing parameter is fixed at a value of 0.147 and the initial infection is either distributed across all connectivity classes (j SEED = PDF 7 ) or localized within a single class (j SEED = 3, 10, 30 or 100). In our network-based reconstruction of the Taiwan SARS outbreak, the disposition of the initial infection seldom influenced allocations of new (follow-on) infections to connectivity classes. But placing the initial infection in a higher connectivity class (specifically, j SEED = 100) did significantly increase the number of new infections in that class 8 (leading to the small blue spike in the upper graph of Fig. 4) . The location of the initial infection is fixed (j SEED = 3) and the combinative mixing parameter takes on different values (e = 0.147, 0.247, 0.347 and 0.447) in the lower graph of Fig. 4 . As the value of e increases in this graph, 'shoulder' regions (between j ffi 30 and j ffi 400) of the curves become more pronounced; also, as j decreases from about 10 down to 1, smaller values of e give rise to slightly larger numbers of new infections. To better illustrate how the combinative mixing parameter affects the distribution of new infections within our contact network, consider the following definitions: and g jk ¼ X n p jk ðnÞ: ð58Þ The function p jk (n) is the time-dependent new infection rate in the jth connectivity class due to infectors in the kth connectivity class, while g jk is the resultant number of new infections. Density plots in Fig. 5 are associated with j SEED = 3 and selected values of e, and each of these plots shows variations of g jk for j and k ranging from 1 to 50. The lower-right density plot contains the color legend for the entire figure; e.g., a dark blue pixel indicates g jk 6 1 and a pure red pixel means g jk P 3. A 'pool' of red pixels (k 6 2 and j 6 12) and a few more red pixels along the connectivity class is relatively small, then the magnitude of the early spike is relatively large. Regarding the lower four graphs and a fixed location (j SEED = 3) of the initial infection, previously-considered values of e engender four time histories of the new infection rate in each connectivity class. In the 3rd (100th) connectivity class, lower (higher) values of the combinative mixing parameter produce higher (lower) peak values of the new infection rate. These influences of the combinative mixing parameter are consistent with curves in the lower graph of Fig. 4 . Fig. 6 does not reveal a cascade of infection affecting lower and lower connectivity classes over time. However, Fig. 7 displays new infection rates in very high connectivity classes (j = 300, 500 and 700) that are compatible with the concept of an infection cascade. More specifically, the maximum new infection rate in the 700th (500th) connectivity class precedes the peak rate in the 500th (300th) connectivity class. Perhaps it's worth noting again that sizes of very high connectivity classes are minuscule in our network-based model. Numerical results for the time-varying rate of SARS transmission, x(n), are in Fig. 8 . Transmission rates for different values of j SEED span two time frames (n 6 25 and 25 < n 6 120) in the two upper graphs, and additional transmission rates for different values of e are displayed similarly in the two lower graphs. The fixed value of e for the upper graphs is 0.147 and the fixed value of j SEED for the lower graphs is 3. The seeding assumption shapes the early transmission rate, whereas the combinative mixing parameter is most influential at later times. And because all complete time histories in Fig. 8 produce the same number (670) of new infections, the lower graphs show that smaller e values entail higher late-time transmission rates. As e approaches a value of 0.047, the Pearson correlation coefficient vanishes and the connectivity classes of linked individuals become uncorrelated. A network-based SARS modeling investigation by Meyers, Pourbohloul, Newman, Skowronski and Burnham [48] warrants some discussion before considering further variations of the present author's modeling parameters. Meyers and co-authors constructed a detailed contact network by focusing on households, schools, workplaces and hospitals and by drawing upon available data for 1000 households ($2600 people) in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia. Percolation theory and the node degree distribution for this contact network (with node degree correlation) enabled the investigators to theoretically and numerically predict outcomes of outbreaks for various fixed values of the transmissibility (transmission rate). Similarly, they obtained contrasting results for Poisson and scale-free contact networks (without node degree correlation). It is also worth noting that the modeling approach of these investigators yielded no information about outbreak dynamics. Revisiting the upper-left graph in Fig. 8 , it's apparent that the connectivity class of the seed can strongly influence the early (6 day number 13 or so) transmission rate for the selected historical outbreak; i.e., to attain the same basic reproduction number, the early transmission rate for a seed in the 3rd connectivity class generally dominates the accompanying early rate for a seed in the 100th connectivity class. The clear implication is that the basic reproduction number for an unconstrained outbreak in a contact network depends on the connectivity class of the initial infection. In this vein, Fig. 8 complements and partially supports the impact of initial conditions as described by Meyers and co-authors. Summing over connectivity classes in the network-based model generates aggregate populated compartments and sub-compartments that are identical to counterparts in the basic epidemic model. This confluence of epidemic models for structured and unstructured populations is due to a common modeling framework, common parameters and linked time-varying transmission rates (deriving from the same epidemic curve). Most importantly, under certain constraints, dynamical impacts of parameter variations in the basic epidemic model will also be aggregate dynamical impacts of the same parameter variations in the network-based model. The main constraint calls for maintaining the correspondence of transmission rates in the two models. A variation of parameters in Table 1 , for example, may significantly alter the dynamics of the Taiwan outbreak through changes in the disease transmission rate, which could be derived anew using the basic or network-based model. Alternatively, variations of parameters in Table 2 could be explored by utilizing either model with the appropriate previously-derived rate of disease transmission. In bringing this section of the paper to a close, quantitative results from the basic epidemic model elucidate changes in outbreak dynamics due to variations of selected parameters in Tables 1 and 2 . The onset-to-diagnosis PDF (G 3 ) governs the random time interval extending from the onset of illness up to a clinical diagnosis. In the models under consideration, this time interval is fundamentally the amount of time that a contagious individual is free to infect other people before he or she enters hospital isolation. It's noteworthy that onset-to-diagnosis periods (l 3 for either the Taiwan or Singapore (l 3 = 3.09 and r 3 = 2.50) outbreak. This information leads to the following question: How would longer (Hong Kong or Singapore) onset-to-diagnosis periods have affected the dynamics of the Taiwan outbreak? The upper graph in Fig. 9 shows onset-to-diagnosis PDFs and CDFs for Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore and the lower graph displays the resultant SARS transmission rates for the Taiwan been a substantially lower rate of SARS transmission and a concomitant increase (decrease) in the maximum number of contagious individuals who were not (were) in hospital isolation. One parameter that accounts for the effectiveness of both contact tracing activities and medical surveillance is the proportion (u 2 ) of follow-on infections entering hospital isolation upon symptom onset. A reasonable estimate of u 2 for the Taiwan outbreak is 45/670, which appears in Table 2 and comes from published information on probable cases and quarantine. To assess how the Taiwan outbreak would have been altered by larger values of u 2 , the basic epidemic model is implemented with a single 'underlying' transmission rate. (See the red curve in the lower graph of Fig. 9 .) Calculated time histories of new infection rates and compartmental populations appear in Fig. 11 for four values of u 2 (45/670, 90/670, 135/670 and 180/670). Unsurprisingly, more effective contact tracing and medical surveillance could have substantially reduced the total number of infections and the total number of deaths. The proportion (u 1 ) of multiple initial infections entering hospital isolation upon symptom onset is another parameter dealing with contact tracing and medical surveillance. In the event of a single initial infection and a new emerging infectious disease, the prompt isolation of the index case-patient is unlikely and a null value of u 1 is appropriate. But multiple individuals who are simultaneously infected with a familiar pathogen would have different incubation periods and sufficient information may be at hand to promptly identify and isolate some of the index case-patients. The basic epidemic model with one underlying transmission rate is readily implemented for multiple initial infections and non-zero values of u 1 . Fig. 12 contains time histories of new infection rates and compartmental populations for 10 initial infections and three non-zero u 1 values (0.2, 0.4 and 0.6). In terms of the total number of infections and the total number of deaths, the potential benefits of quickly finding initially infected individuals are also large.
