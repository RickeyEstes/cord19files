3.1. PAH levels in the HW ashes PAH levels in the HW bottom ashes from the two different types of incinerators (HWI-I and HWI-II) are shown in Table 2 . The mean ∑PAH (16 US EPA priority PAHs) concentrations in (Lee et al., 2002; Wheatley and Sadhra, 2004) . Among the 16 PAHs, phenanthrene is the dominating PAH species in both HW bottom ashes, in the ranges of 13.9-29.9% and 19.5-22.3%, respectively. In addition, fluoranthene, pyrene and chrysene are also prevalent in most samples. An interesting result from Table 2 is that medium-scale incinerator (HWI-I) generated higher amount of PAHs than small-scale incinerator (HWI-II), i.e., 22.50 mg kg − 1 and 16.43 mg kg − 1 respectively. This could attribute to the operating conditions of this type incinerator, which are suitable for PAHs formation. For example, the operating temperature in HWI-I is generally below 800°C, while that in HWI-II is below 400°C. Therefore, medium-scale HW incinerators currently running in China may cause more serious environmental problems than small-scale ones. The levels of PAHs in the two types of HW fly ashes are significantly different (Table 3 ). The mean ∑PAH concentration contained in the fly ashes from HWI-III was 198.92 mg kg − 1 , about 50 times higher than that from HWI-IV (4.16 mg kg − 1 ). It was also much higher than those reported in literatures, i.e. 0 and 47.0 mg kg − 1 (Lee et al., 2002; Wheatley and Sadhra, 2004) . The prominent species in the two types of fly ashes are quite different. Nine PAH species tend to predominate in ash samples from HWI-III, i.e., benzo [g,h,i] perylene, fluoranthene, benzo [b] fluoranthene, pyrene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, phenanthrene, benzo[k]fluoranthese, chrysene and benzo[a]pyrene in descending order. While naphthalene is the most abundant species in samples from HWI-IV, the percentage of this species to total PAHs is in the range of 23.33% to 57.95%. These results indicate that fly ashes from medium-scale incinerators (HWI-III) contain much higher amounts of PAHs than from large-scale incinerators (HWI-IV). This could be partly attributed to the different exact operating temperatures of the two incinerators. Although the designed incineration temperatures were similar for the two types of incinerators (Table 1) , the real running temperatures in HWI-III were much lower than in HWI-IV because of the structural difference between the two incinerators. First, the color of the ash from HWI-IV was grey while that from HWI-III was black, indicating uncompleted burning in HWI-III. Second, the loss of on ignition (weight percent at 600°C for 3 h) of the two types of ashes were quite different, i.e. 20% for HWI-III ash and 3% respectively for HWI-III ash, indicating that HWI-IV ash contained much more unburned organic matter. On the other hand, HWI-III used activated carbon for acidic gases removal. Previous study (Zhou et al., 2005) showed that with increasing the concentration of activated carbon, the concentrations of PAHs in flue gas decreased apparently, while the concentration of PAHs in fly ash increased. Thus, injected activated carbon absorbing on ash particles contributed to the high level of PAHs in ash from HWI-III. Moreover, HWI-IV is a modern large-scale incinerator and operated at high temperature in the second combustion chamber, promoting the complete decomposition of PAHs. In addition, enough retention time (above 2 s) make the organic matters burn completely in this incinerator.
