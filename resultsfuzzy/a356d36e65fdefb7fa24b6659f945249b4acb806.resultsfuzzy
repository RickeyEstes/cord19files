Partial correlational analyses, controlling for gender, South Korean government credibility, and feelings toward MERS, revealed that all of the analysed variables have low level of correlations. The correlation value between rumor credibility and SNS social dependency (r = 0.047, p = ns), rumor credibility and accuracy-oriented seeking (r = 0.059, p = ns), SNS informational dependency and accuracy-oriented seeking (r = 0.108, p = ns) was not significant. Meanwhile, SNS informational dependency showed a significant relationship with SNS social dependency (r = 0.319, p < .001) and rumor credibility (r = 0.314, p < .001) at low levels. Table 1 Descriptive statistics for the demographic and other control variables (N = 297).  In order to examine the effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable and the interaction effects of SNS dependency, this study used hierarchal multiple regression from Step 1 through Step 3. We first entered gender, the South Korean government's credibility, and feelings toward MERS in Step 1. The independent variable and moderators were entered in Step 2. Then, the interactions were entered in Step 3. Before we tested for any interaction effects, the perceived credibility of rumors and the SNS dependency values were all mean-centered in order to reduce the variance inflation factor and consequently displayed no multicollinearity (Field, 2009) . The effect of rumor credibility and the moderating effects of SNS dependency on the accuracy-oriented information seeking were tested in order to examine RQ1, H1, and RQ2. All of the control variables were found to influence the accuracy-oriented information seeking (gender: β = −0.122, t = −2.074. p < .05; government credibility: β = 0.101, t = 1.774. p < .10; feelings: β = 0.329, t = 5.353. p < .001). The findings indicated that women were more likely than men to seek additional information with the aim of verifying the accuracy of the rumors. Additionally, people with strong beliefs in the government and more negative feelings toward the syndrome sought additional information to verify the accuracy of the rumors. RQ1 concerns whether the credibility of rumors would be associated with people's seeking additional information to verify the accuracy of the rumors. The results showed that rumor credibility did not affect accuracy-oriented information seeking (see Table 3 ). Then, we added regression results in Table 3 to ModGraph-I program Ver. 3.0 developed by Jose (2013) . As shown in the graph, the three straight lines represent different categories of SNS informational dependency (high, mid, low). Regarding H1 and RQ2, SNS informational dependency interacted with rumor credibility (β = 0.107, t = 1.915. p = .056). The P-value of the R 2 change in Step 3 was found to be marginally significant at the traditional 0.05 level, indicating that the moderators statistically affected the relationship between rumor credibility and the accuracy-oriented information seeking. However, SNS social dependency was not found to be a moderator in the accuracy-oriented information seeking. These findings partially supported H2. Fig. 2 presents how SNS informational dependency moderated the relationship between rumor credibility and the accuracyoriented information seeking. The lines depicted in the graph show that high levels of SNS informational dependency had a stronger effect on the positive relationship between rumor credibility and the accuracy-oriented information seeking than lower levels. The interaction indicates that users who depend on SNS for information were more affected by rumor credibility than participants who did not rely on SNS for information when finding accurate information regarding the MERS. For the respondents who did not use SNS Table 2 Partial correlation result for analysed variables.
