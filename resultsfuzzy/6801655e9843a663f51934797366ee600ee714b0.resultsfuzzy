According to the self-evaluation, 81% of 74 doctors and 94% of 876 nurses disinfected their hands before patient contact. The 741 patients who answered the questionnaire considered that 51% of doctors and 65% of the nurses always disinfected their hands before treating them. Basing on real life observations proper HD before patient contact was performed by doctors in 28% and by nurses in 61% of the occasions. The range of successfully performed HD in five moments was 28-42% (n = 2632 observations) for doctors and 61-66% (n = 14953 observations) for nurses, respectively. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Both doctors and nurses overestimate their HH practices. Patients consider HCWs' HH practices better than the real life observations. HCWs' especially doctors' hand hygiene practices needs improvement in our hospital. Results: Enterobacteriacease were responsible for 74% of positive blood cultures. Eschericia coli was the commonest individual organism (45%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (18%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.5%) Urinary tract was implicated as the source of bacteraemia in over half of our patients with gastrointestinal tractbeing the second commonest source. Among the Enterobacteriaceae over 90% of isolates were found to be sensitive to carbapenems, amikacin, colistin and fosfomycin. Over 70% of isolates were found to be sensitive to piperacillin/ tazobactam and gentamicin. Over 65% of isolates were sensitive to temocillin. Greater than 40% of isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. Resistance rates to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and amoxicillin were over 50%, 60%, 65% and 80% respectively. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): This study confirms findings previously described elsewhere regarding the common causative organisms and sources of bacteraemia among renal transplant recipients. This study demonstrates the growing problem of antibiotic resistance with almost fifty percent of isolates resistant to previously commonly used antibiotics (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ciprofloxacin) and gives us important information to inform empirical treatment for renal transplant patients presenting with sepsis. • 42/56 (75%) patients were reviewed by pharmacist • 83% (35/42) required some intervention • TTR of diarrhoea was 1.4 days shorter in the intervention group (5.9 vs 4.5 days) • LOS was 27.9 days in the pre-intervention group and 35 days in the intervention group. It was noted that both groups had discharges delayed for reasons other than CDI • For patients with recurrent CDI, TTR of diarrhoea was reduced by 6.6 days and length of stay decreased by 8.4 days • 30 day mortality reduced from 20% to 7%, although significance of this is unclear • Appropriate antimicrobial therapy within 72 hours increased from 88% to 100%. • PPI review documentation increased from 58% to 100%. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Appropriate antibiotic prescribing and PPI review demonstrate the quality benefits to patients, as well as improvement in TTR of diarrhoea. There are also organisational benefits: duration of isolation precautions can be reduced. As well as considerable reduction in TTR of symptoms in patients with recurrent CDI, earlier discharge was expedited, saving and estimated 56 bed days over 3 months. Overall, the evaluation supports the value of pharmacist management of CDI and led to permanent recruitment of the post. • Thirty-day all cause mortality rate was 20.6% • Higher mortality rate associated with male gender (p = 0.02); underlying hepatobiliary focus (p = 0.04); and resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate ( p = 0.06) • 25.0% resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate and ciprofloxacin • 10.3% of cases were ESBL E. coli • 61.8% of patients had one or more previous hospital admissions in the previous year; 20.6% had an intervention in the previous year, including biliary intervention (11.8%); and 88.2% had one or more comorbidities Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Results suggest that elderly male patients may have a higher risk of mortality from E. coli bacteraemia. There is need to further investigate the possible link between higher mortality and hepatobiliary source. High rate of resistance to commonly used antibiotics such as amoxicillin/clavulanate highlights the need to maintain use of appropriate antibiotics.
