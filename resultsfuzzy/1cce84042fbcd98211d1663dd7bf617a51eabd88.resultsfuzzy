The ordinary least squares estimates for Models 1 and 2 are presented in Table 2 . Since the model is static and the regressors are identical in equations, there is no gain from estimating the two equations together. Table 2 also reports Newey-West robust standard errors in order to account for a non-spherical distribution of the error term. 18 Both the labor force and the unemployment rate are powerful and significant predictors of RPMs (quantity), consistent with our a priori belief. A higher unemployment rate also reduces yields (prices), which is intuitive. 19 A larger labor force, however, also tends to reduce yields. This result is somewhat counterintuitive, and we expect that this is probably due to the fact that the labor force tends to be somewhat correlated with the growth of lowcost carriers. Since the reduced form estimates reflect the combined effects of the supply and demand, we caution the reader from drawing too many inferences from these estimates. However, if the estimates in both the quantity and price equation are significant and in the same direction for the same variable, we strongly suspect that it reflects a demand change. Conversely, if the price and quantity effect move in opposite directions, we suspect that it reflects a supply change. Consistent with the previous literature, LCCshare has a powerful positive impact on RPMs and a large negative effect on yield. The estimated coefficient on fuel is positive in the yield equation, but is not statistically significant. Fatalities showed almost no impact in either the quantity or price equation. We suspect that this may reflect a temporary substitution away from the carrier involved in the accident towards other carriers while leaving aggregate demand unchanged. This supports our conjecture that the September 11 attacks were unique in the sense that they resulted in a perceived increase in systematic (as opposed to idiosyncratic) risk. The recent Iraq War had a negative and significant impact on both domestic RPMs and yield, while the 1991 Gulf War did not. This result is likely a reflection of the fact that our analysis is limited to domestic travel, as the 1991 Gulf War had a strong negative impact on international traffic. Moreover, as noted by the NBER's business cycle dating committee, the downturn in the U.S. economy coincided almost exactly with the timing of the Gulf War variable. 20 Likewise, in light of the September 11 terrorist attacks, there was a heightened awareness of the possibility of additional terrorist attacks on domestic flights during the recent Iraq War. Finally, given that the recent Iraq War largely overlapped with the SARS epidemic, it is possible that the model cannot fully distinguish between these two events. Thus, the Iraq War coefficients likely reflect the combined effect of these two events. Turning our attention to the ongoing impact of September 11, we see that the estimated coefficients on β shift are powerfully negative (and significant at the 1% level) in both the RPMs and yield equations, suggesting a large demand contraction. The decline in RPMs is approximately 7.4% while the yield decline was 10.0%. The negative impacts on both the quantity (RPMs) and price (yields) indicate that 9/11 resulted in a negative demand shift, rather than a supply contraction. Moreover, the estimated effect of the ongoing demand shift remains almost the same even after we isolate the September 2001 observation from the remainder of the data in Model 2. Thus, these results do not appear to be the outcome of one influential observation. If we assume the estimated coefficients reflect a pure demand shift, which, as discussed earlier, is consistent with the simulta-neous decline in both quantity and price-the implied elasticity of the airline supply is 0.74. Given the limited number of observations after September 2001, it remains to be seen if this ongoing shift in demand is a permanent one. It is possible, for example, that we are observing a portion of a protracted non-linear response with long lags that have lasted more than 27 months. Such a protracted recovery, however, would also be unprecedented in the airline industry. For example, we applied our model to the 27 months following the invasion of Kuwait and subsequent 1991 Gulf War and found no evidence of a negative demand shift. We also tested to see if the ongoing shift had any attenuating tendency by inserting a linear time trend on post-September 2001 observations and allowing for a jackknife modification (the results are not reported in Table 2 ). The estimated time trends were extremely small and statistically insignificant while the other estimates remained mostly unchanged. This result suggests that the ongoing shift has no apparent tendency to narrow its gap within the observed time period. Finally, it is also important to note that we identify this ongoing shift separately from the transitory shock of September 11 and the estimation results also confirm that a substantial transitory shock was present. In Model 1, the estimated coefficient on β 1/t of −0.313 implies that the initial shock of September 11 resulted in a 31% reduction in RPMs (in addition to the 7.5% ongoing shift). Put differently, domestic RPMs reached a historical peak in August 2001 of approximately 46.0 billion miles and dropped precipitously to 24.7 billion miles in September 2001, then recovering to 31.4 billion miles in October 2001. The transitory shock to yields of 7.3% was significantly smaller than the corresponding shock to RPMs, which makes sense since many airline tickets are purchased well in advance. Under Model 1, the transitory impact of September 11 diminishes to less than a 1% reduction after 5 months (i.e., by February 2002) for RPMs and after 2 months (November 2002) for yields. Thus, the estimated coefficients on β shift apply mostly to the remaining 20 and 23 months of the RPM and yield data, respectively.
