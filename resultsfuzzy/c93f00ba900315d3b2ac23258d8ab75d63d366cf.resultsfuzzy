In sub-Saharan Africa, little information is available on the epidemiology of STEC in humans, food and animals, and current knowledge of STEC sources needs to be improved [12] . Data on the occurrence and the characteristics of STEC in African camels is limited. This study provides evidence for the fecal carriage of STEC among dromedary camels located on a ranch in Laikipia Kenya. The restriction to one farm in Kenya is a limitation of this study and may have led to bias associated with camels from one herd only. In order to obtain a wider picture, analyses of feces from camels on other farms and other regions in Kenya would be required. For this investigation, a total of 163 fecal swabs were obtained. Thereof, 53 (32.5%) tested positive for stx by real-time PCR. STEC was recovered from 20 of the stx positive samples, amounting to 12.3% of all fecal samples. Overall, fecal carriage of STEC was confirmed for 14.5% (17 of a total of 117) of the female camels and 6.7% (3 of 45) of the male camels ( Table 2) . The serotypes and virulence genotypes of the STEC isolates are summarized in Table 2 . The most frequent serotypes included nine (45% of the isolates) STEC O156:H25 isolates and three (15%) O43:H2 isolates. The remaining strains occurred as single serotypes or were O non-typeable (Table 2 ). STEC O156:H25 has been described as a persistent colonizer of the bovine gut [29] and has also been linked to human infection in Germany and Switzerland [30, 31] (Table 1) . By contrast, STEC O43:H2 is a rare serotype, but has been detected in beef in West Africa [32] . Further, various stx subtypes were detected among the isolates, including stx2a which is associated with severe disease in STEC infected humans [33] . The stx2a gene was found in a total of 11 (55%) of the isolates, including the nine STEC O156:H25 strains, and the STEC O8:H49 and STEC Ont:H7 isolates, respectively ( Table 2 ). The intimin gene eae was detected in nine (45%) isolates, all belonging to serotype O156:H25 (Table 2) . While eae is one of the most prominent virulence factors contributing to pathogenesis, many STEC feature other virulence genes that may enhance their pathogenic potential, such as enterohaemorrhagic E. coli haemolysin ehx [15, 30] . In this study, ehx was detected by PCR in fourteen (70%) of the isolates (Table 2) . Furthermore, we used WGS to provide additional information on the virulence of the analysed STEC. Table 2 shows the presence or absence of a selection of virulence genes that predict severe disease in humans, including espA, tccP, nleA, nleB and tir (de Boer et al., [16] ). Other virulence factors included in Table 2 are iss, which encodes an increased serum survival protein and is associated with non-bloody diarrhoea as well as extra-intestinal pathogenic infections [34] , subAB, which is an emerging pathogenic factor among eae negative human pathogenic STEC isolates [17] , and astA encoding a heat-stable enterotoxin EAST1 that is found mostly in enterohaemorrhagic and enteroaggregative E. coli [35] . The complete ARIES analysis reports on the virulotypes of the 20 sequenced strains are available upon request. Taken together, espA, tccP, nleA, nleB and tir were detected exclusively among the nine STEC O156:H25 isolates, while iss was identified in 16 (80%), and subAB in four (20%) of the isolates, respectively ( Table 2) . A minority of two strains (10%) possessed astA (Table 2) . Although all STEC can conceivably cause diarrhoea, the risk and severity of infection is linked to the presence of virulence factors, in particular stx2a and eae [12] . Our results show that although 45% of the STEC isolated from camel feces are not highly pathogenic according to their virulence factor profiles, the majority (55%) is associated with stx2a, and STEC O156:H25 isolates in particular, exhibit a virulotype that suggests a potential health risk. Using the Pasteur scheme, four different sequence types (ST) were identified among 14 isolates (Table 2 ). Using the Warwick scheme, 11 different STs were identified (Table 2) . Of the nine STEC O156:H25 isolates, eight grouped in the sequence type ST300 and ST5334, which (Table 2) . Accordingly, cgMLST using Ridom SeqSphere+ software divided the strains into distinct clusters that comprised the STEC O156:H25 isolates, the STEC O43:H2 isolates, and the Ont:H20 isolates, respectively, while the remaining strains did not reveal close phylogenetic relationship (Fig. 1) . Finally, all STEC isolates remained fully susceptible to all antimicrobials tested (data not shown).
