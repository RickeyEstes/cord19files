As briefly discussed, a major pathophysiological finding in all related syndromes that share overlapping clinical and pathogenic features with CFS, such as FM, IBS, chronic headache, and interstitial cystitis, is that these conditions are characterized by hyperalgesia and allodynia, both on experimental pain testing as well as functional neuroimaging. The authors of early studies typically used dolorimetry to assess pressure pain threshold and concluded that tenderness was in large part related to psychological factors because these measures of pain threshold were correlated with levels of distress [83] [84] [85] . To minimize the biases associated with "ascending" (ie, the individual knows that the pressure will be predictably increased) measures of pressure pain threshold, Petzke and colleagues [86] [87] [88] [89] performed a series of studies using more sophisticated paradigms, including random delivery of pressures. These studies showed that: (1) the random measures of pressure pain threshold were not influenced by levels of distress of the individual, whereas tender point count and dolorimetry examinations were; (2) patients with FM were much more sensitive to pressure even when these more sophisticated paradigms were used; (3) patients with FM were not any more "expectant" or "hypervigilant" than control patients; and (4) pressure pain thresholds at any 4 points in the body are highly correlated with the average tenderness at all 18 tender points and 4 "control points" (the thumbnail and forehead). In addition to the heightened sensitivity to pressure noted in FM, other types of stimuli applied to the skin are also judged as more painful or noxious by these patients, including heat [88, [90] [91] [92] , cold [91, 93] , and electrical stimuli [94] . These same findings of hyperalgesia and allodynia have been noted in most of the other conditions acknowledged to be part of this continuum, including CFS, IBS, TMJD, tension type headache, idiopathic low back pain, vulvodynia, and interstitial cystitis [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] . Brain imaging studies also demonstrate the existence of central pain augmentation in FM, IBS, low back pain, and several other conditions [100] [101] [102] . Finally, recent studies have suggested that FM and other chronic pain states are not just characterized by hyperresponsiveness to painful somatic or visceral stimuli but that they also exhibit a "left-shift" in noxiousness or unpleasantness of other sensory experiences, such as the brightness of light or loudness of auditory stimuli [103, 104] . Geisser and colleagues [105, 106] used an identical random staircase paradigm to test FM and CFS patients' threshold to the loudness of auditory tones and to pressure. They found that a measure of sensory sensitivity that combined stimulus:response results for both pressure pain and auditory unpleasantness was increased in both CFS and FM patients compared with controls, was independent of psychiatric status, and was strongly correlated with symptoms as well as functional status in both CFS and FM patients. The notion that FM and related syndromes might represent syndromes in which there is biological amplification of all sensory stimuli has significant support from functional imaging studies that suggest that the insula is one of the most consistently affected regions. This region has been noted to play a critical role in sensory integration, with the posterior insula serving a purer sensory role and the anterior insula associated with the emotional processing of sensations [107] [108] [109] . Because self-report of both central and peripheral fatigue are determined on the basis of the patient's "perception," it is conceivable that sensory amplification may be playing a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of CFS and may play a role in other fatigue states. No studies have directly assessed this hypothesis in CFS by demonstrating a similar "left-shift" in many stimulus:response functions, but nearly all studies that have examined the fatigue response to any single stimuli (eg, work performed on exercise or cognitive testing) have noted a similar left-shift to what has been observed with other sensory experiences throughout this spectrum of illness [25, 110] .
