In this section we report the results that we obtained by analyzing the empirical data which cover the first 33 years of the AIDS infection in Brazil. Specifically, we investigate the annual absolute frequency y i,t , defined as the number of new AIDS cases diagnosed in the year t at a given city i. It is valid noting that the System Data Registry of DATASUS hosts only mandatory cases of AIDS reported by health professionals to health services. Therefore, the number of HIV positive patients was not available in DATASUS until 2012, but only the number of AIDS cases. Altogether, we analyze data ranging from 1980 up to 2012 of 5138 Brazilian cities with at least one AIDS case in the aforementioned period. Up to the end of 2012, the infection had already reached more than 5000 cities (,90% of the Brazilian cities). We start with an overview of the spatial spreading of the virus. Next, we focus on the temporal evolution of the infection in Brazilian cities.
