There was no statistical difference in gender ( p ϭ 0.824) or median age ( p ϭ 0.052) between the group of control cats and the group of cats with cardiomyopathy. There was no statistical difference ( p ϭ 0.601) in median age between: cats that were PCR positive for panleukopenia virus genome with myocarditis (6.5 years) or without myocarditis (9 years); cats that were PCR negative with myocarditis (9.5 years); and cats that were PCR negative without myocarditis (5.7 years). There was a statistically significant associa-tion ( p ϭ 0.003) between the presence or absence of myocarditis and PCR status of panleukopenia viral genome.
