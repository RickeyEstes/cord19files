Using this mobile system we have so far performed HVMA tests in 203 subjects in 14 different pediatric pulmonology centers throughout the country. With an approximate 20 minutes testing time per patient, from brushing to complete analysis of the ciliary beating pattern, we were able test 10-15 subjects per day. Apart from individual transport time to each center location, it took another hour to reassemble and disassemble the system in each location. Failure to obtain epithelial cells was infrequently observed on initial testing and gradually disappeared later on. Although not formally assessed, we have noticed decreased variability and increased expertise in both brushing and video analysis over time. Altogether, approximately 1500 video clips were analyzed. Six subjects had no adequate samples and/or no video recording. In another 49 subjects, a HVMA result was determined to be "cannot be assessed". An HVMA result was made in 148 out of 203 (73%) subjects. The results of HVMA are depicted in Table 1 , Figure 3 (on site results in all subjects) and Figure 4 (post hoc results in PCD patients). Although the HVMA categories were different between the initial on-site assessment (3 general categories) and the post-hoc assessment (7 specific categories), there was a high degree of agreement between the two, with only 6 subjects whose final posthoc results were not within the initial on-site general categories. PCD was confirmed in 112 subjects. Detailed results of HVMA of these 112 PCD patients (which were diagnosed in our study according to the previous definition), are depicted in Table 1 and Figure 4 . The sensitivity of on-site abnormal HVMA (index test) to accurately predict PCD (defined as at least 2 abnormal reference tests out of 4) was 90.5%. It was not different from the post-hoc HVMA sensitivity (90.2%). Although no diagnosis of PCD was made on-site, inviting the parents, primary physician and/or the patient to view the video on-site within minutes after the brushing was highly appreciated and rewarding for many of them.
