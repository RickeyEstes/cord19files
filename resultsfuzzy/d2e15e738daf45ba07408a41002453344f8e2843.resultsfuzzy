During the extension phase of PCR the probe is cleaved by 5Ј exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase thereby releasing the reporter from the quencher and producing an increase in reporter emission intensity which can detected and quantified. As amplification continues, the amount of reporter dye signal measured is proportional to the amount of PCR product made. recently routine screening of emergency department patients considered at risk for sexually transmitted diseases. 59, 60 Although studies in the acute-care settings have not yet used PCR assays for C trachomatis on site and in real time (thus not taking full advantage of the speed of PCR), routine use of this assay in the aforementioned studies has resulted in nearly three-fold greater rates of disease detection and treatment relative to standard care. Distinguishing life-threatening causes of fever from more benign causes in children is a fundamental clinical dilemma faced by clinicians, especially when infections of the central nervous system are being considered. Bacterial causes of meningitis can be highly aggressive but generally cannot be differentiated on a clinical basis from aseptic meningitis, a benign condition generally appropriate for outpatient management. 61 Culture methods often take several days to show positive results and are confounded by poor sensitivity or false-negative findings in patients receiving empiric antimicrobials. 62 One well developed assay, which has the potential to influence the management of patients in the acute-care setting, allows early and rapid diagnosis of diseases of viral cause. Testing and application of a PCR assay for enteroviral meningitis has been seen to be highly sensitive. 63, 64 With reporting of results within 1 day, preliminary clinical trials have shown significant decreases in hospital costs due to decreased duration of hospital stays and courses of antibiotic therapy. 65, 66 Other viral PCR assays, now routinely available, include those for herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis viruses, and HIV. 67 Each has a proven cost-saving role in clinical practice, including detection of otherwise difficult to diagnose infections, and a newly realised capacity to monitor progression of disease and response to therapy, vital to the management of chronic infectious diseases. 68 With the increasing number of genomes of infectious pathogens being sequenced, catalogues of genes can be exploited to serve as amplification targets. As a result, the number of PCR assays developed both commercially and in-house continues to expand. 


Section:figure 2. real-time pcr using taqman probe. taqman probe is a single-stranded oligonucleotide that is labelled with two different fluorescent dyes. on the 5ј terminus is a reporter dye and on the 3ј terminus is a quenching dye. this oligonucleotide probe sequence is homologous to an internal target sequence present in the pcr amplified product. when the probe is intact, the proximity of the two fluorescent dyes results in quenching of the reporter dye emission by the quencher dye.
