The hits per category were sorted according to descending BLOSUM scores. From the 14 inflammatory categories, defined as instances where epitopes were less similar than non-epitopes to the microbiome, the top ten hits for each category were selected for analysis. In the case of nine tolerogenic categories, defined as instances where epitopes were more similar than non-epitopes to the microbiome, the top ten hits from their respective epitope sets were likewise also selected, as non-epitopes will inherently produce negative results in immunogenicity assays. Hits from the Rheumatoid Arthritis tolerogenic category were not included in this analysis because too few hits were available. The set of peptides selected for experimental testing can be found in S5 Table for the epitopes derived from the "tolerogenic" categories and in S6 Table for the epitopes derived from "inflammatory" categories. Since ten high BLOSUM peptide hits were selected for each of the 23 categories, this corresponded to a total of 230 human microbiome peptides. A third set of peptides (S7 Table) was derived from naturally processed HLA class II peptides recorded in the IEDB (n = 3231). These were predicted for binding using the previously described 7-allele method [24] and peptides not predicted to bind below the threshold of at least 20 th percentile were excluded (979 peptides were predicted as binders). Similarity to the microbiome was estimated by BLOSUM score calculations as described above. Peptides were purchased from Mimotopes (Clayton, Victoria, Australia) and/or A and A (San Diego, CA) as crude material on a small (1 mg) scale. Individual peptides were resuspended in DMSO to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml. Peptides were pooled (10 peptides per pool) according to their category. Each pool was at a final concentration of 2mg/ml per peptide.
