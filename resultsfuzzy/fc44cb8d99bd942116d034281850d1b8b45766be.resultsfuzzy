An SEQIHRS epidemic model for the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease is proposed and rigorous mathematical analysis is carried out to get insight into the qualitative dynamics in presence of pre-existing immunity and the use of NPIs stimulated by media coverage. The main mathematical and epidemiological findings of the proposed model presented in this article are as follows: (i) The model (2)-(7) has a locally-asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium whenever the associated effective reproduction number is less than unity (Theorem 3.1). Moreover, if the disease-induced death rates are neglected then the DFE is globally-asymptotically stable (Theorem 3.4). (ii) The model has a unique endemic equilibrium whenever the effective reproduction number exceeds unity and then EE is locally asymptotically stable (Theorems 3.2 and 3.3). (iii) The presence of pre-existing immunity (ξ) in the population has significant impact on the transmission dynamics of the disease. Higher level of pre-existing immunity in the population decreases the infection peak and causes its early arrival. (iv) The coefficients of media awareness m 1 and m 2 do not affect the effective reproduction number R C . Hence, it does not change the qualitative behavior of the model, but it helps to mitigate disease burden by lowering the level of infection over time. (v) The use of quarantine and/or isolation could have positive, no or negative population level impact depending on the relative infectiousness of isolated individuals (η). (vi) Since disease transmission is directly related to the effective reproduction number, and the disease prevalence is directly related to the endemic equilibrium point Ē , specifically to the magnitude of I * , therefore normalized forward sensitivity indices of the effective reproduction number and I * will be helpful to determine decisive parameter(s) for containing the infectious disease. Sensitivity indices of the effective reproduction number and I * are calculated and highly sensitive parameters are discovered.
