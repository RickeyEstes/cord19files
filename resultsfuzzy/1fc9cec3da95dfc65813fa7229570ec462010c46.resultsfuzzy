The association of positive tests vs negative test results on utilization of healthcare resources is shown (Table VI) . Subjects with positive tests in both the mPCR and non-mPCR groups received less antibiotics, but more chest radiographs. In the mPCR group, a higher proportion of subjects with positive test results were placed on isolation for $2 days, and in the non-mPCR group there was no difference in this variable between those with positive vs negative test results.
