We also found that the most strongly regulated genes upon filovirus infection are chemokine ligands and transcription factors. We observed a strong induction of the JAK/STAT pathway, of several genes encoding inhibitors of MAP kinases (DUSP genes) and of PPP1R15A, which is involved in ER stressinduced cell death. We used comparative transcriptomics to provide a data resource that can be used to identify cellular responses that might allow bats to survive filovirus infections. An Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa of unprecedented severity resulted in over 28,600 cases and 11,300 deaths as of April 2016 (http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/previous-case-counts. html). EBOV and Marburg virus (MARV) are closely related filoviruses, with a nucleotide identity of 49.5%. They contain single-stranded RNA genomes with a negative orientation that are approximately 19 kb in size and encode seven structural proteins 1 . The natural hosts of filoviruses are presumed to be bats 2 , which may be the origin of the recent EBOV outbreak in West Africa 3 . Rousettus aegyptiacus is the natural reservoir of MARV [4] [5] [6] , and it survives MARV infections without any signs of the disease 7, 8 . However, humans with filovirus infections experience a severe fever and vascular leakage, with high fatality rates 9 . Surprisingly little is known about the response of human cells to EBOV and MARV infections, and the response in bat cells has not been investigated at all. Barrenas et al. 10 used a next-generation sequencing approach to understand the cellular immune response of vaccinated cynomolgus macaques after an EBOV challenge. Microarray-based studies have described the differential expression of several known cellular genes after EBOV infections in mice and rhesus monkeys [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, the overall response of human and bat cells to filovirus infections is not yet known. Key proteins in the infection process and their regulatory circuits have not been defined, and the transcriptional landscape of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and alternative mRNA isoforms is unexplored. Cellular targets are an attractive alternative for the development of antiviral drugs because viruses cannot adapt to a change in the host cell as easily as they can develop a resistance to an antiviral drug over the course of treatment 15, 16 . To establish effective antiviral strategies, it is necessary to understand how the infected cells respond to filovirus infections and how this response differs between bats and humans. We explored the cellular regulatory response mechanisms by sequencing the full transcriptomes of immortalized cells of human and bat origin at three different time points post infection (p.i.). We constructed a full de novo transcriptome assembly (see Materials and Methods) based on the RNA-Seq data of R. aegyptiacus. Here, we provide a systematic report on (1) a genome-wide analysis of EBOV, MARV, human, and bat transcripts, as well as (2) single genes that show strong differential regulation, (3) the regulatory transcription factors, and (4) the corresponding pathways that are involved in the response to EBOV and MARV infections. We focus on the transcriptional differences and similarities between EBOV-and MARV-infected human and bat cells. Differences in early viral replication velocities. By comparing viral RNA levels in HuH7 and R06E-J cells, we determined that EBOV and MARV replicate more rapidly in HuH7 than in R06E-J cells between 3 and 7 h p.i. RNA synthesis slowed down in both species in the subsequent 16 h (Fig. 3) , and transcript levels were nearly identical at 23 h p.i. (Table S2 ). The EBOV and MARV viral proteins were more abundant in HuH7 than in R06E-J cells at 7 h p.i. and were present at similar levels at 23 h p.i. (Fig. 1C,D) as determined using IFAs. Early increases in the levels of viral RNA and proteins in HuH7 cells may be attributed to a faster rate of early replication of filoviruses in HuH7 cells compared to the rate in R06E-J cells. The differences in replication velocities may contribute to the different susceptibilities of HuH7 cells and R06E-J cells to filovirus infection. However, it does not explain which differences in the cellular regulatory response mechanisms are responsible for the higher RNA synthesis rate in HuH7 cells. We observed few regulatory effects at 3 and 7 h p.i. However, more than 1,670 genes were up-or down-regulated at 23 h p.i. in EBOV-infected HuH7 cells, whereas only 74 genes showed altered expression patterns in MARV-infected samples (Fig. 4A) . Chemokine ligands (CXCL1 and CXCL5), transcription factors (e.g., FOSL1, FOS, FOSB, ATF3), and genes with diverse functions (e.g., PPP1R15A, dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs)) were among the 55 genes that were most strongly regulated after filovirus infections in HuH7 cells (log 2 FC > 5, Figure ES2A ). This finding is supported by previous reports 11, 14 . Each gene can be viewed along with all relevant details at our webtool: www.rna.uni-jena.de/supplements/filovirus_human_bat/igo.php. Differential expression of 2,500 genes. We aimed to answer three questions based on gene transcription levels: (1) What happens during filovirus infections in the host? (2) What are the differences in host-cell responses between EBOV and MARV infections? (3) What are the differences in how HuH7 and R06E-J cells respond after EBOV and MARV infections? Over 2,500 differentially expressed genes were found to be involved in the response to filovirus infections (Tables S4-S10). The most significant differentially expressed genes during the course of both EBOV and MARV infections between HuH7 and R06E-J cells include genes for transcription factors that regulate the expression of kinases and their antagonists and genes involved in ubiquitination processes (Fig. 4B) . Although we confirmed the previously reported dysregulation of genes involved in coagulation 11, 12, 14 , these were not among the most differentially expressed genes. With the exception of a few genes, we confirmed previously observed data based on microarray analyses of EBOV-infected HuH7 cells 12 , human macrophages 14 rhesus monkey cells 13 , and mouse cells 11 . Regulation of transcription factors. Many transcription factors were found to be among the most differentially expressed genes. Therefore, we assume that they play an important role in the changes observed after filoviral infection. To identify the regulatory factors that are responsible for the observed transcriptional changes after filoviral infection in HuH7 cells, we performed motif activity response analyses with MARA 47 . MARA infers the regulatory impact (also called activity) of a regulatory motif from the changes in expression of the predicted downstream genes (targets) of that motif. For a curated collection of ~190 mammalian transcription factor binding motifs and ~90 miRNA seed families, we found 76 and 38 motifs with a change in activity (z-value > 1.5) aegyptiacus genome or transcriptome assembly are marked with a star. We identified homologous locations (LOC107508087, LOC107515336, LOC107498547) for three genes that were not directly annotated in the R. aegyptiacus genome (EP300, RPS17L, MX1). These locations were identified using our de novo transcriptome assembly (red boxes). We indicated the molecular function of each gene based on the color scheme presented in (D). (C) Highly regulated genes in EBOV-and MARV-infected HuH7 and R06E-J cells. FC -log 2 -fold change based on DESeq normalized read counts. See Supplement (Tables S5 and S6 ) and corresponding entries for detailed information. (D) The PANTHER database (v11.0) 96 was used to assign molecular functions to each of the 64 genes in (B) We further subdivided the dominant group of genes that we identified to have a general binding function. During filovirus infections, the most prominent regulatory effects were observed for genes encoding transcription factors, those regulating the NFκB and MAPK pathways, their DUSP inhibitors and growth factors ( Figure ES2A and Tables S5 and S6, full tables in the electronic supplement). In addition, changes were also observed for genes that regulate protein translation (RPS17, PPP1R15A), ubiquitination (TRAF6, SQSTM1), autophagocytosis (SQSTM1) and cation transport (CHAC1, ATP2B4). We also observed the strong upregulation of genes that are involved in energy transfer (e.g., RASGEF1B). Details can be found in Tables S5-S8. Scientific RepoRts | 6:34589 | DOI: 10.1038/srep34589 in response to EBOV and MARV infections, respectively (see electronic supplement, Section ES5). Genes that are regulated by such motifs are involved in NFκB signaling or cell-cycle regulation (Fig. 5) . Interestingly, we found that the FOS/JUN -motif has significantly increased activity after both EBOV and MARV infections. This result indicates that genes having FOS/JUN -motif binding sites in their promoter region are primarily up-regulated (Fig. 5) . Consistent with this, transcription factors that are associated with this motif (e.g., FOSB) were up-regulated in infected cells (Fig. 4B) . The transcription factor AP1, a homo or heterodimer of differentially expressed FOS and JUN, plays important roles in different viral infections 48, 49 . Other motifs, such as the KLF12-and the NRF1-associated motifs (Fig. 5) , are more specific to EBOV and MARV, respectively, reflecting the differences in the impacts of theses two viruses on the transcriptional landscape of infected cells. In summary, we found various motifs, including the antiviral signaling-associated motif for NFκB, to have significant changes in activity (Fig. 5) . For each motif, we provide associated regulators and target genes (Section ES5). The antiviral mRNA response is mostly unchanged. Unexpectedly, apart from the effect on transcription factors, the majority of genes and pathways that are relevant for viral infections did not demonstrate significant regulatory changes in response to filoviral infection (Section ES6). The majority of genes involved in innate immune responses (from Kuri et al. 50 ) were either not expressed in the human cell cultures examined here or were only slightly differentially regulated during infection (Table S11) . Consistent with this observation, some of these genes (e.g., IFITM1/2, OAS1-3) are not included in our bat transcriptome assembly, suggesting they were not transcribed. However, we did observe significantly different RNA levels for several bat homologs of innate immune response genes in filovirus-infected R06E-J cells in comparison with their levels in HuH7 cells. For example, DDX58 and ADAR demonstrated lower, and NMI higher, expression levels in EBOV-infected R06E-J cells (Table S11 ). The differences in the mRNA concentrations of these transcripts in infected HuH7 and R06E-J cells may play a role in the defense mechanisms that are active during filovirus infections. Genes encoding for proteins initiating pathways known to respond to viral infections, such as DDX58 ( Figure ES6.8) , NFκB ( Figures  ES6.10 and ES6.17) , and MAPK pathways ( Figures ES6.2-6.7) , were not induced during filovirus infections in our study. Only those genes of the examined pathways that encode proteins that act as key players (see Fig. 4B ,C) were up-regulated in EBOV-infected HuH7 cells relative to their expression in R06E-J cells. The Ebola viral protein VP35 inhibits DDX58 signaling, which determines the outcome of infection in human cells [51] [52] [53] . We inspected the DDX58 pathway, which induces ISRE3, AP1 (FOS and JUN), NFκB and interferon β activation in cells 54, 55 (Figure ES6.8) . Although we observed differences between HuH7 and R06E-J cells in the levels of DDX58 and ISYNA1 mRNA, all but one gene (IKKε) related to the DDX58 pathway were expressed, but they were not differentially affected. We noted an up-regulation of the FOS (38X) and JUN (9X) genes in EBOV-infected HuH7 cells 23 h p.i. (Fig. 4B) . We observed no significant change in the genes specific to the DDX58 pathway at the transcriptomic level. We therefore assume that regulation of the DDX58 pathway at the transcriptomic level is not a driving factor leading to the frequent fatalities observed in humans, which are not observed in bats, subsequent to filoviral infection. We investigated the relationship of the DDX58 protein to other proteins at the mRNA level, such as TRIM25, which interacts with the DDX58 pathway 56 . TRIM-family proteins are induced by interferons and are involved in antiviral cellular responses 57 . We found that several members of the TRIM-family were up-regulated in EBOV-infected cells between 3-7 h p.i. but were down-regulated from 7-23 h p.i. (Table S12 ). The corresponding bat homologs were either not expressed (e.g., TRIM71) or were not significantly differentially expressed between R06E-J and HuH7 cells (e.g., TRIM25). In line with previous reports 58 , our results show that filoviruses neither induce nor block apoptosis ( Figure  ES6 .33), as genes involved in apoptosis were not significantly regulated during EBOV or MARV infections, with the exception of BBC3, which was up-regulated 9.6X in EBOV-infected HuH7 cells. However, it is important to note that both cell lines were immortalized, which may explain the minimal effects on genes involved in apoptosis. 


Section:filoviruses, the ebola and marburg viruses, result in a severe and often fatal infection in humans. however, bats are natural hosts and survive filovirus infections without obvious symptoms. the molecular basis of this striking difference in the response to filovirus infections is not well understood. we report a systematic overview of differentially expressed genes, activity motifs and pathways in human and bat cells infected with the ebola and marburg viruses, and we demonstrate that the replication of filoviruses is more rapid in human cells than in bat cells.
