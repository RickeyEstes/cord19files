For this study, the receptor binding specificity of several virus strains that were used as reference viruses were confirmed by virus binding assays. The reference viruses were as follows: A/Suita/117/ 2011 (Suita/117), a human H1N1 strain; A/Japan/434/2003 (Japan/434), a human H3N2 strain; EG/D1 and recombinant rEG/D1 virus, bird H5N1 strains; and rEG/D1 Q192H and rEG/D 128Δ/I151T , mutant rEG/D1 viruses with enhanced human-type receptor specificity. Previous studies reported that HA Q192H and 128Δ/I151T mutations increased viral binding affinity for α2,6 Sia (Watanabe et al., 2011) . Therefore, rEG/D1 Q192H and rEG/D1 128Δ/I151T were generated by introducing the Q192H and 128Δ/I151T mutations into EG/D1 HA to produce representative interphyletic viruses for this study. The virus binding assays showed that Suita/117 and Japan/434 had binding specificity for α2,6 Sia ( Fig. 2A and B) . In contrast, EG/D1 and rEG/D1 had binding specificity for α2,3 Sia ( Fig. 2C and D) . Interphyletic viruses rEG/D1 Q192H and rEG/D1 128Δ/I151T had significantly increased binding to α2,6 Sia, with binding to both α2,3 Sia and α2,6 Sia ( Fig. 2E and F) . The binding curves of these viruses were typical Sia binding specificity profiles for human viruses, bird viruses, and interphyletic viruses, respectively (Boltz et al., 2010; Watanabe et al., 2011; Yamada et al., 2006) . We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the strip test by investigating the reactivity of 8-512 HAU of the reference viruses to α2,3 Sia and α2,6 Sia. Suita/117 gave clear red test lines on α2,6 Sia strips for virus titers of 32-512 HAU (Fig. 3A) . However, even at the highest titer, 512 HAU, Suita/117 produced no visible blue test line on the α2,3 Sia strip, indicating human-type receptor specificity. Japan/434, which is classified as a group 2 influenza A virus, produced no visible test lines on either α2,6 Sia or α2,3 Sia strips (Fig. 3B) . These results showed that the visible test lines produced on the test strips were the result of specific C179 binding to group 1 influenza HAs. In contrast, EG/D1 gave clear blue test lines on α2,3 Sia test strips when the virus titer was 32-512 HAU (Fig. 3C) . However, even the highest EG/D1 titer, 512 HAU, produced no visible red test line on α2,6 Sia strips, showing bird-type receptor specificity. To further assess the receptor specificity of H5N1 viruses that were circulating in geographical areas other than Egypt, we tested A/ chicken/Soc Trang/5/2013 and A/tree sparrow/Indonesia/D10013/ 2010, which were typical bird-type H5N1 viruses isolated in Viet Nam and Indonesia, respectively. These two viruses produced blue test lines only on α2,3 Sia strips, with the same sensitivity ( Fig. 3D and E). These results showed that the test strips consistently detected the receptor binding specificity of group 1 influenza viruses. The reactivity of the test strips to the interphyletic viruses with titers of 32-256 HAU was then evaluated. Both rEG/D1 Q192H and rEG/D1 128Δ/I151T produced clear blue test lines on α2,3 Sia strips at all virus titers tested ( Fig. 3G and H) . In addition, 128-256 HAU of these viruses produced visible red test lines on α2,6 Sia strips, in contrast to the results with the parental rEG/D1 virus (Fig. 3F) . These results showed that the test strips were able to detect human-type receptor binding by interphyletic viruses at higher titers (4 128 HAU). Based on these results, we used virus isolates with titers of 128-512 HAU for further studies. Band intensities on the test strips were quantified by densitometry and plotted as a function of virus titer. The results showe d that the intensity profiles ( Fig. 4A -F) were similar to the virus binding assay results ( Fig. 2A-F) . Scatter plots showed that an increase in band intensity was strongly correlated with binding affinity on both α2,3 Sia (R ¼0.966, Fig. 4G ) and α2,6 Sia strips (R ¼0.957, Fig. 4H ), indicating that the results obtained with the test strips and by binding assays were highly correlated. Therefore, the test strips produced a semi-quantitative measure of viral receptor binding affinity. A long-term storage test was then performed to evaluate the stability and reproducibility of the strip test. Investigations using the same batch of test strips showed that the test strips were stable for at least 12 months at 4°C without any changes in sensitivity or specificity (Table S2) . To verify the potential applicability of the test strip, the HA receptor specificity of 63 influenza virus strains that had been isolated in the several geographical areas were examined. The results showed that 4 strains that were classified as Egyptian clade 2.2.1 sublineage A/B viruses had dual binding affinity to both α2,3 Sia and α2,6 Sia, indicating that they were interphyletic viruses ( Fig. 5 and Table 1 ). This was in agreement with the previous report that sublineage A/B viruses have generally acquired an increased human-type receptor binding affinity (Watanabe et al., 2011) . In contrast, all the H5N1 strains that were isolated in Viet Nam and Indonesia showed typical bird-type receptor specificity. Several variant-type strains with increased α2,6 Sia binding affinity have been reported in some Asian countries (Auewarakul et al., 2007; Boltz et al., 2010) . However, acquisition of human-type receptor affinity by Asian H5N1 viruses seemed to be strain-specific, which may explain why the Asian H5N1 viruses tested in this study did not show dual receptor specificity. Further evaluation of the test strips using larger numbers of Asian H5N1 strains may detect interphyletic viruses in these areas. In this study, two H5N1 virus strains produced no visible test lines on either α2,3 Sia or α2,6 Sia test strips (Table 1) , even though the titers of these viruses were 4 128 HAU. Epidemiological studies have reported a few exceptional virus strains that recognized distinct sialylglycan topologies (Xiong et al., 2013) . Thus, these two viruses may have such an exceptional receptor binding specificity. However, these viruses may not have bound the C179 antibody due to amino acid change(s) at the antigen epitope in the HA stem region. Further genetic analyses and characterization of these two viruses are needed to elucidate the reason(s) why these viruses did not produce bands on the test strips.
