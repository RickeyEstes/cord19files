Antibody Titers and Opioid Affinities. Mice were immunized with our first generation heroin vaccine (heroin− KLH conjugate formulated with alum adjuvant), and antibody titers were measured by ELISA against heroin−BSA conjugate. A significant effect of the vaccines on antibody titers was observed [IgG1, F 2,24 = 7.2, p < 0.01; IgG2a, F 2,23 = 4.8, p < 0.01]. Ip and ip/sc administration of the heroin vaccine gave nearly identical titers, which were 5-fold higher compared to sc injection (Table 1) . On top of a significant effect of ip administration routes compared to sc, the addition of CpG ODN 1826 further increased titers 6-fold compared to alum alone (p < 0.05, Fisher's tests). Based upon competitive ELISA data, the ip group exhibited the poorest overall opioid affinities, although the ip/sc group 6AM affinity was weakest of all the groups (Table 1 ). In contrast, affinities for heroin, 6AM, and morphine were 2−4fold better in the sc group. When CpG ODN 1826 was added to our existing formulation, affinities improved 27-fold for heroin, 9-fold for 6AM, and 12-fold for morphine. Statistical comparisons were not performed because affinities were determined from pooled sera. To assess Th1 and Th2-associated humoral responses, we compared titers of anti-heroin IgG2a and IgG1, respectively. As shown previously, our heroin vaccine exhibits an exclusively Th2 immune response. 21 However, addition of CpG ODN in the current study elicited a robust Th1 humoral response as indicated by the 27-fold increase in IgG2a titers (Table 1 ; p < 0.05). Furthermore, CpG ODN enhanced the Th2-associated humoral response by boosting IgG1 titers 4-fold over alum alone (p < 0.05). Antinociceptive Testing. To assess vaccine performance in blocking the analgesic effects of heroin, vaccinated animals were subjected to two antinociceptive tests, hot plate and tail immersion. Full dose−response curves and corresponding ED 50 values were generated to thoroughly test vaccine efficacy in a wide range of heroin doses, then repeated for selectivity against morphine and oxycodone. Results in the behavioral tests generally paralleled ELISA results. The vaccines showed varying degrees of shifting the heroin antinociceptive dose−response to the right, with tail immersion being more responsive to the vaccines (Figure 2) . A significant effect of vaccination was observed based on the derived estimates of heroin's Table  2 . (Table 2 ; Tukey's test). Ip and ip/sc performances were fairly similar to one another and gave ED 50 values that were 7−10-fold better than those of naive animals (p < 0.01). Addition of CpG ODN 1826 increased ED 50 values by 5-fold in hot plate (p < 0.01) and 2− 5-fold in tail immersion (p < 0.01) over alum alone. Similar antinociceptive testing was conducted for morphine as that for heroin, and a significant vaccination ANOVA was determined [hot plate, F 4,115 = 6.4, p < 0.001; tail immersion, F 4,135 = 10.9, p < 0.001]. Similar to previous findings, our original vaccine formulation is primarily more effective on heroin than morphine. No significant shift of morphine potency was found compared to naive, regardless of route of administration (Table S1 in the Supporting Information). However, the addition of the CpG ODN 1826 provided sufficient boosts in titer and affinity to generate a significant reduction in morphine potency, though only in the tail immersion test (p < 0.001). As expected, and in confirmation of the selectivity of the vaccine for heroin and its primary metabolites, no heroin vaccine treatment provided protection against oxycodone, a structurally similar opioid (Table S2 in the  Supporting Information) .
