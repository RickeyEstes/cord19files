3. Pg 7: The presentation of the Zika envelope protein structure is very poor. Authors should explain that it is composed of an ectodomain, consisting of three domains (I, II and III), and stem and transmembrane regions. They could cite the reference of Sirohi et al, Science 2016, which investigated the structure of the virus. Such explanation could perhaps be inserted in the introduction section and in results or materials and methods authors could indicate which part was deleted in truncate E proteins. Did they remove all stem and transmembrane regions?
