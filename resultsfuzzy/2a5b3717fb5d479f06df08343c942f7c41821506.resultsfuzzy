All numerical simulations of the system (3) are done taking the parameters values of Table 1 . Effects of variation of allochthonous inputs A as well as infection rate d are Table 1 ) are shown. investigated numerically. Numerical simulations are done using MATLAB 7.8.0 (R2009a). We first numerically calculate the initial intermediate predator population p 10 (using Theorem 3.1) for extinction of infected prey using the set of parameter values of Table 1 with the variation of allochthonous inputs A for different infection rate d. From Fig. 2 , we observe that the system (3) becomes disease free above the critical p 10 and disease free region is decreasing with the increase of infection rate. We observe that there is a threshold value of initial intermediate predator population for eradication of infected prey. Intermediate population size should be greater than the threshold value for extinction of infected prey. The threshold population size increases monotonically with the increase of infection rate. The phase trajectories of the system (3) around predator free equilibrium point E 2 are shown in Fig. 3 with initial populations I 1 ¼ ð1:6; 1; 0; 0Þ (black line), I 2 ¼ ð1:1; 0:5; 0; 0Þ (green line), I 3 ¼ ð1:5; 0:9; 0; 0Þ (red line), I 4 ¼ ð1:3; 0:6; 0; 0Þ (magenta line) and I 5 ¼ ð1:9; 1:3; 0; 0Þ (blue line). The system (3) is stable at equilibrium points E 2 ð s; i; 0; 0Þ ¼ ð0:1111; 0:9877; 0; 0Þ for d ¼ 0:9; A ¼ 0:2 ( Fig. 3(a) ), E 2 ð s; i; 0; 0Þ ¼ ð0:0625; 0:5859; 0; 0Þ for d ¼ 1:6; A ¼ 0:5 ( Fig. 3(b) ) and E 2 ð s; i; 0; 0Þ ¼ ð0:0385; 0:3698; 0; 0Þ for d ¼ 2:6; A ¼ 0:7 (Fig. 3(c) ). The local stability of disease free equilibrium point E 3 with initial population (1.3,0,0.5,0.1) Table 1 ) are plotted. It shows that infected prey extincts for 0 6 d < 0:62 and survived for d P 0:62. is presented in Fig. 4. From Fig. 4 , it is evident that the system (3) has a stable limit cycle around disease free equilibrium point (0.9102, 0, 0.1562, 0.6862) for d ¼ 1:9; A ¼ 0:6 ( Fig. 4(a) ) and there is a stable limit cycle around the equilibrium point (0.9071, 0, 0.1562, 0.6816) for d ¼ 1:9; A ¼ 0:6 ( Fig. 4(b) ). The numerical bifurcation results are presented here for random initial conditions, which are lie on positive quadrant. One parameter bifurcation diagrams of the system (3) with respect to infection rate are presented in Fig. 5 in absence of allochthonous inputs (A ¼ 0). It is clear from Fig. 5 that the species extinction is possible at higher infection rate in absence of allochthonous inputs. The system become disease free naturally at low infection rate but with the increases of infection rate (after d P 0:62) infected prey population increases in absence of allochthonous inputs. Bifurcation diagrams of the system (3) with respect to d 2 ½0; 2 in presence of allochthonous inputs (A) are presented in Fig. 6 . It is evident from Fig. 6 that in presence of allochthonous inputs (A ¼ 0:576) the system becomes disease free for 0 6 d P 0:65, disease present for 0:65 < d 6 2. If we increase the supply of allochthonous input slightly and set A ¼ 0:6 then the system becomes disease free almost everywhere within 0 6 d 6 2 ( Fig. 6(b) ). Next, bifurcation diagram with respect to A of the infected prey population are drawn for different infection rate d in Fig. 7 . Fixing d at different levels (at d ¼ 0:68; 0:72; 0:74; 0:78), we observe that the system (3) becomes disease free when allochthonous input A P 0:62 (Fig. 7) on the other hand whenever A lies within 0 6 A < 0:62, the infection exists in the system. From the above bifurcation diagrams, we observe an internal relationship between infection rate (d) and allochthonous inputs (A). So, we have numerically calculated the infected and uninfected regions in the A À d parameter plane in Fig. 8. From Fig. 8 , it is clear that for low Table 1 is plotted. The Ad-plane is divided into infected and uninfected regions. We observe that for higher infection rate, high level of allochthonous inputs is required to make the system disease free. allochthonous inputs, the system may have disease for higher infection rate. On the other hand for very high infection rate, the system become disease free in presence of high allochthonous inputs. Notice that in Fig. 8 the boundaries between infected and uninfected regions are not perfectly distinct, because, there is some degree of sensitivity to small changes in parameter values resulting in sharp transitions between different dynamical outcomes.
