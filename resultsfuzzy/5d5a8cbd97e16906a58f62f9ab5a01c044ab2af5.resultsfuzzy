The synthesis of nucleobase-derived nitrones 20 has been recently described. 46 The 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions of the nitrones 20 to allyl alcohol were carried out at 60 C or under MW irradiation (Scheme 2, Table 1 ). The reactions were regiospecific and produced cis/trans mixtures of diastereoisomeric cycloadducts 21 and 22 in moderate to good diastereoselectivities (d.e. 82e28%). The cis/trans ratios of the isoxazolidines were calculated from the 1 H NMR spectra of the reaction mixtures by comparison of integrations of diagnostic resonances of the H 2 C-4 protons in the isoxazolidine ring as well as the signals of the respective protons of nucleobase moieties. The relative configurations in homonucleosides cis-21a and trans-22a have already been established based on 2D NOE experiments. 46 These assignments have been extended on cis-21b and trans-22b, cis-21c and trans-22b, cis-21d and trans-22d as well as cis-21e and trans-22e pairs of diastereoisomers due to almost identical spectral patterns for HC3, H 2 C4 and H5 protons but also for diastereotopic protons in H 2 CeB and H 2 CeOH moieties in the respective 1 H NMR spectra. In continuation of our studies on the reactivity of the nitrones 20, allylphosphonate 23, allyloxymethylphosphonate 24, vinyloxymethylphosphonate 25 and vinylphosphonate 26 were selected as dipolarophiles to synthesize 1 0 -homonucleotide analogues having non-hydrolyzable PeC bonds separated by none, one, two or three bonds from C5 in the isoxazolidine ring in compounds 27/28, 29/30, 31/32 and 33/34, respectively. The installation of CeOeCeP(O)(OR) 2 fragments in the designed compounds is additionally substantiated by their presence in nucleoside phosphonate drugs like adefovir, tenofovir and cidofovir and several other drug candidates. 47, 48 Heating the nitrone 20a with an excess (3 equiv.) of allylphosphonate 23 at 60e80 C for 24 h did not result in the formation of even traces of the expected products. However, cycloadditions of nitrones 20 with alkenes 23e26 were successfully carried out under microwave irradiation (Scheme 3). The progress of the reactions was monitored by the 1 H NMR spectroscopy until the disappearance of the starting nitrone. The ratios of diastereoisomeric cycloadducts were calculated from the respective 31 P NMR spectra of the crude reaction mixtures. The 1,3dipolar cycloadditions of the nitrones 20 with alkenylphosphonates 23, 24 and 25 (Scheme 3, Table 2 ) were regiospecific and gave cis/ trans mixtures of diastereoisomeric cycloadducts cis-27/trans-28, cis-29/trans-30 and cis-31/trans-32 with diastereoselectivities (d.e. 78e40%, Table 2 ) comparable to that found for analogous reactions with allyl alcohol (d.e. 82e28%, Table 1 ). In most cases chromatographic removal of the unreacted alkenylphosphonates was difficult and less effective than distilling-off an excess of allyl alcohol, and thus led to lower overall yields. In general, longer reaction times were required to achieve a full conversion of the nitrones 20a with less reactive dipolarophiles such as 23e25 when compared to Table 1 ; b) allyl alcohol MW, 60e85 C, see Table 1. an analogous reaction with allyl alcohol. Moreover, during the reaction of the adenine-derived nitrone 20e with allylphosphonate 23 decomposition of the starting nitrone was observed and the unreacted dipolarophile 23 was recovered almost quantitatively. When the same nitrone 20e was treated with vinyloxymethylphosphonate formation of a complex reaction mixture was noticed from which expected pure isoxazolidine cycloadducts could not be isolated. On the other hand, traces of 5-fluorouracil were found in crude reaction mixtures when the nitrone 20b was treated with alkenylphosphonates 23e26 under MW irradiation. To verify the stability of this nitrone under conditions of the cycloaddition reaction a solution of 20b in acetonitrile was heated under MW irradiation and the progress of the reaction was monitored by the 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Indeed, the formation of 5-fluorouracil was observed after 7 h (1%) and increased to 6% after an additional 14 h. The amount of 5-fluorouracil reached 15% after 18 h but the solution was contaminated with other unidentified decomposition products (up to 46%). Similarly, slow decomposition of the adenine-derived nitrone 20e during MW irradiation of the solution in acetonitrile was observed. 1 H NMR spectra taken after 12 h revealed decomposition of the nitrone 20e (c.a. 15%), since additional signals appeared in a region characteristic of adenine protons. The relative configurations in cis-27 and trans-28 as well as in cis-29 and trans-30 can again be deduced taking into account almost identical 1 H NMR spectral patterns when compared to those of cis-21 and trans-22. This could be predicted because the spatial and stereoelectronic influence of the substituents at C3 (CH 2 eBase) and at C5 (CH 2 eOH in 21/22, CH 2 eP in 27/28 and CH 2 eOCH 2 P in 29/30) have an indistinguishable impact on the preferred conformations of the isoxazolidine rings in the cis and trans isomers. Although we were unable to unequivocally establish these conformations in addition to 2D NOE spectral data 22 further support for our configurational assignments comes from the comparison of the chemical shifts of H-C5 protons in the cis and trans diastereoisomers (Fig. 4) . Thus, in the 1 H NMR spectra of all transconfigured isoxazolidines (22, 28, 30) resonances of H-C5 are significantly shifted upfield in comparison to the cis isomers (21, 27, 29) , e.g. 4.12 ppm in 22a vs. 4.40 ppm in 21a, because the H-C5 protons in the trans isomers are positioned in the shielding cone of the heteroaromatic ring. The same phenomenon can be observed for the Hb-C4 protons in both the cis and trans isoxazolidines but the shielding effects are much better pronounced for the cis isomers, e.g. 1.79 ppm for Hb-C4 vs. 2.59 ppm for Ha-C4 in 21a and Tables 2 and 3. 2.10 ppm for Hb-C4 vs. 2.31 ppm for Ha-C4 in 22a. Although 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of isoxazolidines cis-31 and trans-32 prepared from vinyloxymethylphosphonate resembled each other regardless of a nucleobase present they significantly differed from those of the already discussed cis-21/27/29 and trans- On the other hand, when diethyl vinylphosphonate 26 was applied, in addition to major 3,5-disubstituted isoxazolidines cis-33a-e and trans-34a-e (Scheme 3, Table 3 ), the formation of minute amounts (less than 10%) of regioisomeric 3,4-disubstituted products 35a-e and 36a-e was also noticed. Their presence in the crude products as well as in the fractions obtained after column chromatography was detected by the 31 P NMR spectroscopy (Table 4) and additionally proved by careful analyses of the 1 H NMR spectra where diagnostic signals of nucleobase protons could be assigned to four different cycloadducts, namely cis-33a-e, trans-34a-e, and 35a-e/36a-e. As observed previously, 1 H NMR spectra of the major (cis-33) and minor (trans-34) derivatives were also similar within the series (a-e). In 2D NOE spectrum of cis-33c interactions between H 2 C-B and HbC4, HaC4 and HC3 as well as HaC4 and HC5 protons were noticed thus proving their locations on the same sides of the iso- 13 C NMR spectra of cis-33c one can conclude that the isoxazolidine ring adopts the E 2 conformation 39 (Fig. 6) . To establish the trans configuration in 34c it is again worth noting the meaningful upfield shift (0.3 ppm) of HC5 proton in this isomer (4.18 ppm) in comparison to cis-33c (4.48 ppm) and NOE correlation peaks between H 2 C-B and HC5 (not detected in cis-33c) as well as between H 2 C-B and HbC4 (medium intensity) and H 2 C-B and HaC4 (weak). Furthermore, the preferred conformation 40 Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin (HHA) and Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) were used as the reference compounds. The antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 : the compound concentration required to reduce virus plaque formation (VZV) by 50% or to reduce virusinduced cytopathicity by 50% (other viruses). None of the tested compounds showed appreciable antiviral activity toward any of the tested DNA and RNA viruses at the concentration up to 250 mM.
