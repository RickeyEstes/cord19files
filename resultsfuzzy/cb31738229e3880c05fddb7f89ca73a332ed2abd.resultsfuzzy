MDL 28170, which is a potent cell-permeable inhibitor of calpain I and II [19] , was added to replicating L. amazonensis promastigote forms at different concentrations and cell growth was monitored for 4 days in vitro. The results showed that MDL 28170 arrested the growth of L. amazonensis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1) . The calpain inhibitor at 30 M induced a powerful reduction in the cellular growth rate by ca. 38%, 90%, 94% and 95% after 24, 48, 72 and 96 h, respectively. The lowest concentrations of the drug (20 M and 15 M) presented significant inhibitory effects only after 72-96 h of growth (Fig. 1) . Conversely, DMSO did not significantly affect parasite growth behaviour. The LD 50 after 48 h was 23.3 Â± 0.9 M. The antileishmanial activity was irreversible, since protozoa pre-treated for 72 h with the calpain inhibitor at 30 M did not resume growth when subcultured in fresh medium (data not shown). Corroborating these results, opti- (Fig. 2a) and DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 2b ). In addition, treatment with lower concentrations of the calpain inhibitor initially promoted an increase in the cell volume ( Fig. 2c and d) and then lysis of the parasite cell (Fig. 2e) . Based on the effects of MDL 28170 on the growth rate and morphology of L. amazonensis, we aimed to detect calpain homologues in this protozoan by immunoblot assays using different anti-calpain antibodies (Fig. 3) . Anti-Dm-calpain strongly recognised a polypeptide band migrating at approximately 80 kDa (Fig. 3, lane a) . No common epitopes were found between mammalian calpains and L. amazonensis polypeptides (Fig. 3, lanes b-d) . Lysates of mouse liver were recognised by anti-C21, anti-C23, anti-C24 and anti-Dm-calpain antibodies (data not shown). The calpain-like molecule was detected on the cell surface of L. amazonensis, as demonstrated by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy analyses using the anti-Dm-calpain antibody (Figs 4 and 5) . The immunofluorescence image showed labelling throughout the cell surface, including the flagellum. These results suggest that this trypanosomatid possesses molecules that share antigens with invertebrate calpain-related enzymes. In trypanosomatids, a calpain-related protein has already been reported in Trypanosoma brucei [20] and Crithidia deanei [21] . In the former, the protein was shown to be Fig. 5 . Fluorescence microscopy showing labelling of Leishmania amazonensis with anti-Dm-calpain antibodies. Experimental systems were analysed under differential interferential contrast images (a, c) and immunofluorescence (b, d). The bar represents 1 m. expressed in procyclics but not in bloodstream trypomastigotes. Furthermore, the protein probably possesses a stable interaction with the cell membrane, suggesting a function in cellular remodelling [20] . In C. deanei, the calpain-related molecule was shown to be proteolytically active and to be released by cells, however its function was not determined [21] . In this context, the inhibition of leishmanial growth produced by MDL 28170 may be due to its effects on calpainlike molecules. These results add new in vitro insights into the exploitation of calpain inhibitors in treating parasitic infections and add this family of proteases to the list of potential targets for development of more potent and specific inhibitors.
