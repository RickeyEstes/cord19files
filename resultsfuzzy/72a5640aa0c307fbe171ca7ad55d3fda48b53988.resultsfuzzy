Sixty-six patients (17 women and 49 men) were examined. Thirty-five patients were submitted to catheterization with the landmarks method and 31 patients with ultrasound guidance. Internal jugular vein cannulation was successful in 29 cases (82.8%) in the control group and in 30 cases (96.7%) of the ultrasound group (P = 0.07). Carotid artery puncture occurred in two cases in the first group and in one case in the second (P = 0.80). Jugular cannulation was successful at the first attempt in 74.2% and 86.6% of cases in the first and second group correspondingly (P = 0.25). The average access time was longer in the control group (9.33 s vs 6.85 s in the ultrasound group). Conclusion Ultrasound guidance improved the success rate of jugular vein cannulation and reduced the number of failures and complications as well as the number of attempts, but the difference between the two methods was not significant. The familiarity of the operators with the method is probably a contributing factor and must be taken into account. A total of 453 patients were included. AF occured in 24 patients (5.3%). In univariate analysis advanced age, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, previous treatment by calcium-channel blockers, and Simplified Acute Physiologic Score (SAPS II) were significant predictors of AF. Patients with AF received significantly more fluids and catecholamines, and experienced more sepsis, shock (especially septic shock), and acute renal failure. The severity (SAPS II), the ICU workload (OMEGA), the ICU and hospital length of stay, and mortality were significantly increased in patients who developed AF. Multivariate analysis identified five independent predictors of AF: advanced age, blunt thoracic trauma, shock, pulmonary artery catheter, and previous treatment by calcium-channel blockers. The ITBVI, cardiac index, stroke volume index, and oxygen delivery index increased significantly at tep and remained elevated for t30 and t60, but there was no significant difference between the two groups. EVLW, although moderately elevated, remained unchanged, and there was no significant difference between the groups Introduction Acute hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis (AP) is still an essential problem with a high mortality. Disturbed microcirculation and as a consequence decreased tissue oxygenation is a crucial effect in the cascade from the self-limiting mild edematous to the often fatal form of AP. The aim of the study was to evaluate the therapeutic approach of isovolemic hemodilution (IHD) with hydroxyethyl starch (HES) alone and in combination with HBOC-301 and with Ringer's solution with regard to pancreatic tissue oxygen tensions and survival in pigs suffering from acute pancreatitis. Methods After approval of the local ethics committee, 39 pigs were anesthetized, endotracheally intubated and normoventilated (FIO 2 = 0.3). After laparotomy and splenectomy the pancreatic duct was cannulated. The pancreatic tissue oxygen tension (tpO 2 ) was measured using a silicon catheter (Licox Medical Systems, GMS, Germany). After 30 min equilibration, AP was induced by a combination of intravenous cerulean and intraductal glycodeoxycholic acid. Fifteen and 75 min after induction of AP, animals were randomized and isovolemically (PAOP constant) hemodiluted with 10% HES 200.000/0.5 plus HBOC-301 (+ 0.6 g/dl plasmatic hemoglobin; Oxyglobin Â® , Biopure, USA) (HES/HBOC group), 10% HES 200.000/0.5 (HES group) or Ringer's solution (RINGER group) to a hematocrit (Hct) of 15%. tpO 2 was measured every hour 30 min after reaching Hct of 15%. After 6 hours catheters were removed, the abdomen was closed and animals were extubated. After 6 days (144 hours) animals were sacrified. Statistical analyses were performed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normal distribution, Student's t test was used for normally distributed data and the chi-square test for the survival rate (significance, P < 0.05). Results After induction of AP, tpO 2 decreased in all groups and increased significantly after IHD with HES/HBOC in comparison with the HES and RINGER groups (P < 0.001). tpO 2 remained low in the HES and RINGER groups and decreased after 5 hours (P = 0.046) and 6 hours (P = 0.015) in the Ringer group in comparison with the HES group. The survival rate at the end of the observation period was higher in the HES/HBOC group (10/13) (P = 0.002) in comparison with the RINGER group (2/13) (P < 0.001), and between the HES (8/13) vs RINGER groups (P = 0.016). The mean pct-diff was significantly higher (adjusted mean = 2.22, P = 0.01) for the group with increasing CO 2 gap than for the decreasing group (adj. mean = 0.59). Their was no significant difference in LBP values for both groups but a significant one due to the general condition of the patients (adj. mean SAPS group 1 = 20.22; adj. mean SAPS group 2 = 14.03; P = 0.13). In IL-6 values there were also no significant differences, but the mean for each group suggests that the il_diff values are even higher in the group with decreasing or stable CO 2 gap 1 day after surgery (adj. mean stable-group = 41.34, adj. mean increasinggroup = -134.6; P = 0.056). There were no other significant differences in lactate, cardiac index, blood pressure or mean arterial pressure between the two groups. Furthermore there was a tendential significant difference in ICU time. Patients with increasing CO 2 gap have been longer on the ICU than other patients (mean group with increasing CO 2 gap = 4642 min vs 2934 min for the other one; P = 0.094). Of 54 patients studied there were 16 survivors (29.6%) and 38 nonsurvivors (70.4%). The nonsurvivors had a significantly longer stay in the ICU (22.3 days vs 7.9 days; P = 0.0042), had significantly more laparotomies per patient (4.1 vs 2.4; P = 0.024), had more patients with an open abdomen following surgery (15 vs 1; P = 0.01), had significantly more blood transfusions (10.8 vs 2.9; P = 0.0077), and had a significantly higher mean APACHE II score on admission (16.5 vs 10.7; P = 0.0175). The initial surgery was performed as an emergency procedure in 72% of patients, and of these four were delayed for greater than 48 hours. Of the survivors, the source was eradicated at the initial laparotomy in 12 of the 14 patients. Most of the patients that died developed multiorgan failure. In this regard none of the patients who survived required dialysis, whereas 44% in the nonsurvivors were dialysed. Nonsurvivors had more organisms isolated from the peritoneal fluid and more bacteremic episodes. The most frequently isolated organism from the peritoneal fluid in nonsurvivors was Escherichia coli. Conclusions Patients with abdominal sepsis are at risk of dying if there is delay in surgery and if the source of sepsis cannot be controlled at the first operation. In addition, more than four relook laparotomies, renal failure requiring dialysis, longer ICU stay, culture of pathogens from the peritoneal cavity and blood, higher APACHE II score, and requirement for blood transfusion contribute significantly. Background Originally known as a target molecule for plasmodium vivax and as a blood group antigen, DARC has emerged as a promiscuous binding site for chemokines. Besides red blood cells, DARC is also expressed on endothelial cells, even in Duffynegative individuals. However, the function of DARC during systemic inflammation remains unknown [1] . In a neutrophil (PMN)dependent model of LPS-induced ARF [2] , we sought to assess whether DARC plays a role in the development of organ failure during systemic inflammation.
