Structural bioinformatics analyses of the ACE2-RBD complexes were performed using a three-step procedure as described in Section 2. The calculated binding free energies of the wild type and virtual mutant complex structures are shown in Table 3 . Here, the agreement or disagreement between the computational predictions and the experimental evidences is paid special attention for the validation of our structural bioinformatics approaches and the discrimination of predictability between the sister complexes AE and BF. For instance, both pseudovirus infections and binding assays reveals that all the three RBDs mentioned above could attach to the civet cat receptor whereas only the TOR2 RBD is able to efficiently utilize the human ACE2 (Li et al., 2005b) . In addition, the TOR2 RBD is shown to lack the rodent receptor-binding activity (Li et al., , 2005b . As for the models derived from the AE complex, the civet cat ACE2 attaches to the RBDs of TOR2, GD and SZ3 with the binding free energies in an ascending order (the binding affinities in a descending order), being congruent with the observations in binding assays (Li et al., 2005b) . And a similar rank of RBD association energies is also found for the human receptor, completely consistent with the data of pseudovirus infections and binding assays (Li et al., 2005b) . In particular, the wild type complex AE (TOR2-human), representing the interactions between human receptor and the human-isolated TOR2 RBD obtained during the serious emergence of SARS in 2003, holds the lowest energy (−15.8 kcal/mol) among the 12 AE-based complexes. While the highest binding energy score (−10.9 kcal/mol) is rewarded to the mutant complex (SZ3-human) mimicking the contacts of civet cat-isolated SZ3 RBD with human ACE2. In the middle of the two extremes lies in the energy value of the mutant complex (GD-human) modeling associations between human ACE2 and the human-isolated GD RBD in the reemerging case of SARS with mild symptoms. The significant differences in the human receptor-binding energy or affinity among the three viral RBDs, especially that between the two extremes, offer us an excellent interpretation for the human receptorbinding specificity differentiation of SARS-CoV spike protein given the high correlation with biochemical evidences (Li et al., , 2005b . In addition, the equally higher binding energies (−12.3 kcal/mol) of rodent ACE2 with TOR2 RBD successfully account for the viral entry barriers posed by the rodent receptors . Collectively, the virtual substitutions strongly suggest the validity of our structural bioinformatics protocols and the predictability of AE complex. Notably, this directly leads to the following speculation that rats might be a vector or reservoir for some prototypes of SARS-CoV due to the calculated binding free energy of SZ3-rat complex being comparable to those of TOR2-civet cat and GD-human complexes. In other words, a probable cross-species transmission chain of SARS-CoV is from previously identified bats (Li et al., 2005a) through rats and subsequently civet cats (Consortium, 2004; Guan et al., 2003) to human, coupled with molecular adaptation to host species-specific factors via high-rate mutations. In fact, the possible vector role of rats in the SARS outbreak at Amoy Gardens has been previously implied (Ng, 2003) and the confirmed first case of human SARS-CoV infection was reported to have only contacts with rats (Liang et al., 2004) . In particular, a very recent review (Wang et al., 2006) suggested serologic evidences of rats susceptible to SARS-CoV whereas the detailed information still waits for publication. The viral strain they used might account for the sharp conflict between in vivo and in vitro experimental observations. Certainly, the molecular epidemiological surveillance and subsequent biochemical investigations are clearly necessary to test this hypothesis. As proposed previously (Holmes and Rambaut, 2004) , the surveillance should be focused on the high population density wildlife spatially and temporally in close contacts with human community, such as birds, bats and rodents. In addition, the sampling and sequencing of those animal ACE2 in combination with the computational approaches adopted here could be informative for the rapid identification of viral mutants of high likelihood for the utilization of both animal and human receptors, the co-infection of target cells of different host species, and the expansion of host range, or even worse the reemergence of this zoonosis in human population. In sharp contrast to the predictions based on the complex AE, the calculations derived from the complex BF display an unexpected pattern in conflict with biochemical evidences. For instance, the binding energy of the TOR2-civet cat complex is the minimum among those of all the 12 BF-based structures and even markedly lowers than that of the wild type (TOR2-human) with a difference of more than 3 kcal/mol. However, pseudovirus infections and binding assays (Li et al., 2005b) do not support this indication but find that the TOR2-civet cat complex has an equivalent binding affinity with reference to the TOR2-human complex. Besides, disagreements between computations and experiments are simultaneously found for interactions of human or civet cat receptor with the other two viral RBDs (SZ3 and GD). For each of the two receptors, the SZ3 RBD binds to ACE2 with a lower free energy than the GD RBD, opposite to the rank speculated from biochemical analyses (Li et al., 2005b) . Obviously, the energetic effects of viral strain-specific or host species-specific variations on the RBD-ACE2 complex formation under the condition of inhibitor-bound receptor still need further experimental characterization. But in this case, the poor predictability of BF complex prohibits it from further consideration.
