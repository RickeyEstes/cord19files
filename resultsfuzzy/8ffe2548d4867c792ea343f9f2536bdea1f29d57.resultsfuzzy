The steady-state airflow field indoors was first simulated, which shows a typical distribution pattern of mixing ventilation, as shown in Fig. 5 . With this airflow field, six benchmark scenarios of contaminant dispersion were further simulated over 180 s with a time step 0.5 s. In each scenario, only one of the six potential sources ( Table 2 ) was released at a constant rate. By using the simulated concentrations and Eq. (3), the TACS from each potential source to each sensor was calculated. Fig. 6 presents an example of TACS variation, from potential source CS3 to each sensor. The TACS curves from CS3 to SR3 and SR4 varied in magnitude and shape, while the curves from CS3 to SR1, SR2, and SR5 overlapped one another and had much lower values. This indicates that SR3 and SR4 can more easily detect CS3 than the rest sensors. The toxic gas spreading scenario for testing the presented identification method was simulated over 180 s with a time step of 0.5 s. In this scenario, CS3 and CS5 were simultaneously released at a constant rate of 50 mg/s Fig. 7 shows the variation in concentration distribution in this scenario. Using the simulated concentrations, the lag times of each sensor with different sensor thresholds were obtained directly, and are summarised in Table 3 . For this scenario the FRS was sensor SR3 at sensor thresholds of 1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/m 3 , and its lag times were 11, 14, and 15 s respectively.
