At least one bacterial growth was detected in 42 (36.8%) patients' culture. The most commonly grown bacteria based on the culture studies were S. pneumoniae (10.5%) and H. influenzae (8.8%) ( Table 2 ). Bacteria reproducing in group D were elevated in terms of quantity and diversity. P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii were reproduced only in group D patients (Table 2 ). However, there was no significant difference between GOLD stage and culture results of the patients (P=0.325). There was no  In the real-time PCR study, similar to the ratio of direct microscopy, at least one bacterial agent was obtained for 65% of the patients (Table 2 ). In PCR, there was a significant difference between PPB isolation and exacerbation frequency (P=0.002). There was no significant relationship between GOLD stages, FEV 1 , CAT scores, and age with PCR results (Tables 3 and 4) . As in culture, quantity and diversity of bacteria in group D were higher. Moreover, mixed infectious agent frequency was observed to be elevated in group D. The distribution of bacteria according to stage is shown in Table 2 . When we compared the PCR and culture methods in terms of bacterial detection rate, the detection rate by PCR was significantly higher (P=0.01). While bacterial growth was detected in cultures from 42 patients, the PCR method was able to detect bacteria in 74 patients. The PCR method detected bacteria in 40 out of 42 patients with positive cultures. There were only two patients who had positive cultures but did not have bacteria according to the PCR results. There was a significant difference between the culture and PCR methods in terms of detection rates of multiple pathogens (P,0.001). The PCR method was able to detect multiple bacteria in 19 cases, while the culture method did not detect multiple pathogens in any of the tested cases.
