For statistical analysis of the concentration data, Aubrun and Leitl [15] have evaluated the influence of the averaging time on the statistical results through comparisons between wind tunnel experimental data and field measurement results. the experimental relative error for the statistical results was acceptable. With regard to the present experiment, the T * a calculated on the basis of a 120 s averaging time is approximately 390. To further check the reliability of the results, a beforehand analysis was performed to estimate the minimum sampling time from specific tests. The minimum averaging time to reach a converged (i.e. representative) standard deviation is roughly 60 s and 90 s at selected key measurement points under closed-and open-window conditions, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that the required time under open-window conditions is generally longer than that under closed-window conditions because the detected concentration could be more fluctuating when the window is open. Even at several special measurement points such as D0-S3-F4-P2 ( ), which is located on the deep side of the re-entrant space, and D0-S6-F7-P1 ( ), which is located on the vertical adjacent floor near to the source location, a 90 s sampling time is sufficient to reach a converged standard deviation. Therefore, a 120 s sampling/averaging time additionally ensured an acceptable repeatability in the fluctuation results. The fluctuation intensity, cumulative distribution functions and 90th percentile values are presented and analysed here. It should be pointed out that a significantly large amount of data has been obtained during the experiment. The corresponding results, however, are not entirely discussed in this paper.
