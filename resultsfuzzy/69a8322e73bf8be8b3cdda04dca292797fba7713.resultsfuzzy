Toledo cells mainly expressed Mac-1. In addition, conversion of B cells into macrophage-like cells could also take place under severe hypoxia, a compounded condition of SARS infection. Our data provide a reasonable explanation for the reduced B lymphocytes and the profusely infiltrated macrophages in SARS patients, in whom the newly emerged macrophages in the infected lung expressed Bcell markers (Chow et al., 2004) . In contrast to B cells, we observed a very low transduction rate on CD19-negative WBC (left panel of Fig. 2B ), indicating that peripheral T lymphocytes were not the target for SSDRB. Pathologically, expression of bilineage markers for both neutrophils and monocytes, or that of mixed-lineage markers for both lymphocytes and monocytes, has been found in a subtype of acute myelocytic leukemia, M4, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Horny et al., 1994; Umiel et al., 1993) . Coexpression of B-cell and macrophage markers, e.g., Mac-1 (CD11b), CD14, CD15, CD19, CD20, and CD68, has been found in Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) (Hsu et al., 1990; Zukerberg et al., 1991) . Malignant HL cells behave like macrophages in vitro, engulfing exogenously added Candida albicans (Hsu et al., 1990) . Moreover, among HL subtypes, including lymphocyte predominance, mixed cellularity, nodular sclerosis, and lymphocyte depletion, reduction of lymphocytes is correlated with poorer prognosis of the disease (Shimabukuro-Vornhagen et al., 2005) . Interestingly, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is frequently detected in HL lesions (Weiss et al., 1987) and EBV infection is also associated with disease progression (Claviez et al., 2005; Keegan et al., 2005) , particularly in older patients with nodular sclerosis and lymphocyte depletion. Based on these data and our current results, we propose that virus infection, such as EBV and SARS, may take a shortcut in accelerating unusual conversion of lymphocytes to macrophage-like cells under severe conditions, in which the patient's immune system may not be able to respond in time to neutralize viral infection either humorally or cellularly (Ding et al., 2003) . As determined by microarray analysis, expression of CD86 (B7-2) gene was rapidly induced in B lymphoma cells within 12 h of SSDRB treatment (Fig. 4B) . This result suggests that SSDRB-transduced B lymphoma cells were redirected to express marker of monocytic/dendritic lineage (Re et al., 2002) . Likewise, HIF1g ene expression was induced within 12 h of SSDRB treatment. Interestingly, expression of HIF1˛has been known to correlate with increased phagocytic activity of macrophages under hypoxia (Anand et al., 2007) . Besides SSDRB, prolonged exposure to hypoxia also induced conversion of B cells to macrophage-like cells (Fig. 5A ). SSDRB and hypoxia may somehow interact synergistically to induce phenotype conversion (Fig. 5B) . Taken together, we have identified the Mac-1 marker (macrophage specific) ( Fig. 2D and 3C ), CD68 marker (monocyte/macrophage specific) (Fig. 3D) , and CD86 marker (for monocytic/dendritic lineage) (Fig. 4B ) in these macrophage-like cells converted from SSDRB-transduced B cells. Nonetheless, these macrophage-like cells might not readily function as normal macrophages since they did not adhere well to plates nor efficiently engulfed red fluorescent beads ( Fig. 5B and C) . Therefore, such phenotypic conversion could be a pathological effect rather than a host-protective response. Enhanced expression of C/EBP␤ in SSDRB-transduced B lymphoma cells was observed around 24-48 h after SSDRB treatment. Notably, several previous studies reported that ectopic expression of transcription factors, either C/EBP␤ plus C/EBP␣ or PU.1 alone, initiated phenotypic conversion of B cells into macrophages (Orkin, 2000; Sieweke and Graf, 1998; Xie et al., 2004) . In our study, levels of C/EBP␣ and PU.1 gene expression were not significantly differ-ent after SSDRB transduction. Instead, 2 other transcription factors, HIF1␣ and KLF-5, were found upregulated in SSDRB-transduced B lymphoma cells (Fig. 4B ). In the future, it would be necessary to determine whether HIF1␣ and KLF-5 may interact together with C/EBP␤ or act independently to participate in the conversion of B cells into macrophage-like cells. Grutkoski et al. (2003) has reported that SOCS-3 is induced exclusively in macrophages of septic mice to suppress inflammatory response. Here, we observed upregulated SOCS-3 gene expression around 24-48 h after SSDRB treatment, suggesting that macrophage-like cells converted from B cells might block inflammatory signaling via SOCS-3 action. In addition, our microarray analysis showed an increased expression in CD54 after SSDRB treatment. Interestingly, CD54 and Mac-1 upregulation is known to be related to the transmigration of peripheral monocytes and their differentiation into peritoneal macrophages (Liberek et al., 2004) . In our study, upregulation of CD54 (by microarray) and Mac-1 (by flow cytometry) correlated well with the conversion into macrophage-like cells. This result suggests that these macrophage-like cells may possess transmigration ability. Moreover, IGFBP3 was induced after SSDRB treatment. IGFBP3 may Microarray was used to identify genes that were expressed in Toledo cells after SSDRB (50 MOI) transduction. (A) Following analyses of scatter plotting and hierarchical clustering, differentially expressed genes were identified. Red indicates genes that were upregulated. Green indicates genes that were downregulated. Unchanged genes were shown in black. (B) Expression of CD86 and HIF1␣ increased markedly within 12 h of SSDRB treatment. At 48 h after SSDRB addition, the level of CD86 and HIF1␣ increased to more than 4-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively. Expression of SOCS-3, C/EBP␤, IGFBP3, KLF-5, and CD54 increased gradually around 24-48 h after SSDRB treatment. (C) Folds of gene enhancement (48 h vs. 0 h) were compared between SSDRB-treated cells and vAtE control. Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times. function either as an antiapoptotic or proapoptotic factor depending on the cell type and condition (Granata et al., 2004) . Wilson et al. (2005) has reported that IGFBP3 may protect myeloid cells against apoptosis mediated by Fas ligand or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF␣). Accordingly, IGFBP3 could protect macrophage-like cells from apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 4A , several genes that may be involved in cell death were differentially expressed after SSDRB treatment. Nonetheless, many of them were not significantly different until 48 h posttransduction. Among 6 genes that were upregulated at 48 h posttransduction, 3 encoded antiapoptotic factors (GADD45B, BAG-3, osteopontin) (Gupta et al., 2006; Liao et al., 2001; Song et al., 2008) and 3 encoded apoptotic factors (galectin-1, Fas, and DEDD2) (Kovács-Sólyom et al., 2010; Itoh et al., 1991; Alcivar et al., 2003) (data not shown). By flow cytometry, we observed a small fraction of SSDRB-treated cells in the sub-G1 phase (data not shown), which may represent apoptotic cells and could explain in part the lymphopenia observed in SARS patients (Chow et al., 2004; Nicholls et al., 2003; Zhan et al., 2006) . However, given the fact that the percentage of sub-G1 cells was much lower than the transduction rate, and around two-thirds of SSDRB-transduced cells became Mac-1 positive, we expect that macrophage-like cells converted from B cells may not represent dying proapoptotic cells. Finally, these macrophage-like cells (Figs. 3D and 5A) did not show any apoptotic features such as shrinkage in morphology, nuclear condensation, or apoptotic bodies (Kerr et al., 1972; Rich et al., 1999) . Certain murine B-cell lines have been reported to be able to transform into macrophage-like cells without ectopic overexpression of transcription factors (Tanaka et al., 1994; Spencker et al., 1995) . Among them, a nonadherent pre-B-cell line, 70Z/3, is known to be able to transform into an adherent pre-B-cell lineage and from which a macrophage-like lineage can be generated spontaneously without any known ligand (Tanaka et al., 1994) . However, transition from an adherent pre-B subclone of 70Z/3 to macrophage-like lineage takes about 1 month. On the other hand, CD5 + pre-B or B1 cell lines (e.g., SPGM-1, TH2.52) can be converted into macrophage-like cells from 1 to 3 days upon induction with ligands such as phorbol ester/calcium ionophore or interferongamma (IFN-␥) (Spencker et al., 1995; Koide et al., 2002) . In our study, we also observed a fast transition (within 1-2 days posttransduction) from peripheral B cells or B lymphoma cells to macrophage-like cells after stimulation with spike protein of SARS displayed on recombinant baculovirus. Addition of recombinant spike protein, in contrast, did not result in such phenotypic transition (data not shown). It is likely that spike protein displayed on recombinant baculovirus adopts a similar conformation as that on SARS-CoV. However, we should point out that the experiments presented here were done with a spike-expressing recombinant virus instead of SARS-CoV. In the future, it is imperative to elucidate whether SARS-CoV or other viruses may induce B cell conversion. Undoubtedly, all these observations may have other interpretations (Chang et al., 2004; Chow et al., 2004) , and the impact of SARS infection on lymphocyte conversion and delayed immune responses remains to be clarified. Although other gene products of SARS virus could be associated with the pulmonary pathology (Chow et al., 2004; Ding et al., 2003) , it is clear that spike protein, either directly or indirectly, affects lymphocyte conversion to myeloid cells, in particular if the viral effect is pathologically combined with hypoxia, which is an inevitable consequence of SARS infection. This in and of itself should provide a tool for elucidating the mechanism of delayed immune responses resulting from virus infection, and the subsequent pulmonary pathology and fatality (Chow et al., 2004; Ding et al., 2003) , of which the clinical symptoms are similar to those seen in patients infected with the avian influenza virus H5N1 (Ng et al., 2006) . It is possible that conversion of B cells to macrophage-like cells could be general during malicious virus infection, and such immediate host response could become more devastating than the routine immune response. In conclusion, we show that spike protein of SARS displayed on recombinant baculovirus or prolonged exposure to hypoxia can trigger the conversion of peripheral B cells and B lym- Following exposure to hypoxia (in an incubation chamber with 5% CO2 and 95% nitrogen) for 16-24 h, the size of some B lymphoma cells (as determined by Giemsa stain), both CA46 and Toledo, was increased markedly (indicated by arrows). Cell morphology of enlarged cells resembled that of monocytes/macrophages with horseshoe-shape nuclei. These cells were immunologically positive for CD68. (B) SSDRBtransduced B lymphoma cells (Toledo) (EGFP + cells) could hardly engulf any red fluorescent beads (microspheres) under both normoxia and hypoxia exposures. In contrast, macrophages isolated from mouse peritoneal cavity could readily ingest red fluorescent microspheres with high efficiency. (C) Phagocytosis percentage (%) of SSDRBtransduced B lymphoma cells (Toledo) under normoxia or hypoxia was determined, respectively, as the percentage of cells positive with more than 2 internalized microspheres. ***Significantly different (P < 0.001). Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times. phoma cells into Mac-1 positive macrophage-like cells. This is the first time a viral protein is identified as a ligand for phenotype conversion of B cells. Spike protein of SARS or hypoxia treatment may provide the convenient platform for studying signaling pathways involved in leukocyte interconversion or differentiation.
