Takeki Uehara Shionogi, Osaka, Japan S-033188 is small molecule inhibitor of the cap-dependent endonuclease PA inhibitor of influenza A and B viruses. It is hydrolyzed to the active form, S-033447 (Uehara et al., 2016) , inhibiting initiation of virus mRNA synthesis, preventing virus protein production. In vitro, S-033447 inhibited virus replication with an EC 90 of around 1 nM, up to 100-fold more potent compared to the NAIs. In mice, a single dose of 1.5 mg/kg reduced titers by 1 log 10 , while 15 mg/kg reduced lung virus titers by more than 3 log 10 . A single dose has a long half-life of 49-90 hours, and in a Phase I trial administration of a 6 mg dose of S-033188 exceeded the exposure level of the target potency. In a Phase II trial, 400 influenza positive adult patients at ≤48 hours after symptom onset were randomized to receive a single dose of 10, 20 or 40 mg or placebo. Nasal/throat swabs were taken for virus titers and EC 50 determination in a plaque assay, and blood samples were taken at 24 hours post-treatment for plasma concentrations. There was a rapid decrease in virus load of 3-4 log 10 by 24 hours, and all doses showed up to a 16 hour earlier resolution of fever and 28 hour earlier alleviation of all symptoms compared to the placebo group (mean ∼50 vs s 77 hours). Adverse events were similar to placebo, and adverse drug interactions were higher in the placebo group. Levels of drug in plasma at 24 hours were mostly proportional to the dose. The median EC 50 s of isolates at baseline were 40 nmol/L for A(H1N1)pdm09, 1.05 nmol/L for A(H3NX) and 6.90 nmol/L for type B viruses, comparable to earlier studies. There was a significant negative correlation between drug dose and a change in virus titer at days 2 and 3. Resistance studies were reported in poster P50 (Shishido et al.). Isolates from 4/112 patients infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, and 1/56 infected with B virus had substitutions in the PA gene. Only the PA I38T/F in the A(H1N1)pdm09 PA reduced susceptiblity in a plaque reduction assay.
