Details of the patients, including the genetic defect, comorbidities, and infections acquired before transplantation, are shown in Table I . Median age at transplantation was 10 months (range, 2.5-26 months). In 2 cases the molecular basis of the DGS was undefined, although in one of these cases a putative mutation has been found in TBX1 (analysis performed by Professor Klaus Schwartz, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany). Neither of these patients was an infant of a diabetic mother. Atypical cDGS cases outnumbered typical cases in a ratio of 2:1. There was no evidence of BCG-associated disease in the 2 recipients of this vaccine. Two patients had hypothyroidism before transplantation, the cause of which was not established. Both had negative test results for thyroid peroxisomal antibodies. One had a low thyroid-stimulating hormone value, suggesting a possible central cause, whereas in the other the problem proved to be transient. No patients had clear-cut autoimmune disease before transplantation.
