Attendees represented 29 countries, 16 languages, and 20 unique professions (Table 2 ). Thirty percent of the participants in the event were students (n = 30) and 45% of the attendees were female (n = 45). The average age of attendees was 25-34 years old. Post-event survey responses were received from 51 participants. Eighty-six percent of event survey respondents (n = 44) said that the IMED 2016 Hackathon was the first hackathon they had attended. A total of 32 individuals pitched problems to their fellow attendees, with 12 teams forming based on mutual interests and complimenting skills. Each of the 12 teams worked on a different project. One participant noted, "My team was an excellent combination of a variety of talentsan epidemiologist, a veterinarian, an architect, a nurse, and a One Health specialist". The average team size was five members, with the smallest team having three and the largest consisting of six members. Participants had access to a variety of climate change data resources, including global surface temperature readings from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) (NASA, 2017) and precipitation measurements from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (NOAA, 2017). The innovative infectious disease surveillance network known as the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases -ProMED-mailwhich was the first to identify the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 and the MERS-CoV outbreak in 2012, provided 53 000+ infectious disease outbreak reports for use in prototype program development (Allen, 2015; Fisher et al., 2012; Hartley et al., 2013; Madoff and Li, 2014; Petersen et al., 2014) . Over the course of 27 hours, teams defined their problem of interest, brainstormed potential solutions, and developed a sustainability model to turn their idea into reality. "I really enjoyed the creative process of designing a tool to address an unmet need", said one attendee. Twenty-eight mentors with experience in entrepreneurship, public health, veterinary health, infectious diseases, IT, and healthcare advised teams as they developed their programs. Mentors provided feedback and answered questions, ensuring teams presented comprehensive solutions. On average, six mentors advised each team. At the conclusion of the 2-day event, teams had 4 minutes to present their prototyped solution to fellow hackathon participants and a panel of judges, which included a representative from a local startup incubator, two public health practitioners, an infectious disease specialist, and an IT data expert. Judges rated each project in terms of feasibility, innovation, novelty, and scalability. Immediately following the presentations, judges deliberated to select winners for several monetary awards, shared co-working space at a local startup accelerator, and acceptance to an upcoming funding challenge. Winning teams were invited to present their projects at an IMED oral abstract session. Projects resulting from the IMED 2016 Hackathon included environmental impact assessment software for humanitarian organization relief efforts; enhanced communication tools to prevent infectious disease outbreaks; a participatory mobile application to help eliminate rabies in Indonesia; integrated disease surveillance platforms; and an improved search function for the ProMED-mail archive using natural language processing (2) USA (32) ( Table 3) . Teams retained all intellectual property rights generated while participating in the IMED 2016 Hackathon, and no rights were transferred to the organizers, partners, or sponsors. Ninety-four percent of post-event survey respondents (n = 50) agreed that the IMED 2016 Hackathon achieved its goal of promoting innovation, collaboration, and thinking outside traditional boundaries, while 31% of respondents (n = 16) wished that they had had additional time to develop their prototype. In total, 94% of survey respondents (n = 50) said that they would attend another hackathon.
