As previously discussed, response strategy at level 2 is the priority selection if a single Ebola case emerges. Under serious situation, response strategy at level 1 will be taken subsequently. The result shows that the epidemic will be under control if a single Ebola infection case emerges in the city of Beijing. In our study, the results are credible to some degree, and the detailed analysis is listed as follows. Firstly, the construction of artificial Beijing is directly supported by NSFC. With the assistance of related institutions, the generation of individuals and buildings and their distributions meet the statistical features. Moreover, the modeling work of individuals' behaviors and social networks integrates some positive results of other research teams such as Fudan University. In addition, the reasonability of artificial Beijing has been verified in the case of H1N1 influenza, which is affirmed by NSFC. Secondly, disease model is built according to the propagation parameters in West Africa. Although these parameters may be different from that in Beijing, it has been yet revised by Chinese Academy of Sciences. Moreover, interventions are designed according to the emergency response plans, and the simulation result is coincident with the conclusions of corresponding researches. Thirdly, quantitative analysis also testifies the reasonability of simulation result. As previously discussed, 0 is the key parameter in disease propagation. Once 0 is bigger than 1, the infection disease will spread; once 0 is less than 1, the epidemic situation will be under control. In a word, the goal of interventions is to reduce 0 from the current value to below 1. In our experiments, the current 0 of 4 levels of response strategies are 1.82, 1.43, 0.93, and 0.48 separately at the 100th day. Therefore, it is reasonable to control the epidemic situation if rigorous interventions are taken immediately.
