The exponential growth fitting results are shown in Fig 1(b) , (d), (f), (h), (j) and (l). The coefficient of determination, R-squared, ranges from 0.91 to 0.92 for all reporting rate changing scenarios, which implies that the early outbreak data were largely following the exponential growth. In Table1, we estimated that the R0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 5.71 (95%CI: 4.24-7.54) associated with 8-fold to 0-fold increase in the reporting rate. All R0 estimates are significantly larger than 1, which indicates the potential of 2019-nCoV to cause outbreaks. Since the official diagnostic protocol was released by WHO on January 17 [8] , an increase in the diagnosis and reporting of 2019-nCoV infections probably occurred. Thereafter, the daily number of newly reported cases started increasing around January 17, see Fig 1, which implies that more infections were likely being diagnosed and recorded. We suggested that changing in reporting might exist, and thus it should be considered in the estimation, i.e., 8-, 4-and 2-fold changes are more likely than no change in the reporting efforts. Although six scenarios about the reporting rate were explored in this study, the real situation is difficult to determine given limited data and (almost) equivalent model fitting performance in terms of Rsquared. However, with increasing reporting rate, we found the mean R0 is likely to be around 2 and 3. Our analysis and estimation of R0 rely on the accuracy of the SI of 2019-nCoV, which remains unknown as of January 25. In this work, we employed the SIs of SARS and MERS as approximations to that of 2019-nCoV. The determination of SI requires the knowledge of the chain of disease transmission that needs sufficient number of patient samples and periods of time for follow-up [19] , and thus this is unlikely to be achieved shortly. However, using SIs of SARS and MERS as approximation could provide an insight to the transmission potential of 2019-nCoV at the early stage of the outbreak. We reported that the mean R0 of 2019-nCoV is likely to be from 2.24 (8-fold) to 3.58 (2-fold), and it is largely in the range of those of SARS, i.e., 2-5 [11, 18, 20] , and MERS, i.e., 2.7-3.9 [12] . We note that WHO reported the basic reproduction number for the human-to-human (direct) transmission ranged from 1.4 to 2.5 [21], which is marginally lower than ours. However, many of existing online preprints estimate the mean R0 ranging from 2 to 5 [3, [22] [23] [24] , which is largely consistent with our results.
