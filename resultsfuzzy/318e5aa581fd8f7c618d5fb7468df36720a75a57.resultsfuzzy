Cooperative effect of initial velocity curves of R298A and R298L mutants To measure the activity of Mpro and its mutants, we used the 6-mer substrate peptide (TSAVLQ) attached to a pNA group (23) . This peptide is specifically cleaved by SARS-CoV Mpro at the designated site (Gln-pNA) to release free pNA, which results in an increased absorbance at 405 nm. Besides wild-type Mpro as a dimeric target, two single mutants, R298A and R298L, and one double mutant, R298A/Q299A, were chosen as the monomeric targets. According to previous studies (19) , mutation of R298 or Q299 will induce dimer dissociation and result in an~10-fold decrease in proteolytic activity (18) . When R298 and Q299 are both mutated, the enzyme activity decreases by 100-fold. Other studies also suggest that the monomeric Mpro by other mutations shows very low or no proteolytic activity (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) 31) . Indeed, in this study, we were not able to detect any enzyme activity associated with the R298A/Q299A double mutant. However, for the single mutants, R298A or R298L, the initial velocity pattern at various substrate concentrations displayed a sigmoid curve (Fig. 2, B and C) . The dimeric Mpro, on the other hand, exhibited a classical saturation curve (Fig. 2 A) . These results were then fitted to the Michaelis-Menten or Hill equations to evaluate the kinetic parameters. The best-fit results are shown in Table 1 . The K m (223 mM) and k cat (0.63 s Ã€1 ) of wild-type Mpro with TQ6-pNA substrate are close to observations from other laboratories (23, 32) . After fitting to the Hill equation, the k cat of R298A was sixfold lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. In contrast, R298L showed a k cat close to that of the wild-type enzyme. The Hill constants of R298A and R298L were 2.0 and 1.8, respectively. This nonunity number suggested that there is a strong positive cooperativity among the Mpro protomers. However, since the cooperativity phenomenon is not compatible with a monomeric form, we sought other evidence to examine the possibility of dimeric Mpro formation during the catalytic process.
