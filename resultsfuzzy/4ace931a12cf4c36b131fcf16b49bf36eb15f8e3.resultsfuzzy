TEV adaptation to A. thaliana: phenotypic changes The ancestral TEV was poorly adapted to A. thaliana Ler and infection concurred with the development of very mild symptoms ( Figure 1 ). Furthermore, 21 days post-inoculation (dpi), the viral load in infected plants, measured as the number of lesion-forming units (LFU) produced per milligram of tissue, was low, 48.3362.95 LFU/mg (6SEM), and the infectivity of the newly produced viral particles (i.e., the efficiency of initiating a new infection using a normalized amount of viral particles) was as low as 17.95% [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.54-33.53%]. Viral particles obtained from a single tobacco plant were used to initiate an evolution experiment in A. thaliana Ler plants. Seven independent lineages were founded. Each lineage consisted on 10 plants. Twenty-one dpi, positive infections were confirmed by Western blot hybridization using an anti-coat protein antibody (data not shown). One of the infected plants from each lineage was randomly chosen to be the source of viral particles for infecting the next batch of plants. This basic transfer protocol was serially repeated every three weeks. In six out of seven cases, lineages went to extinction as a consequence of decreases in viral loads beyond the threshold value that ensures efficient transmission. The only surviving lineage was maintained for 17 serial passages (hereafter TEV-At17). The viral load reached by TEV-At17 21 dpi, was 2138.386134.08 LFU/mg. In other words, TEV-At17 accumulation was ,44-fold larger than the value estimated for the ancestral TEV (two-sample t-test, t 43 = 15.58, P,0.0001). Not only more viral particles were produced per gram of infected tissue, but also the infectivity of TEV-At17 was 100% (95% CI: 77.91-100%) and significantly larger than for the ancestral TEV (Binomial test, 1-tailed P,0.0001). Furthermore, symptoms induced by TEV-At17 were more severe (Figure 1 ), including stunting, vein clearing and leaf deformation. TEV adaptation to A. thaliana: genotypic changes The above phenotypic changes have a correlate at the genetic level. Full-genome sequencing of TEV-At17 indicates that six changes have occurred during adaptation (first six rows in Table 1 ); three of them were non-synonymous. The first non-synonymous change, A1047V, affected the P3 protein. P3 localizes in nucleus and nucleoli in association with the NIa protein and participates in virus amplification through its interaction with the CI protein [20] . In other potyviruses, P3 is also involved in systemic movement [25, 26] . The second mutation is a T1210M replacement in the 6K1 peptide. This short peptide has been implicated in plant pathogenicity since its deletion results in symptomless infections [20] . Finally, the third amino acid replacement observed is L2013F in the VPg domain of the NIa protein. VPg is covalently attached to the 59 end of the viral RNA and has essential functions in the viral replication and, relevant for the problem in hand, it has been reported as a key determinant in host-genotype specificity for systemic movement or replication [20] and it has been recently demonstrated that the proper interaction between the translation initiation factor eI4B and VPg is necessary for TEV infection [27] . In conclusion, these three mutations may explain the observed improvement in virus amplification and pathogenicity. The relevance of the three synonymous substitutions observed is not as clear, although their adaptive value cannot be ruled out. To further characterize the relationship between these changes and symptoms severity, we introduced them by site-directed mutagenesis in the ancestral TEV clone. In addition, all three possible pairs of non-synonymous mutations and the triple non- synonymous mutant were also created. A. thaliana Ler plants were inoculated with these nine mutant clones and maintained in the same growth conditions for three weeks. The results of this experiment are summarized in Table 1 . All mutant genotypes were viable and replicated and accumulated in the plants, as confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Among the three single mutants, the only clone that produced visible symptoms was the one containing the L2013F allele in VPg. These symptoms were, nonetheless, qualitatively milder than those produced by TEV-At17 ( Figure S1 ). Concerning the three double mutants, only the combination of VPg and P3 substitutions induced symptoms that were qualitatively more severe than those produced by the single VPg L2013F mutant (Table 1 ) and almost as severe as those observed for TEV-At17. By contrast, mutation 6K1 T1210M does not have any effect on aggravating the symptoms associated with VPg L2013F. The combination of substitutions in P3 and 6K1 did not produce any symptom. Finally, the triple mutant recreated the strong symptoms characteristic of TEV-At17 (Table 1 and Figure S1 ). All together, these results suggest that the presence of substitution L2013F in the VPg protein is enough for triggering symptoms and that the severity of these symptoms is enhanced by the presence of substitution A1047V in P3, suggesting an epistatic interaction between these two mutations. The role of substitution T1210M in the 6K1 peptide remains unclear. It has been recently reported that the correct interaction between potyvirus' VPg and host's eIF4E is required to initiate a successful infection [27] . Recessive resistance of peppers to potyvirus depends on the substitution of relevant amino acid residues in eIF4E that disrupt the normal interaction between this translation factor and VPg. Resistance-breaking viral strains restore the normal interaction [27] . Therefore, we can hypothesize that TEV-AT17 has enhanced its ability to infect A. thaliana Ler by improving the interaction of its VPg with the host's translation initiation factor eIF4E. Differential effect of evolved and ancestral viruses on the overall pattern of host gene expression Next, we sought to unravel what component of the plant gene interaction networks and metabolic pathways have been targeted by the virus during its adaptation to A. thaliana Ler. Our goal is not to identify single genes but rather global transcriptomic changes. Long-oligonucleotide microarrays representing almost all genes in A. thaliana genome have been used to this end. Five replicates were analyzed per experimental treatment (control mock-inoculated plants, and plants infected with TEV and TEV-At17) using a global reference experimental design. After quality analysis, a total of 13,722 spots, corresponding to 12,180 genes, were considered as valid for further analyses (Table S1 ). Data were normalized to the median expression of non-infected plants, and thus they reflect biological differences in gene expression in each sample analyzed. Statistical analysis allowed identification of genes whose expression responded differentially upon infection with either TEV or TEV-At17 ( Figure 2 ). When comparing global patterns of gene expression in plants infected with ancestral and adapted viruses, 496 genes showed higher expression and 1,322 genes lower expression in TEV-At17 infections than in TEV infections ( Figure 2 and Tables S2 and S3); which represents 2.7 times more down-regulated than up-regulated genes (Binomial test, P,0.0001). Differentially expressed genes were grouped according to selforganizing maps (SOM) (Figure 3 and Table S4 ). Three global patterns of gene expression were observed among genes that were up-regulated by TEV-At17 infection ( Figure 3A ). The first pattern (SOMs A1 plus A2) corresponds to 130 genes whose expression was activated by both viruses but the magnitude of expression was magnified by TEV-At17. Genes belonging to this category include the pathogenesis-related protein PR1, which is well known to be a marker for the activation of salicylic acid-dependent defenses, such as the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) pathway [28, 29] . The second pattern (SOM A3) corresponds with 141 genes that were down-regulated after infection with TEV but showed expression levels similar to uninfected plants when infected with TEV-At17. The third pattern (SOM A4) corresponds to 234 genes whose expression was not significantly affected by TEV infection but show increased expression after infection with TEV-At17. Three distinct patterns were also observed among genes downregulated after infection with TEV-At17 relative to the infection with TEV ( Figure 3B ). The first pattern (SOMs B1 plus B2) represents 683 genes that were over-expressed by plants infected with TEV but infection with TEV-At17 resulted in expression levels similar to those observed in uninfected plants. Interestingly, proteins related with disease response such as PR5 and several other PR-like proteins as well as four proteins of the TIR-NBS-LRR class [29, 30] belong to this category. The second pattern (SOM B3) includes 196 genes that were down-regulated after infection with both ancestral and evolved viruses, although the magnitude of down-regulation was larger for TEV-At17. Finally, the third pattern (SOM B4) corresponds to 456 genes whose expression was not affected by TEV but showed lower expression when TEV-At17 infected the plants. The expression of transcription factors (TF) was also differentially affected by TEV and TEV-At17. Table S5 shows the list of differentially up-and down-regulated TF in plants infected with each type of virus. Fifty-one TFs, belonging to 20 families, were upregulated whereas 84 TFs, from 27 families, were down-regulated, including 13 ethylene-responsive binding factors (ERF), after infection with TEV-At. ERFs are linked to stress responses [31] and delays in ERF induction had been described in A. thaliana plants infected with virulent strains of the bacteria Pseudomonas syringae when compared with avirulent strains of the same bacteria [31] . Viral adaptation by avoidance of plant defenses Next, we examined the distribution of genes involved in related biological processes that are differentially affected by TEV and TEV-At17 (i.e., gene ontologies (GO) categories [32] ). The algorithm implemented in FatiGO [33] was applied to the nonredundant gene list grouped in each SOM (results are shown in Table S6 ). Only a significant differential category, response to salt stress, was identified for the SOM A3 of up-regulated genes shown in Figure 3A . By contrast, a large number of GO terms show significant over-and under-representation in the differentially down-regulated genes ( Figure 3B ). Table 2 shows the nonredundant functional categories that correspond to SOMs B1 plus B2 (i.e., genes over-expressed after infection by TEV but not differing from uninfected plants when infected with TEV-At17). Interestingly, significantly over-represented genes belong to functional categories which are related to plant responses to different abiotic (wounding, light intensity, temperature, salinity) and biotic stresses. Furthermore, genes involved in the SAR and in the activation of innate immune responses [29] were not expressed on plants infected with TEV-At17 while they were over-expressed on plants infected with the ancestral TEV, suggesting that the evolved virus acquired the ability to evade certain plant defense mechanisms, perhaps explaining the observed increase of viral load. Genes involved in basic cellular processes such as nucleic acid metabolism, translation and proteolysis were under-represented among down-regulated genes in SOMs B1 plus B2 ( Table 2 ), suggesting that the plant may be compensating for the consumption of these resources by an increased viral replication. A single significant GO category was also found in SOM B3 of down-regulated genes ( Figure 3B ), that is, gene expression was repressed in presence of both viruses but to a larger extent when TEV-At17 was infecting plants. Genes involved in response to auxin were under-expressed to a larger extent by plants infected with TEV-At17 than with TEV.
