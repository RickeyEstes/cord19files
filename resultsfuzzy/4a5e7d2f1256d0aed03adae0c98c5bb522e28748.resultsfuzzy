2.1. Expression of Active NS2B-NS3 pro in P. pastoris DENV4 NS2B-NS3 pro , fused to the α-factor secretion signal sequence and placed under the control of the methanol inducible alcohol oxidase promoter, was constructed to express the secreted protein in P. pastoris. The expressed NS2B-NS3 pro was 45 kDa based on western blot using the anti-His antibody ( Figure 1 ). The NS2B-NS3 pro proteolytic activity was monitored with fluorogenic tetrapeptide substrate containing the 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) leaving group (benzoyl-norleucine-lysinearginine-arginine-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland) for an increase in fluorescence at a λ ex = 380 nm and λ em = 460 nm at 37 °C. No enzyme activity was detected before induction or in the P. pastoris negative control without NS2B-NS3 pro gene (data not shown). NS2B-NS3 pro activity increased steadily with increasing culture time (and induction time) and reached a final activity of 480 U·L −1 after 96 h of induction with methanol. NS2B-NS3 pro was purified from P. pastoris culture supernatants. After dialysis to remove the potassium phosphate buffer, 77.6 mg of proteins remained in the culture medium supernatant. A total of 9.7 mg of NS2B-NS3 pro was isolated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The final preparation of NS2B-NS3 pro was 1.4 mg following ion-exchange chromatography using a DEAE-Sepharose column, which resulted in a 13.5-fold purification ( Table 1 ). The recombinant protein was expressed in approximately 0.8 mg·L −1 of the induced culture medium and specific activity of the purified recombinant NS2B-NS3 pro was 59.3 U·mg −1 . The Michaelis-Menten constant (K m ) derived with AMC peptide substrates from the Lineweaver-Burk plot was 1.60 ± 0.1 μM ( Figure S1 ).
