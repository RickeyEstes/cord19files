Visual inspection of the maps of the observed diarrhoea and fever prevalence by regions and districts (Figs. 1 and 2) suggest that regional classification conceal district variations. Table 1 shows that overall, the highest prevalence of both diarrhoea and fever were observed in the Central region, followed by the Southern region. Although the Northern region reported the lowest overall prevalence of both fever and diarrhoea, it had the district with the highest fever incidence of 63 percent (Nkhata Bay), further confirming that regional classifications do mask important district variations. The geographical variation was apparent for the district maps for the two morbidity conditions, but from the region maps it was not apparent. The hypothesis that regional classifications conceal district variations was investigated for both levels separately using Geo-additive probit models. Prevalence of disease for each household were related to the distance of the household from the nearest next district and region. The region variables were categorized into dummies. There was a clear spatial pattern as observed in the distribution of diarrhoea and fever prevalence at the district level (Table 1) . For example, the aggregate regional levels of diarrhoea (Table 1 or left panel of Fig. 1 ) in the central and northern regions of Malawi mask large district variability. The geographical information given in Table 1 (or right panel of Fig. 1) is highly aggregated and conceals local and district specific effects. On the other hand, diarrhoea prevalence by districts in Table 1 (or Fig. 2 ) strongly depended on the sample size and may be rather unstable. Smoothing techniques were used to stabilize the observed prevalence in the sample as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 . The bivariate distributions of fixed effects included in the analysis by the outcome variables are given in Appendix A, also showing significance based on Chisquare (w 2 ) tests. In the bivariate analysis based on the w 2 tests, factors that where significantly associated with diarrhoea are type of breastfeeding, child's age, parental education (both mother's and father's education), number of under-five children in the household, household size, place of residence (rural-urban), antenatal visit during pregnancy, child's place of delivery and the ethnicity. For fever, these factors are type of breastfeeding, child's size at birth, child's age, parental education (both mother's and father's education), number of under-five children in the household, household size, place of residence, antenatal visit during pregnancy, child's place of delivery and ethnicity. We have established in this analysis that diarrhoea and fever especially during the early months of life is sensitive to low levels of parental education. Similarly, in a study of the variation in African mortality, Blacker (1991) , cites the much lower levels of female education in each country. Studies using WFS and DHS data have shown that about half of the education-mortality association is accounted for by the economic condition of the household (Bicego & Boerma, 1993; Cleland & van Ginneken, 1988) . We find that, maternal education rather than paternal education matters a lot in reducing diarrhoea risk, whereas both low maternal and paternal education influence fever risk. There are also some ethnic differences in terms of diarrhoea and fever risk where, for example children from the Sena ethnic group are more likely to have both diarrhoea and fever compared to other children. This suggests the need for in-depth studies in these communities to understand cultural child rearing practices that may put children at an increased risk of diarrhoea and fever. It should be noted that in the DHS data set, questions regarding fever control apply also to malaria control although there is a net clinical difference between the two diseases. Malaria-relevant indicators include the reported treatment and care (whether antimalarials were given and facilities attended) to under-5s who had fever in the 2 weeks preceding the interview. The interpretation of fever in this report should take into account the fact that the DHS surveys are (for logistical reasons) mostly conducted in the dry, least malarious season (Africa Malaria Report, WHO, 2003) . In addition, the observed prevalence of diarrhoea can be considered as incidence rate of diarrhea. Because of the short followup period of 2 weeks before the interview, we have ignored the role of competing risk, although diarrhoea may be present in different forms: persistent diarrhoea (more than 14 days), acute watery diarrhoea, or dysentery (blood in stool). Other diseases that can occur concurrently with diarrhoea include measles and malaria. Malnutrition also often accompanies diarrhoea. It is important to point out that some of the factors observed to be significantly associated with prevalence of both fever and diarrhoea in the bivariate analysis, such as antenatal care and delivery care, turned out not to be significant in the multivariate analysis that simultaneously controlled for spatial effects as well as the effects of other covariates. It is possible that health care utilization is a reflection of accessibility of health care services and has been captured by the spatial effects in the multivariate analysis. Also vaccination status turns out to be statistically insignificant, although other studies in rural sub-Saharan Africa have reported immunization status of a child as an important factor associated with diarrhoea (see for instance Mbonye, 2003 Mbonye, , 2004 . It should be noted that in the DHS, the reliability of parental recall of vaccination status for vaccines given to infants has not been studied and it is therefore unknown and may affect these results. Possible reasons for the lack of association between childhood disease and the economic status may be because, many of the household wealth indices use assets that are more likely to be found in urban areas than in rural areas. Thus, most of the rural households will be in the lowest wealth category even if they have other indicators of wealth (e.g. livestock or farm machinery). The consequence of this misclassification would be to lower the risk of childhood diseases of rural households. Another limitation with household wealth indices derived from DHS is that they are based on current status data so that they might not capture the true level of household wealth during the infancy of children born several years before the survey. However, since these analyses are restricted to births within 5 years of the survey, this bias will not be substantial. To explain further these inequalities in childhood diseases prevalence at district level in Malawi, further research is needed to scrutinize the spatial pattern of occurrence of water-borne illnesses to specific locations. This will enable us to draw a picture of where and whether events are concentrated, which will help in turn to guide local public health response or investigation to help identify at-risk populations and determine where to focus efforts to vaccinate residents against malaria. Moreover, the measure of disease prevalence used here, recall of whether a child had been ill with diarrhoea or fever in the past 2 weeks is less perfect as it is quite subjective, based on a short-term recall. Future work needs to address the question of disease environment more closely.
