The ensuing years will reveal the total impact of this disaster on society and the world of skyscrapers. Some changes will be determined by the findings of the World Trade Center Building Performance Study and later studies. The following comments are from the World Trade Center Building Performance Study: 49 During the course of this study, the question of whether building codes should be changed in some way to make future buildings more resistant to such attacks was frequently explored. Depending on the size of the aircraft, it may not be technically feasible to develop design provisions that would enable all structures to be designed and constructed to resist the effects of impacts by rapidly moving aircraft, and the ensuing fires, without collapse. In addition, the cost of constructing such structures might be so large as to make this type of design intent practically infeasible. Although the attacks on the World Trade Center are a reason to question design philosophies, the BPS Team believes there are insufficient data to determine whether there is a reasonable threat of attacks on specific buildings to recommend inclusion of such requirements in building codes. Some believe the likelihood of such attacks on any specific building is deemed sufficiently low to not be considered at all. However, individual building developers may wish to consider design provisions for improving redundancy and robustness for such unforeseen events, particularly for structures that, by nature of their design or occupancy, may be especially susceptible to such incidents. Although some conceptual changes to the building codes that could make buildings more resistant to fire or impact damage or more conducive to occupant egress were identified in the course of this study, the BPS Team felt that extensive technical, policy, and economic study of these concepts should be performed before any specific code change recommendations are developed. This report specifically recommends such additional studies. Future building code revisions may be considered after the technical details of the collapses and other building responses to damage are better understood. The debris from the collapses of the WTC towers also initiated fires in surrounding buildings, including WTC 4, 5, 6, and 7; 90 West Street; and 130 Cedar Street. Many of the buildings suffered severe fire damage but remained standing. However, two steel-framed structures experienced fire-induced collapse. WTC 7 collapsed completely after burning unchecked for approximately 7 hours, and a partial collapse occurred in an interior section of WTC 5. Studies of WTC 7 indicate that the collapse began in the lower stories, either through failure of major load transfer members located above an electrical substation structure or in columns in the stories above the transfer structure. The collapse of WTC 7 caused damage to the Verizon building and 30 West Broadway. The partial collapse of WTC 5 was not initiated by debris and is possibly a result of fire-induced connection failures. The collapse of these structures is particularly significant in that, prior to these events, no protected steel-frame structure, the most common form of large commercial construction in the United States, had ever experienced a fire-induced collapse. Thus, these events may highlight new building vulnerabilities, not previously believed to exist. possible considerations for improved egress in damaged structures, the public understanding of typical building design capacities, issues related to the study process and future activities, and issues for communities to consider when they are developing emergency response plans that include engineering response…. [Regarding one of these aspects,] building evacuation, the following topics were not explicitly examined during this study, but are recognized as important aspects of designing buildings for impact and fire events. Recommendations for further study are to: Perform an analysis of occupant behavior during evacuation of the buildings at WTC to improve the design of fire alarm and egress systems r in highrise buildings. Perform an analysis of the design basis of evacuation systems in high-rise buildings to assess the adequacy of the current design practice, which relies on phased evacuation. Evaluate the use of elevators rr as part of the means of egress for mobilityimpaired people as well as the general building population for the evacuation of high-rise buildings. In addition, the use of elevators for access by emergency personnel rrr needs to be evaluated…. [Regarding another of these aspects,] education of stakeholders (e.g., owners, operators, tenants, authorities, designers) , [they] should be further educated about building codes, the minimum design loads typically addressed for building design, and the extreme events that are not addressed by building codes. Should stakeholders desire to address events not included in the building codes, they should understand the process of developing and implementing strategies to mitigate damage from extreme events. r For example, to facilitate counterflow by occupants moving downward and emergency responders (such as firefighters) moving upward, NFPA Life Safety Code requires that each stairwell that must accommodate a total cumulative occupant load of fewer than 2,000 persons have a stair width of 44 inches (1.12 meters), and those that must accommodate more than or equal to 2,000 persons have a stair width of 56 inches (1.42 meters) (Cote R, harrington g. NFPA 101 Life Safety Code Handbook. Quincy, MA: national Fire Protection Association; 2006:158, 159) . rr For some years this issue has been a major concern of fire protection individuals. Commenting on this subject, Charles Jennings, MS, MRP, John Jay College, stated that "The latest and most advanced thought is now devoted to developing pressurization requirements for elevator shafts and lobbies. The objective of these current efforts is to make elevators a useful component of the building evacuation system during a fire" (Jennings C. high-rise office building evacuation planning: human factors versus 'Cutting edge' technologies. [J Appl Fire Sci. 1994-95; 4(4):289-302, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.; 1995:291] ). Since 9/11 there has been much discussion as to the feasibility of using elevators to evacuate occupants under emergency conditions. See Chapter 6 for additional information. rrr "Because of tragic 9/11 stories of doomed firefighters overburdened with gear and out of radio contact, Chicago and other cities are reviewing emergency communications and requiring or recommending that skyscrapers install lockers or closets with hoses, axes and oxygen tanks on upper floors so firefighters don't have to carry them" ("high-rises remain vulnerable after 9/11." O'Driscoll P. The investigators examined the design of the buildings, the behavior of the people, and the evacuation process in detail to ascertain the factors that figured prominently in the time needed for evacuation. In analyzing these factors, NIST recognized that there were inherent uncertainties in constructing a valid portrayal of human behavior on that day. These included limitations in the recollections of the people, the need to derive findings from a statistical sampling r of the building population, the lack of information from the decedents on the factors that prevented their escape, and the limited knowledge of the damage to the interior of the towers. 52 Led by strong industry associations and fire safety-conscious professionals at the major chains, the industry began to respond. In 1980, the year of the MGM Grand Hotel fire, sprinklers were reported present in only one of nine hotel or motel fires reported to U.S. fire departments. Detectors were reported present in just over one-fourth of reported hotel or motel fires. An industry-sponsored study of sprinkler usage in 1988 found sprinklers present in roughly half of all properties, suggesting the percentage today is much higher still. The latest data show smoke detectors in more than 80 percent of hotel and motel fires and automatic sprinklers in 40 percent of hotel and motel fires and more than three-fourths of high-rise hotels. It is reasonable to assume that the new level of built-in fire protection had much to do with the dramatic drop in the number of hotel and motel fires since 1980. NFPA statistics from 1988 through 1997 indicated that sprinklers cut the chances of dying in a given fire by 91 percent and also reduced the average property loss per fire by 56 percent. In terms of the deadliest fires, beginning in 1983, only two hotel or motel fires have killed 10 or more people, and each of them was on the outer fringes of the industry that formed on the exterior of the building exposed each elevator lobby on the floors above primarily by radiation. The fire progressed vertically from floor to floor to the top of the building via the building 's exterior. 192 Occupants who were trapped or who remained in their rooms and telephoned the hotel operators were told to put wet towels and sheets around the doors and wait for the fire department. Most of the smoke inhalation injuries occurred when guests opened their room doors or tried to evacuate the building. 193 Four victims were found in guest rooms.… All the rooms had open doors to the corridor or evidence that corridor doors had been opened…. There were no fatalities in rooms in which occupants kept the doors closed and waited out the fire or waited for rescue. 194 According to the nFPA's fire investigation, [T]he most significant factors that contributed to the fire spread and subsequent fatalities, injuries and damage in the fire incident were: failure to extinguish the fire in its incipient stage and the presence of highly combustible carpeting on the walls and ceilings of the involved elevator lobbies contributing to the exterior fire spread. The resulting fire spread exposed a large number of the building's occupants on multiple floors. 195 "The person who initially called in the fire alarm to the security dispatcher was arrested, charged, and indicted for eight counts of homicide and arson. The individual was a hotel room service bus boy, and had been employed there only a few weeks. " 196 1986 Dupont Plaza Hotel & Casino, Puerto Rico December 31, 1986 , San Juan, Puerto Rico-The Dupont Plaza hotel and Casino fire [ Figure 3 -12] resulted in the death of 97 persons and over 140 injuries. The mid-afternoon fire resulted in smoke that spread to the 17-level hotel tower guest room floors. Eighty four of the 97 fatalities were located in the casino.… Five fatalities occurred in the lobby area, three were found in a passenger elevator stopped between the basement and the first floor level, one fatality was in a guest room on the west side of the fourth floor, and two victims were found on the exterior of the building at the poolside bar … like the five occupants trapped in the lobby, the 84 victims in the casino were caught by the violent extension of the fire through the casino/lobby level. 197 Local authorities and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) Even though significant amounts of smoke, heat, and toxic gases penetrated the high-rise tower, especially on its lower levels, there was only one fatality in the tower. It is felt that exterior balconies provided occupants trapped for hours with a safe refuge area until the fire could be suppressed or they could be assisted by rescuers. 200 1988 First Interstate Bank Building, Los Angeles, California May 4, 1988 , Los Angeles, California-The First Interstate Bank Building fire ( Figure  3 -13), at 707 Wilshire Boulevard, resulted in the tragic death of a building engineer trapped in a service elevator that he used to travel to the initial fire floor to investigate the source of automatic fire alarms, smoke inhalation suffered by many of the 40 people located inside the office building at the time of the fire, and a loss estimated by the national Fire Protection Association Fire Analysis and Research Division at $50 million. r "Severe fires in occupied office buildings during business hours are very rare, in large part due to the awareness of people in the building to unusual conditions. Occupants of high-rise office buildings are mobile, awake, and alert, and they are effective early detectors if they are adequately trained to summon help. When such alerting occurs, fires usually are in their initial phase of growth, when they can be controlled more easily. This illustrates the importance of occupant training that includes emergency fire notification procedures" (Klem TJ. May 4, 1988 , as flames shoot from the windows of the 62-story building. Fire officials described the 3½-hour blaze as the worst high-rise fire in the history of Los Angeles. Used with permission of AP IMAGES. A combination of combustible wood-and-vinyl-covered furnishings in the area of fire origin, the combustible decor of the coffee shop, the wooden decor of the complex, and the lack of any active fire suppression systems allowed the fire to develop rapidly.... Combustible interiors, the westerly breeze, and the lack of fire separation, compartmentation, and active suppression systems allowed the fire to spread rapidly through the lower levels of the complex. As the fire grew, the lack of pressurization in the stairwell, the lack of selfclosers on many of the upper-level doors, and the lack of firestopping in the service shafts allowed smoke to penetrate the upper levels, causing the hotel to fill with smoke.... According to the local police officers responsible for the initial investigation, the sister of one of the hotel's senior managers had fled the area of the fire before she realized that no one had begun to evacuate the resort's guests. When she re-entered the complex to do so, she was overcome by the fire. 217 


Section:what future changes may result from the world trade center's destruction?
Section:the 1980 mgm grand hotel fire, in las vegas, nevada, inspired an industry response that combined unprecedented widespread code compliance with fire safety provisions that often ran ahead of code requirements. the result has been a dramatic change both in the fire death toll in hotels and motels and in the use of proven fire protection systems in that industry….
Section:as a result of the fire, authorities learned how disastrous poor housekeeping and a lack of fire safety education can be in old high-rises. smoke doors on the top floors had been wedged open, allowing rapid fire spread, and no safety precautions had been taken while the elevators were being repaired. many of the buildings residents and occupants used the elevators exclusively and didn't even know
