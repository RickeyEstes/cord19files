Taken in isolation, the mean and variance are the EWS least impacted by reporting. Unless the overdispersion in the observation process is high (ϕ = 0.01), their performance is largely unaffected by reporting process parameters. At low reporting probabilities they outperform the autocorrelation, autocovariance, decay time and index of dispersion, and are independent of aggregation period and infectious period. EWS sensitive to correlation between neighboring data points perform well unless i) ϕ = 0.01 and/or ii) 1/γ > δ and ρ ≲ 0.06. While it is clear how high overdispersion in reporting reduces correlation in the data, an explanation for ii) is less clear. If calculated from snapshots data, the coefficient of variation, kurtosis and skewness are the worst performing statistics (|AUC − 0.5| % 0). Using case report data improves performance under certain conditions. If cases are aggregated weekly with low reporting probability and low overdispersion then they are among the best performing EWS, with |AUC − 0.5| % 0.5. In addition the trends of the skewness and kurtosis (both decreasing) are opposite those given by the BDI process (both increasing). Overall, we conclude that these three EWS are unreliable indicators of disease emergence as their performance is conditional on a limited range of reporting process parameters.
