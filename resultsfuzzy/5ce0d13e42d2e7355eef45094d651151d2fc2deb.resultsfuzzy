A panel of known HCoV-OC43 positive and negative samples was screened and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was utilized to determine the assay cut-off. ROC analysis allows for data that is not normally distributed and for evaluation of sensitivity and specificity to be determined separately. The null hypothesis of ROC analysis is that the testing method is no better than flipping a coin, as would be demonstrated by a diagonal line on the ROC curve and an area under the curve (AUC) equal to 0.5 while a perfect test would have an AUC of 1. Given the limited detection of the HCoV-OC43 acute sera by HCoV-OC43 N3 protein ( Fig. 2A) , ROC analysis was completed based on the results of screening 11 HCoV-OC43 positive convalescent and 47 negative serum specimens (Fig. 3) . AUC value for HCoV-OC43 N3 was 0.894 (data not shown). Optimal cut-off values for positive test results were determined by plotting percent sensitivity and specificity against OD cut-off values (Fig. 3A) . The cut-off value was set at 0.161 (OD 405 value at intersectional point in Fig. 3A) with a corresponding sensitivity of 90.1% and specificity of 82.9%. With this cut-off value, 10 out of 11 HCoV-OC43 convalescent samples had positive test results with the remaining sample producing a borderline result. The sensitivity of the HCoV-OC43 N3 protein ELISA was comparable to that of the whole HCoV-OC43 N protein ELISA (Fig. 3B ). While the overall mean OD values for both acute and convalescent specimens were higher using the whole HCoV-OC43 N protein ELISA, the HCoV OC43 N3 ELISA had a better ability to detect rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent specimens than the whole HCoV-OC43 N protein ELISA. Using the established cut-off value, the 47 HCoV-229E (n = 27) and SARS (n = 20) serum samples were re-screened by HCoV-OC43 N3 ELISA. One acute and one convalescent serum sample from two HCoV-229E patients and convalescent sera from six SARS patients showed reactivity to HCoV-OC43 N3 protein for 82.9% specificity (Fig. 4A) . The overall assay performance is summarized in Table 2 .
