An attenuated replicating VSV vector system was utilized for the development of VSVAg85A. This vector system carries a mutation in the viral matrix protein, leading to inability of the virus to block mRNA export from the nucleus of host cells and thereby restoring antiviral cytokine responses that are normally limited during wild-type VSV infection. 23 This feature of the vector was exploited as built-in immune adjuvanticity for immunization. 14 VSV was engineered to express the immunodominant M.tb antigen, Ag85A, which is a mycolyl transferase enzyme necessary for mycobacterial cell wall synthesis and a member of the Ag85 complex proteins (Ag85A/B/C). 24, 25 Ag85A, when expressed in genetic TB vaccines, has been shown to be one of the most immunogenic M.tb antigens. 24, 25 Ag85A was placed downstream of the human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) signal peptide, allowing secretion of the protein in order to maximize antigen presentation through both major histocompatibility complex class I and class II pathways, and thereby to enhance the immunogenicity of this antigen. 26 The tPA-Ag85A transgene was cloned into the viral genome between the G and L genes (Figure 1a) . After viral rescue and purification, A549 cells were infected with either titrated VSVAg85A or an Ad expressing Ag85A (AdAg85A) as a control. The cell lysates were separated using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblots were probed using a monoclonal Ag85A antibody and polyclonal VSV antibody. VSVAg85A-infected cells expressed Ag85A (Figure 1b) and also the VSV proteins (Figure 1c) . In VSVAg85A-infected cells, a single Ag85A protein band was detected, suggestive of an unprocessed form (tPA-Ag85A), whereas, in AdAg85A-infected cells, there appeared two similar-sized protein bands, suggestive of the presence of both unprocessed (tPA-Ag85A) and processed (Ag85A) forms (Figure 1b) . The Ad-or VSV-infected cells produced Ag85A protein that was at a higher molecular weight than the native Ag85A protein, likely due to the presence of attached signal peptide and post-translational modifications in infected mammalian cells. Therefore, VSVAg85A was able to incorporate the foreign M.tb transgene successfully and express it in abundance from infected cells. determination of an optimal dose of VsVAg85A for immunization In order to characterize VSVAg85A in vivo, Balb/c mice were immunized intramuscularly (IM) with increasing doses of VSVAg85A. One week after the immunization, the mice were killed and splenocytes were stimulated ex vivo with Ag85A-specific CD4 and CD8 peptides. The frequency of occurrence of IFN-γ + T cells was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot. Naive controls exhibited no antigen-specific T cells (data not shown). There was no clear difference in the IFN-γ-secreting CD4 T-cell responses among all the doses tested (Figure 2a) . Although not statistically different, the level of IFN-γ-secreting CD8 T cells triggered by 1 × 10 7 plaque forming units (PFU) dose was higher than the other two doses tested (Figure 2a) . This dose was thus used for all subsequent experiments. These data also indicate that VSVAg85A is immunogenic in vivo. In view of the fact that VSVAg85A remains replication-efficient, and with the anticipation of its potential usefulness in respiratory mucosal immunization, we used the 1 × 10 7 PFU dose to examine the extent of lung tissue inflammation caused by intranasal (IN) immunization. In comparison with naive controls (Figure 2b , left panel), we observed only a slight increase in cellularity within the lung parenchyma in mice immunized IN with VSVAg85A (Figure 2b , right panel). Aside from this modest infiltrate, the overall levels of inflammation in the tissue and airway endothelium were minimal. This affirms that this dose of VSVAg85A, when delivered mucosally, is minimally inflammatory. In order to further characterize VSVAg85A immunization, we compared T-cell responses after two different routes of administration of the vector. Balb/c mice were immunized through either the parenteral (IM) or the mucosal (IN) route, and T-cell responses were analyzed in the airway lumen, lung, and spleen over a 3-week time-course. Tetramer staining was used for estimating CD8 T cells specific for an immunodominant CD8 epitope within Ag85A. Following IM immunization, antigen-specific CD8 T cells were found mainly in the lung and spleen (Figure 3b In order to examine the functionality of T cells, the cells harvested from these three tissue compartments were stimulated with Ag85A CD4 and CD8 T-cell peptides and intracellular cytokine staining (ICCS) was carried out to measure antigen-specific, IFNγ-producing T cells. As with the distribution of tetramer+ CD8 T cells, CD4 or CD8 IFN-γ + T cells predominantly populated the systemic tissues after IM immunization (Figure 4b and c, left panel), whereas undetectable levels were found at the mucosal site (Figure 4a , left panel). Such responses appeared to be dominated by CD8 T cells. In contrast, IN immunized mice generated IFN-γ + CD4 and CD8 T cells almost exclusively in the airway lumen (Figure 4a , right panel). While some cells were detected in the lung interstitium, very little systemic activation was evident in the spleen following this route of immunization (Figure 4b and c, right panels). It is interesting to note that, in contrast to the effect after IM immunization, a greater CD4 T-cell response was triggered by IN immunization. Further, the kinetics of T-cell activation resulting from these alternative routes of immunization also seemed to differ, with 1 week and 2 weeks being the time-points for peak activation after IN and IM administration, respectively. week later the naive mice as well as the immunized mice were examined for lung pathology. For this purpose, the mice were killed, the lungs were sectioned and hematoxylin and eosin stained, and representative images were presented. immune protection against M.tb challenge in the lung. To this end, mice were immunized with either IM VSVAg85A or IN VSVAg85A, with IM AdAg85A or subcutaneously administered BCG as controls. Two weeks after immunization, the mice were challenged through the airway with virulent M.tb. Four weeks after the challenge, the lungs were analyzed for bacterial burden. As observed earlier, 6, 27 BCG was able to provide ~1 log protection and IM AdAg85A provided little protection as compared to naive mice (P ≤ 0.001) (Figure 5a) . As with IM-administered AdAg85A, IM immunization with VSVAg85A also provided little protection (Figure 5a) . In contrast, IN VSVAg85A conferred a significant level of protection (~0.5 log) when compared with naive and IMimmunized mice (P ≤ 0.05) (Figure 5a) . In order to understand whether the protective T-cell responses to VSVAg85A administered IN would be sustained, mice were immunized as described earlier and challenged with M.tb at 4 weeks after immunization. Again, as observed earlier, BCG maintained ~1 log protection (P ≤ 0.001) (Figure 5b) . However, the initial protection provided by IN-administered VSVAg85A that was observed at 2 weeks had vanished in the mice when challenged at 4 weeks after immunization (Figure 5b) . These data suggest that, although IN immunization with VSV vaccine provides better protection than the IM route, such protection is relatively transient.
