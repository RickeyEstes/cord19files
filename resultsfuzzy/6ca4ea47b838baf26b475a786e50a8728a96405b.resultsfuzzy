A comparison of nucleotide sequences of the oligonucleotides from Conn46 and M41 to IBV genomic RNA sequence of IBV strain Beaudette resulted in 71 and 84% similarities, respectively. These sequences were located within the genomic sequence of IBV between 5682-5719, and 1292412953 nucleotides for oligonucleotides of Conn46 and M41, respectively. Both locations are found to be within the gene encoding an RNA polymerase. The Tl RNase fingerprinting technique is based on the fact that Tl RNase cleaves an RNA strand 3' of each guanosine (G) residue generating oligonucleotides of varying lengths. These oligonucleotides, 5' end-labeled with a radioactive tracer (e.g., 32P) and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, produce a unique (and reproducible) pattern of migration (fingerprint) for each specific RNA molecule. The fingerprint homology between viruses (including IBV isolates) has been used to assess their phylogenetic relatedness (Clewley et al., 1981; Kusters et al., 1987) . In this study we tested the hypotheses that: (1) the large Tl RNase-resistant oligonucleotides which appear unique to an IBV strain in a fingerprint, contain nucleotide sequences specific to that strain and (2) complementary probes made against those oligonucleotides specifically hybridize to the homologous strain. In the sequencing of oligonucleotides, some difficulties were encountered initially. The amounts of RNA initially recovered by elution from the fingerprinting gels were not sufficient for sequencing. This was corrected by (1) increasing the amount of genomic RNA for RNase Tl digestion; and (2) enriching for the larger oligonucleotides prior to end-labeling. These steps led to incorporation of sufficient isotope into large oligonucleotides to permit nucleotide sequence analysis. The results of the dot-blot hybridization experiments with the two probes synthesized during this study are presented in Fig. 2 A and B . Both probes reacted similarly with the purified RNAs of IBV strains Ark99, Conn46 and M41 under low stringency washing conditions, indicating the absence of strain specificity. However, when either the temperature of hybridization or the washing temperature was increased to 65Â°C there was no detectable signal even after long periods of exposures (results not shown). We believe that the lack of strain specificity of the probes may have been influenced by the fact that Tl RNase-resistant oligonucleotides which appear specific to a strain of IBV may not have enough sequences unique to that strain to be used in hybridization studies for discrimination of IBV strains. In addition, the low G + C composition of the probes may have reduced the effective temperature range for discriminating well-matched from mismatched hybrids. Finally, the probes may have hybridized to themselves because of the palindromic nature of residues within the oligonucleotides which may have decreased the specificity of the hybridization and did not allow more stringent hybridization conditions. Although the actual reasons for the failure to generate strain-or serotype-specific oligonucleotide probes in this study are unclear, it appears that the use of nucleotide sequence information from Tl RNase-resistant oligonucleotides for the synthesis of strain-specific probes for IBV may not be suitable, without considerable effort to identify potential sequences that might yield serotype-or strain-specific probes. Since the beginning of these studies, two other approaches have been described for detection of IBV RNA and identification of IBV serotypes. Each has met with limited success. The first is the use of cDNA clones, generated by a random priming method, as hybridization probes Collison et al., 1990) . The results of hybridization studies suggest that these probes can be used for detection of IBV RNA but can not be used for serotypic identification of IBV strains. The second is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques. The first application of this technique to IBV was described by Andreasen et al. (1991) who reported amplification of a 1020-nt fragment from IBV strain Beaudette by using two primers to conserved regions. In another study, Lin et al. (1991) amplified 400 nt from the S2 genes of twelve strains of various IBV serotypes. Although, restriction enzyme analysis of amplified DNA showed different patterns that were consistent with serological typing, it was not clear why this consistency occurred, since serotypic determinants were shown to be located on the Sl subunit. In a similar study, Zwaagstra et al. (1992) amplified 438 nt from the N genes of 18 IBV isolates and sequenced 360 nt of each isolate. They showed that the sequences of the N genes were different between serologically indistinguishable strains. All three methods, including the method described by us, were able to detect IBV RNA; however, none of them was able to detect serotypic differences. This suggests that nucleic acid detection methods may not be suitable for identification of IBV serotypes. This may due to the following: (1) as noted above cDNA clones are not suitable for discrimination because, while there may be variation between the strains, there is considerable homology between the strains of various IBV serotypes; (2) although considerable sequence data are available, design of universal IBV-specific primers that can be used for amplification of the Sl gene has not been achieved due to high sequence variability between the strains. Perhaps oligonucleotide hybridization probes based on sequences from the Sl gene would be more likely to discriminate strains belonging to different serotypes. There are other reasons that may further hamper the development of serotypic nucleic acid detection methods. The most important is the difficulty in establishing a correlation between the nucleic acid sequences and VN determinants, probably due to the following: (1) the exact location of serotypic determinants remains to be determined; (2) it has been shown that VN epitopes that determine virus serotype are conformation dependent, and are usually formed by non-contiguous amino acids on the polypeptide chain; hence, amino acid changes in distant and different locations may cause changes in serotype of the virus; (3) modification of the proteins such as glycosylation may also cause changes that may not be detectable by nucleic acid probes. As a result we believe that although nucleic acid analysis methods are very valuable tools in epidemiologic studies, nucleic acid detection methods may require further refinements in order to be used for identification of IBV serotypes.
