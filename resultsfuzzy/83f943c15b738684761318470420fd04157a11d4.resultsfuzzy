Bioinformatics and computational tools are widely used for understanding the functional and structural aspects of microbial proteins Kandeel et al., 2009; Alnazawi et al., 2017) . MD simulation is a widely used technique for understanding structural protein changes in response to different effectors (Alfuwaires et al., 2017; Moore et al., 1998; Shen et al., 2003; Kandeel and Kitade, 2018) . In this study, MD simulation was run in a system comprising monomer or trimer of MERS CoV S2 HR. The stability of each system was evaluated by changes in RMSD as well as changes in the system energy. In order to get maximal precision, the MD simulation results were compared from two different software programs by implementing two different force fields, AMBER14 and CHARMM. All MD simulations showed rapid energy stabilization for both HR monomer and trimer. Fig. 1 shows the changes in RMSD for each structure in relation to time in ps. HR trimer showed rapid stabilization at less than 5 ns, having constant low fluctuations in RMSD and remaining around 3 Å over the entire recorded simulation. In contrast, S2 monomer from two structures was less stable, showing high fluctuations in RMSD with major drifts at 25-30 ns (Fig. 1A) . Despite the lower RMSD observed for the monomer in 3MOD structure, it shows high fluctuations in RMSD. This indicates that monomer of S2 bears high flexibility and instability, while trimer constitutes the more or less rigid state of S2. This agrees with the prediction models and resolved structures indicating that S2 of SARS CoV (Deng et al., 2006; Bernini et al., 2004) and of MERS CoV could arrange into trimers (Gao et al., 2013) . Additionally, the results from NAMD CHARMM run (Fig. 1B) was highly comparable with YA-SARA AMBER14, indicating conserved features of trimer stability and monomer dynamic nature. Fig. 1C shows the energy during MD simulation and indicates the stability of the trimer at lower energy level. The changes in RMSD for every amino acid in MERS CoV HR were estimated for trimer ( Fig. 2A) and monomer (Fig. 2B) . The crystal structures of monomer (4MOD and 4NJL) showed more or less similar profiles, albeit with some differences in RMSD (Fig. 2B) . In S2 monomer, there was more generalized change in RMSD with clear differences at a) the N and C-termini of the HR complex, b) in the middle of the HR1 helix, and c) in the linker between HR1 and HR2. In contrast, the trimeric structures showed different profiles, with major changes in the linker and C-terminal regions and little or no change in other HR regions ( Fig. 2A) . In addition, most residues in trimer showed low RMSDs of around 1 Å, with a maximum value at 6.2 Å. A large increase in RMSD values was observed for residues in the range from GLY1250 to ASN1256 (RMSD 3-5 Å). S2 monomer showed more dynamic changes, with a peak RMSD exceeding 10 Å and generalized changes of 2-4 Å along the HR residues. Alignments of pre-and post-MD simulation structures for both monomer and trimer are represented in Fig. 2C . The alignment reveals greater stability for trimer (represented by one chain in the lower panel), compared with more dynamic changes in monomer (upper panel), especially in the middle of HR1, the linker region, and at the protein termini. The obtained results from NAMD software and CHARMM force field (Fig. 3) were almost similar that estimated by YASARA software. This confirms the finding that residues in monomer are highly mobile either within the linker region or within the backbone of HR1 and HR2. The higher RMSD scale (x-axis) in monomer implies generally higher changes in residues in comparison with trimer. RMSD is a common measure of global changes in protein structure. However, several concerns and uncertainties in using RMSD have been previously raised (Kufareva and Abagyan, 2012) . Of special interest are major dynamical changes at the termini of HR domains with large RMSDs, which might result in misestimation of dynamical changes across the whole system. For more accurate consideration of global changes and accurate inclusion of flexible or terminal highly mobile loops, analysis was also performed using GDT_TS. In agreement with RMSD, GDT_TS revealed the stability of MERS CoV S2 trimer (Table 1 ). The percentages of superimposable residues within 1, 2, 4, or 8 Å in trimer were 2-to 3-fold higher than in monomer. This reflects the more dynamic nature of S2 monomer during MD simulation. The GDT_TS scores for monomer and trimer were 40.6 and 74.2, respectively. Therefore, the greater global changes in S2 monomer are decomposed by trimerization. In addition to global changes in HR, specific residue changes were also investigated. The helical component of HR is composed of several repeats of seven residues. The position of residues in these repeats can be termed a, b, c, d, e, f and g. Of special interest are the residues at positions a and d; which are located almost in the center of the HR, are predominantly bulky and hydrophobic, and share in establishing the hydrophobic core of HR. Position a is represented by residues F1012, F1019, V1026, and L1033, while position d comprises residues F1001, M1008, T1015, V1022, and L1036. MD simulation revealed that residues at a and d positions are most stable, having the least changes in RMSD in comparison with the initial structure. The average RMSD after MD simulation for residues at a and d positions (RMSDad) was found to be smaller than the average of all residues. For HR1, the average RMSDad was 4.37 Å and 0.93 Å for HR monomer and trimer, respectively. Similarly, the RMSDad for HR2 was 3.9 Å for monomer and 1.01 Å for trimer. These values are much lower than the general RMSD averages of 4.98 Å for monomer and 1.49 Å for trimer (Table 2) . To determine the key factors governing the stabilization of viral HR, the inter-HR1-HR2 contacts were analysed. Residue-residue contacts were also analysed for their energy contributions to HR stabilization. During residue-residue contact calculations, the contact interaction could be significant if the interaction energy was below −1.26 kJ/mol. For the identification of key residues in contacts between HR1 and HR2, the contact value and number of residues were calculated. In all of the analysed data, there was no positive or repulsive energy. After MD simulation, the total number of contacts was increased for the trimer and to a lesser extent in monomer (Table 3) . Analysis of every HR residueresidue contact revealed three different levels of interaction energy: a) high interaction energy above 10 kJ/mol, b) medium interaction energy of 4-10 kJ/mol, and c) low interaction energy of 1-4 kJ/mol. The high interaction residue contacts occurred at two positions: first, just in proximity to the N-terminal of HR2, between K1021and Q1023 of HR1 and D1261 and L1262 of HR2; second, distal to the C-terminal of HR2, including the interactions between Q994, K1000, D1282, and E1285 (Fig. 4A) . Parallel to the high interaction residues, several lines of medium interaction energy residues were observed (Fig. 4B) . These medium interaction residues were distributed at almost regular intervals starting at the end of the linker between HR1 and HR2 (residues E1039 and L1252) and at residues T1257, L1259, L1269, and D1282. Weak interaction energy contacts fill the gaps between the previously described high and medium interaction contacts. This described profile applies to both monomer and trimer. However, in trimer there was an additional high-energy interaction at the start of the linker region. Therefore, it is suggested to consider the interaction energy of residues during the design of new antiviral membrane fusion agents based on Table 3 The secondary structure content, total surface area and residues contacts of MERS CoV S2 monomer and trimer before or after MD simulation. M. Kandeel et al. Computational Biology and Chemistry 75 (2018) 205-212 short peptides. CAD scores were used to assess the changes in structures after MD simulation, compared to the initial conformation. Similarities and differences in contact areas were plotted on a colour scale of blue, white, and red corresponding to the range from agreement to difference between structures. The superimposed contact map revealed more changes in contacts for monomer of MERS CoV S2 (Fig. 5) . In monomer, the residues with major changes in contact were ASP1053, ASP1059, GLU1062, SER1064, ARG1067, and GLY1068. In trimer, major contact changes were observed in ARG1067, GLY1068, I1070, and ASN1111. Analysis of A-A contacts revealed a wider area of contact changes in monomer from GLY1045 to LEU1085, while in trimer more restricted distances were seen from GLN1063 to PHE1073. The CAD score was higher for trimer than monomer (Table 4 ). This agrees with the lower RMSD for trimer and indicates low perturbations in trimer and high perturbations in monomer. The residues showing red spots on CAD superimposition plots also had the highest RMSDs in both monomer and trimer. This indicates the feasibility of using RMSD for evaluation of structural changes. Fig. 6 shows local contact area differences plotted on a colour scale for both MERS CoV S2 monomer and trimer before and after MD. Monomer showed more dispersed red spots, indicating larger changes in contact areas. While A-A analysis shows small areas of contact changes, A-S and S-S determinations show larger contact area changes. The secondary structure content of HR is shown in Table 3 . Helices and coils are the major constituents of HR. After MD simulation, the helix% was increased in both monomer and trimer on the expense of coils. Despite the differences recorded between monomer and trimer during MD simulation, little or no significant change was observed in their secondary structure contents. This suggests that the components of HR retain their full helical or secondary structures even before trimerization.
