Our initial experiments were focused on the three-component reaction of 1,3-indandione 1 (1 mmol), isatin 2a (1 mmol), and N,N-dimethylaniline 3 (1 mmol) as a simple model substrate using different catalysts in refluxing EtOH, and the results are listed in Table 1 . It was observed that when HOAc, p-TSA, ZnCl 2 , CAN, and InCl 3 were used, it led to the formation of 5 as major product and desired product 4a as a minor product in a low yield (Table 1) . AlCl 3 showed better selectivity for 4a in comparison to 5. LiClO 4 was found to be the best catalyst for the synthesis of unsymmetrical oxindole 4a. As can be seen from Table 1 , when the amount of the LiClO 4 increased from 5 to 10, and 15 mol %, the yields increased from 80 to 95 and 96%, respectively. It was found that 10 mol % LiClO 4 in EtOH is sufficient to push this reaction forward (Table 1 , entry 2). More amounts of the LiClO 4 (15 mol %) did not improve the yields and decreasing the amount of LiClO 4 (5 mol %) resulted in a decrease in the yield of 4a and increase in the yield of 5. When this reaction was carried out without LiClO 4 the yield of the product was Trace even after 7 h (entry 10). Then, we examined the solvent effect on the LiClO 4 -catalyzed model reaction. The results of Table 2 demonstrate that solvent affected the efficiency of the reaction and EtOH was the best choice of solvent (Table 2 ). In other solvents, such as CH 3 CN, CH 2 Cl 2 , THF, H 2 O, and CHCl 3 , low yield of 4a was obtained with significant formation of 5. Therefore, the use of the commercially available, inexpensive, and easily handled LiClO 4 in EtOH provides a convenient procedure for the synthesis of unsymmetrical oxindole 4a under neutral and simple conditions. To study the generality of this protocol, a library of nine substituted 2-(3-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)-2-oxoindolin-3-yl)-1H-indene-1,3(2H)-diones 4aei were built using 1,3-indandione 1, isatins 2aei, and N,N-dimethylaniline 3 ( Table 3 ). All compounds are stable solids whose structures were established by IR, 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The plausible mechanism of this FriedeleCrafts type reaction is given in Scheme 2. Aromatic amine 3 reacts with isatin 2 to generate an intermediate 6, followed by a nucleophilic addition with 1,3-indandione 1 to afford unsymmetrical oxindole 4. Compound 5 was also formed by the attack of another molecule of 3 on intermediate 6. To further explore the potential of the reaction, we investigated the reaction of acenaphthylene-1,2-dione 7 and ninhydrin 8 instead of isatin 2 and obtained 2-(1-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroacenaphthylen-1-yl)-1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione 9 and 2-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)-1H,1 0 H-2,2 0 -biindene-1,1 0 ,3,3 0 (2H,2 0 H)-tetraone 10 in 73% and 60% yield, respectively (Scheme 3). It is notable, when we carried out the reaction with another cyclic 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds 11, the TLC and 1 H NMR spectra of the reaction mixture showed a combination of starting materials and numerous products; low yields of desired products 12 were obtained and compound 5 was produced as a major product (Scheme 4).
