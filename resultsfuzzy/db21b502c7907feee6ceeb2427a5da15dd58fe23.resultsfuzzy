Some representative oral infective dose data for enteric bacteria, based upon numerous studies using nonuniform techniques, are presented in Table IX (adapted from  Bryan, 1977) . Although the terms, "infective dose," "minimal infectious dose," etc., are used in the literature, it is obvious from Table IX that these are misnomers, and that we are really dealing with dose-response relationships, where the dose is the number of cells to which the human is exposed, and the response is lack of infection, infections without illness, and infection with ill ness (in an increasing proportion of the test subjects). The response is affected by many factors, making it highly variable. Some of the most important factors are briefly discussed below. (1) The site of exposure determines what types of defense mechanisms are available, e.g., alveolar macrophages and leuko cytes in the lungs, and acidity and digestive enzymes in the stomach. The effect of acidity is clearly shown by the cholera (Vibrio cholerae) data in Table IX,  found 10 tuleremia organisms injected to be comparable to 10^ by mouth. (2) Previous exposure to a given pathogen often produces varying degrees of immunity to that pathogen, through the induction of specific immune responses. A study in Bangladesh showed that repeated ingestion of small inocula (ΙΟ^-ΙΟ 4 orga nisms) of Vibrio cholerae produced subclinical or mild diarrheal infection followed by specific antibody production. For this reason the peak incidence of endemic cholera occurs in the one to four-year-old age group, and decreases with age thereafter as immunity developed (Levine, 1980). Other host factors, such as age and general health, also affect the disease response. Infants, elderly persons, malnourished people, those with concomitant illness, and people taking antiinflammatory, cytotoxic, and immunosuppressant drugs would be more susceptable to pathogens. An example of human variability (possibly genetic) is the following response of men orally challenged with several different doses of Salmonella typhi (Hornick et al., 1970): Papovaviruses have been found in urine, and may be asso ciated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), but are poorly understood (Warren, 1979). They found no significant correlation between the presence of virus in groundwater and levels of bacterial indicators, i.e., total bacteria, fecal coliforms, and fecal streptococci. The subsequent die-off, estimated to be about one log every 40 sec (Sorber, 1976), is determined primarily by solar radiation, temperature, and relative humidity (Lance and Gerba, 1978). The effect of relative humidity appears to depend upon the lipid content of viruses, lipid-containing viruses surviving better at low humidities, and those without lipids (e.g., most of the enteric viruses) surviving better at high humidities (Carnow et al., 1979) . Sorber (1976) has estimated that, under the least desirable meteorological conditions studied, less than The results of these two studies are summarized in Table  XIII. The results obtained from these two studies are highly variable, but it appears reasonable to make use of the Pleasanton aerosol virus density, i.e., 0.014/m 3 , to make human exposure estimates, since (1) the Pleasanton wastewater virus level is similar to that in United States wastewaters in general (cf . Table XI From these data it can be concluded that an adult male, engaged in light work, breathing at a rate of 1.2 m 3 /hr, and exposed to 0.014 PFU/m 3 at 50 m downwind from a sprayer, would inhale approximately 0.13 PFU of enterovirus during an 8 hr work day. This is probably an insignificant level of exposure. However, the recovery of enteric viruses from environmental samples is not perfectly efficient. Since isolation of viruses increases as more cell culture types are used, and some enteric viruses cannot yet be isolated on cell cultures, the actual exposure to enteric viruses may be as much as ten to a hundred times the reported level (Teltsch et al. , 1980) . Thus, it might be prudent to recommend a 100 m or 200 m minimum exposure distance of the general public to a land treatment spray source. temperatures decrease survival time (Sagik et al., 1978) . The soil is a complex medium, however, with fluctuations in soil moisture, temperatures, pH, ionic strength, dissolved gas concentrations, nutrient concentra tions, etc., which may be caused by meteorological changes, by the action of other soil organisms, or by the activities of metazoans including humans (Duboise et al., 1979) , and under standing of the behavior of viruses in soil will be slow developing. Entamoeba cysts have been found to survive several months in water at 0°C, 3 days at 30°C, 30 min at 45°C, and 5 min at 50°C (Freeman, 1979) . Giardia cysts can survive up to about 77 days in water at 8°C, 5 to 24 days at 21°C, and 4 days or less at 37°C (Bingham et al., 1979) .
