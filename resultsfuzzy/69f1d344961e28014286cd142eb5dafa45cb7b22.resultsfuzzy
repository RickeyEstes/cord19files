There were 3 key items of interest when the feasibility of the zone-within-zone isolation configurations was assessed: (1) ability to contain the source aerosol within the inner isolation zone(s); (2) ability to prevent source contaminant crossover between patient isolation zones in the 2-patient configuration; and (3) ability to maintain a lower concentration of source aerosol at the health care worker position relative to that surrounding the immediate patient position. A graph from one of the trial configurations is shown in Figure 6 . The disparity in particle counts observed at patient bed 1, the provider position, and the remaining measurement locations produces poor resolution at the lower particle counts. Figure 7 is a reduced-scale version of the same graph to allow better resolution of the particle counts measured outside patient 1's inner isolation zone. In evaluation of the ability of a tested scenario to contain the source aerosol within the inner isolation zone, the particle counts logged by the outer zone aerosol monitors were examined for concentration increases within the 1to 2-mm band corresponding to the released source aerosol. If all of the outer zone monitors reported steady or decreasing concentrations, the inner zone was considered to have contained the generated source aerosol. In the 2bed configuration trials, the potential migration of source Photograph showing a qualitative smoke test used to verify the airflow path across patient head position and toward the HEPA filtration unit's inlet.
