terial contamination in serum that has been improperly collected or stored, or to the high lipid content of serum taken too soon after a fatty meal. The anticomplementary activity can sometimes be removed by heating, by absorption with kaolin, or by absorption with excess complement followed b y heating. 2. The viral antigen preparation may be anticomplementary, i.e., it fixes complement even in the absence of antiviral serum. This does not commonly occur, except with mouse brain extracts (togaviruses). The offending lipids can be removed with acetone or fluorocarbon. 3. The viral antigen preparation may fix complement "nonspecifically" as a result of interaction between cellular antigens and anticellular antibodies in the serum. Such problems can be avoided by proper care in the selection of host species for the growth of virus and the preparation of antisera, respectively. 4. O n the other hand, anticomplementary activity of serum may indicate the presence of immune complexes in the circulation, which may bind complement in vivo. Since such antigen-antibody complexes may play an important role in pathogenesis (see Chapter 10) it is necessary to differentiate their presence from nonspecific anticomplementary activity of the types just mentioned. The crude preparations of virus (e.g., cell culture supernatants) employed as antigen in most CF tests contain besides virions, "soluble" antigens, corresponding to unassembled components of the virion and also virus-coded nonvirion proteins. Antibodies to all these antigens may be present in convalescent sera and will register by CF. Accordingly, the CF test, as usually performed, will demonstrate substantial "crossing" between serotypes with a given group of viruses if those serotypes share common group ("family") antigens (e.g., adenoviruses). In this sense, it is not a highly specific test, since it does not always allow one to discriminate between antibodies to different serotypes. It is also not a particularly sensitive test, in that antibody titers determined by CF are lower than those obtained in neutralization or HI tests on the same serum. Yet, this is the test of choice for the preliminary screening of a serum for antibody, when one has little idea of even the group to which the causative virus belongs. For example, a single CF test using any adenovirus serotype as antigen will detect serum antibodies provoked by any other adenovirus serotype. Once "groupspecific" antibodies have been determined in this way, the neutralization or HI test can be invoked to identify "type-specific" antibodies, should that information be required. 


Section:plate 2-7. complement fixation test, (liters are expressed as reciprocals of dilutions.) the example illustrates the results of examination of three consecutive serum samples from a patient with aseptic meningitis complicated by herpes simplex infection of the lip (s-l, s-7', and s-21, serum taken, respectively, on day 1, 7, and 21 following admission to hospital). following heating at 56°c for 30 minutes to inactivate complement, each serum was diluted in twofold steps from 1/8 to 1/512. a standard dose of antigen (inactivated mumps or herpes simplex virus) and complement (two hemolytic units) was added to each cup, and allowed to stand at 4°c overnight. sheep erythrocytes, "sensitized" by addition of "hemolysin" (rabbit antiserum against sheep erythrocytes), were then added, and the tray incubated at 37°c for 45 minutes. where complement has been fixed, there is no lysis, and the red blood cells have sedimented to the bottom of the cup. titration of the complement used in the test is shown in the lowest row (c). interpretation: (1) the rising titer of antibody against mumps antigen confirms the diagnosis of mumps meningitis. (2) the unchanged titer of antibody against herpes simplex antigen indicates that the herpes labialis represented a recrudescence of a previously existing infection. (courtesy i. jack.)
