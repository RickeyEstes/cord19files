As part of the standard of care, the collecting facility generally drew and tested two independent blood samples, each of which was inoculated into a blood culture bottle set consisting of one aerobic and one anaerobic bottle. Performance of multiple cultures is common practice to increase sensitivity and to discriminate between contamination events and clinically relevant detections. Contamination is generally characterized by single, unrepeated detections of common contaminants such as coagulase-negative staphylococci, viridans group streptococci, and species of the Corynebacterium, Bacillus, Micrococcus, and Propionibacterium genera. BSI is generally characterized by single or repeated detections of organisms strongly associated with BSI, such as MRSA, KPC, or VRE, or repeated detection of the same potential contaminant organism [40, 41, 42, 13, 43, 44] . In this study, culture results from a single blood culture bottle set were compared to IRI-DICA BAC BSI Assay results from a single test sample, as only one sample was collected from each subject for testing on the IRIDICA System. In cases where the test sample was obtained from the same venipuncture as a sample used to inoculate a specific blood bottle set and that pairing was clearly documented, the associated culture result was used as the comparator. In cases where the specific link between test sample and clinical sample could not be confirmed (approximately one third of cases), the first reported culture result from the same day was used as the comparator. When available, results from secondary culture bottle sets and other species-specific pathogen identification results from patient chart data were used to assess IRI-DICA BAC BSI Assay-positive, culture-negative discrepancies. As discussed above, single positive detections of common contaminant organisms are of questionable clinical relevance, and the specificity of culture for these organisms is known to be low [40, 41, 42, 13, 43, 44] . Therefore, comparisons between culture and the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay were made both with and without consideration of common contaminant organisms. When both culture and the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay reported the presence of a bacterial species associated with one of the drug resistance markers targeted by the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay, IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay resistance marker results were compared to phenotypic and/ or genotypic resistance data reported by the clinical laboratory as part of post-culture standard-of-care isolate characterization. In cases where either the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay or culture were negative for these bacteria, no resistance comparisons could be made because both methods report resistance markers or phenotypes only in association with specific bacterial detections.
