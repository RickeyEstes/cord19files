We can visualize the critical care transfer network and assess how well the network achieves public health goals. Visualization ofthe Network: Figure This initial test provides little graphical support for hypothesis H2 (satellites of a single center). Centralization or Load Sharing: Graphical evidence indicates that transfers are funneled toward central hospitals with a cardiac surgery capacity ( Fig   I, bottom left, E) . This is consistent with the goals of regionalization (supporting hypothesis H3) and counter to a "load-sharing" alternative hypothesis of the function of transfers. In the Connecticut data, the density is 11% (95% binomial confidence interval,9.0 to 13.3),meaning that 11% of all hospital-ta-hospitalpairings are reflected in an observed patient transfer. ., . tionships are formed. In Table 3 to 300% increase in their usual receipt of transfers. One hospital would become isolated and need a new transfer recipient. Hospitals with additional ICU beds at baseline receive more patients, but the correlation is imperfect (Pearson product moment correlation = 0.595, P = 0.007) [ Table 3 ].
