Between 2010 and 2014, there were 5662 subjects enrolled in the ILI-002 study; 33 patients did not have respiratory samples available F I G U R E 1 Respiratory syncytial virus infections in subjects included during four seasons in the ILI-002 study F I G U R E 2 Respiratory syncytial virus seasonality according to the viral subtype and presence of coinfection for viral testing, and therefore, the final sample size for analysis was 5629 subjects. Of these subjects, there were 570 (10.7%) cases with RSV infection: 407 with RSV A infection, 157 with RSV B, and six in whom both RSV A and B were detected (Fig. 1) . RSV cases were detected throughout the study period. However, a marked seasonality was observed with a high number of cases during the fall and winter and a decrease in detections during spring and summer (Fig. 2) . RSV A was the predominant virus between 2010 and 2012, but in seasons between 2012 and 2014, both RSV subtypes circulated simultaneously. The characteristics of patients with RSV infection were compared to those of all other patients enrolled in the ILI-002 study ( Table 1) . The age group affected more frequently by RSV was that of children 0-5 years of age; 66.84% of RSV infections occurred in children in this age group, while 30% occurred in adults and 3.16% in children 6-17 years of age; 24.6% (381/1550) of respiratory tract infections in children <5 years were caused by RSV as compared to 4.7% (18/379) of children older than 5 years and 4.6% (171/3700) of adults. Also, the proportion of cases seen as outpatients was lower in patients with RSV infection compared to those in which this virus was not detected, while the proportion of ICU admissions was higher (Table 1) . In 159 (28%) patients, another pathogen was detected in addition to RSV. In 136 of these patients, there was one additional pathogen detected, while in 22 cases there were two, and in one case, there were three; these included rhinovirus (n=61), coronaviruses (n=30), parainfluenza viruses (n=17), influenza A (n=17), influenza B (n=12), adenovirus (n=12), metapneumovirus (n=11), Bordetella pertussis (n=11), Mycoplasma (n=6), and bocavirus (n=6). The proportions of infections caused by each RSV subtype and the presence of coinfections, according to the age group, are shown in Fig. 3 . We compared the characteristics of infections caused by RSV A and RSV B to assess whether there were significant clinical differences between them (Table 2) ; the six cases with coinfection with RSV A and B were excluded from this analysis. We did not find any differences in the medical history between patients with RSV A and RSV B infections. We also compared the frequency of each symptom between patients with RSV A and RSV B infections; no significant differences were observed for any of the symptoms that were recorded (including fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue, headache, myalgias, eye symptoms, sneezing, rhinorrhea, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, malaise, and irritability) (data not shown). In addition, we compared the clinical characteristics of patients with and without coinfection with other pathogens (Table 3) . Differences in the age group distribution were noted between cases with and without coinfection with other pathogens: The proportion of pediatric cases was higher for those infections caused by RSV only, while a larger proportion of coinfections was noted in adults. Most symptoms were as frequent in patients with infections caused by RSV only compared to those with coinfections (data not shown); however, there were differences in the frequencies of some symptoms:
