We employed 12 T-cell epitope prediction algorithms to conduct computational identification of HLA-A2/A0201-restricted T-cell epitopes for HIV p24 and influenza virus matrix proteins, for which class I restricted epitopes have been determined experimentally. The candidate T-cell epitopes identified by at least 4 prediction algorithms and their binding free energy scores with MHC and TCR are shown in Tables 1 and 2, including 24 and 25 peptides in HIV p24 and influenza virus matrix proteins, respectively. Naturally, we consider the peptide without binding to either the TCR ␣ or ␤ chains as a non-epitope. On the other hand, we take the peptide, whose binding free energy scores with MHC, TCR ␣ and ␤ chains are all negative, as the T-cell epitopes. Hence, 7 peptides (p19, p20, p104, p117, p134, p141 and p214) are predicted as HLA-A2/A0201-restricted 9-mer T-cell epitopes of HIV p24 protein (Table 1) , and 10 peptides (inf3, inf51, inf58, inf59, inf60, inf107, inf123, inf138, inf178 and inf211) are predicted as HLA-A2/A0201restricted 9-mer T-cell epitopes of influenza virus matrix protein (Table 2) . By searching the HIV Molecular Immunology Database (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/immunology/) and MHCBN Database (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/mhcbn/), which consists of 20,000+ MHC binding and non-binding peptides, only 3 peptides (p19, p20 and p214) ( Table 1) are HLA-A2/A0201restricted 9-mer T-cell epitopes for HIV p24 protein, and 5 peptides (inf3, inf51, inf58, inf59 and inf60) ( Table 2) are HLA-A2/A0201restricted 9-mer T-cell epitopes for influenza virus matrix protein. Thus, using at least 4 epitope prediction methods alone, for HIV p24 protein only 3 out of 24 peptides (Table 1 ) are correctly predicted resulting in a prediction accuracy of 12.5%. For influenza virus matrix protein only 5 out of 25 peptides (Table 2 ) are correctly predicted resulting in a prediction accuracy of 20%. In particular, p144 is predicted to be an epitope by 11 methods (Table 1) , but has been characterized as non-epitope experimentally (Sylvester-Hvid et al., 2004) (biochemical binding assay). On the other hand, when using at least 4 epitope prediction methods in combination with molecular docking technique, the prediction accuracy is greatly improved, the predictive results of 20 peptides are consistent with experiment among 24 peptides of HIV p24 protein and 25 peptides of influenza virus matrix protein (Tables 1 and 2), that is, the prediction accuracy is 83.3% for HIV p24 protein and 80% for influenza virus matrix protein. Since such a novel approach is effective both for HIV p24 protein and for influenza virus matrix protein, we next used this approach to predict candidate T-cell epitopes for SARS-CoV S, N and M proteins, which are the major structural proteins of SARS-CoV. S mediates receptor binding and cell fusion, M is an integral membrane protein for virus budding, and N is important in providing nuclear-import signal and viral RNA packaging (Holmes, 2003) . The HLA-A2/A0201-restricted 9-mer T-cell epitopes identified by at least 4 methods for S, N and M proteins and their binding free energy scores with MHC and TCR are shown in Tables 3-5, including 18, 20 and 23 peptides in S, N and M, respectively. Based on the combination of epitope prediction methods and molecular docking technique and the same selection criteria used for HIV and Influenza proteins, 4 peptides (s208, s803, s1167 and s1202) were predicted for S protein (Table 3) , 5 peptides for N protein (n139, n220, n313, n339 and n400) ( Table 4 ) and 5 peptides for M protein (m14, m23, m25, m52 and m147) ( Table 5) as HLA-A2/A0201restricted T-cell epitopes. Among the 18 peptides identified for S protein, 10 peptides have been determined experimentally, that is, 2 peptides (s1167 and s1202) are T-cell epitopes and 8 peptides (s2, s131, s803, s897, s940, s958, s982 and s1174) are non-epitopes (Wang et al., 2004a,b ) (CTL assays both in vivo (transgenic mice and patients) and in vitro (human peripheral blood lymphocytes)). Thus, there are 9 out of 10 peptides predicted in our approach using at least 4 epitope prediction methods in combination with molecular docking technique do effectively correlate with experimental data (Table 3) . When predicted by at least 4 epitope prediction methods is used as sole criteria, only 2 out of 10 peptides are correctly predicted for S protein (Table 3 ). The predicted 3D models of s1167/s1202-MHC-TCR complex are shown in Fig. 1 . In contrast to S no experimental data are available for N protein 9-mer epitopes. Among 23 peptides identified as T-cell epitope from M protein, only peptide m88 was determined experimentally as nonepitope (Sylvester-Hvid et al., 2004) , which is consistent with the predictive result of our approach (Table 5) , similar to p144 in HIV-1 p24 protein, which is predicted as epitope by 11 epitope prediction methods, but is a non-epitope when analysed experimentally (Table 1) . It must be pointed out that the evaluation of different epitope prediction methods is not the objective of this paper, although the difference of performance between the present method and the past prediction methods was reported in the text. In principle, we primarily use the previous methods to narrow down the selection of candidate epitopes for further docking studies. Here we restricted our selection process to those peptides identified by at least 4 prediction methods based on the following reasons. (a) More methods generate less candidate epitopes, which does not guarantee the accuracy of prediction (even all 12 methods, as mentioned above). (b) Too many candidate epitopes will require excessive computations. Such as S protein, all 12 methods identify about 140 different candidate epitopes in total. As stated above, the 3D structure of each peptide is first predicted, then the peptide is docked into MHC molecule and a complex with correct orientation and the minimum binding free energy score is chosen from 60 conformations, finally this complex is docked into TCR molecule and a complex, in which the peptide interacts with two chains of TCR with the minimum binding free energy score, is chosen also from 60 conformations. However we believe this should be cost-effective compared to experimental assay. On the other hand, due to the fact that the binding to the MHC groove is a typical feature of an epitope, hence, it is very critical to see whether or not peptides can be properly docked to the peptide-binding groove of MHC molecules. So the present strategy is first docking peptides to MHC and then to TCR. Moreover, the docking experiments demonstrated that it is not feasible for the docking in reverse order (i.e. first dock peptides to TCR and then to MHC), because it is very difficult to re-dock the peptide interacted with two chains TCR (TCR-alpha and TCR-beta) in the complex TCR-peptide to the peptide-binding groove of MHC molecules. In conclusion, we developed a novel approach for the rapid and reliable identification of MHC class I T-cell epitopes by the combination of epitope prediction methods and molecular docking technique, which can dramatically increase the opportunity of successful identification and greatly reduce the number of peptides required for experimental assays. This approach is applicable to the whole viral genome, such as HIV, or other disease models (bacteria, cancer, etc.).
