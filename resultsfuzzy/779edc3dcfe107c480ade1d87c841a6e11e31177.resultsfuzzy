Interpreting real time PCR results is a relatively straightforward process. In a fully optimised assay all positive results should show increases in fluorescence in a characteristic exponential curve. However there are still pitfalls that we feel users should be made aware of when interpreting data. Occasionally samples may show "signal drift" (traces that increase in fluorescence as the PCR progresses but are not exponential) (Fig. 8) . Signal drift can be produced for a number of reasons. True positive samples may show signal drift because of sub optimal PCR conditions, inhibition and primer mismatches. Occasionally negative samples may also show signal drift. This may be due to probe breakdown resulting in a fluorescence increase. Signal drift often occurs towards the end of the PCR reaction. Some platforms allow multicomponent analysis of weak positive traces. This allows users to assess the changes of each fluorescent label in the reaction. Genuine positive traces will show an exponential increase in the fluorescent signal whereas signal drift is often due to a change in the normalisation dye (e.g., ROX). We currently repeat all positive samples with Ct's greater than 35 cycles as we feel these may be either low copy number positive samples or non-specific reactions. Some 96 well real time plates require sealing with optically clear plate seals before PCR can take place. On occasion these may not seal properly and PCR reagents evaporate during cycling. As a result of this a curve may be produced mimicking a positive PCR reaction. The correct placing of the threshold line is essential to allow accurate C T measurement. Some of the computer software available with current real time PCR formats can automatically place the threshold line during result analysis. Any sample with fluorescence above this line will be regarded as positive by the computer. Always check the automatic placement of the threshold line as we have found that sometimes the computer will place it wrongly resulting in both false positive and negative results (Fig. 9 ). An alternative is to use a fixed threshold line. The use of such a system will ensure the real time assay is directly comparable to previous runs This should not preclude careful analysis of the data. The increased sensitivity of real time PCR means that, like nested PCR, occasionally positive results will be obtained that Fig. 8 . Example of negative samples showing signal drift. The two sample shown in blue are showing an increases in flourescence when examined using the quantification option (shown above left). Analysis of the raw cycling data (shown above right) shows that there is no increase in flourescence usually associated with a positive sample. are not in keeping with accepted knowledge. For example, herpes viruses in throat swabs should be interpreted with care. We often detect low positive EBV, HHV-6, HSV or CMV in throat swabs in cases of respiratory infection. Whether these are the cause of disease or unrelated re-activations are unclear. Although these findings may be irrelevant to the clinical illness it is important that these results are not ignored. For as we gain more experience with these sensitive assays we may identify new, previously unrecognised syndromes attributed to particular viral pathogens.
