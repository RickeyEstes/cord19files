Expression levels of transduced CFTR in CF HAE were determined by comparing the levels of exogenous CFTR mRNA ) and GFP expression assessed at 24 h pi. GFP was detected by indirect immunofluorescence with rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibodies (Ab) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein (green). Ciliated cells were identified using mouse primary Ab against acetylated atubulin and detected with anti-mouse IgG-Texas Red (red). GFP colocalized to cells that were also positive for acetylated a-tubulin, confirming the targeting of ciliated cells in vitro and ex vivo by PIV. Bar represents 20 mm in (A); and 5 mm in (B, C, and D). doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1000155.g001 expressed by PIVCFTR relative to endogenous CFTR mRNA in CF HAE and non-CF HAE using quantitative RT-PCR. Previously, it has been estimated that human airway cells contain only approximately 10 CFTR transcripts/cell [19] . In our experiments, we found that CF HAE inoculated with PIVCFTR produced a 236-fold increase in CFTR mRNA when compared to cultures inoculated with PIVGFP or mock ( Figure 3A ). Since this large-fold increase in CFTR mRNA is in part reflective of the low endogenous copy number of CFTR, we also assessed CFTR protein levels semiquantitatively by western blot. CF HAE (C) Representative confocal images of CFTR immunoreactivity in CF HAE (i and ii), and non-CF HAE (iii and iv), 48 h after inoculation with PIVGFPCFTR (i and iii) or PIVGFP (ii and iv). CFTR was detected with CFTR monoclonal Ab (clone 596) and secondary Abs conjugated to AlexaFluor 594 (red). CF HAE inoculated with PIVGFPCFTR (i) showed immunolocalization of CFTR at apical domains of ciliated cells that were also GFP-positive, but not in GFP-negative ciliated cells or in CF HAE infected with PIVGFP (ii). Robust apical domain CFTR and GFP were detected in non-CF HAE ciliated cells inoculated with PIVGFPCFTR and endogenous CFTR levels detected in GFP-negative ciliated cells (iii, arrowheads). Endogenous CFTR was detected at the apical membranes of GFP-positive and -negative ciliated cells after inoculation with PIVGFP (iv, arrowheads). Bar inoculated with PIVCFTR expressed large amounts of mature CFTR ( Figure 3B , lane 3, band C), whereas no mature CFTR protein was detected in CF HAE inoculated with vehicle alone (lane 1) or PIVGFP (lane 2). Serial 10-fold dilutions of total protein lysates of CF HAE inoculated with PIVCFTR (lanes 4 and 5) provided a semiquantitative measurement of the amounts of exogenous CFTR protein in CF HAE compared to CFTR protein levels in non-CF HAE (lane 6). We estimate that an approximately 50-fold increase in mature CFTR protein in transduced CF HAE was achieved compared to non-CF HAE. Therefore, two independent measures of CFTR abundance indicate a significant overexpression of both CFTR mRNA and protein in transduced CF HAE. Note, these measures are likely an underestimate given that not all ciliated cells are infected by PIVCFTR. Because approximately 60% of ciliated cells were infected in these experiments, and ciliated cells on average comprise approximately 70% of surface cells within a culture, we estimate that individual infected ciliated cells likely overexpress CFTR protein by at least 100-fold over non-CF ciliated cells. Apical localization and overexpression of CFTR above endogenous levels in ciliated cells was confirmed by immunodetection of CFTR in CF HAE and non-CF HAE ( Figure 3C ). For these studies, we chose to engineer both GFP and CFTR into a single PIV vector (PIVGFPCFTR) to enable identification of infected cells by GFP fluorescence. In CF HAE infected with PIVGFPCFTR, CFTR was immunolocalized only to ciliated cells that were also positive for GFP ( Figure 3Ci ) and concentrated in apical membrane domains at the base of the cilial shafts. Although endogenous CFTR in non-CF ciliated cells in vitro is localized to these regions [3] , subapical membrane CFTR immunoreactivity was also detected after PIVGFPCFTR, likely suggesting the increased presence of CFTR in recycling endosomes. Infection of CF HAE with PIVGFP alone showed that ciliated cells positive for GFP were negative for CFTR immunoreactivity (Figure 3Cii ). When non-CF HAE were infected by PIVGFPCFTR, endogenous CFTR was present in GFP-negative ciliated cells and overexpressed in GFP-positive cells ( Figure 3Ciii ). For non-CF HAE infected with PIVGFP, GFP-positive and -negative ciliated cells showed only endogenous CFTR apical membrane immunoreactivity ( Figure 3Civ ). CFTR (endogenous or PIV-delivered), GFP, or PIV antigens were never detected in cell types that did not posses cilia ( Figure S3 ). To determine whether PIV-mediated CFTR delivery to ciliated cells resulted in functional CFTR anion channel activity in CF HAE, we maximally stimulated cAMP-mediated anion transport capacity using forskolin (Fsk), an activator of CFTR. Figure 3D shows bioelectric short-circuit current (I sc ) traces obtained in Ussing chamber experiments with CF HAE inoculated with mock (vehicle alone), PIVGFP, or PIVCFTR. For comparison, a I sc trace from a non-CF HAE is also shown. Whereas I sc responses to Fsk were not observed in mock-or PIVGFP-inoculated CF HAE, CF HAE inoculated with PIVCFTR exhibited rapid and sustained increases in I sc that were rapidly inhibited by a CFTR-specific inhibitor (CFTR 172 [20] ). Experiments using CF cells derived from four different donors revealed that the kinetics and magnitudes of the Fsk responses in PIVCFTR-corrected CF HAE were indistinguishable from those observed for non-CF HAE ( Figure 3D and 3E; range 6.7-42.0 mA/cm 2 for PIVCFTR, 0-1.5 mA/cm 2 for CF HAE controls [mock and PIVGFP] and 7.8-70.3 mA/cm 2 for non-CF HAE). An additional control using PIV expressing the nonfunctional CFTR mutant DF508CFTR (PIVDF508) confirmed that functional CFTR was required for bioelectric correction of CF HAE ( Figure 3E ). These data show that delivery of functional CFTR to CF ciliated cells fully restored maximally stimulated CFTR anion channel activity to normal non-CF levels. PIVCFTR did not significantly affect UTPmediated Cl 2 secretion in CF HAE beyond that of PIVGFP ( Figure S4 ).
