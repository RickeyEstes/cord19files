The expression of the S protein using a codon-optimized S gene. The spike (S) glycoprotein of the coronavirus is the major envelope protein that plays a key role in viral entry. It not only binds to the cellular receptor but also initiates membrane fusion [14] [15] [16] [17] . To develop the pseudotyped virus system for studying SARS-CoV entry, we initially transfected pTS containing the native S gene into 293T cells, but found that the expression of the S protein in transfected cells was too weak to be detected either by FACS or Western blot (Figs. 1A and B). The poor expression from the native S gene might be due to codon bias, since the native S gene had a codon usage that differed substantially from those of human genes (Fig. 1C) . We therefore synthesized a humanized S gene (TSh) in which native codons were replaced with the degenerate codons used most frequently in human genes. When the pTSh was transfected into 293T cells, the S protein could be easily detected by FACS analysis (Fig. 1A) . Western blot analysis of lysates from the pTSh transfected 293T cells showed two major protein bands that reacted with anti-S sera: a 180 kDa protein corresponding to the previously described size for the mature S protein on SARS-CoV virions [18] and a 130 kDa protein consistent with the calculated molecular weight of the nonglycosylated precursors of the S protein (Fig. 1B) .
