There were 1968 live heifer births over the period of the study. Of these, about 20% were treated for diarrhea, 15% were treated for pneumonia (with or without diarrhea), and less than 4% died (Table IV) . Based on heart-girth measurements taken on 634 calves, the average birthweight was estimated to be 45.6 kg. The estimated daffy weight gain up to two weeks of age was 0.5 kg (n=148) and up to weaning was 0.7 kg (n=244). Sixteen bulls, each having sired 25 or more calves, accounted for 52.8% of the bulls used to sire these calves. Factors relating to individual calf management are displayed in Tables V, VI and VII. Most calves were born in indoor calving pens (60%); based on data from the revised birthday forms, almost 40% of births were not attended. Overall, 8--9% of calvings required special assistance (calf jacks, caesarians, abnormal presentations); some manual assistance was given in another 40%. Most calves were born between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., with difficult calvings no more likely to occur at night than during the day. Most calves did not have their navels treated at birth, and only about 50% of them were known to receive first colostrum within 2 h of being born.  The number of calvings resulting in a lactation, per farm, from 1 October 1981 to 30 September 1982, was used as an indicator of farm size. On this basis, farm size ranged from 23 to 154 calvings per year, with a mean of 53 and a median of 45. Seventy-five percent of the farms had 60 or fewer calvings during the year. This means that approximately three-quarters of the study farms had a heifer calf population of fewer than 30 per year, or about two to three heifer calves born per farm, per month. Farm-level mortality rates and treatment days per calf are displayed in Tables VIII and IX. The fact that only 73 farms were used for calculating the rates in Winter 3 indicates that 14 farms had fewer than two heifer calves born during that season. The distribution of mortality was skewed at the farm level, that is, in any given six-month period at least half the farmers lost no live-born heifer calves from birth to weaning, with mortality rates ranging from zero to 67%. Farm morbidity rates were similarly skewed, with half the farmers administering less than one treatment day per calf in a given season. This suggests that many farmers had few disease problems with their calves, whereas a few had moderate to severe problems. Correlations of morbidity rates from one season with those of the next indicated significant consistency from season to season and year to year (r values ranged from 0.28 to 0.82). No similar consistency was observed for mortality rates. Some results of the initial questionnaire on farm management policies are summarized in Tables X to XII. No major changes in policies occurred over the three years of the project. There was a slight shift toward the use of more routine preventive treatments (vaccines, vitamins, antimicrobials) in both dams and calves, although the increase in vaccine use in the final winter of the study was primarily attributable to participation in the vaccine field trial. In the second year of the study, farmers gave lower estimates about the proportion of calvings they usually attended. For both summer and winter, there was a shift away from group pens (which initially comprised almost one quarter of calf housing systems) to hutches and individual pens. There was also a decreased use of both milk replacer and milk, and an increased use of sour colostrum, as the primary calf feed. In the regression of the proportion of calves treated on treatment days per calf, the best fit to the data (based on inspection of residuals) was obtained using natural log transformations of both variables, with the model being Y = 0.55X -1.21, where Y is the natural logarithm (ln) of the proportion of calves treated and X is the In of the number of treatment days per calf. The R 2 for the model was 0.755 (F=101.4, with 1,33 df; P~:0.0001).
