The aim of this study is to derive 3D-QSAR models for a set of 62 compounds with 2-imino-thiazolidin-4-one scaffold ( Table 1 ) in order to identify the structural features essential for the interaction of the compounds with S1P 1 and S1P 3 receptors. The obtained results could be used for identifying new ligands active on S1P 1 receptors in database search and drug design studies. In the current study, the crystal structure of S1P 1 receptor in complex with an antagonist was used for virtual screening to identify S1P 1 agonists. It has been elucidated that GPCRs adopt active or inactive structure upon binding to either an agonist or an antagonist, respectively. Up to now, the structure of S1P 1 with an agonist has not been solved experimentally, therefore, the antagonist-bound S1P 1 structure was used in the current study. To examine how different might be the active and inactive forms of S1P 1 receptor, the active and inactive structures of closely related GPCR was investigated. The basic local alignment tool (BLAST) was employed to search protein data bank for structurally known homologous GPCRs. The search identified adenosine A2A receptor bound to an antagonist (PDB code: 3PWH) as one of the closest homologues of S1P 1 receptor (28.67% identity, 85% coverage, and 2 Â 10 À23 E-value). As a matter of fact, the structure of adenosine A2A receptor could have been used as the template for homology modeling of S1P 1 receptor if there was no experimental structure for S1P 1 itself. There are two other structures for adenosine A2A receptor co-crystallized with agonist ligands (PDB IDs: 3QAK and 2YDO). Assuming agonist and antagonist bound structures of receptor representing the active and inactive forms, calculation of the Ca RMSDs between the adenosine A2A active and inactive forms revealed that they are very similar (RMSD values of 3QAK and 2YDO active structures against 3PWH inactive structure are 1.37 and 1.33 Å), which is comparable to the difference between two active structures (RMSD value of 0.82 Å). The structures of adenosine A2A receptor in active and inactive forms are compared in Fig. 2 . These observations for the most identical GPCR with known structure to the S1P 1 receptor indicate the viability of using antagonist-bound S1P 1 receptor structure for the purpose of current study, and it may not be feasible to distinguish fine structural differences between the active and inactive forms of the receptor by MD simulations. Moreover, in this study, semi-flexible docking procedure was utilized for the docking of ligands retrieved from the database structure similarity search.
