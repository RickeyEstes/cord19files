Cluster heat map. The overall gene expression was classified by heat map analysis and several regions of interest (ROI; the most different areas) were selected from the complete map (Fig. 1A ). The cluster similarity was similar for the results obtained at 12 and 4 weeks in the same treatment groups in the majority of clusters ( Fig. 1) , suggesting that the gene expression pattern was similar in animals in the same treatment groups. Of note, the gene expression in LPD was up-or downregulated in the opposite direction to LPN, at 4 and 12 weeks (Fig. 1B ). In addition, the genes associated with osteogenesis, including interleukin (IL)1A, collagen type II α1 chain (COL2A1), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and C-type lectin domain family 3 member A (CLEC3A) were included in these differential zones ( Fig. 2A-C) . The cluster heat map can directly display the general information about the expression levels of genes and the ROI can be easily selected from the differential genes zone. The data revealed that the cluster similarity was nearly identical between 4 and 12 weeks in each of the LPN, LPD and UTR groups, indicating that the different treatments can distinctively alter the gene expression patterns. There are certain specific muscle contraction associated genes including myosin light chain 2, myosin heavy chain (MYH)2, troponin C1 (TNNC1), MYH6 and actin α1 that were downregulated in LPD, suggesting that the LPM may serve an important role in the pathogenesis of traumatic TMJA. As bony ankylosis was the principal focus of the present study, the genes associated with osteogenesis were of particular interest. Based on the heat map, the IL1A, COL2A1, COMP and CLEC3A were preliminarily selected as potential critical genes. Scatter plot. The scatter plot was used to illustrate the genes expression distribution between two different groups. At 4 weeks, it was evident that the majority of genes in LPN were significantly upregulated, irrespective of whether it was being compared with LPD or UTR ( Fig. 3A and B) . However, the LPD and UTR exhibited near-identical expression patterns (Fig. 3C) . Additionally, at 12 weeks, the LPN group exhibited an increased number of downregulated genes when compared with the LPD group (Fig. 3D ) and there were more upregulated genes in the LPN group compared with the UTR group (Fig. 3E ). Whereas the LPD group had more upregulated genes compared with UTR at the 12 weeks stage (Fig. 3F) . The scatter plot can give direct insight into the number of up-and downregulated genes between two groups. Generally, in the present study, the LPN group exhibited a higher expression of active genes in the early stage, whereas more genes were activated in the LPD group at the later stage. Although the exact number of altered genes cannot be ascertained from the scatter plot, it corroborated the authors' hypothesis that genes associated with osteogenesis are dominant. During the process of DO, rapid osteogenesis is occurring in the first month, which may limit the degree to which the mouth can open and decrease the force of LPM (15) . As a result, the DO effect of LPM is weakened and returns to a stable state. Therefore, most genes are upregulated at an early stage and are then subsequently downregulated. Conversely, the dissection of LPM makes it similar to the normal bone fracture healing process and the majority of the osteogenesis associated genes are activated in a relatively late stage. However, the exact differential genes involved in this process require further analysis. DAVID and GO enrichment analysis. In order to determine the specific differential genes in differing treatments, DAVID gene classification and GO enrichment analysis were performed. The DAVID Bioinformatics Resources can be used to categorize the differential genes through different filters, which is extensively used for systematical analysis of large gene lists (16) (17) (18) . The GO term enrichment analysis can group the differential genes by different biological processes and determine which genes are significant (19, 20) . The genes were categorized by DAVID Bioinformatics Resources and more than 2-fold altered genes were considered different. Then the representative specific osteogenesis associated genes were listed. In LPN vs LPD at 4 weeks, the COL2A1, COMP, CLEC3A, calpain 3 and fibromodulin genes were upregulated up to >3-fold (Table I) . From the GO term enrichment data, the bone morphogenesis and endochondral bone growth were the most notable, in which COMP and (Table II) . It has previously been reported that the bone formed by DO is formed via intramembranous ossification (21) , in which COL2A1 is involved (22) . Taken together, these data indicate that the LPN group may be similar to the DO process and the genes associated with intramembranous ossification are activated at early stages. In addition, muscle contraction was also significantly upregulated in the LPN compared with the LPD group (P<0.05; Table II ), which may be attributed to the function of LPM. In LPN vs. UTR at 4 weeks, not only COMP and CLEC3A were upregulated but cluster of differentiation (CD)180, Toll-like receptor 7, histidine rich calcium binding protein and ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) genes were also significantly increased, while the expression of S100 calcium binding
