Data generated by an HM program should be reviewed by an individual at the institution who understands the biology of the agents and the scientific goals of the rodent users and is responsible for the overall biosecurity program. This person should examine the data for anomalous or unexpected findings and then initiate appropriate action. Actions might include report filing or data compilation if no actionable results are received, communication with the testing laboratory for all unexpected or actionable results, or notification of other responsible individuals at the institution. Because of the significant consequences of many infections and the equally significant consequences of erroneously taking action in situations where no infection exists, the first step should always be to contact the testing laboratory prior to executing any eradication plan or other research-inhibiting actions. The testing laboratory cannot only give some idea of the level of confidence in the results (i.e., was it a strong positive versus nearthreshold result? Does that particular assay often give FP results? Is the positive predictive value of the result low because that particular agent is very rare?), but can also help plan the quickest and most definitive confirmation testing. Health reports that require the reader, often the import coordinator at a potential recipient institution, to sift through many pages to identify the room or vivarium of interest are not useful and generally end up as reams of wasted paper, even if recycled. The results of HM testing should be summarized into a one-or two-page HM report for areas within institutions (usually for individual vivaria at academic institutions). This allows for easier interpretation for import/ export of animals and less confusion by shipping and receiving institutions as to the agents tested and results obtained. A useful health report does not only give results from the most recent and historical (up to 18 months) testing but must also provide additional information about housing and maintenance procedures, any treatment provided, and the HM program and exclusion list (Nicklas et al., 2002) (Table 11 .7). It is also important to provide contact information for the person responsible for the HM program in the animal facility in case additional information is requested. Not all of these data are easily provided on a health report, and ideally institutions should also provide a one-to two-page HM program description with the HM results. It should be emphasized that a high-quality HM program is of utmost importance to institutions exporting large numbers of rodents. Having a reputation for outsourcing infectious disease outbreaks is not a winning strategy.
