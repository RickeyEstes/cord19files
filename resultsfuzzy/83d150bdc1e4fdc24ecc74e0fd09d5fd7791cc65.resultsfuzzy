We aimed to reveal a medicinal plant candidate against DENV. We extracted 70 different crude compounds from materials of 24 plants. DENV-caused respiratory disease was revealed (Rodrigues et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2007) , in addition, our previous study showed that the lung carcinoma A549 cells were well susceptible target cells for DENV, these cells have been used in the study model of viral-host interaction. Thus, A549 cells were applied as the screening model in this study (Chang, Liao & Lin, 2006) . The cytotoxic effect of the extracts was evaluated in lung carcinoma A549 cells by WST-1 cell proliferation assay. Except S. divaricatus, extracts from other 23 plants revealed no cytotoxicity effect at the maximum tested concentration, 100 µg/ml. Therefore, S. divaricatus extracts were excluded in the antiviral screening (Supplementary information, Table S1 ). (Table 1 ). In addition, leaf extracts of F. sarmentosa var. henryi showed an anti-DENV-2 effect, with IC 50 72.04±14.5 µg/ml, which was higher than for the extracts of F. septica (Table 1 ). In addition to DENV-2, the DENV-1 was inhibited by FS-(L)-M in A549 cells (IC 50 = 28 ± 10.4 µg/ml); however, the AiV infection was not affected by FS-(L)-M treatment (Figs. 1A and 1B) . DENV infection-mediated liver disorder was reported (Samanta & Sharma, 2015; Tristao-Sa et al., 2012) , therefore, the F. septica against DENV1 and DENV-2 but not AiV were also confirmed in the hematoma cell lines, HepG2 and Huh7.5 cells (Figs. 1C and 1E). Interestingly, FS-(L)-M showed more potent anti-DENV-1 and DENV-2 effect in HepG2 cells (IC 50 = 10.1 ± 2.4 µg/ml and 12.2 ± 2.1 µg/ml, respectively) then in Huh7.5 cells (IC 50 = 39.8 ± 6.9 µg/ml and 21.9 ± 3.9 µg/ml, respectively) (Figs. 1D and 1F). Moreover, skin normal fibroblasts (Wang et al., 2015) , WS1 cells were used as the non-cancerous cells for testing the anti-viral effect of FS-(L)-M. The similar results showed that the FS-(L)-M inhibited DENV-1 and DENV-2 in WS1 cells with IC 50 13.3±2.6 µg/ml and 10.6±1.1 µg/ml, respectively (Figs. 1G and 1H). A higher dose of F. septica (IC 50 41.1 ± 6.7 µg/ml) against AiV was determined in WS1 cells, which was not showed in other tested cells types. This data implicated a cell type-specific manner of AiV inhibition by F. septica. However, the precise mechanism remains to be further explored. In order to understand whether F. septica leaf extracted with methanol, FS-(L)-M, directly inactivated DENV, we preincubated viral stocks of DENV-1, DENV-2 and AiV with a series of dilution doses of FS-(L)-M for 1 h at room temperature. After virus adsorption, the mixture of virus plus the plant extract was replaced by fresh growth medium. At 42 h after infection, the virus-infected cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence assay h at room temperature before used to infect A549 cells (3 × 10 4 ) at MOI = 2.5. After 2 h of virus adsorption, the virus-compound mixture medium was replaced by fresh growth medium for further 42 h incubation. DENV-or AiVinfected cells were detected by immunofluorescence assay. (B) Fluorescence intensity was measured and quantified by the Li-Cor odyssey CLx imaging system. The data are mean ± SD from three independent experiments. *** P < 0.001 by two-tailed Student t test.
