Herein, we report results of large-scale characterization of the nasal epithelium (NE) proteome using a 2D-LC-MS strategy that relies on subcellular fractionation coupled with SCX-RPLC-MS/MS that may facilitate elucidation of putative protein markers for respiratory diseases and/or drug targets. NE specimens were obtained by a non-invasive nasal brushing procedure followed by their quality evaluation by cytology. The cytological analysis showed that most of the cells (about 85%) in a brushing sample are epithelial cells (i.e., columnar, goblet and basal cells) as previously described (results not shown) [14, 20] . Soluble and membrane-enriched fractions were obtained using differential centrifugation to increase the proteome coverage. The complete list of proteins identified in this analysis, along with their respective peptides, is provided in supplementary data (Table SD1) . A total of 535 and 1169 proteins were identified in the soluble (sNE) and membrane fractions (mNE), respectively, using criteria described in Materials and methods. A total of 222 proteins were identified in both fractions (oNE), resulting in a net identification of 1482 unique NE proteins (Fig. 1 , Table SD2 ). Annotation of primary subcellular location of identified proteins was performed based on information deposited in Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD). As anticipated, cytoplasmic proteins were predominant in the soluble fraction ( Fig. 2A) , whereas plasma membrane proteins were observed by much greater percentage in the membrane fraction (Fig. 2B) ; plasma membrane proteins represented 5.4% of those identified in both fractions (Fig. 2C ). The term integral to membrane was mainly assigned to proteins allocated to the membrane fraction ( Fig. 2B and C) . Putative transmembrane domains (TMDs) were mapped and grand average hydropathy value index (GRAVY) calculated for the identified proteins (Table SD3 ). The analysis revealed that 513 proteins contained one or more mapped TMDs. Of those, 497 proteins (96.8%) belong to NE membrane fraction, which corresponds to 52.5% of all proteins identified in membrane-enriched fraction (Fig. 3B ). Considering that 21% of proteins within the entire human proteome contain one or more putative TMDs [21] , our results represent a significant enrichment of this proteins' class. The majority of proteins with five or more predicted TMDs elicit positive GRAVY indexes (Fig. 3C ), constituting about 14% of membrane's proteome. There is, however, a significant percentage of proteins in membrane fraction with no predicted TMDs (46.7%, corresponding to 442 proteins). Observation of many structural constituents of ribosomes, components of vesicle traffic machinery and some catalytic subunits of the mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase (e.g., ATP5C1, ATP5I) and vacuolar ATPase (e.g., ATP6V1E1, ATP6V1A), located in inner mitochondrial membranes and endosomes, respectively, seems to point for a significant contamination with soluble/cytosolic proteins entrapped within membrane vesicles during the lysis step. Other factors such as the presence of membrane-attached proteins via lipid/glycolipid anchors or a deficiency in the algorithm to correctly classify all potential TMDs could be also considered. The GRAVY index calculation, a global descriptor of protein's solubility (proteins exhibiting positive GRAVY values are recognized as hydrophobic while proteins exhibiting negative GRAVY values are recognized as hydrophilic) [18] , revealed that 284 proteins (out of 1482) showed GRAVY values ranging from 0.0 to +1.2 and were found mainly in the membrane fraction. In contrast, the majority of proteins identified on the soluble and overlapping fraction had negative GRAVY (Fig. 3A ). Searching our dataset against human proteome database (UniProt Human, release March 2008) showed that 95 of the NE identified proteins had only previously been observed at the transcript level; three proteins are annotated as uncertain and one as in-silico predicted (Table SD2 -UniProt).
