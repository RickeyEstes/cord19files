The SARS-CoV genome is approximately 29.7 kb long and contains five major ORFs flanked by 5 0 and 3 0untranslated regions of 265 and 342 nucleotides, respectively (Fig. 1A) [5, 6] . The predicted S gene is located from nucleotide 21,492 to 25,259 in the SARS-CoV genome. In order to clone S gene, the 3580-bp DNA fragment containing whole S gene was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR and inserted into prokaryotic vector pET-28(+). The deduced amino acid sequence of S protein is shown in Fig. 2 . S gene had an ORF of 3768 nucleotides, capable of coding for a 1255-amino-acid polypeptide of about 138 kDa. The amino terminus of SARS-CoV S protein contained a short type I signal peptide (residue 1-13) composed of hydrophobic amino acids that are presumably removed during cotranslational transport through ER. The carboxyl terminus (residue 1196-1255) consisted of a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail rich in cysteine residues. Twenty-three potential N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted among SARS-CoV S protein. Together these data predicted that SARS-CoV S protein is a type I membrane glycoprotein with the N-terminus and the majority of the protein (residue 14-1195) on the outside of virus particle, in agreement with other coronavirus S protein data (Fig. 1B) . Multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis among S proteins of mammalian coronaviruses, which cause respiratory infection, were further performed by PileUp program of Genetics Computer Group (GCG) (Figs. 2  and 3 ). Alignment of these sequences produced a low level of similarity (20-27% pairwise amino acid identity) between the predicted amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV S protein and other coronavirus S proteins. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the species formed monophyletic clusters consistent with established taxonomic groups. However, SARS-CoV S protein sequences segregated into a well-resolved branch, indicating that SARS-CoV S protein is not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronavirus S proteins. Although overall sequence conservation was low, the C-terminus, consisting of a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail, was highly conserved. Putative cellular receptor-binding sites (residue 757-761) of SARS-CoV S protein [19] were not conserved compared with other coronaviruses. The antigenic sites of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus S protein [20, 21] were also varied among these coronaviruses. These data suggested that comparison of primary amino acid sequences does not provide insight into the receptor-binding specificity or antigenic properties of SARS-CoV S protein. By analyzing the primary structure of SARS-CoV S protein, we tried to predict the putative antigenic regions of S protein. The hydrophilicity, surface probability, and chain flexibility of SARS-CoV S protein were calculated by PeptideStructure program of GCG according to Kyte and Doolittle plots, Emini prediction, and Karplus and Schulz prediction, respectively (Fig. 4A ) [22] [23] [24] . The antigenicity of SARS-CoV S protein was further analyzed based on three aforementioned criteria, and the regions in which antigenic index exceeds 1.3 are shown in Fig. 4B . Most of the putative antigenic sites were located at outer membrane regions, in which residue 1-100 and 401-500 exhibited the highly antigenic potential. Because most T cell and B cell epitopes contain a sequence of 6-20-amino acids [25, 26] , we further analyzed the antigenicity using a window of 15 residues. Residue 12-50, 426-456, 478-494, 541-564, and 922-1118 of SARS-CoV S protein displayed the highly antigenic potential. These data suggested that these regions might be good candidates for developing SARS peptide vaccine. In order to study the antigenicity and receptorbinding ability of SARS-CoV S protein, we expressed and purified the full-length recombinant SARS-CoV S protein from E. coli. We expressed the S protein from E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS strain transformed with a pET plasmid carrying S gene. After induction with IPTG, a product with 138-kDa was observed by SDS-PAGE Fig. 3 . Phylogenetic analysis of coronavirus S proteins. Amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV S proteins were compared with those of HCoV-229E, TGEV, FIPV, HCoV-OC43, MHV, HEV, BCoV, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (GenBank Accession No. P11223), and turkey coronavirus (TCoV) (GenBank Accession No. AAQ20922). Sequence alignment and neighbor-joining tree were generated by GrowTree program of GCG using the BLOSUM comparison matrix. Coronavirus groups I, II, and III are indicated. Branch lengths are proportionate to amino acid differences. analysis (Fig. 5) . The amount of induced S protein was consistent when the bacteria were refreshed to 0.45-0.6 OD 600 and the recombinant S protein was expressed in the soluble form in bacterial cells. The soluble S protein was further purified by affinity chromatography using His-Bond resin. No detectable S protein was purified, suggesting that the histidine tag is folded into the interior of S protein (data not shown). We therefore dena-tured the S protein by urea, purified by nickel-affinity chromatography, and renatured the protein by dialysis. The amount of recombinant S protein recovered was approximately 0.2-0.3 mg/100 ml of bacterial culture (Fig. 6) . To analyze the antigenicity of recombinant S protein, we performed Western blot and ELISA using sera from SARS patients or from spike-immunized rabbits. Fig. 7 shows that recombinant S was detectable by both sera in both assays. Additionally, truncated S protein (residue 511-993) exhibited the similar antigenicity compared with full-length spike (residue 1-1255). These results indicated that recombinant S protein remains its antigenicity that could be recognized by sera from SARS patients. The receptor-binding ability of recombinant S protein was analyzed by biotinylated ELISA and Western blot. Several reports indicated that SARS-CoV could have succeeded in growing progeny virus in Vero cells [3, 5, 6] . The BSA and Vero cell extracts were therefore coated on ELISA plates and challenged with biotinlabeled S protein. The binding ability of S protein to cell extract was evaluated by OD 405 value in ELISA. Fig. 8A shows that the binding ability of S protein to BSA was very low. However, S protein significantly bound Vero cell extracts with the OD 405 exceeding 0.9. These results proved the specificity of biotinylated ELISA in analyzing the receptor-binding ability of S protein. It also suggested that recombinant S protein could be served as a probe to analyze the cellular receptors involved in virus attachment. To further identify the potential cellular receptors for SARS-CoV attachment, we performed biotinylated Western blot. The cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membrane, and detected by biotin-labeled S protein. Fig. 8B shows that recombinant S protein interacted with several cellular proteins in different cell types. By comparison of protein patterns of different cell types, we found that two proteins with molecular masses of 130 and 140 kDa were detectable in Vero cells instead of other cell types. It is now known that Vero cell is the only cell line that could be infected by SARS-CoV [3] . These results suggested that 130-kDa and 140-kDa polypeptides in Vero cells might be the cellular receptors responsible for SARS-CoV S protein binding. The elucidation of amino acid sequences of these proteins is now proceeded. In this study, we cloned, expressed, and purified the SARS-CoV S protein from E. coli. The recombinant S protein was expressed in soluble form in bacterial cells, and the amount of protein recovered was 0.2-0.3 mg/ 100 ml bacterial culture. The S protein was recognized by sera from SARS patients, indicating that recombinant S protein retained its antigenicity. By biotinylated ELISA and Western blot using recombinant S protein as the probe, we identified that 130-kDa and 140-kDa proteins might be the cellular receptors responsible for SARS-CoV infection. These results suggested that S protein could be a good candidate for further developing SARS vaccine and anti-SARS therapy.
