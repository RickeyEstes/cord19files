In sputum and transtracheal aspirates, the detection of MERS-CoV sub-genomic mRNA was more frequent in the severe group than in the mild group ( Figure 1A ). Sub-genomic mRNA was detected 28 days after the illness onset. In the severe group, the period for detecting sub-genomic mRNA strongly correlated with the duration for detecting MERS-CoV genomic RNA (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.803, p = 0.009). The MERS-CoV genomic RNA titer was significantly higher in the specimens with subgenomic mRNA detection than in those where sub-genomic mRNA was not detected (P = 0.0007) (Figure 2 ). In oropharyngeal swab specimens, sub-genomic mRNA was detected only in the severe group for up to 11 days after the illness onset ( Figure 1B) , and the period for detecting sub-genomic mRNA was not significantly correlated with that for MERS-CoV genomic RNA (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.335, p = 0.378). No subgenomic mRNA was detected in nasopharyngeal swab specimens ( Figure 1C ). In the present study, replicative MERS-CoV was detected in sputum or transtracheal aspirate for up to 4 weeks after symptom development in MERS-CoV-infected patients with severe pneumonia. This result is consistent with the findings of previous studies that have tested MERS-CoV genomic RNA (Memish et al., 2014; Corman et al., 2016; Min et al., 2016) . On the basis of these results, infection prevention and control precautions should be thoroughly applied for at least 1 month after symptom onset if the patient with MERS-CoV infection has severe pneumonia. The differences in the detection of replicative viruses between upper and lower respiratory tract specimens may have originated from differences in viral titers. Several studies have demonstrated that the viral titer of MERS-CoV RNA in upper respiratory tract specimens is lower than that in lower respiratory tract specimens (Oh et al., 2016; Corman et al., 2016) . In the present study, subgenomic mRNA was not detected in any of the nasopharyngeal specimens. The current guidelines recommend that isolation should continue until two consecutive upper respiratory tract specimens taken at least 24 h apart test negative by RT-PCR (WHO, 2018) . However, the present study suggests that, if possible, lower respiratory tract specimens should be used to determine the duration of isolation and that nasopharyngeal swab specimens should be avoided. This study has a few limitations. First, differences in sensitivity between the real-time RT-PCR used to detect genomic RNA and the conventional RT-PCR for sub-genomic mRNA may have affected the results. Second, RT-PCR methods for sub-genomic mRNA have not been validated elsewhere. Other methods, such as detecting live virus, should be performed to validate the methods used in this study. In conclusion, replicative MERS-CoV was detected in lower respiratory tract specimens for up to 4 weeks after symptom development, which was well correlated with the detection of genomic RNA. In upper respiratory tract specimens, the detection of sub-genomic mRNA and genomic RNA did not correlate. These findings suggest that MERS-CoV does not replicate well in the upper respiratory tract.
