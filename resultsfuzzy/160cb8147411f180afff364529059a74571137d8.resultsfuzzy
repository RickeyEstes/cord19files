3.1. The inhibition of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV PL pro s by disulfiram PL pro s are cysteine proteases that use the thiol group of cysteine as a nucleophile to attack the carbonyl group of the scissile peptide bond Han et al., 2005; Verma et al., 2016) . Inhibition can be expected if the catalytic cysteine of a PL pro is interfered with or modified (Cheng et al., 2015; Chou et al., 2008) . Disulfiram is known to be a thiol-reactive compound that can covalently modify cysteine residues (Diaz-Sanchez et al., 2016; Galkin et al., 2014; Lipsky et al., 2001; Paranjpe et al., 2014) . To determine whether disulfiram can inhibit coronaviral PL pro s, the DUB activity of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV PL pro was measured in the presence of various concentrations of disulfiram. Interestingly, disulfiram showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on both proteases with IC 50 values in the micromolar range ( Fig. 1) . Next, to elucidate the kinetic mechanisms of the interactions between disulfiram and the two PL pro s, the proteolytic activity of each enzyme was measured in the presence of various concentrations of a peptidyl substrate and disulfiram. The results were then fitted to different kinetic models (competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive and mixed inhibition). Surprisingly, disulfiram showed a noncompetitive inhibition pattern against MERS-CoV PL pro ( Fig. 2A ) but a competitive inhibition pattern against SARS-CoV PL pro (Fig. 2B ). This inconsistency is quite intriguing since the two enzymes share a similar overall structure and an identical catalytic triad (Bailey-Elkin et al., 2014; Chou et al., 2014; Lei et al., 2014; Ratia et al., 2006) , albeit the inhibition constant (K is ) of disulfiram for MERS-CoV PL pro is 4.4-fold higher than that for SARS-CoV PL pro (Table 1 ). Perhaps this discovery should not be surprising given that disulfiram is also a noncompetitive inhibitor for Citrullus vulgaris urease with a K is of 67.6 μM (Diaz-Sanchez et al., 2016), while its IC 50 for Giardia lamblia carbamate kinase is 0.6-1.4 μM (Chen et al., 2012) . Similarly, a previous study mentions that their compound 4 also has different recognition specificity for the two PL pro s . Our study once again suggests broad-spectrum potency for disulfiram, given the versatility it shows even against two coronaviral PL pro s.
