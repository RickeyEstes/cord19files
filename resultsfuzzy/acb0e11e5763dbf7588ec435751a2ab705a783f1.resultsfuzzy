Envelope protein shares 100% identity. The genome alignment between the novel and bat (bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013) coronaviruses showed 2 of 7 insertions (Table 1A) In summary, the present study provided a detailed genetic analysis of 2019-nCoV genome evolution and potential universal epitopes for subunit vaccine development. .

Table 2 -Amino acid sequences of high confidence mean HBA (IC <= 10nM) CD4 T-cell epitopes from functionally important regions of the four structural proteins (S, E, M and N). The details of protein name, starting and ending positions of epitopes in the given protein, and epitope sequences are provided. The unique epitope sequences for each protein and the universal epitopes commonly recognized by HLA-DR alleles of all five population sets (highlighted in red) are listed at the end of each table.
