Overall, we detected hepadnavirus DNA in 42/390 (10.8%) sera. DCH DNA was detected in 31 (17.8%) out of 174 sera collected with a request for diagnosis of infectious diseases (collection A) and in 11 (5.1%) out of 216 sera submitted to the laboratory for pre-surgical evaluation or for suspected metabolic or neoplastic disease (collection B) that were used to generate a baseline. The difference for DCH prevalence was statistically extremely significant (p-value = 0.00006, OR = 4.04005, CI95% = [1.96601; 8.30211]) when compared animals from collection A and collection B (Fig. 1A) . Moreover, there was no significant difference in terms of prevalence (p = 0.64125) between male (11.4%, 25/219) and female (9.9%, 17/171) individuals (Fig. 1B) . We also analysed the distribution of hepadnavirus across various age groups (Fig. 1C) . The prevalence of DCH was higher in cats aged 4 to 7 months (20.5%, 8/39) although without statistically significant difference (p = 0.08061) compared to other age groups. We reconstructed the complete genome of the DCH strain ITA/2018/165-83, of approximately 3.2 kb (Fig. 2) , which had 97.0% nucleotide sequence identity to the Australian reference strain AUS/2016/Sydney across the entire genome. Some differences were observed in the tree topologies between our analysis and previous studies 2 , likely accounted for by the alignment complexity. In the consensus phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3) , a large group included bat and rodent viruses. The two feline hepadnaviruses segregated together in a defined branch within www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ this large group. All the primate viruses were basal to this bat/rodent/feline group. Also, there were two additional well-defined groups, encompassing avian and amphibian viruses, respectively. The findings of this study confirm that the novel hepadnavirus is a common component of the feline virome. The pathogenic role of this hepadnavirus, if any, is not yet known, but thus far, all hepadnaviruses have been reported to replicate preferentially in hepatocytes 1, 4 . In this study we observed a marked and significantly higher prevalence (17.8%, 31/174) in the cohort of cats with suspected infectious diseases (collection A) with respect to a group of animals (collection B) used as baseline. Almost half of the sera positive for DCH (14/31, 45 .2%) of this cohort were collected from cats with retroviral infection (FIV and/or feline leukemia virus, FeLV). In turn, the overall prevalence of retroviral infection in collection A was 24.1% (42/174), with 33.3% (14/42) being co-infections with DCH with a statistically significant (p = 0.0048) correlation between DCH and retrovirus positive cats. These findings echo what has been documented for HBV, which is more frequently observed in immunocompromised individuals 5 . Reactivation of HBV is common in patients with immunosuppression 5 . Even more interestingly, hepatopathy has been described in FeLV-infected cats, with icterus and various inflammatory and degenerative liver diseases 6 . Feline retroviruses have been demonstrated to impair severely the immune system in infected cats and diseases associated with immune-suppression account for a large portion of the morbidity and mortality observed in FeLV-infected cats [7] [8] [9] . Transmission of HBV in humans occurs through blood and other body fluids and contagion can also occur during sexual contact and by maternal/fetal route 1, 4 . Transmission of FIV/FeLV in cats occurs with similar modalities, as the virus is present in blood and body fluids 9 . Similar modalities of transmission might also be hypothesized for DCH, since we found viremia in 10.8% of the cats. Importantly, the presence of DCH in the sera may pose unexpected risks in transfusion medicine. DCH, along with feline retroviruses, Bartonella spp. and feline hemoplasma, should be considered in the screening of donor subjects 10 . In cats there are not known viral agents strictly associated with hepatic disease, unlike what observed in human medicine where there are five major types of viral hepatitis (A to E) 11 . For diagnosis of HBV infection and for predicting the stage of infection in human patients, antigens, antibodies and viral genome are profiled/ quantified and this information is coupled with haematological and blood chemistry tests. In the case of DCH, we can only use the molecular diagnostics and hematological and blood chemistry data, since there are no immunological reagents available for the diagnostics. Out of 42 DCH-infected cats, we could retrieve information on hematologic and serum biochemical parameters for 20 animals (Table 1 ). In 10 of these, increased levels of markers indicative of structural or functional liver damage (i.e. AST, ALT, ALP, GGT and total bilirubin) were present. HBV load is considered relevant in infected human patients and varies markedly across the phases of HBV infection 1 . The lower threshold for risk of active hepatitis and liver damage is 10 4 viral genome equivalents of HBV per mL, equivalent to about 2000 IU (international unit)/mL 1 . Usually, high HBV DNA load in blood is found in acute infection, or in active chronic stages of disease, but the virus can reactivate after long periods of apparent remission, chiefly in immunosuppressed patients 1 . The mean and median values of DCH viremia in feline sera Figure 1 . Results of the screening for DCH in the feline sera. The prevalence of DCH was evaluated in sera collected for the diagnosis of infectious diseases (collection A) and sera submitted to the laboratory for presurgical evaluation or for suspected metabolic or neoplastic disease (collection B) and used for comparison (panel A). The prevalence of DCH was also evaluated in relation to sex (panel B) and age (panel C) of the animals. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ were 1.3 × 10 6 and 2.1 × 10 4 DNA copies per mL (range 3.3 × 10 0 -2.5 × 10 7 DNA copies per mL). In 7 out of 10 animals with suspected hepatic disease, DCH load was >10 4 genome copies per mL. Although this parallelism between HBV and DCH is intriguing, whether a correlation also exists between DCH replication and liver damage should be assessed in structured, larger observational studies. For instance, we also found the virus in cats with unaltered hepatic markers. This condition occurs in human patients with chronic HBV infection during the inactive "immune-control" phase, defined as the presence of HBV antigens in serum without ALT elevation and with low viremic HBV-DNA levels 12 . However, only in 3/10 cats with non-altered hepatic markers the virus titer was lower than 10 4 . The actual patho-biology of DCH in cats should be determined in order to understand better the patterns of DCH infection. Several novel viruses have been discovered in cats in recent years 13, 14 . Optimizing the diagnostic algorithms and gathering epidemiological data will help assessing the possible pathogenic role of these viruses in cats and eventually conceive strategies to protect their health.
