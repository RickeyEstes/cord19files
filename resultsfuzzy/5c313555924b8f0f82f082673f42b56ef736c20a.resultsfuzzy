The results of the literature review and the consultative process discussed in this article helped to identify behaviors with the greatest promise for preventing the acquisition and transmission of Zika. A critical part of this process was the consensus-building process with partners, ensuring input from those working on the ground. The SBC Technical Working Group engaged partners throughout the process. Partners requested focusing on behaviors that families and communities could do themselves ("locus of control" at the household). Points of contention often centered around behaviors that were being promoted already and were perceived by partners to be effective but had mixed evidence. For example, covering water storage containers was found to effective in the literature only for long-term water storage containers, but ultimately short-term containers were included in the guidance based on conversations with partners. This was mainly because partners perceived this behavior (covering water storage containers with a lid) to be effective based on this behavior being implemented already and being received positively. However, for other behaviors, for example use of bed nets, we clarified that although these are effective for malaria, they are not effective for Zika, and this was ultimately agreed upon and the guidance accepted. Through the process, partners were reminded that choices had to be made to prioritize key behaviors; although all of them were potentially effective, we were looking for relative effectiveness to prioritize the most effective ones and focus on them. Where there was pushback, we asked for field data to inform the decision to modify the final guidance. These results were summarized in the Zika Prevention Behavior Matrix, a document widely disseminated through the Zika Communication Network (ZCN), a platform for sharing Zikarelated resources and media products in the LAC region. A Technical Specifications Content Guide (a companion to the matrix) was also developed to detail the evidence-based technical requirements and steps to follow for each of the 7 behaviors (described here in Table 1 , and in more detail in the Technical Specifications Content Guide) to reduce transmission. The guide was made available on the ZCN website to guide implementing partners in developing SBC content. Both documents, available in English and Spanish, guide prevention messages and prioritize calls to action to harmonize partner efforts and clarify specific messages to families, communities, and health care providers targeted by SBC programs for prioritized behaviors. The documents will be available to the public via an interactive digital platform that will guide users through the evidence, messaging, and technical specifications in a user-friendly way. Because Aedes aegypti vector control and mosquito bite prevention behaviors are included in this resource, partners working on dengue and chikungunya can use it. The documents will be continually updated as new developments emerge, reflecting input from implementing partners, to ensure that the materials address realities on the ground. For example, based on input from the field, guidance on correct disposal of repellents was recently added. Additional resources have been developed by Breakthrough ACTION to support the promotion of the prioritized behaviors with the needed specificity described in the Technical Specifications Content Guide. SBC program teams in the field can use these tools to adapt their efforts to the latest findings and recommendations. A job aid has been developed to guide outreach workers and volunteers during household visits to better target audience segmentation for behaviors to maximize the uptake of the recommendations in the Zika Prevention Behavior Matrix. To facilitate effective use of the job aid and messaging around the prevention behaviors, a training-of-trainers curriculum on interpersonal communication skills for outreach workers has also been developed. This curriculum has been used to train health promoters, volunteers, and field technicians in 5 LAC countries and adapted for context-specific variation with USAID implementing partners and/or Ministry of Health personnel. Both the job aid (in English and Spanish) and curriculum are available on the ZCN. Country-specific adaptations to the job aid, such as including language for dengue and chikungunya prevention, are also available on the ZCN.
