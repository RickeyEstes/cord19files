Conclusion: TLV is substantially cleared by CVVH and Cl increases significantly with increasing UF rate. Cl did not differ by hemofilter type. CVVH Cl at higher UF flows exceeds the total Cl reported in patients with normal renal function. TLV likely will require dose adjustments in patients receiving CVVH. Objectives: Telavancin (TLV), a bactericidal lipoglycopeptide with multiple mechanisms of action, is in Phase 3 trials for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with a focus on infections due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus. TLV is primarily eliminated by the kidneys and requires dosage adjustment for renal dysfunction. TLV is highly protein bound (93%) in healthy subjects which would suggest that it would not be removed by dialysis, but its small volume of distribution (0.15 L/kg) means that it may be removed by CVVHD. CVVHD is used in the management of critically ill patients. The objective of this study was to determine CVVHD TLV transmembrane clearance (Cl) with 2 commonly used hemodialyzers at conventional CVVHD dialysate flow rates. Methods: TLV Cl was assessed in our in vitro CVVHD model using citrate anticoagulated bovine blood and B. Braun Diapact machine. Experiments were run 5 times using AN69 (M100, Gambro) and polysulfone (F160NR, Fresenius) hemodialyzers. Dialysate flows were 1, 2, 3 and 6 L/hr with sufficient blood flows [(Qb) 200-350 mL/min] to maintain appropriate transmembrane pressures. Blood samples were collected from the pre-filter port (A) and post-filter port (V), and spent dialysate samples (D) from the post-filter D port. Plasma TLV concentrations (arterial and venous) and dialysate samples were assayed using validated LC-MS/MS methods and TLV Cl was determined using the following formula: Cl = (D flow rate) [TLV]D/(([TLV]Arterial+[TLV]Venous)/2). Dialytic Cl between filter types was compared using a two-tailed, unpaired t-test. Conclusion: TLV is effectively cleared by CVVHD. The higher permeability polysulfone dialyzer was associated with significantly increased Cl vs. the AN69 dialyzer as dialysate flow increased. The degree of TLV Cl seen with CVVHD suggests that dose adjustments will be necessary in patients receiving CVVHD. Objective: It is still a subject of controversy that only free, unbound drug is responsible for antibacterial activity of antibiotics. To provide further proof, that only free drug contributes to antimicrobial efficacy a comparative, doseranging time-kill curve study was performed. To exclude influence factors resulting from different mechanisms of action this was done within the antibiotic class of carbapenems, using compounds with different serum protein binding. Methods: Constant concentration time-kill curves were performed in 50% serum for the slightly serum protein bound mer-openem (~2%) and imipenem (10%) as well as for the highly serum protein bound ertapenem (95%) and faro-penem (95-96%), ranging from 1 · MIC to 16 · MIC. The change in number of bacteria (CFU/mL) versus time was linked to their effect. Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae Bay 63, Staphylococcus aureus Bay 133 and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 6303 were used as the test organisms. Samples were taken at 0, 0.5, 1 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours. The data were modelled simultaneously using the software Scientist Ò for Windows TM and a modified sigmoid Emax model characterized by growth rate constant (k0), maximum kill rate (kmax), and concentration at half maximum effect (EC50). Results: For all four bacterial strains investigated, there were dramatic increases (400-700%) in EC50 for the highly se-rum protein bound carbapenems (ertapenem, faropenem) in the presence of serum proteins (Fig. 1) . For both substances no significant differences in k0 and kmax were determined. In contrast, imipenem and meropenem showed only minor differences in EC50 in the presence and the absence of 50% serum. Conclusion: Only free, unbound drug is responsible for the antimicrobial activity. Analysis of these time-kill curves clearly showed that the antibacterial efficacy was significantly decreased in the presence of 50% serum for the highly bound ertapenem and faropenem while being unaltered for the slightly bound meropenem and imipenem. Objective: Numerous in vitro experiments have shown that Protein Binding (PB) is an important factor for antimicrobial activity, especially for highly bound antibiotics. However, the experimental conditions that simulate the in vivo situation best are still subject of controversy. Therefore, an in vitro microdialysis experiment was performed that evaluates various influence factors on the PB of the highly bound betalactams ceftriaxone (PB 95-98%). Methods: A comparative, dose-ranging in vitro microdialysis study was conducted to determine free, unbound ceftriaxone concentrations in Lactated Ringer's solution and Todd Hewitt Broth (THB) both with and without bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma, St. Louis) 40 g/L and human plasma at 37°C. Furthermore, in vitro constant concentration time-kill curves were performed, using Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 6303 and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 as the test organisms. The Data was analysed using an appropriate PK/PD model, characterized by growth rate constant (k0), maximum kill rate (kmax), and concentration at half maximum effect (EC50) and correlated to free ceftriaxone THB concentrations determined by HPLC-UV. Results: There were only minor differences in both unbound drug concentrations and anti-infective activity when BSA 40 g/ L was added to either Lactated Ringer's (PB 0% and 12.5±2.5%, with and without BSA respectively) or THB (PB 27% and 25.5±2.5%, with and without BSA respectively). No significant changes in k0, kmax and EC50 were observed. However, using human plasma, unbound concentrations (PB 60%)88%) were altered dramati-cally. Conclusion: Only free, unbound drug is responsible for the antimicrobial activity. However, one cannot rely on that binding to commercially purchased BSA is consistent with reported protein binding values. Unbound concentrations should be measured under the respective experimental conditions to be able to correctly interpret the experimental results. The results of our study show that DNA of parvovirus B19 was present in all 48 samples that tested positive for specific IgM antibodies. After the first round of PCR reaction, 17 samples were positive, and after the second reaction, all 48 samples were positive. Altogether 12 unique genotype variants of parvovirus B19 were identified and all were clustered in the genotype I group of B19-related isolates. Most of the distinct 12 genetic variants differed in 1% to 2% from the sequences deposited in Gene Bank. The majority of sequences obtained from the B19 virus epidemic in 1998 represents a single variant of genotype I with the Gene Bank acc. no. AJ781038. We also found that different genetic variants of parvovirus B19 were circulating in 2002 and were 100% or 99% identical to the genotype I variant with the Gene Bank acc. no. Z68146. In our study, we were not able to identify any variants of other rare genotypes (Lali or V9). Conclusion: Parvovirus B19 DNA was successfully amplified from all IgM positive serum samples of the patients. The genotype I of parvovirus B19 is dominating in infections with parvovirus B19 in Slovenia. Objectives: Great Britain has been free of animal brucellosis since 1985 (European Commission Decision 93/52). The main source of infection for UK residents is through contact with infected material in foreign countries. The objective of this study is to type human samples received in the UK since 1999 using Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTR) molecular typing to confirm results obtained by classical typing and relate these results to the suspected source of infection. Methods: Classical typing is traditionally used and is based on the phenotypic attributes of each strain and biovar. VNTR typing is a recently developed molecular method, which is based on short repeats contained in the DNA that can be amplified to give a banding pattern specific to each strain. Results: Results found using both methods are consistent. The results show geographical differences, consistent with observations of strain genotype distribution found in animal brucellosis. Conclusion: Patient history has been gathered where possible giving information on recent travels. Along with results found by classical typing and confirmed by VNTR typing we can draw a picture of the sources of infection. These results illustrate the potential of VNTR typing as a tool to aid conventional approaches to epidemiological traceback that, in the presence of a suitably comprehensive database of strain genotypes, could help identify the source of an infection. Conclusion: The ELISA RIDASCREEN Ò Borrelia IgG and IgM have shown a good sensitivity for the serological diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. The short evaluation for the specificity of the IgG test revealed a good assay with few false positive reactions, whereas the IgM assay was, as expected more prompt to give false positive results with sera from patients with infectious mononucleosis. So far any equivocal or positive tests should be confirmed by immunoblots. The GenoType Ò Enterococcus assay produced correct species and van gene identification for all 40 (100%) VRE isolates, including 7 E. faecalis vanB, 12 E. faecium vanA, 12 E. faecium vanB, 6 E. gallinarum vanC1, 1 E. gallinarum vanA-vanC1, and 2 E. casseliflavus vanC2/3. The only minor discrepancy was an E. casseliflavus that hybridized very weakly with the vanC1 probe in addition to the expected vanC2/C3 probe. The costs per specimen were comparable for each test method. However, the GenoType Ò Enterococcus assay could be completed within a normal working day in contrast to conventional testing, which required a minimum of two days from the point of isolation on the vancomycin-screen media. Conclusion: From this preliminary evaluation, the GenoType Ò Enterococcus amplification-detection assay provides VRE species and van genotype identification in a rapid and costeffective manner, superior to conventional culture methods. Although further study is required, this kit may have clinical utility during a VRE outbreak.
