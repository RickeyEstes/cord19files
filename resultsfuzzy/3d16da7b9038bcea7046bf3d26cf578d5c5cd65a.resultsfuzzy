The mean number of IEL per mm of tissue in the control group was 20.93 (Fig. 3) . In the Giardia-infected group, the number of IEL per mm doubled (42.32) and reached a peak in the group infected with Cryptosporidium. It was interesting to note that the number of IEL per mm for the group of animals with the mixed infection was lower when compared with the group of calves infected with Giardia only. There was no correlation between the IEL and the duration of infection with Giardia (0.1 < P < 0.95). However, a direct correlation existed between the number of IEL per mm and the intensity of the inflammation observed at histology (0.005 < P < 0.01).
