Of the 395 participants, 140 (35%) reported a respiratory illness and 46 had nose swabs taken. Seven were positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus by PCR, 1 for subtype H3N2 infl uenza, and 38 were negative. One of the 46 had 2 swabs taken during different illnesses; the fi rst was positive and the second was negative for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. PCR cycle threshold values for swab specimens were from 30 to 40, indicating low viral loads. This fi nding may indicate that poor swabbing techniques were used, that the sample had been taken as infection was waning, or that level of infection was low (data not shown). For 87 participants, a second serum sample was taken because of a reported respiratory illness. The average number of days between the fi rst and second sample was 60 days (range 28 to 122 days, median 54) days. Thirtysix participants who had nose swabs performed also had a second serum sample taken. Seroconversion occurred in only 1/87 workers, with an initial titer of <10 and a subsequent titer of 40 (76 days later). This participant had a nose swab taken during a respiratory infection, which was negative for infl uenza virus. Seroconversion did not occur in any of the participants with a positive nose swab specimen. The mean number of days from obtaining a One participant with a positive nose swab sample did not have a second serum sample taken. None of the participants with a positive nose swab or seroconversion reported taking NIs in their weekly survey. Four of the 7 participants with a positive PCR result and the 1 in whom seroconversion occurred were in the clinical group (3 doctors, 1 pharmacist, 1 nurse, 1 physiotherapist). The participant who showed seroconversion was 29 years of age; participants with a positive PCR result ranged from 24-63 years of age. Two of the participants with a positive PCR result worked on the infectious disease ward, 2 in the emergency department, and 1 in the intensive care unit; seroconversion occurred in the participant who worked in a medical ward. Five of the participants with positive PCR results and the participant in whom seroconversion occurred had received the 2009 and previous seasonal infl uenza vaccines. None of the participants with confi rmed infl uenza reported taking oseltamivir for either prophylaxis or treatment.
