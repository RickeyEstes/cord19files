Gene entrapment strategies to identify host genes required virus replication depend on methods to select for virus resistant clones present at about one in 10 4 -10 5 mutagenized cells. Unfortunately, cells persistently infected with reovirus (PI) can emerge at high frequencies (one in 10 2 -10 3 ) and are intrinsically resistant to the virus [9, 10] . In preliminary studies, we found that hepa 1/a cells were not suitable for genetic studies due to the emergence of PI clones. However, persistently infected rat intestinal epithelial cells (RIE-1) [11, 12] were found to require a serum survival factor and die when placed in serum free media ( Figure 1 ). In vitro infection of RIE-1 cells with reovirus also appears to mirror virus replication in the rodent host [13] [14] [15] . Consequently, RIE-1 cells were used in the present study, and reovirus-resistant clones were selected in serum-free medium to remove PI survivors. RIE-1 cells were mutagenized by using the U3NeoSV1 gene trap shuttle vector [16] (see Methods) and the resulting libraries of mutagenized cells were infected with reovirus serotype 1/ Lang at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 35, to select for clones resistant to lytic infection. The isolated clones did not express reoviral antigens, and did not produce infectious virus as assessed by plaque assay, suggesting these reovirus resistant clones were not PI. Regions of genomic DNA adjacent to the U3NeoSV1 provirus in each virus resistant clone were isolated by plasmid rescue and sequenced. Altogether, of the 151 isolated clones, 62% of flanking sequences matched known or presumptive genes, and an additional 23% were represented in the public databases of expressed sequence tags (dbEST) or non-redundant sequences (nr). From the 111 clones matching known or presumptive genes, 10 genes were represented more than once. Many of the disrupted genes have known or imputed functions, and several are known to function in the same or related pathways. For example, the library included 4 independent mutations Persistently infected RIE-1 cells fail to survive in serum-free media Figure 1 Persistently infected RIE-1 cells fail to survive in serum-free media. RIE-1 parental cells and cells persistently infected with reovirus type 1 were plated in complete medium (FBS + ) or in media in which the serum was omitted (FBS -). Surviving cells were stained with gentian violet after 7 days. Darkly staining wells represent cell survival. involving three genes that encoded proteins associated with the insulin growth factor-2 (IGF-II) signalling pathway, namely, IGF-ll/manose-6-phosphate receptor [5, 6] (Igf2r, locus ID 25151), the IGF binding protein 5 protease [7] (Prss11, locus ID 65164, 2 clones), and CTCF (Ctcf, locus ID 83726), a transcriptional repressor of IGF-II involved in paternal imprinting [17, 18] . The position of the provirus (clone 6B72) in the first intron of the Ctcf gene is shown in Figure 2 . CTCF differentially represses maternal Igf2 gene expression, whereas the imprinted paternal gene escapes repression due to methylation of CTCF binding sites [17, 18] . The stability of virus resistance in the 6B72 cell was tested by infecting RIE-1 and 6B72 cells with reovirus type 1 at a MOI of 10. There was approximately a 10 fold lower titre of reovirus obtained following infection of 6B72 cells as compared to RIE-1 cells at 24 hrs. post-infection (4.5 × 10 5 versus 5.1 × 10 6 ), and the difference was also maintained at 48 hours post-infection (data not shown). Additionally, there was a dramatic difference in the survival of 6B72 cells after being exposed to high titres of reovirus type 1 ( Figure 5 ). To determine whether Igf2 confers resistance to reovirus infections, clones of RIE-1 cells over-expressing the fulllength Igf2 transcript or the splice variant (Igf2 sv ) were generated and examined for their capacity to resist lytic infection. As shown in Figure 5 expression of wild type Disruption of the Ctcf gene in 6B72 cells Levels of CTCF protein were assessed by Western blot analysis (A), normalized to a β-actin control. Levels of Igf2 transcripts were assessed by Northern blot analysis (B) normalized to GAPDH control. Protein content, as assayed by western blot analysis and standardized to β-actin was decreased in the 6B72 cell clone to 30% of control. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis of Igf2 transcripts (C). The RT-PCR products (arrows) were separated on a 2% agarose gel, revealing an additional transcript in the 6B72 cells. The DNA sequence of the larger RT-PCR product (D) revealed an alternatively spliced transcript (Igf2 sv ) generated by splicing of exon 2 to a cryptic 3' splice site located 14 nucleotides upstream of exon 3. (Igf2), but not the splice variant (Igf2 sv ) increased the resistance of RIE-1 cells to reovirus infection by over 100 fold. However, when the Igf2 sv was transfected into 6B72 cells, the ability of 6B72 cells to survive infection was abolished. Expression of the Igf2 gene in an anti-sense orientation caused no significant difference in the capacity of 6B72 cells to resist infection (data not shown). These studies suggest that increased Igf2 expression in 6B72 cells is associated with their capacity to resist reovirus infection, and that the Igf2 sv encodes a trans-dominant isoform that blocks the activity of Igf2.
