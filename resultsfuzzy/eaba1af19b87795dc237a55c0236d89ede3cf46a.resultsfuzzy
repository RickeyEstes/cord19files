Attempts of RVA isolation were conducted with 15 fecal samples from neonate calves submitted to the Laboratory of Biopharma, Rabat, between January and April 2014. A highly permissive and well established fetal rhesus monkey kidney cell line (MA104) was used [2] . Since most RVA strains from bovine are able to agglutinate erythrocytes, these samples were chosen for their ability to agglutinate chicken red blood cells (RBCs) ( Table 1) [15, 17] , and their reactivity against a highly sensitive and specific immunochromatography test for RVA rapid diagnosis (Rota-Check-1 test -Veda-lab France-). Prior to this study, we have attempted to recover RVA strains from clinical samples which were subjected to multiple rounds of freeze-thaw (1/13, 1/18, 2/15, 1/25, 2/23 and 3/4). We realized that hemagglutination (HA) of chicken erythrocytes by RVA particles decreased three to eight folds when a sample is freeze-thawed at room temperature and the loss of HA was irreversible after three rounds of freeze-thaw (data not shown). This observation, although reported not to alter the virus morphology [3, 4] , is consistent with earlier biological studies suggesting that effective HA of a RVA strain may increase its infectivity and therefore, RVA isolation [15] . Indeed, HA phenotype of RVA is mediated by the VP4 gene which was clearly shown to code for protease enhanced plaque formation in MA104 cells [15] . This VP4 gene, was also shown to be protease-sensitive. It is cleaved to VP5 (60 kDa) and VP8* (28 kDa) in the presence of trypsin, resulting in the conversion of noninfectious rotavirus to an infectious form [7, 8] . As the infectivity of RVA is increased by trypsin treatments [6] , three bovine samples (3/T, 7/T and 8045) and controls (monolayer cells inoculated with DMEM serum free medium) were exposed to different concentrations of TPCK-Trypsin (3-30 μg/inoculum). The results demonstrate that at lower concentration (i.e., 3-10 μg of trypsin), no changes at the cellular level were observed ( Fig. 1a) after six passages and samples were considered negative for RVA isolation. On the contrary, cells activated as well as controls degenerated and trypsin cytotoxicity was enhanced with 25-30 μg of trypsin (Fig. 1b, c) . In parallel, when samples were assayed with 15-20 μg of trypsin for 60 min at 37 °C (or 2 h at room temperature) (data not shown), appreciable changes in cell's morphology were detected 2-3 days post infection (pif ) (Fig. 1d) . RVA isolation was achieved for nine clinical samples following one or two passages (60 %). CPE was observed during the first passage for samples 3/25, 3/34, 1/10, 2/20, 2/12, 8045 and 9864. The first sign of CPE detected consisted of increased cell granularity, obscure cell boundaries, cell rounding, and eventual degeneration and detachment of cells. This phenomenon was more pronounced when samples were activated with 20 μg of TPCK. CPE were consistently observed thereafter and the cells became completely destroyed after 4 days pif (Fig. 1e, f ) . For two samples (3/T and 7/T), the CPE effect was observed in the second passage on day 2 pif. Therefore, we consider that 15 μg/inoculum of TPCK was the optimal concentration for bovine RVA isolation (Fig. 1g, h) . On the other hand, the recovery of RVA from samples 1/13, 1/18, 2/15, 1/25, 2/23 and 3/4 was not achieved. This is explained by the fact that infected cells were not washed sufficiently to remove FCS which inhibits trypsin and not to their initial HA titers. Indeed, RVA strains from 2/12 and 7/T having the same HA titers (1/64 and 1/8 respectively) as 2/23 and 1/25 samples were successfully isolated when infected cells were adequately washed (Table 1) . Also, other factors were interfering with successful isolation such the infectious viral titer in the inoculums, inadequate storage of samples and multiple rounds of freeze-thaw which decline their HA titers. As the presence of trypsin in the culture medium during multiple cycles of virus replication was demonstrated to enhance the infectivity of rotavirus between 10-and 1000-fold [12] , we could demonstrate that a concentration of 0.5-1 μg/ml in the serum-free DMEM medium was optimal for virus penetration. However, a concentration of 2 μg/ml resulted in the lysis of cell controls. Whether trypsin concentration (15 or 20 μg/inoculum) on viral activation or penetration (0.5-1 μg/ml) affect the viral titer or not was not checked. The role of proteolytic enzyme (i.e., trypsin) in the penetration of RVA is well demonstrated [6, 16] and our results corroborate the previous ones showing that this enzyme is indispensable for the entry of the virus into a host cell [1] . Data from qRT-PCR confirmed that 3/T, 7/T, 3/25, 3/34, 1/10, 2/20, 2/12, 8045 and 9864 isolates were of group A rotavirus with Ct values ranging between 12.17 and 24.69. However, no RNA loads (No Ct in Table 1 ) were detected for 1/13, 1/18, 2/15, 1/25, 2/23 and 3/4. G and P typing were performed for all strains, and analysis sequencing revealed that two isolates (3/T and 7/T) were of G6P [5] serotype and seven (3/25, 3/34, 1/10, 2/20, 2/12, 8045, 9864) were of G10P [14] serotype.
