SARS N-pro tein pro duc tion, puri fi ca tion, and refold ing SARS N-pro tein was pro duced in both M15 and BL21(DE3) cells. Pro teins were expressed as insol u ble inclu sion bodies and purified using metal affin ity resin, then urea-dena tured pro teins were refolded by step wise dial y sis and the His-tag removed by DA Pase diges tion. SDS-PAGE con firmed that the recov ered N-pro tein was puri fied to near homo ge ne ity under dena tur ing con di tions (Fig. 1 ). How ever, fol low ing the refold ing, two addi tional bands (A and B bands) were observed at approx i mately 29 kDa (A band) and 25 kDa (B band). The masses were con sis tent with pro te ol yed N-pro tein (approx i mately 50 kDa) and sim i lar to the SARS N-pro tein pro te oly sis prod ucts reported in the pres ence of casp as es [24] . To rule out the pos si bil ity that the A and B bands could be attrib uted either to N-pro tein cleav age by DA Pase or a con tam inant in DA Pase, the puri fi ca tion was repeated using BL21(DE3) cells with out DA Pase addi tion. BL21(DE3) cells lack the lon and ompT pro te ase genes and thus reduced recombinant pro tein pro teol y sis is expected. How ever, the A and B bands were still observed, con firm ing that the SARS N-pro tein cleav age was not due to the DA Pase prep a ra tion and was inde pen dent of the cell line used (data not shown).
