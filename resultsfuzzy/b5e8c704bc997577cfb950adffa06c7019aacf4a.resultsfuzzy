Computational analysis reveals the presence of a small ORF overlapping the arterivirus GP5 gene The coding potential of ORF5a was first detected in an alignment of PRRSV-NA sequences by using the genefinding software MLOGD (Firth & Brown, 2006; Chung et al., 2008) . MLOGD uses nucleotide and amino acid substitution matrices to model sequence evolution in dual-coding, single-coding and non-coding regions. It can be used to predict whether query ORFs are likely to be coding sequences via an approximate likelihood-ratio test, where the null model comprises any known CDSs and the alternative model comprises the known CDSs and the query ORF. When applied to the PRRSV-NA alignment, MLOGD detected a positive coding signature for the previously defined arterivirus CDSs and also for ORF5a (Fig. 1b) . In the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) PRRSV-NA reference sequence, NC_001961 (15 428 nt), ORF5a covers nucleotides 13 778-13 930 (51 codons) and therefore overlaps the 59 end of the GP5 CDS (nucleotides 13 788-14 390) by 48 codons (~24 % of the GP5 gene) in the +2 reading frame. ORF5a begins immediately 39 of the ORF4 termination codon and 10 nt 59 of the ORF5 initiation codon (Fig. 2b) . A similar ORF5a was identified in PRRSV-EU and the other arteriviruses, EAV (Fig. 2a) , LDV and SHFV, and again MLOGD detected a positive coding signature for ORF5a using sequence alignments of PRRSV-EU, EAV and LDV. Incidentally, the presence of this ORF in EAV, though not its bioinformatic coding signature, had Fig. 2b for GenBank accession numbers). For EAV and the two PRRSV genotypes, plots are shown for several coding-potential statistics in a 15-codon sliding window. The top and middle panels illustrate the degree of conservation at synonymous sites within the GP5 CDS: the top panel depicts the probability that the degree of conservation within a given window could be obtained under a null model of neutral evolution at synonymous sites, while the middle panel depicts the absolute amount of conservation as represented by the ratio of the observed number of substitutions within a given window to the number expected under the null model. Scores below the dashed line correspond to more conserved regions and are indicative of overlapping functional elements, either coding or non-coding. Owing to the huge quantity of GP5 sequence data (8344 sequences) available for the PRRSV-NA plot, the formal P values for this analysis are extremely small for the conserved 59 region. The bottom panel depicts the MLOGD coding potential score in the +2 frame (relative to the GP5 CDS). For illustrative purposes the M CDS, and the GP4 CDS in PRRSV-NA, were not included in the null-model CDS annotations so that these CDSs, like ORF5a, register positive coding potential (i.e. scores above the dashed line) in the MLOGD analysis. Note that, regardless of sign (positive or negative), the MLOGD signal tends to be weaker within regions of high conservation (e.g. within ORF5a) due to there being fewer substitutions with which to discriminate between the null model and the alternative model. Discovery and function of a novel arterivirus gene previously been noted by Pasternak et al. (2000) . Since there is only a single SHFV sequence available, MLOGD could not be used to test the coding potential of ORF5a in that virus. Although this analysis was based on the application of MLOGD to specific ORFs, for illustrative purposes the MLOGD score in a 15-codon sliding window in the +2 reading frame (with respect to ORF5) is shown in Fig. 1 (b) for alignments of 127 EAV, 232 PRRSV-NA and 34 PRRSV-EU sequences (i.e. the available sequences with coverage of both ORF5 and at least 150 nt of its 59 and 39 flanking sequences). Positive coding signatures are apparent for ORF5a (and also for the M and GP4 CDSs in cases where they fall in the +2 reading frame with respect to the GP5 CDS). Additional alignments were generated for 224 EAV, 8344 PRRSV-NA and 587 PRRSV-EU sequences that have full coverage of the GP5 CDS, and were analysed for conservation at synonymous sites as described in Firth & Atkins (2009) [see also Simmonds et al. (2008) ; see Shi et al. (2010) and Zhang et al. (2010) for recent PRRSV and EAV phylogenies]. Enhanced conservation at synonymous sites is indicative of overlapping functional elements -either coding or non-coding. In all three alignments, greatly enhanced conservation was apparent in the region where ORF5a overlaps the GP5 CDS (Fig. 1b) . The newly discovered ORF5a has 59 codons in EAV, either 51 or 46 codons in PRRSV-NA, 43 codons in PRRSV-EU, 47 codons in LDV and 64 codons in SHFV (Fig. 2c) . When applied to the five representative sequences in Fig. 2 (c), despite there being considerable sequence divergence, PHOBIUS and SIGNALP 3.0 (Käll et al., 2004; Bendtsen et al., 2004) consistently predict that the ORF5a protein is a type III membrane protein with a short (5-12 aa) lumenal domain at its amino terminus, a central signal-anchor/ transmembrane sequence, and a cytosolic carboxy-terminal domain of 13-31 aa. showing the slightly overlapping GP4 and GP5 genes, and the newly discovered ORF5a that overlaps with both. The TRS for sg RNA5 synthesis and relevant initiation and termination codons are indicated. Red underscores indicate residues mutated to knock out ORF5a in mutant D5a-2. (b) Context of the ORF5a (green) and ORF5 (blue) translation initiation codons in five representative arterivirus sequences, illustrating the potential for leaky scanning being the translation initiation mechanism for the second reading frame (see text for details). The figure shows that the ORF5a initiation codon is the more upstream in EAV and PRRSV-NA and the more downstream in the other arteriviruses. The ORF4 termination codon is boxed and the two residues mutated to knock out EAV ORF5a in mutant D5a-2 are indicated by arrows. (c) Amino acid sequences of the ORF5a proteins of five representative arterivirus sequences. The position of the putative transmembrane domain, as predicted by PHOBIUS (http://phobius.binf.ku.dk; Kä ll et al., 2004) , is indicated in yellow. The ORF5a protein is predicted to be a type III membrane protein (lumenal aminoterminal domain, central signal-anchor/transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal domain). The ORF5a protein and GP5 are probably expressed from the same subgenomic mRNA via leaky scanning The regions around the ORF5a initiation codon in five representative arterivirus sequences are shown in Fig. 2(b) . In EAV and PRRSV-NA, the ORF5a AUG codon is 59 of the ORF5 initiation codon and the TRS for the sg RNA5 is located sufficiently far upstream to include the ORF5a AUG codon within that sg mRNA, with no additional intervening AUG codons (Snijder & Meulenberg, 1998; Pasternak et al., 2000; Lin et al., 2002) . On the other hand, in PRRSV-EU, LDV and SHFV, the ORF5a AUG codon is located just a few nucleotides 39 of the ORF5 initiation codon. In eukaryotes, the efficiency of translation initiation is modulated by the identity of the nucleotides surrounding the initiation codon, with the optimal context (known as the 'Kozak consensus sequence') in mammals involving mainly a guanine at the +4 position and a purine at the 23 position, where the presence of an adenine at the 23 position is the strongest single indicator of efficient initiation (Kozak, 2002) . When the context of the first AUG codon on a transcript is suboptimal, efficient leaky scanning to alternative downstream AUG codons can occur (Kozak, 2002) . Here, neither the ORF5 nor ORF5a initiation codons have a guanine at the +4 position, but all five arterivirus ORF5 initiation codons have an adenine at the 23 position. In contrast, the ORF5a initiation codons have either a pyrimidine (EAV, PRRSV-NA and SHFV) or a guanine (PRRSV-EU and LDV) at the 23 position. Thus, in PRRSV-NA and EAV, where the ORF5a AUG codon is 59, there is the potential for efficient leaky scanning to the ORF5 initiation codon. In contrast, in PRRSV-EU, LDV and SHFV, where the ORF5a AUG is 39, conventional leaky scanning for ORF5a translation may be expected to be less efficient. However, in these sequences, the ORF5 and ORF5a AUG codons are very closely spaced (separated by just 2 or 5 nt) and it has been demonstrated that, if two AUG codons are separated by less than~10 nt, efficient initiation may occur at the downstream AUG codon, even when the upstream AUG codon is in a strong context (Matsuda & Dreher, 2006) . The analysis of initiation codons and their context, and ORF5a length, was extended to all available arterivirus sequences in GenBank. Some 10 800 sequences with full or partial coverage of the ORF5a/ORF5 region were analysed. In contrast to the above comparative phylogenetic analyses, simply counting sequences ignores potential phylogenetic bias (some clades may be greatly over-represented relative to others; indeed; clustering the sequences with BLASTCLUST or CLUSTAL X shows this to be the case). Thus, the following analysis is more meaningful with respect to the range of features present rather than to the relative abundances of those features. Many sequences (including~90 % of thẽ 9600 available PRRSV-NA sequences) cover ORF5 entirely but have no 59 flanking sequence. Therefore they do not allow analysis of the upstream ORF5a initiation codon or its context, but still allow analysis of the presence or absence of premature termination codons within the part of ORF5a that overlaps ORF5. Nonetheless 136 EAV, 445 PRRSV-NA, 622 PRRSV-EU, 1 SHFV and 5 LDV sequences have coverage of the ORF5a initiation site, and the above-mentioned initiation sites and contexts are very highly conserved (except that~63 % of PRRSV-EU and 9 % of PRRSV-NA sequences have a guanine instead of an adenine as the nucleotide at the 23 position of the ORF5 initiation codon context). Similarly, the above-mentioned ORF5a lengths are highly conserved in those sequences with full or partial coverage of the ORF5a region, with the notable exception that PRRSV-NA exhibits two main forms of differing lengths: a 51 codon version (~26 % of sequences) and a 39-truncated 46-codon version (~74 % of sequences). A very small fraction of sequences were found to be ORF5a-defective as a result of either premature ORF5a-frame termination codons or substitutions within the ORF5a initiation codon. However, these do not necessarily represent sequences from viable viruses, but might instead be due to sequencing errors, sequencing of defective virus sequences or curation errors (e.g. five sequence records in which non-contiguous GP3 and GP5 sequences appear to have been fused in silico). Indeed, similar numbers of GP5-defective sequences were found during the analysis. To summarize, four completely separate computational analyses -conservation of an ORF, conservation of a potential translation mechanism, positive MLOGD coding signature and a greatly suppressed frequency of substitutions at ORF5-frame synonymous sites -all pointed to the existence of a novel coding sequence, ORF5a.
