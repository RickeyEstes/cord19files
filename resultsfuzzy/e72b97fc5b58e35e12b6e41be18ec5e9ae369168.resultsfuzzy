Granulomatous pneumonia is characterized by the presence of variable numbers of caseous or noncaseous granulomas randomly distributed in the lungs (see Fig. 9 -68). On palpation, lungs have a typical nodular character given by well-circumscribed, variably sized nodules that generally have a firm texture, especially if calcification has occurred ( Fig. 9-80) . During postmortem examination, granulomas in the lungs occasionally can be mistaken for neoplasms. Microscopically, pulmonary granulomas are composed of a center of necrotic tissue, surrounded by a rim of macrophages (epithelioid cells) and giant cells and an outer delineated layer of connective tissue commonly infiltrated by lymphocytes and plasma cells ( Fig.  9-81 ). Unlike other types of pneumonias, the causative agent in granulomatous pneumonia can, in many cases, be identified isolates from septic pulmonary emboli in domestic animals are Trueperella (Arcanobacterium) pyogenes (cattle), Fusobacterium necrophorum (cattle, pigs, and human beings), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (pigs, cattle, dogs, and human beings), Streptococcus suis (pigs), Staphylococcus aureus (dogs and human beings), and Streptococcus equi (horses).
