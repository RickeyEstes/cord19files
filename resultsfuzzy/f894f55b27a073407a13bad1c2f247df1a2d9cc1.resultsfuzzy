The three mAbs tested (G2, D12 and G4) have been previously shown to effectively neutralize MERS-CoV pseudovirus in Huh 7.5 cells, which natively express DPP4 . Results of the inhibition assay showed that D12 and G2 mAbs inhibited MERS-CoV S binding to DPP4-expressing BHK-21 cells with similar IC 50 values, while G4 mAb did not. Since D12 and G2 bind to the S1 region and presumably neutralize by preventing S attachment to DPP4, neutralization experiments were performed to determine whether their neutralization patterns were also similar in DPP4-expressing BHK21 cells. As expected, G2 and D12 had comparable neutralization curves (Fig. 5) , with IC 50 values in the 0.5-0.8 nM range. The reciprocal IC 50 neutralization potency of G4 (Fig. 5 ) was determined to be one order of magnitude higher than D12 and G2, recapitulating binding inhibition results. The same order of magnitude difference between D12/G2 and G4 was previously shown with Huh 7.5 cells .
