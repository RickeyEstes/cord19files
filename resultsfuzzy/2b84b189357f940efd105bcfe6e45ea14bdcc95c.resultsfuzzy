In cross-sectional studies, seroprevalence can be estimated by the proportion of specimens with antibody titers at or above a specific threshold, with 95% confidence intervals typically obtained using the binomial formula or the normal approximation to the binomial. If a number of additional assumptions are met, including that seroprevalence before an epidemic is very low, and almost all infected individuals have rises in convalescent antibody titers above the chosen threshold, the post-epidemic seroprevalence can provide an approximate estimate of the cumulative incidence of infection. 34 Note that seroprevalence is a proportion and not a rate. In studies with paired sera, the cumulative incidence of virus infection can be estimated by the proportion of persons with a rise in antibody titer, traditionally a fourfold or greater rise. 31 In most studies, 95% confidence intervals are typically estimated using the binomial formula or the normal approximation to the binomial, implicitly assuming that each person can experience no more than one virus infection during the period considered. It is noteworthy to point out also that cumulative incidence of virus infection is sometimes referred to as an "attack rate," although a proportion of infections may be asymptomatic (and therefore not "attacks"), and the quantity measured is a proportion and not a rate. The term "cumulative incidence of infection" should therefore be preferred to "attack rate" in the context of serological studies. In either case, the methods used to account for the probability of seropositivity or seroconversion if infected, and any method used to account for decay in antibody titer over time, should be reported (ROSES-I 12.2). To increase transparency of cumulative incidence of infection estimates, it is often helpful to report unadjusted estimates of the distribution of antibody titers by age group (ROSES-I 16.1). In some studies, particularly those with more complex designs in terms of timing of serologic measurements, improved estimates of the seroprevalence at a certain point in time, or the cumulative incidence of infection over a specified time period, may be obtained by fitting observed data to a mechanistic model of transmission dynamics. 4, 35 This can account for non-independence in the data (ROSES-I 12.1).
