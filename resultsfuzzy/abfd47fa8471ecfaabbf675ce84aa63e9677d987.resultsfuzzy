R. Maini*, K. Henderson, T. Lamagni, G. Nichols, N. Phin, V. Delpech, E. Sheridan (Colindale, UK) Objectives: Anecdotal reports suggest that the incidence of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia may be on the increase. This study was undertaken to describe the epidemiology of Pneumocystis pneumonia in England from 2000 to 2010 using a number of data sources. Methods: Microbiological diagnoses were extracted from the Health Protection Agency routine laboratory surveillance system (LabBase2), and clinical ICD-10 codes were used to extract Pneumocystis pneumonia data from both NHS Information Centre Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Office for National Statistics (ONS) death certification data. Datasets were individually analysed for trend over time and then cross-compared. HIV surveillance data was used to analyse the occurrence of Pneumocystis pneumonia among new diagnoses of HIV. Conclusions: Data from numerous sources suggest an increase in the diagnosis of P. pneumonia primarily among non-HIV infected persons . The cause of this increase may be multi-factorial in aetiology. Recent changes in the microbiological methods used to detect P. jirovecii over the last few years have occurred, with many laboratories switching from immunofluorescence to PCR methods for organism detection. Further investigation into the impact of this change in diagnostic methods is required. Observed increases in the incidence of Pneumocystis pneumonia in renal transplant recipients indicate that further investigation in a range of potential risk groups is warranted. O115 Evaluation of the fungicidal activity of micafungin by flow cytometry A.P. Silva*, I. Faria-Ramos, S. Costa-de-Oliveira, C. Pina-Vaz, A.G. Rodrigues (Porto, PT) Objectives: Candida spp. is responsible for severe infections contributing to the increase of morbidity and mortality particularly of immunocompromised patients. Micafungin is a recent fungicidal drug by inhibiting the 1,3-beta-D-glucan synthetase. The standard susceptibility testing is time consuming and gives results only after 24 hours. We propose a new approach for micafungin susceptibility evaluation based upon flow cytometric assessment. Methods: Candida spp. susceptible (n = 20) and resistant (n = 8) strains to micafungin according to the CLSI protocol were assayed. Yeast cells were incubated with several concentrations of micafungin (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 Objectives: Multidrug-resistant organisms, including Extendedspectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, are rapidly emerging worldwide. Contact isolation is recommended by authorities to limit spread of ESBL-however, the rate of transmission without contact isolation in the non-epidemic setting is unknown. In addition, the majority of ESBL cases are community-acquired; likely by commonly ESBL contaminated food. Therefore, we aimed to determine the rate of spread (R0) for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in a tertiary care-centre with five ICUs over an eleven-year study period using standard precautions without contact isolation. Figure 1 ). There was no evidence of infection of the two patients with ESBLproducing Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli, and therefore, detection was interpreted as colonization. Conclusions: The estimated rate of spread of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae is very low in a tertiary care University affiliated hospital with a high level of standard hygiene precautions. The low level of nosocomial transmission and the rapid emergence of community-acquired ESBL, -likely by contaminated meat or vegetables -challenge the recommendation of routine use of contact isolation in a non-epidemic setting to prevent spread. no longer used in patient care. Overflow holes became apparent in the outbreak ICU when an item list was made for the outbreak ICU and another ICU with respect to patient care, water use, type of water supply and sewage, waste disposal. These were removed, S-traps were changed, and two sinks were disconnected. New patients were identified and sinks remained positive despite strict separation between clean and wastewater and between wet and dry areas, further reinforcement of isolation measures and cleaning protocols. Only after the closure of the unit in July and August 2010 and extensive cleaning of the unit, sinks, and sewage tubes, no more EKP positive patients have been identified. On the other hand the sinks have remained positive. Conclusions: Sinks can serve as an environmental source of EKP and may remain contaminated for many years. An outbreak with a low and fluctuating incidence due to an external source can remain undetected for long periods. Continuous fingerprinting of clinical isolates will lead to early detection Update in drug development S142 Antibacterial The QFT and all IP-10 detection assays had a high Area under the curve (AUC) for the calculated ROCs as a measure of diagnostic value, AUC was 0.84 (LFI), 0.87 (MPA), 0.82 (ELISA) and 0.92 (QFT). The cut-off points for positive test were determined to be 0.56 ng/mL, 0.32 ng/mL, and 5.0 ng/mL for LFI, MPA, and ELISA, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of IP-10 measurement were 83% and 83% (LFI), 83% and 93% (MPA), and 72% and 96% (ELISA), respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for QFT was 69% and 100% using the manufacturer's cut off of 0.35 IU/mL. IP-10 determined with LFI showed moderate correlation to MPA and QFT (r2 > 0.65 p < 0.001) and strong correlation to ELISA (r2 > 0.8, p < 0.001 Pearson). Conclusion: In our study the POC LFI measuring IP-10 had comparable sensitivity and specificity compared to QFT for the diagnosis of active TB. The three test methods to measure IP-10 after stimulation with TB-specific antigens correlated well to each other and to QFT. Prospective studies evaluating this new IP-10-POC test are thus warranted. The sensor is able to discriminate the signature of a causative organism using pattern recognition software. Studies have shown that they may be valuable in detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis directly from patient sputa. We proposed a study evaluating the use of such a sensor for the detection of M. tb directly from the breaths of patients suspected of having pulmonary TB. Method: The objective was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the sensor (NextDimension Technology, California) to that of TB microscopy, and culture or GeneXpert. TB suspects were recruited at PHC facilities in the Paarl area, Western Cape. Forty smear positive, culture/Xpert positives, 28 smear negative, culture/Xpert positive, and 48 smear negative, culture/Xpert negative TB suspects were recruited over a 6 month period (September 2010-February 2011). In addition, breath samples from 50 healthy volunteers were obtained. Thirty-nine percent of the study population was HIV-positive. The test, performed in triplicate, consisted of a patient exhaling into a bag, which was then attached to the sensor and the sample was analysed in real-time. Results: Linear discriminant analysis of the samples revealed the sensitivity and specificity of the sensor were as follows: 100%, 92% (all culture positives vs. healthy volunteers), 70%, 83% (smear positive, culture positive vs. culture negative), 36%, 70% (smear negative, culture positive vs. culture negative). The sensor was able to accurately discriminate the infected group from the healthy population, but less so with suspects having other aetiology for their lower respiratory tract symptoms. Conclusion: This device shows promise as a rapid, point of care diagnostic for pulmonary tuberculosis. Further research is still required to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the device by choosing more selective sensors and VOC targets. Objective: UK national guidance recommends screening for tuberculosis (TB) in various at risk groups and treatment for latent tuberculosis if no evidence of active disease is found. We undertook a retrospective study to evaluate the management of latent tuberculosis in our hospital. Methods: All patients who had a diagnosis of latent tuberculosis made in the adult Infectious Diseases clinic in our hospital from September 2008 till October 2011 were included in the study. Notes were reviewed to establish the demographics, rationale for screening and outcome of chemoprophylaxis where accepted. Results: Fifty nine patients were included in the study. Majority of these patients were from sub-saharan Africa (62%) with over half of them under the age of 35. All patients were asymptomatic with a normal clinical examination and 54 (92%) had a normal chest x-ray (CXR). Those with an abnormal CXR had no previous history of treatment for TB.35 had a positive Mantoux test of which 33 went onto have a positive IGRA (interferon gamma release assay) test but 24 had a positive IGRA test only. 24 (41%) were screened as recent TB contacts, 19 (32%) as part of occupational health screening and 14 (24%) as part of port health screening. Five of these patients are awaiting further review regarding chemoprophylaxis and two were not offered chemoprophylaxis (one because of age and second because patient was returning back to an endemic area). Of the remaining 52 patients who were offered chemoprophylaxis 41 (79%) accepted it although two have deferred it for a few months. The uptake of chemoprophylaxis was highest (95%) among TB contacts and lowest (58%) among health care workers. The regimen used was Rifampicin and Isoniazid for three months. Chemoprophylaxis is ongoing in four patients and of the other 35 who started chemoprophylaxis 32 (91%) successfully completed it. Of the three who discontinued the regimen due to side-effects one had liver function abnormalities, one had pruritus and the third had tingling and numbness. 62% of patients receiving chemoprophylaxis reported no side-effects. Conclusions: Majority of patients diagnosed with latent tuberculosis in our hospital are from sub-Saharan Africa and majority of them were screened as recent TB contacts. Acceptance of chemoprophylaxis for latent tuberculosis was high overall but comparatively low by health care workers. There was a high overall completion rate with very low incidence of serious side-effects. Objective: To evaluate the usefulness of a clinical protocol for preventing tuberculosis (TB) associated with tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies, and to assess the impact of both ceasing the 2-step tuberculin skin testing (TST) practice and introducing QuantiFERON Ò -Gold In-Tube (QFT) in the diagnosis strategy. Methods: Observational cohort study of all patients due to start treatment with TNF antagonists, after being evaluated for TB infection (LTBI) according to a pre-established clinical protocol between Jan 2003 and Dec 2010. Protocol included (i) diagnosis of LTBI, based on clinical and radiological data followed by 2-step TST (1st period), 2step TST and QFT (2nd period) and 1-step TST and QFT (3rd period); and (ii) pre-emptive treatment (Pre-tx) with 9 months of isoniazid (H) when indicated. Patients were followed up while on Pre-tx and adherence was monitored by H metabolites in urine. Development of TB was assessed by reviewing the electronic medical reports including hospital and primary care data. The Ethics Committee of Bellvitge University Hospital approved the study. Results: Six hundred seventy-two patients (57% women, mean age 50 years.) were evaluated. 227 patients were diagnosed with LTBI (43%, 40% and 26% in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd period respectively; p < 0.05). 33% of patients received Pre-tx (41%, 40% and 24% respectively; p < 0.05). 481 started anti-TNF therapy. After a median follow-up of 3.8 years (2562 patient-years) for the whole cohort and 4.2 years (1537 patient-years) for patients at risk (on anti-TNF therapy), four (0.6%) patients developed TB (incidence: 156 per 100 000 patients/years; 95%CI 50-377 for the whole cohort, and 195; 95%CI 50-531 for patients at risk). Three out of four cases occurred in patients on anti-TNF therapy, one in each period. Another patient had negative TST and QFT, and did not receive neither Pre-tx nor anti-TNF therapy. Conclusion: Systematic evaluation and treatment of patients prior TNF-antagonist therapy, prevents TB in a great extent. Ceasing the twostep TST practice and introducing QFT substantially reduce diagnoses and pre-emptive treatments for LTBI without increasing the risk of TB. Objective: To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of using Linezolid to treat XDR-TB. Methods Since April 15th, 2009, we have applied Linezolid-based chemotherapy in the treatment of fourteen cases XDR-TB patients. We adopted individual-based chemotherapy regimens based on the patient medication history and drug susceptibility test results. Dosage of Linezolid: at the beginning: 600 mg, intravenous drip, bid, with duration from 1 week to 6 weeks; Later: reduce to 600 mg, intravenous drip, qd. Maximum duration of treatment is 11 months; minimum is 2 months, with an average 6 months and a half. Results: On the second day after medication, the body temperature returned to normal for the three febrile patients; the 14 patients showed significant improvement in cough, sputum; chest tightness, breath shortness and other symptoms also improved. In the 6th months after treatment of Linezolid, 10 patients presented cavity closure. Sputum smear negative conversion occurred in all pulmonary cases at a median of 64 days(range:8-210).Culture conversion occurred in all pulmonary cases at a median of 63 days(range:8-210).The relapse of both sputum and imaging occurred in two cases after 4 months of not using Linezolid. Six cases presented nausea, vomiting and other gastrointestinal reactions, but symptoms disappeared after reduction of Linezolid. Three patients developed peripheral neuropathy. Two patients developed declining of eyesight. Six cases had hematological adverse reactions.One patients developed leucopenia. Four patients developed middle anemia. One patients developed severe anaemia and needed blood transfusions. Conclusions Using Linezolid to treat XDR-TB can significantly improve clinical symptoms, promote lesion absorption and cavity closure, and accelerate sputum negative conversion. Therefore, it can help XDR-TB patients to improve life quality with mild adverse reaction but good drug tolerance. We suggest that Linezolid can be recommended for the treatment of XDR-TB. zolid can be recommended for the treatment of XDR-TB. Objectives: Tuberculosis meningitis (TBM) has a case fatality rate of >30%. Optimal treatment for TBM has not been established and follows the model of pulmonary TB treatment. Moxifloxacin, because of its potencyand good penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a promising drug for TBM. Higher doses of moxifloxacin as well as rifampicin may increase drug exposure in blood and CSF, thereby improving survival. This study evaluates the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and efficacy of such an intensified regimen for TBM in a hospital in Indonesia. Methods: We randomized 60 Indonesian TBM patients (10% HIVinfected) to standard dose (450 mg, 10 mg/kg) oral rifampicin or high dose (600 mg, 13 mg/kg) rifampicin administered i.v., and (in a second randomization) to moxifloxacin 400 mg, moxifloxacin 800 mg, or ethambutol 750 mg QD, for the first 14 days and in adjunction to standard INH, PZA and dexamethason. After the first two weeks of treatment all patients continued with standard TB treatment. Pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments were performed in blood and CSF within the first critical 4 days of treatment, adverse events attributable to TB treatment were assessed, and 1 month mortality was evaluated. This explorative study was powered to detect pharmacokinetic differences between groups. Results: So far PK data have been evaluated for 23 patients. Increasing the dose led to higher drug exposure in plasma for rifampicin (1.8 fold) and moxifloxacin (3-fold) . Mean CSF concentrations for rifampicin were low and showed only a small increase with a higher dose (0.50 vs. 0.37 mg/L). Mean CSF concentrations for moxifloxacin were 1.7 vs. 3.9 mg/L (p < 0.05) for standard vs. high dose moxifloxacin. Among the first 48 patients included, mild QTc prolongation occurred in 48% of patients taking moxifloxacin, while grade 3 (10%) and grade 4 (6%) hepatotoxicity was evenly distributed between groups. One-month mortality among the first 48 patients included, was substantially lower (31% vs. 57%, p = 0.07) in patients taking high-dose rifampicin i.v. compared to those taking standard dose orally. Conclusion: Intensified antibiotic treatment for TBM leads to more favorable PK in plasma (rifampicin and moxifloxacin) and in CSF (moxifloxacin), with acceptable toxicity. Preliminary data in this explorative study show a trend for lower mortality in patients taking high dose rifampicin. Larger studies should evaluate the effect of intensified treatment on survival of patients with TBM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen which is ubiquitous in soil and water. It is however able to cause severe infections in humans and in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients it is the dominant cause of morbidity and mortality due to its persistence in the airways of these patients. Our main objective has been to characterize the evolutionary routes by which these bacteria switch from an environmental life-style to one associated with chronic infections. Helped by a substantial strain collection covering several hundred CF patients with lung infections lasting for up to 35 years we have been able to identify particularly successful clones whose changing genome sequences and global gene expression profiles have constituted an important platform for our analysis. The genome dynamics reflect in many cases the frequent appearance of hyper-mutator strains, in which mutations accumulate with rates which are up to 1000 fold increased relative to what is observed in non-mutator isolates. In these cases the airway populations of P. aeruginosa are highly diverse and adaptation to the changing environments in the CF airways seems to occur at the population level. In contrast, very successful non-mutator clones seem to harbor several mutations in global regulatory genes, which result in highly adapted cells and quite homogeneous airway populations. Through allelic replacement wild-type strains of P. aeruginosa have been constructed, which carry one or more of the identified regulatory mutations from clinical isolates, and the resulting strains display phenotypes with profiles resembling those of the clinical strains. These results suggest that a small number of specific regulatory mutations, altering networks of transcription in the bacteria, may provide the cells with adaptive features that lead to high fitness levels of the bacteria in their new environment. The latest results from these on-going studies of gene regulation in CF isolates and their synthetic counter-parts will be discussed.
