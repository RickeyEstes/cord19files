We describe PCA mathematically as described below. Consider p random variables X 1 , X 2 , …, X p , the original system can be rotated to form a new coordinate. Let S be the covariance matrix associated with the random vector X9 = [X 1 , X 2 , …, X p ]. The corresponding eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs are (l 1 , e 1 ), (l 2 , e 2 ), …, (l p , e p ), and the ith principal component is given by: PC i~e 0 i X~e i1 X 1 ze i2 X 2 z:::ze ip X p , i~1,2,:::,p ð1Þ Then Var(PC i )~e 0 i Se i~li i~1,2,:::,p ð2Þ Thus, the principal components are uncorrelated, and their variances are equal to the eigenvalues of S. Another property of the principal components is: Var(X 1 )z:::zVar(X p )~l 1 zl 2 z:::zl p~V ar(PC 1 ) Then the proportion of the total population variance due to the kth PC is:~l k =(l 1 zl 2 z:::zl p ) k~1,2,:::,p: Consequently, if most of the total population variance for large p can be attributed to the first two or three components, then these first two or three components could serve as a substitute for the original variables with a minimal loss of information. Moreover, if the weight of the last PCs occupied a highly trivial part of the total population variance, then the last PCs can be neglected (i.e., set to zero). In the present study, there were five extracted pose groups, and we used only eight scoring functions, which included LigScore1, PLP1, jain, Ludi_1, D_Score, G_Score, ChemScore, and Sur-flex_Score, to perform the PCA for each group (The details are mentioned in the results section). Thus, for the training set, the eight scoring functions were used as the variables (i.e., columns of the matrix) and 10000 compounds were arranged in the rows of the matrix. Then the 1000068 correlation matrix was established. Because the scoring functions in our test produce binding scores with different units and signs, the signs of the binding scores produced by LigScore1, PLP1, jain, Ludi_1, D_Score, G_Score, and ChemScore were reversed to ensure that positive binding scores always indicated higher binding affinities. All of the binding scores were scaled to unit variance and centered. Thus, each column of data had an average of zero and a standard deviation of one. For each of the five scoring function extracted poses, we have calculated the eigenvalues and cumulative contribution rate. The first three principal components were extracted. Each principal component is a linear combination of eight Z-scaled scoring functions, which formulate a modified ranking score function, PCscore. PCscore is set to re-score and re-rank the extracted poses from each of the five scoring functions. PCscore can be written as follows: WipÃZScore p i~1,2,:::,p Where the n terms, ZScore p , are the Z-scaled scoring function, and the coefficients, w ip , are the loading values (i.e., the elements of p principal component eigenvector e p ). For example, for PC1score The linear coefficient values (loading values) for w 11 , w 12 … w 18 were the elements of the first principal component eigenvector, e 1 . In the present study, an SPSS version 16.0 statistical analysis package (SPSS Inc.) was used to normalize and calculate the principal components for all of the scoring data.
