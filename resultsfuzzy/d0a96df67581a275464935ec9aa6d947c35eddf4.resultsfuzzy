The synthesis of chalcones (1a-1j) from substituted benzaldehyde and acetophenone was carried out using Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The substituted Chalconesemicarbazones (2a-2j, 2a -2j ) and substituted 3,5-diphenyl-2-pyrazoline-1-carboxamide (3a-3j) were synthesized [65] from these chalcones using semicarbazide hydrochloride (Scheme 1). After establishing the structure of chalcones their corresponding semicarbazones were synthesized and the structures were elucidated using melting point, IR and NMR spectra. The synthesis of chalconesemicarbazones resulted in two isomeric form 2a-2j and 2a -2j . These two isomeric forms were separated by column chromatography on silica gel using petroleum ether and ethyl acetate as eluent. The separated isomers were characterized by 1 H NMR data. The isomers obtained were characterized on the basis of interaction of lone pair on nitrogen with C H proton as explained by Curphy-Morrison chemical shift [72] . When lone pairs on nitrogen are syn to C H bonds (2a-2j), the proton is shifted upfield showing the lower Ä± value. When lone pairs on nitrogen are anti to C H bonds (2a -2j ), the proton is shifted downfield. The conclusion was arrived on the basis of 3D molecular modelling studies. In 2i where lone pair on nitrogen is syn to C 2 -H (Scheme 1) on minimization of energy in 3D molecular modelling ( Fig. 1) [73] clearly indicate that lone pair on nitrogen is in optimal position to affect shielding of C 2 -H and also to C 3 -H to some extent because of extension of conjugation. In 2i the lone pair on nitrogen is anti to C 2 -H and after 3D molecular modelling in minimized energy structure shown in Figure 1 , it is clear that these can't have any effect on CH CH protons. On comparing the 1 H NMR, peaks for C 2 -H and C 3 -H for chalcones and chalconesemicarbazones, distinctive shielding effect is observed due to substitution of adjacent C O group with C N NHCONH 2 . These isomeric forms are reported here for the first time, although a large number of reports are available in literature on the synthesis of these compounds [74] [75] [76] . In case of p-OCH 3 and p-NO 2 substituted isomers only one isomer was formed i.e. 2f and 2h, respectively. On cyclization of chalconesemicarbazones, diarylpyrazolines are obtained and each of the two isomeric forms (2a-2j) and (2a -2j ) resulted in single product (3a-3j). In contrast, two isomeric forms of pyrazolines have been reported by Shekarchi et al. [77] . In the 1 H NMR spectra of (3a-3j), the characteristic ABX pattern has been obtained.
