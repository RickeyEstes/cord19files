From the 289 stool samples of individual calves analyzed by ss-PAGE the PBV was detected in 24 (8.3%) of them, which 10.2% (18/176) had diarrheic consistency (Table 1) . As like other studies, bovine PBV were found incidentally during bovine rotavirus research in diarrheic and non-diarrheic fecal samples. Although the prevalence of bovine PBV are still scarce in the literature, the percentage of 8.3% was much higher than that reported in other studies that also used ss-PAGE as diagnostic technique. Although many epidemiological studies involving human and porcine PBV has been described so far, there are only five reports describing the presence of PBV in feces of cattle or buffaloes of which one in Belgium (Vanopdenbosch and Wellemans, 1989) , one in Brazil (Buzinaro et al., 2003) and three in India (Ghosh et al., 2009; Malik et al., 2011; 2013) . PBV was detected in only one diarrheic specimen of 78 samples tested from calves that had diarrhea in India (Ghosh et al., 2009) . Another study also carried out in India found 3.67% (5/136) positivity for PBV, which four of these were from buffalo calves and one from cow calf, all of them without rotavirus infection (Malik et al., 2011) . In the only study of PBV detection in the Brazilian cattle population, Buzinaro et al. (2003) detected the PBV in four (0.76%) of 576 fecal samples evaluated (diarrheic and non-diarrheic) from calves less than 45 days old. All the 24 PBV positive calves identified in the present study were up to 60 days old, which 75% (18/24) had diarrhea at the moment of stool sampling. Statistical analysis using the chi-square test showed no significant difference (p > 0.05) between diarrheic and normal fecal samples (Table 1) . Based on epidemiological studies in humans, the role of PBV as causative agent of diarrhea is still controversial. Although some studies describe the presence of virus in stool samples from adults and children with diarrhea, the PBV etiological relationship with the diarrheal syndrome cannot be established, since it has also been reported the presence of this virus in asymptomatic hosts (Ganesh et al., 2010) . The PBV is currently listed as emerging and opportunistic pathogens in cases of diarrhea, especially in immunocompromised individuals (Giordano et al., 1999; González et al., 1998; Grohmann et al., 1993; Martínez et al., 2003; Rosen et al., 2000) . The PBV was found in 21% (17/84) of fecal samples from patients with diarrhea of unknown etiology, a significantly higher rate than uninfected patients with diarrhea of unknown etiology (van Leeuwen et al., 2010) . Besides, after comparing PBV nucleotide sequences identified in humans and animals, it was also suggested the zoonotic potential of these viruses (Ganesh et al., 2010) . Although these fecal samples were negative for bovine rotavirus (data not shown), we cannot conclude that PBV was the primary agent of the diarrhea since they were not analyzed for other com- mon enteropathogens, such as bovine coronavirus, Escherichia coli and Eimeria spp. According to the migration profile of the two dsRNA segments in ss-PAGE, both electrophoretic profiles of PBV were detected (Fig. 1) . Of the 24 ss-PAGE positive stool samples, 5 (20.8%) of them showed a small electrophoretic profile and 19 (79.2%) samples had large profile. The distribution of small and large genome profiles of PBV according to stool consistency and origin (municipality) is shown in Table 2 . The PBV has been detected in all five herds surveyed, having at least one positive animal. The large profile was detected in 79.2% (19/24) of the samples. This result is in agreement with others studies that describe this profile as the most frequent among PBV strains from different species hosts (Giordano et al., 2008; Malik et al., 2011; Masachessi et al., 2007) . Surveys so far have only found PBV strains with the large RNA profile in bovine fecal samples (Buzinaro et al., 2003; Ghosh et al., 2009; Malik et al., 2011 Malik et al., ,2013 Vanopdenbosch and Wellemans, 1989) . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of small genome profile PBV-like strains in naturally infected calves. From the 24 ss-PAGE positive fecal samples, 15 (62.5%) were successfully amplified (201 bp) using GI specific primers targeting the RdRp gene of PBV. However, only large profile PBV samples were amplified using these primers (Table 3) . . The bovine PBV sequence obtained in this study is indicated with the symbol " ". The phylogenetic tree was constructed by using the Neighbor-Joining method and the Kimura 2-parameter nucletotide substitution. Bootstrapping was statistically supported with 1000 replicates. Scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site.
