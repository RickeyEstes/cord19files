To determine the histological changes in weaned piglets infected with the PDCoV, piglets were necropsied at 3 d.p.i. and 7 d.p.i. As shown in Fig. 2B&D , blunt intestinal villus was observed, while that in negative control was normal (Fig. 2A&C ). In addition, PDCoV antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of the villous enterocytes of the PDCoVchallenged piglets by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 2F&H ), but no PDCoV antigen was detected in negative control (Fig. 2E&G) . Taken together, these results indicate that PDCoV could cause intestinal lesion in weaned piglets.
