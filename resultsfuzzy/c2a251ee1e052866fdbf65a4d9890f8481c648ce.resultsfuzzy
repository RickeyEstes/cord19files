Because HMPV DFA was not available before February 2008, only 14 of 23 HMPV-positive BAL samples were tested by DFA and RT-PCR, whereas 22 of 23 RSV-positive BAL samples were tested with both methods. Compared with RT-PCR, HMPV DFA had a sensitivity of 71% (10/14), whereas RSV DFA had a sensitivity of 86% (19/22) . The difference between HMPV and RSV mean viral loads in the first BAL sample (6.43 Log 10 copies/mL, interquartile ratio, 5.79 to 7.97; and 7.13 Log 10 copies/mL interquartile ratio, 6.34 to 8.11, respectively) did not reach statistical significance (Wilcoxon rank; P ¼ .17). HMPV was detected by RT-PCR in nasal washes from 10 of 15 patients who had been sampled within 11 days before or after the BAL. In comparison, RSV was identified in all 14 patients who had nasal-wash samples tested. HMPV LRTD patients who tested negative by nasal wash had lower viral loads in their BAL specimens compared with those who tested positive in the nasal wash ( Figure 1A ). Sera were obtained from 30 patients (13 infected with HMPV and 17 infected with RSV) within 11 days before or after BAL. In one patient with HMPV LRTD (viral load of 8.19 Log 10 copies/mL), HMPV RNA was detected in two serum samples taken 4 days apart. We detected RSV RNA in two patients with RSV LRTD (viral load of 8.56 and 7.99 Log 10 copies/mL); in one of these two patients, RSV was detected in four serum samples over a 10-day period starting the day before BAL until 9 days after. All three patients with viral RNA in the sera died of severe respiratory disease ( Figure 1B) . Radiologic features of all 46 patients supported the diagnosis of a viral LRTD. Twenty-two patients with RSV LRTD Figure 1 . (A) RT-PCR results on nasal washes (X) sampled within 11 days before or after the positive BAL. Negative nasal washes were found in five patients with HMPV LRTD, whereas all patients with RSV LRTD had at least one positive nasal wash. Negative nasal washes were found in patients with lower BAL viral load. (B) RT-PCR results on sera (X) sampled within 11 days before or after the positive BAL. One patient with HMPV LRTD had two positive sera (HMPV patient three), whereas two patients with RSV LRTD had positive sera (RSV patients two and seven). All three patients with positive sera had a high BAL viral load and died. and 22 with HMPV LRTD underwent high-resolution computed tomography imaging. Centrilobular, ground-glass, tree-in-bud, and alveolar opacities were found in similar proportions among HMPV-and RSV-infected patients. Centrilobular nodules were associated with less mechanical ventilation in a model that adjusted for virus type (adjusted OR, .18; 95% CI, 0 to 1.8; P ¼ .027), whereas ground-glass opacities tended to be associated with increased rates of hypoxemia in patients with RSV or HMPV LRTD (adjusted OR, 3.00; 95% CI, .8 to 11; P ¼ .1).
