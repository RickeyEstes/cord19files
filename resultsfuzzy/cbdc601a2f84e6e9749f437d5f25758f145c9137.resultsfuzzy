Through our established exclusion criterion for relatedness of a behavioral variable to the latent variable, 32 variables were with Cronbach's alpha and Dillon-Goldstein's Rho < .4. In a Table 7 and Table 8 shows latent variable loadings. To evaluate whether Activity, Sociability, Anxiety, Curiosity, and Time in the shelter were related to the illness score, we conducted a basic PLS Path regression model in which our 5 latent variables were tested for association with illness. Fig 4 shows the hypothesized path model with regression coefficients. Table 9 shows the model estimates and statistical significance. Overall, Sociability, Curiosity and Time in the Shelter were significantly associated with illness. As expected, as time in the shelter increased, illness scores did also (estimate = .53, p < .001). Increases in Sociability scores (estimate = .24, p < .001; Fig 5) and Curiosity (estimate = .09, p = .026) were associated with increased illness. Activity and Anxiety, however, were not associated with illness.
