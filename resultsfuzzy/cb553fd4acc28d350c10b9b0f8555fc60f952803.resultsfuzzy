A total of 1,239 samples were collected, 1,005 during routine visits and 288 when a respiratory infection was suspected. Of the samples collected during the well-child checkups, 30.8% (310) tested positive, while viruses were detected in 77.8% of respiratory infection cases (224/288), P < .001 (odds ratio, 3; 95% confidence interval, 2.4---3.8). The frequency of viral detection in asymptomatic children (healthy controls) increased proportionally with age from 20.8% in newborns aged 15 days to up to 42% in infants aged 12 months. The virus identified most frequently was RV, found in 82% (254) of cases. Other viruses were found in a small proportion of cases: ADV (9.7%), PIV (4.2%), hBoV (3.2%), hMPV (2.9%), FLU (2.2%) and RSV (1.6%) (Fig. 1 ).
