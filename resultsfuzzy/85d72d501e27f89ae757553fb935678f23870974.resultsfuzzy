The results show that examined V. cholerae O1 classical strains multiply and survive inside trophozoites and cysts of A. castellanii. The bacterial internalization was in cytoplasmic compartment of the amoebae cells. The relation between these microorganisms in co-cultures could be listed as symbiosis since, presence of the amoebae enhanced growth of bacteria, and the presence of the bacteria did not affect amoebic growth. In addition, V. cholerae strains could not survive without A. castellanii more than a few days. Conclusions: The symbiotic relation between these bacterial strains and A. castellanii showing a new environmental host of V. cholerae and a facultative intracellular behaviour of V. cholerae O1 classical strains, which is in contrast to the general held view of the bacterium. Microscopic examination of stool specimens is the cornerstone of detection of intestinal parasites in parasitology laboratories and is the best known and most frequently performed laboratory procedure. Although process has been made in non-morphologic diagnosis (e.g. ELISA-and PCR techniques) microscopy is still considered to be the gold standard in the diagnosis of intestinal protozoal infecions, including giardiasis. In the Netherlands, as in most other members of the European Union, fresh, nonpreserved stool specimens are generally used for examination. Specimens are initially screened as direct wet preparations using either Lugol's iodine or eosine for detection of vegetative stages of protozoa and are subsequently examined for protozoan cysts and helminth eggs using an ether-or ethylacetate sedimentation method or flotation concentration technique. Because intestinal parasites are shed intermittently, patients are asked to deliver at least three stool specimens. The limitation of this diagnostic approach is that detection of the vegetative stages of protozoa may be missed because of delays in processing and/or low compliance to the request to submit multiple stool samples. To overcome this limitation, a diagnostic test that combines multiple sampling (on 3 consecutive days), a fixative (Sodium Acetate Acedic Acid Formalin, SAF), a concentration method, and an easy to use permanent stain was developed for use in routine clinical practice. The results of the new test, called the "Triple Faeces Test" (TFT), a Giardia lamblia specific ELISA (Ridascreen Giardia, r-Biopharm), and fluorescence techniques were compared with those of the conventional diagnostic methods used for Giardiasis in routine clinical practice. These comparative studies ( which formed the basis of our newly developed diagnostic flow chart) showed that the sensitivity of the diagnostic approach using TFT and the Ridascreen Giardia test improved significantly (p < 0.005) as compared to the conventional methods using a fresh non preserved stool specimen. , and/or identification of larvae in the suspect meat (digestion of muscle tissue in artificial gastric juice followed by examination of the sediment for larvae). Results: One thousand and one hundred twenty eight cases and 65 outbreaks were studied. The distribution by gender was asymmetrical, male 58.2% (n = 656). The median age was 33 years (range 1-97). Ninety eight per cent of the cases (n = 1103) occurred in the context of an outbreak. All cases were related to the consumption of pork meat, and 72.1% of the suspect food was from animals slaughtered and sold without sanitary inspection. A multivariate random effects model shows that there is a strong linear relationship between overall levels of antimicrobial consumption and penicillin resistance, that the association of exposure and resistance is unique for every country and that there is no direct relationship between the year-to-year change in consumption and penicillin resistance. Changes in penicillin resistance through time in any country are better explained by the cumulative total antimicrobial consumption with a 2-year lag. A hypothetical 10% consumption reduction in all antibiotic classes would decrease by 2.6% the peak penicillin resistance rate in 2-years. A 15% reduction in macrolide consumption and broad to narrow spectrum penicillin ratio would independently decrease by 5.4% and 1.6% the peak penicillin resistance rate respectively. An increase of medium-narrow penicillins to mid-90s levels would diminish by 1.8% the peak penicillin resistance rate. Conclusions: Large reductions in consumption at the population level are needed to affect resistance. There is a peak level of penicillin resistance associated with cumulative exposure to a combination of antibiotic classes. It may be possible for countries with low levels of penicillin resistance under a specific steady-state situation to retain that condition for a long period of time. For other countries reduction of consumption alone may not result in reversal of resistance and so they would need to rely on the use of new agents active against multi-resistant clones. Objectives: The abilities of azithromycin and clarithromycin to promote carriage of macrolide resistant oral streptococci and the temporal persistence of the selected resistant commensals in healthy volunteers was investigated. Methods: Volunteers (n = 204) included were adult with no sign of respiratory tract infection and had not been administered any antibiotic in the past 3 months. Throat samples were taken before antibiotic administration (d1) and the volunteers randomly allocated into four groups to receive azithromycin or placebo once daily for 3 days, or clarithromycin or placebo twice daily for seven days. Further samplings were done on the 8th day after commencing the antibiotic/placebo course (d2), on the 14th day (w1), 28th day (w3), 49th day (w6), and finally in the 6th month (m6). Quantitation of the aerobic streptococcal flora was done on streptococcal agar with and without erythromycin (2 lg/ml) using a spiral plater (Eddy Jet, The Netherlands), and the percentage of macrolide-resistant streptococci determined by colony counting. Mean resistance proportions were compared between both macrolides and their respective placebo groups as well as between the two macrolide groups. For this, Student's t-test and an analysis of variance with Bonferroni's post-hoc test were used. Results: Comparative impact of the two macrolide regimens on the prevalence of macrolide resistant streptococci over a period of 6 months is presented in the graph. The mean resistance proportions at each time point following azithromycin or clarithromycin use when compared to their respective placebos, showed a significant increase (p £ 0.01 overall) in macrolide-resistant streptococci that persisted for >6 months. Comparing the two macrolides, differences in mean macrolide resistance were not significant immediately following azithromycin and clarithromycin use (p = 0.8), decreased significantly faster in the clarithromycin group than the azithromycin group in w1 and w3 (p £ 0.001), and became non-significant in w6 and m6 (p = 0.07 and 0.6, respectively). Conclusions: This is the first study analyzing the temporal evolution of the oral streptococcal flora over a prolonged period following macrolide use. Both azithromycin and clarithromycin have a marked effect on macrolide resistance in oral streptococci and these effects persist for >6 months post-therapy.
