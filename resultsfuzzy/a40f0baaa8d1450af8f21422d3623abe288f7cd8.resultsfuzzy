The composition of the essential oil isolated from S. thymbra is given in Table 1 . The essential oil was characterized by γ-terpinene (39.26%), thymol (25.16%), p-cymene (7.17%) and carvacrol (4.18%) as the major constituents. Our findings are in contrast with some previous observations of S. thymbra essential oil [10, 13, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] 30, 31] . In most references mentioned, carvacrol and/or thymol were the major compounds. Thus, the essential oil composition of S. thymbra from Turkey contained mainly carvacrol and γ-terpinene [25] . S. thymbra essential oil from Lebanon was characterized by similar amounts of p-cymene (10.76%), -pinene (10.15%), thymol (9.92%) and sabinene (8.64%) [10] . According to the essential oil composition of this species collected from Crete (Greece) from two locations, it presented different chemotypes. In the sample from Aktotiri the major compounds were carvacrol, thymol, p-cymene and γ-terpinene (44.6%, 0.3%, 11.9% and 25.5% respectively), while in the other sample the main compounds were thymol (35.5%), γ-terpinene (27.6%), p-cymene (10.4%) and carvacrol (3.2%) [24] . The essential oil of the same species growing wild in Turkey was also dominated by carvacrol (53.7%), followed by γ-terpinene (17.6%), thymol (13%) and p-cymene (10.1%) [13] . Furthermore, in a study of the essential oil composition of samples from 13 essential oils of S. thymbra from different locations in Crete, the findings showed a high compositional variation in which carvacrol varied significantly (5.2-65%), thymol (0.1-65.6%), γ-terpinene (20-4.4%) and cymene (5.5-15%) [22] . Moreover, a study was carried out to evaluate the effect of harvesting time on essential oil composition of S. thymbra collected from the same location at different vegetation stages. The findings showed that the major compounds in the vegetation phase were thymol (27.88%), followed by γ-terpinene (17.02%) and carvacrol (11.88%), while in full flowering phase carvacrol (29.18%), thymol (17.22%) and γ-terpinene (12.45%) were the main compounds, and in the fruiting phase thymol (20.73%) was again the main compound, followed by γ-terpinene 14.91% and carvacrol 12.8% [26] . The differences in essential oil composition found by various authors may be explained, at least partially, by different ecological conditions and/or harvesting time of the investigated plant materials. According to literature data and our results, it is obvious that there are some differences in the essential oil composition of S. thymbra. However, its principal constituents were determined to be mainly carvacrol, thymol, p-cymene, and γ-terpinene, and very rarely -pinene and sabinene. It has also been reported that the quantitative composition of the oil is related to the plant habitat [22] . Antioxidant activity was analyzed using the DPPH free radical scavenging method. The results of the DPPH scavenging assay of S. thymbra essential oil and its principal components and the synthetic antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) are shown in Figure 1 . The results showed that S. thymbra essential oil possessed strong antioxidant activity, as seen from the concentrations at which 50% radical scavenging occurred (IC 50 = 0.0967 mg/mL), being better than γ-terpinene and thymol and quite similar to BHA. It has been shown that the IC 50 of Origanum vulgare essential oil, which was dominated by γ-terpinene and thymol (34.4% and 31.8%, respectively) was better than BHA [32] . Moreover, O. vulgare essential oil, containing 49% of γ-terpinene and 15% of thymol, showed an IC 50 value quite similar to our results. Also, carvacrol, present in relative high amounts in Thymbra capitata oil can be partly responsible for high antioxidant activity, whereas in O. vulgare oil the activity may be attributed to two components, γ-terpinene and thymol [33] . According to earlier reports, some structural features, such as the presence of strongly activated methylene groups in the molecule, are probably the reason for antioxidant activity of monoterpene hydrocarbons [34] . Antibacterial activity results of the tested essential oil are presented in Table 2 . The oil was active against all the bacteria tested. S. thymbra essential oil showed bacteriostatic effects at 0.001-0.1 mg/mL and bactericidal ones at 0.002-0.2 mg/mL. Thymol exhibited high antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at 0.01-0.1 mg/mL and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) at 0.05-0.15 mg/mL, while carvacrol showed stronger bacteriostatic activity at 0.0025-0.05 mg/mL and bactericidal activity at 0.005-0.1 mg/mL. Inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations for γ-terpinene were slightly higher than for previous compounds (MIC at 0.05-0.2 mg/mL, and MBC at 0.07-0.3 mg/mL). Streptomycin expressed inhibitory effects at 0.0005-0.001 mg/mL and bactericidal activity at 0.0005-0.002 mg/mL. It can be seen that the essential oil showed the highest bactericidal activity (MBC = 0.002 mg/mL) against Micrococcus flavus and the lowest (MBC = 0.2 mg/mL) against Listeria monocytogenes. However, S. thymbra essential oil showed lower antibacterial activity than streptomycin, and was quite similar to thymol (MIC = 0.01-0.1 mg/mL and MBC= 0.05-0.15 mg/mL) and slightly lower or similar to carvacrol (MIC = 0.0025-0.025 mg/mL and MBC = 0.005-0.1 mg/mL), and it was stronger or similar to γ-terpinene (MIC at 0.05-0.2 mg/mL, and MBC at 0.07-0.3 mg/mL). Results of antifungal activity of compounds tested are presented in Table 3 . As in the case of the antibacterial activity, the oils showed strong antifungal potential. S. thymbra oil possessed strong activity with (MIC) 0.001-0.025 mg/mL and showed fungicidal effects at 0.001-0.1 mg/mL. MIC and the MFC for thymol are 0.01-0.05 mg/mL, while carvacrol showed MIC at 0.0025-0.025 mg/mL and MFC at 0.005-0.05 mg/mL. MIC and (MFC) for γ-terpinene were at 0.015-0.05 mg/mL and 0.02-0.1 mg/mL. Bifonazole showed lower antifungal activity than the tested oils. MIC was at 1.5-2 mg/mL and MFC 2-2.5 mg/mL. Penicillium ochrochloron was the most sensitive fungus, with MBC at 0.001 mg/mL, while Candida albicans was the most resistant species when treated with this oil. Fungi were in general more sensitive than bacterial species (Tables 2 and 3 ). In general, S. thymbra essential oil showed antifungal activity similar or lower than thymol (MIC and MFC 0.01-0.05 mg/mL) and lower than carvacrol (MIC at 0.0025-0.025 and MFC at 0.005-0.05 mg/mL), and it was slightly better or similar to γ-terpinene (0.015-0.05 mg/mL and 0.02-0.1 mg/mL). Satureja oils represent an inexpensive source of natural antibacterial substances that exhibit potential for use in food systems to prevent the growth of foodborne bacteria and to extend the shelf life of processed foods [26] . More recently, [11] concluded that the essential oil of S. thymbra (1%), as well as its hydrosol fraction (100%), present sufficient bactericidal effect on bacterial biofilms formed on stainless steel suggesting that the use of natural antimicrobial agents could provide alternative or supplementary ways for the disinfection of microbial-contaminated industrial surfaces. Previous investigations showed that the essential oil of S. thymbra was found to be active against the bacteria E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. typhimurium, S. sonnei and S. aureus and the yeast C. albicans [7] . S. thymbra essential oil from Greece possessed very good antifungal properties with low MIC (0.1-1.0 μL/mL) and MFC (0.2-2.0 μL/mL) values [23] . The antifungal activity results of S. thymbra oil against M. perniciosa, a contaminator of Agaricus bisporus, obtained by the micro atmosphere method, showed MIC of 0.001-0.05 μL/mL and MFC of 0.1-0.25 μL/mL [35] . More recently, it has been shown that the oil of S. thymbra exhibited minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in the range of 0.6-5.0 μg/mL, and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) in the range of 2.5-10.0 μg/mL, while fungi were more sensitive with MIC and MFC at 1.25-2.5 μg/mL, and fungicidal activity in range of 2.5-5.0 μg/mL [36] . It is evident that there is a relationship between the high activity of tested oil and the presence of phenol components such as thymol and carvacrol. It seems likely that thymol and carvacrol interfere with the activity of cell wall enzymes like chitin synthase/chitinase as well as α-and β-glucanases of fungi [37, 38] . According to literature data, the mode of action of essential oils against bacteria cannot be attributed to one specific mechanism, and not all of these mechanisms are separate targets, some are affected as a result of another mechanism being targeted [39, 40] . One of important action of essential oils against bacteria is their hydrophobicity, which enables them to partition in the lipids of the bacterial cell membrane and mitochondria, disturbing the structures and rendering them more permeable and leading to leakage of cell content [41] [42] [43] . Although a certain amount of leakage from bacterial cells may be tolerated without loss of viability, extensive loss of cell contents or the exit of critical molecules and ions will lead to death [44] . Consequently, the high content of phenolic components may account for the high antimicrobial activity of carvacrol-type oils [45] . It should be noted that the antimicrobial activity of S. thymbra against the pathogenic bacteria and fungi was lower (or equal) as compared to the essential oils compounds tested here-thymol and carvacrol. Presumably, this activity is not derived only from the presence of these phenols, but part of the activity resulted from the effect of minor active constituents. Thus, synergistic or antagonistic activity between some components may affect the observed antimicrobial activity of the oils. In the study of Cosentino et al. [46] , the high p-cymene content observed in Sardinian T. capitatus and T. herba-barona 'sample a' may have antagonized the antimicrobial action of phenols, resulting in a weaker activity of these oils, in comparation to thymol and carvacrol. This may explain in part the higher activity of thymol and carvacrol when evaluated separately. Also, some authors discussed synergistic and antagonistic effect of components and essential oils [47] . They concluded that the effects of thymol and carvacrol are responsible for the different antibacterial activities of the essential oil of various oil chemotypes. On the other hand, there are also some reports concerning a disadvantageous antagonistic effect, weakening the essential oil action as compared with its constituents. The oil and components tested in here showed higher antibacterial activity against Gram (+) than Gram (−) bacteria. Gram negative bacteria are, in general, more resistant than Gram positive ones [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] . Overall, the oils and single compounds were more active vs. yeasts and Gram positive bacteria than Gram negatives, has reported in similar studies [43, 46, [56] [57] [58] .
