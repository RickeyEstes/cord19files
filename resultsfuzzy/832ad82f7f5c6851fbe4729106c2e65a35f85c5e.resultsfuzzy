CCFs and FCFs slightly shrank after the DAS treatment, whereas no visible change was observed for PFs. Also, when CFs were subjected to the wrist action shaker, untreated filters were broken after 15 min whereas treated filters remained intact. This is presumably because of crosslinking or entanglement of DAS with the cellulose. SEM images of untreated and treated filters with different DAS suspensions, as shown in Fig. 2 , confirm this hypothesis. CFs are composed of main fibers and fibrillates of small diameter. CCF contains small amounts of fibrillates, whereas FCF has numerous fibrillates. DAS was crosslinked with fibrillates of CFs, resulting in the increase of fibrillate diameter (Fig. 2D-I) . Granular DAS was also observed on the surface of the main fibers at high DAS concentration (Fig. 2D, H-I) . In contrast, DAS was merely deposited on the fiber surface of PF with insignificant change in fiber diameter due to the lack of reaction between hydrophobic propylene filters and DAS. The difference in materials yields differences in the impact of the DAS treatment, as will be demonstrated in the following section. The pressure drop results are listed in Table 1 . Both filter type (p o0.0001) and DAS concentration (p o0.0001) are significant as well as the interaction between filter type and DAS concentration. Since the pressure drop of FCFs at 3 Lpm was out of the measurable range, the pressure drop at 0.5 Lpm was measured and then converted for 3 Lpm by where V is face velocity. The pressure drops of untreated and DAS treated PFs were less than 1 in. significantly decreased with increases of DAS concentration. Finally, those treated with the 4% DAS suspension reached the NIOSH limit for respirators. Meanwhile, the pressure drop of untreated FCF was too high to use as a ventilation filter and respirator, but those of the treated FCFs (p o0.0001) significantly decreased although the pressure drops were still over the criterion for respirators. Fig. 3A and B shows that the VRE and QF of the test filters as a function of concentration of DAS suspension. For the PF, the DAS treatment did not change the fiber diameter of the filters, resulting in insignificant change in VRE. Hence, there was no significant change in QF. For the CF, the treatment did not cause discernible impact on the VRE although the treatment reduced air resistance as pressure drop decreased. Accordingly, an increase in the QF was observed. The QFs of untreated and 4% DAS treated CCFs were 0.77 and 1.46 kpa À 1 and those of FCFs were 0.25 and 1.85 kpa À 1 , respectively. The impact on FCF (e.g., increase of 7.4 times) was larger than on CCF (e.g., increase of 1.9 times). The amount of crosslinking of the fibrillates is likely responsible for the difference. To evaluate the inactivation capability of DAS treated filter mats, the RS of treated filters as a function of concentrations of DAS suspension is displayed in Fig. 4 . All filters show similar tendencies, with RS decreasing with increasing concentration of DAS suspension, indicating the inactivation effect of the DAS treated filters against the MS2 collected on the treated filter. Aldehyde functionality of polymeric molecules dispersed from gel formation through heating in preparation is the source attributed to the biocidal capacity on treated surfaces (Song et al., 2009) .
