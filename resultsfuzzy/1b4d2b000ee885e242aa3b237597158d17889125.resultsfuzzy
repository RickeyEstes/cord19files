The ICC results of the cultured cells showed that PC2, CPE and preproNPY had sub-cellular redistribution along the cell body and tips (Figs. 2-4) . The ICC results of NS20Y or RGC-5 cells were similar. In the differentiated cells, the up-regulations of CPE and preproNPY protein levels were observed (Figs. 3B and 4B). Because the ICC results on mouse cortex neuron were similar to those of mature rat retina, the ICC results of mature mouse cortex tissue were only showed in the paper. Compared with the ICC results of breast adenocarcinoma tissue, the mature tissues (rat retina, mouse brain cortex, or normal breast) showed higher PC2 activity, more proPC2, less CPE, and less preproNPY protein expression level (Figs. 5-8) .  50 g of protein was loaded in SDS-PAGE lane and transferred on PVDF membrane. In the comparative experiments, more proPC2 protein expression in the mature tissues and more proCPE protein expression in the tumor cells or tissue were observed . preproNPY protein expression were observed in the tumor cells or 5 of 8 adenocarcinoma tissue specimens, but no expression of the protein was observed in the mature tissues (Figs. 9B and 12A) . Compared with the NS20Y or RGC-5 undifferentiated cells, less proPC2, more proCPE and more preproNPY protein expressions were observed in the differentiated cells (Fig. 9A) .
