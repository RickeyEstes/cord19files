The 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase was predicted to bind with atazanavir (Kd 94.94 nM), followed by efavirenz, ritonavir, and other antiviral drugs that have a predicted affinity of Kd > 100 nM potency (Table   1 ). No other protease inhibitor antiviral drug was found in the Kd < 1,000 nM range. Although there is . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

For example, a docking study of lopinavir along with other HIV proteinase inhibitors of the CoV proteinase (PDBID 1UK3) suggests atazanavir and ritonavir, which are listed in the present prediction results, may inhibit the CoV proteinase in line with the inhibitory potency of lopinavir (14) . According to the prediction, viral proteinase-targeting drugs were predicted to act more favorably on the viral replication process than viral proteinase through the DTI model (Table 2 -6) . The results include antiviral drugs other than proteinase inhibitors, such as guanosine analogues (e.g., acyclovir, ganciclovir, and penciclovir), reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and integrase inhibitors. Among the prediction results, atazanavir was predicted to have a potential binding affinity to bind to Table   2 -6) . Also, ganciclovir was predicted to bind to three subunits of the replication complex of the 2019-nCoV: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Kd 11.91 nM), 3'-to-5' exonuclease (Kd 56.29 nM), and RNA helicase (Kd 108.21 nM). Lopinavir and ritonavir, active materials of AbbVie's Kaletra, both were predicted to have a potential affinity to 2019-nCoV helicase (Table 3 ) and are suggested as potential MERS therapeutics (15) . Recently, approximately $2 million worth of Kaletra doses were donated to China (16) , and a previous clinical study of SARS by Chu et al. (17) may support this decision (17). Another anti-HIV drug, Prezcobix of Johnson & Johnson, which consists of darunavir and cobicistat, was to be sent to China (16) , and darunavir is also predicted to have a Kd of 90.38 nM against 2019-nCoV's helicase (Table 3) . However, there was no current supporting literature found for darunavir to be used as a CoV therapeutic.
