Out of the 197 RV-positive samples by multiplex PCR, we were able to sequence 76 samples (39%). Sequence analysis based on 395 bp of 5' UTR region of 76 samples yielded 69 viral types (seven strains had identical sequence) (Figure 3) . The most prevalent was RV-C (36/76; 47.4%) followed by RV-A (34/76; 44.7%) and RV-B (6/76; 7.9%). Most of RV-A sequences formed a distinct phylogenetic group; only strain RI/HR409-18 (along with a reference strain MF978777) clustered with RV-C strains (Figure 3) . Of the three respective groups, strains belonging to the group C were the most diverse, with identity of 41.6% (142 of 341 identical positions), while group B was the most conserved with 71.5% identity among strains (241/337). Group A comprised strains which shared an overall 54.3% identical positions (183/337). Calculated p-distances between groups showed group A and C are more closely related (p-distance 0.234) than to group B. Similar p-value was calculated between group B and group A (p-distance 0.31) or group C strains (p-distance 0.33), respectively. No significant difference has been demonstrated in clinical symptoms based on the RV species, with the exception of increased frequency of antibiotic treatment in those infected with RV-A species (P = 0.012) ( Table 2) . Most RV cases were detected from September to December, and all three species co-circulated during the analyzed period (Figure 4) .
