Expression of TMEM2 in liver tissues and HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. IHC demonstrated strong expression of TMEM2 in the cytoplasm in normal liver tissue and significantly reduced expression of TMEM2 in liver tissues from patients with chronic HBV infection (Figure 1a) . The western blot analysis also showed a significant reduction of TMEM2 expression in liver tissues from patients with chronic HBV infection and HepG2.2.15 cells with HBV genomic DNA compared with normal liver tissues and HepG2 cells without HBV genomic DNA, respectively (Figure 1b ). In addition, the mRNA level of TMEM2 in liver tissues from patients with chronic HBV infection and HepG2.2.15 cells with HBV genomic DNA was significantly lower than that in normal liver tissues and HepG2 cells without HBV genomic DNA, respectively (Figure 1c ; *Po0.05, **Po0.01). Effects of TMEM2 on the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in HBV-infected HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory effects of TMEM2 on HBV infection in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells, western blot was used to evaluate the expression of a number of key components of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in HBV-infected HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. We found that the levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 in all HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells were reduced by HBV infection. No significant difference in the expression of Tyk2, JAK1, STAT1, and STAT2 was detected among any of the HBV-infected cells (Figure 4a ). After HBV infection, the levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells were lower than those in HepG2 cells, and the levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 in HepG2 TMEM2 cells were higher than those in HepG2 cells ( Figure 4a ). In addition, the levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 in HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells were higher than those in HepG2.2.15 cells following HBV infection ( Figure 4a ). After TMEM2 overexpression or knockdown, there were no significant differences in the cellular level of total interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells (Figure 4a ). We also compared the expression of myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) and 2สน,5สน-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), two interferon-inducible proteins in the downstream JAK-STAT signaling pathway, between HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells with and without HBV infection using RT-qPCR. We found that HBV infection significantly reduced the expression of MxA in all cells ( Figure 4b ). However, in the two groups of cells without HBV infection, the expression of MxA in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells was significantly lower than that in HepG2 cells (Figure 4b , *Po0.01). The expression of MxA in HepG2 TMEM2 cells was significantly higher than that in HepG2 cells (Figures 4b, Po0 .01). In addition, overexpression of TMEM2 increased MxA expression in HepG2.2.15 cells irrespective of the presence of HBV infection. A similar expression profile was also obtained for OAS1. HBV infection significantly reduced the expression of OAS1 in HepG2 and HepG2 TMEM2 cells (Figure 4b ). The expression of OAS1 in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells was significantly lower than that in HepG2 cells (Figure 4b, Po0 .01). The expression of OAS1 in HepG2 TMEM2 cells was significantly higher than that in HepG2 cells (Figure 4b, Po0 .05). The expression of OAS1 in HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells with or without HBV infection was significantly higher than that in HepG2.2.15 cells (Figure 4b, Po0 .01).
