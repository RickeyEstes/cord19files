During Respondents and non-respondents were similar with regard to age, sex, race/ethnicity, reported symptoms, influenza vaccination status, and time from illness onset to influenza VE study enrollment (data not shown). Respondents were more likely to be enrolled in the influenza VE study during the period after influenza circulation peaked (63% vs 46%, P<.0001). Among respondents, 55 (5%) were excluded because they did not attend school outside the home (n=37), had influenza B with no lineage data (n=12), had influenza A and B or B/Yamagata and B/Victoria coinfection and could not be classified into a single influenza virus group (n=3), or had missing data on days absent from school (n=3). Among the 1027 children included in this study, viral infections were detected in 747 (73%) ( Table 1)
