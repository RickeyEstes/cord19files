Astrovirus particles have T = 3 icosahedral symmetry Purification of HAstV has been very challenging, and sufficient material was only available to perform cryoEM once for immature HAstV-8 and mature HAstV-1. Icosahedral image analysis of electron cryomicrographs (Fig. 2 ) yielded 3D maps at~25 Å resolution ( Fig. 3a and b ). Both particles display two concentric layers of density that conform to T = 3 icosahedral lattice symmetry. A nearly identical inner layer forms a solid capsid shell 45 Å thick with an outer diameter of~350 Å. This capsid shell has a chiseled appearance assembled from 180 protein subunits in which trimeric facets form a plateau ( Fig. 3a and b, bottom) . The trimeric facets are in close contact across the icosahedral 2-fold (2F) symmetry axes, with depressions at the 5-fold (5F) and 3-fold (3F) symmetry axes and a groove across the local 2F axes. Distal from the solid capsid shell is an outer layer of globular spike-like densities. The spikes are~40 Å in diameter, with a somewhat elliptical shape, yielding an outer particle diameter of~440 Å. The stoichiometry suggests that the spikes are dimers with contributions from adjacent trimer facets (Fig. 3a , color code and labels). Thin linker densities connect the spikes to the capsid shells and are visible in 3D reconstructions of negatively-stained particles ( Fig. S1 ) or when the isosurface is lowered significantly in the cryoEM maps. The lack of well-defined linker density may be the result of the narrowness of the linker, minor heterogeneity in maturation cleavage, or wobbling of the spike head, which would obscure the connections during icosahedral symmetry averaging.
