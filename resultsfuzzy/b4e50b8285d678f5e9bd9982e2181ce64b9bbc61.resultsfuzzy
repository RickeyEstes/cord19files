Ba in HW bot tom and fly ashes is gen er ally pres ent in the resid ual frac tion (87.8-96.1%, 1203-3332 mg kg ¡1 ), while the per cent ages asso ci ated with the exchange able (0.1-4.0%), carbon ate (0.4-2.6%), Fe-Mn oxide (<1.5%) and organic frac tions (2.0-4.1%) are rel a tively low. The resid ual frac tion is gen er ally less mobile, and thus dif cult to leach out into the envi ron ment. Accord ingly, it is believed that Ba in HW ash is rel a tively safe after land fll ing, although the con cen tra tion is high in the ash (Tables 2 and 3) . It has been reported that Cd can form rel a tively vol a tile compounds with chlo ride and con dense in fly ash in the incin er a tion pro cess; thus it is easy to leach out from the ash under nat u ral condi tions (Aba nades et al., 2001) . The sequen tial extrac tion results in this study sup ported this fnd ing. Fig. 2 shows that approx imately 50% of Cd in HW fly ash is con cen trated in exchange able (34.4-51.2%, 27.3-191 mg kg ¡1 ) and car bon ate frac tions (6.6-17.3%, 9.2-36.7 mg kg ¡1 ), and 2.2-29.3% (12-15.6 mg kg ¡1 ) was observed in the Fe-Mn oxide frac tion. These results are con sis tent with previ ous stud ies (Krish nan et al., 1992; Su kan dar et al., 2006) . Gen er ally, Cr in both bot tom and fly ashes is mainly in the fractions that are rel a tively dif cult to leach out under nat u ral condi tions: the Fe-Mn oxide frac tion (9.7-16.1%, 3.1-65.4 mg kg ¡1 ), organic mat ter frac tion (4.1-12.7%, 4.0-25.4 mg kg ¡1 ) and resid ual frac tion (76.4-84.7%, 24.1-527 mg kg ¡1 ). A rel a tively small amount of Cr exists in the exchange able frac tion (0.1-2.8%) or the car bonate frac tion (0.5-1.9%). Most of the organic mat ter was oxi dized dur ing the incin er a tion pro cess. There fore, it is con sid ered that met als bound to this frac tion are rel a tively low. How ever, it can be seen from Fig. 2 that Cu is quite abun dant in the organic mat ter frac tion (21.8-60.1%, 133-832 mg kg ¡1 ). Among the ash sam ples, fly ashes con tain sig nif cantly higher amounts of exchange able and car bon ate frac tions than bot tom ashes, indi cat ing that Cu in HW fly ashes has more mobil ity than Cu in bot tom ashes. More over, pre vi ous stud ies have shown that Cu oxides have cat a lytic effects in the for ma tion of organic pol lu tants such as PCDDs and PCDFs (Chang and Chung, 1998 ; Hata naka et al., Table 6 Com pa ri sion of heavy metal con cen tra tions in the HW ashes and the MSW ashes (mg kg ¡1 ) 2004). This view point sup ports the high amount of Cu occur ring in the organic mat ter frac tion in this study. Mn mainly exists in the Fe-Mn oxide frac tion (20.9-54.7%, 76.9-831 mg kg ¡1 ), while the resid ual frac tion is 36.4-62.2% (229-1083 mg kg ¡1 ). The per cent ages of Mn asso ci ated with the exchange able (0-6.2%), car bon ate (1.3-9.9%) and organic frac tions (0.8-5.3%) are rel a tively low. Ni mainly con cen trates in the resid ual frac tion (67.1-85.9%, 29.9-496 mg kg ¡1 ) and Fe-Mn oxide frac tion (8.0-24.9%, 2.8-73.2 mg kg ¡1 ). The exchange able and car bon ate frac tions account for only 0-3.5% and 0.4-2.9%, respec tively. Com par a tively, Ni in fly ashes has higher amounts of exchange able, car bon ate and Fe-Mn oxide frac tions than in the bot tom ashes, indi cat ing that Ni in fly ashes has a higher potential to be released into the envi ron ment. Sig nif cant amounts of Pb are asso ci ated with the resid ual fraction (30.4-72.6%, 122-4244 mg kg ¡1 ) and Fe-Mn oxide frac tion (21.3-44.9%, 52.9-2347 mg kg ¡1 ). Gen er ally, only a small amount of Pb presents in exchange able, car bon ate and organic frac tions, in the range of 0-7.1%, 2.8-14.7% and 2.8-4.9%, respec tively. Compared to bot tom ashes, fly ashes con tain more car bon ate and exchange able Pb, show ing that Pb in fly ash is more mobile. Most of Sn in the HW ash sam ples is in the resid ual fraction, account ing for 97.4-98.9% (77.3-1427 mg kg ¡1 ). There fore, although high con cen tra tions of Sn were detected in the ash samples, it has lim ited envi ron men tal avail abil ity. The dis tri bu tion pat terns of Zn in bot tom and fly ashes are quite dif fer ent. In the bot tom ashes, large amounts of Zn presents in the Fe-Mn oxide frac tion (33.2-57.2%, 3636-4064 mg kg ¡1 ) and Fig. 2 . Frac tion dis tri bu tion of var i ous heavy met als in the HW ashes. F1: Exchange able; F2: car bon ate; F3: Fe-Mn oxide; F4: organic mat ter; F5: res i due frac tion. * Aver age val ues of dupli cate sam ples from dif fer ent incin er a tors were reported, in which BA12 is aver age of BA1 and BA2, BA34 is aver age of BA3 and BA4, FA12 is aver age of FA1 and FA2, FA34 is aver age of FA3 and FA4. the car bon ate frac tion (6.1-18.2%, 671-1289 mg kg ¡1 ). In the fly ashes, Zn mainly is pres ent in the exchange able (1.3-72.4%, 274-76,040 mg kg ¡1 ), car bon ate (13.9-36.9%, 7509-14,603 mg kg ¡1 ) and Fe-Mn oxide frac tions (12.0-50.6%, 10,296-12,979 mg kg ¡1 ), while Zn in the organic mat ter (1.2-5.0%, 1008-1285 mg kg ¡1 ) and res i due frac tion (0.11-6.3%, 120-1279 mg kg ¡1 ) is very low. This indi cates that Zn pres ent in fly ash may pose a leach ing potential to the envi ron ment. Dur ing incin er a tion, the mech a nisms gov ern ing the fate of metals, includ ing nucle at ing, con dens ing and coag u lat ing aer o sol, are extremely com plex. In the case of MSW, it has been reported that the vapor phase of Cd, Pb, Zn, and As trans ferred into fly ash by nucle ation and depo si tion and most of them existed in the form of metal lic or metal oxide, which was eas ily sol u ble (Lang ton, 1989; Wil liam and Wendt, 1993) . Based on the results obtained in the cur rent study, the fol low ing mech a nisms gov ern ing metal spe ci ation could be deduced: Ba, Cr, Ni and Sn, with high boil ing points, were mainly transferred into the bot tom ash, with only small amounts car ried into the gas eous phase. These met als were observed both in the bot tom and fly ash sam ples and did not eas ily react dur ing the incin er a tion pro cess, and thus were mainly found in the sta ble matri ces (res idue frac tion). As, Cd, Pb, and Zn, with lower boil ing points, could eas ily vol a til ize into flue gas at higher tem per a tures and con dense on the sur face of the fly ash result ing in the for ma tion of compounds that can leach. On the other hand, the spe cies of Cu were quite dif fer ent from other met als. High Cu con tent in the organic mat ter frac tion could be attrib uted to the fact that Cu had cat a lytic effect in the for ma tion of organic pol lu tants, e.g., PCDD/DF (Chang and Chung, 1998; Hata naka et al., 2004) , and thus was typ i cally found with the organic frac tion of the ash sam ples. Table 7 presents the TCLP leach ing results. It was observed that both Cd and Pb in the leach ate of the eight fly ash sam ples exceeded the USEP A reg u la tory lim its by 2.9 to 50 times and 1.1 to 38 times, respec tively. Cu leach ing from FA3, FA4, FA5, and FA8 also exceeded the reg u lated level. These results were con sis tent with the results obtained in the sequen tial extrac tion tests. Therefore, the fly ashes should be cat e go rized as haz ard ous wastes that need strict man age ment and dis posal. Com par a tively, the bot tom ashes gen er ally cause less envi ron men tal con cern, except that the amount of Cr leached from BA9 exceeded the reg u la tory value. A fur ther inves ti ga tion on BA9 showed that the raw mate rial of this sam ple con tained an abun dant amount of bro ken pin heads, which may con trib ute to the high TCLP leach ing result for Cr, since pin heads are made from alloys con tain ing Cr. There fore, sep a rate col lec tion of metal lic items, such as pin heads, from HW could be extremely impor tant to reduce the envi ron men tal impact of ashes.
