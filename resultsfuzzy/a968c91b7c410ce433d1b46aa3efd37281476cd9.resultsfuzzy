After the final boost, end-point dilution ELISA was used to detect the antibody response against BJ01 or Rp3-S protein in immunized mice (Fig. 2) . Other than the negative control, all immunized mice produced antibodies against HIV/Rp3-S or HIV/BJ01-S pseudovirus, albeit displaying different reactivity against the two pseudovirus antigens. When tested against HIV/Rp3-S pseudovirus, antisera generated to the full-length Rp3-S had a significantly higher titer than those from the other three groups (Fig. 2A) . Also, the titers of sera from the two chimeric plasmids CS 310-518 and CS 259-518 were higher than that from the BJ01-S construct. On the other hand, when tested against HIV/BJ01-S pseudovirus, the antibody titer was lowest for the group immunized with plasmid expressing the full-length Rp3-S protein (Fig. 2B) . There was little difference in titer among the other three groups. All mouse sera generated using DNA immunization were tested for their ability to neutralize the HIV/BJ01-S or HIV/CS 318-510 pseudovirus. As shown in Fig. 3A , mouse sera from BJ01-S, CS 310-518 or CS 259-518 showed strong neutralizing activity to the pseudovirus HIV/BJ01-S, whereas the antiserum from Rp3-S showed a much weaker neutralizing activity to the same pseudovirus. Interestingly, all the sera, except the vector control group, had neutralizing activity to HIV/CS 318-510 (Fig. 3B) . However, the Rp3-S serum showed neutralizing activity to HIV/CS 318-510 only at high concentrations, indicating the presence of some cross-neutralization epitopes located outside the BJ01-S RBD. Similar to the results obtained above using mice sera, bat sera naturally infected by SL-CoV had a much stronger reactivity towards HIV/Rp3-S than the other three pseudoviruses (Fig. 4) . Knowledge of immunogenicity and immunodominant regions of major viral antigens is important for rational design of effective vaccines and diagnostic tests. SL-CoVs found in bats are very similar to human isolates of SARS-CoV in that they have almost identical genomic organization and their gene products share a high level of amino acid sequence identity. We have shown previously that despite substantial antigenic cross-reactivity between bat sera from naturally infected animals and SARS-CoV, there was no crossneutralization detected [1] . This discrepancy could be explained by the low level of sequence identity shared at the N-terminal domain of the S proteins between the two classes of viruses [1, 2] . The N-terminal region of coronavirus S proteins is known to be responsible for virus attachment to susceptible host cells, hence a major target of neutralizing antibodies [4] . In this study, DNA constructs expressing four different S proteins, SARS-CoV BJ01, SL-CoV Rp3 S and two chimeras, were used to generate hyperimmune sera in mice via DNA immunization. The immunogenicity of these proteins was determined using ELISA against the S SL and S SARS proteins expressed in the form of HIV pseudoviruses. The neutralization activity of the mouse sera was further determined using the HIV/BJ01-S and HIV/CS 318-510 pseudovirus. The results obtained clearly demonstrated that mice immunized with BJ01-S, CS 310-518 or CS 259-518 generated antibodies with higher antigenic and neutralizing activity to HIV/BJ01-S and HIV/CS 318-510 than HIV/Rp3-S. Vice versa, mice immunized with Rp3-S displayed higher reactivity to HIV/Rp3-S than HIV/ BJ01-S. These results demonstrated that SL-CoV and SARS-CoV shared only a limited number of immunogenic epitopes in their S proteins and the major neutralization epitopes are substantially different among these two viruses. Since the RBD for the S SL protein is not known, we were not able to conclude whether the immunodominant regions overlap with the receptor attachment site. For the same reason, we have been unable to identify a suitable susceptible cell line to conduct neutralization tests for the HIV/Rp3-S pseudovirus. Until such an assay is available, it will be impossible to conduct a detailed comparative study of major neutralization epitopes between the two different viruses. The study conducted with bat sera and four different pseudoviruses provided indirect evidence suggesting a substantial overlap of immunodominant and neutralizing epitopes for the S SL protein. This was best demonstrated by the reactivity of bat sera against pseudovirus HIV/Rp3-S and HIV/CS 310-518 , respectively. The replacement of the sequence from aa 310-518 alone almost completely abolished the bat antibody reactivity towards the S SL protein. A variety of SL-CoV and other CoVs found in bats demonstrate that bats are natural reservoir of diverse CoVs. The high density of bats in habitats provides ample opportunities for recombination, which will in turn increase virus diversity and the chance of spill over into other hosts including humans leading to zoonotic disease outbreaks [3, 9] . Recently, it was shown that a synthetic SL-CoV containing a very small fragment of the SARS-CoV S gene was able to infect and cause disease in mice, further highlighting the potential emergence of novel viruses with subtle sequence difference in the S gene [10] . The results obtained from this work would suggest that the current diagnostic tools and candidate vaccines developed for SARS-CoV are not likely to be specific or effective enough to combat a disease outbreak caused by a SL-CoV variant. It is therefore necessary that we continue strategic research in this area to be able to rapidly response to disease outbreaks caused by coronaviruses with similar genetic and pathogenic features, but with different S gene sequences and receptor specificities. ) and one negative bat sera (Neg) was determined against SARS-CoV in a previous study [1] .
