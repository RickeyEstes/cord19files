The framework for preparedness and response to pandemic influenza in Ghana Developed using a framework recommended by the WHO [25] , and thus organized into five thematic areas, [ 18, 32] Justification for delineated actions: All planned actions/activities are adequately explained and justified [17, 23] Composition of national pandemic planning committee: Committee formation process is deliberative and composition is all-inclusive with members from national, regional, and district levels; membership include technical and lay person [23, 32] Communication to at risk population/Information symmetry: Efforts are outlined in the plan to keep the public continuously informed on all aspects of the planned interventions. Differential messages for various audiences are developed and are culturally and scientifically appropriate, pandemic phase alerts are incorporated into the communication machinery. [17, 23, 43] Prioritization, and allocation of scarce resources: Triage systems for priority setting in providing critical care, or for allocation of scarce resources (vaccines, intensive care units, hospital beds, human resource allocation, and staffing) during a pandemic are clearly outlined. Plan establishes priority groups nuanced by local contexts [17, 32, [43] [44] [45] Healthcare worker duty to care adequately explained: Plan addresses healthcare worker duty to provide care in pandemic circumstances. That is the issue of special obligations of health care professionals during an outbreak. Are the rights and responsibilities of health care professionals especially in the context of pandemic flu preparedness clarified? [17, 32, 43, 46] Limitations of proposed interventions: Plan frankly acknowledges limitations of various proposed actions or interventions (both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical) [42] Leadership and coordination Plan indicates which agencies will lead various components/ actions of the plan [23, 32] Facilities designation Facilities where patients would be treated are clearly identifies or designated [23] Stockpiling of antiviral, vaccines and personal protective equipment: Provisions are made for national stockpiling of antivirals, vaccines, and personnel protective equipment; and such provisions are sensitive to locale-specific competing demands [17, 23, 43] Ethics training for healthcare workers Plan adequately outlines pandemic-specific ethics training for various categories of people working in healthcare setting [23] Timelines for planned activities: Timelines are explicitly defined for all activities outlined in the plan [23] Border issues, travel advisories, and trade policies Plan explicitly and adequately addresses cooperation with neighboring countries. [23, 32, 43] Co-operation with the WHO other development partners, and sister countries Plan acknowledges the essence of cooperating with these institutions [23, 32] Ethics consideration in clinical protocols: Plan-specific operational guidelines/protocols are developed and are ethics-sensitive [23] Use of vaccines and antivirals: Guidelines are issued on how antiviral, vaccines, personal protective equipment should be used during an outbreak (different from allocations). Logistical infrastructure for rapid distribution of stockpiled antivirals, vaccines, and personal protective equipment are in place. [23, 32, 43] Plan review mechanism: Plan explicitly states a mechanism for continuous review and updates [23] Continuity of essential services: There is evidence of planning to ensure continuity of essential services including non-health sector essential services such as ensuring business continuity, capacity for corpse disposal etc. [43] Considerations of equity, social justice, vulnerable groups: Plan addresses special needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups [21] Home care management of infected patients: Plan recommends home care management of infected patients, and provides guidelines [23] Ghana's NISPPI aims to improve on earlier preparedness and response structures and mechanisms. Ghana has in the past responded to threats from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Avian Influenza by producing response guidelines, albeit basic ones [15] . The five thematic areas of the current framework are summarized and discussed.
