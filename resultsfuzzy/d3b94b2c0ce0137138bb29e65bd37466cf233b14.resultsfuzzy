To exemplify the use of the methodological metaphor of triangulation (Erzberger and Kelle, 2003) for drawing inferences from complementary results, we have drawn on the results of a UK based study by (Fig. 2) . In the UK, members of district nursing teams (DNs) provide most nursing care to people at home in the last year of life. Following concerns that inadequate education might limit the confidence of some DNs to support patients and their carers' at home, and that low home death rates may in part be related to this, the Department of Health (DH) identified good examples of palliative care educational initiatives for DNs and invested in a 3-year national education and support programme in the principles and practice of palliative care. Shipman et al.'s study evaluates whether the programme had measurable effects on DN knowledge and confidence in competency in the principles and practice of palliative care. The study had two parts, a summative (concerned with outcomes) quantitative component which included 'before and after' postal questionnaires which measured effects on DNs' (n = 1280) knowledge, confidence and perceived competence in the principles and practice of palliative care and a formative (concerned with process) qualitative component which included semi-structured focus groups and interviews with a sub-sample of DNs (n = 39). While their theoretical proposition may not be explicitly stated by the authors, there is clearly an implicit theoretical proposition that the educational intervention would improve DNs knowledge and confidence (theoretical proposition 1, Fig. 2 ). This was supported by the quantitative findings which showed significant improvement in the district nurses confidence in their professional competence post intervention. Qualitative results supported and complemented the quantitative findings as the district nurses described several benefits from the program To illustrate how the methodological metaphor of triangulation can be used to draw inferences from convergent findings, we have drawn on the example of a Danish study by (Fig. 3) . This study was conducted to explore experiences of group cohesion and changes in quality of life (QoL) among people (n = 55) who participated in a weekly physical exercise intervention (for six weeks) during treatment for cancer. The study, conducted in a Danish hospital, involved the use of structured QoL questionnaires, administered at baseline and post intervention (at six weeks) to determine changes in QoL and health status, and qualitative focus groups, conducted post intervention (at six weeks), to explore aspects of cohesion within the group. With regards to the theoretical proposition of the study (Fig. 3) , group cohesion was seen as essential to understand the processes within the group that facilitated the achievement of desired outcomes and the satisfaction of affective needs as well as promoting a sense of belonging to the group itself. This proposition was deductively tested in an intervention where patients exercised in mixed gender groups of seven to nine members during a nine hour weekly session over a six week period and was supported by both the empirical quantitative and qualitative findings. The quantitative data showed significant improvements in peoples' emotional functioning, social functioning and mental health. The qualitative data showed how the group setting motivated the individuals to pursue personal endeavors beyond physical limitations, that patients used each others as role models during 'down periods' and how exercising in a group made individuals feel a sense of obligation to train and to do their best. This subsequently helped to improve their social functioning which in turn satisfied their affective needs, improving their improved emotional functioning and mental health. Fig. 3 illustrates the theoretical propositions, empirical findings from qualitative and quantitative data and the logical relationships between these. Both the quantitative and qualitative findings, demonstrating improvements in participants' emotional and social functioning and their mental health, can be attributed to the nature of group cohesion within the programme as expected. Qualitative and quantitative results that seem to contradict each other are often explained as resulting from methodological error. However, instead of a methodological flaw, a divergent result could be a consequence of the inadequacy of the theoretical concepts used. This may indicate the need for changing or developing the theoretical concepts involved (Erzberger and Kelle, 2003) . The following example of using the methodological metaphor of triangulation (Erzberger and Kelle, 2003) for drawing inferences from divergent results is intended as an example rather than an attempt to change the theoretical concept involved. In a study by (Fig. 4) , some results were found to be divergent which was explained as resulting from the use of
