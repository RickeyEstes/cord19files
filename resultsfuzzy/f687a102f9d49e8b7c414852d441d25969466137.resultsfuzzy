Primers and probes for selected viruses related to human diseases were designed and used to verify the results obtained by NGS (Table  A1 ) and to determine the prevalence of these viruses after conventional treatment and ozone treatment. The most common viruses identified were human feces pecovirus, picobirnavirus, parvovirus, parvoviruslike virus, adenovirus genotype 41, astrovirus 4, and gokushovirus. Three microliters of extracted nucleic acids from the 12 samples were analyzed by qPCR in a 25 μL reaction mixture containing 1 × Reaction Mix (Invitrogen), 20 U RNaseOUT™ (Invitrogen), 0.5 μL SuperScript ® III/Platinum ® Taq Mix (Invitrogen), and 0.6 μM of each primer, and 0.2 μM of probe. The qPCRs for astrovirus and picobirnavirus were performed with initial reverse transcription at 50°C for 30 min and 95°C for 15 min. The qPCR was performed for 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 55°C for 1 min for most viruses, but with extension at 53°C for adenovirus 41 and 54°C for gokushovirus and astrovirus 4. The qPCRs were performed in a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems), and all samples were analyzed in duplicate.
