These results are based on declarative information reported in the INCIPAVE database during its first opening on September 2018, before cleaning. A total of 158 VAP (76.8% according to CDC criteria) was declared during 11685 days of MV. At least one pathogen was identified in 58.7% case of VAP, with more than one in 11.6%. Diagnosis was made on Tracheal Aspirates, with or without quantitative cultures (51% and 12.9% respectively), and on Blind Protecting Specimen Brush with or without quantitative cultures (7.7% and 2.6% respectively). Identified pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosas (PA, 12.1%), Haemophilus influenzae (HI, 12.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (SA, 7.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP, 5.4%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (SM, 3.4%). HI and SP were involved in "early VAPs" (< 6 days) and PA, SM and SA were reported in "late onset" VAPs. Conclusion: Tracheal aspirate with quantitative culture is still the method of choice to diagnose VAP in PICU. Nosocomial pathogens are mainly involved after 6 days of MV. A more precise analysis is planned after cleaning of the database, including a special reading of each case of VAP. Introduction: Parapneumonic effusions and pleural empyema are common complications of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia in children. There is not yet a consensus concerning the management of this pathology, and expert's recommendations are scarce. The objective of this study was to compare whether the evolution of our patients benefited or not from drainage procedures. Patients and methods: This retrospective single-center study collected data from 79 children treated for pleural infection at the Strasbourg University Hospital from May 2010 to May 2016. 2 groups of children were compared concenring medical and or invasive treatment received (thoracentesis, chest drain insertion with or without instillation of fibrinolytic agents and surgical techniques). Results: 43 children benefited from an invasive treatment strategy (IT), and 36 from antibiotics alone (AA). The epidemiological data of the 2 groups was comparable (comorbidities, vaccination status). Significant differences were the duration of oxygen dependence-3.1 days in the AA group versus 7.6 days in the IT group (p < 0.001), the time elapsed to obtaining apyrexia-4 days in the AA group versus 7.9 days in the IT group (p = 0.009), overall hospital stay and duration of intensive care. Initial C-reactive Protein levels were measured at 160.5 mg/L in the AA group versus 258 mg/L in the IT group (p < 0.001). We proposed a predictive score for an invasive procedure based on initial CRP and pleural ultrasound data. Introduction: Protective mechanical ventilation and adjuvant therapies for severe ARDS are well-defined in adult and pediatric population. However, no clearly identified recommendations are available to perform a protective ventilation during pediatric V-V ECMO. The aim of this study was first to describe potential associations between ventilatory settings during ECMO and outcome in ARDS patients. The secondary goal was to compare three periods of interest to identified significant modification and their potential consequences on the survival rate. Patients and methods: We performed an observational monocentric retrospective study, from January 2007 to December 2017. All patients treated by ECMO V-V for a refractory ARDS were included. We collected data's at day 1, day 3 day 7 and day 14 of ECMO. Three periods of interest were defined (before 2010, from 2010 to 2014 and after 2014). We retrospectively collected the data's from our local database, approved by the French Data Protection Authority. Results: 83 patients treated by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were included. We identified an increase of the number of ECMO V-V for pediatric refractory ARDS associated with a higher survival rate throughout the three periods. The OSI (oxygenation saturation index) was the only pre-ECMO parameter significantly associated with a higher mortality. We identified a significant modification the adjuvant therapy illustrated by a sharpe increase for the use of neuromuscular blockers (from 14% to 52%) and the prone positioning before ECMO (from 5% to 85%). We also show evidence of a strong modification of the ventilatory parameters during ECMO. As example, the tidal volumes are significantly lower throughout the periods (5 cc/kg vs 3.5 cc/kg) such as the driving pressure (28 vs 14 cm of H2O). In contrary, the PEEP is higher in the most recent period. Finally, we identified an improvement of the survival rate all over the three period. Conclusion: Recent modifications of ventilatory parameters during V-V ECMO for pediatric ARDS aimed at implementing a better lung protection. These modifications are associated with a better survival. However, the correlation between survival and ventilators settings remained unclear and a multicentric study should help physician to identify prognosis factors. Introduction: Septic shock (SS) has recently been redefined in adults as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host response to infection. Due to pediatric specificities, adult definition cannot be just transpose to children. Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a particular entity of infectious shock, with large pediatric prevalence. Some toxins specific to Streptococcus A and Staphylococcus aureus lead to superantigenic activation of T-lymphocytes, responsible for major cytokines storm with multi-organ failure. While immunosuppression induced by SS is now demonstrated in adults and children, we investigated whether similar immune disorders arise during TSS. Patients and methods: Single-center prospective study included all children under 18 years-old, consecutively admitted into Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for SS ("Surviving Sepsis Campaign" Goldstein criteria), or TSS (Center for Disease Control), between September 2014 and July 2018. Controls were recruited from outpatients admitted for an elective benign surgery, without any criteria of infection. Immune monitoring realized by flow cytometry included HLA-DR expression on monocytes (mHLA-DR), total lymphocyte count, and lymphocyte sub-populations' proportions (CD4* and CD8* T cells, regulatory T cells, NK cells, B cells). Samples were analyzed at Day 1, 3 and 7, after shock onset. Clinical data were collected prospectively, as well as severity scores and secondary nosocomial infection occurrence. Results: Forty-six SS, 12 TSS and 30 controls were recruited. At each time points, mHLA-DR in SS and TSS groups were decreased, compared with controls ( fig 1) . Moreover, mHLA-DR was significantly higher in TSS at day 1 and 3, than SS. Lymphocytes' time course also differs between SS and TSS-more profound lymphopenia occurred at day 1 in TSS than SS, but correction was faster in TSS between day 1 and 3, while between day 3 and 7 in SS. No difference was observed concerning regulatory T cells. Thirteen patients with SS presented secondary infections (28%), compared to only one in TSS group (8%). Conclusion: Our study showed that despite similar initial shock, immune response is significantly different between SS and TSS. TSS didn't induce persistent immune-suppression, as seen in SS-highlighted by different time course of mHLA-DR, lymphocytes and secondary infection occurrence. There is no only one type of septic shock but different infectious shocks with different immune responses and clinical outcomes. These results reinforce objective to better characterize immune state of patients in intensive care, in order to propose personalized medicine with adapted immune-modulatory therapies. Introduction: Septic shock is a common pathology in intensive care units responsible for a high mortality rate. Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is used when patients no longer respond to standard treatments, including inotropes. Recently, in a multicenter study involving more than 500 children with septic shock, the Septic Shock Score (SSS) proved highly reliable in identifying patients at risk of death and was able to define refractory septic shock. The objective of our study is to evaluate two versions of the SSS, the bedside SSS (bSSS) and the computed (cSSS) in a group of patients hospitalized with septic shock who received ECLS support. Patients and methods: This retrospective study includes patients aged 1 month to 18 years hospitalized in the intensive care units of the Necker Enfant Malade, Trousseau and Bicêtre hospitals for septic shock requiring ECLS assistance between January 2010 and March 2018. Five data collection times were chosen-sepsis time, ECLS decision time, ECLS starting time and end of hospitalization time. At the first 4 collections, clinical and biological criteria were collected to calculate the different predictive scores of septic shock. The group of deceased patients and the group of living patients were compared at these different times. Results: 38 patients were included in our study, 24 of which died during the hospitalization. At all times studied, both the bSSS and the cSSS had poor reliability in identifying deceased children. The vasoactive-inotropic score is significantly higher at ECLS starting time in deceased patients and it decreases between ECLS decision time and ECLS starting time in living patients. Conclusion: This is a pilot study that tested a database of children in septic shock who had received ECLS in APHP's intensive care units. The continuation of the study will be carried out as part of a collaborative project of the European Society of Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care (ESPNIC), and will extend to 27 other pediatric intensive care units to clarify ECLS success criteria, characterize the evolution of organ failure and thus better define ECLS uses in children with septic shock. We aimed to identify early predictors of a CO, defined as an ICU stay > 2 days, the need for vital support or death in children with SCD. Patients and methods: Retrospective observational cohort study of SCD patients over a 5-year period were conduced in French territories in the Americas teaching hospital and SCD referral center. Results: Of the 2559 infant's admissions in the Carabdrepa cohort, 174 (6.8%) had a CO, of whom 6 (0.2%) death. Using multivariate analysis, we found significant predictors of CO-an episode of dactylitis (defined as pain and tenderness in the hands or feet) before the age of one year (OR 3, IC 95% 1.9-45.5), a hemoglobin level of less than 7 g per deciliter (OR 1.75, IC 95% IC 0.98-2.84), and leukocytosis (OR 1.21, IC 95% 0.8-1.83), a respiratory rate more than or equal to 32 cycles min (OR 1.01, IC 95% 0.84-1.18).), a Delay between first symptom and medical contact (OR 1.3, IC 95% 1.04-1.65), and an admission for sepsis (OR 1.32, IC 95% 0.44-3.85). Our model demonstrated good predictive performances in terms of discrimination (c-statistic-0.813) and calibration. Conclusion: Sickle-cell disease children are at high risk of life threatening complications. Episodes of dactylitis, with a sustained drop of hemoglobin + associated with a sepsis context and a delay in medical care are strong predictors of a complicated outcome. Introduction: Traumatology is the leading cause of death in young adults and children. Hemorrhagic shock is a major aggravating factor in trauma, however there are very few data available in the pediatric population. TRISS method [1] offers a standard approach for evaluating outcome of trauma care, enabling the determination of an individual probability of survival (Ps) for each patient according to Trauma and Injury Severity Score. The aims of our study were-1) to identify multiple trauma children admitted with hemorrhagic shock in our pediatric Trauma Center, 2) to analyze factors that could influence the outcome using the TRISS method. Patients and methods: We performed a monocentric, observational, descriptive, retrospective study on medical records. The included patients were children under 18 years of age admitted for multiple trauma and presenting with hemorrhagic shock upon arrival. The patients included were identified by means of a computerized database internal to the service. The primary outcome was death. Results: From January 2014 to April 2018, 947 multiple trauma children were admitted in the service. Among them, 41 (4.3%) were in hemorrhagic shock upon admission and included in the study. The median interquartile age and weight were 3.0 [2.0-10.7] years and 16.0 [12.9-32.5] kg, respectively. Their trauma profile was very similar to other polytraumatized children, with 73% of head trauma. The global principles of Damage Control Resuscitation have been met, including the application of the massive transfusion protocol. However, only 10% of children actually correspond to the usual definition of "massive blood transfusion" (70 ml kg over 24 h) and only 37% required a surgical hemostasis procedure. The overall mortality was 41% with an average TRISS of 45%. We had 2 "unexpected" survivors and 1 "unexpected" death according to the TRISS method in our population. Conclusion: In our study, 4.3% of the multiple trauma children were admitted in hemorrhagic shock in our center. These children were heavily traumatized with an overall mortality rate of 41%. However, the TRISS method revealed an observed mortality 3.9% lower than the predicted mortality, with +2.4% of "excess survivors". When we checked the medical records of the 2 "unexpected" survivors, they seemed to have beneficiated from a more aggressive prehospital resuscitation care. Introduction: Due to collapse and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) maneuvers, major traumatic injuries may complicate the course of resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients (OHCA). Our goals were to assess the prevalence of these injuries, to describe their characteristics and to identify predictive factors. We found an association between muscle lactate clearance and hospital mortality with a statistically significant difference at H54 (p = 0.037), H60 (p = 0.033) and H72 in the study (p = 0.012). We also found an association between clearance of muscle lactate to pyruvate ratio and hospital mortality with a statistically significant difference at H54 (p = 0.015), H60 (p = 0.001), and H72 of the study (p = 0, 04 Introduction: Mortality from septic shock remains high. Undernutrition during septic shock is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality.The objective of our study is to evaluate the interest of muscle mass loss by ultrasound measurement of quadriceps thickness in patients admitted to intensive care for septic shock, as a prognostic factor for mortality. The study duration was 3 years, 602 patients were included (wrongly included, n = 38 + secondary excluded, n = 112) so 462 patients were analyzed (mean age 62.6 ± 20.5 y, Charlson score-3.1 ± 2.6). After adjudication, 124 patients have been classified as worsening and 338 patients without deterioration. At admission there was no difference between the 2 groups on SIRS criteria count, WBC, CRP and lactates (cf table). The centralized analysis is in progress to select the combination of biomarkers with the best prognostic performance. Conclusion: While no vital signs nor biological markers or parameters can predict worsening of patients, the prognostic value of a panel of blood markers in EDs could help identification of septic patient at risk of worsening at time of admission and develop specific management. On the day when septic shock was settled (D1), there were no differences between the two groups in the mean plasma concentrations, neither in those of SChEA, nor in those of PCT and CRP. However, the comparison of mean plasma concentrations of SChEA, PCT and CRP on D3 and D5, showed a significant difference between survivors and non-survivors. (Table 1) . During the study period, 169 patients with acute exacerbation of COPD were admitted in our ICU, 65(38.5%) were emphysema patients. The mean age (± SD) was 67.99 ± 9.8 years, the sex ratio was at 7.04. The most common comorbidities were hypertension in 54(32%) patients, cardiac failure in 36(21.3%) situations and diabetes in 32(18.9%) cases. The mean SAPSII score was 38.34(± 13.29). On ICU admission 94 of patients have acute circulatory failure and 124(73.4%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Mortality rate in this study was around 49.1%, length of stay (LOS) was at 8 [1 -69] and length of invasive ventilation medians was 8 [1 + 39] . During their ICU stay evolution was marked by death of 83(49.1%) patients mortality was significantly higher in patients with cardiac failure (63.88% vs 44.71%, P = 0.043) and those who necessitate the introduction of catecholamines in admission (60% vs 23% P = 0.000). A high plasma urea and plasma creatinine concentration were significantly associated with mortality P = 0.000, P = 0.003 respectively. Conclusion: COPD exacerbation is a frequent cause of hospitalization in ICU, severe form requiring mechanical ventilation were associated with a poor outcomes. Development of shock and acute kidney injury were significantly associated with mortality.  Eighty nine patients were enrolled. Mean age was 67 ± 9 years and male female ratio was 3.9. Seventy nine percent were smokers and 50% were classified GOLD stage 3. History of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and invasive ventilation (IV) were found in 64% and 34% of all cases respectively. Mean progression of COPD was 9 ± 5 years and mean exacerbations frequency was 1.89 ± 0.9 per year. Mean duration of symptoms before hospitalization (DSBH) was 5 ± 4 days. Mean SAPS II and APACHE II were 38 ± 15 and 20 ± 8 respectively. Mean pH, paCO2 and paO2 fiO2 were 7.28 ± 0.2, 80 ± 28 mmHg and 221 ± 105 respectively. Mean GCS was 11 ± 4 and it was less than 9 in 25% of all cases. The predominant precipitating factor for acute exacerbation (AE) was respiratory tract infection (69% of all cases). Thirty two percent of our patients had a septic choc at admission. Symptomatic treatment was based on inhaled bronchodilators, corticosteroids and mechanical ventilation-NIV in 70% and IV in 61% of all cases. Twenty two patients were intubated immediately after hospitalization and 32 after NIV failure. Mortality was 40%. The duration of COPD progression (p = 0.039), exacerbations frequency per year (p = 0.013), prior IV (p = 0.04), DSBH (p = 0.002), SAPS II (p = 0.003), GCS (p < 10 −3 ), pH (p = 0.01) and septic choc at admission (p = 0.004) were all predictive of IV in univariate analysis but only GCS (p = 0.002) was significant in multivariate analysis. Conclusion: Requirement of IV in AECOPD depends on the severity of the underlying respiratory illness, the gravity of the AE and the quality of an early management. Thus, basic treatment improvement and an early appropriate treatment of the AE might reduce its severity and the need of IV. The optimal protocols titrated PS or Ti in order to reduce AI, the software simulates the corresponding values of tidal volume and respiratory frequency and its effect on intrinsic PEEP and gas trapping. The difference in settings and respiratory mechanic between virtual cases and patients were not significant (Table) . Conclusion: AI was able to change according to PS or Ti settings within the same range as the study from Thille et al. Simulation with the software SimVA is realistic and may help to teach interactively ventilatory settings and asynchronies in COPD patients under Pressure Support Ventilation anywhere without any risk for the patient. Introduction: We aimed to determine the incidence and the prognostic impact [mortality and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay (LOS)] of pulmonary embolism (PE) in critically ill patients with severe acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Patients and methods: This is a retrospective study performed during a 10-year period in the ICU of Habib Bourguiba University Hospital (Sfax, Tunisia). All patients with severe acute exacerbation of COPD were included. The diagnosis of PE is confirmed by spiral computed tomography scan showing one or more filling defects or obstruction in the pulmonary artery or its branches. Results: During the study period, 169 patients with acute exacerbation of COPD were admitted in our ICU. The mean age (± standard deviation) was 67.99 ± 9.2 years. During their ICU stay, 28 patients (17%) developed PE. The diagnosis was confirmed within 48 h from ICU admission in all cases. The comparison between the two groups (with and without PE) showed that they had the same baseline characteristics. However, most of patients on PE group developed shock (71.4%) on ICU admission or during ICU stay. ICU mortality was significantly higher in the PE group (67.9% vs 44.5%, P = 0.024). In addition, the ICU LOS was significantly higher in the PE group than the PE-free group (P = 0.005). Conclusion: Our study showed that PE is common in patients with severe COPD exacerbation requiring ICU admission. Moreover, PE was significantly associated with higher mortality and ICU LOS in critically ill patients with severe COPD exacerbation. Introduction: The impact of home ventilation on survival of patients with chronic respiratory failure is still debated. Most studies that included patients with chronic hypercapnia away from hospitalisation, showed a positive effect on the frequency of exacerbation. The impact of home ventilation on survival in patients discharged from the ICU is not well proven. The current study reports long term survival according to the use of home ventilation. Patients and methods: All patients surviving their ICU stay for hypercapnic respiratory failure were considered for home ventilation on the following basis-frequent exacerbators under long-term oxygenotherapy in obstructive lung disease, and signs of nocturnal hypoventilation in restrictive lung disease. Vital status was checked in January 2018 and Kaplan-Meier survival curve was drawn (with Log Rank statistical test). Results: During the study-period 229 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. The mean age was 67 ± 11 years and 70% were male the majority (74%) had COPD. Home ventilation was administered to 176 patients while the remaining 53 did not. At a mean follow-up of 50 ± 24 months, patients under home ventilation had significantly longer survival than patients without home ventilation (Log Rank < 0.05), Figure. Conclusion: Home ventilation is associated with prolonged survival in ICU patients surviving hypercapnic respiratory failure. We questioned 991 students-97, 2% had already heard about OD, and 69.9% were aware that it was possible to practice it in Morocco. 80.3% had an idea about lethal diseases requiring the use of transplantation and 75% were able to identify transplantable organs and tissues, 43.5% underestimated the number of people waiting for transplants, 57.6% thought that the acts of organs removal and transplantation are done in private clinics. 62.8% were aware of the law governing OD in Morocco, only 31.4% had trust in this law and 91.3% ignored the registration steps in the donation acceptance register. 71.4% were convinced of the perfect compatibility of OD with Muslim religion, the majority of students (92.5%) were in favor of OD. Among the group of respondents refusing the donation of their organs, the right of refusal and religious obstruction were at the top of the list of the determinants of the refusal with respective prevalence of 47.10% and 24.3%, and only 23.3% of the students had expressed their opinion to their relatives. Conclusion: This study shows that young Moroccans are supportive of OD despite their limited knowledge of the subject. The development of this therapy must go through information and regular motivation of people. General conferences and seminars represent a solution in spreading awareness among generations in order to establish a strong policy of organ donation in an early future.
