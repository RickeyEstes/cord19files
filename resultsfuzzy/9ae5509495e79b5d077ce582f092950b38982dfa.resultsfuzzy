Look-alike areas were eliminated by using the texture map of the phase, but where a pixel value was similar to oil spill, a false detection would occur. It is highly likely that a ship will be detected as an oil spill, so a median filter was used to remove it, producing a phase texture map without a ship. Figure 3 shows the image before and after applying the NL-means filter to the VV intensity image. Since speckle noise distort the true pixel value, in the image before applying the filter, pixel having a darker value than surrounding pixels could be observed even it is located in the oil-free region. Likewise, some pixel which is significantly bright compared to adjacent pixels could be exists in the oil-covered region (Figure 3a) . These cause false detection and un-detection in oil spill detection, respectively. On the other hand, in NL-means filtered image, it can be seen that the same type of cover have substantially similar brightness values to each other without degrade of spatial resolution. That is, no downgrade of image quality was observed in the NL-means filtered image, and the oil spill and oil-free areas were easily distinguished ( Figure 3b ). However, a biogenic film region checked with red box still had similar pixel values to the oil spill. In order to visually confirm the change of the pixel values before and after the filter, we specified a line (start at the A and end at the A') for generating the profile map. filtered image's value. It can be seen that the blue color line oscillates greatly in the vertical direction, which means that the difference between the adjacent pixels is large due to the speckle noise. In contrast, the orange color line changes relatively smoothly and slightly. The most notable range in the profile map is red dot box area. Some points of blue line is marked high position, even though it is an oil spill area. When the oil spill is detected using the image having these value, there is a high possibility that the pixels in the box are not classified as oil spill. Likewise, in the oil-free region, the blue line points are observed to be relatively lower than the orange line. These pixels are highly likely to be classified as oil spill. Therefore, the value of orange line is more effective in detecting oil spill. Sensors 2018, 18, x 8 of 16 Figure 4 shows two profile maps simultaneously. The blue color line is generated using the value of image before applying the NL-means filter and the orange color line is generated using the NLmeans filtered image's value. It can be seen that the blue color line oscillates greatly in the vertical direction, which means that the difference between the adjacent pixels is large due to the speckle noise. In contrast, the orange color line changes relatively smoothly and slightly. The most notable range in the profile map is red dot box area. Some points of blue line is marked high position, even though it is an oil spill area. When the oil spill is detected using the image having these value, there is a high possibility that the pixels in the box are not classified as oil spill. Likewise, in the oil-free region, the blue line points are observed to be relatively lower than the orange line. These pixels are highly likely to be classified as oil spill. Therefore, the value of orange line is more effective in detecting oil spill. Figure 5 shows a normalized intensity texture map, which is the second input neuron of ANN. The map just has a correlation with some parts of oil spill, urban area and coast line (Figure 5a ). The pixel value of urban area is calculated high because there is variety scatterer, and since the map was calculated using a moving window, values were also high along the coastline. However, after normalization by using NL-means filtered intensity map, the values of urban area and coast line are relatively reduced, while the values of all oil spill areas is entirely increased (Figure 5b ). Especially, in the thin oil spill region, there was almost no difference of the value with thick oil spill region. However, since the texture map which is obtained using the sum of squares has high noise level. So, the NL-means filter is applied to degrade the noise of texture map. The normalized intensity texture map showed a high correlation even in the thin oil spill area but the look-alike area also has a similar value to that of oil spill. The pixels in the same cover type of the coherence image have similar value. In other words, the contrast between ocean and oil spill is so large that oil spills can be effectively detected. Figure 6a shows the coherence image before the ship removal and Figure 6b shows the coherence image after the removal. The value of oil-free surface, as mentioned earlier, is close to 1, and oil spill area and the ship can be seen that a value closer to zero. So, to reduce false detection, the ship must be removed. In this study, the median filter with window size of 21 × 21 was applied to the image for removing the ship. Figure 6c ,d is a before and after the filtering of magnified image which includes ship. In filtered image, it can be seen that the value of the ship is much more similar to that of the surrounding ocean, compared to the ship which was clearly contrasted with the sea in image before applying the filter. Even though the ship is not completely removed from the coherence image, there is a very low probability of false detection, because the oil spill area and ship are clearly contrasted in intensity based images which is other input neurons of the ANN approach using coherence map. Figure 5 shows a normalized intensity texture map, which is the second input neuron of ANN. The map just has a correlation with some parts of oil spill, urban area and coast line (Figure 5a ). The pixel value of urban area is calculated high because there is variety scatterer, and since the map was calculated using a moving window, values were also high along the coastline. However, after normalization by using NL-means filtered intensity map, the values of urban area and coast line are relatively reduced, while the values of all oil spill areas is entirely increased (Figure 5b ). Especially, in the thin oil spill region, there was almost no difference of the value with thick oil spill region. However, since the texture map which is obtained using the sum of squares has high noise level. So, the NL-means filter is applied to degrade the noise of texture map. The normalized intensity texture map showed a high correlation even in the thin oil spill area but the look-alike area also has a similar value to that of oil spill. The pixels in the same cover type of the coherence image have similar value. In other words, the contrast between ocean and oil spill is so large that oil spills can be effectively detected. Figure 6a shows the coherence image before the ship removal and Figure 6b shows the coherence image after the removal. The value of oil-free surface, as mentioned earlier, is close to 1, and oil spill area and the ship can be seen that a value closer to zero. So, to reduce false detection, the ship must be removed. In this study, the median filter with window size of 21 × 21 was applied to the image for removing the ship. Figure 6c ,d is a before and after the filtering of magnified image which includes ship. In filtered image, it can be seen that the value of the ship is much more similar to that of the surrounding ocean, compared to the ship which was clearly contrasted with the sea in image before applying the filter. Even though the ship is not completely removed from the coherence image, there is a very low probability of false detection, because the oil spill area and ship are clearly contrasted in intensity based images which is other input neurons of the ANN approach using coherence map. Figure 7a shows the CPD image, which is generated from the HH and VV polarizations image, so that the oil-free surface is generally close to zero, and it is noisy in the land, ship and oil spill areas. Figure 7b shows that the phase texture image obtained by applying Equation (4) to the CPD image. This map has a high correlation with the oil spill and a low value in the look-alike region having the weak-damping effect. In look-alike region, this map contained no bright pixels. Therefore, if using the phase texture image which have been removed ship, it is possible that oil spill is accurately detected without false detection caused by look-alike and ship. As in the case of removing the ship from the coherence image, the median filter was applied to the image and the signal by the ship was reduced (Figure 7c ). so that the oil-free surface is generally close to zero, and it is noisy in the land, ship and oil spill areas. Figure 7b shows that the phase texture image obtained by applying Equation (4) to the CPD image. This map has a high correlation with the oil spill and a low value in the look-alike region having the weak-damping effect. In look-alike region, this map contained no bright pixels. Therefore, if using the phase texture image which have been removed ship, it is possible that oil spill is accurately detected without false detection caused by look-alike and ship. As in the case of removing the ship from the coherence image, the median filter was applied to the image and the signal by the ship was reduced (Figure 7c ). Figure 8 shows the four input neurons of the ANN. The oil spill and oil-free surfaces are clearly distinguished from each other in the four images. In particular, thick oil is more distinguishable in Figure 8c ,d generated from the phase information compared to other images. In addition, in the lookalike region with red box, its value is similar to the surrounding ocean value unlike Figure 8a ,b, because it is well-known that the PDF of the look-alikes are very close to that of oil-free surfaces in the coherence and phase texture maps [32] . However, the thin oil areas could be more easily recognized from the images generated by intensity information, and the strong contrast between oil spill and ship was found in Figure 8c ,d. Figure 8 shows the four input neurons of the ANN. The oil spill and oil-free surfaces are clearly distinguished from each other in the four images. In particular, thick oil is more distinguishable in Figure 8c ,d generated from the phase information compared to other images. In addition, in the look-alike region with red box, its value is similar to the surrounding ocean value unlike Figure 8a ,b, because it is well-known that the PDF of the look-alikes are very close to that of oil-free surfaces in the coherence and phase texture maps [32] . However, the thin oil areas could be more easily recognized from the images generated by intensity information, and the strong contrast between oil spill and ship was found in Figure 8c ,d. Using the four neurons, oil spill probability maps were generated. When generating the probability maps, 50% of the oil spill area (as classified by visual inspection) was used to train and validate the neural network model. Figure 9a ,b shows oil spill probability maps estimated by Process 1 and Process 2, respectively. The results of Process 1 and Process 2 show no significant difference when compared it visually. Both results seem to have properly detected the oil spill area. The Figure 9c ,d shows the histogram of each probability to compare the distribution of the values. In Process 1, a peak is observed around a probability of 0.1, which is formed by pixels corresponding to the oil-free surface. The frequency of other probabilities except the probability due to the oil-free surface is not much different. In other words, it is difficult to determine the threshold value for distinguishing between oil spill and oil-free because the peak due to oil spill is not observed clearly. On the other hand, in Figure 8d , peaks are observed at a probability of about 0.1 and one peak is additionally observed at around 0.9, which is a pixel representing oil spilled on the ocean. It can be seen that it is easier to determine the threshold between the two covers in probability because the two distributions have distinct peaks. That is, when all four input neurons are used, it means that the oil spill area can be detected more accurately. A (look-alike region), B (oil spill region) and C (oil-free surface region) sites were selected to compare the probabilities of the two results according to cover type. Figure 10a -c shows the look-alike region of intensity, and the results of Process 1 and Process 2, respectively. Using our new procedure, the probability of the look-alike was clearly lowered (Figure 10c ). For the probability map calculated using only the intensity layers, the highest probability value of a look-alike was ~0.65 (Figure 10b ). For the probability map calculated using all layers, the highest probability value of a look-alike was less than ~0.36 (Figure 5c ). This reflects the ability of the phase texture map to distinguish biogenic film and oil spills. Based on these results, we confirmed that using dual-polarized HH and VV phase information together is more effective for detecting oil spills than using only intensity images. Using the four neurons, oil spill probability maps were generated. When generating the probability maps, 50% of the oil spill area (as classified by visual inspection) was used to train and validate the neural network model. Figure 9a ,b shows oil spill probability maps estimated by Process 1 and Process 2, respectively. The results of Process 1 and Process 2 show no significant difference when compared it visually. Both results seem to have properly detected the oil spill area. The Figure 9c ,d shows the histogram of each probability to compare the distribution of the values. In Process 1, a peak is observed around a probability of 0.1, which is formed by pixels corresponding to the oil-free surface. The frequency of other probabilities except the probability due to the oil-free surface is not much different.

On the other hand, in Figure 8d , peaks are observed at a probability of about 0.1 and one peak is additionally observed at around 0.9, which is a pixel representing oil spilled on the ocean. It can be seen that it is easier to determine the threshold between the two covers in probability because the two distributions have distinct peaks. That is, when all four input neurons are used, it means that the oil spill area can be detected more accurately. A (look-alike region), B (oil spill region) and C (oil-free surface region) sites were selected to compare the probabilities of the two results according to cover type. Figure 11b is the histogram of site B. The histograms represented by green color in both graphs are based on Process 1, and the histograms in red color are based on Process 2. In the histogram of Process 1, the probability of an oil-free area being oil spill was relatively higher than in the probability map using phase information together with intensity information. Whereas oil-covered pixel is represented slightly low. As a result of numerical analysis, in process 2 using phase information, mean and standard deviation of oil-free region decreased by 0.02 and 0.01, respectively. In oil region, mean value decreased by 0.04 and standard deviation of 0.03. This difference is due to the coherence and phase texture maps. Both images showed a distinct contrast value between oil spill and oil-free ocean surface pixels. Coherence values were closer to 1 in ocean areas, but considerably smaller in the oil region. In contrast, for the phase texture map high pixel values were seen in the oil spill area, whereas low values were seen for ocean surface areas. So, the probability map produced using the proposed method allow for the clear discrimination. The results were validated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve where the X-axis represented 1-specificity (where a false case is predicted to be false) and the y-axis represented sensitivity (where a true case is classified to be true; Figure 6 ). In this study, specificity relates to non- Figure 10a-c shows the look-alike region of intensity, and the results of Process 1 and Process 2, respectively. Using our new procedure, the probability of the look-alike was clearly lowered (Figure 10c ). For the probability map calculated using only the intensity layers, the highest probability value of a look-alike was~0.65 (Figure 10b ). For the probability map calculated using all layers, the highest probability value of a look-alike was less than~0.36 (Figure 5c ). This reflects the ability of the phase texture map to distinguish biogenic film and oil spills. Based on these results, we confirmed that using dual-polarized HH and VV phase information together is more effective for detecting oil spills than using only intensity images. Figure 11a is the histogram of site C and Figure 11b is the histogram of site B. The histograms represented by green color in both graphs are based on Process 1, and the histograms in red color are based on Process 2. In the histogram of Process 1, the probability of an oil-free area being oil spill was relatively higher than in the probability map using phase information together with intensity information. Whereas oil-covered pixel is represented slightly low. As a result of numerical analysis, in process 2 using phase information, mean and standard deviation of oil-free region decreased by 0.02 and 0.01, respectively. In oil region, mean value decreased by 0.04 and standard deviation of 0.03. This difference is due to the coherence and phase texture maps. Both images showed a distinct contrast value between oil spill and oil-free ocean surface pixels. Coherence values were closer to 1 Figure 11b is the histogram of site B. The histograms represented by green color in both graphs are based on Process 1, and the histograms in red color are based on Process 2. In the histogram of Process 1, the probability of an oil-free area being oil spill was relatively higher than in the probability map using phase information together with intensity information. Whereas oil-covered pixel is represented slightly low. As a result of numerical analysis, in process 2 using phase information, mean and standard deviation of oil-free region decreased by 0.02 and 0.01, respectively.

Both images showed a distinct contrast value between oil spill and oil-free ocean surface pixels. Coherence values were closer to 1 in ocean areas, but considerably smaller in the oil region. In contrast, for the phase texture map high pixel values were seen in the oil spill area, whereas low values were seen for ocean surface areas. So, the probability map produced using the proposed method allow for the clear discrimination. oil spill pixels judged to be oil-free pixels, whereas sensitivity relates to oil spill pixels classified as oil-covered pixels. The area under the curve (AUC) is the calculated value of the bottom area of the ROC curve. AUC values range from 0.5 to 1, and those closer to 1 (100%) represent more meaningful models. Values less than 0.5 are considered to be worthless [40] . According to [41] , AUC is divided into five levels: excellent (0.9-1.0), good (0.8-0.9), fair (0.7-0.8), poor (0.6-0.7), and fail (0.5-0.6). In this study, 50% of the oil spill samples was used for the training data and the accuracy of the results was verified using the remaining 50%. Verification of the two results showed 95.03% and 95.19% high accuracy, respectively, as shown in Figure 12 . This reflects the fact that both results detected almost all of the oil spill areas and the numbers of biogenic film pixels were relatively low in comparison. The results confirm that using the proposed algorithm, the ocean surface is less likely to be classified as oil and the removal effect of biogenic film is improved. However, the results would not be enough to present the robustness of the proposed method. To overcome this limitation, further validation process should be performed by using several oil spill accidents including different wind situations and look-alikes.
