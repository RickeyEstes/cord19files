In October 2011, an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis occurred in a farm located in the province of Grosseto (Tuscany, Central Italy), that housed 450 ovines (250 sheep and 200 lambs) and 140 bovines (130 cows and 10 calves). The infection occurred only in lambs, and about 50% of the animals were affected, with a mortality rate close to 80%. The lambs presented with severe, yellowish liquid diarrhea, loss of weight, and depression. On November 5, 2011, a lamb was brought to the IZS to carry out post-mortem examination and identify a potential cause of death. The animal presented pulmonary edema, liver congestion and catarrhal enteritis. Samples from liver, gut, lung, kidney and an intracardiac cloth were tested for pathogenic bacteria; Clostridium perfringens was isolated from the liver and the kidney, whereas Escherichia coli was isolated from the gut. The possible eziopathogenic role of these bacteria was investigated but further analysis revealed that enteropathogenic (ETEC), enterotoxic (EPEC) or enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) E. coli, as well as C. perfringens toxins were absent. The gut also tested negative for Coronavirus and Rotavirus. On the other hand, Cryptosporidium sp. oocysts were detected microscopically after Kynioun staining, and cryptosporidiosis was further confirmed by an ELISA test. On December 2, 2011, fecal samples were collected from 21 adult sheep, 6 lambs and 6 calves and tested for the presence of Cryptosporidium sp. oocysts. Only one sample from a lamb tested positive by immunofluorescence. The son of the farm's owner, a child aged 18 months, experienced an acute enteritis in concomitance with the outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in farmed lambs. The main symptom was non-bloody diarrhea, without fever and vomiting, that lasted for at least four weeks. Laboratory tests ruled out common bacterial species (Salmonella, Campylobacter and Shigella) as the cause of diarrhea, and the child was prescribed with a rehydration therapy and probiotics. However, his conditions worsened and he was hospitalized on November 10, 2011, because of episodes of diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and lack of appetite. Laboratory tests ruled out Rotavirus and Adenovirus as a cause of diarrhea, whereas both microscopy and immunochromatography revealed the presence of Cryptosporidium sp. The child received a parenteral rehydration therapy for 18 h and during the hospitalization he had no further episodes of vomiting or diarrhea, and no fever. He started to eat and drink normally and was discharged on November 13, 2011. Notably, a fecal sample collected from the child during a control visit on November 29, 2011, tested positive for Cryptosporidium by immunofluorescence, indicating an incomplete clearance of the infection. The child had no direct contact with the infected animals; therefore the exposure must have been indirect, likely by an accidental ingestion of oocysts carried on his father's working clothes and/or footwear. Indeed, the father used to pick up his child from a childcare centre directly from the farm. To identify the species of Cryptosporidium associated with the infection of lambs and of the child, a fragment of the CpA135 gene was amplified by PCR and sequenced. The analysis revealed 100% homology with C. parvum (Gen-Bank acc. no. AJ006593) in 4 lamb samples, including 2 microscopically negative samples collected on December 2, 2011, and in the sample from the child. The identification of C. parvum is consistent with the notion that clinical cryptosporidiosis in sheep is caused only by this species and presents as a mild to severe yellowish liquid diarrhea with a strong odor, loss of weight, depression, and death usually involving animals up to one month of age . Samples from 6 calves and 21 adult sheep tested negative at this assay. To identify C. parvum subtypes, the 5 region of the GP60 gene, which contains polymorphic trinucleotide repeats, was amplified from the 5 samples that were positive at the CpA135 assay. The IIaA20G2R1subtype, named according to the nomenclature introduced by Sulaiman et al. (2005) , was identified in the sample from the lamb collected on November 5, 2011, as well as in the sample from the child collected on November 29, 2011. Thus, the same and rare C. parvum GP60 genotype was identified in the feces from the lamb and the child. The IIaA20G2R1subtype was also identified in 2 samples from lambs collected on December 2, 2011, whereas the IIaA15G2R1 subtype was detected in another lamb also collected on December 2, 2011. Molecular subtyping of C. parvum is an important tool for investigating the zoonotic potential of oocysts shed by livestock and the most commonly employed technique is sequencing of the highly polymorphic GP60 gene (Xiao, 2010) . To date, only a modest number of specimens from sheep have been subgenotyped using this approach, and this has shown the presence of two families, known as IIa and IId (Díaz et al., 2010) . The IIa family is commonly found in livestock, and the subtypes identified in sheep are also found in calves (Quílez et al., 2008; Díaz et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2010) , and some have been associated with infection in humans (Table 1) . On the contrary, the family IId is strongly associated with lambs, at least in Spain (Quílez et al., 2008) , and with goat kids in Europe (Geurden et al., 2008; Quílez et al., 2008; Drumo et al., 2012) . In Italy, very little is known about cryptosporidiosis in sheep, but the presence of C. parvum has been reported by sequence analysis of the oocyst wall protein gene in 26 isolates from Central Italy (Paoletti et al., 2009) . In a recent study that focused on the population structure of C. parvum in livestock (Drumo et al., 2012) , 21 isolates from lambs were genotyped at seven loci, including GP60. The GP60 subtypes IIaA15G2R1, IIaA16G3R1 and IIaA18G2R1 were identified, in agreement with the result obtained in other studies. In this work, a rare subtype, IIaA20G2R1, has been found associated with infection of lambs and with zoonotic transmission of cryptosporidiosis to a young child. The infection in lambs was particularly severe, with a mortality rate close to 80%, and the parasite was the only pathogen identified, as tests for both bacteria and viruses were negative. The analysis of fecal samples collected from lambs after the outbreak indicated that two genotypes, IIaA20G2R1 and IIaA15G2R1, were present in the farm. It should be noted that the IIaA20G2R1 subtype has been previously identified only in neonatal calves in Northern Ireland (Thompson et al., 2007) , but not in humans or in other animals. This findings, together with the timing in the onset of symptoms, i.e., first in animals and then in the child, strongly suggest that the child acquired the infection from oocysts shed by the infected lambs. However, transmission must have been indirect, as the children had no contact with the infected animals, and could have resulted from an accidental exposure to oocysts carried by his father on working clothes. Interestingly, the child was excreting oocysts even after the regression of symptoms, albeit in much lower number, but no transmission occurred among other family members. In summary, we described a case of zoonotic transmission of cryptosporidiosis to a young child in Italy, and demonstrated the involvement of a rare C. parvum genotype that was also associated with an outbreak in lambs.
