Influenza was detected in 61/143(43%) of the cases evaluated, however, changes in patient management, resultant from rapid influenza testing in the ED, involved 87/143(61%) (p = 0001) ( Table 3) . Changes in patient management were assessed relative to empiric management courses, established prior to influenza testing. Changes to patient management courses were 2.3 times more likely to occur among influenza negative cases compared to influenza positive cases, highlighting the importance of sensitive testing which can assure a high negative predictive value. Administration and discontinuation of both anti-viral and anti-microbials as a result of the influenza diagnosis were the most commonly documented change in management occurring in 58% (n = 83/143) (p = .001) of the cases which resulted in a decreased inappropriate/ unsupported antibiotic and anti-viral and prescribing by 24.5% and 9% respectively. Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing was defined as use of an antibiotic for a confirmed influenza infection. Conversely, inappropriate anti-viral (oseltamivir) prescribing was defines as use of an antiviral in the setting of a negative influenza diagnosis. Negative influenza results increased laboratory testing and additional medical procedures in 14% (n = 20) and 15% (n = 22) of the cases respectively. Changes to admission and discharge status occurred in 18% (26/143) of the cases accounting for 30% (26/87) of all documented changes in patient management. A total of 15/143 patient (10.5%) avoided an initially planned hospital admission when provided with the rapid influenza result. Conversely, 11/143 (7.7%) patients for whom an initial hospital admission was not planned were subsequently admitted because of a positive influenza test result. Whilst debates over the turn-around time needed to provide PCR testing for influenza in the ED exist, there is little debate regarding the intent of ED-based PCR testing. In order for testing to provide tangible benefits, results should be actionable where the key objective of testing should be to produce results quicker than could be routinely offered by contemporary or centralized testing or within the context of discrete patient visits. In consultation with ED staff, we defined a turn-around time for Liat ® testing at < 30 min. Among the total 292 cases tested, 91.7%, (268/292) received an influenza result in the ED within ≤30 min from the order entry. For 24 cases, a "rapid" result (≤30 min) could not be achieved. Among cases for which a < 30 min turn-around time could not be achieved the average turn-around time was 46-min (range 36-120-min). However, among these 24 cases, 45.8% (11/24) involved patient encounters in the ED stabilization room which require higher levels of care within the ED. These patients often have longer, more complicated ED management, thus it is understandable why many of the patients seen in ED stabilization rooms would experience delays in laboratory testing because testing becomes less of a priority compared to the resuscitation of the patient that occurs in ED stabilization rooms. Additional factors contributing to turn-around times > 30 min could not be determined for the remaining 13 cases.
