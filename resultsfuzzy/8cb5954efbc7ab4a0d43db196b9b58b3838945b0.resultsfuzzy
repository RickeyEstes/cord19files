The target dimeric amantadines 2a-e and rimantadines 4a-e were prepared in a two-step approach involving diamide formation with dicarboxylic acids HO 2 C-(CH 2 ) n -CO 2 H (n=2, 4, 6, 8, 10) and subsequent reduction using borane. In the amantadine series, the dicarboxylic acids were converted to the corresponding acid chlorides using oxalyl chloride. The crude acid chlorides (1.4 mmol) were reacted with an excess of amantadine (4 mmol) to give diamides 1a-e. The target compounds 2a-e were obtained in 50%-75% yield by reduction with borane-THF complex (Figure 1 ). Since rimantadine is commercially available only as a hydrochloride, an alternative and more convenient one-pot procedure for the amide formation was employed using
