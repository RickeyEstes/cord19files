It can be concluded from Table 1 , that, if one is infected with SARS and would live as a normal person, then the disease would infect a massive crowd of healthy people except for ≤ Z 13 and ≤ S 3. That warns us, at the initial stage of SARS, humankind should try their best to find SARS patients as early as possible and isolate them from healthy people. Nevertheless, during the incubation period, it is inevitable that some infected persons, who cannot be found and live as the normal person around us that is quite dangerous. At this time, the most effective way is to reduce outdoor activities of public then cut down the average contact number. For more accurate and meticulous disease-control strategies, we scrutinized the dynamic-dependent relationship between p p , c and the average number of infected cases with subtle parameters by a Monte-Carlo simulation. In the initial stage of the SARS process, from March 20 to April 8, according to the above analysis, = = = . Z S k 15, 4, 04, and = . p 0 149, based on these, the average number of infected cases of each day was simulated. See Fig. 5(a) for an illustration. It is clear that the random variation of the infected number has an incremental trend and that implies that the disease would infect a large amount of persons. Then from April 9 to April 19, during the second stage of SARS, some protective measures were taken with the understanding of the disease, so parameters changed to = = = . Z S k 13, 4, 04, and = . p 0 1425. By simulation, we found that the infected number changes chaotically as in Fig. 5(b) . With the time going by, from April 20 to May 4, the severity of the disease gradually being known, more protective measures were taken and parameters reduced further to = = = . Z S k 12, 3, 04, and = . p 0 1425. In this stage, the simulation revealed that the average infected number of each day fluctuates with a trend of decline and it would be zero after a period, which predicates the infectious disease can be controlled without any additional measures (Fig. 5(c) ). In fact, by simulating the percolation, we acquire = . (4, 11) 13 (4, 9) 12 (3, 9) 11 (3, 8) critical point, slightly adjusting of the system parameters would cause a fundamental change of the trend of infectious diseases. Therefore, in order control the large-scale outbreak of the disease, we must try our best to make < p p c , even if the infection probability is only a little smaller than the critical infection probability. Actually, if < p p c , the probability of a large outbreak of SARS is zero; and if p reaches and crosses p c , the probability picks up as a power law with exponent one in terms of p-p c , and the disease will outbreak rapidly. of all-finite clusters of infected cases, the χ SI p p ( ( ), ) exhibits negative value when p is greater than p c . By a numerical approach, the sensitivity of the probability of large-scalar outbreak of SARS ∞ SI P p p ( ( ), ) is displayed in Fig. 7 (c). ∞ SI P p p ( ( ), ) has similar characteristics as χ SI p p ( ( ), ). They are both more sensitive near the p c .
