3.1. CRISPR/dCas9-mediated biosensor as a molecular diagnostic tool Fig. 1A shows the design of CRISPR/dCas9-mediated biosensor that couples SMR-based isothermal nucleic acid amplification and dCas9 RNP. For simultaneous amplification and detection of nucleic acid, sequence specific primer of target was immobilized to the surface of the SMR biosensor and dCas9 RNP was in reaction chamber with single temperature for isothermal reaction with RPA. For DNA, a primer binds a recombinase enzyme to extend the DNA. For RNA, RT-RPA was used for the formation of complex of a primer and a recombinase enzyme to transcribe cDNA from RNA. The amplified nucleic acid targets were simultaneously detected by monitoring the wavelength shift. During the nucleic acid amplification process with dCas9 RNP on the SMR biosensor, the immobilized primer was hybridized with the target templates; dCas9 RNP, which allows sequence specific binding to the target nucleic acids (nearby the waveguide surface at immobilized forward primer, Supplementary Fig. S1 ), subsequently caused a dramatic increase as a signal enhancer in the proportion of each resonant wavelength. The SMR biosensors transduce the presence of target molecules based on binding-induced changes in the refractive index proximal to the waveguide surface. dCas9 binds to the amplified product on the surface of the sensor and increases the molecular weight of the sensor surface, thereby increasing the detection sensitivity by increasing the refractive index change. Therefore, the CRISPR/dCas9-mediated biosensor detected the pathogenic nucleic acids with high sensitivity within 20 min compared to the SMR alone (Fig. 1A) .
