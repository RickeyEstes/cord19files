Liquid array detection showed that the MFI for RVFV, SBV, EBV, WNV and BTV was relatively higher (mainly > 4000) when the ratio of forward/reverse primers was 1:2, 1:3 or 1:4. The MFI for EHDV, VSV and CB was the highest when the ratio of forward/reverse primers was 1:2, whereas the MFI for BB and ASFV was relatively stable regardless of the forward/reverse primer ratio (Fig. 1a) . As a result, 1:2 was used as the optimized ratio of forward/reverse primers. The MFI for BTV, EHDV, VSV, EBV and SBV PCR product was highest when the volume of PCR product was 2 μl, then gradually decreased with increasing volume of PCR product (> 2 μl). Similarly, the MFI for WNV, BB, ASFV, CB and RVFV PCR product was also highest when the volume of PCR product was 2 μl, but showed no obvious decrease with increasing volume of PCR product (> 2 μl) (Fig. 1b) . Therefore, 2 μl of PCR product was selected as the optimized quantity for the asymmetric PCR. The MFI for BTV PCR product was higher at 50°C and 56°C. The MFI for BB and EBV PCR product was highest at 58°C, and for the other seven pathogens was highest at 50°C (Fig. 1c) . Therefore, 50°C was selected as the optimized Tm for the hybridization. The MFI for BB and EHDV PCR product was higher when the hybridization duration was 30 min or 35 min, whereas the MFI for the other eight pathogens was highest when the hybridization duration was 30 min (Fig. 1d) . Therefore, 30 min was chosen as the optimal hybridization duration. Above all, an optimized liquid array detection system was described as below. The asymmetric PCR system was set up as follows: 23 μl buffer mix, 0.5 μl forward primers, 1 μl reverse primers, 5 μl nucleic acid templates, and double-distilled H 2 O up to 50 μl. The thermal cycle conditions were as follows: 1 cycle at 50°C for 30 min and 95°C for 15 min, followed by 35 cycles at 95 °C for 40 s, 54°C for 40 s and 72°C for 1 min, with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The hybridization system was set up as follows: 33 μl of diluted bead suspension (1 μl of probe-coupled bead suspension added into 330 μl 1× TMAC hybridization solution), 15 μl Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0), and 2 μl PCR products. The hybridization reaction was performed as follows: denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, and hybridization at 50°C for 30 min. After hybridization, PCR products were transferred into a 96-well ELISA plate. Beads were re-suspended in 100 μl of SAPE diluted in 1× TMAC hybridization solution (3:1000), and incubated in a metal bath at 58°C for 10 min. Then the reaction systems were analyzed using a liquid array detection system. Among 3000 clinical samples, 16 tick samples from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region and Heilongjiang Province were detected to be positive for BB using the optimized liquid array detection system, showed as 2.81% (16/570) infection rate, which was consistent with the results of the detection kit. Furthermore, 53 midge samples from Yunnan Province and Guangdong Province were detected to be positive for BTV, showed as 12.62% (53/ 420) infection rate, which was also consistent with the results of the detection kit. In addition, 17 tick samples from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region were positive for CB, showed as 3.62% (17/470) infection rate. Co-infection with BB and CB was found in 5 ticks. All of these samples were reanalyzed using the corresponding gold-standard assays or commercial nucleic acid detection kits, and all of the results were consistent with the findings of the liquid array detection system (Table 3 ).
