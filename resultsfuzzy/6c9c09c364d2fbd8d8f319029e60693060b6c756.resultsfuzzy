The systemic immune system may contribute to local protection in the genital mucosa with antibodies transudating from serum into vaginal secretions [25] [26] [27] [28] . Since the inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM vaccine induced high serum titers of antigen-specific IgG and high VN titers, the same parameters were measured in vaginal washes collected from vaccinated goats. After administration of the first vaccine dose (i.e., samples collected on day 10), none of the goats vaccinated with CpHV-1 only exhibited detectable CpHV-1-specific vaginal IgG (,log 2 1; Fig. 1C ) while animals vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM exhibited low titers of vaginal IgG (log 2 160.5) which were an average 2-fold higher than those of naïve goats (,log 2 1; Fig. 1C ). Administration of the second vaccine dose (i.e., samples collected on day 20) resulted in significantly elevated titers of CpHV-1specific vaginal IgG (log 2 461) in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM and these antibody titers were an average 16-fold higher than those of naïve goats (Fig. 1C) . On day 20 post immunization, CpHV-1-specific vaginal IgG remained undetectable in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only. It should be noted that the levels of vaginal IgG in the three groups of goats were different despite the presence of similar levels of albumin in vaginal samples (data not shown) suggesting that vaginal IgG in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM reflected the higher levels of serum IgG in this group of animals rather than resulting from an augmented mucosal permeability. The level of VN activity in vaginal washes from all vaccinated goats was undetectable even after the second immunization (i.e., day 20) and this was likely due to the dilution of vaginal antibodies during the collection of the sample [29] . No CpHV-1-specific vaginal IgA were detected in any animal in response to the vaccines at any time (data not shown). Production of IFN-gamma by antigen-specific PBMC from goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM The profile of IFN-gamma and IL-4 secretion by PBMC isolated from vaccinated goats (following the second immunization i.e., on day 20) was studied in culture supernatants after CpHV-1 stimulation. As shown in Fig. 3A , PBMC isolated from goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only and from naïve goats did not produce detectable levels of IFN-gamma upon antigenstimulation in vitro. Goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM exhibited significant levels of soluble IFN-gamma (3436101 pg/ml) in response to in vitro antigen stimulation and these levels were approximately 150-fold higher than those of either naïve goats or goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only (,5 pg/ml). In the same cultures, IL-4 was always undetectable in response to CpHV-1 stimulation (data not shown). Mitogen-stimulated PBMC cultures from all vaccinated goats and from naïve goats, secreted similar amounts of both IFN-gamma and IL-4 (data not shown) indicating that the ability to produce IFN-gamma or IL-4 was intact and comparable in all goats. The frequencies of CpHV-1-specific IFN-gamma producing cells were measured by ELISPOT (Fig. 3B) and PBMC from goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM developed significantly more IFN-gamma producing cells (105618/10 6 PBMC) relative either to naïve goats or to goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only (,1 IFN-gamma SFC/10 6 PBMC).
