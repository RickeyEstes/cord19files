Initial measurements did not differ in phase 1 of trial 1 (Table 2) . Preweaning ADG (0.47 vs. 0.55 kg/d) and BCS change were greater (P < 0.03) for TIL than CON (Table 2) . Postweaning starter intake (0.33 vs. 0.44 kg/d) and hip width change (1.7 vs. 2.0 cm) were greater (P < 0.05) for TIL than CON. Overall starter intake, ADG (0.57 vs. 0.65 kg/d), hip width change (4.0 vs. 4.5 cm), final hip width, and final BCS were greater (P < 0.04) for TIL than CON. Number of medical treatments did not differ between treatments. For CON, there were 5 calves treated for navel infections and 3 calves treated for nasal discharges, and these 3 calves were re-treated a day later for fever during the preweaning period. During the postweaning period there was an additional calf treated for nasal discharge. For TIL, there were 4 calves treated for navel infections and 2 calves treated for nasal discharge. One of the calves treated for nasal discharge was treated a day later for fever. All navel infections were identified and treatments began on d 0. No abnormal breathing sounds were detected using the stethoscope on d 28, 42, and 56. Abnormal fecal score did not differ between treatments. All feces from calves with abnormal feces tested positive for Cryptosporidium, Rotavirus, or both organisms. Dur-ing phase 2 of trial 1, calf ADG (0.86 vs. 0.99 kg/d), hip width change (4.1 vs. 4.6 cm), final hip width, and final BCS were greater (P < 0.05) for TIL than CON (Table 3) . During phase 1, the overall increase in BW and hip width gain from treating with TIL was 12 to 13% greater compared with CON. During phase 2, the overall increase in BW and hip width gain from treating with TIL was 12 to 15% greater compared with CON. Over the 112 d of both phases, TIL calves gained 11.8 kg (14%) more BW (80.0 vs. 91.8 kg) and gained 1.0 cm (13%) more hip width (9.1 vs. 8.1 cm) than CON calves. In trial 2, initial measurements did not differ (Table 3) . No calves were treated for any sickness during the trial. Calf ADG (0.84 vs. 0.95 kg/d), feed efficiency (0.29 vs. 0.32 G:F), and hip width change (4.1 vs. 4.8 cm) were greater (P < 0.04) for calves treated with TIL than CON (Table 3) . Over the 56-d trial, TIL calves gained 6.2 kg more BW and 0.7 cm more hip width than CON calves. Viruses allow for bacterial colonization of the lungs and are a typical reason for the onset of respiratory disease in beef calves (Yates, 1982) . Stressors are a trigger of disease in calves through their effect on cortisol and various cytokines (Hulbert and Moisá, 2016) . Stressors can be present the majority of days during the first 2 mo of a dairy calf's life (Hulbert and Moisá, 2016) . Calves in the current trial faced many stressors including a 3.5-h transport from their birth farm to the research facility, several vaccinations, castrating, dehorning, weaning, and commingling. We expected to treat more calves for respiratory disease than we did based on treatment rates of groups of calves in our research facility over the prior year. We speculate that there was some level of respiratory disease in the calves that we did not identify and treat. Use of TIL may have reduced the incidence of subclinical respiratory disease and allowed for increased growth. Calves in the current trials appeared relatively healthy based on the few illnesses that were identified. In trial 1, phase 1, 6 of 48 calves were treated for some type of nasal discharge or fever that appeared to be related to respiratory infection. Navel infections in 9 calves on d 0 were evenly distributed between CON and TIL calves. Six of the 9 calves with navel infections did not have iodinestained hair around their navels, whereas calves without navel infections showed staining; thus, source-farm personnel may have not properly dipped their navels with iodine solution at birth. No calves were treated for any sickness during phase 2 of trial 1. Amrine et al. (2014) reported that the ADG of feeder calves (178 ± 19.7 kg of BW) after a Mannheimia haemolytica challenge were increased in calves treated with both TIL and TUL compared with non-antibiotic-treated calves. Bartram et al. (2016) reported that the ADG of 10to 28-d-old dairy calves after a Mycoplasma bovis challenge were increased when treated with both TIL and TUL compared with non-antibiotic-treated calves. In these studies, many of the calves were sick with disease caused by the challenge organism. Stanton et al. (2010) and Hill et al. (2017) reported improvements in calf growth with metaphylactic treatment of relatively healthy calves with TUL. Stanton et al. (2010 Stanton et al. ( , 2012 Stanton et al. ( , 2013 also reported that metaphylactic use of TUL in commingled dairy calves lowered the incidence of diarrhea, otitis media, and bovine respiratory disease complex compared with either metaphylactic treatment with oxytetracycline or no antibiotic treatment; however, growth was not changed with the use of TUL in calves that were sick. They attributed improvements in growth to reduction of disease in the calves. In our trials, calves treated with TIL gained approximately 13% more BW and hip width than CON from 3 d to 4 mo of age. With a similar design and relatively healthy dairy calves, treatment with TUL increased BW and hip width gain approximately 8% compared with Table 2 . Performance of calves from 0 to 56 d that had not been treated (CON) or had been treated (TIL) with Zuprevo 1 (4 mg of tildipirosin/kg of BW) near birth and weaning (42 d apart) in trial 1, phase 2 (1982) . 3 Feed efficiency was calculated as gain divided by the sum of milk replacer and starter intake. 4 Feces were scored daily using a 1-to-5 scale with 1 being normal and 5 being watery. 5 Days with fecal scores of 3 or greater. CON from 3 d to 4 mo of age (Hill et al., 2017) . In the trials by Stanton et al. (2010 Stanton et al. ( , 2013 , healthy calves experienced improved BW and structural growth in the first 3 mo of age when metaphylactically administered TUL. Growth experienced in the first 3 mo of life appeared to be maintained to approximately 1 yr of age in the study by Stanton et al. (2012) . Because our calves appeared healthy and the medical treatments of CON calves were so low, number of medical treatments for disease were not affected by TIL, but improvements in BW and structural growth were realized.
