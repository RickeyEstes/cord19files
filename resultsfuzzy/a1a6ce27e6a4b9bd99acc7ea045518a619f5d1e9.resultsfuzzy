One of the main pitfalls of the use of molecular methods in food safety is that they do not discern between infectious and noninfectious viruses. The proportion of inactivated viruses in food and water samples may vary depending on how long these viruses have persisted in the environment and/or in the samples. On the other hand, since viral nucleic acids (intact or fragmented) may stand some of the inactivation treatments applied in the food industry, the lack of correlation between genome copies and infectious titers also hampers the assessment of the efficacy of inactivation procedures (extensively reviewed by Ceupens et al., [56 ] ). Improper interpretation of molecular data can easily lead to wrong decisionmaking in the food industry and misconceptions of the associated public health risk. During the last decade, adaptations to the conventional RTqPCR protocols (also denominated 'viability PCR' assays) have been developed to reduce and minimize the detection of non-infectious viruses and free nucleic acids (detailed reviews have been published elsewhere [57, 58 ] ). However, validation of these 'viability PCR assays' depends on the use of cell-adapted viral strains, when available, or virus surrogates since none of main foodborne virus threats may be detected by infectivity assays. Briefly, molecular approaches for predicting virus infectivity examine two major virus characteristics: integrity of the virus genome, and capsid structural stability. Viability dyes such as ethidium monoazide (EMA) or propidium monoazide (PMA) in combination with RTqPCR have been employed to examine capsid integrity and the validity of the approach depends on the target virus and the applied disinfection procedures [59, 60 ] . Factors such as the degree of secondary structure present within the target RTqPCR region, its level of interaction and protection by capsid proteins, the mechanical stability or plasticity of the viral capsid, or the level of viral aggregation within the sample, may cause bias in the application of EMA/PMA-RTqPCR methods. Finally, some of the most promising alternative approaches, developed for NoV, are based on integrated in situ capture assays,
