Our collaboration has produced a better understanding of the social, cultural, environmental, occupational and economic processes that determine the health of health workers locally [17, 18, 20, 21, [32] [33] [34] and globally [4, 25, 26, 35] . Our conceptual framework has been since used by other research groups [36] ; our findings were used by hospital decision-makers and government planners; and these research findings were taken into account by our own team in the development of the tools described above. As noted above, the research we conducted first confirmed that providing health workers with training to properly protect themselves from infectious diseases is significantly associated with better perception of a positive safety climate. After we created training tools to address the organizational, environmental and individual factors we identified as important determinants of infection control compliance, we conducted further research followingup on the use of these online tools. We then found that providing time to take the course on work time was significantly associated with higher intention to comply with safety precautions compared to promoting the course on a voluntary basis (logistic regression model showed a statistically significant difference between supervisor-required and voluntary groups with respect to perceived importance of infection control in the workplace, the extent to which the facility ensures patient safety, and the extent to which the facility ensures staff safety) [19] . This led to the course becoming mandatory in British Columbia [22] . Building on the findings of our research in Canada, initial work in Ecuador, and our pilot study in South Africa (for example, poor staff knowledge on recapping of needles as well as the finding that more than half the respondents felt that they were not given guidance as to how to perform their jobs safely [26] ), we collaborated with government officials in Ecuador, South Africa and the Caribbean to develop guidelines, policies and programmes. We also worked with international agencies to develop new policy guidelines [15] . Acting on our own research findings, we created further training materials, addressing not only basic infection control and how to don and doff personal protective equipment, but how to establish health and safety committees, inspect workplaces, investigate incidents, and establish policies and health and safety programs based on solid evidence. Our work has squarely addressed North-South power relations and the digital divide, always building on local capabilities to transfer knowledge South-South, North-South and vice versa in a respectful manner that benefits both Northern as well as Southern partners [37] . The products developed have been widely heralded as innovative and important components of "toolkits" used internationally. The tools now used in Canada have, in turn, been improved from the collaborative adaptation process for South and Central America and South Africa. Thus this research has resulted in health service approaches, products and policies that are being embraced nationally (e.g. in Ecuador, Trinidad-Tobago and South Africa) and internationally (e.g. through international organizations including PAHO) as well as having Canadian impact [19, 21, 22] . The guidelines, research and needs assessment instruments, web-based health information system, and on-line learning modules will continue to have widespread impact well into the future. More importantly, by elucidating the links between worker health and the health of patients, we have begun to show that attending to the health of the healthcare workforce is not only the right thing to do to protect this vulnerable population, but also produces safer healthcare for all. This case thus illustrates the benefits of infection control and occupational health researchers working together and also how Canadians and Southern partners alike benefit from international collaboration.
