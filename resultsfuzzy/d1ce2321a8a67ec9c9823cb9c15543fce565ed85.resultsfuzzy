Despite an absence of changes in fecal consistency score or wet weight, experimental aEPEC carriage in Group A kittens was associated with a significant decrease in intestinal absorption of D-xylose and a significant decrease in intestinal permeability to iohexol ( Fig. 5A and  5B) . Importantly, direct culture of aEPEC with D-xylose (5 mg/ml) for 2 h in vitro did not result in a decrease in D-xylose concentration (post- Fig. 2 . Designation, serotype, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pulsotype, and results of PCR for virulence gene content of the three isolates of kitten aEPEC used for experimental infection (5-1, 53-1, and 33-2) and two isolates of aEPEC carried by kittens at the time of purchase from a commercial vendor (K5-1 and K15-1). Fig. 3 . Carriage of aEPEC in kittens following experimental infection. Quantification of aEPEC was performed using qPCR to amplify eae from fecal DNA. Results for eae were applied to a standard curve relating Ct to CFU of aEPEC to estimate infection load in each kitten at each time point (Watson et al., 2017) . Panel A data represent kittens in Group A that did not receive treatment with antibiotics prior to experimental infection. Note on day 0 of infection, six kittens were identified as harboring a vendor-origin aEPEC. Panel B data represent kittens in Group B that received pre-treatment with antibiotics prior to experimental infection. Black circles = kittens that received probiotic; white circles = kittens that received vehicle only. V.E. Watson, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 231 (2019) 197-206 aEPEC incubation D-xylose, 4.7 and 4.8 mg/ml) and serum glucose concentration had no significant impact on D-xylose assay results ( Supplementary Fig. 2) .
