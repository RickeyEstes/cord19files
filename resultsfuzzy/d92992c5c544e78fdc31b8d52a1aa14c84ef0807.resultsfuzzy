The basic characteristics and major results of 220 pediatric patients are summarized in Table 1 . The positive rate of the Seeplex TM RV detection kit was 52.7% (116 positive samples/total 220 samples). Seeplex TM identified 136 viruses which were the sum of AdV (n = 14, 10.3%), HCoV 229E/NL63 (n = 5, 3.7%), HCoV OC43/HKU1 (n = 4, 2.9%), IFV A (n = 8, 5.9%), IFV B (n = 9, 6.6%), HMPV (n = 2, 1.5%), PIFV 1 (n = 0, 0%), PIFV 2 (n = 0, 0%), PIFV 3 (n = 4, 2.9%), RhV A/B (n = 18, 13.2%), RSV A (n = 39, 28.7%), and RSV B (n = 33, 24.3%). The Labopass TM RV detection kit showed 46.4% positivity (102 positive samples/total 220 samples). The Labopass TM RV detection kit identified 116 viruses which were the sum of AdV (n = 14, 12.1%), HBoV (n = 4, 3.4%), HCoV NL63 (n = 1, 0.9%), HCoV OC43 (n = 2, 1.7%), EV (n = 0, 0%), IFV A (n = 2, 1.7%), IFV B (n = 2, 1.7%), HMPV (n = 22, 19.0%), PIFV 1 (n = 2, 1.7%), PIFV 2 (n = 0, 0%), PIFV 3 (n = 1, 0.9%), RhV A/B (n = 6, 5.2%), and RSV (n = 60, 51.7%). The coinfection (more than 2 virus species identified) rate of the Seeplex TM RV kit was 6.8% (15/220) and of the Labopass TM RV kit was 5.9% (13/220).
