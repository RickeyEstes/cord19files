In this work, we focus mainly on the explanation of the singlemolecule experimental data of Chen et al. [29] . Thus, we focus our studies on the wild-type (WT) dnaX À 1 frameshift mRNA and some mutant mRNAs used in the experiments, which contain both the internal SD sequence and hairpin, as shown in Fig. 5a . We also present predicted results with the mRNA in the absence of both SD sequence and hairpin, as shown in Fig. 5b . ) of the 50S E and P sites to the two tRNAs. The transition to State LP requires overcoming four free energy changes including the free energy change ( E 2 bp ) of unwinding two mRNA base pairs, the free energy change ( ΔE codon ) of shifting the peptidyl-tRNA anticodon from pairing with codon XXY to pairing with codon XXX and breaking the interaction between deacylated tRNA anticodon and codon BCX, the free energy change (ΔtRNA) of bending the P-site peptidyl-tRNA in State LP, and the free energy change (Δ ( ) E SD 2 ) of the SD-antiSD interaction which is induced by the movement of the ribosome from the position with d¼ 0 where the SD and antiSD have the largest interacting energy to the position with d ¼ 2p where the SD and antiSD have a smaller interacting energy, with Δ ( ) The transition to State LP implies the occurrence of the long-paused rotated state. Thus, the occurrence probability of State LP caused by one reverse intersubunit rotation is calculated by is the thermal energy. Correspondingly, the occurrence probability of State POST, i.e., an effective translocation, caused by one reverse intersubunit rotation is calculated by With Eqs. (1) and (2) the occurrence probability of the long-paused rotated state during the translation is calculated by 1 , which is rewritten as as defined in Eq. (1). Then, the occurrence probability of the normal translation at the slippery site (i.e., at codon AAA 24 ) is calculated by Eq. (3) shows clearly that the occurrence probability of the long-paused rotated state is determined by the SD-antiSD interaction (characterized by ΔΔE SD ) and the stability of the base pair of the downstream hairpin (characterized by E bp ), as well as the codons at the slippery site (characterized by ΔE codon ) and the bending of the P-site peptidyl-tRNA (characterized by ΔtRNA), while is independent of other factors such as the concentrations of EF-G.GTP and the ternary complex, which is consistent with the experimental data [29] . The single-molecule experimental data [29] showed that at the slippery site (i.e., at codon AAA 24 ) of the WT mRNA, where both the SD-antiSD interaction and the downstream hairpin are present, the occurrence probability of the long-paused rotated state is 75%; for the mutant mRNA without the internal SD sequence, which corresponds to ΔΔE SD ¼0 in Eq. (3), the occurrence probability of the long-paused rotated state is 38%; and for the mutant mRNA without the downstream hairpin, which corresponds to E bp ¼ 0 in Eq. (3), the occurrence probability of the long-paused rotated state is 20%. With Eq. (3), by adjusting ΔE ¼ 3k B T, ΔΔE SD ¼ 1.6k B T and E bp ¼2.5k B T we obtain P LP ¼0.75 for the WT mRNA. Then, with ΔE ¼3k B T, ΔΔE SD ¼0 and E bp ¼2.5k B T we obtain P LP ¼ 0.38 for the mutant mRNA without the internal SD sequence; and with ΔE ¼ 3k B T, ΔΔE SD ¼ 1.6k B T and E bp ¼0 we obtain P LP ¼0.2 for the mutant mRNA without the downstream hairpin. The fitted value of E bp ¼2.5k B T implies that the free energy change of unwinding one mRNA base pair is about 1.5 kcal/mol, which is close to the value estimated in the literature [65] . From Eq. (3) it is clearly seen that the occurrence probability of the long-paused rotated state or the frequency of frameshifting increases with the increase of E bp , implying that increasing mRNA structure stability increases the frequency of frameshifting. Moreover, Eq. (3) shows that for the system with no SD sequence involvement, i.e., with ΔΔE SD ¼ 0, the efficiency P LP is smaller than that with ΔΔE SD 4 0, explaining the experimental data showing that the frameshifting efficiency related to the system where only the IBV pseudoknot is present but no SD sequence is involved [24] is smaller than that for the system where both the stem loop and SD sequence are involved [29] .
