Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are single nucleotide changes in a particular animal that can result in production of a different amino acid in a protein. Although this is a very slight change, a single amino acid change may greatly change the function of an innate immune factor. As indicated, studies in pigs have demonstrated that SNPs in mannan-binding lectin C are associated with increased susceptibility to respiratory disease. Humans with SNPs in surfactant protein A and D have increased incidence and severity of respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia. Identifying an association Innate Immunology of Bovine Respiratory Disease between SNPs and increased respiratory disease often requires large-scale genetic studies matched to clinical disease scores and thus are often expensive. However, SNPs within a cattle herd that has minimal genetic variation could have profound effects.
