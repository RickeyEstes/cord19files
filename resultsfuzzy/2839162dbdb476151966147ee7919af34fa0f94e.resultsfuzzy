As mentioned above, a 9-day-old infant with icterus neonatorum, a condition that is self-healing in the majority of cases, died following Yinzhihuang herbal injection. Another herbal injection, Yinxingdamo, is produced from extracts of Ginkgo biloba leaves plus the drug dipyridamole and recommended for prevention or treatment of coronary heart diseases and thromboembolic disease. However, Yinxingdamo herbal injection was given to a 32-year-old woman with an URTI and resulted in anaphylactic shock (Li and Weng, 2008) . Likewise, a 26-year-old Iranian woman visiting China and a pregnant woman at 29 weeks gestation, both with URTIs, suffered from anaphylactic shock in response to YHI treatments (Chen et al., 2006; Zhang and Wang, 2004) . Currently there are no precise statistics describing clinical adverse effects caused by misuse of herbal injections. But Chinese hospitals are increasingly becoming more cautious in the application of herbal injections (Yang et al., 2007) . For example, some hospitals have forbidden the use of YHIs in patients with only a common cold or URTI. (Yang et al., 2007) . In TCM, Chinese herbal injections are often claimed to be effective in curing a wide variety of symptoms and diseases without any distinctions of age, gender, or inter-individual variations. Moreover, the veracity of the broad applications has not been demon-strated scientifically. For example, we are unaware of any definitive clinical safety data for Qingkailing injection in the treatment of URTIs in children. Hence, we strongly suggest that Chinese herbal injections should be approved by the SFDA according to the results of double-blind randomized controlled clinical trials. More accurate instructions can be formulated according to the clinical results to avoid misusage and avert potential future tragedies.
