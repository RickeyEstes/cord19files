Serine 185 is positively selected for in multiple bat species 94 We conducted computational and functional analyses of bat IRF3 across both suborders of bats, 95 Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera. Sequence alignment of representative mammalian 96 IRF3 sequences showed that serine (S) residues in the C-terminal serine-rich region are highly 97 conserved ( Figure 1 ). On performing further in silico analysis of IRF3 amino acid sequences, we 98 identified that the amino acid residue at the 185 th position was positively selected for in multiple 99 bat IRF3 sequences (Figure 1 ). Since serine residues play a major role in IRF3 activation (Panne 100 et al., 2007) , we next studied the functional importance of the serine residue at the 185 th position 101 (S185) in 7 out of 11 bat IRF3 sequences. 102 103 IRF3-S185 induces a robust antiviral response in bat cells from two suborders 104 To determine whether IRF3 is more competent in inducing robust antiviral protection due to the 105 presence of S185, we compared the differences in antiviral response to surrogate virus infection 106 [poly(I:C) stimulation] in bat and human cells expressing bat (S185) or human (L185) forms of 107 IRF3, respectively. We generated E. fuscus and P. alecto wildtype (Ef IRF3-WT and Pa IRF3-108 WT) and altered (Ef IRF3-L185 and Pa IRF3-L185) IRF3 expression plasmids. We also 109 generated wildtype (hu IRF3-WT) and altered (hu IRF3-S185) human IRF3 expression plasmids 110 to determine if introducing S185 would enhance antiviral protection in human cells. To quantify 111 the antiviral response in cells expressing wildtype or altered forms of IRF3, we performed 112 bioassays using vesicular stomatitis virus that was genetically engineered to express green To determine whether Ef IRF3-WT (S185) and Ef IRF3-L185 differed in their potential to 123 activate antiviral signaling in E. fuscus IRF3 deleted cr3-8 cells, we introduced increasing 124 amounts of IRF3 expression plasmids in these cells ( Figure 2B) . We compared the extent of To determine if S185 in IRF3 was equally important for antiviral responses in a distantly related 133 fruit bat, P. alecto (Figure 1 ), we expressed P. alecto WT (Pa IRF3-WT; S185) and altered (Pa 134 IRF3-L185) IRF3 in IRF3 deleted PakiT03-4G cells. Similar to what we observed in cr3-8 cells, 135 expressing Pa IRF3-L185 in PakiT03-4G cells significantly reduced antiviral protection in these 136 cells, relative to cells that expressed Pa IRF3-WT ( Figure 2C ). Thus, the presence of S185 in E. 137 fuscus and P. alecto IRF3 is critical for a robust antiviral response in cells from these bats. 138 139
