In view of the commercial availability of the nitro-or the acetamido-substituted benzenesulfonyl chlorides 2, we decided to prepare the nitro and the acetamido precursors 5, 6, and 7 (Scheme 1, R = NO 2 or NHAc), and then to transform them into the corresponding amino derivatives by reduction or hydrolysis, respectively. The key substrates for the synthesis of 5, 6, and 7, that is, the corresponding N-(pivaloyloxymethyl)sulfonamides 4, were obtained from the reaction of 2-pivaloyloxyethylamine hydrochloride 1 with benzenesulfonyl chlorides 2 followed by the alkylation of 3 with chloromethyl pivalate (Scheme 1). N-(Pivaloyloxymethyl)sul- fonamides 4 were transformed into 5, 6, or 7 by the one-pot base silylation/nucleoside coupling methodology (Scheme 1). 11 Derivatives 4 reacted with the silylated thymine, uracil or 5-fluorouracil in the presence of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf) to give the corresponding azanucleosides 5, 6, and 7 in 54-89% yields. The only exception was the coupling of the acetamido derivative 4d with 5-fluorouracil; instead of the desired 7d, 4acetamido-N-(2-pivaloyloxyethyl)-N-(acetamidomethyl)benzenesulfonamide 12 (not shown) was formed as the only product under these conditions. This compound resulted from the reaction of 4d with N-monosilylated or free acetamide, which are formed during silylation of the nucleobase with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (BSA). 13 Replacement of TMSOTf with tin(IV) chloride let us to prepare 7d in 52% yield. The 1 H-13 C HMBC correlations observed for 5a, and the 1 H-1 H ROESY correlations for 5b or 5d confirmed the N-1 substitution pattern of azanucleosides 5-7 (Fig. 2) . Nucleoside analogs with the nitro group in a sugar moiety 14 (mostly derivatives of uracil 14a-e ) have been reduced to the corresponding amino derivatives by the heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation (in the presence of Raney-Nickel, 14a-c palladium on charcoal, 14f,14g or platinum(IV) oxide 14h ), or with the following reducing agents: sodium dithionite, 4b tin in acetic acid, 14d or sodium borohydride (in the presence of nickel(II) chloride 14e or palladium on charcoal 14g ). 15 The number of reports on the reduction of the 5-fluorouracil nitro nucleosides is limited. They have been reduced by heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of palladium on charcoal, or with sodium borohydride/palladium on charcoal mixture; unfortunately yields of the reaction products have not been given. 14g Considering the presence of the 4-nitrobenzenesulfonamido function in a molecule, the reduction conditions of 5 0 -deoxy-5 0 -(4-nitrobenzenesulfonamido)thymidine (i.e., sodium dithionite in alkaline medium) has attracted our considerable attention. 4b To the best of our knowledge, this reducing agent has not been employed for the reduction of nucleoside nitro analogs being derivatives of uracil or 5-fluorouracil so far. Therefore, we decided to examine this method for the transformation of the nitro derivatives 5, 6, and 7 into the amino azanucleosides B. Initially, the reduction of the thymine derivatives 5a-c was examined (Scheme 2). Taking into account the NO 2 -isomerism of 5a-c, the reaction was found to be not general. The reduction of 5a (4-NO 2 ) or 5b (3-NO 2 ) with sodium dithionite in alkaline solution at 90°C was accompanied by hydrolysis of the ester group to give the hydroxy derivatives 8a (59%) or 8b (52%), respectively (Scheme 2, conditions (i). Reduction of the 2-NO 2 isomer 5c under the same conditions afforded a complex mixture, from which the amino derivative 8c was isolated in 5% yield. Modification of the literature procedure by the use of aqueous sodium dithionite at 90°C resulted in the formation of all isomers 9a-c as pivaloyl esters in yields exceeding 50% (Scheme 2, conditions (ii). The 2-NH 2 isomer 9c was treated with ammonium hydroxide at 70°C to obtain 8c in 79% yield (Scheme 2, conditions (iii)). Taking into account a kind of nucleobase present in the nitro compounds tested, the dithionite reduction was not general as well. In contrast to the thymine derivatives 5a-c, treating of the nitro derivatives of uracil or 5-fluorouracil, that is, 6a or 7a, respectively, with sodium dithionite in alkaline medium or in aqueous solution did not afford the corresponding amino azanucleosides at all. Although the heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation is one of the most often used methods for the reduction of nucleoside nitro analogs, the palladium-catalysed hydrogenation (H 2 , 10% Pd/C, ambient pressure) of 6a-c or 7a-c did not give the expected results; multi-component mixtures (by TLC) were produced. Therefore, we applied the palladium-catalysed transfer hydrogenation 16 to achieve the amino analogs 10 and 11 (Schemes 3 and 4). Treating of the uracil derivatives 6a-c with cyclohexene/10% Pd/C mixture in ethanol at 60°C gave the corresponding amino derivatives 10a-c in 58-89% yields (Scheme 3).  Scheme 4. Reagents and conditions: cyclohexene, 10% Pd/C, 60°C, 1 day: The reduction of the 5-fluorouracil derivatives 7 by the palladium-catalysed transfer hydrogenation was more complex and its outcome depended on the solvent used (Scheme 4). The reduction of 7a in ethanol provided an inseparable mixture of the expected amino derivative 11a and the uracil derivative 10a in a 3:2 ratio 17 (Scheme 4, conditions (i)); 10a was a product of hydrogenolysis of the carbon-fluorine bond. 18 The formation of 10a was not observed when the reaction was carried out in methanol at 60°C (Scheme 4, conditions (ii)), but 11a was the minor product (yield 9%); the N-methyl derivative 12 (45%) and the N,N-dimethyl one 13 (15%) were also obtained. We assume that 12 and 13 were formed from the reductive methylation of 11a or 12 with formaldehyde, respectively, which was produced from the catalytic dehydrogenation of methanol. 16a All difficulties with the reduction of 7 were solved when 1,4-dioxane was used as the reaction medium (Scheme 4, conditions (iii)); all isomers 11a-c were prepared in the yields of 57-64%. An alternative approach toward azanucleosides B consisted in ammonolysis or an alkaline hydrolysis of the 4-acetamido derivatives (Scheme 5). Ammonolysis of 5d or 6d with ammonium hydroxide at 70°C resulted in the selective cleavage of the pivaloyl ester; azanucleosides 14a or 14b were obtained in 94% or 85% yield, respectively. Both the O-and N-protecting groups were removed when the thymine derivative 5d was treated with aqueous sodium hydroxide at 90°C to provide 8a in 39% yield. The latter conversion was much less effective than the previously performed reduction of the nitro derivative 5a with sodium dithionite under alkaline conditions (Scheme 2).
