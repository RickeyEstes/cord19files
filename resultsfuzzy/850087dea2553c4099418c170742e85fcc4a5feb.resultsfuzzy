All inoculated and contact pigs became infected. For IAV all inoculated pigs, and contact controls became positive by 3 and 7 DPI (Ct values 24.6 ± 2.21 and 21.1 ± 2.79) respectively. For PRRSV all inoculated pigs and 1 of the 2 contact pigs were viremic at 7 DPI, and all pigs remained positive until 20 DPI. Animals had an average body temperature of 39.3 ±0.6°C (mean ± standard deviation) and, an average lethargy and respiratory score of 1.98 ± 0.98 and 3.5% ± 0.05% respectively across the entire study. For the first 4 days after infection with IAV and PRRSV, animals had the maximum lethargy and respiratory scores of 4 and 16.7%, respectively (Fig 1) . Animals recovered from any respiratory clinical signs by 16 DPI. Lethargy scores ranged between 0 and 1 for the remainder of the study, except for the day after PEDV infection that increased to 2.5. All pigs had diarrhea 48h after PEDV inoculation. The mean indoor temperature (mean ± standard deviation) was 23.2°C±0.7°C with a mean relative humidity of 32.6% ±7.4% and a mean air pressure of -27.4 Pa ± 0.15Pa relative to the hallway pressure.
