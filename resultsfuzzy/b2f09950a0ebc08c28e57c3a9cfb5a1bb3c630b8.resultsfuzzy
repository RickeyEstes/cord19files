Enteric challenges continue to be one of the main health issues facing dairy calf production today. As expected with the objective of the analysis, the likelihood of occurrence of elevated fecal score (fecal score >2 for ≥3 d; Araujo et al., 2015) was greater for calves classified as DIA during the first 21 d of the experiment. The DIA calves were 5.86 [odds ratio (OR)] times more likely to have an elevated fecal score than HEA calves (P < 0.001; Table 2 ). Furthermore, the number of days that calves had an elevated fecal score in the first 21 d was lower for HEA calves than for DIA calves (1.88 vs. 6.90 ± 1.19 d; P < 0.001; Table 3 ). We did not attempt to identify specific pathogens to determine the cause of the elevated fecal score, but several common enteric pathogens are implicated in calf diarrhea and likely contributed to disease in these experiments (Cho and Yoon, 2014) . The timing of infection ranges from a few days after birth to 1 to 2 wk of age or beyond, but several pathogens affect calves around 1 to 2 wk (Foster and Smith, 2009; Cho and Yoon, 2014) . Figure  1 shows the number of calves in each experiment by day first classified as diarrheic. The incidence of diarrhea as classified in this data set varied among experiments, but the average overall for the calves in our analysis was similar to a report from the United States indicating that 21.1% of preweaned heifers experience diarrhea (NAHMS, 2014) . In these experiments, the exact age relative to birth of the calves was unknown, but we targeted enrolling calves less than 1 wk of age, and the timing of calves first being classified as DIA varied across experiments. Experiment 1 had the greatest number of DIA calves (68%), and the majority were classified as DIA within the first 5 d after arrival. These calves were estimated to be slightly older (but still under 1 wk of age) than those in the other experiments, due to their origin. As well, these calves had been transported the furthest (5 h transport time and 470 km) and were purchased from a dealer who had collected calves from multiple farms and commingled the calves before transport to our research facility. The calves from the other experiments originated from a single local farm, and research personnel selected them for inclusion in each experiment within 2 to 3 d of birth based on initial total protein and visual health assessment. Those calves were transported only 30 min and 38 km to the research facility. The proportion of calves classified as DIA in these experiments was much lower than in experiment 1, ranging from 11.1 to 27.3%. In general, we found lower incidences of DIA classification on the initial day after arrival in experiments 2, 3, and 4, but over the course of the 21 d incidence increased from d 10 to 15. Although the protocols for care were similar among experiments, the incidence, timing, and duration of diarrheic episodes in calves varied. The stressors (comingling, transportation) that calves in experiment 1 faced were likely greater than those in the other experiments, and may have impaired calves' ability to cope as well with enteric challenge (Davis and Drackley, 1998) . Calves that died within the first 21 d of arrival were included in the analysis. One calf that was classified as HEA died from bloat on d 14 after arrival. As well, 7 DIA calves died within the first 21 d after arrival, with an average day of death of 9.7 d after arrival at the research facility. Data from those calves were included until the day they died. Total protein concentration in serum or plasma often is used on farms to evaluate passive immunity as an alternative to the gold standard, which quantifies IgG1 by radial immunodiffusion (Tyler et al., 1996; McGuirk, 2011) . Failure of passive transfer of immunity is associated with increased mortality rates (Donovan et al., 1998a; Tyler et al., 1998 Tyler et al., , 1999 . In the present study, initial serum total protein did not differ between classification groups, and values were above the recommended cutoff of 5.5 g/dL (McGuirk, 2011; P = 0.20; Table 4 ). One experiment found that total protein was not a significant risk factor for diarrhea in the preweaning period (Windeyer et al., 2014) . Results from the literature are mixed concerning the effect of successful passive transfer of immunity on reductions in diarrhea in preruminant calves. Several studies have observed no effect (McEwan et al., 1970; Caldow et al., 1988; Harp et al., 1989; Meganck et al., 2015) , but others have shown a reduction in the incidence and severity of diarrhea (Boyd, 1972; Naylor et al., 1977; Fallon et al., 1987; Lora et al., 2018) related to measures of adequate passive transfer. The type of enteropathogen, calf management, or environment may predispose calves to enteric challenge in the preweaning period. Seasonal effects may predispose calves to increased enteric morbidity. Calves born in winter had higher incidences of diarrhea than calves born in summer (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986; Curtis et al., 1988) . As well, calves born in fall were more likely to have diarrhea than calves born in the spring or summer (Windeyer et al., 2014) . In our experiment, the average ambient environmental temperature in the first 21 d after arrival was higher for DIA calves than for HEA calves (17.1 vs. 13.4 ± 0.6°C; P < 0.01; Table 4 ). The odds ratio (OR) indicates the probability of an event occurring for the first classification in comparison to the second classification. If the OR is >1, the first classification is more likely to have diarrhea or be medicated than the second classification by a factor of the difference above 1. If the OR is <1, the first classification has a lower probability of occurring than the second classification. 3 Fecal scores were assigned on a scale of 1 to 4: 1 = normal and well formed; 2 = soft but still holds form; 3 = loose, without form; 4 = consistency of water. Fecal scores were assigned on a scale of 1 to 4: 1 = normal and well formed; 2 = soft but still holds form; 3 = loose, without form; 4 = consistency of water. Infections (clinical and subclinical) in domestic food animals result in animals that eat less, grow more slowly, and are less efficient at converting feed to body tissue (Johnson, 1998) . In our data set, significant classification × time interactions occurred for starter, MR, and total DMI over the 21 d after arrival (Figure 2 ). Cumulative MR intake was decreased for DIA calves compared with HEA calves (15.9 vs. 16.6 ± 0.6 kg; P = 0.06; Table 4 ). This finding was likely because DIA calves were more likely to refuse MR than HEA calves (OR 2.77; P < 0.001; Table 2 ). Inflammatory cytokines mediate the reduction in feed intake in sick animals, which may be a protective mechanism in the short term (Johnson, 1998; Dantzer, 2006) . Several groups have recommended that calves should continue to be offered and consume at least part of their normal milk or MR throughout enteric challenges, because it aids in recovery (Garthwaite et al., 1994; Quigley et al., 2006; McGuirk, 2011) . Nevertheless, intake of MR solids was significantly reduced in DIA calves relative to HEA calves. As well, cumulative starter DMI was decreased for DIA versus HEA calves (0.9 vs. 1.5 ± 0.5 kg; P < 0.01; Table 4 ). As a result, cumulative total DMI was also decreased for DIA calves versus HEA calves (16.8 vs. 17.9 ± 1.1 kg; P < 0.01). Promotion of early consumption of starter intake is critical for rumen development and function in the preruminant calf (Drackley, 2008) . Depressed growth rates and risk of disease have been associated with reduced dry feed intake preweaning, so enhancing milk intake early in Figure 1 . Day of experiment when dairy calves were first classified as diarrheic (fecal score >2 for ≥3 consecutive days) in the first 21 d after arrival for 4 experiments included in the data set. Table 4 . Initial concentration of total protein in serum (g/dL), average ambient environmental temperature, and total cumulative intake of free water, electrolyte, milk replacer water, and total water (L/d) by dairy calves classified as healthy or diarrheic 1 in the first 21 d after arrival at the research facility life is critical for continued growth (Khan et al., 2011; Steele et al., 2016) . Diarrhea results in major water and electrolyte losses from the body through the feces (Davis and Drackley, 1998) . The reduced solids intake from MR also resulted in reduced cumulative water consumption from MR for DIA calves compared with HEA calves (104.0 vs. 108.1 ± 3.4 L; P = 0.03; Table 4 ) in the first 21 d after arrival, as well as reductions within a week compared with HEA calves (Table 5) . A significant classification × time interaction for water from MR (Figure 3 ) indicated reductions in water intake from MR for DIA calves. We found no differences within week for FW intake or cumulative FW intake (Table 5) . A significant classification × time interaction occurred because of numeric increases in FW intake for calves classified as DIA and because of tendencies for intake to be greater on d 3, 6, and 7 ( Figure 3 ). Calves classified as DIA were more likely to receive EC (OR 394.4; P < 0.01; Table 2 ) and were given EC for more days than HEA (2.05 vs. 0.22 ± 1.34 d; P < 0.01; Table 3 ). The significant classification × time interaction supported the general trend of greater consumption of EC for DIA calves over the course of the 21 d after arrival (Figure 3) . Overall, the total cumulative intake of EC was greater for DIA calves than for HEA calves (4.2 vs. 0.5 ± 0.4 L; P < 0.01; Table 4 ) and within each week, DIA calves consumed more EC than HEA calves (P < 0.05; Table 5 ). Electrolytes should not replace normal water consumed through milk, MR, or ad libitum FW, but are required as an additional source of fluids to correct dehydration (McGuirk, 2011) . Ultimately, we found no differences within week for total water intake (P > 0.05; Table 5 ). Similarly, cumulative total water intake did not differ between classifications. Taken together, this finding supports common recommendations that with the reductions in water intake from milk or MR and increased excretion of water in the feces (indicated by elevated fecal score), supplemental EC is crucial for maintaining overall water intake and electrolyte balance during enteric challenges in calves (Smith, 2009) . Water is the most important nutrient, consumed in the largest amount relative to all other nutrients (Murphy, 1992; Drackley, 2008) . Calves should have access to free water from soon after birth, in addition to the water consumed in milk or MR (Drackley, 2008) . It is important to note that calves were not restricted in the free water available to them in these experiments. As a result, total water intake was not different between classifications. If free water had been limited, the DIA calves might not have been able to maintain total water consumption, and this could have resulted in a more severe imbalance in water and electrolytes. Although we did not measure hydration status in these experiments Figure 2 . Intake of (a) starter, (b) milk replacer, and (c) total DM (g/d) by dairy calves classified as healthy (solid line) or diarrheic (dashed line; fecal score >2 for ≥3 consecutive days) in the first 21 d after arrival at the research facility. Error bars represent SE of the LSM. *Intake differed (P ≤ 0.05, Tukey-adjusted); †intake differed (0.05 < P ≤ 0.10, Tukey-adjusted). except for a visual assessment by the research personnel, it may be interesting to evaluate hydration status in future experiments as an indicator of how changes in water intake may influence overall hydration and how calves may self-regulate their water balance when challenged with enteric disease. In a survey of operations in the United States, the average age water was first offered was 6.6 ± 1.3 d (range 4.1 to 10.6 d) for operations classified as large or small, respectively (USDA, 2012) . However, it is important to provide water earlier to dairy calves because they increase the amount of free water they drink after both colostrum intake and transportation (Thickett et al., 1981; Kertz et al., 1984) . Soon after arrival, all calves averaged approximately 1.5 L/d of free water intake within the first week of age. Reported data on water intake in young calves are scarce. In general, the reported values averaged less than 2 L/d for the first 3 wk and then increased with starter intake and weaning (Thickett et al., 1981; Kertz et al., 1984) . A more recent experiment determined that free water intake was similar between 2 MR feeding levels and increased as starter intake increased (Quigley et al., 2006) . On the opposite spectrum, recent work has reported water intake in calves given ad libitum access to milk (Hepola et al., 2008; de Passillé et al., 2011) . The NRC (2001) suggests that water intake ranges from 1 L/d in the first week to 2.5 L/d by wk 4. In our data set water intake ranged from 1.5 to 3 L/d in calves under 3 wk of age. Enteric disease is associated with decreased BW gain. Actions of viruses, bacteria, and protozoa vary by species type and location in the intestine. Damaged intestinal epithelium can cause prolonged malnutrition and decrease growth rates in affected calves due to malabsorption and fermentation of undigested milk in the intestinal lumen (Cho and Yoon, 2014) . Body weight and frame growth measures are shown in Table 6 . Initial BW did not differ between classifications (P = 0.49). A classification × time interaction for BW during the 21 d after arrival at the research facility indicated that HEA calves became heavier than DIA calves (50.8 vs. 48.7 ± 0.5 kg; P < 0.01). Consequently, we found a tendency (P = 0.07) for HEA calves to have greater ADG than DIA calves (669 vs. 491 ± 120 g/d). Furthermore, significant classification × time interactions for hip height and heart girth (P < 0.01) revealed the same type of response. Body weight and frame growth measures are shown by week in Table 7 . Classifications differed for all variables except ADG of withers height. Health status, including diarrhea, has been shown to have a significant negative effect on growth during the first 6 mo of life (Donovan et al., 1998b) . Classification effects were significant on gain-feed ratio for both MR intake and total DMI: DIA calves were less efficient than HEA calves ( Table 6 ). The overall trend indicated that HEA . Intake of (a) free water, (b) electrolyte water, (c) milk replacer water, and (d) total water (L/d) by dairy calves classified as healthy (solid line) or diarrheic (dashed line; fecal score >2 for ≥3 consecutive days) in the first 21 d after arrival at the research facility. Error bars represent SE of the LSM. *Intake differed (P ≤ 0.05, Tukey-adjusted); †intake differed (0.05 < P ≤ 0.10, Tukey-adjusted). calves were heavier and larger than DIA calves within 21 d of arrival. Increased preweaning ADG has been positively linked to first-lactation milk yield (Soberon et al., 2012) . As well, the health of calves has been associated with longevity; calves treated with antibiotics (indicating illness) had decreased lifetime milk production (Soberon et al., 2012) . Moreover, the number of days that calves are sick in the first 4 mo of life has been shown to have negative effects on first-lactation 305-d mature-equivalent milk yield and actual production of milk, protein, and fat (Heinrichs and Heinrichs, 2011) .
