To parameterize the metapopulation epidemiological model we follow Chinazzi et al. [7] and set a generation time of 7.5 days and a reproduction number R 0 equal to 2.4. The latent period is set to 3 days [21] . Although similar .

The outbreak is seeded by introducing 40 exposed individuals on Jan. 1st (Jan. 12th in 2019) [7] . Then, the simulations run for 35 days in both cases and we extract the cumulative number of infected cases in each region as a function of time. Note that as there was no travel restriction in 2019, one can see the results obtained with the 2019 data as the more plausible outcome for the 2020 outbreak should travel restrictions were not adopted. In other words, by comparing 2019 with 2020, we can factor out the impact of the early travel reduction in the city of Wuhan and the subsequent changes in the mobility pattern of the population. Fig. 2 shows the cumulative number of infected individuals for Hubei and for the rest of mainland China. The large majority of cases, in all situations considered, are contained within Hubei province. However, when we look at the predictions on the rest of the country, we begin to see growing differences between the scenarios analyzed. The results in Fig. 2B also show that travel restrictions have a positive impact in the temporal evolution of the disease (compare 2019 with 2020), in so far the reduction in the flow of individuals delays the spreading of the disease to the rest of mainland China. However, as it can also be deduced from the trend of the curves in Fig. 2B , there is no indication that the growth in the number of cases will evolve following a different functional form. In other words, if no further measures are taken and no modifications are made to the model, one would find that the number of simulated cases at day τ in 2019 would be the same ∆ days after τ in 2020. Fig. 2A also shows that there is a large difference between the cumulative number of cases predicted in 2020 and the reported one. Although, as previously discussed, this has been reported by several other studies, to ensure that the methodology is correct, and to further analyze the effect of the mobility pattern, in Fig. 3 we show the correlation between the real values of infected individuals and the simulated ones for 2020. We obtain a Pearson correlation of 0.81 implying that the assumptions behind the model, albeit simplistic, can correctly describe the basic dynamics of the epidemic. Furthermore, we also see that the data-driven model is able to predict better the dynamics than its random counterpart. Lastly, we have also studied the difference in the predicted number of cases in each region between 2019 and 2020 at the end of the simulation period. Results are reported in Table I , where we show the median as well as the corresponding 5-95% quantiles. As it can be seen in the Table, in the vast majority of the regions the predicted number of cases in the scenario in which travel is not banned (2019) is larger than for those obtained with data from 2020. Interestingly, there are some regions in which the situation reverses. We have no explanation for this (small) negative deviations. Summarizing, we have studied a data-driven metapopulation model that allows assessing the effects of early travel restrictions in Wuhan and Hubei province. Even if our modeling framework is simpler than other more sophisticated We also note that the observed shift of the epidemic curve and the effect of travel restriction might be underestimated because the large majority of people had already moved before these mobility restrictions were implemented (as it can be seen in Fig. 1 ). Our study is limited in several aspects that can constitute future research goals. First, the geographic resolution allowed by the mobility data used here is low. Considering large regions have the undesired effect that one can not add structure to the population and therefore the dynamics within each subpopulation is constrained by the homogeneous mixing hypothesis. This limitation could be overcome if less granular spatial and temporal data becomes available. Secondly, and perhaps more important as it currently represents a scientific challenge, we have assumed that the transmissibility does not change during the whole simulation period. This implies that changes in behavioral patterns of the population are not fully accounted for nor they can be completely disentangled from those associated with travel restrictions. Understanding how to deal with such behavioral changes is key for the development of more realistic descriptions of the large-scale spreading of diseases. Finally, another critical feature of current models that needs to be improved in future research is the use of disease parameters −notably R 0 − that are constant both in time and across populations.
