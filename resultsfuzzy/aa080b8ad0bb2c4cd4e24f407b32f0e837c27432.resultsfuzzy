vation. To further detemine the contribution of each MAPK pathway to ALV infection, we investigated the effect of each MAPK pathway inhibitor on viral production measured by viral RNA transcription and viral protein synthesis. As shown in Fig. 9a , addition of PD98059 or U0126 at 0 h p.i. or 1 h p.i. significantly inhibited viral transcription compared with the vehicle-treated control. Similarly, a significant decrease in viral transcription was observed when SP600125 or SB203580 was added at − 1, 0 or 1 h p.i. However, no statistical differences in viral transcription were observed when either inhibitor was added at 4 h p.i. Moreover, addition of U0126 at 0 h p.i had an inhibitory effect on the viral RNA levels of ALV-J and on the ALV-J-induced VEGF mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 9b) . Treatment of cells with inhibitors at − 1, 0, 1, 2 and 4 h p.i. with ALV-J, showed that 20 μ M SP600125 treatment resulted in a remarkable decrease in VEGF mRNA expression levels, however, incubation with 20 μ M SB203580 showed no significant effect (Fig. 9c) . These results demonstrated that MAPK primarily acted at an early stage of ALV-J replication cycle. The ERK pathway inhibitor, U0126, and the JNK pathway inhibitor, SP600125, significantly reduced the levels of VEGF mRNA expression, whereas the p38 pathway inhibitor, SB203580, exhibited no statistical difference in VEGF mRNA expression compared with DMSO treatment before ALV-J infection.
