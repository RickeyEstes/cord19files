The animals studied showed lesions of varying severity at all time points during the study with exception of one calf Table 2 Oocyst excretion of groups B (n = 2), C (n = 2), D (n = 12) and E (n = 11) of Studies I and II, characterized by median of the opg (oocysts per gram), minimum opg and maximum opg in the respective group (data for previous faecal oocyst counts is not given in this table, in all faecal examinations on 0 -14 dpi (day post infectionem) no oocysts were detected); *: na = not applicable (animals sacrificed) The gross pathological examinations revealed no remarkable abnormal findings in the calves of group A (prepatent period, 16 dpi). In group B (patent period, 21 dpi) the mucosa of caecum and colon of both animals was slightly reddened. In group C (26 dpi), necropsy revealed slight reddening of the mucosa of the caecum of both and in the colon of one of the two calves. The main characteristics under the light microscope of the intestinal sections taken from the animals examined during the late prepatent period (Group A, 16 dpi) were mild inflammatory infiltration of the mucosa and increased cellular debris (also containing merozoites and trophozoites) in crypts and glands from the caudal jejunum to the middle colon. The caudal jejunum of one animal contained some second-generation schizonts (Fig. 1a) . In group B animals which were sacrificed on 21 dpi, parasitic structures were identified from the middle jejunum to the middle caecum (Fig. 1b) . The caecum and proximal colon showed particularly high levels of infection. In both calves acute typhlitis and partially necrotising colitis were found in addition to inflammatory granulocytic infiltration of the mucosa and cellular debris in most of the intestinal sections examined (Fig. 1c) . While the superficial mucosa was already visibly repairing in one animal, the other animal also showed slight inflammatory demarcation of the submucosa. In one of the group C calves subjected to pathological examination (sacrificed 26 dpi), the intestinal mucosa was characterised by slightly shortened villi in the middle jejunum, while slight re-epithelialisation was identifiable in the caecal mucosa. In both animals, regeneration and/ or hyperplasia of the cryptal epithelium with proliferation of goblet cells was observed in the caecum and colon, and in one animal also in the terminal ileum. At most of the localisations examined, mixed cellular inflammatory infiltrates in the mucosa and cellular debris were still present. The scanning electron microscopic evaluation of animals from the prepatent period (Group A, 16 dpi) revealed a normal appearance of the ileum (Fig. 2a) in both animals with some minor irregularities of the epithelial structure in one calf. In the caecum of one animal there was a superficial epithelial injury of slight/moderate degree and in the colon of this animal of minimal degree, corresponding to the inflammatory changes observed by light microscopy. In the caecum and colon of the other animal no abnormal findings could be detected. The calves from the patent period (Group B, 21 dpi) showed some focal damage of the apical villous structures together with some bacteria focally incorporated. In the caecum (Fig. 2b ) and the colon, distinct loss of the superficial epithelial layer occurred in both animals. Higher magnification of the lesions clearly demonstrated the disrupted epithelial layer with inflammatory cells in the deeper levels of the mucosa. In the ileum of the animals sacrificed in the late patent or postpatent period (Group C, 26 dpi) the apical epithelium of the villi showed some injury in one of the two animals (Fig.  2c) . This demonstrated the involvement also of the terminal ileum in the process at that time point. The findings in the colon and caecum of group C calves were consistent with the findings in group B in terms of quality, but were of a milder nature. No parasitic structures were detected by electron microscopal examination of the intestine, which was consistent with the findings of light microscopy showing parasitic structures only in deeper layers of the intestinal mucosa.
