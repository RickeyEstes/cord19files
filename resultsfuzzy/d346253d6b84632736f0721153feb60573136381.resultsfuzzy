POC devices which permit visible readouts are generally associated with a more affordable cost, since the need for advanced instruments for quantitative detection is eliminated. It is therefore a welcomed addition to POC technology, considering how it helps realize one key element of the ASSURED criteria. One recent example microfluidic immunoassay with naked-eye readouts leveraged on the changing appearance of liquid crystals (Zhu and Yang, 2015) (Fig. S5(a) ). Binding events between antigens and immobilized antibodies triggered a shift of the LqC appearance from dark to bright. This phenomenon could be visualized without the need for sophisticated devices. The technique exhibited good robustness, a LOD of 1 Î¼g/ml. In addition, good specificity was demonstrated using bovine serum albumin as the non-target interference (10-fold concentration compared to the target analyte). Another example is the volumetric bar-chart chip reported by Song et al. for the detection of disease-specific proteins (Song et al., 2012) (Fig. S5(b) ). In this study, catalase and antibody molecules were both conjugated onto the surface of silica NPs. If the target analyte was present in the sample, the enzyme would catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in the solution to give out oxygen. The extent of pressure build-up inside the enclosed columns was proportional to the amount of oxygen gas produced. The rise in column pressure elevated the ink columns upwards. In a nutshell, the extent of elevation was designed to be indicative of the amount of the protein biomarkers in the sample. The presentation of quantitative results in the form of bar charts, as suggested by the name of the device, could be readily interpreted with just naked eyes. Moreover, the oxygen-producing reaction facilitated by catalase occurred very rapidly, within seconds (George, 1947) . This was arguably the key feature of the system, which helped shorten the total assay time. Duration was further decreased by virtue of this POC system's impressive multiplexing power, which permitted up to 50 concurrent tests. Apart from the aforementioned strengths of this system, it did exhibit certain limitations (Zhu et al., 2014) . The biocatalytic capability of the enzyme could possibly be impaired during the conjugation step. The fact that catalase enzyme itself is highly susceptible to hydrolysis further cast doubt on the reliability of the assay. More recently, Zhu et al. developed an immunoassay based on similar concepts, but with certain alterations to expunge the existing drawbacks (Zhu et al., 2014) . To tackle the problem at its root, the easily degraded catalase was replaced by hybrid NPs comprised of a gold shell and a platinum core (Au@PtNPs). These Au@PtNPs were encapsulated inside aptamer-modified hydrogels. When the biomarker of interest was added, its interaction with the aptamers found on the exterior of the hydrogels would trigger their disintegration. Au@PtNPs would then come into contact with hydrogen peroxide molecules already present in the test solution. In this manner, the hybrid NPs assumed the role of catalase. This led to the formation of visible bar-chart displays, as explained above in the study of Zhu et al. (Zhu and Yang, 2015) . This novel system could be conveniently adopted for detecting numerous protein and antibody biomarkers. After all, a diverse selection of aptamers could be procured through different means (Ellington and Szostak, 1990, Tuerk and Gold, 1990) . Subramaniam et al. demonstrated another system with visible readouts, referred to as metal-amplified density assay (Subramaniam et al., 2015) . Levitation of diamagnetic polystyrene beads was employed as the parameter for interpretation by naked eyes. In essence, antibodies specific to the biomarkers were conjugated onto these nano-sized beads. After sample introduction, successful immunoreactions would bring about a change in the density of the polystyrene beads. At first glance, such physical alteration proved to be too minute to be reliably detected. To address this issue, the authors revised the protocol by incorporating AuNPs into the POC system to amplify the change in density. Visible readouts using floating height of small particles are much more attractive than those dependent on colorimetric interpretation (Martinez, 2008) . The former have shown promises in parallel testing capacity by virtue of several kinds of colored beads. For instance, it was explored for simultaneous diagnosis of syphilis and hepatitis C (Subramaniam et al., 2015) . However, its protocol required a handful of steps which could appear confusing to on-site test performers.
