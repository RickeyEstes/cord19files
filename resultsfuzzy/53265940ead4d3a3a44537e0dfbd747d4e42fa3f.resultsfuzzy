We have previously demonstrated that the priming of the lung with sHsp elicits an enhanced immune response to a subsequent pathogen challenge [5] . However, we had yet to define the immune response to sHsp itself. Therefore to determine the rate and intensity of the sHsp-specific antibody response we again pretreated mice intranasally with P22, or vehicle. Mice were then rested for 72 h, and challenged with the OVA-sHsp conjugate, the OVA and sHsp admixture, OVA alone, or sHsp alone. We then evaluated the sHsp-specific serum antibody response over 14 days post-challenge (Fig. 3A) . We found that after only one challenge dose, all mice exposed to sHsp generated strong sHsp-specific IgG1 responses, which peaked as early as day 5 post-challenge in mice which had been pretreated with P22. Mice that did not receive P22 pretreatment were again two days delayed in the production of similar amounts of sHsp-specific antibody. However by day 7 post-challenge, all groups (except control OVA-only challenged mice) had generated similar levels of systemic sHsp-specific IgG1 in response to a single intranasal dose of sHsp antigen. Thus, the above-described OVA-specific response (Fig. 2 ) mirrors the accelerated kinetics of the sHsp-specific response, indicating that sHsp facilitates a carrier effect that results in an immune response to OVA that is similar to the response to the sHsp in both onset of antibody production and quantities produced. Because our samples were purified from an E. coli expression system, we examined whether or not the heightened antibody responses observed were amplified by the residual LPS contained in our VLPs. We pretreated mice with either "LPS-low" P22, "LPShigh" P22, an equivalent amount of LPS as contained in the "LPS-high" P22 preparation, or sterile pyrogen-free PBS in five daily intranasal doses, as above. Mice were then challenged with sHsp alone, and serum was collected over 8 days to evaluate total anti-sHsp IgG. Importantly, we found that both "LPS-low" and "LPS-high" P22 elicited an equally enhanced early antibody response to the heterologous VLP challenge, while mice which were pretreated with LPS did not (Fig. 3B ). In addition, we pretreated TRL4−/− or C57BL/6 mice with sHsp or PBS and challenged all mice with high-dose influenza virus. Importantly, only those mice that had been pretreated with sHsp were protected from influenza-induced body weight loss, regardless of their ability to respond to LPS (Fig. S2) . These results indicated that the observed heightened immunity in VLP pretreated mice was not dependent on contaminating LPS.
