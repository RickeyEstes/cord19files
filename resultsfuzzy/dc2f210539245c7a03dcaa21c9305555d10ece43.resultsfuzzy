Cd was found to be highly toxic to the seedling as well as for the microbial life present in the rhizopsphere of bean plant at all concentrations used.Morphology of plant was effected while colour of plant turns yellow. The growth of the plant was inhibited and the length of root and shoot was found to be decreased, cmpared with controll plants.Reduction in the proceses of the photosynthesis was observed as yellow coloured leaves appeared instead of green coloured because of the decline in the chlorophyll a and b contents. Nutritive values of plants decreases with the increase in the concentration of Cd metal which may be due to the absence of nitrifying bacteria which are normally found in symbiotic association with these plants where they fixes atmosphereic nitrogen in the roots of leguminous plants ( Dakora and Donald, 2002) but in the presence of Cd metal nodule formation was inhibited results in the decrease in the protiens contents and absence of amino acids at high concentrations of Cd. Potassium and sodium (Hsiao.T.C.,1986)were investigated and low percentages showed that accumalation of Cd was higher in the roots as compare to the other mineral ions due to which plants were not able to stand in the errect position.Iron Magnesium Magnese which were responsible for metabolic activity, transpiration and translocation were also effected and their percentages were also found to be decreased at higher concentration of Cd. Introduction: The mannan-binding lectin (MBL) pathway of innate immunity is important in host defense against pathogens. Major surgical trauma is known to influence various immune functions and in the present study we investigate the effect of major surgery on two central components of the MBL pathway; MBL and the associated protease MASP-2, compared with the effect on IL-6 and CRP levels. Methods: Sixty patients were randomized to open or laparoscopic colectomy for benign or malignant disease. Serum levels of MBL, MASP-2, IL-6 and CRP were determined preoperatively, and 1, 2 and 6 hours following incision, and at postoperative day 1, 2, 8, and 30 . Results: All four parameters showed a slight decrease in serum levels within the first two hours after incision. For MBL and MASP-2 a minor, but significant (P = 0.01 and P = 0.04 respectively) peak was found on postoperative day 8. Compared to the preoperative level a significant, 10-fold increase of IL-6 was found 6 hours after incision (P = 0.0001), and with levels significantly lower on day 30 (P = 0.0005). For CRP a significant increase was seen on postoperative day 2 (P = 0.0001), whereas the levels on day 30 were not statistically different from preoperative levels (P = 0.08). The levels of IL-6 and CRP were significantly correlated (r = 0.71, P b 0.0001), whereas no other significant correlations were detected between the parameters. No significant differences between the responses to the two surgical techniques were revealed. Conclusion: In contrast to the marked effects on the levels of IL-6 and CRP major surgery only marginally influenced the MBL pathway. There was no difference in the response to the two different surgical techniques. Objective: To study the theory of hemaimmune reaction. Methods: Cancer cells or yeast cells (or NS) were added into human fresh anticoagulant whole blood (or blood cells and plasma) treated by citric acid, and incubated for 30 minutes at 378. Main Outcome Indexes: adhering rate. IL-8, CD35, DARC (Fy6), CXCR4 et al. Results: It was found that cancer cells (dead cells) and yeast cells can activate a war of hemaimmune reaction (HIR). In time of war against cancer cells and yeast cells, the level of indexes (adhering rate, IL-8, CXCR4) was significantly higher than that in time of peace (NS control group). In time of war against cancer cells and yeast cells, level (IL-8) of HIR in white blood cell group with plasma added was significantly higher than that in white blood cells group without plasma. Level (IL-8, CXCR4) of HIR in white cells group with red blood cells added was significantly higher than that (IL-8, CXCR4) in white blood cells group without red blood cells added. Conclusion: human hemaimmune reaction looks like a modern war in the body. The results suggest that the complement and red blood cell play a vital role in blood immune reaction, and there is a road map of hemaimmune reaction: Antigens (cancer cells or yeast cells) can activate complement in plasma, then the antigens which were opsonized by complement C3b are mainly adhering to red blood cells, and then they are adhering to white blood cells to activate hemaimmune reaction system (see Figure l) . Furthermore, it can provide useful information for studying innate and adaptive immune and for establishing experimental (or war type) system of hemaimmune reaction road map. F2.14. A Novel CD70+ APC Imprints a Unique Pattern of NK Receptors on Gut Mucosal CD8 T Cells. We have identified a novel antigen presenting cell population in the intestinal lamina propria that constitutively expresses the costimulatory molecule CD70. Here we show that stimulation via this APC induces a unique pattern of NK receptors on the mucosal CD8 T cells. Resident CD8 T cells in the gut mucosa in naRve mice exhibited an activated phenotype and expressed the Ig family NK receptors 2B4 and gp49B1 but did not express the lectin-like CD94-NKG2 heterodimeric receptor. In contrast, activated CD8 T cells in the peritoneal exudate lymphocytes and spleen following Vaccinia or Listeria infection expressed gp49B1 and CD94-NKG2 and but did not express 2B4. Similar differences in NKR expression were also found on antigen-specific CD8 T cells generated at different sites during the same infection. The NKR expression profile in the gut mucosa was dependent on stimulation via CD70+ APC since 2B4 expression could be dramatically reduced by administration of blocking CD70 antibody. CD70 antibody treatment however, had no effect on NKR expression by activated CD8 T cells at peripheral sites, where CD70+ APC do not occur. However, when mice were intraperitoneally immunized with CD70 expressing allogenic P815 cells, 2B4 was induced on CD8 T cells accumulating in the peritoneal cavity. Thus, CD70 costimulation via CD70+ APC imprints unique NK receptors on mucosal T cells. We demonstrate the application of Bayesian networks for computational elucidation of causal intermolecular influences in signaling networks, using simultaneous multivariate measurements of phosphorylated proteins and phospholipids in populations of single human primary CD4+ T cells. Selective perturbations, both activating and inhibiting, were important to inferring the direction of influence between signaling components. We identified most classically reported signaling relationships and predicted novel influence connections, including inter-pathway crosstalk from the kinase Erk1 to the kinase Akt (confirmed experimentally). These results manifest the feasibility of data-driven construction of causal signaling network models from primary cell data at the single cell level and may have utility in understanding patient specific signaling alterations in disease states. Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is of limited value for assessment of most clinical states. As a more informative alternative, immunophenotyping may be combined with functional assays as a correlate of clinical status. Most functional assays, however, are tedious or require prolonged culture periods. One simple, highly informative, and rapid approach is to examine cell signaling within individual cells following brief stimulation. Abnormalities within the signaling pathways of specific cell types could provide important insights concerning pathological conditions. This study focuses on the JAK/STAT pathway as it is central to host defense, cell growth, and apoptosis. Dysfunction of this pathway has been observed within cancer cells of various types. We have developed conditions allowing dual labeling of cell surface markers and intracellular phosphorylated STAT members within individual, normal PBMCs, which have undergone rapid cytokine stimulation in vitro. The PBMCs are first incubated with a primary antibody against cell surface CD4, CD8, CD14, or CD56. Cytokine [IFNg, IL-2, IL-4, or IL-13] treatment is then applied to induce STAT phosphorylation. The cells are immediately fixed with 2% PFA and then permeablized with a cocktail of saponin, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetone at varying concentrations. The cells are labeled with primary antibody against several pSTAT proteins. Analysis of the efficacy of extracellular and intracellular labeling is completed using a BD FACSArray flow cytometer. With all of the reagents tested, it appears that there is a trade-off between intracellular and extracellular labeling of cells. 90% methanol, which was previously used in our lab and in the labs of others, gives a good signal for phospho-STATs, but does not allow identification of many cell surface molecules. Other permeabilization methods, such as saponin, and lower alcohol concentrations, allow for better cell surface labeling, but simultaneously cause a decrease in the pSTAT signal. Of the reagents tested, 70% methanol allows for the best dual labeling of both intracellular and extracellular proteins. These methods will permit rapid analysis of complex cell populations, including PBMCs. Interrogation of signaling pathways in individual cell types will allow more profound evaluation to gain additional insight into abnormalities causing or arising from the presence of immune dysfunction. Dendritic cells (DC) are key regulators of innate and acquired immunity. DC maturation is a critical event in the DC life cycle, conferring to it the capacity to both simulate T cell proliferation and polarization. DCs may be matured by Toll receptor ligands (like LPS), as well as by T cell dependent mechanisms via CD40 ligandmediated (CD40L) activation. We have previously demonstrated that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) inhibits several maturation events induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), including the upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules, and production of the key Th-1 polarizing cytokine IL-12p70. In the current study, we hypothesized that CSE also impairs DC maturation mediated by T cell dependent pathways through CD40L stimulation. CSE was generated by bubbling the smoke from one cigarette (1R3F University of Kentucky) through 10 ml PBS. Immature DCs were generated from human monocytes cultured with IL-4 (5ng/ml) and GM-CSF (800U/ml). During the final 48 hours of culture, DCs were incubated with CSE at concentrations that do not diminish cellular viability (as measured by Annexin V and Propridium iodide staining). During the final 24 hours, DCs were matured with interferon-gamma (50ng/ml) and CD40L (500ng/ml). The expression of costimulatory molecules was determined by flow cytometry and IL-12p70 concentration was determined by ELISA. PGE 2 levels were also analyzed by ELISA. CSE-conditioned DCs matured with CD40L, expressed lower levels of CD-86 and CMRF-56 compared to control DCs. In addition, IL-12p70 production by CD40L matured DCs was inhibited in a dosedependent fashion by CSE conditioning. CSE-conditioned DCs produced more PGE 2 than controls, suggesting a mechanism by which CSE alters DC maturation. Our data illustrate that CSE alters DC maturation induced by both LPS and CD40L. The inhibition of IL-12 production by CSE illustrates an important mechanism by which smoking inhibits essential adaptive immune responses relevant to the pathogenesis of cancer and certain infections.

Bacteriocin are low molecular weight single polypeptide or polypeptide complexes having an antibacterial activity, synthesized in ribosomes and secreted by bacterial cells or bthe group of heterogenous substances ranging from low molecular weight compounds to high molecular particles resembling bacteriophage protein components (Rasool & Khan, 1991) .Q In 1967 (Bradly) classified bacteriocins into two broad types: a) A group of low molecular weight, trypsin sensitive, thermostable bateriocin. b) A group of high molecular weight, trypsin resistant, thermostable beteriocin. Microorganisms in yogurt and the subsequent creation of organic acids and bio-active proteins inhibit the growth the growth of many pathogenic microorganisms. Methodology Different yogurt samples were used for isolation of bacterial strains After making the dilution of yougurt samples, the diluted samples were spreaded on nutrient agar and incubated at 37 8C. Isolated colonies were identified by using different conventional methods. Ten reference strains were used to check bacteriocinogenic activity. The isolates includes E. coli, Staph.aureus, Klebsiella, Salmonella, Enterococcus, Micrococcus, Bacillus, Staph. epidermidis, Pseudomonas. After this bacteriocin production was detected againt reference strains by using agar well and cross streak methods. The titres of bacteriocin produced were quantified by two fold serial dilutions of bacteriocin. Results and disscussion The average colony forming unit per ml calculated as 8.4Â10 6 Cfu/ml. The bacteria isolated were identified by using different conventional methods. Bacteriocin of Lactobacilli was active against Shigella, Bacillus and Micrococcus. The bacteriocin of bacillus was active against S. aureus, St. epidermidis, Enterococcus and E. coli. Bacteriocin of Pseudomonus was active against Shigella, S. aureus, St. epidermidis, Entercoccus, Micrococcus, Bacillus and S. typhi. The arbitrary unit of bacteriocin of Lactobacilli against Shigella is 1:4, against S. aureus is 1:2 against St. epidermidis is 1:8 against Entercoccus is 1:8, against Bacillus is 1:2. The arbitrary unit of bacteriocin of Pseudomonas against Shigella is 1:6, against S. aureus is 1:2, against St. epidermidis is 1:4. The arbitrary unit of bacteriocin of Bacillus was not found. It was found that yougurt contain high number of bacteria which include both Gram negative and positive species of bacteria. The bacteriocin of lactobacilli are broad spectrum as active against both Gram negative and positive bacteria and best inhibitory activity was observed against St. epidermidis. Pseudomonas produce powerful bacteriocin which inhibit the growth of majority of clinical isolates where bacteriocin of Bacillus and Lactobacilli were not as effective. We also observed those bacteria which produce bacteriocin line of diffusion after removal of growth and also bacteriocin activity was best observed when the plates were first refrigerated and then cross streaked which indicate that refrigeration temperature facilitated the diffusion of bacteriocin in medium.

We previously showed that FasL retrovirally transduced bone marrow-derived DC increase allospecific cytotoxic activities and Th1 cytokines production in vivo thanks to a FasL dependent neutrophils recruitment. The aim of our study is to test if the expression of FasL by DC can promote a stronger cytotoxic activity and a better anti-tumoral immunity compared with DC expressing a control Ag. We used the tymoma EL4 isolated from C57BL/6 mice and transfected with the cDNA encoding ovalbumin (EG7-OVA), the predominant Ag expressed by the tumor. We first evaluated a therapeutic approach which consisted in subcutaneous injection of EG7-OVA tumor cells and FasL or control-DC in C57BL/6 mice. We studied the consequences of the treatment on the tumor growth. We realised histological analysis on tumor sites and we measured the anti-tumoral T cell response. We observed that co-injection of FasL-DC and EG7-OVA cells inhibit tumor growth. Histology of tumors sites harvested from mice co-injected with control-DC and EG7-OVA cells showed only a moderate inflammatory infiltrate composed essentially of mononuclear cells. In contrast, tumor sites coming from mice co-injected with FasL-DC and EG7-OVA cells reveal a massive destruction of the tumor associated with apoptosis and neutrophils recruitment. We demonstrated that in vivo EG7-OVA apoptosis could not be explained only by the tumoricid activity of FasL-DC since we observed that only 6 to 7% of tumor cells were lysed by FasL-DC in vitro. We demonstrated that neutrophils contribute to the tumor eradication in FasL-DC and EG7-OVA co-injected mice as anti-Gr1 monoclonal antibodies treatment restore tumor growth. Finally, mice coinoculated with FasL-DC and EG7-OVA tumor cells displayed a higher Th1 cytokines production and were protected against tumor challenge. Indeed, we observed that the antitumoral protective response was mediated by OVA-specific CD8 + T cells. We now evaluate the role of neutrophils recruited by FasL-DC in the induction of the OVA-specific T cell response. Tumor vaccines are targeting CD8+ T-cells capable of differentiating into activated effector cells which mediate tumordestruction, and memory cells crucial for long-term tumor-immune surveillance. The CD8ab heterodimer represents the predominant CD8 form in the peripheral blood circulation, although some CD8+ T-cells express the homodimeric CD8aa. Recent data suggest that CD8aa cells may represent a biologically important subset of memory T-cells. We tested longitudinally sampled peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with melanoma, vaccinated with the differentiation antigen Melan/MART-1, for i) the presence of CD8aa expressing T-cells, ii) for T-cell differentiation and homing markers (CD45RA/CCR7) and iii) antigen-specific T-cells using AAGIGILTV (naturally processed peptide) and ELAGIGILTV (superagonist) peptides loaded into HLA-A2 tetramers. MART-1/Melan-A reactive T-cells were present in CD8ab and CD8aa expressing T-cells. Although CD8ab and CD8aa cells show a different composition based on CD45RA and CCR7 expression, the examination of tetramer Melan/MART-1 specific T-cells in the two CD8 subsets shows a terminally differentiated phenotype (CD45RA+/CCR7-) which is maintained over time. These data suggest that CD8aa cells represents a memory T-cell pool, contributing to a long-lived immune protection. We could consolidate this hypothesis using transfected recipient surrogate (TCR-/CD8-) cells which express either the MART-1/Melan-A specific TCR and CD8aa or CD8ab as a transgenes: TCR interaction with HLA-A2/peptide complexes shows different requirements in TCR+/CD8ab cells as compared to TCR+/CD8aa cells. In vitro culture of PBLs from vaccinated patients with melanoma, using different cytokines and peptide stimulation, showed that IL7 or IL2 lead to a differential expansion of the CD8aa and CD8ab Melan/MART-1 specific T-cell population, respectively. This represents the first ex vivo report of anti-tumor directed CD8aa T-cells in patients with melanoma undergoing peptide vaccination. The assesment of this memory T-cell population will be relevant for immunomonitoring of patients with tumors and aid to design improved tumor vaccines capable of stimulating long-lived cellular immune responses. Numerical values obtained for the binding and the dissociation rate coefficients are linked to the degree of heterogeneity or roughness (fractal dimension, D f ) present on the biosensor chip surface. The binding and the dissociation rate coefficients are sensitive to the degree of heterogeneity on the surface. For example, for the binding of adipose tissue interstitial glucose, as the fractal dimension value increases by a factor of 3.31 from D f1 equal to 0.5720 to D f2 equal to 1.891, the binding rate coefficient increases by factor of 8.88 from k 1 equal to 0.0545 to k 2 equal to 0.4841. An increase in the degree of heterogeneity on the probe surface leads to an increase in the binding rate coefficient. A dual fractal analysis gives a better fit in most cases for the binding kinetics. A single fractal analysis is adequate to describe the dissociation kinetics. Affinity (ratio of the binding to the dissociation rate coefficient) values are also presented. The values of binding rate coefficient, k, linked with the degree of heterogeneity existing on the biosensor surface provide a complete picture of the reaction kinetics occurring on the sensor chip surface. Dual fractal analysis is used only when the single fractal analysis did not provide an adequate fit. This was done by regression analysis provided by Quattro Pro 8.0. It is suggested that roughness on surface leads to turbulence which enhances mixing of glucose and decreases diffusional limitations leading to an increase in the binding rate coefficients for glucose. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is considered to be the typical autoimmune disorder resulting in the loss of pancreatic beta-cells with the consequent development of absolute insulin deficiency. However, the exact changes of the components of the immune system including impairments of different cytokines levels preceding the development of clinically overt type 1 diabetes mellitus remain not fully understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the serum levels of interleukin-16 in patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus. We studied 10 patients with clinically overt type 1 diabetes mellitus aged 8-15 years old before initiating of insulin therapy and 10 aged-matched healthy control subjects. Serum interleukin-16 levels were measured by specific immunoenzyme assay. We found that serum levels of interleukins-16 were significantly decreased in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus compared to control subjects-94 F 9.99 pg/ml vs. 270 F 34.78 pg/ml (mean F SEM), respectively, P b 0.001. These data could explain the decrease of the number CD4+ T-lymphocytes in subjects with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus which was revealed in our earlier studies as these lymphocytes represent the target cells for interleukin-16. We may hypothesize that revealed significant decrease of the interleukin-16 production could play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune insulitis and consequent clinical manifestation of type 1 gdiabetes mellitus. As organ-specific autoimmune diseases do not become manifest until well-advanced, interventive therapies must inhibit late-stage disease processes. Using a panel of immunogenic peptides from various g-cell antigens, we evaluated the factors influencing the efficacy of antigen-based therapies in diabetes-prone NOD mice with advanced disease. The ability of the major g-cell autoantigen target determinants (TDs) to prime Th2 responses declined by a 80% between 6 to 12 weeks of age, while the ability of immunogenic ignored determinants (IDs) of g-cell antigens to prime Th2 responses was unaffected by the disease process. The different patterns of TD and ID immunogenicity (even from the same g-cell antigen) may be due to the exhaustion of uncommitted TD, but not ID -reactive, T cell pools by recruitment into the autoimmune cascade. Therapeutic efficacy was associated with a peptideTs immunogenicity and ability to promote Th2 spreading late in the disease process, but not its affinity for I-Ag7 or its expression pattern (g-cell specific/nonspecific, or rare/abundant). Characterization of some IDs revealed them to be babsoluteQ cryptic determinants. Such determinants have little impact on T cell selection, leaving large precursor T cell pools available for priming by synthetic peptides. Traditional antigenbased therapeutics using whole autoantigens or their TDs cannot prime responses to such determinants. These findings suggest a new strategy for designing more efficacious antigen-based therapeutics for late-stage autoimmune diseases. Objectives: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common chronic liver disease, leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It has been considered tumor necrosis factor a or adipocytokine is important in the pathogenesis of NASH, which has a feature of metabolic syndrome. Although NASH is characterized by necro-inflammatory changes, an essential role of the inflammatory cells has not yet been identified. To clarify the role of inflammatory reactions in the pathogenesis of NASH, we analyzed the composition of liver-infiltrating cells isolated from liver biopsy specimens of NASH. Methods: 26 patients with NASH and 23 with fatty liver (FL) were analyzed. We performed immunohistochemical staining using antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, CD68, and CD15. Oxidative stress was assessed by the expression of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE). We counted the numbers of each population of liver-infiltrating cells (/mm 3 ). We diagnosed the liver histology using scoring system proposed by Brunt et al., and examined the correlations between the histological scores and the number of each population of liver-infiltrating cells. Moreover, we analyzed the surface markers of isolated liverinfiltrating cells by flow cytometry with antibodies against CD3, CD56, CD11b, lineage markers, HLA-DR, and CD1d in 5 cases. In addition, localization of CD1d expression was also examined, and analyzed the association with that of CD56 + cells by an immunohistochemical method. Results: Among various populations, only the numbers of CD56 + cells were significantly higher in NASH than those in FL (NASH: FL = 57.8 F 48.5: 15.4 F 15.2, P = 0.02). In NASH, the numbers of CD56 + cells tended to be decreased as fibrosis progresses (r = -0.55, P = 0.039), and the expression of HNE or the number of CD68 + cells showed a positive correlation with that of CD56 + cells (HNE; r = 0.56, P = 0.036, CD68; r = 0.55, P = 0.041). Moreover, flow cytometric analysis showed that NKT cells (CD3 + CD56 + ), rather than NK cells (CD3-CD56 + ), are increased in the livers with NASH. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis showed that CD1d molecules are found to be expressed on antigen presenting cells such as macrophages (CD11b + ) and dendritic cells (lineage-DR + ). In addition, CD1d expression was significantly increased in the liver with NASH compared with FL or normal livers. Importantly, a part of CD1d expression was recognized around CD56 + cells. Conclusion: We showed that NKT cells are proliferated and activated in an early stage of NASH. In the liver with NASH, hepatocytes contain a lot of fat with the lipid being peroxidated, which generates oxidative stress. Antigen presenting cells might uptake peroxidated lipid derived from degenerated hepatocytes, and present processed lipid antigen on CD1d. NKT cells would recognize those lipid antigens through CD1d, leading to the release of various cytokines. These processes could contribute to the pathogenesis of NASH. Type 1 diabetes is in most cases the result of cell-mediated autodestruction of pancreatic h-cells. We have shown previously that DNA coding for the pro-apoptotic BAX protein promotes diabetes prevention in pre-diabetic NOD mice when co-delivered intramuscularly with DNA coding for a secreted form of the h-cell antigen glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). Furthermore, codelivery of BAX recruits dendritic cells containing plasmid-encoded protein in peripheral lymphoid organs. Here, we report that the same DNA vaccine reverses new onset diabetes when delivered intradermally and induces immunosuppressive CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells (Treg). Female NOD mice received the vaccine at the time of diabetes onset and a second time in case of relapse. A variety of responses to the treatment were observed. Mice responded either to both the initial and relapse treatment, to the initial treatment only, or not at all. Fifty percent of the treated mice were overtly diabetic (fasting blood glucose N 300 mg/dL) by the age of 40 weeks. By contrast, more than 90% of untreated mice and of mice treated with plasmid vector alone were overtly diabetic by that age. Immunological analysis revealed that draining lymph nodes of mice treated with the pro-apoptotic DNA vaccine contained higher numbers of Treg with enhanced immunosuppressive function compared to control animals. Our results indicate that delivery of a DNA vaccine alone can reverse the symptoms of an autoimmune disease, and suggest a real clinical potential for pro-apoptotic DNA vaccines in the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory disorders. Recent studies concerning h cell turnover suggest that there is a continual process of h cell death and renewal. The effects of autoimmunity on this process have not been well studied but the regenerative potential of islet cells has been suggested by recent studies in animal models. We have examined changes in h cell mass and replication in the presence of islet inflammation, and during tolerance induction with CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells. The mean percentage of replicating h cells was higher in female pre-diabetic NOD mice (age = 9-14 wks) compared to aged matched NOD/Scid mice (1.62 F 0.9, n = 6 vs. 0.19 F 0.1%, n = 5; P b 0.01). There was no significant difference in h cell mass between the two groups (0.07 F 0.04 mg, n = 4 vs. 0.09 F 0.05, n = 4; P = NS). Upon diabetes onset in female NOD mice, the percentage of replicating h cells increased to 3.56 F 0.9%, n = 3. These data are consistent with a compensatory response to inflammation. To further demonstrate that the increase in h cell replication was in response to the anti-islet autoimmune process, h cell replication was measured in NOD/Scid mice 2 and 4-5 weeks post-transfer of diabetogenic splenocytes. Our data show an increase in the mean percentage of replicating h cells with time (0.90 F 0.1%, n = 2, and 1.93 F 0.4%, n = 3; P b 0.05 at 2 and 4-5 weeks post transfer, respectively). In contrast, no change in h cell replication was seen in non-treated age-matched NOD/Scid mice (0.26 F 0.1%, n = 2 and 0.15 F 0.1%, n = 3; P = NS). Cotransfer of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), harvested from NOD mice treated with anti-CD3 mAb, prevented the development of diabetes in NOD/Scid mice by adoptive transfer of diabetogenic splenocytes. Four weeks after adoptive transfer of diabetogenic cells and Tregs, only 1 out of 5 NOD/Scid mice developed diabetes. In contrast, 5 out of 5 NOD/Scid mice that received CD4+CD25-T cells and diabetogenic cells developed diabetes (P = 0.05). In mice protected by Tregs, h cell mass was significantly greater than in those that received CD4+CD25-cells (0.02 F 0.02 mg, n = 5 vs. 0.00011 F 0.00001 mg, n = 5, respectively; P = 0.03). The percent of replicating h cells in mice that received Tregs was 1.97 F 0.6%; n = 5, whereas h cell mass was too small to determine replication rates in recipients of CD4+CD25-cells. These findings suggest that in NOD mice, islet inflammatory lesions can play a role in stimulating h cell replication. Nevertheless, heightened h cell replication, initially in response to autoimmunity, is insufficient to overcome the rate of autoimmune-mediated beta cell destruction. Treatment with Tregs leads to improved preservation of h cell mass with maintenance of heightened h cell replication and prevents the development of diabetes in NOD mice. The NOD mouse is a key animal model of Type 1A diabetes. The majority of female NOD mouse develops immune mediated diabetes between 15 and 35 weeks of age but a subset remain non-diabetic after 40 weeks of age. Lack of diabetes development in these mice could be due to a failure of the immune system to completely target and destroy beta cells or to the presence of insulin producing cells resistant to destruction or both. In order to distinguish between these two hypotheses, we studied the pancreatic histology of 11 non-diabetic female NOD mice that remained non-diabetic after 40 weeks of age. These mice range in age between 42 and 96 weeks. From each pancreas we obtained H&E sections as well double immunofluorescence staining with antibodies to insulin and glucagon. Each of the eleven mice had severe islet lymphocytic infiltrates, which affected the majority of the islets. In 5/11 mice there was no insulin staining while in 5 mice there were islet cells that exhibited double positivity for insulin and glucagon. In one mouse, we could detect both single insulin positive cells (negative for glucagon) and cells with double positivity. In all mice studied, glucagon positive cells were preserved and in mice with insulin positivity only a subset of the glucagon positive cells expressed positivity for insulin. Transfer of diabetes was analyzed for six of these NOD mice by injecting 3 Â 10 7 splenocytes in 8-10 week old SCID-NOD recipients. These splenocytes rapidly induced diabetes (b 5 weeks). These data show that older non-diabetic NOD females show insulitis with loss of beta cells and that their splenocytes are capable of transferring diabetes. Furthermore, the surviving insulin positive cells show an unusual phenotype characterized by positivity for glucagon. Further studies will elucidate the origin of these cells and we hypothesized that double positive cells resist immune mediated beta cell destruction though alternatively they may represent unusual recently developed insulin expressing cells. We have previously demonstrated that the Programmed Death-1 (PD1) pathway plays a critical role in regulating the development of diabetes in NOD mice. In the present study, we explored the mechanisms involved in this regulation utilizing various knockout, transgenic and NOD congenic strains of mice. We observed that B cell deficient NOD mice, which are normally resistant to diabetes, develop the disease following PDL1 blockade whereas CD4 deficient NOD mice were resistant to PDL1 blockade; thereby suggesting CD4+ T cells play an important role in anti-PDL1 mediated acceleration of diabetes. We then utilized BDC2.5 TCR Tg mice to more clearly dissect the role of PDL1 in regulating autoreactive CD4+ T cells. PDL1 blockade precipitated early onset diabetes, an expansion of BDC2.5 TCR Tg cells, and decreased apoptosis. NOD congenic mice that have a variable degree of resistance to autoimmune diabetes (NOD.Idd5, NOD.Idd3, NOD.Idd3/10/18, and NOD.Idd9 usually develop diabetes with a incidence of 40%, 20%, 8% and 3%, respectively) were then utilized to study the role of PDL1 in diabetes resistance. Anti-PDL1 mAb treatment accelerated diabetes in all the congenic strains albeit with different acceleration patterns. Interestingly, in NOD.Idd9 congenic mice, PDL1 blockade both accelerated the time of onset as well as increased the incidence of diabetes to 50%. Utilizing Idd9 mice, we have shown that blockade of PDL1 results in precipitation of diabetes by changing the local cytokine milieu from Th2 to Th1 cells, with upregulation of IFN-gamma and TNFalpha. We conclude that PDL1 regulates autoimmune diabetes by limiting the expansion of autoreactive Th1 cells and thus plays a critical role in mediating disease resistance. These results provide the rationale for developing novel therapies to re-establish tolerance in autoimmune diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an immune-mediated disease characterized by the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic h-cells. A variety of environmental and genetic factors are involved in the development of the disease. We have previously developed an experimental autoimmune diabetes (EAD) model with insulin peptide B:9-23 immunization and/or polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C), as a viral RNA mimic Toll-like receptor (TLR) activator, in transgenic mice expressing the costimulatory molecule B7.1 in their islets (drivenly the Rat Insulin Promotor, RIP). B:9-23 peptide immunization induces diabetes and insulin autoantibodies (IAA) in I-A d mice expressing B7.1. A major goal is the development of bhumanizedQ mice that can develop immune mediated diabetes with known native autoantigen stimulus. As reported by Marron et al., human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2.1 transgenic NOD mice progress to diabetes more rapidly than A2 negative mice. We have combined transgenes for human A2.1 with B7.1 transgenic (BALB/c B7.1x C57Bl/6 A2.1 mice, original C57Bl/6 B7.1 mice were a gift from Dr L. Wen and C57Bl/6 A2.1 mice were provided from Dr B.L. Kotzin). Mice were immunized with B:9-23 with or without PolyI:C. Overall 29% of the mice by 41 weeks (n = 7, range diabetes onset 22-43 weeks) developed diabetes following Poly:IC injection alone. Forty-three percent developed diabetes by 26 weeks (n = 7; range 21-26 weeks, P b 0.54) with B:9-23 immunization and PolyI:C injection. Our studies indicate that human A2 is permissive for the development of diabetes in EAD but does not accelerate disease in the model following either TLR3 activation or peptide B:9-23 immunization. Studies are underway to define potential islet peptide A2 restricted antigen presentation using ELISPOT analysis in this model of immune mediated h-cells destruction. Sa1.134. Similarities and Differences in Autoimmune Responses between Type 1 and Type 1.5 Diabetes Patients. Type 1.5 diabetes or LADA comprises approximately 10% of Caucasian adult phenotypic type 2 diabetes patients. The islet reactive autoantibodies and T cells found in type 1.5 diabetes patients suggest an autoimmune pathogenesis. In this study, we asked how T cell reactivity and phenotype compared in type 1.5 versus type 1 diabetes. We identified type 1.5 diabetes patients (n = 12) through autoantibody and T cell responses to islet proteins. T cell reactivity to islet proteins was measured by cellular immunoblotting and peripheral T cell populations were measured by FACS and compared between type 1.5 patients versus type 1, type 2, and normal controls. T cells from both type 1 and type 1.5 diabetes patients respond similarly to islet proteins in the molecular weight regions of 116kDa, 97kDa, 60kD. In contrast, islet proteins in the molecular weight regions of 65-90kDa and 21-38kDa were significantly (P b 0.05) less stimulatory to T cell responses from type 1.5 diabetes patients versus type 1 patients. The number of CD4+CD25+ cells was significantly lower (P b 0.05) in the peripheral blood of type 1 patients compared to type 1.5 patients, type 2 patients and normal controls. CD4+CD38+ cells were significantly lower in the peripheral blood of type 1.5 patients compared to the other subject groups and T cell receptor positive gd cells were significantly (P b 0.05) decreased in the peripheral blood of type 1 and type 1.5 patients. These results suggest that type 1 and type 1.5 diabetes are immunologically similar in some respects but in other ways are different. These differences may be important in the slower disease progression of the type 1.5 diabetes disease process. disease process. Several viral infections including cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections have been implicated to be associated with the development of type 1 diabetes-related autoimmunity.The aim of this study was to explore whether there is any correlation between CMV infections and type 1 diabetes-associated autoimmunity in young children with HLA-conferred disease susceptibility. The cases with diabetes-associated autoantibodies and their HLA, age and sex-matched controls were participants in the Diabetes Prediction and Prevention (DIPP) Study running at the Universities of Turku, Tampere and Oulu in Finland. According to the study protocol, newborn infants carrying susceptible HLA genotypes are observed at 3 to 6 months intervals and regularly tested primarily for ICA and if positive also for GADA, IA-2A and IAA. Forty-one prospectively followed antoantibody positive subjects (21 girls, 20 boys, age 3 to 48 months, median 18 months) and 190 sex, age and HLA-matched controls were analyzed for CMV IgG class antibodies by EIA at the time of seroconversion to autoantibody positivity or within the next 6 months. No significant difference was seen in the prevalence of CMV antibodies. At the time of seroconversion 10 (24%) of the autoantibody positive subjects and 60 (32%) of their controls were positive for CMV IgG class antibodies (P = 0.47, Chi-square test). No differences were either found between ICA, GADA, IAA or IA-2 positive subjects and control subjects when each autoantibody was analyzed separately. In conclusion, these data suggest that early cytomegalovirus infections do not increase the probability to develop type 1 diabetes-associated autoimmunity. Rotavirus infections have been implicated as a possible trigger of T1D. We elucidated this connection by comparing peripheral blood T-cell responses to rotavirus between children with newly diagnosed T1D (n = 37), children with T1D-related autoantibodies (n = 34) and control children carrying HLA-conferred susceptibility to T1D but without T1D-related autoantibodies (n = 104). Lymphocyte proliferation assays based on stimulation with an antigen were performed using freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We measured also childrenTs IgG and IgA class rotavirus antibodies in plasma samples drawn at the same time as the T-cell samples. No differences were observed in the strength of T-cell responses to rotavirus between the children with overt T1D or multiple autoantibodies, or the control children. Furthermore, also the frequencies of positive T-cell responses to rotavirus were closely similar in all three groups. The result remained similar, when only the children with serological evidence of earlier rotavirus infections were studied. Further, no differences were observed in the responses to the control antigens PPD and tetanus toxoid, but T-cell responses to purified coxsackie B4 virus were stronger in the children with autoantibodies than in the control children. In conclusion, our cellular immunity studies provided no evidence supporting association of rotavirus infections with T1D or presence of T1D-related autoantibodies in young children. Diabetes is associated with infringment in endogenous opioid system and opposite alterations in various type opioid receptor sensitivity. However, it is not clear whether membrane lipid modification processes take part in development of such disorder as well, as their possible role in etiology of neurological complications in these patients. In order to evaluate processes mentioned involvement we suppose to investigate effects of selective delta-opioid receptor agonist Deltorphine II, delta-1receptor antagonist 7-Benzylidennaltrexone and delta-2 receptor antagonist Naltriben on some aspects of phosphoinositide cycle functioning in lymphocytes. The regulator role of processes mentioned at the initial membrane-bound step of studied opioid agonist and antagonists information translocation has been demonstrated in both diabetic and non-diabetic cells. The evidence exists that alterations in lipid-mediated signal transduction pathways and receptors lipid microenvironment may be responsible for altered nociception at diabetes conditions. The amplification of free radical processes is known to be one of pathogenic mechanisms to form a basis for neuropathological complications at diabetes conditions. However, it is not clear whether membrane lipid free radical oxidation processes and enzymes of antiradical defense system take part in such disorders. In order to evaluate the involvement of above mentioned processes in altered nociception at diabetes conditions the intensity of lipid peroxidation processes have investigated as well, as activity of enzymes of cell antiradical protection, superoxid glutathione reductase dismutase in diabetic patients erythrocyte membranes at the conditions of opioid receptors blockade and sensitization. Some correlation between intensity of enzymatic lipid peroxidation and opposite changes of receptor sensitivity as well. as possible participation of cell antiradical protection enzymes have been demonstrated. The evidence exists, that studied lipid mediated transduction pathway together with receptor microenvironment modifications appear to be possible biochemical targets of altered nociception at diabetes conditions. Sa1.138. Combinatorial treatment of recent-onset type 1 diabetes by induction of islet-antigen specific Tregs and anti-CD3. Rationale: A central issue when using immune-suppressive therapy in transplantation and autoimmunity is to balance benefits with systemic side effects. Administration of non Fc-binding anti-CD3 has shown good efficacy in temporarily maintaining Cpeptide levels in recent-onset diabetes over a 1-2 year timeframe, but immunosuppressive side effects limit higher-dose regimens or continuous administration. One novel attractive avenue in type 1 diabetes (T1D) is the islet autoantigen-specific induction of adaptive regulatory T cells (Tregs) that can act in vivo as bystander suppressors of autoaggressive responses selectively within the pancreatic draining lymph node (PDLN). In our hands, such cells can be induced via oral or intranasal administration of insulin, proinsulin peptides and DNA vaccines expressing islet antigens and efficacy is associated with IL-4 and IL-10 production. Their site specificity is a strong clinical advantage and can be attributed to the fact that autoantigens leading to their expansion and activation are only presented in the PDLN. Since anti-CD3 is known to increase numbers of intrinsic CD25+ Tregs as well as TGF-h and IL-10 production, we reasoned that it would create a favorable systemic milieu for islet-antigen specific induction of autoreactive, adaptive Tregs and synergy could be expected. Approach: Combinatorial therapy of recent-onset diabetes in NOD and RIP-LCMV mouse models using anti-CD3 FabT 2 and intranasal proinsulin. Results: At least 50% increased reversion of recent-onset diabetes was observed in NOD and RIP-NP mice treated with a combination of anti-CD3 and proinsulin compared to each intervention given alone. In particular, mice with more rapid beta cell loss benefited from this synergistic effect. Mechanistically, we observed increased numbers of proinsulin specific antigen-induced Tregs producing IL-4 and IL-10 in mice that received combinatorial therapy compared to those receiving anti-CD3 alone. Furthermore, we found much higher numbers of TGF-beta producing CD25+ Tregs in mice treated with both, compared to mice that received anti-CD3 alone. Conclusion: Antigen-specific induction of Tregs can synergize with systemic immune modulatory approaches to revert recentonset T1D. Synergy was evidenced by enhanced clinical efficacy and increased numbers of intrinsic TGF-beta producing CD4+CD25+ as well as adaptive autoantigen-specific IL-4/IL-10 producing Treg populations. This strategy should be considered for the clinic and maybe also for transplantation.

CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + T cells are thought to be essential in maintaining tolerance to self antigens. These cells, known as regulatory T cells (T R ), have been classified in two main categories: natural T R, which are derived from the thymus, and adaptive T R , which arise in the periphery. The importance of these cells in controlling responses to foreign antigens has just begun to be described. Previously, we have reported that activation of human CD4 + CD25-T cells led to expression of FoxP3 in CD25 + cells and acquisition of cell contact-dependent, cytokine-independent regulatory activity. Results in our laboratory reveal that these in-vitro derived T R could be generated from both memory and naive cells and by activation of CD4 + CD25-T cells with alloantigen or a foreign antigen, HA (307-319). In the HA system, MHC class II tetramers were used to identify antigen-specific T cells. Antigen activation of CD4 + CD25-led to two populations of CD4 + CD25 + cells, Tetramer + and Tetramer-cells, with antigen specific suppression occurring only in the Tetramer+ cells. HA generated T R required cognate antigen for activation, but once activated subsequently suppressed noncognate bystander T cell responses as well. For this reason, we have started testing the ability of a diabetes autoantigen, GAD65, to generate antigen-specific T R. GADspecific T R can be generated from both normal and diabetic subjects, and once activated these T R also suppress bystander T cell responses. This raises the possibility that antigen-specific T R may be useful therapeutically in autoimmune diseases by localizing generalized suppressive activity to tissues expressing select target antigens. TGF-h is produced by a variety of cell types and can exhibit strong immune dampening functions. Surprisingly, in a model of virally-induced autoimmune diabetes, local expression of TGF-h in h-cells under the control of a doxycycline-dependent promoter resulted in increased islet infiltration and disease incidence. This was attributed to a selective anti-apoptotic effect of TGF-h on differentiated memory-effector CTL. Conversely, mice lacking functional TGFh-receptors on T cells exhibited enhanced apoptosis and fewer memory CD8 lymphocytes. The effects of TGF-h were clearly dependent on the T cell differentiation status, as it effectively suppressed activation of naRve anti-viral CTL. Our results highlight a novel aspect of the pleiotropic nature of TGF-h, and have implications for the design of immuno-therapies involving this cytokine. Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells comprise a subset of regulatory T cells characterized by their co-expression of NK cell markers and an invariant TCR that recognizes a lipid antigen in a CD1d-restricted manner. Previously, we reported that activation of iNKT cells by the sphingoglycolipid alphagalactosylceramide (a-GalCer) protects against type 1 diabetes (T1D) in NOD mice. This protection involves the polarization towards a Th2-like immune response accompanied by increased IL-4. As potent activation of iNKT cells also trans-activates other immune cells, we further analyzed whether iNKT cells influence the function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells. We found that CD4+CD25+ T cells from NOD.CD1d-/-mice deficient in iNKT cells functioned similarly in vitro to CD4+CD25+ T cells from wild-type NOD mice and suppressed the proliferation of NOD T responder cells upon stimulation with a-GalCer. Adoptive transfer of NOD diabetogenic T cells and NOD CD4+CD25+ T cells pretreated in vivo with multiple low doses of a-GalCer further indicated that activation of iNKT cells do not influence the regulatory capacity of CD4+CD25+ T cells to inhibit the transfer of T1D. In contrast, protection from T1D mediated by adoptive transfer of activated iNKT cells requires the presence of CD4+CD25+ T cells, as splenocytes pretreated with a-GalCer and depleted of CD25+ cells were unable to confer protection from T1D. These data suggest that even though iNKT cells may not influence CD4+CD25+ T cell activity, iNKT cell-mediated protection appears to require the presence of CD4+CD25+ T cells.

NBI-6024 is an altered peptide ligand (APL) corresponding to the 9-23 amino acid region of the insulin B chain (B (9-23) ), which is an epitope recognized by interferon (IFN)-g-producing T lymphocytes in type 1 diabetic patients. Immunomodulatory effects of NBI-6024 in recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients in a phase I clinical trial (NBI-6024-0003) were measured using the ELISPOT assay in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. IFN-g responses to B (9-23) were observed in 62.5% (5 of 8) of patients receiving placebo and in only 8% (1 of 13) of non-diabetic untreated control subjects. NBI-6024 administration (five biweekly or biweekly-monthly s.c. injections) led to a dose-dependent reduction in the percentage of patients with IFN-g responses to B (9-23) and a concomitant increase in the percentage with IL-5 responses to B (9-23) . Similar trends were observed with NBI-6024specific ELISPOT responses. This Phase I clinical study demonstrated that NBI-6024 treatment did not enhance, but rather suppressed, the pathogenic IFN-g response of recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients in a dose-dependent fashion. Enhanced IL-5 responsiveness after NBI-6024 treatment is consistent with induction of a T helper (Th) 2-like immunological phenotype. The significance of these findings on the clinical outcome of disease is under investigation in a Phase II multi-dose study. There is an excess of HLA-DR3/DR4 heterozygous individuals among Caucasian patients with T1D. The incidence of T1D is rising in many countries and the MHC haplotype composition of T1D patients has also changed over the past several decades. Earlier, we proposed that, for any polygenic disease, if there is mixing of two populations with reciprocally different frequencies of susceptibility genes at different loci, the incidence in the mixed offspring will be much higher than in the original populations because of susceptibility gene complementation at those different loci. We propose that the apparent increased risk for HLA-DR3/ DR4 heterozygotes as compared with homozygotes for either HLA-DR3 or DR4 and the heterozygote overrepresentation among patients is because their parents appear to come from different, previously isolated populations. Thus, HLA-DR3 and DR4 are both disease and population markers. Our evidence is that (a) HLA-DR parental genotype distribution deviated from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in a way opposite to the patients: the parents had a paucity of HLA-DR3/DR4 heterozygotes, (b) DR3-transmitting parents had different HLA-A2 frequencies on their untransmitted HLA haplotypes than those who transmitted DR4, (c) DR3-positive parents had different INS allele frequencies than DR4-positive parents, and (d) parents of T1D patients had greater self-reported ethnic mixing than control parents. Thus, a specific kind of intrafamilial population admixture explains all three phenomena. Clinical Implications: Mycoplasma pneumonia is held responsible for 20% cases of community acquired pneumonia. Objective: To establish a experimental system of war against yeast cells in hemaimmune reaction road map. Methods: 0.2ml suspension of yeast cells (5Í10 8 /ml) (or 0.2ml NS as control) were added into 0.2ml fresh anticoagulant (citric acid) whole blood or 0.2ml white blood cells, added 0.3ml plasma (or 0.3ml NS as control), and incubated for 1h at 378. Further more, we added 0.2 ml red blood cellls into the tube abovementioned respectively, and incubated for 1h at 378. The hemaimmune reactionary activity was assessed by checking blood cell adhering rate to yeast cells, CD35, DARC (Fy6), CXCR4, IL-8, IL-6, CD25, gene activation (Fy6 gene) et al. Results: Yeast cells can activate hemammune reaction road map experimental system showing change of various indexes. Yeast cell activation method will be a useful method to study the relationship between whole blood cells and plasma and the relationship between red blood cells and white blood cells in hemaimmune reaction. Conclusion: It can provide a useful method for innate and adaptive immunity study and for immune regulation study and for the theory study of hemaimmune reaction road map in clinic. We found only scare acinar cells staining positively for IL-6 in the normal human pancreas (À/+); islets cells did not show IL-6 immunoreactivity. In slices of the pancreas, derived from patients with CP and CEP, a much stronger immunohistochemical reaction (+ +; + + +; diffused and focal) was noticed as compared to controls. IL-6 was localized in exocrine and islet cells of the pancreas. The immunohistochemical reaction of ducts cells was also strong. Interestingly, this cytokine was detected in cytoplasm and very close to nucleus. Moreover, in cases of CP and CEP with inflammatory infiltration, there were a markedly stronger IL-6 expression (+ + + +), than that observed in specimens without infiltrate. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the results presented herein clearly demonstrated a moderate and strong expression of IL-6 in exocrine and endocrine cells of patients with CP and CEP. This suggests that elevated IL-6 levels of patients with pancreatitis are probably owing to leakage of this cytokine in the circulation following massive pancreatic cells destruction. Recent data suggest that thymus derived CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells play an important role in the tolerance of the immune system towards tumors. These regulatory cells specifically express the transcription factor FoxP3 which is believed to be a master regulator of regulatory T cell development. In contrast to this thymic development, recent data have demonstrated that CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells can also be induced from naRve cells in the periphery. We and others have further provided evidence that TGF-beta is critical for this peripheral induction of regulatory cells by inducing the expression of FoxP3. Here we now demonstrate that the induction of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells by TGF-beta is a physiological event in the colon with a potential role in the pathogenesis of colon cancer. Accordingly mice were injected with a single dose of the mutagenic agent azoxymethane followed by three weekly periods of Dextran sulphate (DSS) in drinking water, interrupted by each 14 days of recovery. Treated animals developed numerous tumors in the colon. In a recent study we have shown that tumor growth in this colitis associated colon cancer model was driven by inflammatory CD4+ T cells infiltrating the tumor. As described for human colon cancer, we now demonstrate that dysplastic epithelial cells produced very high amounts of TGF-beta. Interestingly CD4+ cells isolated from the same tumors expressed high levels of FoxP3 mRNA while CD4+ cells isolated from surrounding non-dysplastic colon tissue did not. Our findings were further confirmed by immunohistochemical staining. Accordingly, FoxP3 expressing cells were found in high numbers in the lamina propria of the tumor closely associated to dysplastic epithelial cells. In contrast only few FoxP3 positive cells were detectable in the lamina propria of surrounding normal colon tissue. Based on these data, we speculated that tumor derived TGF-beta may induce FoxP3 in tumor infiltrating T cells. In order to functionally analyze whether tumor derived TGF-beta may play a role in the induction of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells in vivo we induced colon tumors in mice overexpressing a dominant negative TGF-beta receptor specifically in T cells. Tumors collected from these mice showed a similar infiltration with CD4+ T cells as compared to wildtype mice. However, CD4+ T cells isolated from tumor tissue of such transgenic mice showed strongly diminished expression of FoxP3 mRNA as compared to tumors of wildtype animals. Strikingly, tumors in transgenic mice were larger that wildtype tumors implicating that in this model of inflammation dependent colon cancer, tumor induced regulatory T cells control tumor growth. Based on our findings we propose a model in which tumor derived TGF-beta induces FoxP3 expression in infiltrating CD4+ T cells giving them a regulatory phenotype. Such tumor induced regulatory T cells in the case of inflammation dependent cancer can control tumor growth. However, in spontaneous cancer development tumor induced regulatory T cells may mediate tolerance towards the tumor by inhibiting anti-tumor immunity. Accumulating studies has addressed inflammatory bowel disease as an autoimmune disease. However, it is not known whether the intestinal epithelial cell-derived antigens are involved in generation of mucosal immune responses or are the target of the pathogenic process. By using a modified Serological Analysis of Recombinant cDNA Expression Libraries (SEREX) which is an antigen-screening approach utilizing humoral and cellular immune responses, we herein identify an epithelial cell-derived endogenous lectin, galectin-4 (G4), as a pathogenic mediator to exacerbate intestinal inflammation. G4 specifically stimulated the production of IL-6 by CD4 + T cells but not other cell types present in the diseased colon of CD45RB high -treansfer and DSSinduced colitis models and TCRa knockout (KO) mice. In contrast, G4 was unable to stimulate IL-6 production by CD4 + T cells present in the normal colon of these colitis models as well as wild type mice. Confocal microscopic analysis showed that G4 interacts with the immunological synapse on colonic CD4 + T cells as indicated by specific binding of G4 to the lipid raftaccumulating regions. Interestingly, the binding intensity of G4 on CD4 + T cells and the G4-mediated IL-6 production were increased under intestinal inflammatory conditions. G4 has been recently shown to specifically bind to sulfated (non-sialylated) core1 O-glycan structure. Indeed, expressions of a member of sialyltransferases (ST6GalNAc-2, 3, 6 and ST8Sia-1,3) that are specifically utilized for the modification of O-glycans were markedly downregulated in the CD4 + T cells only under inflammatory conditions. In addition, the exposure of core1 Oglycan without sialylation on the CD4 + T cells was confirmed by intensified binding of PNA that specifically binds to this oligosaccharide structure. Mechanistically, the G4-mediated IL-6 production by CD4 + T cells is mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) u-associated cascade as indicated by a fact that colonic CD4 + T cells from PKCu KO mice treated with DSS were unable to respond to G4 to produce IL-6. Functionally, administration of anti-G4 mAb not only led to the attenuation of chronic colitis in B cell-deficient TCRa double knockout mice but also effectively enhanced the recovery from 3.5% DSS-induced acute colitis. These studies not only indicate the presence of an immunogenic epithelial lectin that contributes to the exacerbation of intestinal inflammations but also provide a novel insight into the biological role of lectin/CD4 + T cell interactions under inflammatory conditions. Su1.127. Immunohistochemical Localization of Copper/ Medicine, Wroclaw, Poland; 3 Department and Clinic of Gastointestinal and General Surgery, Wroclaw University of Medicine, Wroclaw, Poland. We found only scare acinar cells staining positively for Cu/Zn SOD in the normal human pancreas (the body and tail of pancreas) (À/+; +); islets cells did not show Cu/Zn SOD immunoreactivity. In slices of the pancreas, derived from patients with CP and CEP, a much stronger immunohistochemical reaction (+ +; + + +) was noticed as compared to controls. Cu/Zn SOD was localized in both acinar and islet cells of the pancreas. Interestingly, immunohistochemical reaction of ducts cells was considerably stronger (+ + + +) than that of islet and acinar cells (+; ++). We also compared expression of Cu/Zn SOD and metallothionein (MT), at the same histological specimens and experimental conditions. Whereas, Cu/ Zn SOD was markedly manifested in ducts cells of pancreas, MT did not apeared in it. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these studies clearly demonstrate a moderate and strong expression of Cu/Zn SOD in acinar, islets and duct cells of patients with CP and CEP. This suggests that pancreatitis induce expression Cu/Zn SOD in pancreas. The overexpression of this enzyme in ducts cells may function as an intracellular antioxidant and can compensate for the lack of MT in the cells of pancreas. Celiac disease (CoD), an intestinal damage, is induced by gliadin, an alcohol soluble fraction of gluten. Peptic fragments of gliadin were shown to activate cells of innate immunity including macrophages/monocytes to cytokine and chemokine production. The aim of this study was to examine whether: (i) peripheral blood monocytes (PBMoC) respond to peptic digest of gliadin by IL-8 and or TNF-a production, (ii) this activity depends on the presence of IFN-g, (iii) there exist a difference in response of PBMoC isolated from blood donors, active and treated (GFD) coeliac patients (including analysis of the causal factors) (iiii) the signalling pathway is mediated via NF-nB molecule activation. Methods: PBMoC were incubated with various doses of peptic digest of gliadin alone or together with IFN-g, or pre-incubated with IFN-g before adding the gliadin. HLA genes were typed using PCR with sequence-specific primers (SSP-PCR). NF-nB DNA binding activity was detected by TransAM NF-kB transcription factor assay kit. Results: The capacity of monocytes isolated from active CoD patients and patients on GFD to produce IL-8 was significantly higher than that of healthy donors. The simultaneous addition of IFN-g had no enhancing effect on IL-8 production and the prestimulation of cells with IFN-g for 24 hours resulted in a significant increase of IL-8 production mainly in cells from healthy controls. The enhanced TNF-a secretion was detected mainly in gliadin stimulated monocytes from CoD patients and was markedly increased by simultaneous addition of IFN-g. Interestingly, prestimulation of cells with IFN-g for 24 hours increased gliadin-induced TNF-a production in the group of healthy donors and patients on a GFD, and slightly in the group of active CoD patients. This effect reduced the differences in TNF-a production among tested groups. The signaling pathway triggered by gliadin was mediated via NF-nB subunits p50 and p65. Specific inhibitors suppressed DNA binding activity of NF-nB as well as gliadin induced IL-8 and TNF-a secretion. The impact of HLA-DQ2/DR3 antigen expression in healthy donors and the keeping of GFD in treated patients on cell response were evaluated. Conclusions: IL-8 and TNF-a produced by the cells of innate immunity could enhance the effect of gliadin specific lymphocytes and participate in the cascade leading to the damage of intestinal mucosa in celiac patients. Objective: EE is an allergic inflammatory disorder of the esophagus with a significant recent increase in the number of reported pediatric cases. The initiation of the esophageal inflammatory injury has been theorized to be due to food allergies and possibly aeroallergen sensitivities. We reviewed the cases of 32 pediatric patients (pts) with EE in order to discern clinical, histological, and treatment correlates and to acquire a better understanding of disease pathogenesis. Methods: Allergy (food and aeroallergen) testing was completed on 26/32 pts. Serial Esophageal Biopsies were performed on 23/32 pts and serial clinical scores were determined on 25/32 pts. Clinical scores (0 to 5) were based upon the presence/absence of Abd pain, Vomiting, Dysphagia, Wt loss/gain, and Chest pain. Results: 22/25 pts (88%) demonstrated clinical improvement based on a comparison of clinical scores from baseline until after 3 to 45 months of treatment. Treatment: 11/22 pts-Elimination Diet (ED) + Steroids (swallowed Flovent or oral steroid); 8/22 pts-ED only; 2/22 pts-steroids only; 4/22 pts-noncompliant or PPI only. While the majority of pts (65%) demonstrated diminished esophageal eosinophilic infiltration (15/23 pts who underwent serial biopsies), 8/23 demonstrated clinical improvement with no evidence of diminished esophageal eosinophilic infiltration. No differences in treatment regimens existed between these groups. Further, 2/8 pts had been treated longer than average lengths of time, respectively for 30 and 34 months. Conclusions: EE is an allergic inflammatory disorder that in most cases clinically responds to a treatment regimen of ED and steroids. A subset of patients demonstrated an improved clinical outcome without diminished esophageal eosinophilic infiltration. These results may reflect an incomplete therapeutic response which requires close follow-up in order to detect an end of disease remission. Alternatively, these findings may be characteristic of a unique patient subset that merits further investigation. Infection by human immunodeficiency virus can involve several clinical manifestations affecting almost every organ or system in the body. Rheumatic manifestations may develop at any time of the clinical spectrum, but usually are seen in late stages, although sometimes they constitute the initial presentation of the viral illness. 46 patients (43 males, 3 females), with infection by HIV, from South Italy, were recruited for the study. HIV positivity was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and confirmed by Western Blot. Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire containing 10 questions pertaining to rheumatic diseases. The following data were collected: age, sex, duration of HIV infection, CD4 count. Rheumatologic manifestations were found on clinical evaluation by questionnaire administration and physical examination in 11 of 43 patients (23.9%). RESULTS: Arthralgias were the commonest manifestations, occurring in 9 patients (82%). Pain was usually intermittent and of moderate intensity and involved 2 or more joints. One patient had ReiterTs syndrome (9%) with a mild oligoarthritis of the knees and spondylitis responding promptly to NSAIDs. Another patient had a mild oligoarthritis (9%) involving knees and ankles. CD4 count was 481 F 264 (mean F standard deviation) in the group of patients with HIV without arthralgias and 385.5 F 170.3 in the group of patients with arthralgia, without significant correlation between CD4 count or viral load and arthralgias. Su2.02. Quality Control of siRNA, Optimizing ItTs Transfection Efficiency and Monitoring CD4 Gene Silencing Effect with a Microfluidic Chip Device. T. Preckel, 1 C. Buhlmann, 1 M. Valer. 1 1 Liquid Phase Analysis, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, BW, Germany. Gene silencing with RNA interference (RNAi) is a new breakthrough technology with high potential for development of therapeutics. Here, the delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) into cells is of key importance in elucidating gene and protein function. Differing types of interfering RNAs and several methods of delivery into cell types exist. All require transfection optimization, as the efficiency of transfection can be affected by many factors. Furthermore, the selection of the best silencing sequence at optimized siRNA transfection conditions is based on the integrity and purity of siRNA, siRNA uptake and cell viability. Given the complexity of monitoring and optimizing these types of experiments a new tool is required that would allow for minimal sample and reagent consumption in a fast and easy to use format. We describe the use of a microfuidic chip-based system to quickly verify siRNA quality and to determine the optimal conditions for gene silencing experiments. First, RNA integrity and purity is assessed. Second, fluorescently labeled siRNA is used to optimize transfection parameters in mammalian cells. Life cell staining is performed on-chip reducing the overall analysis time for 6 samples to less than 50 minutes from harvesting the cells to final results with actual hands-on-time of less than 10 minutes. Transfection efficiency is measured as the percentage of cells with a strong siRNA uptake within the live cell population. Third, gene knockdown is measured with the same system. Here, staining the protein of interest, e.g. CD4, with fluorescently labeled antibodies demonstrates the downregulation of proteins after siRNA transfection. The gene silencing mechanism can also be verified in a given cell line by using a GFP-tag and cotransfecting the tagged protein and a Cy5 labeled siRNA against that protein. Successful silencing can be measured by reduced GFP expression within Cy5 positive cell population at different timepoints after transfection.
