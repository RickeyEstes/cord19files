Application of the reference standard, including the reference testing algorithm followed by physician panel over-read, resulted in classifying 25 (12.2%) patients as bacterial, 53 (25.9%) as viral and 127 (62.0%) as negative ( Table 2 ). The physician panel agreed with classification assigned by the algorithm for 203 (99.0%) patients. Two patients were reclassified by the physician panel as more likely bacterial infections. The first patient had a throat culture positive for heavy growth of Group A beta hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) and a PCT value of 0.09 ng/mL that was thought to more likely represent a bacterial infection in the presence of GABHS culture and a negative viral PCR panel, this was deemed more likely to be a bacterial infection. The second case demonstrated a negative microbiology testing but an elevated PCT of 0.14 ng/mL and elevated WBC count of 10.5 thousand cells/mcl ( Table 2 ). Among the 25 bacterial cases, 13 (52.0%) were microbiologically confirmed, while 12 were classified as bacterial based on biomarkers measurements ( Table 2) . Among the 53 viral cases, 50 (94.3%) were microbiologically confirmed. Of these 50 patients with a microbiologically-confirmed viral infection, 42 (83%) had PCT <0.1 ng/mL, 5 (10%) had PCT between 0.1 ng/mL and 0.25 ng/mL, and 3 (6%) had PCT ≥0.25 ng/mL. Overall, the most common pathogens were influenza (n = 33), parainfluenza (n = 9), and GABHS (n = 7). Study personnel enrolled 165 people as asymptomatic control subjects. Two (1.2%) of these subjects were excluded due to invalid FebriDx results, leaving 163 subjects for analysis. Effort was made to enroll a representative population however only a limited number of pediatric patients <18 years were included in this arm of the study. Demographics of the asymptomatic control subjects were similar to those in the URI population (Table 1) . FebriDx results were negative for 161 of the 163 asymptomatic control subjects (specificity: 99%; 95% CI: 96-100%). FebriDx resulted in 2 false positive tests (false positive rate: 1.2%; 95% CI: 0.1-4.4%), with 1 false positive viral result and 1 false positive bacterial result. The false positive FebriDx viral result was confirmed with the MxA ELISA test < 40 ng/ml. The FebriDx false positive bacterial result was also shown to be an accurate measurement with an elevated CRP ≥ 20 mg/L confirmed by the CRP ELISA testing. One additional patient had an elevated CRP but was FebriDx negative. All other MxA ELISA and CRP ELISA tests were within the normal range.
