Air pollution may affect males and females in different ways. Existing evidence on the gender difference in air pollution epidemiology is far from conclusive and the mechanisms are not yet clear (Clougherty, 2010) . This is because males and females are different in fundamental ways that can affect the pollution-mortality relationship, including time use, smoking, inner dermal absorption and lung function, and the availability of target organs (McCracken et al., 2007; Becklake and Kauffmann, 1999) . We explore the gender heterogeneity in HK and report the results separately for males and females in Table 3 . We find that the impacts of air pollution on males are generally larger and more statistically significant than females. A 10-point change in the API increases the male mortality rate by 2.22%, which is two times larger than its impact on females. In the literature, several other studies also find stronger air pollution effects on males (e.g., Pope III et al., 1995; Galizia and Kinney, 1999; Tanaka, 2015; Ebenstein et al., 2015; Cohen et al., 2017) . Next, we examine the air pollution effects by age group. Because the exact number of people in each age group is not available at the LTPUG level, we directly estimate the impacts of air pollution on the number of deaths with respect to different age groups. Figure 2 summarizes the results. In line with the previous studies, we find that the air pollution effect is statistically significant for the elderly group (age>60) (Chen et al., 2013) . Specifically, for people who are older than 60, a 10-point increase in API leads to an 8.41% increase in the total number of CVR deaths. The corresponding regression results are reported in Table 4 . Infants, children, and young adults do not die from air pollution in HK. Note that our finding that air pollution does not lead to more deaths in the infant and young children group differs from many previous studies (e.g., Chay and Greenstone, 2003a; Currie and Neidell, 2005; Currie, Neidell, and Schmieder, 2009; Currie and Walker, 2011; Greenstone and Hanna, 2014) , but is consistent with Colmer et al. (2019) , who find that although HK's bad air decreases the birth weights, it does not cause more infants deaths.
