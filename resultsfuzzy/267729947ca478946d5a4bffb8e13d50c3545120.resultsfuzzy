The real-time amplification by RT-LAMP assay was monitored through spectrophotometric analysis by recording the optical density at 400 nm every 6 s with the help of the Loopamp real-time turbidimeter. Besides,the LAMP products can be detected based on color change. The color of the reaction mixture turned green in the presence of LAMP amplification, while the color remained orange in negative amplification tubes. RT-LAMP products were 2-fold serial diluted, and then observed electrophoresed. Because the amount of amplification products is very large, aerosols will be formed when open the reaction tube cover and will pollute the environment. It is not recommended to open the cover and observe results by electrophoresis. Electrophoresis was not used as a way to judge results no matter when, and here, we All rights reserved.
