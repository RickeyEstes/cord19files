The ϩ1 insertion found at nt 3732 of the cDNA clones was corrected in pCTV9 and pCTV-⌬Cla by exchanging a , and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The ORFs (boxes) with their numbers and corresponding translation products are also indicated. HSP70h, HSP70 homolog; CPm, minor coat protein; CP, major coat protein; (2/11), fusion of ORFs 2 and 11 with the deletion of internal sequence. The fortuitous frameshift found at nt 3732 (nt in bold) in CTV9 (a) and CTV-⌬Cla (c) was corrected in CTV9R (b) and CTV-⌬ClaR (d). (B) Northern blot hybridization analysis of total RNA isolated from protoplasts transfected with CTV9 (a), CTV9R (b), CTV-⌬Cla (c), and CTV-⌬ClaR (d) at 3 and 4 days postinoculation (dpi). The position of genomic and subgenomic (sg) RNAs corresponding to ORFs 2-11 are indicated by arrowheads and arrows, respectively. The blots were hybridized with 3Ј 900-nt positive-stranded RNA-specific digoxigenin-labeled probe. RT-PCR amplified product between the unique NcoI (nt 3685) and Bsu36I (nt 4430) restriction endonuclease sites creating pCTV9R and pCTV-⌬ClaR (Fig. 1A) . Replication of the full-length and replicon transcripts from the original and corrected cDNA clones was compared in N. benthamiana protoplasts. The RNA transcripts from the repaired clones accumulated genomic and sgRNAs about 30 to 40fold more than those from the original cDNAs (Fig. 1B , compare a and b, and c and d). We then examined the number of protoplasts infected in the presence or absence of a frameshift mutation by introducing green flourescent protein (GFP) ORF into CTV using mutants CTV-GFP-p23 (with a ϩ1 insertion at nt 3732) and CTVR-GFP-p23 (no frameshift at nt 3732) (Fig. 3A ). The number of protoplasts infected with CTVR-GFP-p23 that exhibited fluorescence under UV light was approximately 18-to 30-fold more than those inoculated with CTV-GFP-p23 ( Fig. 3C) , again with the accumulation of approximately 30 to 40-fold more genomic and sgRNAs than those of CTV-GFP-p23 (Fig. 3B) . The original CTV clones were toxic to E. coli, resulting in substantially reduced colony sizes (Fig. 2 ). Bacteria transformed with the repaired clones pCTV9R or pCTV-⌬ClaR grew much slower than those containing the original clones, producing visible colonies only 3 days after transformation with ligation mixtures. However, E. coli transformed with purified plasmid DNAs of pCTV9R or pCTV-⌬ClaR produced visible colonies slightly earlier. The yields of plasmid DNA from E. coli strain JM109 harboring pCTV9 and pCTV9R after overnight growth in 2xYT liquid medium were 2.5-3.0 and 1.5-2.0 g of DNA per milliliter of culture, respectively, compared to 8 -10 g DNA per milliliter of culture for pTMV (Dawson et al., 1988) . Thus, although the original CTV clones with the frameshift mutation reduced the growth of E. coli and plasmid DNA yields, the correction of the ϩ1 insertion in pCTV9R further reduced the growth of E. coli to a level below the range of expectations for routine laboratory work. Although not quantified here, the degree of difficulty of ligating and isolating intact cDNA clones was proportionally increased with the increased toxicity of the repaired constructs.
