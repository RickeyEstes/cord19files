A total of 13,781,274 sequence reads were obtained through the RNA-Seq detection of the pooled duck feces sample. Of them, 22 sequence reads were homologous with IBV genes through the standalone BLAST search in the downloaded nucleotide database, indicating the existence of a CoV in the duck feces sample. The duck CoV was designated as DK/CH/ZJ2012 and abbreviated as DK2012-CoV below. These 22 sequences reads formed six contigs corresponding to the viral 1b gene, as showed by Figure 1 . Totally, the six contigs were 1,626 bp in length, and harbored 15.70% different nucleotide residues compared to the corresponding sequences of the unique duck CoV, DK/CH/HN/ZZ2004 (abbreviated as DK2004-CoV below), in GenBank (Access No. JF699752).
