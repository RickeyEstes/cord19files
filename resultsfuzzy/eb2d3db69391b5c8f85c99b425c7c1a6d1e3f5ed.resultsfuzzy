Normal values of plasma protein in healthy animals are given in the Table 1 . Age is probably the most important factor which has to be taken into account when evaluating the results : newborn and very young animals may have values up to 60% lower, between 3 Table 1 . Normal values of plasma protein in healthy animals (in g/100 ml) (Schalm et al. [9] ). Hypergammaglobulinemia is usually suggested when the gammaglobulin exceeds 2.0 g/100 ml serum and hypogammaglobulinemia when it is below 0.5 g/100 ml serum. However, these values have to be applied cautiously. Natural hypogammaglobulinemia appears in newborns of all domestic animals [24] . In absolute values, even postcolostral sera may be at the low "normal" level of gammaglobulin. Decreased gammaglobulin levels were noticed in many physiologic and pathologic conditions. In cows, for instance, decrease of beta 2-and gamma globulins was noticed before parturition [25] . Also, larger blood loss will lead to lower absolute values of gammaglobulins. Hypogammaglobulinemia appears in many cases of immunodeficiencies, for instance, in Arabian horses [26] , in colostrum deprived animals or animals with failure of absorption of colostral immunoglobulins [27] . On the other hand, it has to be emphasized that some young immunodeficient animals need not be hypogammaglobulinemic, if they absorb a high level of colostral gammaglobulins. Because the IgM class of immunoglobulins has substantially shorter halflife than IgG class (approximately by 2/3), and because it is absorbed in smaller amounts from the colostrum, colostral IgM disappears from the blood circulation sooner. Its subnormal levels are used as an indicator of immunodeficiency in young animals, in which the levels of circulating IgG may be normal due to the persistence of absorbed colostral IgG. Thus, these IgM deficiencies may be detected by the last three mentioned tests; i.e. radial immunodiffusion, rocket or crossed immunoelectrophoresis, but not by zinc sulfate precipitation or glutaraldehyde coagulation. Most infectious diseases, chronic infections in particular, will lead to hypergammaglobulinemias [28] (Fig. 8 ). Very high levels of gammaglobulins (over 25°~ of total protein) are, for instance, present in cattle naturally infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus [29] , in cats with feline infectious peritonitis [30] , in minks with Aleutian disease [31, 32] and other infections. An extraordinary increase in beta2-and gammaglobulins (up to over 50To of total serum protein) is found in cases of tumors of lymphoid cells causing macroglobulinemia [33] or multiple myeloma [34] , respectively. For a veterinary clinician, hypogammaglobulinemia in colostrum-fed young animals and hypergammaglobulinemia in animals with no apparent infectious diseases should be of major concern. Hypogammaglobulinemia in young animals may indicate immunodeficiency, or failure of passive transfer of colostral antibodies. Hypergammaglobulinemia without concurrent infection may indicate myeloma or autoimmune disorders. All of the above mentioned conditions have guarded on poor prognosis. On the other hand, hypergammaglobulinemia associated with infectious diseases is an important defense feature and will disappear when the infectious agent is eliminated, thus it is a favorable feature. The immunoglobulin concentrations in the serum, colostrum and milk were summarized recently [35] . In general, there are variations in the reported level of immunoglublins due to the species and age, but also due to the variation of techniques and the quality of the reference standards. IgG shows the highest immunoglobulin concentration in the serum and has 2 to 4 subclasses in various species. 1"he reported levels of IgG in clinically healthy horses and dogs ranges from around 500 to over 1700 mg/100 ml, whereas that for the ruminants and pig generally exceeds 1700 up to over 2500 mg/100 ml. On the other hand chicken has only 300 to 700 mg/ml reported. IgM levels are higher than IgA levels in ruminants (150 up to 400mg/100 ml) and chicken (230-250 mg/ml), slightly higher in the dog (120-250 mg/100 ml), and about the same as IgA levels in the horse (80-200 mg/100ml) and pig (100-500 ml). IgA levels are the lowest in ruminants (10-50 mg/100 ml) and chicken (30-60 mg/100 ml) and slightly higher in the pig and horse (50-500 mg/100 ml) [35] . The hemolytic complement levels in CH50 units per ml of serum in clinically healthy adult animals are summarized in Table 2 . Horse serum has the lowest detectable level of hemolytic complement even under optimal conditions, probably due to a quick conversion of the C3b into C3d sites, which favors more conglutination than lysis of red blood cells. Therefore the conglutinating complement titers in horse serum exceed considerably the hemolytic titers. Bovine or other ruminant sera have a similar tendency when tested with sheep erythrocytes, but not when tested with guinea pig or rabbit erythrocytes. Horse, goat, sheep and chicken sera give low hemolytic titers, though they are highly active in complement mediated bactericidal activity [48, 49] . Only results of testing done under completely identical serum handling and test conditions may be compared with each other. The best control is to run a standard serum reference sample kept frozen at -70°C or lower temperature in small aliquots simultaneously with each series of sera from clinical patients. The titers will be usually slightly lower with samples frozen and once defrosted than in fresh samples. Twice frozen and defrosted samples should not be used for testing. Hypocomplementemia is suggested in samples in which the CH50 units are 50% or less of the lowest level detected in clinically healthy animals. Physiological hypocomplementemia is present in newborn animals [44, 50] . Their level of complement reaches the level of adult animals within weeks to months. Pathological hypocomplementemia may be caused by infections, automimmune diseases or inherited defects in complement component production or function [37, 51] . The clinical meaning of complement levels higher than in "normal" healthy animals is not clear. Testing of individual components of the complement system has not been done in clinical patients in veterinary medicine and no interpretation is available. The values detected in clinically healthy animals were published [47] . The defects of individual components production or function in man either caused no clinical symptoms or were associated with various infections [37, 51] . Epinephrine stimulation fails to induce a 45%o or greater increase in peripheral blood neutrophils in patients with "lazy leukocyte syndrome" [61] described only in man. Nitroblue tetrazolium is oxidized to formazan in more than 30% neutrophils in healthy individuals but decreased in children with chronic granulomatous disease (CHGD) [57] . The digestion/ingestion (D/I) index for nitroblue tetrazolium is over 2.5 in normal healthy man and was in our laboratory with bovine and canine polymorphonuclears. A decreased D/I index was detected in children with CHGD [56] and in dogs with severe chronic skin infections tested in our laboratory. These dogs might have had a defect similar to CHGD prior to their skin conditions. The preliminary results of phagocyte testing in domestic animals are promising [54] and may lead to the description of immunodeficiences not yet recognized in veterinary medicine. The potential of lymphocyte transformation test results has not been fully appreciated. The test has to be done in a relatively complex set up with various doses and kinds of mitogens and with additions of various sera to give useful results [62] . For the correct evaluation of results both the background counts per minute (CPM) of unstimulated lymphocytes and the stimulation index or CPM of stimulated lymphocytes must be taken into account. We found the background CPM in clinically healthy dogs varying in considerably smaller range (100-400) than in cattle or horses (200 to over 2000) . A mistake would be made by reporting only stimulation indices (i.e. reciprocal of CPM of stimulated cells divided by CPM of unstimulated cells), as well as by reporting only the CPM of stimulated cells. The stimulation indices may be decreased either by decreasing the stimulated cells' CPM and/or by increasing the background CPM. We have found decreased responsiveness of lyrnphocytes to the phytomitogens in numerous infectious and lymphoreticular diseases caused by either of the following: (1) the presence of serum immunosuppressive factors in the patient serum, (2) the decreased response of lymphocytes per se to the mitogens, or (3) the increased mitogenicity of lymphocytes due to unidentified serum factors in absence of phytomitogens [62] . Our preliminary data indicate that at least some infectious diseases are preceded by an increase in the background CPM of unstimulated lyrnphocytes, which may indicate recruitment of younger cellular forms from the depot of the hematopoietic tissues, and increased activity and/or numbers of helper or effector cells, all of which are affected by unspecified serum factors in the patient serum. Animals with most infections that we have tested developed in their serum factors suppressing the response of lympocytes to phytomitogens. The specific target cells for those suppressor factors varied with diseases and with the individual animals. Some viral infections (such as distemper) or chronic bacterial infections (such as brucellosis) affected the response of the lymphocytes per se, regardless of the addition of serum to the culture media. Lymphoproliferative tumours (such as bovine enzootic leucosis) caused substantial increase in the proliferation of unstimulated cells and even the serum from infected animals affected blastogenesis of cells from healthy animals. Our preliminary data indicated that the lymphocyte transformation test results in clinical immunology may detect an incubation period of infectious diseases, a pre-clinical stage of lymphoproliferative diseases, or immunodeficiency of the lymphocytes, which may be either inherited or acquired by infection, but always fatal to the animal. On the other hand, depressed responsiveness of the lymphocytes caused by serum suppressor factors during infections was prognostically favorable and disappeared in relatively short time with the elimination of the infection. Both the pattern of staining and the titer of the antibodies in patient serum are important. Peripheral staining (Fig. 10a) is typical for active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Diffuse staining (Fig. 10b) appears often with remission of SLE and less often in rheumatoid arthritis. Speckled and nucleolar staining is present in approximately 1/2 of the patients with progessive systemic sclerosis [74] . We suggest titers 40 and above on VERO cell cultures as positive, and titers of 20 as suspect. Lower titers are suggested positive if rodent tissue sections are used [73, 75] . The highest titer of antinuclear antibody detected in our laboratory reached 8000. Dogs with anti-nuclear antibodies at titers 160 and higher were usually severely ill. Peripheral staining with titers 5 on VERO cell cultures was detected in a number of clinically healthy animals in our laboratory. Any differential titer exceeding eight is suggested to be positive for rheumatoid factor [76] . Presence of the rheumatoid factor together with clinical symptoms is pathognomic for rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythemotosus with rheumatoid arthritis. Because the strength of the reaction depends on both the strength of the antiserum and the concentration of non-agglutinating antibodies on the cells, each laboratory has to determine the meaning of the various titers of the given antiserum. With commercially prepared antisera used in our laboratory, healthy animals had no detectable agglutination, animals with hemolytic diseases had either undetectable antibodies on their red blood cells (if the disease was not immunologically mediated) or varying titers from four up, but seldom exceeding 100. It must be emphasized that the titer is a reciprocal of the dilution of the anti-IgG or C3 antiserum which only reflects the density of autoantibodies on the red blood cells tested. The so-called "Coombs reagent", which should contain antibodies to both IgG and C3, is commercially prepared for testing dog red blood cells, but may give negative results in some cases when either anti-IgG or anti-C3 sera alone will give agglutination. Thus we recommend using all three types of antisera when autoimmune hemolytic anemia is highly suspected. In autoimmune hemolytic anemia usually only anti-IgG serum will agglutinate the cells, whereas in other drug-induced hemolytic anemias, usually only anti-C3 antiserum will agglutinate the cells. In anemias associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, both anti-IgG and anti-C3 antisera usually caused agglutination of patient's erythrocytes. On the other hand, in anemias associated with presence of "cold" agglutinins anti-C3, but not anti-IgG, will give agglutination of patient's red blood cells [82] . The detailed discussion on the interpretation of results is beyond the scope of this overview. In direct staining, one has to take into account the clinical stage and the development of the disease, the area of sample collection and the results of the control healthy animal samples treated simultaneously. In autoimmune glomerulonephritis due to autoantibodies to glomerular basement membrane, linear deposits of IgG and C3 (in approximately 1/3 of the patients) are the most common features [87] . In glomerulonephritis caused by immune complex diseases, the deposits of IgG and C3 are granular and usually on the epithelial side of the membrane [88] . In systemic lupus erythematosus both linear and granular deposits may be detected because both direct antiglomerular antibodies or immune complexes may develop [84] . In autoimmmune dermatologic diseases, direct immunoflorescent staining of the skin sections and indirect staining using the patient's serum may differentiate various types of skin disorders [89] [90] [91] . Direct staining of intercellular cement substance and presence of circulating antibodies to these substances (detectable by indirect immunofluorescence) is typical for pemphigus vulgaris. The basement membrane at the dermal-epidermal junction stains in patients with bullous pemphigoid disease, in which also circulating antibodies to the basement membrane are often detectable (Fig. 12) . Dermatitis herpetiformis is characterized by more intense staining of the basement membrane with FITC anti-IgA than FITC anti-IgG. The skin basement membranes also stained with FITC anti-lgG in systemic lupus erythematosus, but the staining is usually granular as compared to a linear staining in bullous pemphigoid disease. Neither in dermatitis herpetiformis nor in systemic [89] . Both direct and indirect immunofluorescence of dog skin was used in diagnosis of this disease in veterinary medicine [90, 91] . Autoantibodies to various other body tissues may be detected in diseases given in Table 3 .
