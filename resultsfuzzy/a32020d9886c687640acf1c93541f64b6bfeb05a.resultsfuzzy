Compared with control group, the lungs of HB-1/3.9and JXwn06-infected pigs showed an increased inflammatory cell population as early as day 3 PI. To quantify the immune cell sub-populations responding to viral infection, we determined the cell numbers of specific inflammatory cell populations in the lungs of infected pigs using specific stainings. Mast cells, mononuclear-macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophils accounted for the highest percentage of the total leukocytes following infection (Fig. 6 ). On days 3 to 5 PI, mast cell numbers in the lungs of JXwn06-and HB-1/3.9-infected pigs were significantly higher than those of control group (p < 0.05), while on day 5 PI, more mast cells were in the lungs of JXwn06-infected pigs compared to those of HB-1/3.9-infected group. On days 9 and 16 PI (moribund), no difference in mast cells in mast cells was showed between JXwn06-infected and control groups, but mast cell numbers in the lungs of HB-1/3.9-infected pigs were dramatically higher than those of control group (Fig. 7A ). There were extremely significant differences of mononuclear-macrophages numbers in the lungs of pigs between control and virus-infected group on day 3 PI to moribund (p < 0.01), while on day 5 PI to moribund, the number of mononuclear-macrophages in lungs of JXwn06-infected group was highly significantly different from those of HB-1/3.9-infected group (p < 0.01) (Fig. 7B) . Compared with control and HB-1/3.9-infected group, the number of neutrophils of JXwn06-infected pigs increased significantly from day 3 PI to moribund (p < 0.01), while from day 5 PI to moribund there was highly significant difference in nutrophils number between HB-1/3.9-infected and control groups (p < 0.01) (Fig. 7C) . As for pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, the concentrations of TNF-a, IL-1b and IL-8 in sera and TNF-a in the lungs were measured. As shown in Fig. 8 , the levels of TNF-a in the lungs of JXwn06-infected group significantly increased on day 3 PI to moribund (p < 0.01), and on day 5 PI there was highly significant difference between JXwn06-and HB-1/3.9-infected group (p < 0.01). On day moribund, significantly different levels of TNF-a in HB-1/3.9-infected group were detected compared to those of control group (p < 0.05). However, TNF-a level in sera also elevated from day 3 PI to moribund, but there was no significant alteration between control and virus infection group. Compared with control group, IL-8 level was dramatically increased in the sera of JXwn06-infected group from day 3 PI to moribund (p < 0.01), and there were remarkable and great differences between JXwn06-and HB-1/3.9-infected group on day 5 PI and moribund. Significant difference of IL-8 level between control and HB-1/3.9-infected group was detected on day moribund (p < 0.05). The concentration of IL-1b in sera of infected pigs increased from day 3 PI to moribund, but only on moribund, significant difference between control group and JXwn06-infected group could be observed (<0.01).
