Analysis of the results of RIDT for the detection of influenza A and B antigens showed that no false positive was identified (Specificity and Positive Predictive Value = 100%), but false negative results were encountered. Accordingly, the relationship between age, viral load and result of RIDTs was investigated. First, amongst 233 samples positive for H1N1sw based on RT-PCR techniques, the distribution of positive RIDTs in age groups was examined (see figure 6A ). This revealed an optimal sensitivity (,75%) in patients younger than 15 (p,0.001, compared with other age groups) and a poor sensitivity in patients over 45 (,25%). The relationship between viral load and RIDT result was then analysed (see figure 6B ). This revealed that samples with high viral loads (.10 million copies/mL) could be constantly detected by the BD RIDT. The sensitivity of the RIDT test decreased with viral load and no positive result was obtained for samples with viral loads ,0.11 million copies/mL. The relationship between viral load and results of RIDT was supported by statistical tests. Overall the strong relationship between positive RIDTs and high viral loads on the one hand, and the group of patients in the age group 0-15 on the other hand, strongly suggests that viral excretion is more pronounced in children, in accordance with previous results obtained for seasonal influenza [21, 22] .
