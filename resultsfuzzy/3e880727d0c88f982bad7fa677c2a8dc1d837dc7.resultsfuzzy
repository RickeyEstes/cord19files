Demographic characteristics. The questionnaire was distributed to 250 ED's healthcare providers, and 189 (75.6%) of them responded. The demographic characteristics of the study participants are shown in Table 1 . Nearly, two-thirds of the participants were below the age of 30 years. More than 85% of respondents were female. One hundred eleven (58.7%) participants had a clinical experience of more than 5 years, while 78 (41.3%) participants were found to have more than 3 years of clinical service at the tertiary care hospital. Knowledge of disaster and emergency preparedness. The correct responses of knowledge towards disaster and emergency preparedness were considered as a total score, where the mean±standard deviation (SD) score was 6.2±2.5 ( Table 1) . Comparing the mean knowledge scale score of disaster and emergency preparedness with the demographic characteristics of the participants, it was found that participants with >5 years of total clinical experience had statistically significant (p=0.009) knowledge score 6.2±2.3 which was even higher as compared to participants with ≤5 years 5.5±2.5. Moreover, participants with >3 years of clinical service at the tertiary care hospital had significantly higher knowledge score compared to participants with ≤3 years 7.1±1.5 versus 5.7±2.4; p=0.015). Attitudes towards disaster and emergency preparedness. Table 2 demonstrates participants agreement regarding disaster and emergency preparedness. Around 12 (6.3%) participants were not interested in being aware of the emergency (disaster) operational plans, and approximately 21 (11%) agreed that disaster management and planning is for a few people in the hospital. Furthermore, 66 (34.9%) participants believed that disasters are unlikely to happen in their hospital. The complete consensus was obtained among Practices towards disaster and emergency preparedness. About 153 (81%) of the total participants reported the conduct of disaster drill at their hospital and nearly two-thirds indicated the periodic update of the Emergency operational (disaster) plan (EOP). Additionally, slightly over two-thirds of the participants reported about the ongoing training on disaster and emergency preparedness ( Table 3) . Familiarity levels towards dimension of EPIQ. The mean familiarity score by the dimension of EPIQ is presented in Table 4 . The Mean±SD score for the overall familiarity of the study participants with EPIQ scale was 3.2±1.3; which fell within the 'somewhat familiar' category to the dimension as identified by the EPIQ scale. The 3 highest Mean±SD familiarity scores for EPIQ were achieved by "Ethical issues in triage" 3.9±1.1, followed by "emergency preparedness terms and activities" 3.8±0.8, and "decontamination" 3.7±1.1. The dimension that attained the lowest Mean±SD familiarity score for EPIQ was "accessing critical resources and reporting" 3.1±1.1. Discussion. Emergency Department's physician and nurses are the upfront manpower staff in nornal situation; nonetheless, their responsibilities rise several folds during emergency and crisis at hospital sites. High efficacy and proper skills combined with factual capabilities are necessary to saving human lives and promoting their health in emergency situations. 2 We aim in this study to assess the ED physicians and nurses 'knowledge, attitude, practice, and familiarity regarding disaster and emergency preparedness. Disaster preparedness at a tertiary hospital ... Nofal et al Overall, physicians and nurses' revealed a satisfactory level of knowledge in disaster preparedness 6.2±2.5. Moreover, the mean knowledge scores were significantly different in relation to overall experience and service at the institution. Most of the participants expressed their positive attitude towards disaster management, while few (n=22; 34.9%) of them agreed that disasters are unlikely to happen in their hospital. The disaster committee may have to work on improving the attitude of ED staff to be realistic with an expectation that their hospital is ready to handle any disaster. Only 8 (12.7%) participants disagreed to the need of frequent disaster simulations in the hospital. The conduct of a drill in the ED may increase the knowledge and continually improve its practice in disaster preparedness. In the present study, participants were found to be satisfactorily familiar with an emergency, while they were less familiar towards incident command system and ethical issues in triage. Generally, physicians and nurses' familiarity with response activities/preparedness in the case of a large-scale emergency incident was found statistically significant, where 38.1% were "very familiar", 49.2% were "less familiar", and 12.7% were "not familiar". The study employed the EPIQ to assess the physicians and nurses' ED knowledge regarding disaster emergency preparedness. The results showed that physicians and nurses from the triage and basic first aid found to have better knowledge score. When asked certain questions such as antidotes to biological agents, physicians and nurses' scores were lower. The study points to the need to perform additional educational programs in disaster emergency preparedness regarding the familiarity with disaster emergency preparedness, the need for disaster emergency preparedness education, training is well acknowledged in the literature. Due to Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's geographical location and role to the oil field, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is prone to human-made and natural disaster without exception. 26 Several sorts of disasters in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are likely to occur, including both the naturally Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), earthquake and landslide, sand and storms, floods, and the human-made disasters (annual mass gathering during Hajj period, accidents related hazards in the oil sector). 26 However, despite the number of disasters that have already occurred, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia does not have a multi-sectoral state department endeavor that facilitates effective disaster health management. Instead, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia continues to take a traditional health approach about their response to emergencies and disasters. 27 The WHO recommends countries to prepare comprehensive disaster management plans which could be used to meet the challenges associated with lowest to the highest level of disaster. 2 A previous study by Ogedegbe et al, 28 also highlighted the importance of disaster preparedness training among healthcare providers. Another study by Corrigan et al, 25 assessing disaster preparedness in an Australian urban trauma center reported that out of 140 respondents, 83 participants (59.3%) were previously trained to handle disaster, 53 (37.9%) had attended drill for disaster simulation whereas, 18 (12.9%) had actually handled a disaster. The study further highlighted that these participants were more prepared to handle such situations as compared to the ones with no such disaster handling or disaster-related training or simulation experience. 25 A questionnaire survey conducted on practicing registered 174 (out of which 164 responded) nurses to explore Hong Kong nurses' disaster preparedness expressed their inadequacy in terms of disaster preparedness. Furthermore, they suggested to include disaster management training in their basic curriculum. 20 Furthermore, a cross-sectional study was conducted employing a self-administered survey to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practice nurses' (n=607) working in 4 tertiary hospitals and 2 secondary hospitals. The nurses reported average percentage scores in the knowledge (66.33%), attitudes (68.87%), and practice (67.60%), which indicated the need to develop and cultivate strategies to advance nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and practice. 12 Many studies from Kingdom of saudi Arabia have assessed the emergency or disaster preparedness among hospital staff. A recent observational cross-sectional survey study by Shalhoub et al, 19 identifying disaster preparedness in 13 private Riyadh hospitals reported 12 (92.3%) hospitals to cover both internal and external disasters, and they all had disaster preparedness available in every department of the hospital. Another study assessing the knowledge, role awareness and skills in 106 hospital emergency nurses reported from 4 public hospitals reported high awareness as 85.7% of participants were confident in terms of disaster handling. However, they were not trained for the same. 11 A study by Gundran et al, 29 also conducted a similar study including 91 participants. Most of the participants, 98.4% in the present study and 97.8% in the study by Gundran et al, 29 considered training necessary for all healthcare workers. About 97.8% (in contrast to 100% in the present study), expected management to have updated disaster plan. About 65% (in comparison with 34.9% individuals in the present study) of participants thought that disasters are unlikely to happen in their hospitals. 29 Saudi Med J 2018; Vol. 39 (11) www.smj.org.sa One of the limitations in this study that it is a corss-sectional study based on self-reported data (questionnaire), the filling of which may be affected by time constraint, stress, and other such factors. Other limitation that the study was conducted at a single tertiary care hospital. Clinical implications. The results of this study could be used as a guide for making a strategic plan directed at adopting measures for disaster and emergency preparedness that can improve the quality of health care services. Moreover, there is a need to plan, design, and develop educational programs to enhance the knowledge of the healthcare providers in handling disastrous events efficiently. A comprehensively written emergency preparedness curriculum may also assist in assessing the training needs of healthcare providers. Moreover, additional studies on larger sample size should be conducted to provide data related to the need for such training amongest all ED staff including paramadics. In conclusion, the present study concluded that the level of knowledge was satisfactory in healthcare providers with a neutral level of attitude, practice, and familiarity regarding disaster preparedness. Accordingly, incorporation of teaching courses (theories and practices) regarding disaster and emergency preparedness in ER staff curriculum is needed. In addition, future follow-up research studies are essential for capitalizing ED staff education and training in these critical areas applied to healthcare and community setting.
