Mean ± SD birth weight for all 30 calves was 27.6 ± 3.5 kg. Mean ± SD birth weight for the CL, CR and PL group was 30 ± 2.9, 27.8 ± 2.3 and 25.1 ± 3.6 kg, respectively. All calves had a serum IgG concentration of <196 mg/dL prior to feeding colostrum or colostrum replacer or administration of plasma. Mean colostral IgG concentration fed to the CL group was 66.1 g/L. Mean plasma volume and mean plasma IgG concentrations administered to the calves in the PL group were 753 ml and 2848.4 mg/dL, respectively. None of the calves in the PL group showed immediate transfusion reactions. All calves in the CL and CR group had adequate transfer of immunity (serum IgG concentrations >1000 mg/dL at 2 days of age). Median (interquartile range) serum IgG concentrations at 2 days of age for calves in the CL, CR and PL groups were 2377.5 (421.9), 2306 (475.2), and 669.3 (267.8), respectively. Only 1 calf in the PL group had serum IgG concentrations >1000 mg/dL. There was no difference in median serum IgG concentrations at 2 days between calves in the CL and CR groups (P = 0.565). Median serum IgG concentrations of calves in the PL group were lower than calves in both CL (P < 0.001) and CR (P < 0.001) groups. Using Eq. (1) and substituting for a mean weight of 25.1 kg, serum IgG concentration of 195 mg/dL prior to administration of plasma, mean plasma volume of 753 ml (25.1 kg × 30 ml/kg) administered, mean plasma IgG concentration of 2848.4 mg/kg, the expected serum IgG concentration at 2 days of age in the PL group was 1074.9 mg/dL. Morbidity events were recorded in 21 calves (70% with 20 diarrhea cases and 1 pneumonia case). Fourteen of the 21 morbidity cases in the calves required treatment with antibiotics and or oral rehydration electrolyte solutions. Six calves died during the 5-week period. Of the calves that died or were euthanized, 4 calves were from the PL group, 1 from the CL group and 1 from the CR group. Mortality in the 6 calves occurred during the first 12 days of life. Causes of mortality in the 6 calves included enteritis secondary to enterotoxigenic E. coli, rotavirus and Cryptosporidium in 4 calves, enterocolitis due to Clostridium perfringens in 1 calf and enterocolitis due to E. coli, rotavirus and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in 1 calf. Given that 1 calf tested positive for BVDV on necropsy, all remaining calves (24 calves) calves were tested for BVDV by immunohistochemistry on ear notch skin biopsy. All remaining calves tested negative for BVDV. Proportions of calves with failure of Birth weight was reported as mean ± SD. Mean colostrum IgG fed to the CR group was reported as g/L and grams of IgG in the CR group. Mean IgG concentrations transfused to the PL group was reported as mg/dL. Median serum IgG concentration was reported as median (interquartile range). Half-life of IgG was reported as days (95% CI). Where applicable, values with the same letter superscript within a given row are not different (P > 0.05). passive transfer between the CL and CR groups were not different (P = 1). Proportions of calves that died in the PL group were higher compared with the CL (P < 0.001) and CR (P < 0.001) groups. Mean ± SD weight for the remaining 24 calves at 5 weeks was 38.9 ± 9.3 kg with a daily average gain of 0.4 kg/day. Half-life (95% confidence interval) for colostral, plasma and colostrum replacer derived IgG was 28.5 (23.4, 36.5), 27.3 (16.6, 75.6) and 19.1 (15.7, 24.5) days, respectively. The half-life for the CL and PL was not different (P = 0.420). The half-life for the CL (P < 0.001) and PL (P < 0.001) groups was longer than that of the CR group. Summarized descriptive statistics results are represented in Table 1 . The decay curves generated for the 3 groups of calves are represented in Fig. 1 . The aim of this study was to compare serum half-life of IgG derived from colostrum or colostrum replacer and plasma. The main finding in this study demonstrated that half-life of colostral derived IgG was longer than colostrum replacer derived IgG. Although these study results suggest different timing when vaccinating colostrum or colostrum replacer fed dairy calves, the current studies did not evaluate specific pathogen immunoglobulins to common vaccinations in adult dairy cows and pre-weaned dairy calves. The specific immunoglobulins for pathogens to be considered in future studies include rotavirus, coronavirus, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine viral diarrhea, parainfluenza-3 and bovine respiratory syncytial viruses. While the specificity of the colostral-derived immunoglobulins is important to confer specific immunity, it should be noted that at birth calves have greater number of neutrophils compared to adult cattle (Rossi et al., 1979) . Primary and secondary lymphoid tissues of newborn calves are populated by immune cells and the circulatory B-lymphocytes can synthesize immunoglobulins following antigenic stimulation (Banks, 1982) . Thus passively acquired IgG are not the only immunoglobulins involved during conference of immune protection after birth; but cells from lymphoid tissues and neutrophils from circulation are also involved. Therefore lack of specificity does not necessarily result in occurrence of a morbidity event. It is important to note that the half-life of colostral derived IgG was longer than previously reported in other studies (Banks, 1982; Butler, 1983; Besser et al., 1988) . Previous studies reported IgG half-life of 20 days (Banks, 1982) , 17.9 days (Besser et al., 1988) , 9.6 days for IgG1 (Butler, 1983 ) and 17.7 days for IgG2 (Butler, 1983) in calves. While the age of the calves during determination of half-life was not stated in two of the studies (Banks, 1982; Butler, 1983) , serum collection in calves was performed until 10 days of age in the third study (Besser et al., 1988) . We chose to determine serum IgG half-life in calves reared up to 35 days of age based on previous studies indicating that antibodies to different bacterial and viral antigens were not produced or did not appear in serum until 14-30 days of age (Kerr, 1956; Lambert et al., 1969; Thorsen et al., 1969; Husband and Lascelles, 1975) . Thus, it can be assumed that the majority of immunologlobulins in the serum are colostral derived in calves aged up to 30 days. The difference in the duration of follow-up is a potential explanation for the difference in the serum IgG half-life determinations in the different studies. Majority of calves in the PL group were anticipated to achieve adequate transfer of immunoglobulins at 2 days of age based on Eq. (1) and recommended plasma transfusion rate, but only one calf achieved adequate transfer of immunoglobulins. In contrast, the CL and CR group achieved serum IgG consistent with adequate transfer of immunity. One explanation for this observation is possible; increased catabolism due to complement activation by IgG aggregates from the preparation process of the plasma (Lundblad and Londeree, 1988) . In contrast, absorption of orally delivered IgG occurs within the first 24-36 h of birth is a non-selective passive process through pinocytosis (Stott et al., 1979) . Thus, orally derived IgG may undergo catabolism through which intravenously derived IgG is catabolized. Intravenously derived immunoglobulins are resecreted into the gastrointestinal tract and excreted through the feces and urine (Besser et al., 1988) . Fecal or urinary IgG concentrations were not determined in this study to evaluate rate of excretion among groups. Future studies need to determine serum, fecal and urinary IgG concentrations in calves intravenously transfused with plasma at shorter intervals (for instance every 12 h) prior to 48 h of age in order to evaluate the catabolism of the immunoglobulins. Additionally, evaluation of activity of IgG prior to and after plasma transfusion is warranted. The study design in this study differs from previous studies (Besser et al., 1988; Jones et al., 2004) in several ways. In studies by Besser and others, calves only received variable volumes of colostrum followed by 2.0 ml of labeled sodium iodide intravenously with no group of calves receiving colostrum replacer or plasma. In studies by Jones and others fed colostrum was twice to calves while the colostrum replacer was bovine serum derived and the study design did not include a group of calves administered intravenous plasma. It should be noted that in clinical practice, plasma is used to supplement immunoglobulins and thus calves are more likely to have ingested insufficient or sufficient colostrum on presentation. In this study, the PL group only received plasma as the source of immunoglobulins. The results of this study indicate that plasma products with sufficient immunoglobulins may fail to achieve adequate immunity when administered in calves. Although the half-life of the PL was longer than the CR group, the 95% confidence for the half-life estimate is very wide indicating that the estimate is not precise. Thus it is difficult to recommend when to repeat plasma transfusions in clinical settings based on the results of this study.
