A total of 83 individuals were entered into the study, including 48 'cases' and 35 'healthy' individuals based on assessment at admission. Reclassification by a wildlife veterinarian (author; BJ) according to detailed examination of the admission notes resulted in five cases being assigned as 'healthy' , and six 'healthy' individuals being assigned as 'cases' . Further, one individual considered healthy on admission was unable to be assigned as it was in poor body condition, however did not have clinical signs of oculonasal discharge. The resultant numbers for testing according to the case definition were therefore 49 'cases' and 33 'healthy' individuals (Table 1) .
