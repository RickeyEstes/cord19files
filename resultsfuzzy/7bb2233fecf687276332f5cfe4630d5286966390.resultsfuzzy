Leaf punches were used to determine the pH and NaCl concentration parameters that were optimal for extraction of GRFT and minimal extraction of contaminating proteins. One dimensional SDS PAGE profiles showed the optimal extraction pH for GRFT to be pH 4.0. The addition of 100 mM NaCl showed minimal impact on the purity of GRFT in the small-scale samples, but from prior work it is understood that the addition of NaCl will improve purity as long as it is not deleterious to the protein of interest especially as scale is increased. Therefore all subsequent purifications used 100 mM sodium acetate and 300 mM NaCl pH4 as the extraction buffer. Analysis of the small scale protein extraction profiles by SDS-PAGE demonstrates little impact of temperature on the extract purity, but does show that GRFT maintains stability in temperatures ranging from 60 -80°C. GRFT's thermostability in heated extracts was further assessed in larger scale extractions and Figure 1 shows clearly the impact that heat has on contaminating proteins. Nearly all contaminating proteins aggregated at temperatures above 50°C (Figure 1 ), increasing the extract purity 30 -40% (Figure 1 ), while GRFT remains stable until the extract reaches 90°C. Figure 1 Removal of plant protein contaminants from GRFT Extract with Heat. Plants expressing GRFT through a TMV-based expression system were harvested at pH4 in sodium acetate buffer and the extract was divided into 7 aliquots. Each aliquot was incubated for 15 minutes at temperatures ranging from room temperature (24°C) to 90°C and centrifuged to remove any precipitant. Samples of the initial extract and all assessed temperatures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with coomassie staining. The initial extract contains multiple contaminating proteins, which remain after incubation at room temperature. Once the extracts are heated to at least 50°C the majority of contaminating proteins precipitate except for the target protein GRFT and the TMV coat protein. The composition of the extract remains similar with temperature treatments ranging from 50 -80°C, but at 90°C incubation nearly all proteins are precipitated. Table: Densitometry readings corresponding to SDS-PAGE shown in Figure 1 . The primary contaminating protein left in the GRFT extract after heating was the TMV CP. Therefore, methods for removing the TMV CP were examined. These included the addition of bentonite and/or MgCl 2 , as well as pH and temperature adjustments. The more acidic extracts pH 4.0 and pH 6.5 showed increased activity of bentonite and MgCl 2 for removal of CP relative to the pH 7.0, 8.0, or 9.0 extracts, as long as extracts were incubated at 4°C (Figure 2 ). The pH 6.5 extract in the presence of bentonite and MgCl 2 reduced TMV CP levels by~55% (Figure 2 ), but the pH 4.0 extract in the presence of bentonite and MgCl 2 reduced CP contamination by~75%. Therefore, pH 4.0 and incubation at 4°C was used in subsequent purification with bentonite and MgCl 2 , but the most effective concentrations of MgCl 2 and bentonite remained to be determined. Multiple concentrations of bentonite and MgCl 2 were investigated in pH 4.0 buffer to determine the optimal concentration for removal of TMV CP. Bentonite was added to GRFT extracts at a range of 0 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL and MgCl 2 was added in a range of 0 -0.1 M with each concentration tested in combination and separately to determine the most effective concentration to aggregate TMV. Figure 3 shows that 0.1 M MgCl 2 had a similar impact on TMV CP removal at all bentonite concentrations tested, with bentonite having a minimal impact on TMV levels in the absence of MgCl 2 . Removal of 75 -95% of TMV CP was observed with the addition of 0.1 M MgCl 2 ( Figure 3 ), but bentonite in the absence of MgCl 2 only removed 10 -30% of the CP contaminant. The addition of bentonite and MgCl 2 at their most effective concentrations, Figure 2 Effects of pH on the activity of MgCl 2 and bentonite to remove the TMV coat protein. Extracts were harvested in sodium acetate (pH 4-5) or tris (pH7-9) buffer depending on the desired pH range and were visualized using coomassie stained SDS-PAGE. Sample 1 shows the proteins in the initial extract and sample 2 represents the proteins after the extract is heated to 55°C and centrifuged. Sample 3 represents the extract after it was adjusted to its corresponding pH a) pH 4.0 and b) pH 9.0. Sample 3 extracts were centrifuged to remove additional precipitate and represented in sample 4. Samples 5-12 represent various temperature, bentonite, or MgCl 2 treatments of sample 4 performed in duplicate. Table: Densitometry readings of SDS-PAGE represented in Figure 2 with values from three additional gels representing additional pH values that were explored (pH 6.5, 7.0, 8.0). The shaded area represents an extract condition achieving greater than 80% purity of GRFT. 10 mg/mL and 0.1 M, respectively, failed to be additive in their effects on TMV CP removal. The largest reduction in TMV CP levels was observed in the absence of bentonite with the addition of 0.1 M MgCl 2 , reducing TMV CP contamination by greater than 95% ( Figure 3 ). Bentonite has been proven to help in the clarification process of plant extracts and we continued to explore its impact on purification, but maintain that it has minimal impact on TMV CP removal from pH 4.0 extracts. Since the goal was to provide an alternative, less expensive, and less complex purification method the steps outlined thus far were implemented on a larger scale with fewer variables explored. GRFT was extracted and aliquoted after temperature treatment. GRFT extract aliquots were untreated (control) or treated with 0.1 M MgCl 2 and/or 10 mg/mL bentonite and all were incubated overnight at 4°C. Extracts were compared via SDS-PAGE with densitometry and again showed that the greatest reduction of TMV occurred in the 0.1 M MgCl 2 treatment group ( Figure 4A ). The pellets correlating to the specific treatments contained large amounts of TMV CP likely through forced aggregation and removal during centrifugation. Minimal loss of functional GRFT is observed in any of the treatment groups when compared via HIV-1 gp120 binding ELISAs ( Figure 4B ). When western blots targeting TMV CP were quantified by densitometry a reduction of 65% was observed in extracts treated with MgCl 2 , which is significantly decreased compared to the bentonite-only treated extract ( Figure 4C ). The table in Figure 4 shows GRFT purity in the four extracts ranges from 64 -82% with the TMV content of extracts treated with MgCl 2 reduced by as much as 66%. In an effort to achieve greater than 95% purity of GRFT a chromatography step was explored. Extracts were heated to 55°C and treated with MgCl 2 or MgCl 2 and bentonite overnight after which they were filtered through a 0.2 μm filter and loaded onto a Capto® MMC column. The Capto® MMC resin is a multimodal cation exchanger that does not require buffer exchange and was chosen to help minimize purification steps. After chromatography trace amounts of TMV can be seen in SDS gels and western blots in both the untreatedcontrol and the MgCl 2 treated samples with no TMV contamination observed in the MgCl 2 and bentonite treated extract ( Figure 5 ). Purity of all extracts after Capto MMC chromatography was greater than 97%, with the bentonite and MgCl 2 treatment group showing a purity of >99% by SDS-PAGE densitometry. The recovery levels and activity of the purified GRFT were assessed by gp120 binding ELISAs with very good recovery levels achieved in all treatments undergoing MMC chromatography. A minimum of 84.5% was recovered in the MgCl 2 treated extract after it was purified by chromatography and a maximum recovery of 92.1% was observed in the control extract that was purified by chromatography ( Table 1) . All extracts maintained an activity level at least 80% of GRFT purified by the previously published method [4] , with GRFT purified by MgCl 2 & bentonite having 100.8 ± 4.33% of the activity (Table 1 ). In summary, purification of GRFT from N. Utilizing the information yielded from small scale experiments GRFT was purified at an industrial pilot scale (>5 kg of plant material) in a GMP ready facility. At this scale it was necessary to replace all centrifugation steps with a filter press because of the impracticality of centrifugation at scale. Ten liters of extraction buffer was added to 5 kg of N. benthamiana and the tissue was ground to yield 11.4 L of initial extract containing 2599.73 mg of GRFT for a total of 519.9 mg of GRFT per kg of plant material ( Table 2 ). The extract was pH adjusted, heated, and filter pressed, which removed TMV CP and purified GRFT to >90% ( Figure 6 ). The remaining small protein contaminants were removed by overnight incubation with 10 mg/mL of bentonite and 0.1 M MgCl 2 and subsequent filter pressing. The extract underwent filter press and sterile filtration simultaneously and at this stage was >99% pure, and sterile with only minimal color. It should be noted that the purification process could be halted at this point depending on the application of the process and necessity for >99% pure colorless product. Capto® MMC chromatography was used to remove the color and simultaneously affect a buffer exchange into phosphate buffered saline pH7.4. Purity was maintained with greater than 99% purity of the final product and recovery of 66-72.25%, determined by densitometry of SDS-PAGE ( Figure 6 ) and gp120 ELISA respectively ( Table 2 ). Because of the GMP-ready nature of the purification scheme, endotoxin levels were assessed and found to be 0.20 EU/mL of final product with a GRFT concentration of 1.20 mg/mL, which should be sufficiently low depending on the dosage and administration route (Table 3 ). In summary, the purification method developed for GRFT herein provided a >99% pure product with >66% recovery while maintaining low endotoxin levels at industrial pilot scale and could be further scaled without modification to the process.
