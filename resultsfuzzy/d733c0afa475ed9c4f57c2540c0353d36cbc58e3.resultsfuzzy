Toroviruses and group A betacoronaviruses (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae; collectively referred to as nidoviruses throughout) are positive-strand RNA viruses of mammals. Their HEs share a common evolutionary origin with the influenza C hemagglutinin-esterase fusion protein (HEF) and were added to the respective virus proteomes relatively recently (de Groot, 2006; Zeng et al., 2008) . In the course of evolution, nidovirus HEs with novel SOAE substrate and lectin ligand specificities arose. In one lineage of rodent coronaviruses, HE ligand and substrate specificity shifted toward 4-O-Ac-Sias. Most nidovirus HEs, however, resemble influenza Cvirus HEF in that they bind to 9-O-Ac-Sias in a 9-O-acetyl-dependent fashion and function as sialate-9-O-acetylesterases (de Groot, 2006 ). Yet, even among this latter group of HEs, subtle but salient differences in SOAE substrate preference are apparent. For instance, porcine torovirus (PToV) HEs preferentially cleave 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias, while those of bovine toroviruses (BToVs) display a preference for 7,9-di-O-acetylated substrates Smits et al., 2005) . Also, the HEs of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and influenza C virus, while more promiscuous in SOAE substrate usage, do show a predilection for 7,9-di-or 9-mono-Oacetylated substrates, respectively ( Figure S2A ). All HEs readily cleave O-acetyl groups both from 5-N-Gc-and 5-N-Ac-Sias, with some HEs displaying a modest preference for the latter type ( Figure S2B ; for a summary of HE SOAE substrate specificities, see Figure S2C ). To investigate whether SOAE substrate preference for 7,9-di-or 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias reflects lectin ligand fine specificity, we expressed a comprehensive set of nidovirus HEs as Fc fusion proteins (Table S1 ) with the esterase inactivated through an active site Ser-to-Ala substitution (HEs with inactive SOAE are referred to as HE 0 throughout; enzymatically active HEs are referred to as HE + ).
