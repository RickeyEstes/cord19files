Due to their large sizes and high conformational flexibility, little is known about the structural organization and physical properties of long RNAs. Some of them, such as viral positive-sense ssRNA genomes, adopt compact conformations as part of their function and facilitate packaging into the confined space of icosahedral viral capsids (17) . Likewise, several lncRNAs, including HOTAIR and SRA, assume well-defined conformations with separate domains, capable of folding into compact structures upon addition of divalent cations (49, 50) . These independent domains interact with their binding partners via evolutionarily conserved protein-binding motifs (49) . To better understand the architecture of long RNA molecules, e.g., their overall compactness or extendedness, we explore the relation between predicted sizes, using either the MLD or R g obtained from Kramers theorem, respectively, and the experimentally determined hydrodynamic radii (R h ) for long RNAs, ranging from 600 to >9000 nucleotides in length. We have examined a wide range of biologically relevant RNAs, including messenger, long noncoding, viral, and ribosomal RNAs. To minimize nonspecific intermolecular interactions between RNA molecules, we employ extremely dilute solutions (low nanomolar concentrations) and low ionic strength (i.e., good solvent conditions for charged polymers), and measure sizes of RNA molecules by FCS. In contrast to other ensemble solution techniques (smallangle x-ray and light scattering, and analytical centrifugation), the dilute conditions minimize aggregation due to intermolecular basepairing, which has previously been shown to result in an overestimation of sizes (51) . Furthermore, we have also used FCS to examine compaction of individual RNA molecules in response to biologically relevant divalent (Mg 2þ ) and trivalent (spermidine, Sp 3þ ) cations. The latter conditions promote formation of tertiary structures (52, 53) . Table 1 summarizes calculated hMLDi values and measured hydrodynamic radii for a range of long RNA molecules examined by FCS. Due to the low RNA concentrations and ionic strength conditions used here (notably nonphysiological, by design), aggregation and tertiary structure formation are unlikely, so that the effects of branching due to secondary structure can be accentuated and be probed directly under close-to-isolated molecule (infinite-dilution) conditions. We note that while the measured R h broadly increases with the length, the rise significantly deviates from the monotonic behavior expected for the simple scaling laws (Eq. 1, Fig. 2 A) . This result suggests that linear polymer scaling laws (Eq. 1) are not appropriate to describe long ssRNA, which is an effectively branched polymer. Instead, essential coarse-grained features of their sequences need to be taken into account. To account for sequence variations, basepairing, and the resulting branching, we estimate branching patterns using the output of secondary structure algorithms (RNAfold) e The values are reported as average 5 SD computed from at least 10 measurements. Long RNA molecules were transcribed and 5 0 (or 3 0 ; see Materials and Methods) end-labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), purified and subsequently checked for integrity by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. S1) . In a few cases, quenching or aggregation affected or prevented determination of the diffusion correlation time. f Measured in 10 mM MgCl 2 in 20 mM MOPS-K þ , pH 7. g Measured in 1 mM spermidine in 20 mM MOPS-K þ , pH 7. h Computed by averaging over 100 predictions (5 SD). i Computed using Kramers theorem. and ensemble average over the low energy structures. The measured hydrodynamic radii are in good agreement with the theoretical estimates of the R g values based either on the MLD (Fig. 2 B, Eq. 3) or the Kramers theorem (Fig. 2 C) . This result is consistent with most RNA molecules adopting branched structures in which the MLD largely determines the overall size (41, 42) . This is illustrated by comparing the maximum ladder path of rotavirus segment 11 precursor (s11, Fig. 1 C) with that of MS2 phage genomic RNA (Fig. 1 D) . The experimentally determined secondary structure pattern of s11 is significantly less branched than that of the typical prediction for MS2. Furthermore, this is reflected in the relatively large MLD and hydrodynamic size of s11, comparable to that of Ef2 mRNA, which is three times the length. This demonstrates that the relatively simple MLD description can capture the essence of coarse-grained RNA structure, and yields quantitative predictions based on the RNA sequence alone. Further compaction of RNA molecules and the formation of tertiary structure require di-and polyvalent cations (Mg 2þ , spermidine 3þ , spermine 4þ ) and/or association with RNA-binding proteins (54) . As seen in Table 1 , upon addition of divalent (10 mM Mg 2þ ) or trivalent cations (1 mM spermidine, Sp 3þ ), the measured R h decreases for most RNAs, consistent with compaction driven by electrostatic screening and neutralization. Fig. 3 compares R h before and after the addition of multivalent cations. The R h values cluster along the line with the slope between 0.7 and 0.8, indicating that on average the RNAs undergo a 20-25% size compaction compared to their original R h . As a consequence, the proportionality between R h and predicted size holds for most of the RNAs even after addition of polyvalent cations. However, there are few RNAs that either fail to further compact (RV s11 No. 1 and Ef2 mRNA No. 6 in Fig. 3 , where the R h change is insignificant at confidence level 90%) or the compaction is more prominent in comparison with other RNAs examined (HCV, No. 19 in Fig. 3 , where the R h differs significantly from the expected value at confidence level 99%). The quantitative relation between the experimental R h and R g predicted either from hMLDi or the Kramers theorem indicates that modeling the RNA as an ideal branched polymer constitutes a good starting point for predicting the overall size of long RNAs. However, there are several notable discrepancies between the predicted and measured sizes. One limitation of our approach is that computational predictions may yield an incorrect structure and hence an MLD that differs from that of the experimentally determined secondary structure, as in the case of STMV RNA (21, 55) . Such failures of the computational approach are more likely (Table 1) and coloring is according to the class (black, single-stranded precursors of dsRNA viral genomes; red, genomes of ssRNA viruses; blue, cellular mRNAs; green, ribosomal RNA; and cyan, long noncoding RNAs. Lines and curves represent best fits to different linear polymer models: charged (red, Eq. 1, n ¼ 1, reduced c 2 ¼ 35.85), simple Gaussian coil (blue, Eq. 1, n ¼ 0.5, reduced c 2 ¼ 13.37), and a self-avoiding coil (green, Eq. 1, n ¼ 0.59, reduced c 2 ¼ 14.85).

This situation can be remedied by estimating MLD from structure-probing data, which should improve the accuracy of RNA size calculations. This is demonstrated for s11 RNA for which the probingderived MLD exp is slightly lower than the computed average hMLDi (Fig. 1 C, compare hMLDi and MLD exp ) , yielding a R g~9 .3 value that agrees better with the experimental R h (i.e., point No. 1 would be closer to the trend line in Fig. 2 B) . On the other hand, when secondary structure determination (or prediction) is ambiguous, experimental size measurements by FCS can be used for selecting those structures with MLDs compatible with the experimentally determined hydrodynamic radii. In addition to the MLD prediction limitations, HCV RNA is compacted twofold in the presence of multivalent ions, i.e., to a much higher degree than other RNAs examined here (20-25% reduction), highlighting the importance of repulsive electrostatic interactions at low salt and formation of tertiary contacts stabilized by multivalent cations, not accounted for in our approach. Another case of underestimating the size is 16S rRNA, which is predicted to be more compact than experimentally observed (Fig. 2 , B and C, No. 7, R h~1 7.8 nm). This discrepancy likely reflects the presence of distinct domains within 16S rRNA that make the protein-free 16S rRNA relatively large (measured R g~1 1.4 nm). Only upon binding of multiple ribosomal proteins does it undergoes gradual compaction to its fully folded functional state (R g~7 nm) (56, 57) . Ef2 mRNA is an example of overestimated size (Fig. 2 , No. 6) and in this case tertiary contacts involving longrange interactions-not accounted for in our analysismay play important roles in maintaining its compactness. The observed lack of further compaction of Ef2 mRNA in the presence of multivalent cations is consistent with preformed stable intramolecular contacts present in this RNA (Fig. 3 , No. 6; Table 1 ). To further test the observed correlation between hMLDi and the experimental hydrodynamic radius, we generated a scrambled s11 RNA sequence, as described in Materials and Methods. This disrupted as much as 25% of the original base pairings in the experimentally probed secondary structure of s11 (see sequence in the Supporting Material), while maintaining a similar level of basepairing (only 2% reduction of overall base pairing, Table 1 ). Analysis of the scrambled RNA sequence yields a reduction of hMLDi and is reflected in a concomitant decrease (significant at 99% confidence level) of experimentally measured R h (Table 1 ; Fig. 2 , RNA No. 2). In this case the native, original fold of s11 RNA is an extended conformation while the scrambled sequence produces an ensemble of more branched and hence more compact species, further demonstrating the predictive power of the MLD approach. However, the Kramers theorem approach fails to predict this reduction, most likely due to assuming the same average phantom bond length between vertices (compare to Fig. 1, A and B) . Overall, the observed differences in compactness and extendedness of RNA molecules may reflect various biological functions they perform. While MS2 phage genomic and subgenomic ssRNAs (Nos. 9, 10, and 15 in Fig. 2 A) are comparable in length to lncRNAs (Nos. 8 and 11) and the protein-free ribosomal RNA (No. 12), they appear to be smaller in size (see 2-4 kb region in Fig. 2 A) . However, the Ef2 mRNA transcript (No. 6 ) is yet even more compact than the comparatively short viral RNAs (RNAs No. 4, 5, and 13 in Fig. 2 A) , suggesting that although there might be evolutionary pressure on genomes of ssRNA viruses to fold into more compact structures (17) , there is a number of exceptions, including more extended viral RNAs (21) and compact mRNAs. Moreover, relative size of viral RNAs may also reflect replication strategies and genome packaging mechanisms employed by viruses. For example, viruses with segmented RNA genomes may preferentially A B FIGURE 3 Hydrodynamic size reduction in the presence of Mg 2þ (A) or spermidine Sp 3þ (B). Coloring and numbering scheme is as in Fig. 2 . R h values that were compromised by either quenching or possible aggregation (RV s1 and s11 in Table 1 ) in the presence of multivalent cations were omitted from the plot. Linear regression lines with slopes 0.77 5 0.03, Pearson's r ¼ 0.89 for Mg 2þ and 0.73 5 0.04, and Pearson's r ¼ 0.87 for Sp 3þ , respectively, are shown.

Remarkably, despite significant differences in the architectures of various long RNAs, we find that their sizes (hydrodynamic radii) can be estimated using coarse-grained theoretical predictions, even in the presence of multivalent ions stabilizing tertiary contacts. Because the theoretical approaches used here treat exclusively the branching patterns associated with the RNA secondary structures, our results provide experimental evidence that the overall sizes of long RNAs are determined predominantly by their secondary structure branching patterns (17) . The effects of di-and polyvalent cations are more prominent for smaller RNAs, such as riboswitches and ribozymes, which adopt compact and unique tertiary structures in the presence of Mg 2þ (59) via formation of specific tertiary contacts. Due to the heterogeneity of secondary structures in long RNAs, such specific contacts would be harder to achieve, while also explaining why long RNAs often require auxiliary proteins to guide their folding into a unique structure. This feature of RNA is likely to be the result of a limited repertoire of interactions offered by the four nucleobases and points to a fundamental limitation of RNA as a complex biopolymer when compared to proteins. We find that even relatively simple theoretical calculations based on ensembles of predicted secondary structures and MLD averaging correlate well with the experimental measurements for a diverse set of long RNA molecules, allowing our approach to account for the sizes and compactness of broad classes of ssRNAs.
