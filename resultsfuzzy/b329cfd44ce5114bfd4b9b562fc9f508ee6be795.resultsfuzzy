This study designed and evaluated a high volume (1200 L per minute) portable microbial sampler by impacting biological particles directly onto the agar plate for sampling bioaerosols. The physical performances of the HighBioTrap sampler were characterized by using aerosolized PS particles and further tested by two different aerosolized bacterial particles and indoor air particles. The biological performances of the HighBioTrap sampler were tested when sampling both culturable bacterial and fungal aerosols in outdoor and indoor environments. The cultural counts were compared with those that were obtained using the BioStage sampler. In addition, the bacterial community diversities were investigated by using high throughout sequencing to identify the impaction stress of two samplers and their ability of preserving the microbial aerosol culturability. Fig. 3 showed physical collection efficiency determined by laboratory tests when sampling aerosolized PS particles, bacterial aerosols (B. subtilis var. niger and P. fluorescens) as well as indoor air particles. As observed in Fig. 3 , the cut-off size when sampling aerosolized PS particles is about 2 µm, which is slightly bigger than the SAS super 180, MAS-100, RCS High Flow, Millipore Air Tester while much smaller than SMA MicroPortable, BioCulture, and Microflow as shown in the Table 1. The HighBioTrap was proposed to collect the most of airborne biological particles, which covers a larger size range from 0.3 µm to several tens of micrometers. Also, the HighBioTrap sampler was designed to have a high flow rate (> 1000 L/min) to substantially reduce the sampling time. The wider nozzle diameter and longer impaction distance (as shown in Table 1 ) were adopted in the sampler design in achieving portable and high flow rate sampling strategy. This, however, resulted in a relatively large cutoff size of about 2 µm compared to 0.65 µm for the BioStage impactor. But for most of natural bacteria, the aerodynamic size was larger than 3 µm (Shaffer & Lighthart, 1997) due to aggregation or adhesion to large non-biological particles, which implies acceptable collection efficiency of the HighBioTrap for environmental sampling. As the particle size increased, the collection efficiency increased up to 70% at about 3 µm but remained the same at 5 µm. The variances of collection efficiencies were getting larger as the particle size getting lager. When preparing PS suspension used for aerosolization, the particle suspension of each size is diluted to the same concentration of about 10 8 particles/mL and mixed well, while the lager particles are harder to be aerosolized by the nebulizer. Therefore, the concentration of large particles was lower than the smaller particles as identified by the OPC (not listed here), which resulted in the different variances of collection efficiencies of different particle sizes. The curve seems not to be very sharp as that of the Andersen type impactors discussed by Ranz and Wong (1952) , and this also implies poorer cut-off characteristics. The relative flat physical collection efficiency curve was mainly caused by the higher Reynolds number of the air flow in the jet. Previously, the impactors are designed to have a low volume of about several tens of liters per minute and maintain laminar motion as the Reynolds numbers were recommended to be kept from 500 to 3000 (Marple & Willeke, 1976) . While the HighBioTrap is designed to have an extreme high flow rate and the air flow is at fierce turbulence with a Reynolds number of 33,953, which would lead to some loss of bigger particles. The Reynolds number effect was previously studied on the basis of potential flow theory (Davies & Aylward, 1951) . However, when sampling indoor aerosol particles, the collection efficiencies were observed to be slightly lower as shown in Fig. 3 compared to outdoor air sampling. The physical performances of sampling B. subtilis and P. fluorescens were also determined by aerosolizing their pure bacteria suspensions as shown in Fig. 3 . For these two bacterial aerosols, the collection efficiencies are about 20% and 10%, respectively, which are lower than the performances of the RCS High Flow and MAS-100 but comparable to other portable samplers (such as Microflow, SMA MicroPortable, Millipore Air Tester, SAS Super 180, BioCulture; these samplers have low sampling flow rates of less than 200 L/min) as investigated previously by Yao and Mainelis (2007) . Nonetheless, as a result of the 10 times higher flow rate than that of RCS High Flow and 50 times than that of the BioStage, the HighBioTrap can collect much more bacteria when sampling for the same time. The physical collection efficiency is related to the sampler's ability to obtain a representative aerosol sample, while the biological efficiency reveals its ability to preserve the culturability of the collected microbes. Besides, the interplay of mechanical characteristics and environmental factors determines the overall collection performance of a sampler (Xu & Yao, 2011) . The biological collection efficiencies of the HighBioTrap sampler was assessed by field tests in this study by sampling culturable bacterial and fungal aerosols in both indoor and outdoor environments. The number of airborne culturable bacteria and fungi determined with the test and reference sampler in indoor and outdoor locations are presented in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. For the outdoor sampling site, the mean count of airborne culturable bacteria as determined by the HighBioTrap was 77 CFU (77 CFU per minute) by sampling 1 min to 153 CFU (31 CFU per minute) by sampling 5 min, which is significantly higher than that determined by the reference sampler, 17-37 CFU (17 to 8 CFU per minute) from sampling 1-5 min (p < 0.001). Although the cut-off size of the HighBioTrap is larger than that of BioStage as described above, the 42 times higher flow rate of the HighBioTrap, compared to the BioStage, ensures more bacteria collected by the same sampling time and the CFU count ratio is about 300-450%. However, the biological efficiency of the HighBioTrap identified by sampling the same volume air is lower than that of the reference sampler. As shown in Fig. 4 , when sampling 500 L air in outdoor sampling site (the 4th floor lab room window site), the HighBioTrap sampler presented about 14 CFU on average, which is significantly lower than 41 CFU identified by the BioStage (p < 0.001). This result also can be obtained from the sampling tests of the same time by converting the CFU count to the bacteria concentration using the Eq. (4) described in "Materials and Methods" section (for the BioStage, the Fig. 4 . Comparison of bacterial aerosol collection performances between the HighBioTrap and the BioStage in different environments with different sampling times and volumes. The data represent averages from no fewer than three repeats and error bars stand for the standard deviation. "***" indicates a statistically significant difference between the measurements by two samplers. concentration result is factor-corrected, while not for the HighBioTrap). The BioStage impactor consistently reported higher concentrations than the HighBioTrap when sampling airborne bacteria. The differences between the bacterial concentrations measured by the samplers were also analyzed by the paired t-tests. All of their p-values were below 0.001, indicating that there was a statistically significant difference between the concentrations measured by the BioStage and the HighBioTrap under all sampling time settings. The relative collection efficiency identified by the Eq. (5) described in "Materials and Methods" section ranged from 7.2% to 10.7%. Based on the measurements of the both samplers, the sampling time was found to have a significant influence on sampling performance (CFU captured per minute) for both methods (ANVOA test, p < 0.001). The shortest sampling time was found to present highest bacterial CFU count about 17 CFU/minute by the BioStage and 77 CFU/minute by the HighBioTrap, while the longest sampling time reported the lowest CFU count, about 8 CFU/minute by the BioStage and 31 CFU/minute by the HighBioTrap. An increase in sampling time would introduce a stronger desiccation effect on the microorganisms already collected. The amount of desiccation can be quantified as the volume of air received over per unit area of collection surface per unit time by following equation as presented previously by Zhen et al. (2009)  Two samplers used the same ager plate but operated at different flow rates. As a result, when sampling for the same time, the HighBioTrap was estimated to have a 42 times higher desiccation factor than that of BioStage impactor. In addition, the longer sampling time will introduce severe particle bounce, because the desiccation made the collection surface drier and harder during the sampling process. The impaction velocity of the BioStage is higher than that of the HighBioTrap, which caused microbial aerosol embedding. In addition, the relative collection efficiency determined by 500 L air sampling test was about 35.0%, significantly improved compared to that obtained using the same time sampling test (ANOVA test, p = 0.036). This is due to the fact that when sampling 500 L, the BioStage took 17.6 min which posed sustained desiccation stress on the agar plate, while the HighBioTrap sampler used only 25 s which thus caused quick desiccation (because of shorter time) and less particle bounce. Nonetheless, the desiccation and particle bounce effects might partly contribute to the lower collection efficiency of the HighBioTrap sampler. Similar results were obtained when sampling indoor bacterial aerosols. The HighBioTrap reported higher bacteria count but lower bacterial concentration than the BioStage at every sampling time setting, and the sampling time played an important role in collection efficiency for both methods. The relative collection efficiencies were 4.72-8.25% determined by equal time sampling, and 7.14% determined by equal volume sampling test. The results were lower than those when sampling outdoor bacterial aerosols (paired t-test, p = 0.0111 and 0.000839). This result indicated that the HighBioTrap had relative higher efficiency when sampling particles in outdoor environments. On one hand, the microorganisms in outdoor environment appear in aggregation or adhere to large nonbiological particles as discussed above, which improved the actual collection efficiencies. On the other hand, the HighBioTrap sampler is designed to have a flow rate of 1200 l per minute, corresponding to impaction velocity of ∼10.2 m/s, which makes it more tolerant to the outdoor air conditions, e.g., wind speed and atmospheric movement speed in vertical direction. While the BioStage with the standard inlet flow of ∼0.9 m/s, which can be easily affected by the environmental air, with a typical wind velocity of 100-300 cm/s. When sampling indoor bacterial aerosols, 4 min sampling yielded the highest CFU count for the HighBioTrap, and 3 min sampling reported the highest CFU count for the BioStage, which indicated that the desiccation and particle bounce significantly affected the collection of indoor bacteria. This might be due to the fact that indoor microorganisms presented smaller size distribution and also high humidity levels leading to less desiccation. Similar to the bacterial sampling performance, the fungal sampling performances under different conditions were measured by the HighBioTrap and the BioStage impactor, and the results are presented in Fig. 5 . The HighBioTrap sampler reported higher fungal count per minute but lower fungal concentration than the BioStage both in indoor and outdoor environments, except sampling 3 and 5 min indoors (paired t-test, p < 0.001). The sampling time had a great influence on collection efficiency for both methods (ANOVA ttest, p < 0.001) for that the particle bounce and desiccation effect increased with the prolonged sampling time. The relative fungal collection efficiencies were 5.4-8.4% (equal-time-test) and 14.8% (equal-volume-test) at outdoor sampling site, and 1.1-5.4% (equaltime-test) and 17.8% (equal-volume-test) at indoor sampling site. The paired t-test showed that the collection efficiencies between outdoor and indoor determined by equal-time-test is statistically significantly different (paired t-test, p = 0.00114) but the difference of collection efficiency between outdoor and indoor determined by equal-volume-test is not statistically significant (ANOVA test, p=0.46). This might be due to the fact that the indoor fungi are less resistant to the desiccation stress (Xu & Yao, 2011) and the HighBioTrap posed higher desiccation effects to the sample than the BioStage in a same-time sampling process. As described above, the collection efficiency of a sampler is determined by its physical performance as well as other factors, such as impaction stress, embedding, and desiccation. These factors together affect the culturable bioaerosol diversity obtained by the sampler. The sampler of higher biological collection efficiency might obtain air sample of lower species diversity, because it may collect most of the dominant species while caused stronger culturability damages (Xu & Yao, 2011) . Also, the environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, solar radiation et al., will affect the concentration and species composition of bioaerosols. In terms of our experiments, the comparison tests of two samplers were performed in the same time and environment, thus in any case the influences posed to two samplers were accordingly the same. In our study, the culturable bacterial diversities obtained by the HighBioTrap and reference sampler were determined by the high-throughput gene sequencings. The culturable bacterial species distributions in genus level of samples collected by the HighBioTrap and BioStage at outdoor and indoor environment were presented in Fig. 6 . The results from Fig. 6 indicate that sampler type and sampling time could result in different culturable bacterial aerosol diversity. Shannon index was widely used for estimating biological species diversity, and higher Shannon index presents higher species diversity. The calculation of the Shannon index can be accessed through the online database (http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Shannon). The Shannon index of the sample collected by the HighBioTrap sampler (5 min for 6 m 3 air, and 10 min for 12 m 3 air) and the BioStage (5 min for 141.5 L air and 10 min for 283 L air) are 3.35, 3.04, 1.60, and 1.52, respectively. For the HighBioTrap sampler, the culturable bacterial aerosol diversity obtained was higher than those obtained by the BioStage. Although, the higher desiccation effect limited the collection efficiency of the HighBioTrap for an extended sampling, high flow rate would lead to the collection of more microorganisms at the same time, which correspondingly increased the probability of the collection of less frequently occurring species. While for the BioStage, due to its higher sampling stress, e.g., higher impaction velocity (24 m/s) and higher embedding, the culturable bacterial diversity is relative lower, and some species lost the culturability or viability after the sampling process. As shown in the Fig. 6 , the predominant species of the sample collected by the HighBioTrap for 5 min are Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, while for the BioStage, the predominant species was only Bacillus (the top 15 species in genus level were listed in Table S1 ), the species which is more resistant to the environmental stress or impaction stress. Similar to the results obtained by the culture method, the sampling time is an important factor influencing the collection of bacterial aerosols for both methods. Despite that increasing collection time would result in more microorganisms collected by the samplers, an increase in sampling time would introduce a stronger desiccation and particle bounce effect on the microorganisms, which unfortunately reduced the diversity of the sample due to damages to those sensitive species. When sampling at the indoor site, the bacterial species obtained are different by two samplers. The Shannon index of the sample collected by the HighBioTrap (5 min for 6 m 3 air, and 10 for 12 m 3 air) and the BioStage (5 min for 141.5 L air and 10 min for 283 L air) are 2.24, 1.24, 2.59, and 2.68, respectively. This indicates when sampling indoor bacterial aerosols, the BioStage can collect more microorganisms and obtain higher bacterial diversity, which might be due to the increasing collection efficiency of the BioStage in the indoor environments as discussed above. This is also due to the dominance of smaller bacteria in indoor environments (Reponen, Willeke, Grinshpun, & Nevalainen, 2011) . As seen from Fig. 6(b) , when increasing the sampling time, Pseudomonas was shown to be collected more, which indicates the Pseudomonas species was dominant in the environment (the top 15 species in genus level were listed in Table S2 ). While for the BioStage, increasing sampling time caused the loss of Pseudomonas, which indicated the high sampling stress resulting from the long time sampling, e.g., the impaction injuries, of the BioStage. Although the BioStage impactor has higher physical collection efficiency, it causes damages to the cells being collected due to its high impaction velocity (24 m/s). The biological collection efficiency is a function of the samplers' physical collection efficiency, sampling stress, collection medium surface characteristics and also the target species. The sampler's physical collection efficiency is largely determined by the cutoff size, while the sampling stress includes impaction and desiccation. The collection medium surface determines the particle bounce and the microbial particle embedding, e.g., the agar plate. The target species is also an important factor to consider when selecting a sampler as sensitive microbes are more vulnerable to the sampling stress as discussed. The developed HighBioTrap has a very high sampling flow rate (1200 L/min) compared to the BioStage impactor (28.3 L/min), thus given the same amount of time the HighBioTrap can recover more less-frequently microbial species from the air than the BioStage impactor, thus resulting in higher microbial aerosol diversity. On the other hand, the HighBioTrap also has lower impaction velocity (10.2 m/s) compared to that of the BioStage impactor (it is 24 m/s). Overall, the impaction stress difference between the two samplers might play a lesser role in the culturable diversity difference recovered by two different samplers given the same sampling time compared to the difference in their air volumes collected. Nonetheless, increased sampling time led to more desiccation effects for the HighBioTrap than the BioStage impactor. The HighBioTrap sampler was designed to be mostly used for field sampling in natural environments where microbial aerosol particles often appear to be agglomerates or attach to large non-biological particles. These possibilities certainly allow the HighBioTrap to collect those small biological aerosol particles in nature. In terms of species detection for qualitative analysis, the HighBioTrap has obvious advantages compared to the BioStage impactor.
