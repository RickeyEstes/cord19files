We identified no new studies in this update. Two randomised trials (which were included in the original review) met the review eligibility criteria. In the first trial, newborn resuscitation training compared with usual care improved provider performance of appropriate resuscitation (trained 66% vs usual care 27%, risk ratio 2.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75 to 3.42; moderate certainty evidence) and reduced inappropriate resuscitation (trained mean 0.53 vs usual care 0.92, mean difference 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.66; moderate certainty evidence). Effect on neonatal mortality was inconclusive (trained 28% vs usual care 25%, risk ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.48; N = 27 deaths; low certainty evidence). Findings from the second trial suggest that essential newborn care training compared with usual care probably slightly improves delivery room newborn care practices (assessment of breathing, preparedness for resuscitation) (moderate certainty evidence). In the original review, 2480 references were identified. Of these, 2334 articles were excluded following a review of titles and abstracts. Reasons for exclusion included inappropriate study designs/interventions/outcomes; enrolment of trainee/community health workers; and enrolment of non-paediatric patients. The full texts of 146 papers were retrieved for detailed eligibility assessment. Of these, eight studies were identified as potentially meeting the review inclusion criteria. Six were subsequently excluded. Overall, two studies were included: Opiyo 2008 and Senarath 2007. In this review update, we identified a total of 4768 articles. We excluded 4754 articles after a review of titles and abstracts. We retrieved the full texts of 14 articles for detailed assessment. Of these, 14 articles were excluded because of ineligible study design or setting (n = 7 studies), participants (n = 1 study) and outcomes (n = 6 studies). We identified no ongoing studies. No new studies met all of the review eligibility criteria. The study flow diagram is presented in Figure 1 .
