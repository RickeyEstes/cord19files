The study used a dataset containing the average daily returns of 399 stocks from 14 subsectors of the healthcare industry by CLSA and trading on three stock markets namely Shenzhen, Hongkong and Shanghai between July 2004 and June 2014. Each of these stocks is further sub classified into one of 14 subcategories of the healthcare sector (healthcare facilities, medical equipment manufacture, medical supplies & distribution, pharmaceuticals diversified, pharmaceuticals generic and specialty, biotechnology, managed health care, diagnostic substances, medical laboratory and research, advanced medical equipment manufacture, healthcare transportation, therapeutic medicine, medical tourism and other medical support services) as shown in Table 1 . This helps to verify whether a group is more likely to herd if trade is sufficiently homogeneous, i.e. each member faces a similar decision problem, and each member can see the trades of other group members [59] . As the years 2004, 2009 and 2014 witnessed periods of rapid foreign investment in Chinese healthcare market (because of policy incentives), data for the periods and share of foreign investment in all subsectors is highlighted. This is because the presence of foreign investors is seen as a significant precursor to herd formation [63] . The portfolio returns based on an equally weighted portfolio of all companies in the respective subsectors were then calculated. The information in Table 2 shows the summary statistics for average returns daily log, return dispersion and the average number of companies used to calculate these statistics for each sub-sector. Since the number of shares in a sector does not remain constant over time, the table shows the average number of companies during the sampling period in the second column of the table. Panel A shows that the average daily returns for all subsectors are positive. Other medical support services (4.184) and medical tourism (4.106) subsectors have the highest average daily return volatility based on the standard deviation of average daily returns. Panel B of Table 2 shows the summary statistics for daily cross sectional standard deviations within each subsector. In line with the results of Panel A, we observe higher volatility cross section in medical tourism. Table 3 is the results of estimates for the CSSD base model in equation 2. Given the significant changes in dispersion and strong correlation, all estimates are made using the Newey-West heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent standard errors. The MSCI China A Healthcare Index was used to represent the market and the upper and lower one and five percentile of the market return was used to represent periods of market stress. The regression output shows a negatively significant parameter estimate (β D ) for medical tourism subsector at 99 % confidence interval. On the contrary the parameter estimates for medical equipment manufacture subsector, and specialty, managed healthcare and other medical support service is significantly positive (99 % confidence interval). The parameter estimates for pharmaceuticals generic and therapeutic medicine is significantly positive at 90 % confidence interval and the remaining sectors are positive but insignificant. Thus generally (except medical tourism) cross-section standard deviation tends to be higher during periods of extremely down markets. This suggests that the included stocks do not move in the same direction as the market during periods of market stress but rather deviate more from general market movements when the market takes an extreme fall. Consistent with the work of [62] , this observation does not support herding. In Table 4 the estimates for the model based CSAD non-linear equation 4 has been presented. Similar to [38] , three distinct regressions were run for each subsector: one that uses the entire sample, and two limiting the data to up (or down) movement of the market index. Running separate models in this way allows us to examine if there is any asymmetric effect of herd behavior. The results from the non-linear model give completely different results than the first method. Table 4 again shows that the first nonlinear term (γ2) is statistically significant in almost all subsectors. It is very instructive to note that unlike the linear model, the R 2 values of the nonlinear regression models are generally higher than those of the linear model. This indicates that the non linear regression fits better than the linear regression in Table 3 as the proportion of the variance in herding that is predictable from the independent variable is higher. Generally, the information indicates that the inference made from the linear model disclosed in Table 3 may be spurious. Thus we rely heavily on evidence from the nonlinear test in Table 4 to make inferences about herding. In that regard, evidence of herd formation is found in all the subsectors and regressions yield statistically significant and negative estimates γ 2 which indicates a declining nonlinear relationship between the market return and equity return dispersions. The results of regression analysis performed with respect to up and down markets separately show herding effect is mostly prominent in market losses. The results suggest that herd formation is most likely observed during periods of market losses. The information in Table 5 presents the results of the State Space Model 1. The results show strong evidence of herding through H mt and this is consistent with the findings using the non-linear model. It is observed that H mt is highly persistent with large and significant values ofφm . Moreover σ mη estimates are highly significant and indicate herd behavior. On the other hand, Table 6 show results of the augmented State Space Model 2 which contains two market variables (market return and market volatility). If these two are added in the measurement equation, it allows us to analyze the degree of herding, given the state of the market. In that regard, the findings are similar to that of the State Space Model 1 shown in Table 5 . Further, if the level of market volatility and market return are accounted for, the term H mt remains significant when the two explanatory variables are included. The findings indicate that herding behavior could explain changes in the volatility of factor sensitivities or dispersion of the betas for all assets in the market (Std c (β imt b ), instead of changes in fundamentals. Moreover positive and significant coefficients for the term log σ mt were estimated for most of the stocks in subsectors in the healthcare industry and that indicates an increasing dispersion of the betas for all assets in the market (Std c (β imt b ) with market volatility. This result is equally consistent with the previous studies that suggest that herding is more likely to occur during periods of market stress, i.e. highly volatile periods. Similarly, Table 6 shows that subsectors such as healthcare facilities, medical equipment manufacture, pharmaceuticals diversified, biotechnology, diagnostic substances and healthcare transportation sub sectors have dispersion of the betas for all assets in the market (Std c (β imt b ) that increases as market volatility rises since the coefficients for the market volatility term (log σ mt ) have significant and positive values. It is worth noting from Table 1 that that these subsectors (healthcare facilities, medical equipment manufacture, pharmaceuticals diversified, biotechnology, diagnostic substances) are among those that have seen increase in foreign shareholding presence between 2004 and 2014. This gives credence to the view of [63, 64] that foreign investors may exhibit herding (***, ** and * denote statistical significance at 1, 5 and 10 % respectively) behavior more visibly than domestic individual investors. Comparing the estimates forφ m across subsectors, it is noted that the effect of herd behavior in medical tourism and other medical support services are relatively higher than the other subsectors. From Table 1 it is observed that the medical tourism and other medical support services have seen significant increase in foreign investors since 2004 and this can be the source of the herding behavior.
