apparent hepatitis in about one-third of acutely infected adults. Clinical hepatitis may be preceded by a prodrome of fever, malaise, urticarial or maculopapular rash, and arthralgias for several days. Fever usually resolves before the onset of jaundice. Jaundice, dark urine, and scleral icterus usually are present by the time patients seek medical attention. Right upper quadrant tenderness, mild hepatic enlargement, and occasionally, splenomegaly are signs that should suggest the diagnosis. The most striking laboratory abnormality is the finding of extreme elevations in the aminotransferase enzymes. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) may be elevated to more than 10 times the normal levels, whereas the bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels are increased to a much lesser extent. Fulminant liver involvement occurs in about 1% of adults and may be complicated by more serious abnormalities, including hypoglycemia, coagulopathy, and hypoalbuminemia. Hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and bleeding diatheses are life-threatening complications seen in these patients. About 10% of adults with clinically apparent acute HBV infection proceed to chronic HBs-antigenemia, and are at risk for chronic hepatitis, postnecrotic cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients with asymptomatic primary HBV infection are at higher risk for chronic infection than those with symptomatic infection. While chronic persistent hepatitis, a benign illness of little clinical consequence except for the potential for HBV transmission to susceptible individuals, may occur, the major health concern is chronic active hepatitis, which eventually may produce cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatoma. Hepatitis B is differentiated from other causes of hepatitis by serologic assays. 23 A positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test identifies patients with current infection and correlates with infectivity during acute and chronic infection. Titers of HBsAg in the chronic phase of illness may wax and wane and occasionally fall below the limits of laboratory detection, so sequential testing should be performed if chronic HBV is suspected. The presence of HBeAg correlates with active virus replication and is a marker of high infectivity and high titer of HBV in the liver and blood. Antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAb) appears when HBsAg is cleared and is positive in individuals with immunity after recent or prior infection or immunization. Persons with HBsAb are not susceptible to acute infection or chronic hepatitis B, except in the very rare case in which reinfection occurs with a strain of hepatitis B against which the normal antibody response does not provide cross-protection. Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) appears before HBsAb and just after HBsAg is cleared from the serum, and this is a useful test for diagnosing acute hepatitis B in the window period before HBsAb appears. High titers of HBcAb persist in chronically infected persons and obviously do not predict immunity from further liver disease.
