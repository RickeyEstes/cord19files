We present here results from two methods of analysis, termed DetectiV and E-Predict.dist, as described above. There are 56 arrays in the dataset, the expected results of which are known. Each array was hybridized with RNA containing a single virus, except GSM40845, which was infected with both influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus. We assigned a correct result for each method if the top hit from the analysis was the same as the known infectious agent or, if that agent was not represented on the array, the top hit was a very closely related virus. In the case of GSM40845, we report a correct result if both viruses were at the top of the reported hits, to the exclusion of other virus species (but not closely related strains). Additional data file 1 gives the top hit for both analysis methods in all 56 arrays. As can be seen, DetectiV generated a correct result in 55 out of the 56 arrays. In comparison, the E-Predict.dist method gave a correct result in 53 out of the 56 arrays. These results are discussed in greater detail below.
