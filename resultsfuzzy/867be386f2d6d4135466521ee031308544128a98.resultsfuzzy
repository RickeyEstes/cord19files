Coronavirus-like particles and ,;mall amounts of amorphous material were seen by electron microscopy in pooled materials recovered from virus-containing fractions detectc(! towards the middle of the sucrose gradients. Haemagglutination was detected only in those fractions which contained infectious virus (titre of pooled material 10 s.s LDs0/ml in mice). Optimal haemagglutination titres using mouse and ferret erythrocytes were obtained at pH values between 5.75 and 6.4, and erythrocytes from all species were thence tested at pH 6.2 (table I). Haemagglutination was not observed with erythrocytes from the following species: sheep, rabbit, rhesus monkey, rat, gerbil, pigeon, cat and guinea-pig. Haemagglutination was not detected in control material from fractions of sucrose gradients used to ,, partially purify )) uninfected liver material. In common with other coronaviruses, MHV3 agglutinates erythrocytes from several species and, as with IBV, it is necessary to partially purify the preparations of virus to obtain consistent results. Haemagglutination was observed at 4, 20 and 37 ° C except with mouse erythrocytes, which did not agglutinate at 20 and 37 ° C. Erythrocytes did not elute from agglutinated preparations left for several h at 37 ° C. The l)reliminary studies reported here indicate that MHV.~ may be included among those coronaviruses causing haemagglutination. Haemagglutination inhibition studies and infectivity assays are now being undertaken to confirm the above results and establish a ral)id method of measuring antibody levels to MHV.
