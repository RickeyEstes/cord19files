Since our data show that the cholesterol reduction in viral envelope can inhibit PRRSV infectivity, it is possible that viral lipid raft disruption induced by cholesterol removal disrupts PRRSV virus particles. To extend our understanding of this effect, purified CH1a virions were treated with 0, 10, 20, 30, 50, or 80 mM MβCD for 1 h at 37 1C and re-purified by ultracentrifugation as described in Materials and Methods. Western blotting was then performed to determine whether MβCD treatment has effects on viral envelope protein (Gp5) or Nucleocapsid protein (N protein). As shown in Fig. 7A , the amount of N protein exhibited a dosedependent reduction induced by MβCD treatment, while the amount of Gp5 was fairly constant up to 80 mM MβCD. The permeabilization was defined as a greater decrease of the capsid protein relative to the envelope glycoprotein. Thus, depletion of cholesterol from viral envelope resulted in permeabilization of PRRSV virions. We also tested the viral RNA levels of the MβCDtreated CH1a virions to determine whether viral RNA is retained in PRRSV virions (Fig. 7B) . Our results showed little change in the amount of viral RNA in CH1a virions after MβCD treatment, suggesting that PRRSV particles do not lose viral RNA after permeabilization by MβCD. These results reveal that depletion of MβCD treatment. Virus prepared as above was analyzed for particle-associated viral RNA by real-time RT-PCR. Virus input was normalized to Gp5 content. viral cholesterol may impair PRRSV infectivity due to the virion disruption and leak of nucleocapsid protein.
