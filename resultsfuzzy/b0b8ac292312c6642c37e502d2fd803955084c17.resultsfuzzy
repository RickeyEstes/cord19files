A total of 16,170 nasal swab samples from 540 groups of growing pigs from the remaining 32 farms were collected. From the total number of samples collected, 746 (4.6%) were positive for influenza A virus by RRT-PCR, and 178 viruses were isolated from these samples. At least 1 positive sample was detected in 117 (21.7%) groups of pigs; thus, these groups were classified as positive. Of the 32 farms, 29 (90.6%) had at least 1 positive group throughout the study. Of the 117 groups with RRT-PCR-positive results for influenza A virus, complete or partial subtype details were obtained for 99 (84.6%) pig groups ( Figure  1 ). Influenza A virus infection with just 1 subtype (H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, or H1N1pdm09) was detected in 21, 19, 9, and 17 groups, respectively. Dual infections were detected in 10 groups, of which 8 concurrently harbored influenza virus subtypes H1N2 and H1N1pdm09, 1 harbored subtype H1N1 and an H3N-untypeable virus, and the remaining group harbored subtype H1N1 and an H1N-untypeable virus. Partial subtyping information was obtained for 16 pig groups, from which 11, 4 and 1 were infected with an H1Nuntypeable, H3N-untypeable, and an H1N-untypeable with pandemic matrix gene virus subtype, respectively. In 18 groups, a subtype could not be defined through either RRT-PCR or sequencing. At most farms in our study, groups of pigs were identified as having multiple and different influenza A viruses detected throughout the surveillance period ( Figure 1 ). Viruses were isolated from 178 swab samples that originated from 62 pig groups. Of the positive groups, the mean and median numbers of samples positive for influenza A virus by RRT-PCR were 6.4 and 2, respectively. The numbers of positive samples ranged from 1 to 30; most groups (n = 48) had 1 positive sample (Figure 2 ). There were 15, 10, 4, and 2 groups that had 2, 3, 4, and 5 positive samples, respectively. A total of 13 groups had >20 positive samples, 2 had 29 positive samples, and 1 had 30 positive samples. Although most samples collected from these 13 groups were positive for influenza A virus by RRT-PCR, pigs in only 7 of these groups exhibited clinical signs of influenza-like illness. The number of positive groups per farm ranged from 1 to 18. On average, 31% of the groups tested by farm throughout the program were classified as positive ( Figure  3 ). Farms with no influenza A virus-positive results were monitored for ≈1 year but lacked consistency in the testing frequency and time intervals between tests. The average age of the pigs in the 540 groups was 13.7 ± 5.7 weeks. Influenza virus was detected in pigs as young as 4 weeks and as old as 30-32 weeks of age. Mean age in positive groups was 12.4 ± 5.2 weeks and in negative groups was 13.9 ± 5.8 SD (Figure 4) . However, age was not a statistically significant predictor of influenza A virus test status.
