Fabrication of nano zinc oxide cellulose fibres signifies one of the best antibacterial fibres for biomedical applications. During the typical process nano zinc oxide-sodium alginate cellulose fibres (ZnO-SACNF) were fabricated by effective impregnation of sodium Scheme 1. Schematic diagram of nano zinc oxide-sodium alginate antibacterial cellulose fibres. 1) and (2). The development of ZnO-SACNF was schematically shown in Scheme 1. The TEM image of typical nano zinc oxide is shown in Fig. 1A . It can be seen that the synthesized nano zinc oxide particles are in different shape and agglomerated possessing an average diameter of 25 ± 5 nm. At higher resolution, the inter-planar d-spacing of the lattice plane 0.246 nm is clearly visible in Fig. 1A2 , corresponding to the (1 0 1) planes of wurtzite zinc oxide which is in agreement with previously reported values (Zhao et al., 2014) . These studies clearly specify that the precipitation route supports the formation of the well-defined structure of zinc oxide material, which enhances their applicability in medical and advanced material science applications. The XRD pattern of nano zinc oxide is shown in Fig. 1B . The XRD pattern shows well-intensified peaks for the developed zinc oxide nanoparticles. The pattern of pure zinc oxide shows the diffraction peaks of crystalline zinc oxide corresponding to main diffraction planes: (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3), (2 0 0), (1 1 2) and (2 0 1), in the hexagonal wurtzite structure. The peaks have been identified (JCPDS card no. 36-1451) by WinXPow software. The FTIR spectra of sodium alginate ( Fig. 2A) showed a broad peak at 3351 cm −1 for its hydrogen bonded OH group. Asymmetric and symmetric stretching of -COO group of alginate was observed at 1638 and 1408 cm −1 , respectively (Kulkarni, Sreedhar, Mutalik, Setty, & Sa, 2010) . In addition, sodium alginate showed a characteristic peak at 1022 cm −1 corresponding to C O stretching vibration of its polysaccharide structure. The peak at 862 cm −1 corresponds to Na O bond vibration (Samanta & Ray, 2014) . Pure cellulose fibre showed characteristic peaks at around 3364 cm −1 , 2924 cm −1 and at around 1311 cm −1 corresponding to -OH stretching frequency, CH 2 stretching vibration and C H bending mode respectively; characteristic bands at 1150 and 1015 cm −1 are assigned to the C-O-C from the glycosidic units or from ␤-(1,4)-glycosidic bonds (Raghavendra, Jayaramudu, Varaprasad, Ramesh, & Raju, 2014) . The combination of the peaks corresponding to both sodium alginate and cellulose were observed in sodium alginate coated cellulose fibre. However, in case of cellulose-zinc oxide sodium alginate nanocomposite fibres, an additional peak distinctive for Zn-O-Zn vibrations was noticed at 533 cm −1 with slightly shift in the frequency of peaks corresponding to cellulose and sodium alginate (Ambika & Sundrarajan, 2015) . This evidently indicates the composite bonding nature of nano ZnO with cellulose fibre through sodium alginate matrix. The FTIR spectrum of zinc oxide (Fig. 2B) showed important peaks at 405 cm −1 and 697 cm −1 which indicate Zn-O stretching mode (Varaprasad, Ramam, Mohan Reddy, & Sadiku, 2014) . The peaks were observed at 1600-1640 and 3100-3600 cm −1 but not broad. This is due to the presence of traces of water after hydration by exposure of the ZnO in the open air (Morozov, Belousova, Ortega, Mafina, & Kuznetcov, 2015) . The detailed information on the morphology of the synthesized nano ZnO and ZnO-SACNF was revealed by SEM. The SEM image of the synthesized nano ZnO was presented in Fig. 2C . The image evidently showed the rod-like shape of zinc oxide nanoparticles with excellent alignment. The corresponding EDS analysis evidently confirmed the nano ZnO by giving characteristic peaks corresponding to mainly zinc and oxygen elements (Fig. 2D) . The presence of ZnO nanoparticles over the ZnO-SACNF were evident from the SEM images, which showed the distribution of nano ZnO (indicated with arrows) over the fibres (Fig. 3) . However, the distribution pattern is absent in the case of pure cellulose fibre (Fig. 3A) and sodium alginate coated cellulose fibre (Fig. 3B) . This indicates the distributed particles over ZnO-SACNF is nano ZnO. To confirm this prediction, SEM-EDS was carried out for pure cellulose fibre (Fig. 3A1) , sodium alginate coated cellulose fibre (Fig. 3B1) and ZnO-SACNF fibre (Fig. 3C1) . The data revealed that the peaks corresponding to elemental zinc and oxygen were showed only by ZnO-SACNF fibre but not by pure cellulose fibre and sodium alginate coated cellulose fibre (Fig. 3B2) . Hence, the SEM-EDS strongly supported for the distribution of ZnO over cellulose fibres. The thermal property of fibres is a valuable piece of evidence that provides the information on physical characteristics and the components present in the fibres as well. As shown in the TGA curves (Fig. 4) , an initial weight loss at a temperature below 100 • C was observed due to the loss of moisture present on the surface for all the samples. The primary thermogram of the synthesized ZnO nanoparticles showed the higher degradation between 224 and 314 • C and a final residue of at 600 • C (Fig. 4A) whereas the sodium alginate coated cellulose fibre (SACF) and ZnO-SACNF fibres showed the higher degradation at between 289-443 • C and a final residue of at 600 • C (Fig. 4B) . The residual mass left over from the SACF (13%), ZnO-SACNF1 (15.25%) and ZnO-SACNF3 (17.75%), clearly indicates the existence of nano ZnO. Thermal studies led to the conclusion that with the increase in the percentage (%) of sodium alginate, the residual mass leftover also increases. This was due to rise in the number of nano ZnO over ZnO-SACNF with increase in sodium alginate concentration. The phenomenon is due to the overall rise in bonding interactions between 'nano ZnO sodium alginate matrix' and the polar groups of cellulose fibre that occurred with the increase in sodium alginate concentration. This raised the nano ZnO number effectively. In overall, TGA data demonstrates that ZnO-SACNF fibres are thermally more stable than the sodium alginate cellulose coated fibre. The tensile stress-strain curves data of sodium alginate coated cellulose fibres (SACFs) and ZnO-SACNF fibres were depicted in Table 1 . The data illustrates the mechanical properties such as: maximum stress (Fig. 5A ), Young's modulus (Fig. 5B ) and % elongation-at-break ( Fig. 5C ) of all the cellulose fibres. The results indicate that the ZnO-SACNF can be utilized for the longer duration of use without any significant damage or breakage.
