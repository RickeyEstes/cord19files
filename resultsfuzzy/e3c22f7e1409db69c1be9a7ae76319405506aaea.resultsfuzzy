We use the methods outlined above to analyse previously published virus gene sequences sampled from an epidemic of rabies virus in raccoons in North America [25] . Spatio-temporal phylogenies were estimated from these sequences using the continuous phylogeographic model implemented in BEAST [15] . The analyses below were performed on 100 phylogenies sampled regularly from the post burn-in posterior tree distribution generated by BEAST.
