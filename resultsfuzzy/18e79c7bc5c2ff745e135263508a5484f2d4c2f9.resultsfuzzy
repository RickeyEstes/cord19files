3.1. Flow shape characterization 3.1.1. Thermal plume around human body The movement of body plume and exhaled air can be clearly observed with the aid of schlieren photography technique. For a standing person, the thermal plume would arise along the body height and continue to develop above the person's head. The plume velocity was measured using a hot-sphere anemometer placed along different vertical heights above the subject's head. The maximum velocity measured was approximate 0.23 m/s. Murakami [28] and Melikov [48] indicated that the majority of inhaled air for a standing still person would be directly from the limited area below the nose (nose breathing) or the mouth (mouth breathing) and in the front part of the body. The rising thermal plume can be inferred to contribute to the inhaled air to a large extent for a standing person. Whilst the upward stream around the body collides with the expelled air, causing possible velocity decrement immediately at the mouth/nose opening when the exhaled plume enters the thermal boundary layer of the body [26, 29] . A curved flow affected by the rising thermal plume, especially at low initial exhaled velocities was observed. For a person lying on his or her back, the plume would rise vertically from the exposed part of the body (i.e. head, face and neck) without the heavy quilt covering and then mix with the exhaled air. Comparing the airflow during the standing posture to the air movement with a person lying flat; the upward thermal stream could somehow accelerate the vertical movement of the exhaled airflow instead of blocking it. This was due to the identical dispersal direction of these flows.
