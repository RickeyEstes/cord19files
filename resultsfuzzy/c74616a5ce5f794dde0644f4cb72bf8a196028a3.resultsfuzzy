doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1005173.g009 The Influenza Virus Infects the Mammary Gland through Breastfeeding these results give insight into mechanisms which may contribute to influenza severity in infants and nursing-mothers. The mammary gland is a unique organ which undergoes several structural and molecular transformations throughout the female's life-cycle, i.e. puberty, pregnancy and postpartum. Pregnancy associated breast cancer (PABC) has been hypothesized to be a consequence of breast remodeling that occurs during pregnancy-lactation cycles and mammary involution [17, 18] . We showed increases in oncogene pathways and involution programing in influenza positive glands. Breast involution is characterized by the presence of proteolytic cleavage, apoptosis, and leukocyte recruitment (i.e., macrophages) for secretory alveolar cell removal [17, 47] . Our gene expression analysis implicated significant presence of M2 macrophages in influenza infected mammary glands by the upregulation of the M2 specific transcripts CD163, CLEC7A, M5R1, CD209, LGMN, and MRC1. M2 macrophages have a similar phenotype as tumor associated macrophages (TAM), since they regulate MMPs and support a microenvironment favorable for oncogenesis [47] . In agreement with this profile we showed increased MMP1, MMP2, MMP8, MMP11 and MMP14 in the H1N1+ MGs. We also found oncogenic collagen and cell attachment gene signatures upregulated in our data: COL5A2, COL3A1, COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL4A6, Integrins (ITGB6) and cell-matrix interaction proteins (SPP1) [17] . Several of these collagen genes have previously been shown to be associated with both cancer progression and involution in mouse models of mammary involution [17, 48, 49] . As further validation and discovery, future studies should investigate the full transcriptomics during influenza virus infection in active mammary glands of the ferret to eliminate any biases of the canine microarray. Although no structural or tissue pathological evidence for cancer progression was found in our studies possibly due to the short time frame of the study, clear tissue evidence of milk cessation was seen. Viruses such as HPV have been shown or speculated to be the etiological agent of specific cancers [50] including breast cancer [19, 51] . Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women worldwide [52] and viral nucleic acids have been found in breast tumors i.e., bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) [19, 51] . Viruses may instigate cancer progression through oncogenic viral proteins or by induction of chronic inflammation [19, 53, 54] . We found induction of genes typical of influenza antiviral responses (CXCL10) [40] as well as cancer associated genes upregulated in H1N1+ MG suggesting mammary glands. As our expression analysis showed the induction of a cancer-promoting microenvironment in mammary glands infected with the influenza virus, it is important to note that viruses that have been found to be directly oncogenic, such as HPV, have infectious cycles differing from that of the influenza virus [23] . Therefore we hypothesize if long-term biological networks are upregulated during influenza infection in breast tissue then those genetic changes would most likely be due to inflammation. The long-term implications of pathogen infection in breast tissue are not known but our data suggests influenza infection leads to short-term pathogenic genetic reprograming within mammary glands. The CDC recommends continued breastfeeding in the event of infant influenza infection [55] . Although the importance of breastfeeding cannot be overstated [11, 12] , our findings may impact the management of influenza infection in the mother-infant dyad. Reports have shown most pregnant women with severe influenza infection did not receive the yearly influenza vaccine [10] . Our data reinforces the importance of seasonal influenza vaccination in pregnant tissue (B). *** Indicates a p-value less than 0.001. Data was collected and analyzed from three independent mammary gland inoculation experiments (3 mammary inoculated mothers, 18 infants) and mock mammary inoculation controls (3 mammary mock inoculated mothers, 21 infants). Results presented show data or are representative of 3 mammary inoculations. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1005173.g010 The Influenza Virus Infects the Mammary Gland through Breastfeeding and breastfeeding women. Our investigation also suggests that continued breastfeeding during mother or infant influenza infection could lead to breast infection, live virus shedding, and breast pathogenesis. Short-term milk expression by breast pumping with possible pasteurization may be an appropriate strategy for management of influenza infection in the motherinfant dyad. Previously, a guideline has been investigated for the management of influenza transmission in the mother-infant dyad. Since these guidelines had only considered the possibility of respiratory transmission, further investigation and guideline development may be important [56] . Although not much is known regarding viral transmission through breastfeeding, great efforts have been devoted to modeling mother-to-child HIV transmission due to the importance of breastfeeding in HIV high incidence countries [57] . HIV in breast milk exists in both cell-associated (leukocytes) and cell-free forms [34] . Our data suggests that the influenza virus infects glandular epithelial cells whereas HIV primarily targets leukocytes leading to systemic circulation. Our observation here implies novel dynamics of influenza transmission through breastfeeding is a mechanistically different mode of virus transmission in the mother-infant dyad and a formally unidentified system of immune response regulation within the mammary gland for the local production and direct delivery of pathogen specific antibodies. This suggests there is much to be understood regarding the mother-infant relationship and pathogen transmission. Recently, MERS-CoV has been speculated to be transmitted from camels to humans through consumption of camel milk [58] . Together these findings support a hypothesis that respiratory viruses may have the ability to also infect mammary tissue, including human breast cells, possibly due to a shared branched architecture and cellular structure of epithelial cells in lungs and mammary glands.
