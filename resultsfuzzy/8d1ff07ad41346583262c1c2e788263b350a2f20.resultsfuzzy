Meta-predictor (3D Jury) revealed that there are three significant hits (3D score . 50) for S2 subunit of SARS-CoV: 1dg3_A (Human guanylate binding Protein (signaling protein), 3D score 117, threading server ShotGun on 3), 1f5n_A (Human guanylate binding Protein (signaling protein), 3D score 95, threading server mGenTHREADER) and 1ezf_A (Human squalene synthase (transferase), 3D score 82, threading server INBGU). Three templates were used to generate 3D model of S2. The quality evaluation of these models was conducted by PROQ program in which two measurements (ProQ-LG and ProQ-MX) were used. The corresponding scores are below: ProQ-LG ¼ 0.583 and ProQ-MX ¼ 0.026 for 1dg3_A, ProQ-LG ¼ 1.409 and ProQ-MX ¼ 0.034 for 1f5n_A, ProQ-LG ¼ 2.503 and ProQ-MX ¼ 0.106 for 1ezf_A. In view of the fact that cutoffs for 'correct model' are ProQ-LG . 1.5 or ProQ-MX . 0.1, so the 'correct' model for S2 is the model built on template 1ezf_A, although other templates obtained marginally higher 3D scores. The alignment between S2 and template 1ezf_A with ClustalW [10] and secondary structure of S2 predicted by PsiPred v2.3 [11] are displayed in Table 1 . Fig. 1 shows that the 3D model of S2 subunit is Table 1 Alignment between SARS-CoV S2 protein and template 1EZF_A and secondary structure of S2 primarily consisted of a helices. In fact, Liu et al. [1] predicted the secondary structure of S protein by eight techniques and found that there are nine successive alphahelices in S2. Based on the presence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids alternately, they speculated that these helices could be the amphipathic alpha-helices, which collapse into coiled-coils, bring a fusion peptide back toward the transmembrane domain and lead to the fusion of cellular and viral membranes [2] . The LGA method is designed to compare protein structures or fragments of protein structures in sequence dependent and sequence independent modes. We superimposed the protein structure of S2 into the core structure of gp41 (1aik) by LGA. Surprisingly we found that the N chain and C chain of gp41 are well overlapped with two helices in the 3D model of S2 subunit (Fig. 2) . For SARS-CoV S2 subunit, the corresponding residues include P879-N942, for HIV-1 gp41, the corresponding residues cover S546-G572 (N chain) and W628-L661 (C chain), each of residue pairs has a distance , 5 Å (Table 2) . It has been shown that that there are some similar structural motifs in HIV-1 gp41 and SARS-CoV S2 protein [4, 5] : (1) N-terminal leucine/isoleucine heptad repeat sequence on residues 913-1000; (2) C-terminal leucine/ isoleucine heptad repeat motif on residues 1151 -1185. While our results reveal that SARS-CoV S2 and HIV gp41 share very similar helix structure on residues 879 -942, these discoveries suggest a similar membrane fusion mechanism for the two viruses. Naturally, a question arises: could the inhibitors for anti-HIV-1 therapy be used to fight against SARS-CoV? For example, GGL, a HIV-1 specific cell entry inhibitor that can bind to the coiled-coil core of gp41 and efficiently inhibit HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion [12] , and another D-peptide inhibitor, which targets the gp41 coiled-coil pocket and inhibits HIV-1 entry [13] . Fig. 3 showed the binding interaction between GGL and S2 protein, the residues involved are: 901 -918. Fig. 4 showed the binding interaction between D-peptide and S2 protein, the residues involved are: 899 -915. This suggests GGL and D-peptide inhibitors from HIV-1 gp41 could be used as potential inhibitors for SARS-CoV entry.
