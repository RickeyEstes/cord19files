Because our ultimate goal is adenovirus-mediated HDP expression into cow milk for consumption by the calf, we anticipate that there will be a significant dilution effect in the milk and the large surface area of the gut. Therefore, we sought to identify a cocktail of HDPs which are effective at low concentrations. We evaluated the microbicidal activity of Indol, LFn, BMAP-27, and PG-1 alone and in combination against an E. coli K99 bovine field isolate known to cause Neonatal Diarrheal Disease in cattle [10] . Individually and in the majority of combinations, Indol, LFn, BMAP-27, and PG-1 were poorly microbicidal at 1.5 µg/ml (Table 1) . However, when Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1-FLAG were introduced to the bacteria at 1.5 µg/ml each, the cocktail proved to be strongly anti-microbial. A trypan blue exclusion assay determined that even when Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1 were at 12. 5 µg/ml, they were not cytotoxic to MAC-T cells (Table 2 ). Next, we evaluated the effect that Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1 had on IL-8 protein expression, a chemokine known to induce both chemotaxis and activation of neutrophils [15, 16] and an indicator or innate immune activation. Although this experiment needs to be repeated to establish whether these results are statistically significant, Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1 (1.5 µg/ml) prompted a moderate induction of IL-8 expression in MAC-T cells. In the presence of LPS, Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1 showed a strongly synergistic effect with production of > 3,000 pg/ml IL-8 after 48 hours. Thus, we have chosen to clone Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1 into adenovirus for further analysis. To circumvent the costs associated with HDP production, we devised a procedure where-in the mammary glands of the cow will act to produce the HDPs which will be supplied to the suckling calf through the milk. We designed a gene such that Indol's natural signal peptide sequence was in-frame to the active region of Indol which was also in-frame with the active sequences for LFn, BMAP-27, PG-1 and FLAG. Because there are no commercially available antibodies against Indol, LFn, BMAP-27 or PG-1, we included the FLAG epitope as part of the gene product. Detection of FLAG using anti-FLAG antibodies could be used to infer expression of Indol, LFn, BMAP-27 and PG-1. The gene was designed so that each HDP were separated from each other by four codons coding for Arginine. When translated into a protein, the HDPs will be freed from each other through trypsin digestion. This gene was synthesized as indicated in Materials and Methods and cloned into a CpG-free expression plasmid. In turn, the gene was sub-cloned into a replication defective adenovirus. When 293 cells were transduced with the modified adenovirus, we detected FLAG expression through dot-blot analysis suggesting that the peptides were also being expressed. In future experiments, we intend to evaluate whether adenovirus-derived HDPs, like their synthetic counterparts, are strongly anti-microbial and promote IL-8 expression from MAC-T cells when costimulated with LPS. Once satisfied that the adenovirus-derived peptides are functional, we will transduce udders directly through the teat canal and then monitor the milk for the HDP/FLAG protein using antibodies against FLAG. Once consumed by the calf, the HDP/FLAG protein will travel to the trypsinrich gut and, through enzymatic digestion, Indol, LFn, BMAP-27 and PG-1:FLAG will be released. Calf's will be infected with E. coli K99 to establish whether continuous exposure to adenovirus-derived HDPs protects them against Neonatal Diarrheal Disease.
