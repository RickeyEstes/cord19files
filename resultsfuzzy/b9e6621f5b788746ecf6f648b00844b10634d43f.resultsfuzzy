Design and synthesis of the library The set of bis(benzylamide) compounds previously designed as DC-SIGN antagonists was directly expanded into am annose-based library by adoptingt he described route [11c] that starts from diacid 7,w ith small modifications (Scheme 1). Scale-up to am ultigram scale of the protected common scaffold 11,e quipped with av ersatile azido-functionality,a llowed furtherd erivatization to ac ollection of bisamides 12.T he glycomimetic library was not conceived to specifically target one lectin, but rather to broadly interact with CLRs that contain the EPN motif in their CRD. Therefore, the required set of amines was selected for diversity,w ith the help of chemoinformatic tools and based on commercial availability.L ead-like physicochemicalfilterswere appliedt oal arge number of amines from availablec ommercial collections (see the Experimental Section) and the selection was sifted to exclude any structurali ncompatibility.The remaining structures were then clustered by chemoinformatic descriptors and representatives of the various subgroups were selected based on their availability.O verall,a collection of 38 diverse amines were selected (Figure 2 ), which allowedu st op repare the Man-based derivatives 12.1-39 (Scheme1,F igure 2). As discussed previously,M an-binding CLRs are expected to recognize l-Fucr esidues as well, due to the overlapping carbohydrate-specificity imparted by the EPN motif. Therefore, in analogyt ot he mannobiosidem imics, b-fucosylatedl igands 15 were synthesized by linking the cyclohexane acceptor (9)w ith an appropriatelyp rotected fucose-trichloroacetimidated onor (13)t oy ield the bis-p-nitrophenylester 14,w hich was reacted with as et of primary and secondary amines. This approacha fforded the 11 Fuc-based ligands 15.1-11 (Scheme 1, Figure 2 ).
