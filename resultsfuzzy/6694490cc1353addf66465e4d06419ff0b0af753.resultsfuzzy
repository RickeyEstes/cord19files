Immune cells rapidly infiltrate the brain of TMEV-infected mice but not sham-infected mice C57BL/6J mice at 5 to 8 weeks of age were infected by intracranial injection of 2 × 10 5 PFU of the Daniel's strain of TMEV in a volume of 10 μL. Sham-infected mice received identical injections of vehicle lacking virus. Histological analysis of the brain at 24 h post infection (hpi) revealed marked inflammation and large numbers of infiltrating cells in the infected mice ( Figure  1 ). Inflammation was most concentrated in the hippocampal region ( Figure 1B) , with high density in the corpus callosum and alveus and at the hippocampal fissure ( Figure 1B , D). Infiltrating cells were also observed within the pyramidal neuron layer of cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) in the hippocampus ( Figure 1D , I). In shaminfected mice, despite receiving a needle stick through the calvarium, no evidence of inflammation was ever observed in the brain. We also never observed an inflammatory response in mice injected with UV-inactivated TMEV (data not shown). We conclude that productive infection of the brain with TMEV results in the rapid induction of immune cell infiltration that is concentrated in the white matter above the hippocampus and at the hippocampal fissure.
