According to the study design shown in Figure 1A , the proteome alterations in human cells induced by IFNα and IFNγ were analyzed by means of ion-intensity-based label-free quantitative proteomics. To elucidate time-dependent effects, protein abundance changes in at least six biological replicates relative to mock-treated control cells were monitored after 4, 24, and 48 h. In the whole LC-MS/MS study, 2,945 proteins were successfully identified and quantified with at least one unique peptide in 69 parallel samples (see Table S1 in Supplementary Material). A brief inspection of the corresponding names of the proteins most significantly upregulated by IFN (e.g., IFN-induced GTPbinding protein Mx2) immediately highlighted an enrichment of IFN-stimulated proteins indicating the validity of our approach. To cope with the issue of less accurate quantification results based on single peptide quantifications (32, 33) , we determined individual coefficients of variation (CVs) for each protein represented by a single unique peptide. Single peptide quantifications with large deviations indicated by an averaged CV >50% were excluded. A comparison of the median CVs showed that this revised group of proteins with single peptide quantification exhibits the same variation as observed for proteins quantified with two peptides (see Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). The number of proteins finally considered for the data analysis concerning time-and type-dependent proteome alterations was 2,735 (see Supplementary Material for the complete data set). After quantitative and statistical analyses, the number of proteins showing a significantly different abundance (p < 0.05) in IFN-treated samples in comparison to mock-treated controls was determined for each IFN type and incubation time. Depending on the IFN type and duration of treatment, the abundance of up to 1,700 proteins significantly changed (see number in brackets in Figure 1B ). Based on our experience with the limitations of label-free quantification (34) and our criteria of biological significance and meaningfulness, we set a threshold of twofold change in terms of median protein abundance (see numbers without brackets in Figure 1B ) for subsequent analysis. Since changes below this rather arbitrarily chosen set point might be relevant under particular circumstances, these proteins were included in the Supplementary Material enabling others to reanalyze the data with higher or lower criteria of stringency. Depending on the IFN type and the period of exposure, more than 600 proteins significantly changed their abundance more than twofold, highlighting profound alterations of the cellular protein composition in response to IFN. After 4 h of IFN exposure, IFNα treatment led to a higher number of proteins being upregulated when compared with IFNγ (45 versus 27 proteins). In clear contrast, after 24 and 48 h, the number of upregulated proteins is five to eight times higher in the case of IFNγ (55 versus 436 at 24 h). We also observed several proteins which were significantly downregulated. In this respect, the difference between IFNα and IFNγ was even more pronounced, since such protein regulations were clearly more prominent upon IFNγ treatment. Functional annotations of all proteins being significantly and at least twofold regulated by IFNα or IFNγ were performed for each investigated time point. The obtained results display a broad spectrum of associated molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components (see Figures S2-S4 in Supplementary Material). As expected, for both IFN types, IFN signaling (and several related or similar gene ontologies called, e.g., "defense response to virus") was found as a highly enriched biological process among the upregulated proteins. Additionally, several biological processes associated with antigen presentation via MHC-I were found to be enriched among proteins induced by both IFNs after prolonged exposure. In the particular case of IFNγ, the obtained results furthermore indicate, that a broad spectrum of diverse biological processes are altered. This is in line with the expectations based on the tremendously higher number of proteins being regulated by IFNγ when compared with IFNα. In addition, the dynamic nature of cellular proteome modulations is nicely demonstrated by the enrichment of particular biological processes among up-and downregulated proteins at various time points. For example, different translational processes were found highly enriched among IFNγ-repressed proteins at 24 h, whereas the same processes were enriched in the IFNγ-induced group of proteins at 48 h (see Supplementary Material).
