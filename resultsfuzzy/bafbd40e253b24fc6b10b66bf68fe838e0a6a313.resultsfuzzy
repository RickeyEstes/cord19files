We studied the NP microbiota composition of 96 healthy 18months old children. Their characteristics are depicted in Table  S1 . Being aware of the current discussions on the artefacts that may be introduced by pyrosequencing [13, 14] , we applied a stringent protocol for filtering and clustering of sequences. The approx. 1 100 000 generated sequences (on average 11000 sequences per sample) yielded about 92 000 unique sequences, representing 13 taxonomic phyla and 243 species-level phyla types (OTUs). The data were normalized for equal numbers of reads per sample. The 5 most predominant phyla were Proteobacteria (64%), Firmicutes (21%), Bacteroidetes (11%), Actinobacteria (3%) and Fusobacteria (1.4%) ( Figure 1 ). In addition, we found representatives of Cyanobacteria, probably reflecting plant chloroplasts obtained through inhalation. Sporadically and/or in low abundance we found sequences for the candidate divisions OD1, TM7 and BRC1 and the phyla Deinococcus-Thermus, Nitrospira, Planctomycetes and Chloroflexi. On a lower taxonomic level, the most prevalent genera were Moraxella (40%), Haemophilus (20%), Streptococcus (12%), and Flavobacterium (10%). Other fairly common genera were Dolosigranulum (5%), Corynebacterium (2%), Neisseria (2%) and Fusobacterium (1%). The 30 most common OTUs representing almost 98% of all reads, and their relative and absolute presence are shown in Table 1 (For the complete list of OTUs; see Table S2 ). Although the top 6 predominant phyla are identical to those of neighbouring microbiota, the composition, i.e. relative contribution of each phyla to those microbiota seems fairly different. In the oral cavity, microbiota are dominated by Firmicutes followed by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes (overall 50% Gram-positive bacteria), whereas the microbiome of the nostril contains more than 80% gram-positive bacteria, mostly Actinobacteria and Firmicutes [15] . These data, therefore, suggest different dynamics (i.e., different biological equilibria) in the NP microbiome. There was a high inter-individual variability in the composition of the microbiota up to phyla level, and in the relative abundance of the individual bacterial inhabitants (Table 1) . This resulted in a limited core microbiome (as representing .0.1% of sequenes and being present in all 96 children) of specific phyla only, namely Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, however no single OTU was found universally. Because of the observed high inter-individual variation, we applied a less strict definition of core microbiome, i.e. OTUs present in more than 50% of all samples and representing .0.1% of the sequences. With this definition we observed a core microbiome of Moraxella, Haemophilus influenzae, Enhydrobacter (Proteobacteria), Streptococcus, Dolosigranulum (Firmicutes), and Corynebacterium (Actinobacteria) ( Table 1) . Principal component analysis identified 3 distinct clusters of microbiota profiles correlating strongly with a predominance (.50% of sequences per sample) of single OTU's, i.e. Moraxella (OTU 1), Haemophilus influenzae (OTU 2), and Streptococci (OTU 3), respectively, connected by a group of community profiles representing mixed microbiota ( Figure 2 ). Additionally, we observed transition zones for microbiota profiles between the Haemophilus-and Moraxella-dominated clusters, but not between Haemophilus-or Moraxella-dominated clusters and the Streptococci-dominated cluster, which might implicate potential interactions between microbiota profiles. Since respiratory and invasive infections are associated with fall/winter season, we analysed our samples concordantly. When distinguished by the time of sampling (fall/winter versus spring) groups of children did not differ significantly in demographics or life style characteristics, infectious symptoms, medical history or environmental parameters (Table S1 ), reducing the likelihood of internal confounders as a cause of potential seasonal correlations with microbiota profiles. However, with respect to microbiota profiles, we observed marked differences between samples obtained in fall/winter versus samples from spring ( Table 2 ). In samples obtained in late fall and winter, we observed a predominance of Proteobacteria (relative abundance (% of all sequences): 75% versus 51% in spring), Fusobacteria (absolute abundance (% of children): 14% versus 2% in spring), and Cyanobacteria (absolute abundance: 64% versus 30% in spring; relative abundance: 0.27% versus 0.09% in spring) were significantly more abundant compared to spring, whereas Bacteroidetes were more frequently present in samples obtained in spring (relative abundance: 19% versus 3% in fall/winter, absolute abundance: 91% versus 54% in fall/winter) (Figure 3a ). On OTU level we observed amongst others more Bacillus, Brevibacillus and Lactobacillus species, and Flavobacterium and B. fragilis (both Bacteroidetes) in samples from spring compared to fall/winter. In addition we found less a-Proteobacteria, Oxalobacteriaceae, Microbacteriaceae, Ralstonia, Pseudomonas and Acidovorax (all Proteobacteria), Cyanobacteria, and Porphyromonas catoniae (Bacteroidetes) in samples from spring compared to fall/ winter ( Figure 3b ). When re-evaluating the core microbiome per individual season (i.e. OTUs present in more than 50% of samples of a certain season), we observed an additional core of Proprionibacterium and Cyanobacteria for fall/winter and an additional core of Flavobacteria, Brevibacillus and Bacillus (almost exclusively) for spring. The latter groups of bacteria, i.e. Bacteroidetes and (Brevi)bacillus and Lactobacillus species, are generally related to protection against overgrowth of pathogenic species due to the production of bacteriocins and other inhibitory substances [7, 16] . In other microbiota like the gastrointestinal and vaginal tract they are highly related to maintenance of a balanced microbiome as well [17] [18] [19] . Since infections with respiratory pathogens, especially pneumonia, are strongly related to fall and winter season [9, 10] , the presence and abundance of these bacteria in respiratory microbiota in spring might therefore suggest in general a more balanced respiratory microbiome in this specific season as well protecting against onset of respiratory or invasive infections. We tested all samples for the presence of respiratory viruses by q-PCR methods and detected one or more viruses in 67% of samples (Table S3) . We found no evidence for associations between the observed seasonal shift in microbiota and the overall presence of respiratory viruses, nor for any of the individual viruses when tested by SAM analysis (Figure 3b ). Although these data do not exclude an effect of respiratory viruses on microbiota composition, they do suggest other season-related factors like environmental factors (temperature, humidity, smoke exposure, crowding), or nutrient-or vitamine-related effects, or a combina-tion of factors might be important for the observed shifts in microbiota profiles [3, 16, 20] . Interestingly, day-care attendance or smoke exposure could not be related to the observed shifts in microbiota, although the latter was encountered very rarely. This further underlines that different or more complex effect may be responsible for the observed phenomenon. In addition, no association was observed between seasonal changes in microbiota and recent antibiotic use, which was rather limited in this population (Table 1, Figure 3b ). Because of the explicit correlation between season and microbiota profiles, correlations between other environmental determinants and microbiota could not be accurately tested, which underlines that in future studies one needs to control and power for seasonal effects. As previously mentioned, the majority of the children (87%) had a predominant Gram-negative NP community profile (.50% Gram-negative bacteria). This is probably due to predominance of Gram-negative Moraxella and Haemophilus species known to reside specifically at this body site [3, 4] . On average, 76% of the overall NP microbiome in children was composed of Gramnegative bacteria, however with a wide range of 9-99% Gramnegative bacteria per sample. In addition, there was a higher contribution of Gram-negative bacteria to microbiota obtained in fall/winter (81%) compared to spring (72%) (Independent samples t-test: p = 0.044). This could potentially explain some of the observed differences between gram-negative ratios at the NP microbiome and at other human microbiota, where seasonal changes in composition have so far not been studied. Finally, we studied the inter-individual diversity in NP microbiota overall and in relation to season. We observed highly diverse microbiota, with on average 40 OTUs per sample, and a high inter-individual diversity with 20-87 OTUs per individual. With respect to season, there was no significant difference in diversity between fall/winter (average: 38 OTUs, range: 20-77) and spring (average: 43 OTUs, range: 20-87) (independent samples T-test: p = 0.083). As internal control, we compared conventional culturing results for the potential pathogens S. pneumoniae (71% positive), H. influenzae (69% positive) and M. catarrhalis (88% positive) with sequencing results for the OTUs Streptococcus (OTU 3, OTU 23, OTU 31), H. influenzae (OTU 2, OTU 10), and Moraxella (OTU 1, OTU 6) respectively ( Figure S1 ) and found strong correlations between S. pneumoniae and Streptococcus OTU 3 and 31 (p,0.0001) but not OTU 23, which is probably another Streptococcus species, and H. influenzae and H. influenzae OTU 2 and OTU 10 (p,0.0001). For M. catarrhalis, we were only able to find a positive correlation between M. catarrhalis and Moraxella OTU 6 with independent samples t-test (p = 0.003) but not with Spearman's Correlation, which may be explained by the low number of Moraxella negative individuals, making a comparison between binary and quantitative data difficult. Also the presence of other Moraxella species with high sequence homology might interfere with a strong correlation between these results. In conclusion, to our knowledge this is the first report describing in detail the composition of and the variability within the human NP microbiota assessed at the depth of next generation sequencing. In line with other human body habitats, we found a complex, diverse and highly variable microbiota with a relatively limited core microbiome. There is considerable seasonal variation in NP microbiota. This implies the time of sampling should be considered when describing or comparing NP microbiomes, and preferably controlled for when other potential determinants like the impact of viruses or antibiotics on microbiota profiles or the correlation between microbiota profiles and diseases will be tested. Whether these seasonal changes in composition of the NP microbome are causally related to seasonal occurrence of respiratory tract infections remains to be determined, though seems relevant for further understanding of pathogenesis of infectious diseases and in the long run potentially for understanding of effects of current and design of future preventive measures.
