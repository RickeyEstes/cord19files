The docking operation of the octapeptide AVLQSGFR to SARS CoV M pro was performed based on the homology structure [7, 20] using MOE (molecular operating environment) program package [28] . Twenty-five docking structures were obtained, and the one with the most optimal docking score was used for further energy minimization. Fig. 2 shows the energy-refined docked structure obtained by the aforementioned step 1. In contrast to the common serine proteases that have a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad, SARS CoV M pro has a His-Cys catalytic dyad (His-41 and Cys-145), which is similar to TGEV M pro (His-41 and Cys-144) and HCoV M pro (His-41 and Cys-144) [7, 29] . According to Chou et al. [20] , the catalytic active region is located within the pocket between domain I and II of SARS coronavirus main protease that contains the following 23 amino acid residues: Cys-22, Gly-23, Thr-24, Thr-25, Leu-27, His-41, Val-42, Cys-44, Thr-45, Ala-46, Glu-47, Asp-48, Met-49, Leu-50, Asn-51, Pro-52, Tyr-54, Cys-145, His-164, Met-165, Asp-187, Arg-188, and Gln-189. Fig. 3a shows the location of catalytic dyad His-41 and Cys-145 in SARS CoV M pro . The active cleft of SARS CoV M pro can well accommodates the octapeptide, and the ligand binds to the receptor through six hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3b) , fully in consistent with the results reported by Chou et al. [20] . In order to study the influence of SARS CoV M pro on chemical bonds of the octapeptide, we considered a small region from the catalytic cleft surrounding the octapeptide, as shown in Fig. 3b . The catalytic dyad His-41 and Cys-145 are in the front of peptide bond Gln-Ser on the subsites R 1 and R 1 . The polar hydrogen H 2 on N 2 in midazole group of His-41 points to the peptide bond Gln-Ser and has large influence in the active region. Electrostatic interaction plays the dominant role in ligand-receptor combination and must be taken into consideration during the quantum mechanical calculations for the influence of SARS CoV M pro to the chemical bonds of the octapeptide. For this purpose, we divide the amino acid residues in the active cleft between domain I and II of SARS CoV M pro into six segments and compute the atomic charges using ab initio quantum mechanics separately (Fig. 4) . The 62 amino acid residues in the six segments are listed in Table 1 . After deducting the overlap atoms, there are a total of 953 atomic background charges, including all atoms in catalytic cleft. In Table 2 , we list Mulliken atomic charges q Mull and electrostatic potential equivalent charges q ESP , which are obtained by fitting atomic charges to the electrostatic potential at the van der Waals surface. The atomic charges from semi [25] , especially q ESP of AM1 are not reasonable. Because q ESP reproduces quantum mechanical electrostatic potential on molecular surface, in this research, we use q ESP from HF/6-31G * calculations to illustrate our points. It can be seen from Table 2 that the two polar hydrogen atoms on imidazole group have large atomic charges q ESP . The atomic charge (0.4201) of polar hydrogen H 2 is a little smaller than the atomic charge (0.4288) of proton H + δ1 on nitrogen N ␦1 and is close to the peptide bond Gln-Ser on subsites R 1 and R 1 . The polar hydrogen H 2 attracts the -electron density from peptide bond Gln-Ser so as to weaken this chemical bond. We calculate the cleavage reaction energy from the octapeptide AVLQSGFR to two tetrapeptides AVLQ and SGFR using ab initio HF/6-31G * in the gaseous phase. The molecular energies of the octapeptide and two tetrapeptides are shown in Table 3 and the hydrolyzing reaction energy is 110.8 kJ/mol.
