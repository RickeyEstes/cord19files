As an example to show the advantage of 2L-PCA, we applied it for predicting the binding affinity of epitopepeptides with class I MHC molecules HLA-A*0201 [38, 39] . HLA-A*0201 is one of the most frequent class I alleles found in many different species and populations, which plays a critical role for antigen presentation in both viral antigens [40] and tumor antigens from a variety of cancers [41] [42] [43] [44] , and is expressed in approximately 50% of Caucasians population [45] . The epitope-peptides consist of nine amino acids [38, 39] . In the 2L-PCA study for the epitope-peptides, the nine side chains of the nine amino acids are the nine fragments. Eight physicochemical properties are used as the descriptors of the 20 natural amino acids. Four of them are the HMLP parameters [15, 16] , describing the lipophilic character, hydrophilic character, surface area with lipophilic potential, and surface area with hydrophilic potential, respectively. The fifth property is the volume of amino acid side chains. The remaining three properties are the secondary structural potency indices of amino acids: the α-potency, β-potency, and coil-potency [46] . Listed in Table 1 are the eight physicochemical parameters of 20 amino acids used in this study. In this study the HMLP parameters were used to describe the lipophilicity and hydrophilicity of molecular fragments. In peptides the HMLP parameters of the 20 natural amino acid side chains are available from literatures. However, the HMLP parameters of common chemical molecular fragments have to be derived using complicated calculations. In such cases other hydrophobic parameters can be used, e.g., the atom-based hydrophobic parameters in [47] . To reduce computational time, the cross validation in this study was performed via the independent dataset test [48] , as described as follows. The sequences and experimental binding affinities of the 90 peptides were used as the training dataset to train the model, while those of the 40 peptides taken from [49] as the independent dataset to test the model. Actually, such 40 peptides had also been compiled in a series of publications [41, 42, [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] . The logarithms (pIC 50 ) of IC 50 were used as the bioactivity, because they are related to the changes in the free binding energy [55, 56] . Listed in Table 2 are the sequences and the experimental pIC 50 of the peptides used in the training set. The binding strength of the 90 training peptides and 40 testing peptides covers the low, intermediate, and high affinity. The following two criteria were applied in the choice of the testing peptides: (1) the range of binding affinities in the testing dataset should not exceed the range of affinities in the training set; (2) the amino acid at each position in the testing dataset should also be present at that position in the training set of peptides. These two conditions make the 130 peptides to be the ideal benchmark dataset for 2L-PCA method. The iterative 2L-PCA technique described in Method section is used for the binding affinity study of peptides based on the sequences and experimental data listed in Table 2  of fragment parameters were assigned to 1, implying that all fragment parameters are equally important. Shown in Figure 1 are the curves of correlation coefficients R vs iterations , where the curve R a is for the iteration of coefficients � { } a k , and the curve R b is for the iterations of Table 3 . In the iterative solution precedure the correlation coefficien increases from the first value R A (1) =0.4167 to the converged value R A (98) =0.8871, and the prediction residue decreases from the first value Q A (1) =0.7223 to the converged value Q A (98) =0.0387. The predicted pIC 50 of the 40 queried peptides in the testing set are given in Table 4 , which were predicted It is expected that, with more experimental data available, the predictive power of 2L-PCA will be further improved. Actually, 30 prediction servers for human MHC-I peptide molecules were evaluated in a review article [57] . Among the 30 existing servers, 16 were ranked as the first class that provided the most accurate prediction results for MHC-I peptide molecules with the correlation coefficients ranging from r = 0.55 to r = 0.87. It has been shown in this study that the prediction correlation coefficient yielded by our 2L-PCA method is r = 0.868, being ranked around the very top of the first class. 2L-PCA neither needs knowing the exact comformations of the peptides nor needs aligning the peptides according to a template. The two steps are necessary but quite difficult for CoMFA [58, 59] and CoMSIA [60, 61] owing to that there are numerous possible conformations for peptides and that the experimental crystal structure for serving as a template is often not available. 2L-PCA method provides an alternate way for design of the chemical drugs and peptide drugs. The eigenvalues and contributions of physicochemical properties and amino acid positions in peptides are summarized in Table 5 and shown in Figure 3 . In Table 5 the eigenvalues are normalized. The eigenvalue portion of the first three property eigenvectors is almost 100%, and the eigenvalue portion of the first eigenvector alone is larger than 99%. Most contributions are made by the three properties: side chain volume (Vol), lipophilic surface area (S L ), and hydrophilic surface area (S H ), as The molecular structure is divided into 4 fragments according to the substitutes being investigated. The fragments F 1 , F 2 and F 3 are three substituent groups, and the fragment F 4 is the remaining part of the molecular parent. (B) In short peptides each side chain of amino acid residue is a fragment. shown in Figure 3b and Table 5 . The contributions of other 5 properties seem very small. The eigenvalue of the first peptide position eigenvector is larger than 98%. In Table  5 the contributions of the nine amino acid positions are different. However the differences are not big, implying that all positions are almost equally important. The detailed computation results are given in Supplementary  Information 1. We are often facing two kinds of challenges in theoretical prediction for drug design: one is over-correlation problem, and the other is lack of information and explanation for the predicted results. The over-correlation problem is caused by large amount of parameters used in the prediction model, which may yield quite good correlation results in self-consistency test [62, 63] , but very poor predicted results in independent dataset test owing to the high dimensional disaster [19] or "curse of dimensionality" problem. To solve this problem, the pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) was introduced [64] . Ever since then, the concept of PseAAC or the general PseAAC [21] has been widely used in drug development and biomedicine [65, 66] and nearly all the areas of computational proteomics (see, e.g., [67] as well as a long list of references cited in [68, 69] ). Actually, the physicochemical properties used here can be regarded as some optimal pseudo components [70] . It is through such a PseAAC approach to remove the trivial parameters (or reduce the feature vector's dimension) and grasp the key ones. Besides, the traditional prediction methods fail to provide a good explanation for the predicted results; i.e., how do the physicochemical properties and the structural changes affect the bioactivities? In contrast to that, the proposed "2L-PCA" method can provide more information about the impact of the physicochemical properties and molecular fragments to the bioactivities of drug candidates.
