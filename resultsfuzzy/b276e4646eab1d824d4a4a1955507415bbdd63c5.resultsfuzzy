A total of 503 out of 572 (87.94%) specimens were positive for at least one of the respiratory pathogens by either 13× kit or 2-tube assay, 230 (40.21%) specimens with co-infections were detected by either of the 2 methods. Of the 494 positives by 13× kit, 267 (46.68%), 202 (35.31%), and 25 (4.37%) specimens were positive for a single pathogen, 2 pathogens, and 3 pathogens, respectively. Of the 433 positives by 2-tube assay, 240 (41.96%), 173 (30.24%), and 20 (3.50%) specimens were positive for a single virus, 2 viruses, and 3 viruses, respectively. Table 2 shows the sample positivity for each pathogen detected by 2 methods. A specimen was considered positive for a pathogen if it was tested positive by either of 2 methods. The most frequently detected pathogen was HRV (241/572, 42.13%). PIV was detected in 179 of 572 (31.29%) specimens including 14/572 (2.45%) type 1, 1/572 (0.17%) type 2 and 164/572 (28.67%) type 3. 83 of MP and 17 of Chlamydia were identified by 13× kit. No PIV2 were detected by either of 2 methods. Discordant results were found in 4.02% (23/572) of specimens. As detection of MP and Chlamydia was not done with 2-tube assay, MP and Chlamydia were not counted in the discordant results.
