The 2-amimo-4-aryl-7,7-dimethyl-5-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-chromene-3-carbonitrile 1 is a versatile and readily available reagent, and its chemistry has received considerable attention in recent years. 19 As we reported before, our strategies of synthesizing this compound were through the reaction of aromatic aldehydes, malononitrile with 5,5-dimethyl-1,3cyclohexanedione. 19e In order to further modify this compound, we recently investigated the reaction of the compound 1 with acetic anhydride 3 in the presence of a substoichiometric amount of pyridine. The product of this reaction was expected to be compound 6. 20 However, to our surprise the sole product was 2-benzo [e] [1, 3] oxazine derivatives 4. In the initial studies, the mixtures of compound 1 and acetic anhydride 3 were heated at the temperature in the range of 60e120 C without a catalyst. Only trace amount of products were formed even extending the reaction time to 12 h. To improve the yield, the reaction conditions were optimized by varying the catalysts. The results showed that the pyridine-catalyzed reaction gave the highest yields, as illustrated in Table 1 . The results of the reaction of 1 with 3 in the presence of pyridine are summarized in Table 2 . The structures of 4 have been confirmed by 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, and elemental analysis. Furthermore, the structure of 4c was proven by single-crystal X-ray analysis (Fig. 1) . Inspired by the interesting results, we further explore the applicability of this method. The 2-amino-4-aryl-7-methyl-5-oxo-4,5-dihydropyrano[4,3-b]pyran-3-carbonitrile 2 were used to react with acetic anhydride 3 under the same reaction conditions, 2-(4aryl-7-methyl-5-oxo-3,4-dihydropyrano[3,4-e][1,3]oxazin-2(5H)ylidene)-3-oxobutanenitrile 5 were produced in high yields with the results listed in Table 3 . The new products were characterized with 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and elemental analysis. Furthermore, the structure of 5b was further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis (Fig. 2) . Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveal that classical hydrogen bonds, N(1)eH(1).O(3) and N(1)eH (1) .O(5), exist in the molecular structure of 4c and 5b, respectively. The hydrogen bond length is 2.66 A. Although the detailed mechanism of the above reaction remains to be unclear, a possible mechanism was proposed in Table 1 Catalyst optimization for the synthesis of 4a
