Evidence has shown that the death rate from smallpox among pregnant women was extraordinarily high. Pregnant women had a higher rate of hemorrhagic disease than did other adults. Approximately 16% of cases in unvaccinated pregnant women were early hemorrhagic smallpox versus ≈1% in nonpregnant women and adult males. The casefatality rate in unvaccinated pregnant women approached 70%. Fetal wastage approached 80% (6-9). We now know that a normal pregnancy includes a modest transient immune defi cit, particularly suppression of Th1 and Tc cells (9). If therapeutic interventions were available that could assist the immune system during infection with smallpox virus, the case-fatality rate in pregnant women might be reduced considerably. Ocular variola was fairly common in the Asian subcontinent. Severe conjunctivitis was common in patients with smallpox, and corneal lesions developed in ≈7% of unvaccinated patients (6) . Dixon reported that corneal lesions were most common in North Africa in patients with trachoma (10) . Actual pocks occurred in vascularized parts of the conjunctiva or sclera in which pannus occurred. Obvious protein-calorie malnutrition also seemed to be a risk factor. Blood vessels in the conjunctiva and sclera characteristic of trachoma or other types of serious conjunctivitis in tropical areas enabled variola virions to be deposited on parts of the sclera that are usually avascular. We cannot say with confi dence that ocular variola was considerably more common in areas where trachoma or vitamin A defi ciency was rare because rates of this devastating complication are not well documented in Europe and the United States; however, ocular variola certainly occurred. If trachoma is a predisposing condition, ocular variola may be rare in Western industrialized nations if smallpox reappears. 


Section:are high case-fatality rates in unvaccinated pregnant women and fetal wastage a result of immune suppression?
Section:are ocular variola and its resulting blindness a result of trachoma?
