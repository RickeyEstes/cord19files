Following AuNP incubation in solutions of different protein concentrations, the resulting nanoparticles were pelleted from free proteins and re-dispersed through sonication in PBS. Consistent with previous studies on nanoparticle/protein interactions [33] , it was observed that higher protein concentrations yielded particles with increased colloidal stability as evidenced by the disappearance of a discernable pellet and a purple solution characteristic of AuNP suspensions ( Fig. 2A) . sVLPs prepared from the 3 mg/mL protein suspension were readily dispersible and manifest as distinct, nonclustered nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 2B) , indicating passivation of the high particle surface energy upon sufficient protein coating. In contrast, particle preparations with lower protein content (1000 mg/mL) yielded clustered AuNPs. To further characterize sVLPs, we assessed AuNPs, sVLPs, and native IBV virions (Fig. 2C) using nanoparticle tracking analysis, which examines particle samples on a particle-by-particle basis via tracking of scattered laser light from individual particles [34] . Between AuNPs and sVLPs, we observed an overall reduction in the light scattering intensity. Given that AuNPs are known to scatter light at an extraordinary efficiency, the intensity reduction in sVLPs can be attributed to successful protein coating, which restricts light passage to the AuNP surfaces. Likewise, native virions have the lowest light scattering under the analysis as they are comprised entirely of organic materials. The result demonstrates the feasibility of studying the evolution of nanoparticle protein corona formation using nanoparticle tracking analysis, which reveals changes in light scattering and size simultaneously. Upon examining the size distributions of the different particles, sVLPs showed a broader distribution as compared to the sharply distributed 100 nm AuNPs. Protein corona formation increased the nanoparticle size from 100.6 nm (PDI ¼ 0.012) to 139.2 nm (PDI ¼ 0.073) and increased the zeta potential from À23.2 mV to À16.7 mV (Fig. 2C,D) . In comparison to native IBV virions, which have an average diameter of 147.3 nm (PDI ¼ 0.081) and a zeta potential of À16.6 mV, the sVLPs are similar in overall physicochemical properties. Examination of particle stability showed that the sVLPs remained stable in PBS over a 7-day period with its size ranging from 136.7 nm (PDI ¼ 0.071) to 140.2 nm (PDI ¼ 0.091) (Fig. 2E) . Analysis of antigen display with freshly prepared sVLPs showed that 1 Â 10 11 AuNPs retained 23.5 ± 2.2 mg of spike proteins, corresponding to approximately 900 IBV spike proteins per particle. Western blotting using analysis revealed a sharp protein band of approximately 160 kDa (Fig. 2F) , which is characteristic of the viral antigen [17] . Transmission electron microscopy and immunogold staining further highlight the similarity between sVLPs and native IBV virions. It was observed that immunogold clustered around the sVLPs, mirroring the staining pattern on the native virions (Fig. 2G) . These observations demonstrate the close semblance between the sVLPs and native virions regarding their physicochemical properties and antigen display. Examination of antigen retention in protein-poor (1X PBS) and protein-rich (10% BSA in 1X PBS) conditions also shed light on the characteristics of the protein corona around the sVLPs. In PBS, particle-bound antigen level remained steady over a span of 24 h, yielding similar IBV spike protein band intensities across the different incubation samples (Fig. 2H) . A rapid drop-off in particlebound spike protein was observed upon incubation in 10% BSA. Immediate retrieval of sVLPs from the BSA solution resulted in~65% reduction in the spike protein level, and at the 24 h mark,~25% of the initial antigen remained on the sVLPs. This observation suggests the formation of two distinctive corona layers distinguishable by their interaction dynamics with surrounding biomolecules, reflecting the presence of both a reversible "soft corona" and an irreversible "hard corona" that have been frequently observed in prior nanoparticle studies [35e37]. The results indicate that approximately 200e250 IBV spike proteins are stably bound to each sVLPs. These proteins are expected to remain in the particulate form in complex biological environments upon in vivo administration. To examine antigen delivery and lymphatic transport by the sVLPs as compared to free spike proteins, sVLP formulation was administered to mice through a footpad injection. Popliteal lymph nodes, which are the draining lymph nodes by the footpads, were subsequently collected and sectioned for immunofluorescence assay. IBV spike protein-specific immunofluorescence staining showed a significantly enhanced antigen delivery by the sVLPs as compared to the free protein formulation, resulting in an increased number of fluorescent punctates (green) in the lymph node sections (Fig. 3A) . Imaging analysis on multiple lymph node sections showed that the sVLP formulation increased lymphatic delivery by approximately 6 fold (Fig. 3B) . The observation of increased delivery attests to the strong protein/particle binding in the "hard corona" layer as the particle carrier is capable of facilitating antigen transport in vivo. The enhanced lymph node localization of the sVLPs is consistent with prior observations on nanoparticles and virus-like particles [2] . Owing to their nanoscale morphology and physicochemical properties, these nanoparticles are known to facilitate free lymphatic drainage via convective transport [38, 39] as well as cell-mediated lymphatic delivery via increased cellular uptake [2] . Immunogenicity of the sVLPs was also examined following intramuscular inoculation in mice. Anti-IBV IgG serum titers were compared between mice vaccinated with sVLPs and with free IBV spike proteins (Fig. 3C) , and it was observed that the sVLPs elicited significantly higher IgG levels, demonstrating improved vaccination potency over the free protein formulation. The improved immunogenicity can be explained in part by the enhanced antigen delivery to the lymph node, where a high number of antigen presenting cells reside. In addition, the particulate nature of the sVLPs likely also favors other immune activation mechanisms, such as improved cellular uptake, enhanced complement activation [38] and presentation by follicular dendritic cells [40] . These nanoparticle-specific immunological features make the sVLPs a promising vaccine candidate for disease management. To evaluate the sVLPs' effectiveness against viral infections, we vaccinated SPF chickens with free IBV spike proteins or sVLPs (10 mg of total viral antigens) via the intramuscular route. As an additional reference, a commercial WIV vaccine for IBV was administered based on the manufacturer's suggested dosage. Following vaccination, blood and tear were collected for analysis and a live IBV challenge was performed (Fig. 4A) . ELISA analysis showed that the sVLPs were superior in generating both IgG and IgA titers as compared to the free protein formulation and the WIV vaccine (Fig. 4B,C) . The total IgA in the tears of the vaccinated chickens were also quantified. Despite that intramuscular vaccination is generally known to be non-ideal for promoting mucosal immunity [41] , elevation of tear IgA level was observed for all three vaccine formulations (Fig. 4D) . It is expected that mucosal vaccination in future studies may further increase tear IgA levels and better highlight the differences among the formulations in eliciting mucosal immunity. Besides humoral immunity, cellular immunity, a major component of effective antiviral immune responses [42] , was analyzed using splenocytes extracted on day 28. The sVLP sample showed a significant increase in the IFN-g mRNA level as compared to the control, free protein, and the WIV vaccine samples (Fig. 4E) , demonstrating superior promotion of antigen-specific cellular immunity. We further examined the effect of the different vaccinations in protecting against a viral challenge. Clinical scores evaluated based on stamina, posture, and voice show that the sVLP group had the lowest overall symptoms, on par with animals vaccinated with the WIV formulation (Fig. 5A,B) . In comparison, vaccination with the free protein formulation was less effective and highly variable in moderating the disease symptoms. On day 28, necropsies were performed to examine the tracheas and kidneys, which are characteristic sites for infections by IBV [43] . As indicated in the gross lesion photos, the best antiviral protection was observed in the sVLP-immunized group, whereas organs from the free protein group and the WIV vaccine group showed observable mucus secretion and petechiae in tracheas (Fig. 5D, upper panel, arrowed) and swollen lesions and hemorrhages in kidneys (Fig. 5D, lower panel, arrowed) . The prophylactic effect of the sVLP vaccination was further demonstrated by examining the viral load in kidneys. Analysis by quantitative RT-PCR showed that immunization with sVLPs more consistently reduced the viral content, resulting in the lowest relative viral mRNA expression across the animal samples (Fig. 5C) . The results further corroborate the protective effect by the sVLP vaccination, which enhanced both humoral and cellular immunity for increased protection against the viral challenge. Coronavirus spike proteins are the primary antigenic signatures on coronaviruses as they contribute to the characteristic crown-like morphology underlining this virus family. As these proteins comprise the outermost layer of coronaviruses, the spike proteins have a pivotal role in viral pathogenesis and are recognized as the primary target for vaccine preparations [44] . Present vaccination strategies for coronaviruses include recombinant viruses and viruslike particles, and there is a continuing effort in developing new strategies for improving vaccine potency and safety [22] . To the best of our knowledge, incorporating coronavirus spike protein with synthetic nanoparticles has not been previously explored. By exploiting the high surface energies of synthetic nanoparticles, spontaneous assembly of sVLPs covered with IBV spike proteins were demonstrated. The strong particle/antigen association resulted in virus-sized particulates displaying IBV spike proteins, and the sVLPs elicited strong immune protection against a live IBV challenge. The enhanced immunopotentiation by the particle carrier is consistent with previous studies and echoes the curious observation that gold nanoparticles not only promote humoral but also cellular immune responses upon association with antigens [14, 15] . As the increased cellular immune response suggests that the nanoparticles may play a role beyond a passive antigen carrier, future studies examining the impact of nanomaterials and nanoparticle surface energies on immunological interactions are warranted. It should be noted that the phenomenon of protein corona formation is an evolving field of study in which scientists continue to examine nanomaterials in biological medium with increasing complexity [45e47]. Subtle changes on the environment and on nanoparticle properties can have dramatic and unpredictable impact on the overall corona identity with significant biological implications. To demonstrate a practical utility for the protein corona phenomenon, the present study adopts a reductionist approach in examining protein-particle interactions. AuNPs are incubated in a highly controlled condition with proteins of a singular species to form sVLPs with virus-mimetic features, and the dynamics of such association are expected to vary with different biomolecules and nanomaterials [48] . In general, inorganic nanoparticles promote stronger protein adsorption as compared to organic nanoparticles as inorganic nanoparticles tend to have higher surface energies. Decreasing particle size also tends to increase biomolecule interactions as it increases radii of curvature of nanoparticle surfaces. Other forces, such as electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces and covalent interactions all play intertwining roles in governing the nano-bio interface, and factors including nanoparticle functionalizations, buffer conditions, and biomolecule species have significant impact on the corona formation [48] . Nonetheless, in a controlled and optimized condition, the phenomenon may be exploited to facilely prepare formulations with defined characteristics and favorable biological performance. The present work takes advantage of this spontaneous interaction between nanomaterials and biomolecules towards improving vaccine development. This strategy may find practical applications in disease management against coronaviruses as well as other infectious threats.
