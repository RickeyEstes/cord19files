Of the total 146 samples screened, 89 (61%) were positive by PCR and/or the presence of proglottids. Of 117 samples for which we had both a PCR screening result and visual score for the presence or absence of proglottids, 66 (56.4%) were positive by PCR and 57 (48.7%) had at least one proglottid visible at collection. Overall, PCR screening results produced a higher (by 7.7%) prevalence of infection than the visual scoring of proglottid presence but there was no significant difference between these methods in the probability of detecting infection (Chi-squared test, v 2 = 1.39, df = 1, p = 0.24). Even so, both methods apparently yielded false negative results. Dipylidium proglottids were observed on the majority (68.2%, 45/66 samples) of faeces identified as positive by PCR screening, indicating false negative results in 31.8% of samples. Of 51 faeces identified as negative by PCR screening, proglottids were observed on 12 samples (23.5%), indicating false negative PCR results.
