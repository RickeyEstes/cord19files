The basic reproduction number, R 0 , is an important index of epidemiology. It refers to the average value of how many people an infected person can transmit the virus to through natural transmission without external intervention. Before January 20, 2020, when human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 was officially confirmed, people had not realized the infection of the epidemic and the SARS-CoV-2 was in a state of natural transmission. By estimating the trend in the early stages of the epidemic, combining equation (3.3), the basic reproductive numbers R 0 of COVID-19 is 3.56 (95% CI: 2.31 -4.81).
