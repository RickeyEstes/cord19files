Application of the newly developed RT-LAMP assay for detection of FHMNV in tissue culture and fish tissue samples Eight FHMNV isolates and 60 spontaneously infected fish samples were used simultaneously to compare between the RT-LAMP and RT-PCR methods. Results of both RT-LAMP and RT-PCR confirmed the identity of the eight isolates as FHMNV. RT-PCR results indicated that 13 of the 60 fish samples were infected by FHMNV and the rest of the samples were FHMNV-negative. The RT-LAMP assay showed that the RNA templates from the 13 FHMNV-positive samples as determined by the RT-PCR also produced positive RT-LAMP results. Furthermore, two of the 47 samples that were FHMNV-negative by RT-PCR yielded a positive result by the RT-LAMP (Tables 2 and 3) . Therefore, the DSe and DSp of the RT-LAMP method compared to the RT-PCR method were 100% and 95.7%, respectively.
