To obtain an unbiased view of global gene expression in the liver in the early phase of a chronic viral infection, we infected wild-type (WT) mice with LCMV strain clone 13 and performed transcriptional profiling of liver tissue at different time points by RNA-seq ( Figure 1A , Table S1 ). The differentially up-or downregulated transcripts were subjected to gene ontology (GO) analysis. As expected, genes involved in innate immune and inflammatory responses were significantly overrepresented (Figure 1B) . The most highly enriched GO term was related to oxidation-reduction processes. Further analysis by k-means clustering revealed distinct patterns of transcriptional up-and downregulation among this group of transcripts ( Figure 1C , Table S2 ), which included genes with antioxidant function such as glutathione S-transferases, hemoxygenase, and metallothioneins, as well as SODs ( Figure 1D , Table S1 ). The SOD family members SOD1, SOD2, and SOD3 are crucial scavengers of O 2 À (Miao and St Clair, 2009) . SOD1 (also known as Cu/Zn-SOD) is ubiquitously expressed, localized in the cytoplasm, nucleus and mitochondrial intermembrane space and has been linked to human diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Miao and St Clair, 2009 ). Yet, little is known about the role of SOD enzymes in the context of infection. Decreased levels of SOD1 were found in patients chronically infected with HCV (Diamond et al., 2012; Levent et al., 2006) , in HCV-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (Dillon et al., 2013; Megger et al., 2013) , as well as in HBV-associated cancer tissue (Kim et al., 2003) .

(D) Selection of differentially regulated genes involved in oxidation-reduction related processes (Experimental Procedures). (E) mRNA expression of Sod1 was determined by real-time PCR from liver tissue of WT mice that were either left uninfected or infected with LCMV 44 hr previously (n = 7-12 mice per group pooled from three independent experiments). (F) Western blot for SOD1 and actin were performed from liver lysates of WT mice that were either left uninfected or infected with LCMV 44 hr previously (representative results are shown). Relative protein ratios of SOD1 to actin were quantified by LI-COR (n = 11 mice per group pooled from three independent experiments). Statistical significance was calculated by unpaired t test (E and F). Symbols represent the mean ± SEM. coincided with our observation that infection with LCMV resulted in a downregulation of SOD1 expression at the RNA (Figures 1D and 1E) and protein level (Figure 1F ). To determine whether oxidative damage was responsible for the exacerbated liver pathology observed in infected Sod1 À/À mice, we adopted several complementary approaches. First, we stained liver tissue of uninfected Sod1 À/À mice for 8-oxoG and found no differences in 8-oxoG staining compared to uninfected WT mice ( Figure 3A ). LCMV infection, however, led to elevated staining of 8-oxoG in hepatocytes of Sod1 À/À mice at 16 hr after infection ( Figure 3A ), confirming increased virus-induced oxidative damage in the liver. Likewise, we detected elevated mRNA expression of Atf3 ( Figure 3B ), encoding a transcription factor that is induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and plays an important role in immunoregulation (Gilchrist et al., 2006; Hoetzenecker et al., 2012) . The observed transient cellular damage as seen by histological staining for 8-oxoG and cleaved caspase 3 at 16 hr after infection might be due to refractoriness of JAK-STAT signaling after sustained IFN-I signaling in liver tissue during viral infection (Sarasin-Filipowicz et al., 2009) . Thus, SOD1 is required to prevent oxidative damage in the liver upon viral infection. We next aimed to identify the cellular compartments that require SOD1 to protect against oxidative damage. Bonemarrow-chimeric mice were generated by reciprocal transfer of Sod1 À/À and WT genotypes followed by administration of liposomal clodronate to deplete remaining radioresistant macrophages. Chimerism was confirmed in liver and spleen by using a congenic marker ( Figures S2A and S2B ). Upon LCMV infection, Sod1 À/À /Sod1 À/À and WT/Sod1 À/À , but not WT/WT nor Sod1 À/À /WT chimeric mice exhibited elevated concentrations of ALT ( Figure 3C ). This result indicates an essential role for SOD1 in the non-hematopoietic compartment, of which hepatocytes comprise the major cell population in the liver. In support of these findings, ROS production was also observed in vitro in primary mouse hepatocytes upon LCMV infection by staining with the oxidation-sensitive fluorogenic probe CellROX Deep Red Reagent (CellROX) ( Figure 3D , Figures S2C and  S2D ), which was reversed by treatment with the antioxidant (C) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) were analyzed 24 hr after infection (n = 10 mice per group).

To test the potential effects of antioxidant treatment on virusinduced liver damage, we assessed the effect of CuDIPS in vivo. This ameliorated the virus-induced increase in concentrations of ALT in Sod1 À/À mice upon infection ( Figure 3E ) and led to a reduction of Atf3 mRNA expression ( Figure 3F ). Together, these data reveal that oxidative stress in hepatocytes plays a fundamental role in the observed virus-induced liver pathology. T Cells and NK Cells Are Not Involved in the Virus-Induced SOD1-Dependent Liver Pathology T cells play a major immunopathological role in HBV and HCV infection, as well as in the hitherto-described model of LCMV hepatitis (Guidotti and Chisari, 2006; Lang et al., 2013; Park and Rehermann, 2014; Zinkernagel et al., 1986) . We found comparable numbers of infiltrating CD8 + and CD4 + T cells in the liver tissue of infected Sod1 À/À and WT mice at 24 hr after infection ( Figures 4A and 4B ). Next, we assessed T cell responses in Sod1 À/À and WT mice after LCMV infection and found no major differences in virus-specific CD8 + T cells (Figures S3A-S3I) and CD4 + T cells ( Figures S3J-S3M ). In addition, T cell receptor beta chain (Tcrb) À/À / Sod1 À/À ( Figure 4C ) and perforin 1 (Prf1) À/À / Sod1 À/À bone marrow chimeric mice ( Figure 4D ), lacking either ab T cells or the hematopoietically-expressed cytolytic effector protein PRF1 respectively, exhibited liver damage similar to controls upon infection. Thus, the SOD1-dependent pathology occurs independently of T cells. NK cells are important regulators of T cell function as well as liver inflammation (Crouse et al., 2014; Rehermann, 2013; Waggoner et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2014) and we, therefore, investigated the potential role of NK cells in the observed liver pathology. Yet, we did not detect any differences in liver-infiltrating NK cells ( Figure 4E ) nor found any change of pathology upon the depletion of NK cells ( Figures 4F and 4G ). To study the potential involvement of leucocyte populations other than T cells and NK cells, we (H) Liver sections were stained for cleaved caspase-3 and numbers of positive cells are shown as mean ± SEM (n = 3 mice per group, scale bar represents 200 mm). Representative images are shown. Insert shows a hepatocyte positive for cleaved caspase-3. (I) Col1a1 mRNA was determined by real-time PCR in liver tissue 30 days after infection and fold-change was calculated between infected WT and Sod1 À/À mice (n = 10 mice per group, pooled from three experiments). Liver tissue was stained by Elastica van Gieson (J) and Sirius Red. (K). Pictures are representative of 9 or 10 infected mice per genotype (pooled from two independent experiments collected on day 103 and day 123, respectively, after LCMV infection) and n = 5 uninfected mice per genotype (scale bars represent 20 mm). Numbers represent the means ± SEM derived from automated quantification (% of area) based on the analysis of 5 high-power fields per sample. Statistical significance was calculated by two-way ANOVA (A, B, D, E, H) or by unpaired t test (C, I-K). Symbols/bars represent the mean ± SEM. (B) WT and Sod1 À/À mice were infected with LCMV.

(C) Bone marrow-chimeric mice were generated by reciprocal transfer of Sod1 À/À and WT genotypes. Serum ALT levels of mice infected with LCMV are shown (n = 5-8 mice per group pooled from two experiments). p values are derived from the comparison to the control group of WT/WT mice.

Representative images are shown. Quantification was performed by CellProfiler and numbers represent mean ± SEM. One out of R two similar experiments is shown. (E and F) WT and Sod1 À/À mice, which received either 10 mg/kg body weight CuDIPS or solvent, were infected with LCMV and (E) serum levels of ALT (n = 12 mice per group, pooled from three independent experiments) and (F) Atf3 mRNA in liver tissue were measured 44 hr after infection (n = 8 mice per time point, pooled from two independent experiments). Statistical significance was calculated by Two-way (A-C, E) or one-way (D and F) ANOVA with Bonferroni correction. Symbols represent the mean ± SEM. performed a cellular profiling of liver and spleen tissue and detected comparable infiltration of inflammatory monocytes, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils at 24 hr after infection ( Figures S3N-S3Q ). Together, these data indicate that T and NK cells are unlikely to be causally involved in the SOD1dependent pathology and exclude a profoundly altered recruitment of inflammatory myeloid populations to the liver, arguing in favor of a hepatocyte-intrinsic defect in infected Sod1 À/À mice.
