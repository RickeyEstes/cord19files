The proposed method is evaluated by clustering functionally related gene sequences and by phylogenetic analysis. We present our evaluation results in two parts. The first one aims at testing the efficiency of our similarity measure, DMk. The second one is to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed clustering method, mBKM. To measure the quality of the clustering results, our experiments adopt F-measure [52] to evaluate the clustering performance. For cluster j and class i, F (i, j) is defined as: Fði; jÞ ¼ 2Ã precisionði; jÞÃ recallði; jÞ precisionði; jÞ þ recallði; jÞ ð8Þ where i =1, 2, . . ., e, j = 1, 2, . . ., f, precision(i, j) = n ij /n j , recall(i, j) = n ij /n i , e is the number of classes, and f is the number of clusters. n ij is the number of the sequences of class i in cluster j, n i is the number of the sequences of class i, and n j is the number of the sequences of cluster j. The F-measure of the whole clustering result is defined as: where N is the total number of sequences in the data set. Clearly, an F-measure has a value between 0 and 1. The larger the F-measure is, the better the clustering result is.
