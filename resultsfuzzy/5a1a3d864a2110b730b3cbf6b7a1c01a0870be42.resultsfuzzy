In this analysis, we have rejected those phytochemical ligands that violate Lipinski's rule of five [41] . That is, ligands with MW > 500 g/mol, hydrogen-bond-donating atoms > 5, hydrogen-bond-accepting atoms > 10, or ClogP > 5, even though they may have strong docking energies, were not considered.
