Fig . 2 shows the velocity field at the mid-plane for the two ventilation schemes at time ''0'' (momentarily before injection). For the well-mixed ventilation, the inlet jet flow causes air recirculation in the room, and the jet velocity is significantly higher than the neighboring region. In this figure, elapsed times which represent the arrival of the droplet puff to some specific locations are labeled. For instances, under the well-mixed ventilation, the expiratory droplets takes approximately 0.5 s to reach the receptor's face, 2 s to reach the wall A, 5 s to the receptor's legs, 10 s to the wall B. All the above times mentioned refer to the elapsed times from the commencing of the droplet emitting process. As expected, the displacement ventilation exhibits a very different airflow pattern. Cooled, low velocity air flows at near floor level absorbing heat from the two occupants, and a vertical thermal plume dominates the airflow field in the boundary layer around each occupant. Droplet cloud takes approximately 7 s to reach the exhaust. Except for the mid-plane, the airflow velocity is fairly weak in all other regions. Although it is not the prime objective to study the statistical properties of the Lagrangian approach, a brief justification for the selection of the injection number seems necessary prior to discussing the results. Three injection numbers were tested; 3000, 10,000 and 90,000. Particles escaped through the outlet and deposited to the receptor's head region were recorded and counted. Inferring from Fig. 3 , there is no statistical difference between the results of 10,000 and 90,000 injections. Hence, 10,000 injections were selected for all Lagrangian simulations. Fig. 4 shows the combined results modeled by the drift-flux and Lagrangian approaches at the breathing plane and the mid-plane for 0.75 and 2 s elapsing from the commencing of the droplet emitting process. The high-speed droplet nuclei emitted from the mouth opening carry high momentum. They impact to the face of receptor directly resulting in significant particle loss. Inferring from the results, it can be observed that the two approaches predict fairly similar profiles, and the essential feature of the droplet dispersion is captured by the current Eulerian model. Fig. 5 depicts the mid-plane results for 0.01 mm and 10 mm droplets under both ventilation schemes at 5 and 10 s. It is found out that for the same ventilation scheme, the difference between the two droplet sizes is not significant. The two modeling approaches give close matches, but this time the number of particles tracked are much less than those in Fig. 3. As mentioned, the droplet dispersion depends on the bulk air movement and the physical properties of the droplet itself. The insignificant difference between two droplet sizes is attributed to the relatively short elapsed time presented here. Even for 10 mm droplets with unit density, the settling velocity is just 3 Â 10 À3 m s À1 , hence it needs very long time to distinguish the dispersion characteristics (cf. Fig. 7) . At those elapsed times reported, the droplet trajectories follow closely to the airflow pattern (cf. Fig. 2) . For instances at 5 s for well-mixed ventilation, the puff just arrives at the receptor's legs, and it matches very closely to the bulk airflow pattern. Once the droplets are emitted, due to the much lower surrounding airflow speed they encountered, the droplets start to decelerate to attain the same velocity as the surrounding air, and then thereafter considered to be airborne. Particle relaxation time (t) is used to characterize the time required for the particle to ''relax'' to become airborne where C c is Cunningham slip correction factor, d p is the droplet diameter, and m is the kinematics viscosity of air. For the present system, the relaxation time ranges from 10 À4 to 10 À10 s. With these negligible relaxation times, the droplets decelerate almost instantaneously, and hence the droplets follow closely the airflow. As expected the concentration profile is significantly different between the two ventilation schemes. For the well-mixed scheme, due to the much higher airflow velocity (in the x-direction) compared to the displacement scheme (2 m À1 s vs. 0.2 m s À1 ), the droplets reach the vertical wall A in approximately 2 s. After the impact, many droplets are deposited to the wall, and the rest follows the large recirculation eddy. The predictions are very different for the displacement ventilation. In contrast to the well-mixed scheme where the airflow in x-direction dominates, the velocity in x-direction is very slow for the displacement ventilation. Due to this characteristic, the transport of droplets in that direction is fairly weak, and the droplets move slowly to the exhaust outlet. Fig. 6 shows the dispersion at 50 s for the two ventilation schemes at the mid-plane; under the well-mixed scheme, 0.01 mm droplets are well-mixed, whereas large concentration gradient can still be observed under the displacement ventilation. In fact, the droplets do not disperse to most regions of the room until 270 s (refers to Fig. 7 ). Under such a single emission event studied here, droplets under displacement ventilation take approximately 14 times longer than that for the well-mixed ventilation to achieve moderate room dispersion. Some salient features regarding the two approaches are worth discussion. First, under the Lagrangian methodology each particle has a unique ID, and hence the position for each particle can be tracked throughout the entire simulation domain and time. In risk exposure applications, this feature seems attractive only for some cases such as to investigate the individual ''contribution'' of multiple sources. For a single source, particle tracking feature is not important most of the time. Instead, for many exposure assessments, the spatial and temporal concentration levels are the vital pieces of information needed. Due to its discrete phase nature, the post-processing of the Lagrangian simulation for the results shown in Figs. 4, 5 and 7 is not trivial. In these figures, a 1-cm thick ''slice'' is chosen and particles enclosed in the slice are counted. If a thicker slice is chosen, it cannot represent the correct spatial concentration; on the other hand, if the slice is too thin, there may be no particle contained. The selection is, however, quite arbitrary. There is one transformation methodology, called particle-source-in-cell (PSIC), which can convert the discrete particle trajectories into concentration (Crowe et al., 1977) . By using the residence time the particle stays in a pre-determined cell volume, the particle mass flow rate can be transformed to concentration. However, particle trajectories are still required prior to applying the transformation. This means that the accuracy of the transformation depends critically on the number of the injections. In contrast, since the droplet phase is treated as a continuum, the drift-flux approach can directly present the concentration magnitude over the entire spatial domain. This feature is very attractive for exposure assessment. Secondly, due to the nature of the governing equations resolved, direct comparison between Lagrangian and Eulerian results is impossible. Here a qualitative comparison is performed by counting the ''discrete particles'' in Fig. 5 and comparing to the scalar magnitude. Thirty three, 7, 17 and 10 are counted in the 1-cm slices of Figs. 5(a)-(d), respectively, and the trend is consistent with the scalar legend. In the future, more comprehensive comparison can be made by performing volume integration to get the spatial-average concentration. Fig. 7 depicts the mid-plane results by the Lagrangian and drift-flux approaches at 210 and 270 s. Since the droplets are already homogeneously mixed at 50 s for the well-mixed system which is presented in Fig. 5 , only the results for displacement ventilation are shown. Due to the relatively few suspended droplets, for those Lagrangian simulation results, the slice thickness is increased to 5 cm. Apparent difference between the 0.01 and 10 mm is observed at these two longer elapsed times. Sedimentation is observed for 10 mm particles as more droplets are found at the lower region, while for 0.01 mm particles no apparent settling is seen. In fact, a particle-free region is found for the 0.01 mm droplets. The same observation is found for the Lagrangian simulation for 10 mm: more discrete droplets can be found near ground level. Literature results have shown similar conclusions. A recent study also shows that 3 mm particle concentration in a chamber exhibits inhomogeneity, and can be attributed by the turbulent diffusion and gravity (Richmond-Bryant et al., 2006) . Chang et al. (2006) performed a detailed large eddy simulation on indoor particles under natural ventilation. He found out that, due to the larger inertia and gravitational settling, coarse particles (PM 10 ) can move easily from one circulation region to other ones while fine particles (PM 2.5 ) are easily influenced by the surrounding complex indoor air pattern. Based on the literature and the current results, it reveals that droplet nuclei may exhibit distinctive dispersion behavior, particularly for low airflow microenvironment. Approximately about 40% of droplets are less than 10 mm in terms of number (Nicas et al., 2005) . These droplets can still be inhaled and deposited deep to lungs. Hence, the present result has important implication; using passive gaseous as surrogates of droplet nuclei or applying the well-mixed assumption may cause incorrect exposure risk assessment results. In spite of the low relaxation time, deposition and gravitation effects may influence the accuracy if they are not properly taken into accounted.
