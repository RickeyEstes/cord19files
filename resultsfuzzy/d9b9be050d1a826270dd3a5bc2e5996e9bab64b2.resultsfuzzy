In this study the antiviral potential of twelve compounds (7, 8, 10, 11, (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) was evaluated in vitro for their inhibitory effect of SARS virus. Cytotoxicity in Vero E6 cells was measured before the antiviral activity. The compounds that showed cytotoxity to Vero E6 were weeded out first. The remainder was studied their inhibitory activity. Only compounds 17 and 19 could inhibit the replication of SARS virus in Vero E6 cells in concentration ≤ 0.5 mg ml -1 (2.05 mM). There was no cytotoxicity to Vero E6 in concentration ≥ 2 mg ml -1 (8.20 mM) ( Table 3 ). It showed that both of them could inhibit SARS virus in vitro. Compounds 17 and 19 clearly inhibited the cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by infection with SARS-CoV ( Fig. 1 ). As compared with cinanserin which inhibits SARS virus at 66 μM (IC 90 ) [20] , the result in our research seems to be not so good. But the concentration 0.5 mg ml -1 is not the terminal of the inhibition, because our research could not undergo in present situation in our country. The methoxy stilbene derivatives (7, 8, 10, 11, 14) showed no cytotoxity. Compounds 7 and 10, which were methyl ethers of compounds 17 and 19, respectively, could inhibit 50% replication of SARS virus in Vero E6 cells in concentration 1 mg ml -1 . Compounds 8, 11 and 14 had no inhibition in the evaluation. Although compounds 17 and 19 had one same part, the compound 21 that had the same part showed no activity. It seemed that the whole molecular structure was necessary to the inhibitory activity and hydroxy group was prior to methoxy group. However, the structure-activity relationship was still unclear in our present study. Maybe the further research will reveal the relationship between the substituent and activity (Tables 1 and 2).
