Our case-control study genotyped the 4 SNPs IFN-γ +874A/T, TNF-α -308G/A, IL-10 -1082G/A and -592A/C in 476 Chinese patients with SARS and 449 healthy controls. The genotype distributions and allele frequencies of these 4 SNPs were shown in Table 2 . The IFN-γ +874A allele was overrepresented in SARS patients (83.1%) when compared with the controls (66.3%) (P < 0.001). It was also significantly associated with susceptibility to SARS in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.001), i.e. individuals with IFN-γ +874 AA and AT genotype had an odds ratio (OR) of 5.19 (95% CI, 2.78-9.68) and 2.57 (95% CI, 1.35-4.88) in developing SARS respectively. However, no significant correlation was observed in SNPs of IL-10 and TNF-α. All SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) (P > 0.05) in SARS patients and controls by chi square test, except IL-10-592A/C. IFN-γ +874A allele has been previously reported to be associated with infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B virus infection, and parvovirus infection [20] [21] [22] , revealing its potential role of function in host defense against microbial infections. The mechanism by which the IFN-γ +874A/T allele influences the susceptibility to SARS may depend on its role in the regulation of IFN-γ production. The T allele of IFN-γ +874A/T provides a binding site for the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which is able to regulate IFN-γ expression [23] . It is possible that low IFN-γ production may impair their anti-viral response against SARS-CoV, rendering these individuals more susceptible to this virus infection. Our observation that IFN-γ +874A allele was significantly associated with SARS-CoV infection suggests a genetic risk factor for SARS. The role of IFN-γ in antiviral response against SARS-CoV has also been supported by recent studies showing that IFN-γ can inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV in combination with IFN-β in vitro [24, 25] . IL-10 and TNF-α SNPs were also included in this study. They were chosen due to their potential regulation on protein expression level [26] [27] [28] . However, our present data did not show any significant association of these SNPs with SARS (Table 2) . Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the role of IL-10 and TNF-α as the susceptibility genes for SARS, because other SNPs in these 2 genes may also be involved in gene expression regulation. Further association studies on other SNPs, which could alter the gene expression level are required to ascertain the relationship of IL-10 and TNF-α in SARS. We have also compared the genotype and allele frequencies of all the polymorphisms between the death group and survival group of the SARS patients (Table 3) . However, no significant association was established.
