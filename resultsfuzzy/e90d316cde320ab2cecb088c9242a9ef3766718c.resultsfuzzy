The mean interval between CXR and LDCT was 3.1 ± 6.3 hours. The mean radiation dose for LDCT exams was 0.24 ± 0.15 mSv, which is comparable to 2-3 chest radiographs (average  dose posteroanterior and lateral chest radiograph: 0.1 mSv). [9] None of the patients experienced adverse events as a result of LDCT scanning or chest radiography. Eight CXRs (11.9%) were indicative of pneumonia, 4 CXRs were false positive and 7 false negative as compared to the consensus diagnosis (Table 4 ). This resulted in a sensitivity of 36%, a specificity of 93%, a PPV of 50% and a NPV of 88% for CXR. None of the CXRs were suspect for IFD. Thirteen LDCT scans (19.4%) were suggestive of pneumonia. Compared to the consensus diagnosis, 5 LDCT scans were false positive and 3 false negative. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 73%, 91%, 62% and 94% respectively. (Table 4) Consensus diagnosis of the 5 false positive LDCT scans were phlebitis and in 4 cases fever of unknown origin. No HRCT scans were made because in all 5 patients the fever subsided within 48 hours after receiving broad spectrum antibiotics, therefore CXR was the only available imaging tool for the consensus meeting. Only one of the patients with a false positive LDCT had respiratory symptoms (cough), however a microbiological respiratory evaluation was negative. An uncontrolled McNemar's test showed no statistically significant difference in the proportion of scans positive for pulmonary infection between CXR and LDCT (p = 0.197), which was our primary endpoint. Inter-observer agreement was moderate for both CXR and LDCT (κ = 0.52 for CXR and κ = 0.52 for LDCT, respectively). Based on the consensus diagnosis 5 patients in this cohort were classified as either probable (n = 3) or possible (n = 2) IFD. The diagnosis of probable IFD was based on a positive BAL GM test in all cases and 2 out of 3 also had a positive serum GM test. Only 1 patient had a positive BAL culture (A. Versicolor). Four of the patients with IFD (3 probable, 1 possible) had a LDCT scan suspect for IFD on the first day of fever. In all these patients the abnormalities were also seen on the HRCT performed as part of the diagnostic workup for persistent fever (mean 3.5 days later than LDCT). (Fig 2) None of the patients diagnosed with pulmonary IFD had abnormalities on their CXR on the first day of fever, and only one had respiratory signs or symptoms. The diagnosis of possible IFD in the patient with a negative LDCT scan was based on abnormalities on HRCT made on day 4 of fever. Serum GM values were negative and bronchoscopy was not performed because of severe thrombocytopenia. Finally one LDCT scan with abnormalities suspect for IFD was considered false positive: the fever episode was classified as "fever of unknown origin".
