Firstly, the analytical specificity of RPA primers and LF-probes was performed by agarose-gel electrophoresis consulting recent studies [12] . We've especially noticed that when LF-probe is cut by nfo nuclease at the dSpacer position, the probe will be transformed into a primer for extension [9] . Therefore, the RPA product consists of two kinds: one amplified from the common F and R primers, and the other from the LF-probe and R. Two bands were thus observed in the electrophoresis (Fig. 1A) . Experiments have found that primer set F3/LF/R2 yielded highest amplification accuracy, producing products with an expected size of 311/210 base pairs (Fig. 1A) . This set also yielded a faster and darker LFD RT-RPA test line than others within 5 min (Fig. 1B) . Following reagent instruction (TwistDX), a temperature range of 30-48°C, and a time range of 5-30 min were tested. Results indicated that the reaction adapts to a wide temperature interval from 30 to 45°C, with the test band being the brightest in 38°C (Fig. 1C) . Therefore, 38°C was chosen as the approved reaction temperature for all latter LFD RT-RPA assays. As for time, distinct band could be seen in the test zone position for a range of 10-30 min (Fig. 1D) . Based on the results, time of incubation was controlled in 30 min in following LFD RT-RPA testing. In addition, analytical sensitivity of BPIV3 LFD RT-RPA was performed using the quantity of template (10-fold serial diluted, 10 7 to 10 1 copies per reaction). This result revealed that the minimum virus detection limits of LFD RT-RPA assay were as low as 100 copies per reaction ( Fig. 2A and B) . Next, the analytical specificity of the LFD RT-RPA was tested among other viral pathogens of cattle with similar clinical signs including BcoV, BRSV, BVDV, IBRV, BEFV and VSV. The results indicated that no cross-reactions of the BcoV, BRSV, BVDV, IBRV, BEFV and VSV were observed on the dipstick within 5 min ( Fig. 3A and B) . To check the quality of RNA/DNA preparations used for the specificity of the assay, we undertook PCR reaction firstly with positive primer of corresponding template respectively on 2% agarose gel (Fig. 3C) . The viral specific primers used in this study were following previously published by our laboratory [12] . Finally, the diagnostic performance of the LFD RT-RPA was compared to the RT-PCR or real-time qRT-PCR method by their respective sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and kappa coefficient. Results showed that LFD RT-RPA has a little higher sensitivity comparing with RT-PCR assay, and the positive rate was 22.11% (21/95) and 15.79% (15/95) ( Table 2) , respectively. When compared with the real-time qPCR method, the established LFD RT-RPA has similar sensitivity comparing with qPCR assay. The positive rate of LFD RT-RPA and qPCR assays was 22.11% (21/95) and 20.00% (19/95) (Table 3) , respectively, and yielded 100% sensitivity, 67.19% specificity and 100% negative predictive value (NPV) and 0.5720 kappa coefficient. The LFD RT-RPA assay has the advantages of rapidness: nucleic acid amplification can be completed within 20-30 min; convenience: operating at a lower temperature (RT: 37°C; RPA: 38°C), and economical value: lower dependence on thermal cycling equipment and specialized operations. With the combination of nucleic acid purification technology independent of a laboratory, LFD RT-RPA assay may be suggested as an alternative point-of-care diagnostics in resource limited settings [22, 23] . Since for the major part of the reaction, simple heat source system, such as chemical heaters, water bath or even body heat could be employed [22] [23] [24] . These partial simulations of conditions in the field have all posed the future potentials of LFD RT-RPA assay as a rapid, efficient and exact field test for diagnosis of BPIV3.
