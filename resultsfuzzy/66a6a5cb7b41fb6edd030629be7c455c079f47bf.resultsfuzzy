More than 70 million reads were obtained for each sample group after trimming of low quality reads. The retained reads were mapped to the reference sequence and 45-46% of reads were mapped (Table 1) . Differential expression analysis identified 5621 genes as deregulated in cells from peritoneal exudates of cats with experimentally-induced FIP. Among those genes, 956 showed equal or more than 2 Log Fold Change (Log 2 FC) and 1589 genes showed ≤ −2 Log 2 FC.
