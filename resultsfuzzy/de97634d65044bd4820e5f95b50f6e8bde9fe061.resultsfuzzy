MotA protein of bacteriophage T4 has been found to be a transcription activator that binds to DNA (Gerber and Hinton, 1996) and the far-C-terminal region of the sigma70 subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (Pande et al., 2002) . The top hit of SVMProt predicted functional class for this protein is the DNA-binding, which matches with literature-described functions. Bovine rotavirus is a double-stranded RNA virus that is naked. Thus, the outer capsid protein VP4 of bovine rotavirus (serotype 10/strain B223) is located at the viral surface acting as part of the viral coat (Hardy et al., 1992) . This protein is predicted by SVMProt as a coat protein that is consistent with literature-described function. The other 14 proteins are enzymes, and these are all correctly assigned by SVMProt to the respective enzyme EC class. Because these proteins have no homolog of known function in the SwissProt entries of Swissprot database based on PSI-BLAST search, our study suggests that SVMProt has certain level of capability for providing useful hint about the functional class of novel proteins with no or low homology to known proteins, and this capability is not based on sequence similarity or clustering. The overall accuracy of 72% for the assignment of the novel viral proteins is smaller, but not too far away, than that of 87% for SVMProt functional class assignment of 34 582 proteins. This indicates certain level of the sequence-similarityindependent nature of SVM protein classification. Several factors may affect the accuracy of SVMProt for functional characterization of novel plant proteins. One is the diversity of protein samples used for training SVMProt. It is likely that not all possible types of proteins, particularly those of distantly related members, are adequately represented in some protein classes. This can be improved along with the availability of more protein data. Not all distantly related proteins of the same function have similar structural and chemical features. There are cases in which different functional groups, unconserved with respect to position in the primary sequence, mediate the same mechanistic role, due to the flexibility at the active site (Todd et al., 2002) . This plasticity is unlikely to be sufficiently described by the physicochemical descriptors currently used in SVMProt. Therefore, SVMProt in the present form is not expected to be capable of classification of these types of distantly related enzymes. Some of the SVMProt functional classes are at the level of families and superfamilies that may include a broad spectrum of proteins. It has been shown that SVM works not as well as HMM for distinguishing proteins in a superfamily, but may be more accurate with subfamily discrimination (Karchin et al., 2002) . Thus, the use of some large families and superfamilies as the basis for classification may affect the prediction accuracy of SVMProt to some extent. SVMProt prediction may be further improved by using protein subfamilies as the basis of classification, more comprehensive set of protein samples, and more refined protein descriptors. SVMProt optimization procedure and feature vector selection algorithm may also be improved by adding additional constraints, and by incorporating independent component analysis and kernel PCA in the preprocessing steps.
