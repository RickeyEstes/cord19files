ABRD is a fairly frequent syndrome in cattle herds, as nearly 10% of the farms were affected at least once during the period November 2000-October 2001. The herd-level incidence of ABRD was 35% in the study of Norstrom et al. (2000) , but in Norway no specific ABRD virus occurs endemically, consequently the susceptible population is larger than in France where ABRD outbreaks occur annually. According to our study, ABRD was clustered in space and time, with clusters corresponding to the areas with the highest ABRD cumulative incidence at farm level. These clusters were not explained by the risk factors herd size or type of production as these risk factors varied in space but had no space-time interaction. ABRD clustering suggested a common infectious agent in the epidemic of those specific regions, but since no serological tests were performed, it was not possible to determine which agents were involved. As ABRD is multifactorial and its causative agents ubiquitous, no specific reporting or control measure is required in France when a farm is affected. Consequently the infection can easily spread to the surroundings farms. ABRD mainly occurred during the colder months, suggesting the influence of conditions like low temperatures, high humidity, and high population densities (Callan and Garry, 2002) . The risk of ABRD was significantly associated with production type. Dairy herds presented a higher risk than beef herds, this outcome being consistent with previously published results (Norstrom et al., 2000) . Steer/young bull rearing and calf-rearing farms were less affected than beef herds, but as these types of production were usually considered separately in other studies, the betweenstudies comparison was not easy. The influence of production type could be explained by different management practices, and especially by the housing system, as beef cattle are more frequently raised in open-range conditions, with a lower burden of respiratory pathogens and airborne contaminants such as dust particles, ammonia and endotoxins (Callan and Garry, 2002) . Herd size was also involved in ABRD occurrence, larger herds having a higher risk, in accordance with previously published results (Norstrom et al., 2000; van der Fels-Klerx et al., 2000) . This effect could be due to more numerous animalto-animal contacts, increase in inter-farm human traffic, and potential higher animal densities, all these characteristics being important risk factors for the infection (Callan and Garry, 2002) . BRD vaccination was associated with syndrome occurrence, and farms with a higher use of vaccination were more affected. But this relation should probably be explained in a converse way, i.e. the farmers having experienced an outbreak of ABRD were more prone to practice BRD vaccination. As we did not collect the date of vaccination with our survey, this hypothesis could not be demonstrated. The study intended to propose a nation-wide scheme on how to describe epidemiological characteristics of ABRD. The use of the MAF animal survey to collect and analyze health data, a new concept in France, showed its ability to provide useful information concerning ABRD and potentially other diseases (Barnouin and Berger, 1988) . Moreover, the cost of the performed survey was quite low as it used a pre-existing study scheme and only consisted in adding a very small number of questions to a farm questionnaire dealing with general herd characteristics. Nevertheless, the survey we performed should be conducted regularly for a dynamic and more accurate vision of disease trends, the present preliminary work aiming to build baseline data to evaluate annual risk of ABRD. The spatial and temporal patterns of the respiratory syndrome evolve every winter, but a significant amount of information could be learnt from the past years to better deal with the epidemic in the following years.
