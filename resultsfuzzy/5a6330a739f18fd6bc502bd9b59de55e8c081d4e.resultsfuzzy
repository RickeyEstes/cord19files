The risk score derived from admission demographics alone yielded an AUC of 58 ± 0.002 % to forecast future CRI. Adding the initial VS improved the AUC to 64 ± 0.003 %, and with further adding the 4-hr risk score the AUC became 67 ± 0.002 %. Conclusions: A predictive model which incorporates patient data as it becomes available, including a risk score derived within the first Introduction: Physical activity / rehabilitation forms a pivotal aspect of recovery after critical illness and studies have demonstrated it is safe, feasible and potentially efficacious at improving patient outcomes [1, 2] . However, international data demonstrate low levels of mobilisation occur in the ICU [3, 4] . A current gap exists between the perceived need and actual practice of implementing physical activity across the recovery continuum. Objectives: To identify, evaluate and synthesise studies examining the barriers and enablers for patients with critical illness to participate in physical activity from the perspective of healthcare providers, patients and caregivers. Methods: Systematic review of articles using electronic databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Scopus and Cochrane. Quantitative and qualitative studies which assessed the barriers, or enablers to physical activity for patients with critical illness were included. Registered on PROSPERO (number: CRD42016035454). Results: 79 studies were included. Studies included primarily ICU survivors (69 %, n = 54 studies), healthcare providers (29 %, n = 23 studies) with only one study specifically examining caregivers and patients. Barriers and enablers to physical activity were identified (5 major themes and 28 sub-themes). Patient-level barriers included physical capability (physiological stability, illness severity, sedation, weakness, delirium), psychological influences (fear/motivation) and perceived relevance. Healthcare provider barriers included lack of time/ knowledge and expertise, communication, and concern for line safety. Environmental barriers included lack of resources (staffing and equipment), lower prioritisation, and lack of an established rehabilitation pathway post ICU. Enablers included: presence of mobility teams/ protocols, designated discipline and overall leaders, teamwork and development of daily care plans. Conclusions: This systematic review has identified the volume of literature demonstrating that barriers and enablers to physical activity are multi-dimensional and span diverse factors. These factors need to be considered when developing rehabilitation interventions to facilitate cultural change in rehabilitation practices across the recovery continuum. within the interdisciplinary team, involvement of nurses in EOL, active DM by physicians, and ethical awareness) yielded 4 climates: good, average with and average without involvement of nurses at EOL, and fourth a poor EOL-DM climate. When looking at overall perceptions, there were for all seven factors significant differences (p < 0.001) between nurses and physicians, with physicians consistently perceiving the EOL-DM climate as more positive as nurses. The largest differences were found in regard to physician leadership (median factor scores -0.09 for nurses and 0.61 for physicians, respectively), interdisciplinary reflection (medians -0.03 and 0.51) and not avoiding EOL decisions (medians -0.07 and 0.37). When looking at differences within the 4 types of EOL-DM, the same general pattern was found, and all differences were statistically significant (p < 0.001). The differences were largest in the two lowest types of EOL-DM: average without nurses and poor EOL-DM climate. Head nurses generally had a more positive perception of EOL-DM climate compared to other nurses, and senior physicians had a more positive perception than junior physicians. When comparing nurses (without including head nurses) and junior physicians, the physicians still had a significantly higher perception of EOL-DM, except for "Mutual respect within the interdisciplinary team" (p = 0.26). Physicians having a more positive perception of EOL-DM compared to nurses were found within all 13 participating countries and within the individual ICU's. Introduction: There is increasing recognition of the need for comprehensive expertise in the management of EOLC in the ICU. However there appear to be many controversies between professionals regarding optimal provision. Objectives: As a component of a local, on-going quality improvement process in this area, we performed a survey of nurses' perceptions of aids and obstacles to the optimal provision of EoLC. Methods: We modified a previously validated survey tool 1 and anglicised the language. Nurses were asked to rate both the size and frequency of 20 possible obstacles and 14 possible aids to providing EoLC using a 6 point Likert scale (0-5). The survey was distributed to 120 nursing staff on one adult general critical care unit in March 2015. Confidentiality was assured. For each obstacle and aid, the median and interquartile ranges were determined for the size and frequency. To determine the effect size of each obstacle and aid, the median of the size was multiplied by the median of the frequency. These were then themed Results: Sixty surveys were returned representing a 50 % return rate. Conclusions: This study has highlighted the need to proactively identify a family liaison to cascade information to friends and relatives to allow nurses to concentrate on care delivery. Despite having a poor unit design and lack of privacy, nurses feel they can provide a dignified death and feel that multidisciplinary agreement is an important part of this process. Mean length of stay (LOS) was prolonged and level of organ support was high. These results are summarised in Table 25. LOT was instigated in 9 (11.5 %) patients. Age and APACHE II scores were similar in patients with LOT and those with none. Frail patients had a higher LOS and received more organ support compared to non-frail patients. The proportion of patients with LOT remained low despite an increasing LOS. Communication between team members was sub-standard with 33 % of bedside nurses and 44 % of residents being unaware of these decisions. The re-audit after intervention demonstrated an increase in patients receiving LOT, with a higher proportion of frail patients being represented. These patients also received less organ support and LOT was instigated earlier in their stay. Awareness regarding these decisions amongst all staff improved to 100 %. Feedback regarding the communication tools was excellent. Introduction: Previous studies showed that low nurse staffing levels were associated with poor outcomes and increased occurrence of adverse events. However, national data are scarce regarding the relationship between the nurse staffing ratio and pediatric patient outcomes. Objectives: To investigate the association between nurse staffing levels and the outcome of pediatric patients in Korean intensive care units (ICUs). Methods: This retrospective cohort study used data from National Health Insurance claims. The included patients were under 18 years old and admitted to ICUs (but not neonatal ICUs) between August 2009 and September 2014. The ICU nurse staffing was graded into nine levels according to the total bed to nurse ratio for each hospital (National Health Insurance policy). The lowest and highest bed-to-nurse ratios were 0.5:1 and 2:1, respectively. We inspected the differences between overall patient mortality and the nursing staff grades at discharge. We also analyzed the mortality of patients who underwent mechanical ventilator care for more than 3 hours according to the nursing staff grades. Results: During the study period, 39,917 medical and surgical pediatric patients were admitted to the ICUs. Mechanical ventilation was administered to 45.9 % of these patients. The median (interquartile range) ICU length of stay was 2 (1-6) days. The overall hospital mortality rate was 5.5 %, and the mortality rate of mechanically ventilated patients was 10.8 %. About half of the patients (18,053; 45.2 %) received the highest grade ICU treatment. The overall mortality rate did not increase with a higher bed-to-nurse ratio (i.e., lower nurse staffing level). However, a trend toward increased mortality was observed in mechanically ventilated patients as the bed-to-nurse ratio increased. The mortality of mechanically ventilated patients was 7.6 % for a bed-to-nurse ratio < 0 Conclusions: EK is common in critically ill patients, and is associated with mechanical ventilation and lagophthalmos. A simple protocol substantially reduced the incidence of EK and was easily achieved in clinical practice. Introduction: The loss of muscle mass in critical illness is caused by a mismatch between synthesis and degradation, where synthesis is near-normal, while degradation is enhanced, resulting in a negative protein balance. A muscle mass loss of 10 % per week is reported. Studies supporting this mechanism are almost exclusively from patients during the initial two weeks of critical illness. Objectives: To investigate if this mechanism is valid also in a longer time perspective we studied critical ill patients during days 10-40 of ICU stay. Methods: Critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation (n = 20) were included, multiple times if possible. In total 30 measurements of muscle protein turnover were performed employing a 3-pool model technique with a constant infusion of d5-phenylalanine, leg blood flow measurements, and biopsies to determine tissue enrichments. Results: Net protein balance of leg mixed muscle showed a pattern of becoming less negative over time with regression analyses. This pattern was totally attributable to an increase in protein synthesis rate, while protein breakdown rate, although higher than in healthy subjects, was completely unaltered over time. Net protein balance during days 10-20 (-21 ± 21 nmol phenylalanine/min/100 g muscle) was lower (p = 0.002; T-test) than during days 30-40 (1 ± 11 nmol phenylalanine/min/100 g muscle). Conclusions: The temporal pattern of protein turnover in leg muscle showed a pattern of diminished protein losses over time in surviving patients staying in the ICU. How this pattern relates to nutrition, mobilization, and pharmacology remains to be established. Introduction: Critically ill patients exhibit a high degree of vitamin C deficiency at ICU admission and plasma concentrations decrease even more during the following days [1, 2] . High intravenous (iv) doses of vitamin C are required to increase plasma concentrations to normal and supra-normal ranges [2] , but the optimal dosage regime in this population remains unclear. Prolonged vitamin C administration may be associated with oxalate kidney stone formation, but the effect of short-term high-dose supplementation on urinary oxalate excretion is unknown. Study design and objectives: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial to determine the pharmacokinetics of four high dose regimes of iv Vitamin C in critically ill patients and to measure oxalate excretion. Patients:. Adult patients admitted to the ICU with sepsis or SIRS, with a non-neurological sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score >6 and an expected length of ICU stay >96 hours.
