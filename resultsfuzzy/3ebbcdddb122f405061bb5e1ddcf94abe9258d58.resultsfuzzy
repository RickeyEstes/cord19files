To determine the SARS-CoV M pro and SARS-CoV-2 M pro substrate preferences, we natural and over 100 unnatural amino acids, Figure 1 ). We incorporated glutamine at the P1 position, because the available crystal structures of SARS-CoV M pro revealed that only glutamine (and, at a very small number of cleavage sites, histidine) residue can occupy the S1 pocket of this enzyme. [9, 12] The imidazole of His163, located at the very bottom of the S1 proteases, which explains less stringent specificity. [11] The S2 pocket can form hydrophobic interactions with P2 residues that are not only limited to leucine. The S3 pocket of SARS M pro . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

The S4 pocket can be occupied by small residues due to crowded cavity formed by Pro168, L167 at the bottom and T190, A191 at the top wall.

Then, we measured the rate of substrate hydrolysis relevant to each protease (Figure 3) . The data clearly demonstrate that SARS-CoV M pro and SARS-CoV-2 M pro exhibit the same activity toward tested substrates. The results are consistent with the HyCoSuL screening data. The most preferred substrate, Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-ACC, is composed of the best amino acids in each position. Kinetic parameters were determined for the two best substrates (Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-ACC, Ac-Thz-Tle-Leu-Gln-ACC) and one containing the best recognized natural amino acids (Ac-Val-Lys-Leu-Gln-ACC) ( Table 1 ) toward SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Due to substrates precipitation due to high concentration needed in the assay, kinetic parameters toward SARS-CoV M pro could not be determined. Analysis of kinetic parameters revealed that these three substrates differ in the k cat value, while K M values are comparable.

In summary, we established substrate specificity profiles at the P4-P2 positions of the SARS-CoV M pro and SARS-CoV-2 M pro proteases using a combinatorial approach. Our data clearly demonstrate that these two enzymes display very similar substrate preferences.
