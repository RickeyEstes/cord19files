To represent the non-uniformity of a concentration field, the coefficient of variation, CV i ðtÞ, of concentration is defined as (Mage and Ott, 1996)  where C i ðtÞ is the volume averaged concentration, C i (t) is the concentration at elapsed time t at each sample point and N is the number of sample points. In case of non-uniform mixing, a useful parameter, the mixing time, is used to quantify the time needed to reach a well-mixed state. It is defined as the time at which the coefficient of variation becomes o10% permanently since the release of pollutant. Fig. 3 presents the coefficients of variation of the three particle sizes. Inferring from the results, it can be shown that CV strongly depends on the particle size and airflow; small size and high airflow favor mixing. One thing should be noted is that the mixing characteristics of 0.3 and 1 mm are very close whereas very distinct difference can be observed for 1 and 7 mm particles. As the gravitational settling magnitude is a function of particle size with an exponent of 2, sedimentation influences the mixing and dispersion rates (Fig. 2) in a non-linear way; in the results presented, the distinct behavior of 7 mm particles is observed. For Lagrangian model, the results presented are very different. Since particles are treated as a discrete and not a continuum phase, concentration contour does not exist. Another factor further complicates the issue is the computer resources required for Lagrangian model. Due to the current limitation of computational resources, almost all Lagrangian models inject particles momentarily and track the individual particle based on the forces exerted. Because of the transient in nature and the validity of the well mixed (discussed above), these pose limitation for presenting the results obtained from Lagrangian approach. In the literature, the parameter decay rate loss coefficient is often used to characterize the particle removal rate in an enclosure. The decay rate coefficient is derived from the mass balance principle where well-mixed condition is assumed. This has a significant implication on the application of particle decay rate coefficient for quantifying the fate of particles in a non-well-mixed enclosures and it must be used cautiously (Bouilly et al., 2005) . Hence for Lagrangian framework, another common approach, which counts the number of particles remaining in the domain versus time, is adapted . The particle deposition fraction, Z, is defined as where N in and N out are the numbers of particles released at the inlet and the number of particles exited from the outlet, respectively. As observed in Fig. 4 , the original EIM without correction overpredicts particle deposition rate noticeably, particularly for 0.3 and 1 mm particles at the high ventilation rate. The turbulent intensity is stronger for the high-velocity case. If the correction scheme is not applied, the original EIM tends to give more severe over-prediction for the high-velocity case. Generally, the deposition fractions predicted with the correction are closer to the semi-empirical equation (Lai and Nazaroff, 2000) . Thus far we have highlighted the main features of two models developed recently and results are presented separately. It is very valuable to quantify the simulation results by a same parameter. In velocities are shown. Overall speaking, the results modeled by the two approaches agree well with each other; as the particle size increases, the deposition fraction increases. For submicron particles, the deposition fractions predicted by Lagrangian (without near-wall turbulent correction) is higher than those predicted with correction and Eulerian drift flux prediction follows. Deposition fraction for 0.45 m s À1 is also higher than the case of 0.225 m s À1 . This is because for submicron particles, the deposition is significantly affected by turbulent diffusion and it is stronger for the high-velocity case. For supermicron particles scenario, the discrepancy between Eulerian and Lagrangian increases with particle size, however, is not significant. One thing should be noted is that as the particle size increases, the influence of the turbulent correction diminishes. These observations can be explained by the dominant fate mechanism for this size range of particles. As particle size increases, deposition by gravitational settling increases significantly and the other effect, i.e. turbulent diffusion, becomes less important. It must be careful when direct comparison is attempted to be made. As discussed above that the injection type for Eulerian is continuous while for Lagrangian, the injection is momentarily. For steady-state condition such as Eulerian model, the parameter deposition velocity can be used to quantify the deposition rate in a more rigorous way, while for Lagrangian framework, using deposition velocity as a parameter is not an obvious means. On the other hand, the deposition fraction cannot be used to quantify the deposition onto various orientated surfaces, however, it can be used to characterize both models. The current study focuses on an empty chamber so some comments on practical applications should be addressed. The author has published one article regarding the effects of room furnishing on particle deposition rates indoors (Thatcher et al., 2002) . The experimental results showed that increasing the surface area from bare to fully furnished increased the deposition loss rate with the latest increase seen for 0.5 mm particles. It can be attributed to the additional surfaces available for diffusion loss. The current models can be applied to both empty and furnished room with proper boundary conditions.
