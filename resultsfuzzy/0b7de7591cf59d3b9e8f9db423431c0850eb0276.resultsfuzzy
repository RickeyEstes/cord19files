In this section we need some notation: for t > 0, ξ(t) is the random number of individuals infected by an infectious individual in the first t time units of his or her infectious period. Thus, ξ(t) is a non-decreasing random process. Furthermore, define µ(t) = E(ξ(t)) as the expectation of ξ(t). It is clear that µ(t) is also non-decreasing. For ease of exposition we assume that the derivative of µ(t) exists and is given by β(t). Thus µ(t) = t 0 β(s)ds. This assumption is not necessary and the results below can be generalized in a straightforward way to the case where µ(t) is not differentiable. From the theory of branching processes [1] , we know that R 0 = µ(∞) = ∞ 0 β(s)ds. In general there is no explicit expression for the Malthusian parameter α, only the implicit equation specifying α If R 0 > 1 (the situation we are interested in), this equation has exactly one real positive solution [1, p. 10] , and serves as a definition of α. If the length of the infectious period of an individual is distributed as the random variable I, and during his or her entire infectious period he or she infects other individuals at rate λ (that is, the infections form a homogeneous Poisson process with intensity λ), then β(t) = λP(I > t). This gives that ( Here we have used the standard equality ∞ 0 P(X > t)dt = E(X) for any non-negative random variable X (e.g. [5, Sec. 4.3] ). From now on, for reasons of clarity, we assume that I has a density which is denoted by f I (t). We may relax these assumptions without further consequences. We deduce that where φ I (α) = ∞ 0 e −αt f I (t)dt = E(e −αI ) is the Laplace transform of I or, which is the same, the moment-generating function of −I. Equation (3) gives an implicit equation for α. If an infected individual only starts being infectious after a random latent period which is distributed as L and has density f L (t), and after this period he or she is infectious for another, independent, period which is distributed as I, during which he or she infects others at rate λ, then which is the convolution of f L (t) and β 0 (t), where β 0 (t) is the derivative of E(ξ(t)) when the latent period is 0. This leads to where we have used the same computations as in (2) . We note that R 0 is independent of the latent period. Similarly we deduce that where φ L is the Laplace transform of the random variable L. If L does not have a density the results above still hold. Note that if L = 0 with probability 1, then φ L (α) = 1 and we obtain (3) again.
