In vitro experiments showed that murine IRF5 re-expressed in 4T1 cells did not affect cell proliferation but reduced cell migration by around 30% and invasion by 50%. In vivo experiments examining IRF5-mediated tumor immunity showed a significant increase in 4T1 primary tumor growth and metastasis in Irf5 -/-BALB/c mice (10-fold bioluminescence intensity; 3-fold increase in metastatic nodules) as compared to wild-type littermates. Conclusion: These data show that restoring murine IRF5 expression in murine mammary tumor cells inhibits cell migration and invasion, supporting similar tumor suppressor functions for murine IRF5 as seen with human IRF5. Similarly, IRF5 expression in the whole animal is important for regulating the establishment of primary tumors as well as metastasis to secondary sites. Together, these data indicate that IRF5 acts as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer through intrinsic control of tumor cell migration/invasion and extrinsic regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment. Thus, determining the pathways and mechanisms by which IRF5 influences tumor progression and tumor immunity will lead to the discovery of new biomarkers for prognosis and molecular targets for the treatment of breast cancer. nervous system neoplasms. Although advances in surgery, radiation and chemotherapy have improved overall survival, the lifelong sequelae of these treatments represents a major health care burden for patients, parents, and society. Recent progress in the molecular subtyping of medulloblastoma have revealed at least four distinct subsets of tumours (WNT, sonic hedgehog (SHH), Group 3 and Group 4) with dramatically different biology. Analysis of gene expression data reveal that elevated STAT3 expression correlates with significantly worse overall survival of medulloblastoma patients. Methods: To define the role of STAT3 in development and progression of SHH medulloblastoma we crossed two independent mouse models of medulloblastoma to mice lacking STAT3 from the granule cell neurons which is the cell of origin of medulloblastoma. To identify STAT3 dependent pathways that can be targeted therapeutically we screened phospho-protein antibody array and compound libraries. Results: Conditional deletion of STAT3 specifically in cerebellar granule cells provides a significant survival advantage in mouse models of SHH medulloblastoma. Intriguingly, this protection is almost completely restricted to males. Our phospho-protein arrays and compound libraries converge on those pathways required for proliferation and cell cycle which may prove to be viable therapeutic options for the treatment of medulloblastoma. Conclusion: Elevated STAT3 expression correlates with poor overall survival of medulloblastoma patients. Conditional of STAT3 from the cell of origin in two independent mouse models of SHH medulloblastoma provides a significant survival advantage specifically in males. Moreover, we identify compounds that specifically kill medulloblastoma tissue in a STAT3-dependent manner. Introduction: PD-1/PD-L1 signaling is critical for the negative regulation of the immune response to colorectal cancer (CRC) progression, but little is known about the process by which these proteins are expressed aberrantly in the tumor microenvironment [1] . Moreover, conventional RNAi screening conducted in twodimensional (2D) monoculture methods are lacking in physiological relevance; a limitation that may be improved by recapitulating the tumor microenvironment in three-dimensional (3D) assay systems containing multiple cell types found in vivo [2] . Therefore, we hypothesized that RNAi screening for genes that are responsible for the negative regulation of the immune response would yield different results when the tumor microenvironment is recapitulated (3D) versus in monolayer culture (2D). These results could drastically impact the process of target identification and drug discovery by improving the reliability of hit selection. Methods: The Ambion Silencer Ò Select Human Kinase siRNA Library V4 was screened in 3D in Corning 384 Well Black Clear Round Bottom Ultra-Low Attachment Spheroid Microplates against tumor spheroids comprised of a colorectal cancer cell line, DLD-1 (ATCC), at a density of 12.5 Â 10 3 cells/ml and a coculture of DLD-1 cells with murine fibroblasts, NIH3T3 (ATCC), at a 3:2 ratio (respectively) using a process of reverse transfection. Greiner Bio-One 384 Well Black Clear Flat Bottom Microplates were used for RNAi high-throughput screening in 2D using the same cell lines and similar conditions. Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent was used according to manufacturer's protocols for efficient delivery of siRNA and plasmid expressing PD-L1 and a T cell receptor activator. Tumor spheroids were incubated for 16 h with recombinant Jurkat T cells 48 h posttransfection. These Jurkat cells express the firefly luciferase gene under the control of NFAT response elements with constitutive expression of human PD-1 (BPS Bioscience). Promega's ONE-Glo Luciferase Assay System was used for measurement of luciferase activity, while Promega's CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay was used for measurement of viability. Luminescence was quantified by the EnVision Multilabel Plate Reader by Perkin Elmer. Results: Preliminary results from this robust, reproducible, assay suggest high transfection efficiencies, in both 2D and 3D, of siRNA and plasmid expressing PD-L1 and/or the TCR activator, introduced simultaneously. Conclusion: We believe that this high throughput screening assay system is one of the first of its kind, and will lend itself to the discovery of novel targets involved in the negative regulation of the immune system by cancers that express the immune checkpoint blockade protein PD-L1. Introduction: Tumor-targeted therapies that efficiently eliminate malignant cells and in the process engage the innate and adaptive immune system are desirable for preventing cancer recurrence. We have pioneered an oncolytic poliovirus therapy, PVSRIPO, which selectively targets and eliminates malignant cells. PVSRIPO is a recombinant polio:rhinovirus chimera, engineered to eliminate neuronal competence and is devoid of neuropathogenicity after intracerebral inoculation in non-human primates and in humans. PVSRIPO has cancer tropism due to widespread ectopic expression of the poliovirus receptor, CD155, in solid cancers. PVSRIPO is highly cytotoxic against malignant cells and is effective despite pre-existing neutralizing antibodies and viral cell killing proceeds in the presence of an active innate antiviral response. A first-in-human Phase-1 study with PVSRIPO at Duke University has shown remarkable promise in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM), a uniformly lethal disease. PVSRIPO tumor cell killing is associated with the induction of danger-and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs and PAMPs) via antiviral type I interferons (IFNs) and simultaneous non-lethal infection of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) via CD155. Type I IFNs are known to inhibit tumor proliferation, activate innate immune cells and bridge innate and adaptive immunity among other functions. Methods: To understand immune events associated with poliovirus infection of APCs, we examined the effects of PVSRIPO treatment on the human macrophage cell line (THP1) and primary human monocyte-derived DCs. PVSRIPO-treated DCs were evaluated for expression of maturation/activation markers and compared to untreated immature and mature DCs. Moreover, we assessed the PVSRIPO vaccine effect in an in vitro human immunotherapy assay. Human DCs generated from HLA-A2+ donor cells were incubated with PVSRIPO-induced tumor cell lysate and then used to stimulate autologous T cells in vitro followed by a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) assay. In addition, we performed in vivo studies in nude mice and PVR transgenic mice, utilizing four different cancer cell lines, DU145, Sum149, CT2A and EO771. Results: PVSRIPO infection of THP1 macrophages induces Mda5/ Stat1 and Stat1 phosphorylation and TNFa and IFNb release. Coculturing of DCs with PVSRIPO alone or PVSRIPO-induced tumor lysate stimulates DC activation and IL12 and TNFa production. Human DCs co-incubated with PVSRIPO-induced tumor cell lysate, stimulate tumor antigen-specific T cell responses in an in vitro human immunotherapy assay. These tumor-antigen specific T cells lysed tumor cell targets in an antigen-specific manner. PVSRIPO treated in vivo tumors showed increased innate and adaptive immune cell recruitment and were accompanied with increased mouse survival. Conclusion: Our data suggest that along with destruction of the primary tumor, oncolytic poliovirus mediates immune events. Importantly, we demonstrate that human DCs co-incubated with PVSRIPO-induced tumor cell lysate stimulate tumor antigen-specific T cell responses in an in vitro human immunotherapy assay. We have also shown that oncolytic poliovirus mediates immune events in xenograft as well as syngeneic, immunocompetent murine models of brain, breast and prostate cancer. Introduction: The Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS) family of proteins are critical negative feedback inhibitors of cytokine and growth factor signalling, helping to restore homeostasis and prevent excessive pathological responses. Whilst the biological role and molecular function SOCS3 and other members have been well resolved, SOCS5 remains poorly characterised. SOCS5 has been shown to regulate the EGFR in over-expression studies and may contribute to EGFR/Ras driven cellular transformation. The Drosophila homologue, Socs36E is also known to regulate both EGFR and JAK signalling in vivo. Methods: Mouse models of breast cancer have been used to identify and dissect the role of SOCS5 in this disease. We have performed bioinformatic analysis of SOCS5 gene expression from Oncomine, Kmplot, bcgenex and independent analysis of the TCGA breast data sets. Mass spectrometry was used to stringently identify candidate SOCS5 interacting proteins. The function of SOCS5 is currently been investigated in human and mouse breast cancer cell lines using siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies. Results: We show for the first time that in the Polyoma Middle T antigen (PyMT) driven mouse model of breast cancer, SOCS5deficient mice exhibit accelerated tumour onset relative to wildtype mice (53 d versus 70 d, respectively, p < 0.005), thus providing the first in vivo evidence that mammalian SOCS5 can act as a tumour suppressor. Analysis of expression databases indicates that SOCS5 is down regulated in a majority of patients with invasive ductal breast carcinoma (TCGA dataset, top 7% under-expressed genes, p = 2.53E-23) and SOCS5 expression level positively correlates with patient outcome. Using mass spectrometry, we have identified a number of known and novel SOCS5 interacting proteins, many of which include known drivers of human breast cancer. Conclusion: Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer related death of women. Whilst significant advances in disease treatment and diagnosis have improved patient outcome, resistance to therapy, metastasis and patients who do not respond to therapies have highlighted the complexity and heterogeneity of this disease. Further understanding of the signaling pathways and molecular events that lead to oncogenic transformation of the mammary gland is required. We have discovered that the poorly studied SOCS5 protein plays an important protective role in the PyMT mouse model of breast cancer. The number and type of interacting proteins identified by mass spectrometry suggests that SOCS5 is likely to form a signaling scaffold at via its largely unstructured N-terminal region. Dissection of the signaling complexes formed by SOCS5 and the mechanisms by which it regulates these targets to prevent excessive signaling in tumour cells is currently the subject of further investigation. mechanisms underlining a hypothetical mutual correlation between autophagy and proliferative processes in melanoma cell lines. Methods: M14 and 793 melanoma cell lines (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA) were grown in DMEM and RPMI 1640, respectively, supplemented with FBS, L-glutamine and Pen-Strep at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . In this study, M14 and 793 cells were starved by low serum treatment (0.1% FBS for 4, 8, 12 and 24 h), or by Rapamycin treatment at different concentrations (10, 50 , 75 and 100 nM) or Cloroquine (10 nM for 2, 5, 8 and 12 h). We first evaluated cell viability by MTT, and subsequently p-ERK, p-P70S6 kinase and LC3BII modulation were analyzed by Western Blot and/or IP assays. In addition, confocal and fluorescent microscopy were used to assess the LC3BII expression on M14 and 793 melanoma cells, undergoing 24 h of starvation or 2 h Cloroquine treatment. Results: On M14 and 793 cells undergoing starvation, Rapamycin or Cloroquine treatments showed a significant decrease of viability compared to control group. p-ERK western blots showed a significant modulation with strong ERK activation on M14 cells undergoing 12 h of starvation (p = 0.008) and on 793 melanoma cells after 8 h of starvation (p < 0.001) or 2 h cloroquine (p < 0.001). Western blot analysis didn't show a p-ERK modulation on M14 and 793 cells treated with Rapamycin. Furthermore, adopting as a positive control, M14 and 793 cells treated with EGF showed a significant increase of p-ERK expression comparable to the control group (p < 0.001), in a time-independent manner. Surprisingly enough, we observed a strong p-p70 expression both on M14 cell line undergoing 12 h and 24 h (p < 0.001) of starvation or treatment with 75 nM Rapamycin (p = 0.01) and with Cloroquine at different time course, 2 h (p = 0.02), 5 h (p = 0.01), 8 h (p = 0.003), and on 793 cells undergoing 12 h and 24 h of starvation (p = 0.01) or treatment with Cloroquine at 8 h and 12 h (p = 0.01) comparable to the control group. Regarding autophagic activation, western blot and confocal microscopy showed a slightly increase of LC3BII in M14 cells undergoing starvation or treated with 2 h of Cloroquine. Conversely 793 cells showed a LC3BII strong modulation, more evident on cells undergoing 24 h of starvation. Conclusion: These findings evidenced a correlation between proliferative and autophagic processes. In fact, we evidenced a higher activation for the following mediators: p-ERK on cells treated with 8 h of starvation and 2 h Cloroquine; p-p70 on cells treated with 12 and 24 h of starvation and with 8 and 12 h Cloroquine; LC3BII on cells undergoing to 12 and 24 h of starvation. These findings evidenced a key role of proliferative pathway in controlling autophagic process. Introduction: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major global health problem affecting tens of millions of people [1] . It is a chronic irreversible lung disease characterized by abnormal enlargement of airspaces (emphysema), obstruction of the airways and chronic bronchitis, and persistent macrophage-rich inflammation. Progressive and permanent destruction of the lung parenchyma and airway thickening leads to unremitting breathlessness and disability. The presence of disease comorbidities, including infection susceptibility, metabolic syndrome, muscle wasting and osteoporosis, further reduce quality of life [2] . Alveolar macrophages are believed to play a key role by secreting factors that exacerbate inflammation and cause irreversible tissue damage. Treatment of COPD involves the use of bronchodilators and potent immunosuppressive drugs, which are only partially effective at managing symptoms and is not curative, thus there is a significant unmet clinical need to develop novel treatments [3] . Cytokine inhibition is an attractive target in COPD, as a multitude of cytokines have been linked to disease severity. Our results indicate that TRBP is phosphorylated in response to cell stress, and this change in phosphorylation status significantly enhances TRBP's ability to efficiently inhibit PKR. This increase in TRBP's inhibition of PKR is further supported by our results which show that TRBP phosphorylation directly enhances TRBP's interaction with PKR while weakening TRBP-TRBP homodimer formation. , the effect of IL-3 on the  differentiation of preosteoblasts is unclear and we have investigated  the same using preosteoblastic cell line, MC3T3 -E1. The current study will help us to understand the role of IL-3 in regulating osteogenic differentiation, and also its anabolic potential for the treatment of bone disorders like osteoporosis and arthritis. Methods: The effect of IL-3 on proliferation of preosteoblasts was checked by MTT assay. Osteogenesis was assessed by matrix mineralization assay followed by Alizarin Red S quantitation. The expression of various osteogenic genes was evaluated by both Reverse Transcriptase-(RT) and Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). Western blotting was performed for the assessment of signaling pathways involved in action of IL-3. Statistical significance was calculated by one-way ANOVA with a subsequent post-hoc Tukey's test for multiple comparisons. Results: We observed that MC3T3-E1 cells express IL-3 receptor at both transcript and protein levels. IL-3 did not affect the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells and it was not toxic to the cells even at higher concentration. Interestingly, we found that IL-3 enhances the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, IL-3 upregulated the expression of osteoblast specific genes such as alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, osteopontin, runt-related transcription factor 2 and osterix. We have also observed the induction of phosphorylation of Stat5, Erk1/2 and Akt upon treatment of cells with IL-3. The results demonstrated that shRNA silencing of endogenous XAF1 augmented TNFa induced NFjB activation and IL-8 expression. XAF1 interacted with TRAF2 and inhibited TRAF2-dependent NFjB activation, in part by blocking TRAF2 polyubiquitination. XAF1 also bound RIP1 but did not directly inhibit RIP1-dependent NFjB activation. However, XAF1 knockdown promoted TRAF2/RIP1 association with TRADD in response to TNFa stimulation. Conclusion: These data suggested that XAF1 inhibited TNFa-induced NFjB activation via disruption of TRADD/TRAF2/ RIP1 complex function, possibly by physically blocking interaction between the components of the complex, thereby preventing them from receiving or retaining K63-ubiquitination that is essential for complex formation and signal propagation. Introduction: TNFR1, upon binding TNF-a, can induce activation of either NF-kB pathway or apoptosis by forming signalosome complex 1 and complex 2, respectively. Besides, TNF is known to activate ERK, p38, JNK and Akt pathways [1] . Although TNF mediated apoptosis and NF-kB signaling have been extensively studied, the signalosome responsible for activation of ERK, p38, JNK and Akt pathways has not characterized yet. TNFR1 is known to interact with JAK2 [2] and thus, we hypothesized that, TNFR1 could be tyrosine (Tyr) phosphorylated, triggering the activation of proliferative or stress-induced pathways. We initially immunoprecipitated ULK1 from untreated and IFNk-treated human KT-1 cells and performed LC-MS/MS analysis. Our results showed that ULK1 binds 33 proteins upon IFNk treatment. From the proteins identified, we confirmed the binding of ULK1 to a protein kinase previously shown to be phosphorylated upon engagement of type II IFNR. Next, we demonstrated that ULK1 expression is required for activation of downstream IFNk signaling pathways. Moreover, IFNk-induced transcriptional activation via GAS elements as well as the transcription of several ISGs was significantly reduced in the absence of ULK1/2 expression. In subsequent studies, we observed that ULK1/2 DKO cells are less responsive to the antiviral effects of IFNk compared to WT cells. Similarly, target-specific inhibition reduced the IFNk-mediated antiviral effects in human 2fTGH fibrosarcoma cells. Here we show that DNA damage caused by Cre recombination or by the use of select genotoxic agents induces a robust antiviral response in mammalian cells. This is due to the accumulation of cytoplasmic DNA, which recruits cGAS to promote cGAMP synthesis and downstream STING activation in target and adjacent cells. Interferon gamma (IFN-k) is a cytokine that is critical to innate and adaptive immunity. IFN-k binds as a dimer to the IFN-k receptor 1 and is involved in activation of Th1 cells, monocytes, and macrophages. This cytokine also up-regulates antigen presentation molecules and promotes immunoglobulin class switching in B cells. IFN-k can induce both pro-and anti-inflammatory responses and is involved in many autoimmune disorders. Increased detection sensitivity of IFN-k will allow for improved understanding of disease mechanisms and is necessary to better understand this cytokine as a biomarker and therapeutic target. The detection limit for this novel IFN-k immunoassay is 10 fg/mL, 1000 fold more sensitive than current IFN-k immunoassays. The lower and upper limits of quantitation are 17 fg/mL and 50,400 fg/ mL respectively. Typical intra-plate coefficients of variation (CVs) ranged from 9% to 12%. Inter-plate CVs were 7%, 10%, and 9% for low, mid, and high Quality Control (QC) sample levels, respectively (n = 20 per QC level). The average percent recovery from spike experiments was 105% (n = 12 specimens) and dilution linearity average recovery was 103% (n = 12 specimens). The assay was optimized to minimize serum and plasma matrix effects and interferences. Specificity of the assay was demonstrated by analyte depletion using several anti-IFN-k specific antibodies, indicating the assay is specific for the IFN-k homodimer. IFN-k was detectable in serum and plasma of all apparently healthy specimens (n = 55) with a median value of 315 fg/mL in serum (n = 31), 429 fg/mL in EDTA plasma (n = 10), and 428 fg/mL in heparin plasma (n = 14). IFN-k did not appear to be elevated in a small number of rheumatoid arthritis specimens tested, but appeared to be elevated in some systemic lupus erythematosus and Crohn's specimens. To study the impact of the kinetics of IFN-I responses on the induction of adaptive immunity, we infected TLR/RLH -/mice with VSV and started short-term treatment with rIFN-a 4 hpi. Under such conditions TLR/RLH -/mice mounted normal adaptive immune responses and 76% of the mice survived. Re-infection experiments proved that the surviving mice developed effective memory responses against VSV. Initiation of the rIFN-a treatment 4 h before VSV infection significantly prolonged survival, whereas reduced VSV-specific cytotoxic T cell responses and basically no VSV neutralizing antibody responses were induced and eventually 100% of the mice died. Long-term rIFN-a treatment for 9 days initiated 4 h before VSV infection promoted survival of 100% of the mice, however, no adaptive immunity developed and 100% of the animals succumbed to re-challenge. We found that UV treatment triggers ubiquitination and downregulation of IFNAR1, leading to suppression of IFN signaling and an ensuing decrease in the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The severity of imiquimod-induced psoriasiform inflammation was greatly exacerbated in skin of mice deficient in IFNAR1 ubiquitination (Ifnar1 SA ). Furthermore, these mice did not benefit from UV phototherapy. Pharmacologic induction of IFNAR1 ubiquitination and degradation by an antiprotozoal agent halofuginone also relieved psoriasiform inflammation in wild type but not in Ifnar1 SA mice. Conclusion: These data identify downregulation of IFNAR1 by UV as a major mechanism of the UV therapeutic effects against the psoriatic inflammation and provide a proof of principle for future development of agents capable of inducing IFNAR1 ubiquitination and downregulation for the treatment of psoriasis. Methods: To obtain basic knowledge about the direct antiviral as well as the immunomodulatory effects of IFNa subtypes, we used the HBV hydrodynamic injection (HI) mouse model to stably transfect mouse hepatocytes with an HBV expression plasmid which leads to the induction of host immune responses against HBV in the liver and thus mimicking HBV infection in vivo. Mice were treated daily with different IFNa subtype proteins or IFNa-expression plasmids for long-term endogenous IFN production was applied by HI. Viral antigens, ISG expression and innate and adaptive immune responses were monitored in serum, liver and spleen. Results: Application of most IFNa subtype proteins inhibited HBV replication in vivo, with IFNa4 and IFNa5 being the most effective subtypes. Decreased viral loads after therapeutic application of IFNa4 and IFNa5 correlated with expanded effector cell populations of NK cells and T cells in both liver and spleen. Hydrodynamic injection of plasmids encoding for the effective IFNa subtypes (pIFNa) was even more potent against HBV than injecting IFNa proteins. The combination of pIFNa4 and pIFNa5 showed a synergistic antiviral effect on HBV replication, with a strong increase in NK cell and T cell activity as well as ISG induction in the liver. The presence of bacterial secretion systems present a ''pattern of pathogenesis" associated with bacterial PVs that can be recognized by the host protein galectin 3. We show here that the presence of bacterial secretion systems leads to the recruitment of galectin 3 to PVs, likely indicating the presence of membrane lesions associated with the insertion of bacterial secretion systems into PV membranes. In addition, sterile disruption of host endomembrane vesicles with chemical agents results in Gbp recruitment to the site of damage. This recruitment is dependent on galectin 3. We have generated the first direct structural data for the P-STAT complex. The data indicate that this involves novel surfaces of P not previously implicated in STAT-binding. We are now using these approaches to define the regions of STAT bound by P to provide insight into the mechanism of P-dependent STAT shut down, as well as to discover how P-protein coordinates and regulates STAT interaction with respect to other critical interactions with viral/host proteins. We are also defining in detail the relationship of P with members of the STAT family; our data now indicate that specific interactions with distinct STATs enable precise regulation of cytokine signaling. Conclusion: Our data provide the first insights into the regions of P that mediate interaction with STATs, and how P coordinates its interactions with STAT and other important interactors at the virushost interface. Together with functional data on P-protein's modulation of cytokine signaling, this is providing important new insights into the fundamental molecular events by which this lethal virus efficiently disables inflammation. In addition, the structural data is identifying new targets for antiviral approaches aimed at rendering virus sensitive to innate immunity. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a key cytokine in the adaptive and innate immune system. Infection and inflammation cause macrophages, mast cells, and lymphocytes to secrete GM-CSF, which stimulates differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells into immune cells. Chemotherapy patients are sometimes given recombinant GM-CSF (molgramostim or sargramostim) to increase production of white blood cells and prevent neutropenia. The basal levels of GM-CSF in blood are in the fg/mL range, and are therefore too low to be measurable with standard ELISAs. We found that CD4 + T cells from mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) produce IL-27 in response to malaria antigen or anti-TCR mAb. IL-27-producing CD4 + T cells were foxp3 -CD11a hi CD49d hi , expressed PD-1 and LAG-3, and inhibited IL-2-production and proliferation of other CD4 + T cells. TCRb KO mice transferred with CD4 + T cells from either p28 KO or EBI3 KO mice showed increased frequency of IFN-g-producing CD4 + T cells and improved resistance to PbA-infection when compared with those transferred with wild-type CD4 + T cells, suggesting that these CD4 + T cells regulate protective host immune responses in IL-27-dependent manner.Intracellular cytokine staining indicated that IL-27-producing CD4 + T cells were distinct from IL-10-producing Tr1 or IFN-gproducing Th1 cells. In addition, anti-IL-27 mAb profoundly neutralized the inhibitory activities of the culture supernatant of CD4 + T cells from PbA-infected mice, while anti-IL-10 mAb had little effect, suggesting that IL-27 is a major inhibitory cytokine produced by CD4 + T cells during infection with PbA. Conclusion: These studies imply that IL-27-producing CD4 + T cells are novel foxp3regulatory cells that are induced during infection, and we would like to propose naming these IL-27-priducing CD4 + T cells as Tr27 cells. Introduction: Toll like receptors (TLRs) are essential components of pathogen detection system of innate immunity. In comparison to cell surface TLRs that recognize external and specific pathogen-derived structures, endosomal TLRs recognize broadly nucleic acids to activate immunity. While recognition of pathogen-derived nucleic acids is beneficial, host-derived nucleic acids recognition can be highly detrimental for the host. Therefore, activation of endosomal TLRs must be subject to tight regulation. The overall structure of Der p 2 is characteristic of the immunoglobulin superfamily and contains ten b-strands, forming a b-cup fold with two anti-parallel b-sheets, and a short 310 helix. The two sheets can be separated, further allowing the formation of a large internal pocket, which is narrow and suitable for binding large flat molecules such as lipid-like molecules. Der p 2 caused increased secretion of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1, which are neutrophil survival factors, in human monocytic THP-1 cells in a time-dependent manner. Der p 2 also induces the release of cytokines in normal and allergic lymphocytes. Supernatant after treatment with Der p 2 inhibited neutrophil apoptosis. In coculture of lymphocytes with neutrophils, Der p 2 inhibited spontaneous apoptosis of allergic neutrophils. Conclusion: In summary, Der p 2 binds to TLR4 and induces an inflammatory response such as cytokine secretion in immune cells. These findings may enable elucidation of allergy pathogenesis by specific allergen of house dust mite. Introduction: Necrotic cell death triggers inflammation, whereas apoptosis contributes to its resolution. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokines are key players in this interaction and are produced by necrotic cells to induce sterile inflammation. Release of IL-1 family proteins from apoptotic cells to regulate inflammation has not been described. The novel cytokine IL-38 shares homology with IL-1 family receptor antagonists and was therefore proposed as a negative regulator of IL-1 family receptor signaling. We show that IL-38 is produced selectively by human apoptotic cells to limit inflammation. Depletion of IL-38 in apoptotic cells provoked enhanced IL-6 and IL-8 levels and AP1 activation in co-cultured human primary macrophages, subsequently inducing IL-17-producing T cell activation. IL-38 was N-terminally processed in apoptotic cells to generate a mature cytokine with distinct properties. Both full-length and truncated IL-38 bound to X-linked interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein-like 1 (IL1RAPL1). However, we show higher affinity binding of mature IL-38. Likewise, we confirmed the previously reported low-affinity binding of the IL-38 precursor to IL1R1 and show an increased affinity of mature IL-38 to this receptor. Functionally, the IL-38 precursor induced an increase in IL-6 production by human macrophages, whereas truncated IL-38 reduced IL-6 production by attenuating the JNK/AP1 pathway downstream of IL1RAPL1. Ongoing studies show selective secretion of IL-38 from dying cells challenged with tolerogenic chemotherapy, but not with immunogenic chemotherapy. Moreover, strengthening the role of IL-38 as a tolerogenic factor, IL-38-deficient mice subjected to IMQ-induced psoriasis show an increased IL-17mediated immune response and a strong delay in the restoration of skin architecture. We have identified that the IFN receptor Ifnar2 plays an important role in regulating IL-1b responses in vivo during IAV infection. In the airways of Ifnar2 -/mice following IAV infection, we observed increased neutrophil infiltration and elevated levels of IL-1b. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in Ifnar2-mediated regulation of IL-1b responses, we examined the expression of inactive precursor protein, pro-IL-1b, as determined by immunoblot in lung tissues from wild-type, Ifnar1 -/and Ifnar2 -/mice. The expression of pro-IL-1b was significantly increased in the lungs of untreated Ifnar2 -/mice, suggesting Ifnar2 limits pro-IL-1b protein expression in vivo. We have identified that Ifnar2-mediated regulation of pro-IL-1b is post-translational and the mechanisms involved are currently being investigated. Importantly, the dysregulation of pro-IL-1b expression in Ifnar2 -/mice correlated with increased susceptibility to IAV infection, in comparison to both Ifnar1 -/and wild-type mice. In particular, by day 7 post-infection mice lacking Ifnar2 but not Ifnar1 displayed severe weight loss, clinical signs of disease and the hallmark features of ARDS, namely pulmonary edema and vascular leakage. Methods: We stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) carrying either the responder or the non-responder genotype with synthetic TLR ligands, HCV and HCV-infected hepatoma cells. Results: Interestingly, irrespective of whether human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) carried the responder or the nonresponder genotype at rs368234815, stimulation with synthetic Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands induced similar IFN mRNA as well as IFN-a protein responses. Furthermore, upon direct stimulation with the HCV variant Jc1 primary human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) homozygous for the responder or the non-responder genotype showed similar IFN-a protein expression. In contrast, co-culture of Jc1 infected hepatoma cells with pDC carrying the non-responder genotype resulted in reduced IFN-a as well as IFN-k1 protein responses. This effect was independent of whether pDC carried the normal or the hypo-functional IFN-k4 P70S variant. Unlike poly(I:C) stimulated primary human hepatocytes, HCV triggered pDC did not show IFN-k4 mRNA expression. In line with these experiments, and similar to pDC pre-incubated with recombinant IFN-k1-3, also IFN-k4 enhanced TLR7 ligand-induced IFN responses. Conclusion: These data support the hypothesis that in pDC SNPs within the IFN-k locus can affected cell function independent of IFN-k4 secretion and extracellular IFN-kR triggering. We have previously shown that IFN-b can bind directly to IFNAR1, in the absence of IFNAR2, and can transmit a signal that contributes to lethality in a mouse model of sepsis 1 . In this previous study we also determined the crystal structure of IFN-b bound to the extracellular domain (ECD) of IFNAR1, showing unique interaction interfaces not previously defined for other IFN-receptor complexes and enabling us to hypothesise a molecular basis for the higher binding affinity of IFN-b for IFNAR1 compared to other IFNs 1 . In light of the structural and functional insights we have into this unique signaling complex, herein we sought to investigate the molecular determinants that influenced stability of the IFN-b/IFNAR1 complex and contributed to IFN-b driven signaling in an effort to inform drug discovery to antagonize this ligand-receptor interaction. Methods: The current study used site-directed mutagenesis, recombinant forms of IFNAR1-ECD and IFN-b, and a transient transfection system to express mutant forms of IFNAR1, to investigate the contribution of key residues to the formation of a stable, functional IFN-b/IFNAR1 complex. To observe the effect of mutation on IFN-b and/or IFNAR1 functionality, we used surface plasmon resonance to measure affinity of the protein-protein interaction, flow cytometry to measure down-regulation of cell surface IFNAR1, luciferase assays and western blots to observe activation of signaling molecules, Real-Time PCR to measure gene induction, and anti-viral and antiproliferative assays to observe the effect of mutation on biological outcomes. We have identified a key interaction interface on the third subdomain (SD3) of IFNAR1 that stabilizes the ligand-receptor complex, and influences all aspects of IFN-b functionality investigated in this study. We demonstrated that the interface between two residues on IFNAR1-SD3, Y 240 and Y 274 , and the residues on IFN-b central to this interface (F 63 , L 64 , E 77 , T 78 , V 81 and R 82 ) were collectively crucial for the nano-molar affinity of IFN-b for IFNAR1, for the IFN-b-driven down-regulation of IFNAR1 from the cell surface, the efficient transmission of signals to activate STAT1 and induce ISG expression, and to drive the anti-viral and antiproliferative responses for which IFN-b is well characterized. Here, we showed that compared with infected wild-type mice, mice lacking the type I IFN receptor IFNAR2 exhibited increased resistance towards F. novicida infection, whereas mice lacking AIM2 were more susceptible. In addition, mice lacking IRF9, a core component of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 that transduces type I IFN signaling, showed increased resistance following infection. These results suggested that while type I IFN signaling and AIM2 were essential for activation of the Francisella-induced inflammasome in macrophages, these components have strikingly contrasting effects in vivo. Importantly, we found that mice lacking both AIM2 and IFNAR2 were more resistant than infected wild-type mice and mice lacking AIM2. Methods: We used mice deficient for Irgm1, Irgm2, or Irgm3 expression to probe the involvement of these genes in the host response to LPS. These three paralogous genes are orthologs of the human gene IRGM which has been previously associated with the outcome of sepsis. To specifically examine the function of Irgm2 in LPS sensing pathways, Irgm2 -/mice were crossed with strains deficient for Tlr4 or caspase-11 expression. We performed cell culture studies using IFN-primed bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) from mice of the various genetic backgrounds. To define the role of Irgm proteins in the pathogenesis of sepsis, mice were injected intraperitoneally with LPS and monitored for immune functions and morbidity. For experiments involving Tlr4-deficient mice the TLR3 agonists poly(I:C) was used to stimulate IFN production in vivo. Results: Irgm1 -/and Irgm2 -/-BMDMs showed a marked increase in cell death, IL-1b, and IL-18 production following treatment with LPS. Consistent with these results, Irgm1 -/and Irgm2 -/mice exhibited decreased survival and increased serum IL-1b/IL-18 following LPS challenge. Mice and BMDMs deficient for both Tlr4 and Irgm2 showed increased sensitivity to LPS relative to mice singly lacking Tlr4 expression. On the other hand, BMDMs lacking Irgm2 and caspase-11 expression were protected against LPS-induced cytotoxicity. Conclusion: These results show that Irgm1 and Irgm2 protect against LPS-induced inflammation on both a cellular and whole organismal level. Furthermore, the data implies Irgm1 and Irgm2 act as key regulators of caspase-11 activity. This supports a model wherein IFN signaling is not only required for a potent caspase-11 response but also helps to contract caspase-11-mediated inflammation. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Interferons (IFNs) are classified into three different types, type I, type II and type III (or k) IFNs, based on their structure, receptor complexes and biological activities. In humans, type III IFNs (IFN-ks) are represented by IFN-k1, IFN-k2, IFN-k3 and a recently identified IFN-k4, which shares only a limited homology with other IFN-ks. There is a frequently occurring frame shift mutation in the Ifnl4 gene that can be used as a prediction marker for the responsiveness of patients chronically infected with HCV to IFN-abased therapies. Paradoxically, the presence of the intact Ifnl4 gene is associated with poor response to anti-HCV treatments, suggesting a unique function for IFN-k4. Studies of IFN-k4 have been tempered by difficulties in generating biologically active IFN-k4 protein, particularly from mammalian cells, due to its poor secretion from human cells. We have discovered a novel phosphorylation of STAT2 on T387 that negatively regulates the response to type I IFNs. In most untreated cell types, the majority of STAT2 (85% in 293T cells) is phosphorylated on T387 constitutively. In response to interferon-b, the T387A mutant of STAT2 is much more effective than wild-type STAT2 in mediating the expression of many interferon-stimulated genes, in protecting cells against virus infection, and in inhibiting cell growth. The level of STAT2 T387 phosphorylation varies in different cells and decreases after long-term treatment with IFN-b. T387 phosphorylation increases the level of STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers lack of tyrosine phosphorylation and decreases the amount of ISGF3 that is formed in response to IFN-b. Interferon-b-treated cells expressing wild-type STAT2 contain much less ISGF3 capable of binding to an interferon-stimulated response element than do cells expressing T387A STAT2. T387 lies in a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) consensus sequence, and CDK inhibitors decrease T387 phosphorylation. The results demonstrated that the FHES proteins and the exosomes have anti-inflammatory properties. The candidate proteins promote the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the alternative activation of bone marrow-derived and peritoneal macrophages. Functional studies demonstrated that the proteins had regulatory activity in vivo, attenuating the clinical severity of EAE. In vivo, the exosomes increased eosinophil recruitment and reduced neutrophil numbers in the peritoneum. This effect correlated with an increase in alternative activation markers on macrophages and production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1RA. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that exosome or specific proteins from the helminth F. hepatica can promote regulatory immune responses that could be exploited for the treatment of human inflammatory or autoimmune diseases.

Introduction: Epidemiology studies have shown that there is a lower incidence of allergy and autoimmune diseases in developing countries with a high prevalence of parasitic infections and this has been attributed to the induction of Th2 or regulatory T (Treg) cells. We have previously demonstrated that infection of mice with the helminth parasite Fasciola hepatica, or treatment with the excretorysecretory products from F. hepatica attenuates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE); a mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), through suppression of pathogenic myelin antigen (MOG)-specific Th1 and Th17 cells. The aim of this study was to examine whether we could exploit the immunomodulatory properties of a helminth parasite to prevent the development of autoimmunity either by inducing autoantigen-specific Treg cells or by training the innate immune system to be more regulatory. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were subcutaneous injected with total extract (TE) from F. hepatica or TE and the myelin peptide MOG, MOG only or PBS 21 and 7 days before the induction of EAE. Mice were monitored daily for clinical signs of the disease. On day 16 after EAE induction, mice were sacrificed and mononuclear cells were isolated from the brain and analysed by flow cytometry. Results: Prophylactic treatment of mice with MOG in the presence of F. hepatica TE suppressed MOG-specific effector T cells responses and prevented the onset of EAE. Interestingly, prophylactic administration of F. hepatica TE alone (without antigen) also protected against the development of EAE. This was associated with a reduction of CNS infiltrating pathogenic IL-17 and IFNk-producing T cells. Furthermore, we found that TE suppresses LPS-induced IL-1b and IL-23 production by bone marrow derived macrophages and dendritic cells, in a manner that is independent of IL-10. Moreover, TE was found to suppress IL-17A, IL-17F and IFNy production and gene expression by cd T cells stimulated with IL-1b and IL-23. Interestingly, TE also suppressed IL-1b and IL-23 induced expression of IL-1R1 and IL-23R on cd T cells. Finally, pretreatment with TE primed macrophages to be more anti-inflammatory, leading to increased IL-10 and decreased TNF-a production upon re-stimulation with LPS after a period of rest. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that pre-treatment of mice with parasite products can prevent the development of T cell mediated autoimmune disease by antigen-independent innate immune regulation. Our findings suggest that in addition to innate immune training or memory leading to heighten inflammatory responses, the innate immune system can also be trained to become more anti-inflammatory.

Introduction: NCX 2121, a nitric oxide (NO)-releasing derivative of indomethacin, has been reported to possess potentially beneficial properties including chemopreventive and anti-inflammatory effects. However, the effect of NCX 2121 against inflammatory periodontal disease has not yet been reported. In the present study, the influences and possible mechanisms of NCX 2121 on the production of proinflammatory mediators were examined using murine macrophages activated by LPS isolated from Prevotella intermedia, a pathogen that has been implicated in periodontal diseases. Methods: LPS from P. intermedia ATCC 25611 was isolated employing the standard hot phenol-water protocol. Conditioned culture media were assayed for NO and IL-1b. Real-time PCR was carried out to measure murine iNOS, IL-1b and SOCS1 mRNA levels. iNOS protein expression and levels of signaling proteins were assessed by immunoblot analysis. NF-jB-dependent SEAP reporter assay was performed using a reporter cell line. DNA-binding activities of NF-jB subunits were analysed by using the ELISA-based NF-jB transcription factor assay kit. Results: NCX 2121 significantly down-regulated P. intermedia LPSinduced production of iNOS-derived NO and IL-1b as well as their mRNA expression in RAW264.7 cells. Of note, NCX 2121 was much more effective than the parental compound indomethacin in reducing LPS-induced production of NO and IL-1b. NCX 2121 exerted suppressive effects on the production of NO and IL-1b in P. intermedia LPS-activated murine macrophages through the inhibition of NF-jB, STAT1 and STAT3 activation and SOCS1 induction. Conclusion: NCX 2121 could potentially be useful in the host modulation of inflammatory periodontal disease, although further studies are required to verify this.

Introduction: Strawberry notch homolog 2 (Sbno2) is a putative transcription factor the expression of which we have identified previously 1 to be both constitutive and strongly upregulated by various cytokines (including IL-6) and by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). Although these observations suggest Sbno2 may have roles in astrocyte homeostasis and in the regulation of the inflammatory response little is known concerning its function in the healthy or inflamed CNS. Therefore, the aim of this study was to further delineate the function of Sbno2 by generating a mouse model for the cell-specific deletion of Sbno2 in astrocytes. Methods: Mice (Sbno2 fl/fl ) were generated in which the introns flanking exons 8-10 of the murine Sbno2 gene were floxed. The Sbno2 fl/fl mice were then crossed with GFAP-Cre mice to conditionally disrupt the Sbno2 gene in astrocytes (Sbno2-AstKO mice). Histological examination was performed on the brain from Sbno2-AstKO and control mice at different ages. Primary cultures of astrocytes were obtained from Sbno2-AstKO and control mice and the physical and molecular phenotypes of these cells were compared. Mice were given dual, staggered intra-peritoneal injections of purified E. coli LPS and various markers for neuroinflammation were analysed. Results: Sbno2-AstKO offspring developed normally and displayed no outward phenotype up to at least 12 months of age. In cultured astrocytes from Sbno2-AstKO mice neither un-recombined Sbno2 mRNA nor SBNO2 protein were detectable, confirming the Cremediated disruption of the Sbno2 gene. The morphology of astrocytes from Sbno2-AstKO mice was indistinguishable from control mice despite having increased levels of STAT3 protein and the astrocyte markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member L1 (ALDH1L1). The level of GFAP mRNA was higher in the cerebrum of adult Sbno2-AstKO mice compared with age-matched control littermates. Following LPS injection, the expression of various inflammatory and glial markers was found to be similarly affected between Sbno2-AstKO and control mice. Conclusion: A new model allowing the conditional deletion of the Sbno2 gene in specific cell types was successfully generated. Our initial findings reveal that loss of Sbno2 in astrocytes, (1) does not compromise the development or viability of these cells and is associated with only subtle phenotypic changes and (2) does not overtly alter the neuroinflammatory response following systemic LPS challenge. It is expected that further insight to the function of Sbno2 in astrocytes will be gained from ongoing studies profiling the transcriptome of Sbno2-AstKO cells. 10 or greater), interferon signature, and medication use, indicating that each of these factors exerted a different impact on monocyte gene expression that could be separately identified. A subset of antiinflammatory gene set expressing NCLs was inversely correlated with anti-dsDNA titers (rho = -0.77, p = 0.0051) and positively correlated with C3 complement (rho = 0.68, p = 0.030) in the SLE patient group. Conclusion: Using single cell gene expression, we have identified a unique gene expression patterns that reflect the major clinical and immunologic characteristics of the SLE patients which are not evident in bulk cell data, supporting the critical importance of the single cell technique.
