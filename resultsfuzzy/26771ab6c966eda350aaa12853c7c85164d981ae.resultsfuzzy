The nanofibrous hybrid PVDF-Ag-Al 2 O 3 membranes for air filtration were prepared by mixing Al 2 O 3 and silver nanoparticles with PVDF polymer solution and making it homogenous followed by electrospinning the solution. The antibacterial activity, detoxification efficiency and the PFE of the membranes were tested, studied and compared. Here, DMF is used as a solvent or co-solvent for dissolving silver nitrate, since it behaves as an active reducing agent forming silver nanoparticles at room temperature [33] . The images resemble the nanofibers prepared with 15 wt% PVDF using DMAC/Acetone (2:3) as solvent observed by Matsuura and coworkers [38] . In addition to the fibers, we can also find the Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles attached onto the nanofibers. The presence of Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles on the surface of the membrane was confirmed by comparing EDX images of the membrane samples with nanoparticles. From the SEM images, we can visualize that the amount of Al 2 O 3 in M5 is higher than the rest of the membranes and is confirmed by the EDX measurements. We can also see that the amount of silver is almost the same in all the EDX spectrums. This shows that the developed composite membranes contain Ag and Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles, which can disinfect microorganisms and detoxify chemical pollutants respectively that come into contact with the membrane. The Java image processing software [Image J1.29 (222 commands)] was used to measure the diameter of the fibers from the SEM images. Table 1 shows the average membrane diameters of M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5. It was found that the fiber diameter is 0.85 lm for M5 which is higher than the rest of the membranes and might be due the presence of the increased metal oxide nanoparticles after post treatment as seen in the SEM images. Thus the increased orders of the fiber diameter of the membranes are found to be M1 < M2 < M3 < M4 < M5. Table 1 shows the average thickness of the post treated membranes (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5 and control) measured using a micrometer screw gauge (Mitutoyo, Japan). From the table, we can observe that the average thickness of the membrane increases as the metal oxide composition increases and was found to be higher for the M5 (which has 8% Al 2 O 3 ) i.e. 62.9 lm, where as for the PVDF (control) membrane it is 50.4 lm.
