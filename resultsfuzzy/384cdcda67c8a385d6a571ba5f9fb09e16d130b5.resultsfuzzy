PEDV failed to induce IFN-β expression and inhibited poly (I:C)-mediated IFN-β production in IECs Type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) are critical to the host antiviral innate immune response. However, there is no evidence suggesting that IECs produce type I IFNs in response to PEDV infection. Previous studies have showed that PEDV could be propagated in IECs [ 23, 24,] . To confirm whether PEDV infection could induce IFN-β production in IECs or not, we transiently cotransfected the IFN-β/ luciferase reporter plasmid (IFN-β-Luc) and the Renilla luciferase construct phRL-TK and then infected with PEDV (at an MOI of 1 or 0.1, respectively) or mockinfected for 24 h. The cells were retransfected with 1 μg of poly (I:C) as a positive inducer. As shown in Fig. 1a , IFN-β luciferase activity enhanced markedly in positive controls, while it was almost not detected in PEDV-infected IECs. In addition, IFN-β mRNA expression was hardly detected in PEDV-infected IECs similar to mock-infected group, however, it had significant expression in poly (I:C)-transfected group at the indicated times (12 h and 24 h, p < 0.01) (Fig. 1b) . This result was consistent with the luciferase reporter assay. Taken together, PEDV infection of IECs did not induce IFN-β activation. Increasing evidence showed that viruses not only inhibit the induction of type I IFNs, but also block dsRNAinduced production of type I IFNs to escape the innate immune surveillance of the host [25] [26] [27] . To identify whether PEDV was able to inhibit dsRNA-induced IFN-β production, IFN-β-Luc was transfected into PEDV-infected and uninfected cells, respectively. The cells were retransfected with or without poly (I:C) 24 h later. As a result, activation of the IFN-β promoter decreased significantly in poly (I:C)-transfected, PEDVinfected cells compared with mock-infected cells transfected with poly (I:C) (Fig. 1c) . It showed PEDV also inhibited poly (I:C)-mediated IFN-β induction. PEDV impeded poly (I:C)-mediated activation of IRF-3, but not NF-κB IRF-3 and NF-κB are two essential IFN-β transcription factors. In unstimulated cells, IRF-3 is ubiquitously present in the cytoplasm as an inactive monomer, whereas NF-κB is present as a homodimer or heterodimer bound to the inhibitory proteins IκB in the cytoplasm [28] . Phosphorylation, which is a key step during IRF-3 and NF-κB activation, in turn, leads to nuclear translocation. Therefore, we evaluated whether PEDV infection induced IRF-3 and p65 activation by western blot analysis. Following PEDV infection, the whole cell extracts were prepared for the indicative times, in Fig. 2a , IRF-3 still existed in the cytoplasm, and the levels of IRF-3 protein was almost equal with mock-infected cells, while the phosphorylation of IRF-3 (p-IRF-3) did not detect in the PEDV infected cells in comparision to a obviously signal in poly (I:C)-transfected cells. On the contrary, compared with the amount of NF-κB subunit p65 in the cytoplasm, the phosphorylation of p65 (p-p65) increased with progression of PEDV infection in the nucleus. Meanwhile, the concentration of poly (I:C)induced p65 nuclear translocation was clearly increased. PEDV N protein was also detected in PEDV-infected cells. These data suggested that PEDV did not induce activation of IRF-3, but NF-κB. We then used luciferase reporter assay system to determine whether IRF-3 and NF-κB are linked with the inhibition of IFN-β production after PEDV infection. As shown in Fig. 2b , IRF-3 luciferase activity was sharply decreased in PEDV-infected cells, and poly (I:C)-induced IRF-3 activation was also inhibited by PEDV in comparison to a remarkably signal in poly (I:C)-transfected cells. However, in Fig. 2c , compared with mock-infected To detect the activation of IRF-3 and p65 after PEDV infection, the cell extracts were prepared at the indicated times and subjected to western blot analysis with antibodies specific for IRF-3, p65, p-IRF-3, p-p65 and PEDV N McAb. Anti-β-actin was included as a control for sample loading. These experiments were performed in duplicate. b and c IECs were infected or mock-infected with PEDV at an MOI of 1 for 12 h, and then cells were cotransfected with (PRDIII-I) 4-Luc (b) or pNF-κB-Luc (c) and phRL-TK for additional 24 h. Cells were retransfected with poly (I:C) for 12 h, harvested, and then subjected to a dual-luciferase assay. All data are expressed as means ± SD of 3 independent experiments. **p < 0.01 as compared with poly (I:C). d IRF3-GFP fusion protein transfected with IECs and then infected with PEDV at an MOI of 1 and mock-infected cells served as negative controls. 24 h later, cells were retransfected with poly (I:C) (positive control) (c and d) or untransfected (a and b) for 12 h. Cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1 % Triton X-100, and stained by DAPI (blue). Cells were incubated with anti-PEDV rabbit polyclonal antibody (red) and TRITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody, then analyzed for fluorescence by confocal microscopy. Magnification, ×20 (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) (See figure on previous page.) Fig. 1 PEDV does not induce IFN-β production and inhibits poly (I:C)-mediated IFN-β induction. a IECs were cotransfected with IFN-β-Luc and phRL-TK, then infected with PEDV at an MOI of 1 and 0.1 for 24 h. Cells were retransfected with poly (I:C) as a positive control. After 12 h, the cells were harvested and subjected to a dual-luciferase assay. b IECs were infected with PEDV at an MOI of 1, mock-infected as a negative control, or transfected with poly (I:C) as a positive control. At the indicated time points, total RNA was extracted and IFN-β and β-actin mRNA were subjected to real-time PCR. RNA expression levels were normalized to β-actin. c In contrast to a, IECs were first mock-infected or infected with PEDV at an MOI of 1 for 12 h and then cotransfected with IFN-β-Luc and phRL-TK for 24 h. Cells were retransfected with or without poly (I:C) for an addition 12 h, harvested, and then subjected to a dual-luciferase assay. All data are expressed as means ± SD of 3 independent experiments. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 as compared with poly (I:C) cells, NF-κB luciferase activity significantly enhanced both in PEDV-infected and poly (I:C)-transfected cells. In addition, we found that poly (I:C)-induced activation of NF-κB was not blocked by PEDV. To further identify PEDV-inhibited poly (I:C)-mediated activation of IRF-3, confocal microscopy assay was used. As a result, IRF3-GFP remained in the cytoplasm of both mockinfected ( Fig. 2d. a) and PEDV-infected (Fig. 2d . b) IECs compared with poly (I:C) controls, in which clear translocation to the nucleus was observed (Fig. 2d. d) . Furthermore, PEDV could block poly (I:C)-mediated IRF-3 nucleus migration (Fig. 2d. c) . Taken together, our date clearly implied that PEDV impeded dsRNA-mediated IFN-β transcription primary by interfering with IRF-3 activation, but not NF-κB. PEDV failed to block TBK1/IKKε activity TBK1 and IKKε are essential kinases for the IRF-3 activation [29] . In order to ascertain whether PEDV inhibited poly (I:C)-induced IRF-3 activation by impeding TBK1/IKKε kinase activity, we cotransfected plasmids expressing TBK1/IKKε kinase and a plasmid encoding the IFN-β promoter of the luciferase reporter into infected or mock-infected IECs and retransfected the cells with or without poly (I:C) at 36 h.p.i. As show in Fig. 3 , TBK1/IKKε overexpression increased IFN-β promoter activity in both infected and mock-infected IECs, and obviously upregulation was detected in IECs transfected with poly (I:C), suggesting that PEDV failed to block TBK1/IKKε activity. However, poly (I:C)-induced IFN-β promoter activity in IECs overexpression of TBK1/ IKKε plasmids was significantly inhibited by PEDV. It showed that PEDV interrupting dsRNA-induced IFN-β production should localize upstream from TBK1/IKKε.
