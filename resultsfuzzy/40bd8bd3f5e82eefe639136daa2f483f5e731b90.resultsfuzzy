As described in Section 2, SARS and Avian Flu are independent events as the effects of the former had actually ended before the latter had even started. In order to reflect this fact appropriately, we will estimate the SARS model for the period January The static linear fixed effects model and difference transformation dynamic model described in Section 3 were estimated for SARS infections, SARS deaths and the death ratio for SARS, as well as for human infections, human deaths and the death ratio of Avian Flu. We first present the estimates of the static linear fixed effects model discussed in sub-section 3.1, and then present the estimates of the difference transformation dynamic model discussed in subsection 3.2. The results of the static fixed effect model are presented in Table 6a -c. Table 6a gives the results of SARS and Avian Flu for human infections, Table 6b gives the results for human deaths, and Table 6c gives the results of the death ratio. The results of the dynamic difference model are presented in Tables 7a-c. As for the static model, Tables 7a-c give the results of SARS and Avian Flu for infections, human deaths and the death ratio, respectively. Note: For the sample period and number of countries in the sample, see Table 3 above. Standard errors are in parentheses; *** denotes significance at the; 1% level. All models include a set of country fixed effects, The sample period for SARS is Jan. 2003 -Dec. 2003 , and for Avian Flu it is Jan. 2004-July 2007.
