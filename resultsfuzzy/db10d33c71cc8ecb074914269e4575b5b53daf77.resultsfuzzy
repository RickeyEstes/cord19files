Sialate-O-acetylesterases were incubated in the presence of different sialoside concentrations. Table 2 summarises the inhibitory effect of 9-modified sialosides 3 and 4 toward the 9-SOAE enzymes determined by pNPA assay. We identified the 9-O-methyl sialoside 3 as a potential inhibitor of HE12-GFP. At a concentration of 5 mM compound 3 the inhibition is approximately 86%. Analysis by fluorimetric HPLC revealed a 10e15% inhibition by 3 of Neu5,9Ac 2 -hydrolysis by HE12-GFP at a concentration of 1 mM, thus confirming the results of the pNPA assay (data not shown). Less inhibitory effect of 3 was detected with the whole influenza virus particles. We suggest that the different conformation of the haemagglutinin protein (recombinant HE12-GFP ¼ monomeric protein; whole virus ¼ trimeric protein) may contribute to the differences in the inhibitory effect of sialoside 3. The 9-SOAE of BCoV was also less effected by 3. According to [39] , it seems that the BCoV is more dependent on the aglycon moiety than the influenza C virus esterase. It may be that the allyl group of the sialosides has an effect on the enzymatic reaction and consequently less inhibition was detected. Comparison of the inhibitory activities of 9-modified sialosides 3 and 4 suggests that the negatively charged methylphosphonate does not induce detectable inhibition when compared to the unmodified sialoside 5. There is however, a significant effect of the small, hydrophobic, methyl group at the same position indicating that inhibition can be improved by further modifications at this position. This effect has so far been seen only with the recombinant esterase from the influenza C virus, not with whole virus. It can be speculated that this is a result of it being a monomer rather than the native trimer, but that will require further studies with optimised inhibitors of higher affinity. For influenza C virus esterase, these results are in line with those from an earlier study where a K i of 4.2 mM was determined for a 9-acetamido-9-deoxy-sialic acid derivative [51] . Table 3 summarises the inhibitory behaviour of compounds 1 and 2 toward MHV-S and SDAV-HE determined by the pNPA assay. No significant inhibition was observed even at concentrations of 5 mM, indicating that there is less scope for modification of the 4- hydroxy group. It should be kept in mind as well that the mode of action of 4-SOAE is may be different to that of 9-SOAE. Unmodified control sialoside 5 (negative control) did not show detectable inhibition of any of the enzymes. 3,4-Dichloroisocoumarin (positive control) was highly reactive towards all esterase activities at 0.1 mM concentration.
