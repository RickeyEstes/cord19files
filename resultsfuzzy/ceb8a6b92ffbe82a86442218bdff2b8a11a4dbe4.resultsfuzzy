Microbiological examination can yield any one or more of a variety of bacteria, depending on the species examined, the animal's age, and its clinical condition. Tracheal aspirates of normal animals rarely yield any bacterial growth on culture. Growth of unusual organisms or known oropharyngeal commensal bacteria from samples obtained by endoscopic examination should not be given undue clinical significance as they probably result from contamination of the tracheal aspirate during collection. Pseudomonas spp. and anaerobes isolated from tracheal aspirates collected by endoscopy are almost always contaminants and of no clinical significance. The extent of contamination of tracheal aspirate samples by oropharyngeal bacteria can be estimated from the number of squamous epithelial cells in the sample. There is an apparent approximate linear relationship between the number of squamous cells per milliliter of fluid and the number of colony-forming bacterial units in tracheal aspirates. Samples containing over approximately 10 squamous epithelial cells per milliliter of tracheal aspirate had markedly greater bacterial contamination. Examination of Gram-stained smears of tracheal fluid is specific but not very sensitive for detection of bacteria, compared with culture. In other words, if examination of a Gramstained smear of tracheal fluid reveals bacteria, then the sample is likely to yield bacteria on culture, whereas failure to detect bacteria predicts poorly the likelihood of growth of bacteria on culture of the sample. This indicates that examination of Gram-stained samples of tracheal fluid does not reliably predict bacterial isolation, and if an infectious etiology is suspected, the fluid should be cultured. Results of the microbiological examination of the tracheal fluid should be consistent with the animal's clinical condition and expected isolates. Cytologic examination of tracheal fluid is an important diagnostic tool. Various stains are available to aid identification of cell types and numbers in tracheal aspirates. Neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and epithelial cells are readily identified on the basis of their classical morphology and staining using fast Romanowsky stain (Diff-Quik), but this stain is not suitable for identifying mast cells in equine tracheal fluid and probably that of other species. Leishman's stain is useful to identify mast cells. Clinically normal horses typically have fewer than 20% to 30% of cells as neutrophils with the majority of remaining cells being macrophages, lymphocytes and epithelial cells. Animals with inflammation of the airways typically have increased cell counts and proportion of neutrophils and large amounts of mucus. Horses with inflammatory airway disease such as heaves typically have more than 20% of the cells as neutrophils (see following "Heaves" section), and those with infectious pneumonia often have 50% to 90% of cells as neutrophils. Exercise markedly increases the proportion of neutrophils in tracheal fluid collected within 1 hour of the horse completing intense exercise. 46 The presence of eosinophils is considered abnormal and is consistent with parasite migration (Parascaris equorum in foals, Dictyocaulus viviparus in calves). The presence of hemosiderinladen macrophages is evidence of prior pulmonary hemorrhage. A large body of information has been generated on the microbiology and, more recently, molecular microbiology of specific pathogens associated with BRD, but only a fraction is applicable clinically. Insufficient effort has been directed toward integrating the information and applying it to the effective control of respiratory disease on the farm. Ideally, investigations of outbreaks of bovine respiratory disease should consist of in-depth examinations of a representative sample of the affected group and normal in-contact animals using a multidisciplinary approach involving clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory investigation. These procedures, especially those requiring detailed virological and serologic examinations, are expensive, and in the light of the economic status of cattle industries, they are not likely to be lightly borne. But it will only be when such a multidisciplinary approach is brought to bear on bovine respiratory disease that we will improve our position with respect to knowing what actually occurs in outbreaks of the disease. Of paramount importance is the identification of risk factors, which, if valid, gives the clinician a powerful clinical tool for the clinical management and control of BRD.
