With water vapor assistance, the sampler demonstrated a much smaller cut point diameter with over 50% collection efficiency for particles larger than 0.7 m and over 80% collection efficiency for particles larger than 2 m, compared to 60-80% for the non-vapor assisted configuration. Also, the non-vapor assisted test showed the swirling liquid level along the cylinder wall decreases with the increasing collection time due to evaporation which lowers collection efficiency for prolonged sampling, while the presence of vapor in the vapor-assisted experiment alleviates the degree of bouncing of large particles from the impaction surface wall and exiting from the sampler. Continuous addition of water vapor also helps maintain the swirling liquid to an adequate level necessary for particle collection inside the sampler, thus greatly increasing the collection efficiency. Due to additional water vapor, only 2.5 mL out of 20.0 mL water sample evaporated after 30-minute continuous collection at the humidifier temperature setting of 30 °C. Figure 5 presents the comparison of the bioaerosol collection efficiency using the BioSampler and the SAS, in which Figure 5a shows the agar plates of the two samples from one of the tests after incubation and Figure 5b shows the CFU concentrations obtained by the two samplers. Error bar represents the standard deviation of the results from the three repeated runs. Figure 5c shows the size distribution of the bioaerosol used in the study. The bioaerosol concentrations determined by the SAS and reference BioSampler were 105±6 and 108±40 CFU/m 3 , respectively, indi cating a high collection efficiency and viability preservation of 97.2% for the SAS at flow rate of 167 Lpm compared with BioSampler at flow rate of 12.5 Lpm. This indicates the preference of medium to high flow sampling for ambient bioaerosol collection, especially at conditions of clean environment with low bioaerosol concentrations which requires much longer sampling time with less temporal resolution. Given the much higher (13.4 times) sampled volume per unit of time by SAS and the good agreement of the collection performance with the reference sampler, the new design provides an alternative option for high temporal resolution sampling of bioaerosol.
