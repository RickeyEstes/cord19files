In total, 89 C. parvum samples were subtyped, originating from 33 farms. One sample was subtyped on 22 farms, with the remaining 11 farms having between 2 and 8 samples subtyped. The subtyped samples were from cattle faeces (81), dirty water (6) and bird samples (2), but none of the C. parvum manure samples were successfully subtyped. The most common subtype was IIaA15G2R1 which was detected in all three sample types, and the least common were IIaA15G2R0 and IIaA17G1R2, with the latter being a novel subtype not previously reported (Table 7) . From the 11 farms that had multiple samples tested, three had more than one subtype detected in cattle: IIaA18G1R1 and IIaA16G3R1; IIaA15G2R0 and IIaA15G2R1; and IIaA15G2R2 and IIaA16G3R1. On 4 of the 5 farms where more than 1 cattle group was tested, identical subtypes were detected in the different groups. The tested cattle groups for the farm that had non-identical subtypes were located separately, with one present on the main farm and the other on an out-farm. Only 1 farm had both cattle and dirty water tested and both sources had the same C. parvum subtype (IIaA15G2R1). One dirty water sample came from the drain outside the cattle group's accommodation, but the other came from a drain outside a cattle group that tested negative for Cryptosporidium. On the 2 farms where bird samples were tested, the subtypes (IIaA15G2R1 and IIaA19G1R1) matched the cattle subtypes. On both farms the bird samples were collected from the accommodation of a cattle group with the matching subtype, but the same subtype Table 7 Summary of the numbers of C. parvum GP60 subtypes detected, by sample type.
