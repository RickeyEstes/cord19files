Of 276 serum samples, 87 showed a positive reaction in the neutralizing antibody assay. The relationship of the neutralizing antibody titers with the OD 405 values in the SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA at a dilution level of 1:100 was evaluated using 87 neutralizing antibody-positive samples. There were significant positive correlations between the neutralizing antibody titers and the OD 405 values in the SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA (Fig. 1 , R 2 = 0.668, p < 0.001).
