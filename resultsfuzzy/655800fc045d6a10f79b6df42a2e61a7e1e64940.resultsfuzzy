The mean age of the ferrets was approximately 4 years but ranged from 11 months to 6.5 years. Only 1 ferret was younger than 1 year (5.88%), 8 ferrets were aged between 1 and 4.5 years (47.06%), and 8 ferrets were older than 4.5 years (46.06%). Age was reported at the time of actual diagnosis and not time of onset of clinical disease signs. Of the 17 ferrets, 8 were female and 9 male. Only 1 animal was intact (male) and all the others had been neutered, surgically or with implantation of deslorelin acetate (Suprelorin; Virbac France, Carros, France). Almost all ferrets had been purchased from pet shops (94.1%). One (5%) was obtained from a private breeder. Each ferret had a different owner. The following 3 different groups of lesions were identified: eyelid, respiratory (upper or lower), and digestive. Eyelid lesions included unilateral or bilateral swelling or nictitating membrane, without conjunctival or corneal lesions (Fig. 1) . Patient history included topical ophthalmic treatment failure, with both antibiotic and steroid therapy. In the group with respiratory signs, both upper and lower clinical disease signs were observed. Upper respiratory disease signs included sneezing and increased upper respiratory sounds. Pulmonary signs included dyspnea and coughing. Thoracic radiographic images revealed pleural effusion and patchy pulmonary alveolar densities. In 1 case, lesions were found both in the lungs and in the nasal cavity (Figs. 2 to 4). Digestive tract lesions were identified in the oral cavity, stomach (Fig. 5) , intestine ( Fig. 6) , liver (Fig. 7) , spleen, a mandibular lymph node, and the mesenteric and hepatic lymph nodes (Fig. 8 ). Of the 17 ferrets, 10 (58.82%) presented with lesions identified at only 1 site and 7 (41.18%) presented with lesions in multiple sites. Of the ferrets with lesions identified at only 1 anatomic location, 5 presented with eyelid edema. Complete blood count results were available for 7 animals, but no significant abnormalities typically associated with mycobacteriosis in other animals (e.g., leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and monocytosis) were identified. Similarly, no significant abnormalities were noted in the biochemical profile of the animals tested (5 animals). PCR was performed on 16 of the 17 ferrets. In the single case where PCR was not performed, diagnosis was made postmortem via histopathology. Of the 16 PCR tests, 15 had positive results, ranging from weakly to strongly positive. The bacterium was further identified in 11 cases. In 2 cases, the owners declined speciation owing to cost. Information for 1 case was unavailable at the time of publication. In 1 case, identification was not possible because of an insufficient amount of DNA retrieved. All the bacteria identified were atypical mycobacteria, and included M. chelonae, Mycobacterium vanbaalenii, Mycobacterium canariense, Mycobacterium shimoidei, Mycobacterium aurum, Mycobacterium vaccae, Mycobacterium gordonae, Mycobacterium cosmeticum, and Mycobacterium montefiorense (Table 3) . M. gordonae and M. cosmeticum were identified twice. Histopathology was performed on samples from 8 cases. Lesions were granulomatous or pyogranulomatous in all cases in which histopathology was used. In all, 7 cases were tested for acid-fast bacilli via Ziehl-Neelsen staining (6 were positive and 1 negative) and 1 case was tested via Fite-Faraco staining. Histopathology was not performed in 9 cases. In 4 of the cases where submitted samples were stained, eyelid lesions highly consistent with mycobacteriosis were present, and the owners also elected to have PCR testing performed. In 2 cases, there was no observable disease lesion that could be collected for histopathological examination. In 1 case, the owner declined surgery. In 2 cases, the excision of a lesion was performed, but owners refused histopathological examination owing to the cost of testing. After identification of the bacteria, all owners were informed of the minimal, but potential zoonotic risk, given that all the mycobacteria identified were atypical. None of the owners opted for euthanasia. Regarding treatment, 2 ferrets were treated with an amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination at a dose of 12.5 mg/kg, orally every 12 hours (Synulox gouttes; Zoetis France, Paris, France), whereas all the others were treated with enrofloxacin at a dose of 10 mg/kg, orally every 12 hours (Baytril injectable 5%; Bayer Sant√© Division Animale, Puteaux, France). Of the 17 ferrets, 3 (17.65%) were considered cured (more than 1 year posttreatment without reoccurrence of clinical disease signs). Of these 3 ferrets, 1 presented with conjunctival edema, 1 with a conjunctival abscess, and 1 with upper respiratory tract signs. There was 1 ferret that was still undergoing treatment at the time of the submission of this article. Of the ferrets included in this study, 14 died (82.35%). Of the 14 ferret deaths, 7 were attributed to mycobacteriosis as no other cause of death was determined, and 7 ferrets (50%) died of disease conditions thought to be unrelated to mycobacteriosis, including 1 that died of insulinoma more than 1 year after diagnosis. Survival of the ferrets in this retrospective clinical review ranged from 10 days to 3.5 years after diagnosis. Mean survival time after diagnosis was 9.4 months. Source of exposure for all ferrets is unknown, but the authors have speculated as to the risk factors involved. Some of the ferrets were taken outdoors by their owners, but most lived exclusively indoors. Food sources varied. Some ferrets ate chicks and some ate home-prepared meals, whereas most were fed dry kibble only (ferret, cat, or kitten). For ferrets living in groups, no companion ferrets were diagnosed with mycobacteriosis and no owners reported human infection.
