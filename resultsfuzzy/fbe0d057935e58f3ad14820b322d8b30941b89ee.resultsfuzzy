We start by estimating the simultaneous eqs. (4) and (5) using two-stage least squares (2SLS). We apply autocorrelation, autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH), and heteroskedasticity tests on the residuals from the estimated equations. 32 Newey-West heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) covariance estimates are used if there is a problem. 33 To correct for serial correlation problems, AR terms from 1 through 3 are also included in both regressions. The Log-31 Other factors include interest earnings earned from foreign reserves accumulation. Given the low interest rates in China as well as the fact that the majority of its capital inflows relate to the private financial account, we ignore these factors. 32 The Breusch-Godfrey serial correlation Lagrange multiplier (LM) test is used to check for the autocorrelation, while White's heteroskedasticity test is used to test the heteroskedasticity in the residuals. ARCH LM test is used to test for ARCH in the residuals. 33 Newey and West (1987) have derived a consistent covariance matrix estimator in the presence of both heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. Since we use the Newey-West HAC estimates we do not need to include lagged dependent terms as done by Brissimis et al. (2002) and others. likelihood ratio test is applied to lag length selection. Table 4 summarizes the results of the estimating equations. We have three sets of estimations depending on whether we assume perfect foresight, static expectations, or forward-looking expectations. Forward-looking expectations are captured using the three month forward rate (the one-month forward rate unfortunately being unavailable). The estimated offset coefficients are around 0.5 and are statistically significant, indicating a moderate degree of capital mobility and a degree of porousness of China's capital controls. The estimated sterilization coefficients are also highly statistically significantly significant at around 1, 34 suggesting that the PBC has heavily sterilized its reserve accumulations in the last nine years. The money multiplier is statistically and economically significant across all the estimations with the correct sign. Cyclical output is statistically significant and negative across all the estimations, which suggests that the income effect leading to a worsening of the current account may be greater than the direct impact that positive cyclical income has on attracting capital inflows. This again is consistent with international capital mobility for China being moderate rather than high. The lagged inflation term is statistically significant with negative (correct) signs across all regressions. The exchange rate adjusted foreign interest rate coefficients have the incorrect sign though they are generally statistically insignificant. Both the lagged REER and the cyclical fiscal deficit are statistically insignificant in balance of payments function and monetary reaction function, respectively. There is evidence of persistence in both reactions functions.
