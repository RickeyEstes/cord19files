Proteins responsible for neurodegenerative diseases are natively unfolded and thus can interact with different partners to form several multimeric complexes. It can result in their potential propensity, if not kept under check, to form abnormal multimeric complexes. Physiologic and pathologic data suggests the formation of at least three different types of protein complexes namely; Physiologic Protein Mosaics (PM), Protein Aggregates and Pathologic PM [199] . Furthermore, the ‚ê§-sheet conformation present in aggregates may have a physiologic role and even the amorphous aggregates may function to shield the potentially toxic diffusible oligomers. In fact, fibril formation (amyloidogenesis) may be an evolutionary conserved mechanism for creating biologically active quaternary structures. Although aggregation does not rule out detrimental effects of amyloid deposits in particular contexts (eg. obstructive vascular amyloid), they clearly show that amyloid formation can be beneficial. Several studies suggest that the formation of tightly packed Huntingtin deposits is beneficial for cell survival.
