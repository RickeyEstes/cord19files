After data collection and sensor calibration, this study executed data cleaning by removing CO 2 concentrations with the values lower than 400 ppm or greater than the upper limits of the sensor detection range. This process resulted in 668,390 useful data points from over 1 million measurements that represented a success rate of roughly 67% in the data collection effort under a very limited access to the sensors. Fig. 5 shows data distribution of the CO 2 concentrations in the dormitory rooms for both HVB and LVB. In both buildings, the data measured by each sensor greatly varied with the hourly occupancy rates, especially evident in the LVB. As shown in Table 2 , both the average and standard deviation of CO 2 concentrations were lower in the HVB. These results were expected because, assuming constant generation rates, the lower the ventilation rate the higher CO 2 concentrations due to a slow process of dilution. In accordance with the local wind conditions shown in Fig. 1(b) , the average and standard deviation of CO 2 concentrations were higher in the dormitory rooms at the leeward side of LVB. Furthermore, Table 3 also shows that the dormitory rooms at the windward side of the building had a better ventilation and lower ARI rates than those at the leeward side of the LVB. It should be noted that, a total of 4546 CO 2 concentrations measured by 27 HOBO sensors installed in the LVB dormitory rooms exceeded the upper limit of 5000 ppm. This upper detection limit was met in 0.7% of all useful CO 2 data points. Therefore, the variation and the average of CO 2 concentrations in the LVB dormitory rooms are slightly underestimated due to the upper detection limit of HOBO sensors being at 5000 ppm. Fig. 6 shows the variations of hourly averaged CO 2 concentrations on weekdays and weekends in the double rooms in both buildings. Only the data in double rooms were chosen to directly compare the results in two buildings. This constraint is appropriate because all studied dormitory rooms in the HVB, and 91% of the studied dormitory rooms (62) in the LVB were double rooms. Importantly, Fig. 6 does not include the data measured during the spring break (March 18th-25th, 2018) because these data sets are not representative of typical room conditions when occupants were present. As calculated, daily average CO 2 concentration was 1219 ppm on weekdays and slightly higher with 1231 ppm on weekends in HVB. The daily average CO 2 concentration was 1375 ppm on weekdays, and it had a much higher value of 1540 ppm on weekends in the LVB. According to Fig. 6 , the variations of hourly averaged CO 2 concentrations presented different patterns in these two buildings. In the HVB, with steady outside air supply by the DOAS system, the hourly averaged CO 2 concentration for each room were in a repeatable and narrow range throughout the day. In the LVB, infiltration could not provide sufficient outside air to counteract the changes in CO 2 source strength, i.e. number of occupants. On weekdays, hourly averaged CO 2 concentrations in the LVB rooms and their standard deviations showed a similar variation trend. In the morning, they slowly increased to the peak at around 10 AM. This was more likely to be caused by the increased metabolic activity during waking, not by the increased occupancy. They then decreased as the student left for classes, and started to increase again after 8 PM as most of the students came back their rooms, and finally trended to a stable value after the students fell asleep. The hourly averaged CO 2 concentrations and their standard deviations had a similar variation pattern during weekends, but the peak in the morning and the time of onset in CO 2 increase during the evening both shifted by one hour ahead. The results were consistent with concept that CO 2 generation rates from building occupants generally increases with their physical activity levels (Persily and de Jonge, 2017) and the idea that students usually spent more time in the dormitory and were more active in their dormitory rooms on the weekends. This potentially resulted in a greater exposure risk on the weekends for the students when they were staying in their rooms, because they generated more bioaerosols and had greater inhalation rate. Moreover, according to the survey data, the students spent on average 11.9 h in their rooms. It's conceivable that most of these hours were spent during the night. Therefore, ARI transmissions in the LVB could have most likely occurred during the nighttime while all residents were asleep, breathing at a constant rate, and providing a constant infectious bioaerosols source flow. Fig. 7 compares the measured and calculated data in 9 HVB rooms and 12 LVB rooms. The simulated CO 2 concentrations had few variations between the HVB rooms because the room ventilation rates were determined by the DOAS system, almost independent to outside wind conditions. In contract, the simulated CO 2 concentrations greatly varied between the rooms in the LVB with infiltration ventilation, as well as the experimental data.
