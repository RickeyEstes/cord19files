In this study, the collection efficiency of aerosolized viruses was evaluated for four different bioaerosol samplers (Andersen 1-STG impactor, AGI-30 impinger, gelatin filter, and nuclepore polycarbonate filter) using four bacteriophages (MS2, phi X174, T7 and phi 6). In addition, the effect of storage temperature, storage time, and collection media on the collection efficiency of an AGI-30 impinger was evaluated.
