The naïve model uses the latest available value as a forecast. The best ARIMA model with a log transformation was determined by analyzing the autocorrelation and partial correlation of the time series. The inputs of the ANN models, as well as the number of G. Xie, et al. Annals of Tourism Research 81 (2020) 102891 hidden nodes, were determined by trial-and-error testing, in order to minimize the mean square error of training. As for the GRNN models, the number of hidden nodes are the same as the number of input dimensions. The parameters of the single models are listed in Table 1 , where N(3-4-1) denotes a neural network with three input nodes, four hidden nodes, and one output neuron. On the basis of CEEMDAN, the decomposed components of the tourist arrival numbers from China are shown in Fig. 3 . In the calculation of the PE value, m = 4. Let θ=0.5. That is, a component with a PE value lower than 0.5 is low complexity, whereas a component with a PE value of no lower than 0.5 is high complexity. The decomposed components with PE values below the threshold value θ were combined into a new reconstructed component. For each source market, most components remain in an unaltered state of complexity when the scale changes. Relatively few components may be assigned either high complexity or low complexity designations with various scales. For these types of components, the PE value increases at small scales. After reaching the maximum entropy, the PE value becomes stable as the scale factor increases. Related research indicates that PE values are unstable at large scales, because the coarse-graining procedure reduces the  According to the results of the nine sources in Table 5 and Table 6 , for both point and interval forecasts, the ARIMA models have higher predictive accuracy than naïve models in one-step-ahead prediction. Meanwhile, the ANN models (BPNN, GRNN and ENN) perform better than the ARIMA models in most cases. The ENN model shows greater stability and better forecasting performance than BPNN and GRNN models. The ARIMA model can achieve higher predictive accuracy in the USA and UK time series than in other sources. The reason for this finding may be that the time series of these two sources are more stable and less complex than those of other sources. Comparatively, the MAPE values and Winkler scores of the ARIMA model in Thailand are relatively high. The reason for this finding maybe that the turbulent political situation in Thailand makes the conditions encountered travel abroad more volatile. Compared with the STL-ENN and single models, the EMD-based models (EMD-ENN, EEMD-ENN and CEEMDAN-ENN) can all achieve higher predictive accuracy in point forecasting. Similarly, the EMD-based models outperform the STL-ENN and single models in interval forecasting in most cases. From the measurement criteria for the forecasting models and the different source markets, the proposed model can achieve the most accurate prediction results in both point and interval forecasting with all different prediction horizons (h = 1, 3, 6). The tourism demand forecasting applications relating to tourist arrivals from the nine sources used in this study demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed decomposition-ensemble approach. From the DM test results of the out-of-sample datasets from different source markets in Table 7 , it is clear that all the DM statistics from the proposed model are less than −1.604, which corresponds to p-values of less than 0.10. This result clearly indicates that the proposed model significantly outperforms other models, at a 90% confidence level. Except for the CEEMDAN-ENN model and the USA, the DM statistics from the proposed model are less than −1.726, which corresponds to p-values of less than 0.05. These results indicate that the proposed model significantly outperformed these reference models, at a 95% confidence level. In particular, the proposed model performs better for Singapore and Thailand than for other countries of origin. The reason may be that the time series of tourist arrivals from these two origin countries are more non-stationary and complex, which can be processed well by the proposed model. On the whole, the DM test results suggest that the proposed model can be more capable than other models used for forecasting tourism demand.
