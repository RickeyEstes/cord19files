When a signal was detected, it was considered to be positive. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a fundamental tool for diagnostic test evaluation [24] . In an ROC curve the true positive rate (sensitivity) is plotted as a function of the false positive rate (100 Ã€ specificity) for different cutoff points of a parameter. Each point on the ROC curve represents a sensitivityspecificity pair corresponding to a particular decision threshold. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a measure of how well a parameter can distinguish between 2 diagnostic groups (diseased/ normal). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of cellular porin chip kit were calculated.
