In this study, we observed a decreased amount of peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2), peroxiredoxin 4 (PRDX4), and peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) upon LCMV infection. Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are members of an ubiquitous family of thiol-specific peroxidases that reduce mainly hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) to water with the use of reducing equivalents provided through the thioredoxin system (Wood et al., 2003) . To confirm the alteration in the abundance of peroxiredoxins during LCMV infection, we selected the most affected PRDX4 for Western blot analysis. Figure 5A shows an almost identical decrease in the expression of PRDX4 (−2.05) in infected cells as we observed in the 2D-DIGE analysis (−2.08). Since one of the major functions of Prxs is cellular protection against oxidative stress, we hypothesized that decreased levels of these antioxidant proteins may lead to an elevation of the ROS content in infected cells. The measurement of ROS generation in mock-and LCMV-infected cells supported our prediction. We revealed significantly higher production of ROS (1.76-fold) in LCMV-infected cells than in mock-infected cells ( Figure 5B) . Interestingly, another antioxidant enzyme, thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1), was more abundant in infected cells (Table 1 ), yet this seems to be insufficient to counterbalance the decrease in the levels of peroxiredoxins. In order to determine whether the increased ROS level described above is unique to the MX-infected HeLa cells or can also be seen in other cell lines, we decided to use A549 lung epithelial cells, which are commonly used as an in vitro model system for arenavirus infections. Similar to HeLa cells, we detected a 1. Figure S2A) .
