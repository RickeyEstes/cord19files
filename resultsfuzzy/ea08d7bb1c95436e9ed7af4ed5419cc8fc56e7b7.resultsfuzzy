As seen from Table 1 , RVNA titres>0.5 IU/mL, indicative of sero-conversion for rabies, developed by day 14 in all groups of mice immunized with pIRES-Rgp or pIRES-Rgp-Myd. We observed the highest RVNA titres in the group that received two doses of Rabipur (8 IU/mL), followed by the group immunized with pIRES-Rgp-Myd (3.2 IU/mL). Notably, pIRES-Rgp-Myd induced ~3.2 fold higher levels of antibodies than pIRES-Rgp (p<0.05) at this time point. The RVNA titres increased further in the groups, after the booster dose on day 21 (Table 1) . On day 28, the highest titres of neutralizing antibodies were still seen in the Rabipur group (14.4 IU/mL). Mice immunized with pIRES-Rgp-Myd showed a mean titre of 11.2 IU/mL. The mean titre observed in groups immunized with pIRES-Rgp at this point was 3.6 IU/mL. The RVNA titres increased >3-fold in these groups, following the booster dose on day 21. The RVNA titres following intramus-cular immunization with pIRES-Rgp-Myd were 3.1-fold higher than those induced by pIRES-Rgp at this point (p<0.05). Among the intradermally immunized groups, the highest RVNA titres at day 14 were detected in the group immunized with Rabipur (8 IU/mL) ( Table 1) . pIRES-Rgp-Myd and pIRES-Rgp induced titres of 3.0 and 0.96 IU/mL respectively, at this time point. We observed a 2.5-fold increase in RVNA titre following a booster with pIRES-Rgp-Myd, whereas the pIRES-Rgp booster increas ed it by 3.6-fold.
