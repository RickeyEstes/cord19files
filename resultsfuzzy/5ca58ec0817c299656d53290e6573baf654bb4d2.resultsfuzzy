VZV was cultured from both the patient's and the nurse's vesicular fluid. No other pathogens were identified. Typing of viruses from both sources showed VZV genotype A (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention M type). The R1 variable region length and pattern of nucleotide repeats were identical in the two isolates. From analysis of the video footage of the model water tank (Figure 1) , it can be seen that after the door was opened to about 458 [ Figure 1 Genotype A is found in fewer than 10% of strains circulating in the UK. 2 The R1 region comprises variable numbers of nucleotide repeats and is highly polymorphic. These R1 sequences in the patient and the nurse were identical. These results therefore indicate nosocomial transmission of VZV from the patient to the nurse. The simple water tank and food dye model shows that movement of air from opening the door could have resulted in the exposure of the susceptible nurse to airborne VZV from the patient in the isolation room ( Figure 1 ). Although the negativepressure system inside the isolation room would have acted to reduce the movement of infectious air from inside to outside across the open doorway, the negative-pressure gradient may have been transiently reversed if the door-opening motion was too rapid. Such behaviour of airflows across open doorways has been well described, and depends on the temperature and density of the air, the velocity of door opening, and the angle to which the door is opened. 3 Based on these principles, Figure 2 showing a three-dimensional view of possible airflow trajectories induced by the movement of the door opening into a hypothetical isolation room. The red (dark) face represents a person entering the room, through the doorway, who may be exposed to infectious air. (c) Same view from inside the room as illustrated in (b), but this time showing the possible airflow trajectories taking into account the temperature and density differences between cooler air outside (in the corridor) and warmer air inside a hypothetical isolation room. At the doorway itself, differences in air temperature and density with height are marked by the faces: red (dark) face, head height; blue (light) face, just above the floor. inside (red, dark arrows) circulating around the open door are present. Thus, a person (represented by the red dark face) walking into this area of air circulation would be exposed to and may inhale infectious air emerging from the isolation room. The negative-pressure gradient may also have been transiently reversed if the temperature gradient across the doorway was too steep. Figure 2 (c) shows that if a temperature gradient existed between the warm air inside the room and the cooler air outside, this would have created a 'two-way buoyancy flow'. This would have encouraged the warm air to rise as it flowed out of the room (red, dark arrows), while cool air from the corridor flowed in at floor level (blue, light arrows). This potentially increased the exposure of the nurse to infected room air (as shown by the red, dark arrows) leaving the room at head level (as shown by the red, dark face). In this case report, the hinged door opened into the patient's isolation room, which was at a negative pressure of approximately 3 Pa. Although previous guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 4 required a minimum of 0.25 Pa of negative pressure, this requirement has been replaced by the American Institute of Architects' guidelines 5 that recommend a minimum of 2.5 Pa of negative pressure. In the UK, a recent recommendation by the National Health Service Estates Agency 6 has adopted a slightly different approach. Instead of a negative pressure in the isolation room, the outside corridor pressure will be at a positive pressure of 10 Pa. This will have a similar aerosol containment effect but it is likely to be more effective at this higher pressure difference. Aerosolized VZV DNA has been detected in the environment around patients with varicella and shingles, and the nosocomial transmission of VZV via aerosol is well established. 7,8 Therefore, there is a distinct possibility that despite the negative pressure inside the room, transmission of VZV may have occurred via infectious aerosol as the nurse stood at the door. In summary, we report a case of nosocomial transmission of VZV to a nurse that may have occurred via aerosol transmission, despite negative-pressure isolation of the infected patient. Other infectious agents, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome 9 and tuberculosis, 10 are also transmitted by aerosol and may pose a similar risk. Sliding rather than hinged doors (with an airlocklike arrangement) or an anteroom at the entrance would reduce airflow perturbation caused by staff entering the isolation room through the door. This cross-infection incident should not be taken as a warning that all existing negative-pressure rooms will inevitably fail. However, care should be taken in reducing adverse airflow and bidirectional flow through a doorway when the door is open. Thus, this case report recommends that susceptible personnel should not stand at the entrances of isolation rooms containing patients with respiratory infections since, despite negative pressure, nosocomial transmission via an airborne route may still be possible.
