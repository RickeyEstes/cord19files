Toroviruses and group A betacoronaviruses (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae; collectively referred to as nidoviruses throughout) are positive-strand RNA viruses of mammals. Their HEs share a common evolutionary origin with the influenza C hemagglutinin-esterase fusion protein (HEF) and were added to the respective virus proteomes relatively recently (de Groot, 2006; Zeng et al., 2008) . In the course of evolution, nidovirus HEs with novel SOAE substrate and lectin ligand specificities arose. In one lineage of rodent coronaviruses, HE ligand and substrate specificity shifted toward 4-O-Ac-Sias. Most nidovirus HEs, however, resemble influenza C virus HEF in that they bind to 9-O-Ac-Sias in a 9-O-acetyl-dependent fashion and function as sialate-9-O-acetylesterases (de Groot, 2006 ). Yet, even among this latter group of HEs, subtle but salient differences in SOAE substrate preference are apparent. For instance, porcine torovirus (PToV) HEs preferentially cleave 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias, while those of bovine toroviruses (BToVs) display a preference for 7,9-di-O-acetylated substrates (Langereis et al., 2009; Smits et al., 2005) . Also, the HEs of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and influenza C virus, while more promiscuous in SOAE substrate usage, do show a predilection for 7,9-di-or 9-mono-O-acetylated substrates, respectively ( Figure S2A ). All HEs readily cleave O-acetyl groups both from 5-N-Gc-and 5-N-Ac-Sias, with some HEs displaying a modest preference for the latter type (Figure S2B ; for a summary of HE SOAE substrate specificities, see Figure S2C ). To investigate whether SOAE substrate preference for 7,9-dior 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias reflects lectin ligand fine specificity, we expressed a comprehensive set of nidovirus HEs as Fc fusion proteins (Table S1 ) with the esterase inactivated through an active site Ser-to-Ala substitution (HEs with inactive SOAE are referred to as HE 0 throughout; enzymatically active HEs are referred to as HE + ). Nidovirus HEs: Virolectins of Different Receptor Specificity HE 0 -Fc virolectins were tested for Sia binding and ligand specificity by hemagglutination assay with rat red blood cells (RBCs) and by solid-phase lectin binding assay (sp-LBA) with bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM), a natural O-glycosylated sialoglycoconjugate exceptionally rich in (a2-6)-linked O-Ac-Sias (for an extensive analysis of BSM Sia content, pivotal to this study, see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures, Figures S1C and S1D, and Tables S2 and S3) . Hemagglutination was observed for all nidovirus HEs. Pretreating RBCs with sialidase prevented hemagglutination, indicating that in each case, agglutination was Sia-dependent (data not shown). Selective depletion of 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias from the cell surface with PToV HE + prevented hemagglutination by HE 0 -Fc of PToV strains Markelo and P4 but left that by BCoV, equine coronavirus (ECoV), and BToV virolectins largely unaffected. Conversely, depletion of 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sias with BToV-Breda HE + prevented hemagglutination by BCoV, ECoV, and BToV HEs but did not reduce agglutination by PToV HE. De-Oacetylation with BCoV HE + , which accepts both 9-mono-and 7,9-di-O-acetylated substrates ( Figure S2 ), abrogated hemagglutination by all virolectins ( Figure 1A ). In solid-phase assays, all HEs, except for 4-O-Ac-Sia-specific MHV-S HE 0 , bound to BSM in a 9-O-Ac-Sia-dependent fashion (data not shown), albeit with markedly varied affinities ( Figure 1B ). Those of ECoV-NC99, BCoV-Mebus and -LUN, and PToV-P4 bound exceptionally well and were therefore studied further. In accordance with the hemagglutination analyses, binding of ECoV-NC99, BCoV-Mebus, and BCoV-LUN HE 0 was lost upon SOAE predigestion of BSM with either BCoV or BToV HE + but relatively resistant to de-O-acetylation of Sias by PToV HE + . Conversely, binding of PToV-P4 HE 0 was highly sensitive to pretreatment of BSM with PToV HE + , less sensitive to BCoV HE + , and even far less so to BToV HE + ( Figure 1C) . Apparently, the differences between the ECoV and BCoV HEs on the one hand and PToV-P4 HE on the other arise from a preference or intolerance for di-O-acetylation at the Sia glycerol side chain. As a direct test, we performed sp-LBA with BSM, chemoenzymatically converted to carry 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias exclusively ( Figure 1D ). To this end, BSM was first digested with excess BCoV HE + to selectively remove all Sia-9-O-acetyl moieties Top: experimental outline.

Bottom: sp-LBA as in (B). See also Figure S1 and Table S1 . while leaving 7-O-acetyl groups attached. In result, binding of both BCoV-LUN and PToV-P4 HE 0 was lost ( Figure 1D ), formally demonstrating that Sia-9-O-acetylation is a strict requirement and that 7-mono-O-Ac-Sias do not serve as ligands. Upon pH/ temperature-induced C7-to-C9 migration of O-acetyl moieties (Kamerling et al., 1987) as to produce 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias, binding of PToV-P4 HE 0 was restored to levels even beyond those in native BSM (note that in native BSM, the amount of 7-O-Ac-and 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sias combined is almost twice that of 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias; Tables S2 and S3). Binding of BCoV-LUN HE 0 , how-ever, was restored only partially ( Figure 1D ). The results show that PToV-P4 HE 0 is a high-specificity lectin for 9-mono-O-Ac-Sia. Conversely, BCoV-Mebus and BCoV-LUN HE 0 accept 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias but bind to 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sias with much higher affinity (Figures 2A and 2B ). Although the BCoV and ECoV HEs would seem to favor 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sias, their binding characteristics in sp-LBA indicate a difference in ligand preference. The ECoV-NC99 binding curve is suggestive of high-affinity binding to select glycotopes that are present in BSM in amounts considerably lower than those of Non-modified BSM (native); BSM, mono-specific for 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias (9-O-Ac-BSM), or 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sias (7,9-O-Ac-BSM); BSM, depleted for all O-Ac-Sias (de-O-Ac-BSM). Relative binding (in percentages) was calculated with binding to native BSM set at 100%. BSM preparations were calibrated by dilution in coating buffer such as to ensure that the amounts of remaining O-Ac-Sia species in 9-O-Ac-and 7,9-di-O-Ac-BSM preparations were comparable to those in native BSM.

Note the proximity of the L 161 side-chain to the Sia-7-O-Ac-methyl ($3.8 Å ), favorable for van der Waals interaction, and the burying of hydrophobic surface. BCoV HE ( Figure 1B) . Thus, ECoV HE may preferentially bind to a subpopulation of the BCoV HE ligands or bind a distinct 9-O-Ac-Sia variant altogether. The combined results establish that the ECoV-NC99, BCoV-Mebus/LUN and PToV-P4 virolectins each have distinct ligand preferences and distinguish between closely related 9-O-Ac-Sia populations. Structural Evidence that BCoV HE Preferably Binds 7,9-Di-O-Ac-Sias The structure of BCoV-Mebus HE, complexed with a synthetic 9-O-Ac-Sia analog, was solved to 1.8 Å (Zeng et al., 2008) . BCoV-LUN HE differs from that of BCoV-Mebus in only seven residues, one of which is in a loop at the rim of the Sia binding site ( Figure 2C ). This single amino acid variation (T 114 in BCoV-Mebus, I 114 in BCoV-LUN HE) fully accounts for the observed 3-fold difference in binding affinity toward BSM (Figures 1B and 2D) . Apparently, the Thr/Ile substitution does not alter lectin ligand preference for 7,9-di-O-over 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias; as compared to BCoV-Mebus HE, LUN HE displays equally increased affinities for either Sia type ( Figure 2A ). Based on the position of T 114 relative to the bound ligand, its exchange by Ile may affect, directly or indirectly, binding site interactions with the Sia-5-N-acyl moiety. Although not immediately obvious from replacement modeling how this would be achieved, such interactions may raise binding affinity for Sia per se but, as indicated by glycan array analysis (vide infra), also alter the lectin's relative preference for 5-N-Ac-or 5-N-Gc-Sias. To determine the structural basis for BCoV HE's ligand preference for di-O-Ac-Sias over 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias, we examined the lectin-Sia interface with particular focus on protein-sugar interactions at the Sia glycerol side chain. The Sia 9-O-Ac group, crucial to receptor binding, docks into a hydrophobic pocket. The vicinity of Sia glycerol atom C8 is crowded such that substitution of an O-Ac moiety for the C8 hydroxyl is not possible without introducing steric strain. Hence, the structure of the BCoV HE receptor binding site appears incompatible with binding of 8-O-Ac-Sias. There is, however, ample space to accommodate modifications at C7. Moreover, modeling of Neu5,7,9Ac 3 in the lectin binding site revealed potential interactions between the Sia-7-O-Ac moiety and the side chains of F 211 and L 161 that could contribute to the lectin's preference for 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sias ( Figure 2E ). Accordingly, L 161 A substitution strongly decreased binding to BSM, yet, as demonstrated for BCoV-LUN HE, high-affinity binding to 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sias was affected more than low-affinity binding to 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias ( Figure 2A ). In effect, ligand fine specificity was lost, the substitution causing the BCoV-LUN HE L 161 A mutant to now bind each receptor type equally poorly.
