Viruses that seem to replicate only in mosquito but not in vertebrate cells were first discovered within the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. Well-known members of this so-called insect-specific group include cell fusing agent virus, Kamiti River virus, and Culex flavivirus (reviewed in [24] ). These insect-specific viruses are thought to be maintained in insects only, and to represent ancestral or primordial forms of the vector-borne flaviviruses. Insect-specific flaviviruses have been divided into Aedes-associated and Culex-associated viruses, respectively. Recent findings of related flaviviruses in mosquito species of other genera [25, 26] suggest a much higher diversity of yet-to-be discovered insect-specific flaviviruses. Interestingly, a clade of potentially insectspecific viruses that replicate in mosquito cells but not in vertebrate cells or newborn mice was discovered within the diversity of mosquito-borne viruses. This clade currently has now three members including Nounané virus isolated from Uranotaenia mashonaensis mosquitoes originating from the Taï National Park in Cô te d'Ivoire [27] , Lammi virus isolated from Aedes cinereus mosquitoes collected in Finland [28] , and Nanay virus, a virus recently isolated from Culex ocossa collected in the Amazonian rainforest near Iquitos, Peru [29] . The diversity of mosquito-associated flaviviruses was further extended by the detection of flavivirus-like sequences integrated within the genomes of Aedes mosquitoes [30] .
