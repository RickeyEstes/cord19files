From September 1, 2003, through December 31, 2007, there were 41 761 hospital admissions owing to LRTI in Sa Kaeo and Nakhon Phanom Provinces. Of the 22 857 (55%) patients with CXRs and who were eligible for enrollment, 10 097 (49%) were enrolled, of whom 573 (5%) had evidence of HPIV infection. Of 573 patients with evidence of HPIV infection, 189 (33%) had HPIV-1, 54 (9%) had HPIV-2, 305 (53%) had HPIV-3, and 27 (5%) were untyped; two patients had coinfections with 2 HPIV serotypes (HPIV-1 + -2 and HPIV-2 + -3). Of the 404 patients in the 2 years with both RT-PCR and serology results, 76% were detected by RT-PCR only, 7AE4% by serology only, and 17% by both methods. 17 Five HPIV specimens were detected by only virus isolation. Mixed viral infections were identified in 48 (8AE4%) patients with HPIV detection: 4% with influenza viruses, 3% with adenovirus, and 2% with RSV. Of 468 HPIV patients with CXRs evaluated, 85% had radiographic evidence of pneumonia (interstitial infiltrates 63%, alveolar infiltrates 21%, consolidation 9%). Among the 573 patients with evidence of HPIV infection, the most common signs and symptoms of respiratory infection were fever (69%, 51% with temperature ‡38 and 18% with reported fever only), cough (98%), sputum production (62%), and tachypnea (54%). Other signs and symptoms included rhonchi (48%), rales ⁄ crepitation (41%), wheezing (31%), chest pain (6%), and hemoptysis (2%). One hundred and 89 (33AE2%) HPIV-positive patients required oxygen therapy, and six needed mechanical ventilation. There was no marked difference in frequency of signs and symptoms at admission by HPIV type. Of the 573 HPIV-positive patients, six (1AE0%) died, two aged 68 and 71 years with HPIV-1, and four aged 39, 58, 69, and 76 years with HPIV-3. Of the six deaths, one also had an influenza virus detected. From January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2007, the proportion of enrolled patients with HPIV was higher for infants aged <1 year (9%) and children aged 1-4 years (9%) than for children aged 5-9 years (6%) and 10-19 years (3%) and adults aged 20-64 years (2%) and ‡65 years (3%) ( Table 2) . Fifty-nine percent of HPIV-infected patients were male. Infants aged <1 year had the highest rate of HPIV-associated hospitalized respiratory disease (486 per 100 000 personyears) and radiographically confirmed pneumonia (229 per 100 000 person-years). Rates decreased among older age groups. Persons aged 10-19 years had the lowest rates of HPIV-associated hospitalized respiratory disease (4 per 100 000 person-years) and radiographically confirmed pneumonia (2 per 100 000 person-years). The rate of HPIV-associated hospitalized respiratory disease among males was 15 per 100 000 person-years and among females was 11 per 100 000 person-years. Among specific HPIV serotypes, most infections were detected in children 1-4 aged years for all three serotypes (Table 3)
