Position g Mutants of the GCN4 Leucine Zipper The extensively investigated GCN4 leucine zipper has provided a key model system for analysis of the hydrophobic heptad repeat pattern and structural selectivity in coiled coils (Harbury et al., 1993; O'Shea et al., 1991) . The apolar interface of the parent doublestranded coiled coil is formed by interhelical association in a parallel orientation between residues at the a and d positions (O'Shea et al., 1991) . Electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged amino acid residues at the e and g positions of different helices also can contribute to dimerization specificity (Kohn et al., 1998; O'Shea et al., 1992 O'Shea et al., , 1993 . The recombinant leucine zipper peptide GCN4-pR includes four g positions: Lys9, Lys16, Glu23, and Leu30 ( Figure 1 ). To investigate the effect of a 3-3-1 hydrophobic residue repeat on helix association and interface specificity, we simultaneously mutated Lys9, Lys16, and Glu23 of GCN4-pR to the small aliphatic amino acids alanine and valine. The resulting mutants were designated GCN4-pA and GCN4-pV, respectively. These leucine zipper peptides were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by reverse-phase HPLC.
