5.5.2.1. China. China's economic growth is a successful model for other communist countries. Since the decision to implement a "planned market economy" three decades ago, China's economy has continued to grow despite Asia's financial downturn in the late 1990s. To curb speculation, the Chinese government adopted macro-economic controls in the early 2000s, causing a four-year decline. Since financial renewal and two-digit growth in 2005, the stock market in China has continued to climb new heights, as shown in Fig. 1 (a) . Rapid economic growth in China led to significant appreciation of urban real estate markets in areas such as Beijing, Shanghai, and other coastal cities. However, real estate in inland areas experienced slower growth during the sample period, widening the gap between coast and inland. Analysis found no causality relationship between stock and real estate markets in China from March 1995 to June 2010. There may be several reasons for this. First, real estate markets in China include many regions and cities. The real estate index employed in this study may not reflect the trend of one specific region or city. An alternative approach to overcome this shortcoming is to use the index of different regions or cities for further concise conclusions. Second, China's population of over 1.2 billion are all looking for homes after the end of the public ownership system prevailing during the early Communist era. Real state market trends and their relationship with other markets before there is equilibrium between supply and demand is difficult to determine. Third, both the stock market and especially the housing market, are profoundly influenced by Chinese government intervention (taxation, credit control, construction permits and so on). These factors may contribute to the lack of causality relationship between the stock and real estate markets in China. 5.5.2.2. Hong Kong. Hong Kong is considered one of the most liberal markets in the world. The Hong Kong government has cultivated a market economy for almost a century. However, its economy is easily influenced by the political environment of the region, especially the relationship between China and the United States, and between China and Taiwan. Hong Kong's capital fled the stock market prior to 1997 due to the uncertainty involved in Hong Kong's return to China and in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis. The Hang Seng Stock Index plunged to a historic low. After China guaranteed the free development of the economy, Hong Kong regained market momentum. Then in 2003, the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic ravaged Hong Kong's stock market. Not until Hong Kong was opened to mainland Chinese tourism and the signing of the "Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement" (CEPA) did stock market momentum in Hong Kong revive, as shown in Fig. 1 (b) . The decline of Hong Kong's real estate market over the last 15 years is also related to the larger economic and political circumstances. Both markets plunged in 1997 due to Hong Kong's return to China. The stock market fluctuated then rebounded in 2003 after the end of global deflation and SARS. The real estate market also recovered in 2003, as shown in Fig. 2  Granger causality analysis shows no causality relationship between the stock and real estate market trends in Hong Kong from March 1995 to June 2010 (see Table 6 ). This is reasonable since Hong Kong's stock market is more international and closely related with the overall economy of Hong Kong. In contrast, Hong Kong's real estate market was much more intensely influenced by the political transition in 1997. Emigration and loss of confidence in real estate did not reverse as quickly as recovery in the stock market. 5.5.2.3. Japan. Japan is the most developed economy in Asia; it therefore has a special role as a regional leader. Rapid economic growth from the 1970s to the 1980s in Japan caused the Japanese Yen to appreciate significantly. This appreciation rose sharply in the late 1980s, from an exchange rate of 242 yen to one US dollar in 1985, to 128 yen to the dollar in 1988. Export industries were severely injured by appreciation. To stimulate investment in the hope of continuing economic growth, the government reduced interest rates from 5% to 2.5% in 1986, causing a boom in the stock and real estate markets. To control the resulting rises in asset prices and inflation, Japan raised interest rates in 1990, this time resulting in long-term economic recession. In order to stimulate investment and the economy, the Japanese government reduced the interest rates again and fell into a "liquidity trap". The stock and real estate markets in Japan were significantly affected by changes in interest rates and the overall economy. The Granger test showed no causality relationship between the stock and real estate markets from March 1995 to June 2010 in Japan. From Figs. 1(c) and 2(c), it is obvious that stock markets in Japan fluctuate with the overall economy. Yet the real estate market remained sluggish during the sample period. This may be due to the fact that maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for real estate financing in Japan could reach 120% in the 1980s. The over-leveraging eventually led to a long-term recession in its real estate market. This may be one reason no causality relationship was found between the stock and real estate markets in Japan. 5.5.2.4. Singapore. Asset markets in Singapore were severely affected by the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the government introduced several measures to stimulate economic growth. Limits on foreign investment were greatly reduced, and international companies were encouraged to go public in Singapore. These measures gradually attracted international investors, and stock and real estate markets revived. In 2000, the overall economy, including the asset markets, was again hit by falls in stock market values of information technology industry ("dot com"). Stock and real estate markets did not pick up until 2003, after the end of worldwide deflation [see Fig. 1 (d) and 2 (d)]. Results of the causality test show a uni-directional leading effect from the real estate to the stock market in Singapore (see Table 6 ). This may be attributed to the fact that the land and housing in Singapore is mostly (around 80%) owned and controlled by the government. The revival of the real estate market may serve as a signal for other investment vehicles and confidence in Singapore. 5.5.2.5. South Korea. South Korea is one of the "Four Dragons" of Asia. Its economy was severely affected by the Asian financial crisis in 1997, with stock and real estate markets plunging to historic lows. The collapse of the global information technology industry in 2000 and rising default levels on credit card debt further affected the overall economy and asset markets in South Korea. Markets recovered afterwards with the global economy. The government launched a series of financial reforms with the assistance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but it was only in 2001 that the economy regained momentum and the stock and real estate markets began to recover. Trends in the stock and real estate markets in South Korea are shown in Figs. 1 (e) and 2 (e). The causality results are reported in Table 6 . No causality relationship between the stock and real estate markets was found. This may be explained by the fact that the stock and real estate markets in South Korea attract sharply differing investors. As a result, neither the stock market nor the real estate market can serve as the leading indicator for the other. 5.5.2.6. Taiwan. Taiwan experienced a peak in economic growth in the 1980s. This led to a surge in the stock and real estate markets. The stock markets increased from a weighted index of 2000 in 1986 to 12,000 in 1991. During the same period, the real estate market appreciated threefold. In 1997, the stock market in Taiwan was affected by the Asian financial crisis, but rebounded within a year. When the U.S. information technology industry bubble burst in the late 1990s, however, Taiwan's electronics industry was hit hard. The bubble's collapse coincided with a major earthquake in 1999, and as a result stock markets in Taiwan dropped by approximately 3000 points. The SARS epidemic in 2003 prolonged the slump in Taiwan's economy. In 2004, the stock market in Taiwan finally regained momentum with the end of the worldwide deflation and global economic recovery [see Fig. 1(e) ]. The real estate market in Taiwan has tended to move in a pattern similar to the stock market for the past decade, as shown in Fig. 2(e) . Various policies, including thousands of billions of NT dollars in low-rate mortgages to encourage real estate investment, were announced after the Asian financial crisis, but the real estate market did not pick up until after the SARS epidemic of 2003. Causality test results for Taiwan found a uni-directional leading effect from the real estate to the stock market, as shown in Table 6 . There may be several reasons for this. First, there has been a housing shortage of approximately 7% (70,000 units) in Taipei city for the past decade. The traditional preference for real estate investment is driven by the housing shortage, high population density, and the employment opportunity. Second, metropolitan Taipei accounts for over 1/3 of the population in Taiwan, and the value of the real estate in Taipei represent a significant proportion of the entire country. The combination of these factors encouraged the escalation of housing prices in Taipei, leading to an annual average 10% appreciation for the past decade. It is therefore not surprising that real estate plays a leading role for other investment vehicles in Taiwan. All results in Table 6 for Taiwan show a uni-directional relationship between the stock and real estate markets. In summary, the null hypothesis, that the real estate index is not influenced by the stock market index, is rejected in Singapore and Taiwan over the sample period. This indicates that the real estate index may be used to forecast stock index in these two countries. In other words, the real estate market led the stock market and had a significant impact on the stock market in both countries, indicating people's preference for real assets and the homeownership.
