Fig. 1 shows the initial particle size distribution. The data represent the average of 9 tests. It is seen that the particles of d a E0.04-0.5 mm were dominant (DC/Dlog d a ranged from $10 4 to 410 5 cm À3 ), while larger particles of d a E1-2 mm were present at lower concentration levels (DC/Dlog d a $10 2 -10 3 cm À3 ). The initial (t=0) aerosol concentration of each measured particle size fraction was reproducible with the variability not exceeding 40% for 9 replicates. The evolution of the non-dimensional particle fractional concentration due to the natural decay is shown in Fig. 2 . The non-monotonic fractional decay curves reflect the variety of physical mechanisms involved in the aerosol transport even if no ventilation is introduced in the indoor environment (Vincent, 1995) . The particles of smaller (d a o0.2 mm) and larger (d a 40.8 mm) fractions demonstrated greater decay than those of an intermediate range. The smaller particles are naturally removed from the air through depositing on indoor surfaces primarily due to the effect of diffusion, which becomes more pronounced with the decreasing particle size. In addition, the aerosol concentration of smaller particles decreases due to their coagulation with larger ones. The larger particles are subjected to the inertial deposition and gravitational sedimentation, which both increase with the increasing particle size. The above effects are relatively weak in the intermediate size range of E0.2-0.8 mm. The available gravitational settling models [tranquil or stirred (Hinds, 1999) ] cannot accurately predict the natural decay rate observed in this study (in the absence of air ionization by an emitter). Our experimental data demonstrated that the concentration decay was twice as rapid as had been predicted by the above models for larger particles. This difference may be attributed to the intrinsic flow instability associated with the ELPI operation and other factors that enhance the particle deposition on surfaces. Also, the experimental equipment inside the chamber introduced some extra indoor surfaces, in addition to the floor, thereby increasing the natural particle deposition rate as compared to the gravitational settling models. Although the natural decay shown in Fig. 2 for the fine and ultrafine particles is sharper than it is predicted by theoretical models, it is still very slow for effective air cleaning: it takes 30 min to achieve a concentration decrease by about 10-30% and an hour to achieve approximately 20-50% drop. The unipolar ion emission may accelerate the aerosol concentration decay significantly. The air cleaning factors are presented in Table 1a for VI-2500 and  Table 1b for AS150MM (+) and AS150MM (À). Resulting from a 15-minute operation of the VI-2500 (which has the highest emission rate among the tested ionic air purifiers), the particles were removed from indoor air at the rate, which is greater than the natural decay rate by a factor of 5.071.1 to 6.870.7. A 30minute operation of VI-2500 surpassed the natural decay rate by a factor ranging from 15.372.6 to 33.675.5. This resulted in the removal of about 97% of 0.1 mm particles and about 95% of 1 mm particles from the air, in addition to the natural aerosol concentration decrease that occurred during the same time. The positive ion emission produced by AS150MM (+) and the negative ion emission produced by AS150MM (À) also significantly cleaned indoor air from the particles of 0.04-2 mm, but the ACF-values were not as high as those obtained for the more powerful VI-2500 (see Table 1 ). The difference between the data obtained for AS150MM(+) and AS150MM(À) was statistically insignificant. The arithmetic average of the p-values that represented each particle size fraction was p ¼ 0:19. In a 30-minute operation of AS150MM, the air cleaning rate surpassed the natural decay by a factor ranging from 2.170.4 to 3.471.6. A 60-minute operation of both AS150MM devices allowed reaching about twice greater ACF-values than their 30-minute operation. No statistically significant effect of the particle aerodynamic size on the air cleaning factor was observed p ¼ 0:18). The evolution of the non-dimensional particle fractional concentration with the time of ion emission is shown in Fig. 3 as a function of d a : VI-2500 (Fig. 3a) , AS150MM (+) (Fig. 3b) , and AS150MM (À) (Fig. 3c) . To standardize the ion emission rate characteristics of different emitters, we measured N i with the Air Ion Counter at a distance of 1 m from the source during the test. The ion densities provided by VI-2500, AS150MM (+), and AS150MM (À) were (1.3470.04) Â 10 6 e À cm À3 , (3.6270.18) Â 10 5 e + cm À3 , and (3.917 0.22) Â 10 5 e À cm À3 , respectively. The numbers in parenthesis in Fig. 3 indicate an average value of the measured N i (in elementary charges per cm 3 ). For each device, the ion emission during the first 3 min resulted in a statistically significant decrease of the aerosol concentration across the tested particle size range ( p ¼ 0:03). Continuous ion emission [an ''ion shower'' as referred to by Grabarczyk (2001) ] makes the particle removal effect time-dependent. Resulting from the continuous operation of VI-2500, the aerosol concentra-tion decreased more than 2-fold in 6 min,$3-fold in 9 min,$5 to10-fold in 15 min, and 420-fold in 30 min. Both the positive and negative AS150MM ion emitters also efficiently removed particles from indoor air, but not as rapidly as the more powerful VI-2500. The above decrease of the particle concentration was observed for the entire test particle size range. No significant effect of the particle size on the efficiency of air cleaning was found ( p ¼ 0:17). It was found that the particle electric charges of the initially generated aerosol were very low. On average, the ELPI measured less than one elementary charge per particle. In contrast, when an ion emitter operated, the airborne particles exhibited considerable charges (either positive or negative, depending on the polarity of the emitter). The particle charge distributions measured experimentally by the ELPI and calculated using Eq. (4) are presented in Fig. 4 in a logarithmic scale. The graphs represent the data obtained after the ionizers were operated for 3 min. It is seen that the average particle charge increases sharply with its size. The ion emission from VI-2500 increased the initial particle electric charges to$10 1 negative elementary charges per particle of 0.1 mm and to $10 2 negative elementary charges per particle of 1 mm. The ions emission from the AS150MM devices resulted in a lower, but still significant particle charge enhancement. The average deviations between the experimental results and the theoretical data across the entire test particle size range were about 31%, 23%, Table 1 The air cleaning factor (ACF) provided by continuous operation of the ion emitter: (a) VI-2500 and (b) AS150 mm (+)/(À) 24% for VI-2500, AS150MM (+), AS150MM (À) ion emitters, respectively. The theory underestimated the electric charge level for larger particles and overestimated it for smaller ones. The theoretical calculations utilized exclusively the diffusion charging model, as no external electric field was applied in our experimental setting. However, the ion densities produced by the emitters were so high that the ion flux itself could have generated a significant space electric field. The ion-induced space field might have resulted in additional charging of particles. For our experimental condition, we estimated that the field charging becomes significant relative to the diffusion charging when the particles are larger than $1 mm. Thus, the measured average electric charges of particles exceeding $1 mm are greater than their calculated values. The difference between the experimental and theoretical values is more pronounced at higher ion emission rates (this difference was greater for VI-2500 than for AS150MM). This also can be attributed to the ion-induced space field, which should increase with increasing ion emission rate. The overestimation of the measured data by the diffusion charging model observed for ultrafine particles can be explained by the limitation of the theoretical model. (Hinds, 1999) , respectively for each ion emitter: (a) VI-2500, (b) AS150MM (+), and (c) AS150MM (À). For experimental data, the standard deviation (of 3 replicates) did not exceed 6%; thus, the error bars are too small to be seen in the graphs.
