3.1. The overall structure and topology of Ape1 The crystal structure of Ape1 was determined using the single anomalous dispersion (SAD) approach with crystals of selenomethionine-derivatized protein (Table 1) . Ape1 crystallized in space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit (termed A and B; see Supplementary jF obs j À jF calc j = P hkl jF obs j. R free was computed identically except that all reflections belonged to a test set consisting of a 10% random selection of the data. domains, residues 100-103 and 222-226, and this suggests a tightly packed structure with a limited degree of N/C-lobe domain rearrangement or interaction (Figs. 2a and 2b) . This was further explored using the ElNémo normal-mode web server (Suhre & Sanejouand, 2004 ; http://www.igs.cnrs-mrs.fr/ elnemo/). A normal-mode analysis in the lowest energy conformations revealed negligible rearrangement of the N-or C-lobes ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ), although there were some predicted intermolecular movements within the lobes independently ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). The C-lobe consists of a central five-stranded parallel -sheet (1, 2, 15, 16 and 17) flanked on either side by 11 -helices (1-11) (Figs. 2a and 2b ) and the domain adopts the /-hydrolase fold that has previously been observed in other structurally characterized members of the SGNH hydrolase superfamily (Fig. 2c) (Desforges et al., 2013) . The fold of the N-lobe is a canonical -sandwich that consists of two antiparallel -sheets; 4, 7, 9, 10 and 12 are in sheet 1 and 3 5, 6, 8, 11 and 13 are in sheet 2 (Figs. 2a and 2b and Supplementary Fig. S3 ). Based on sequence analyses, the N-lobe was not predicted to resemble any structure currently in the PDB, but DALI and PDBeFold revealed that the fold matched that of the carbohydratebinding module of family 35 (CBM35; Fig. 2c ). These noncatalytic modules (CBMs) are frequently found in enzymes that need to be targeted to carbohydrate-associated substrates, and are commonly appended to plant cell-wall-degrading enzymes (Montanier et al., 2009) . The interaction of the N-lobe with a specific carbohydrate moiety would therefore possibly explain how Ape1 is able to select PGN when presented with an array of possible substrates in vivo (Montanier et al., 2009) . A more detailed analysis of the structure and substrate specificity of the N-lobe will be presented elsewhere.
