In this section, four SVM models based on amino acids composition, dipeptides composition, Chou's PseAAC and PSSM-400 are constructed respectively. The accuracies and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for these four SVM models are shown in Table 1 and Figure 5 . One can see that PSSM-400 encoding scheme performs better than the others with accuracy of 82.67% and AUC (Area Under Curve) of 0.926. Thus we use it as our final encoding scheme to represent antifreeze protein sequences. In order to further examine the prediction of power of the current classifier, we compare our predictor AFP_PSSM with the recent work of Kandaswamy et al. [27] on the testing dataset. The number of antifreeze proteins and non-antifreeze proteins in the testing dataset are highly imbalanced, and this situation is close to reality. The compared results are shown in Table 2 . As can be seen from the table, the predictor proposed in this study obtains accuracy of 90.17%, higher than the accuracy of 83.38% gained by [27] . The better prediction performance may be credited to the appropriate protein sequence encoding scheme adopted in our prediction model.
