CHIKV infection was laboratory-confi rmed for 152 (22%) symptomatic patients and 188 (26%) samples. Median IgG titer for all 156 IgG-positive samples was 2,560 (range 40-40,960). Median IgM titer for 136 IgM-positive samples was 320 (range 20-10,240). Median viral load for 50 RNA positive samples was 1.7 × 10 5 RNA copies/mL (range 1 × 10 3 -1.2 × 10 10 RNA copies/mL). Table 3 summarizes cross-sectional testing results for individual patients at time of fi rst visit. In the fi rst half of the year, the rate of confi rmed infection for patients with suspected CHIKV was 24.4%; in the second half, 9.9%. Although the numbers of laboratory tests were comparable in the fi rst and second half of the year (396 vs. 326), laboratory confi rmation rates in travelers were signifi cantly higher in the fi rst half (χ 2 test, p<0.001).
