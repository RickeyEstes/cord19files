In this section, we shall verify the correction and effectivity of the stability conditions in Theorems 2 and 3. In the first place, we shall show that the system (4) is asymptotically stable when the stability conditions in Theorem 2 are satisfied. According to the biologically practical meanings, without loss of generality, we let l = 1.5 Â 10 À3 , e = 0.85, g = 0.65, a = 0.88, n = 0.85, d = 0.85, b = 0.35. It is not difficult to obtain that there exists a symmetrical positive definite matrix P such that A T P + PA = ÀI: ; whose eigenvalues are 0.2212, 0.3088, 0.4920, 1.4456, and 13.8226. Thus we have k min (P) = 0.2212 and k max (P) = 13.8226. Since the bound of x(t) is less than 1, it follows that ak/4 6 1. In this case, we might as well let a = 0.45, b = 0.25, k = 8, N = 1000, z = 2.0 Â 10 À3 . The simulation results are depicted in Fig. 2 . From the results of numerical computation, we can see that if the stability conditions in Theorem 2 are satisfied, the system (4) is asymptotically stable. Furthermore, we shall verify the effectivity of Theorem 3. We assume that r = 500, h = 0.65. Then we have  We further find that the bound of Bv is 0.3375 < Bv < 0.6625, which implies that we can control the ratio of vaccination to newborn children, to interrupt the outbreak of the disease or to slow the transmission of the infectious disease. According to kx(t 0 ) k 6 63.25, we assume xðt 0 Þ ¼ 40 20 15 10 20 ½ T . It is not difficult to see that the system (4) is asymptotically stable when the stability conditions in Theorem 3 are satisfied. More importantly, we let r = 1.425 and the ultimate bound of the solutions of system (4) can be given by b = 479.1, which implies that the value of b works upon the transmission of the infectious disease, that is the growth function of the pathogens has a very close connection with the disease spread. The values of r and b are the conditions of influencing the stability of the system (4) and the ratio of vaccination to newborn children. Practically, government can control Bv by vaccinating the newborn children to delay the outbreak of the disease. From Fig. 3 , we can also see that during the initial stage, owing to vaccination to newborn children, the initial values of W and S do not equal to 0. As time goes on, if the conditions are satisfied, the system will be stable. At last, the infected individuals will achieve minimal number and the disease will be endemic diseases rather than diffused. It is shown from Fig. 4 that the speed of the viruses' growth descends faster as parameter a increases while it decreases and trends to zero as time t goes on. Furthermore, we can find that in the case of 0 < a < 1, when time t is about 2 days, the infectious rate of viruses is a constant, 0.3, which is independent on the parameter choice of x(t). Thus, we have t = 2, which implies that if we let t 0 = 0, the ultimate bound of the solutions of system (4) is time-varying when time t is less than 2, otherwise, it is a constant. This time point is the best one that the governments control the infectious rate of viruses. It is shown from Fig. 5 that in the initial time, when 0 < t < 1, as time t goes on, the individuals in incubation time, E(t), increases rapidly. After E(t) goes to the apex of the curve, it decreases rapidly and trends to zero as time t goes on. On the point of the apex, the individuals E(t) in incubation period increases with the increase of the parameter a. From Fig. 5 we can also conclude that it is the inflection of the curve when time t is about 2 years. E(t) decreases slowly and trends to stability when time t is greater than 2 while E(t) decreases as parameter a increases. We can conclude that the number of infected individuals is related with the value of a, the index of the infectious rate function. In the following, we shall verify the correction and effectivity of the stability conditions in Theorem 5 and its corollaries. We let s (t) = 1 + 1/2sin (t), a = 0.045, Z = 3⁄10 À3 and F = diag{ZN, ZN, ZN, ZN, ZN}. Other parameters are the same as the verification for Theorem 2. We obtain that inf t2Rþ f1 À _ sðtÞg P 1=2. Furthermore, it is not difficult to see that the assumptions (S1) and (S2) are satisfied. We choose _ : Hence, we can see that there exists a constant -> 0 such that k min (D(t)) P -, for all t 2 R + . This shows that from Corollary 2, system (21) is globally exponentially stable, as shown in Fig. 6 , which implies that the treatment or rational immunization for the susceptible or infective individuals may hasten the disease dying out.
