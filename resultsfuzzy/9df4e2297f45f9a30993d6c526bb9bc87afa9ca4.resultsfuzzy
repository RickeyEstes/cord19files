We also use 10-fold and 20-fold cross-validation to estimate the prediction accuracy and the results are given in Fig. S4 in supplementary material. The 10-fold and 20-fold cross-validation results also support that alignment based method and the Manhattan distance based method have highly similar performance. Comparing Fig. 4 with Fig. S4 , we can see that the prediction accuracies increase with "N" for N-fold cross-validation, which is reasonable since the proportion for the training dataset increases with "N". Results based on the coronavirus dataset. Similar to the rabies virus dataset, we first visually check the pairwise distance matrix using MDS and hierarchical clustering. Figure 5 shows the MDS plots of the 707 coronaviruses with spike gene sequences based on alignment-free and alignment distances. Figures 6 and 7 show the hierarchical clustering of the viruses using alignment-based distance and the Manhattan distance with k-mer length of 6, respectively. Figure 8 shows the LOOCV prediction accuracies of the coronavirus dataset using alignment-based distance and Manhattan distance, and SVM for different sample sizes. The prediction accuracies for all the methods are greater than 0.90 when the sample size is above 400. When the sample size is <400, the prediction accuracy of SVM is somewhat higher than the KNN methods. Similar results are observed based on 10-fold and 20-fold cross-validations as shown in Fig. S5 in supplementary material. Results based on the influenza A dataset. Parallel to the investigations for the rabies virus and the coronavirus, Fig. 9 shows the MDS plots for the 1,200 influenza A viruses with N gene sequences based on Manhattan distance using 6-mers and alignment method. Figures S6 and S7 show the corresponding hierarchical clustering results. The MDS and hierarchical clustering plots do not show a clear clustering pattern according to the hosts. A potential explanation is that the sources of the influenza A virus data are much more diverse and consist of several different virus clades. Figure 10 shows the LOOCV prediction accuracies of the influenza A virus dataset using alignment-based distance, Manhattan distance using 6-mers, and SVM for different sample sizes. The prediction accuracies for alignment and alignment-free method are similar, and are higher than that of SVM method for this dataset. Similar results are obtained based on 10-fold and 20-fold cross-validations as shown in Fig. S8 in supplementary material.
