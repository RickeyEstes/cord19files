Importantly, co-transplantation of human foetal thymus/liver tissues and CD34 + HSCs led to the efficient establishment of human haematopoiesis and functional immune systems in NOD/SCID mice, which showed repopulation with multilineage of human haematopoietic cells, including T cells, B cells and DCs in secondary lymphoid tissues [13] . These mice produced high levels of human IgM and IgG antibodies and mediated strong immune responses in vivo as demonstrated by skin xenograft rejection [13] . These humanized mice provided a more powerful model to study human immune function in vivo. 


Section:simultaneous transplantation of foetal human thymus, liver haematopoietic cells and lymph nodes resulted in the improved differentiation of mature human t and b cells, which were tolerant to recipient mouse antigens [1]. implantation of human foetal thymus together with foetal bone chips under the scid mouse kidney capsule supported the proliferation and differentiation of human hscs into mature myeloid and lymphoid cells including human t cells, b cells and macrophages
