We used likelihood ratio tests based on the branch and branch-site models implemented in the codeml program of PAML 17 to examine the possible Darwinian selection of all 11 genes annotated in the 2019-nCoV genome (NC_045512). Positively selected genes (PSGs) were found by the branch-site model ( Table 1) , independent of the initial value variation of parameters (kappa and Ï‰). Specifically, for the branches leading to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, no PSGs were found, nor were PSGs found along the branches leading to their sister coronaviruses. However, we detected PSGs along the ancestral branch (branch C) of 2019-nCoV and its sister taxon, RaTG13, as well as along the ancestral branch (branch K) of SARS-CoV and its sister taxa, WIV16 and Rs4231 (Table 1 , Fig. 1 ). For branch C, three PSGs (S, Orf1ab and N) were found, and for branch K, only one gene (S) was found to be under positive selection (Table 1) . Orf1ab encodes replicase and N encodes nucleocapsid 18 . Intriguingly, the S gene was subject to Darwinian selection in both branches, C and K. This gene encodes the spike protein, which mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion 6 . The finding of Darwinian selection on the spike protein may suggest its adaptive evolution to the host receptors. To further examine the possible adaptive evolution of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV to a human host, we used RELAX 19 to analyze the relative selection intensity change of the 11 genes along the branches leading to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV compared with their most recent ancestors, branches C and K, respectively (Tables S1-2). Among the 11 genes examined, gene S along the 2019-nCoV branch exhibited a significant selection intensification signal (K = 30.54, p = 0.000, Table S1, Fig. S1 ), and this remained robust in four independent runs. We also found that the ORF6 gene showed slight selection intensification (K = 1.81, p = 0.000) along the SARS-CoV branch (Table  S2) , while its statistical significance only received two supports among five independent runs. For the selectively intensified gene S along the 2019-nCoV branch, 0.46% of the amino acid sites (about five amino acids) were under positive selection, while most sites (86.63%) were under purification selection (Table S1 ). This may suggest that 2019-nCoV was subject to an adaptive evolution during its adaption to possible intermediate and/or human hosts. Given the positive selection of the S gene in both branches, C and K, we further examined its positive selection signals using branch-site model along all other main branches ( Fig. 1) to test whether the positive selection uniquely occurred along the branches related to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Our results showed positive selection signals along 10 out of 45 branches examined (Fig. 1, Table S3 ). This may suggest that the S gene was widely subject to Darwinian selection in different coronavirus strains, indicating that it may be crucial for the successful survival of coronaviruses. Further analyses of positive selection sites showed that most positive selection sites among all 12 branches under positive selection were located within subunit 1 of S gene ( Table 1, Table S3 ), which is used for receptor binding. This may suggest that there are strong selection pressures of different coronavirus strains for their own receptor binding. Given the selection intensification of S gene in 2019-nCoV since its evolutionary divergence from RaTG13, we conducted comparative sequence analyses between the two. We found that there were more than 20 amino acid differences between them, and most of them were located within RBD, especially RBM (Fig. S2) , suggesting a high variability of RBM. Given the importance of RBM for receptor binding, we further conducted a comparative sequence analysis among all the coronavirus strains studied to examine its variability. The results showed high sequence variability, with insertion and/or deletion and amino acid substitutions among the coronavirus strains studied (Fig. 2) . Despite the high variability of RBM, strikingly, we found that SARS-CoV and its phylogenetic relatives-including WIV16 (KT444582), Rs4231 (KY417146), Rs7327 (KY417151), Rs9401 (KY417152), and BtRs-BetaCoV/YN2018B (MK211376), called SARS-related CoV here, shared many identical or nearly identical amino acids with their phylogenetically distant coronavirus strains, including 2019-nCoV and RaTG13, which we called COVID-19-related CoV (Fig. 2) . These shared amino acids were clearly distinct from bat SARS-like CoV that were phylogenetic intermediates between them (Fig. 2) . Further analyses showed that such identical amino acids shared between SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV were not restricted to RBM, but rather, they were scattered throughout the spike protein, with a total of 32 such sites, which were centered on RBD (28 sites in total, Fig. S3 ). To further examine whether such similarity occurred in other proteins, we analyzed all 11 genes studied among these coronaviruses, and we found that one additional gene, ORF3a, contained eight such sites (Fig. 1) . The existence of these shared amino acids between SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV may suggest their high sequence similarity. In support of this, we reconstructed maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining phylogenies using full-length RBD protein sequences, and both showed that SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV were grouped in the same clade, with relatively high support, which is consistent with two previous studies 6,7 , at the same time, their phylogenetic intermediates were clustered in distinct clades (Fig. 3,  Fig. S4 ). The phylogenetic uniting of SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV provide evidence of their high similarity of RBD protein sequences. Given their genome-level phylogenetic disparity, the high similarity of RBD protein sequences between SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV may suggest their evolutionary convergence in the spike protein. To test this possibility, we used an empirical Bayes approach in PAML 17 to reconstruct ancestral . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

It should be noted that the 35 evolutionary convergent sites of spike protein were apparently underestimated, since those amino acid sites with alignment gaps were not considered by the approach used. Still, these 35 sites represented an unusually high incidence of evolutionary convergence sites, which have rarely been found in previous studies related to molecular convergent evolution 20-26 . This suggests a strong evolutionary convergence between SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV. On completion of our data analyses, one of the most recent studies showed that the RBD of the spike protein of Pangolin-CoV is nearly identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with only one amino acid difference 27 , suggesting that Pangolin-CoV also belongs to the clade of COVID-19-related CoV. It should be noted that the RBD sequences of two other coronavirus strains, BM48-31 (GU190215) and BtKY72 (KY352407), were grouped with SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV (Fig. 3, Fig. S4 ), suggesting an evolutionary convergence among them. In addition to these evolutionarily convergent coronavirus strains, intriguingly, we found the evidence of evolutionary convergence of the spike protein between the ancestral branch leading to SARS-related CoV and the ancestral branch of COVID-19-related CoV and its sister strains (CoVZC45 and CoVZXC21), which harbored 9 evolutionary convergent amino acid sites (Fig. S5) . These results suggest that the spike protein may have been subjected to a successive evolutionary convergence among ancestral coronavirus strains leading to SARS-related CoV, COVID-19related CoV and CoVZC45 and CoVZXC21. Previous studies show that spike protein interacts tightly with a related protein ORF3a and they likely coevolved [28] [29] [30] . If their coevolution does occur, we may expect that the evolutionary convergence of the spike protein found may have led to the occurrence of the evolutionary convergence of ORF3a as well. To test this, we reconstructed ancestral amino acid sequences of ORF3a along internal nodes, and our results revealed 6 parallel amino acid substitutions shared between the ancestral branch leading to SARS-related CoV and the ancestral branch of COVID-19-related CoV and its sister strains (CoVZC45 and CoVZXC21) (Fig. S5 ). And we also detected a parallel amino acid substitution of ORF3a between the two ancestral branches leading to SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV (Fig. S6 ). Considering that these evolutionary convergent branches of ORF3a also showed evolutionary convergence in spike protein as mentioned above (Fig. 1, Fig. S5 ), it may suggest that spike protein and its partner protein ORF3a may have been subjected to a co-evolutionary convergence. Evolutionary convergence may occur by chance or by Darwinian selection. Our results showed that the evolutionary convergent sites found in this study were mainly restricted to two genes (S and ORF3a, Fig.  1 ), and in particular, they were centered within the RBD of the S gene. This biased distribution of evolutionary convergent sites is difficult to explain according to chance; rather, Darwinian selection would be favored as a plausible explanation. In support of this, we used CONVERG2 31 to evaluate the probability of the occurrence of our observed convergent sites of spike protein between the two ancestral branches leading to SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV, and the results showed high statistical significance (p = 0.000000), regardless of whether the JTT model or Poisson model was used. This result apparently rejects chance or neutral evolution as a possible explanation; rather, it indicates a . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Moreover, we observed an apparently accelerated evolution of RBD of SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV related to their phylogenetic intermediates (Fig.  3) , and we detected a significant Darwinian selection of the S gene along two branches (branches C and K) of SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV (Fig. 1 , Table 1 ). These lines of evidence may strongly support the evolutionary convergence found in this study as a result of adaptive evolution. Regarding the possible adaptive evolutionary convergence, previously proposed causes, such as gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer 21,32,33 , are less likely because only single-copy S genes were found in all 35 genomes examined and evolutionary convergent sites presented an apparently biased distribution pattern. Parallel and/convergent evolution, which occur through point mutation, could contribute to our observed evolutionary convergence, but it could not account for the unusually high incidence of convergent sites observed in this study, representing a rare finding in previous studies 20- 26 . Recent studies have shown a relatively high likelihood of occurrence of homologous recombination in spike protein 7,34,35 , and especially, it is considered that the RBD of 2019-nCov may be derived from a recombination event between that of human SARS-CoV and another (unsampled) SARS-like CoV 35 . If this is the case, the homologous recombination, if any, may have occurred between the ancestors (branches C and K) of SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV, accounting for their unusually high incidence of convergent sites observed in this study. Given the strong evolutionary convergence of RBD of spike protein between the two clades, COVID-19related CoV and SARS-related CoV, the coronaviruses of the two clades may have more likely adapted to similar or the same receptor. To date, 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV have been known to be capable of using the ACE2 receptor in human host 5,6,9,10 , but the receptors of their phylogenetic relatives from the two clades, COVID-19-related CoV and SARS-related CoV, are less clear 4,5,36,37 . Regarding the bat SARSlike CoV, Rs4231 and Rs7327 are known to be able to use human ACE2 receptor 37 , while WIV16 is capable of using the ACE2 receptor from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) 4 . The receptors of Rs9401, BtRs-BetaCoV/YN2018B, and BatCoV RaTG13 remain to be explored. Further studies on the receptors of these bat SARS-like CoVs in their natural reservoirs are badly needed to determine whether ACE2 or other candidates, if any, represent their shared cell receptor, leading to their strong evolutionary convergence of spike protein. Our molecular phyloecological study demonstrates that spike protein shows significant Darwinian selection along two ancestral branches related to SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV, suggesting their adaptive evolution to recognizing their own cell receptors. Comparative sequence and phylogenetic analyses indicate a high similarity of RBD sequences of spike protein between SARS-related CoV and COVID-19related CoV. Subsequent ancestral sequence reconstruction and convergent evolution analyses reveal an unusually high incidence of parallel and convergent amino acid substitutions between them, suggesting an extremely strong adaptive evolutionary convergence in spike protein. In addition to spike protein, we also found evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, ORF3a, suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence. Finally, considering that SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV have posed serious concerns to public health and safety, it should be noted that many other bat SARS-like CoV strains that were evolutionarily convergent with SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV recognized in this study may be potential novel coronaviruses to infect humans in the future.
