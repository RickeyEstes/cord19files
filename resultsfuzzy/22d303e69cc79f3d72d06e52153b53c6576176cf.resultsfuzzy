The terpolymers were synthesized by dispersion copolymerization of St, AN, and PEGm (number-average molecular weight M n Z1740) in the presence of AIBN (radical initiator) in a water/ethanol mixed solvent with various compositions at 60 8C for 24 h (Scheme 1 and Table 1 ). The reaction solution was transparent in the early stages but became cloudy with the progress of polymerization in the water composition range 10-50 vol%. On the other hand, the reaction solution was cloudy before polymerization in a water composition range of more than 60% presumably due to the poor solvent affinity of the St monomer and AN monomer. Fig. 1 shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the nanoparticles. When the water composition was 0 and 10 vol%, nanoparticles with projection coronas were not formed (not shown). As shown in Fig. 1(a) , nanoparticles prepared in the solvent with a water composition of 20 vol% had projection coronas similar to a coronavirus in morphology. In solvent compositions of 30, 40, and 50 vol%, projection coronas were also confirmed distinctly ( Fig. 1(b)-(d) ). However, this kind of nanoparticle morphology was not formed when polymerization was performed in a water composition of more than 60 vol%. This may be due to a difference in the polymerization system; the dispersion system The polymerization was carried out in the solvent (5 ml) at 60 8C for 24 h. is indispensable for projection formation. When the water composition increased, the particle morphology changed. The effects of water composition on particle morphology are shown in Figs. 2-4. Fig. 2 shows the particle size measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS), which is close to that estimated from the SEM images. The particle size increased with an increase in water composition. The same phenomenon was observed in the nanoparticles composed of St and PEGm [14] . The hydrophobic St formed a larger nanoparticle core under conditions of higher water content. Fig. 3 shows the average volume of a projection (V p ) calculated from Fig. 1 using an image data processing tool (Win ROOF) based on the assumption of a hemispherical projection; the average number of projections (n) on a particle was also counted. When the water composition was 20 vol%, V p was 7.2!10 4 nm 3 which was about 3% of the particle volume, V. Increasing the water composition decreases V p and increases V, and V p became about 0.1% of V. When the water composition was 20 vol%, n was 26 which increased up to 65 with an increase in water composition. Fig. 4 shows the average inter-projection distance (d) and the specific surface area (S) of the nanoparticles. d was measured directly from the SEM images. When the water composition was 20 vol%, d was 95 nm; d decreased down to 45 nm with an increase in the water composition. Figs. 3 and 4 show that a larger number of smaller projections appeared on the nanoparticle surface with a higher water composition. When the water composition was 20 vol%, S was 1.73!10 K2 nm 2 /nm 3 which increased to 2.18!10 K2 nm 2 /nm 3 with an increase in water composition. Consequently, S was controlled by a change in solvent composition and S then was about two times larger than that of nanospheres of equal size. Validity of all the calculated values were confirmed by recalculation using transmission electron microscopic images (not shown). Since the projection morphology may be related to the solvent affinity of the particle surface, i.e. PEG chains, we investigated the solvent affinity of PEG in terms of reduced viscosity behavior. Fig. 5 shows changes in the reduced viscosity as a function of the water composition. PEG with a molecular weight of 10,000 was used as a sample because a polymer chain with a larger molecular weight shows a larger change in reduced viscosity by a conformation change. The reduced viscosity increased with increasing water composition showing that the PEG chain took an extended conformation because of increased solvent affinity when the water composition increased. This finding suggests that PEGm graft chains existing on the nanoparticle surface take an extended conformation in a high water composition environment. Elemental analysis on the surface of the nanoparticles was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). We show O/C and N/C on the surface of the particles prepared under different water compositions together with the bulk composition of AN units to the total units in Fig. 6 . The O/C ratio slightly decreased with an increase in water composition while the N/C ratio increased. This result shows that the amount of AN increased on the particle surface as the water composition increased in spite of a decrease in the bulk composition from 57.6 to 47.3 unit mol%. This phenomenon indicated the excess surface accumulation of AN units, which may be associated with the fact that PAN has some solubility in water/ethanol solvent [15] . Since the number of projections also increased, we can support the previously-proposed hypothesis that the projection was mainly comprised of AN [13] . The slight decrease in O/C may result from a decrease in the relative amount of PEG to AN units. We previously hypothesized that the projection formed on the particle surface was caused by the crystal growth of AN. Using the present samples with various morphologies, we attempted to investigate the relationship between the nanoparticles crystallinity and the projection size. The main peak of the crystal of PAN is detected in 2qZ17.18 (200) according to the literature [16] . Fig. 7(a) shows XRD patterns of the nanoparticles showing a sharp peak at 2qZ17.18 (q, diffraction angle) and large amorphous peak at around 238. Crystallization degree of AN units to total nanoparticles were shown as a function of the projection volume in Fig. 7(b) . The crystallinity of nanoparticle linearly increased with an increase in projection volume. As a consequence, the projection on the particle surface can be formed by the crystal growth of AN units. Based on these results, we discussed the reason for the change in the arrangement of projection coronas on the nanoparticles. We previously proposed a hierarchical structure for the nanoparticles with projection coronas: PEG grafts exist on an AN-rich shell covering the St-rich core [13] . Since the nanoparticle created from St and PEGm formed no projections, AN is indispensable in the formation of projection coronas [13] . Since PAN has some solubility in water/ethanol solvent [15] , PAN chains having PEGm grafts may be capable of solvating. The shell in PAN and PEGm may be swollen in solvent with connecting to a PSt core. According to a previous study, the morphology was spherical at the beginning of polymerization, and the projection grew with polymerization time but the number of projections was constant regardless of polymerization time [13] . Namely, the number of projections is determined at the early stages of projection formation where PEGm chains first stick out from the shell dragging out PAN units with them. In this case, the solvent affinity of a PEGm may be an important factor for projection formation. If the water composition is higher, a larger number of AN units exist on the particle surface (Fig. 6) in the presence of bettersolvated PEGm chain yielding a larger number of projection nuclei. The solvation can give a chain mobility to make a crystallization of AN units and the projection is formed. If the AN composition is high, the crystal growth happens in a lot of parts because a number of crystal nuclei were formed on the particle surface. The higher projection population might make its size (Fig. 8) . Thus, solvent affinity is a crucial factor in controlling particle morphology. Finally, we investigated the relationship between the nanoparticle morphology and the water-dispersibility. Although the phenomenon that the smaller nanoparticles have the higher water-dispersibility was widely-confirmed, the effects of their morphology were never investigated as far as we know. We performed a simple test of the waterdispersibility of the present nanoparticles; after the waterdispersion solutions of the nanoparticles (1 mg/ml) whose morphologies are shown in Fig. 1 (a)-(d) were centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 1 min at 20 8C, their opaqueness was observed. Fig. 9 shows the representative photograph of the dispersions (the morphology of right side and left side was shown in Fig. 1(a) and (d), respectively) after the centrifugation. While the nanoparticles with the smallest particle size and the largest projections whose morphology is shown in Fig. 1(a) was precipitated, the nanoparticles with the largest particle size and the smallest projections ( Fig. 1(d) ) kept the water-dispersibility well. The water-dispersibility increased with increasing the particle size, contrarily to the widely-confirmed phenomenon in this size range of 50 nm-10 mm. In the present case, the projection morphology may affect the water-dispersibility more effectively rather than the particle size. The increase in the number of the projection with the reduced size increased S, which should strongly enhance the water-dispersibility of the nanoparticles.
