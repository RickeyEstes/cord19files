The search terms yielded 101 publications; 14 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study (Tables 1 and 2). The  articles were separated based on publication dates, with the natural break point being the 2013 to 2016 EVD epidemic. Thoms  et al 2 discussed drawing on the operational experience from Phoenix Air Corporation, a private organization that began AE HLCTs in 2007 when it developed the Aeromedical Biological Containment System. The US Department of State, United Nations, and other governments used that single-patient transport system for AE HLCTs of patients with EVD in 2013 to 2016. 15 Although Phoenix Air Corporation's AE HLCT experience is widely known, details of their procedures and policies were not published in peer-reviewed literature and were not available. Planning for and executing AE HLCTs must account for multiple variables; our review is organized around "preflight, in-flight, and postflight" environments.
