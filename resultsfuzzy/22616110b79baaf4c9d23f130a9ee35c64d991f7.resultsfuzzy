The isolate, despite the high-level resistance to oxacillin (MIC: 256 mg/L), did not carry the mecA gene, while no overproduction of penicillinase or mutation of PBP4 were detected. However some mutations were found in PBP1: an alteration in the 482 position (L482P) and an insertion in 570 position of four aminoacids (SAYG). These mutations were not found in the susceptible strain. As b-lactams bind to the penicillin-binding motif KTG in the transpeptidase region, that is located in 582 position, alterations in or around the motif possibly confer resistance due to reduced affinity to b-lactams. Conclusions: This is the first report for mutations in PBP1 resulting in high-level methicillin-resistance in a clinical S. lugdunensis isolate. The results were very similar for two examined strains. Most of the tested compounds were active against both. H. pylori strains at the concentration of 10 mg/ml (stock solution). Two substances exhibited more than 40 mm wide grown inhibition zone, 1 − 39 mm, 2 − from 29 to 30 mm, 7 − from 12 to 20,5 mm. 2 of the presented substances were classified as nonactive. MIC of the xanthones ranged from 10 mg/ml to 50 mgml. Most potent activity with MIC value of 50 mgml was characteristic for 3 compounds. Conclusion: Performed research on anti-H. pylori activity of the series of xanthone derivatives, it could be stated that: chlorine atom as well as allyl moiety are favorable, substitution in the xanthone structure in position 2 is more favorable than in position 3 and 4 and carbonyl group in a side chain is responsible for the partial loss of activity. Further studies will be necessary to investigate the effect of these active compounds. The MRSA dilution of 0.5:106 had very few colonies in culture up to 6 hours but the pellet of 1.5 ml of the broth after 2, 4, and 6 hours incubation there was an increase of 1.7, 3.6 and 4.8 in CT. There was no interference, inhibition or cross-reaction with MSSA in the XMSN assay. Of all the urine samples tested, 51,990 (18.0%) were positive. Of these, (1,240; 2.4%) some MDR microorganism was isolated, 1,102 (88.8%) were extended-spectrum b-lactamase-producing Enterobacteria (ESBL), 84 (6.8%) were meticilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 28 (2.2%) were MRPA and 26 (2.2%) were MRA. Within the ESBL-producing Enterobacteria we found 996 (90.3%) Escherichia coli, 90 (8.1%) Klebsiella spp. and 12 (1.0%) Proteus spp. Multidrug-resistant isolates increased from 3 in 2000 to 274 in 2009 in both inpatients and the community. Of the 1,240 total patients, 1,188 (95.8%) were adults and 52 (4.2%) were children; 62.4% were women. The antimicrobial resistance rates of ESBL-producing enterobacteria were: nalidixic acid 77.6%, ciprofloxacin 64.8%, cotrimoxazole 60.0%, gentamicin 22.0%, nitrofurantoin 7.8%, fosfomycin 4.2% and amocillinclavulanate 27.6%. No carbapenem resistant strains were found. Conclusions: We observed an increase in the incidence of UTIs through multiresistant pathogens during the study period, both in inpatients and in patients with infections acquired in the community. Among inpatients, the highest incidence corresponded to the Internal Medicine and Geriatric Departments. ESBL-producing Enterobacteria were the most frequently isolated multiresistant organisms. Carbapenems and aminoglycosides could be the best choice for empiric treatement in hospitalized patients. Quinolones and cotrimoxazole should not be recommended due to the high resistance rates observed. R2408 High-throughput DNA sequencing of resistance plasmids: a powerful approach to identify resistance and virulence features L. Villa*, C. Carta, A. García-Fernández, D. Fortini, A. Carattoli (Rome, IT) Introduction: High-throughput DNA sequencing of resistance plasmids allows a very quick determination of plasmid content. By this novel approach it is possible to identify the major characteristics of resistance and virulence and to trace the evolution of specific plasmid families, recognizing their basis for virulence, host range, transferability and stability. We sequenced plasmids identified in Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) of nosocomial origin that were i) untypable by PCR-Based Replicon Typing (PBRT); ii) relevant being characteristic of epidemic clones. Materials and Methods: A procedure was devised to simultaneously pyrosequence multiple plasmids by the 454 GS-FLX Titanium, using MID-TAG barcoded primers in large volume emPCR (Roche, Italy). Mobile DNA elements associated with resistance genes, regions implicated in replication and plasmid host ranges, maintenance (toxinantitoxin, plasmid partitioning and exclusion properties) and transfer were annotated. i. The majority of the plasmids carrying blaSHV-12 gene are classified as untypable being negative to the most common replicons of Enterobacteriaceae. One of these plasmids belonged to the novel IncR plasmid family. This plasmid family was characterized by a novel replicase gene that we previously identified in a Salmonella Montevideo from The Netherlands associated to the qnrS1 gene (García-Fernández et al. 2009 ). The novel fully sequenced IncR-SHV-12 plasmid confers resistance to b-lactams and cephalosporines (blaSHV-12, blaTEM-1, blaOXA9), but also to mercuric ions, aminoglycosides (strA-strB, aacA4, aadA1) and sulphonamides and is negative for the conjugative transfer locus, suggesting in trans mobilization mediated by co-resident plasmids. ii. The entire plasmid content of two KP ST258 strains (one multidrug resistant and one susceptible) was determined. The resistant strain was positive for the carbapenemase KPC-3 located on plasmid pKpQIL, previously identified in ST258 from Israel (NC_014016). The susceptible ST258 contained virulence-like plasmids of the FIIK type that likely contributed to the successful spread of this clone, independently by the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance genes. The 22 investigated isolates showed a MDR phenotype being susceptible only to colistin, gentamicin and tigecycline. Results of genotyping techniques were all concordant and showed that all but one isolates were clonally related and belonged to ST 258. All isolates were confirmed to be blaKPC-2 positive by sequencing. In addition the investigated strains were positive for blaCTX-M-15 and all but one to blaSHV-12 ESBLs. 36 additional isolates showing the same phenotypic pattern were presumed to be related to the epidemic cluster. Conclusion: Before November 2009 at the San Gerardo Hospital no KPC-KP strains has been isolated. During the studied period, 22 clonally related KPC-KP were obtained. Isolates belonged to ST 258 as the first described Italian KPC-KP. This clone is the major responsible of worldwide spreading of these resistance determinants. Molecular analysis demonstrated the presence in all isolates of blaKPC-2, and blaCTX-M-15 and in all but one of blaSHV-12 b-lactamase. The only KPC-KP isolate not clonally related to the outbreak clone, was positive for blaSHV-1 determinant and was obtained from a patient transferred from another Hospital. This different clone represent an exception in the Italian epidemiological scenario where all described KPC-KP belonged to ST258. The rep-PCR approach here described appear to be a rapid and robust technique to investigate clonal relationship of KPC-KP. The biggest success in treatment (75% cured) was noticed in patients after combination of gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and doxycycline, then combination of gentamicin and ciprofloxacin (71%), then monotherapy of gentamicin (68%) and combination of gentamicin and doxycycline (67% cured). In comparison to number of treated patients, the biggest success in treatment (71%) had the combination of gentamicin and ciprofloxacin, then monotherapy of gentamicin (68%). Outcome of medicamentosus treatment: 92 patients (61%) of 151 were totally cured. The complications happened in 59 patients (39%): 1. abscessing of lymph nodes with or without fistulisation at 36 patients (23.8), 2. relapse − 12 patients (8%), 3. both complications at 11 patients (7.2%) (graphic 1). The relapses included recidivante lymph node enlargement or intake more than one lymph nodes. Final outome after conservative and radical treatment was total curing of 143 patients (94.7%) and residual persistant lymphadenopathy at 8 patients (5.3%). Conclusion: Reasons for appearance of complications during therapy of tularemic patients: 1. inadequate initial antibiotic treatment 2. late onset of adequate antibiotic therapy 3. possible appearence of resistant species of F. tularensis in the region of South-eastern Serbia. Early, forehand treatment restrains the colliquation of lymph nodes, recurrence of disease and dissemination of infection. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for prevention of complication and complete curing. The confirmation of CMV infection by the two methods was obtained in 14 patients. One hundred four patients were positive for CMV-IgM and negative for CMV-DNA. Antibodies for HSV, VZV or EBV were also detected in some of them. By performing PCR, 20 extra cases of active infection were diagnosed, for which no antibodies could be detected. This translates to a 15% rise in the number of diagnoses of active CMV infection as compared with serological approach. The CMV-DNA positive patients were 6 children and 28 adults. The major underlying disease was haematological malignancies (14/34). Pneumonitis was the most common clinical presentation (20/34). Overall, the median viral load was 2255 copies/ml (472-58700), while in them with CMV mononucleosis was 583 copies/ml (472-874). The overall mortality rate was 12% and major cause was respiratory failure. Eighteen of the 34 PCR positive patients received ganciclovir. Treatment led to a marked decrease in CMV DNA copy number. The median time interval necessary to obtain a negative result after implementation of treatment by PCR was 27 days. Conclusion: Quantative PCR CMV assay is rapid, and linear for quantifying CMV viral load, and it seems to be useful in the diagnosis and management of affected patients for predicting disease and monitoring response to antiviral therapy and can serve as surrogate markers for antiviral resistance and clinical relapse in these patients. Compared with traditional serologic assays that detect antibodies to CMV, Q-PCR offers a significant advance through the direct detection of viral DNA, which is independent of a functioning humoral immune system. Amplified DNA Assays were designed to be compatible with transport via the Swab Diluent for the BD ProbeTec CT/GC Q x Amplified DNA Assays (Q x Swab Diluent) and BD UVT or Copan UTM-RT collection devices. This study focused on evaluating performance of the HSV assays using simulated specimen comprising 0.5mL BD UVT medium added to a pre-filled Q x Swab Diluent Tube. Samples were pre-warmed, and then loaded directly onto the BD Viper System for DNA extraction and amplification. The analytical limits of detection (95% proportion positive) for the HSV1 Q x and HSV2 Q x assays using clean BD UVT medium were estimated to be 24 viral particles (vp)/mL and 88 vp/mL, respectively. The limits of detection for the assays in the presence of external anogenital swab specimen matrix were estimated to be 17 vp/mL and 127 vp/mL for HSV1 Q x and HSV2 Q x , respectively. Both assays were shown to be tolerant to common exogenous and endogenous substances that may be present in external anogenital lesion specimens, including but not limited to blood, mucus, semen, leukocytes and various prescription and over-the-counter medications. In addition, both assays were found not to cross-react with a variety of bacteria, viruses and fungi that could be found in external anogenital lesion specimens. Stability of HSV DNA in simulated external anogenital swab specimens was demonstrated at ambient, refrigerated and frozen temperatures in both the original UVT specimen and once diluted in the Q x Swab Diluent. The organic solvent extraction protocol showed good reproducibility on the amount of DNA extracted, pure DNA and high PCR sensitivity (10 pg of C. albicans DNA and 90% amplification on PCR assay). Therefore, this method was used to analyze all clinical samples available. The molecular species identification showed 100% concordance to the conventional culture. However, the molecular method could identify one sample with mixed infection caused by C. albicans and C. glabrata, while the conventional culture identified just C. albicans. Moreover, 3 samples identified as C. parapsilosis by the classical method were molecularly identified as C. orthopsilosis, a species belonging to the C. parapsilosis complex. Conclusions: Organic DNA extraction, PCR assay and sequencing could efficiently identify mixed infections, as well as Candida species that only can be molecularly identified. This test can be easily implemented in routine laboratories providing earlier and low cost species identification when compared to the traditional methods. The organic DNA extraction was 4-fold less expensive than protocols using commercial kits. Objectives: Clostridium difficile infections represent significant burden for health care system with small and large outbreaks constantly being present in hospital environment. Some of the PCR ribotypes were lately associated with outbreaks and with increased mortality and morbidity: 027, 078, 017 and 053. It is therefore important to recognize these ribotypes as rapid as possible. Standard typing method in Europe is culturing of C. difficile from faecal sample and subsequent PCR ribotyping. Here we describe for the first time the modification of PCR ribotyping that can be used for direct detection in stool samples and its use during emergence of PCR ribotype 027 in a single hospital. Methods: For direct PCR ribotyping from stool sample we have modified existing primers described by Bidet et al. (1999) to increase specificity for C. difficile. A total of 50 C. difficile culture positive and 43 negative stool samples from the routine laboratory were then used for validation of the method. DNA was isolated from faecal sample and PCR ribotyping was performed with Bidet and with new primers. Additionally, five stool samples from general hospital, which were detected as "C. difficile positive, presumptive 027/NAP1" by Cepheid Xpert C. difficile assay were submitted to the reference laboratory for ribotype 027 confirmations. Results: Direct PCR ribtyping from stool samples was possible in 37 out of 50 C. difficile positive samples using new primers. Other 13 samples were negative (n = 9) or the banding pattern was too weak to be analyzed (n = 4). In 36 out of 37 cases PCR ribotype determined directly from the stool was identical as PCR ribotype of the strain isolated from the same stool sample (sensitivity 0.72−36 out of 50 positive samples). All, but one C. difficile culture negative samples were negative on direct PCR ribotyping with modified primers. In contrast, 30 out of 43 C. difficile negative samples reacted with Bidet primers. All five Cepheid Xpert "C. difficile positive presumptive 027/NAP1" samples were confirmed as ribotype 027 by direct ribotyping as well as conventional ribotyping of the cultured isolate. The MICs for Imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime and cefepime were 0.5, 0.5, 8 and 4mg/L respectively for both strains. Both the strains were positive for blaoxa-51-like and blaADC but negative for blaoxa-23/40/58 and metallo-b-lactamases. Strain A produced a brown pigment in presence of gluconic acid. It also grew better than strain B over a period of 48 hours in the presence of IST broth containing gluconic acid concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 4%. Neither strain produced pigment in M9 glucose medium. When gluconic acid is added in excess, it increases the pigment in strain A. The brown pigment produced by strain A did not have any inhibitory effect against S. aureus NCTC6571, Ps. aeruginosa NCTC10662, A. baumannii ATCC19606 and E. coli NCTC10418. The glucose dehydrogenase enables both the strains to form 6-phosphogluonate which is free to enter the Entner-Doudouroff pathway hence there is no pigment production seen in both the strains when M9 glucose broth is used. On the other side human blood being enriched with nutrients including gluconic acid helps strain A to survive better by converting gluconic acid to 2,5 diketogluconate which leads to the formation of brown pigmentation. The quantitative evaluation of the automated streaking of the 1 mL loop showed that plates inoculated by the WASP had 10 times more colonies growing after overnight incubation as compared to the plates inoculated with 50 mL using the calibrated pipet. This was the same for all three ATCC strains and after a correction was made for the cfu/mL of the initial 0.5 McFarland suspension. Although there were numeric differences between colony count of plates inoculated by WASP and manually, no differences in clinical interpretation was observed. Testing of the clinical samples will be continued in the next weeks. On T3, at a cut-off value of 0.7ng/ml, NPV: 91.0% accuracy: 70.6% On T7, at a cut-off value of 3ng/ml, NPV: 97.5%, accuracy: 84.3% Conclusion: We think that PCT is an important marker guiding the clinician in the differential diagnosis of sepsis and prognostication. The outbreak involved 7 persons (6 male). The index isolate was from a 46 year old, previously healthy male, who had a fecal specimen taken under intensive care for haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) on April 13 in Graz. The second isolate was from a 46 year old Tyrolean patient (specimen received on April 28); this patient suffered from discharge of slime and bowel irregularities, following watery diarrhea. The patient attended a book fair in Graz 5 days before onset of illness in Innsbruck. He and two working colleagues consumed appetizers (bred with various handmade spreads) at some of the exhibition booths. The two colleagues fell ill with diarrhea (one in Innsbruck, one in Munich, Germany) but had not stool specimens tested. Another stool isolate (June 10) was from a 66 year old male treated for HUS in Vienna. A fourth isolate was from this latter patient's wife (age 63), who developed bloody diarrhea three days after her husbands discharge from hospital. A fifth stool isolate was from a 92 year old patient with diarrhea from Graz (specimen received May 12). All five isolates were sorbitol-fermenting, positive for stx1, stx2 and hlyA, but negative for eae. Analyses by PFGE using XbaI as restriction enzyme yielded patterns indistinguishable from each other, but clearly different from five other STEC O174:H2 provided by the German National Consulting Laboratory on HUS and 48 disease associated Austrian STEC isolates from 2010. Conclusion: Our report emphasizes that stool samples from patients with HUS must be tested by other techniques than sole use of Sorbitol-MacConkey media. Direct person-to-person transmission underlines the importance of instructing family members about the need for post-defecatory handwashing. For five of the six remaining patients, consumption of an unidentified contaminated handmade spread produced and distributed in the Graz area is the likely source of infection. The adherence ability, siderophores, amylase and caseinase were better expressed at 37ºC. At 0% NaCl only amylase and siderophores, at 2% and 3% NaCl the amylase was better expressed and at 6% NaCl, siderophores and caseinase showed the best expression, thereafter, the VF expression gradually decreasing till 10% NaCl. The adherence to HeLa cells was decreased by higher salinities. The tested strains proved high resistance to a broad range of pH from 5 to 9.6. The amylase and caseinase were better expressed at pH 9.6 and siderophores at pH 7. The higher glucose concentrations (3%) inhibited the expression of amylase and caseinase. The incubation conditions exhibited no influence on the VF expression. The molecular detection of VF genes evidenced the Ecp/dA in 82% and EchelD in 85% of the tested strains. The densitometric analysis of the electrophoretic bands obtained in multiplex PCR showed different intensities, suggesting that, in a number of cases, the lipase or DN-ase genes could be lost in a great percent in the bacterial population. Conclusion: Our results proved the high adaptation ability of aquatic enterobacterial strains to different stress conditions and the expression of virulence determinants even in limiting environmental conditions, demonstrating the role of these parameters in the preservation of the virulence gene pool in water. The dominant theme in all networks was that antibiotic resistance arose from having or developing a 'resistant body', where the barrier to antibiotic effectiveness was individual loss of responsiveness. Less commonly, patients correctly conceptualised antibiotic resistance as a property of bacteria. Nevertheless, the over-use of antibiotics was a strong central concept in almost all patients' explanations, whether they viewed resistance as located in either the body or in bacteria. The molecular approach revealed that 41 (8.6%) E. coli isolates carried at least two of EAEC-associated genes targeted. The most frequently detected genes were aat (40 isolates) and aap (38 isolates). Twenty-nine isolates harboured concurrently aat, aggR, and aap genes. Almost half of these carried also astA gene. Most of the EAEC isolates derived from phylogenetic group A (29 isolates), while the rest belonged to groups B2 (6 isolates), D (4 isolates) and B1 (2 isolates). Twenty-four EAEC isolates expressed resistance, of which five were extended-spectrum b-lactamase producers. All EAEC isolates were fluoroquinolone susceptible. The project has included so far 8 Hospitals and 20 operating rooms (OR). According to the OR ventilation system in place, 76.5% of OR were with unidirectional airflow, 6.0% with turbulent air ventilation, and 17.6% mixed. A total of 289 surgical procedures, 67.0% hip and 33.0% knee arthroprosthesis, were included until December 2010. Mean duration of operations was 93 minutes for hip and 117 minutes for knee arthroprosthesis. IMA values in OR at rest were as follows: range = 0−8, mean±SD = 0.8±2.1, median = 0; during surgical procedures the following values were registered: range = 0-156, mean±SD = 7.2±14.7, median = 3. A total of 99.6% of patients received antibiotic prophylaxis: 30−60 minutes (36.7%), 1−2 hours (18.5%) and >2 hours (44.8%), before incision. The most frequently administered antimicrobial agents were cefazolin (44.7%), tobramycin (29.1%) and teicoplanin (19.6%). We identified 14 studies (2 RCTs, 8 case series and 4 case reports) as eligible for inclusion in this review. In 7 studies, boric acid was compared either with nystatin, or azoles (terconazole, flucytosine, itraconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, buconazole and miconazole), while as monotherapy boric acid was studied in 7 studies. The mycological cure rates varied from 40% to 100% in patients treated with boric acid. Four of the 9 included case series reported statistically significant outcomes regarding cure (both mycological and clinical) rates. None of the included studies reported statistical significant difference in recurrence rates. Regarding the adverse effects caused by boric acid use, vaginal burning sensation (<10% of the cases), water discharge during treatment and vaginal erythema were identified in 7 studies. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that boric acid is a safe, alternative, economic option for women with recurrent and chronic symptoms of vaginitis when conventional treatment fails due to the involvement of non-albicans Candida species or azole-resistant strains. During one year follow up period, 384-hospital-acquired infection episodes were detected in hospitalized patients (n = 11333). The prevalence rates of patients with hospital-acquired infections were 3.4%. The incidence density was 5.2/1000 patient days. The most common hospital-acquired infections by primary site were pneumonia (47.1%), followed by urinary tract infection (19.5%), surgical site infections (16.9%), bacteremia (14.8%), and other infections (1.6%). Hospitalacquired infections were seen frequently in the department of neurology (7.7%), internal medicine (3.3%), neurosurgery (2.9%), general surgery (2.5%), urology (2.4%), orthopedics (1.9%), infectious disease (0.5%), pediatrics (0.5%). Hospital-acquired infection rate in intensive care units was 26.2%. The most prevalent microorganisms were Pseudomonas spp. (33.5%), Escherichia coli (14.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (12.6%), Acinetobacter spp. (9.5%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (8.1%), Enterobacter spp ( Objectives: Greece has been participating in the ARTEMIS global surveillance programme since 1997 through October 2009, in order to study the epidemiology of Candida strains in our hospital and monitor their susceptibility to fluconazole and voriconazole using a low cost, reproducible and accurate standard in vitro test. Methods: Strains isolated from patients with severe Candida infections from all body sites and all hospital locations were collected, identified and analyzed. Susceptibility was investigated with disk diffusion testing according to CLSI M44 method. Test results were read, interpreted and recorded with the Biomic plate reader system. Results: A total of 1461 Candida strains were recorded. Most prominent species was C. albicans (63.6%), with a year-frequency ranging from 52 to 75%, followed by C. glabrata (14.5%, range 6.9-23.5%) and C. parapsilosis (7.2%, range 0.9−9.6%, except for the years 2007 and 2009 in which a 24.1% frequency was observed). All other species together had a frequency of 5−24%. The sensitivity of C. albicans to fluconazole equalled that to voriconazole (92.5% versus 92.6% of strains respectively). For the C. glabrata, the respective percentages were 72.4 and 75 and for the C. parapsilosis 85.7 and 92.8. Most of the resistant strains of all species were isolated from miscellaneous body fluids, the upper respiratory tract and blood and derived from the ICU and the surgical wards. During the years 2006-2009, the C. albicans strains resistant to fluconazole were 13.1% and to voriconazole 14.3%. In the previous years only 5% and 4.4% were resistant, respectively. A comparable increase in resistant strains was noted also for C. glabrata (47.8% versus 33.4% in previous years to fluconazole and 43.9% versus 16.9% to voriconazole) and C. parapsilosis (11.2% versus 6.6% and 4.6% versus 2.3% respectively). The remaining species did not show increasing rates. Conclusions: Of the Candida species isolated in our hospital, the most prominent was C. albicans, followed by C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis. The frequency of isolation of these strains varied from year to year without a clear trend. However, an increase in strains resistant to fluconazole and voriconazole was observed in the last four years. These results confirm the need for monitoring the local epidemiology and antifungal susceptibility of Candida strains in order to optimize the empirical or targeted therapy, especially in critically ill patients. We analyzed 61 immigrants (mean time of travel: 91 days). They travelled to Senegal (33%) Equatorial Guinea (25%), Ecuador (18%), Bolivia (8%), Venezuela (5%), Brazil, Cameroon and Colombia (3% each) and Ethiopia (2%). Only 23% patients received health's advice before travel, 72% of travellers didn't received any vaccine and 78% did not carry out antimalaria chemoprophylaxis. Only 25% used safe water. No one use repellents. Twenty-eight patients (46%) were to be illness to return home. Twenty-six patients had diarrhea during the trip and 20% fever, being the most frequent reasons for consultation. In 32% of cases the diarrhea was due to parasitic infections. Eight patients had malaria, in 6 cases due to P. falciparum and two to P. vivax. Conclusions: VFRs are a group of high risk for imported disease due to poor adherence to vaccination and prophylaxis measures. At present, immigrants visiting friends and relatives (VFRs) constitute the most significant group of travellers for malaria importation in developed countries, with sub-Saharan Africa destinations carrying the highest risk. There is an urgent need to increase health's travel advice in this group of travellers. Statistical data analysis used descriptive and and analytic methods − Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. The value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Within 5 years 44 patients were treated with trihinellosis. Around 2/3 (68.18%) of them were men, average age being 41.18±14.51, mostly from urban region (65.9%). Source of infection was known in 95% of the cases, out of which in 90% the cause was found to be with domestic animals. Duration of the disease before making diagnosis was on the average 11.5±6.55 days, and duration the hospitalisation lasted 16.5±8.1 days. There were no lethal outcomes, the disease have ended well with 39 patients, while 5 patients (11.36%) had a disease complications-two of them hepatitis, one neurotrichinellosis with neurological consequences, while two patients had myocarditis (one of them developed deep venous thrombosis). Comparing groups of patients with or without complications, the statistically significant difference was shown in time between the intake of food and the appearance of symptoms (p = 0,461). Duration of the disease before the diagnostic and treatment had no effect on the frequency of complications (p = 0,643), while there was statistically significant correlation between the duration of the sickness before the diagnosis was made and duration of the hospitalisation (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Although trihinellosis is a rare disease, it still represents a significant medical problem which we need to be reminded about. The two populations (A, n = 33, and B, n = 32) were homogeneous by age (48, A, vs 45.1 years, B, P = 0,13), baseline CD4+ T-cells (292 vs 338/mmc, P = 0,4) HIV-1 RNA log10 copies/mL (4,6 vs 4,8, P = 0,6) , and time on viral suppression (112,6 vs 115,1 weeks, P = 0,77). However, group A was on average in 11th treatment line with a mean GSS = 1,88, while group B was scattered around the 5th line, having a GSS = 2,83, P < 0,001. 21/33 subjects in group A and 16/32 in group B reached NS viremia, p = 0.32. Reaching NS viremia does not seem to be correlated with lower baseline viral load (4,6 in NS vs 2,9 log copies/mL in SS, P = 0,69), nor even with baseline GSS (2,3 vs 2,4, P = 0,81). Also the CD4-T cell nadir (158 vs 149, P = 0,77) and zenith HIV-1 RNA log log10 copies/mL (5,2 vs. 5,6, P = 0,21) were not predictive of NS response. One hundred and thirty two (73.3%) patients were bearing the wild type (WT) haplotype, 43 (24%) were heterozygous (HT) for the SNP, and four (2.2%) were homozygous (HO) for the variant allele. 39 patients carrying the WT haplotype experienced an infection (29.5%) compared to 12 HT patients (27.3%) and one HT patient (25%) (p ns). The individuals with a nadir CD4 count <200 cells/mm 3 who carried the S180L variant demonstrated a 4-fold decrease in the odds ratio (OR) for any serious infection compared with those who carried the wild-type 180S genotype (OR 0.58 vs OR 2.6, p = 0.016). Six patients developed B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas: two among patients bearing WT haplotypes (1.5%); and four among patients bearing the HT haplotype (9.3%, p = 0.040). Conclusions: This study suggests a protection effect of the Mal S180L SNP against serious infections in HIV-1 infected individuals with low CD4 cell counts. The demographic characteristics of the RTr who did or did not receive VGC prophylaxis were similar. Total ATG dose was significantly higher in the prophylaxis group than in the other group. It was determined that, although not significant, the rate of CMV infection development was lower in the patients to whom prophylaxis was administered ( Results: 2 cases of HMPV pneumonia were identified in an Australian haematology unit in spring, 2010. The cases were in separate but adjacent rooms raising the possibility of nosocomial transmission. Lymphopenia was present in both as a complication of chemotherapy for anaplastic large cell lymphoma (case one) and after autologous peripheral stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma (case two). MRSA and HMPV were identified in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Respiratory intubation, ventilation and intensive care management was required for progressive respiratory failure whilst on maximal therapy for MRSA infection. Bilateral ground glass infiltrates progressed to nodular, confluent parenchymal changes. Salvage treatment with ribavirin was started more than a week after symptom onset. Ribavirin 25mg/kg/day (intravenous) was followed by 15mg/kg/day (intravenous) for a total of 7 days in both cases. One patient cleared virus from respiratory tract, but progress was complicated by a cerebrovascular accident. The second patient developed extensive air space consolidation and cavitation. HMPV was detected by PCR at 6 weeks after treatment with ribavirin. Conclusion: HMPV infection is associated with significant morbidity and poor outcomes. Lymphopenia is a risk factor for infection with HMPV in adult patients receiving treatment for hematological malignancy. Co-infection with MRSA occurs. Neutrophil recovery and hypogammaglobulinaemia may contribute to severity of infection. Ribavirin was well tolerated. Late treatment with intravenous ribavirin for seven days did not eradicate viral shedding in one patient, and may have contributed to clinical and virological cure in the other. HMPV may be detected in respiratory secretions for greater than 6 weeks in adult patients with haemopoeitic malignancy, with implications for infection control measures. was an independent risk factor for PBSI, while prior blood transfusion was revealed as protective factor (OR 3, 9; 95% CI, 5) . Empirical inappropriate antimicrobial treatment has been given to 20 patients (59%) with PBSIs, and 7 (21%) with MBSIs (p = 0.003). The infectionrelated mortality was 29% in patients with PBSI and 12% in those with MBSI (p = 0.072). No differences in duration of hospitalization or overall mortality were observed. Conclusion: PBSIs represent a significant percentage of BSIs among patients with malignancy. Although inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment has been given in higher percentage of patients with PBSI than those with MBSIs, no differences in duration of hospitalization or overall mortality have been observed. Recognition of the risk factors for PBSIs and knowledge of their microbiology are important for the selection of appropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment that may result in improved outcome. Results: Sixty-one UTI episodes were diagnosed in 51 patients. Sixtynine percent of the patients were female. The range of the ages were 18−60 years. More than one UTI episodes were seen in 8 patients. The three leading uropathogens were E. coli, Klebsiella spp and enterococci. E. coli was detected in 41 (67%) episodes, Klebsiella spp. was detected in 11 (18%) episodes and enterococci was detected in 5 (8%) episodes. Twenty-one of the E. coli isolates (51%) were ESBL positive. The antimicrobial resistance rates of ESBL negative and ESBL positive E. coli isolates were shown in the Table. The risk factors determined are hospitalization at the time of diagnosis or hospitalization within 1 month, recent (within 1 month) antibiotic use, urinary catheterization. Conclusion: Risk factors for urinary tract infections caused by ESBL producing bacteria among renal transplant recipients are similar with the other patient groups but nearly half of the uropathogen E. coli strains are ESBL positive in renal transplant recipients. This high percentage of resistant pathogens causes difficulties in the management of these patients. Multidrug resistant bacteria are increasingly isolated from transplant recipients and cause high morbidity, mortality. The aim of this study is to determine the disribution and etiologic agents of bacterial infections seen in the early period after liver transplantation. In the pneumococcal pneumonia model, oral intake of b240 led to the prolongation of survival time and significantly inhibited of body weight loss, as well as reduced bronchitis. There were a significant decrease in the secretion level of inflammatory cytokines and toll-like receptor 2 expression was promoted in b240-treated mice. These results were exhibited in accordance with the alleviated pathological severity of pneumonia. Conclusion: These results suggest that Lactobacillus pentosus ON-RICb0240 intake can facilitate protection against S. pneumoniae infection via the modulation of innate immunities. The mice treated with b240 were significantly protected against S.Typhimurium as compared to those fed saline. Moreover, viable numbers of S.Typhimurium in each organ in b240-treated mice tended to be less than in the control mice. In vitro study demonstrated the inhibitory effect of b240 on binding and invasion of S.Typhimurium into cells. In group 1, consisting of healthy S. aureus carriers, mean levels of serum cytokines amounted as follows: IL-1b 0.31±0.3 pg/ml, TNF-a 0.56±0.22 pg/ml, IFN-g 0.21±0.095 pg/ml. In group 2 at the first sampling levels of the cytokines were as follows: IL-1b 0.28±0.16 pg/ml, TNF-a 0.54±0.09 pg/ml, IFN-g 2.37±1.38 pg/ml, and only the level of IFN-g was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than mean level in group 1. In turn, on the second sampling mean level of IFN-g was significantly higher (p = 0.0152) than the level noted upon the first sampling and amounted to 4.41±2.6 pg/ml. Serum levels of IL-1b and TNF-a increased in 10 patients (2.77±2.45 pg/ml, p = 0.0005 and 1.67±0.69 pg/ml, p < 0.0001, respectively) and remained unaltered in the 6 remaining patients. At the same time in 10 patients presence of S. aureus could not be detected in throat smears obtained at the time of the second sampling. Conclusion: The effective immune response against S. aureus seems to depend on levels of circulating cytokines IL-1b and TNF-a, the production of which may be stimulated by S. aureus autovaccine. Background: Some evidence has shown a relationship between human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and pregnancy loss. However, whether recurrent or latent CMV infection or altered immune response to CMV may relate to recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is unclear and few data are available in this regard. We evaluated CMV infection and humoral immunological response to CMV in women with RPL and compared it to women without any history of abortion. The median age of the study population was 65 years (min-max, 33−87); 52% were female. At baseline, the percentages of patients with titers of vaccine strain-specific HI antibodies 1:50 were 100%, 72%, and 100% against H1N1, H3N2 and B, respectively. Immunogenicity results at day 21 show that this vaccine is poorly immunogenic (see Table 1 ). No serious adverse events (AE) have been reported during the first 3 weeks after vaccination. All the reported AE were from mild to moderate intensity.
