The MHV nsp3-TM domain is important for PLP2 processing at cleavage site 3 Analysis of SARS-CoV PLpro activity showed that the nsp3 hydrophobic domain downstream of PLpro is essential for processing at CS3 (Harcourt et al., 2004) . To determine if a similar domain is important for MHV PLP2 activity, we generated a series of PLP2 C-terminal deletion constructs and tested each construct for expression and processing activity. PLP2 expression constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and cloning of the amplified region into pcDNA3.1/V5-His, as described in Materials and methods. To determine if each clone was expressing a protein of the expected size, we analyzed the products after T7-mediated expression and immunoprecipitation (Fuerst et al., 1986; Kanjanahaluethai and Baker, 2000) . We detected the expected series of truncated PLP2 proteins that ranged in size from ∼96 kDa to ∼ 50 kDa (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-6) . To determine if these PLP2 products were sufficient to mediate processing of CS3, we tested each construct in the trans-cleavage assay by co-transfection with the substrate (Fig. 1C, lanes 7-12) . We found that only two of the PLP2 expression products, pPLP2-2485 and pPLP2-2390, were able to efficiently process the substrate and produce the 44-kDa cleavage product, nsp4 (Fig. 1C, lanes 7 and 8). These two constructs encompass all or a major part of the predicted nsp3-TM domain indicating that membrane tethering of PLP2 is important for recognition and processing at CS3. Thus, both SARS-CoV PLpro (Harcourt et al., 2004) and MHV PLP2 require the downstream TM domain for recognition and processing at the nsp3/nsp4 junction. Bioinformatic analysis of nsp3-TM predicts a series of putative membrane-spanning sequences Previously, we showed that MHV nsp3 is indeed an integral membrane protein, but the role of the TM in mediating this membrane association was not investigated (Gosert et al., 2002) . Initial bioinformatic analysis indicated two transmembrane helices in nsp3 (Ziebuhr et al., 2001) . To extend these studies of membrane association of coronavirus replicase products, we analyzed the amino acid sequence of MHV-JHM nsp3 (from glycine-833 to glycine-2840) for probability of transmembrane helices using the five different programs designed to search for putative membrane-spanning sequences: Phobius, TMHMM, HMMTOP, SOSUI and TMpred (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, each program generated a unique prediction for the topology of nsp3 (Fig. 2C ). The number of predicted membrane-spanning domains varied from three (Phobius) to seven (TMpred). However, since both the N-and C-termini of nsp3 are cleaved in the cytosol, the number of membrane-spanning helices must be either two [as previously predicted (Ziebuhr et al., 2001) ], four or six. To better understand the topology of the nsp3-TM domain, we performed membrane-association, fractionation and proteinase K protection experiments.
