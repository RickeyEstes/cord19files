Parallel-directional airflow pattern The parallel-directional airflow pattern is recommended in the guidelines of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 2 This pattern is established by locating the air-supply inlets in the wall opposite the patient, and exhausting the air from the wall behind the bed head. The recommended supply and exhaust vents are broadly rectangular in shape in order to ensure a stable direction of flow. The present study considered two different models of parallel-directional airflow: in model VC-01 (VCZventilation case), the air-supply and exhaust vents are positioned at equal heights in the isolation room; and in model VC-02, the air-supply vents are positioned slightly higher than the exhaust vents. Figure 2 (a) presents the steady-state airflow vectors of model VC-01. The major directions of air flow are indicated by arrows. The air flow is uniform and stable, and has the same flow direction near the patient. Some smaller circulations with a slower velocity exist in the region immediately above the patient. As shown in Figure 2 (b), these circulations contain the coughed droplets that fall in the region near the exhaust vents. The simulation results for model VC-02 are shown in Figure 3 (a). In this case, the major air stream passes through the region above the patient and generates a circulation with an opposite direction to the major stream in the region below, close to the patient. The falling droplets are diffused slightly towards the corner near the door by the circulated flow existing in the region below the patient. However, as shown in Figure 3 (b), the profile of the coughed gas is contained by the major stream above the patient.
