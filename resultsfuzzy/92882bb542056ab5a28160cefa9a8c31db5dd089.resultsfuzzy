To investigate whether EVs act as intercellular mediators during senescence, we took advantage of HFFF2 human foreskin primary fibroblasts expressing an empty vector or oncogenic H-RAS G12V in a 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT)-inducible form (ER:EV or ER:H-RAS G12V ). These cells undergo senescence upon treatment with 200 nM 4OHT (Rapisarda et al., 2017) , without activating the apoptosis pathway, and we have called them iC or iRAS, respectively. The treatment of HFFF2s with whole conditioned media (CM) from iC and iRAS (mimicking OIS) confirm previous findings that senescence can be transmitted in a non-cell-autonomous (paracrine) fashion (Acosta et al., 2013) . Recipient HFFF2s present a decrease in cell proliferation (staining with crystal violet) and an increase in the percentage of cells staining positive for senescence-associated-b-galactosidase (SA-b-Gal) ( Figure S1A ). Next, we dissected the CM from iC and iRAS HFFF2s and isolated large (MV) and small EV (sEV) from the same CM. We followed the well-characterized serial ultracentrifugation protocol (Thé ry et al., 2006) filtering the sEV fraction with a 0.22-mm filter and compared the effect of the MV and sEV fractions in inducing paracrine senescence in comparison to the supernatant (SN) fraction (soluble fraction depleted of MV and sEV) ( Figure 1A ). Both the SN and sEV fraction from iRAS cells induced an upregulation of several markers of senescence in normal HFFF2 compared to iC, as shown by a decrease in bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, an increase in p16 INK4A protein expression levels, the percentage of positive cells for phosphorylated-gH2AX (p-gH2AX), and the accumulation of p53 by immunofluorescence (IF) (Figures 1B and 1C) . Although MVs isolated from iC or iRAS induced a reduction in the incorporation of BrdU, no other markers of senescence were observed, suggesting that only the SN and sEVs from iRAS cells transmit paracrine senescence. Next, to determine whether the cell-cycle arrest observed by the delay in proliferation was maintained long term, we treated HFFF2 twice for 72 h with the different fractions, replated the cells, and determined the growth potential at different days ( Figure 1D ). As observed in Figure 1E , only the SN and sEV fractions derived from iRAS cells were able to induce a delay in proliferation in comparison with the iC. To confirm sEV-PS induction, we treated HFFF2s with increasing concentrations of sEVs derived from iRAS compared to the highest dose of sEVs from iC and observed a dose-dependent senescent response by quantifying the percentage of cells staining positive for SA-b-Gal and the levels of p53 + and BrdU + cells by IF (Figures S1B and S1C). Furthermore, treatment of HFFF2 with the same number of sEVs also transmits the senescent phenotype as shown by the decrease in BrdU incorporation and IL-8 staining by IF ( Figure S1D ), suggesting that the sEV content but not particle number is responsible for sEV-PS. To confirm that sEV-PS was not due to contaminants present in our sEV preparations, we isolated sEVs using an alternative isolation technique, size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The absence of protein contaminants and presence of particles in the sEV fractions were determined (not shown). As can be seen in Figure S1E , sEV isolated by SEC can also mediate paracrine senescence. Therefore, both the soluble fraction and sEVs are responsible for mediating a delay in proliferation and inducing an increase in the expression levels of diverse biomarkers of senescence. (B and C) HFFF2 fibroblasts were treated for 72 h with the different fractions of the CM (SN, MV, or sEV) from iC or iRAS cells, and the endogenous expression of different markers of senescence was determined as shown in (B) representative pictures and by (C) quantifying the percentage of cells staining positive for different antibodies by IF. The graphs represent the means ± SDs of 2-6 independent experiments. Scale bars: 100 mm for BrdU and p53 and 30 mm for p-gH2AX and p16 INK4A . (B) Gene Ontology (GO) analysis for genes involved in cellular processes with >2 log 2 fold differential expression and p < 0.05 in both OIS-and DDIS-treated HFFF2s. The pie chart shows a high proportion of genes related to the ''cell-cycle'' and ''cell proliferation'' pathways.
