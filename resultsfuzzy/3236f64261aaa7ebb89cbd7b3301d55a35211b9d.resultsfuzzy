The raw data collected by the trained assessors was converted into a set of performance indicators that represent the health and safety conditions of each building factor in Table 1 . The analysis of the assessment results will contribute to our understanding of the key factors that influence the variations in the health and safety performance of the apartment buildings. To compute the overall health performance ðBHHI k Þ for building k, one simply needs to aggregate the ratings ðF H;ik Þ and weightings ðw H;i Þ of all n building factors 7 : Similarly, given the respective ratings ðF S;ik Þ and weightings ðw S;i Þ for safety, the overall safety performance of building k is given by its BSCI k : The subscripts H and S denote that a variable belongs to the health and safety equations, respectively. This notation is used throughout this paper. The distributions of the BHHI and BSCI, after the application of Eqs. (1a) and (1b) to each building, are presented in Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively. The median BHHI and BSCI scores were 44% and 56%, respectively. 8 Specifically, the BHHI ranged from 24% to 60%, whereas the BSCI ranged from 35% to 74%. Since the indices are building-specific, the health/safety performance of one building can be compared to the others. A practical use of these results is to let stakeholders know whether a building outperforms or underperforms the median building in the sample. Homebuyers can use the information to ascertain how good a building performs before they make their decisions. It is likely that property values will be affected after the publication of the BHHI and BSCI. Building owners can also make use of the performance information to facilitate their maintenance or refurbishment decisions. In multi-ownership apartment buildings, one of the key obstacles in reaching collective decisions to carry out improvement works is that owners have different, if not conflicting, views on whether or not to make improvements. Sometimes, even though a building is obviously dilapidated, some owners may still not wish to face up to ''reality'' and commit to changes. If the BHHI and BSCI results indicated that the performance of their buildings lags behind that of similar buildings, their intolerant attitudes may change, as they do not want to be losers in the value league. The weighted arithmetic mean was adopted to combine individual ratings into a single index because it is the most commonly used functional form for score aggregation in building performance assessment schemes. This form is predominately used in most of the pronounced schemes, such as the building research establishment environmental assessment method, the leadership in energy and environmental design and GBTool. Although So and Wong [14] counter-proposed using the weighted geometric mean for index aggregation, their viewpoints were not substantiated, neither theoretically nor empirically. 8 Note that the BHHI and BSCI have different objectives (i.e., health and safety), so their scores should not be compared.
