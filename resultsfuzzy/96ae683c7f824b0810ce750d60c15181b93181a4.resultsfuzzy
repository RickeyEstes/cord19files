Establishment of I. tinctoria hairy roots Based on results of preliminary experiments (data not shown), the petiole sections of I. tinctoria were provided as the potential donor explants for the genetic transformation with A. rhizogenes strain LBA9402. The successful transformation was indicated by the direct emergence of roots, formation of callus or gall-like structures from the wounded sites of explants. The optimal transformation rate (76.67%) was obtained when 3 week-old petiole explants were cocultured for 2 days with the supplementation of 125 Î¼M acetosyringone and 1.5 mM arginine. The transformed roots would emerge at the wounded sites of explants after 3 weeks of cultivation. Subsequently, the independently transformed hairy root lines were excised and subcultured on MS/2 solid medium with antibiotics to eliminate bacteria. As presented in Fig. 1C , the established I. tinctoria hairy roots exhibited the typical morphological characteristics with vigorous growth on phytohormone-free medium, lack of geotropism and extensive lateral branching.
