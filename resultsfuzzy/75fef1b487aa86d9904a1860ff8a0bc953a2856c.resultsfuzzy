The cross-sectional seroprevalence study included samples from 1421 dromedary camels from 83 herds in five counties. The overall individual-level seroprevalence was 63.7% (95% confidence interval 61.2-66.2%). At the herd level, 86.7% of herds had at least one seropositive camel (95% CI 79.5-94.0%) while the mean seroprevalence within all herds was 57.6% (95% CI 50.8-64.4%). Table 2 shows seroprevalence by county, age, sex and production system. Differences in seroprevalence can be seen across the different factors, perhaps most strikingly between counties and production systems. Two counties (Nakuru and Laikipia) contained all ranching herds, while only a few pastoral herds were sampled in Laikipia, and none in Nakuru. The seroprevalence levels by county and production system are consistent with this clustering. Furthermore, ranching herds tended to be smaller. The average herd size was 77 camels, with no herds having more than 200 camels. Pastoral herds by comparison had an average herd size of 128 camels. Ranch had less contact with other animals including camels, livestock and wildlife (data not shown). Conversely, age and sex were similarly distributed among the two production systems. For these reasons and due to a large difference in seroprevalence, production system appeared to be an important characteristic in camel raising and MERS-CoV transmission, and was the basis for exploring FOI separately in ranching and pastoral herds. Table 3 shows the FOI estimates for pastoral and ranching herds for constant, linear and quadratic models, along with each model's AIC. FOI was consistently lower for ranching herds than pastoral herds. According to AIC values, the quadratic model was the best fit for pastoral herds, while the simple catalytic model was the best fit for ranching herds. Among pastoral herds, FOI was higher in the youngest and oldest age groups (0.69 and 1.05, respectively), while the middle age groups had lower FOIs. Among camel herds raised in a ranch setting, the age-independent FOI was estimated to be 0.039. Figures 2 and 3 show the observed mean seroprevalence for each age group with 95% confidence intervals as well as the model outputs of expected seroprevalence and best fit FOI for pastoral and ranching herds. Table 4 lists the sample size (number of observations) and seroprevalence per production system and age group. Examination of residual vs. leverage plots for pastoral herds identified three observations that were possible outliers, with high standardised Pearson residual, high leverage or both. FOI model outputs did not appreciably change after stepwise removal of the three observations (data not shown); therefore, reported results include the complete dataset.
