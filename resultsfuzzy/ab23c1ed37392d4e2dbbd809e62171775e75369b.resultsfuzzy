Since enhanced rDC migration to DLNs is predicted to result in enhanced virus-specific T cell responses, we next examined the magnitude of total and MA15-specific T cell responses in the lungs of CL treated and control infected mice. Clodronate treatment resulted in greater numbers of activated CD8 and CD4 T cells in the MA15-infected lung ( Fig. S4 A and B ), compared to PBS treatment, as determined by CD43 (clone 1B11) expression. The latter is upregulated on activated effector T cells [38, 39] . To assess effects on MA15-specific T cell responses, we initially identified a set of H-2 d -restricted virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells epitopes using lung derived cells harvested from infected mice and a peptide library covering all four structural proteins (S, N, M, E) of SARS-CoV. Several IFN-c inducing CD8 and CD4 epitopes in the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (S366-374, S521-529, S1061-1071 and N353-370) were identified (manuscript in preparation). Some of these epitopes were described previously, but S521 and S1061 epitopes were newly discovered. Of note, all other previously described H-2 d -restricted T cell epitopes were not recognized by lung-derived T cells in our assays [40, 41, 42] . These previous reports identified T cell epitopes using adenovirus vectors or DNA constructs expressing single SARS-CoV proteins, or isolated peptides. We speculate that the numbers of T cells recognizing these previously described epitopes are present at very low levels in infected mice compared to the immunodominant epitopes that we identify, possibly because of differences in antigen presentation between infected and immunized mice. Using these epitopes, we found that AM-depleted mice exhibited earlier and more robust virus-specific T cell responses, as measured by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) for IFN-c, whereas control mice had almost no virus-specific T cell responses at days 6 and 7 p.i. (Fig. 3 A and B ). PBS-treated mice that survived until day 8 p.i. mounted virus-specific T cell responses in the lung, but at a level that was much less than observed in CLtreated mice. We confirmed that these cells were functional using in vivo cytotoxicity assays. Na√Øve splenocytes were costained with PKH26 and CFSE, pulsed with MA15-specific CD8 T cell peptides and adoptively transferred i.n. into mice 12 h before harvest of total lung cells. Robust CD8 T cell cytotoxic responses were observed in AM-depleted mice, with 40%-50% killing of virus-specific targets. By comparison, only about 5% of target cells were lysed in control mice (Fig. 3 C) .
