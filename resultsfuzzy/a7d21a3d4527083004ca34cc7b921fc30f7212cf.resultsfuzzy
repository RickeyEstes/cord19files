Early or resolving inflammatory arthritides may present a diagnostic dilemma. Waxing and waning immune-mediated disorders may present with cell counts that are only mildly to moderately elevated with less than 50% neutrophils and may be mistaken for degenerative disorders. Repeat arthrocentesis may be needed to diagnose these cases during fulminant inflammation. Canine rheumatoid arthritis, an erosive immune-mediated disorder, may present with either a predominantly neutrophilic or predominantly mononuclear synovial fluid, making the diagnosis more difficult [5] . Lymphoplasmacytic synovitis, an immune-mediated condition characterized by synovial hyperplasia and nodular aggregates of lymphoid cells, exhibits a moderately elevated synovial fluid cell count (5000-20,000 cells per milliliter) with a predominance of small mononuclear cells, presumably lymphocytes [25] . Neutrophilic inflammation may be seen unexpectedly in cases of degenerative arthritis with as many as 12,000 cells per milliliter and up to 56% neutrophils [7] . Virally induced arthritis may present either as a mild or marked mononuclear effusion as in feline calicivirus or as a suppurative response [17, 18, 45] . Taking into account these difficulties, it is not always possible to differentiate between infectious and immune-mediated etiologies by synovial fluid evaluation alone. The history, physical examination, and serologic tests for infectious agents or immunologic disease may be necessary to separate the causes of suppurative arthritis [48] . The distribution of joint involvement may provide valuable information. Septic arthritis is usually monoarticular and most often affects the proximal joints (hip, shoulder, and stifle). Immune-mediated disorders are often pauciarticular (two to five joints) to polyarticular (more than five joints), with more severe disease in the distal joints (carpi and tarsi) [31] . Multiple joints may need to be sampled to demonstrate the polyarticular nature of the disorder. Monoarthritic immunemediated disease occasionally affects only the elbow joint. Systemic infections with joint involvement usually present as polyarthritis, and the pathogenesis often has both an infectious and immune-mediated component. In addition, antigenic bacterial fragments may perpetuate inflammation initiated by a septic process in the absence of viable organisms [2] . Serologic tests for immune-mediated disorders (antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor) and infectious agents (Ehrlichia sp and B. burgdorferi) may assist in identification of the etiology. Culture of synovial fluid is important in differentiating between infectious and immune-mediated arthritis. Attention should be paid to proper handling of the specimen and culturing techniques to capitalize on the probability of recovering the etiologic agent. Remember, however, that several infectious agents, such as Mycoplasma, bacterial L-forms, protozoa, or anaerobic bacteria, cannot be grown with routine culture procedures. The most common bacterial isolates from joint fluid are b-hemolytic streptococcus (Lancefield group C), staphylococci, hemolytic Escherichia coli, Pasteurella sp, and Erysipelothrix sp [2] . Less frequent isolates include Nocardia sp, Proteus sp, Pseudomonas sp, and anaerobic bacteria [22] .
