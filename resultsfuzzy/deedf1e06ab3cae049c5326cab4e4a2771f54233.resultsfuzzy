Model structure The simulated epidemic has been constructed to be close to the parameters reported for the recent Ebola epidemic by the WHO Ebola Response Team [1] , with the exception of the incubation period which has been allowed to be slightly different from the latent period. Each infected individual follows a stochastic SEIR model with all time periods following Gamma distributions, the time unit being 1 day. The latent period E is assumed to be Γ(2, 1/5) (mean = 10, sd = 7.1) and the infectious period Γ(1, 1/5) (mean = 5, sd = 5). After the infectious period, the individual may either recover, with probability 30%, or die, with probability 70%. The time until recovery is assumed to be Γ(4, 1/3) (mean = 12, sd = 6) and the time to death Γ(4/9, 1/9) (mean = 4, sd = 6). Furthermore, each individual has an incubation period (time until symptoms) which is assumed to be similar to the latent period, but with some variation. The incubation period is given by E times a uniformly distributed variable in the interval [0.8, 1.2] . It is assumed that a case is reported when symptoms arise. Finally, during the infectious period, new cases are produced with rate 0.34/day, resulting in R 0 = 0.34 · 5 = 1.7. The stochastic process as such is a Crump-Mode-Jagers branching process, in which the expected incidence of infections b(t) satisfies (see [2] ) the renewal equation The solution to this equation quickly approaches exponential growth ∼ Ce rt , where r is the so called Malhtusian parameter. The same exponential growth, although with different constants, will also apply to the total number of infected, reported, recovered, dead, etc., individuals. It is easily shown (see e.g. [3] ) that the generation time distribution f G in the above model is Γ(3, 1/5) (mean = 15, sd = 8.7) and that the Malthusian parameter is r = λ(R 1/α 0 − 1) = 0.0387. The deterministic doubling time is 17.9 days. Duration of simulations Only "exploding" trajectories, corresponding to "big" outbreaks, are kept. Outbreaks start with 1 infected individual and are rejected if they do not reach 4500 reported cases. At the time of reaching this level, some statistics are collected and then the simulation is continued for 6 weeks further. The purpose of this continuation is that a prediction of the final level 6 weeks later is attempted, based on the first 4500 cases. Statistics are based on 1000 accepted trajectories. Programming details The simulation program was written in standard C, because of the need to keep links (pointers) between infectors and infectees, in order to simulate contact tracing, and executed on a desktop computer. Results from the simulations were elaborated using the software R to produce the R 0 and r estimates, and the 6 week projections as well as statistical summaries. Random number generation for Gamma distributions with non-integer shape parameter used the algorithm of Phillips & Beightler [4] . Time from introduction of first case to 4500 notified Average and median approximately 200 days (sd = 33), but with a range of [123, 358] . A deterministic estimate would probably be ln(4500)/r = 217, where r is the exponential increase rate. The slight difference might be due to the conditioning on non-extinct trajectories. Furthermore, the largest part of variability is in the first part of the epidemic. If one divides the time period in a first part until the first 100 (cumulative) cases are reached and a second part until level 4500 is reached, one finds that the first part has average length 102 days with sd = 28 and the 95% central range [63, 174] and that the second part has mean 98 days, sd = 10 and 95% range [83, 119]. Stability of various ratios when 4500 cases have been notified At the time of 4500 cases notified (in total), the numbers of individuals infected, who had died or who had gotten well, were recorded. It should be noted that the total number of infected is not realistically observable, but of interest to estimate. It should also be noted that all numbers above are examples of delayed observations, from infection to notification and from notification to final destiny. One should therefore expect that the ratios should stabilize around values given by the formula (8) in Section 6 of the main paper. The ratio notified/infected was, on average, 0.70 with 95% of values between 0.68 and 0.72, essentially identical to the theoretical prediction based on "knowing" the incubation time distribution, which was assumed to also be the time from infection to notification. The narrow range of the observed ratios indicates that this is a viable method to predict the true actual size of the outbreak from the number of notified cases, given that good estimates of the distribution of time to notification and exponential increase rate are available. An analogous result holds for the ratios of infected to dead or recovered individuals. With the specific parameters of the simulations, at 4500 notifications, on average 3350 of them had either recovered or died, and the remaining 1150 remained between notification and final destiny. At the time of 4500 notifications, an average of 1900 additional individuals had been infected but not yet notified. Observed generation times and serial intervals In each simulation run, 500 generation times and 500 serial intervals were sampled from the first 4500 notified individuals by systematically taking every ninth individual until the sample was complete. The times and intervals were ascertained "backwards", i.e. the infector of the chosen individual was identified and time distance between the respective infection or symptom times was recorded. The distributions of sample means are reasonably concentrated around the respective central values, 12.5 for serial intervals and 12.6 for generation times. It should be remembered that theory predicts that both should have the same expected value which should be less than the true expected generation time, which is 15. Theory again predicts that the backward generation time should have mean 12.57, which is not far from what is observed. The variance of the true generation time is 75 (sd = 8.7) and both variance estimates from the simulation samples tend to be much less, somewhat above 50 (sd = 7.1). This also leads to the useful conclusion that serial intervals are affected by the same "contraction" as generation times when ascertained "backwards", at least in the chosen parameter setting. Predicting the size of the outbreak at a later time Finally, we study the performance of the renewal equation (Section 2, Eq. (5), main paper) approach proposed in [1] . This approach is intended to allow estimation of R t (in our simulation, R t is kept constant = R 0 all the time and the method is adapted accordingly) and to further allow prediction of cases 6 weeks (42 days) after the last observed datum. The results, using probabilities derived from observing backward serial intervals, thus biased with respect to the true generation time distribution, indicate that this method seriously underestimates R 0 but has good predictive power anyway. The 95% range of the ratio predicted/true values at 6 weeks after the level 4500 notified has been reached is [−10%, +12%], which is slightly better than just using a growth rate based estimate (i.e. just multiplying with exp(42r), using some good estimate of the growth rate r) derived from the first 4500 cases. This is perhaps natural, since the method amounts to an adaptive regression method which has fitted all the observed data up to level 4500 as well as possible, and then extrapolated this fit. As predicted by theory, the estimate of R 0 that results from this method underestimates the true value, in fact the true value 1.7 is never reached in 1000 simulations. The average estimate of R 0 is 1.57, with 95% range [1.51, 1.63], compared to the true value 1.7, thus having an average bias of −8%. In Section 4 of the main paper it is shown that E(G) = E(S) but that V ar(S) = V ar(G) + 2Cov(s 0 , 0 + g * − s 0 ) (it should be noted that the distribution of the infectious period and thus of g * depends on a sizebiased version of the model infectious period (see e.g. [5] ), but that this does not affect the present argument). Since the simulation model assumes independence between latent period 0 and the infectious period, upon which g * depends and that s 0 = u 0 , where u ∼ Uniform[0.8, 1.2], the difference between V ar(S) and V ar(G) can be written as 2(Cov(u 0 , 0 ) − V ar(u 0 )). Since E(u) = 1, this reduces to 2E( 2 0 )(1 − E(u 2 )). Since E( 2 0 ) = 150 and E(u 2 ) = 1.0133, we should have V ar(S) − V ar(G) = 3.99. Furthermore, in the model we have G ∼ Γ(3, 1/5) and thus V ar(G) = 75. In the simulation results, we find the estimates V ar(G) ≈ 52.4 and V ar(S) ≈ 54.6. However, the generation times are observed "backwards", in which case theory predicts that the observed distribution should change from Γ(3, 0.2) to Γ(3, 0.2387), leading to V ar(G) = 52.7, which is now in good agreement with simulations. It thus appears that the "backward" observation shortening also affects the observed serial intervals and the difference between observed generation time and serial interval distributions. In this case, in order to theoretically predict the observed difference in variances, one would have to calculate the effect of "backward" observation of a generation time on the marginal distribution of the corresponding latent and incubation periods. Finally, it may be interesting to investigate how large the quotient between the coefficient of variation of S and that of G (the parameter c in a previous Section) is as a consequence of model assumptions. Since the means of G and S are the same, we will have c 2 = V ar(S)/V ar(G) and thus c 2 = 78.99/75 = 1.053 according to the above calculations. Thus c = 1.026 in the simulation model.
