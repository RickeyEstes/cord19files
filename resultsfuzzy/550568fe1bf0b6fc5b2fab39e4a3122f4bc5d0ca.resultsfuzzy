Unfortunately, we made a mistake in the previous version of our manuscript: We had listed 40 PFU as infection dose but our experiments had been done with 10 PFU. We apologize for this mistake and we corrected it in the revised version. 10 PFU of the mouse-adapted strain of pandemic H1N1 correspond to 5xLD50 under Swiss animal rights legislation, meaning that the dose used is lethal and already constitutes a high dose. We therefore used the same infection conditions as in our previous mouse experiments but measured weight loss and survival instead of virus titers. Given the modest (but significant) differences in lung virus titers it is probably not too surprising that no significant differences in weight loss or survival were detected. Furthermore, we also examined the lungs of mice on d4 p.i. and compared mock-treated to inhibitor-treated animals (please see figure below). As expected, a clear difference can be seen between mock-infected and influenza A virus-infected animals but no difference was detectable between mock-treated and inhibitor-treated mice. These results show that GRK2 inhibition by paroxetine from d-1 up to d2 results in a significant reduction of virus titers upon challenge with a lethal dose of pandemic H1N1, but is not potent enough to protect from weight loss, death or lung pathology. We discuss these results in l. 371-377. 2. The reviewer appreciates the effort made to define which step of early infection the GRK2 involves. The authors concluded that GRK2 is critical for viral core uncoating from M1 proteins before entering cytoplasm. The current dogma is that the physical conditions, most importantly, the low pH environment inside the virion caused by the IAV proton channel protein M2, is essential for uncoating. Numerous in vitro experiments have agreed the indispensability of low pH condition, nevertheless, there should be other regulatory mechanisms inside the cells. The GRK2 regulation of uncoating is a novel discovery, however, the mechanism is not clear. First, GRK2 kinase activity is required, but the potential substrates involved in uncoating are not even discussed. Secondly, is GRK2 activated after IAV infection or is it constitutively activated? If GRK2 activation is induced by IAV, is there any phosphorylated peptide of GRK2 found in the phosphorylation profiling in the Figure 1 ? It is also interesting to know whether GRK2 phosphorylates viral proteins, such as M1, and the effects of such phosphorylation on uncoating process. In addition, we analysed whether GRK2 changes in localization upon IAV infection as it had been reported that activated GRK2 translocates to the plasma membrane. Indeed, we observed recruitment of GRK2 to the plasma membrane within minutes of IAV infection. These new results are shown in figure 3f and described in l. 251-262 . Furthermore, we observed that the translocation of GRK2 was dependent on EGFR expression (figure 3g) suggesting that GRK2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated by EGFR and thereby activated upon IAV infection. This would explain why we did not detect a GRK2phosphopeptide with our phosphoserine and-threonine specific protocol. control-and inhibitor-treated samples. We thus conclude that GRK2 does not impact the phosphorylation status of M1, M2 and NP and most likely does not exert its proviral role during uncoating via phosphorylation of viral proteins. These novel results are shown in supplementary figure S6, described, and discussed in l. 326-332 and l. 431-434. 1. Line 85, to my understanding, "the phosphorylation" should be "the tyrosine phosphorylation" of EGFR. If it is true, what is the rational not to include tyrosine phosphorylation profile? We changed "phosphorylation" to "tyrosine phosphorylation" in l.88 according to the reviewer's suggestion. It would certainly be very interesting to also look at tyrosine phosphorylation events in response to influenza virus infection. However, in contrast to serine and threonine phosphoproteomics, in which metal affinity purification is used for phosphopeptide enrichment, tyrosine phosphoproteomics mostly relies on the use of antibody-based immunoaffinity purification (6). Although the quality of the anti-phospho-Tyr antibodies and the number of available protocols have increased during the last years, this approach is still technically challenging and the coverage and number of phosphopeptides detected in such studies is modest when compared with similar ones focusing on serine and threonine phosphorylation. 


Section:in order to address this point we performed additional mouse experiments using paroxetine as grk2 inhibitor and assessed weight loss and survival upon infection with influenza a virus. the new results are shown in supplementary figures s7b-c and the text has been updated accordingly (l. 363-366).
Section:using this system, we monitored grk2 phosphorylation at early time points of iav infection and observed a phosphorylated form of grk2 appearing upon iav infection. these new results are shown in figures 3d-e and described in l. 229-250.
Section:in addition, we analysed the impact of grk2 on the phosphorylation status of viral proteins. we again used phos-tag sds-page (2) and analysed the banding pattern of viral proteins early in infection in the absence or presence of the grk2 inhibitor grk2i. given that we found grk2 to be required for iav entry at the level of uncoating we focused on viral m1, m2 and np, the major viral players in uncoating. as shown in the new supplementary figure s6 we did not detect phosphorylated forms of np and m1 in control cells or inhibitor-treated cells. in line with published results (5), we detected phosphorylated m2 in the incoming virus but no difference in banding pattern was observed between
