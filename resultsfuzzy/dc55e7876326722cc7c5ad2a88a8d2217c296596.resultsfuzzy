Clinical characteristics of the ILI case-outpatients A total of 1970 ILL outpatients who met the ILI-case definition criteria were enrolled in this study. Of these outpatients, 51.8% were male. The mean age was 19.7±16.9 years. A temperature reading of >39°C was documented in 262(13.3%) of the subjects. A total of 67.9% of the subjects reported a cough, 51% pharyngalgia, 40.5% running nose, 32.4% fatigue, 28.2% headache, and 7.6% myalgia. Patients infected with influenza virus experienced higher temperatures and more coughs, running noses, headaches and fatigue than patients infected with other viruses or patients who were virus-free(p <0.001) ( Table 1 ).
