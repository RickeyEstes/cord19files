Using flow cytometric analysis, we first compared the absolute numbers of circulating CD3 + , CD4 + , and CD8 + T cells in 53 patients at the acute and convalescent stages of S-OIV infection with that of the healthy control individuals. As shown in Fig. 1A , patients infected with S-OIV clearly experienced T cell loss in peripheral blood during the acute stage of infection. The mean absolute CD3 + , CD4 + , and CD8 + T cell counts in healthy individuals were 1556, 8836, and 603 cells/μl, respectively; whereas those in patients with S-OIV infection were markedly lower, at 994, 492, and 410 cells/μl, respectively. Among the 53 patients, patients at early clinical onset showed lower T cell counts (649 cells/ μl for CD3 + , 304 cells/μl for CD4 + , and 274 cells/μl for CD8 + T cells), and T cell counts were progressively increased in patients at the intermediate (1086 cells/μl for CD3 + , 534 cells/μl for CD4 + , and 444 cells/μl for CD8 + T cells) and late stages (1168 cells/μl for CD3 + , 599 cells/μl for CD4 + , and 476 cells/μl for CD8 + T cells). These data showed that S-OIV infection leads to a rapid depletion of CD3 + , CD4 + , and CD8 + T cell at the early stage (1-3 days), followed by a rapid and significant restoration of CD3 + , CD4 + , and CD8 + T cells at 4 days after the onset of illness. However, the disparate patterns of T cell restoration were observed in patients at the early and intermediate stages after oseltamivir therapy. As shown in Fig. 1 , absolute cell counts almost doubled for CD3 + , CD4 + , and CD8 + T cell subsets when compared within patients between the early and convalescent stages (1136 cells/μl for CD3 + , 551 cells/μl for CD4 + , and 465 cells/μl for CD8 + T cells); however, absolute cell counts for CD3 + , CD4 + , and CD8 + T cell subsets showed a decreasing trend when compared within patients between the intermediate and convalescent stages (966 cells/μl for CD3 + , 470 cells/μl for CD4 + , and 393 cells/μl for CD8 + T cells), and we observed no significant differences in absolute cell counts for CD3 + , CD4 + , and CD8 + T cell subsets within patients from the late and convalescent stages. We further analyzed CD38 and HLA-DR antigen expression in these patients. As shown in Fig. 1B , we found that acute S-OIV-infected patients at the early stage had higher percentages of CD38 and HLA-DR in all CD4 + T cells (21.6% for CD38 and 17.5% for HLA-DR) than in healthy controls (13.0% for CD38 and 13.1% for HLA-DR); in contrast, we observed upregulated CD38 expression and no significant differences in HLA-DR expression on CD8 + T cells in acute S-OIV-infected
