Antibacterial activity Ethanol extract of elder flowers and berries Inhibitory activity for most of the 13 nosocomial pathogens (e.g. At least 3 L of elderberry juice, 3 Sambucus nigra tablets and 9 Asparagus officinalis tablets/day 15 days The BMI index dropped by approx. 3%, the weight fell by an average of 3.2 kg, systolic blood pressure decreased by an average of over 5% and diastolic blood pressure by 2.5% Chrubasik et al. (2008) Effect on weight reduction and urinary parameters 11 volunteers Diluted (1:5) concentrate of elderberries (from 120 g of berries) and flowers (flower juice and extract from 3.9 g of dried flowers) 200 ml divided into up 6 portions 7 days An average weight reduction was 2.6 kg; no effect on pH, hydrogen ion concentration and 24 h hydrogen excretion in urine; no effect on the solubility of stone-inducing ions Walz and Chrubasik (2008) (continued on next page) was not observed significantly differences in serum lipids between elderberry and control group, however, aspartate transaminase and fasting glucose were decreased in elderberry group of mice. Hepatic and intestinal mRNA changes with an improvement in HDL function and a decrease in hepatic cholesterol levels were also reported in elderberryfed mice. Additionally, this group showed significantly higher activity of serum paraxonase-1 arylesterase. The results indicate the reduction of elderberry in aorta total cholesterol content and then less atherosclerosis progression (Farrel, Norris, Lee, Chun, & Blesso, 2015) . A randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blind study was conducted to determine the impact of anthocyanins obtained from elderberry juice on the lipid and antioxidant status. 34 healthy volunteers received 400 mg of spray-dried elderberry powder in gelatinous capsules or placebo three times a day during 2 and 3 weeks. Each capsule contained 10% anthocyanins and represented the equivalent of 5 ml of elderberry juice. Furthermore, an additional trial was carried out to study the short-term effect of elderberry anthocyanins on serum lipid concentration, where six volunteers received a single dose of 10 capsules, which was the equivalent of 50 ml of elderberry juice. In the placebo-controlled study, the elderberry group did not show statistically significant differences in changes in serum lipids as well as vitamin A, E and Î²-carotene, compared to the placebo group, and even, a decrease in the level of vitamin C was observed in both groups. In a single-dose experiment conducted as part of the same study, an increase in total anthocyanins in serum was found during the postprandial phase. The serum lipids concentration was lower in the elderberry group, but differences were not significant (Murkovic et al., 2004) . In a study in which patients took, among others, dietary supplements from the fruit and flowers of Sambucus nigra, the BMI index dropped by approx. 3%, the weight fell by an average of 3.2 kg, systolic blood pressure decreased by an average of over 5% and diastolic blood pressure by 2.5%. Moreover, physical and mental well-being as well as the quality of life of the patients significantly improved . A diluted concentrate from elder berries and flowers, used among others in hypocaloric diet in Switzerland, resulted in average weight loss of 2.6 kg in 11 volunteers during 7 days of diet (Walz & Chrubasik, 2008) . Mahmoudi et al. (2014) evaluated the antidepressant activity of elderberry extracts by exposing mice to the forced swimming test (FST) and the tail suspension test (TST). The tests demonstrated very good antidepressant properties of the extract tested: it shortened the immobility time and increased the activity of mice which were given the extract as compared to the control group, with the immobility time and activity level being dependent on the extract dose. Moreover, elderberry extract at a dose of 1200 mg/kg caused a far higher activity of mice in the FST than imipramine (10 mg/kg), a strong and effective antidepressant drug (Mahmoudi et al., 2014) .
