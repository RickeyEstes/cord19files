The SADF and GSADF techniques are applied in this paper to test the existence of multiple copper bubbles. The SADF and GSADF statistics, with the respective sample critical values, are recorded in Table 1 . The statistics of both tests are 5.959 and 8.524, which exceed their 1% righttailed critical values, respectively. According to the results, the null hypothesis is rejected at the 1% significance level, which reveals that there are multiple episodes of explosive behavior in the copper price. On the basis of SADF and GSADF techniques, we conclude that exuberance exists in the international copper market, which allows us to investigate the possible existence of bubble episodes. According to the results of the BSADF test, we graph the estimate of the copper price with 95% confidence intervals in Fig. 2 to locate multiple bubble episodes. The upper curve presents the international copper price. The middle curve presents the 95% critical value. The bottom curve represents the BSADF statistics. The starting point of a bubble is defined as the first observation at which the BSADF statistic is greater than the critical value obtained from Monte Carlo simulations, while the ending point is the first observation after the starting date at which the BSADF statistic is smaller than the critical value. We focus on the origination and collapse of explosive behaviors and detect four copper price bubble episodes during the sample period. The technique exhibits greater window flexibility since it covers more subsamples. According to this argument, we can provide evidence for multiple bubbles in the international copper market and explore possible reasons behind them. Table 2 offers further information with regard to the length and magnitude of four bubble episodes examined in the international copper price. In terms of bubble length, the bubble behaviors that occurred in 1987, 2004, and 2011 proved to be short-lived, with respective durations of 7, 4, and 4 months. The bubble episode that occurred in 2005-2008 covers the longest period, lasting 41 mouths. In addition, it is concluded that the four bubble periods occurred when the copper market experienced dramatic price variations. In particular, the starting point of the longest bubble episode coincides with a price change magnitude of 138.515%. Moreover, copper bubbles generally occur when the price soars and burst when the price drops sharply. We further apply the probit model to explore how macroeconomic determinants affect bubble behavior and the relative importance of each contributing factor. Specifically, copper supply, copper demand, the interest rate, dollar movements and speculation are represented by global refined copper production, global refined copper consumption, the federal funds rate, the U.S. dollar index and the noncommercial net long position, respectively. According to Table 3 , the absolute value of the log likelihood statistic exceeds the 5% critical value, indicating strong explanatory power of the variables. Consequently, we further illustrate the impact of each variable in details. First, the coefficient of copper supply is confirmed to be negative and statistically significant, suggesting that copper supply has a negative regulatory effect on the occurrence of bubbles. The marginal effect suggests that the likelihood of a price bubble increases by 4.8% for a unit decrease in copper supply. When physical supply decreases and is even lower than demand, the insufficient supply puts upward pressure on the copper price, raising the likelihood of bubble occurrence. Second, we find that an increase in copper demand raises the likelihood of price bubbles, complementing similar findings in commodity market (Figuerola-Ferretti et al., 2015; . Specifically, the expansion of copper demand by 1% increases the likelihood of a price bubble by approximately 10.3%. Considering short-term copper productions are inelastic, increased demand might contribute to large movements in the copper price, which supports explosive behavior (Bosch and Pradkhan, 2015) . Third, the interest rate is confirmed to negatively affect bubble occurrence. Nevertheless, the impact of the interest rate is statistically insignificant. Fourth, the result suggests bubble behavior is more likely to occur when the dollar depreciates. Since the international copper price is typically denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in the dollar's value inevitably result in fluctuations in the copper price and promote mildly explosive price behavior (Chen et al., 2019) . Moreover, the depreciation of the U.S. dollar prompts investors to seek alternative approaches to asset allocation, including commodities, contributing to the rapid influx of funds into the commodity market (Hammoudeh et al., 2013) . The rapid increase of trading capital leads to a surge in the copper price, which promotes the formation of price bubbles. Finally, speculation is demonstrated to exert a positive effect on bubble occurrences. With the financialization of commodity markets, increasingly more financial speculators participate in commodity futures markets. Financial speculators affect price fluctuations and bubble behaviors via noncommercial positions (Chen et al., 2019) . In the case of the expectation of further rises, speculators buy a range of copper futures, leading to increases in noncommercial net long positions (Mayer et al., 2017) . In this context, speculators destabilize market prices by triggering positive feedback trading among trend followers who ignore fundamental information and buy futures as prices rise, which pushes up the international copper price and raises the likelihood of price bubbles (Bosch and Pradkhan, 2015) . On the basis of the date-stamp bubbles in the international copper market, this paper further links the four bubble episodes to macroeconomic determinants. The first bubble originated in October 1987 and collapsed in April 1988, lasting nearly seven months. The price bubble was driven more by supply than by demand, in consideration of the massive supply disruptions and capacity constraints in major copperproducing countries. As reported by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS, 1932 (USGS, -2011 , Chile has the largest reserves of potentially realizable copper (28%), followed by Peru (13%), Australia (12.5%) and the United States (5%). Since 1987, the copper output of key producing countries such as Peru, Chilean Zambia has experienced a continuous decline due to a series of episodes of political unrest or mine depletion (Todorova et al., 2014) . In addition, the U.S. copper industry cut production capacity by 15%, implying potential supply shocks. By the end of 1987, a nationwide strike by Peru's largest labor federation sharply reduced export supply and drove the massive price surge (Crowson, 1988 ). Therefore, worldwide inventory level fell drastically through 1987 to 1988, which resulted in the emergence of a supply shortfall of approximately 170,000 tons in 1988 (Humphreys, 1988) . Moreover, along with the weakening of the U.S. dollar since 1987, metal costs at the margin rose strongly in dollar terms and further generated upward pressure on the copper price, contributing to the substantial increase to peak at almost $2900 per ton in December 1988 (Crowson, 1988) . In general, supply disruptions limit production responses from keeping pace with growing demand, ultimately driving the copper price from its fundamental value and fostering the occurrence of bubbles. In pace with the continuing growth of global supply, facilitated by the reactivation of idle capacity and new investments in production, the copper price gradually decreased, followed by the bursting of the bubble. The second bubble arose in January 2004 and crashed in April. As illustrated by Lasheras et al. (2015) , commodity booms are regularly concomitant with positive market fundamentals and worldwide economy development. After the trough of the cyclical recession in 2001-2002, the accelerated process of global economic recovery and sustained industrial expansion from 2003 gave strong impetus to robust demand in the international copper market (Irandoust, 2017) . Specifically, with the implementation of a series of easy policies (low interest rates and tax cuts), U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) grew sharply by 4.4% in the first quarter of 2004, which substantially stimulated copper demand in industrial manufacturing. The Japanese economic recovery was also unexpectedly strong, with growth of 3.7% in 2004, the highest level since 1991, which enlarged the effective need for commodities including copper. Following the recovery from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in late 2003, Chinese GDP grew by 9.8% in the first quarter of 2004, mainly supported by strong investment growth, dramatically fostering the increase in domestic copper consumption. Meanwhile, global copper inventories experienced a sharp decline as a result of capacity constraints, which led to insufficient supply to meet expanding consumption demand (Figuerola-Ferretti et al., 2015) . Overall, the imbalance between rigid supply and explosive demand gave an impetus to the surge in the copper price during this phase. Furthermore, abundant global liquidity associated with low interest rates triggered massive capital inflows to the copper market, further driving the price upswing above fundamental value and fueling the bubble-type pattern (Baffes and Savescu, 2014) . Until the second quarter of 2004, higher prices and projections of a continued shortfall in production gradually encouraged reactivations of idle capacity and investments in the mining industry, easing the tight supply situation. In addition, the growing expectation of soaring U.S. interest rates contributed to declining investor participation in the copper market, resulting in the bubble's burst. The third bubble is observed to begin in March 2005 and crash in July 2008. This episode lasted over three years, which is proved to be the longest bubble period. From 2005, the international copper price experienced a continued, substantial surge from $3168 per ton to over $8000 per ton, followed by a high and volatile trend. The copper price Note: * and ** denote significance at the 10% and 5% significance levels, respectively. subsequently plummeted by almost 65% within just half a year after the global financial crisis. This bubble-type trend is largely attributable to huge demand shocks, given the sharp rise in demand for industrial metals, particularly in emerging economies. The drastic demand growth of copper in developing regions, including developing Asia, Latin America and Africa, has exerted tremendous force on the explosive price surge as they pass through the industrialization and urbanization stages (Jerrett and Cuddington, 2008) . Given that growth in industrializing countries tends to be highly metal intensive, demand for copper also increases substantially, even exceeding the economic growth rate (Humphreys, 2010) . In the case of China, due to growing demand from large infrastructure projects, it has become one of the world's largest consumers of copper, accounting for approximately two-fifths of global consumption and playing a significant role in the global copper boom (Northey et al., 2014) . In 2006, the Chinese government announced the 11th national Five-Year Plan for accelerating urbanization and revitalizing the manufacturing industry and invested RMB800 billion for the construction of a power grid, contributing to enormous copper demand and driving the price up. Against this background of tight supply and demand situations, the sustained depreciation of the dollar in 2007 induced huge capital inflows into the copper market and exacerbated the substantial rising trend to take the international copper price to its peak, triggering the occurrence of a bubble (Buncic and Moretto, 2015) . Moreover, copper commodity futures allow market participants to hedge against increased uncertainty and diversify portfolio risk through alternative investment tools, which induces an exponential increase in fund inflows and price deviations from fundamentals (Demiralay and Ulusoy, 2014) . Speculators and financial arbitrageurs gravitate toward commodity assets including copper for their low correlations with equities, thereby heavily amplifying the variability and uncertainty in the international copper market (Sensoy, 2013) . In general, the financialization of commodities may distort price signals and contribute to persistent and significant bubbles (Boschi and Pieroni, 2009 ). The copper price then dramatically plummeted, mainly affected by substantial downward revisions in global growth forecasts as a result of the economic crisis; this price decline ultimately contributed to the bursting of the bubble. The last bubble appeared in January 2011 and collapsed in April. The copper price dramatically rose again to an almost-30-year-record high in February 2011, which exceeded the level reached in 2008. The sharp price surge is primarily attributed to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar and financialization of commodity markets. In early November 2010, the second round of quantitative easing policy led to the substantial depreciation of the U.S. dollar, providing enormous impetus for the international copper market to ascend to a price peak (Figuerola-Ferretti and Mccrorie, 2016) . Given that the U.S. interest rate was maintained at an extremely low level, large amounts of funds flowed into commodity markets, moving the prices of commodities including copper out of line with fundamentals (Baffes and Savescu, 2014) . Furthermore, as an alternative hedging instrument against the declining dollar, the copper market prominently attracted the participation of long-only commodity index investments. According to Humphreys (2010) , metals account for almost 12% of total holdings on the S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index and approximately 30% of total holdings on the Dow-Jones AIG Commodity Index. According to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, total investments in commodity index funds increased from only $8 billion in 2002 to almost $200 billion by the end of 2011. This unprecedented purchasing pressure from CITs is considered to greatly exacerbate the explosiveness of speculative bubbles (Mayer et al., 2017) . Meanwhile, metal commodities are increasingly utilized as collateral for financing to capture higher expected returns in importing countries (Buncic and Moretto, 2015) . In China, one of the world's largest consumers of copper, copper-based financing has become critical in the shadow-banking sector, mainly because of superior suitability of copper for storage and high value-to-bulk ratio (Tang and Zhu, 2016) . This continuously growing collateral demand for copper drastically pushed up its price, fostering the explosive bubble. With the subsequent aggravation of the European sovereign debt crisis, the international copper price dropped substantially due to slowing demand triggered by investors' negative expectations concerning the economic situation. Finally, the resulting bubble burst with the drastic recession in the global economy. Overall, we draw the following conclusions by summarizing the similarities among the episodes of explosive bubble behavior. First, four explosive bubble-type episodes in the international copper price have been confirmed, which is in accordance with the asset pricing model that indicates there exists expectation as well as invisible components in asset prices. Second, copper bubbles basically occur during periods of excess price volatility. Specifically, the formation of bubbles is typically accompanied by a drastic rise in price, and bubbles generally collapse when the copper price dramatically plummets. Third, the excessive copper price movements and resulting bubbles are partially attributable to the imbalance between supply and demand engendered by supply disruptions in key copper-producing countries and growing demand in developing countries, particularly in China. Fourth, the crucial role of nonfundamental factors, such as depreciation of the U.S. dollar and excessive speculation, has also been highlighted in explaining multiple bubble episodes of exuberance and collapse. Furthermore, the growing demand triggered by rapid industrialization and urbanization in emerging countries provides strong grounds for a massive surge in the copper price, given the basic commonality that bulk commodities tend to follow economic cycles. Nevertheless, bubbles are susceptible to collapse with the restoration of the copper price to the equilibrium trend in the short and medium run (Humphreys, 2010) . Supply disruptions are demonstrated to foster transient bubbles but have no long-run impact on copper price volatility, since the balance between demand and supply quickly resumes in the wake of the reactivations of idle capacity and new investments in the mining industry (Figuerola-Ferretti et al., 2015) . Turning to the financial perspective, the drastic price decline and speculative bubble collapse could be partly attributed to the global recessionary effect triggered by the economic crisis, proving an intensive integration between financial and commodity markets. It seems that the speculation component contributes to a longer-term bubble. The speculative boom with the expectation of a higher future copper price and U. S. dollar depreciation further facilitates an excessive price surge and aggravates explosive bubbles in the copper market (Shao et al., 2013) . Furthermore, the bubble component could be amplified by the considerable buying pressure from CITs and growing collateral demand for copper (Buncic and Moretto, 2015) . It is of great importance for policymakers to know the potential reasons behind the periodically collapsing behavior and adopt precautionary policies to forestall potential adverse consequences. To reduce excess price fluctuations and bubble episodes, authorities should prevent excessive speculation in copper markets through the formulation of trading restrictions as well as the supervision of long-only index investments in extreme cases.
