Proteins identified as differentially expressed in ATB and LTBI patients were validated using qPCR and western blotting. Among the 49 different proteins, four (XRCC4, PCF11, SEMA4A and ATP11A) were selected for further verification. The selection of the proteins for the verification stage was based on the following criteria: (1) high fold change; (2) being representative of the 49 different proteins; (3) P value of <0.05 in KEGG analysis (XRCC4 and PCF11) or having biological functions associated with immunity and other infectious diseases (SEMA4A and ATP11A). Although these four proteins were mainly distributed in cellular parts, their functions Most proteins different between the ATB and LTBI groups were related to binding, cellular and metabolic process and these four selected proteins were associated with these processes. Firstly, the four selected proteins all were also participate in the binding processes, including nucleic acid binding and protein binding. Additionally, XCRR4 and PCF11 had an effect on metabolic process while SEMA4A and ATP11A were related to the cellular process. Thus, these four proteins, being representative of the 49 different proteins, reflected the different status of MTB infection. At the mRNA level, the expression of XRCC4, PCF11and SEMA4A presented an increased trend in ATB group compare with that in LTBI and this agreed with the proteomic results. The ratio of ATP11A was apparently inconsistent with the proteomic data ( Figure 5A ). The mRNA result implies that regulation is occurring at the point of protein translation, not gene transcription. At the protein level, our results demonstrated that the plasma levels of XRCC4, PCF11, SEMA4A and ATP11A in the ATB group were significantly higher than the LTBI group (all P < 0.05; Figure 5B ). Representative western blots are shown in Figure 5C . These ratios were consistent with the trends of proteomics results. Total protein staining by Coomassie Blue employed as the loading control ( Figure 5D ).
