To check whether our results also hold in the secondary market, we collect listed prices for license plates from a secondary market seller. A caveat is that we only collect listed prices and not the actual transacted prices. 29 We managed to collect up to eight days of listed prices of car plates spanning from June 2002 to August 2009. 30 Altogether we have 16,001 plates with their listed prices across the eight days, 8195 (51%) of them are 4-digit ordinary plates and 7806 (49%) are ordinary 3-digit plates. 31 We estimate the same specifications as we have done in the previous sections. Table 9 gives the estimation results. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 9 illustrate that the results in Table 5 are robust. First, we continue to find that ''lucky" number ''8" carries a significant premium, while ''unlucky" number ''4" carries a significant discount. Controlling for other factors, an ordinary 4-digit plate with one extra ''8" was listed at 40.1% higher on average, while an extra ''4" was listed at 17.8% lower. The corresponding estimates for an ordinary 3-digit plate are 74.7% and 18.5%, respectively. Second, consistent with the results in Section 4.2.1, an ''8" commands a higher premium on a 3-digit plate than on a 4-digit plate. Similarly, a ''4" is discounted more in a 3-digit plate than in a 4-digit plate. 32 Columns 3-6 of Table 9 check whether the results in Section 4.2.2 are robust. The estimates suggest that after the introduction of personalized plate in 2006, the discount of a ''4" in both ordinary 3-digit and 4-digit plates drop. The premium on Note: Robust standard errors in brackets (clustered by date). -not applicable, no obs no observation. * p < 0:1. ** p < 0:05. *** p < 0:01. 26 The number ''16" rhymes similarly to ''all the way" (as an adverb); thus, ''168" rhymes similarly to ''prosper all the way". 27 Both ''861" and ''681" are not associated with any phrase that makes sense in Cantonese. However, ''186", ''618", and ''816" are all variations, in terms of what they mean, of ''road to prosperity". 28 Again, ''283", ''382", ''823", and ''832" do not rhyme similarly to any phrase that makes sense in Cantonese. 29 We rely on the seller's website as well as The Internet Archive (web.archive.org) to collect the data. We have contacted the seller to obtain more historical data and the transacted prices, but the seller refused to provide us with their transacted prices. 30 The eight days are June 2, 2002 , December 9, 2002 , August 5, 2003 , October 16, 2003 , February 20, 2004 , April 19, 2004 , August 5, 2004 , and August 25, 2009 Of the 16,290 listed prices we collected, surprisingly, 1.8% (or 289) of them are special plates. We deleted these plates because, as mentioned, it is by law not legal to transfer special plates. We therefore suspect that the prices involve not only the values of plates but also the service fees to help ''get around" with the non-transferable rule. 32 In another specification, we successfully match 1,299 ordinary 4-digit plates and 1892 ordinary 3-digit plates with the auction data (i.e., 20% of the data). We run the same specification as in Columns 1 and 2 of Table 9 , with the auction price as an extra control variable. Table 10 shows the estimation results. They suggest that controlling for all the variables, the past auction price of a plate continues to be a significant price determinant (statistically significant at the 1% level.) A higher auction price, everything else being equal, leads to a higher listed price in the second-hand market. However, there is still a significant premium on an ''8". For a ''4", the discount is statistically significant for ordinary 3-digit plates but not for 4-digit plates. an ''8" in ordinary 3-digit plates drops too. However, the premium on an ''8" in ordinary 4-digit plates is roughly the same across the two periods. Except for the premium on an ''8" in 4-digit plates, the results are consistent with those in Table 7 . 0.274 *** Section 4.2.3 argues that the introduction of personalized plate affects the premiums and discounts on numbers in ordinary 3-digit plates more than those in ordinary 4-digit plates, as personalized plates are more of the closer substitutes to ordinary 3-digit plates than to ordinary 4-digit ones. We continue to observe this in Table 9 . The change we look into is the premium on replacing a ''4" with an ''8" on a plate. On average, such number replacement adds 107.7% to the price of ordinary 3-digit plates before 2006 but only 52.6% after 2006, which is a percentage drop of 51.16%. The corresponding figures are 59.9% to the price of ordinary 4-digit plates before 2006 and 43.7% after 2006. The percentage drop was 27.05%. Ordinary 3digit plates respond to the introduction of personalized plates in a bigger magnitude compared with ordinary 4-digit plates. Columns 7 and 8 re-estimate specification (2) . For ordinary 3-digit plates, we continue to find that the people discount ''4" even more in bad times and value ''8" more in bad times. This is consistent with results in Section 4.2.4. We have the right sign of the estimated coefficients for ordinary 4-digit plates, but they are statistically insignificant. Overall, we find that the listed prices of secondary market plate sellers exhibit very similar statistical patterns compared with the auction data, which lends further support to our main results.
