The PCR products from the sewage samples of the two hospitals were sequenced, and submitted to GenBank. The accession numbers were: bankit579728 and bankit579738. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of PCR products with data from GenBank revealed that the sequences of PCR product were close to these of SARS-CoV genome, showing about 99% nucleotide homologue.
