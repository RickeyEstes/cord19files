In this study we report the in vitro antiviral activity of chloroquine against SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 strain infection. Cytotoxicity in Vero E6 cells was measured in parallel with the antiviral activity. This experiment, done in quadruplicate, was repeated three times, and representative results are shown in Fig. 1 . In the virus yield assay, where viral RNA was quantified one and three days postinfection, no significant replication was observed after one day when the cells were treated with 4 lM chloroquine. To inhibit virus replication by 99% three days postinfection, 16 lM chloroquine was needed (Fig. 2) . To obtain initial insight into the stage in the viral replication cycle at which chloroquine may exert its antiviral activity, a time-of-drug-addition assay was elaborated. Vero E6 cells were infected with 100 CCID 50 SARS-CoV. One virus replication cycle takes 5-6 h [26] . We therefore quantitated the effect on viral replication at 8 h postinfection, i.e., a time point at which progeny virus in the supernatant is solely derived from the first replication cycle. The compound proved equally active when added during adsorption or at 1 h after infection. This indicates that the virus does likely not interfere with the early steps of viral replication, i.e., attachment or penetration. At later time points a gradual loss of the antiviral activity of chloroquine was noted. (Fig. 3) . The IC 50 of chloroquine inhibition of SARS-CoV replication in Vero E6 cells, 8.8 lM, is below (1000-fold) the plasma concentrations of chloroquine that are reached in human plasma, following treatment with chloroquine (for acute malaria) at a dose of 25 mg/kg over three days [27] . The dose of chloroquine used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (3.6 mg/kg) generates plasma chloroquine concentrations of 1-3 lM, which is in the same concentration range as the IC 50 for inhibition of SARS-CoV [28] . Our results show that chloroquine inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells. Since immunopathological factors may play a significant role in SARS-CoV, it will be of interest to further study whether chloroquine is also effective in terms of modulation of inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV infections. Chloroquine is given prophylactically at a dose of 300 mg/week to people travelling to malaria endemic areas. If SARS re-emerges, chloroquine can be of great importance as prophylactic medication for people living in and travelling to the affected area. Chloroquine is ubiquitously available, of low cost, and easy to administer. It may be considered for immediate use in the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV infections.
