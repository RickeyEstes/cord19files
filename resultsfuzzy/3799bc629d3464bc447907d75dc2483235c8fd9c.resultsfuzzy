Empirical results of panel regression tests based on Eqs. 12-16 are summarized in Tables 4-8, respectively. Panel regression test results in Table 4 show that coefficients of DGDP and DTA are positive and statistically significant at the 10% and 5% level respectively, implying that DGDP and DTA have a significant impact on OPR. This is consistent with the correlation coefficient values reported in Table 1 that OPR is highly correlated with DGDP and DTA. The explanatory power (adjusted R 2 value) of DGDP and DTA on OPR is relatively high at about 45% (see panel B) and 53% (see panel C), respectively. These results indicate that DGDP and DTA are strong explanatory factors of OPR. The link between OPR and SIZE is found to be significantly positive, suggesting that tourist hotels with larger size enjoy higher occupancy rate. It is also found that the negative coefficients of the dummy variables of D911 and DSARS are statistically significant at the 1% level. Tables 5 and 6 , has a positive impact on ROA and ROE and its effect (the coefficient of DTA) is statistically significant at the 5% level. This supports the correlation coefficient values in Table 1 that both ROA and ROE are correlated with DTA. The overall explanatory power of DTA on ROA and ROE is also high at about 48% and 45% (see panel B in both tables), respectively. While DGDP exhibits a positive influence on both ROA and ROE, its influence is not statistically strong. In addition, SIZE is found to be negatively related to ROA and ROE. Among three dummy variables, only DSARS has a significantly negative impact on ROE.
