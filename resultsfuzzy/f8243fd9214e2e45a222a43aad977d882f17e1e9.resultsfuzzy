To determine a potentially conserved region in the H5N1 avian flu and H1N1 swine flu NA gene and protein sequences we proceeded initially from the 2D graphical representations of the various strains of the H5N1 and H1N1 NA which sequence segment seemed to be most strongly conserved, followed by confirmation by the RNA and protein descriptors. Next, we did a sliding window analysis along the NA body region to determine whether any other segment had comparable characteristics. Finally, we did a solvent accessibility analysis of the protein. From correlation of the results obtained from solvent accessibility analysis and sliding window method we could determine that the terminal segment was the best surface exposed conserved 16 amino acids long stretch which may be involved in significant biological functions; this is especially significant in view of the observation that truncation of the last 22 aa leads to loss of biological function of NA [48] . We followed this up with a detailed study of the crystallographic features to observe that indeed this segment of the NA protein is important for its stability. Our earlier work with the 2D graphical representation of 173 RNA sequences of the H5N1 NA had identified a 50-base segment at the 3' end of the sequence as being well conserved. NCBI-BLAST analysis had confirmed that this indeed was strongly conserved not only among the H5N1 NA but also among the NAs of influenza A subtypes H1N1, H3N1, H4N1, H6N1, H7N1, H9N1, H10N1, H11N1, and H12N1 [20] . In the current extended database of 514 H5N1 strains also we found from the graph radius descriptor g R that only 25 strains of the 50-base segment had any differences in the bases, i.e. 489 strains (95.14%) had this segment identical to one or the other of the 25 strains out of the 514 samples. Further, extension of the same study to samples from all nine antigenic subtypes (N1 to N9) showed considerable conserved characteristics for this protein region. A multiple alignment analysis (Table 1 ) of the last 20 amino acid residues (4 more residues are taken to facilitate the alignment process) of each subtype In comparison, in the transmembrane and stalk regions the percentage of variants, i.e. non-identical sequences, among the 514 H5N1 strains are 24.71% and 33.85%, respectively; the complete body region, i.e. from the end of the stalk to the end of the sequence, shows 75.5% variants, very high compared to the 4.86% of the 50-base 3'terminal region. As can be expected, a large number of the mutations responsible for the RNA sequence variations in this 50-base region are synonymous. A parallel study using the protein graphical representation and the protein graph radius descriptor, p R , shows that the number and percentage of variants of the corresponding protein sequence are 10% and 1.95%, respectively. We also analyzed the 425 strains of the H1N1 swine flu NA sequences to determine the degree of conservation in the 50-base segment at the 3'-end of the gene sequences and the 16 aa segment at the C-terminal end of the protein sequences. While the gene sequences are found to have mutated considerably compared to the earlier H1N1 and H5N1 strains, the mutations are all synonymous and the protein sequences are all identical with one another and to one of the dominant strains in the H5N1 sequences. Consequent to these observations regarding the stability of this segment, we considered their predicted secondary structures. Terminal structures of viral RNAs are found frequently to be involved in host dependent cellular processes including replication, transcription, viral particle packaging, by forming secondary structures like hairpin, double-hairpin, pan-handle etc [57] [58] [59] . Numerical characterization of the 514 NA RNA database have already summarized the database to 25 strains generating 25 unique numbers each representing unique structure of the 50 base RNA segment. Using these strains in RNA secondary structure prediction through mfold have yielded a double hairpin structure (Figure 1 ) in 21 cases with acceptable Î”G values showing strong stability characteristics. This kind of double hairpin structures are found to contribute in some biological functions like V(D)J recombination [60] , RNA editing [61] and viral RNA encapsidation [62] . This prediction for the RNA segment in H5N1 not only supports the observation of stability of this C-terminal region, but also designates the importance of that region in viral cell biology at RNA level. To determine whether the translation product of such a segment is unique in the H5N1 NA, we obtained the protein graph descriptor of an equivalent size moving along the entire body sequence. A 16-residue window was then used in our GSWM technique as described previously. To obviate problems and degeneracies occurring in the computation of the p R due to the absence of one or more residues in the 16-base stretch, we added a 20-residue peptide consisting of all 20 individual amino acids to the beginning of the window and thus had a 36-residue window for the GSWM technique: The first 20 aa remains constant for all computations and the last 16 residues varied depending on the sequence. Since we were interested in determining whether and which p R 's were equal between strains, and not on the magnitude of the p R 's, this artifice proved adequate for our purpose. Since the body region is composed of 379 aa, the GSWM gave us 379-15 = 364 p R values for each strain. Comparing the results positionwise between the 514 strains, we were able to determine at each position how many different p R were there, thus giving us a quantitative estimate of the variability in the 16-residue profile at each position for all the sequences (Figure 2) . Figure  3 and Additional file 1 show that in 6 regions (marked as A to F in Figure 2 ) along the NA protein body primary sequence the variability is significantly low. These are specifically at around residue position numbers 104 (point A in Figure 2 ), 177 (B), 277 (C), 334 (D) and 386 (E) with a comparative minimum also at window position 441 (F), which corresponds to the 50-base conserved region at the 3' end of the RNA sequence. All the 16 residue long amino acid segments other than the last region mentioned above seem better conserved than the C-terminal end segment. A potentially conserved portion in the protein needs to be solvent accessible for showing optimum interaction with its environment. However biological importance of a conserved peptide stretch increases many-fold as it becomes surface exposed or solvent accessible. Assuming that solvent accessibility may be indicative of accessibility of the site to potentially interacting portion of molecules, we next determined the solvent accessibility at each position of the sequence using SABLE secondary structure prediction server. Figure 2 (brown coloured plot) shows the results for a sample set of 20 strains used for the purpose. To make a comparison between the variability results obtained from the GSWM for the 16-residue window analysis of the 514 H5N1 NAs, we constructed a 16residue moving average of the solvent accessibility data. Figure 2 shows the plots of the two data sets -brown plot for the ASA and blue coloured plot for the GSWM results. A reasonably good correlation, 0.49 at 0.01 significance level, can be seen between the variability of the N1 strain protein sequences and solvent accessibility within the body region, though sequences included in stalk and transmembrane region do not show such a good correlation. We notice that regions of high solvent accessibility have high variability of the residues. This indicates that regions of the protein that are not accessible to the outside are more restricted in their mutations, whereas segments that are more easily accessible to outside influences can accommodate a greater degree of change implying that the interior of the protein is more stable, perhaps for structural reasons. This analysis shows that whatever individual hydrophobic or hydrophilic properties each residue may have, the co-operative effect of a stretch of peptides is quite important. The last segment of the protein sequence is slightly different from the other apparently stable segments identified hitherto. In this segment, as can be seen from Figure 2 , while the protein sequence variability is seen to decline, the solvent accessibility factor is seen to increase. Thus as we come closer to the last 16 residues, we find that this stretch is considerably solvent accessible, while at the same time being highly conserved. To understand this apparent divergence, we studied the crystallographic evidence of the structure of this region. Figure 3 and Additional file 1 show that this 16-residue C-terminal region of the protein sequence resides on the surface of the quaternary structure and appears to participate in the binding of one subunit of the quaternary structure to the next. It is therefore not surprising that this segment of the protein is quite well conserved for its structural stability, and it is at the same time accessible to the outside. According to recent structural biology research, a stretch of conserved surface residues or regions of a solvent accessible protein can be of significant biological importance in terms of enabling protein-protein binding [63] , allosteric regulation [64] , oligomerization [65] , signal peptides activity [43] etc. Thus any molecule that targets this conserved surface stretch can interfere with the protein's normal biological activity leading to the protein's malfunction. Recent pharmaceutical research frequently uses allosteric modulator [66] for designing drug molecules without side effects and toxic effects. In contrast, as can be seen from Additional file 1, the other five regions that would appear from Figure 2 to be highly conserved have a majority of the sequence in the interior of the protein and thus not as accessible to the environment. Here we propose that the conserved 16 aa region at the C-terminal end as determined by our analyses can be targeted to explore it's biological importance and consequent development of inhibitory molecules targeting this section for efficient control of viral infection.
