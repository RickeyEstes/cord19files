Loop dynamics: Structural evolution along the course of the cMD trajectory RMSD analysis from the 12-ns cMD trajectory was performed by fitting the backbone heavy atoms from the palm domain (Ser241-Lys307), excluding the two flexible loops (Gly267-Gly272 and Thr199-Glu204). The RMSD of the BL2 loop (Gly267- . The BL2 loop can sample the translational closed conformation around 4.5, 6, and 7.5 ns. The RMSD of the apo form of the protein with respect to the apo X-ray structure is shown in black, whereas the RMSD with respect to the bound X-ray structure is shown in red. (b) RMSD profile of 12 ns simulation for system II (started from the bound form of PLpro). The closed form of the loop can sample the open state around 5 and 10 ns. The RMSD profile of the bound form of the protein over the simulation with respect to the apo X-ray structure is shown in black, whereas the RMSD with respect to the GRL0617 ligand-bound X-ray structure is shown in red. Gly272) was then calculated with respect to that of the crystal structures. The RMSD profiles showed that the BL2 loop exhibits large picosecond-nanosecond flexibility. When started from the open form of the BL2 loop, the PLpro protein was able to translationally sample the closed form at a number of time points (∼ 4.5, 6, and 7.5 ns). Meanwhile, when the starting conformation of the BL2 loop was closed, the structure was able to translationally revert to the open form (∼ 5 and 10 ns). The analyses performed on both systems suggest that the BL2 loop preemptively samples both the open and the closed conformation in the absence of any ligand as seen in Fig. 2a and b .
