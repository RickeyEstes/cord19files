Determination of maximum non-toxic doses In order to assess any possible toxic effects of Ns, Ah and Cs extracts on HeLa CEACAM1a cells, serial dilutions (1/10, 1/50, 1/100, 1/1000, 1/10.000) of Ns, Ah and Cs extracts were incubated with HeLa CEACAM1a cells for 24 and 48 h. The cell viability was assessed by the tetrazolium salt 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. These three plant extracts showed toxic effect at 1/10 dilution, however toxicity of the extracts clearly decreased at 1/50 dilution for 24 and 48 h time points (Figs. 1, 2) . These results suggest that the cytotoxic effect of Table 1 The list of genes whose expression levels were measured by BioMark TM HD System real-time PCR   TRPA1  TRPC4  TRPC7  TRPM3  TRPM6  TRPV1  TRPV4  GAPDH   TRPC1  TRPC5  TRPM1  TRPM4  TRPM7  TRPV2  TRPV5   TRPC3  TRPC6  TRPM2  TRPM5  TRPM8  TRPV3 these plants extracts were concentration dependent but not time-dependent in that less cells were viable at 1/10 dilution compared to 1/50 dilution. Based on these results, the plant extract dilution of 1/50 was accepted as an active dose.
