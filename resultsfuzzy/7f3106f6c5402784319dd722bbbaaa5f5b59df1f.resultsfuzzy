Sequence identity and the phylogenetic tree Firstly, our analysis is directed to measure the primary protein sequence for every member. We obtain the percentage identity matrix of every pair of sequences ( Sequence characterization of PpcA and its homolog proteins PpcB-E: A mathematical approach exported from ClustalW. It is observed that sequences are at least 47% similar. The maximum similarity is 76% which is found between PpcA and PpcB. If we consider the PpcA sequence which shows the minimum of 50% similarity with PpcE and the maximum of 76% similarity with PpcB, we are not able to differentiate the PpcA from other homologs on using the similarity percentage. Secondly, we count rate of occurrence (frequancy of amino acids) of every individual amino acid of the respective five sequences which are shown in Table 3 . Then, we look for chemical group specific frequency for every sequence shown in Table 4 using Eq (3). Now, we obtain the dissimilarity score of all possible two sequences (using Eq (4)). Say for an example, we compare the Seq. no. 1 and Seq. no. 2, we get the difference for Acidic group is 2.1978 (10.9890-8.7912), Basic group is 4.3956 (27.4725-23.0769) and so on (from Table 4 ). Total score after summing the eight groups is 17.5824 which measures the dissimilarity percentage of the said two sequences. Similar results we get for all other pairs which are shown in Table 5 . This table shows the biological distances between each pair of sequences. From this pair wise distance matrix, the phylogenetic tree is constructed as shown in Fig 1, also discussed in method Section. Based on the phylogenetic tree of five members, we find that the PpcA and PpcD, PpcB and PpcE are mostly closed with regards to the frequency of amino acids of respective eight chemical groups. From Fig 1 it is not obvious that PpcA differs from other homologs, but if we go through the dissimilarity matrix (Table 5) , we find some variations. Here, it is observed that PpcA differs by minimum of 16.5313% with PpcD, whereas for other homologs minimum dissimilarity Sequence characterization of PpcA and its homolog proteins PpcB-E: A mathematical approach is found for PpcD with PpcC which is 11.8535%. Therefore among all the pairs, the high dissimilarity of PpcA shows its uniqueness compared to its homologs. If we have a closer look into the list of amino acids, it is observed that the amino acids D, E, H, K, F, I, L, V, A, G, P, M, C, T are present among all the sequences. Other amino acids are not common to all the member sequences. Therefore, on the basis of chemical groups, all the amino acids from Acidic, Aliphatic, Cyclic and Hydroxyl containing groups are present. It is observed that the Acidic, Basic and Hydroxyl containing groups percentage distinctly differ while compared PpcA with other homologs. Further, it is observed that only one Proline(P) from Cyclic group is present in PpcD while in other homologs, Proline (P) is present at least 3 times. And another important observation is that the amino acid Tryptophan (W) from Aromatic group is present only in PpcD sequence.
