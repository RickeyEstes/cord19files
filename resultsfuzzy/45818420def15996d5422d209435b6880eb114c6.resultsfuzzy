Research Question 1 asked which type of rumor would have a higher level of rumor beliefs and intention to disseminate rumor. As shown in Table 1 , independent samples t-tests indicated that, while rumor beliefs and intention to disseminate rumor were greater in the wedge rumor condition than in the bogie condition, the difference did not reach statistical significance of p < .05. Research Question 2 asked which rumor response strategies -refutation, denial, attack -would result in greater reduction of rumor beliefs and intention to disseminate rumor. To answer this question, a total of six sets of paired sample t-tests were performed for two dependent variables and for three rumor response strategies respectively. The two dependent variables were constructed by abstracting pre-measures of rumor beliefs and intention to disseminate rumor from the corresponding post-measures. As shown in Table 2 , results indicate that all three rumor responses significantly reduced rumor beliefs (for refutation, denial, and attack response strategies, mean diff . 52, .45, .47, t = 8.41, 7.74, 7 .97, all p < .001). However, only the refutation strategy condition significantly reduced intention to disseminate rumor (Table 3 : mean diff = .21, t = 4.24, p < .001). Research Question 3 was about interaction effects of type of rumor and type of response strategy on reduction of rumor beliefs and intention to disseminate rumor. To explore this question, we performed two sets of two-way ANCOVA with two factors (type of rumor, type of response strategy) and two dependent variables (reduction of rumor beliefs and intention to disseminate rumor). Rumor awareness (or prior knowledge about the rumor) was included in the model as a covariate because previous research has found that it has effects on rumor beliefs and dissemination intention (Kwon & Cho, 2017) . As shown in Table 4 , although no interaction effects of rumor type and rumor response strategy were found, there were some noteworthy main effects. Specifically, both rumor type (F (1, 935) = 7.70, p = .006, partial eta-squared = .008) and government response strategy (F (2, 935) = 4.775, p = .009, partial eta-squared = .010) had main effects on pre-post difference of intention to disseminate rumor. Pairwise comparison tests show that intention to disseminate rumor was significantly more reduced in the bogie condition than in the wedge condition (mean diff = .143, p = .006). In addition, intention to disseminate rumor was significantly more reduced in the refutation than in either the denial condition (mean diff =.144, p = .022) or the attack condition (mean diff =.185, p = .003). However, neither main nor interaction effects were found on pre-post difference in rumor beliefs. Note. a > b, p < .05. H.-J. Paek and T. Hove Public Relations Review 45 (2019) 101762
