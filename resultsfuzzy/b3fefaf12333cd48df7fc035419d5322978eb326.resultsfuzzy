Although the model is at an early stage of development, preliminary studies have already produced encouraging results. Primarily, the simulation has been able to reproduce prevalence patterns observed at Ninewells Hospital (Ward 11) during different time intervals. The current version of the model was validated by using graphical methods, analysis of coefficients of determination, and analysis of incidence and prevalence. The Simulation Type 1 was used to study infection spread under well-defined conditions and to compare the model outputs with the data collected over an overall period of 22 weeks (01.02.07-02.03.07, 02.04.07-01.05.07, and 01.06.07-29.08.07). Fig. 1 shows three curves referring to the time interval between 01.02.07 and 01.05.07; two curves (dotted and solid lines) are associated with the data collected in Ward 11, the third curve (dashed line) relates to the simulation results. The error bars associated with the last curve refer to the sample standard deviations (s)-note that the standard error of the mean (SEM) is related with s through the formula SEM = s/ âˆš N, where N is the number of simulation runs. Two different scenarios were considered. In the first scenario (dotted line), the infection spread was not taken into account and, for each day, only the positive patients who were already positive on admission were counted. In the second scenario (solid line), on the other hand, the time series includes all the positive cases-the positive patients who were already positive on admission and those who were newly identified as positive during their stay in the ward. By increasing the transmission probability tp, the simulation curve (dashed line) moves gradually from the first to the second scenario. For most of the time periods under investigation (14 weeks over 22), the best fit between simulation and observational data was achieved for tp = 0.13; for these cases, high values of coefficient of determination were obtained (R 2 > 0.9). It is worth highlighting that some of the values used for the simulation parameters depend on the assumptions of the current version of the model. Future versions, that will include a better description of the agent dynamics and the indirect transmission from patient to patient via environmental surfaces, might require different values for these parameters.
