In this section, the effectiveness of vaccination strategies on various network topologies is investigated for a given set of parameters, which are identical for all the simulations. The values of the disease parameters are chosen based on what is known from influenza H1N1/09. Qualitatively, these chosen parameters should provide substantial insight into the effects topology has on the spread of a disease. Unless indicated otherwise the parameter values listed in Table 4 are used. The effects of the vaccination strategies summarized in Table 3 when applied without delay are shown in Fig. 3 . For reference, Fig. 1 shows the incidence curves with no vaccination. Since the disease dies out in the small world network (see Fig. 1 ), vaccination is not needed in this network for the parameter values taken. Especially in the cases of the random and meta-random networks, the effects of vaccination are drastic while for the scale-free network they are still considerable. What is particularly notable is that when comparing the various outcomes, topology has as great if not a greater impact on the epidemic than the vaccination strategy. Besides the incidence curves, the final sizes of epidemics and the effect vaccination has on these are also of great importance. Table 5 shows the final sizes and the reductions in the final sizes for the various networks on which the disease can survive (for the chosen parameter values) with vaccination strategies for the cases where there is no delay in the vaccination. Fig. 4 and Table 6 show the incidence curves and the reductions in final sizes for the same parameters as used in Fig. 3 and Table 5 but with a delay of 40 days in the vaccination. As can be expected for the given parameters, a delay has the biggest effect for the scale-free network. In that case, the epidemic is already past its peak and vaccinations only have a minor effect. For the random and meta-random networks, the Table 3 Illustration of vaccination strategies. Susceptible nodes are depicted by triangles, infectious nodes by squares, and the vaccinated nodes by circles. The average degree in these illustrations has been reduced to aid clarity. The starting point for contact tracing is labeled as A while the starting point for the follow links strategy is labeled as B. The number of doses dispensed in this illustration is 3. We line up incidence curves on various network topologies to a growth rate l predicted by a homogeneous mixing SIR model with the basic reproduction number R 0 ¼ 1:5 and recovery rate g ¼ 0:2 (in this case with exponential, l ¼ ðR 0 À1Þg ¼ 0:1). Table 7 summarizes the transmission rates that yield this exponential growth rate on the corresponding network topologies. The initial number of infectious individuals for models on each network topology needs to be adjusted as well so that the curves line up along the homogeneous mixing SIR incidence curve for 25 days. As can be seen from the table, the variations in the parameters are indeed very large, with the transmission rate for the small world network being nearly 8 times the value of the transmission rate for the scale-free network.
