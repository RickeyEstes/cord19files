Ten cats received a full course at 2mg/kg and two other cats began at 2mg/kg then were increased to 4mg/kg. Eight of ten cats stopped shedding FCoV using Mutian X tablets at a dose of 2mg/kg SID ( Fig. 2A) for seven or four days. Two probable FCoV carrier cats (C1 and C2) that had shed virus at levels of C T 18-20 (C1) and C T 35 (C2) for over a year prior to treatment; were treated for 7 days at a dose of 2mg/kg after which their faeces were negative, C1 and C2 remained negative when tested five and seven days later. The remaining 8 cats were treated for four days as shown in Fig. 2A and Table 2 . Daily samples were available for five cats; two (C3 and C5) cleared the virus within 24 hours and three under 72 hours (C4, C6 and C7). The other cats were not tested daily, so an accurate time of cessation of virus shedding could not be determined. Cats C8 and C10 failed to totally clear the virus using the 2mg/kg dose for 4 days; therefore they were treated again at 4mg/kg, after which they became negative, as shown in Fig. 2B and Table 2 . Cat C6 was in the same group as C8 and C10, and began shedding virus again within 9 days, requiring a second course of treatment (Figs. 2A and 2B). Two more cats (E1 and E2) started treatment at 2mg/kg SID but were changed to the higher dose within 48 hours due to the results from Household C (Fig. 3 ): these cats were therefore included in the 4mg/kg rather than the 2mg/kg category. In summary, a Mutian X dose of 2mg/kg was considered inadequate: it had cleared the virus in eight cats and reduced, but not abrogated, virus shedding in two cats ( Fig. 2A) . Thereafter, the dose was increased to 4mg/kg. A dose of 4mg/kg reliably cleared virus within seven days in 21 of 22 (95%) cats (two cats from Household A, one from Household B, 10 of 11 from Household C and 8 from Household E) (Figs.2B and 3). Cat C18 was the only cat who failed to clear the virus after a six day course of 4mg/kg dose, but she vomited some of the capsules and she required a repeat course for three more days after which she was negative.
