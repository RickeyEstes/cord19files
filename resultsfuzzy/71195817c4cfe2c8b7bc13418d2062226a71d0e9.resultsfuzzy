Subnational stakeholders, roles, mobilisation, and network properties In Garissa County, 20 stakeholder organisations or groups relevant to OH included public and private service providers, livestock keeping community who were pastoralists with linked institutions, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), United Nations technical agencies, traders, and three programmes/projects ( Fig. 2 ; subnational component). In this study, we classified a stakeholder as an NGO if it was non-profit, funded by donors to support animal or public health except research and were not linked to any government or United Nations. Pastoralists perceived their roles as that of reporting animal disease outbreaks, treatment of sick animals, seeking public health care, and compliance with control or risk reduction measures. The District Veterinary Officers (DVOs) and their teams described their role as that of implementing animal health prevention and control measures. District Medical Officers (DMOs) described their role as that of coordinating delivery of public health services through a network of health facilities. Respondents consistently pointed to inadequate capacities of the DVOs, DMOs and pastoralists to effectively play their respective roles. Main barriers to effective roles mentioned by the stakeholders included inadequate government funding, personnel and other logistics, unfavourable animal health policies, weak interface between pastoralists and service providers, pastoralists' knowledge capacity, increased vulnerability to shocks, and low incentives for livestock keepers to report animal diseases. They attributed the low incentives to difficulties in accessing the veterinary services. They described public health services as generally inadequate but more accessible compared to animal health services. The other subnational stakeholders described their roles as provision of information and resources to public animal and public health sectors (DVOs and DMOs) and communities in addition to direct implementation of complementary activities to improve health. Subnational network sociogram (Fig. 3 ) demonstrates how the different stakeholders related. The computed overall binary network density was 0.21, which implied that only 21% of the possible ties were present. The sociogram is dense around the public health stakeholders and less dense around animal health stakeholders. Two livestock stakeholders (FAO and milk traders) had no relationships with the rest of the stakeholders, while DVO and the local wildlife office had no link. Only two coordination platforms enhanced cooperation amongst sectors and stakeholders. These included 1) a multisectoral district steering group (DSG) supported by a donor-funded cross-sectoral development project: the Arid Lands Resource Management Project (ALRMP). The DSG had established a public health subgroup (HSG); 2) Public health stakeholder forums at all levels of health facilities. Health facilities had established health committees at community level. The DSG comprised of all district public sector heads, NGOs, and private sector organisations. Its main function was coordination of development activities including response to multisectoral emergencies such as RVF outbreaks. The ALRMP's drought monitoring or early warning officers collected household and community-level information that included disease status in animals and people. The local office of World Health Organization (WHO) analysed the public health information to share with local public health heads. Joint public and animal health activities were rare. The HSG coordinated only public health issues, though DVOs were invited to the meetings. The community-based public health facility committees brought together community leaders, community health workers (CHWs), and health officers for the purposes of enhancing community participation in health management and disease reporting. The public health platforms provided opportunities for private sector to engage and support public health services. There were more public health actors (including NGOs) compared to livestock or animal health. Livestock and animal health stakeholders had no sectoral collaboration platforms amongst themselves, with livestock keepers and public health sectors. The degree centrality measures (Table 1 ) of the subnational network agree with the description of the collaborations mentioned above. The public health actors, ALRMP, and the community had more relationships and more pairs (Table 1 , column 3, figures in brackets). Between-ness centrality measures of 239 (in) and 32 (out) identified the ALRMP as the actor who linked clusters, acted as broker, and has highest power within the network. This was attributed to the DSG and HSG collaboration platforms and the fact that the project was addressing issues in multiple sectors. Other stakeholders who linked clusters included the DVOs, community, WHO, and the Ministry of Health (MOH). Also, the ALRMP emerged as the actor demonstrating the highest in and out closeness at 23 and 29, respectively, followed by the MOH (22, 29) , WHO (21, 27) , and other human health NGOs (21, 26) . For the same network, degree centrality measures confirm that the public health actors, ALRMP and the community, had more ties compared to livestock/animal health actors. The MOH had strong linkages to other public health stakeholders, ALRMP and the community, while the DVO had weak linkages with very few actors in the livestock or animal health sector. National-level stakeholders, roles, mobilisation activities, and network properties A total of 32 international, regional, and national public and private sector organisations relevant to RVF and OH issues were identified at national level (Fig. 2) . They can be grouped into four sectors: livestock, wildlife, public health, and environment (climate prediction agencies). Majority (21; 65%) were national organisations, of which 11 addressed animal health, 9 concerned public health, and 1 (the Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD)) worked on climate prediction issues. Eleven representing a third were international or regional organisations, based in Nairobi. Activities of the national organisations included regulation and policy setting, delivery of services, academic, research, training, and regulatory and professional organisations. The DVS, the two MOH, and Kenya Wildlife Services were the lead agencies (mandate provision described in law) in livestock health, public health, and wildlife RVF-related OH issues, respectively. On the other hand, the roles of the international and regional organisations included 1) financial and technical support to the national organisations, 2) regional coordination of respective health activities through donor-funded sectoral or cross-sectoral initiatives, networks, and projects. Current and past initiatives towards mobilisation, alliance building, social acceptance, and institutionalisation of OH at national level are summarised in Fig. 4 . Three zoonotic diseases (rabies, RVF, and HPAI) drove the initiatives. The process was triggered by the formation of a When the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) predicted the next RVF epidemic in 2006/ 2007, the group technically supported multisectoral response efforts and had continued to do so in the postepidemic period. The 15-year plus continuity of the group was largely attributed to both support by CDC (showing that institutional support is critical) and increased prioritisation of RVF in the country. Formal process to institutionalise OH begun with a HPAI multisectoral taskforce formed in late 2005 after recommendations from FAO and WHO. Through the taskforce, technical heads of veterinary and medical services mobilised and built alliances with many OH stakeholder organisations in preparation for an influenza pandemic. However, in 2007, an RVF epidemic occurred and the multisectoral taskforce and RVF-SWG joined hands to support and coordinate the response. In 2010, noting usefulness of the HPAI taskforce in zoonoses control, policy makers transformed the taskforce into a Zoonotic Technical Working Group (ZTWG) and established a joint animal and public health Zoonotic Disease Unit (ZDU) in 2012. The institutionalisation activities have been largely funded by Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and line ministries. The period also coincided with the FAO/OIE/WHO calls for national OH platforms. By mid-2014, ZTWG and ZDU had identified priority zoonoses; developed a 5-year strategic plan; updated RVF's contingency plan; implemented joint zoonoses surveys and investigations; and were developing OH strategies for rabies and brucellosis. Two policies guided animal and public health Á a draft Veterinary Policy and the Kenya Public Health Policy 2012Á2030. The draft Veterinary Policy explicitly had a policy statement mentioning that the two health sectors will establish cooperation platforms. On the other hand, the Kenya Public Health Policy 2012Á2030 adopted a wider policy objective of strengthening collaboration with other sectors that impact on health. In 2010, the ZTWG membership was drawn from 17 (53%) out of the 32 identified national stakeholders of which 35% had roles in public health, 29% in livestock, 12% in wildlife health, and 24% in cross-sectoral thematic areas. Missing stakeholder groups included: private sector service providers, NGOs, donors, regulatory and professional associations. Disciplinary orientation of ZTWG showed dominance (of 74%) by medical or veterinary epidemiologists and public health experts, making it a multidisciplinary team of two disciplines (veterinary and medical health professionals). Among the regional and international organisations, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of The United Nations (FAO), CDC, International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), and WHO supported the ZDU and ZTWG and also engaged in regional coordination of OH. The African Union-Interafrican Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR) implemented OH-related projects and was in the process of establishing a regional coordination mechanism. The two centres of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development's (IGAD) Á Climate Predictions and Applications Centre (ICPAC) and Centre for Pastoral and Livestock Development (ICPALD) mostly provided livestock early warning and climate data. The NASA's Goddard Space Flight Centre is a key information source for RVF. They had predicted the 2006Á2007 outbreaks 1Á2 months prior to the first human cases (31). Regional networks to which the international or regional organisations belonged were noted as they either are or will provide an opportunity to link the national networks to regional and global initiatives. Two main global networks were 1) the FAO, OIE and WHO's Global Early Warning System (GLEWS) for major animal diseases and 2) the FAO and OIE's (plus AU-IBAR in Africa) Global framework for the progressive control of transboundary animal diseases (GF-TADs). Regional networks mentioned by stakeholders included: 1. Nairobi-based multisectoral Interagency Working Group (IAWG) on disaster preparedness, which had previously established on ad hoc basis multisectoral subgroups addressing avian influenza and RVF. 2. Nine regional networks supported by the international, regional stakeholders as well as donors that include the Cysticercosis Working Group for Eastern and Southern Africa (CWGESA). National-level sociogram (Fig. 5) shows how the national, regional, and international stakeholders based in Nairobi are related. Computed overall binary network density was 0.35 showing that only 35% of the possible relationships existed. The overall clustering coefficient was estimated at 0.56 showing fairly dense local neighbourhoods. Seven stakeholder organisations or groups Á CDC, FAO, AU-IBAR, OIE, universities, NGOs, and International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) Á had cluster coefficients that ranged from 0.51 to 0.95 (Table 2 ). This means that they had achieved more than 50% of possible ties in the neighbourhood, attributed to their networks and mandates in OH as well as their resources endowments from donors. The DVS had the highest out and in ties followed closely by MOH, FAO, CDC, ILRI, and AU-IBAR, while NGOs (whose activities are mostly communitybased) were one of those with least ties. The sum of geodesic distances from the other actors (in farness) within the network had less variability except for KMD. The values of actor between-ness of DVS, WHO, ILRI, MOH, and CDC imply that more actors depended on them to make connections with others placing them in a powerful position.
