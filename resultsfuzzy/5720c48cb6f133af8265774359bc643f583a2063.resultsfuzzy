3.1. Distribution characteristics of the residues of cGKIa 1 À 59 and MBS CT35 in the wenxiang diagrams In previous studies, we have used programs COILS (Lupas, et al., 1991) to predict the coiled-coil region in cGKIa 1À 59 domain, which is from the residue L12 through residue H53. This result has been confirmed by the analysis of our NMR relaxation data and RDC data (Schnell et al., 2005) . This domain contains a repeating pattern of amino acids a, b, c, d, e, f, and g (Fig. 3A) . Thus, the monomer structure of cGKIa 1À 59 could be characterized by a wenxiang diagram. Where each residue of the denoted repeating amino acids (abcdefg) n in Fig. 3B is represented by a circle and repeated letters a, b, c, d, e, f, and g, respectively. It is clearly shown with the wenxiang diagram that the residues with same letters are laid on same side of the spiral diagram, and most hydrophobic residues are positioned on a/d region except Lysine 15 and 29 (Fig. 3B) . Because a LZ domain must be a typical amphiphilic helix, i.e., part of the helix flank is dominated by hydrophobic residues and the other part by hydrophilic residues, their inclination angles are all very close to 01, which is fully consistent with the requirement of minimum free energy in a amphiphilic helical system (Hartshorne, 1997) . It has been suggested that a critical region responsible for interacting with cGKIa 1À 59 is another LZ coiled-coil domain, which is located within the C-terminal 100 amino acids (residues 930-1030) of the MBS (Baker et al., 2005; Lincoln, 1994) . This region has been further confirmed to be MBS CT42 , the C-terminal 42 amino acids (residues 929-970) of the MBS protein by our NMR data (Sharma et al., 2008) . Actually, according to our pair coil analysis, the LZCC domain with the highest probability (1.0) should be the C-terminal 35 amino acids of the MBS (MBS CT35 ), which contains a repeating pattern of amino acids a, b, c, d, e, f, and g from residues 936 to 970 (Fig. 4A) . Because all residues of MBS CT35 are included in MBS CT42 domain, the interaction between it and cGKIa 1À 59 has been confirmed by our biochemical and NMR data (Lincoln., 1994) . According to this information, we obtained a wenxiang diagram of the monomer of MBS CT35 , where all residues with same letter are also distributed on the same side of the spiral wenxiang diagram (Fig. 4B ). It can be seen from both Figs. 3 and 4B and that most nonpolar residues are localized on the hydrophobic a/d regions. According to the calculated results for a number of proteins, the inclination angles for most helices therein are small (9O9o251). This suggests that driven by the free energy an amphiphilic helix will tend to seek its own arrangement in a protein such that approximately half of its face is buried in the protein, whereas the other half is exposed to the aqueous environment that surrounds the protein (Hartshorne, 1997) . Thus, a coiled-coil dimmer structure can be further expressed by a combination of two identical twodimensional wenxiang diagrams. The ensemble principle of such wenxiang diagram should observe the following rule: a/d region of one monomer wenxiang diagram must be faced to the a/d region of another identical monomer wenxiang diagram. Because most hydrophobic residues are localized at the a/d positions, the approach to each other between the two monomer's a/d regions should be helpful for the formation of a stable coiled-coil dimmer structure due to the hydrophobic interactions of the nonpolar residues between the two a/d regions. According to such an ensemble rule, the wenxiang diagrams of the cGKIa 1À 59 dimmer were assembled in Fig. 5A . Where most hydrophobic side chains of leucine and isoleucine in positions a and d, and two side chains of lysine (K15 and K29) in position d should be clearly displayed on the nearest neighbor region between the two wenxiang diagrams. This observation has been verified by our 3D structure of cGKIa 1À 59 (Fig. 6 ) based on the previous NMR experimental data (Surks and Mendelsohn, 2003) . As shown in Fig diagrams of MBS CT35 LZCC structure. In Fig. 5A , although the seven apolar residues (M13, L14, Y46, P48, V49, G55, and P56) of cGKIa 1 À 59 localize the outside of the a/d position region, most of them are still close to the a/d region except residues M13 and L14. However, for the wenxiang diagrams of MBS CT35 , an interesting feature is that most apolar residues of outside the hydrophobic a/d position region such as 941 A, 948 A, 955 M and 962 L are located at position f (where usually are occupied by the hydrophilic residues) and are little far away from the hydrophobic a/d position region (Fig. 5B ). These differences between Figs. 5A and B suggest that the either hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions between cGKIa 1 À 59 and MBS CT35 may be weaker due to the lack of the contributions of the more apolar residues near the a/d position region of MBS CT35 , or lack of the contributions of polar residues from g, b, c, and e positions of cGKIa 1 À 59 This may explain why the molar ratio of the interaction between MBS CT42 and cGKIa 1 À 59 has to be 2:1 (Lincoln, 1994) . 3.2. Analysis of the interaction between cGKIa 1 À 59 and MBS CT35 incorporating wenxiang diagrams and NMR data In order to determine whether an interaction exists between cGKIa 1 À 59 and MBS CT42 , Figs. 5A and B were combined to form the wenxiang diagrams of a hexamer complex structure according to the molar ratio of cGKIa 1 À 59 and MBS CT35 (1:2) (Fig. 7) . The ensemble of these combined wenxiang diagrams should be reasonable. Because most hydrophobic residues (position a/d regions, or nearby a/d regions) are buried inside the bundle and most hydrophilic residues are exposed to the aqueous environment that surrounds the cGKIa 1À 59 ÁMBS CT42 hexamer complex. As shown in Fig. 7 . The wenxiang diagrams of the hexamer complex structure of cGKIa 1 À 59 (middle pair diagrams) and two MBS CT35 (the topper and lower pair diagrams). Where, the a-e region of one molecule is close to the d-g region of another molecule. 970R) at position g of MBS CT35 are also polar residues. According to the previous studies (Adamian and Liang, 2002) , the salt bridge residue pairs of E-R may be formed between E16, E23, or E30 of cGKIa 1À 59 and 970R of MBS CT35 , and the salt bridge residue pairs of R-E may be formed between R37 of cGKIa 1À 59 and 942E or 956E of MBS CT35 . These salt bridges have high propensity for the interhelical polar-polar atomic contacts. In addition, other ionizable-polar residue pairs such as Q-R or R-Q (Q44-970R, or R37-949Q, or R37-963Q), and S-R (S51-970R) between cGKIa 1À 59 and MBS CT35 may also have high propensity to form the interhelical polar-polar interactions (Adamian, and Liang, 2002) , Similarly, the all residues (R18, R25, E32, K39, and H53) at position g of cGKIa 1À 59 are all polar residues, and most residues (947K, 954N, 961K, and 968T) at position e of MBS CT35 are also polar residues. The ionzable-polar residue pairs such as R-N (R18-954N), or K-N (K39-954N), or H-T (H53-968T) between cGKIa 1À 59 and MBS CT35 may also be formed to contribute the interhelical polar-polar interactions. Such ensemble of the wenxiang diagrams suggests that most affected residues of cGKIa 1 À 59 and MBS CT35 might be at positions d, a, e and g of these two LZCC structures. This prediction has been supported by the previous NMR data (Lincoln, 1994; Sharma et al., 2008) . NMR spectroscopy is the preferred method for characterizing the structural details of protein-protein and protein-ligand interaction interfaces following complex formation in an aqueous environment (Chou et al., 1997) . Our 15 N-1 H-HSQC titration data in which unlabeled MBS CT42 (not observable by 15 N-1 H-HSQC experiment) was titrated into 2 H/ 13 C/ 15 N-labeled cGKIa 1À 59 support an interaction between cGKIa 1À 59 and MBS CT42 , which is illustrated by the changes in chemical shifts of the 5 residues (Leu 36 , Lys 37 , Leu 40 , Ile 54 , and Gly 55 ) as well as a significant decrease in peak intensity of the 8 residues (Leu 22 , Ile 33 , Leu 36 , Lys 37 , Lys 39 , Leu 40 , Cys 43 , and Gln 44 ) of cGKIa 1À 59 (Lincoln, 1994) . Taken together, these data identify that these 10 residues (Leu22, Ile 33, Leu36, Lys37, Lys 39, Leu40, Cys43, Gln44, Ile54, and Gly55) of cGKIa 1À 59 are most affected by the interaction with MBS CT42 (Lincoln, 1994) . The seven residues of them are hydrophobic and only three for hydrophilic residues (Lys 37, Lys 39 and Gln44). Among these 10 residues, the three residues (I33, L40 and I54) at position a, the three residues (L22, L36 and C43) at position d, the two residues (K37 and Q44) at position e, the one residue (K39) at the position g, and the one residue (G55) at position b of cGKIa 1À 59 are most affected residues by the interaction with MBS CT42 (Lincoln, 1994) . Thus, the previous NMR experimental data have supported above prediction based on above combined wensiang diagrams that most affected residues of cGKIa 1À 59 by the interaction with MBS CT35 might be at positions d, a, e and g of these two LZCC structures. In addition, the residues which are localized at positions c and f (particularly for f) region of cGKIa 1 À 59 , are far away from the all position regions of MBS CT35 according to the wenxiang diagrams of cGKIa 1 À 59. ÁMBS CT35 complex. This means that most residues at position c and f regions are more exposed the outer of the complex, or exposed to the aqueous environment that surrounds the protein complex. These results suggest that the interactions between cGKIa 1 À 59 and MBS CT35 come from the contribution of their hydrophobic residues at positions a and d, as well as the hydrophilic residues at position g. Interestingly, these residues are localized on the same side of the helix or close to each other in the wenxiang diagram (Fig. 7) . These characteristics further support our previous suggestion that these 10 residues are reasonably either within close proximity to and/or involved in the formation of the interaction interface (Lincoln, 1994) . Based on similar data obtained in studies of F-actin interacting with skeletal myosin light chain 1 and ubiquitin hydrolase interacting with its native substrate, it is likely that these residues are within the interaction interface between these proteins although additional experiments evaluating the on/off rate of the interaction may are necessary (Naik et al., 2001; Sakamoto et al., 2005; Hutchings et al., 2003) . As has been previously identified for the GCN4 LZ, upon tetramer formation (pairing of two dimers) there is an increase in packing density within the intermolecular interface, which results in additional perturbation of residues within the a, d, e, b and g positions that is unlike the typical packing of the a and d side chains of isolated helices (Harbury et al., 1994) . Interestingly several of the residues of cGKIa 1À 59 that are conformationally perturbed following the addition of MBS are within a, d, e, g and b positions of the repeating heptads layer (Fig. 7) . In addition, the previous studies about the GCN4 tetramer LZ, an isoleucine zipper trimer of GCN4, the asialoglycoprotein receptor heterotetramer, and an extensive study of Crick's knobs-into-holes packing for 3-, 4-and 5-stranded structures have provided additional geometric, conformational packing information for generating this model (Harbury et al., 1993; 1994; 1995; Walshaw and Woolfson, 2003) . Moreover, in the crystal structure of the GCN4 trimer and tetramer the authors observe significant packing and numerous interactions between residues in the a/d hydrophobic interface and the hydrophilic residues at positions e and g, which and our cGKIa 1À 59. ÁMBS CT42 complex wenxiang diagrams may be consistent and helpful for a better understanding the packing mechanism that present between the cGKIa 1À 59 LZCC domain and MBS CT42 LZCC motif.
