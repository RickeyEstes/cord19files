The Ct values were recorded for each gene expression assayed in real-time PCR. All the Ct values are mean of triplicate samples tested. At least three independent samples were tested on each occasion. The Ct values indicate the difference in the Ct values between the target gene and the endogenous gene. The Ct value indicates the difference between the Ct of sample and the Ct of calibrator. The calibrator has been chosen as the SLAM expression in untransfected B95a cell line. The folds change in the gene expression is calculated as 2 âˆ’ Ct. Correlation coefficients were calculated between these folds changes using MS Excel package.
