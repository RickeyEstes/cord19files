Characterization of SARS-CoV spike protein Viral proteins from purified viral particles were separated on 9% SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie blue (Fig. 1) . The proteins S, M and N were detected but the gel was not dense enough to detect the smaller (7 kDa) E protein. Western blotting using the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein antibody (Imgenex) confirmed the identity and molecular weight (180 kDa) of the S protein which was consistent with earlier reports (Krokhin et al., 2003; Song et al., 2004; Xiao et al., 2003) and indicated the presence of the fully modified glycoprotein. There was no apparent difference in molecular weight between the glycoproteins produced with and without NB-DNJ.
