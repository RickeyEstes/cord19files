Computational results for each case are presented in the form of color contour plots showing pollution distribution and vector plot. They show the probable path of contamination released from the patient and the air flow distribution in AIIR. Fig. 5 shows concentration distribution patterns at a 1.4 m horizontal plane representing the respiration level of the HCWs during treating the patient. The concentration of pollutants is reduced as they move away from the patient. The stagnation of air was observed in some regions with the high concentration of pollutant. It was observed that there is air short circuiting between the SA diffusers and the EA grilles from the vector plot of air velocity. In the AIIR, the CFD simulation used to predict pollutant distribution profiles and air flow pattern was well analyzed. The absolute concentration value of pollutant has no significance in this research. Rather, it is the relative concentration profile between one ventilation system and the other that is very important. Table 4 shows the exposure level of pollutant to the HCWs. Ventilation Case#1 has high concentration values that ranging between 33.1 and 72.7 ppm. The lowest concentration is observed around HCW-3, while the highest concentration is observed at HCW-1. While giving treatment to the patient, the HCW will likely be standing at 1.4 m with the higher exposure level of pollutant. It indicates that Case#1 is poor for removing pollutants from the AIIR. Compared with Ventilation Case#1, Ventilation Case#2 and Case#3 have lower concentration values, ranging between 25.1 and 34.4 ppm, and between 21.2 and 24.4 ppm, respectively. Table 5 shows the percentage difference of predicted concentration between the ventilation Case#1, Case#2 and Case#3. When the HCWs were treating the patient, there was a large difference in the pollutant exposure level. At 1.4 m location average value of pollutant concentration, Case#2 was 11.9% lower than in Case#1. Similarly, Case#3 was more effective in removing contaminant in the AIIR compared to Case#1 and Case#2 with 24.2% and 14.0% respectively. For the average concentration of whole room, Case#2 was lower than Case#1 with 22.7%. Exposure level of Case#3, 34.8 ppm, was lower compared to Case#1 (48.4 ppm) and Case#2 (37.4 ppm). Ventilation case #3, which was the best of three cases to remove pollutant from AIIR, bound to improve efficiency with 28.1% of Case#1 and 7.0% of Case#2. A clean air moves from the HCWs to the patient resulted in the improved air flow pattern in healthcare facilities. The use of a single pass setup is expected to lower the risk of infection from patients to HCWs These results indicated that placement of EA grilles directly behind the patient's head can potentially provide a ready flow path for airborne contamination to exit the AIIR without remarkable recirculation and entrainment back into the SA stream. A combination of locations for and types of SA diffusers, locations of room EA and SA flow rates can affect the air flow patterns in the AIIR which are quite complex and specific to a particular design configuration. The air flow profile at the patient's bed is less than 0.25 m/s within the recommended threshold air velocity value. Smoke testing was used to visualize the air movement directions in the AIIR and to evaluate how well pollutants are removed. Fig. 7(a) shows the results of a smoke test conducted in a negative pressure AIIR, visualizing air flow by using a portable fog generator. Results showed that the indoor air did not mix or spread inside of the AIIR, but was discharged immediately through two low wall EA grilles placed behind the patient's head. Fig. 7(b) illustrates the SF 6 concentration profiles at the six monitoring points in the AIIR. As SF 6 was injected, the tracer gas concentration increased rapidly at monitoring locations SP-1 to SP-5. It was observed that the concentration trend at each point reached equilibrium after 20 min and showed a similar profile. Monitoring location SP-6 shows only trace levels for concentration of SF 6 . This means that there was no air flow from the AIIR to the anteroom when the door was closed and the AIIR was under negative pressure. At SP-4 and SP-5, the two EA grilles, the SF 6 concentration continued to maintain at a Table 5 The pollutant concentration percentage difference of 3 ventilation cases. Percentage difference . It is assumed that these average values were so small due to air flow movement caused by the large area of the EA grilles. Assuming maximum values, maximum pollution concentration on SP-4 and SP-5 is respectively 142 ppm and 132 ppm, which are over 4.2-5.8 times higher than on SP-1 to SP-3. Consequentially, it was determined that pollutants were removed with high efficacy.
