The protein contained in each spot was submitted to in-gel trypsin digestion and the mass of the resulting peptides was obtained from MALDI-TOF MS analysis. However, we focus our attention in this study on the protein corresponding to spot #3. Once we have obtained the data from MALDI-TOF MS analysis of spot #3, the more relevant MS signals were introduced into the MASCOT search engine [182, 183] . Due to the fact that the MASCOT collection of annotated databases does not contained data about L. infantum proteome, we chose the L. major database of annotated proteins with MS recorded because of its similarity to L. Infantum [184] . Even being a protein fragment of low MW, the MASCOT search of MS signals found one hit with an M s higher than 51 (p < 0.05) for spot #3 (see Table 4 ). The top Mowse score found was 61, correspondent to the protein LmjF36.6010 of L. major with mass 73 697 but without know function annotation. The second highest Mowse score of 42 correspond to the protein LmjF31.2850c assigned as one ribosomal protein of L. major specie with mass 22 350. The other proteins to complete a total of 20 with similar Mowse scores were summarized in Table 4 . All these proteins have Mowse values lower that the threshold value of 51 used to identify proteins with significant similarity. In any case, many of them have been also recorded with unknown function or as hypothetical proteins. Taking into consideration we can consider this protein as low-Mowse score case (because no protein in MASCOT search with known function has a high score). As we referred in introduction precisely the PMF of this type of protein may be of high interest. In Table 5 we give detailed information on the results of the MS analysis of the PMF of the new protein using MALDI-TOF technique and MASCOT search engine. Similar combination have been successfully used in the past to study Trichinella antigens [157] and possible Leishmania dynein proteins [83] . In this table we have shown only the 35 more interesting peptides matching with the MS of other proteins on the MASCOT search. Considering the high importance of phylogenetic analysis in the next section we propose a new algorithm for phylogenetic tree construction based MDTs and using this set of peptides as case study.
