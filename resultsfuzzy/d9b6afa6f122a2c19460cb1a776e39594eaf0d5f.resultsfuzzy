Two communities (i.e., A and B ) are considered in this manuscript while intra-contacts exist. Each community is represented by a two-layered multiplex network consisting of a physical layer and a virtual one. For simplicity, two communities are of the same number of individuals (i.e., N ), thus the total number of individuals in the investigated system equals to 2 N . Simulations are conducted to investigate the epidemic spreading process the adoption of MC simulation. Stable output is obtained if reasonable simulation runs are used. Initially, a number of N I individuals in community A are randomly selected to be infected. During the epidemic transition process, individuals in community B are infected due to intra-connections. Simulation stops if stationary states of the system are achieved or the investigated time steps are reached. Corresponding parameters are listed as in Table 2 . With the parameters in Table 2 , simulations can be performed with the obtained results being depicted in Fig. 6 . Here, the average value is obtained for 10 simulations. For comparison, the scenario of excluding the virtual layer is also investigated. As per by the simulation results, the incorporation of virtual layer is capable of reducing the proportion of infected individuals to a large extent. This phenomena is consistent with common sense as once an individual is aware of the epidemic, various preventive measures are taken to reduce the infectivity. For the investigated system with provided parameters in Table 2 , there are two summits occurred, being referred to as M curve. For different experiment, the summits are likely to come at different time step. This is due to the different nodes being selected for initial infection and the stochastic fluctuations of simulation based approaches. Furthermore, disparity of the summits of the epidemic spreading process in different communities is also presented in Table 3 for different experiments. Here, five simulations are conducted and presented for simplicity. As shown by the obtained time step of the summits, we can see the summit for communities without the virtual layer always comes later than that for the scenario with virtual layer. This indicates that the incorporation of virtual layer is able to postpone the summit of the epidemic spreading process. Furthermore, as indicated by the results, for the scenario with virtual layer, the average value of disparity is obtained as 37.4; nevertheless, if the virtual layer is not incorporated, the corresponding average value is obtained as 20. This shows the disparity between two summits is likely to be enlarged if the virtual layer is investigated. Furthermore, the trend of proportion of individuals with awareness is illustrated in Fig. 7 for certain simulation. As indicated by the results, we can draw the conclusion that the proportion is becoming stationary with the increasing of the mission time. This is due to the reason that with the proceeding of the evolving process, the infected individuals are close to zero; most individuals fall into the state combination of AR ; this can be indicated by Fig. 4 . Furthermore, the increase of proportion of individuals with awareness in the virtual layer for community A (which is infected first) is faster than that for community B. Furthermore, the states of the 20 0 0 nodes are presented in Fig. 8 for different time steps for certain simulation. As in Fig. 8 , the proportion of infected and revered individuals in A is much larger than that in B. This indicates the previous conclusion that the epidemic spreading faster in community A. This is due to the reason that the average degree of intra-community is much smaller than the degree distributions of communities A and B, thus the infectivity among communities is largely affected by the average degree of intra-contacts. As stated previously, the disparity of the two summits for the M curve is affected by a number of factors, such as topology of community, intra-degree distribution, infectivity probability inside community, intra-infectivity probability, existence of virtual layer, self-protection and etc. The effects of system topology on the disparity of the summits of spreading in different communities are investigated. The obtained results are presented in Fig. 9 ; here, the parameters remain as in Table 2 . As per by the results in Fig. 9 , we can draw the conclusion that the system topology plays an important role in affecting the epidemic spreading process in multicommunities. If the effects of other factors are focused, similar analysis can be performed. Moreover, the nodes on different virtual layers for different communities might be also intra-connected; this is consistent with practice, for instance, two individuals from different countries might only be friends through internet tools such as twitter. If the intra-connections are incorporated, then similar analysis can be performed with minor modification of the probability transition tree. The incorporation of intra-connection between the different virtual layers is anticipated to capable of reducing the infection of the communities further.
