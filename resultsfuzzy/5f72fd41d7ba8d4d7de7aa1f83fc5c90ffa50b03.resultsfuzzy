By taking the difference of the logged accumulated cases and applying one lag, our estimated transmission routes are available from January 31 to February 19 (two observations are lost). To avoid potential noises caused by small numbers, we only include data of provinces, which had at least 150 accumulated confirmed cases as of February 19. Altogether, our modeled sample contains 20 province-level confirmed cases. A non-zero estimate of β i,j,t , the ij th entry of B t in (2), indicates that on the t th day, the growth rate of province j is Granger caused by that of province i. In other words, there is a transmission route from province i to province j. Among the 20-day results, we noticed that the estimated transmission routes on days 1-5 changed considerably on daily basis. From the sixth day onwards, however, those estimated routes were more steady. Hence, we plot the estimates on days 1-5 and those on the every fifth day thereafter, on Figure 2 . Be noted that estimates smaller than 0.2 (none-influential) are not presented to avoid inevitable estimation noises and for a better illustration. In Figure 2 , we use color of light orange (small) to dark red (large) indicating the accumulated confirmed cases in each province, up to time t. Estimated transmission routes are colored in blue. Self-transmissions are denoted by dots, and a larger size of dot suggests a larger estimated β i,i,t . Inter-province transmission is represented by arrows, with the transparency indicating the magnitude of estimated β i,j,t . On the first day (January 31), there were influential inter-province transmissions from Hubei to Jiangxi, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu and Shaanxi, sorted by the magnitudes of strength 6 .

There were a few additional detected such transmissions on the second day, including those from Hubei to Guangxi, from Zhejiang to Fujian, and from Guangdong to Yunnan, Hunan and Fujian. The number of such identified inter-province routes, however, reduced rapidly over the next three days. On the fifth day (February 4), no influential transmission routes were found from Hubei to directly affect other provinces, and there were only three influential routes identified nationally, including Zhejiang-Shaanxi, Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Jiangxi-Shanghai. The number of those detected inter-province routes declined again in the next few days, and on day 13, only Henan-Heilongjiang was found influential. On days 19 and 20 (February 18 and 19) , there were no influential inter-province transmissions identified. The above findings suggest that the number of influential inter-province transmissions overall dropped quickly in the first five days and then reduced steadily for the rest fifteen days. This is consistent with the observations of Figure 3 On each day, we report the mean, standard deviation (Std. Dev.), the 25% quantile (Q 1 ) and 75% quantile (Q 3 ) of those estimates in Table 1 , which also leads to consistent findings. As for the self-transmission, we firstly examine Figure 2 This is consistent with our findings on Figure 3 (b) , where time-varying estimated β i,i,t are plotted for each province. We report daily descriptive statistics of those estimates in Table   1 , which also results in consistent conclusions.
