3.1. Modulation of gene transcripts in the "complement and coagulation cascades" pathway in VHSV-infected zebrafish fins and lymphoid organs Two-days after infection-by-immersion of zebrafish with VHSV, more fin genes were differentially expressed (modulated) in the "complement and coagulation cascades" KEGG pathway than in many other immune-related pathways [8, 10] . These published data suggested an important participation of this pathway in the early responses of zebrafish to rhabdoviral infections since fins are the portal of entry for these viruses [3] . A more detailed analysis of the corresponding gene-by-gene differential expressions in the above mentioned pathway, showed that more genes were modulated in fins (60.9%) than in lymphoid organs (17.1%) ( Table 1) . For example, while f7, f9, f10, f5, proc, f2, fg, plg (coagulation pathway) and crp, hbl4, c1s, c4, c2, h, c3, plg, c6, c8, c9 (complement pathway) genes were upregulated in fins, only f7, hbl4, c4, c3, c7 and c9 were upregulated in lymphoid organs. In contrast, only f8, vwf, and c7 were downregulated in fins or organs. The rest of the 41 genes in fins or organs were not modulated (Table 1 ). In addition, many of the highest 4e6-fold gene upregulations in the fins were found on serpins (i.e. serpina1, serpinc1, serpinf2, ser-pind1 and serping1) compared to lymphoid organs (Table 1 , bold). Only serpine1 remained not modulated, in sharp contrast to the rest of serpins in the fins (Table 1, bold) . These data suggested that serpins as well as other genes coding for inhibitors in this pathway (i.e. proc, h), may be upregulated by the VHSV infection to favor viral spreading by increasing hemorrhaging and delaying complementdependent cell lysis, except serpine1. These inhibitor upregulations could be part of the general immunosuppression described during early rhabdoviral infection of zebrafish with VHSV and other rhabdoviruses [8e10].
