Identification of a Stable Proteolytic Fragment of IBV-N The full-length IBV-N protein comprising 409 residues was expressed in E. coli in a soluble form and purified as described in the Experimental Procedures. Crystallization trials with the full-length protein produced crystals that grew from a precipitate after about 3 months. Analysis of dissolved crystals using SDS-PAGE reveals that they contain a fragment of the full-length protein of about 14.7 kDa (Figure 1) . A domain of similar size could be obtained by incubating the IBV-N protein at room temperature for the same period ( Figure 1 ). Thus, this polypeptide fragment presumably derives from slow proteolysis of IBV-N by traces of E. coli proteases present in the crystallization solution. In order to identify its nature, this proteolytically stable fragment was subjected to mass spectrometry, which revealed a mass of 14,692 Da. N-terminal amino acid sequencing identified residues Ser-Ser-Gly-Asn-Ala-Ser-Trp, which are located at positions 29-35 of the IBV-N amino acid sequence. Given that Ser-29 is the first amino acid of the fragment, the closest mapping onto the sequence gives Leu-160 as the C-terminal residue (calculated mass 14,691 Da). The IBV-N29-160 protein shares 37% amino acid sequence identity with the N-terminal RNA binding domain of a comparable domain from the SARS-CoV N protein (SARS-N45-181), whose structure was reported recently (Figure 2 ).
