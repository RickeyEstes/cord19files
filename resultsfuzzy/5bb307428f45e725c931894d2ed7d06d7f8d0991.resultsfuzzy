Vero E6 cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The SARS-CoV diagnostic IIFT kit (EUROIMMUN AG, Lübeck, Germany) was used with minor modifi cations: bat and reference human serum specimens were diluted 1:100 (found to be the optimal dilution for bat sera) in sample buffer, and secondary detection was performed with goat-antibat immunoglobulin (Ig) (Bethyl, Montgomery, AL, USA) followed by fl uorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled donkeyantigoat Ig (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) (A-F) or FITC-labeled goat-antihuman Ig (G-I). Frames A-D, SARS-CoV ELISA-positive bat serum specimens 2, 17, 26, 31; E-F, ELISA-negative bat serum specimens 38 (showing unspecifi c signals) and 306; G-H, SARS-CoV-positive human control serum specimens A and B; I, negative human serum C. All photographs were taken at equivalent microscope settings. Scale bars represent 20 μm. of the African bat species harbor agents related to putative group 4 CoV, and therefore further investigations should be undertaken to determine potential public health risks.
