In trial 1, 3 calves died for reasons unrelated to dietary treatments, before they were started on experimental diets. Ingredient composition of starter (Table  1 ) differed only in the particle size of straw, nutrient composition of PS versus SS, MS, and LS was similar when straw chemical analysis was proportionally added to the pellet used to mix those diets. The straw put in the pellet in PS diet did not affect its X gm , as the X gm of PS and the pellet used for SS, MS, and LS were similar. The proportion of particles >1.18 mm in the PS diet and the pellet used for SS, MS, and LS was lower than the recommended particle size (50% of particles >1.19 mm) for calves fed starter with no forage and without access to consume bedding, to ensure adequate intake, proper rumen fermentation (Warner et al., 1973) , pre-vent physiological abnormalities, and initiate rumination (Porter et al., 2007) ; hence, the effect of straw particle size would have been enhanced. Table 2 shows BW of calves in each trial, which was similar across treatments at birth and at slaughter. In all results, week refers to time after starter was available and not chronological age when not specified. Mean starter intake (including orts put through the cannula in 12 cannulated calves in trial 1) was similar across treatments and increased with time by design ( Figure 1 ; Table 3 ). Most days noncannulated calves ate their full feed allotment, and no orts were collected from noncannulated calves except on the last day of Table 1 . Ingredient and chemical composition and particle size of starters containing 5% straw differing in particle size either in the pellet (PS) or mixed with the pellet The premix contained (per kg): 160 g of Cu, 0.13 g of Co, 9.40 g of Fe, 0.14 g of I, 5.4 g of Mn, 0.04 g of Se, 6.70 g of Zn, 1,800 IU of vitamin A, 600 IU of vitamin D, 16 IU of vitamin E, 0.01 g of biotin, 2.93 g of cobalamin, 0.04 g of folic acid, 1.77 g of niacin, 1.32 g of pantothenic acid, 0.24 g of pyridoxine, 0.30 g of riboflavin, 0.29 g of thiamin (Provimi North America, Brookville, OH). 4 Geometric mean (X gm ) and standard deviation (S gm ) of particle length as calculated by ASABE (2007) using data from screens â‰¥0.15 mm.

A diet by week interaction was detected in trial 1 for wk 6, where PS and MS intake was lower than SS and LS. Most of the difference comes from orts of the last starter feeding before slaughter; however, it was also influenced by some fistulated calves' reduced intake, possibly due to acidosis, in wk 6 (PS = 2, MS = 2, SS = 1). Starter intake was greater in trial 1 when compared with trial 2 (3,559 vs. 1,928 g/wk). Age of calves when starter was available was greater in trial 1 (3 vs. 1 wk of age), calves in trial 1 were completely weaned during wk 6, and the time between trials may have affected the palatability of pellets. Milk replacer evening feeding was withheld in calves not eating at least 50% of their daily starter allowance, the proportion of skipped meals (fixed for uneven animal number) was not evenly distributed among treatments (118 total skipped meals; PS = 19%, SS = 15%, MS = 43%, LS = 23%); however, it did not affect MR intake across diets, possibly because the number of skipped meals was only about 7% of total offered meals.
