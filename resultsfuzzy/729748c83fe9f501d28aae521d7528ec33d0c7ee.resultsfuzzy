The study included 20 patients admitted to the intensive treatment unit of a private hospital in São Paulo, from January 2012 to December 2013, and diagnosed as bronchospasm and/or wheezing. Age range of 1 to 158 months, median of 16 months (interquartile interval -IQI: 10 to 74 months). The mean length of stay was 5.7 days (standard deviation − SD -of 3.19). Drug treatment was not changed because of the study. Bronchodilators (salbutamol) were used in 100% of cases, oral corticosteroids (prednisolone) were given on 14 (70%) occasions, and 4 (20%) patients received intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone). Inhalation with a hypertonic solution was prescribed for 30% of patients and antibiotics for 80%. The treatment considered prophylactic was maintained during hospitalization for three patients, in which each one of them received a different type of medication, namely: montelukast (Singulair ® ), fluticasone propionate (Flixotide ® ), and fluticasone associated with salmeterol (Seretide ® ). Respiratory physical therapy was done in 100% of patients. The time between the start of conventional treatment and the introduction of Heliox ® showed a median of 10 hours (3 to 53 hours). The variables to evaluate the clinical outcome are shown on table 2. In two cases, treatment with Heliox ® was associated with noninvasive ventilation. Heliox ® was discontinued due to treatment failure in three (25%) patients − two of them after 30 minutes and one after 60 minutes. Of these, one required invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients who did not maintain SpO 2 >92% with 40% oxygen and/or who did not present with any improvement in the severity score after one hour of Heliox ® , had its use discontinued. The mean disease severity score at time point zero was 5.6 (SD 2.0) and at time point 120 minutes, it was 3.4 (SD 2.0). This difference found in the severity score was statistically different as of 30 minutes (p<0.001), according to what is presented in figure 2 . The heart rate evaluation showed significance only at the first time point of the study, but this relevance was not sustained (Figure 3 ). The variation of respiratory rate showed a similar progression as the severity score, also showing significance as of 30 minutes (Figure 4 ). We did not observe a relation between the days of hospitalization and the severity score (r=0.15 and p=0.4).
