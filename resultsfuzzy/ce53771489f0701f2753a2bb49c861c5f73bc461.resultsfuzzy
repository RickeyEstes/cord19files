Jackknife results for the four datasets are shown in Figure 1 . We first consider the bottom figure for the "Fungi 85" dataset. When more than 60% proteins are used for the K=6 and 7 jackknife trees, it yields results comparatively close to the original CVTree at the same K-value. In fact, at protein fraction 0.9, the average result of K=7 tree appears to be closest to the original CVTree. For prokaryotes we show the results for two datasets with 109 and 450 genomes, respectively. The two figures bear great similarity at more than threefold differences of the number of genomes. Therefore, it is natural to expect that similar behavior holds for even greater datasets. For both datasets, the lowest K=5 and 6 curves yield results closest to the original CVTrees. The topmost figure shows jackknife results for viruses. As the overall size of virus proteomes is much smaller, these trees differ more in their topological distance from the original CVTrees. Yet at K=4 and 5 for not-too-small protein fractions, the trees are reasonably close to the original CVTrees as discussed in Gao and Qi (5) , displaying significant agreement with present understanding of the virus classification. There are variations of jackknife tests, for example, by checking the resulted trees when dropping out one species at a time. Conversely, one may add a few genomes, chosen at random, to see the effect of dataset getting larger and larger. We call this an anti-jackknife test. We have published prokaryotic CVTrees for 84 genomes in Hao and Qi, 2003 (17) , 109 genomes in Qi et al (1) , 145 genomes in Hao and Qi, 2004 (18) , 222 genomes in Gao et al, 2006 (19) , 440 genomes in Gao et al, 2007 (6) , and 892 genomes in Li et al (7) . Our most recent CVTrees were obtained for 1,173 genomes (unpublished). The quality of CVTrees in the sense of agreement with taxonomy has kept improving. Viewed retrospectively, the CV method has successfully endured the anti-jackknife tests. Besides the well-known fact that, in general, broader sampling improves phylogenetic trees, CVTrees have demonstrated significant robustness with expanding datasets. As we explained before, triangles superimposed at protein fraction 0.6321 in Figure 1 show bootstrap results at K-values represented by the same color as the jackknife curves. In fact, each triangle gives the average topological distance from 100 bootstrap tests. The distributions of the 100 bootstrap tests at each K-value are shown in Figure 2 , which was actually produced by using graphic tools in the R Package (20) . Against each K-value, the median, the 25% and 75% range, and the minimal and maximal values are drawn. It is interesting to note that Figure 2 provides another angle to look at the "best" K-values for different organism groups. It is appropriate to reproduce in more details the order-of-magnitude estimate for the "best" K-values, given in our recent paper (7). Suppose that the frequency of appearance of all amino acids is the same, e.g., 1/20. Then the probability of encountering a designated K-peptide is 20 -K . Let L be the total number of amino acids in the collection of proteins of an organism, the expected number of such K-peptide is L/(20) K . In order for a K-peptide to bear species-specificity, this number should be less than what expected for a random sequence, i.e., L/(20) K <<1 or, after taking logarithm of base 10, logL < K(1+log2). On the other hand, the subtraction procedure in CV method requires that the number of (K 2)-peptide should not be too few: L/(20) (K 2) >1, i.e., logL > (K 2)(1+log2). Putting together these inequalities, we get logL/(1+log2) < K < 2+logL/(1+log2). In an order-of-magnitude discussion, we may take the total number L of amino acids in an organisms' proteome to be 10 5 , 10 6 , and 10 7 for viruses, prokaryotes, and fungi, respectively. Thus we get 3.8 < K < 5.8 (for viruses) 4.6 < K < 6.6 (for prokaryotes) 5.4 < K < 7.4 (for fungi) yielding K=4 and 5 for viruses, 5 and 6 for prokaryotes, and 6 and 7 for fungi, agreeing with what is seen clearly in Figure 2 . The use of whole-genome data is both a merit and a demerit of the CV method, as the number of whole genomes, though growing rapidly, is always limited. However, our jackknife and bootstrap tests show that suffice it to have a substantial part of proteins of each organism, the major branchings in the trees will justify the corresponding taxonomy and vice versa.
