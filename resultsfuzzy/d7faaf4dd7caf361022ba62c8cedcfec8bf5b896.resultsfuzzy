The normalized mean wind speed ratio (K) have been used effectively by previous researchers [2, 17, 20 ] to analyse the pedestrian-level wind environments. The advantages of the use of K value are its ability to eliminate the differences in wind speeds and turbulence intensities of incoming wind flows and only highlight the modifications occurred in the local wind environment near buildings. Moreover, by knowing the K values, designers can calculate corresponding wind speeds by using local meteorological wind speed data at a given location. For this study, K value is calculated by using the measured mean wind speeds at the 10 mm height as expressed in equation (3). where, U 10mm;x;y is the mean wind speed at the 10 mm height measured at a location (x, y), and U 10mm;ambient is the mean wind speed at the 10 mm height at the same location but without the building. Fig. 5 (a) and (b) display the distributions of the K values around a 'lift-up' building (i.e., model M5) and the control building (hereafter referred to as CB) respectively. The cubic interpolation method was used to plot the contours of K and all the distances were normalized with respect to the building depth (D). In figures, the red arrow on the upstream side of buildings points in the direction of the approaching wind. Owing to a number of flow modifications, the pedestrian-level wind environment surrounding the 'lift-up' building (model M5) is different from the wind field corresponding to the control building (CB), as shown in Fig. 5 . The most noticeable flow modification is found on the lateral sides of the 'lift-up' building where the corner streams (CS), which is also referred as the separation layers, are larger in size and higher in magnitude than of the CB. Moreover, the CS zones of model M5 are formed closer to the building in such a way that a portion of the corner streams is in the lift-up area, which is indicated by the dash rectangular box in Fig. 5 . The low wind speed (LWS) areas (marked by blue) corresponding to model M5 also display some noticeable differences from those found in the CB. Particularly, a distinct LWS area is formed next to the leeward side of model M5, whereas no downstream near-field low wind speed zone (the DNLWS zone) can be identified for the CB. The influence of the 'lift-up' floors gradually diminishes far downstream of the building as indicated by the formation of the downstream far-field low wind speed zone (the DFLWS zone) of model M5 at the same location as in the case of the CB. However, compared to the CB, model M5's DFLWS zone has a larger area where K values are small (K 0.6). Apparently, K values in the Particularly, the HWS zones appearing on the lateral sides of the building display significant variations in size and magnitude with the core dimensions. For example, taller cores, such as in model M3, create larger HWS zones further away from the side walls of the 'lift-up' building. Shorter cores, on the contrary, produced smaller HWS zones closer to the building. Furthermore, the HWS zones, in some extreme cases, occupy a major portion of the 'lift-up' area, such as shown in Fig. 6 corresponding to model M1. The 'lift-up' core height has marginal influence on the LWS zones in the upstream and downstream directions of the buildings as indicated by a slight increase of K values in the ULWS zone with the 'lift-up' core height. However, the location of the ULWS zone, whether it is attached to the building or not, is strongly dependent on the core height. As it can be seen in model M1, the shorter core (h ¼ 3 m) creates an attached ULWS zone, but in model M3, which has a taller core (h ¼ 9 m), produced a ULWS zone that is detached from the building. Compared to the 'lift-up' core height, the core area has some distinct influences on the LWS zones both in the upstream and downstream directions of the buildings including the formation of bigger DNLWS zones with smaller K values by larger core areas. The observed flow modifications near the 'lift-up' buildings are qualitatively compared to the wind-tunnel test results corresponding to the control building (CB) by using the normalized difference of K values (DK) as defined in equation (4)  In equation (4), K Mðx;yÞ denotes the normalized wind speed ratio (K) at a location (x,y) in the surrounding of a 'lift-up' building, and K CBðx;yÞ denotes the K value at the same location but in the wind environment of the CB. As is evident from Figs. 6 and 7 the lift-up buildings modify their surrounding wind environment differently than the building without 'lift-up' floors. The differences in the pedestrian-level wind field around buildings with and without 'lift-up' designs are a result of the formation of HWS and LWS zones and their variations in size and magnitude with the 'lift-up' core dimensions. Therefore, the rest of the discussion focuses on examining the variations of the HWS and LWS zones with the 'lift-up' core dimensions. Furthermore, the pedestrian-level wind field in the 'lift-up' area is systematically investigated to show the characteristics of the wind environment beneath the main structure of the 'lift-up' building.
