To facilitate the illustration of the developed framework, the lift-up areas in the campus model were firstly blocked during the wind tunnel tests, as shown in Fig. 8 . This means that there was no lift-up design in the campus model for this case (preliminary case). The evaluation results of wind comfort in summer for the preliminary case are presented in Fig. 9 . It can be seen that in the central part of the campus, the areas around building Y and the area between core A and core B had higher OMVR values than the other parts of the campus. Thus, these areas had acceptable wind comfort. Besides, the majority of the campus had low OMVR values, which lead to unfavourable wind comfort. Furthermore, nearly 80% of the spaces in the campus were unfavourable for any pedestrian activity. In general, the wind comfort in the campus was not suitable for pedestrian activities in hot and humid summers.
