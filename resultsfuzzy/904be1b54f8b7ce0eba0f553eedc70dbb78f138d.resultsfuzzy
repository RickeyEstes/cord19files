Accompanied by a comment suggesting a request for AST via phone call 5 Not accompanied by a comment 3 Strain presence discrepancy considered as negligible in culture (Table 3) 1 Strain presence discrepancy considered as significant in culture ( In molecular biology, the usage of IQA samples shows the common occurrence of discrepancies (10/122 analyses, Fig 1) . Most discrepant results were due to the stochastic variability of qPCR occurring around the limit of detection, where by definition qPCRs lose part of their sensitivity [42] . Accordingly, these discrepancies should not be considered as technical errors or insufficiencies. Yet, this variability for weakly positive samples may be overlooked by clinicians who often give too much importance to negative results, even when the negative predictive value is known to be low (i.e. for M. tuberculosis detection and for Listeria PCR in cerebrospinal fluid). While such discrepancies are of limited implication in terms of quality assurance, the single quantitative discrepancy of a 610-folds factor between copies/ml, with almost identical Ct number, was worrisome. Investigations revealed that this difference was the consequence of an error in the manual transcription of the result. In this specific situation, this error did not have clinical impact, since both results would be interpreted as highly positive by clinicians. However, this error highlighted a weak point in our procedures and led us to integrate our automated PCR system with a middleware capable of two directions data transfers from the Applied Biosystems PCR machine to the LIS, in order to definitively abolish any risk of human errors during results retranscription. Made worthy, no false positive seem to have resulted from PCR contaminations. This is particularly remarkable considering the high sensitivity of PCR and likely results from the advanced automatization of our qPCR platform [19] . Moreover, our IQA process proved itself useful to detect potential errors in this laboratory. Gram stain reading is well established as a complex procedure that has number of pitfalls and its poor reliability has been described at multiple occasions [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . It is still worrisome to observe that almost 40% of the compared results included at least one discrepancy of more than two relative units, which we categorized as major (Table 2 ). This rate cannot be directly compared to any other data available in literature, the only similar experiment being the study of Constantine et al. (14) , which had only 2% of discrepancies for microscopy, but using a very different definition of discrepancy which allowed much larger differences in the semi-quantitative results. The other studies on the reproducibility of Gram stain use very different methodologies, such as comparison of the concordance between Gram stain and culture results or between different observers reading identical smears, thus providing non-comparable results [44] [45] [46] [47] . Observing the results by parameters in Table 2 , the repartition of reported results should be considered. For example, the very high Gram-positive diplococci or yeasts concordance is associated with a very high level of negativity. Kappa score partially helps to compare parameters between them, taking into account the natural proportion of concordance explained by random probability [36] . According to this score, we conclude that in our laboratory the counts of host cells (leukocytes, erythrocytes) is less reliable than the counts of bacteria. This questions the sense of reporting parameters such as erythrocytes, with such a high level of variability and low clinical impact. Those data also support the need for continuous staff training in this domain and the integration of automatization in Gram reading to improve reproducibility. In the evaluation of error rates in Gram staining examination, it is important to emphasize that our study included no gold-standard. Thus, our experts (GGR and CDU) could only subjectively assess the most likely origin of the discrepancies. Errors were typically suspected when discrepancies were not compatible with biological variations because they were of very large amplitude or when confusion was suspected (e.g. ++++ Gram-positive cocci versus ++++ erythrocytes). Nevertheless, the factors leading to result heterogeneity and errors are numerous for Gram stains. Indeed, the important heterogeneity of samples such as sputa or fragments and the heterogeneity induced by the staining process can already bring a lot of variability before the reading phase itself, which is a task known as subjective and complex. Moreover, despite the high proportion of discrepant cases, our experts concluded that most of them would have no clinical impact, mainly because they involved host cell quantifications and not detection of bacteria (Table 1) . Furthermore, the clinical impact of Gram stains itself is subject to discussion, as for the diagnosis of pneumonia [48, 49] . Nevertheless, if the importance of Gram results can be relativized, our work also showed that discrepancies in microscopy results can influence subsequent analytical steps, with significant impact on final culture and AST results transmitted to the clinicians (Tables 3 and 5) . Reviewing the comments transmitted with the Gram stain results, an interesting observation was made concerning 4 out of 22 urinary samples that had contradictory comments which concluded once to negativity and once to positivity for the corresponding replicate. These discrepancies were caused by relative quantifications of bacteria that were scored "few" for one sample and "+" or "++" for the other, with an automatic comment announcing positivity in the second case only. Comparing those results with the culture results performed on the same samples, all 4 samples were confirmed positive. This observation questions the usefulness of the "few" category. The results of culture shown in Table 3 , with 12 significant differences out of 84 cultures pairs (85.7% accuracy), are representative of its complexity. Culture is a dynamic process influenced by many factors, including heterogeneity of samples, Gram stains results, selected culture media, stochastic growth variability and interpretation of the clinical significance of the presence of colonies with choices to identify or not the grown colonies. All these factors contribute to explain the observed discrepancies. Better homogenization of the samples, reconsideration of how Gram results are used to select culture media and training of the personnel concerning analytical choices are all possible ways to improve reliability of the culture steps. Furthermore, regarding the design of an IQA program, longer time between the treatment of the original samples and their replicates was in our data associated with higher level of discrepancy in cultures results. Even this is to be expected, it underlines the importance of shortening the time delay between the inoculation of the original samples and the replicates. Interestingly, we observed a low rate of significant discrepancies within the AST performed on identical bacteria (Table 4, Fig 2 and S2 Table) . On the other hand, steps preceding accomplishment of AST (Gram staining, cultivation, identification and interpretation of culture) often influence significantly the AST transmitted to the clinicians (Tables 3 and 5 ). These observations make us consider that the accuracy of the analytical phase of AST is satisfactory and that we should focus on the pre-analytical factors that are influencing their realization. It could be argued that the clinical information available concerning the IQA samples were different (e.g. the age) or lacking (e.g. the service of hospitalization), influencing the interpretation of the culture. If this may explain some discrepancies in the interpretation of similar culture results, discrepancies originating from diverging interpretation of similar cultures concerned only a minority of samples (Table 5 ). Our study, which included only a limited number of samples, provided interesting data on reproducibility. However, samples were not totally chosen in blind but sometimes selected because they addressed a particular analytical question. For instance, cloudy urinary samples were preferably chosen over limpid samples and positive samples are certainly over-represented, increasing the probability of diverging results. Another limitation of our IQA program concerns specifically the serology laboratory. First, in this facility, blood samples are coming in gel-based serum separating tubes. They are centrifuged and the supernatant is directly transferred into new tubes. This implies that the replicates could only come from already treated samples and that their visual aspect was different from almost all routine samples. The technicians of this facility are routinely checking anterior results from the tested patients to integrate the new results within their serological status. Because we were using a limited pool of anonymous patient profiles, our technicians eventually faced multiple anterior results corresponding to IQA samples processed earlier. Both the visual difference of samples and the anterior results from anonymous patient's profile led to strong suspicions of the staff working in the serology laboratory about our ongoing experimental IQA process, which finally obliged us to discontinue the IQA in this laboratory. This specific issue did not concern the two other facilities where our process could be completed in secret and on samples that were not pretreated. Despite this limitation, we consider that our process could still have an interest for IQA in serology laboratories, but that it would need to be partly redesigned. A proposition would be to duplicate samples before their arrival in the laboratory. It would solve the problem of visual impact and improve the coverage of pre-analytical steps. It would also be necessary to use more sophisticated fake patient identities, without previous IQA results to prevent their recognition by our coworkers. Finally, even if our results cover more steps than traditional quality processes, it is still not covering all steps from prescription to interpretation of results by clinicians. Thus, we intend to extend this quality assurance project by collaborating with three other Swiss hospital laboratories. Each laboratory would challenge the others with split samples sent into containers accompanied by etiquettes and identifications used by the receiving laboratories for their external demands. This way, each laboratory would play the role of reference laboratory for one fourth of all samples. This approach would resolve the limitations of our scheme concerning the pre-treatment of the serology samples, the recognition of the samples and the lack of reference results. Such interlaboratory shared quality assurance would also help to provide "external assurance" for some serological and molecular parameters for which there is currently no EQA available (i.e. Tropheryma whipplei). In conclusion, this study revealed insightful points to improve and questioned our current practices, such as the use of Gram results to select culture media. Also, this study confirms the great interest of an IQA scheme based on split samples reprocessed in blind. It represents only few hundreds supplementary analyses, on the over 25'000 analyses run every year in our laboratory and this allowed us to generate interesting data on our reproducibility. This design showed itself to be perfectly complementary to other quality management procedures already ongoing in our laboratory and it should be further developed to better delineate the identified limitations and to settle its place in the overall quality assurance program.
