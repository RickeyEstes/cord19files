in the destruction of neurons, nerve fibers, glial cells, and blood vessels at the site of injury, where approximately 30% of neurofilament constitutive proteins are degraded in 1 h, and 70% are lost within 4 h after the injury [63] . Proteins such as cathepsin B, Y, and S, members of the cysteine lysosomal proteases and papain superfamily, have been linked to neurofilament destruction. This link results from the fact that cathepsin B can degrade myelin basic protein, cathepsin Y can produce a bradykinin, and cathepsin S can degenerate extracellular molecules through inflammatory mediators. In particular, only cathepsin S is able to retain its activity after prolonged incubation at neutral pH, more than 24 h [64, 65] . The expression of this protease is restricted to cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system such as microglia and macrophages [64] . A basement membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), perlecan, which was found to promote mitogenesis and angiogenesis, can be degraded by cathepsin S in vitro. HSPGs have roles in adhesion, protease binding sites, and growth factor regulation as is the case for basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) [66] . Furthermore, cathepsin S degrades laminin, fibronectin, collagens, and elastin at acidic or neutral pH [65] . It is known that TNF , interferon-(IFN ), IL-1 , and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF) stimulate the release of active cathepsin S into an environment with a neutral pH [65] . Subsequently, a change in lipid metabolism and the homeostasis of lipid mediators is an alternate route by which genes are thought to modulate the susceptibility of nervous tissue to trauma. Interestingly, altered protein cleavage, one of the main driving forces of protein aggregation in neurodegenerative disorders, can be further enhanced by trauma occurring in the presence of specific lipid-binding proteins, important molecules in charge of the distribution of lipids and the transport of cholesterol among cells in the CNS. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is one particular example of this phenomenon, since a reduction in its availability causes a reduction in the recovery after neurotrauma or an ischemic insult. ApoE fragments are produced by traumainduced proteolytic cleavage, which, in turn, might disrupt the cytoskeleton by the phosphorylation of tau and the promotion of neurofibrillary tangles. At the same time, ApoE4 increases the inflammatory effect of neurotrauma by a significant increase of IL-6, TNF , and NO â€¢ in the injured tissue [67, 68] .
