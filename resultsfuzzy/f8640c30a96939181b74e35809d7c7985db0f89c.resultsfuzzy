The temperature measurement results are shown in Fig. 5 , which lists the average inside and outside temperatures and the highest and lowest temperatures for each floor. Because the measurements were performed early in the morning, temperature measurements were stable without any noticeable deviations between measurements. The average outside temperature was 4.0 C, with the temperature distribution ranging from the lowest temperature of 3.31 C and the highest temperature of 5.4 C. The temperature inside the elevator shaft differed for each floor: 17 C in the first basement floor, and 23 C in the 19th floor. Although there were slight variations according to whether or not the floor had a door connected to the outside, the temperature generally increased with the increase in floor height of the building. The temperature inside the core (elevator hall) was 18 C in the second basement floor, rising to an average of 0.2 C with the increase in floor height of each floor and was 22 C in the 19th floor. In particular, when the temperature curves in the elevator shaft were compared with those of the core, there was no significant difference in the lower section of the building, but the core temperature was higher, and in the upper section of the building, the elevator shaft temperature was higher. Fig. 6(a) shows the measurements of pressure difference at the elevator doors and ward doors and windows connected to the outside air for each floor, and Fig. 6(b) shows the air flow direction and wind speed entering and exiting the elevator and the core when the elevator door opens on each floor. Fig. 6(a) actually shows a typical pressure difference profile due to the stack effect. The NPL without any pressure difference forms in the central part of the building between the eighth and 11th floors. Regarding pressure difference at the elevator doors (elevator shaft pressure e hall pressure), the difference was shown to be minimal at less than 1 Pa in the first basement floor and second floor because there were no doors connecting these floors to the outside. On the first floor where there was an entrance, the average pressure difference was À13.88 Pa. From the first floor to the fifth floor, the pressure difference between the floors was fairly even at À13 Pa, and in the 20th floor, the average pressure difference was high at 22.81 Pa. In particular, the pressure difference between the first floor and the fifth floor was low compared to that in the 20th floor and the difference was not large between the floors. This is because, in the first floor, the inflow of outside air was comparatively higher than in other floors due to its wide surface area and windows connecting to the outside, while in the fifth floor, the pressure did not significantly differ from that in the first floor due to the effect of an atrium that was vertically connected from the first floor to the fourth floor. Unlike the pressure difference at the elevator doors, there was no significant pressure difference at the divided doors and windows in locations such as consulting rooms and wardrooms. This was because the pressure difference due to the stack effect was dispersed by many rooms surrounding the outer walls, and that dispersed pressure was collecting in the elevator area at the center of the building. In addition, because the floor surface and outer surface areas were wide from the first to the fifth floors, the pressure difference at each door and window in those floors became very small. Due to these reasons, the pressure differences at the doors and windows in the first floor were À2.80 Pa and À0.87 Pa, respectively. In contrast, in wards on the sixth floor or higher, because the floor surface and outer surface area became comparatively smaller with smaller wardrooms divided with interior walls into rooms for five people or two people, the pressure difference at the ward doors and windows was greater than in the lower section of the building. Thus, in the 19th floor, the pressure differences at ward doors and windows were 5.98 Pa and 0.85 Pa, respectively. In particular, the values significantly differed for the doors and the windows because the pressure difference for the windows was smaller due to the smaller wardrooms, while the pressure difference for the doors was greater due to the fact that the pressure concentrated in the elevator halls from the stack effect was distributed to each of the wardrooms. Fig. 6(b) shows the airflow direction and wind speed when the elevator doors are opened. Negative values show airflow from the core to the elevator shaft while positive values show it moving from the elevator shaft to the core. The airflow direction and wind speed for each floor were shown to be determined according to the pressure difference in relation to the NPL. When the elevator door was opened in the first floor of the building, the inside air flow was shown to flow into the elevator at a wind speed of 0.53 m/s. Once in the upper section of the building, however, above the NPL, the wind speed was shown to steadily increase and, in the 20th floor, the airflow was measured flowing out of the elevator at a wind speed of 3.02 m/s. Even though the time of measurement was in April when the inside and outside temperature difference was comparatively smaller than in December, in the upper section of the building, an air flow with unpleasantly high wind speed was flowing out from the elevator shaft when the elevator doors were opened. As shown in Fig. 6(b) , the airflow direction and wind speed profiles for when the elevators in each floor were opened support the argument that the stack effect does occur at the hospital being measured. The assumed input data were checked through numerous simulations to obtain agreement between the simulated and the measured pressure distributions. Since stack effect problems on typical floors occur mostly around the core area, input data were checked by matching the pressure differences mainly across the elevator doors and ward entrance doors. The initial simulations results did not match the measurement results well. It is assumed that the simulated values deviated from the measured values because the air leakage data of exterior walls of test building was not being estimated accurately and lobbies and basement floors had numerous doorways connected to the outdoor air. Therefore, the air leakage data were modified for the exterior walls, entrance doors located on lobbies and basement floors, and orifice area on the top of the elevator shafts, which is connected to the elevator machine room. The leakage data for the elevator, stairwell, and residential entrance doors, however, were not adjusted because they were based on tested values. When the elevator doors are operating under normal conditions, the initial simulation estimates that were used to analyze the air movements in the test hospital showed that the pressure differences in the first and second basement floors were about 8 Pa greater than the actual pressure difference measurements. Because of these differences between the simulation estimates and the field measurements of the pressure differences in the first and second basement floors, in the 20th floor, the simulation estimate was about 10 Pa higher than the field measurement. This shows that the input data in the connecting area, such as between the basement parking lot and the elevators, is probably incorrect. Accordingly, the input data for other floors were fixed and those for the basement were revised. The revision was carried out in the process of changing the air-tightness of the surface area and the infiltration volume data for the doors at the basement parking lot. Also, with the revision, the pressure difference in the first and second basement floors was compared with the field measurements and was reduced to less than 1 Pa. As the basement floors were revised, the gap between simulation and actual values for the 20th floor also naturally decreased. The differences between field measurements and estimates for elevator doors and ward entrance doors in all floors were less than 4 Pa and 1.5 Pa, respectively, which showed the reliability of the simulation. Fig. 8 compares the pressure differences across elevator doors and ward entrance doors, obtained by measurement and simulation. This figure shows that, in general, the simulation results match the measurement results well, except for a few floors. Based on the test hospital's CONTAMW input variables that were confirmed to be reliable, various proposals for analyzing the infectious airborne virus were made and applied, thus enabling diverse simulation tests.
