1. The concentration of 12 bleaches varied from 234 to 466PPM. 2. The average diluted concentration was 370 PPM. 1. Patients and visitors can compliance with hand hygiene and masks. There was no reported cluster infection in year of 2016. The rate of completing chest X-ray examination was above 95%. 2. The rate of compliance with hand hygiene correctly among staff is 100%. The results showed that GNES could inhibit RANKLinduced ROS production and the formation of osteoclast. Moreover, GNES treatment decreased the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic-1 (NFATc1), a master regulator of osteoclast differentiation, and of osteoclast marker such as cathepsin K. In addition, GNES impaired the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Conclusion: Our data suggested that GNES inhibited osteoclastogenesis through downregulation of RANKL-induced ROS production by HO-1 upregulation. Salmonella grouping, analysis of 284 strains of Salmonella, type B has 85 strains (30%), type C has 66 strains (23%), type D has 83 strains (29%), E type has 47 strains (17%), unidentified (non-PolyA-I & Vi) type has 3 strains (1%). 284 strains of Salmonella is isolated from bile, blood, pus, feces and urine, which account for 88% of feces, 8% blood, and 2% urine. We analyzed a routine antibiotic susceptibility testing of ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftriaxone, ertapenem,imipenem, levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfame. Ampicillin/sulbactam had 55% susceptibility, ceftriaxone had 69% susceptibility, ertapenem had 100% susceptibility, Imipenem had 100% susceptibility, levofloxacin had 70% susceptibility, and trimethoprim/sulfame had 69% susceptibility. Conclusion: O antigen group of Salmonella, found to have various types, not more often type have been separated, they mainly isolated from the feces, and in the antibiotic susceptibility test part of the carbapenem class (Imipenem, Imipenem) has 100% susceptibile, fluoquinolone drugs (levofloxacin) has 70% susceptibile, other drug also has more than 50% susceptibile testing. Salmonella is one of the most common causes of food poisoning. Symptoms of salmonellosis are mild and patients recover without specific treatment in most cases. However, in children and elderly patients, the associated dehydration become severe and lifethreatening. Antimicrobial resistance of salmonella have emerged,the right antibiotic choice is very important. Catheter-related urinary tract infection in 2015.01∼2016.03 for 5.95‰, after intervention in 2016.04∼ 2017.03 reduce to 3.61‰ (P-value = 0.0001). Conclusion: The Infection Control Committee has identified effective measures in the Infection Control Manual and will reduce the catheter-related urinary tract infection as a continuous monitoring quality indicator. The study results revealed that the patients in the experimental group significantly reduced the VAP. The average rates of VAP were 0.94 ‰ (n = 1061) in 2015, post VAP bundle care, the average VAP rate was zero tolerance (0 ‰, n = 1191) in 2016. The rate of staff confidence in VAP care knowledge and compliance with ventilator care bundle practices were significantly increased, from 25% and 33.3% in the pre-intervention stage to 83.3% and 91.6% in the post-intervention stage. The accuracy rate of RASS sedation evaluation was increased from 0% to 82.6%. Moreover, the sedation patients reached the RASS clinical recommendation level ratio increased from 9% to 87%. Not only reduce iatrogenic injury, but also enhance the use of sedative safety care. Continued tracking to July 2017, VAP density is still zero tolerance. Conclusion: Through the team resource management, the establishment of VAP bundle care, and design of nursing information system, include slogans tips, so that be able to provide the prompts and operation to ensure that the correctness of the clinical care process and monitoring mechanisms to enhance care accuracy rate, achieving the goal of "zero tolerance" of VAP, to enhance the patient safety.
