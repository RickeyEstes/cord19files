Lesions in the placenta are primarily confined to the cotyledon and consist of acute necrotic placentitis, which does not appear to penetrate to either the amnion or allantoic surface. On histologic examination, the most distinctive lesion in the placenta consists of severe fibrinoid necrosis and thrombosis of large and small arteries. The cellular infiltrate in vessel walls and adjacent villi is mainly macrophages with some neutrophils. There is sparing of veins and capillaries. Colonies of bacteria are visible next to the trophoblast cells. Lesions in the fetus are usually sparse; however, acute fibrinous bronchopneumonia is occasionally observed. On histology, airways are seen to contain degenerating mononuclear cells, macrophages, but few neutrophils. Bacteria are frequently observed adjacent are similar to those in lambs. Waddlia chondrophila, another member of the order Chlamydiales, is also responsible for abortion in cattle. Chlamydiaceae may be an under-recognized cause of reproductive failure in swine. To establish Chlamydophila as the cause of an abortion in cattle or sheep, the organism should be demonstrated in a smear (preferably of placenta) stained by a modified Ziehl-Neelsen, Gimenez, or Giemsa method. The organism can also be demonstrated in sections from the diseased placenta by using a specific fluorescent antibody test or immunohistochemistry. The presence of specific antibody in the fetus is confirmative, but antibody is not always present. Demonstration of antibody in the dam is of little use as a large proportion of cattle and sheep have been exposed and test positive. Specific monoclonal antibodies are available to detect antigens of known pathogenic strains of Chlamydophila, but detection of chlamydial DNA is now widely available. The organism can be grown on appropriate cell lines on coverslips, fixed, stained, and examined within 3 days. lambs. If she is infected in the later part of pregnancy, abortion will occur in the next pregnancy. A ewe that aborts will not abort again, but can carry the organism for several years. Extensive losses (75%) may occur on introduction of the organism to a flock, and yearly abortion rates of 5% are common when it exists in the enzootic form. Retention of fetal membranes may occur in some animals, and aborting females may occasionally be ill. The placenta resembles that seen in bovine brucellosis, and there is patchy, almost equal involvement of cotyledons and intercotyledonary regions. Affected cotyledons are a dull-clay or dark-red color, firm, and matted with a dirty-red exudate (Fig. 4-75) . The intercotyledonary region is red to brown and has irregular patches of edema amidst a dry, leathery thickening of the chorioallantois. These thickenings are often concentrated in ridges, which on histology are seen to consist of medium to large vessels prominent because of marked vasculitis. The vasculitis is characterized by fibrinoid necrosis of the media with a moderate to heavy infiltrate of neutrophils and some mononuclear cells (Fig. 4-76) . In the chorion, there is superficial necrosis, and characteristic inclusions can be seen in the cytoplasm of trophoblast cells. Abortion is likely the result of several factors, including tissue destruction by C. abortus, vasculitis, thrombosis, and a fetal inflammatory response. Production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) by fetal macrophages that express major histocompatibility complex II molecules may be significant in the pathogenesis of abortion. The fetus is usually well preserved but may have few gross lesions. These consist of scattered hemorrhages in the subcutis, thymus, lymph nodes, and muscles. The liver is sometimes swollen and has pinpoint yellow foci on the surface. Histologic lesions in the fetus are minimal. There may be focal areas of coagulative necrosis in the liver and spleen. These foci consist of as few as 5 cells, stain pale pink, and are variably surrounded by scant mononuclear cells. Throughout the liver and concentrated in portal areas, there may be an increase in mononuclear cells. In the lung, alveolar septa are thickened by mononuclear cells. Mild meningoencephalitis with vasculitis and hemorrhage has also been reported. Cattle do carry C. pecorum in the intestine, as do sheep, and the organism in the intestine can produce abortion. Abortions in cattle are usually sporadic, occurring throughout the year, with occasional outbreaks in isolated herds. Fetal lesions microcolonies can be seen in conventionally stained sections, but must be distinguished from similar colonies formed by Chlamydophila organisms. With H&E stains, Chlamydophila inclusions tend to stain poorly and appear more homogeneous, whereas cells containing Coxiella frequently have a characteristic foamy appearance with multiple unstained vacuoles within a pale blue cytoplasm. The nucleus, if visible, is usually pushed against the cell wall and assumes a crescent shape. The histologic lesions in affected fetuses are usually modest. Granulomatous hepatitis and nonsuppurative pneumonia with occasional focal lymphoid accumulations around bronchioles have been described. A few lymphocytes and macrophages may infiltrate the renal medulla and surround the portal vessels of the liver. Bovine fetuses may also be aborted as a result of Coxiella infections. The lesion in the placenta is characteristic and similar to that observed in sheep and goats. Care must be taken in attributing the simple presence of Coxiella as sufficient evidence for the cause of abortion. Animals may carry the organism for a prolonged period and, although they appear to abort only once, there may be large numbers of organisms in the placenta in subsequent pregnancies. Assessment of the extent of the placental lesion may be helpful. Diagnosis is routinely based on the characteristic placental lesions and the appearance of the organism in impression smears stained by a modified acid-fast technique. More definitive methods using direct or indirect fluorescent antibody techniques and tests to detect Coxiella DNA are available. Co-infection with Chlamydophila and Toxoplasma is common in sheep and goats. Cutoff points may assist in determining if the infection is relevant to abortion, but correlation with lesions is always advised. 


Section:death of the fetus after infection is usually rapid, resulting in the abortion of a severely autolysed fetus.
