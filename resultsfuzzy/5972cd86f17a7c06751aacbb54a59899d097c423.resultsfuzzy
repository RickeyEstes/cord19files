We used the available implementation [19] (https://github.com/willferreira/mscproject) with certain preparation steps for medical hoax dataset. The classifier with headlines features gives varied performances in all stances (Table 2) , although claim-headlines features have consistent results in the against class (Table 3) . It confirms that aligning phrase or words using Paraphrase Database (PPDB) between the claim and the headline is necessary for vague language. Hedging or vague texts are common in the headline instances of observing class. Some misclassified data sample are presented in Table 2 . The same misclassified texts for headlines are also found in Table 3 . In the other hand, accuracy value for the instances of against class is consistent between headline feature (Table 2 ) and claim-headline feature ( Table 3 ). This happens because in the instances of against class, the article contents show similar stance with the article headlines. Table 2 shows the instances of against class have better accuracy value compare to others, while the instances of observing class have better precision value, and the instances of for class have better recall value. This happens because the headline texts are usually short. Therefore, further works on a better understanding of semantic meaning in the article is needed to obtain a better stance. This ongoing research focuses on stance classification, as a preliminary research on hoax analysis. After the stance classification is done accurately, the next step will be on hoax classification.
