Results from Gao et al. Fig. 9 . Re-entry ratios of tracer gas from the source at a lower floor in a slab-like building with various wind speeds. The wind speeds were taken at 10 m above the ground level by Gao et al. [29] , while the wind speeds were obtained based on the wind data monitored outside the window, 1.6 m away from the façade of the building by Niu and Tung [26] . Quantification of the buoyancy effects caused by wall heating is extremely challenging due to the involvement of various complex processes: C The building surface temperature is strongly related to the urban surface condition, which is determined by the energy balance between: 1) the sensible and latent heat fluxes transferred to the air, 2) the received net radiation (shortwave and long-wave), 3) the heat storage into the building materials and the ground, and 4) anthropogenic heat sources [91e93], as shown in Fig. 10(a) . C The energy-balance characteristics mentioned above vary with latitude of the city, built form, urban geometry, and surface materials [94e96]. C The heat transfer around a building in the residential microclimate is affected by: 1) heat convection between outdoor air, building surfaces, ground and plants, 2) radiation including solar radiation, sky long-wave radiation and longwave radiation between ground and building surfaces, 3) heat conduction into the building and ground, and 4) latent heat transfer in the residential environment [97] , as shown in Fig. 10(b) . Therefore, different surfaces may generate turbulence and transfer energy, momentum and moisture at different rates, causing the overlying airflows and boundary layer structure to be highly stochastic and dynamic. In order to evaluate the wall thermal boundary condition around a building, it is necessary to consider the total (atmosphere þ buildings þ ground) thermal energy balance and their interactions. However, there has been less conclusive work on this case, partly due to the difficulty in resolving or parameterizing the thermal boundary layers on building surfaces in simulations [98] , and the challenges in capturing heat transfer processes on the building and district scales [99] . Nevertheless, it is important to address these technical issues because of the increased emphasis on accurate modeling of building and ground surface temperature and near-ground atmospheric boundary layer. Many field observations and numerical modeling have been made in order to understand the effects of building surface heating in the urban canopy on the canyon flow and pollutant dispersion [89,100e105] , although some ambiguous or even opposing conclusions can be found. It is important to note that a thin thermallydriven updraft was demonstrated near the walls [89] , and the thermal effects on the flow pattern and dispersion were suggested to be considerable in the location very near the heated walls [101, 102] . Since the inter-flat dispersion routes are mainly embedded in the flows near the building surfaces, the buoyancy effects caused by heated walls may largely affect the re-entry phenomenon and alter the inter-flat dispersion characteristics. Therefore, in order to take care of the thermal boundary condition and accurately predict the re-entry possibility, grid resolution in the computations need to be extremely fine and advanced near-wall models (e.g. wall functions) need to be further developed.
