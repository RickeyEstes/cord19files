After introducing a framework, we present sections on China's work in health aid, health security, health governance, and knowledge exchange. China's participation in global health has deep historical roots, not only just in recent years. In the fi rst millennium, knowledge of medical cures were transmitted by the Silk Road that facilitated exchange between China, India, the Middle East, and Europe. 9 In the 20th century, some Chinese health crises such as the Manchurian plague epidemic captured the attention of neighbouring countries of the international community. 10 China has historically been the origin of many infectious epidemics and a source of key health innovations of breakthroughs such as the barefoot doctor (a term that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, which refers to farmers who received minimal basic medical and paramedical training and worked in rural China to promote basic hygiene, preventive health care, family planning, and treat common illnesses. The name comes from southern farmers, who would often work barefoot in the rice paddies), and artemisinin, an eff ective antimalaria drug developed from plant-based Chinese traditional medicine. 11, 12 Because there is no universal consensus for the defi nition of global health, some approaches focus on transnational health risks, which lie beyond the reach of national governments, whereas other approaches stress the global commitment and responsibility to address health inequities and to support health. 13 We have adopted a framework of global health as characterised by health and related transnational fl ows of diseases, people, money, knowledge, technologies, and ethical values. [14] [15] [16] Four domains capture these globalisation processes (fi gure 1). First, health aid aims to advance global health equity. It is the traditional area of offi cial development assistance (ODA) coordinated by organisation for economic cooperation and development (OECD) countries. Second, global health security should be ensured by management of interdependence in global health and mutual protection against shared and transferred risks, such as epidemic diseases. Third, health governance is needed for global stewardship to set ground rules as mediated by health diplomacy. Fourth, knowledge exchange is needed, which includes the sharing of lessons and knowledge production, ownership, and application worldwide. Knowledge centrally aff ects all four pillars of global health, and global health governance is recognised to be central to all four domains (fi gure 1). On the basis of this framework, China's modern timeline might be demarcated by fi ve landmarks. First, in 1963, China sent its fi rst overseas medical team to Algeria, followed 6 years later by the donation of its fi rst hospital in Tanzania. 17 The explicitly articulated purpose of China's health aid was to further political solidarity as part of China's foreign policy. Second was China's economic openings after 1978, which launched the dramatic transformation of China from a low-income to a middle-income country, leading to China qualifying as an aid recipient followed by increasingly becoming an aid donor. 17 Third, starting from 2000, China has hosted a series of Forums on China-Africa Cooperation, with each forum announcing yet another major aid pledge-eg, hospital construction, malaria control, and high education scholarships (2007-09); training of health workers and artemisinin drug donation (2010-12); and brightness action (eye care) campaign (2013-15). 18, 19 Fourth, global engagement greatly accelerated after 2001 when China entered the World Trade Organization (WTO), an event that marked China's joining almost all international bodies. Finally, and perhaps most dramatically, the 2003 severe acute repiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic underscored both China's neglect of its health sector and the reality that China's global trade cannot be done without mutual health protection. 20
