A consensus sequence of strain I0636/16 was obtained and the fulllength genome consisted of 27,629 nucleotides excluding the 3′ poly A tails. ORF analysis predicted ten ORFs, resulting in a typical IBV genome organization of 5′UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-3c(E)-M-5a-5b-N-3′UTR. In addition, there was also an ORF with the potential to code for a protein of 94 amino acids between gene M and 5a of strain I0636/16 which was identified previously in some IBV strains (Bentley et al., 2013) . Phylogenetic analysis of 121 complete genomes was conducted to investigate the relationships between the obtained strain I0636/16 and different avian coronaviruses downloaded from GenBank. Strain I0636/ 16 was grouped together with all the IBV strains used in this study, which had been isolated from different regions at various times but was grouped apart from coronaviruses isolated from other avian species (Fig. 1B) . Within IBV strains, I0636/16 showed close relationships with IBV strains LGX/111119 (93.5%), CK/CH/GD/GZ14 (93.1%), I0114/14 (92.8%), CK/CH/2010/JT-1 (92.8%), GX-YL9 (92.4%), and GX-YL5 (92.1%), most of which were isolated from South China, particularly from Guangxi province. We investigated the impact of probable recombination events on the origin of strain I0636/16 by conducting an analysis using SimPlot software ( Fig. 2A) . Two major recombination events were observed, one in the 3′ end of Gene 1 (at approximately nucleotide 20,265) and another in the 5′ end of Gene 3 (at approximately nucleotide 24,152). The phylogenetic trees (Fig. 2B ) clearly supported the SimPlot results, with strain I0636/16 showing identities of > 96.6% with LGX/111119, CK/CH/GD/GZ14, I0114/14, CK/CH/2010/JT-1, GX-YL9, and GX-YL5 for the genomic region 1-20,265, compared with an identity of < 86.9% with the Mass-type strains. Similar to this genomic region, I0636/16 showed an identity of 92.5% with LGX/111119 for the genomic region 24,152-27,640, compared with < 85.2% with the Mass-type strains. These results suggested that the LGX/111119 (GI-28 lineage) virus, circulating in chicken flocks in China , was a potential parent of recombinant I0636/16. In contrast, in the second phylogenetic tree, the branch (genomic region 20,266-24,151) that included the spike gene separated the strain I0636/16 from all reference strain sequences, and shared no more than 75% nucleotide identity with any of the reference strains, making difficult to assess the origin of the fragment 24,152-27,629. BLASTn analysis using this fragment of I0623/16 showed that this strain was closely related to strain GX-NN130021 (97% nucleotide identity), but shared no more than 75% nucleotide identity with any other IBV strain in the GenBank database. Overall, these data suggest that GVII-1 viruses emerged as a result of replacement of the spike gene in strain LGX/111119-like viruses (GI-28) through recombination.
