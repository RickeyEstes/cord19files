Compounds described in this report were prepared as outlined in Scheme 1. The synthesis of desired 4-aminoquinoline compounds (2e11) were prepared by aromatic nucleophilic substitution on 7-substituted-4-chloro-quinoline (1) using excess of monoaminoalkane/diaminoalkane in neat conditions with a simple standard work-up procedure as described previously [16] . The alkyl aminoquinoline derivatives (2,3) were prepared by refluxing 7-substituted-4-chloro-quinoline with butyl amine in neat conditions. The aminoquinoline compound (4) was synthesized by refluxing 4,7-dichloroquinoline with an excess of ethane-1,2-diamine in which the temperature was raised slowly and maintained at 80 C over 1 h while stirring. The temperature was raised further to 130 C and maintained at that temperature for 7 h with continuous stirring. The dimethyl alkyl aminoquinoline derivatives (5e9) were also synthesized by a single-step reaction, in which appropriate 7-substituted-4-chloro-quinoline reacts with N,N-dimethylalkyl-diamine in neat conditions. The bisquinoline compounds (10, 11) were obtained by excess of 7-substituted-4-chloroquinoline reacting with one mole of alkyl diamine during which the temperature was kept at 130 C for 6 h. The mass spectra of all the synthesized compounds were in conformity with their assigned structures. The mass spectra of these compounds showed molecular ion peaks corresponding to their molecular formulas (Table 1) . Elemental (C, H, N) analysis satisfactorily confirmed elemental compositions and the purity of the synthesized compounds (Table 1) NMR spectra of these compounds (Table 2) have been found to be in agreement with their assigned structures. All the compounds synthesized were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against two cancer cell lines derived from human breast tumors. The drugs at the concentration of 100 mM were diluted to 1.625 mM by two-fold serial dilutions. Following the incubation for 48 h in a drug, the cells were treated with SRB to measure their growth/viability (% of the untreated control) using a spectrophotometer as described previously [17] . The reading of SRB staining is known to accurately reflect the levels of total cellular macromolecules [17] . The GI 50 concentration for each derivative was calculated with reference to a standard curve (control cells), which represents the concentration that results in a 50% decrease in cell growth after 3 days of incubation. For each compound, the 50% growth inhibition (GI 50 ) was determined and reported in Table 3 . The data for CQ, amodiaquine and mefloquine were included for comparison. The data showed that these derivatives have significant cytotoxicity against the cell lines screened. Among the nine compounds tested, two compounds showed a GI 50 range of 7.35e8.73 mM against MDA-MB468 cells, and one compound showed a GI 50 at 8.22 mM against MCF-7 cells. The remaining seven compounds showed GI 50 values above the 10.85 mM, but not more than 13.72 mM against MDA-MB468 cells. In the case of MCF-7 cells, the six compounds tested showed GI 50 in the range of 11.52e14.47 mM, the remaining two compounds showed GI 50 values above 36.77 mM, but not more than 51.57 mM. The differences in the GI 50 values may be attributable to factors such as the nature of substitution at the seventh positions, the side-chains, and the genetic and biochemical background of the cell lines. As for compound 2, the replacement of the chloro group with a fluoro group (3) led to an increase in cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-468 cells. It also showed a similar result with MCF-7 cells. In case of the aminoquinoline compound 4 (GI 50 ¼ 11.01 mM), cytotoxicity increased by 2-fold in comparison to CQ (GI 50 ¼ 24.36 mM) against MDA-MB-468 cells. With MCF-7 cell lines, however, the compound 4 showed lower cytotoxicity (GI 50 ¼ 51.57 mM) than CQ (GI 50 ¼ 20.72 mM). The dimethyl alkyl aminoquinoline derivatives with the 7-chloro substitution of compound 5 showed drastically increased (5-fold) cytotoxicity (GI 50 ¼ 8.73 mM) against MDA-MB-468 cells in comparison to CQ. However, replacement of the chloro group with a fluoro (6, GI 50 ¼ 11.47 mM), trifluoromethyl (7, GI 50 ¼ 12.85 mM) and a methoxy group (8, GI 50 ¼ 14.09 mM) led to a decrease in cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-468 cells. Interestingly, in the MCF-7 cell lines, these results were in reverse order, and the compound substituted with a chloro group (5, GI 50 ¼ 36.77 mM) was less active in comparison to that of substituted with a methoxy group (8, GI 50 ¼ 12.90 mM). The bisquinoline compound 10 (GI 50 ¼ 7.35 mM) showed 3-fold increased activity in MDA-MB-468 cells, compared to CQ. It is interesting to note that the same compound showed lower activity (GI 50 ¼ 14.80 M) in the MCF-7 cell line. Compound 11 is insoluble in DMSO; therefore, we were not able to examine cytotoxicity on cultured cells. Further structural modifications are in progress to increase specificity and cytotoxicity on cancer cells by 4-aminoquinoline derivatives.
