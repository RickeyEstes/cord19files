Tables 1 and 2 display the simulation results before and after the implementation of RFID respectively. For soiled linens process, the improved process took 5.04 min longer. The initial process took an average of 39.19 min (Table 1) while the process with RFID took an average of 44.23 min ( Table 2 ). The increase in timing is due to the additional process-Transfer to Conveyor and the station-Conveyor (see Fig. 5 ). Thus, with a slight trade-off in timing, the process with RFID implementation provides visibility for the soiled linens out to SCORE. The average waiting time for the Open Cage Limit Queue is 44.07 min and is the most time consuming. As the Open Cage Limit is set at a larger value of 90, more time is needed for the Open Cage to be filled and proceed to the next stage. Thus, the longer waiting time of 41.22 min is expected even after the RFID implementation. Moreover, as the chute capacity is set at 50 bags of linen, the average waiting time for the Chute Limit Queue is also time consuming (26.2 min) and has decreased slightly to 25.3 min after RFID implementation. The waiting times at other stations have also decreased (see Tables 1 and 2) . Tables 3 and 4 display the simulation results before and after the implementation of RFID respectively. For clean linens process, the time taken for the clean linens before RFID implementation is 339.75 min (Table 3) while that after RFID implementation is 371.23 min (Table 4 ). With the additional processes -Unload to Shelf and Scan Linens when collected and stations-Conveyor (see Fig. 7 ), the process took 31.48 min more to be completed. Time delay is due to the scanning of the RFID tags on each individual packed linen when unloaded into the shelf and when linens are needed in the wards. This time delay of 31þ minutes will increase the labour cost by $20 per day considering a staff hourly wage of $38. For the clean linens process before RFID implementation, the numbers of packed linens is not recorded. In the process after RFID implementation, the packed linens are counted and recorded. From Table 4 , the packed linens out is recorded as 2247.79. This figure is the number of packed linens requested and scanned by the personnel for patients' usage. It is less than the 6300 packed clean linens input, as some of the packed clean linens might be kept in the Shelf and stored, while others might still be in process. Prior to RFID implementation, AGVs delivered the daily linens requirements of the hospital wards and did not account for the unused linens from the wards. This resulted into the department keeping a higher pile level as compared to a replenishment system where the AGVs only needed to replenish the used linens in the wards. Personnel scan when collect linens (after RFID implementation) took a longer average waiting time (273.24 min in Table 4 ) than personnel collect linens (155.96 min in Table 3 ) before RFID implementation. The reason for this longer wait time might be due to the newly implemented RFID system. As all personnel need to scan the linens when collecting for patients' usage, they might not be familiar with the new computer interface and process and thus time is lost. Furthermore, the waiting times for metal trolley limit queue has dropped from 9.22 to 5.74 min, for transfer to metal trolley queue has dropped from 78.32 to 35.66 min, and for unload to linen room queue has dropped from 57.17 to 23.7 min after RFID implementation. The areas of opportunity assessed when evaluating the existing system could be efficiently and effectively improved with RFIDenabled system. For example, linens department nurses and clerks would not need any longer to go to the shelf to validate if there are linens available. Various repetitive and duplicate activities could be eliminated since real-time information on linens inventory are collected through the RFID-enabled linens tracking system. The new RFID-enabled system provides information on linens availability rate, activities utilization rate and is able to fulfil the following requirements: -account for the total soiled linens sent out to sub-contractor, -account for daily linens usage of each ward, -account for the total cleaned linens sent back from subcontractor, -account for total stock on shelf and in circulation, -account for losses from sub-contractor and wards, -improve real-time monitoring and management of linens, -improve productivity and efficiency by reducing the time hospital staff spends in locating misplaced linens, -reduce overbuying, and eliminate costly replacement of lost or stolen linens, and -reduce delays in patient care due to lost or stolen linens. Several unnecessary manual activities or duplications in the existing system and the inefficiencies such as recurrent inventory shortage of linens at the central warehouse, wasted staff time searching for the linens and lack of visibility can be eliminated. Indeed, accessibility to linens and other critical resources allows nurses and other staff to respond more efficiently and faster to clinical events, and therefore improves patient care and the patient experience. Although the process time increases with the introduction of the RFID stations, the increased inventory visibility and a potential reduction of overbuying and or replacement of linens (on the average 8 linens per day based on a quarterly loss of 12%) and resulting decrease in cost (around $160 ¼ $20 * 8 linens per day), elimination of wasted staff time searching for the linens, and improved quality of patient care and the patient experience outweigh the increase in process time. Moreover, an array of benefits offered by RFID technology is intangible, and therefore cannot be simply measured through traditional methods such as return on investment. The other indirect benefits of deploying RFID system in the Linens Department are reduced workload for nurses in the following activities: -reduced vital signs taking time, -reduced searching time of linens. -reduced unnecessary phone calls between departments, -reduced administrative work, and -improved operational workflow. Now, nurses do not have to make phone calls, to check where the linens are, or if a linen is on the way to the ward, they can find the real-time location of the linens from the dashboard. Overall benefits for the Hospital are: -reduced transcribing errors, -improved operational efficiency, -improved visibility in the resources availability, -improved accessibility to information, and -enhanced market perception. Hospital management also acknowledged cost savings due to deployment of RFID which is integrated with hospital system and workflow.
