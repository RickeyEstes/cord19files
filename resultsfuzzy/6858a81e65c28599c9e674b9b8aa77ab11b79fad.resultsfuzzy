BLAST results and multiple sequence alignments BLAST predicted MgβADR1 (PDB ID: 2Y00) [35] as the best match for hsβADR1 with 68% identity and 75% positivity (with an e-value of 3×10 -165 ). 2R4R, 3KJ6, 3P0G and 2RH1 have 79% while 2R4S and 3SN6 have 74% query coverage, more sequence coverage than observed for 2Y00 (73%). Since 2R4R, 3KJ6 and 24RS are available as apo form with fewer scores, identity and positive values, these structures were not used in this study. Similarly, the complexes 3P0G, 2RH1 and 3SN6 were not used for the modeling of hsβADR1 structure due to their lower scores. Hence, 2Y00 is used according to the BLAST results but to establish more confidence on the top-ranked search, we opted for two sorts of multiple sequence alignments: raw multiple sequence alignment and manually-edited multiple sequence alignment. For raw alignment, the ten top-ranked templates sequences (2Y00, 2VT4, 2R4R, 3KJ6, 2R4S, 3SN6, 4GBR, 3P0G, 2RH1 and 3PDS) were aligned against the target sequence illustrated in S2 Fig and S1 Table. For manually-edited alignment, both the target and template (2Y00) sequences were truncated. The first 50 residues from N-terminus and 84 residues (393-477) from C-terminus were omitted from the target sequence due to the absence of corresponding homologous sequence in the template and has no important residue which is necessary to be in helical segments. The template sequence has 483 amino acid residues whereas the structure of 33-368 residues has been resolved (total 315 residues as some residues are missing). The first 3 residues (33-36) from N-terminus and 14 residues (337-351) from C-terminus were omitted. Finally, 342 residues of target sequence was aligned with ten top-ranked BLAST search, 2Y00 (297 residues), 2VT4, 2R4R, 3KJ6, 2R4S, 3SN6, 4GBR, 3P0G, 2RH1 and 3PDS The average alignment score for manually edited multiple sequence alignment is better (76.47) than the score obtained by raw multiple sequence alignment (74.89). Overall, there are 15 instances where alignments are improved, 7 alignments are improved when the target sequence is aligned with the rest of the sequences and 8 times the alignments have better quality when the template sequence is aligned with the remaining sequences. The generalized Ballesteros and Weinstein numbering scheme is beneficial for the understanding, recognition and structural alignments of GPCRs family [32] . The Ballesteros and Weinstein numbering is illustrated in (Fig 2) and the conserved amino acid residues of class A GPCRs is tabulated in Table 3 . Ballesteros and Weinstein numbering is useful for the understanding of integrating methods for the construction of 3D models and computational probing of structure-function relations in GPCRs. These criteria pertain to the selection of correct inputs for the a1ignment programs and to structural considerations applicable to checking and refining the sequence alignments generated by alignment programs. This selection criterion depends on the information that is determined by the extent of homology among the compared sequences. Alignment of sequences with intermediate homologies (i.e., 30-70%) can identify continuous patterns of conservation distributed over the entire sequence. Such patterns provide structural inferences based on conservation.
