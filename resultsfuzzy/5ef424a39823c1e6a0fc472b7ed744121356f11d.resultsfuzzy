The human immune system has evolved to respond very quickly and effectively to infectious challenges long after the primary infection has been resolved [65] [66] [67] [68] . This immune memory is essentially a quick response capability that avoids the much slower process of the original immune reaction that ultimately gives rise to affinity maturation and an antibody repertoire. With memory, the antibody repertoire can be brought to bear in a matter of days, rather than weeks and months [65] [66] [67] [68] . Whereas this rapid response can be essential to preventing repeated infections, it does however have some drawbacks that have provided the opportunity for certain viruses to continually establish successful infections. This susceptibility has to do with the characteristics of the initial immune response and the subsequent inability of the memory response to adequately broaden the repertoire of antibodies in the face of an infection by a similar or mutated strain. In essence, the diversity of a secondary immune response can be compromised by the dominance of the original immune response [69] [70] [71] . The first description of this phenomenon was published 60 years ago and was referred to as "original antigenic sin" (OAS) [72] . After an influenza virus infection, antibody produced after re-infection or vaccination with a related strain of virus is apparently still directed against the first strain that resulted in an immune response [73] . In other words, there was a recall of the first influenza virus experienced. This phenomenon, in which the immune system commits itself to the viral variant initially present and continues to make antibodies against the image of this virus even when contemporaneous virus has effectively shed this image, has been observed after infection by a number of viruses [36, 37, 74] . What stops the immune system from continually producing high-affinity neutralizing antibodies against emergent viral variants is not entirely clear. One potential consequence of OAS is simply a lack of an adequate immune response to mutated virus. In addition, OAS presents a risk of the elicitation of Abs that could potentially enhance disease severity by enhancing viral infection. A prime example where this mechanism has been invoked is dengue virus. In the case of dengue, Abs derived from an initial immune response may act as agents that exacerbate disease by increasing the cellular uptake of viruses, resulting in higher viremia, a phenomenon termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [38] . While ADE has been the leading theory to explain the observation of increased risk of severe disease upon a secondary infection from a heterologous serotype, recent studies in humans have called into question ADE as the principal mechanism of increased disease risk [39, 75, 76] . Additionally, modifications to antibody Fc regions that disrupt antibody interaction with Fc receptors have been shown to be effective strategies in preventing ADE-mediated lethal disease in a mouse model [77] . In spite of the apparent drawbacks of OAS, it has been shown that individuals can mount immune responses to an HIV infection that have all the hallmarks of an OAS response and nonetheless manage to generate bnAbs that coevolve with the mutating virus. A recent study followed this evolution in a single infected individual over a three year period [78] . In spite of the propensity for matured bnAbs to maintain neutralizing activity against the founder virus, potential viral escape mutations in the vicinity of the bnAb epitope were nonetheless neutralized due to bnAbs gaining neutralization breadth during affinity maturation. Clinical and Developmental Immunology 3 OAS therefore is a complex immune response that can result in production of effective neutralizing Abs in some cases.
