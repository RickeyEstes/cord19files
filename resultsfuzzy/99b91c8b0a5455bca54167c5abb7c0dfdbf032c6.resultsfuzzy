To test the generality of our method, we searched the literature for a second pathogen with complete PDB structures of antigens, well-defined epitope areas, and large-scale experimental data (serum titer or mono-Ab binding). In the end, the antisera data of dengue virus (DENV) from a large-scale study on African green monkey were collected from Leah's lab 12 to validate our algorithm. In Leah's experiments, titers were provided for 36 sera samples derived from monkeys injected with corresponding vaccine strains against 47 tested strains of four different DENV serotypes. After removing uninterpretable data, including undone and self-reactive titers <10, the remained data of 1072 strain pairs were included as our validation set. 47 envelope (E) sequences were retrieved according to Genbank ID provided by the paper 12 and 7 antigenic sites were collected from Pitcher' report 13 . Finally, structures were modeled for CE-BLAST analysis by following the guideline of our method. It was noted that titer value in influenza case can be transformed in to D ab , and D ab above 4 is widely accepted as a threshold of antigenic drift. But no such threshold can be retrieved in DENV case. According to experimental results 12 , over 90% of self-reactive titer value is over 20. Under such circumstances, three different values of 15, 20 and 40 were tentatively chosen as classification thresholds for further testing. Accordingly, the classification results of CE-BLAST achieved AUC value of 0.857, 0.894 and 0.899 respectively on the 1072 data (Figure-Response5) . Secondly, the experimental antigenicity between DENV strains was mapped into Figure 5A -B by MDS method 1 after data cleaning and normalization (See ONLINE METHOD section). The overall antigenicity distance showed that serotype 1 is the closest to serotype 4 whereas serotype 2 is the furthest from the others. The topologies of antigenic clustering between those 47 strains were next examined and illustrated in Figure 5C according to CE-BLAST scores. The four serotypes of DENV can be predicted and clustered respectively by CE-BLAST. Meanwhile, our results showed that serotype 1 was firstly clustered with serotype 4, and then followed by serotype 3 and 2. This fully matched with the antigenic mapping of experimental titers accomplished by MDS 1 (Figure 5A-B) . Within each individual serotype group, CE-BLAST results also agree well with experimental results. Taking serotype 1 as an example, strain DENV1/Vietnam/2008-BID-V1937 (DENV1-V1937) in Figure 5C was firstly clustered with DENV1/Thailand/1964/16007 (DENV1-T16007), and then with DENV1/Myanmar/2005/61117 (DENV1-M61117), followed by others. This topological structure indicates that the antigenicity of DENV1-V1937 is the closest to that of DENV1-T16007 and secondly to that of DENV1-M61117. Interestingly, Leah's results from either one-month or three-month post-infection sera confirmed our prediction that the titer values of DENV1-V1937 vs. DENV1-T16007 is the highest among all pairs of DENV1-V1937 vs. 47 tested strains, and followed by DENV1-M61117 with secondly high titer values 12 , indicating the close antigenicity between DENV1-V1937 and DENV1-T16007. We further did strain clustering according to sequence similarity or structure similarity of E antigens. In sequence-based clustering, serotype 1 was firstly clustered with serotype 3, and then followed by serotype 2 and 4 in Figure 5D , which disagree with Leah's experimental results. Importantly, the similarity between DENV1-V1937 and DENV1-T16007 cannot be inferred at all from the sequence-based method. In structure-based method, clustering tree was constructed based on RMSD of structure comparison 14 , with results displayed as Figure 5E . Similar to sequence clustering, structure clustering can suggest neither inter-serotype relationship nor the relative strain similarity within a DENV serotype. Therefore, CE-BLAST model seems to give the best inference of serological similarity comparing to sequence-or structure-based methods. Also, we added a new paragraph in ONLINE METHOD section in page 26:
