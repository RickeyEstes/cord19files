We selected 409 nouns as indicators of student understanding. The agreement between two independent experts who selected the words was over 80%, and their disagreements were resolved through discussion. After selecting the words, we created networks using KBDeX. First, we examined group differences in discourse between Groups A and D by comparing the network structures of notes (Fig 6) . We compared the mean BCs of notes across three different phases of collaborative learning between groups. A 2 (Group) × 3 (Phase) ANOVA on the mean BCs showed an interaction effect, F(3,198) = 9.7098, p < 0.01, indicating that there were no significant differences in mean BCs across phases in Group A, but BCs significantly decreased across phases in Group D (Fig 7) . Second, we examined individual student's contributions to the knowledge advancement by analyzing the network structure of words (Fig 8) . We calculated each individual's contribution by using stepwise analysis in KBDeX. The results of the analysis is shown in Fig 9. An 11 (Student) × 3 (Phase) ANOVA on the mean absolute values of changes in the BCs revealed an interaction effect, F(20, 374) = 7.06, p < .01, indicating that different students contributed to the discourse in different phases in Group A. On the other hand, a 12 (Student) × 3 (Phase) ANOVA revealed a significant effect both for Students, F(11, 204) = 2.21, p < .05, and for Phases, F(2, 408) = 17.60, p < .01, indicating that students had quite similar contribution patterns, with the exception of one student (Student #7).
