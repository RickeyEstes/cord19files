DCs do increase in number in the dLN, although whether this is due to specific recruitment of these cells or prevention of their egress is not known. DCs may play a role in the phenotypes observed. IRF5 is highly expressed in classical DCs (as the reviewer noted), pDCs, and B cells, although it can be induced in other cell types, including myeloid cells [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . We are working to cross Irf5 fl/fl mice with CD11c Cre mice or other Cre driver strains to determine the cell type requirement for IRF5 in ISG induction, monocyte activation, and the downstream phenotypes of LN disorganization and impaired dLN B cell responses. 


Section:the increased number of total cells following chikv af15561 infection reflects in an increase in the number of nearly all cell types examined, including b and t cells, without a corresponding increase in the percentage of total. this is consistent with higher levels of type i ifn in the dln of chikv af15561-infected mice compared with 181/25infected mice (unpublished results).
