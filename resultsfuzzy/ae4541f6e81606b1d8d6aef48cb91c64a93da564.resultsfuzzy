The chemical reaction for the surface-immobilized receptor (antibody) and the free ligand (antigen: the peptide) in bulk solution can be expressed as the following equations.  where K is the equilibrium constant for formula (1), K A is the association constant, and K D is the dissociation constant. [Ab] is the concentration of the unbound antibody immobilized on the sensor surface. [Ag] is the antigen concentration in the bulk solution. [Ab-Ag] is the concentration of the antibody-antigen complex on the sensor surface. To estimate the dissociation constant, the Langmuir isotherm equation was used to extract the dissociation constant. Here the current changes were introduced to the Langmuir equation for calculating the dissociation constant. where DI is the current change at the bulk concentration of antigen [Ag] , and DI max is the saturated current change. The dissociate constant can be extracted from the linear regression by using eq. (3), as shown in Fig. 4(a) . The y-axis and the x-axis are [Ag]/DI and [Ag], respectively. The slope and the y-intercept are 1=DI max and K D =DI max , respectively. The linefitting shown in Fig. 4 gives a very good linear regression correlation coefficient (r 2 ¼0.99992). The extracted maximum current change was about 1.91 mA, which is very close to the experimental observed one, 1.90 mA. The extracted dissociation constant was obtained as 1.37 Â 10 À 9 M, which is also in the reasonable range for most IGg antibody-antigen complexes (Dragusanu et al. 2010; Kim et al. 2012; Mitsakakis and Gizeli 2011) . The Langmuir equation shown in eq. (3) can be rearranged as the following expression.
