When contemplating a new class of 1,5-substituted isatin structure that could avoid the metabolically liabile acrylic acid ester group found in compound 5e61 while maintaining its biological potency, we envisaged a general structure compound 5e61 (Fig. 1 ) [14] . It can bear a various of aromatic groups at the C-5 position, that carry some structural similarity in terms of their size and conjugation property, whereas the in vivo Michael addition liability of the 5-acrylic acid ester group could be eliminated. As illustrated in Fig. 2 , with the isatin as the core structure of our drug design, this strategy would allow us to start with the modification of the substitution pattern of the benzene ring, especially at C-5, followed by N-derivatization and then C-3 variation. The in vitro antitumor activities of the 5-substituted isatins 1a-1k against two human tumor cells K562 and HepG2 were first evaluated. As shown in Table 1 , the cytotoxic activities of the 5phenyl substituted compounds are far better than the parent nucleus. Among them, compound 1i exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity against HepG2 cell lines (IC 50 Â¼ 0.96 mM). After compound 1i was identified as the potential lead, our SAR study was then focused on the N-derivatization based on the hypothesis that the combination of C-5 substitution with N-alkylation may further enhance their cytotoxic potency. A series of 5-(4methoxyphenyl) N-substituted derivatives (Scheme 1) were screened for their in vitro cytotoxic activity. As can be seen from the data in Table 2 , introduction of simple aliphatic groups at N-1 (2a-2c) did not significantly enhance their potency. Moreover, a p-methoxyphenyl group at N-1 significantly diminished the potency. However, the introduction of benzyl groups into the N-1 position (2d-2v) resulted in much better inhibitory activities, with 10e300 folds improvement compared to that of 1i, pointing to the tendency that the N-1 position needs a relatively sterically larger group with certain lipophilic property to increase the potency. Further examination of the structure difference and the cytotoxic data of the compounds 2d and 2f-2v against K562 showed that the substituted benzyl group did increase the potency. The improvement in potency does not seem to be related to the electron density of the substituent groups (2f, 2r and 2h, 2l); however, the substituents' size (2k, 2p) and location (2n and 2m, 2o) plays a more significant role. Moreover, the excellent cytotoxic activity for the compounds containing N-1 para or ortho mono methoxy benzyl group (2m, 2o), dimethoxy benzyl group (2q) as well as a piperonyl group (2v) indicated that hydrogen bond receptor in this direction of the molecule could significantly enhance the potency (8e25 folds, compared to that of 2d). With the identification of the p-methoxybenzyl group as an optimal substituent at N-1, our attention then turned back to the pmethoxyphenyl substitution on the benzene ring. Specifically, we were interested in finding out how the location would influence the cytotoxic potency. For this purpose, a series of isatins bearing pmethoxyphenyl group(s) at various position on the benzene ring were synthesized and their cytotoxic activities were examined. The compounds 3a-3c were synthesized following the procedure similar to that of 2m (Scheme 2) and their potency were listed in Table 3 . The 4-, 6-and 7-monosubstituted compounds 3a-3c exhibited much weaker potency than that of 2m (>220 folds), which may suggest that the N-1, C-5 disubstituted pattern in 2m possess a much favorable 2-dimensional orientation toward the biological targets. The SAR analysis of the compounds in Table 3 revealed that the N-(p-methoxybenzyl) and 5-(p-substituted phenyl) disubstituted isatins are the most attractive candidates, with compound 2m exhibiting the highest potency. To further investigate the activity of the structural analogues of 2m, a number of 5-aryl N-(p-methoxyphenyl)satins were prepared (Scheme 3) and their inhibition against two human tumor cells were tested ( Table 4 ). As shown in Table 4 , among all the 18 compounds examined, the cytotoxic activities of the phenyl analogue 4k, region-isomers 4a, 4b as well as the 3,5-dimethoxy-phenyl substituted compounds 4c exihibted a 5e25 folds decrease in potency compared to 2m, indicating that the para methoxy group is necessary and its linear orientation maybe a critical factor in maintaining its high potency. The halogen-containing compounds (4f, 4g, 4h), compounds (4i, 4j, 4l, 4m) possess either electron-donating or electronwithdrawing groups, all exhibit very similar inhibition, indicating that variation of the electron density at this position did not significantly change their potency. The excellent potency 5-(4-pyridyl) substituted compound 4q and 5-(2-thiophenyl) substituted compound 4r suggest that groups possessing a Lewis basic site could potentially improve the compound's activity. The hydroxyl group containing compound 4o did not exhibit any improved activity in comparison to compounds 2m, 4q and 4r. There was no significant potency change when the 5-phenyl substitution (4k) was replaced by 5-(4-methyphenyl) group (4i) or 5-(2-naphthyl) group (4p). However, the cytotoxic activity of the 5-(4-n-butyl)phenyl compound 4e dropped 15 folds from that of the non-substituted counterpart (4k), which indicated the bulky aliphatic chain is detrimental. Derivatization of the C-3 ketone group of 2m led to compounds 5a-5l (Scheme 4) and their cytotoxic activities were evaluated to establish the importance of this functionality. The testing result showed that all these derivatives are inferior candidates as inhibitors of K562 and HepG2 ( Table 5 ), suggesting that the carbonyl functionality at C-3 is essential in order to maintain the observed high antitumor activity. Based on these SAR studies, compound 2m exhibited significant cancer inhibitory activity in vitro against the tested cancer cell lines. The IC 50 of compounds 2m against K562 cells and HepG2 cells were 30 nM and 50 nM, respectively (Fig. 3A) . Meanwhile, a normal human cell line (umbilical vein endothelial cells, HUVEC) has been tested for 2m, the IC 50 was 920 nM. Then the molecular mechanism by which compound 2m exerts its cytotoxic activity on cells proliferation, migration and angiogenesis was further investigated. Firstly, the morphological changes in compound 2m-treated K562 cells were observed. K562 cells treated by compound 2m showed the cells morphology change of G 2 /M phase arrest (such as elongation of the cells) and typical apoptotic morphology (such as cell shrinkage and/or blebbing) (Fig. 3B ). As shown in Fig. 3B , the elongated cells increased significantly as early as 6 h after compound 2m treatment at a concentration of 30 nM as compared to
