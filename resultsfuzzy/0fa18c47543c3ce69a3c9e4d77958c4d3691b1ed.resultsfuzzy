7. The process of fermentation of hemp seed protein extract was performed using the following materials a proprietary probiotic formula containing Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, and proprietary cultured kefir grains whose peculiar microflora was recently described (8) . The fermented hemp seed protein extract caused inhibition of HCT116 cell proliferation that was statistically significant (p < 0.05). We attribute this effect to formation of bioactive peptides from edestin. Edestin is an hexameric globular protein that bears striking functional resemblance to DBP-MAF. We postulate that proteases secreted by the microbes of the probiotic formulation, together with the increase of acidity that is characteristic of fermentation, led to formation of peptides functionally very similar to DBP-MAF and, in
