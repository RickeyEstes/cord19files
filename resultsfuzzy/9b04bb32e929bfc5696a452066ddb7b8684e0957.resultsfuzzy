Commercialization licenses can involve the transfer of rights to utilize intellectual property as well as unique materials in some cases. The NIH OTT has utilized both types of licenses as incentives to develop products for the developing world. Intellectual property rights can only be enforced in countries where a patented technology is used to manufacture a product or in countries where the product is sold. Thus, in countries where the patent owner has not sought patent protec-tion, as is often the case in many developing countries, a biological materials license agreement can be an important incentive in providing the institutions with some level of market protection for the transfer of technologies. In addition, NIH OTT has utilized geographic exclusivity or co-exclusivity as an incentive for a licensee to develop a biotechnology-related product for a particular regional market. When an exclusive license is not needed to encourage commercialization, non-exclusive licensing, regionally or worldwide, will allow multiple parties to compete in the market to develop a product. It is anticipated that these license strategies might have a major impact on the access to health technologies by those in great need in industrialized and developing countries. When framing a marketing strategy for international product development, all of these mechanisms can be utilized in complex ways to provide the appropriate incentives for each country or region. Otherwise, the licensing terms for institutions serving the public health needs of less-industrialized countries would be comparable to NIH OTT licenses to institutions in industrialized countries. Royalty fees are negotiated on a case by case basis, depending on factors such as the marketing plan, market size, potential use for the public interest, and the need to license additional technologies. Using this paradigm allows the OTT to fulfill its statutory requirement to favor small U.S. businesses for the U.S. market and to use exclusive licensing strategies only as needed. The NIH has been increasing its filing of patents for important vaccines and therapeutics in countries like China, India, Brazil and Mexico so that local entities will have the incentive to develop such products. Additionally, the NIH makes efforts to transfer know-how and critical documentations for manufacturing to help developing countries expedite their developing efforts. Also, the selection of partners in these countries is rigorous and based on the companies' scientific and commercial capabilities. Biotechnological innovation has been the subject of IP rights for decades and its significance for human health care field as well as the potential of biotechnology as a tool to relieve the burden of disease worldwide has also grown. Through an ongoing analysis of its own portfolio and the needs and capabilities of developing countries, OTT has found that a niche exists for technology transfer that does not jeopardize US technological, public health, and economic interests. Such transfers, moreover, can provide solutions to the most socio-economically harmful diseases. OTT has already transferred early-stage technologies to public and pri- Source: vate institutions in India, Brazil, China, Korea, and Mexico, and negotiations are in progress with institutions in Brazil, China, India, Egypt, and South Africa to facilitate inter-institutional, international product development (see Table 2 ). For example, OTT licensed a vaccine conjugation technology to the PATH to develop a conjugated meningococcal vaccine in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO). The Serum Institute in India will manufacture the vaccine for eventual distribution in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Eastern Europe. Another license agreement involves the transfer of NIH materials for the development of a conjugated vaccine against typhoid fever to the International Vaccine Institute (IVI), in Seoul, Korea, which plans to sublicense manufacturing to public and private entities in Indonesia and India and to distribute the product in Asia. In some cases, OTT has adopted a multi-prong strategy that licenses the same technology under different license types to multiple institutions in different countries. For example, NIH OTT is licensing technology related to the development of a human-bovine recombinant vaccine to several public and private institutions in Brazil, China, India, and the U.S. (Federal Register, 2004a,b) . Depending on the country and geographic region, the license is exclusive, co-exclusive, or non-exclusive. The degree of exclusivity was determined by the needs of the prospective licensees in each country. By granting exclusive rights only when needed to spur commercialization and segment the world market, the strategy allows the market to drive the degree of exclusivity and thus increase the likelihood that the technology will be developed for worldwide distribution. In the case of an effective humanbovine vaccine, such a goal is very important because it would significantly reduce childhood deaths related to this infection in developing countries. The NIH OTT has found that international technology transfer requires a holistic and flexible approach, a donor-recipient paradigm that eschews unequal partnerships and the consequent challenges with trust, commitment, and reliability. Local scientists and managers directly participate in negotiations with the NIH OTT as it pursues agreements with flexibility and determination. Hopefully, this strategy of enhancing TT to emerging markets will ultimately provide regional/multilateral and philanthropic organizations with more options to distribute products at a lower cost in lesser-developed countries.
