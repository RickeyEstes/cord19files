The clustering of the 5′-proximal sequence of CoV RNAs shows group specificity The clustering of the CoV 5′-proximal 420 nucleotides (nts) obtained from the Kalign webserver (see Materials and methods) basically resembled the current grouping system for CoVs (Fig. 1) , though group I CoVs may be further subdivided into 4 subgroups, groups Ia to Id, according to their relatively large phylogenetic distances ( Fig. 1 ). Sequence comparison further showed conserved and unique features for each CoV group, including: (i) the relative location of the core sequence of the leader transcription-regulating sequence (L-TRS) is quite conserved in all CoVs, except for the one in group Ia CoVs which has a rather long leader sequence upstream of the core TRS; (ii) the potentially translatable short ORF upstream of the genomic ORF1ab, the uORF, is present in most CoVs except for group IId, IIIb, IIIc, and IIId CoVs; (iii) the 5′ UTR in group III CoVs is substantially longer than that in group I and II CoVs, while group IIa CoVs have an exclusively short 5′ UTR (Fig. 1) . It has to be noted that in order to obtain a higher threshold of the phylogenetic distance, strains with the highest sequence variation were used for analysis (selected from the genomic sequences of all CoVs available in GenBank). This made it more promising if homology was found within a cluster. To further examine if particular features found in the RNA sequence in each group are relevant to specific organization of the 5′ cis-acting elements, we globally predicted the secondary structures of the CoV 5′ UTRs, predominantly using computational calculations at the mfold webserver (Zuker, 2003) . We have identified several conserved stemloop (SL) structures in this region, some of which are organized in a group-specific manner (see Figs. 2, 3, and 4). The universal presence of SL1 and SL2 in CoV 5′ UTR The very 5′ nts of CoV RNAs fold into a hairpin of low thermodynamic stability, SL1, which is supported by many co-variations (Figs. 2-4), particularly in group IIa and IIIc CoVs. The loop sequences are not strongly conserved although a YRYR tetra-loop seems to be preferred in most SL1s. A general feature of SL1 is the presence of mismatches, bulges (e.g. in group I and II CoV RNAs) and a high number of A-U and U-A base pairs (bps) (e.g. in group IIIa, b, and d CoV RNAs). Recent data by Li et al. (2008) suggest that the low thermodynamic stability of SL1 is important for the replication of MHV. Another conserved hairpin is SL2 which consists of a 5-bp stem and a highly conserved loop sequence, 5′-CUUGY-3′, which has an important role in MHV replication , though the motif is less conserved in SL2 of group I and III CoVs (Figs. 2 and 4). Downstream of SL2, an additional hairpin, SL2.1, with the stable UUCG tetra-loop, was predicted in group Ia CoVs. Interestingly, the CUUGY loop was recently shown to adopt the YNMG-type of tetra-loop-folds (Liu et al., 2009) .
