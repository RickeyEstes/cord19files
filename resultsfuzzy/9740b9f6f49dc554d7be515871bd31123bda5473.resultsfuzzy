The photo image of Phellodendron phosphor is shown in Fig. 1c which was extracted by using diethyl ether and collected and evaporated in rotary evaporators to obtain the diethyl ether extraction. The daylight color shown in Fig. 1c was amber yellow. In UV box, Phellodendron phosphor displayed mustard yellow and canary yellow under 254 nm and 365 nm excitation, respectively. Since the alkaloids in Phellodendron chinense Schneid were high polar, methanol-d 4 was used as a solvent to ensure that all the extract can be dissolved and avoid the inference of phenolic hydroxyl signals for NMR measurement 18 . The 1 H NMR spectrum of Phellodendron phosphor is well documented in methanol-d 4 in Fig. S2 and Table S1 . The analysis of the NMR spectrum of Phellodendron phosphor revealed the extracts is Berberine 18 . FT-IR spectroscopy was used to analyze to the functional groups in Phellodendron phosphor, as shown in Fig The optical property of Phellodendron phosphor was analyzed using UV visible spectroscopy and the corresponding spectrum is shown in Fig. 2b . The broad absorption peak was from 200 nm to 500 nm. The absorption coefficient α in many amorphous semiconductors shows an exponential dependence on photon energy usually obeying the empirical relation. The band gap of Phellodendron phosphor (E g ) was determined by using Tauc's plot [43] [44] [45] [46] . For allowed direct transitions, n = 1/2, and for allowed indirect transitions, n = 2. From results of Fig. 2 (c) and (d), Phellodendron phosphor showed both direct band gap and indirect band gap were determined to be 2.49 eV and 2.62 eV, respectively. Normalized photoluminescence excitation and photoluminescence emission spectra of Phellodendron phosphor and YAG:Ce are displayed in Fig. 2e . Phellodendron phosphor exhibits a nature of broad absorption band from 360 nm to 500 nm, indicating that it can be effectively applied in general lighting for UV, nUV and blue-pumping LED devices. The emission spectra of Phellodendron phosphor and YAG:Ce excited at 460 nm display the broad yellow-emitting peak at 543 nm and 560 nm, respectively. YAG:Ce, however, could only be excited at 460 nm according to the sharp absorption band at ~460 nm. Even though, the luminous intensity of Phellodendron phosphor is 3% of that of YAG:Ce phosphor at 460 nm excitation. Nevertheless, when Phellodendron phosphors were excited at 380 nm, the luminous intensity of Phellodendron phosphor is more than 139% than that of YAG:Ce phosphor. Phellodendron phosphor can be applied both nUV and blue chip for LED devices following to the above result. Fig. S3a shows PL/PLE spectra of commercial red-emission phosphor-CaAlSiN 3 :Eu 2+ . The emission spectra of CaAlSiN 3 :Eu 2+ phosphor is excited at 460 nm displays red-emitting peak at 620 nm. To better explain information about the microenvironment surrounding the excited probe molecule, we recorded the time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay measurements of Phellodendron phosphor, as shown in Fig. 2f . It provides a complementary technique to study the PL mechanism of Phellodendron phosphor, using the kinetics of electron-hole recombination as a probe. The orange line in Fig. 2f displays the PL decay profile of the Phellodendron phosphor under excitation of the 260 nm laser. The PL profile can be well fitted by a sum of exponential expressions (equation 2) and the average lifetimes (τ) for bi-exponential decay of fluorescence were calculated from the decay times and pre-exponential factors, using the following equation (equation 3) as previous work 47 : CaAlSiN 3 :Eu 2+ phosphor into phosphor paste, the color temperature of W-LEDs changed from cold color temperature to warm color temperature. Fig. S2c exhibits the CIE chromaticity diagram of enlarge of Fig. 3b with Planckian Locus line. The CIE chromaticity coordinates are shown in Table S2 . Figure 3e shows the CCTs of LED (1), LED (2) and LED (3) with 15 iterations each and the summary are shown in Fig. S3c and Table S3 . The range of LED (2) and LED (3) were from 3000 K to 4000 K, which are lower than that of LED (1). The average CCT of LED (1), LED (2) and LED (3) are 7623 K, 3615.7 K and 3477.6 K, respectively. It indicates that the CCT of W-LEDs could be easily controlled through the addition of Phellodendron phosphor or CaAlSiN 3 :Eu 2+ phosphor. Based on the results, the CCT of LED (2) was similar to that of LED (3) . Thus, the Phellodendron phosphor could replace the commercial red phosphor CaAlSiN 3 :Eu 2+ . In addition, we packaged LEDs with different content (0, 0.1, 2.4, 9.1, 50 wt.%) of Phellodendron phosphor shown in Fig. 3c . More Phellodendron phosphor we added, the color of emitting light is much warmer from 10000 K to 1500 K under 30 mA forward bias currents. In other words, we can easily control CCTs of LEDs through the Phellodendron phosphor addition for different applications. For luminous efficacy, the white LEDs driven of LED(1), LED(2) and LED(3) at a D.C. current of 30 mA exhibited about 61.6, 48.6 and 58.8 lm/W, respectively. By characterizing the luminesce properties of Phellodendron phosphor, we revealed that the yellow-emission peak at 543 nm and it could partially replace rare-earth elements and reduce their use in LED applications.
