The BTB prevalence at animal and herd level were; 0.62% and 0.77% in beef cattle, 0.28% and 0.91% in dairy cattle, respectively. Overall, prevalence was 0.47% and 0.78% at animal and herd level, respectively. Five risk factors were offered to invariable logistic regression model. Farms with higher numbers of cattle, and those with one more positive animal, were 2.6 and 1.9 times more at risk for establishment of BTB, respectively, compared with the farm only one BTB outbreak. Conclusion: To our understanding this is the first report that has encompassed dairy and beef farms in South Korea. Furthermore, results of risk factor analysis will be useful as entry points for future informed decision making towards BTB control and eradication program in the country. Conclusion: Our data showed the LTBI prevalence among HCWs working in our hospital were 40%, and was increasing tendency by age. Physicians were less likely to accept treatment than other HCWs, and this finding suggests effort to enhance LTBI treatment acceptance among physicians will be needed. Background: Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) remains an important disease in many countries of the world, causing significant economic losses and proving difficult to control. The detection method of residual Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) in the environment is needed to control bTB on herd level. Nested PCR amplification was applied in this study to ensure the specificity of detection, eliminate any false-positive results, and increase the amplification signal, providing the method with the highest sensitivity of environmental sample. In this study, we attempted to establish a method for detection of M. bovis in environmental sample using nested-PCR method and to detect residual M. bovis in the cattle herds where was carried disinfection. Materials and Methods: 60 Environmental samples (51 fecal samples, 9 bottles water) from (10 herds) herds where have a history of bTB outbreak were used for the detection of residual Mycobacterium bovis. Amplicon libraries of IS 6110 target gene fragment was amplified from M. bovis DNA by using the two types of primer sets. For the first step, PCR amplification of the 716 bp length for IS 6110 gene was performed and each sample was purified to remove the others. The purified library amplicons were re-amplified by second PCR primer set (203 bp) to increase detection sensitivity. After each PCR amplification round, the size of the PCR product was verified on a 1.5% agarose gel. Target protein design, cloning, expression of target protein using RID as a fusion partner: To express MERS-CoV antigen in E. coli, 70 amino acid RID amongst the LysRS was used as the fusion partner ( Fig. 2A) . Depending on the species of immunization, hRID and mRID were used for cloning to minimize any induced immunity for the fusion partner. The following scheme is a simple illustration of a RNA-mediated folding model that produces only the folded target proteins by cleaving fusion partners using the TEV protease (Fig. 1A) . HR2 was selected based on the antigenicity plot prediction. From the previous study, the RBD that plays a key role in the binding of dpp4 receptor was selected as the target protein (Fig. 2B) . mRID (mouse-derived RID) was used as a fusion partner for expression. Its solubility improved as the temperature decreased when compared to the solubility of the direct form (Fig. 3C) . Folding of the RID-fused protein and the role of RNA in stability maintenance: According to former studies, many people believed that most protein folding was carried out by molecular chaperones. However, recent research showed that RNA can function as chaperones to aid in protein folding and stability. Thus, we carried out cell lysis to verify the role of RNA in RID-fused proteins in the folding and stability maintenance. RNA was removed in-vitro, while another was incubated as the control at 37Â°C. Agarose gel verified that RNA was removed only when treated with RNase A (Fig. 3A ). In addition, the SDS-PAGE analysis using Western blot and Coomassie staining confirmed that both mRID fused protein showed a decrease in their solubility when RNA was removed (Fig. 3B) . RID fused RBD protein bound to hDPP4 receptor: We verified the binding between the RBD protein produced in the E. coli system and the hDPP4 receptor using the co-immunoprecipitation and ELISA. First, the binding between RBD protein and hDPP4 was verified using co-immunoprecipitation by protein A magnetic beads with dpp4-specific antibody. Then, we performed Western blotting (Fig. 4A) . Also, we used hdpp4 protein as the coating antigen to observe that binding of the RBD protein is concentration-dependent. Then, antihis antibody was used in the ELISA assay for further verification (Fig. 4B) . Such findings concluded that successful folding of E. coli derived RBD protein result in binding to the DPP4 receptor. Sero-diagnosis based on the RBD and HR2 antigen from MERS-COV infected serum: We predicted that the mRID fused RBD and HR2 protein are suitable for sero-diagnosis. Thus, RBD was used as the coating antigen, the rabbit sera immunized with inactivated MERS-COV was serially diluted first for the ELISA assay. We identified binding of the RBD and MERS-COV immunized rabbit sera (Fig. 5A ). Furthermore, ELISA was performed using the sera (1:100 diluted) of the four patients infected with MERS-COV. For the RBD coating antigen, the binding sensitivity for the three MERS-COV infected patient sera is higher than the MERS-COV infected cell lysate (Fig. 5B ). However, for the 1:100 diluted normal person sera, almost none was detected by the RID-fused RBD and HR2. These results demonstrate that mRID-fused RBD and HR2 can serve as a powerful antigen for rapid and accurate diagnosis and mass production.
