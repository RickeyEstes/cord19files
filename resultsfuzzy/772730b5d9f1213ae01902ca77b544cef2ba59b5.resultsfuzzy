To investigate the role of therapeutic modulation of the CD200-CD200R signaling pathway in tumor progression, mice subcutaneously inoculated with mammary gland cancer cells (EMT6) and were treated with agonistic anti-CD200R (clone OX110) or isotype control. Antibodies were administered 3-5 times i.v. at a dose of 100 μg every third day, starting from day 7 after inoculation of tumor cells. Treatment with agonistic anti-CD200R had no significant effect on the growth of EMT6 tumors (Fig 1A) . We analyzed tumor-infiltrating immune myeloid cells according to the gating strategy presented in Fig 1B. Upon anti-CD200R treatment, we found a decrease in the fraction of tumor macrophages (CD11b + F4/80 + ) and a simultaneous but smaller, increase in the percentage of CD11b + Ly6C + cells (Fig 1C) . Intratumoral monocytes (CD11b + Ly6C ++ ) and remaining myeloid cells (CD11b + Ly6C -) were not affected by the CD200R agonist (Fig 1C) . Anti-CD200R treatment decreased fluorescence of CD200R by flow cytometry using the same antibody clone (OX110) for the detection (Fig 1D) , in all analyzed intratumoral immune cell populations, proving tumor penetration by intravenously administered anti-CD200R. Similarly, we analyzed the composition of splenic myeloid cell populations. We found no significant differences in the frequency of these cells (Fig 1E) . CD200R expression was significantly decreased in all analyzed populations with the exception of CD11b + Ly6C + cells (Fig 1F) . However, relative differences observed in splenocytes were smaller than in the tumor subpopulations. To exclude the possibility that the lack of therapeutic effect of the agonistic antibody (OX110) was due to simultaneous triggering of inhibitory (CD200R1) and activating (CD200RLc) receptors, we conducted an experiment with an anti-CD200R1 agonistic antibody (clone OX131) that, in Balb/c mice, does not trigger CD200RLc [21] . Similarly to OX110, intravenous administration of OX131 did not affect the growth of EMT6 tumors (Fig 2A) . Cytometric analysis of intratumoral immune cells showed no effect of the OX131 clone on the myeloid cell infiltration ( Fig  2B) , similar to OX110 (Fig 1C) . More detailed analysis showed several significant differences in the intratumoral cell populations upon anti-CD200R1 treatment. The fraction of granulocytic myeloid cells (CD11b + Ly6G + ) was increased after OX131 treatment (Fig 2B) . In contrast, the monocytic myeloid cells (CD11b + Ly6C + ) and intratumoral macrophages (CD11b + Ly6C -MHC-II + ) were decreased ( Fig  2C) . These results were similar to the treatment with OX110 where intratumoral macrophages (CD11b + F4/80 + ) were also significantly decreased (Fig 1C) . The fraction of intratumoral CD8 + T cells was not different (Fig 2D) . To measure the activity of intratumoral lymphocytes, cells were stimulated ex vivo with PMA/ionomycin and stained for the intracellular cytokine production. We found decreased IFN-γ ( Fig 2E) and TNF-α (Fig 2F) in tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells, but these differences were not statistically significant. These data suggest that even with the use of anti-CD200R (clone OX131) that is specific for the inhibitory CD200R1, there is no significant effect of anti-CD200R on tumor growth or the composition of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. To analyze the potential therapeutic effect in more immunogenic models, we analyzed the effect of anti-CD200R (OX110) treatment in two distinct tumor models: LLC (Lewis lung carcinoma) and B16F10 (melanoma). These tumor models are known to be more immunogenic and are syngeneic to the C57BL/6 mice strain that has more proinflammatory characteristics. Again we found no significant effect of anti-CD200R on the growth of subcutaneously inoculated LLC (Fig 3A) nor of intravenously inoculated B16F10, resulting mostly in foci formation in the lungs (Fig 3B) . Since LLC grew in flat tumors we decided to quantify its growth as a surface, whereas B16F10 growth was monitored by light emitted from luciferase, expressed by tumor cells. Again in LLC tumors, we did not observe any difference in the percentage of main myeloid cell populations (Fig 3C) . Similarly, in the lungs of B16F10 tumor-bearing mice, no difference in the percentage of main myeloid cell populations was found (Fig 3D) . We investigated the expression of CD200R and observed a significant decrease of CD200R on intratumoral myeloid cells upon the intravenous treatment with anti-CD200R (Fig 3E) , proving penetration of antibody into the subcutaneous LLC tumor. These results suggest that agonistic anti-CD200R has no effect on tumor growth in wild-type mice with endogenous CD200 ligand. To further investigate the role the CD200-CD200R axis on tumor growth we used luciferase-expressing B16F10 melanoma cells inoculated into syngeneic Cd200 -/and control wildtype (WT) C57BL/6 mice. Both, direct measurements of tumor volume (Fig 4A) , as well as bioluminescence (BLI) measurements of the same tumors (Fig 4B) , revealed that Cd200 -/mice developed smaller tumors as compared to control WT mice (Fig 4A) . B16F10 cells with (B16F10-CD200 cells) or without (B16F10-EV cells) CD200 expression were inoculated i.v. into WT or Cd200 -/mice to see whether tumor-expressed CD200 can affect tumor growth. Intravenously inoculated B16F10 cells disseminate to the lungs and other organs and their growth can be monitored with BLI. Regardless of the CD200 expression in tumor cells, control WT mice had higher tumor burden as compared to Cd200 -/mice (Fig 4C and 4D) , similarly to the subcutaneous tumor models (Fig 4A and 4B) . Although the lung tumor burdens after inoculation of B16F10-CD200 and B16F10-EV cells was comparable in WT mice, the CD200 negative tumors grew significantly slower in the lungs of Cd200 -/mice as compared to CD200 expressing melanomas (Fig 4C and 4D) . These results indicate that tumor development is accelerated by both endogenous and tumor-derived CD200 expression. CD200R-signaling affects the growth and progression of cancer, however, its precise mechanism of action is not clear. Lack of CD200 expression inhibits endogenous skin tumors development [17] . Additionally, expression of CD200 on cancer cells correlates with poor patient prognosis [14] and increases the frequency of immunosuppressive Treg cells [20] . All these indicate a positive effect of CD200R on tumor growth by inhibition of the antitumor response. However, a tumor-supportive effect is also possible when CD200R signaling inhibits the activity of protumor myeloid cells [19, 26] . The dominant effect probably depends on tumor immunogenicity, composition of myeloid cells expressing the CD200R and the tumor inflammation. Anti-CD200R diminishes production of cytokines by CD11b + myeloid cells, indicating that the antibody suppresses function of myeloid cells by engaging CD200R [26] . Triggering of CD200R by agonistic anti-CD200R reduces CD200-negative melanoma tumor formation in the lungs particularly via inhibition of a Gr1 + myeloid cell population, that feasibly protects metastatic cancer cells from surveillance by immune cells [26] . Importantly, cancer cells used in that study overexpressed ovalbumin, a strong adjuvant able to induce an adoptive anticancer response. In our study, injection of agonistic anti-CD200R antibodies as a monotherapy did not affect the growth of CD200-negative subcutaneous tumors: melanoma, breast, and lung carcinoma in syngeneic tumor models. This suggests that in the absence of immunogenic antigen, e.g. OVA, agonistic anti-CD200R is not effective in the presence of endogenous CD200. Using CD200-positive and CD200-negative melanoma tumor cells, we showed that lack of CD200-CD200R interaction in a Cd200 -/host does inhibit tumor growth of CD200-negative cells. Expression of CD200 either on host or melanoma cells promotes tumor cell growth. However, triggering of CD200R by agonistic anti-CD200R did not further enhance tumor growth. In this study, using several additional tumor models with various degree of intratumoral inflammation, we confirmed that anti-CD200R mono treatment does not have therapeutic effect without additional inflammation. In contrast, using a model of colon carcinoma we have recently shown that anti-CD200R treatment suppresses tumor growth and modifies immune cell recruitment but only in the presence of TLR7-induced inflammation [27] .
