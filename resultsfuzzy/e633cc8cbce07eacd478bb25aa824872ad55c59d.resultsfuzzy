To investigate the extent to which the composition of the gut microbiome overlaps across different primates for both known and currently uncharacterized microbes, we meta-analyzed a large set of gut microbiomes from humans and non-human primates (NHPs) that are publically available. Six datasets were considered for NHPs [30, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] spanning 22 host species from 14 different countries in 5 continents (Additional file 1: Table S1 and Additional file 2: Figure S1 ), totaling 203 metagenomic samples that we retrieved and curated for this work. Microbiome samples from adult human healthy individuals were retrieved from 47 datasets considered in a recent meta-analysis [11] on 9428 human gut metagenomes and used as a comparative resource. Human samples include both Westernized and non-Westernized populations from different countries, whereas NHP datasets cover 4 primate clades, including Old and New World monkeys, apes, and lemurs (Additional file 1: Table S1 , Fig. 1a ). Two datasets (LiX_2018 and SrivathsanA_2015) surveyed NHPs in captivity, which were fed a specific human-like diet [39] or a diet similar to the one of wild NHPs [38] , respectively. The newly metagenome-assembled genomes greatly increase the mappable diversity of NHP microbiomes Reference-based taxonomic profiling of all the 203 samples (see the "Methods" section and Additional file 3: Table S2 ) confirmed that a very large fraction of NHP metagenomes remains unmapped and uncharacterized (average estimated mapped reads 2.1% ± 3.64% st.dev., Fig. 1 The expanded set of microbial genomes and species from the gut microbiomes of NHPs. a Phylogenetic tree of the primate species considered in this study (adapted from [44] ), reporting the dataset and number of samples per species. b Microbial phylogeny of the 4930 species-level genome bins (SGBs, using single representative genomes, see the "Methods" section) and the 1009 SGBs that are specific to NHPs and newly retrieved in this study. c Overlap between the sets of SGBs reconstructed from NHP metagenomes and at least 1 reference microbial genome (kSGBs), between SGBs reconstructed both from NHP and human metagenomes but lacking a reference genome (uSGBs), and identification of newly assembled SGBs from NHPs metagenomes only (pSGBs). d Fraction of MAGs assigned to clades at different taxonomic levels; samples unassigned at the species level (kSGB or uSGB) could be assigned to known genus-level genome bins (GGBs) or family-level genome bins (FGBs), or remained unassigned at the family level (not assigned at FGB level). e Statistics of NHP metagenomic read mappability before and after the addition of MAGs from human and NHP metagenomes. We observed an average increase of 612% with respect to the reference genomes alone and 206% with respect to the catalog of human MAGs Additional file 4: Table S3 ). This points at the paucity of microbial genomes representative for members of the gut microbiome of NHPs, which greatly overcome the unexplored diversity still hidden in human microbiomes [45] . We thus employed an assembly-based approach we previously proposed and validated elsewhere [11] (see the "Methods" section) and that was also recently crosschecked with other similar efforts [46] to reconstruct microbial genomes de novo in the whole set of available NHP metagenomic samples. After single-sample assembly and contig binning of the 203 NHP metagenomes considered, we retrieved a total of 2985 metagenomeassembled genomes (MAGs) (Additional file 5: Table S4 ) that exceeded the threshold for being considered of medium quality (completeness > 50% and contamination < 5%) according to recent guidelines [47] . A large fraction of these genomes (34.6%) could additionally be considered of high quality (completeness > 90% and contamination < 5%) and provide the basis for assessing the diversity of NHP microbiomes Functional annotation of all MAGs (see the "Methods" section [48] ) showed low levels of functional characterization in NHPs, with only 1049 ± 482 Uni-Ref50 (61.9% ± 17.3% st.dev. of predicted proteins) assigned per MAG, in contrast with the 1426 ± 591 (77.3% ± 14.6% st.dev. of predicted proteins) assigned to MAGs from non-Westernized human samples and 1840 ± 847 (83.7% ± 12.6% st.dev. of predicted proteins) assigned to those obtained from Westernized human populations. Comparative functional analysis between human and NHP strains was hindered by the low level of overlap between species-level genome bins (SGBs; i.e., clusters of MAGs spanning 5% genetic diversity, see the "Methods" section) retrieved from human and NHP metagenomes, with only 8 SGBs being present in at least 10 human and 10 NHP microbiomes. Statistical analysis on the functional annotations of these shared SGBs showed 150 KEGG Orthologies (KOs) significantly associated with NHP strains and 166 KOs associated with human strains (Fisher's test FDR-corrected p values < 0.05, Additional file 6: Table S5 ). Among the functions associated with NHP strains, we found different genes involved in the degradation of sugars like cellobiose (K00702, K02761) and maltose (K16211, K01232), and among those associated with human ones, genes encoding for the degradation of different antibiotic compounds, including penicillin and vancomycin (K01710, K02563, K07260, K07259), which is consistent with the exposure of humans but not NHPs to antibiotics. We first mapped the 2985 obtained MAGs against the previously described SGBs that recapitulate the > 150, 000 MAGs from the human microbiome and the > 80, 000 reference microbial genomes from public repositories. In total, 310 MAGs (10.39%) fell into 99 SGBs containing at least 1 known reference genome (called kSGBs), whereas 489 (16.38%) belonged to 200 unknown species (called uSGBs) lacking reference genomes but previously identified in the human microbiome ( Fig. 1c and Table 1 ). The large majority of the MAGs remained however unassigned, with 2186 MAGs (73.23%) showing > 5% genetic distance to any SGB and 1903 MAGs (63.75%) showing > 10% genetic distance. These completely unknown MAGs firstly reconstructed in this work from NHPs' gut metagenomes were de novo clustered into 1009 NHP-specific SGBs (here defined as primate SGBs or pSGBs) with the same procedure that defines SGBs at 5% genetic diversity we previously employed and validated [11] (Fig. 1c and Table 1 ). Overall, NHP microbiomes comprised 1308 SGBs covering 22 phyla (Fig. 1b) that expanded the known NHP microbiome diversity with new candidate species mostly expanding the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Euryarchaeota, and Elusimicrobia phyla. On the contrary, Actinobacteria were generally underrepresented among NHP SGBs (Fig. 1b) . Although some species were shared between NHPs and humans, our analysis highlighted extensive microbial diversity specifically associated with primates other than humans. This expanded set of genomes improved the fraction of metagenomic reads in each metagenome that could be mapped by over 6-folds (612%) with respect to the sole reference genomes available in public repositories (> 80,000, see the "Methods" section) and by 2-folds (206.5%) with respect to the catalog of genomes expanded with the MAGs from over 9500 human metagenomes [11] (Fig. 1e) . Overall, the average metagenome mappability reached 38.2%, with however uneven increase across datasets (Fig. 1e) . The LiX_2018 dataset of NHPs in captivity reached a mappability of 77.6%, whereas the AmatoKR_2018 dataset of wild NHPs merely reached a 17.4% mappability rate (Fig. 1e ). The fact that LiX_2018 was already highly mappable even when using the available reference genomes alone (22.2% w.r.t. 1% of AmatoKR_2018) and that the human Only few and mostly unexplored gut microbes are in common between humans and NHPs We first investigated how many of the microbial species identified in NHPs were also detected at least once in the human gut microbiome, finding only about 20% overlap (291 of the 1308 SGBs) between NHP and human gut microbial species. Considering the whole set of SGBs found at least once in human or NHP gut metagenomes, this overlap is further reduced to 5.95%. Many of the species found both in NHPs and humans (200 MAGs, 68%) are currently unexplored species without reference genomes (uSGBs). In addition, very few of the newly recovered MAGs belonged to species previously isolated from NHPs but never found in human microbiome samples. This set of 8 known species includes Helicobacter macacae, which can cause chronic colitis in macaques [49, 50] , and Bifidobacterium moukalabense, whose type strain was originally isolated from Gorilla gorilla gorilla samples [51] , and we reconstructed from two samples of the same host (Additional file 7: Table  S6 ). The other 6 known species (Fibrobacter sp. UWS1, Caryophanon tenue, Staphylococcus nepalensis, Staphylococcus cohnii, Enterococcus thailandicus, Serratia sp. FGI94) comprise 1 MAG only from our dataset and confirm the paucity of isolated and characterized taxa specifically associated to NHPs. When looking at the species with previously assigned taxonomic labels, we found a total of 91 species with sequenced representatives (kSGBs) in NHPs that can also be found in the human microbiome. However, many of them (64.65%) are still rather uncharacterized species as they represent sequenced genomes assigned to genuslevel clades without an official species name (e.g., with species names labeled as "sp." or "bacterium," Additional file 8: Table S7 ). Most of such relatively unknown kSGBs were from the Clostridium genus (15 kSGBs), and several others belonged to the Prevotella (9) and Ruminococcus (6) genera. However, both the 2 most represented human kSGBs assigned to the Prevotella genus (13 and 11 MAGs recovered, respectively, Fig. 2a and Additional file 9: Table S8 ) were retrieved from Macaca fascicularis in captivity from the LiX_2018 dataset, consistently with previous the literature [36, 52, 53] . Among those kSGBs with an unambiguously assigned taxonomy, 2 highly prevalent Treponema species, T. berlinense and T. succinifaciens, were reconstructed from 14 and 11 samples, respectively, from different studies and host species ( Fig. 2a and Additional file 8: Table S7 ). These two species were previously found to be enriched in non-Westernized populations [11] , with 45 genomes reconstructed from different countries. T. berlinense and T. succinifaciens may thus represent known taxa that are common to primate hosts but that are under negative selective pressure in modern Westernized lifestyles. The majority (68.7%) of the 291 species shared between humans and NHPs are SGBs without available reference genomes and taxonomic definition (i.e., uSGBs, Fig. 1c , d). Many of these uSGBs remain unassigned also at higher taxonomic levels, with only 25 of them assigned to known genera and 102 to known families. Overall, more than one third (36.5%) of the uSGBs shared with humans were highly uncharacterized and were left unassigned even at the family level (Additional file 9: Table S8 ). Among these, 5 out of the 10 most prevalent shared uSGBs (accounting for 61 MAGs in total) were assigned to the Bacteroidetes phylum ( Fig. 2a) but remained unassigned at lower taxonomic levels (Additional file 9: Table S8 ). Even among uSGBs, the Treponema genus was highly represented, with 9 genomes reconstructed from different samples of Papio cynocephalus from the TungJ_2015 dataset (Additional file 9: Table S8 ). Common human-NHP taxa thus represent only a small fraction of the primate microbiome, and these taxa generally belong to very poorly characterized taxonomic clades.
