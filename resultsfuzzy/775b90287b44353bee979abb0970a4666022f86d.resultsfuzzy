Background: Humans have the ability to synthesize vitamin D during the action of ultraviolet (UV) radiation upon the skin. The term "vitamin D insufficiency" has been associated with asthma. However, little is known about the link between total and serum specific IgE levels and vitamin D in asthmatic children. Today dust mite allergens and cockroach are the most important sources of clinically relevant allergens sensitizing patients with asthma in the tropics, Objective: To investigate the relevance of Vit D levels on the total Ig E and allergen-specific sensitization(Cr and Mite) in asthmatic children living a poorer communities within a Barranquilla, a city on the Colombian Caribbean Coast. Method: A case-control study with 1000 individuals, which included 500 asthmatic children and 500 healthy children from the Colombian Caribbean coast was made. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D was measured by a EIA. Total IgE, specific IgE to Dermatophagoides farinae-D f-and Blomia tropicalis-B t.and Periplaneta americana -Cr-were determinated by ELISA (ImmunoCAP ® Phadia AB, Sweden technology). The independent effects of these variables were estimated from obtaining odd ratios (OR) trough logistic regression models adjusted for sex and age. Results: Elevated total IgE (> 100UI/mL) were observed in both study group. Showing as a risk factor for susceptibility to childhood asthma (OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.08 -2.46). Serum levels of vitamin D were found normal or insufficient in both groups (52.21 ng / mL and 52.2 ng / mL, P = 0.907). Also, insufficient vitamin D was associated with elevated levels of Total Ig E (15% vs 8.7%, P = 0.037); showing a negative correlation (Spearman r = -0.28, p = 0.00). However, our data is not clear regarding what effect it may have the insufficient levels of vitamin D on the IgE immune response (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 0.9 -3.6). On the other hand, elevated Total IgE levels were associated with specific IgE sensitization to B. tropicalis, D. farinae and P. americana. Conclusion: Despite the growing evidence of the role of vitamin D in incident asthma and asthma exacerbation, studies are not all consistent Taking together our results are showing that insufficient serum levels of vitamin D is not a risk factor for developing asthma in poores comunities children of the Caribbean area. Introduction: A previous study concluded that blood eosinophil counts in patients with asthma could be used as an indicator of prospective asthma outcomes. We aimed to identify risk factors associated with elevated blood eosinophil counts in patients with asthma from UK primary care clinical records. Methods: Retrospective, observational study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and the Optimum Patient Care Research Database. Patients were aged 12-80 years with asthma and no other chronic respiratory disease. Study period was 1 year before (baseline period) date of last recorded blood eosinophil count. Comparison at date of last recorded blood eosinophil count: ≤400 eosinophils/ml (low) vs. >400 eosinophils/ml (elevated). Baseline characteristics: biomarkers, demographics, comorbidities and markers of disease severity. Univariable logistic regression was used to identify baseline characteristics associated with >400 eosinophils/ml (p≤0.05). These characteristics were then included in a multivariable model and reduced to a list of noncollinear factors. Results: Of 130,248 patients, 16% had >400 eosinophils/ml. Thirtynine percent of the patients with ≤400 eosinophils/ml and 31% with >400 were male. Median age (Interquartile range) was 45 (31-61) and 50 (37-63) for ≤400 and >400 eosinophils/ml, respectively. Table shows baseline risk factors associated with >400 eosinophils/ml (Reference category=1.00). Conclusion: In this study, several clinical and demographic features were predictive of elevated blood eosinophil counts in asthma patients. These data could be used to stratify patients who could benefit from more intensive and/or targeted asthma therapies, potentially improving control and reducing costs.
