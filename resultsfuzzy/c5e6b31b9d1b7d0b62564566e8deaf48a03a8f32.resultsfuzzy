The first step of interpretation of MERS-CoV rRT-PCR is verification of the internal control (Fig. 1) . Negative reactions in the internal control indicate a failure of the amplification process owing to either the presence of PCR inhibitors or other reasons. In this case, retesting the same sample is required after processing it to eliminate the inhibitory effect, including re-extraction of the nucleic acids or dilution of the extracted nucleic acids. When the internal control is properly amplified, the results can be classified as screen-negative, -indeterminate, or -positive according to the cycle threshold (Ct) values and whether the upE gene was amplified. Screen-positive specimens should be confirmed by amplification of ORF1a or other targets. When indeterminate or equivocal results are obtained in suspect cases, the results should be reported immediately to infection control units in each hospital. A series of negative results in the cases which have definite contact history should not rule out MERS-CoV infection, and factors that can cause false negatives such as poor specimen quality, too early or late stage specimens, inappropriate handling or specimen transport, and inherent testing problems should be investigated by obtaining an additional specimen (especially a lower respiratory specimen), by the verification of an internal control, or by retesting the sample at another facility for confirmation.
