Prophage genometrics The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/114819 doi: bioRxiv preprint At the time of analysis, the SEED contained 11,941 bacterial genomes spanning 34 different phyla of Archaea and Bacteria (Fig. 2) . A total of 36,465 prophages were identified in 9,883 bacterial hosts (82.76% of the bacteria have at least one prophage). Slightly fewer than one half of the prophages that were identified (15, 765 prophages) contained an annotated Int protein, suggesting that they are phages with the potential to integrate. The mechanism of integration of the remaining phages could not be easily identified (see below). A total of 1,511,644 prophage ORFs were identified -of these, 45.7% or 798,235 ORFs had no known function. In addition, 567 genomic regions had no similarity to any of the proteins in the SEED non-redundant database (15) although these putative prophages had many other hallmarks of prophages such as shorter genes, many consecutive genes on the same DNA strand, and %GC compositional skews. A total of 7,341 portal genes, 6,228 holin genes, 14,771 capsid genes, and 59,010 tail-related genes were identified in the prophage dataset ( Table 1) . As we have shown previously, some families of genes are easier to identify than others, and gaps remain in our understanding of families of core phage proteins that we cannot readily identify from sequence homology alone (29) (30) (31) . Across the most highly represented phyla, there were an average of between 2.7 (Actinobacteria) and 3.8 (Proteobacteria) prophages found per genome. Within phyla there were also differences (although not statistically significant) in the prophage genome content. For example, Sodalis glossinidius, a proteobacterium, had the most prophages at 29, while several phyla (Caldiserica, Deinococcus-Thermus, Dictyoglomi, Elusimicrobia, and Fibrobacteres) had no prophages, Spirochetes had the shortest prophage genomes on average (25,595 bp), and Bacteroidetes had the longest (46,059 bp) (Fig. 3) . Across all of the prophages, the mean and median prophage genome length was 36,804 bp and 32,352 bp, respectively. Shorter prophage genomes may indicate that the phage is no longer viable and is in the process of being degraded or removed from the host's genome (32) . Alternatively, different genome lengths may represent different packaging strategies used by prophages associated with different phyla (33) . Several prophage genome characteristics correlate with the host's characteristics (34) . For example, the prophage's and host's GC content correlated strongly (R 2 = 0.95; Fig. 4 ). As we have shown previously, the GC content of phage genomes can be accurately used to predict the phyla of the host associated with a phage (to >95% accuracy), however GC content can not be accurately used to predict the phages' host at lower taxonomic levels (35) .

Percent GC is basically a k-mer DNA profile with k = 1. Higher k-mer DNA profiles increase the correlation between phage and host, but when k exceeds 7 nucleotides the data become sparse and over fit the predictions (35) .
