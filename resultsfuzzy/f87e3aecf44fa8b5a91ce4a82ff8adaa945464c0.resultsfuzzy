Nucleotide sequences were entered into the Translate Tool of the ExPASy molecular biology www server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and used to determine possible open reading frames (ORF). One ORF was identified for each TCV strain that predicted a protein, 409 amino acids in length with a molecular mass of approximately 45 kDa. Previous sequence analyses of the N proteins of IBV strains (Beaudette, M41, and KB8523; Boursnell et al., 1985; Sutou et al., 1988; Jia et al., 1995) resulted in similar findings: IBV N proteins were determined to be 409 amino acids in length with a molecular mass of approximately 45 kDa. In contrast, groups I and II coronaviruses have been shown to possess N proteins of 378 -389 amino acids and 448-455 amino acids, respectively (Kapke and Brian, 1986; Lapps et al., 1987; Parker and Masters, 1990; Williams et al., 1992) . The deduced amino acid sequences of the N protein of TCV is shown in Fig. 1 . The TCV (Minnesota) strain is used as the reference strain with amino acid differences noted for Indiana strain, NC95 strain and three strains of IBV (Beaudette, M41, KB8523; Boursnell et al., 1985; Sutou et al., 1988) . A comparison of the percent identity of TCV N protein amino acid sequences with published sequences of three IBV strains (Beaudette, M41, KB8523), BCV (Mebus) and TGEV (Purdue) is presented in Table 1 (Boursnell et al., 1985; Kapke and Brian, 1986; Lapps et al., 1987; Sutou et al., 1988) . Overall the N protein sequence of TCV and IBV strains have greater than 90% identity. TCV strains have 92.7 -93.2% sequence identity when compared to each other, and 90.5-95.6% identity to IBV. In contrast, TCV and IBV N proteins have less than 21% identity with BCV (Mebus) and TGEV (Purdue). Previous studies comparing the TCV M protein (70 amino acids at carboxy-terminus) and N protein (55 amino acids at amino-terminus) and published sequences from other coronaviruses indicated greater than 90% identity of both protein segments with IBV, and less than 30% identity with groups I and II coronaviruses (Breslin et al., 1999) . Differences among TCV strains were observed in the 3% UTRs (Fig. 2) . TCV (Minnesota) and TCV (Indiana) contained a 153-nucleotide segment that was not present in the NC95 strain. 3% UTRs of TCV (Indiana) and TCV (Minnesota) were 502 bp in length, compared with a 349-bp 3% UTR of TCV (NC95). The missing nucleotide segment in the NC95 3% UTR occurs immediately downstream of the N gene (Fig. 2 ). Similar differences in structure of 3% UTRs have been observed among IBV strains (Williams et al., 1993; Sapats et al., 1996) . IBV strains (Beaudette, KB8523, CU-T2) have been shown to possess 3% UTRs of 503-505 nucleotides (Boursnell et al., 1985; Sutou et al., 1988) . IBV (M41) was found to differ from other strains in that it possessed a 3% UTR of 320 bases; compared with other IBV strains, M41 lacked a 183-196 nucleotide sequence occurring four bases downstream of the N gene (Boursnell et al., 1985; Sapats et al., 1996) . The significance of these differences in the 3% UTRs has not been determined (Collisson et al., 1990; Sapats et al., 1996) . Comparison of 3% UTRs of TCV strains (Minnesota, Indiana, NC95) and published sequences of three IBV strains (Beaudette, KB8523, M41) demonstrated a sequence identity greater than 78% (data not shown). TCV strains had a 90.8-96.0% sequence similarity when compared to each other, and 78.5-94.4% similarity to IBV. TCV 3% UTRs had less than 30% similarity with those of BCV (Mebus) and TGEV (Purdue). In these comparisons the large deletions in the 5% portion of the 3% UTR of TCV (NC95) and IBV (M41) were counted as single differences, rather than considering each missing base as a separate difference. Williams et al. (1993) previously compared 3% UTR sequences of several different IBV strains, comparing them in two sections: the 5% region not found in IBV (M41) (184-196 bases) and the remaining bases downstream of this sequence. Results of the study indicated that the 5% end of the IBV 3% UTR is quite variable between strains, ranging from 53.2 to 92.8% identity. In contrast, the sequence downstream of this hypervariable region was highly conserved with 94.3 -97.8% identity (Williams et al., 1993) . In the present study we performed similar comparisons with the TCV 3% UTR sequence data (data not shown). The 5% region of the 3% UTR (153 bases) of TCV (Minnesota) and TCV (Indiana) had 94.7% identity with each other and 57.8 -90.4% identity with IBV strains (Beaudette, KB8523). The remaining bases of the 3% UTR of TCV strains (Minnesota, Indiana, NC95) had 96.5 -97.8% sequence identity when compared to each other, and 91.7 -95.2% identity to IBV strains (Beaudette, KB8523, M41). In summary, the amino acid sequence of TCV N protein and the nucleotide sequence of the 3% UTR were compared with published sequences of other avian and mammalian coronaviruses. The size and sequence characteristics of the TCV N protein and 3% UTR closely resembled those of IBV strains, thus supporting previous antigenic analyses and nucleotide sequence studies that indicated a close relationship between TCV and IBV (Breslin et al., 1999; Guy et al., 1997; Stephensen et al., 1999) . Together, these findings refute previous studies that indicated a close relationship between TCV and group II coronaviruses (Dea et al., 1990; Verbeek and Tijssen, 1991) . These findings instead indicate that the avian coronaviruses, IBV and TCV, share a close phylogenetic relationship and together comprise group III of the coronavirus major antigenic groups.
