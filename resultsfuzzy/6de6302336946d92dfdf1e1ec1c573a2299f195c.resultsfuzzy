Skewness and kurtosis statistics found non-normal distributions for all temporal variables associated with survival. Therefore, nonparametric statistics were employed to yield inferences based on the respective research questions. Between-subjects comparisons for age groups and disease groups were conducted using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-tests. In addition to means and SD, medians and interquartile ranges were reported to give context to non-parametric statistical findings. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to display the cumulative survival of cats across  Consideration began March 1, 2010, and ended May 6, 2011. A total of 102 cats were considered for the study. All cats were diagnosed by their primary care veterinarians. There were 60 cats that met the qualification criteria and were therefore accepted into the study, and 23 of those had been referred to specialists, including veterinary ophthalmologists (12) , internists (6), neurologists (3), ophthalmologist and a neurologist jointly (1), and a veterinary cardiologist (1). The remaining considered cats were disqualified before or during the study for the following reasons: insufficient diagnostic information (10), died before PI arrived (10), wet form FIP (10; PI was provided on a compassionate basis), treatment was stopped after one to two doses (2), overseas cases (2; PI was provided on a compassionate basis), incorrect diagnosis (2; PI was provided to one of the two cats on a compassionate basis), cats that were lost to follow-up because the veterinarian never provided any information after PI was shipped (5) and one cat enrolled in error, i.e., started the treatment prior to March 1, 2010 (1). The accepted cats were evaluated and treated by veterinarians throughout the USA (58), and in Canada (2) in their practices. Fewer than 32% (19 of 60) of the cats were diagnosed at 10 days or less before the start of PI treatment. The remaining 41 cats were diagnosed with dry FIP 11 or more days before the beginning of treatment with PI. The mean time span between the diagnosis and the treatment was 22.97 Â± 21.60 days. The cat that died after the administration of the first dose was diagnosed 161 days before the start of PI treatment.
