Total nine cases have to be run. The inlet velocity considered is 1.0 m/sec, air change rate per hour (ACH) of 12 and inlet temperature is 20Ë™C. Case 1.In this case inlet position is 600 mm in front of west wall & 2300 mm above the floor. Outlet position is 300 mm above the floor & 1700 mm in front of west wall as shown in Fig.1 (a) .Case 2.In this case, inlet position is 1700 mm in front of west wall & 2300 mm above the floor, outlet position is 1400 mm above the floor & 1700 mm in front of west wall as shown in Fig. 1(b) . Case 3.In this case, inlet position is 2800 mm in front of west wall & 2300 mm above the floor, outlet position is 2300 mm above the floor & 1700 mm in front of west wall as shown in Fig. 1(c) . Fig. 2 (a) shows the movement of mass less contaminated particle. The contaminated particle coming from the mouth of patient and moves through tortuous path leaves through the outlet without affecting the doctor and patient. Path of mass less particle is more tortuous Fig. 2 (b) shows the movement of mass less contaminated particle from the mouth of patient. Fig. 2 (c) shows the movement of mass less contaminated particle from the mouth of patient. The contaminated particle coming from the mouth of patient and moves through tortuous path leaves through the outlet without affecting the doctor and patient. The total time taken by the mass less contaminated particle is approximately 2.2 minutes to leave the ICU room. Fig. 3 (a) shows the velocity vector plot on plane x = 1.0 m. The clean cold air is entering through the inlet, moves in region above the occupied zone and directly strikes on opposite wall i.e. north wall. After striking it comes to the lower portion of the room. One clockwise re-circulating zone is formed approximately 4.0 m from the south wall. Fig. 3 (b) shows the velocity vector plot on plane x= 2.0 m. Most of the clean cold air stream passes through the region above the patient. The major directions of airflow are indicated by arrows. The recirculation zone is formed in the right side of bed touching the floor and the distance travelled by it is approximately at 4 m from south wall or 2 m from west wall. The stagnation zone is formed in the top right corner of the ICU. The airflow is uniform and stable, and has the same flow direction near the patient. Some smaller circulation with a slower velocity exits in the region immediately in the exit side and it can be clearly seen that the recirculation zone is formed in the top left corner. The cold air leaving the ICU through outlet has been observed clearly. Fig. 3 (c) shows the velocity vector plot on plane x = 3.0 m. One small clockwise recirculation zone has been observed in top left corner of the ICU i.e. approximately at a distance 0.5 m from the south wall or 3 m from the west wall. It is clearly seen from the velocity vector that almost all the air is travelling from north wall to south wall and striking the doctor.
