Each diagnostic test offered by a laboratory has the potential for both false-positive and false-negative results. As with diagnostic testing in the live animal, each result should be interpreted within the context of the clinical findings and gross or histologic abnormalities. Interpretation of serology results is particularly precarious as a positive result may only indicate exposure or vaccination rather than true infection and cause of abortion or neonatal death. If you have questions about interpretation of results, contact the specialists at the diagnostic laboratory for further explanation.
