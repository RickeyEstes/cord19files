Overall structure of NDM-1 from homology modeling As the multiple sequences alignment shown in Figure 1A , among VIM-4 (B1 subclass), CphA (B2 subclass) and FEZ-1 (B3 subclasses), NDM-1 is highly homologous to the B1 subclass (VIM-4, sequence identity is 37%). In addition, sequence alignment indicates that NDM-1 contains the identical coordinating residues (His-His-His) in the Zn 2+ (I)-binding site and (Asp-Cys-His) in the Zn 2+ (II)-binding site of the B1 subclass, which implies that NDM-1 belongs to the B1 subclass of MBLs. Accordingly, the crystal structure of VIM-4 (PDB ID: 2WHG) was used as the template in homology modeling [8] . As shown in Figure 1B , the overall structure of NDM-1 shares the common characteristic folding of ab/ba sandwich, which resembles the architectural features in other B1 subclass. The active site of NDM-1 is highly homologous to that of VIM-4. In the active site (Figure 2A ), Zn 2+ (I) is coordinated with three conserved histidine residues 120, 122 and 189, while Zn 2+ (II) is coordinated with the conserved residues Asp124, Cys208 and His250, which is exactly consistent with the X-ray crystal structures [9, 10] . A water molecule bridging both zinc ions acts as the nucleophile during the b-lactam hydrolysis. Two mobile loops in the active site shown in Figure 1B are crucial for substrate recognition, binding and catalysis in MBLs [11, 12] . In NDM-1, the loop1, also called the flapping loop, is composed of amino acids LDMPGFGAVA (residues 65-74). Compared with the loop1 (QSFDGAVYP) in VIM-2 and VIM-4, the size of the active site cavity is enlarged with less bulky amino acids, suggesting a broader substrate profile. Besides it is worth noting that it is more hydrophobic than others [9] . There is only one benzene ring of Phe70 in the middle of the loop1 of NDM-1, and the side-chains of Asp66 and Met67 pointed to the solvent, the less bulky amino acids, especially for the glycines, are proposed to make the loop1 more flexible for substrate binding. In the crystal structure of NDM-1 in complex with hydrolyzed ampicillin (PDB ID: 3Q6X) [9] , the loop1 represents a more open state compared with our model, while in the crystal structure of apo NDM-1 (PDB ID: 3S0Z) [10] , the loop1 displays a semi-closed state. Consequently, it is proposed to undergo significant conformational changes during the substrate binding, in different states with or without substrate. Regarding the loop2, Arg185 and Asn190 in VIM-2 was proved to play important roles for substrate binding, catalysis and inhibition through H-bond interactions [12, 13] . While in NDM-1, the arginine is mutated to Ala215, which also enlarges the size of active site cavity. Moreover, Lys211 instead of Tyr181 in VIM-2, probably plays the similar role of Arg185 in VIM-2 by forming electrostatic interaction with the carboxyl of substrate. The detailed comparison of the two loops in NDM-1 and VIM-2 is shown in Figure 2B . Furthermore, two residues, Lys125 and Tyr229, were pointed to play crucial roles in stabilizing the conformation of the active site, through H-bond network (with residues Asn76, Asp90, Thr91, His122 and Ser249) and hydrophobic interactions (with residues Leu209, Leu218, Leu221 and Leu269) [9] . Besides the unique residues in the two loops, the N terminus of NDM-1 is longer than other analogues. Even without modeled in our structure, it is speculated to assist in loop1 packing so as to affect the hydrolytic catalysis. NDM-1 also contains an additional insert between residues 162 and 166, which is not present in other MBLs. Since the insert is in the opposite side of the active site, with a distance of around 20 Ã… , its role in the hydrolysis reaction is still unknown. In summary, the unique structural characteristics probably contributes to the more potent hydrolysis and broader substrate range of the novel MBL-NDM-1, especially for those bulkier antibiotics, which are not degraded by other MBLs.
