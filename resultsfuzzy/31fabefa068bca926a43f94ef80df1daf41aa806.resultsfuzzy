We aimed to develop an in vivo platform for accelerated and directed evolution of RHDV antigenic variants. Since RHDV cannot presently be grown in cell culture, variant viruses were selected by serial passaging through laboratory rabbits with increasing doses of the RHDVspecific mab 1H3 (Fig 1) . As a control for background substitution rates, nine virus passages were performed in animals that did not receive antibody.
