In conventional PCR assays, false positive results are most commonly caused by contamination of PCR reactions with amplification products from previous tests or by carryover of homologous genomic DNA. Alternatively, false positive results may arise from non-specific binding of primers to irrelevant sequences. The latter problem is greatly reduced in real-time PCR assays implementing specific hybridization probes that lead to the generation of fluorescence signals only upon binding to the amplified products. Although in real-time PCR assays performed on fluorescence-based instruments, the absence of post-amplification handling greatly reduces the risk of contamination by PCR products, it is important to bear in mind that this problem is not entirely eliminated. Contamination may occur by leakage from tubes or microtiter plates with lids not tightly closed or by breakage of glass capillaries leading to spillage of the amplification mixture. If the nucleotide dTTP is substituted by dUTP in all PCR reactions, amplicons will differ from genomic DNA by the presence of dUTP. In this instance, the problem of contamination with PCR products can be easily reduced by implementing a digestion step with Uracil-DNA-glycosylase (UNG) prior to each amplification reaction. When using this pretreatment in PCR reactions, digestion of newly synthesized PCR product is prevented by heat-mediated inactivation of the enzyme before the start of amplification . Although the routine use of UNG is highly effective, it does not completely eradicate the problem of contamination. In virus analysis, an important source of carryover contamination is patient material containing high titers of a viral pathogen, which is not affected by enzymatic digestion using UNG. The risk of contamination by extraneous viral nucleic acids can be reduced by extremely careful handling of clinical samples by skilled personnel, strict separation of working areas and other well established precautions recommended for PCR work (Kwok and Higuchi, 1989; Sarkar and Sommer, 1990; Scherczinger et al., 1999; Bustin, 2002) . Moreover, multiple negative controls, i.e. reactions lacking any template, the so-called ''no-template controls (NTCs)'', and reactions including non-homologous template, the ''no-amplification controls (NACs)'', must be included in each assay to permit the identification of contamination and prevent false interpretation of positive results. In view of the great sensitivity of PCR, the occurrence of false negative results is a highly underestimated problem. The absence of positive signals in samples containing the viral target may result from inhibitory substances present in the clinical specimen analyzed, from low efficiency or failure of viral nucleic acid extraction, from inadequate PCR amplification or, in case of RNA virus analysis, from inefficient reverse transcription. The efficiency of nucleic acid isolation, reverse transcription and amplification can be assessed by adding a defined standard to the samples before each of these steps. Artificial constructs generated by cloning of the specific viral target sequence into a plasmid are often used as external controls for the amplification step. However, the handling of plasmids harboring the targeted nucleic acid sequence is a dangerous source of contamination. In order to avoid the risk of crosscontamination and to include well defined internal controls with physical properties similar to those of the target of interest, it is recommended to spike the specimens with non-human, naturally occurring viruses (see below). Alternatively, the so-called ''armored RNA'' technology can be implemented as an internal control, where the samples investigated are spiked with a known concentration of a synthetic RNA standard protected from degradation by packaging in pseudoviral particles (Pasloske et al., 1998) . In our laboratory, we use the phocine (=seal) herpes virus type 1 (PhHV) as a DNA virus control and the phocine distemper virus (PDV) as an RNA virus control (both were kindly provided to us by Niesters, Department of Virology, University Hospital Rotterdam, the Netherlands). Clinical specimens to be tested for the presence and quantity of DNA viruses are spiked with a defined amount of PhHV prior to processing. The presence or absence of the expected level of fluorescent signal obtained upon real-time amplification of the control virus permits the assessment of the efficiency of nucleic acid isolation and possible effects of inhibitory agents on the amplification step. Similarly, clinical specimens to be investigated by real-time PCR for RNA viruses are spiked with defined quantities of PDV (Niesters, 2002; Watzinger et al., 2004) . After RNA extraction and reverse transcription, the amount of control virus is determined by real-time PCR analysis. The presence of the expected result indicates adequate extraction and reverse transcription of viral RNA and the lack of any inhibitory effects on amplification. The results of quantitative virus analysis in clinical specimens are deemed eligible for evaluation only if quantitative analysis of the respective control virus reveals a readout in the expected range.
