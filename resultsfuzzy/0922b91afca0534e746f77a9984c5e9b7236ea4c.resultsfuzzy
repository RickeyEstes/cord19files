2.1. Analysis of SARS-3CL pro binding site requirements The 33.8 kDa SARS-3CL pro enzyme is a functional homodimer and shows three structural domains with an antiparallel b-barrel-shaped structure akin to the serine protease Chymotrypsin. The active site is located in a groove between the domains I and II and is a fairly solvent exposed and shallow cavity. The enzyme is an atypical cysteine protease, containing a catalytic diad (His41-Cys145) instead of a triad. Multiple crystal structures of SARS-3CL pro with co-crystallized inhibitors (1UK4, 19 2AMD, 20 The co-crystallized peptidic Michael-acceptor based inhibitor 9IN, from the SARS-3CL pro structure (2AMD, PDB code), is structurally analogous to the Cbz protected hexapeptide-CMK (chloro methyl ketone) inhibitor (1UK4, PDB code) and undergoes similar binding site interactions. Therefore, the cocrystallized pose of 9IN ( Fig. 2a and b) is used here to describe the relevant binding site interactions and the enzyme's subsite specificity. Mutation studies 44 have been carried out on the substrates of related coronavirus proteases to understand the specificity at each of the binding subsites and the effect of these mutations on the substrate binding and catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. It was found that the mutations at the P1 position produced the most significant loss in enzyme activity and the corresponding S1 sub site is very specific to a Glutamine residue. The other subsites of interest were S1 0 , S2, and S4 and the preferred substrate amino acid side chains for these sites were S1 0 (alanine/serine), S2 (leucine), and S4 (valine/serine). In case of the 9IN cocrystallized pose, the b-carbon of the Michael acceptor forms a covalent bond with the sulfur of the catalytic cysteine (Cys145). The cyclized ketoglutamine group occupies the S1 subsite and acts as an entropically favored surrogate for the glutamine side chain of the native substrate. The carbonyl oxygen of the ketoglutamine group undergoes a hydrogen bonding interaction with His163 while the ring amide NH forms a hydrogen bond donor interaction with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Phe140. The side chain of Glu166 is also in close vicinity to form a hydrogen bond interaction with the ring amide NH group after minor rotameric adjustment. An interaction of this nature between the nitrogen of the P1-glutamine side chain or its surrogate and the side chain carboxylate oxygen of Glu166 is seen in the crystal structure of SARS-3CL pro inhibited by an aza peptide epoxide 22 (2A5I, PDB code) as well as a peptidic aldehyde 29 (2GX4, PDB code) based inhibitor. The S2 (His41, Met49, Tyr54) and S4 (Met 130, Pro163, Gln192) subsites are primarily hydrophobic in nature and are occupied by a leucine and valine residue, respectively. The terminal ethyl group of the ligand occupies the S1 0 site and undergoes hydrophobic interactions with Thr25 and Leu27. Additional hydrogen bonds are noticed between the peptidic backbone of the ligand and the residues Glu166, Gln189, and Thr190. Overall, the presence of hydrophobic groups at the S1 0 , S2, and S4 sites and a hydrogen bond acceptor at the S1 0 site can be considered as critical pharmacophoric requirements ( Fig. 2c) for the binding of putative inhibitors.
