Fig . 3 shows the evolution of the population fractions S n , S b , I b and I m using parameters β = 4, s 0 = 0.8 and ε = 10 −4 , noting that the mutation rate ε is small in the simulations with two distinct cases of bird-human infection rate µ = 1 and µ = 10 −4 . We observe that there is an initial time period (t < T L ), in which when µ = 10 −4 the majority of the population is unaffected by the disease, whereas for µ = 1 the susceptible bird-handlers, S b , are steadily acquiring the bird-human transmissible form of the disease. At around the time indicated by the vertical line (t = T L ), the epidemic of the mutated transmissible form begins affecting the whole population. One of the interesting features in these simulations is this apparent time lag before the onset of the epidemic, moreover the occurrence of the bird-human transmissible form appears to be negligible during the epidemic. We note increasing ε moves the t = T L line to the left, whereby for ε = O(1) there is no delay in the emergence of the mutated flu epidemic. We investigated the model in two biologically relevant cases using singular perturbation theory, namely (1) ε → 0 and µ → 0 and (2) ε → 0 and µ = O(1). Since case (1) is most relevant for avian flu, whereby the rates of bird-human disease transmission and mutation are very low, we present the analysis in some detail in Section 4.1, whilst that for case (2) is briefly summarised in Section 4.2. The method used provides a systematic process by which the solutions of the model are separated as a sequence of timescales, within which the dominant processes are identified and represented by reduced versions of the equations. The aim is to determine, in terms of the model's parameters, key quantities that characterise an epidemic, namely • the epidemic's basic reproduction number R 0 , as defined just before Section 2.1. • the timescale for the onset of the epidemic T L following the first cases of the bird-human transmissible form of the disease. • the maximum level of infected individuals at one time I max . • the fraction of the population to have contracted the disease given by the final size of the removed class R ∞ . • the duration of the epidemic T σ , defined to be the time in which the fraction of population who are infected by the mutated disease, I m , is above a threshold value σ . The analysis of Section 3 goes some way to answer the fourth quantity, however, the analysis below will give good approximations to the model predictions for all five quantities in the cases of ε, µ → 0, as demonstrated in the next section, and ε → 0 and µ = O(1). 4.1. The case ε ≪ 1 and µ ≪ 1 As demonstrated in the numerical solutions shown in Fig. 3 , the low rates of infection µ ≪ 1 and mutation ε ≪ 1 will result in an initial phase of low epidemiological activity, before the epidemic erupts and dies away. These phases will be made explicit by the analysis below. The first phase involves the equilibration in population of those infected by the bird-human transmissible form of avian flu over an t = O(1) timescale. We will focus mainly on the leading order solutions of the variables in each timescale, which enables ε and µ to be independently small with the formal restriction of ln(1/ε) ≪ 1/µ. This restriction states that the timescale for a mutation event (1/ε) is much less than the exponential of the timescale for cross-species transmission (e 1/µ ) and arises from the time at which the solutions of the first timescale breakdown (see Section 4.1.1). The analysis for the case ln(1/ε) ≫ 1/µ follows that of the ε → 0 and µ = O(1) limit summarised in Section 4.2 and the distinguishing features of these two limiting cases merge when ln(1/ε) ∼ 1/µ (analysed in Appendix A to determine an expression for R 0 ). We note, in order to distinguish variables for particular timescales, different superscript symbols are used.
