Almost all infected pigs showed clinical symptoms typical for PRRSV infection and similar to a previous study with the same PRRSV strain [11] . Increased rectal temperatures were detected for more than 14 days, and edema of the eyelids and conjunctivitis for more than 21 days. There was no significant dietary effect on fever magnitude and duration (Figure 1 A,B) . Other clinical signs such as cough were observed only sporadically and lasted only for 1-2 days. Regarding the weight gain, we could only analyze the effect of the Zn med diet for the vaccinated groups, given that 4 time points were missing for the pigs receiving the Zn high pigs. For the remaining time points as well as for the non-vaccinated groups we found no benefits of feeding higher dietary Zn levels (Figure 1 C,D) . Mean PRRSV load in serum as determined by qPCR peaked at 4 dpi and gradually reduced later on. Neither vaccination nor elevated Zn levels showed an influence on PRRSV viremia at any time during the observation period (Figure 2 A,B) . The same was observed regarding virus shedding as determined by analysis of nasal swabs (Figure 2 C,D) . Persistent virus was found at 35 dpi in the majority of tonsil samples, regardless of diet, while all lung and tracheobronchial lymph node samples were tested negative for the presence of PRRSV genomes. PRRSV-specific IgG and IgM antibodies were not detected by ELISA in randomly chosen samples (10 vaccinated/13 non-vaccinated) before infection on day 21 before infection. On day 0, only one vaccinated animal was positive for PRRSV antibodies (Figure 3 A,B) . This is in contrast with previous results showing earlier seroconversion after vaccination with UV-inactivated LV [7] and might be due to the fact that we used a cell culture-adapted non-purified LV with possibly decreased immunogenicity compared to purified LV grown on porcine alveolar macrophages used in the cited study. At 7 dpi, piglets from all groups were seropositive, except for 1 pig each in the vaccinated and non-vaccinated Zn low groups. Higher (P â‰¤ 0.01) antibody levels were detected in vaccinated groups than in non-vaccinated groups at 7 and 21 dpi after PRRSV challenge, while the diet had no influence on antibody levels. The generation of neutralizing antibodies is delayed in PRRSV infection and usually appears three to four weeks after infection [12] . Accordingly, in our study virus neutralizing VN antibodies were not detectable until 28 dpi in the serum. A single-vaccination with an inactivated LV did not lead to an earlier induction of VN antibodies, but vaccinated groups developed higher (P = 0.045) VN antibody titers than their non-vaccinated counterparts at 35 dpi ( Figure 3C, D) . A tendency towards higher VN antibody levels was evident in pigs receiving higher levels of Zn (Zn med ) at 28 dpi. This tendency continued to 35 dpi in both Zn med and Zn high groups. Thus, the possibility remains that animals receiving higher dietary Zn levels might be better protected against reinfection with PRRSV. The number of IFN-gamma-SC at 35 dpi revealed no differences after homologous or heterologous re-stimulation (Additional file 1). Flow cytometry analysis of PBMC phenotypes was performed weekly from day 0 to day 35 post infection. Single vaccination only delayed but not prevented the PRRSV-induced decrease of CD4 + , CD8 + and CD4 + CD8 + T cell populations, which are important for viral clearance [13] . We found no sustained effect of dietary Zn levels on any of the analysed cell subsets (Additional file 2). Necropsies at 35 dpi revealed no gross lung lesions and lymphoid hyperplasia in tonsils, lymph nodes or spleen in any of the pigs. Overall, the study shows that challenge infection with a wild-type PRRSV without additional environmental and social stress and the impact of secondary infections results in relatively mild clinical signs. Under these conditions, elevated dietary Zn levels could not provide enhanced protection against infection with a type I PRRSV field strain and could not improve efficacy after a singlevaccination with a heterologous inactivated vaccine.
