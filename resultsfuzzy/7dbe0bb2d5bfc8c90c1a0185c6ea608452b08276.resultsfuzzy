We received a total of 35 responses, of which seven (20%) were from organic farms. Most farms (20, 60%) had a single hen house. The number of houses (and, thus, flocks) per farm varied between one and five. Altogether, we received information on 58 flocks, of which 14 were organic flocks. The number of farms represents about 13% of 270 Finnish laying hen farms with ≥300 laying hens, and 15% of the farms that were estimated to have been reached by the questionnaire. In organic farms, the average flock size was 2700 ± 150 hens (median 3000 hens, 1100-3000 hens), and in conventional production 17400 ± 1600 hens (median 16,100 hens, 1400-49,000 hens). The most common flock size was 3000 hens (nine houses, 16%). The majority of respondents (31, 88%) represented solely egg producing farms, and the remaining four farms had pullet rearing in addition to egg production. According to current statistics [34] , in Finland, nearly half of laying hen flocks (47%) consist of 10,000-< 30,000 birds, and 38% of the flocks are larger. The maximum legal size of an organic laying hen flock is 3000 birds [35] . We thus assume that the respondent farms represent Finnish egg producing farms reasonably well. Due to the low response rate, the results should be considered with some reservation. The low response rate may reflect attitudes of Finnish farmers towards pecking problems: Pecking-related problems are not considered very important. Further, the results may be influenced by voluntary participation, which always affects the selection of responses. The respondents had a long experience of egg production, on average 18 ± 1.7 years, ranging from 1.5 to 40 years. The production equipment was installed in hen houses between 1995 and 2016, most commonly in 2010 (14 houses, 24%). On most farms, hens were kept in enriched cages (26 farms, 45%), of which 22 (85%) had large enriched cages for groups of >20 hens and the remainder had small enriched cages with groups of <20 hens. An aviary system was used in 18 (31%) of the houses and a floor system in 14 (24%) of the houses. In organic production, eight flocks were in floor houses and six in aviary systems. One third of the respondents (11, 32%) stated having experience of different production systems. Unfortunately, we did not ask of which different systems with which the respondents had experience. To a certain extent, we can assume that most respondents had experience of traditional cage systems because, before 2012, nearly 80% of eggs were produced in traditional cages [34] . Altogether 14 respondents estimated the differences between production systems with respect to pecking problems. In these responses, enriched cages were most often (12 responses) considered to be the easiest. There were different opinions on which system is the most difficult system, with respect to feather and cannibalistic pecking, and all systems were mentioned at least once. However, floor systems were most commonly, in seven responses, considered to be the most challenging system. In Finland, in 2017, 62% of table eggs sold via egg packaging centres (74% of total egg consumption) were produced in enriched cages [34] . The farms with enriched cages are generally larger compared with the other production systems and, therefore, the proportion of farms with enriched cages is lower (40%) than the total number of laying hen farms. Aviary systems are used in 21% of the Finnish laying hen farms and floor systems in 31% of farms [36] . Together, deep litter and aviary systems account for about one third (32%) of the total egg production [34] . However, the statistics show a trend of decreasing production in enriched cages and increasing production in aviary systems [36] . Currently, organic production covers only about 5% of all egg production [34] and represent 15% of egg producing farms because these farms are generally smaller compared with the other production systems [36] . To date, free-range production is practiced in only 8% of egg-producing farms [36] . In the questionnaire responses, the proportion of organic production appears to be slightly overrepresented. Nonetheless, we can assume that the respondent farms represent the Finnish situation reasonably well. Due to climatic conditions, outside ranging poultry represents a minority in Finnish egg production. Possibly, due to minimal experience, the respondents did not indicate that free-range or organic systems represented particularly difficult systems. According to earlier research, severe feather pecking has been reported to occur more commonly and severely among organic poultry [8] . However, systems with outdoor range are also considered as to reduce the risk for pecking, and pecking-related problems decrease along with increased outside range usage [7, 15, 24, 37] . On the other hand, in many countries, the situation in relation to pecking problems may differ considerably between organic and conventional production because beak trimming is not as common a practice in organic egg production as it is in conventional production [8] . Severe feather pecking appears more regularly among non-beak-trimmed birds [1, 7] resulting in worse plumage condition [7, 29, 30] . In Finland, all egg production is with hens with intact beaks, consequently equalizing the production systems from that perspective. The banning of beak trimming in Finland apparently had no major effect on laying hen management because all respondents stated that they had not changed their management due to the ban on beak trimming. This is understandable because even when beak trimming was allowed it was never adopted as a routine procedure in Finnish egg production and thus the change in the law was fundamentally without effect on the lives of poultry farmers. Although the respondents had long experience of egg production, not many had been producing eggs before the ban. Yet, on many farms, egg production may have been practised before the current farmer, and the experience of the former farmer could have been transferred to the current farmer. This assumption is supported by a comment of a farmer, with 18 years of experience of conventional egg production: "There have been no disadvantages of the non-beak-trimming policy. On our farm, we have had chickens for over 40 years without pecking problems." The vast majority of respondents (26, 74%) declared that they most definitely would not use beak-trimmed hens even if it were allowed (Table 1) . Motivation against beak trimming was explained by considering it to be an unnecessary and unethical procedure. A couple of respondents also stated that using non-beak-trimmed hens boosted the image of egg production, and that beak trimming would cause unnecessary costs. A farmer, with 29 years of experience in conventional egg production, stated that: "I do not know why we should torment the animal when there are no advantages gained by beak trimming. Only expenses and suffering." Only two respondents indicated that they probably would use beak-trimmed hens were it permitted. One of these respondents did not provide any explanation for the opinion, while the other supported beak trimming because it would make management easier. The Finnish egg producers' attitudes appear to strongly support non-beak-trimming policy, but not without discord. As a comparison, tail docking in pig production is also banned and the majority of Finnish pig farmers (61%) support non-tail-docking policy [38] . The consensus among egg producers seems even stronger than among pig farmers. Finnish pig farmers motivated their stance against tail docking with ethical arguments [38] , thus using similar reasons as the egg producers in the current questionnaire. Among Finnish pig producers, tail docking was often supported for economic reasons and because it made management easier [38] .
