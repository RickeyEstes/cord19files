Calculation of test performance parameters for a subset of 43 samples collected from calves that were known to have been diarrhoeic at the time of sample collection gave values for sensitivity and specificity of 89.7% (95% CI 72.6%, 97.8%) and 100.0% (95% CI 76.8%, 100.0%), respectively, for the sucrose wet mount test. The sensitivity and specificity of the lateral immunochromatography test as calculated for this subset of samples were 86.2% (95% CI 68.3%, 96.1%) and 100.0% (95% CI 76.8%, 100.0%), respectively. Cohen's kappa statistic of agreement between the PCR and sucrose wet mount test was 0.85 (95% CI 0.69, 1.00), between the PCR and lateral immunochromatography tests was 0.80 (95% CI 0.62, 0.98) and between the sucrose wet mount and the lateral immunochromatography tests was 0.85 (95% CI 0.70, 1.00).
