We have investigated the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV (Table 1) in the BASCs present in lungs and attempted to establish the role of BASC-miRNAs towards understanding the pathogenesis of SARS in lung fibrosis. We describe the role of BASCs as the target cells of SARS infection and show how a repertoire of BASC miRNAs act as molecular switches to contribute to this host-pathogen interaction.
