Goelet sequence DNA synthesis from modular clones Thirty sets of long-oligonucleotides with complementary, overlapping ends were chemically synthesized for construction of a linear DNA molecule encoding the Goelet TMV sequence (Figure 1 ). The DNA molecule also was designed to encode the T7 RNA polymerase promoter for RNA transcription in vitro and to have flanking sequences for PCR amplification. Sets of longoligonucleotides were assembled to create 15, approximately 480 bp DNA modules ( Figure 1 ) that were cloned in plasmids and sequenced. Only six clones for each construct needed to be screened to find at least one with a perfect module sequence, except in one case where it required the screening of 13 clones. The frequency of correct to incorrect modules and the error rate were similar to those previously reported for modules used to synthesize the mouse mitochondrial genome [26] . DNA was amplified from the modules, and the fulllength DNA molecule of the Goelet sequence, called 1-30, was enzymatically synthesized from overlapping intermediates using 3 PCR steps for a total of 60 cycles ( Figure 1 ) and was accomplished in 2 to 3 days by the author (fragment size selection by gel purification was the most time consuming step). This time estimate is consistent with the 5-day estimate reported for the PCR synthesis and enzymatic assembly of the mouse mitochondrial genome, which is roughly double the size [26] . 7-Methyl guanosine capped-RNA was transcribed in vitro from gel purified PCR product of 1-30 and was inoculated to Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi NN (tobacco), but no hypersensitive local lesions, the classic marks of infection, appeared. By contrast, the same amounts of RNA from DNA made by PCR amplification of the control plasmid pFL-TMV-NA, a known infectious TMV cDNA clone expressed by a T7 promoter [14, 27] , did produce local lesions on NN tobacco. FL-TMV-NA RNA, however, only produced 4 to 10 local lesions per leaf, which suggested low inoculation potential. Because TMV RNA is susceptible to nuclease degradation and is less infectious than packaged virus [28] , the transcribed RNA was encapsidated in vitro with CP isolated from purified FL-TMV-NA virions. On the basis of the number of local lesions, encapsidation improved the infectivity of control FL-TMV-NA RNA by three to five times (purified CP preparations by themselves did not produce symptoms). The CP then was used to encapsidate 1-30 RNA, but the preparation still did not produce local lesions on NN tobacco or mosaic symptoms on Xanthi nn tobacco (SX), the classic systemicsymptom host. The experiment was repeated, but again 1-30 virus was not infectious.
