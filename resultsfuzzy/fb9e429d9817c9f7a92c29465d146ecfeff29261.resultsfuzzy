The Griess assay results revealed a large increase in BAL • NO levels of PRCV-infected pigs, but not in PRRSV single-infected pigs. The PRRSV/PRCV dual-and PRCV BAL samples were collected from each pig (n = 1 at all PIDs for mock and PRRSV single-infected pigs, n = 1-2 at each PID for PRRSV/PRCV dual-and PRCV single-infected pigs). All data are expressed as the means ± SDM. (C) Mean BAL • NO levels in four independent animal trials. BAL samples were collected from each pig (n = 4 at all PIDs for mock and PRRSV single-infected pigs, n = 4-6 at each PID for PRRSV/PRCV dual-and PRCV single-infected pigs). All data are expressed as the means ± SEM. Pigs were first inoculated with PRRSV or mock and, 10 days later, inoculated with PRCV or mock. Total • NO (nitrite and nitrate) in BAL fluids were measured by the Griess method. All assays were performed in duplicate. single-infected pigs had 2.4-14 times higher BAL • NO levels at PRCV PID 2-10 than the mock control pigs (Fig. 1A-C) , although there were no significant differences in mean • NO levels among treatment groups due to high variability among pigs. In our Greiss assays, large variability in BAL • NO levels was observed among the four independent animal trials. In mock control pigs, mean BAL • NO levels showed a wide range from 2.5 to 16.63 M/ml among the four trials. For this reason, no significant differences were detected in mean BAL • NO levels among the four experimental groups in our study. These results also might be explained by use of outbred pigs and different storage times for the BAL samples after collection, because of large intervals between each animal trial. However, the trend toward increased BAL • NO levels in PRCV-infected pigs at PRCV PID 2-10 was consistent and reproducible ( Fig. 1A-C) . As verified by others (Cox et al., 1990 ) and in our previous studies using the PRCV ISU-1 strain (Jung et al., 2007 (Jung et al., , 2009 , at PRCV PID 2 and 4 (acute stage of infection), PRCV mainly infected upper and lower pulmonary epithelial cells (bronchial/bronchiolar epithelial cells and type 2 pneumocytes) and caused cytolysis, which coincided with the highest BAL • NO levels among all PIDs. Pulmonary epithelial cells are known to contribute to substantial increased levels of • NO in respiratory viral infections (Xu et al., 2006) , whereas porcine AMs are likely to be less involved in induction of • NO production in the respiratory tract (Pampusch et al., 1998) . Thus, the elevated BAL NO levels following PRCV infection might originate as a result of viral-induced damage to pulmonary epithelial cells; subsequently, the increased • NO might also contribute to further damage to the pulmonary epithelial cells. In addition, we speculate that the persisting, increased BAL • NO levels at PRCV PID 8 and 10 also might be associated with the large numbers of AMs and lymphocytes infiltrating the lungs in parallel with necrosis of respiratory epithelial cells occurring during the same period. However, further studies are needed to identify if iNOS gene expression or if • NO amounts are increased in AMs and lymphocytes following PRCV infection, although unlike murine macrophages, porcine macrophages stimulated by either IFN-␥ or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) did not induce • NO production (Pampusch et al., 1998) . We suggest that respiratory CoVs such as PRCV that infect pulmonary epithelial cells and cause cytolysis, induce • NO production in the lungs. Based on the results, SARS-CoV that caused massive necrosis of pulmonary epithelial cells such as type 1 and 2 pneumocytes, similar to that observed in lungs of PRCV-infected pigs (Gu and Korteweg, 2007; Jung et al., 2007) , might also induce • NO production in the respiratory tract. It is unknown whether SARS-CoV induces • NO production in the lungs and serum of patients (Akerstrom et al., 2005) . In humans, concentrations of exhaled • NO are measured in some clinical cases to monitor the progress of pulmonary diseases, such as asthma and viral pneumonia (Xu et al., 2006) . Our study demonstrated that as compared with earlier PIDs, BAL • NO levels decreased dramatically on PRCV PID 14 by which time PRCV-induced pneumonia had mostly resolved ( Fig. 1A and B) (Jung et al., 2009) . Thus, • NO levels might be monitored as an indicator of the progression of bronchopneumonia induced by PRCV, or possibly other respiratory CoVs, and to monitor the effectiveness of treatment. The IFN-␥ contributes to • NO production by inducing iNOS gene expression in AMs and pulmonary epithelial cells during the late stages of viral infection (Xu et al., 2006) . In our previous study, we noted elevated IFN-␥ serum levels beyond PRCV PID 10 in PRRSV/PRCV dual-infected pigs compared to either group of PRRSV or PRCV singleinfected pigs, which might be associated with the more severe pneumonia in dual-infected pigs (Jung et al., 2009) . Therefore, we hypothesized that increased IFN-␥ serum levels followed by elevated • NO production in lung of the dual-infected pigs might be related to the exacerbated pneumonic lesions. In pigs infected with the influenza H1N2 virus, increased BAL IFN-␥ levels at PID 7-10 coincided with increased BAL • NO levels during the same period, possibly promoting viral clearance from the lungs during the middle and late stages of infection (Jung et al., 2004) . In contrast, our study demonstrated that the trend toward increased Th1 (IFN-␥) serum cytokine responses beyond 14 days after PRCV single or PRRSV/PRCV coinfection resulted in the reverse trend of decreased BAL • NO levels in the PRCV single and PRRSV/PRCV dual-infected pigs. Thus, the induced • NO levels in BAL of PRCV singly and PRCV/PRRSV dually infected pigs might not be related to the increased Th1 (IFN-␥) serum and lung cytokine responses. In PRRSV single-infected pigs, BAL • NO levels were unchanged at PRCV PID 2-14 (PRRSV PID 12-24) compared to mock control pigs (Fig. 1A-C) . Nevertheless, during the test period, high PRRSV titers in lungs and severe pneu-monia were observed in PRRSV single-infected pigs as reported earlier (Jung et al., 2009) . Our results concur with a prior report showing that • NO levels in BAL of experimentally PRRSV (strain VR2332)-infected pigs were not increased at PID 2 and 9 (Pampusch et al., 1998) , although the infected pigs had viremia at these PIDs. Our study was expanded to confirm whether PRRSV induces • NO production in AMs, the major target cells for viral replication. Briefly, AMs-rich BAL cells (1 × 10 6 cells/ml) collected from the lungs of a five-day-old gnotobiotic pig were infected with either North American PRRSV VR2332 (10 5 TCID 50 /ml) or MN184 (10 5 TCID 50 /ml). At PTH 24, (0, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 M) , and cell supernatants were harvested at PTH 24 and 48 for the Griess assay. (B and D) The antiviral effects of • NO on PRCV replication in ST cells and PRRSV replication in MARC145 cells, respectively. The SNAP-treated, virus-infected and SNAP-untreated, virus-infected cells were infected with PRCV or PRRSV (10 5-6 TCID50/ml), with or without SNAP, respectively. At PTH 24 and 48, the cells were fixed in 95% ethanol and the TCID50/ml was titrated by immunofluorescent staining using virusspecific monoclonal antibodies (SDOW-17 for PRRSV and 25H7/14E3 for PRCV). The TCID50/ml was calculated according to the Reed and Muench method. All assays were performed independently three times. All data are expressed as the means ± SEM. Asterisks (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01) indicate statistically significant differences between SNAP-treated, virus-infected and SNAP-untreated, virus-infected cells by unpaired Student's t-test. 48 and 60, the cell culture medium was harvested for the Greiss assay. There were no statistically significant differences in • NO levels in the cell culture medium between PRRSV-and mock-infected AMs, although large numbers of PRRSV antigen-containing AMs were confirmed by immunofluorescent staining during the test period (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that although PRRSV induces severe apoptotic death of AMs in lungs, it may not induce • NO in the respiratory tract, and that • NO might not play a critical role in the pathogenesis of PRRSV. From antiviral assays of • NO induced by PRCV infection, treatment with 800 M SNAP in ST cells produced maximum • NO levels of 1.07 and 1.51 mM/ml in a dosedependent manner at PTH 24 and 48, respectively. The • NO significantly inhibited PRCV replication in ST cells at PTH 24 (P < 0.05) and 48 (P < 0.01) compared to SNAP-free, virusinfected cells ( Fig. 2A and B) . Similarly, a group 2a CoV, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was also susceptible to the antiviral effects of • NO, which reduced viral replication in OBL21a cells. However, • NO production was not a determinant in viral clearance from the lesions (Lane et al., 1997) . Also the group 2b CoV, SARS-CoV was inhibited in Vero E6 cells treated with 400 M SNAP (Akerstrom et al., 2005) ; however, as noted earlier, there is no information about • NO levels in SARS patients (Akerstrom et al., 2005) . On the other hand, • NO did not significantly inhibit PRRSV replication in MARC145 cells at PTH 24 and 48 compared to SNAP-free, virus-infected cells ( Fig. 2C and D) . Moreover, treatment with 400 M SNAP in MARC145 cells produced as much • NO (1.31 and 1.41 mM/ml in MARC145 cells at PTH 24 and 48, respectively) as in ST cells treated with 800 M SNAP ( Fig. 2A and C) . Therefore, our results imply that PRRSV is not susceptible to • NO under the conditions tested. Collectively, we suggest that unlike PRRSV, respiratory CoVs such as PRCV that infect pulmonary epithelial cells, cause cytolysis, and stimulate IFN-␣ secretion, induce • NO production in the lungs. Based on the in vivo and in vitro data, we conclude that • NO may play a role in innate immunity to respiratory CoV infections by inhibiting viral replication, but not in PRRSV infections, at least based on the conditions tested.
