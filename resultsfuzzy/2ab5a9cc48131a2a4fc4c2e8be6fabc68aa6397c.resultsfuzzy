A total of 17 children were included. Fifty two per cent of the enrolled patients were female. Demographics and illness history are summarized in table 1. Median age at admission was 56 days (range 24-630) and nine patients were under 2 months of age. Month distribution is displayed in figure 1. Median PRISM was 12 (IQR 4-27). Twelve patients (71%) were unimmunized .Five had received only one dose of pertussis vaccine and were partially immunized. The source of infection was identified in 9 (53%) cases. Mother-to-infant transmission occurred in six cases (66%).

Tachycardia more than 200 bpm was present in five cases (29%), shock in 4 cases (23.5%), seizures in 6 cases (35%), and altered mental states in 3 cases (17.6%). Among patients where an echocardiogram was done, 2 patients had pulmonary hypertension. Echocardiography was done on 4 patients. Median initial WBC was 41 × 109 L−1 (IQR 3.8-125.10 9 ). Initial WBC counts greater than 100 × 10 9 L−1was reported in all deaths. Chest radiograph on admission identified pneumonia in 14 patients (82%) and was normal in only 3 cases(17.6%). Based on blood gases, seven patients had PaO2/ FiO2 <200. Viral studies were available in 15 subjects (88%). Eight patients (53%) had viral coinfection with
