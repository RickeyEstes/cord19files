Many studies have demonstrated that certain polymorphisms in the spike gene can often be found in viruses isolated from chickens that are vaccinated with the ArkDPI vaccine (Ammayappan et al., 2009; McKinley et al., 2008; Ndegwa et al., 2012; Nix et al., 2000; Toro et al., 2012b; van Santen and Toro, 2008) . Two of the most common polymorphisms are in the S1 region of the spike gene, specifically at amino acid position 43 where a tyrosine to histidine is changed (Y43H) and at amino acid position 344 where an asparagine residue is deleted (Δ344). The goal of this study was to investigate the role of those two polymorphisms found in the spike gene of re-isolated ArkDPI vaccine in binding to host tissues and in reactions with serotypespecific antibodies. To this end, four recombinant ArkDPI S1 spike proteins were cloned, expressed, and purified. These are (1) primary ArkDPI vaccine spike (Y43/N344), (2) ArkDPI spike with the Y43H change, (3) ArkDPI spike with the Δ344 change, and (4) ArkDPI spike with both the Y43H and Δ344 changes. As a control, a Strep-tagged GFP protein was also produced to function as a control for transfection efficiency as well as a control for protein histochemistry.
