The bacteria concentrations for both S. epidermidis and S. marcescens were determined when the susceptibility constant was fed back into the source term of the bacteria equation (Eq. (9)), as shown in Fig. 7 . Compared to removal by disinfection, the effect of gravitational settling and wall deposition was only 0.02%, and thus these two effects could be ignored because the selected bacteria were only 1 Î¼m in size. The measured disinfection efficiency depends on the constant susceptibility Z and the number of negative ions. The disinfection efficiency against S. marcescens was higher than that of S. epidermidis. The bacteria concentration was nearly zero downstream very close to the ionizer for two reasons: first, the bacteria distribution at the back of the ionizer was relatively low due to the effect of fluid flow around the cylindrical tube; and second, the largest number of negative ions occurred here, resulting in a distribution of bacteria near zero because the disinfection efficacy was assumed to increase linearly with negative ion concentration (when the velocity is the same). The disinfection efficiency decreased at distances far away from the ionizer because the number of negative ions decreased. The predicted concentration of bacteria (facet average at the sampling cut-plane) was 32.8% and 12.7% for S. epidermidis and S. marcescens, respectively, as compared to the experimental results, as shown in Table 2 .
