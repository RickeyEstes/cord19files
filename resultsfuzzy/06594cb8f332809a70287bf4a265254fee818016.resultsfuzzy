The correlation plot of the maximum facial temperature monitored by the thermopile array and the axillary temperatures measured using the contact-type thermometer for the 155 seasonal influenza patients is shown in Figure 2 . The thermopile array measurements exhibited a positive correlation with the contact-type thermometer measurements (r = 0.71, p < 0.01). Comparison of the maximum facial temperature and reference axillary temperature showed an average mean difference of 1.03 8C with a standard deviation of 0.19 8C. As mentioned above, some of the influenza patients had mild or no fever after medication. Therefore, we evaluated the thermopile array for discriminating febrile patients from afebrile subjects by setting the threshold cut-off of maximum facial temperature in the thermopile array. This approach has been used and generally approved in some recent studies on the evaluation of thermography systems. 4, 5 By using the axillary temperature as the reference, the axillary temperatures of 36/155 febrile patients were >37.5 8C. The sensitivity and specificity were 80.5% and 93.3%, respectively, for setting the threshold cut-off of maximum facial temperature at 36.5 8C. The explanation for this is that although the thermopile array accurately measures human body temperature, some of the patients were misdiagnosed as normal because they were taking medication to reduce fever. The results indicated that the thermopile array accurately captured elevated human body temperature in close-range thermometry. The outbreak of an infectious disease, such as swine or avian influenza, is a threat to global health. Using thermal imaging techniques for fever screening has become a standard procedure at airport quarantine stations because they are more accurate than self-reports. Commercial thermal imaging systems typically cost several thousand dollars; 6 meanwhile, some researchers have developed inexpensive do-it-yourself infrared scanners to promote the widespread use of thermal imaging technology. 7 In this study, we proposed a cost-effective sensor with $2000 pixels to measure human body temperature. However, the main limitation of our thermopile array is that the operational distance between the thermopile array and the subject is 0.5 m, as opposed to approximately 1.0-3.0 m for some high-resolution commercial thermography systems. Therefore, this thermopile array will be more suitable for close-range fever screening of patients with infectious diseases at primary care doctor offices, health care centers, and quarantine stations in developing and developed countries.
