In this study, our method was evaluated by the 5-fold crossvalidation on the benchmark dataset that contains 3,137 compounds in Group-II of Table 1 . The 11-order prediction accuracies are shown in Figure 1 . The first order (most likely) prediction accuracy is 77.97%, and the last order (least likely) prediction accuracy is 0.38%, which indicates a quite good performance of our method. The average number of metabolic pathway classes with which each compound is involved is 1.15 (cf. Eq. 8), meaning that the average success rate by a random guess would be 1.15/ 11 = 10.45%, which is much lower than that by our method. Accordingly, the parameter k in Eq. 9 was set to (1.15+1) = 2; i.e., we may select the results of the first two orders of the predicted metabolic pathway classes for the query compounds. As we can see from Figure 1 , the accuracies of both the 1 st and 2 nd order predictions are higher than that of the random guess. According to Eq. 9 the metabolic pathway classes predicted by the 1 st and 2 nd orders have actually covered more than 80% of all the true metabolic pathway classes, suggesting that, of the results predicted by the 11 orders, more attention should be paid to those by the first two orders. Listed in Table 2 are the accuracies by each of the 11 prediction orders for the 3,137 compounds about their involvement in the 11 metabolic pathway classes using the 5-fold crossvalidation test. The highest accuracy achieved by the 1 st -order prediction was 80.96% for the 1 st metabolic pathway class (''Carbohydrate Metabolism''). And the results obtained by the 1 st and 2 nd prediction orders have covered 89.00% of the true metabolic pathway classes. The second highest accuracy by the 1 storder prediction was 78.77% for the 11 th metabolic pathway class (Xenobiotics Biodegradation and Metabolism), while the results obtained by the 1 st and 2 nd prediction orders have covered 87.00% of the true metabolic pathway classes. Both the two 1 st -order accuracies are higher than the overall 1 st -order prediction accuracy of 77.97%, and each of their combinations with the 2 nd -order predictions is also higher than the overall likelihood of 80.00%. As for the metabolic pathway classes with less compounds, such as ''Glycan Biosynthesis and Metabolism'' class that contains only 68 compounds in Group-I and 43 in Group-II (cf . Table 1) , the predicted accuracies were relatively not as good as the others. It is anticipated that with more experimental data are available in future for the compounds in these classes, the corresponding prediction success rates will be improved. Overall speaking, the aforementioned results are quite encouraging, indicating that our approach may become a useful tool to deal with this kind of very complicated systems. As stated in the Method section, the interactive compounds derived from STITCH tend to participate in the same metabolic pathways. For example, Table 3 lists the interactions of dihydrouracil with other compounds. Among the 32 interactive compounds, most of them appear in ''metabolism of cofactors and vitamins'' or ''metabolism of other amino acids'' or ''nucleotide metabolism'' pathway class (cf. Table 1 ) just like dihydrouracil. Dihydrouracil and uracil participate in pyrimidine metabolism pathway (belong to ''nucleotide metabolism''), where 5,6-dihydrouracil and NADP+ are catalyzed by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) to form uracil and NADPH+H+ [14, 27] . They are also co-mentioned in many PubMed Abstracts such as [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37] . Another two interactive compounds -dihydrouracil and dihydrothymine share a very similar structure, the only difference is that dihydrothymine has a methyl at the 5th position of the hexatomic ring while dihydrouracil has not [38] . According to the prediction criteria, when dihydrouracil was treated as a query compound, the first three order predicted metabolic pathways that it participates in are ''nucleotide metabolism'', ''metabolism of cofactors and vitamins'' and ''metabolism of other amino acids'', respectively, which are consistent with the true metabolic pathways that it is involved in. Predicted results for the compounds with unknown metabolic pathway Encouraged by the quite promising results obtained by the 5fold cross-validation test on the benchmark dataset of the 3,137 compounds, we applied the method to the 5,549 compounds whose metabolic pathways are unknown as mentioned in the Materials and Methods section. The predicted results thus obtained are given in Table S1 . As discussed above, we selected the metabolic pathway classes obtained by the 1 st and 2 nd order predictions for these compounds, in hoping that the information thus obtained may provide useful clues for further investigations. Actually, it is interesting to see that many of our predicted results have proved to be reasonable according to the reports from other investigators. For example, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate and its interactive compounds with pathway information are shown in Table 4 . N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate can bind to sulfate, glucuronic acid, galactose, xylose, fucose, Na(+), glycerol, and phosphate to form complex to perform the biological function [39] . In PubMed Abstracts, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate is comentioned with sulfate [40] , glucuronic acid [41] , galactose [42] , 39-phospho.pho. [43] , sugar-1-phosph. [44] , UDP-GlcNAc [45] , indole-3-glyce. [46] , N-acetyl-D-glucosamine [47] , and GDPmannose [44] . Besides, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate and Nacetyl-D-glucosamine share a similar structure and the difference is that N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate has a sulfate at the position 4 of the ring while N-acetyl-D-glucosamine has not [38] . From these evidences, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate is supposed to participate in the same metabolic pathways as its interactive compounds. It can be seen from Table 4 that most of the interactive compounds of N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate belong to the 1 st and 2 nd metabolic pathway classes. By considering all the interactions and the interaction confidence scores, it was predicted that Carbohydrate Metabolism (the 1 st class) and Energy Metabolism (the 2 nd class) would be the possible metabolic pathway classes that N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate belongs to. Actually, as a carbohydrate, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate reacts with Chondroitin 4-sulfate to form hydrogen oxide and G12336 (i.e. (GalNAc) 2 (GlcA) 1 (S) 2 ), one kind of glycan which can participate in Carbohydrate and Energy Metabolism. Therefore, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate may also participate in Carbohydrate and Energy Metabolism. Another example is that cyclopropylamine in Table 4 has 23 interactive compounds with known pathway information. Cyclopropylamine, cyanuric acid, ammonia, N-cyclopropylammelide, c0761, hydroxyl radicals are in the same pathway -N-cyclopropylmelamine degradation [48, 49] , where N-cyclopropylmelamine first reacts with hydrogen oxide to form N-cyclopropylammeline and ammonia, and then N-cyclopropylammeline also reacts with hydrogen oxide to form Ncyclopropylammelide and ammonia. After that, N-cyclopropylammelide reacts with hydrogen oxide to form cyanuric acid, cyclopropylamine and hydroxyl radicals. Finally, cyanuric acid is transformed into hydrogen oxide and ammonia through cyanurate degradation. Cyanuric acid, N-cyclopropylammelide, and c0761 are all in the 11 th pathway class. Therefore, cyclopropylamine may also belong to the 11 th pathway class (Xenobiotics Biodegradation and Metabolism). For other interactive compounds, they are comentioned with cyclopropylamine in PubMed Abstracts, such as polyethylene [50] , 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid [51] , cyclopropanecarboxylic acid [52] , 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid [53] , and acetophenone [54] . In Table 4 , most of the interactive compounds of cyclopropylamine belong to the 11 th metabolic pathway classes. According to above analysis, cyclopropylamine is suggested to participate in the Xenobiotics Biodegradation Metabolism, which was the 1 st -order predicted class for cyclopropylamine by our method. Accordingly, it is quite reasonable to expect that our method may provide useful information for further investigating into biological functions of compounds from the viewpoint of system biology.
