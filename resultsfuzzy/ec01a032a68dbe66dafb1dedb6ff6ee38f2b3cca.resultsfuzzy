Participating in this study were 68 children in the bronchiolitis group, aged from 4 to 30 months, with a median age of 7.15 ± 0.5 months, 49 of whom (72.06%) were male, and 85 children with recurrent wheezing, aged from 3 to 30 months, with a median age of 8.34 ± 0.54 months, 60 of whom (70.58%) were male ( Table 2) . Table 3 shows the detection rate for viruses and bacterial colonization in the two groups. Among the children with bronchiolitis, one virus was detected in 29 samples (42.65%) and two or more viruses in 27 samples (39.71%). RSV was the most frequenly detected virus. One species of bacterium was found in 29 samples (42.65%), and more than one species in nine samples (13.24%). H. influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most frequently detected bacteria. Among the children with recurrent wheezing, one virus was found in 32 samples (37.65%), and more than one was detected in 31 samples (36.47%). Human bocavirus was the most frequently detected virus. One bacterial species was found in 49 samples (57.65%), and more than one in 21 samples (24.71%). In this group, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and K. pneumoniae were most frequently detected. The frequency of bacterial colonization in children with recurrent wheezing was significantly higher than in children with bronchiolitis. However, the frequency of simultaneous bacterial colonization and virus infection in the two groups was not significantly different.
