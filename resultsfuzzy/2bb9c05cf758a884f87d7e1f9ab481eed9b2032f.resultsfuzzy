Although the combination of 19 nations and 17 time periods is typical for panel data, this analysis can theoretically be achieved using a fixed-effect or random-effect model. However, some variables, such as distance lnðDistanceÞ and language (Language), will not change for any nation over time. Thus, the fixed-effect model is not appropriate when these variables are included (Liu, Lai, & Chen, 2012; Prehn, Brümmer, & Glauben, 2016) . 2 As such, the random effect model is favoured under such circumstances. The estimated coefficients from the random effect model for Eq. (2) are listed in Table 3 . The results of the estimation show that except for the population in Taiwan (lnðT POPÞ), lnðT CPIÞ, and SARS, all other variables are significant at different significance levels. Moreover, the effects of these significant variables on the number of tourists from the 19 nations to Taiwan are consistent with our expectations. There are fewer tourists to Taiwan from the farthest nations. Nations with high GDPs have more outbound tourists visiting Taiwan, and tourists from countries where English is the official and/or national language visit Taiwan more often than those from other countries. The effect for the dummy variable of language (Language) and the outbreak of SARS (SARS) is the magnitude of the corresponding estimated coefficient. Because all other variables are taken as the natural logarithm, the effect of each variable on the 2 This situation occurs frequently in the gravity model. It normally involves variables that are constant throughout the years. Thus, the distance proxy variable between two nations, a typical variable used in the gravity model, has no variation throughout the years. Due to this drawback, the fixed-effect model is not appropriate for this application. number of tourists from the 19 nations means that a 1% change in a certain variable will result in a certain percentage change for the number of total tourists from the nations other than China (ln Tourist).
