To investigate whether the recombinant DNA vectors could elicit HTNV G2-specific humoral response, ELISA and cell microculture neutralization test in vitro were used to detect the humoral immune response in immunized BALB/c mice. Meanwhile, the stimulation index of splenocytes to G2 was measured by MTT assay. ELISA results showed that the average titer of the specific antibody against HTNV G2 in the mice immunized with G2-IL2 was 1:70. Whereas, the specific antibody of the average titer of pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2-G2 group against IL-2 was 1:100. The specific antibody of the average titer of pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2 group against HTNV G2 and IL-2 were negative and 1:70. The results of pcDNA3.1/ HTNV-G2 group against HTNV G2 and IL-2 were 1:55 and 1:40. The results of pcDNA3.1 and PBS groups against HTNV G2 and IL-2 were all negative (Fig. 3A) . Cell microculture neutralization test results showed that part of the immunized mice of pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2-G2 group could elicit neutralizing antibodies with different titers. But the neutralizing antibody titers were low (Table  1) . Lymphocyte proliferation assay results showed that the stimulation indexes of splenocytes of pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2-G2 group to IL-2 and G2 were all significantly higher than that of other groups (Fig. 3B ).
