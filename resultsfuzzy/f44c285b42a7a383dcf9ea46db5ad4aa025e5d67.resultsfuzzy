The Notice of the incentive plan was published on June 4th, 2014 and an explanation meeting was held jointly by FECO and UNIDO in Beijing, June 17th 2014. By the end of 2014, there were 15 incinerators of 13 enterprises passed the examinations and won the qualification to pursue for the incentive fund (see Fig. 2 ). Until the end of May 2015, there are 8 incinerators passed the verification of the incentive plan. In consideration of possible failure and quit of some incinerators, it is necessary to prepare for the successive activities. The following plans are suggested: 1. Make a complementary recruit. If the qualified incinerators exceed the gap, the incentive fund will be awarded with the method of first come first served. 2. Encourage replacement of incinerators with non-incineration technologies.
