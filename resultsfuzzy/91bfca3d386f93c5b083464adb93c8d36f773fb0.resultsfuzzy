We have intensively studied a 5-yr-old child who had recurrent viral respiratory infections requiring frequent hospitalizations ( Fig. 1 A; see Clinical description in Materials and methods). At birth, she had a suspected congenital infection, although prenatal infectious screening was normal. At 40 d of age, she had respiratory failure from concurrent HRV/ enterovirus and influenza B virus infections, which required mechanical ventilation, including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Since then, she has been repeatedly infected with HRV/enteroviruses detected in nasopharyngeal secre-tions and respiratory distress. She had two more episodes of influenza A (H3 subtype) and adenovirus, infections with three different coronaviruses (OC43, NL63, and HKU1), and one episode each of RSV and parainfluenza virus type 4. Tests for human metapneumovirus were negative. She continues to require supplemental oxygen and had ground glass opacities, but no bronchiectasis on chest-computed tomography. She has had bacterial superinfections of the respiratory tract, but no opportunistic or chronic systemic virus infection, including EBV or CMV. Although she initially had low serum immunoglobulin levels and lymphopenia (effecting T, NK, and B cell subsets) , these all normalized between 3 and 4 yr of age. Replacement immunoglobulin therapy, which started at 70 d of age when she was severely ill, was discontinued, and she has since responded with functional antibodies to tetanus, diphtheria, and Haemophilus influenzae vaccines. An older brother died of an unknown infectious cause at age one month in a refugee camp. The patient's parents and two other older siblings were healthy. Because HRV/enterovirus infection preceded the onset of chronic lung disease and HRV/enterovirus infections frequently precipitated hospitalization, we molecularly typed positive samples from the proband. RT-PCR and sequencing of the conserved 5â€² UTR used primers that preferentially amplify HRV species A, B, and C and distinguish between HRV and enterovirus (Bochkov et al., 2014) . Analysis of PCR-amplified products from seven nasopharyngeal samples collected sequentially from the patient over a 2-yr window demonstrated shedding of HRV-A, but not -B or -C (Fig. 1 , B and C). Each sample contained only one HRV-A serotype from 96 clones sequenced, and no two samples (excepting "b" and "c" which were collected within five d of each other) contained the same serotype. Phylogenetic analysis did not reveal any clustering of the identified serotypes ( Fig. 1 C) . Thus, the frequent detection of HRV/enterovirus was not caused by defective clearance of individual serotypes, but rather resulted from frequent infection with unrelated HRV serotypes.
