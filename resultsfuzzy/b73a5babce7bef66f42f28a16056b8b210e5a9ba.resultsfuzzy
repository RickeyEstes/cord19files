It has been argued in the literature that classical Diffusion of Innovations theory is limited in its application to organisational adoption of innovations. 12 It was generally accepted that classical theory was limited to explaining adoption of innovations by single individuals. After the first edition of 'Diffusion of Innovations' 13 was published, Everett Rogers began exploring innovation in organisations, resulting in the development of a clear description of how the classic theory is applied to organisations. 11, 15 Rogers suggests that the focus of research into innovation in organisations is on the innovation process itself. This is achieved by using a staged model. The process specific to organisations is a sequence of five stages, which are divided into two sub-processes: 1 initiation and 2 implementation. The initiation sub-process involves the information gathering, conceptualising and the planning of adoption of the innovation leading up to the point where the decision is made to adopt the innovation. The implementation subprocess comprises all the events, actions and decisions which are involved to put the innovation to use. The decision to adopt, the dotted line, is the event that divides initiation from implementation. 11 Other researchers have added to this model, examining sequences in the innovation process, divergent and parallel paths, and feedback and feed-forward cycles. 19, 26 The IPCP adoption in Kiribati appears to have included sequences in response to stimulus from external and internal sources, yet followed Rogers' clearly staged process, as shall be explored further below. 11
