Environment Parameters in Air Handling Units. Temperature, humidity and CO 2 concentration of Unit A and B are shown in Table 1 . Unit A is located in the ground floor (B1), and the unit B is located on the ground floor. Compared to the unit B, the humidity of unit A is higher, and the temperature is lower. Microbial Colony Analysis. The distribution density of bacteria and fungi in the unit A is obtained through statistics, as shown in Fig. 2 . The concentration of airborne fungus was 44 cfu/m 3 , and the concentration of airborne bacteria was 16 cfu/m 3 . The unit A showed the obvious microbial contamination status, though all components and airborne microorganism meet the Hygienic specification of central air conditioning ventilation system in public buildings of China 22 . The microbial distribution in filter net is central < edge < bottom and bacteria accounted for a larger proportion; the microbial distribution in surface cooler is center > against the wall > edge, and fungi accounted for a large. The fungal contamination in the air is more serious than the bacteria. The distribution density of bacteria and fungi in the unit B were obtained through statistics, as shown in Fig. 3 . The concentration of airborne fungus was 22 cfu/m 3 , and the concentration of airborne bacteria was 80 cfu/m 3 . Parts of the measuring point in the unit B were polluted seriously. The bacterial colonies in the corner and the ground of the surface cooler were beyond the hygienic index (≤ 100 cfu/cm 2 ) in the Hygienic specification of central air conditioning ventilation system in public buildings of China regulates 22 . Limited by unit placement, there were less measuring points in unit B, and we chose the same measuring points in both units for comparison (centre of surface cooler, surface cooler against wall, corner of surface, and ground of surface cooler). The comparison between unit A and B indicates that the bacterial density in unit A was less than that in the same sampling point in unit B, but the fungal density in Unit A was more than that in the same sampling point in unit B. If the cleaning and disinfection is not enough before the air conditioning system running, it may make the fungus to enter the indoor environment, which results in make the pollution of indoor air. Compared with cooling coil, the fungus contamination is worse in the floor dust and the air suspension. During the actual measurement, it is found that the unit internal is unprecedentedly narrow and low intensity of illumination in a closed state. According to the description by technicians, it is easy to trample damage to the underground pipes, which leads to the disinfection and cleaning work rarely in the unit. Fungal genome sequencing analysis. In this study, we analysed the samples from the sampling points A1, B1, and B2 by amplicon sequencing information analysis, respectively named A1A, B1A, and B2A. All collected samples in the air conditioner were transferred to the Eppendorf tubes and processed with the extraction step. Samples were resusponded in TENS buffer with SDS and proteinase K as described by Vinod 29 . After incubation at 55 °C, phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol was added to remove proteins, and the nucleic acid was precipitated with isopropanol and sodium acetate (0.3 M). Total DNA was dissolved in 1 × TE after washing with 75% ethanol. And then the quality and quantity tests were conducted by agarose gel electrophoresis, . For PCR product, the jagged ends of DNA fragment would be converted into blunt ends by using T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow Fragment and T4 Polynucleotide Kinase. Then add an ' A' base to each 3' end to make it easier to add adapters. After all that, fragments too short would be removed by Ampure beads. For genomics DNA, we use fusion primer with dual index and adapters for PCR, fragments too short would be removed by Ampure beads too. In both cases, only the qualified library can be used for sequencing. The quality and quantity of libraries were assessed using the 2130 Bioanaylzer (Agilent Technologies) and the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The raw data generated by MiSeq and HiSeq 2000 sequencers was processed to eliminate the adapter pollution and low quality to obtain clean reads. The qualified clean data was used for the further bioinformatics analysis. Firstly, paired-end reads with overlap were merged to tags by software FLASH (v1.2.11) 30 , and then tags were clustered to OTU at 97% sequence similarity using USEARCH (v7.0.1090) 31 . Secondly, Taxonomic ranks were assigned to OTU representative sequence using Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Na, e Bayesian Classifier v.2.2 32 . At last, alpha diversity, beta diversity and the different species screening were analyzed based on OTU and taxonomic ranks by MOTHUR (v1.31.2) 33 .
