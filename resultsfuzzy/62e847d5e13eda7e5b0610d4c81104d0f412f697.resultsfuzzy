Problems or inconsistencies in experimental data, as detected by scientists, may also indicate the presence of a subclinical infection (McKisic et al. 1993; Small 1986) . When scientists encounter variations that could be attributed to the presence of an excluded infectious agent, sampling should ideally include mice from the investigator's colony. Supplemental testing of the room sentinels may also be useful. 3) FOLLOW-UP TESTING AFTER AN OUTBREAK IS DETECTED Testing of colony animals is often used to determine the prevalence of an agent within the room population when sentinels have tested positive. The most common approach is to bleed and test one mouse per cage because all mice in the cage can be assumed to have been exposed if a sample mouse is seropositive. Because colony animals are valuable and often irreplaceable, the minimum amount of blood should be drawn utilizing a minimally invasive method. This type of testing is often needed to plan the disposition of an affected colony or to select infected animals for a test-and-cull eradication plan. In the case of a single positive test or an equivocal positive result, confirmatory results should be obtained before any drastic action is taken. Confirmation should include testing of the same sera (or that of a cagemate) by another method within the same laboratory (e.g., confirming ELISA results by running an IFA test), or by arranging for testing at a different laboratory (Rehg and Toth 1998) . There are some indicators that can be used to make a presumptive positive diagnosis without waiting for additional test results, such as finding more than one sentinel cage from the suspect area that is positive or obtaining a positive test in a screening assay known to be very specific (e.g., historically low false-positive rate). Caution should be taken in relying on a single positive ELISA test, especially if other mice in the same cage were not seropositive. Interpretation of nonserologic tests is more straightforward, because they assay directly for the presence of observable organisms or genetic material. However, bacterial isolates can be mischaracterized, artifacts in the sample can be misidentifled as parasite components, and PCR samples may become contaminated or results may not be repeatable. Therefore, it is still important to verify the accuracy of test results prior to making decisions that will have a major impact on the colony and the research programs involved.
