Now consider the following example: Thus conditions (H 1 ) and (H 2 ) hold. From Proposition 4.1, system (29) has a stable positive periodic solution (see Fig. 2(a) ). It is seen from Fig. 2 (b) that the solution with the initial point (4, 0.96) of system (29) tends to this positive periodic solution with t increasing. Now set c = 0.5, T = 0.5. From (19) and (27), that is, period-adding bifurcation, occurs. A period-2 solution bifurcates from the epidemic periodic solution. It is seen from Fig. 3(a) that the numerical results are in good agreement with the theoretical results and system (29) possesses rich dynamics including different kinds of bifurcation and periodic windows. Fig. 3(b) shows the period-3 window. The period-3 solution is stable for b âˆˆ (3.448, 3.462) and another flip bifurcation occurs at b = 3.462. It is seen from the bifurcation diagram Fig. 3 that there exist periodic solutions. Fig. 4 shows the 1T -periodic, 2T -periodic, and 3T -periodic solutions in system (29) with b = 2.45, b = 2.492, and b = 3.46, respectively. Both theoretical and experimental investigation have revealed that the three main routes to chaos are the route via torus bifurcation, the perioddoubling route, and intermittency. From Fig. 3(a) , we know that the route to chaos is period-doubling bifurcation in our case. Fig. 4(d) shows that chaos does exist in system (29) for b = 3.2.
