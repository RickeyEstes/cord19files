First, the PC inactivation of RDRADS in the absence and presence of halides was carried out. The number of survived RDRADS was quantified from the fluorescence images ( Fig. 1 ), using the method described in Ref. [28] . Fig. 2 shows the inactivation efficiency of PC treatment in the presence and absence of halide for samples containing an initial RDRADS about 1000 Tissue Culture Infective Dose 50 (TCID50). An initial rapid inactivation was observed for the PC treatment in the absence of halide. It took only 6.0 and 31.7 s to achieve 21.71 ± 1.1% and 33.82 ± 1.7% inactivation, respectively. However, dramatically reduced inactivation efficiencies were observed when the treatment time exceeded 30 s. It took another 111 s to achieve an additional 5.36% inactivation (i.e., 39.28 ± 2.0% at 143.2 s), suggesting PC treatment in the absence of halide cannot completely inactivate RDRADS within the treatment time investigated. Higher inactivation efficiencies may be achievable if a longer treatment time is employed. As demonstrated in our previous study, adding halide ions such as Br À can dramatically enhance the photocatalytic inactivation efficiency for bacteria [26] . As such, similar approaches were adopted in this work to inactivate RDRADS. Fig. 2 also shows the inactivation performance of PC treatment in presence of 1.0 mM Cl À (PC-Cl). These results show that the inactivation percentages rapidly increased during the first 10 s of PC-Cl treatment. A 44.97 ± 1.7% inactivation was achieved within 6.0 s, compared to a 21.71 ± 1.1% inactivation achieved by PC treatment over the same period without Cl À . Such an inactivation percentage achieved by PC-Cl treatment was even higher than that of a 143.2 s PC treatment in the absence of Cl À (39.28 ± 2.0%). When further increasing the treatment time, PC-Cl inactivation percentages steadily increased to 75.39 ± 3.8% at 31.7 s, and 95.43 ± 4.8% at 97.5 s. The inactivation performance of PC treatment in presence of 1.0 mM Br À (PC-Br) for RDRADS is also shown in Fig. 2 . The inactivation percent increased with the treatment time, achieving 26.56 ± 1.3%, 32.73 ± 1.6%, and 46.59 ± 2.3% inactivation at 6.0, 14.3, and 31.7 s, respectively. When compared to PC-Cl treatment, PC-Br revealed a relatively slow inactivation during the initial 30 s treatment period. These achieved inactivation percentages are just slightly higher than those of PC treatment in absence of halide (i.e., 21.71 ± 1.1%, 24.48 ± 1.2%, and 33.82 ± 1.7% at 6.0, 14. In addition, we compared the effect of the type of halides on the inactivation performances under PC treatment. The inactivation ratios obtained from PC-Br and PC-Cl treatments were found to be between 0.60 and 0.68 within 30 s, respectively, suggesting that the presence of Cl À (PC-Cl) is more effective than that of Br À (PC-Br) with PC treatments during the initial 30 s. The high efficiency of PEC has been widely acknowledged [24, 30] . The applied potential bias to timely remove the photogenerated electrons and physically separate the photoanode from the cathode are generally regarded as the main factors leading to the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency [31, 32] . It has also been recognized that the applied potential bias prolongs the lifetime of photoholes, enabling direct photohole reactions [30] . Despite numerous studies on PEC degradation of organics have been previously reported [24, 30, 32] , based on the literature, it appears that the PEC inactivation of viruses has been rarely attempted [25] . Therefore, PEC inactivation of RDRADS was also investigated in the absence and presence of halides. Fig. 3 shows the representative micrograph of PK15 cells infected with GFP expressed virus under different photoelectrocatalytic inactivation treatment times at a nanoparticulate TiO 2 photoanode in a continuous flow-though cell in the absence of halide ions. Fig. 4 shows the PEC inactivation performance for RDRADS in the presence and absence of halides. Without adding halides, a 43.50 ± 2.2% inactivation percentage can be achieved at 9.8 s, indicating a drastically enhanced performance within shorter treatment period (e.g., <10 s) when compared to PC treatment in the absence of halide. However, the inactivation dramatically slowed down and then leveled off at ca. 45% when the treatment time was further increased beyond 15 s. Fig. 4 also shows PEC inactivation performance for RDRADS in the presence of 1.0 mM Cl À (PEC-Cl) . It was found that a 49.83 ± 2.5% inactivation can be achieved within 6.0 s of PEC-Cl treatment. The inactivation percentage increased almost linearly from 49.83 ± 2.5% to 88.10 ± 4.4% within the treatment period between 6.0 and 31.7 s. Fig. 4 also shows the inactivation performance of PEC in the presence of 1.0 mM Br À (PEC-Br). The inactivation percentages increased almost linearly with the treatment time up to 14.3 s, achieving a 99.77 ± 5.0% inactivation. A 100% inactivation was achieved at 31.7 s. Such an inactivation performance is the highest among all methods investigated in this work, demonstrating the superiority of PEC-Br treatment. The results also show that the inactivation percentages of PEC-Br treatment within a short treatment period (i.e., 0 $ 6.0 s) was lower than that of PEC-Cl treatment, but surpassed the PEC-Cl treatment when the treatment time was greater than 9.8 s. In addition, we also compared the effect of halide type on inactivation performances under PEC treatment. The inactivation ratios obtained in the presence of Br À (PEC-Br) and Cl À (PEC-Cl) were found to be below 1 (0.92) during the initial 6.0 s, suggesting a better initial inactivation ability of the PEC-Cl treatment. The PEC-Br's performance surpassed the PEC-Cl treatment with extended treatment time as demonstrated by the ratios of 1.58 and 1.14 obtained after 14.3 and 31.7 s treatments, respectively. 5 summarizes the relative inactivation performances of different treatments investigated in this study. Considering that all experiments were performed using the same photoelectrochemical cell, under the same light intensity and using the same initial virus concentration, the comparison data shown in Fig. 5 are of quantitative and truly reflect the virus inactivation abilities of different treatments. The ratios of PEC to PC treatments in the presence and absence of halides were greater than 1 for all cases investigated, confirming that PEC treatments are more effective than that of PC treatments under comparable conditions. It can be seen that comparing to PC, PC-Cl, and PC-Br treatments, the corresponding PEC treatments are 1.23-1.84, 1.11-1.27 and 1.73-3.04 times more effective, respectively. These experimental results confirm that the photocatalytic inactivation efficiency can be enhanced in presence of low concentration halides (X À ) and further enhanced by applying potential bias onto the anode in PEC system. It is commonly agreed that for a TiO 2 photocatalysis-based method, the photocatalytically generated active oxygen species (AOSs) are responsible for inactivation [33, 34] . The enhanced inactivation performance for PC-X treatments is due to the production of additional viricides, resulting from the photocatalytic oxidation of X À (see Eq. (1)) [35, 36] . The further enhanced inactivation performance for PEC-X treatments can be attributed to the increased productions of AOSs and X-based viricides, and prolonged lifetime of photoholes (h + ) for direct inactivation [30] . Fig. 6 shows the photocurrent responses obtained from 0.1 M NaNO 3 solution and 0.1 M NaNO 3 solution containing Br À or Cl À at a given concentration. In the absence of X À , the photocurrent is originated from the photocatalytic oxidation of water, which is directly proportional to the production rate of AOSs [24, 32] . An increase in halide ions concentration leads to an increase in the photocurrent. The net photocurrent increase results from the photocatalytic oxidation of halides, which should be directly proportional to the production rate of X-based viricides (e.g., X Å /X 2 ÅÀ , X 2 , HOX/XO À ) [26] . The photocatalytic inactivation process at TiO 2 is an essential oxidation process. The roles of AOSs and h + have been widely reported [33, 34] . However, which of the X-based viricides (e.g., X Å /X 2 ÅÀ , X 2 , HOX/XO À ) generated from photocatalytic oxidation of X À need to be further discussed. Considering the relatively low standard potentials of Cl 2 /Cl À and Br 2 /Br À (+1.36 and +1.087 V, respectively), it is unlikely that these halogen species are the main contributors to the enhancement inactivation efficiency. Moreover, the standard potentials of HOCl/Cl À and HOBr/Br À are +1.63 and +1.33 V, respectively. Although the oxidation power of these species are not high, they should be sufficient to cause damage to the capsid of nonenveloped viruses (such as adenovirus), whose capsid is composed of protein polypeptides. Also, HOX prefers to react with amino acids with an amino group side chains [38] , and is particular effective to inactivate proteins containing sulfhydryl groups [38] . Therefore, HOX could play an important role in the damage of the protein capsid of RDRADS. The photocatalytically generated X Å should be considered a dominant contributor to the enhanced virucidal efficiency due to its reactive nature, strong oxidation power (E 0 [Cl Å /Cl À ] = +2.41 V [39] and E 0 [Br Å /Br À ] = +1.96 V [40] ), and its ability to form stable di-halide radical anions (X 2 ÅÀ ) [41] . The formation of X 2 ÅÀ prolongs the lifetime of X Å to maximize the inactivation effect. These oxidative radicals could rapidly damage the protein capsid and invade viruses to further damage the intracellular macromolecules (such as nucleic acids). It should be noted that X À serves as an electron mediator during the photocatalytic inactivation process [26] . It is photocatalytically oxidized at the illuminated TiO 2 surface to form the reactive species and regenerated when reacting with virus (see Eq. (2)). This is the prime reason that only a very low concentration of X À is required to achieve the purpose. However, it worth mentioning that compared to the PEC-Cl treatment, higher inactivation efficiency of the PEC-Br treatment could be attributed to the higher concentration of Br 2 ÅÀ in the PEC-Br system. This is because the reaction equilibrium constant for the formation of Br 2 ÅÀ (K = 3.9 Â 10 5 M À1 ) is higher than that of Cl 2 ÅÀ (K = 1.4 Â 10 5 M À1 ) in the PEC-Cl system [42] . In comparison to our previous work [26] , the RDRADS is more difficult to be photocatalytically inactivated than bacteria. A possible reason could be that RDRADS is a double-stranded DNA virus, so the damaged DNA could be rapidly repaired by a host cell enzymes [43] . Also, unlike the complex cell wall and inner membrane structures of bacteria, viruses lack enzymes and other sensitive systems, enabling the virus to prolong its survival outside the body environment [44] .
