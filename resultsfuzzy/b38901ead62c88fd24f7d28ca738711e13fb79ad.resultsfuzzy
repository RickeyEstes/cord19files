Of the 12 studies that collected original EVD data, 9 released those data before or at the time of publication (8 with Ebola virus genetic data deposited in GenBank (Baize et al., 2014; Gire et al., 2014; Simon-Loriere et al., 2015; Tong et al., 2015; Hoenen et al., 2015; Park et al., 2015; Carroll et al., 2015; Kugelman et al., 2015) and 1 with detailed epidemiological data in the online publication (Yamin et al., 2014) . Many publications used results from the WHO Ebola Response Team investigations (WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014; 2015) (for example, estimates of the generation time, case fatality rate, or other epidemiological parameters as model inputs), but the detailed epidemiological data from these studies, to date, are not publicly available. Accumulation of shared EVD data over successive studies was evident especially in the phylogenetic analyses. For example, all phylogenetic studies published after release of the initial Ebola virus sequences by (Baize et al., 2014) (Guinea) and (Gire et al., 2014)  Across all studies, the publication lag (defined as date of most recent EVD data used to date of online publication) was almost 3 months (median [interquartile range] = 85 [30-157] days). The lag varied across modeling applications, and was considerably shorter in studies that included models to estimate R (median = 58 days for publications with R estimation versus 118 days for others) or to forecast (median = 50 versus 125 days) (Figure 3 ). Lags were longest for studies with phylogenetic and clinical trials applications (median = 125 and 108 days, respectively), although there were fewer publications with these models.  Forty-one publications characterized epidemic dynamics using epidemiological (N=36), genomic (N=4), or news report data (N=1). Twenty-four of these provided estimates of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) for Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, or West Africa, using epidemiological or genomic data ( Figure 4, Supplementary file 3) . There were 16 country-specific estimates of R 0 for Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone that used EVD epidemiological data (aggregate or line-level) and provided 95% confidence or credible intervals (CIs). Median CI width was about 85% smaller for models that used cumulative EVD counts (N=11 models in 5 publications) than for models that used disaggregated EVD case data, such as weekly counts (N=5 models in 3 publications) ( Figure 5) . Although CIs were also narrower for models when deterministic rather than stochastic methods were used to estimate parameter uncertainty, all of the deterministic results came from a single study ( Figure 6 ). Fifteen publications provided numerical forecasts of cumulative EVD incidence for West African countries. Of 22 models that assumed no additional response measures beyond those implemented at the time (i.e., 'status quo' assumptions), 18 overestimated the future number of cases (Figure 7,  Supplementary file 4) . In multivariate analysis, forecast error was lower for forecasts made later in the outbreak (14% reduction in mean absolute percentage error [MAPE] per week, P<0.001), higher for forecasts with longer time horizons (29% increase in MAPE per week, P<0.01), and lower for forecasts that used decay terms, spatially heterogeneous contact patterns, or other methods that served to constrain projected incidence growth (90% reduction in MAPE, P<0.01). Country and number of parameters in the model were not statistically significant predictors of forecast accuracy.
