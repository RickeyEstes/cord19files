The substrate or biomolecules used for synthesis of nanoparticles play very important role in the surface reactions, size and morphology of nanoparticles. As is well known, biomolecules can carry on slow kinetics to self-reduce metal precursors and develop stable coating layers to avoid particle aggregation (Renquan, Dapeng, Daxiang, Zhongyang, & Lin, 2012) .
