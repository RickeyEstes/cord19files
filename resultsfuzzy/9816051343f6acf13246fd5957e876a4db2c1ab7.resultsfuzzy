Around 10% (6918) of direct grants resulted in collaborations with other institutions, which did not always translate into a transfer of funds from the primary recipient to the collaborating institutions; 96.4% (6669) of these direct grants had been awarded to recipients in high-income countries ( Table 5 ) and 75.8% (14,619) of the collaborations resulting from these grants were with others in high-income countries. In fact, for each income group, collaborations were most likely to be with others in the same income group, followed by institutions in high-income countries. For example, grant recipients in low-income countries (66) collaborated most with institutions in low-income countries (88), followed by institutions in high-income (78), lower-middle-income (11) and upper-middle-income (8) countries (Table 5) . Table 6 describes the sample size for the sensitivity analysis and the percentage of each funder's contribution to the total number of direct grants (69,420) in 2016. The sample consisted of 107 records, after rounding up of percentage figures. Table 7 shows that, out of a random sample of 107 grants, 81% were assigned to a health category and, in 91% of the cases, the classification was accurate.
