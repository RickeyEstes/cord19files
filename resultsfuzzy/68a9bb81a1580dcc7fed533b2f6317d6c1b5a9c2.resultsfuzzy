The inlet mean wind speed profile is set to where a is the surface roughness factor (a ¼ 0.2), U met . is the wind speed at the top of the domain (U met ¼ 6.751 m/s), d met is the domain thickness (d met ¼ 60 m) and h is the height. To compare with data from the wind tunnel experiment, the inlet wind profile in CFD simulation is set similarly as possible to the one from the wind tunnel experiment, as shown in Fig. 6 . The outlet wind profile is set same as the inlet wind profile. The contour of wind speed at 2.25 m above the ground is presented in Fig. 6. Fig. 7 shows the position of the test points and the cross-comparing result. The linear regression analysis result (R 2 ¼ 0.853) suggests that the keu SST model can predict accurately the pedestrian-level air flow caused by shape-edged buildings. To further validate the simulation results, the vertical profiles of the mean wind velocities from CFD simulation and wind tunnel experiment at position 1 and position 2 (Fig. 7) are also presented in Fig. 8 . The results are consistent with the experiment results conducted by Menter and Kuntz [34] and well compliment and validate the accuracy of the simulation. However, it should be noted that, when the wind velocity is very low, the deviations between wind tunnel data and the simulation results are larger than the standard deviation.
