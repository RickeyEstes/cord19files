Quantification of nucleolar fluorescence is complicated by the dynamic nature of nucleoli Measurements of organellar or compartment-specific concentrations of molecules frequently depend on a marker that identifies the subcellular structure of interest. It further requires that the marker detects a specific organelle or compartment under a variety of experimental conditions. However, in the case of nucleoli this approach is challenging, since several of the nucleolar "marker" proteins relocate in response to environmental or disease-induced changes. This is demonstrated in Figure 1 for two prominent nucleolar proteins, B23 (also known as nucleophosmin, NPM) and fibrillarin. Both proteins redistribute in response to stress, and their concentration in nucleoli can vary between different cells. Thus, B23 and fibrillarin cannot always serve as a reliable marker to define the nucleolar compartment. To overcome this obstacle, we present several distinct methods that measure pixel intensities in nucleoli (summarized in Figure 2 ). These procedures depend on recent advancements in computer-based image analysis and do not require a specific nucleolar marker protein. The different protocols developed by us accommodate a wide variety of experimental settings. They have been applied successfully to measure nucleolar pixel intensities for GFP-tagged reporter proteins, immunostained endogenous proteins and de novo synthesized RNA. These protocols measure the nucleolar fluorescence in multiple steps that involve three main operations ( The dynamic organization of nucleoli requires new tools for quantification of nucleolar fluorescence. The nucleolar accumulation of B23 and fibrillarin, frequently used as marker proteins for the nucleolus, is sensitive to changes in growth conditions. HeLa cells were grown under normal conditions or exposed to a 1-hour heat shock at 45.5°C. Cells were fixed and processed for indirect immunofluorescence. Size bar is 20 μm. Note that a portion of either protein relocates from the nucleolus upon heat stress. functions of the analysis software can be employed. The choice of the appropriate function is dependent on the image to be analyzed (see Methods). To accommodate a wide diversity of experimental settings, we designed alternative methods for the analyses of images. These methods differ in the functions that are selected for each step of the quantification process. For instance, several strategies are used to identify nucleoli, and distinct functions are employed to reduce noise and false positives ( Figure 2 ). It should be noted that some of these functions are applied to the image of the nuclear marker, while others are applied to the image of the molecule to be quantified, here referred to as probe image. The key step in the quantification process is the identification of nucleoli. Two groups of procedures demarcate the nucleolar compartment ( Figure 2 ). The first group (Methods 1-3) is based on a method that stains the nucleoplasm, but excludes nucleoli. The second group (Methods 4, 5) relies on the distribution of the molecule of interest which is detected with a specific probe. Methods in the second group are applicable if there is a difference in the concentration of the molecule of interest between the nucleolus and the surrounding nucleoplasm. In the following, we describe in detail each method as well as alternative protocols to analyze the distribution of nucleolar components. The basic software operations required are described in the Methods section. In light of the different strategies that can quantify pixel intensities in nucleoli, it was important to compare these methods. In Figure 9 , the same image was used to identify nucleoli based on the DAPI staining. However, different filters were employed to demarcate the nucleolar region. The raw data are depicted for five nucleoli which are numbered in the images. Measurements of pixel intensity/area (Figure 9c ) reveal that similar values are obtained with both protocols for each nucleolus, indicating that these processing operations generate comparable data.
