Our modeling approach builds on previous work (Gudelj et al., 2004; Nowak and May, 1994; Regoes et al., 2000) with several novel extensions: (1) we incorporate superinfection in a heterogeneous host environment, rather than a single host population; (2) we assume a parasite strain superinfects distinct host species differentially, rather than equally-since primary infections are interactions between a parasite and host that can either mitigate or facilitate superinfection (Sadd and Schmid-Hempel, 2009; Telfer et al., 2010; Ulrich and Schmid-Hempel, 2012) ; and (3) strains do not have a transmission advantage in either host species. At low levels of virulence, the superinfection advantage of A outweighs its virulence cost, leading to the complete dominance of A in both host species ( Fig. 2A-Type I) . At moderate virulence, we observe strong host association of the two strains, yielding I 1A and I 2B subpopulations. This phenomenon is indicated by the 'windows' outlined in dashed boxes in Fig. 2 -Type III, which is defined by an 80/20 rule where at least 80% of all hosts infected by a strain belong to one species. Note that a low relative prevalence of A in host species 2 represents a high prevalence of B in host species 2. At higher virulence, the cost of A outweighs its superinfection advantage, which leads to the dominance of B in both host species ( Fig. 2A-Type V) . Lastly, at intermediate ranges of virulence we find an overlap in the host ranges of either strain ( Fig. 2A -Types II and IV), which results from less dramatic changes in the cost-benefit balance of virulence and superinfection. Details on equilibria can be found in supplemental Figs. S1-S4. In contrast, if a mutant strain were to arise that had only one of the characteristics assumed here (superinfection or virulence) then it would either drive the resident strain extinct (superinfection alone) or go extinct itself (virulence alone) as demonstrated in supplemental Fig. S5 . The variable patterns of parasite coexistence (Fig. 2 , regimes I-V) requires both superinfection and virulence in the mutant strain A. The four panels of Fig. 2 represent strict and relaxed parameterizations of the model. Fig. 2A represents the strict case where the difference between the mutant strain A in host species 1 and 2 is most extreme (no superinfection in S 2 ; ε = 0), and no virulence cost for I B (f = 0). We relax the assumptions of superinfection and virulence by allowing A to additionally superinfect B individuals in I 2B at a reduced rate (Fig. 2-panels B, D) , and by setting a virulence cost for B in both host species (see Fig. 2-panels C, D) . The corresponding windows are altered as follows: (1) allowing superinfection in both hosts reduces the parameter space for host association; and (2) including a virulence cost for both parasites increases this parameter space. Superinfection can explain host-parasite association in a unique manner: intrinsic generalists become host-associated due to outcomes of within-host competition. Conventional thinking dictates that adaptation creates a specialist parasite, and subsequent adaptation enables that parasite to cross the species' barrier. Superinfection relaxes these conditions of adaptation, and can promote cross-species transmission while maintaining hostparasite associations (Fig. 3 and Table 2 ). Fig. 3 illustrates a comparison of superinfection versus host specialization and how each scenario influences cross-species transmission; indicated by relative prevalence approaching 0.5 in both host species. Both mechanisms can produce similar, mean levels of host association. However, in the superinfection model, stochastic transmission can allow relative prevalences to transiently deviate from our 80/20 definition of host-parasite association, typifying outbreak dynamics without recurrent adaptive mutations. This is not the case un- (Fig. 1) . The two panels show 25 stochastic projections of the relative prevalence of parasite A[IA/(IA + IB)] in host 1 (dark gray) and host 2 (light gray) on the y-axis against time on the x-axis. The superinfection model is parameterized as shown in Fig. 2D ; transmission is unbiased at β = 0.0005 and virulence is v = 0.0025. White and black lines represent mean prevalences calculated from the stochastic projections. The host specialization model has no superinfection (q = 0), no virulence (v = 0), and a transmission bias (βH = 0.0008 or βL = 0.0002) for the associated hosts (I 1A and I 2B ). Trajectories that approach the interior of a plot indicate an increase of a parasite (A or B) in a host population from previously low levels; note that a decrease in the relative prevalence of A indicates an increase in the relative prevalence of B. Simulation time represents 40 years.
