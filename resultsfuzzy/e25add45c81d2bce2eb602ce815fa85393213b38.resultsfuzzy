A from a heavy atom of inhibitors, as described by Chou et al. 8 The results show that the binding pockets of six compounds can be divided into three classes: (1) residues 40-86 and 181-192 for four drugs/inhibitors (lopinavir, niclosamide, promazine and PNU); (2) residues 41-51 and 164-194 for UC2 inhibitor; (3) residues 19-57 and 117-193 for drug ritonavir. All these pockets locate in domain I (residues 8-101), domain II (residues 102-184) and a long loop region (residues 185-200) connecting domains I and II in SARS-CoV main proteinase. Thus, the four drugs and two inhibitors studied here can basically bind to the active site of SARS-CoV main proteinase, a cleft between domains I and II. To estimate the binding affinities of each compound, the inhibitory constant (K i , mole) was calculated from the equation: where DG is the free energy of binding (kJ/mol) (here refers to the final docked energy), R is the gas constant 8.31 J/K/mol and T is the absolute temperature (at 300 K), as did in Jenwitheesuk and Samudrala. 9 The results indicate that the inhibitory constants of six compounds are: 8.7 · 10 À20 (lopinavir), 5.6 · 10 À25 (ritonavir), 4.2 · 10 À22 (niclosamide), 6.2 · 10 À21 (promazine), 3.5 · 10 À23 (PNU), 2.1 · 10 À19 (UC2). It is noted that these values are too low, for example, the inhibitory constant of lopinavir was determined as $10 À7 by Jenwitheesuk and Samudrala. 10 The reason for this difference is that the docked energy value from Hex program is a pseudo-energy, which is designed to give reasonably consistent units with conventional energy calculations, not based on experimentally derived parameters, and as a theoretical reference value only when performing the docking algorithm. Thus we do not expect these values are the genuine representations of inhibitory constants and we use them primarily for qualitative comparison among the drugs/inhibitors studied here. Because the lower the K i is, the greater the binding affinity is, hence HIV drug ritonavir is the compound that bind to the substrate binding site of SARS-CoV proteinase with the highest binding affinity, followed by HIV inhibitor PNU and anti-parasite drug niclosamide, and UC2 is the compound with the lowest binding affinity. Moreover, the inhibitory constants of ritonavir, PNU, niclosamide, promazine and UC2 are about 10 À5 , 10 À3 , 10 À2 , 10 À1 and 10-fold inhibitory constant of lopinavir, respectively, if we assume that a value of 10 À7 mol for lopinavir's inhibitory constant is correct, the inhibitory constants of ritonavir, PNU, niclosamide, promazine and UC2 could be estimated as 10 À12 , 10 À10 , 10 À9 , 10 À8 and 10 À6 mol, respectively. The close views of the interactions between SARS-CoV main proteinase and these drugs/inhibitors are exhibited in Figure 4 . The results show that half of lopinavir is left outside the catalytic site (Fig. 4a) , for ritonavir, the thiazole group (P1) and a benzene group (P2) are inserted into S1 and S2 specificity pockets, respectively, while another benzene side chain (P3) might be too long to fit the substrate binding pocket perfectly (Fig. 4b) , there is similar situation in the inhibitor AG7088, 11 which has been experimentally shown to not bind with high affinity to the SARS-CoV proteinase (http://www.nature.com/ nsu/030512/030512-11.html). Thus the efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir could be poor. Indeed, consistent with our predictions, experimental observation data indicated that both lopinavir and ritonavir individually have only a weak in vitro activity against SARS-CoV. However, the addition of lopinavir/ritonavir to ribavirin and corticosteroid treatment regimens appears to reduce incubation and mortality rates, especially when administered early. 12 Similarly, the half of niclosamide or promazine is left outside the active site ( Fig. 4c and d) , obviously the propane side chain in promazine is too long. For PNU inhibitor, seems it can basically fit into the active cleft, except the dihydrofuran side chain is a little bit long (Fig.  4e) . Finally, the inhibitor UC2 binds to a position that is slightly away from the active centre (Fig. 4f) , its neopentane or methylfuran side chain is a little long and makes it unable to insert into the active pocket properly. Indeed UC2 is the compound with lowest binding affinity as mentioned above. Taken together, our study illustrates that existing drugs/inhibitors may be used as starting points for the discovery of rationally designed anti-SARS proteinase drugs.
