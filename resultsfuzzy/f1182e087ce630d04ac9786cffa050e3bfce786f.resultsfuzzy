In order to detect the presence of TGEV-infection, two sera from each of the 550 farms positive by antibody-capture ELISA were tested by differential ELISA. In 130 farms where the two samples gave different results all the sera (533 samples more) were then tested. Results for 1633 sera from these 550 farms were as follows: 403 (24.7%) sera were TGEV-positive; 1230 ( 75.3% ) sera were TGEVnegative and PRCV-positive. Finally, the 569 farms of the epidemiological survey were grouped according to the observed results. Detection of one TGEV-positive serum was considered as indicating infection in that farm from TGEV. If no positive sera were found, it was considered to be infected only by PRCV. The herds in which all sera were negative to both viruses were classified as negative farms (Table 2 ) .
