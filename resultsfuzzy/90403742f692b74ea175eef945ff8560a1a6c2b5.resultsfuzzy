Design of the proposed method. The principle of the proposed method is illustrated in Fig. 1 was designed based on our previous research works 28 . The two hairpins (H1 and H2) do not initially interact with each other but can catalytically form a duplex in the presence of unstructured domain b and c. The unstructured domain e and f of H1 are able to form G-quadruplex. When domain e is hidden in the stem of H1, the G-quadruplex cannot be formed at this time. In the presence of target, the loop can hybridize with the target, forming a rigid duplex and disrupting the stem formed by domain b*and b. The liberated b and c further open H1, leading to the formation of toehold for strand displacement by H2. Then H2 hybridizes with the unfolded H1 and releases the complex of T0 and H0 (T0-H0) into next circulation. As a result, the generated abundant G-quadruplex structures are proportional to targets. The G-quadruplex structure can strongly bind with hemin to form the DNAzyme, displaying peroxidase-like activity, catalyzing oxidation of ABTS 2− to ABTS − .
