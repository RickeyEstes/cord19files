The purpose of the current study is two-fold. First, we perform a systematic comparison of common AutoDock Vina, 21 NNScore, 18, 19 and Glide protocols. In this study, a "protocol" refers to the two-step process used to computationally identify potential ligands. First, a compound model must be placed within a model of the binding pocket. Second, the binding affinity of that posed compound must be estimated. These two steps are called docking and scoring, respectively, and are often combined into a single algorithm. Vina and Glide, for example, both dock and score potential ligands; NNScore 1.0 and 2.0 only score (or rescore). We compare two neural-network docking scoring protocols, Vina−NNScore-1.0 and Vina−NNScore-2.0 (henceforth abbreviated Vina-NN1 and Vina-NN2, respectively) and several popular protocols that are based exclusively on either Vina or Glide. We show that while the performance of these docking schemes is highly receptor dependent, the mean screening performances of the Vina-NN1 and Glide protocols are not statistically different. 22−25 Second, we demonstrate that there are biases in most of the docking protocols studied, as has been demonstrated for other scoring functions. 23,29−32 Correcting for these biases improves the performance of the Vina-NN1 protocol further. Testing Docking Protocols: Receptor, Active, and Decoy Selection. In order to compare multiple docking protocols, it is useful to perform a series of "mock" virtual screens that draw from compound libraries containing both known ligands ("actives") and presumed decoy molecules. As the actives are known a priori, screen performance can be assessed by examining the ability of a given docking protocol to accurately separate out actives from decoys. The performance of a given protocol is often receptor specific; consequently, it is prudent to perform multiple screens into many diverse receptors when attempting to assess global utility. The Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD), 28 an excellent resource for facilitating these assessments, contains 40 diverse protein receptors and 2950 known actives. For each active, the DUD contains 36 topologically distinct presumed decoys that are by design chemically similar to the known inhibitors, as judged by metrics like molecular weight, cLogP, and the number of hydrogen-bonding groups. In the current work, we use the DUD receptors and known active compounds to assess several docking protocols; however, rather than using the DUD decoy molecules, we instead used 1560 models of compounds from the NCI diversity set III (presumed decoys), a set of publically available, diverse, drug-like molecules provided by the National Cancer Institute free of charge. Without wishing to in any way disparage the DUD decoy set, which is certainly useful in many contexts, it is important to understand why we opted to use the NCI compounds as decoys instead. Factors that influence molecular binding can be divided into two general categories: those that are ligand specific (i.e., independent of the receptor) and those that are binding specific (i.e., dependent on specific receptor−ligand interactions). The number of ligand rotatable bonds is a good example of a ligand-specific factor, as the immobility of highly flexible ligands that generally occurs upon binding is thought to be entropically unfavorable, independent of the receptor. In contrast, receptor−ligand complementarity of hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors is a good example of a binding-specific factor, as it depends specifically on interactions between the ligand and the receptor. In predicting ligand binding, it is prudent to consider both ligand-and binding-specific factors. The DUD decoys were specifically selected so as to be chemically similar to known actives; they consequently may lack the chemical heterogeneity that one would see in a set of compounds selected with diversity in mind (e.g., the NCI diversity set). On one hand, it is certainly possible that some scoring functions may be inappropriately biased in their assessment of ligand-specific factors. What if, for example, a scoring function inappropriately assigns better docking scores to compounds with larger dipole moments independent of the receptor, and coincidentally, the actives being screened tend to have larger dipole moments than the decoys? The idea of controlling for this inappropriate bias by intentionally selecting decoy molecules with dipole moments similar to those of the actives certainly has its appeal. On the other hand, insufficient chemical heterogeneity in the decoys may unfairly bias the evaluation of scoring functions that rely on valid assessments of ligand-specific factors. What if, for example, a scoring function correctly considers the number of ligand rotatable bonds in assessing the likelihood of binding but the actives and decoys all have the same number of rotatable bonds? Such a scoring function would be inappropriately penalized because its ability to utilize information about ligand rotatable bonds would be underexploited. Indeed, these types of concerns have lead others to use modified versions of the DUD decoy set. 42, 43 Of note, Vina includes one ligand-specific term in its scoring function (number of rotatable bonds), 21 and the NNScore functions include additional ligand-specific terms related to the number of ligand atom types. 18, 19 Consequently, while we believe convincing arguments can be made in favor of using the DUD decoys, in the current work, we opted to use the NCI compounds as decoys instead. A separate issue related to decoy selection must also be addressed. High-throughput screens typically have hit rates that range from 0.1% to 1.0%; 44−50 it is therefore reasonable to assume that for each DUD protein, the NCI set contains between 1 and 16 "decoys" that are in fact actives. A similar assumption underlies the set of DUD decoys, which have likewise not been explicitly tested to rule out binding. Possible inaccuracies in comparison metrics introduced by these kinds of assumptions are at least in part ameliorated by the fact that all the docking scoring protocols being compared are subject to the same assumption. Furthermore, the NCI set used in the current project may well have fewer true binders than the widely used DUD set, given that the DUD decoys were, as mentioned above, carefully chosen to be chemically similar to the DUD actives.
