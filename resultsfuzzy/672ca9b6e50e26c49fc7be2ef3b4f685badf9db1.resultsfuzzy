We perform data fitting of the model, described by (17), using historical daily infection data provided by the National Health Commission of China, from January 24, 2020 to February 13, 2020. Our approach, as described in the previous section, is to apply constrained nonlinear programming to find the best set of estimates for the unknown parameters and states. Data fitting for all 367 cities are performed. Values are updated iteratively in the optimization process. Moreover, since all parameters, like infection rates, are to be generated by fitting data with the model, the integrity of the data becomes crucial. As the official Wuhan data are expected to deviate from the true values quite significantly during the early outbreak stage due to uncertainty in diagnosis and other issues related to reporting of the epidemic by the local government, we have allowed the fitting errors for Wuhan to expand over a reasonable range, while the fitting errors for most other cities remain small. In addition, as the epidemic propagates in time, effective control measures and improved public education would reduce the infection rates for the susceptible and exposed individuals, making these parameters time varying in reality. Nonetheless, our fitting assumes these parameters being constant during the short fitting period for computational simplicity. The propagation profiles, in terms of the number of infected individuals and estimated number of exposed individuals, for all 367 cities are estimated. As limited by space, we only show in Figure 5 the results for 20 selected cities. This model can also provide projections of the number of infected and exposed individuals in the next 200 days, as shown in Figure 6 , which clearly show that the daily infection would reach a peak sooner or later. By running the identification algorithm, we identify the optimal parameter set as α = 0.5869, β = 0.8949, κ = 0.1008, and γ = 0.0602. From the estimated propagation profiles of the COVID-19 epidemic for all 367 cities, we have the following findings: • For most cities in China, the infection numbers will peak between mid February to early March 2020, as shown in Figure 7 (a). • The peak number of infected individuals will be between 1,000 to 5,000 for cities in Hubei, and that outside Hubei will be below 500, as shown in Figure 7 (b). • At the end, about 0.8%, less than 0.1% and less than 0.01% of the population will get infected in Wuhan, Hubei Province and the rest of China, respectively, as graphically presented in Figure 7 (c).
