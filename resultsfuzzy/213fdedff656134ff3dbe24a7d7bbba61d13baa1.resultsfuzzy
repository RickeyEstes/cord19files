CNS infiltration by CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes is a hallmark of CNS inflammation caused by neurotropic viral infection [29] . These cells migrate into the infected brain, where they differentiate into DC, macrophage, and microglia populations [30] [31] [32] [33] . Although the potential contribution of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes to neuroinflammation remains controversial, CNS infiltration by CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes is believed to support their protective role during lethal neuroinflammation [34] [35] [36] [37] . Therefore, in order to better understand the amelioration of JE in IDO KO mice, we examined CNS infiltration by leukocytes, including CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes, during JE progression. Wild-type BL/6 and IDO KO mice contained comparable levels of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes and CD11b + Ly-6G hi granulocytes in the brain before JEV infection. However, the frequency of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes gradually increased in the CNS of IDO KO mice during JE progression (Fig. 3a) . Also, CNS infiltration by CD11b + Ly-6G hi granulocytes was transiently increased in IDO KO mice 3 dpi, after which the Ly-6G hi granulocyte frequency was comparable in both BL/6 and IDO KO mice 5 dpi. Similarly, the accumulated total number of CNS-infiltrated Ly-6C hi monocytes and Ly-6G hi granulocytes was increased in IDO KO mice, compared to those of BL/6 mice (Fig. 3b) . Furthermore, because CD4 + Th1, CD8 + , and NK cells may play beneficial roles in controlling JE progression [38] [39] [40] [41] , we examined CNS infiltration of NK, CD4 + , and CD8 + Tcells. As with CNS infiltration by Ly-6C hi monocytes, CNS infiltration by NK, CD4 + , and CD8 + T-cells was observed to gradually increase in IDO KO mice compared to levels observed in BL/6 mice (Fig. 3c, d) . Notably, CD8 + T-cells showed marked infiltration with threefold increased levels in the CNS of IDO KO mice. With respect to CNS inflammation, the expression of cytokines and chemokines within the CNS may be required to fully explain encephalitis, because encephalitis caused by neurotropic viruses is indirectly derived from CNS degeneration caused by robust immunological responses, such as the uncontrolled secretion of cytokines, including TNF-α, and the resultant activation of microglia and astrocytes [22, 23] . Therefore, we examined the expression of TNF-α and CC chemokines in the CNS. Our results revealed that the expression of CC chemokines was comparable in both BL/6 and IDO KO mice, except that the expression levels of TNF-α and CCL2 were modestly decreased in IDO KO mice (Fig. 3e) . This result implies that CC chemokine expression may not play a role in increased CNS infiltration by Ly-6C hi monocytes, NK, CD4 + , and CD8 + T-cells. Collectively, these results suggest that IDO ablation allows for early and increased CNS infiltration by myeloid and lymphoid leukocytes, which may mediate the early control of viral replication in the CNS.
