These two factors, together with ATP, are normally specifically required for the binding of 5'-capped mRNA to the 43-S ribosome complex (119) (120) (121) . The eIF-4A is an ATP-dependent singlestranded RNA-binding protein that displays mRNA-dependent ATPiase activity (119) ; eIF-4F is the three-subunit cap-binding protein (CBP) complex that includes eIF-4A, the CBP eIF-4E, and p220 (120) ; and, eIF-4B is a factor whose exact function remains unknown, but which appears to stimulate the activities of eIF-4A and eIF-4F and to function in the binding of mRNA to the 43  


Section:recognized by the protein synthesis initiation factors and ribosome subunits that results in the internal, cap-independent initiation of translation. biochemical evidence suggests that protein-synthesis initiation factors eif-4a and eif-4b may play important roles in capindependent, internal initiation of eukaryotic mrna translation (1 18).
