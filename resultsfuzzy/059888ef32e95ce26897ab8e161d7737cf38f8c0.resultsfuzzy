Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) mapping to three topographically linked sites on MHV-4 E2 have been identified (Talbot et al., 1984b) . Two of these, 5B19.2 (epitope E2A) and 5A13.5 (E2B) were previously shown in passive transfer experiments to protect mice from lethal encephalitis (Buchmeier et al., 1984) . The third MAb, 4Bll.6 (E2C) neutralized virus in vitro but did not protect mice against challenge in vivo. These properties are summarized in Table 1 . We selected variants from 3 × cloned virus stocks by incubating in excess antibody for 30 rain at 37 ° C, then plaqued the surviving virus in the presence of antibody. Plaques which escaped neutralization were selected and subjected to a second round of neutralization. Stocks were then grown and rechecked for resistance to antibody. We observed a frequency of true variants in the initial population of 10 -4.3 to 10 -46, a rate consistent with other RNA virus systems (Laver et al., 1979 Dietzschold et al., 1983; Minor et al., 1983) . Three variants each selected using MAb 5A13.5 and 4Bll.3 were chosen from a panel of over 30 for further study. We were surprised to observe that variants selected with either antibody were resistant to neutralization by both (Dalziel et al., 1986) (Table 2 ) and further studies with a panel of monoclonals raised against MHV-JHM E2 independently by Dr. John Fleming further substantiated this observation (Fig. 1) . It appeared then that selection of neutralization-resistant variants at either the E2B or E2C sites induced conformational changes reflected in both sites. We know from previous studies (Talbot et al., 1984a ) that both of these sites are predominantly conformational in nature. With the knowledge that we had selected variants, we were interested in determining whether the antigenic changes resulted in altered virulence. We determined LDs0 values for representative variants (Table 3 ) and observed 200-to > 4000-fold decreases in neurovirulence following i.c. inoculation relative to wild-type MHV-4. At the histopathologic level, mice infected with either class of variant had moderate inflammatory lesions in the white matter of their spinal cords and brains early in the infection at days 4-15, and subsequently developed extensive demyelinating lesions (Fig. 2) . We observed remyelination beginning around 3 weeks ( Fig. 3 ) but demyelination apparently continued since lesions observed 50 and 65 days after infection were severe and showed evidence of both recent and old foci (Fig. 4) . We found no significant evidence of neuronal involvement, suggesting that the E2 variants had lost neurovirulence in a manner similar to ts 8 (Haspel et al., 1978) . Apparently, replication of the variant viruses is not fulminant in the CNS. We were only able to isolate virus by cocultivation by 15 days after infection (Table 4 ), but the virus which was recovered retained the antibody-resistant variant phenotype. Thus, paradoxically, the virus-induced pathology persisted in the absence of demonstrable infectious virus. The possibility exists that stimulation of specific cell-mediated immune responses against viral antigens and/or host components such as myelin basic protein (MBP) are triggered in the infection and contribute to the chronic demyelinating disease. Alternatively virus may persist in limited cell populations such as the basal ganglia (Fishman et al., 1985) and continually re-initiate the demyelinating disease at the primary level. We have ~ddressed the first of these two alternatives. In recent studies with the ts 342 strain of MHV-A59 we have demonstrated significant levels of proliferation measured as [3H]thymidine incorporation when lymphocytes from virus-infected mice were cultured in the presence of either viral antigen or MBP. Responder cells were shown to be T-lymphocytes and were reduced to baseline levels by in vivo depletion of the L3T4 subset. We are currently studying this response at the cellular level, cloning the responder cells, and probing to determine the fate and expression of our attenuated variants of MHV-4 in the CNS during acute and chronic demyelinating disease. These studies illustrate that mutational changes in a specific viral glycoprotein,~ E2, are reflected in pathogenicity differences in vivo. We hope that defining such changes at the molecular level and their effect on cellular tropism and replication in the CNS will lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of virus-induced CNS disease in man.
