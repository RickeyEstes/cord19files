The XPS was used to study the valences and distributions of the Mn, Cu, and Ni ions in the spinel structure. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the XPS spectra for Mn 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 3/2 of a [(Ni x Mn 1-x ) 0.84 Cu 0.16 ] 3 O 4 (x = =0.25) thin film samples, respectively. The Mn 2p 3/2 peak was deconvoluted into three peaks of Mn 2+ , Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ at the corresponding binding energies of 641.0 eV, 642.3 eV and 644.0 eV, respectively [5] ; similarly, the Cu 2p 3/2 peak was deconvoluted into two peaks of Cu + and Cu 2+ at binding energies of 930.9 eV and 933.4 eV, respectively [15] . It should be noted that, as the Ni content increases, the ratio of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ in the B sites approaches to unity. The conductivity is known to have maximum when the numbers of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ are identical [18] . In other words, the resistivity tends to decrease when the ratio of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ in the B sites approaches unity, which agrees well with our experimentally measured data shown in Fig. 6 . Fig. 7 shows the resistivity of [(Ni x Mn 1-x ) 0.84 Cu 0.16 ] 3 O 4 thin films annealed at 380°C for 5 h, as a function of temperature. As the temperature increases, the resistivity decreases, which is a typical characteristics of negative-temperature-coefficient (NTC) thermistor. Further, the resistivity decreases with the increase of Ni content in the films. In order to explain the electrical properties of NTC materials based on nickel-manganite, it is necessary to understand the small polaron hopping model as well as the surface morphology [7] . The electrical conductivity of nickel-manganite-based NTC materials is affected by carrier hopping between Mn 4+ and Mn 3+ ions at the B sites [16, 19] . Therefore, the dependence of the resistivity on the Mn 4+ /Mn 3+ values in Fig. 6 is due to the carrier hopping between Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ . As shown in Table 2 , Ni plays a role in controlling the ratio of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ in B sites. The small polaron hopping model is expressed by the following equation [20] , where C is a constant, T is the absolute temperature, α and p are power law exponents, and T 0 is the characteristic temperature. When α = =p = 1, the electron hopping model becomes the nearest-neighbor hopping (NNH) model, and the spinel manganite film generally follows the NNH model. Therefore, the expression of Eq. (1) can be rewritten as follows: From the plot of ln(ρ/T) vs 1/T as shown in Fig. 8 , the linear regression analysis yields T 0 , which is proportional to E a in the NNH model. E a can be calculated from the following equation [8] , where k B is the Boltzmann constant. The values of calculated T 0 and E a are listed in Table 3 . It was suggested by Elbadraoui et al. that electron conduction may also proceed via jumping between Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ ions on more distant B-sites through Cu + and Cu 2+ ions at the A-sites [10] . This process can be expressed as follows: [16] . Considering the fact that the Cu content does not show any meaningful trend as shown in Table 1 , however, we believe that this mechanism would not have a strong influence on changes in the electrical characteristics. An important factor with regard to the sensitivity of NTC films is the TCR value. The TCR value at 298 K (T) can be evaluated using the following equation [8] : Table 3 shows that the TCR of the annealed films decreased with an increase of Ni content (x) in the film, which shows the same trend to the change in T 0 and E a .
