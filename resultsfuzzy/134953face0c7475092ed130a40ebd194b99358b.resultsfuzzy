The surface densities of the immobilized proteins, as determined from surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements, were 2.9, 1.2, and 0.72 mg/m 2 for the 7-, 6-, and 5-repeat forms, respectively. In the absence of Ni 2þ there was no detectable nonspecific protein adsorption, indicating that all proteins bound selectively by their histidine tags. The molecular weights of the monomers of the length variants are 35 344 Da (7-repeat), 32 718 Da (6-repeat), and 30 119 Da (5-repeat), so that the calculated monomer surface densities were Γ 7 = 4.9 Â 10 16 , Γ 6 = 2.1 Â 10 16 , and Γ 5 = 1.4 Â 10 16 monomers/m 2 . In the absence of ligand, the normalized force versus distance curves obtained with the surface force apparatus were reversible and exhibited intersurface repulsion due to steric interactions between the protein and bare lipid monolayers ( Figure S1 ). The thickness of the unbound protein D T was determined from the distance at which the repulsive force exceeded the measurement standard deviation of (0.03 mN/m. Thicknesses of 31.5 ( 0.5, 27.6 ( 0.5, and 22.4 ( 0.5 nm were thus obtained for the 7-, 6-, and 5-repeat DC-SIGNR monolayers, respectively. Instead of increasing the range of the intersurface repulsion, the presence of the bulky neoglycolipid on the target membrane resulted in the protein monolayers jumping into contact with the membranes, at distances that were smaller than the thickness of unbound protein, D T . Figure 2 shows the forceÀdistance curve measured between the 6-repeat form of DC-SIGNR and a 5 mol % Man 9 GlcNAc 2 -DPPE monolayer. The surfaces jump into adhesive contact (left pointing arrow) from membrane separations D J . In force measurements, surfaces jump to contact when the gradient of the intersurface potential exceeds the spring constant. 26 The jump-in distance D J , trajectory, and final resting position at contact D C are determined by the spring constant, which was 205 N/m in these measurements. Here, the normalized force at D C is slightly negative (∼À0.1 mN/m). The equilibrium separation D eq is at F = 0 where the attractive and repulsive forces balance. The DC-SIGNR length variants with 7-, 6-, and 5-neck repeats jumped to contact with the neoglycolipid layers from distances of respectively D J, 7 = 30.6 ( 1. 1 nm for the 7-, 6-, and 5-repeat proteins. The greater uncertainty in determinations of D eq is due to the low force values relative to the measurement uncertainty of (0.03 and the shallow slopes near D eq , especially with the 5-repeat variant (cf. Figure 3C ). In these measurements, Biochemistry ARTICLE the average value of D eq is less than D C by 2.1 ( 0.5 nm (Table 1) due to the relatively soft repulsion at D < D eq . In the majority of the measurements, at D < D C the force curve is nearly flat for ∼1.5 nm (Figure 2 ), before increasing more steeply. This jump-to-contact is evidence of functionally active protein because the mechanical instability, which underlies the jump-in requires an attractive force between the ligand and protein monolayers. Protein inactivation would ablate the attraction. All three DC-SIGNR variants exhibit this jump-to-contact behavior, which was also observed in comparable experiments with DC-SIGN. 18 Furthermore, the observation that both D C and D eq are significantly less than D T , despite the presence of the bulky glycan on the target membrane, is attributed to flexibility in the DC-SIGN structure that enables the proteins to undergo a conformational change upon binding the target neoglycolipid. 18 Such protein flexibility would increase the reaction cross section of the CRDs and hence the range of interaction of the CRDs as well as their ability to bind ligands at different, lateral spatial distributions on target surfaces. Both DC-SIGN and all three DC-SIGNR variants exhibit this flexibility, although it is less apparent with the 5-repeat form of DC-SIGNR, due to the weaker attraction. Elasticity in the DC-SIGNR/glycolipid complex is also apparent from comparisons of approaching and receding forceÀ distance curves between the various forms of DC-SIGNR and Man 9 GlcNAc 2 membranes. During separation, the bonds fail and the surfaces pull out of contact at the position of the maximum adhesion (D Adh ) ( Figure 2B, right pointing arrow) . For the 7and 6-repeat forms of DC-SIGNR, D Adh exceeds D eq by 3.5 nm (Table 1 , Figures 2B and 3A,B) . This difference must result from stretching of the DC-SIGNR/Man 9 GlcNAc 2 complex such that, upon separation, the complexes extend relative to their equilibrium thickness D eq . This may be due, in part, to the reorientation of the carbohydrate ligand. Protein flexibility, which enables the DC-SIGNR variants to jump to contact at D C < D T , would also play a role in this force-dependent stretching. Comparison of the D C or D eq values for the 7-repeat DC-SIGNR with an exactly equivalent construct for the extracellular domain of DC-SIGN 18 reveals that the average difference of 1.3 nm is larger for DC-SIGN than for DC-SIGNR (p < 0.05, DF = 13; Table 1 ). In pairwise comparisons, a p value less than 0.05 signifies a statistically significant difference at the 95% confidence level. As noted in Figure 1 , differences in the sequence of the neck repeat adjacent to the CRD in DC-SIGNR are postulated to result in the splaying apart of this repeat and the CRDs compared to DC-SIGN ( Figure 1B) , which would make the bound thickness of DC-SIGN slightly longer than DC-SIGNR. 17 Thus, the forceÀdistance measurements provide experimental evidence to support this model of the differences in the arrangement of the distal portion of the DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR extracellular domains ( Figure 1B) . At D < D eq , the repulsive force increases with decreasing membrane separation (Figures 2 and 3) , and the slope reflects the rigidity of the proteinÀligand complexes. The slopes of the curves obtained with the 6-repeat and 7-repeat forms, as well as with DC-SIGN, 18 are indicative of relatively rigid protein layers and hence relatively rigid necks ( Figure 3A,B) . By contrast, the forceÀdistance curve measured with the 5-repeat form at D < D eq is much shallower and does not increase steeply until D < 4À5 nm ( Figure 3C ), which is the approximate diameter of a folded CRD. 29 The forceÀdistance profile at D > 4 nm is similar to flexible polymers 30 and suggests that the neck region is unstructured in a significant population of the immobilized 5-repeat protein. The difference between the 5-repeat and other forms of DC-SIGNR and DC-SIGN is attributed to the loss of rigidity conferred by the tetramer. Tetramer dissociation into dimers could also lead to greater protein inactivation under applied force. This exception, relative to the behavior of the stable 6-and 7-repeat tetramers, provides evidence that the rigid neck region and relatively steep force profiles at D < D eq ( Figure 3A,B) requires stable tetramers. The adhesion energy per area between DC-SIGNR and 5 mol % Man 9 GlcNAc 2 -DPPE monolayers is determined from the pull-off force F po at the minimum in the forceÀdistance curve D Adh ( Figure 2B ) and the DerjaguinÀM€ ullerÀToporov model. 28 At the position of bond rupture ( Figure 2B, D Adh ) , the surfaces jump out of contact (Figures 2 and 3 , right pointing arrows). There is no evidence of irreversible damage to the membranes due to, for example, lipid pull-out or the rupture of the NTAÀhexahistidine linkage. This would be evident in altered force curves measured at the same position after membrane separation, as documented previously. 31 In these studies, Biochemistry ARTICLE upon reapproach after detachment, the measured force curve, D J , and D C were unchanged (Figure 2 ). When separating the surfaces, D Adh and the pull-off force were similar within experimental error, even after as many as seven successive measurements at the same contact site. The average time between successive measurements was 10À15 min, which is too short for damaged membranes to heal 31 but more than sufficient to allow re-equilibration, as evidenced by the reversibility of the measurements. The reversibility is expected because this is a multivalent (number of bonds = 4) interaction, and the affinity of individual monomerÀglycan bonds is relatively low. Leckband et al. 31 showed that lipid pull-out occurs at receptorÀligand bond energies >∼15kT, which is much higher than the energies of the individual monomerÀglycan bonds. Each tetramer is also anchored to the membranes via four hexahistidine anchors. The adhesion energies per area measured with the 7-repeat and 6-repeat variants are respectively 0.32 ( 0.04 and 0.13 ( 0.03 mJ/m 2 ( Table 2) . When normalized by the protein density on the membranes, the estimated adhesion energies per tetramer are E Adh,7 = 8.0 ( 1.3 kT/molecule and E Adh,6 = 6.9 ( 2.1 kT/ molecule, respectively ( Table 2) . Estimating the adhesion energy per DC-SIGNR molecule for the 5-repeat form is not feasible because of the decreased tetramer stability caused by the truncation associated with the addition of the histidine tag employed in these force measurements. 19 Comparing the estimated, population-averaged adhesion energy per monomer ( Figure 4A ) may provide a better basis for comparison of adhesion by the different DC-SIGNR forms. The calculated energies per monomer for the 7-repeat and 6-repeat forms are 2.0 ( 0.2 and 1.7 ( 0.4 kT/monomer, respectively. These values are statistically similar (p value = 0.7, DF = 12). They are also similar to the adhesion energy per DC-SIGN monomer of 2.0 ( 0.3 kT/monomer (p value = 0.3, DF = 18) after 8 min of contact. 18 However, the calculated adhesion energy per monomer for the 5-repeat DC-SIGNR is 0.2 ( 0.1 kT/ monomer. The much lower adhesion mediated by the 5-repeat DC-SIGNR might at first be unexpected, since the CRDs fold autonomously and appear to be fully functional based on solution binding data and on affinity purification. 20 Hydrodynamic measurements show that this protein forms mixture of interconverting dimers and tetramers. However, some of the 5-repeat DC-SIGNR proteins may not be optimally oriented for binding, and it is possible that the dimers are more prone to unfolding under an applied force. Both factors would reduce the adhesion. The softer repulsion (shallow, repulsive force at D < D C ) is also attributed to the mixture of dimers and tetramers. The 5-repeat DC-SIGNR shows completely different behavior in the force measurements relative to the 6-and 7-repeat forms. Viewed in this way, these findings provide important confirmation that the force measurements with the longer versions of DC-SIGNR reflect the interactions of rigid, stable tetramers that orient perpendicular to the membrane. The forceÀdistance measurements quantify the molecular dimensions of the DC-SIGNR-Man 9 GlcNAc 2 complex and thus provide direct evidence for an extended configuration of the extracellular domain of DC-SIGNR. At initial contact, the length of the 7-repeat form of DC-SIGNR complexed with the glycan is D C = 26.6 ( 0.8 nm ( Table 1) . Modeling of the structure of the extracellular domain of DC-SIGNR bound to a Man 9 GlcNAc 2 oligosaccharide 17 suggests that the overall length of the ligand complex of the DC-SIGNR fragment used in the forceÀdistance measurements would be 26.5À27.0 nm, which agrees quite well with the measurements reported here. The crystallographic and forceÀdistance measurements also agree well with hydrodynamic measurement on the extracellular domains and the isolated neck domains. 19, 32 The equilibrium thickness is smaller at ∼25 nm but still comparable to the model prediction. The slope of the line relating the distances at initial contact D C and the number of neck repeats gives a value of 3.87 ( 0.23 nm/ repeat (N = 22) ( Figure 3B ), which matches almost exactly the length of 3.7 nm for a single repeat determined from the crystallographic analysis of the isolated neck region. 17 A similar Biochemistry ARTICLE plot of D eq versus the number of repeats is shifted slightly, but the calculated slope is 3.6 ( 1.4 (N = 22). The larger error in the latter reflects the greater uncertainty in the estimated value of D eq , as discussed above. However, the comparative length measurements presented here provide exceptionally important direct experimental evidence that the neck repeat structure, which is observed essentially as a fragment out of context in the crystal structure, is an accurate reflection of the conformation of the neck in the intact molecule.
