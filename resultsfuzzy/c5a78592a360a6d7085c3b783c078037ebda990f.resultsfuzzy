Our results demonstrate the ability to distinguish viral from bacterial infection within 2-8 hours of hospital admission, Table 4 . It is thus possible to reconsider the need for respiratory isolation and antimicrobial therapy before the second scheduled dose of empiric antibacterials. 4.6. Influence of rapid viral diagnostics and serum PCT levels on de-escalation The absence of an elevated PCT level in a patient with a clinical syndrome compatible with a viral illness strongly suggests the absence of an active bacterial infection, and no benefit to empiric antibiotic therapy (Becker et al., 2008; Branche et al., 2015; Falsey et al., 2013; Gelfer et al., 2015; Gilbert, 2011 Gilbert, , 2015 Schuetz et al., 2012 Schuetz et al., , 2013 . Despite the presence of only a respiratory viral pathogen and normal PCT levels, empiric antibiotics were discontinued within 48 hours in only 8 of 25 (32%) patients in this study, and 2 of 11 in that of Oosterheert et al. Branche et al., 2015 evaluated 151 patients hospitalized with lower, non-pneumonic respiratory tract infections, of whom 126 had a serum PCT level of b0.25 ng/mL and 42% or 50%(?) had a viral pathogen detected. The result was a shorter duration of antibiotic therapy, P = 0.004 and fewer patients discharged with a prescription for antibiotics, P = 0.002.
