ing in the following changes of encoded nsP2 protein, were made using T7-P1234 plasmid 39 and PCR-based site directed mutagenesis; designations of the obtained constructs are provided in parentheses: Cys478 to Ala (T7-P12 CA 34), Trp479 to Ala (T7-P12 WA 34), Ser482 to Ala (T7-P12 SA 34) and Cys478 and Ser482 to alanine residues (T7-P12 CA+SA 34). To introduce similar mutations into SFV trans-replicase plasmid P123Z4 42 , hereafter designated as SFV-T7-P123 Z 4, PCR-based site directed mutagenesis was used. The obtained plasmids were designated as SFV-T7-P12 CA 3 Z 4, SFV-T7-P12 WA 3 Z 4, SFV-T7-P12 SA 3 Z 4 and SFV-T7-P12 CA+SA 3 Z 4. The sequences of the constructs were verified through DNA sequencing. to Ala, Trp479 to Ala, Ser482 to Ala or Cys478 and Ser482 to alanine residues of nsP2 were introduced into pSP6-CHIKV (an infectious cDNA clone of CHIKV ECSA genotype, LR-2006-OPY1 isolate 47 ); obtained clones were designated pSP6-CHIKV C478A , pSP6-CHIKV W479A , pSP6-CHIKV S482A and pSP6-CHIKV C478A+S482A . All these manipulations were done by using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis and subcloning procedures; sequences were verified. Plasmids containing CHIKV cDNA were linearized and transcribed in vitro using the mMESSAGE mMA-CHINE SP6 Transcription kit (Ambion), to obtain capped RNAs. These procedures as well as ICA were performed as previously described 16 . Recombinant viruses (wt CHIKV and CHIKV S482A ) were harvested at 18 h p.t.; for cells transfected with transcripts of pSP6-CHIKV C478A , pSP6-CHIKV W479A or pSP6-CHIKV C478A+S482A the cell culture supernatants were collected at 144 h p.t. The transfected cells were collected at the same time and lysed by boiling in Laemmli buffer. Western blot analysis. Cells transfected with 1 μ g of T7-P1234, T7-P12 CA 34, T7-P12 WA 34, T7-P12 SA 34, T7-P12 CA+SA 34 or T7-P1234 GAA were lysed at 18 h p.t. with SDS loading buffer; lysates from cells transfected with RNA transcripts were obtained as described above. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and detected using primary antibodies against CHIKV ns proteins (trans-replicase transfected cells) or against CHIKV capsid protein (RNA transcript transfected cells). Antibody against β -actin (sc-47778; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as loading control. The membranes were then incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (LabAs Ltd, Estonia) and proteins were visualized using ECL Immunoblot Detection kit (GE Healthcare).
