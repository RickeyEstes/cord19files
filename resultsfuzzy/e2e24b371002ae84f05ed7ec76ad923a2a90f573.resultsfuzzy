In order to map the neutralizing determinant of DEN-2 E recognized by the 3H5 mAb, we have made use of an E. coil expression vector pOTS (Fig. 1 BamHl site for cloning foreign genes downstream from the PL promoter, the ribosome-binding site, and the translation-initiation site (Rosenberg et al., 1983) . For expression, the cDNA fragment encoding the E polypeptide between PvulI and EcoRI sites of the pKT2.4 plasmid (Irie et al., 1989) was cloned into the pOTS vector (pTT10 in Table I ) was used. The polypeptide encoded by pTT10 contains the E sequence from aa 1 to aa 470, as well as seven hydrophobic aa upstream from the N terminus, but lacks 25 aa at the C terminus of the E protein. Next, several deletion constructs were made in the Nterminal, C-terminal, or internal regions such that the translational reading frame was maintained (Fig. 1) . The progressively shortened N-terminal deletions of the E protein were made by cleaving the PvuII-EcoRI fragment with restriction enzymes Tth l l lI, Scal, Sphl and Ncol (see Table I ). These DNA fragments were cloned at the BamHI site of pOTS vector to generate the clones, pTT 15, pTT20, pTT25, and pTT30, respectively. These clones had the correct orientation for expression of the E polypeptides with progressively longer N-terminal deletions (see Table I ). The internal deletion ofthe E protein was made by removing the region encoding 166 aa flanked by the two BamHI restriction sites from the plasmid pTT15 ( Fig. 1 and Table I ). This plasmid encodes the polypeptide lacking aa 255 to 422 in the vicinity of the C terminus. The parent and the truncated expression constructs of E polypeptide were analyzed for their levels of expression in E. coil N5151 strain, and tested for their reactivities with the polyclonal HMAF (Fig. 2 , panel A), as well as the 3H5 mAb (Fig. 2, panel B) , by Western blotting. The expression plasmid pTTI0 gave rise to an E polypeptide which was lower in size than the expected 51 kDa ( Fig. 2A and 2B, lane 1), most likely due to its instability in E. coll. However, the polypeptide expressed from pTTIS was of expected size (see Fig. 2A and 2B, lane 2), suggesting that removal of the N-terminal 29 aa, including the seven hydrophobic residues, stabilized this protein considerably. The level of this polypeptide was high enough to be visualized directly by Coomassie blue staining of the polyacrylamide gel (data not shown). The E polypeptides containing progressively shorter N-terminal sequences expressed from the plasmids pTT20, pTT25 and pTT30, respectively, were loaded in lanes 3, 4 and 5, and the authentic E protein present in the DEN-2-infected mosquito (C6/ 36) cell lysates was loaded in lane C of Fig. 2 . The levels of expression, and their immunoreactivities with HMAF and the 3H5 mAb of these E polypeptides varied. However, the size of the largest polypeptide expressed from a deletion construct, which was reactive with HMAF and/or the 3H5 mAb correlated well with its predicted value. The 3H5 mAb reacted with all the E polypeptides with Nterminal deletions, except with the one lacking aa 255 to 422 (Fig. 2B, lane 6) . These data indicated that the anti- Reactivitics of E polypeptides with the polyclonal HMAF and DEN-2 type-specific 3H5 mAb. E. cog N5151 cells were transformed by the expression plasmids and tested for the synthesis of E polypeptides as described for pKC 30 and its derivatives (Rosenberg et al., 1983) . Briefly, the bacterial cells were grown at 32°C to A65 o = 1.0 in LB medium containing 100/~g Ap/ml, and then the temperature was shifted to 42°C by adding equal volume of LB medium prewarmed to 65 °C. The culture was incubated at 42 °C for an additional 60 rain. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with TES buffe) (10 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.5/! mM EDTA/0.1 M NaCI). Total bacterial pellets resuspended in 300 gl of Laemmli (1970) sample buffer were heated to 100°C for 5 rain and were analysed by 0.1% SDS/10• PAGE (Laemmli, 1970) . Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose (Towbin and Gordon, 1984) in a buffer containing 25raM Tris'HCI/150mM glycine, pH 8.3/20% methanol/l% SDS at 200 mA for 4 h. Blots were blocked for 30 rain in 22~ nonfat dry milk/0.9% NaCI/10 mM Tris.HCI, pH 7.5. After washing with 50 mM Tris.HCI, pH 7.5/200 mM NaC! (TBS), the blots were then incubated sequentially with 1:500 dilution of HMAF (panel A), or 1:500 dilution of 3H5 mAb (panel B), goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Hyclone, Logan, UT), and a mixture of 5bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. Blots were washed 3 times between incubations with TBS for 10 min each. When color had developed sufficiently, the reaction was stopped by adding stop buffer (20 mM Tris. HCI/5 mM EDTA). Panels A and B, lanes 1-6: bacterial extracts containing E polypeptides expressed from pTTI0, pTT15, p'l"r20, pTT25, pTr30 and pTT35, respectively. The E coding sequences contained in these plasmids are described under Fig. 1 and Table I . In lane C, the cell lysate from C6/36 (mosquito) cells infected with DEN-2 was loaded as a positive control. The preparation and characterization of 3H5 mAb and the polyclonal HMAF antibodies against DEN-2 viral antigens have previously been reported (Brandt et al., 1967; Henchal et al., 1982) . genic determinant of the protein recognized by the 3H5 mAb is located within a region of 166 aa (between aa 255 and 422) (Fig. 3 ).
