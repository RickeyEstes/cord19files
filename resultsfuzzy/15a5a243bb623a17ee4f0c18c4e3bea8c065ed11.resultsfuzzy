As shown as in Fig 1A, TGEV infection triggered a significant increase in glucose uptake in IPEC-J2 cells at 48 and 60 h post-infection (hpi). In addition, during late-stage infection, TGEV-infected cells were able to continue transporting glucose, even when the concentration of glucose in the cell culture medium was low. These data indicate that TGEV infection promotes glucose uptake in IPEC-J2 cells. While Fig 1B-1F show the mRNA and protein levels of SGLT1 and GLUT2 at various time points. Notably, while there were no marked changes in the mRNA expression of the SGLT1 and GLUT2 genes after TGEV infection, there were significant increases in the protein expression of both SGLT1 and GLUT2 at 48 and 60 hpi. To exclude the possibility that cell viability and proliferation may affect glucose uptake, CFSE-labeled mock-infected (control), TGEVinfected (TGEV), and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP)-treated (CCCP) cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis. CCCP is known to reduce cell viability and proliferation, and was therefore utilized as a positive control [15] . As shown in Fig 1G-1I ,  To further investigate the role of TGEV infection-enhanced EGFR in the regulation of glucose uptake, we examined the effects of TGEV infection after treatment or transfection with AG1478, shEGFR, or pLVX-EGFR on glucose uptake. As shown in Fig 4A and 4D , transfection with shEGFR and treatment with AG1478 significantly inhibited glucose uptake, whereas transfection with pLVX-EGFR enhanced glucose uptake. Therefore, we concluded that EGFR mediates glucose uptake in TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells. Moreover, As shown in Fig 4B, 4C , 4E and 4F, after TGEV infection, western blot analysis showed that transfection with shEGFR and treatment with AG1478 resulted in lower protein expression of SGLT1 and GLUT2 than that observed in the control group, whereas transfection with pLVX-EGFR resulted in increased SGLT1 and GLUT2 protein expression. Together, these results indicate that EGFR influences glucose uptake in TGEV-infected cells by promoting both SGLT1 and GLUT2 expression.
