Detection and quantification of the targets identified by RPM-IVDC1 were confirmed by using qRT-PCR (7500 real-time PCR system; Applied Biosystems) as described previously. These targets included S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, K. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae ( Table 2) . Compared with the targets identified by RPM-IVDC1, these qRT-PCRs targeted other regions of the same gene or other genes different from RPM-IVDC1 targets. A positive and negative control in each set PCR assay was included to survey the possibility of laboratory contamination. All the qRT-PCR methods were reported previously ( -Zetsma et al., 1999) . For others potential respiratory bacteria including S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Neisseria meningitides, and GAS not covered by RPM-IVDC1, an additional set of qRT-PCRs targeting these organisms were performed in consideration of probability of false-negative results. All the qRT-PCR methods were reported previously ( Table 2 ) and validated in our laboratory.
