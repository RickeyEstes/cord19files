Given that overexpression of NPM1 significantly affected PEDV replication in Vero E6 cells, it was interesting to investigate whether knockdown of NPM1 also affected PEDV replication. To this end, siRNA-mediated knockdown of NPM1 in Vero E6 cells infected with PEDV was investigated. As shown in Fig. 7A and B, knockdown of NPM1 resulted in downregulation of N protein expression at 48 or 60 hpi, accompanied by a significant reduction of viral load in the cell culture supernatants in comparison with that in the cells treated with a scramble siRNA (siScr), mock-treated cells, or normal Vero E6 cells (no treatment) (Fig. 7C ). This indicated that growth of PEDV was arrested in cells with a reduced level of NPM1. Together with the results of the overexpression experiments, these data highlight the synergistic action of cellular NPM1 expression on PEDV replication and N protein expression.
