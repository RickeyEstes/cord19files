A primary screen of a 13,001 compound library at a 10 µM final concentration was conducted using the 384-well format. Z′ values ranged from 0.54-0.83 with a median of 0.74. Average S/B was 17 and S/N for each plate ranged from 10.8 to 23.9 with a mean of 16.94 and standard deviation of 2.95 (Figure 2A and 2B) . These statistical values indicate that the assay provided high quality and the required robustness and reproducibility of an HTS assay. In this assay the overall average inhibitions were 0.7% with a standard deviation of 4.184% and the control drug MPA showed 44.6% inhibition on average. The percent inhibition cutoff was 13.25% that represents the viral mean + three standard deviations, a common method of statistically defining hits in a single dose screen. Using this cutoff method, 13.25%, 92 compounds were identified as active WNV inhibitors ( Figure 2C ).
