Except for two positive samples that gave high OD values on negative control wells (0.190 and 0.256), the negative control OD values ranged from -0.047 to 0.104. The maximum OD observed on the test well was 1.092 OD units and the maximum OD difference was 1.031. Figure 1 shows the relationship between the OD difference ( Y axis) and the flotation results (X axis ) for the 73 positive samples. It appears that this relationship cannot be quantified.  The 11 doubtful samples are also shown in Fig. 1 (arrows) . After the first examination, these 11 samples gave discordant results. They were slightly positive (some oocysts per slide) in the flotation assay and negative in ELISA, or vice versa. The samples were tested again (Flotation 2 and ELISA 2 ) and in some cases stained by the Ziehl-Neelsen modified technique. The results are summarized in Table 1 . These data indicate that when the faecal sample contains few oocysts both ELISA and flotation assays give variable results. Nevertheless, the ELISA failed to show four samples (8, 9, 10 and 11 ) that were slightly positive by flotation. On the other hand, Samples 3 and 4 (Table 1 ), that were positive by ELISA and negative by flotation, are not false-positives. They contained few oocysts, as seen on the stained smear. It is possible that the physical structure of the faecal material (fat, debris, etc. ) interfered with the flotation and that very few oocysts reached the top of the tube. The staining technique is always more sensitive, but is time consuming.
