Nutritional deficiencies commonly occur as a consequence of GI disease. 31 Protein and calorie malnutrition is the most common nutritional deficiency in severe or chronic GI disease. Not surprisingly, deficiencies of electrolytes (eg, sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate) and divalent cations (eg, magnesium, zinc, and calcium) are also common, and should be corrected. 31 A variety of vitamin deficiencies may also occur as a result of severe intestinal disease. Deficiencies of B vitamins, especially cobalamin, and some of the fat soluble vitamins (E and K) are the most common and clinically important micronutrient deficiencies recognized in dogs and cats. 1, 4, 31 Cobalamin deficiency alone, especially in cats, can lead to the development of GI dysfunction and diarrhea, thus, the assessment of cobalamin status in cats with GI disease is very important. 32 Furthermore, deficiencies of B vitamins can occur very quickly in cats that are anorectic or in those with severe GI disease because they have a 4-times higher need for thiamin, niacin, pantothenic acid, and pyridoxine than do dogs. 3 Thus, parenteral supplementation in cats with GI disease or anorexia is very important to prevent these deficiencies. Little is known about deficiencies of microminerals. However, it is reasonable to assume that copper, selenium, zinc, and others may be affected, and thus corrected by nutritional support.
