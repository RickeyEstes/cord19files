The proportions of African wild dogs from each site with evidence of exposure to each pathogen are shown in Table 1 . For all the viral pathogens (i.e., all pathogens but Babesia spp.), evidence of exposure was detected among the wild dogs in this study, although not all pathogens were detected at all sites (Table 1) . Babesia spp. DNA was not detected in any of the 154 wild dog blood samples. However, using the same method, Hepatozoon canis DNA was amplified and sequenced in 148 of these samples. No statistical analyses were conducted on these data due to insufficient variation in pathogen prevalence.
