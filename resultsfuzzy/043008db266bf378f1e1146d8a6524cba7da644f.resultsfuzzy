Despite the high sensitivities and specificities of NAAT for respiratory virus detection, false-negative results can occur due to improper specimen collection or handling. A negative result can also occur when the patient is no longer shedding detectable virus, or at least at the site of collection. For hospitalized patients with LRT disease, if no other etiology is identified and viral pneumonia is still clinically suspected, the CDC recommends collecting LRT specimens. Sequence deviations or mutations at the site of primer or probe binding are also a potential source of false-negative results. In 2015, the majority of circulating influenza virus in the United States was characterized as A/Switzerland-like H3N2 viruses with significant genetic drift, loss of vaccine protection, and reduced ability to culture in many cell lines. Indeed, matrix gene primer or probe mismatches affect the performance of some commercial NAATs [127] . On the other hand, sequence deviations in the H1 gene affected typing of A(H1N1)pdm09, leading to the serendipitous discovery of a strain of influenza A that cannot be typed. Similarly, pan-detection NAATs may not adequately detect all subtypes within a family of virus as commonly seen with commercial assays for the detection of AdV [128À130]. False-positive results, although rare, can occur (eg, due to lab contamination or other factors). A positive result indicates detection of viral nucleic acid, confirming virus infection, but does not necessarily mean the virus is the causative agent. Furthermore, patients vaccinated by intranasal administration of live attenuated influenza virus will likely test positive for 7À10 days [131] .
