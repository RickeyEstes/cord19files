Compound 1, named shengmaxinside A, was obtained as colorless needles and gave positive results for the Liebermann-Burchard reaction and Molish reagents, indicating it to be a triterpenoid glycoside. 4 .60) and a series of overlapped signals suggesting a cycloartane-type triterpene glycoside. The 13 C-NMR spectrum (Table 1) displayed a total of thirty eight carbon signals due to the aglycon moiety, along with a sugar unit and an acetyl unit. The 13 C-NMR spectrum exhibited anomeric carbons at δ C 107.5. All the above evidence suggested that 1 was a highly oxygenated 9,19-cycloartane triterpene glycoside. Moreover, δ C 112.8 suggests 1 to be a cimigenol type saponin [26] . After acid hydrolysis and derivatization as alditol acetates, the gas chromatography (GC) analysis revealed the presence of D-galacose. The presence of a galacose was further confirmed by its NMR data [16] , and the galactose linkage was assigned as β from observation of the anomeric proton coupling constant at δ H 4.89 (1H, d, J = 7.6 Hz). The residual three further signals at δ H 4.60 (1H, ddd, J = 2.0, 4.3, 9.2 Hz), 4.53 (1H, d, J = 7.6 Hz) and 3.77 (1H, d, J = 4.4 Hz) in the region of aglycon moiety suggest three additional oxygen-bearing carbons on the aglycone. This hypothesis was confirmed by the HMBC spectrum, which showed cross-peaks between proton signal at δ H 4.53 (1H, d, J = 7.6 Hz) with C-14 and C-16, C-13 and C-17, between proton signal at δ H 4.60 (1H, ddd, J = 2.0, 4.3, 9.2 Hz) with C-24 and C-22, and between proton signal at δ H 3.77 (1H, d, J = 4.4 Hz) with C-23 and C-25. This unambiguously iindicated that the oxygen-bearing carbons are C-15, C-23 and C-24. In the HMBC spectrum, significant correlations between δ H 4.89(H-1') and 88.4(C-3) suggested that the galactopyranosyl was located at the C-3 position. Furthermore, the long-range correlations between an acetyl proton (δ H 2.01) with C-25 (δ C 79.8) indicated that the acetyl unit locating at C-25. Other key long-range correlations were observed for H-19/C-19, H-1'/C-3, H-24/C-25, H-23/C-22 and C-24, and an acetyl methyl proton and an acetyl carbon and C-25. Comparison of the 13 C-NMR spectral data of 1 with those of the known compound 25 [19] showed that the aglycone of 1 was very similar to that of the known compound, except for the signals of the sugar moieties. This suggested that 1 had the same aglycone as 25-O-acetyl-7,8-didehydrocimigenol-3-O-β-D-xyloside. Thus, from the above the 1 H -1 H COSY, HSQC, DEPT and HMBC we concluded that the planar structure of 1 corresponded to Compound 2, named shengmaxinside B, was obtained as colorless needles and gave positive results for the Liebermann-Burchard reaction and Molish reagent, which was considered evidence of a triterpenoid glycoside. Its molecular formula was established as C 36 In the 13 C-NMR spectrum ( Table 1 ) a total of thirty six carbon signals due to the aglycon moiety were observed, along with a sugar unit. Compared to 1, there is no acetyl unit signal. In the meantime, only the chemical shifts of C-25, C-26 and C-27, located at δ C 68.6, 30.7, 25.9, respectively, were changed compared to 1. The comparison of the 13 C-NMR data of 2 to those of the moieties of the ether-linkage and ester-linkage sugar chains of 1 suggested that 2 possessed the same sugar chains as 1. This deduction was confirmed by the HMBC experiment. On the basis of these data, 2 was elucidated as 7, Compound 3, named shengmaxinside C, was obtained as a white amorphous powder, which was considered to be a triterpenoid glycoside due to the positive results with the Liebermann-Burchard reaction and Molish reagents. Its molecular formula was determined as C 38 H 60 O 12 (Table 1 ) showed a total of thirty eight carbon signals due to the aglycon moiety, along with a sugar unit and an acetyl unit. The 13 C-NMR spectrum exhibited anomeric carbons at δ C 107.5. All the above evidence suggested that 3 was a highly oxygenated 9,19-cycloartane triterpene glycoside. Moreover, δ C 106.7 indicated 3 to be a hydroshengmanol type saponin [26] . After acid hydrolysis and derivatization as alditol acetates, the gas chromatography (GC) analysis revealed the presence of D-galacose. This was further confirmed by its NMR data [16] , and the galactose linkage was assigned as β form on the basis of the anomeric proton coupling constant at δ
