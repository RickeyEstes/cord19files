North Americans or Europeans, isolated populations with no reported cases of MS demonstrated an initial wave of MS followed by secondary cases appearing in small epidemics (27). As the distance from the equator increases, the risk of MS increases. Migration studies demonstrate that individuals moving between high-and low-risk areas for MS carry the risk of the area from which they move, if they move a&r age 15, but acquire the risk of the area to which they move if they move before age 15 (Pig. 1) (28). These studies suggest that exposure to or repeated infections with an agent before puberty contribute to determining an individual's risk for MS. Viruses have long been suggested to be the cause of MS. Viruses have been isolated directly from MS patients, and antibodies to viruses have been detected in them; however, to date, no single virus has been identified as the causative agent (29). On the other hand, exacerbations of MS have been correlated with viral infections (30) (31) (32) (33) . Several animal models of MS are based on viral infections; for example, canine distemper virus infection of dogs, visna virus infection of sheep, and murine coronavirus and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus infection of mice (11, 29, (34) (35) (36) (37) . The presence of persistent virus infection in these animals results in demyelination with characteristic features similar to MS in humans.

Section:figure i. overview of migration studies. travelfrom a high-risk zone to a low-risk zone in the world after age is results in the individual keeping the high-riskphenoepe, whereas migration before age 15 n~~lts in the individual acquiring the risk associated with thepbce of residence.-the reverse is also true (28).
