The results above indicate that home bias exists in the relationship between air pollution and equity pricing of locally headquartered firms in the Chinese stock market. To obtain comprehensive evidence, the research sample was expanded to include the Ashares in 33 major Chinese cities. The proportion of the sample in A-shares is 55.11% and the ratio of the market value of the sample to that of all A-shares is 69.24%. Thus, the sample is sufficient for the study and verifies the "pollution effect." To examine whether air pollution could lead to risk-aversion behavior among local investors and thus influence the stock pricing of firms located in the same geographical area, seven air pollution proxies were adopted to obtain credible results. Daily stock returns, illiquidity, turnover, and volatility on air pollution were regressed where the firms were headquartered. A cross-sectional firm-specific fixed-effect estimation method was adopted after controlling for weather conditions, SAD, Monday, and month effects. Table 6 presents the results of the effects of air pollution on stock returns and adjusted returns, and Table 7 presents the effects of air pollution on illiquidity, turnover, and volatility. Model 1 to Model 7 of Table 6 show that all air pollution proxies, except for ozone, significantly and negatively influence stock returns at the 1% significance level, which is consistent with the results of Lepori (2016) and Levy and Yagil (2011) . One change in standard deviation in the AQI (57.4362 from Table 1) decreases stock returns by 0.0422% (0.000734 Ã— 57.4362), 10 which is approximately 1.1417% of one standard deviation (3.6927% from Table 1) of the stock returns. The influence of other air pollution proxies on stock returns is economically insignificant. Thus, the study confirms that a "pollution effect" exists, as proposed by Levy and Yagil (2011) , despite its negligible economic magnitude. Model 8 to Model 14 of Table 6 indicates that the adjusted returns show similar results. Table 7 reports the effects of air pollution on firm-level illiquidity, turnover, and volatility. The results indicate that air pollution increases the illiquidity of locally headquartered firms whereas it decreases firm-level turnover. Loughran and Schultz (2004) note that pessimistic moods induced by extreme weather conditions could lead to a dramatic decrease in the trading volume of local firms. Similarly, a high level of air pollution could dampen local investors' desires to trade, reducing turnover (Lepori, 2016) . Panel C conflicts with the opinion that return volatility only reflects investor disagreement (Gao et al., 2006; Shalen, 1993) , however, the panel supports the opinion that investors may trade actively when moods are increasingly positive, creating a high level of return volatility (Gervais and Odean, 2001; Nofsinger, 2005; Statman et al., 2006) . 7 The average of the AQI in Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the other 31 cities are 82.3014, 53.3072, and 90.7470, respectively. The t statistic for the difference between the AQI in Shanghai and the other 31 cities is 3.3107, and that between the AQI in Shenzhen and the other 31 cities is 14.7920. They are both significant at the 1% level. 8 The Shanghai Composite Index and Shenzhen Composite Index consist of all the stocks listed on the SSE and SZSE, respectively. 9 http://datacenter.mep.gov.cn/. 10 According to footnote 6, stock returns in the regressions are magnified 100 times, so the coefficient of the AQI is scaled by 100. The coefficients of the SAD effects positively influence local stock returns. This finding is consistent with that of Kamstra et al. (2003) , who determined that SAD effects cause significant and positive returns in markets at higher latitudes relative to those closer to the equator. Kramer and Weber (2012) determine that investors affected by SAD effects trade cautiously and carefully and prefer safe investment portfolios, unlike investors unaffected by SAD effects. The results indicate that SAD effects are negatively associated with local turnover, implying investors suffering from SAD effects may trade less, which is consistent with the findings of Kramer and Weber (2012) . Here, SAD effects reduce local illiquidity. Illiquidity is the response of price to order flow, resulting from adverse selection costs and inventory costs (Amihud and Mendelson, 1980) . Therefore, the information in the illiquidity is different from that in turnover. If investors affected by SAD effects trade more cautiously and carefully, they would obtain enough information before executing a market order, reducing information asymmetry in the market and the possibility of adverse selection and thus reducing the illiquidity. In addition, the results show that investors suffering from SAD effects would not trade actively, decreasing return volatility. Regarding weather conditions, a high cloud cover level significantly decreases the returns of locally headquartered firms, which is consistent with the results of Saunders (1993) and Hirshleifer and Shumway (2003) . Cloud cover is negatively related with turnover and volatility and positively related with illiquidity. This relation indicates that cloud cover leads to bad moods in investors, and thus, they are likely to trade much less. Cao and Wei (2005) note that people could be more both aggressive and apathetic in higher temperature conditions. Aggression reduces investor risk-taking whereas does apathy not. Therefore, the relationship between stock returns and temperature depends on competition between these two effects. Our results show that a high temperature level increases local returns, turnover and volatility, whereas it decreases illiquidity, supporting the view that aggression caused by high temperature plays a key role. Other weather variables, including visibility, humidity, wind speed and air pressure, also affect local returns and trading activities, which confirms previous studies on weather effects.
