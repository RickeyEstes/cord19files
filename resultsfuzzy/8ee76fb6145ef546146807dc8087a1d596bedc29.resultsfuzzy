3.1. Peptide array mapping of S1188HA-binding sequences To map putative self-binding sequences within the S protein, peptide array libraries of overlapping 15-to 20-residue peptides with offsets of two to four residues were derived from SARS-CoV S protein (Frank, 2002; Frank and Overwin, 1996) , synthesized on PEG-derivatized cellulous membranes, and then probed by S1188HA, a recombinant HA-tagged S protein ectodomain (aa 1-1188) that is structurally more stable than the full length S protein (Lu et al., 2008a) . S1188HA in this study was expressed in the Sf9 insect cell system, based on the observations that the Sf9 insect cell offered higher expression level of S1188HA without affecting the protein immunogenicity, receptor-binding properties or its ability to construct virus-like particles, as compared to the mammalian system (Jeffers et al., 2004; Mortola and Roy, 2004) . Peptide-retained S1188HA was then detected as dark spots on the membranes by an anti-HA chemiluminescence immunodetection (Supplementary S1 Fig.) . False-positive sequences were identified by immunoblotting the peptide-anchored membranes with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody alone or in combination with a primary anti-HA antibody, without probing the membranes with S1188HA (S2 Fig.) . Neighboring overlapping peptides that did not bind to S1188HA served as negative controls, further ensuring the specificities of the peptide-S1188HA interactions. Based on primary screening data using libraries of different peptide lengths, the 20-residue peptide library with an offset of 4 aa provided the most comprehensive hit peptide profile, and was chosen for further study. In brief, probing 310 peptides in the 20-residue library with S1188HA identified thirty-four S1188HA-binding peptides, sequences of which were located to the N-terminal region of S1, RBD, the region between S1 and S2, IFP, HR1, and the loop region connecting HRs ( Fig. 1a and Table 1 ). Additionally, these identified peptides appeared in clusters. Five clusters shared a common feature of containing three to four overlapping peptides, each yielding a consensus putative selfbinding octapeptide motif ( Fig. 1b and Table 1 ). These were the motif GINITNFR (aa 225-232) in Cluster I peptides C6-C9 derived from the region upstream to the RBD; the motif VLTPSSKR (aa 537-544) in Cluster II peptides F12-F15 derived from the region immediately following RBD; the motif LNRALSGI (aa 745-752) in Cluster III peptides H16, 18 and 19 derived from the region upstream of FP; the motif AMQMAYRF (aa 881-888) in Cluster IV peptides J2, 3 and 5 derived from IFP; and finally, the motif RLITGRLQ (aa 977-984) in Cluster V peptides K2-K5 derived from the HR1 (Table 1) . Besides the five continuous clusters of self-binding peptides, the sixth cluster R contained a cluster of eight discontinuous RBD-derived sequences that bound to S1188HA with relatively high affinities. It was also noted that no HR2-and only four HR1-derived sequences, K2, K3, K4 and K5, were identified as putative self-binding sequences from the 20-residue peptide array library. The HR regions of Class 1 viral fusion glycoproteins, including SARS-CoV S protein, are known to oligomerize into helix trimers through Leu/Ile zippers (Hakansson-McReynolds et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2004) . Accordingly, peptide GG38, encompassing the entire S protein HR2 sequence (aa 1149-1186), both oligomerized into α helix trimers and heteromerized with the HR1 peptide into the 6-HB (Bosch et al., 2004; Celigoy et al., 2011) (S3 Fig.) . The discrepancy between the known oligomerization potential of the HR sequences and their underrepresentation among self-binding peptides identified in this study may be due to that our peptide array of 20-aa length, which while well suited to identify shortsequence-mediated self-interactions (e.g. steric β-zipper), is inadequate to sustain helix-mediated interactions. This was confirmed by the diminished ability of HR2-derived peptides to pull down S1188HA, when subjected to serial C-terminal truncation (S4 Fig.) (Jiang and Lin, 1995) .
