In previous studies, coupled in vitro translation/membrane Figure 1 . In vitro translation in the absence and in the presence of microsomes. Synthetic RNAs coding for GJ proteins cd,/3~,/32,/~3, and a3 were translated in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system in the absence (-) or presence (+) of canine pancreatic micmsomes for the indicated time periods (t in minutes). Fluorographs of the translation products after SDS-PAGE are shown. Full-size polypeptides are indicated as c~1,/~t,/3z,/33, and a3. In reactions including microsomes, a second connexin-specific translation product was generated and marked as a~',/~1',/~z',/~3', and c~3' . Translation reactions showed the first detectable synthesis of full-size GJ protein after ,07 min in the presence of microsomes (shown for cq GJ protein, lane 6). The faster migrating GJ protein product is generated after the same translation time. Aggregates of GJ polypeptides not entering the separating gels were especially prominent after long reaction times and in absence of microsomes. A schematic representation of the overall membrane topology for cormexins is shown on the right. The connexins mainly differ from each other in the length of their COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The cytoplasmic and the lumenal/exoplasmic sides of translocation assays supplemented with canine pancreatic microsomes (Walter and Blobel, 1983) have been found to integrate several type I, II, and III membrane proteins with a relevant membrane topology (e.g., Lipp and Dobberstein, 1986b; Spiess and Lodish, 1986; Zerial et al., 1986; Mayer et al., 1988) . The microsomes, which are vesicles derived from the ER membranes of pancreatic acinar ceils during isolation, are believed to contain all ER lumenal and membrane proteins necessary for the successful translocation of secretory and membrane anchored proteins (Nicchitta and Blobel, 1993) . The translation of GJ proteins in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes resulted in the generation of specific translation products that were '~2-2.5 kD smaller in size than the full-size proteins generated in the absence of microsomes, based on the electrophoretic mobility shift on the protein gels (marked as a' and/~' GJ protein in the figures). The faster migrating translation products were generated with all connexin cRNAs translated in these assays (Fig. 1,   lanes 3 -10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20, and 22) . This finding was surprising because no general connexin modification has been described that could account for the observed increase in electrophoretic mobility. Endogenous ~1 GJ proteins isolated from mammalian tissues correspond in their electrophoretic mobility to the full-size translation products (compare Fig. 3 A) . Translocation reactions incubated for very short time periods always showed equivalent amounts of modified and unmodified translation products in the individual reactions, even at time periods when the translation of connexin polypeptides was still continuing (Fig. 1, lanes 3-8; shown for c~ GJ protein only). This result indicates that the processing occurred cotranslationally or, at least, in close relationship to the translocation reaction.
