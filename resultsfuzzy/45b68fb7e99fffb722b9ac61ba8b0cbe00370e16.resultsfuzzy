We collected 477 pairs of cloacal and oropharyngeal pooled samples from 2,384 birds, and 400 environmental pooled samples from 2,000 environmental sites in 40 LBMs in Chittagong and Dhaka. Each pool was composed of 5 swab specimens, except for 1 pair of cloacal and oropharyngeal pools made from 4 swab specimens collected from geese. We collected 12 pairs of cloacal and oropharyngeal pooled samples from all LBMs, except for 11 pairs from 3 LBMs. We sampled chickens in all LBMs (8-12 pairs/LBM), and waterfowl in 25 LBMs (0-4 pairs/LBM). Broilers accounted for most samples (32.1%), followed by Desi (26.6%) and Sonali (25.6%). Ducks accounted for 76% of 75 pool pairs collected from waterfowl and geese accounted for 24%. We collected 10 environmental pools in each LBM (stall areas: 4-8 pools, slaughter areas, 2-6 pools). Of 47.4% (416/877) pools considered positive for AIV, 6.5% pools were negative for the AIV matrix gene but positive for any of the H9 and H5 subtypes. The H9 subtype (63.2% positive pools) was detected more frequently than the H5 subtype (21.6%), and 12.3% of pools were positive for both subtypes and 27.4% of pools were negative for both subtypes. Although 80.0% of the LBMs had >1 A(H5) virus-positive poultry or environmental pool, 97.5% had >1 A(H9) virus-positive poultry or environmental pool. We determined the prevalence of pools that were positive for A(H5) and A(H9) viruses according to sample and LBM type (Table 1) . Approximately 33.3% of pools collected from waterfowl were positive for A(H5) virus, whereas only 5.5% of those collected from chickens were positive. In contrast, the prevalence of A(H9) virus-positive pools was higher in chickens (36.3%) than in waterfowl (18.7%). Among waterfowl, ducks (19.3%) and geese (16.7%) had a similar prevalence of A(H9) virus-positive pools, but the prevalence of A(H5) virus-positive pools was higher in ducks (36.8%) than in geese (22.2%). For both H5 and H9 subtypes, the prevalence of positive pools was higher for oropharyngeal samples (8.6% for H5 and 31.9% for H9) than for cloacal samples (3.6% and 9.9%) in all surveyed poultry types (online Technical Appendix 2 Table 1 ). Approximately 25% of environmental pools were positive for A(H9) virus, and the prevalence of positive pools was higher in slaughter areas (31.5%), especially knives and boards used for slaughter and processing, than stall areas (20.2%). The prevalence of A(H5) virus-positive environmental pools was lower (10.8%) and did not vary between slaughter and stall areas (online Technical Appendix 2 Table 2 ). Convergence was achieved for all models; the Gelman and Rubin statistic was <1.001 and the effective sample size was >10,000 for all parameters. For each AIV subtype, the best models reasonably predicted the number of positive pools (online Technical Appendix 2 Figure 1 ). In the best H5 models (i.e., lowest deviance information criterion), A(H5) virus prevalence differed according to poultry species (chicken, waterfowl), but not according to the type of environmental site. In contrast, in the best H9 models, A(H9) virus prevalence differed according to type of poultry (broiler, Desi, Sonali, waterfowl) and environmental site (slaughter and stall area). For both subtypes, LBM size and city did not improve model fit when compared with LBM type. For ease of comparison between the 2 AIV subtypes, we report LBM-level, bird-level, and environmental swab specimen-level prevalences of A(H5) and A(H9) viruses on the basis of the best H9 models with LBM type ( Tables  1, 2 ). This reporting did not affect interpretation of results, and we provide estimates obtained with more parsimonious models (online Technical Appendix 2 Tables 3-6) . LBM-level A(H5) virus prevalence was lower in retail LBMs than in mixed LBMs, and the posterior median estimate was ≈100% for mixed LBMs. However, among contaminated LBMs, levels of virus detection in birds and environmental areas did not vary between LBM types, but A(H5) virus prevalence in waterfowl was ≈6 times higher than in chickens (Figure) . The prevalence did not vary between chicken breeds or environmental areas. In contrast to that for A(H5) virus, we found that the posterior median estimate of the LBM-level A(H9) virus prevalence was ≈100% for retail and mixed LBM groups, but the level of virus detection in birds and environmental areas was higher for mixed LBMs than for retail LBMs. A(H9) virus prevalence was highest in broilers and lowest in waterfowl. The prevalence in broilers was 3.8 times as high as that in waterfowl and 1.6 times as high as that in Desi and Sonali (Figure) . The environmental swab specimen-level prevalence was ≈2 times as high for slaughter areas than for stall areas (Figure) .
