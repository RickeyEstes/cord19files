Initial rates of growth for SARS outbreaks in different parts of the world (see Fig. 2 ) are computed using the data provided by WHO (World Health Organization, 2003) Fig. 1 . A schematic representation of the flow of individuals between the different classes. The model considers two distinct susceptible classes: S 1 ; the most susceptible, and S 2 : b ðI þ qE þ lJÞ=N is the transmission rate to S 1 from E; I and J: p is a measure of reduced susceptibility to SARS in class S 2 : E is the class composed of asymptomatic, possibly infectious individuals. The class I denotes infected, symptomatic, infectious, and undiagnosed individuals. Iindividuals move into the diagnosed class J at the rate a: Individuals recover from class I at the rate g 1 and g 2 from the J class. The rate d is SARS' disease-induced mortality. The classes R and D are included to keep track of the cumulative number of diagnosed, recovered and dead individuals, respectively. The quantity C is for comparison with epidemiological statistics; it tracks the total number of diagnosed individuals. For our numerical simulations, we start with an infectious individual (not yet diagnosed, Ið0Þ ¼ 1) and crude estimates for the start of SARS outbreaks ðt 0 Þ are obtained from the formula t 0 ¼ t À ð 1 r log ðxðtÞÞÞ; which assumes initial exponential growth (r; the estimated ''model-free'' rate of growth from the time series xðtÞ of the cumulative number of SARS cases). Results for Toronto, Hong Kong, Singapore and aggregated world data are shown in Table 2 . The estimated ''world'' start of the outbreak is November 5, a date consistent with the fact that the first SARS case was detected in Guangdong, China in November (Pomfret, 2003a) . These dates are used as the starting time of the respective outbreaks.
