In both cases, a few or no SFC were detected from control samples, in which in vivo primed cells have been cultured without antigenic stimulation. Resuits obtained at the same time, using B. abortus B 19 as coated antigen for the ELISASPOT assay, showed that all these SFC were secreting specific anti-S. 


Section:cultures were performed with either fetal calf serum (fcs: a,c) or horse serum (hs: b,d); a,b: enumeration of specific spot-forming cells (sfc) by elisaspot on fixed bacteria. results were expressed as logl0 of sfc numbers per 10 6 cells initially put into culture (mean_+ sem, n = 3 ). c,d: titration of antibodies secreted into culture supernatants by elisa on whole bacteria. antibody titres represented log 3 of the sample dilution corresponding to the inflexion point of the elisa logistic curve (mean + sem, n = 3 ). bers were observed from day 10 and could represent nearly 1% of cells initially put into culture (or 3-4% of living cells tested from samples). no significant difference was observed in results, according to the kind of serum used as culture medium supplement
