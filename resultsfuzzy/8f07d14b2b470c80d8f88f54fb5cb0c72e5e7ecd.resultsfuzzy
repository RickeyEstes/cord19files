We observed an increased susceptibility of MRSA towards oxacillin in the presence of oxacillin and thioridazine compared to bacteria grown with oxacillin or thioridazine alone. Transcription of mecA was reduced with increasing concentrations of thioridazine in the presence of oxacillin compared to bacteria grown with oxacillin or thioridazine alone. Additionally, the protein level of PBP2a was reduced when bacteria were treated with the combination of oxacillin and thioridazine. Thioridazine itself did not affect the growth of MRSA or mecA and PBP2a. Conclusion: Results of the present study indicate that reversal of meticillin resistance by thioridazine in MRSA may be explained by a reduced transcription of the meticillin resistance gene, mecA, and protein level of the coding protein, PBP2a. Conclusions: Iclaprim was bactericidal in human clots against both wild type AW6 and TK-deficient AH152 strains, and was equipotent to SXT and vancomycin. Iclaprim was bacteriostatic against parent AW6 in rat clots but killed the TK-deficient mutant AH1252 in the same media. The bactericidal activity of iclaprim against MRSA in human clots, a setting mimicking the intravascular milieu, shows the potential of this drug for the treatment of MRSA infections in humans. TK-deficient mutants could also prove useful for studies of diaminopyrimidines in rodents. Objectives: Iclaprim (ICL) is a novel diaminopyrimidine within the same class as trimethoprim but with more potent broad-spectrum bactericidal activity in vitro. An intravenous formulation of ICL has just successfully completed phase III trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections and a phase II trial for hospital-and ventilator-associated pneumonia is underway. An oral form of ICL is also being evaluated in phase I trials. This current study ascertained the in vitro activity of ICL and comparators against S. pyogenes (GAS) and S. agalactiae (GBS). Methods: MIC was determined by CLSI broth microdilution methodology against 500 recent GAS primarily from respiratory infections and 44 recent GBS from predominantly wound swabs originating ICL was active against all isolates, being slightly more active against GAS than GBS, including isolates resistant to CLA or CLI. Trailing end-points were observed with SXT against about 9% of GAS producing false-resistance unless read strictly at 80% growth reduction according to CLSI methods. This potentially subjective reading procedure was not necessary with ICL. Conclusion: ICL showed excellent activity in vitro against GAS and GBS, which supports the use of iclaprim in the treatment of infections caused by these bacteria. The analytical sensitivity assay results showed that the TRC method can detect as little as 50 CFU/ml. Of the 633 clinical specimens evaluated, 22 were excluded from the evaluation (1 contaminated, 11 showed inhibition and 10 were identified as Mycobacteria Other Than Tuberculosis (MOTT)), thus a total of 552 respiratory specimens and 59 extra-pulmonary specimens were included. Overall sensitivity and specificity of TRC for pulmonary specimens was 86.8% and 96.3% respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of TRC for extrapulmonary specimens was 83.3% and 95.7% respectively. Of the 126 patients analysed, 15 patients presented and were treated for pulmonary tuberculosis. Twelve out of 15 treated patients had a positive culture and 13 out of 15 treated patients had a positive TRC. This gave a sensitivity of culture and TRC of 80% and 86.7% respectively. Specificity of culture and TRC were 100% and 93.9% respectively. A total of 86 paired samples are analysed with a median value for the Taqman assay of 5.05 log IU/mL versus a median value of 4.93 log IU/mL for the Versant b-DNA assay. In 69% of the measurements the Taqman PCR shows a higher HCV viral load than the b-DNA PCR. This is mainly for measurements in the higher viral loads, i.e. above 5log10 IU/mL. There is an excellent correlation between both assays (Spearman ranks coefficient 0.902, p < 0.01). A Bland-Altman analysis, shows a bias of 0.23 log10 IU/mL with a standard deviation of 0.45 (95% CI of −0.66 to 1.12 log10 IU/mL). Conclusion: There is an excellent correlation between the COBAS Taqman and the Versant b-DNA assay. Overall, compared to the bDNA assay, the COBAS Taqman PCR measurements are higher, mainly within the higher viral loads. figure) . Between patients with a RVR and an EVR there is a trend toward a faster response in the first phase decay but no difference in second the phase decline. Baseline viral load (below or above 800,000 IU/ml) and body weight at baseline were of no influence on viral kinetics in both the first and second phase between clinical patient groups. The results for the 62 fatal isolates (fatality rate 12%) comprised of 34 serogroup B (11%), 17 C (12%), 9 Y (17%) and 2 W-135 (8%). Characteristics that were associated with a higher mortality were age, gender, serogroup Y, serotype 14 and 15, genosubtypes P1.7,16-29,35 and P1.5-1,10-4,36−2. On the contrary were non14/non15 serotypes, the genosubtypes P1.5-1,10-8,36-2; P1.7-2,4,37 and P1.7,16,35, and reduced sensitivity for penicillin G associated with a decreased mortality. The presently discussed OMV vaccines could, based solely on the complete genosubtype, theoretically cover up to 44% of the fatal serogroup B cases and up to 100% if every variable region by itself is capable to induce protection. Alarming is however the fact that among the invasive but non-fatal ones three isolates did not express a functional PorA protein and will thereby not be covered by any PorA components in these vaccines. Our present 62 fatal respectively 474 non-fatal isolates form a welldefined basis that can be further characterised with supplementary methods and for example investigated concerning new vaccine antigens and potential pathogen-specific genes. The prevalence of the Belgian and Brazilian isolates was similar in clades A and B. Clade B contains two monophyletic groups showing geographical preference, sub-clade B1 was mainly composed of Brazilian isolates while sub-clade B2 contained 55% of the Belgian isolates and only 14% of the Brazilian ones. B2 presented the particularity of being composed of isolates that are distantly related. Multiple alignments revealed that (i) the genetic diversity is mostly generated by a high degree of sequence variation in the C repeat region and (ii) by an increase of the number of A and B repeat leading to an overall increase of the size of the M proteins. The Dn/Ds analysis showed that purifying selection drives the evolution of M. Conclusion: Despite a small number of different emm-types and consequently an apparent low diversity, the overall genetic diversity of the M proteins from the Belgian isolates was comparable to that of the Brazilian ones. The evaluation of the whole surface exposed sequence variations will shed light on the molecular mechanisms involved in virulence and host colonisation as well as the selective pressure driving the antigenic variation and evolution of the M protein. Genetic diversity of M protein among Belgian and Brazilian GAS isolates. The emm-type of each sequence is indicated next to the bar. Green and red squares indicate Brazilian and Belgian strains respectively. REA indicate a rearranged emm pattern. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method. Bootstrap value higher than 70% are shown next to the branches (500 replicates). The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used for the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method and are in units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. The rate variation among sites was modeled with a gamma distribution (shape parameter = 0.5). Thirteen clusters (A−M) were defined based on an arbitrary defined maximal genetic distance of 0.37 substitutions per site in each cluster. Clade A and B group Sof-positive and -negative emm-types respectively. Sof activity is unknown (*). The MPN229 ORF has the capacity to encode a 166-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 18.4 kDa. The amino acid sequence of this protein (Mpn SSB) is most closely related to that of the protein predicted to be encoded by the MG091 gene from Mycoplasma genitalium (61% identity). Mpn SSB was expressed in E. coli and purified to >95% homogeneity. The purified protein was found to: (i) exist primarily as dimer in solution, (ii) strongly and selectively bind single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in a divalent cation-and DNA substrate sequence-independent manner, and (iii) stimulate E. coli RecA-promoted DNA strand exchange. Conclusion: The Mpn SSB protein represents the M. pneumoniae counterpart of SSB proteins from other bacteria. The protein efficiently binds ssDNA and stimulates E. coli RecA-promoted homologous DNA recombination. As a consequence of these activities, the Mpn SSB protein may play a crucial role in DNA recombinatorial pathways in M. pneumoniae. The results from this study will pave the way for unraveling these pathways and assess their role in antigenic variation of M. pneumoniae. The three Belgian isolates originated from sputum and blood specimens of three patients hospitalised in different wards over a six-month period. The presence of ESBLs detected by double-disk diffusion tests on cloxacillin-containing plates, and PCR followed by sequencing revealed the presence of blaOXA-18 and blaOXA-20 genes. Both were chromosomally-encoded and PCR mapping revealed identical genetic environments for Pa MUS and the Belgian isolates. While most oxacillinases are integron located, blaOXA-18 lacked gene cassette specific sequences but was inserted into an aac6 Ib gene cassette. In addition, it was bracketed by two novel insertion sequences of ISCR family. It is likely that these ISs were at the origin of the blaOXA-18 gene mobilisation. Furthermore, detailed analysis of an 8.5-kb cloned genomic fragment containing blaOXA-18 gene revealed co-linearity of the blaOXA-18 gene and the integron containing blaOXA-20 gene. PFGE defined genetic relatedness between the three Belgian Pa isolates and Pa MUS strain. The recently identified OXA-18-producing Pa isolates from Tunisia were blaOXA-20-negative (but positive for either TEM-1 or SHV-1), genetically different from Pa MUS, thus suggesting that at least two OXA-18-producing Pa clones are currently spreading. Objective: Human Bocavirus (HBoV) is a newly discovered parvovirus, but its role as causative agent of respiratory disease remains unclear. The ferric yersiniabactin uptake receptor (FyuA) which is encoded on the high pathogenicity island (HPI) was found to be highly important for biofilm formation by UTI E. coli in human urine. Global gene expression profiling of UTI strain VR50 during biofilm formation in urine showed that all genes located on the HPI were significantly up-regulated; interestingly, this was the only iron acquisition system displaying up-regulation in biofilm urine growth compared with planktonic urine that was not up-regulated in planktonic urine compared with minimal medium. The fyuA gene was among the highest up-regulated of all genes, 63-fold. Furthermore, an fyuA mutant showed significant reduction in biofilm formation compared with its parent -both on polystyrene (microtitre plates) and on glass (flow chambers). In urine flow-cell chambers the mutant showed 92% less biofilm compared with the wild-type (Fig.  1) . However, when complemented in trans or supplied with extra iron the mutant regained its biofilm-forming faculty. Also, introduction of an fyuA-encoding plasmid into three UPEC strains increased biofilm formation significantly. Conclusion: Free iron is strictly limited in the human urinary tract and there is fierce competition between the host and infectious bacteria for this essential metal. UTI E. coli has highly efficient mechanisms of iron acquisition, one of which is yersiniabactin encoded on the HPI. Here we demonstrate a direct link between FyuA and biofilm formation in iron-poor environments such as human urine. We also show that the availability of iron greatly influences the UTI strains' ability to form biofilm. Objective: The high lethality of cerebral aspergillosis urgently asks for a deeper insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of this disease. Therefore we studied whether mycotoxins, especially gliotoxin, contribute to neural damage and to the inefficient immune response in cerebral aspergillosis. Furthermore we tested the putative capacity of antioxidant components to interfere with the harmful activity of gliotoxin. In 09/2007, a MDR-and carbapenem-resistant Ab was recovered from one Belgian resident transferred from Morocco with a diagnosis of pneumonia. Subsequently, over a 2 month period, similar MDR-Ab isolates were found in 6 patients (4 with pneumonia, 2 with asymptomatic throat colonisation). Five of the patients were hospitalised in the pneumology ward and 2 in the intensive care unit where the outbreak secondarily spread. All MDR-Ab clinical isolates were positive for blaOXA-23 with an ISAba4 sequence being present immediately upstream this gene. Further, 14 environmental samples obtained during the outbreak also yielded the same MDR OXA-23-producing Ab. All clinical and environmental isolates were confirmed by PFGE to be clonally related. After the implementation of reinforced infection control measures no additional MDR Ab were isolated neither from patient nor from the environment. Conclusion: Our data highlight the importance of inter-country transfer in the spread of MDR carbapenem-resistant OXA-23 producing Ab and the propensity of this opportunistic pathogen to cause major nosocomial outbreaks. Systematic screening, and implementation of additional precautions are mandatory for any patients transferred from high-risk areas. A. baumannii isolates were resistant to all b-lactamic antibiotics tested, tigecycline and colistin. The isolates involved in hospital outbreaks were mostly susceptible to aminoglicosides, being one susceptible only to amikacin and another one resistant to all antibiotics. PCR assays detected the presence of blaOXA-23. ISAba1 was detected upstream of the OXA-23 gene for all isolates except one. PFGE showed that the isolates' profile was related with the imipenem-resistant A. baumannii clones disseminated throughout the country, including the endemic OXA-40 producing A. baumannii clone. Conclusions: Emergence of OXA-23 producing A. baumannii is occurring in several Portuguese hospitals associated to outbreaks and sporadic cases. Of interest is the relatdness with the endemic OXA-40 clone, although with an enlarged resistance profile, which supports the plasmidic acquisition of these two oxacillinases by a well adapted A. baumannii clone. It is of note the recovery of an OXA-23 producer from an ambulatory patient which can further promote community dissemination. Objectives: Up-regulation of the RND-type efflux system AdeABC has been implicated in reduced susceptibility to tigecycline in A. baumannii. AdeABC expression is controlled by the two-component regulatory system AdeRS. We investigated the role of this pump in the emergence of tigecycline resistance using a pre-and post-treatment pair of clinical isolates. Methods: Isolates were identified by API20NE profile, and susceptibilities were first determined by BSAC disc methodology, then by agar dilution and Etest on IsoSensitest agar. PFGE was used to determine relatedness. Expression of the efflux pump, AdeABC, and its regulatory proteins, AdeRS, was examined by real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR using primers specific for adeB and adeR, respectively, and quantified relative to the RNA polymerase beta subunit gene, rpoB, which was used as a reference. The two A. baumannii isolates were recovered from abdominal drain fluid of a 38-yr old woman who had undergone a cholecystectomy. Inter alia she had received a 14-day course of tigecycline, and a 32fold difference in susceptibility was observed between pre-and posttreatment isolates (MICs, 0.5 mg/L and 16 mg/L, respectively). The patient has since made a full recovery. The isolates had identical PFGE profiles and belonged to a prevalent UK strain, OXA-23 clone 1, with OXA-23 carbapenemase and initial susceptibility only to tigecycline and polymyxin. Real-time RT-PCR identified a 24-fold increase in adeB gene expression in the post-treatment isolate. No concomitant difference in adeR expression was observed. Conclusions: OXA-23 clone 1 is a widespread multi-resistant lineage and we report here the emergence of resistance to tigecycline during therapy in a representative. This resistance was associated with increased expression of the AdeABC efflux system, but not with altered expression of its known regulatory genes adeRS. This suggests that there may be 'cross-talk' between adeABC and other trans-acting regulatory factors. Objective: In 2003, a significant increase of Acinetobacter resistance to carbapenems has been noted in the Czech Republic. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and epidemiology of this resistance among hospital strains of Acinetobacter spp. Methods: Isolates were collected prospectively via a network of diagnostic laboratories between January 2005 and April 2006. The laboratories were asked to send clinical isolates of Acinetobacter spp. from intensive care units (ICUs), with no more than one isolate per patient and 10 isolates per ICU. The isolates were identified to species by AFLP and assessed for relatedness using AFLP and PFGE. Susceptibility to 12 antimicrobial agents primarily effective against A. baumannii was tested by disk diffusion, and MICs were determined for carbapenems. Results: A total of 150 Acinetobacter isolates were obtained from 56 ICUs of 20 hospitals in 15 cities. They were identified as A. baumannii (n = 108), genomic sp. 3 (n = 30), genomic sp. 13 TU (n = 8) or other species (n = 4). Using AFLP cluster analysis, A. baumannii isolates were allocated to EU clone II (n = 66), EU clone I (n = 5), 6 clusters with 2−5 isolates (n = 15) or 22 unique genotypes. Nearly all clone II isolates yielded identical or highly similar PFGE and AFLP patterns. A total of 24 (16%) isolates were resistant to at least one carbapenem. Seventy isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobials while 7 isolates showed resistance to 1−3 agents and 73 isolates were resistant to >3 agents. Resistance to >3 agents and/or carbapenem MICs >1 mg/l were found only in the EU clones and four unique strains while resistance to one or two carbapenems (MIC >8 mg/l) was confined to EU clone II. The 66 EU clone II isolates originated from 37 ICUs in 12 cities and showed the following susceptibility rates: piperacillin (0%), ceftazidime (5%), ampicillin-sulbactam (23%), imipenem (71%), meropenem (67%), gentamicin (15%), tobramycin (97%), amikacin (61%), netilmicin (52%), ofloxacin (0%), doxycycline (0%), co-trimoxazole (12%). In only 47% of the 187 presumptively diagnosed TB cases was M. tuberculosis cultured. In 19% exclusively NTM were found. In another 12% of the presumptive cases, a combination of M. tuberculosis and NTM was isolated. In the remaining 29% of cases in which TB was diagnosed, no mycobacteria were cultivable. HIV positivity was significantly correlated with the isolation of NTM from sputum and inversely associated with the isolation of exclusively M. tuberculosis (p < 0.05). In pneumococcal broth culture, rifampicin pretreatment for only 30 minutes significantly reduced the ceftriaxone-induced release of pneumolysin and bacterial DNA. Likewise, in vivo, rifampicin pretreatment for 1 hour followed by the addition of ceftriaxone significantly reduced markers of neuroinflammation in the CSF, i.e. prostaglandin E2 and total protein 2 hours after initiation of antibiotic therapy. Reduced inflammation resulted in a significantly reduced density of apoptotic neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus compared to animals treated with ceftriaxone alone. The combined antibiotic treatment resulted in a slight decrease in the speed of bacterial killing, but was nevertheless rapidly bactericidal. The mean MIC for ciprofloxacin increased as a simple function of the number of resistance mutations in the isogenic strains. As expected, mean relative fitness decreased as a function of addition of the first three resistance mutations (1; 0.95; 0.89; 0.8). However, the downward trend was reversed by the addition of 4th and 5th mutations (0.8; 0.87; 0.9). We identified 6 strains in which an additional resistance mutation increased both resistance and fitness. These strains were deconstructed and reconstructed to confirm the relationship between the resistance mutations present and the resulting fitness/resistance phenotype. We also evolved strains for increased fitness in the absence of drug and observed the selection of variants with decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. Conclusions: Bacteria can use different strategies to minimize the fitness costs of the genetic alterations selected for drug resistance. Two of these are well documented: the selection of low-cost mutations, and the selection of additional fitness compensating mutations. Here we identify a third strategy that reduces the fitness costs of resistance to fluoroquinolones: particular resistance mutations, when in combination, increase both resistance level and bacterial fitness. This relationship between drug-resistance mutations and improved bacterial fitness could be one force driving the evolution of fluoroquinolone resistance. An important implication is that strains carrying low level resistance mutations could evolve by Darwinian selection to higher levels of resistance, in the absence of direct selection by the drug.  The competition assay between REL606 (ara−) and REL607(ara+) wild-type strains did not yielded difference in fitness (W=1.03±0.01 by plates and 1.03±0.05 by RT-PCR). REL606 rif-R(S531F) strain grew 25% and 33% slower than REL607 by plates and RT-PCR respectively (W=0.75±0.13 vs 0.67±0.06). On the other hand REL607 strain grew 71% (plates) or 74% (RT-PCR) slower than REL606 (W=0.29±0.04 vs 0.26±0.02). Finally, the competition experiments between REL607 rif-R(L533P) and REL606 rif-R(S531F) showed 83% (W=0.17±0.08) and 69% (W=0.31±0.05) by plates and RT-PCR respectively. Concluison: Similar values of W were found using the classical method or the new protocol based in RT-PCR. We proposed the use of RT-PCR technology to estimate the fitness cost, because presents several advantages respect to the traditional one: i) the huge manipulation of lots of plates is completely reduced, ii) it is possible to carry out more than one experiment at the same time and iii) it is possible to specifically detect a strain inside an heterogeneous population. We show that for both types of control sample it is beneficial to analyse spots in separate classes according to their expected control channel signal (0.05−0.15 AUC increase). The use of a mix control leads to higher accuracies (0.05 increase). This best performance is due to gains in sensitivity (0.21 increase, p = 0.001) that compensate minor losses in specificity (0.05 decrease, p = 0.014). Moreover, the use of a single strain control increases the error rate in genes that are not present in all reference strains, the set of genes where more variation across unsequenced strains is expected. The ESBL chip was validated using 60 clinical samples taken over one year in the clinical routine of different Gram-negative organisms (phenotypically characterised as ESBL). The detected variants included TEM-1, SHV-1, SHV-5, SHV-12, CTX-M3, CTX-M9, CTX-M14 and CTX-M15. Analytically difficult samples were correctly identified such as mixed resistances of various genotypes. All ESBL phenotypes could be ascribed to the presence of a CTX-M variant (78%) or SHV variant (22%), whereas no ESBL TEM variant was found. As the total assay could be performed in 4h. It was shown that the T-RFLP method produces consistent, reproducible profiles. The patient samples showed little to no intrapatient varation in T-RFLP profile compared to interpatient variation. In ELISA test antibody titer HSA-L7/L12 fusion protein group was high. In LTT test the differnce of SI in HSA-L7/L12 compared with HSA and PBS was significant (p 0.002). Bacterial count of spleen in goup 1 was decreased and the difference of bacterial count of spleen in goup 1 with groups 3 and 4 was significant (P 0.005). The elicited cellular and humoral immune response was evaluated using IFN-g ELISpot and sub-class specific antibody ELISA. Immunised mice showed titre increases of specific IgG in their serum as well as IgA antibodies in vaginal wash and an increase in IFN-g secreting T-cells specific for the recombinant vaccine proteins. In the challenge model of peritonitis a significant reduction of bacterial load could be achieved in immunised mice. Conclusion: Subfragment vaccines containing multiple epitopes are effective against ExPEC in the mouse model. Further research has to be done to evaluate the potential of this approach in humans. The average proportion of outpatient parenteral antibiotic treatment in 20 (total use data for Greece, Bulgaria and Iceland) European countries in 2005 is 1.77%, ranging from 12.33% in Russia to 0.01% in Czech Republic (see figure) , while the total outpatient use ranges from 28.94 DID in France (34.73 DID in Greece is total use) to in Russia 9.16 DID. The three most commonly used antibiotic groups for parenteral treatment are the cephalosporins (J01D; 43.36%, from 73.68% in Finland to 0% in Norway), the penicillins (J01C; 24.44%, from 74.49% in Hungary to 0% in Norway) and the aminoglycosides (J01G; 13.81%, from 75.28% in Norway to 0% in Estonia). The three most commonly used antibiotic substances for parenteral treatment are cefazolin (J01DB04; 12.02%, from 35.89% in Russia to 0% in more than one country), ceftriaxone (J01DD04; 10.89%, from 50.04% in France to 0% in more than one country) and cefuroxime (J01DC02; 7.32%, from 48.35% in Poland to 0% in more than one country). Conclusion: Outpatient parenteral antibiotic treatment only represents more than 1% of the total outpatient antibiotic use in 6 out of the 20 European countries studied. However, as for the total outpatient antibiotic use and the use of different antibiotic groups and substances, there is a striking variation in the proportions of parenteral antibiotic use in Europe as well. More in-depth data on outpatient antibiotic use are needed to explain this variation.  The intervention was associated with a significant and sustainable decrease in the use of 3GC. Use decreased from 178.9 before to 68.7 DDD/1000 pd. The intervention resulted in a mean estimated reduction of total antibiotic use of −375.0 DDD/1000 pd, which is equivalent to a 27% reduction. Total antibiotic use showed no significant month to month change before and after the intervention. Piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam showed a significant increase in level of 64.4 DDD/1000 pd and continued to increase by 2.3 DDD/1000 pd per month after the intervention. The intervention was not associated with a significant quarterly change in the RD of K. pneumoniae and E. coli resistant to 3GC. In contrast, the reduced use of 3GC and the switch to piperacillin was followed by a continuous increase in the RD of E. coli resistant to piperacillin by 0.5 per 1000 pd per quarter and by a continuous decrease of P. aeruginosa resistant to piperacillin of 0.1 per quarter. The values of fifty percent inhibiting concentration (IC50) obtained in MDCK were 0.03 (±0.005) microM for low-molecular hemagglutinin inhibitor and 0.1 (±0.01) microM for high-molecular hemagglutinin inhibitor. Intranasal administration of 0.25 mg/kg lowmolecular inhibitor or 1.25 mg/kg polymeric inhibitor completely protected mice from influenza virus A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) infection. Electron microscope study of the virion morphology showed direct damage of influenza virus particles by low-and high-molecular compounds, and allowed us to propose mechanism of virucidal action of hemagglutinin inhibitors. Conclusion: These data show significant antiviral effect of low-and high-molecular hemagglutinin inhibitors on influenza viruses at low micromolar concentration. Although we do not consider high-molecular hemagglutinin inhibitor as candidate anti-influenza drug due to the probable toxicity and limited biocompatibility of polymer, low-molecular hemagglutinin inhibitor has potential for the prevention of influenza virus infection as specific virucidal therapeutic. Ticked off: lyme borrelliosis O491 Detection of Borrelia bissettii in the South Bohemia region of the Czech Republic: cases of single and multiple infections in humans N. Rudenko, M. Golovchenko, N. Piskunova, D. Ruzek, L. Grubhoffer (Ceske Budejovice, CZ) Twelve serum samples from patients with symptomatic borreliosis and 1 sample (cardiac valve tissue) from patient with endocarditis and cardial stenosis associated with chronic borrelial infection were collected in the hospital of Ceske Budejovice (CZ). Serological tests gave the negative results in all cases. The goal of our project was to analyse the samples of the human origin with molecular techniques. The serums and a cardiac valve tissue were used for direct DNA purification. The flagellin gene was chosen as a target for analysis. The PCR primer set for amplification of fla gene from Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bb SL) complex was used. The direct sequence of amplicon indicated the presence of different sequences. The cloning step allowed the separation of them. Ninety six recombinants from each sample were sequenced. In silico RFLP analysis with 5 restriction endonucleases was conducted. "Virtual" hybridisation with the probes designed for the detection of Bb SL and specie-specific probes were used. The Maximum Parsimony heuristic search was performed in PAUP by implementing the treebisection-reconnection algorithm. Alignment was 488 characters long, 53 of them were parsimony informative. All 13 recognised species of Bb SL complex were used as controls. As results, 4 cases were confirmed to carry B. burgdorferi ss, 4 -B. bissettii, 1 -B. garinii, and 4 -multiple spirochete specie. From the 4 co-infected samples 3 were defined as double infection with B. burgdorferi ss and B. bissettii and 1 as a triple infection with B. bissettii, B. burgdorferi ss, and B. garinii. The identity of each species was confirmed by similarity search using the GenBank, RFLP pattern, virtual hybridisation and PAUP. Until recently it was thought that only 3 genospecies, firmly established and well accepted, might cause Lyme disease (LD), i.e. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii, and B. garinii. However, few other genospecies have also been connected to LD or were isolated from humans with LD symptoms. They are B. bissettii and B. spielmanii. After the first isolation of B. bissettii from the 9 samples of human origin in Slovenia, our results are the second evidence of involvement of B. bissettii in LD in Europe. The presence of B. bissettii as a single strain in humans with symptomatic borreliosis or chronic borrelial infection is the strong support of the fact that B. bissettii is not only the member of the LD complex, but is a causative agent of the disease. The presence of borrelial IgM antibodies in patients sera was ascertained in 1/249 (0.4%), 15/249 (6%), and 9/249 (3.6%) with IFA, ELISA and LIAISON ® , respectively. The presence of IgG antibodies was established in 31/249 (12.4%), 64/249 (25.7%), and 82/249 (32.9%) with IFA, ELISA, and LIAISON ® , respectively. Community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection S111 All three tests gave concordant results in 221/249 (88.8%) and 143/249 (57.4%) for IgM and IgG antibodies, respectively. Conclusion: For detection of borrelial IgM antibodies ELISA was found to be more sensitive than the other two tests, while LIAISON ® was found to be more sensitive test for detection of IgG antibodies. Differences in sensitivities of the three tests could be the result of different antigens and/or distinct method utilised for antibody detection. Discrepancies in findings obtained on identical sera strongly indicate the need for standardisation of the serological methods for detection of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato infection. i. Decline in IgG antibodies against VlsE was observed more often in patients with good outcome than in patients with poor outcome. The decline was observed more often in patients with LNB than in patients with LA. ii. Decline in IgG antibodies against OspC was observed more often in patients with good outcome compared with patients with poor outcome. As with VlsE, decline in OspC IgG antibodies was observed more often in patients with LNB than with LA. The reproducibility of the Raman procedure is high. Multiple measurements of the same set of isolates resulted in isolate-specific clusters. Using a well-characterised strain collection, we found that the discriminatory power (D=0.98) is comparable to that of the gold standard, PFGE (D=0.99−1). Conclusion: Using Raman spectroscopy as a typing method, a significant decrease of turn-around time can be achieved, allowing interventions to limit transmission to be taken earlier. The typing information gathered with this technique is comparable to information obtained by genotyping methods. Therefore we conclude that Raman spectroscopy is an easy-touse and rapid alternative in the battle against MRSA. of HBV infection prior to initiation of ART should not be omitted in resource-limited settings. in 1997-1999 , at the initiation of a protease inhibitorcontaining antiretroviral regimen. All severe clinical events (grade 3 or 4 events according the ANRS classification, hospitalisation, extension of hospitalisation or death) were reviewed by a validation committee. Risk factors for NANHR severe clinical events were analysed using multivariate Cox models with CD4 and plasma HIV RNA viral load (pVL) as time-dependent covariates. Results: After a median follow-up of 88 months (7664 patientyears), 713 NANHR severe clinical events were recorded in 385 patients. Incidence of NANHR severe clinical events was higher than AIDS-related events one, 9.3/100 patient-years and 2.0/100 patientyears, respectively. Most frequent NANHR severe clinical events were bacterial infections (n = 196, 27%), cancer-related events (n = 68, 9.5%), cardiovascular (n = 68, 9.5%) and psychiatric events (n = 61, 8.5%). In the adjusted multivariate analysis, occurrence of a first NANHR severe clinical event was significantly more frequent in patients older than 60 years (hazard ratio [HR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3−3.2), coinfected with HCV (HR 1.7; 95% CI 1.4−2.1), a CD4 <100 cells/mm3 at the time of the event (HR 2.5; 95% CI 1.8−3.6) and a pVL > 4 log10 copies/mL at the time of the event (HR 1.9; 95% CI 1.5−2.5). Factors associated with bacterial infections were similar to those associated with all types of NANHR severe clinical events, and the risk (HR) increased with the level of virological failure: 2.48 (95% CI 1.48−4.17) for pVL >4 log10 and <5 log10 copies/mL and 4.08 (95% CI, 2.28−7.36) for pVL > 5 log10 copies/ml. The only factor associated with non-AIDS cancers was age (HR 2; 95% CI 1.6−2.6) but a CD4 >500 cells/mm3 at the time of the event tended to have a protective effect (HR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3−1; p = 0.06). Conclusions: We recorded a high incidence of NANHR severe clinical events (4 fold than that of HIV-defining events) in our patient population. Virological failure may favour the occurrence of NANHR severe clinical events and especially bacterial infections. These results give further arguments against interruptions of antiretroviral treatment. Objectives: We aimed to characterise the genetic diversity in integrase (IN) region of HIV-1 circulating in Estonia and to compare their genetic diversity with that of B-subtype viruses in ARV treatment naive (ARV-TN) and experienced (TE) patients. Methods: A total of 104 ARV-TN (median age 26 y; 57 male; 59 IDU) and 10 TE but none treated with integrase inhibitors (INI) were analysed. All viruses in the latter population had at least one primary RT DRM with the average number of 2.8. The most commonly seen mutations were K103N (n = 9), M184V (n = 7) and V179E (n = 5). A direct sequencing of plasma viral RNA for both populations was performed in IN region (aa 1-289). Subtyping was carried out using phylogenetic analysis (neighbor-joining). The functional positions and the prevalence of reported INI resistance mutations (A38K, H51Y, T66I, V72I,   L74IMA, V75I, E92QD, T97A, F121NY, T125KY, A128T, E138K,  G140AS, Y143HCR, Q146KR, S147G, Q148H, V151I, S153AY, M154I,  N155HS, K156N, E157Q, K160D, G163KR, V165I, V201I, I203M,  T206S, A. Noguera, C. Fortuny, L. Duran, L. Alsina, G. Claret, E. Sánchez (Esplugues, Barcelona, ES) Objective: HAART-related long-term toxicities are being increasingly reported in perinatally-HIV-infected children, including hyperlactataemia, dyslipaemias, and hepatic and bone marrow toxicity. Planned interruptions of HAART (PIH) arise with the potential to reduce drug exposure and toxicity. Methods: We present a case series of 14 perinatally-HIV-infected paediatric patients (10 girls, median age 7.7 years at PIH) with optimal long-term response to a first-line HAART regimen who underwent a single PIH. Hemoglobin, total neutrophil counts, lactate levels, triglycerides, total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase and amylase plasmatic levels were assessed at PIH and 12 months later, while off therapy. Non-parametric tests were used as appropriate. Results: At PIH, patients had remained a median time of 4.8 and 4.5 years on therapy (5 out of 14 on a protease inhibitor-based regimen) and with complete suppression of viral replication, respectively. One month after treatment interruption, a blip in HIV plasmatic viral load up to a median value of 4.6 log copies/mL (range 2.9−5.6) was observed in all cases; HIV viral load stabilised thereafter. No clinical progression occured, despite a progressive decrease in CD4 cell percentages/counts was observed in most cases. None of the patients had to reinitiate therapy during the 12-month follow-up. One year after PIH, decreases in total cholesterol (median values, from 163 to 134 mg/dL; Wilcoxon rank test, p = 0.03), LDL cholesterol (from 90 to 77 mg/dL, p = 0.064), HDL cholesterol (from 60 to 43 mg/dL, p = 0.002) and lactate levels (from 1.3 to 0.9 mmol/L, p = 0.026) were observed. No changes were observed in the rest of studied parameters. All variables remained within normal/acceptables values at both time-points. None of the patients showed symptoms consistent with hyperlactataemia, hepatitis or pancreatitis, neither while on HAART nor during PIH. Conclusions: In this series, a 12-month PIH lead to a significant decrease in total and HDL cholesterol, and lactate levels. However, all parameters remained within normal values at baseline and after PIH, and no clinical symptoms were observed. The long-term clinical consequences of HAART-related toxicities in perinatally-HIV-infected paediatric patients remain unknown, as well as the potential benefit of HAART-sparing strategies.
