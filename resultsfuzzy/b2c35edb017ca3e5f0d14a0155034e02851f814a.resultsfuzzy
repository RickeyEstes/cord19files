The 200 compounds were divided into 7 groups based on the structure similarity. Their free energy of binding of 200 compounds to both H3N2 and 2009-H1N1 M2 channel proteins at two positions, namely inside and outside the M2 channel, is shown in the Table 2 . The selection of top binding compounds was mostly based on choosing the common compounds in both positions which have the lowest free energy of binding with the 2009-H1N1 M2 channel protein. In comparison with amantadine and rimantadine, the top 10 compounds were ranked based on the lowest free energy of binding obtained from docking which indicates a better binding affinity. Two groups were selected from the lowest energy of binding from virtual screening inside and outside the M2 channel proteins, respectively. Table 3 shows that the affinity of M2 drug candidates binding inside the channel is much higher than binding outside the M2 channel proteins. The group inside the channel generally binds with high affinity through hydrophobic interactions inside the M2 channel proteins, specifically to hydrophobic residues Ile33, Val27, Ala30. In particular, for compound I9, a high possibility of forming hydrogen bonds was predicted for the amino group of I9 and two residues Gly34 or Ile34, whereas the methyl groups interact with the hydrophobic part of the M2 channel proteins (Ala30 and Ile33). Subsequently, I9, with high affinity, was selected for further pharmacophore analysis of the top hits' M2 protein-inhibitor interactions. Besides, the group binding on the outside channel basically binds with lower affinity through hydrogen bonds with Asp44 in every compound in either of the M2 protein types, and some hydrophobic interactions with Arg45, Leu46, Phe47 and Phe48. Interestingly, both compounds I5 and I9 are identical to O9 and O3 respectively (cf. Table 2 ). Therefore, these two compounds were selected to be top hits for either the inside or outside binding M2 channel proteins for further pharmacophore analysis of specific drug target-protein interactions. Moreover, the free energy of binding of the top 10 compounds binding inside and outside the M2 channel proteins was compared in detail (cf. Figure 3) .
