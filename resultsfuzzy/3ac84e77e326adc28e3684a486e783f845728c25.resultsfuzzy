A total of five samples from emaciated pigs on farms were found to be positive for PCV2 (Fig. 6) , three of which were from the same farm. The other two cases came from two other different farms and all positive cases came from Wakiso district (Fig. 6 ). The positive lymph node samples (5 in number) to PCV2 on PCR and those with highly suspicious on H&E were processed using immunohistochemical techniques. In total, lymph nodes from 5 animals were positive to PCV2 antigens on IHC and these were the same positive animals on PCR analysis. Positive result was shown by brown deposits of the substrate chromogen in the affected cells (Fig. 7) .
