• NO is a known antioxidant, which provides a protective function against ROS action by quenching • O 2 − . We hypothesized that reduced • NO availability may contribute to the increased oxidative stress in ACE2 -/y mice. Indeed, evaluation of lipid peroxidation, which is an indicator of oxidative stress, revealed a significant increase in the levels of the TBARS, malondialdehyde (MDA), in plasma, urine, and aorta of ACE2 -/y mice (Fig 4A-4C) . Also direct measurement of the • O 2 release in the aorta showed an elevation in oxidative stress in ACE2 -/y mice in comparison to WT animals ( Fig 4D) . However, ACE2 deletion did not affect aortic concentrations of H 2 O 2 (Fig 4E) , a • O 2 dismutation product generated by superoxide dismutase (SOD). Analysis of enzymes involved in ROS metabolism showed a significant decrease in both total SOD and catalase activity in aorta of ACE2 -/y mice (Fig 4F and 4I , respectively). Concurrently, the mRNA levels of SOD1 (Fig 4G) , but not SOD2 ( Fig 4H) and catalase ( Fig 4J) were lower in ACE2 -/y than in WT mice. Interestingly, under similar experimental conditions, the aortic glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in ACE2 -/y mice was~2-fold higher than that of WT animals (Fig 4K) . Since enhanced oxidative stress was observed in aorta of ACE2 -/y mice, we analyzed the expression of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), an inner-mitochondrial key regulator of intracellular ROS, by real-time PCR analysis using total RNA from aorta tissue. ACE2 deletion induced a significant decrease in UCP2 mRNA levels (Fig 4M) , compared with the control animals. In contrast, the expression of other isoforms of UCP, UCP1 and UCP3, were not changed (Fig 4L-4N) . Together, these results suggest that oxidative stress observed in ACE2 -/y mice is mainly caused by inefficient antioxidation and scavenging of ROS.
