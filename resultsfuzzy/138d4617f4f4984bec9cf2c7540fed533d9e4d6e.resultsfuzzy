The initial dataset provided low-resolution information but was a useful platform to evaluate the proposed system. Further development to enable export of higher resolution data required the design of routines that would adhere to an alternative HIPAA de-identification 155 strategy, namely, the Expert Determination approach, which requires a risk assessment demonstrating that the chance of re-identifying an individual is sufficiently small [60, 61] . The Expert Determination process identified and made recommendations for fields that could facilitate disclosure of PHI. A summary of the Expert Determination results detailing the risk of Trend data in regard to replicability, availability and distinguishability is shown in Methods, 160 Table 2 . Because the Expert Determination study established that no PHI will be disclosed by the Trend data export algorithm, Data Use Agreements (DUA), rather than Business Associates Agreements (BAA, see Methods for the difference between a DUA and a BAA) were executed 165 with each of the collaborating institutions (listed in Table 3 ). The DUAs define for the clinical laboratory how BioFire will manage and make use of the Trend data. The Trend client software residing on the FilmArray computer queries the FilmArray test result local database and exports the results to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) database (see Methods). The Trend client software performs de-identification on the FilmArray computer prior to export as detailed in 170 Table 2 . Health care providers are granted access to their institutions' Trend data by the Laboratory Director. Since web access to view the data is restricted to the local site, deidentification of geographic indicators is not required. However, in implementation of the public Trend website, which presents the national syndromic test surveillance (Figure 1 ), we have further aggregated the data with respect to geographic origin and obfuscated the date of the test 8 (see Methods). Since only de-identified data are exported from the clinical institutions, no PHI is sent to or stored on the cloud server. All sites submitted the Trend project for review by their local Institutional Review Board (IRB); all but one of the 20 IRBs deemed the project "exempt" because of the absence of PHI export. 180 Thus the security requirements for the database and the controls necessary for storage and transport of de-identified data are significantly reduced. The detection counts and pathogen detection rates derived from the Trend data set for each 225 organism in the FilmArray RP are shown in Figure 2 . Other views of these data, including The pathogens' seasonal variability measured by percent detection can be classified into at least three groups. Group 1: The majority of organisms follow the classical "respiratory" season 240 (October through March) and increase by more than 10-fold above their baseline detection rate ( Figure 2C ). These include the CoVs, Flu A, Flu B, hMPV, the PIVs, and RSV (PIV3 is a slight exception to this rule in that it peaks in the summer months, and has a winter peak that is only detected regionally (data not shown)). Within this group, all but five viruses demonstrate significant biennial fluctuations; Flu B, hMPV, OC43, and PIV3 and RSV experience relatively 245 consistent annual peaks. Group 2: HRV/EV is in a class by itself in that it is detected in a high percentage of tests over time, (minimum of 10% in winter) and experiences moderate peaks of two to three fold outside the respiratory season baseline, in the early fall and spring ( Figure 2D ).

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/157156 doi: bioRxiv preprint Trend data have high temporal, spatial, and organism-specific resolution. These three properties allow for a novel evaluation of co-detections. The observed rates of co-detections should be influenced by the number of circulating pathogens detected by the FilmArray RP test at a particular site. Figure 5A shows the average number of unique organisms detected at each site in a given week (see Methods: Calculation of co-detection rates). This number fluctuates from a 295 summer low of four to a winter high of 11 pathogens. Figure 5B (grey bars) shows that the total rate of organism co-detections in the Trend dataset fluctuates annually with peak rates occurring in the winter months. The average rates have been as high as 12% in the winter of 2016 and as low as 2% in the summer of 2014. 300 From the Trend data, a Measure of Interspecific Encounter (MIE) can be calculated as the probability of a co-detection, weighted by the prevalence of each circulating pathogen at a site. Although the value of the MIE metric is higher than the actual co-detection rate it correlates well All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
