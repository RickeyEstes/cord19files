In the initial search 1121 titles were identified. Duplicates, book chapters, theses, and results that were clearly irrelevant were eliminated. The remaining 815 titles/abstracts were then examined closely for potential inclusion according to pre-set criteria, which left 88 papers deemed eligible to be subjected to systematic evaluation (Berman & Parker, 2002) . Of these, 16 papers were reviews, 19 were letters or editorials, 24 were studies without appropriate control group, two were case reports, seven were opinion based papers, two papers were focused on characteristics of critical events, four were about interventions, one was a theoretical paper, and one article could not be obtained, even after several attempts. Another paper was excluded because additional data could not be obtained from the author. Two studies reported on the same data, so the paper with the most complete and relevant information was selected. Consequently, 10 articles remained from the initial search for meta-analysis. None of the topics of the 16 reviews identified was similar to that of the intended meta-analysis: eight were evaluations of interventions, four were reviews about workplace violence, two were book (chapter) reviews, and two were about patients and not about health professionals. Fifty-seven titles were identified from the reference lists. Further examination revealed that: 23 of these were duplicates, and 33 did not meet inclusion criteria; consequently, one additional article remained. Finally, 11 studies reporting on the relationship between critical incidents and post-traumatic stress symptoms (Ntotal ¼ 3866; range of N ¼ 92e934; Fig. 1 ) were considered eligible for inclusion (Chan & Huak, 2004; Chen, Wu, Yang, & Yen, 2005; Kerasiotis & Motta, 2004; Lin et al., 2007; Luce, Firth-Cozens, Midgley, & Burges, 2002; Maunder, Lancee, Balderson, Bennett, Borgundvaag, Evans et al., 2006; McAlonan, Lee, Cheung, Cheung, Tsang, Sham et al., 2007; Mealer, Shelton, Berg, Rothbaum, & Moss, 2007; Styra et al., 2008; Su, Lien, Yang, Su, Wang, Tsai et al., 2007; Weiniger et al., 2006) ; 6 of these studies (Ntotal ¼ 1695) also reported on the secondary outcomes, anxiety and depression (Chan & Huak, 2004; Chen et al., 2005; Kerasiotis & Motta, 2004; McAlonan et al., 2007; Mealer et al., 2007; Su et al., 2007) .
