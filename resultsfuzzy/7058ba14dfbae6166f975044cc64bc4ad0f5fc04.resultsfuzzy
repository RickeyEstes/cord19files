Flu-IVDs are classified as class 1 medical devices, indicating that the license could be easily obtained through document reviews. Therefore, the quality of Flu-IVDs needs to be investigated and monitored. In Taiwan, suspected influenza patients are immediately tested with Flu-IVDs at the primary screening site in epidemics areas. The therapeutic strategies are divided into two parts based on the test results. If the test result is positive and the patient exhibits influenza-like symptoms, the patient is immediately administered antiviral drugs such as osletamivir (Tamiflu) and continuously monitored with Flu PCR test kits. However, negative test results indicate that the patient only has a common cold, and no antiviral drug treatment is given. The use of Flu-IVDs plays a crucial role in controlling influenza epidemics. Hence, falsepositive outcomes may cause inappropriate administration of osletamivir, which could lead to future challenges in the prevention of influenza. Prior to 2009, several commercial Flu-IVD rapid test kits were approved in Taiwan. However, after the influenza A/H1N1 pandemics in 2009, the Taiwan FDA issued many licenses for similar products. We thus aimed to examine the analytical sensitivity and specificity of Flu A-IVDs used in Taiwan.
