Of the 12 fecal samples tested, five (one wisent, two Himalayan tahr, one sitatunga, and one nyala) were positive for CoV. Five fecal samples were used for virus isolation and sequencing. All of the S genes sequenced contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 4092 nucleotides, encoding a predicted protein of 1363 amino acid (aa) residues and molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa. Sequence analysis of the five identified strains showed a 99.9% amino acid identity and a genetic relatedness of 99.4-99.5% to two other Korean isolates, BcoV-0501 and BcoV-0502. Thus, the most recent isolates, BcoV-0501 and BcoV-0502 (identified in 2005), had the highest nucleotide identity with the five bovine-like CoVs, whereas they showed only 97.8-97.9% identities with the BC94/1994 (DQ389641) and Sun5/ 1994 (DQ389657) strains. In total, 86 nucleotide substitutions were found compared to the Mebus strain, but no insertions or deletions were detected in any sequence. Also, 34 substitutions were found in the complete aa sequence of the viral glycoprotein S. A phylogenetic analysis using reference strains from all known groups of CoVs demonstrated that the bovine-like CoVs isolated in this study belonged to Betacoronavirus 1 clustering with Korean BcoVs isolates collected after 2004 (Fig. 1a) . The bovine-like CoVs isolated were closely related to two Korean strains (BcoV-0501 and BcoV-0502) identified in 2005, suggesting that this virus may have been transmitted from cattle to zoo ruminants. Korean BcoVs strains collected before 2004 were divided into several clusters. A BcoV-white-tailed deer strain isolated in 1994 (Tsumemitsu et al., 1995) formed a cluster together with Korean BcoV-KWD1-10 isolates, with the exception of KWD 7. All of the HE genes contained an ORF of 1272 nucleotides, encoding a predicted protein of 424 aa residues and molecular weight of approximately 47.6 kDa. In total, 27 nucleotide substitutions were found compared to the Mebus strain, but no insertions or deletions were detected in any sequence. Also, five substitutions were found in the complete aa sequence of the S glycoprotein. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out to determine genetic relationships based on the nucleotide sequences of the HE gene (Fig. 1b) . The Korean BcoV strains were divided into three groups. The first group consisted mainly of all of the Korean isolates. CoV strains from zoo ruminants were grouped within a cluster of other Korean CoV strains isolated after 2004. The CoV strains clustered with the BcoV-0501/2005 strain, which was identified in 2005. The second group included some Korean strains isolated in 2002 and bovine-like strains from wild ruminants. The last group consisted mainly of BcoV vaccine strains. In this study, we compared the S and HE genes of Korean bovine-like CoVs isolated directly from feces of zoo ruminants to determine their relatedness to bovine-like CoVs from wild ruminants at other locations. However, no relationship between Korean bovine-like CoVs and those from wild ruminants at other locations was detected. Sequence analysis of the S and HE genes, however, indicated that the strains show a high similarity to BcoV. This was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis, thus supporting data obtained previously (Alekseev et al., 2008) . The CoV strain isolated in this study appears to derive from the same ancestor as the BcoV 05/01 and BcoV 05/02 strains isolated from cattle in Korea. Also, the sequences of the S and HE genes of Korean CoV strains represented on the tree grouped according to year of isolation. These data support the hypothesis that genetic difference may be related more to the time of the appearance of an outbreak than to its geographic location (Alekseev et al., 2008; Jeong et al., 2005b) . The 99.9% aa identity of the five bovine-like CoV strains suggests that the zoo ruminants were infected by the same Phylogenetic tree generated by neighbor-joining analysis of genetic distance in the complete sequences of the S (a) and HE (b) genes. The nucleotide sequences of five bovine-like CoV strains were aligned using BioEdit and Mega 3 software. Three thousand bootstrap replicates were subjected to both nucleotide sequence distance and neighbor-joining methods. The consensus phylogenetic tree is shown with bootstrap values >70% displayed above the tree branches. bovine-like CoV. The high genetic similarity with bovinelike CoVs from the zoo ruminants and Korean BcoV strains was also confirmed, suggesting that cattle may be potential reservoirs for CoVs that infect zoo ruminants. However, additional isolation and characterization of bovine-like CoVs from other heterologous hosts are required to clarify the origin of bovine-like CoVs and their relationship to other BcoVs. Since the 1970s, bovine-like CoVs have been recognized as being distributed worldwide, with many reports indicating that the virus had been detected and/or isolated in the United States, Europe, and Asia. BcoVs have been detected in the feces of calves and adult cattle with diarrhea in Korea (Jeong et al., 2005a,b; Park et al., 2006) . In addition, antibodies to BcoV have been demonstrated in Korean native goats (Capra hircus), and 1.0% of Korean native goats were serologically positive for BcoV (Yang et al., 2008) . However, this to our knowledge is the only report of detection and characterization of bovine-like CoVs in Korea that has been published to date. No specific genomic characteristics that could account for the host specificity exhibited by bovine-like CoVs were identified by comparative sequence analysis.
