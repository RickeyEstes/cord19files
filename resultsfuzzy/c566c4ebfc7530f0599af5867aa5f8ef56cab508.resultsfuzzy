For the purpose of simulations, we consider influenza infection for which drug resistance is a well-documented evolutionary consequence of antiviral agents used for treatment of clinical disease. Here, we investigate a scenario in which drug resistant mutants are initially absent, and resistance may emerge during the course of an outbreak as a result of treatment. To simulate the models formulated above, estimated parameters are taken from the published literature for influenza, with the values of R s 0 in the range 1-3 (see Table 2 ). We consider a susceptible population of size S 0 ¼ 100; 000, and assume fixed values of n ¼ 6 and f ¼ 0:2. We also assume that the resistant strain is initially absent ðI r ð0Þ ¼ 0Þ, but emerges with a relative transmissibility d r ¼ 0:8 during the outbreak. Furthermore, we seed the population with I U ð0Þ ¼ 100 infections such that each infected individual makes initial contact with only susceptible neighbours. This would be the case, for example, if infected individuals were initially uniformly distributed through the population. Figs. 2a-c show the final size of the outbreak (the total number of infections caused by both strains at the end of the epidemic including recovered and dead individuals) in each model as a function of treatment level p, for different values of R s 0 . Since treatment reduces the transmission of the sensitive strain, a substantial reduction in morbidity (and therefore mortality) of the population is achieved when treatment is maintained at low to moderate levels. However, high treatment levels exert significant selective pressure that allows the resistant strain to gain enough competitive advantage to establish a self-sustaining resistant outbreak, thereby increasing the total number of infections. These simulations indicate that there is an optimal treatment level associated with each value of R s 0 that minimizes the final size of the outbreak. While these models produce qualitatively similar results, the emergence of resistance in the pair-approximation model (Fig. 2c ) requires a higher reproduction number with a significantly lower optimal treatment level compared to the homogeneous models ( Figs. 2a and b) . As is evidence, treatment levels above approximately 40% leads to the wide-spread resistance for R s 0 ¼ 1:4, 1.8, 2.2 (solid, dashed, dotted curves in Figs. 2a and b, respectively) in both mean-field and stochastic models, whereas the spread of disease is largely controlled in the pair-approximation model with very few resistant infected cases. To illustrate the time course of the outbreak when treatment is maintained at a constant level, we assume R s 0 ¼ 2:4, corresponding to the dot-dashed curves in Fig. 2. For a low treatment level (30%), the sensitive strain spreads quickly (with slower rate in the pair-approximation model) and depletes the susceptible population (Figs. 3a-c, solid curves), and therefore a limited number of resistant cases is generated (Figs. 3a-c, dashed curves) . Increasing treatment in each model to the optimal level associated with R s 0 ¼ 2:4 leads to the further reduction in the spread of the sensitive strain, but the generation of more resistant infections. In this case, while emergent resistant strains cause a small outbreak (Figs. 3d-f, dashed curves), the total number of infections is minimal. Further increase in the treatment level to 80% enhances the spread of drug-resistance by shifting the competitive balance in favor of the resistant strain. As shown in Figs. 3g and h (dashed curves), a single wave of outbreak (virtually identical to the total number of infections) is largely caused by the spread of resistance in both mean-field and stochastic models. However, in the pair-approximation model, we observe two distinct infection curves: the earlier (smaller) outbreak is caused by the sensitive strain (which can account for the establishment of the disease in the population, the so-called seeding phase of the pathogen), and the subsequent (larger) outbreak is driven by the resistant strain (Fig. 3i, solid and dashed curves) . This phenomenon can also be observed for a wide range of treatment levels above the optimal level (37%), with the possibility of distinct large outbreaks of both sensitive and resistant infections. As illustrated in Fig. 4a for a 37.4% treatment level with a smaller number of initial infections ðI U ð0Þ ¼ 20Þ, the first wave of infections unfolds with a magnitude comparable to that of the second outbreak triggered by the emergence of highly transmissible resistance. Increasing treatment to higher levels leads to a more rapid emergence of resistance (with less prevalence of the sensitive strain), and an earlier occurrence of the subsequent resistant outbreak with a larger magnitude (Fig. 3i) . The magnitude and the peak time for these outbreaks depend not only on the treatment level, but also on other parameters involved in the spread of pathogen strains, such as the fitness of resistance. This is shown in Fig. 4b for slightly lower fitness of resistance ðd r ¼ 0:78Þ and a 39% treatment level with I U ð0Þ ¼ 20, demonstrating a lower magnitude of outbreaks with further delay in the spread of resistance. Our simulations also indicate that when treatment is maintained at low levels or sufficiently close to the optimal level, the final size of infections in each outbreak has very marginal dependence on the initial number of infections (Figs. 5a-c) . This suggests that the epidemic has spread well beyond the establishment phase ( Figs. 4a and b) . Table 2 .
