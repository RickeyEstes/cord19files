Optimization of RPA and multiplex RPA development In the isothermal RPA a phage derived recombinase in combination with a co-factor form a complex with oligonucleotide primers which then can be directed to homologeous sequences in a DNA template. Subsequently amplification takes place using a strand-displacement polymerase and single-strand binding proteins (SSB) (Fig. 2a) . The uniform isothermal reaction at a temperature of 37-39°C and the use of only two primers are advantageous, yet regular PCR primers are unlikely to work in the RPA [30] . For this reason several primer combinations were initially evaluated for each pathogenic target sequence in singleplex reactions and tested for sensitivity and specificity. Each RPA primer pair generated a product that was distinct in size in order to enable the interpretation of amplification results on an agarose gel. The amplification of multiple DNA targets in the same reaction has the advantage to gain more information from one sample and thus reduce time and costs for every diagnosis since no parallel experiments are necessary to be conducted. So far most isothermal nucleic acid amplification techniques are usually limited to amplify only one target sequence. In the RPA two primers are needed for a successful amplification whereas e.g. the LAMP-technique typically uses six primers. Hence a higher multiplexing ability can be assumed for the RPA. Various primer mixtures and concentrations as well as reaction conditions were evaluated and optimized for the multiplex experiments. In Fig. 3 all simplex and the multiplex detection are visualized on an ethidium-bromide stained agarose gel and the specific amplification with RPA can be determined by the size of the product. All RPA reactions were run at 38°C for 40 min with 250 pg of genomic DNA and subsequently purified with spin columns. In the quadruplex reaction clearly distinguishable bands of the expected product sizes are observable with no specific band in the no template control (NTC). Albeit the brightness of all bands shows almost the same intensity, minor differences are noticeable. Amplification efficiency in a multiplex amplification assay highly depends e.g. on the target sequence, amplicon size or primer characteristics and has to be optimized for every new multiplex approach.
