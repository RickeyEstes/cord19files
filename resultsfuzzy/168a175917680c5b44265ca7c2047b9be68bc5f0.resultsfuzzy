It was revealed that 9.75% (28/287) of fecal samples contained PEDV. Geographical distribution of PEDV in wild boar was observed Fig. 2 . Phylogenetic tree of PEDV partial spike sequences of wild boar strains (gray shadow and diamonds) and GenBank available sequences. Reference strains were indicated as follows; strain (country/year/accession number). Bootstrap replication values using from 1000 replicates are listed as percentages at branch nodes. Bootstrap support values above 70% are shown. Subgroups of the phylogenetic tree were divided as G1, G2, and G3. G1 was further subdivided into G1-1, G1-2, and G1-3 (Park et al., 2007) . in mainland South Korea (Fig. 1) . About half of the positive samples were intensively detected in Northern districts near the DMZ such as Seoul/Gyeonggi (10/84) and Gangwon Province (5/56) (Fig. 1) . Almost all of the detected samples were adjacent to mountainous regions (Fig. 1) . The 612 bp of partial spike genomes (S1 C-terminal domain: 1486-2096 nt of the S gene) were obtained from wild boar samples (primer sequences were subtracted). Accession numbers were KU529655-KU529682 (Table 1 ). In previous studies, a phylogenetic tree corresponding to a partial spike gene was divided into G1 (subdivided into G1-1, G1-2, and G1-3), G2, and G3 (Park et al., 2007; Puranaveja et al., 2009) . Phylogenetic analysis of PEDV in this study showed that all wild boar strains belong to G1-2 (Fig. 2) . The pairwise sequence identities between the Korean wild boar strains shared 96.5-100% sequence identity. Those strains were closely (Table 1 and Fig. 2) . Recently, the population of wild boar in the Korean peninsula was expected to increase because of the extinction of predators such as Panthera tigris and Canis lupus chanco (Choi et al., 2012) . Nevertheless, the accurate estimation of population size and movement of wild boar is virtually impossible because of the existence of the demilitarized zone (DMZ), which works as a physical limitation. Since the DMZ has been restricted from human disturbance since the 1953 ceasefire, the undeveloped forest remains an untapped resource for the study of wild life disease and ecology (Yoon et al., 2010) . Since wild boars prefer forest habitats, the DMZ and other forest regions of the Korean peninsula may be densely populated with wild boar. Furthermore, about 70% of the Korean peninsula landscape comprises hill and mountain ranges, with pig farms primarily in rural valleys at the foot of mountain ranges. Collectively, these circumstances connoted a high risk for wild boar acting as reservoirs of infectious diseases that threaten the livestock industry. Since the first isolation of PEDV in Korea (Kweon et al., 1993) , PEDV has been considered one of a most contagious viruses in the Korean swine industry due to rapid onset of the disease and tremendous losses of piglets. Although vaccination and preventive measures have been used to control endemics, outbreaks of this disease have consistently emerged. However, the pig population in Korea has plummeted due to a foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in 2010-2011. As a consequence of strict biosecurity measures and a decreased pig population, outbreaks of PEDV have been attenuated (Lee et al., 2015) . Even with the reduction of PEDV outbreaks in domestic pigs in this period, wild boar strains of PEDV were still detected. This study demonstrated that the PEDV is distributed in wild boar populations around the mainland of South Korea. The geographical distribution of PEDV, focused on Northern districts and mountainous area, provides new information for PEDV epidemiology and disease control strategies. Several studies suggested that highly contagious pathogens in wild boar, such as CSFV and ASFV, are transmitted by the direct or indirect contact between wild boar and domestic swine (Costard et al., 2013; Penrith et al., 2011; Seo et al., 2012) . However, it is unclear because there is not sufficient evidence of direct transmission of PEDV between domestic pigs and wild boars. Our retrospective data, which is obtained from wild boar feces during 2010/2011, merely demonstrated the previous existence of PEDV in wild boar and the role of wild boar as conceivable host of PEDV. Moreover, we hypothesized that the possibility of PEDV cross-over in Korea between wild boar and domestic pig populations may be low, based on the fact that the domestic strains were rarely found in the G1-2 including wild boar strains. Hence, further studies will be necessary to substantiate the possibility of transmission between domestic and wild pigs. Given the phylogenetic analysis result, the wild boar PEDV strains had close genetic similarity with Chinese strains. Among the Korean wild boar strains, we found 100% homology between strains from distant geographical locations (Fig. 2) . This result is unexpected considering the geographical barriers that isolated the populations of wild boars. However, the genetic analysis of this study was limited to a partial sequence, and the phylogenetic relationship of partial sequences does not always correspond to full spike gene analysis. Moreover, the sample distribution and collections were not performed uniformly over the collection years. Therefore, in order to explore the accurate origin and evolutionary history of wild boar PEDV, further studies of extended gene sequences in wild boar populations are needed on an annual basis with attention to broader geographical distributions. Although the origin of PEDV in wild boars may be controversial, we assumed that the ancestral PEDV strains in wild boars had evolved consistently until detection. Moreover, Coronaviruses undergo RNA homologous recombination events with high frequency (He et al., 2014; Woo et al., 2010) . Several studies determined that the recombination events of PEDV can occur among other PEDV strains as well as between other Coronaviridae (Boniotti et al., 2016) . In particular, in the case of wild animal viral hosts, the introduction of novel PEDV strains can more increase the diversity of viral genetics and induce recombination events (Cadar et al., 2012) . In the case of CSFV, wild boar have a role as a viral reservoir by self-limiting infection despite the high mortality in domestic pigs (Rossi et al., 2005; Ruiz-Fons et al., 2008) . The moderate prevalence of PEDV in wild boar implies that PEDV may not be fatal to wild boar. Hence, the wild boar may undergo persistent infection with PEDV. However, in order to test this hypothesis further studies are necessary, such as analysis of pathogenesis in tagged wild boar challenged with a known strain of PEDV followed by long term monitoring. In summary, our findings demonstrated that PEDV in wild boar was distributed in the Korean peninsula. Furthermore, the current study emphasized the necessity for comprehensive epidemiological and pathological studies of PEDV infection in wild boar to determine if wild boar do act as a PEDV reservoir. Therefore, the current study provides a novel insight into potential epidemiology and controls of PEDV infection and reveals a hitherto-undiscovered potential host of PEDV.
