The estimates of 0 for the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic were mainly reported based on the data obtained in the first few months of pandemic or based on whole first wave data. Most of these 0 estimates ranges from 1.1 to 2 [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . Our estimated value of the basic reproduction number indicates the milder intensity of disease transmission in India. Interestingly, this estimated 0 with 95% credible interval is consistent with several other studies on the same strain [35] , along with many European countries [28] . Notably, it has a smaller credible length which is more reliable estimate; see Table 1 . Statistical inference of 0 is based on incidence (reported cases) and known generation time distribution. Some differences among these estimates are due to the choice of generation time distribution because 0 estimation relies much on the assumptions of the generation time distribution [38] . In general, shorter mean generation time may lead to smaller 0 estimates. Since, the estimate of 0 crucially depends on generation time distribution. From Table 1 , we conclude that generation time or infectiousness of an individual affects the basic reproduction number. This method does not require exponential growth assumption. Still our estimate is greater than one so one has to make effort in controlling the disease through control strategies, which are typically targeted to bring this number below one and maintain it, as this will lead to eventual extinction of the epidemic.
