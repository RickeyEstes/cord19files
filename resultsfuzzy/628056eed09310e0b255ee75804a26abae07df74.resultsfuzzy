There are >28,000 probe sets in the Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array. Using a 2-fold threshold, we found 974 up-regulated and 187 down-regulated genes in the liver, and 546 up-regulated and 499 down-regulated genes in the spleen in the severe GD1 mice compared to the control (Supplementary Tables 1-4 ). Interrogation of IPA with these gene sets yielded several most significant networks (Supplementary Table 5 ). The liver up-regulated genes comprised inflammatory response and immune genes, whereas lipid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism genes were down-regulated. In contrast, gene pathways up-regulated in the spleen included infectious disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome genes, whereas those down-regulated comprised genes related to hematological system development, and the function and quantity of lymphocytes. The gene expression pattern that we deciphered is broadly similar to that reported in another mouse model of GD1 [12] . The data are biologically plausible, in view of our recent observation of a plethora of immune cell defects in GD1 mice with the GBA1 gene deleted in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) [13] . Notably, we found that the thymus exhibits the earliest and most striking alterations suggesting impaired T-cell maturation, aberrant Bcell recruitment, and enhanced antigen presentation [10, 13] . In contrast, the spleen showed less impressive changes in immune cell composition; these changes were restricted mainly to severely sick mice. Thus, we argue that genetic aberrations in immune gene expression revealed on high density microarray might precede, and perhaps even underlie, the cellular composition changes we note in the spleen. This is a prelude to future studies on human GD1 to evaluate whether query signatures could perhaps even be assigned to predict immune-related manifestations. As noted above, macrophage-targeted enzyme replacement therapy does not ameliorate, in particular, the immunological and some of the skeletal manifestations of GD1 [14] . We therefore elected to develop spleen-and liver-based query signatures to interrogate CMAP, so as to yield compounds amenable for further testing. For this, we further filtered gene sets contained within the up-regulated down-regulated pathways noted in Supplementary Table 5 , specifically to remove genes that were not regulated in the original dataset (Figs. 2 and 3, Supplementary Table 6) . Table 1 shows the number of genes before and after filtering; these gene sets were used as ''signatures'' to query CMAP. Table 2 shows the most significant hits after CMAP analysis (see Supplementary Tables 7 and 8 for complete results). The chemical structures of these hits are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 . Of note is that the data is ranked first by enrichment and then by percent non-null hits. This criteria is different from that used previously, wherein connectivity scores were the sole determinants of the CMAP ranking [19] . In line with inflammatory and immune gene regulation, CMAP yielded a host of chemicals utilized in acute and chronic infections. One such high scoring hit, albendazole (enrichment 0.823, p 0.0112, n = 3), is used as an anti-helminthic agent in cysticercosis. Interestingly, the highest ranking anti-mimic was oxamniquine, again an anti-helminthic agent against schistosomiasis. Fig. 3 . Pathway-enriched genes that show up (A) and down (B) regulation in the spleen of severe GD1 mice after pathway analysis. Genes were further selected such that they showed at least 2-fold up (C) or down (D) regulation in the spleen of moderate GD1 mice.
