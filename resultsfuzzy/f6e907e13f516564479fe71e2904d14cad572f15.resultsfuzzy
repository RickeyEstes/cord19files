Differences in Viral Fitness and Host Symptomatology Figure 1 shows relevant information about the seven TEV genotypes used for this study. The mutant genotypes differ from the wild-type (WT) genotype in a rather limited number of nonsynonymous mutations (1 or 2). However, their fitness values and the severity of symptoms induced differ widely. In this study, the fitness of each mutant genotype was estimated as the ratio of Malthusian growth rates of the mutant and the WT (see Materials and Methods for details). Significant differences existed among the fitness values of the seven selected 1B ). Figure 1C illustrates the differences in symptoms induced by each one of the seven genotypes. Symptoms ranged from the asymptomatic infection or local chlorotic spots characteristic of mutant AS13, the mild etching of mutant CLA11 and the severe etching induced by the WT and the other mutants. No correlation exists between virus fitness and symptoms, a finding previously reported for this experimental system (Carrasco, De la Iglesia, et al. 2007 ). Differences in Viral Fitness Are Associated with Differences in the Magnitude of the Change in the Host Transcriptome First, we sought to test whether differences in TEV fitness might be associated with differences in the gene expression profiles of infected plants. We hypothesized that viral fitness results from a particular interaction between virus and host factors and assumed that the outcome of infection of a WT virus in its natural host results from an optimal (from the virus perspective) modulation of the host's gene expression profile. As viral fitness is reduced, interactions are less optimal and, consequently, the gene expression profile of the plant will be increasingly different from that resulting from the infection with the WT virus. To test this hypothesis, we infected N. tabacum plants with each one of the seven TEV genotypes described earlier. Eight-day postinoculation (dpi) symptomatic tissues were collected for all mutants except for the very low fitness mutant AS13, for which tissues were collected 15 dpi because the delay in symptoms appearance and severity ( fig. 1C ). Total RNAs were extracted, normalized, and used to hybridize N. tabacum Gene Expression 4 Â 44 K Microarrays (Agilent). Slides were handled as described in the Materials and Methods section; intensity signals were normalized using tools in BABELOMICS (Alonso et al. 2015) . Normalized expression data are contained in supplementary file S1, Supplementary Material online. Figure 2A shows the clustering (unweighted average distance method; UPGMA) of average expression data for those genes that significantly changed expression (62-fold) among plants infected with the seven viral genotypes (1-way ANOVAs with false discovery rate (FDR) correction; overall P < 0.05) relative to the mock-inoculated plants. Regarding individual genes, two major clusters can be distinguished, one corresponding to the overexpression of genes related to stress response and a second one corresponding to the underexpression of genes involved with metabolism and plant development. To further explore the similarity in the perturbation induced by each viral genotype into the plants' transcriptome, we computed all pairwise Pearson productmoment correlation coefficients (r) between the mean expression values for all genes in the microarray. These correlations were used as a measure of similarity to build a UPGMA dendrogram. The rationale for this analysis is as follows: the more correlated two expression profiles are, the more similar the effects induced in infected plants. When comparing expression profiles from a pair of infected plants, a high correlation may indicate that genes that changed expression relative to the mock-inoculated plants, are exactly the same in both samples, showing a similar expression pattern. Conversely, if genes with differential expression do not match in the two profiles being compared, then the correlation will be low. Figure 2B shows both the heat-map of the correlation coefficients and the resulting dendrogram. Three clusters result from this analysis ( fig. 2B ). The first cluster is constituted by the three viral genotypes with the higher fitness values, that is, WT, PC55, and PC48. Genotypes of intermediate fitness CLA11, PC95, and CLA2 constitute a second cluster. Finally, plants infected with AS13 show the most dissimilar gene expression profile. The heat-map is shown with viral genotypes ordered according to the UPGMA clustering. Correlations decreased as the distance in the cladogram increases. Within clusters, r > 0.85, whereas between clusters the correlations ranged between 0.65 < r < 0.75, except for plants infected with AS13, whose similarity with other infected plants was r < 0.65. Next, to further investigate the similarity between expression profiles of plants infected with different TEV genotypes, we performed a principal components (pc) analysis of all the gene expression data. The percentage of total observed variance explained by the first three components was $93% (the first pc itself explained 81%). Figure 2C shows the distribution of values in the space defined by the three first principal components. Results are equivalent to those obtained with the two previous clustering methods, where genotypes are classified into three groups. WT, PC55, and PC48 are closer in the space and characterized by positive values of first pc but negative values of the second and third pcs. CLA11, PC95, and CLA2 form a second group, with positive values of first and second pcs but negative values of the third. As before, AS13 effect on host transcriptome is clearly different, and has negative values of the first and second pcs but positive of the Only genes that show significant differences among all infections (oneway ANOVA with FDR, adjusted P < 0.05) are included in the heat-map. Hierarchical clustering of genes done with UPGMA by using the correlations between all pairs of mean profiles as distance metric. Genes down-regulated (in blue) mainly correspond to metabolic and developmental processes, whereas genes up-regulated (in red) mainly correspond to stress responses.

Interestingly, figure 2C shows that genotypes are located in this principal component space following a trajectory of increasing fitness values (indicated by the arrow in fig. 2C ). Along this trajectory, pcs switch sign in different directions. This transition suggests that the over-or under-expression of a set of genes is associated with particular levels of viral fitness: low fitness AS13 is characterized by a positive third pc and a negative first pc while high fitness viruses are characterized by the opposite sign. That is, over-or underexpressed genes are not progressively accumulated as long as viral fitness changes. These genes will be evaluated in the following sections. Following from our working hypothesis, if the WT virus has evolved to optimize its interaction with the host, it is logical that small departures in viral fitness will be associated with small deviations between the transcriptomes of plants infected with the WT virus and with viruses whose fitness is close to the WT. Conversely, the less similar fitness between the WT and mutant viruses, the more dissimilar would be the transcriptional profiles of infected plants. To test this prediction, we have explored the following: 1) the correlation between the similarity of transcriptional profiles of plants infected with the WT TEV and with each mutant (again using Pearson's r) and fitness and 2) the correlation between the distance from WT in the cladogram shown in figure 2B and fitness. The results of these analyses are shown in figure 3D and E. As expected, both correlations were significant (r ¼ 0.826, P ¼ 0.005 and r ¼ À0.857, P ¼ 0.003, respectively; in both cases 5 df) and of the expected sign. Viral Fitness and Perturbation of Host's Transcriptomes . doi:10.1093/molbev/msy038 MBE plants. The number of down-expressed DEGs ranges between 531 (for AS13) and 2,809 (for CLA11), while in the case of upexpressed DEGs the range is slightly narrower: from 781 (AS13) to 2,696 (CLA11). Figure 3B illustrates the number of DEGs in common between all pairs of transcriptomes from infected plants. The heat-map shows a pattern of modularity, with three well-defined modules. The first module contains the three viruses with highest fitness (WT, PC48, and PC55), the second module contains the three viruses with intermediate fitness (PC95, CLA11, and CLA2), and the very low fitness genotype AS13 is the only member of the third module. The number of shared DEGs within each of these modules is > 75% of total. The number of shared DEGs between modules drops <60%.
