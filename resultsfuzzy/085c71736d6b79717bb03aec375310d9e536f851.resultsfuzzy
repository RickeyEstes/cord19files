Several cellular proteins bind to the 39UTR of HAstV-8 RNA The integrity of the secondary structure of the 39UTR facilitates the recruitment of cellular and viral factors to the VRC and is also involved in viral viability, RNA stability, translation initiation, or intracellular localization [32] [33] [34] [35] . Thus far, only the structure of HAstV-1 39UTR RNA has been described only [9, 8] , therefore we analyzed the predicted structures of as many HAstV sequences available (Fig. 1A) . Due to its prevalence in MÃ©xico, we focused on HAstV-8 39UTR structure. It is arranged in two helixes (I and II) connected through a linker (Fig. 1A) ; splitting the 39UTR facilitated comparisons between strains. Between serotypes, linker lengths are the source of variation in the helix I-linker regions, albeit in helix II nucleotide variations were found ( Fig. 1B; nucleotide changes are shown for each strain). Putative PTB/ hnRNP1 binding sites UCUU are found in the single-stranded (or partly) linkers of HAstV-3, -5, and -7, whereas in HAstV-1 and -4 these elements are localized nearby. At the beginning of helixes II (Fig. 1A) , all but HAstV-4 contain the previously reported PTB/ hnRNP1 binding element CUCUCU [36] . This structural arrangement could partially explain the prevalence of serotypes in the world [8] , probably as a consequence of the interaction with cellular and viral factors that may impact viral functions [37] . Cellular proteins bound to the 39UTR in positive-strand RNA viruses, play important roles in assembling the viral RNA replication complex, selecting and recruiting viral RNA replication templates to perform the synthesis of the minus-strand RNA [10, 19] ; among them are PTB, EF-1a , La, Nucleolin, Sam68, PABP, PCBP1/2 and TIA-1/TIAR [38] [39] [40] 15, [41] [42] [43] 19, 17] . Mobility shift assays showed that two protein complexes (CI and CII) were recruited on the HAstV-8 39UTR RNA, with two different amounts of uninfected and infected CaCo2 cells extracts (data no shown). The specificity of the interactions between the HAstV-8 39UTR and infected cells extracts was analyzed in a competition assays using 20-fold and 60-fold molar excess of unlabeled homologous RNA 39UTR as a competitor. The cellular proteins-viral RNA Complex CII was competed with cold homologous RNA (Fig. 2B) , indicating that RNA binding of these proteins was specific and probably through PTB/hRNP1 binding sites. In contrast, in complex CI the binding of cellular proteins to the 39UTR RNA sequences seems to be non-specific, since it was competed both by homologous and heterologous RNAs, without PTB/hnRNP1 binding sites. Therefore, RNA-protein interactions in CI are likely mediated by motifs other than the PTB/hnRNP1 binding site. When labeled HAstV-8 39UTR (nt 6674 to 6759) was UV crosslinked to uninfected and infected CaCo2 cell extracts we detected that seven proteins of 35, 40, 45, 50, 52, 57/60 and 75 kDa from both cell extracts were bound to the probe. However, stronger signals of individual proteins of infected cell extracts were observed (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 3, respectively) , reflecting the presence of infection-specific factors resulting in more efficient binding of proteins to the 39UTR. Except for the 75 kDa protein, proteins of similar molecular weight were previously reported. To exclude cross-contamination between cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, western blots were carried out with anti-Actin and anti-Lamin A antibodies (Fig. 2D ). As expected, the cytoplasmic fractions were free of nuclear proteins contamination (compare lanes 1, 3, 5 and 7).
