All pigs in the PEDV-inoculated group were clinically normal in appearance and behavior prior to the inoculation. Some pigs showed watery diarrhea during the observation period and all fecal samples were PEDV-specific rRT-PCR positive within 4 days postinoculation. The distribution of PEDV ELISA S/P results for serum and meat juice (Fig. 1) showed that the IgA and IgG serum and meat juice ELISAs provided clear discrimination between positive and negative samples. The association between serum and meat juice S/P results (Fig. 2 ) was significant for both the PEDV IgG (R 2 0.64) and IgA (R 2 0.89) ELISAs (linear regression; p < 0.0001). Test performance based on ROC analyses of serum and meat juice ELISA results are reported in Table 1 over a range of cutoffs. These data are consistent with previous reports. That is, detectable levels of antibodies against a variety of pathogens have been reported in meat juice, e.g., pseudorabies virus [7] , PRRSV [4] , classical swine fever virus [8] , porcine circovirus type 2 [9] and others. A previous study using specimens from 49 swine herds in Germany reported that antibodies against Salmonella spp., Trichinella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Toxoplasma gondii, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, influenza A virus (H1N1 and H3N2), and PRRSV could be detected in meat juice [2] . Porcine coronaviruses, particularly PEDV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and porcine deltacoronavirus, have caused devastating losses at the global level [10] . New swine coronaviruses, e.g., swine acute diarrhea virus (SADS-CoV), continue to emerge with effects yet to be determined [11] . Highly transmissible and stable in the environment [10] , these viruses have moved rapidly across pork-producing regions of the world. The exception to the rule, Canada has been effective in slowing the spread of PEDV and PDCoV and may ultimately succeed in eliminating both viruses [12] . The Canadian effort is based on extensive surveillance of animals, farms, and the production chain, i.e., livestock assembly yards, abattoirs, truck wash stations, and livestock trailers, by RT-rtPCR. If control and elimination is successful, other regions may choose to follow suit. However, swine coronaviruses will continue to circulate widely in swine populations in much of the world. Thus, inexpensive but effective surveillance methods will be needed to detect incursions, guide program responses, and maintain freedom from these pathogens. In the context of surveillance, meat juice-based testing presents significant advantages. Porcine muscle specimens are readily collected at the abattoir and avoid the biosecurity risks inherent to on-farm visits. The disadvantage of this approach is that infection is only recognized retroactively. Regardless, meat juice is easily recovered by thawing the frozen meat sample and is compatible with high-throughput testing. Previous reports showed that the kinetics of ELISA-detectable PEDV IgG and IgA differed among specimen types, e.g. serum, oral fluids, and mammary secretions [6, 13] . Since PEDV infection occurs in the gut and stimulates mucosal immunity, IgA is usually higher than IgG in oral fluids and mammary secretions, but lower than IgG in serum [14] . For completeness, both IgG and IgA antibody ELISAs were evaluated for their ability to discriminate between PEDV-negatives and -positives in the meat juice matrix. Although the duration of detectable PEDV antibodies in meat juice specimens has not been described, Bjustrom-Kraft et al. (2016) reported that PEDV-specific IgG and IgA was detected in serum and oral fluid specimens for at least 4 months post-inoculation using the same PEDV IgG and IgA ELISAs as performed in this study [13] . This suggests that meat juice specimens collected from PEDV-positive populations at the abattoir will also contain ELISA-detectable levels of antibody. Test performance of the PEDV IgG and IgA ELISAs was previously described [13] . In this study, even though the broad test diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were reported due to number of the animals, these ELISAs were found to be highly diagnostically specific and sufficiently diagnostically sensitive at the individual pig level to be useful in surveillance. The results of this study suggest that a cutoff of S/P â‰¥ 0.5 would be appropriate for surveillance using either the IgG or IgA meat juice ELISAs (Table 1 ). This cutoff intentionally maximizes diagnostic specificity at the cost of sensitivity because false positive results quickly undermine confidence in the surveillance program. The shortcoming of a lower probability of detection (diagnostic sensitivity of~90%) is offset by the fact that most individuals in PEDV-positive populations are infected. Furthermore, the availability of both IgG and IgA PEDV meat juice ELISAs would provide for screening and confirmatory assays based on different antibody isotypes. Given these advantages, this approach should be given consideration if the industry elects to intensify efforts to monitor and/or control PEDV.
