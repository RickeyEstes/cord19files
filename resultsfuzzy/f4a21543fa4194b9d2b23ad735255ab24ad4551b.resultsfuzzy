Bacterial pyoderma or chronic skin inflammation Dental disease (e.g., chronic gingivitis) Dirofilariasis Ehrlichial infections Endocarditis Feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline infectious peritonitis, and associated conditions (e.g., lymphoma) Immune-mediateddiseases Neoplasia Pancreatitis Pyometra Systemic lupus erythematosus 9. Summarize the diagnostic plan for cats with suspected glomerulonephritis. Complete cell count, serum biochemical panel, urinalysis with protein/creatinine ratio, and systemic blood pressure are recommended for all cats with glomerulonephritis. Renal ultrasound may be used to evaluate for morphologic renal diseases. Thoracic and abdominal radiographs may be used to evaluate for occult infections or neoplasia. Feline leukemia virus serum antigen test and feline immunodeficiency virus serum antibody test are indicated in most cases. Other specialized testing, such as serum coronavirus antibody titers, Ehrlichia spp. antibody titers, and Dirofilaria immitis serum antigen and antibody tests, are indicated in some cats.
