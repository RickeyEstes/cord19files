• Steroid therapy alters test results. The LE cell test is more sensitive to effects of steroids than is an ANA titer. • Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., cyclophosphamide) may cause negative results. If an animal is receiving short-acting corticosteroids, the drug should be withdrawn for at least 3 weeks before biopsy. A longer period (1 to 2 months) may be necessary if long-acting injectable corticosteroids have been used.
