3.1. Design of arch-shaped multiple-target sensing platform Fig. 1 shows the design of the arch-shaped multiple-target sensing platform for rapid diagnosis of emerging infectious pathogens, such as MERS-CoV, HCoV, ZIKV, and EBOV, using a SMR sensor. We established a series of primers for target amplification and simultaneous detection of specific multiple-targets rather than asymmetric amplification on a SMR sensor lacking multiple target detection (Kim et al., 2018; Koo et al., 2017) . For multiple-target sensing, the SMR surface was first amine-modified with APTES and linked to the NH 2 -modified 5′-end of both primers. Second, both primers (forward and reverse) of a target were immobilized on the SMR sensor surface. Immobilization of both primers reduces non-specific target binding and false-positives due to primer-dimerization, which leads to the production of non-specific amplicons in the solution. To form an arch-shaped template on the surface, we used longer primers containing non-specific poly dT spacers (Shin et al., 2014) . The pair of primers for a single target was immobilized on an individual sensor using a spotting system Array of silicon microring resonator (SMR) sensors for multiple-target detection. Each microring was modified with specific primers (forward and reverse) of MERS-CoV (blue), ZIKV (red), and EBOV (purple) recognizable target sequences. (B) Scheme representation of the principle of arch-shaped amplification and detection assay. First, SMR sensors with specific primers immobilized to detect target RNA were prepared. Next, a mixture containing recombinase polymerase amplification-reverse transcription (RPA-RT) reagent and target extracted RNA was added to the platform (#1). During the reaction, RNA was synthesized by the RPA-RT enzyme mixture in an isothermal state (43°C) as cDNA and either recombinase/ forward (red arrow) primer or recombinase/ reverse (blue arrow) primer complexes bound to double-stranded target cDNA and facilitated strand exchange at a constant temperature. After the displaced strand formed a D-loop by gp32 (sky blue), the immobilized primers were extended by polymerase (green) on the sensor surface (#2). The extended primers formed an arch-shaped amplification complex in the same microring and continued amplification (#3). Target detection was monitored in real-time by measuring the resonant wavelength shift by arch-shaped amplified products on the solid surface. ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Third, either RPA or RPA-RT was added for isothermal nucleic acid amplification. During the amplification reaction, both primers were covalently bound to the SMR sensor and target templates were hybridized to both primers. To produce a copy of the hybridized template, RPA enzyme (including Taq polymerase) was activated to amplify the target template on the sensor surface. The attached forward primer bound the template, which could also bind to the attached reverse primer and form additional arch-shaped copies near the initial copies. Finally, we used an SMR sensor, which is a rapid and highly sensitive system for evaluation in a real-time and label-free manner, for the signal readout from multiple sensors. We monitored the resonance wavelength shift changes for up to 30 min. The resonance wavelength shift was obtained by individual sensors using the immobilized specific primers (Fig. 1) .
