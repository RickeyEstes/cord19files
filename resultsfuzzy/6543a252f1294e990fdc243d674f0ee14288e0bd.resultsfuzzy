We were interested in the possibility of creating a composite score from the items. Thus, we tested the unidimensionality with reliability tests. Principal component analyses were also conducted and yielded similar results. Reliability tests indicated that all scales had high Cronbach alphas with 0.91, 0.93, 0.80, and 0.87 for perceived travel risk, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, and self-efficacy scales respectively, which indicated the unidimensionality of the scales. Therefore, a composite score for each scale was created. Table 2 outlines the results of the reliability test for perceived travel risk. Table 3 presents the results of the reliability test for perceived susceptibility. Table 4 presents the results of the reliability test for perceived severity. Table 5 presents the results of the reliability test for self-efficacy. On average, respondents demonstrated low perceptions of risk on all items. Although the sample indicated that international travel seemed riskier than domestic travel, most respondents agreed that Ebola is a very frightening disease. This is partly explained by the fact that more than half of our sample have never traveled internationally before. The overall mean score for perceived risk was 2.88, indicating an overall low perception of risk associated with Ebola. The overall mean score of the perceived susceptibility scale was 2.00, indicating low perceived susceptibility related to Ebola in general. The overall mean score for the perceived severity construct was 3.12, which indicated the relative neutrality of the respondents. Nonetheless, it is also important to note that, on average, the respondent also agreed that if they test positive for Ebola, they could pass it to their family and friends who may die because of it. The overall mean score for self-efficacy was 3.62, indicating a relatively high self-efficacy among our respondents. Likewise, the mean score for subjective knowledge was 3.31(SD: 0.95), indicating relatively neutral subjective knowledge related to Ebola. In the Ordered Response Model, a positive parameter indicated that the corresponding variable was associated with a higher likelihood of avoiding travel in the U.S. due to the recent Ebola cases and a negative parameter indicated the opposite effect. The parameters of the model were estimated using the maximum likelihood estimator. The −2 Log likelihood at convergence was 3515.222 (χ 2 = 1152.526, df = 9, sig. = 0.001), indicating a significant improvement from the baseline model. The model with all independent variables accounted for 55% of the variance in the likelihood of travel avoidance. Table 6 outlines the results of the ordered response model. Related to Research Question 1, the model indicated that there was a positive relationship between perceived travel risk and travel avoidance (β = 1.450, p = 0.001), with those who held higher risk perceptions related to travel showing a higher propensity to avoid travel due to Ebola cases. For Research Question 2, the model indicated that there was a positive relationship between perceived susceptibility and avoiding travel due to Ebola cases (β = 0.584, p = 0.001). As such, those who indicated a higher susceptibility to Ebola also demonstrated a higher propensity to avoid travel. For Research Question 3, the model revealed no significant relationship between perceived severity and the likelihood of travel avoidance (β = −0.041, p = 0.58). For Research Question 4, the model revealed a negative relationship between self-efficacy and the likelihood of travel avoidance (β = −0.311, p = 0.001). That means those with lower selfefficacy were more likely to avoid travel due to Ebola. Regarding Research Question 5, the model found a positive relationship between subjective knowledge and the likelihood of travel avoidance (β = 0.228, p = 0.001), with those exhibiting higher levels of subjective knowledge being more likely to avoid travel due to Ebola. 3.14 1.23 • People around me seem to refrain from domestic air travel right now because of Ebola. 2.63 1.09 • People around me seem to refrain from international air travel right now because of Ebola. 2.92 1.13 • Ebola is a very frightening disease. 4.24 0.91 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. a All 1613 responded to the above survey items. Research Question 6, which focused on sociodemographic factors, yielded interesting findings. The model found a negative relationship between age and the likelihood to avoid travel (β = − 0.014, p = 0.001), with younger age groups showing a greater propensity of travel avoidance due to Ebola. The model also indicated a positive relationship between gender and travel avoidance (β = 0.324, p = 0.002), with females being more likely to avoid travel due to Ebola. No significant relationship was found between frequency of international travel and the propensity to avoid domestic travel (β = 0.008, p = 0.387). This is probably due to the fact that a majority of the respondents had not previously traveled internationally.
