Identification of the 5' terminus of scRNA-2 The 5' end of SYNV mRNA SC-~ (Rezaian et al., 1983) , which we have postulated to correspond to the G gene mRNA (Heaton et al., 1989) , was determined by extension of a 32P end-labeled DNA primer that was complementary to the 5' proximal end of the mRNA. Extension of this primer revealed a doublet corresponding to the 5' end of the SYNV mRNA (Fig. 2) . Similar results were obtained with primer extensions of the nucleocapsid (N) protein mRNA of SYNV the M2 protein mRNA and the Ml protein mRNA (Hillman eta/., 1990) suggesting that the first three residues of the scRNA-2 transcripts, beginning at nt position 5 1 1 1 on the SYNV genomic RNA, are 5'-AAC-3'as has also been reported for the other SYNV mRNAs (Heaton eta/., 1989) . There is no evidence that the spacer dinucleotide (GG) on the genomic RNA, which is a component of the gene-junction region at nt positions 5109-51 10, is transcribed. was extended on poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from SYNV-infected Nicotiana edwardsonii plants and the reaction products were analyzed on 6% polyaclylamide gels. The lane adjacent to the primer extension products (E) contains sequence reactions from pSYNV2 primed with the same oligonucleotide. The nucleotide sequence is represented in the minus sense. The first three nucleotides of the underlined region correspond to the consensus rhabdovirus mRNA initiation trinucleotide. This finding is in agreement with previous sequencing results (Heaton et a/., 1989) . identification of the protein encoded by the scRNA-2 A fusion protein was constructed to provide more direct evidence that the G protein found in virus particles was encoded by scRNA-2. Ascites fluid from mice immunized with the G protein was tested against a /I-galactosidase fusion product containing 234 amino acids derived from the scRNA-2 gene. Western blot analyses revealed a positive reaction of the SYNV G protein antibodies to the fusion protein as well as to the G protein from virion preparations (Fig. 3) . No crossreactions occurred with other viral or bacterial proteins. These results demonstrate that scRNA-2 is the mRNA for the SYNV G protein. The complete nucleotide sequence of the G protein gene Five overlapping plasmids (Fig. 1 ) were used to obtain the complete sequence of the gene. These plasmids contain an SYNV-specific sequence derived from genomic RNA or poly(A)+ RNA from infected plants that hybridized to the G gene. The genomic clones pGL9 and pSYNV2 hybridized to the M 1 (scRNA-6) and the G genes, pAS3-9 and PAT-Kl hybridized to the G gene and were derived from poly(A)+ libraries, and the genomic clone pGL71 overlaps the G and L (scRNA-1) genes. Evaluation of the nucleotide sequence of the SYNV G protein gene (Fig. 4) reveals the presence of a 2045nt-long cistron extending from positions 5 1 1 1 to 7 155, relative to the 3'end of the viral (minus sense) genome. The 5' end of the mRNA consists of a tetranucleotide (5'~AACU-3') which is identical to the tetranucleotide FIG. 3. Analysis of SYNV G protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels. Panels A and B are duplicate gels representing the SYNV glycoprotein (G), the SYNV structural proteins (S), and in-frame (I) or out-of-frame (0) j3-galactosidase fusions of a cDNA clone of the G gene with (+) and without (-) induction by IPTG. Protein molecular weight standards are indicated in kilodaltons (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA). Panel A represents a gel stained for total protein with Coomassie brilliant blue. Panel B represents an electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membrane followed by immunoblot analysis with polyclonal ascites fluid containing antibodies to the SYNV G protein. All the proteins were disrupted in 2% SDS and resolved in 12.5% polyacryamide gels. found at the 5' end of the M 1 mRNA (scRNA-6) (Heaton et al., 1989; Hillman et al., 1990) . This sequence differs slightly from the 5' ends of the N gene (scRNA-3) and the M2 gene (scRNA-5) which begin with the tetranucleotide 5'-AACA-3' . Sequence analysis indicates that an untranslated leader sequence of 34 nt precedes the first AUG (start codon) of the G protein ORF (Fig. 4) . As with the other SYNV leader sequences, the G mRNA leader is rich in adenine and uracil, which comprise 27 of the 34 residues. In addition to the translational start AUG at positions 35 to 37, an AUG codon is in the same frame at positions 47 to 49. Neither codon occurs in a more favorable context according to Kozak's rules for translational initiation (Kozak, 1981 (Kozak, , 1984 but the first AUG is in a slightly better context when compared to the AUG consensus flanking sequence for plant genes (5'-UAAACAAUGGCU-3') compiled by Joshi (1987) and Lutcke et a/. (1987) . Usage of the 5'-most AUG would permit synthesis of a putative signal peptide similar in size and hydrophobicity to the proposed glycoprotein signal peptides of VSV, infectious hematopoietic ne-crosis virus (IHNV), rabies, and Sigma virus of Drosophila (Rose and Gailione, 1981; Keener et al., 1987; Anilionis et al., 1981; Teninges and Bras-Her-ten@, 1987) so we presume that translation is initiated at this start site. The translational reading frame, starting with the first AUG, can encode a protein of 632 amino acids from an ORF of 1896 nt (Fig. 4) . The first transla%ionaf stop codon (UGA) is located on the genome at nt position 7041 to 7043 and is followed by h/v0 in-phase stop codons (UAA) at nt positions 7068 to 7070 and 7125 to 7127. Alternative reading frames present in the ORF could potentially encode polypeptides no larger than 47 amino acids. The 3' end of the mRNA, excluding the poly(A) tract, corresponds to position 7 155 on the SYNV genome as determined by evaluation of a cDNA clone (pAS3-9) derived by oligo-dT priming of pofy(A)+ RNA from SYNV-infected Nicotiana edwardsonii plants. The pAS3-9 clone contains the consensus mRNA gene junction 3' end (5'-AUAAGAAAAA-3') plus a potyadenylic stretch of 26 nt. Thus, the G protein mRNA, excluding the poly(A) tail, is 2045 nt long and represents the second largest cistron on the SYNV genome. As is the case for the N protein mRNA (scRNA-3) the G protein mRNA (scRNA-2) has a putative polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) beginning 33 nt upstream from the poly(A) stretch at nucleotide position 7 123. Since SYNV mR#As are presumably transcribed in the nucleus and the N protein mRNA has a polyadenylation signal we previously postulated that SYNV might utilize this signal to initiate polyadenylation by host enzymes. However, since the M2 and M 1 (Hillman et a/., 1990) protein mRNAs lack a polyadenylation signal, the occurrence of this signal may be fortuitous. The animal rhabdoviruses that have been analyzed (Rose and Gailione, 1981; Tordo et al., 1986; Koener ef al., 1987; Teninges and Bras-Herreng, 1987; ) have a cytoplasmic mode of replication and lack the putative polyadenylation signal, yet the mRNAs of these viruses are polyadenylated. Moreover, evidence has been accumulated (Banerjee, 1987; Emerson, 1987) suggesting that polyadenylation of VSV occurs via potymerase slippage or "chattering" along the uracil tract of the gene-junction sequence. We heve no direct evidence for such a mechanism with SYNV, but the similarity of the SYNV gene-junction sequences to those of other rhabdoviruses (Heaton et a/., 1989) soggeets that the members of this group all utilize common mechanisms for termination of transcription, polyadenyiation, and initiation of downstream mRNA transcription. In addition to the primary clones, two recently iso- FIG. 4. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the SYNV G protein gene numbered relative to the 3'terminus of the minus sense SYNV genome. The nucleotide sequence is presented in the positive sense and corresponds to positions 5111 to 7155. The slashed area (/I) represents the putative signal sequence cleavage site; the underlined regions correspond to putative glycosylation signals (Asn-X-SerIThr). the putative transmembrane anchor domain is in bold type (amino acids 570 to 594) and the bold-underlined region corresponds to a possible nuclear targeting signal. A second possible translational start site is represented by (M), and the asterisk (*) represents the translational stop lated subclones (pGT572 and pGT573) spanning the entire G gene (Fig. 1) were partially sequenced on both strands to provide confirmatory sequence. The clone pGT572 was sequenced from nt 5111 to 5201, 5522 to 6215, and 6555 to 7158 and differences in the nucleotide sequence were located at nt 5798 (C to A) and at nt 5808 (T to C), which respectively maintained the amino acids alanine and leucine. A third substitution at nt 6046 (C to A) resulted in an amino acid change from alanine to aspartic acid. These changes did not affect the predicted open reading frame of the G gene. However, the addition of an adenine on pGT572 at nt 6922 results in a change of the reading frame deduced from the sequence of pAS3-9 and PAT-Kl and shortens the predicted ORF by 30 amino acids. To provide additional sequence in this region, the other recent G gene clone, pGT573, was sequenced from nt 6789 to 7044 and no additions or substitutions of nucleotides occurred that differed from the originally sequenced material. Since three of four clones are in agreement it seems likely that the additional adenine observed in clone pGT572 either is an inconsistency that occurred during the replication of the viral genomic RNA in the host plant or is an artifact of cDNA cloning.
