Method validation was established by monitoring continuous NADH oxidation initiated by addition of the substrate pyruvic acid (3mM) in the presence of varying enzyme concentration/time (Fig. 1a) A screening validation process was established using 0.02 U/ml LDH-A over 75 minutes (Fig. 1b ) ± a known inhibitor; oxalic acid ( Fig. 1c) . The data shows a slow but steady rate of reaction, resulting in time dependent O.D. decay over 65-70 minutes with high signal/noise ratio. Although the enzyme used in this screening, was described as a recombinant full length Human LDHA (amino acids 1-332) with N terminal His tag; 352 amino acids with tag, MW 38.8 kDa: Enzyme Commission (EC) Number 1.1.1.27 (BRENDA | IUBMB) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), we confirmed the identity of the enzyme using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation (MALDI) Mass Spec (MS/MS) and analysis by Mascot ID (Fig. 2) . Fig. 2 (Top panel) shows the 1 D SDS page gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme at three concentrations (right), along with a molecular marker standard (left). The gel band was excised, digested and analyzed by MSMS for peptide sequence and protein identify (Bottom Panel). The data showed a positive hit for human LDH-A with a 95% confidence interval for peptide/sequence mass. A high throughput enzyme micro-array model was used in this work. Over 900 extracts of equal concentration (0.5 mg/ml) were dissolved in buffered HBSS and incubated with the enzyme, for 5 minutes prior to start of the reaction. After addition of the substrate, a curve for time dependent product formation was monitored continuously over 75 minutes. Fig. 3 represents the 75 minute reading taken from the original screening with values for each compound sorted according to inhibitory potency. Of the initially tested extracts, only 115 inhibited LDH-A within the first tier below 50% of control, denoted by red dotted line --- (Fig. 3) . These plant extracts were then subject to a second tier screenings (final concentration = 0.25 mg/ml), third tier screenings (final concentration =0.1 mg/ml) and fourth tier screenings (final concentrations with extended range at 0.006 to 0.16 mg/ml) to which regression analysis was used to calculate IC 50 s. Of the 115 retested, 46 extracts showed an IC 50 <0.077 mg/ml Table 1 as listed by potency rank. Full inhibitory dose response curves are shown for the top four inhibitors (Fig. 4) .
