Compounds 1a-k were synthesized by refluxing the corresponding b-ketoester and the substituted phenylhydrazine hydrochloride in acetic acid. 29 The pyrazolones were treated with the appropriate aromatic aldehyde in presence of piperidine in ethanol to obtain target compounds 2a-u in 70-87% yields. 30 From the preliminary investigation, as summarized in Table 1 , we noted that compounds with substituent R 2 , carboxyl group at 4th position in benzylidene aryl ring shows significant inhibition against SARS-CoV 3CL pro . Compounds having R 1 substitution like halogens, cyano, and nitro group increase the inhibitory action (see Table 1 ). Compound 2p is the most potent inhibitor showing an IC 50 of 5.5 lM and 2t is the second with IC 50 of 6.8 lM against SARS-3CoV 3CL pro . Interestingly, 2u showed inhibitory activity significantly against both SARS-3CoV 3CL pro (IC 50 = 8.4 lM) and CVB3 3C pro (IC 50 = 9.6 lM). The cytotoxicity of the test compounds was tested by performing the MTT assay and found that all compounds are devoid of cytotoxicity at 200 lM. In search of a computer model of the associated complex between the compound 2u and the proteases to rationalize its inhibitory activities, the orientation of the ligand has the N1-phenyl group situated in the S1 0 pocket of the 3CL pro . One of the oxygen of the nitro group is in close proximity 2.7 Å and forms H-bond to the Gly-143 ( Fig. 2A) . The C@O in the central pyrazolone ring is close to Glu-166 with the distance of 3.0 Å to form a H-bond. C-3 phenyl ring fits into the S2 pocket, having hydrophobic interactions with Met-49, Arg-188, and Gln-189 (hiding behind these resides in Fig. 2A ). The carboxyl benzylidene group is situated in the S3 pocket of the 3CL pro . The oxygen of the carboxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Gln-192 at a distance of  Piperidine EtOH Scheme 1. General synthesis of compounds 2a-u. 3.2 Å. It is important for inhibition activity since the compounds lacking carboxy functionality in the benzylidene lost the activity. Electron withdrawing R 1 substituents like cyano (2p), fluoro (2t), and nitro (2u), accompanied with R 2 carboxyl group favors the inhibitory activity. In further evaluating the inhibitors against CVB3 3C pro , we found 2p and 2t were moderate inhibitors against CVB3 3C pro (IC 50 = 20.8 and 22.4 lM, respectively), but 2u was more active against CVB3 3C pro (IC 50 = 9.6 lM). According to the modeling shown in Figure 2B , the R 1 nitro group of 2u forms H-bond with Gly-145 (2p and 2t without nitro group fail to form such a H-bond) and benzylidene carboxylate of 2u is H-bonded to Glu-71 in the active site of 3C pro . It was predicted that the C-3 phenyl ring of 2u is pointed to S1 site and the carboxyl benzylidene group is relocated to S2 in order to form the H-bond in 3C pro due to the subtle differences between the structures of 3CL pro and 3C pro . 7 However, it should be noted that computer modeling is speculation based on energy minimization to fit the SAR data. In conclusion, 2p and 2t are selective against 3CL pro , but 2u is a common inhibitor of 3CL pro and 3C pro , which may be potentially developed into anti-coronaviral and anti-picornaviral drugs.
