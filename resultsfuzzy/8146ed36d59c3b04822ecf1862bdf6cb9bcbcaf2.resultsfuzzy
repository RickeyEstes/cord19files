Deletion and mutational analysis of the Q3928-S3929 cleavage site between nsp10 and nsp11/12 of IBV Introduction of point mutation and deletion into the P1 position of the IBV 3CLpro cleavage site between nsp10 and nsp11/12 was carried out either by replacing the P1 Gln residue with a Pro (Q3928P) and an Asn (Q3928N), respectively, or by deleting the P1-Gln (Î”Q3928) (Fig.  1a) . To check the effect of these manipulations on the cleavability of the substrate, IBV sequence (12100-12719 nucleotide) flanking this cleavage site was amplified by RT-PCR, and cloned into a vector in frame with a FLAG tag at the N-terminus (Fig. 1a) . To facilitate detection of the cleavage products, an additional T was inserted between nucleotides 12347 and 12348, resulting in the extension of the ORF1a frame to the end of the fragment (nucleotide position 12719) (Fig. 1a) . To analyze the 3CLpro-mediated processing, IBV 3CLpro was co-expressed with the mutant constructs in Vero cells using the recombinant vaccinia virus/T7 system. Western blotting analysis with anti-FLAG antibody showed that 3CLpro was able to completely cleave the wild type substrate; a cleavage product with predicted molecular mass of 9.1 kDa was detected (Fig. 1b, lane 2) . However, the enzyme failed to process the mutant substrates, as the same cleavage product was not detected in cells co-expressing 3CLpro and the three mutant constructs (Fig. 1b, lanes 3-5) .
