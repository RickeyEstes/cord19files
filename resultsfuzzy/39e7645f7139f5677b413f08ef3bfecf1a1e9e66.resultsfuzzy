The initial diagnostic routine was limited to testing for the influenza A virus matrix gene, without subtyping. In view of the severe course of illness, the child was resampled for repeated testing including typing of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene by quantitative real-time PCR for H1 (seasonal and pdm2009), H3, H5, H7 and H9. All typing PCRs were negative. We determined the full virus genome sequences of a cell culture isolate derived from a respiratory tract sample using Illumina MiSeq. All gene segments (GenBank accession numbers KY250316-KY250323) were 97-98% and 98-100% identical at, respectively, nucleotide and amino acid level to publicly available SIV sequences from the Netherlands (GISAID accession numbers EPI639351, EPI639914, EPI639917, EPI639930, EPI640657, EPI640912, EPI641210, EPI641215). The gene segments were all of the Eurasian avian A(H1N1) SIV lineage that has been circulating in pigs since 1979 [1] . Pigs at the farm visited by the patient tested positive for the same SIV (curation of full genome sequence data is in progress). The virus isolate from the patient, A/Netherlands/3315/2016, was sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir by NA-star neuraminidase inhibitor resistance detection assay (Applied Biosystems, Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel, The Netherlands).
