Previous study suggested that the infection of TGEV induces huge damage of mitochondrial in ST cells [22] , we investigated TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 to learn if they respond similarly. As shown as in Figure 1A and 1B, the level of membrane electric potential (Δψ), decrease at 12 hours after TGEV infection, reaches a minimum at 24 hours, despite treated with ciclosporin A (CsA) or not. The decrease of Δψ could be partial suppressed by CsA (a strong stabilizer of Δψ) treatment. The reduction of membrane potential is often associated with cell apoptosis. However, the expected apoptosis does not occur after TGEV infection ( Figure 1C ). The total mitochondrial mass is another important factor to contribute Δψ. Using MitoTracker Green FM (total mitochondria) and MitoTracker Red CMXRos (functional mitochondria), we found that the tendency of total mitochondrial mass is similar with that of Δψ after TGEV infection ( Figure  1E ) and the ratio of dysfunctional mitochondria does not change significantly ( Figure 1D ). The decrease of total mitochondrial mass indicated mitochondria degradation, which usually performed by autophagy. To confirm whether mitochondria were damaged and degraded by autophagy after TGEV infection, the ultrastructure of mock-or TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells was observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM). As shown as in Figure 1F , swollen mitochondria and mitochondria lacking cristae were observed after TGEV infection, indicative of injured mitochondria. We also observed double membrane vesicles surrounding mitochondria in TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells ( Figure  1F ). We suggest that these are autophagosome-like or mitophagosome-like vesicles. The mitophagosomelike vesicles were rarely observed in mock-infected cells ( Figure 1G ). The microscopy data are summarized quantitatively in Figure 1F , which shows the numbers of dysfunctional mitochondria observed in mock and infected cells. Together, these data suggest that TGEV infection induce mitochondrial damage and may induce selected elimination of damaged mitochondria by autophagy.
