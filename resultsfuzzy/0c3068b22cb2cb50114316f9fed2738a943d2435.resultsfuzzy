Regarding the following 5 outcomes, the duration of invasive ventilation, total duration of mechanical ventilation, LOS in ICU, LOS in hospital, and hospital costs, statistical heterogeneities were noted in the metaanalysis results. We considered the level of inconsistency to be serious and downgraded the evidence quality for these outcomes. Seventeen RCTs involving 959 patients were identified for this review. Meta-analyses indicated using noninvasive ventilation at PIC window could significantly reduce mortality, VAP, weaning failures, reintubations, duration of invasive ventilation, total duration of mechanical ventilation, LOS in ICU, and LOS in hospital as well as hospital costs. Meanwhile, less adverse events were observed for patients receiving noninvasive ventilation than those receiving continuous invasive ventilation. Prolonged invasive ventilation is positively related to VAP, [47] and persistent weaning failure may occur as a consequence [48] and mortality probably increases subsequently. [49, 50] Noninvasive ventilation is applied by an nasal or oronasal cannula, or full facial mask. It does not need an artificial airway, and provides partial ventilatory support for patients who have obtained the ability to continue spontaneous breathing but still require ventilator support. [6] In this study, we found that timely extubation and immediate use of noninvasive ventilation significantly reduced the duration of invasive ventilation of 6 days. Consequently, both the incidence of VAP and mortality were reduced, higher successful weaning rates were also observed. In the meantime, the total duration of mechanical ventilation was decreased by 6 days. The reuse of a tracheal tube may exacerbate the existing damage to the tracheal mucosa. [51] Because noninvasive ventilation does not require tracheal intubation, the cough reflex is hence preserved, and it has been applied in patients with respiratory failure, effectively improving oxygenation and ventilation and reducing reintubation rates. [52] This study also proved that patients using noninvasive ventilation occurred less reintubations than those receiving invasive ventilation. Important benefits from noninvasive ventilation included the reductions of VAP and length of ICU or hospital stay, which closely associated with medical costs. [53] There was strong evidence to indicate that noninvasive ventilation was costeffective.

All trials included in this review selected PIC window as switch point. Pulmonary infection is the main cause of acute exacerbations of COPD in China. The appearance of PIC window demonstrates pulmonary infection is significantly controlled. Hence, airway secretion drainage is not a main issue and patients probably do not require tracheal tube. [11] Timely removal of endotracheal tube and application of noninvasive ventilation at this period of time might not only continue supplying ventilator support and alleviate respiratory muscle fatigue, [11] but also avoid associated infection and reduce the duration of invasive ventilation. [12] We found beneficial effects of using noninvasive ventilation at this timing on each assessed outcome in this review. Meanwhile, what needs to be highlighted is to accurately judge the presence of PIC window and to immediately change invasive support to noninvasive ventilation. Clinicians should clearly understand the criteria for "window" [10] and carefully observe the clinical characteristics of patients and monitor the indicators of PIC window. [53] Once missed the "window," VAP might occur later, patients' condition would relapse, and the duration of invasive ventilation would be prolonged, resulting in ventilator dependence and consequent weaning failure. [12] In addition, successful use of noninvasive ventilation in patients largely depends on clinician's experience. [2] A number of published studies showed that noninvasive ventilation performed by highly motivated and experienced caring teams often worked more effectively for ARF, [53] whereas less experienced use of noninvasive ventilation often led to higher reintubation rates. [54, 55] It should therefore be applied by well-trained and highly skilled medical staff to avoid intolerance and other common adverse effects.
