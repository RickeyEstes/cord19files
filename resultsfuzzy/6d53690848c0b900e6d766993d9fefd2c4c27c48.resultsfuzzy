Recently, an unusual three-stemmed pseudoknot has been identified that promotes programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting in the SARS Coronavirus (13) . The pseudoknot is thought to pause the ribosome during translation, which then shifts back by one nucleotide on the 'slippery site'. This special pseudoknot seems to be conserved in all Coronaviruses, and thus could be a target for anti-viral therapeutics. The 3-stem topology is predicted by pknotsRG as the optimal structure with an energy of Ã€31.8 kcal/mol (Figure 1 ), using either the MFE or the enforced mode.
