(a) Library cDNA clones To characterize the mouse CEA-related gene family, we screened a CD-1 mouse colon cDNA library (~eauchemin et al., 1989) . This yielded a significant number of cDNA clones (i.e., 392), some of which presented different restriction patterns or different cDNA sequences. To verify if these cDNA clones were representative of other mouse CEA-related genes, clones 23, 32, 37, 58 and 64 were completely sequenced while clone 132 was partially sequenced. As shown in Fig. 1 p some of these clones (clones 23 and 132) overlapped perfectly within sequences encoding either the signal sequence, the N terminal or the A2 domain of the BgpA cDNA (formerly mmCGMla) (McCuaig et al., 1992) , while others (clones 23, 32, 37, 58 and 64) were aligned with DNA coding for either the leader, the N-terminal, the A2, the TM, the Cyt domains or the 3'UTR sequence of another published cDNA clone, BgpB (formerly mmCGM2) (Turbide et al., 1991) . Clone 23 extended the published BgpB cDNA 3'UTR (Turbide et al., 1991) by 119 nt and ended in a poly(A) tail. Another cDNA clone (clone 58) encoded a longer Cyt (73 aa) than the previously reported 10 aa Cyt domain (Turbide et al., 1991; McCuaig et al., 1992) ; this new mouse Cyt domain, however, resembled closely the cDNA sequence of human BGP (Barnett et al., 1989) and of a rat ecto-ATPase cDNA (Lin and Guidotti, 1989) . Clones 32 and 64 also encoded conserved but not identical Al and Bl domains when compared to similar domains of the BgpA cDNA. cDNA clone 37 demonstrated high homology to the reported 3' UTR of the MHVR isolated from Balb/c mice (Dveksler et al., 1991) , but extended this sequence by 199 nt to another poIy~A) tail.
