Representative zymograms from the CSF and from the cerebellum/cerebellar peduncles of dogs are shown in Fig. 2A and B. Zymographic assays revealed gelatinolytic activity related to enzymes with molecular weights of 92 kDa (pro-MMP-9), 86 kDa (active MMP-9), 72 kDa (pro-MMP-2), and 66 kDa (active MMP-2). In the CSF, the levels of pro-MMP-2 in the infected dogs were significantly higher than in the control dogs (P = 0.0039). For active MMP-2, even though there was no difference between Table 1 Panel of antibodies used in this study to characterize astrocytes, T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, and matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 in the in the cerebellum of dogs with subacute distemper leukoencephalitis. Polyclonal rabbit anti-human MMP-9 MMP-9 (active and pro-forms) Ready-to-use Tris-EDTA-Tween pH 9.0 in steamer for 30 min NeoMarkers, RB-9234-R7 groups (P = 0.1910), the levels of this enzyme were elevated in some infected dogs. Regarding pro-and active MMP-9, these enzymes were not detected or detected in an inconsistent way in a few infected samples. Pro-MMP-9 presented no difference between infected and control dogs (P = 0.2838), and active MMP-9, although not present in the control group, showed no difference between groups (P = 0.2642) (Fig. 2C ). In the cerebellum/cerebellar peduncles, the control group presented only faint 92 kDa bands corresponding to pro-MMP-9. The infected group showed gelatinolytic bands with molecular weights consistent with pro-MMP-9, active MMP-9, and pro-MMP-2. Comparing the groups, the infected dogs presented higher levels of pro-MMP-9 (P = 0.0002) and pro-MMP-2 (P = 0.0005) than the control dogs. For active MMP-9, even if there was detection in infected animals, its levels were statistically similar to those in the control animals (P = 0.1282; Fig. 2D ). This study, according to the authors' knowledge, is the first to use zymography to evaluate MMP-2 and MMP-9 during subacute distemper leukoencephalitis. Zymographic analysis of MMP-2 and MMP-9 allowed the identification of these enzymes according to their molecular weights. In fact, this method was sensitive enough to allow the distinction between the active and the pro-forms of MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Kleiner and Stetler-Stevenson, 1994) . In agreement with Bergman et al. (2002) , only the pro-form of MMP-2 was detected in the CSF of the clinically healthy dogs, whereas MMP-9 was not detectable in any form. During distemper leukoencephalitis, in the CSF, increased activity of pro-MMP-2 was predominantly noticed; on the other hand, pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 were highly detected in the cerebellum/cerebellar peduncles, although active MMP-9 was also detected in some samples. MMPs are involved in the pathogenesis of several viral infections in the CNS and the imbalance between MMPs and TIMPs has been reported not only in humans with immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections (Conant et al., 1999) , but also in experimental murine infection with Japanese encephalitis virus (Shukla et al., 2012) , coronavirus (Marten and Zhou, 2005) and West Nile virus (Wang et al., 2008) . The detection of pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 in the cerebellum/cerebellar peduncles in this study is in agreement with Miao et al. (2003) , that, by immunohistochemistry, detected an up-regulated expression of MMPs-1, -2, -3, -7, -9, -12, -13 and -14 in the brain of dogs with distemper, in a phase-dependent manner. However, IHC detects both active and pro-forms of MMPs together, whereas zymography is clearly able to differentially detect them. By means of IHC, it was possible to detect in which cell population the MMPs were present. Faint cytoplasmatic MMP-2-staining was noticed in mononuclear cells, ependymal cells and in rod cells with microglial morphology (Fig. 2E) . However, the main MMP-2-positive cell population was composed of mononuclear cells in the white and gray matter and in the leptomeninges, with more intense staining in areas of malacia and demyelination (Fig. 2F ). MMP-9 presented diffuse staining in areas of malacia (Fig. 2G ) and cytoplasmatic staining in inflammatory cells inside blood vessels, in Gitter cells within the demyelination plaques, and in some neurons, ependymal cells and perivascular cells (Fig. 2H) . IHC also facilitated the identification and quantification of inflammatory cells trafficking through the cerebellum. An important component of the inflammatory infiltrate at the injured tissue was the CD3 + T lymphocytes, which were detected mainly in the perivascular cuffs and diffusely distributed along the demyelinization plaques. The perivascular infiltration was two to three cell layers thick (Fig. 3A) . However, in some dogs, with the progression of demyelination, the vacuoles seemed to push the cells around them, and T lymphocytes were distributed in clusters in these cases. These cells comprised 0.46% of the immunostained area in the infected group, while the control group presented only 0.03%, representing a significant difference (P = 0.0020; Fig. 3C ). B lymphocytes were mainly observed in the leptomeninges and within the perivascular cuffs, also two to three cell layers thick (Fig. 3B) , and even if in smaller number than T cells, CD79␣ + B lymphocytes were detected at higher levels in the infected group than the control group (P = 0.0140; Fig. 3C ). With regards to astrocytes, the main cerebellar alteration was astrogliosis. The presence of intranuclear inclusions (Fig. 1D ) and gemistocytic cells was also a frequent finding. The astrocytes in the infected dogs presented an increase in the cytoplasm volume and in the length of the cytoplasmatic processes, and also a more intense cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 3D) . The GFAP immunoreactivity in the astrocytes of the infected dogs comprised an area of 2.18%, while the area of the control dogs consisted of 1.15%, characterizing a significant difference (P = 0.0003; Fig. 3F ). Regarding macrophages/microglial cells, there was positive detection in only 4 out of 14 infected dogs, within and around the demyelination plaques (as Gitter cells) (Fig. 3E) . No positive staining was noticed in the control group. Since the pathogenesis of distemper leukoencephalitis is phase-dependent, the source of MMPs within the CNS may vary according to the time of infection. MMP-9, MMP-14 and TIMP-1 are expressed mostly in astrocytes and in macrophages/microglia in initial lesions, while infiltrating lymphocytes as well as activated macrophages/microglia are the main source of these components in advanced distemper leukoencephalitis (Gröters et al., 2005) . The production of active MMP-2 and MMP-9 by T cells, monocytes and dendritic cells is required for their migration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and their subsequent invasion of the CNS compartment (Rosemberg, 2002; Stamatovic et al., 2008) . By immunohistochemistry, we detected MMP-2 and MMP-9 preferentially in mononuclear cells. Nevertheless, the role of MMPs within the CNS may start prior to leukocyte infiltration. In canine inflammatory brain lesions, microglial cells expressed a variety of MMPs and TIMPs mRNAs, including MMP-2 and MMP-9; and some dogs also presented MMP-2 activity in brain-zymography (Stein et al., 2011) . Further, in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis (TME), a virus-induced model of multiple sclerosis, after stereotaxic injection of activated MMP-3, -9, and -12 into the caudal cerebellar peduncle of adult mice, the authors noticed a focally extensive primary demyelination, before the infiltration of inflammatory cells, as well as a reduction in the number of oligodendrocytes (Hansmann et al., 2012) . In demyelination, MMPs also act in myelin basic protein fragmentation (Shiryaev et al., 2009) . Due to the morphological similarities between canine distemper demyelinating leukoencephalitis and human demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, canine distemper represents one of the few animal models for spontaneous demyelinating diseases to study the pathogenesis of myelin loss associated with immunomediated mechanisms . In multiple sclerosis, MMP-9 seems to play a critical role in early lesions (Cossins et al., 1997) , whereas MMP-2 seems to have an ambiguous role in initial and advanced lesions (Lindberg et al., 2001) . Further, blood monocytes from patients with multiple sclerosis showed an elevated level of several MMPs, including MMP-1, -3, -7 and -9 (Kouwenhoven et al., 2001) . The characterization of separate roles for individual MMPs is complicated by the wide variation of expression patterns, kinetics, substrate, and cell specificity in different inflammatory settings (Savarin et al., 2011) . By zymography, there was no way of detecting a constant profile of MMPs in the CSF and the cerebellar tissue of the dogs and establishing a secure biomarker for the subacute inflammatory phase of the CDV infection; however, pro-MMP-2 was present in most of the CSF samples and pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 were increased in the cerebellum. The MMPs/TIMPs imbalance may contribute to the complex mechanisms enrolled in distemper leukoencephalitis and therapies based on metalloproteinase inhibitors for dogs may be an additional aid to help in the recovery or stop the progression of the lesions in animals in the acute phase of disease.
