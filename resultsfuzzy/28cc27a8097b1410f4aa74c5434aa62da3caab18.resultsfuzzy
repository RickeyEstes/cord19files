2.1. Preparation of N-thienylmethyl-6-oxopipecolinic acids 14a,b We firstly planned access to the requisite N-thienylmethyl-6oxopipecolinic acids 14a,b for the Rapoport cyclization by the known protocol. 7, 17 This comprises N-reductive amination by mixing commercially available (S)-2-aminoadipic acid (12) and 2(or 3)-thienaldehyde in aqueous alkaline media (NaOH 2 M), addition of sodium borohydride to the same media, followed by intramolecular N-acylation of the resulting N-thienylmethyl-aminoadipic acids 13a,b (Scheme 2). The cyclization of dicarboxylic acids 13a,b was performed by refluxing in ethanol for 8 h. To our surprise and contrary to the reaction profile obtained in the literature for similar sequences, 7,17 the reaction was incomplete (after cooling a small amount of unreacted (S)-2-aminoadipic acid (12) was obtained) and we observed after processing of the reaction mixture the expected carboxylic acids 14a,b (in 79% and 76% isolated yields, respectively) in addition to N-substituted amino acids 13a,b in 9/1 ratio. Complete cyclization of 13a,b to 14a,b was carried out by heating in water at reflux for 4 h. Interestingly, the structure of both carboxylic acids 14a and 14b was secured by an X-ray crystallographic analysis 18 (see also the ORTEP drawing of 14a,b in the ESI part). Hence the possible epimerisation at the a-position of the cyclic lactam-acid under alkaline and thermal conditions can be excluded.
