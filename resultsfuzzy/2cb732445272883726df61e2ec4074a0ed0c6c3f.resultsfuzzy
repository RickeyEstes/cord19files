Six calves died within the first 4 weeks of the experiment: two in Group 1, one in Group 2 and three in Group 3. Antigens found at autopsy are given in Table 2 . Serum immunoglobulin content of these calves was low in comparison with those in the calves which survived (P< 0.01 ) ( Table 3) . These data correspond with those reported by Brignole and Stott (1980) , and emphasize the importance of colostrum for the newborn calf. Low serum Ig levels can be the consequence of a lack of CO feeding, an advanced age at first feeding (Stott et al., 1979a,b) , or a failure to absorb Ig (Brignole and Stott, 1980) . The serum immunoglobulin concentrations during the experiment are presented in Table 4 . At no time was there a significant difference in serum Ig concentrations. This meant that serum Ig level could not be affected by oral administration some days post-partum. These findings confirm the fact that closure of intestinal permeability to colostral Ig in the calf occurs spontaneously with age from 12 h post-partum (Stott et al., 1979a) . For 31 of the 50 calves, virus shedding took place from the first few days after arrival (Table 5 ) . During the first 3 weeks of the trial, virus and Cryptosporidium infection were observed in almost all calves of the three groups, without any difference in respect of the treatment (Table 6) . Duration and frequency of diarrhoea were not influenced by the treatment (Table 7) . Forty-four of the 50 calves presented diarrhoea. In 27 of them, the diarrhoea lasted for 2-7 days and in 14 calves for > 7 days. The effects of treatments on daily gain and weaning age are compiled in Table 8 . Average daily gain was not significantly affected during the first 6 weeks of the treatment, although some effect could be expected from Ig and CO within these initial weeks in view of the widespread virus excretion. From the seventh week, there was no impact on live-weight gain. During this period, a positive effect owing to the previous feeding of Ig and CO was hardly expected since the animal's own immune system begins to develop at about 3 weeks of age. For the 20 weeks of the experiment, daily live-weight gain averaged 0.84, 0.84 and 0.83 kg, respectively, for the three groups. There was no significant effect on weaning age. This is an indication that calf starter intake during the initial period of the experiment corresponded well between the three groups. Mean daily intake of dry matter and net energy (NE1) was similar for all groups. Consequently, this was also true for feed efficiency (Table 9 ). The similar feed conversion suggests that, if there was some malabsorption owing to villous atrophy by virus infection (Mebus et al., 1975) , treatment effect on intestinal absorption of nutrients and energy was not different. Otherwise, the protective effect of Ig and CO was doubtful in these circumstances. The relationship between initial serum Ig concentration and performance was small, when the data of the 44 surviving calves were pooled. The correlation coefficient between the serum Ig level at the start, and daily gain during the initial 6 weeks and the complete experiment amounted to 0.223 and 0.302. For the same periods, the correlation coefficients between Ig level and energy conversion were -0.180 and -0.004. It is possible that the serum Ig concentration analysed at the start of the experiment was not a true indication of the concentration at Day 1 after birth because of the finite half life of Ig and the fact that the exact age of the calves at purchase was not known. The protective activity of colostrum, milk or serum Ig administered during the first weeks of life against viral neonatal diarrhoea has been confirmed by several authors. Snodgrass et al. (1980 Snodgrass et al. ( , 1982b stated that diarrhoea started later, that the frequency, duration and severity of diarrhoea diminished markedly, and that body weight improved in calves fed during the first 2 weeks with 10% colostrum from rotavaccinated cows. Snodgrass et al. (1982a) , Snodgrass (1986a, b) , Soulebot et al. (1983) and Btirki et al. (1986) observed good protection against viral diarrhoea following continued feeding of immune milk from vaccinated cows during the first weeks of life. Vanopdenbosch and Wellemans (1981) reported on a similar experiment in 24 problem herds, that the percentage of diarrhoea decreased from 79 to 27, the onset of diarrhoea was retarded from Day 4 until Day 9, the average duration of diarrhoea decreased from 13 to 2 days and the mortality rate from 29% to 1%. Theys et al. (1983) described similar results in an experiment with veal calves fed with milk replacer that contained serum from slaughtered calves hyperimmunized against rota-and coronavirus. The exact mechanism explaining the discrepancy between the local prophylactic effect of Ig in the intestine, reported in the literature and the non-protective effect in our experiment is not clear. It is possible that the Ig supplementation was too small. An amount of 4 g Ig was fed daily to calves averaging 49.1 kg live-weight in our experiment. In an experiment with neonate pigs, which were removed from their dams at birth, 10 g Ig were fed kg-1 body weight on Day 1, and 2 g on Days 2-10 (Elliot et al., 1987) . Survival in piglets in the test group was 78% vs. 39% in the control group. From birth to 21 days, the test group realized a 40% higher weight gain. Obviously, 0.5-g y-globulin was not sufficient to affect survival in piglets (Varley et al., 1986 ) . It is also possible that the effectiveness of Ig was small in our experiment because antibodies did not correspond with antigens, or titres were not high enough. Since Ig were provided by a dairy factory and produced by large populations of cows, we suppose that Ig were active against most important strains of pathogens. Another reason could be that the prophylactic effect failed to appear in this trial because of the largely extended infections. In such a situation, Ig may be degraded in the intestinal lumen by microorganisms. This mechanism was mentioned by James et al. (1976) , but it is not clear whether bacteria and viruses behave similarly. In our calves, 31 of 50 were excreting rota-and/or coronaviruses at the start of the trial (first faecal collection). Hence, it is possible that Ig administration started too late to exert any protective effect. In this context, Donnelly (1987) suggested that the local role of Ig appear to be prophylactic by preventing the establishment of new pathogens, but they may have little effect on pathogens which are already established. According to Logan and Pearson (1978) , it is possible that Ig exert their protective function by forming an immunological barrier which prevents the adhesion at or the penetration into villi by enteropathogenic microorganisms. Besides Ig, colostrum contains other non-specific inhibitory systems, such as lysozyme, lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase, xanthine oxidase, vitamin B12 and folate protein binders (Reiter, 1978) . Therefore, a broader protective role by CO than by Ig alone could be expected. However, CO was not of excellent quality, as it contained only 44 mg Ig ml-1 (Fleenor and Stott, 1980) . This can be explained by the fact that CO from the first six milkings post-partum was pooled. Based on the data of Stott et al. (1981) for pooled CO of six milkings post-partum, an average Ig concentration of 28.6 mg ml-1 can be calculated. As a consequence, the daily Ig administration in Group 3 ( + 2.2 g) was lower ;~55 than in Group 2. Obviously, non-specific inhibitors in CO were not capable of making up for this lack of protection. We suppose that the main reason for the failure of any protective effect of pure Ig or CO in these purchased calves is due to the gap between the CO feeding at birth and the start of the experiment, coupled with the fact that the calves were infected in the meantime. This necessitates the administration of pure Ig following up CO feeding after birth, or the continuation of feeding small amounts of CO.
