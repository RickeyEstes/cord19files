As well as strain variation leading to discrepant results (see text), discrepancies may arise when serology and PCR are compared: ✜ Seropositive/PCR negative results may be explained by the presence of an FIV subtype not recognised by the PCR, rather than by the absence of FIV infection. This aspect is important if a cat has been vaccinated against FIV abroad. ✜ Seronegative/PCR positive results may also be found when cats living in close contact with FIVinfected seropositive cats become provirus positive without developing antibodies or disease. 44 Such cats are infected and will usually seroconvert weeks to months later.
