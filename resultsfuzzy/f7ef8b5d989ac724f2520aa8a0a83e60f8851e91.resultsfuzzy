We have developed a protocol for synthesizing site-specific isotopically labeled purine nucleotides with varied ribose and base patterns (Supplementary Figure S1 ). In principle any combination of labeled base and ribose can be utilized, but here we demonstrate the use of both 1 ,8-13 C and 2 ,8-13 C purine and 1 ,6-13 C and 2 ,6-13 C pyrimidine nucleotides for assignment, structural, and dynamics measurements. These labeling patterns both remove the strong 13 C-13 C J-coupling found in uniformly labeled nucleotides and simultaneously reduce spectral crowding. The removal of 13 C J-coupling creates isolated spin systems in both the base and ribose, and enables the use of TROSY pulse sequences for studying large RNAs, and these TROSY modules can be readily incorporated into CPMG, R 1 and CEST pulse sequences for measuring s-ms timescale dynamics (68) (69) (70) (71) . In addition to the removal of strong J-couplings, the new labels help to greatly reduce spectral crowding and enable the creation of a new protocol for the NOESY assignment of RNAs. As a proof of this assignment concept, this protocol is demonstrated on the A-site RNA.
