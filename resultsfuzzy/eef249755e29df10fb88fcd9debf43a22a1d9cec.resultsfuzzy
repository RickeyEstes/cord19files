The anti-GL mAb used is a mouse monoclonal antibody and an IgG1 isotype with light chain and has a high affinity constant of 9.96 × 10 10 L/mol [30] . Fig. 2 shows the deflection profiles for antibody-antigen binding, where antibodies were immobilized using self-assembled monolayer (SAM), based on (a) thioglycolic acid (HSCH 2 COOH), (b) 6-mercaptohexanoic acid (HS(CH 2 ) 5 COOH), (c) 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (HS(CH 2 ) 10 COOH), and (d) 16mercaptohexadecanoic acid (HS(CH 2 ) 15 COOH) (corresponding to n = 1, 5, 10 and 15, respectively in Fig. 1 ). It can be seen that the functionalized microcantilevers rapidly bent, reaching an equilibrium bending signal. The bending occurs because the binding between GL antibody-antigen interactions produces a difference in surface stress between the functionalized surface on the top and the silicon surface on the back side of the microcantilever. The response of the microcantilever shows that the deflection increases significantly when the concentration of GL increases. It can be seen from Fig.  2 (a) that the microcantilever bent rapidly for higher concentration (100 ng/mL), reaching an equilibrium bending signal z ∼ 133 nm under constant flow conditions. For lower concentration (1 ng/mL), the bending of microcantilever was smaller ( z ∼ 64 nm). The other charts where the antibodies were immobilized via SAMs of other n-alkanethiols (n = 5, 10 and 15) in Fig. 2 show the same trend. To evaluate the specificity of the technique, reference microcantilever without antibody was exposed to 1000 ng/mL of GL. No significant response was observed, indicating little interferences from nonspecific small molecules on the microcantilever sensor (Fig. 2) . Licorice sample with four-year-old cultivated was detected with antibody immobilized using SAM based on the shortest alkanethiol (HSCH 2 COOH). The concentration of GL detected with the microcantilever was approximately 8.6 ng/mL (dark black curve in Fig. 2(a) ), and it was 10.16 ng/mL with icELISA [30] . The average recovery of GL determined with the microcantilever was 84.6%. Our investigation shows that microcantilevers based on the nanomechanical response have the sensitivity for label-free detection of GL and quantify the binding affinity of the GL antibody and GL as the antigen. Intermolecular interactions described by the Lennard-Jones potential, as well as hydration forces, steric, van der Waals force and electrostatic forces between adsorbates have been proposed as mechanisms for the origins of the observed surface stresses [1, 2, 19, 32] . The changes of surface hydrophobicity and conformation due to adsorbed molecules also play an important role [1, 33] . Whatever the origin of the surface stress is, after originating from intermolecular interaction in the receptor molecules film, the stress transmits through the linker between the receptor molecule and microcantilever surface, and then ultimately, arrives at microcantilever surface and causes the bending. As can be seen from the deflection profile of the microcantilevers, upon injection of 100 ng/mL GL antigen, the microcantilever functionalized with antibody via n-alkanethiols of n = 1 and 5 displayed the deflection z ∼ 133 nm and 115 nm, respectively, and the microcantilever functionalized via nalkanethiols of n = 10 and 15 only had the deflection z ∼ 70 nm and 29 nm, respectively. When the concentration of GL was 10 ng/mL, the microcantilever functionalized with antibody via n-alkanethiols of shortest chain (n = 1) displayed the maximum deflection ( z ∼ 99 nm) and the microcantilever functionalized via n-alkanethiols of longest chain (n = 15) had the smallest deflection ( z ∼ 10 nm). When the concentration was low to 1 ng/mL, the microcantilever functionalized with antibody via n-alkanethiols of n = 1 and 5 still had the deflection z ∼ 64 nm and 45 nm, respectively, while there were almost no response for the microcantilever functionalized via n-alkanethiols of n = 10 and 15. These results indicate that chain length of the n-alkanethiol have an important impact on the sensitivity of the microcantilever sensor. To determine whether the different n-alkanethiols cause the difference in the surface concentrations of immobilized antibodies which may affect the sensitivity of the microcantilever sensor, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used. The procedure and condition of antibody immobilization on the SPR-chip were the same as those on microcantilever. The binding of antibodies to the layer of n-alkanethiols produced the SPR responses of 2482 RU (n = 1), 2586 RU (n = 5), 2694 RU (n = 10) and 2484 RU (n = 15) (Fig. 3) , respectively. The results show that the surface concentrations of immobilized antibodies were almost equal for different n-alkanethiols used. Specifically, for n = 1 and n = 15, the SPR responses (2482 and 2484 RU) were equal, but the sensitivities of the microcantilever for n = 1 and 15 are very different. These indicate the difference in the sensitivity of the microcantilever sensor is not caused by different surface concentrations of immobilized antibodies but the chain length of n-alkanethiol. Different chain lengths of n-alkanethiol result in difference in chain lengths of the linker that is between the surface and the antibody. The stress (or strain) originates from antigen-antibody binding and is transmitted through the linker to the microcantilever surface, and ultimately, causes the microcantilever bending. Thus it can be seen that the length of the carbon chain plays a key role in the stress transmission. Fig. 4 shows the steady-state microcantilever deflection as a function of different GL concentration and different chain lengths of linker (n = 1, 5, 10, 15) that is between the surface and the antibody. Each point represents the average for three determinations and the error bars represent the standard deviation of data. It is clear to see that the sensitivity of the microcantilever increases significantly with decreasing chain length of linker. These findings suggest that short carbon chain transmits stress (or strain) more efficiently. This result is, to our knowledge, the first direct proof that the carbon chain length is very important for the transmission of mechanical response that originates from biochemical reaction. Our findings are of substantive importance, not only for microcantilever studies but for all investigations of biological interfaces, where the linker is a carbon chain. Although the Fig. 4 . Steady-state microcantilever deflection as a function of different GL concentration and different chain lengths of linker (n = 1, 5, 10 and 15) that is between the surface and the antibody. Each point represents the average for three determinations and the error bars represent the standard deviation of data. work presented herein is focused on biochemically well-defined interfaces, these findings will also be important for our understanding of mechanical signal transmission of biological interfaces and membranes. Fig. 5 (a) is still the steady-state microcantilever deflection as a function of different GL concentration and different chain lengths of linker. Here the abscissa axis is not the concentration, but the common logarithm of the concentration. It can be seen from the results that there is almost linear relationship between the deflection and the common logarithm of the concentration for every each chain length of linker. We can write a general product form for the microcantilever response, where k is a constant, C is the concentration of the antigen (GL), and A is related to the chain length of the linker and should be a function of the length. Fig. 5(b) shows the steady-state microcantilever deflection as a function of chain length of linker when the antigen concentrations were 10 and 100 ng/mL, respectively. For every each concentration, the response of the microcantilever increases significantly with decreasing chain length of linker, exhibiting negative linear relationship. Thus, we can also write another form for the microcantilever response where B is a positive constant and does not change with the concentration of the antigen, n is the carbon number (CH 2 ) of linker chain, and D is a constant value for the same concentration of antigen and different antigen concentrations correspond to different values of D. Thus D should be a function of the antigen concentration. By synthesizing Eqs. (1) and (2), we obtain the microcantilever deflection expressed as the function of the chain length of the linker and the antigen concentration where E is a constant. The constants k, C and B were constructed with deducing coefficients of least-square method. The comparison of fitting line and experimental microcantilever deflection data for each chain length is shown in Fig. 5(a) . The limit of detection (LOD) of the GL was calculated as a signal 3 times the background noises. In Fig. 5(a) , the LOD were the points at which the calculated lines and the lines of the 3 times the background noises intersected. The LODs for different chain length of linker were determined to be as low as 20 pg/mL (n = 1), 130 pg/mL (n = 5), 1.7 ng/mL (n = 10) and 10 ng/mL (n = 15), respectively, and the LOD for the shortest linker is 500 times lower than the longest linker. The LOD of conventional indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) for the antigen and antibody used here was 1.1 ng/mL [30] . The LOD of the microcantilever sensor (20 pg/mL) for the GL was 50 times lower than that of the corresponding icELISA. We can see that the chain length of linker has great influence on the LOD. By optimizing the chain length of linker, the LOD of the microcantilever sensor can be lowered significantly. This would be important for molecules detection at very low concentrations. Eq. (3) shows that there is a linear relationship between deflection and common logarithm of the concentration. This relationship indicates that with the increase of antigen concentration, the increment of microcantilever deflection becomes smaller. But the microcantilever deflection has a linear relationship with the chain length of linker. Therefore, the carbon chain length of the linker plays a key role in the stress transmission and has greater impact on the microcantilever sensitivity than the antigen concentration does.
