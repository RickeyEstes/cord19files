In short, the reduction in hospitalized days per person from 2000 to 2010 of 200.6% is contributed to by the decrease of mean duration of stay, and it is offset by -51.1% due to the slight growth in the frequency of public hospital admissions and -49.4% by the difference of hospital admission rates (see Table 2 ). 11 The results of decomposition stratified by age and gender are presented in Table 3 and Table 4 .  In short, the reduction in hospitalized days per person from 2000 to 2010 of 200.6% is contributed to by the decrease of mean duration of stay, and it is offset by -51.1% due to the Table 2 ). Further analysis showed that the reduction of the mean of stay in hospitals is across all age groups and gender. The results of decomposition stratified by age and gender are presented in Table 3 and Table 4 .  In 2000, people were admitted to the hospital for 1.18 days on average. By 2010, the number of Table 2 ). The results of decomposition stratified by age and gender are presented in Table 3 and Table 4 .  In short, the reduction in hospitalized days per person from 2000 to 2010 of 200.6% is contributed to by the decrease of mean duration of stay, and it is offset by -51.1% due to the slight growth in the frequency of public hospital admissions and -49.4% by the difference of hospital admission rates (see Table 2 ). The results of decomposition stratified by age and gender are presented in Table 3 and Table 4 . 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59
