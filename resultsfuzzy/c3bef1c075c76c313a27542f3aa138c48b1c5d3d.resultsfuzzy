A total of 10 595 SARI cases were reported by 11 sentinel hospitals from September 2014 to August 2016. Among all the reported cases, 1229 (11.60%) SARI cases were randomly surveyed, sampled, and tested. Eighty-one HPIV RNA-positive cases were identified in this study, including 10 HPIV-1, 9 HPIV-2, 55 HPIV-3, and 7 HPIV-4 cases, with a yield rate of 0.81%, 0.73%, 4.48%, and 0.57%, respectively. No regional or temporal clustering of HPIV infection was found. Among all 81 HPIV RNA-positive cases, 18 cases were found to be coinfected with other respiratory viruses. Coinfection with HPIV-3 and rhinovirus was the most common pattern (Supporting information 1). All types of HPIVs were detected every year, except for HPIV-2 in September to December 2014. Detailed analysis showed that the yield rate of HPIV varied during the year, from the lowest of 0% in February 2016 to the highest of 21.43% in August 2015. As the most common type of HPIVs, HPIV-3, most of the infection occurred in June to September (66.07%, Figure 1 ). Moreover, age-specific infection was proved. Children under 5 years old showed the highest yield rate of HPIV infection (9.07%), and followed by the patients over 60 years old (6.02%). No significant difference was found between HPIV-positive SARI cases and all SARI cases by gender and hospital stays (P = .728 and P = .774, respectively). However, HPIV-positive SARI cases have a better outcome when compared with other SARI cases (0.24% vs. 4.56% for ICU treatment and 0 vs. 1.55% for death, Table 1 ).
