During 2010, 622 Australian veterinary practices across all States and Territories became registered users of Disease WatchDog (approximately 30% of all registered practices in Australia). Of these clinics 27% (n = 168) of all registrations occurred during February (Fig. S1, Appendix A) . Registrations during the remainder of 2010 ranged from 13 to 72 per month. In addition, 37.8% of all registered clinics were located in NSW, accounting for 37.2% of all registered veterinary practices in this state (n = 632). Overall, registered clinics were located in 481 Australian postal codes (Fig. S2, Appendix A) and distributed throughout most of the populated regions of Australia. Nineteen significant (P < 0.05) space-time disease clusters were identified with a mean radius of 42.3 km (range 0-223 km). Clusters with a radius of 0 km represent clusters of disease reports within a single post code. The median number of cases within these clusters was 7 (range 4-22). Clusters were identified in both rural and urban areas of New South Wales (9), Victoria (3), Queensland (3), South Australia (1), and Western Australia (3; Fig. 2 ). Eleven (58%) clusters occurred between April and July (Fig. 3) . The average cluster lasted for 5.7 days. A complete list of identified clusters is presented in Table 1 .
