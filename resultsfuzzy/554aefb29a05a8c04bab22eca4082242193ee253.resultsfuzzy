Another case was designed to explore the reliability of the prediction based on the time step of 1 h without considering the time delay. The results were then compared with those of the prediction that considered the time delay in the air ducts. The newly designed time delays in the air ducts are listed in Table 3 . The time step of 10 min (600 s) was used for prediction. During the prediction, the time delays for air ducts 2e4, and 6e8 could be considered with respect to the length of the time step (10 min). The concentrations with and without considering the time delay through the air ducts were predicted based on the time step of 10 min, and the results are illustrated in Fig. 14 . The larger discrepancy in the predicted concentrations with and without considering the time delay only occurred in the first hour for the different positions. From the second hour the predicted concentrations with and without considering the time delay were close to each other. From the view point of long-time period prediction, a low effect might be caused by neglecting the time delay in the air ducts. As the predictions with time steps of 10 min and 1 h were almost the same, as illustrated in Fig. 13 , the overall discrepancy in the prediction based on the time step of 1 h without considering the time delay and the prediction based on the time step of 10 min with consideration of the time delay was believed to be small, indicating an acceptable reliability of prediction. Furthermore, the time delay of up to 700 s (11.7 min) was designed for air ducts in the demonstration case; therefore, a certain effect on the prediction was observed if the time delay was neglected. However, for conventional building ventilation systems, the magnitude of the time delay in the air ducts is always tens of seconds or a few minutes, which is much less than the set time in the study Thus, a smaller effect on the prediction is expected to be observed when the time delay in the air ducts is neglected. This alternative method can be used to determine the prediction based on the time step of 1 h when the actual structure of the air ducts is complex, and there is a heavy workload in calculating the time delay in each air duct.
