To analyze the activity of putative Breg cell activity in healthy human newborns, we first examined neonatal B cells within the cord blood mononuclear cell (CBMC) population using a 35-parameter mass cytometric approach (CyTOF). Within the B cell population, unsupervised analysis using the viSNE algorythm that allows dimensionality reduction (Amir et al., 2013) revealed different B cell subsets with different phenotypes that clustered according to their high expression of CD5 or CD10 and that were associated with distinct sets of B cell markers ( Figures 1A, 1B , and S1). Mature naive (MN) CD19 + B cells were phenotypically defined as being CD5 À CD10 À CD1c hi CD21 hi CD45RA hi CD23 lo CD24 int CD38 int IgD hi IgM lo/hi , although there was some heterogeneity for some markers. Immature transitional B cells (IMT, N 2), basically corresponding to CD24 hi CD38 hi B cells, were phenotypically defined as being CD5 lo CD10 + CD1c À CD21 À CD45RA int CD23 -CD24 hi CD38 hi IgD int IgM hi . We also found an additional, previously undescribed population of CD5 hi B cells, phenotypically defined as CD5 hi CD10 À CD1c lo CD21 int CD45RA int CD23 hi CD24 lo CD38 lo IgD lo IgM lo (N 3) ( Figure 1A) . We compared the cytometry profiles for additional CD markers of MN B cells, IMT B cells, and the newly defined CD5 hi population to bulk CD19 + CD20 + B cells and further defined the CD5 hi B cell phenotype as CD43 + CD9 À CD62L À CD40 int DR int CD25 +/À CD27 +/À CD70 À ( Figure 1B) . Adult blood IMT CD24 hi CD38 hi B cells have been shown to produce IL-10 in response to CD40 (Blair et al., 2010) or CpG and/or TLR9 activation (Menon et al., 2016) . Therefore, the abundance of IMT B cells in cord blood suggested that these cells could be a major source of IL-10 in newborns. IMT B cells could be distinguished by CD10 expression with an intermediate cell surface expression of CD5 ( Figure S1A ), which accurately matched the high expression of CD24 and CD38 ( Figure 1B ). To analyze the functions of newborn B cells, the three cord blood B cell populations were sorted by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) based on cell surface CD5 and CD10 expression (Figure S1B) . Among these cord blood-derived cells, CD5 hi B cells, but not IMT and MN B cells, produced IL-10 upon 48 hr of stimulation with A strain of human RSV (HRSV-A) (MOI = 2.5) (Figure 1C) . Based on their IL-10 production, we thus named CD5 hi B cells neonatal Breg (nBreg) cells. nBreg cells were abundant in neonatal blood from preterm and full-term babies and their frequency among total B cells quickly waned with age ( Figure 1D ). To determine whether these cells originated from the mothers of the babies or the babies themselves, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on nBreg cells from male babies. FISH detected X and Y chromosomes in all of the nBreg cells isolated from the cord blood of male babies, indicating that the nBreg cells were derived from the babies rather than the mothers (Figure 1E) . We then sought to determine the stimuli that can lead to IL-10 production from nBreg cells. While nBreg cells made IL-10 in response to HRSV ( Figure 1C ), the nBreg cells failed to produce IL-10 after infection with a large panel of RNA or DNA viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), coronavirus 229E, HIV, HSV-1, HTLV, and MV ( Figure S1C ). To determine whether the induction of the IL-10 response by HRSV was specific to neonatal B cells, we tested the various adult blood B cell subsets and tested their responsiveness to HRSV. We first peformed CyTOF on adult IMT B cells, memory B cells, marginal zone B (MZB) cells, and naive B cells. Adult IMT cells displayed a phenotype similar to newborn IMT cells, whereas MZB cells and memory B cells were phenotypically distinct from nBreg cells ( Figure S2A ). FACS-sorted adult memory B cells, MZB cells, and IMT cells produced IL-10 in response to R848, a TLR7 agonist, but not in response to HRSV (MOI = 2.5) ( Figure S2B ). These data indicate that HRSV-activated nBreg cells may possess unique anti-inflammatory properties. The Th1-Th2 balance is critical at the time of the primary RSV infection, as impaired Th1 cell priming or a Th2 cell immunopathology have been shown to determine the outcome of secondary infection (Culley et al., 2002) . We thus performed an inflammatory T cell suppression assay, which remains the gold standard for assessing Breg cell activity. Coculture of RSV-activated nBreg cells with activated CD4 + Th1 cells inhibited IFN-g and IL-22, but not TNF-a, cytokine production from the CD4 + T cells . Using IAV-activated neonatal plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), we recently showed that type I IFN-dependent neonatal Th1 cell differentiation is induced by the allogeneic immune response (Zhang et al., 2014a) . Similarly, RSV-activated neonatal pDCs induced a predominantly IFN-g Th1 cell response that was associated with a mild IL-4 Th2 cell responses ( Figures  2D-2F ). To investigate whether nBreg cells could regulate Th1 cell response indirectly via pDCs, pDCs were cultured alone or with RSV-activated nBreg cells for 2 days and then these cells were co-cultured with naive T cells for 6 days after. We observed few pDCs infected by RSV when cultured alone or after coculture with nBreg cells ( Figure S3A ). RSV-activated nBreg cells were able to inhibit the ability of pDCs to prime an IFN-g T cell response in an IL-10-dependent manner ( Figures 2D-2F ). This was associated with decreased APC functions of pDCs (HLA-DR and CD80) but not the IFN-a response ( Figure S3B ). Altogether, these data demonstrate that the nBreg cells can be specifically activated by RSV and may control the Th1 cell responses in an IL-10-dependent manner.
