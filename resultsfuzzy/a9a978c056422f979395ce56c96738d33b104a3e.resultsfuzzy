RNase L antiviral activity inhibits DENV and WNV production but not ZIKV production. 126 We have previously shown that ZIKV activation of the OAS/RNase L pathway can be 127 detected by 24hpi (Whelan et al., 2019) . Using host 28S and 18S rRNA degradation as a 128 measurement for RNase L activation, we show that RNase L activation during ZIKV 129 infection is mediated by the OAS3 isoform specifically ( Figure 1A , left panel). By 48hpi, 130 degradation of rRNA was detected in ZIKV-infected OAS1 KO and OAS2 KO cells similar 131 to that of parental WT cells, while KO of OAS3 or RNase L prevented as well as confirmed 132 RNase L-mediated cleavage of rRNA ( Figure 1B) . In contrast to other RNase L-activating 133 viruses, RNase L nuclease activity did not restrict ZIKV production. This was 134 demonstrated by a lack viral titer increase by 48hpi, after multiple rounds of replication, 135 in ZIKV-infected RNase L KO cells compared to in WT cells ( Figure 1C) . Instead, deletion 136 of RNase L reduced ZIKV production. In comparison to ZIKV, we detected weaker 137 activation of RNase L by West Nile virus Kunjin strain (KUNV), although also OAS3-138 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Despite reduced RNase L activation by DENV and KUNV, both viruses were 140 restricted by RNase L activity in WT cells ( Figure 1C) . Therefore, RNase L is not only 141 ineffective in inhibiting ZIKV infection, but also specifically promotes ZIKV production 142 ( Figure 1A, right panel) . 143 144 RNase L improves ZIKV RF function to increase ZIKV RNA and protein expression. 145 Since infectious virus production was enhanced by RNase L expression, we examined 146 whether RNase L was required for optimal ZIKV replication. We used 147 immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) for detection of the replication intermediate dsRNA 148 and the ZIKV NS3 protein as markers for ZIKV RFs, comparing expression levels in WT 149 and RNase L KO cells. At 20hpi, expression of both ZIKV dsRNA and NS3 was increased 150 in WT cells, as measured by mean dsRNA and NS3 intensity at perinuclear ER sites 151 characteristic of flaviviruses ( Figure 2AB&C) . We also observed a change in localization 152 of ZIKV dsRNA and NS3 in RNase L KO cells, both of which were more disseminated 153 around the nucleus and into the cytoplasm. We used circularity and diameter parameters 154 to quantify the spread of viral products throughout the cell at 20hpi, and determined that 155 RNase L deletion decreased circularity and increased diameter of RFs, distinct from the 156 densely concentrated RF phenotype observed in WT cells ( Figure 2AB&C) . We 157 observed this trend of viral RF diffusion in RNase L KO cells as early as 16hpi through 158 30hpi, in two different RNase L KO clones ( Figure S1 ). We performed all future analyses 159 on cells fixed at 20hpi, which provides adequate infected cells for quantification purposes, 160 but is early enough for examination of a uniform stage of the viral replication cycle across 161 All rights reserved.

Additionally, since alterations in ZIKV dsRNA and NS3 were nearly 162 identical, we proceeded to measure effects on RFs using dsRNA expression only. 163 When comparing DENV dsRNA expression and localization in RNase L KO cells 164 to that of WT cells, we found that dsRNA intensity and circularity were decreased while 165 diameter was increased without RNase L, a similar trend but to a lesser degree than with 166 ZIKV ( Figure 2D&F) . Furthermore, this does not result in a defect in virus release as 167 measured by viral titer, but instead virus titer is enhanced by RNase L KO (Figure 1C The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. We also found that by 48hpi OAS3 KO, which suppresses RNase L activation, 201 restored infectious ZIKV production from reduced levels of RNase L KO cells to that 202 observed during WT cell infection ( Figure 3D ). DENV production, which was limited by 203 RNase L in WT cells, was not improved by OAS3 KO, suggesting an OAS3-independent 204 RNase L-mediated inhibition of DENV infection ( Figure 3D ). While KUNV production was 205 also limited by RNase L in WT cells, it improved with OAS3 KO as observed with ZIKV. 206 However, unlike DENV, KUNV activation of RNase L was OAS3-dependent ( Figure 1B) . 207 All rights reserved.

These results from cells lacking OAS3 209 suggest that ZIKV infection may utilize an inactive form of RNase L in a unique manner 210 that results in higher virus production than with RNase L absent. revealed that deletion of RNase L did not alter intensity of genome expression when 230 All rights reserved.

Since genome staining was not circular in shape, we instead used 231 total area to measure increased dissemination of genome throughout the infected cell in RNase L KO cells, but not increased over that in WT cells as was observed for ZIKV 250 ( Figure 4F ). Since KUNV does not activate RNase L until 48hpi by rRNA degradation 251 assay ( Figure 1B ), we had not expected a change in genome intensity between cell lines 252 at 20hpi. Additionally, the area of KUNV genome expression was increased in RNase L 253 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Overall, absence of OAS3-dependent RNase L activity had a 255 greater impact on ZIKV genome localization and expression compared to that of DENV 256 and KUNV, which agrees with its minimal effects on DENV and KUNV RFs and viral titers.

In RNase L KO cells, dsRNA was detectable, validating that absence of 277 dsRNA in WT cells was due to RNase L specifically and not from other antiviral responses 278 induced by pIC ( Figure 5B ). In OAS3 KO cells, pIC transfection before ZIKV infection 279 had no effect on dsRNA expression, further demonstrating that RNase L was not 280 activated in the absence of OAS3 (Figure 5C) . 281 To corroborate these results with a more quantitative method, we also used this Figure 5D ). Finally, these results suggest that inactive RNase L retains 297 ZIKV genome in smaller, more efficient RFs. 298 299 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

This provided an RNase L-308 deficient cell line as a control for this system, in addition to verification that effects in RL 309 R667A-expressing cells were not possibly due to endogenous RNase L WT expression. 310 While RL WT protein expression was lower than that of RL R667A, it was sufficient for 311 RNase L-mediated rRNA degradation, which was only detectable in ZIKV infected +RL 312 WT cells and not VC or +RL R667A cells, despite OAS3 protein expression in all three 313 cell lines (Figure 6A&B) . We evaluated effects of RNase L WT or R667A expression on 314 ZIKV dsRNA expression and localization compared to that of VC cells at 20hpi, using PDI 315 ER staining to denote RF sites. We found that expression of either RL WT or RL R667A 316 increased ZIKV dsRNA intensity at the ER over that in VC cells, however only RL R667A 317 increased circularity of ZIKV RFs in comparison to those of VC cells (Figure 6C&D) . To 318 determine if RNase L effects on ZIKV dsRNA intensity or circularity correlated with 319 elevated infectious ZIKV titers, we measured virus from infected HeLa M cells at 48hpi 320 and detected a significant increase in ZIKV production in RL R667A-expressing cells 321 compared to VC or RL WT-expressing cells (Figure 6E ). In addition, we found that neither 322 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
