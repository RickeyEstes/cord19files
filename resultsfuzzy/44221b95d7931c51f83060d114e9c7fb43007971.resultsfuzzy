The concentrations of cytokines in the supernates of cell 3.1. Differential blood cell count and lymphocyte cultures were determined by means of quantitative en-subpopulations zyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). IFN-a was additionally determined in sera samples of the individual Differential blood cell counts showed no significant patients. ELISA kits for IFN-a (intraassay variance 3.7%, differences between the two patient groups (Table 1 ) and interassay variance 5.3%), IFN-g (intraassay variance were all within normal ranges. With regard to the lympho-5.2%, interassay variance 6.0%), TNF-a (intraassay vari-cyte subpopulations, we found a significantly lower 1 ance 3.5%, interassay variance 4.0%) and IL-2 (intraassay amount of CD8 T-cells in patients with stable disease, variance 3.9%, interassay variance 5.5%) were obtained leading to a significantly higher CD4 / CD8 ratio in this from Bio Source International (Camarillo, CA, USA). The patient group as compared to MS patients undergoing an ELISA kit for detection of sIL-2R (intraassay variance acute exacerbation ( p,0.03). 3.6%, interassay variance 2.0%) was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA) and for IFN-b (intraas-3.2.

The color intensity was measured between patient groups and controls ( Table 2 ).

Individual concentrations could be tion are shown in Fig. 1 . Interestingly, both patient groups determined from a standard curve. Minimal detectable showed a significantly ( p,0.005) decreased IL-2 prodoses were 5 pg / ml (TNF-a, IFN-a, IFN-g, IL-2, sIL-2R) duction in comparison to the control group. and 3 units / ml (IFN-b ) , respectively. In contrast, NDV induced production of IFN-a showed highly significant differences in mean values between the 2.5. Statistics two patient groups. Patients with stable disease (156.6 pg / ml) produced significantly ( p,0.0001) lower amounts Statistical analysis was performed using commercially of IFN-a than controls (924.1 pg / ml) and patients with available software for personal computers (SPSS for disease activity (773.6 pg / ml).

Table 2 Cytokine production in a whole-blood assay in MS patients with acute exacerbation (n510), with stable disease (n511) and controls (n520) (Fig. 3) . Overall, IFN-b was produced in termination of interleukin-2 in the supernates of (PHA)-stimulated cell cultures. The horizontal bars represent mean interleukin-2 levels in each lower amounts than IFN-a. However, the mean value in patient group. patients with stable disease (8.0 U / ml) was also significantly lower than in patients with disease activity (52.6 U / ml) and controls (29.6 U / ml). No cytokines were detectable in the supernates of unstimulated cultures.
