Between Table 1) . The most reported HBoV subtype was HBoV1 (100%; 70/70), followed by HBoV2 (16%; 11/70), HBoV3 (13%; 9/70), and HBoV4 (7%; 5/70) (Table 1) . A total of 54% (36/67) studies were done on samples collected from nasal swabs, 7% (5/67) were done on samples collected from throat swabs, 22% (15/67) were done on stool samples, 4% (3/67) were combined nasal/throat samples, 3% (2/67) were combined stool/nasal samples, 6% (4/67) were combination of nasal/ stool/serum samples, and 3% (3/67) were a combination of nasal/serum samples. Meta-analysis was done to provide transparent, objective, and replicable summaries of the study findings. From all the 70 studies, 66 had sufficient information to enable statistical analysis. As shown in Figure 2 with the dispersion in study prevalence, there was a low heterogeneity among the studies (Cochran Q = 12.2800 [df = 65] P-Val = 1). Apart from the observed increase in the prevalence of HBoV, none of the other drivers (including age, setting, symptoms, method of detection, and hospitalization) achieved statistical significance. The test for overall effect was Z = 13.29 (P<0.0001) which was highly significant in the findings. Ten studies were from other developing countries of which eight studies (80%) reported on patients suffering from respiratory tract infection and two studies (20%) reported on patients suffering from diarrheal disease. All ten of the studies focused only on children (100%; 10/10) ( Table 2 ). All studies in other developing countries worked on hospitalized patients ( Table 2) . A total of 70% (7/10) of the studies collected nasal swabs, 20% collected throat swabs, and 20% of the studies collected stool samples. The most sampled population was children â‰¤ 6 years of age (Table 2) . Majority 60% (6/10) were done in urban setting in other developing countries while 40% (4/10) were done in rural settings. Eight (80%) of the studies reported on patients suffering from respiratory tract infections (Table 2 ). In other developing countries, HBoV was reported in Argentina 10% (1/10), Cambodia 10% (1/10), China 40% (4/10), India 10% (1/10), Jordan 10%(1/10), and the Philippines 10%(1/10). In Africa, the majority of studies (82%; 9/11) were done in urban settings while 18% (2/11) were done in rural settings. Ten (91%) of the studies reported on patients suffering from respiratory tract infections and one study (9%) reported on patients suffering from gastroenteritis. In these studies, a total of 383 (10.4%) samples tested positive for HBoV (Table 3) . More studies reported HBoV in children less than five years of age (54%; 6/11) compared to children above the age of 5 and adults 45% (5/11) ( Table 3 ). Countries that reported on HBoV in Africa included Kenya 18% (2/11), South Africa 36% (4/11), Egypt 18% (2/11), Cameroon 9% (1/11), and Senegal 18% (2/11). Five of the 11 studies in Africa focused on hospitalized patients and 36% (4/11) studies focused on outpatients, while 18% (2/11) studies focused on both hospitalized and outpatients. Eight (73%; 8/11) of the studies in Africa collected nasal swabs, two studies 18% (2/11) collected throat swabs, and one (9%; 1/11) study collected stool samples. The prevalence of HBoV in Africa was 13% in individuals suffering from gastroenteritis with and without respiratory tract symptoms. The high detection rate of HBoV in Africa was consistent with the global increase of HBoV in children less than 5 years of age [4, 59] . Children of all age group are most likely to experience HBoV infection as a result of poor sanitation and hygiene practices [59] . The most predominant HBoV subtype identified in Africa was HBoV1, which was detected in all the studies. Only one study (9%), from Kenya detected all subtypes (HBoV1-4) from children of all age group (Table 3) . Not all the studies tested for all HBoV subtypes; this may be due to the fact that other HBoV subtypes have just been recently discovered compared to HBoV1 [37] . The most predominant HBoV subtype identified in other developing countries was HBoV1, which was isolated in all the studies. Only 10% (1/10) of the studies from china detected HBoV2 in the study population ( Table 2) . The results in Africa indicated that HBoV in children less than five years of age was high, 54% (6/11) compared to children above 5 years of age and adults 45% (5/11) ( Table 3 ). Schildgen and colleagues [60] showed that all age groups can be affected by HBoV, although severe infections requiring hospitalization occur primarily in patients with an underlying disease and children under 5 years of age [61] [62] [63] [64] . Journal of Tropical Medicine 7 Journal of Tropical Medicine 9 Severe clinical cases (such as destruction of the epithelium of the respiratory system) have been described in children [61, [64] [65] [66] and adults with immunodeficiency [64] and other risk groups [67] . Studies in Africa (13%; 9/70) were mostly done in urban setting compared to other developing countries/worldwide (87%; 61/70) (Tables 1, 2, and 3 ). This could be due to the lack of laboratory resource capacity and technology for the detection of HBoV in rural settings. The methods used for detecting HBoV have been conventional PCR [17, 28, 40, 41, 45, 53, 64] and real-time PCR [42-45, 54, 68] , due to the limited success of serological and viral culture techniques. Real-time PCR is more sensitive and offers greater sensitivity, increased specificity with the addition of oligoprobes, and the added benefit of a closed detection system, reducing the likelihood of false positive results due to contamination with amplicon [33] . In Africa, 63% (7/11) of studies used conventional PCR for detection, 27% (3/11) used real-time PCR, and 9% (1/11) used Multiplex PCR which is also conventional PCR (Table 3 ). In all eleven African studies, HBoV1 was detected (Table 3) , similarly in other developing countries HBoV1 was detected in all the studies. HBoV Subtype 1 is mainly associated with respiratory diseases but can also be found in stool samples from patients suffering from diarrhea. Previous studies have reported prevalence of HBoV in symptomatic patients 1.5-16% worldwide [69, 70] . Several studies have isolated HBoV from children with respiratory tract infection worldwide, and the prevalence of HBoV in these children was 1.5%-19% [32, 33, 35] . The reports on HBoV in Africa, other developing countries, and worldwide in individuals suffering from respiratory tract infection 78% (55/70) were higher compared to those suffering from gastroenteritis 21% (15/70) (Tables 1, 2, and  3 ). This could be due to the fact that most studies focused on HBoV in respiratory tract infection since its discovery in 2005 [28, 33, 36, 71] . However recent studies are increasingly detecting HBoV in individuals suffering from diarrheal diseases due to the presence of the virus in stool samples of individuals suffering from gastroenteritis [37, [72] [73] [74] . Although the number of studies in Africa is limited, the HBoV prevalence rate of 13% indicates that this virus is one of the emerging viral agents in those suffering from diarrhea with and without respiratory tract infections. Currently there is no available reporting system for HBoV infection in the primary healthcare systems in Africa, suggesting that diarrheal cases with and without respiratory tract infection are likely to be underreported [47] . The high frequency of HBoV in children raises a potential health risk as these children may act as reservoir for other emerging epidemic HBoV strains [27, 37, 75 ].
