Relative to other flaviviruses, YFV is characterized by highly disordered C and M proteins. Two modes of action are at work here. A highly disordered YFV has an overwhelmingly high PID in its C protein (~75%). Interestingly, the mean PID of its M protein (~35%) was also far higher than the corresponding values for all other flavivirus species found in our sample. It is likely that the highly disordered C protein allows for more rapid replication via its promiscuity in protein binding. As a result of the rapid replication, greater viral loads are more attainable, leading to greater virulence. A higher disorder in the M protein, however, allows the virus to more easily penetrate different organs, including vital organs such as the liver [2, 15] . Apparently, YFV's extremely high pathogenicity, which reaches above a 50% CFR, arises from its unique ability to utilize disorder from both its M and C proteins to maintain a viral load as a means of evading the immune system.
