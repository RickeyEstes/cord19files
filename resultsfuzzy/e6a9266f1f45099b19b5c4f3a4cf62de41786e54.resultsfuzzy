Hamsters were divided into 3 groups of 40 hamsters. The first group was inoculated intratracheally with 10 3 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV isolate HCoV-EMC/2012; the second group was inoculated intratracheally with 10 6 TCID 50 of HCoV-EMC/2012 and the third group was inoculated with 4x10 2 TCID 50 HCoV-EMC/2012 via aerosolization. Hamsters were observed for clinical signs of disease daily for 21 dpi and body weight and body temperature were measured. None of the hamsters in the three inoculated groups showed signs of disease, weight loss or increased body temperature (Figure 1) . Nasal, oropharyngeal, urogenital and rectal swabs were obtained daily between 1 and 11 dpi and were all negative by qRT-PCR. Upon necropsy on 2, 4, 8, 14 and 21 dpi, no gross lesions were observed. Lungs, spleen and mandibular lymph nodes collected on 2, 4 and 8 dpi were analyzed for the presence of HCoV-EMC/2012 vRNA by qRT-PCR and found to be negative. Trachea, heart, lung, spleen, liver, kidney, ileum, colon, urinary bladder, nasal turbinates and brain collected on 2, 4, 8, 14 and 21 dpi were used for histopathological analysis; no lesions were observed that could be attributed to the virus in any of the tissues examined ( Figure 2 Lungs, spleen and lymph nodes collected from the hamsters intratracheally inoculated with 10 6 TCID 50 and inoculated via aerosols on 2, 4 and 8 dpi were also analyzed for upregulation of the transcription of the Mx2 gene. Mx2 gene expression was analyzed as an indicator of an innate immune response to virus infection, since Mx2 is downstream of STAT1 and as such is an indicator of a type I or type III IFN response (reviewed in 15. A statistically significant upregulation of Mx2 gene expression could not be detected in any of the hamsters, independent of the inoculation route, inoculation dose or tissue analyzed ( Figure 3 ). Taken together these data indicate that the hamsters were either not infected at all or the infection occurred below the limit of detection of our assays. To determine whether the animals were infected at all, we developed an ELISA assay to detect antibodies against MERS-CoV. Hamster sera collected on 21 dpi were analyzed for the presence of antibodies; there was no evidence for seroconversion in any of the inoculated animals, regardless of inoculation route or dose. Thus, the MERS-CoV does not replicate in Syrian hamsters and they are an unsuitable model for studies into pathogenesis or potential prophylactic or therapeutic intervention strategies. To determine whether the recently described receptor for MERS-CoV, DPP4 [16] , is expressed in the Syrian hamster, we performed immunohistochemistry on lung, kidney, small intestine, urinary bladder and colon of normal hamsters using an α-DPP4 antibody. DPP4 could be detected in all tested hamster tissues ( Table 1) and was abundantly present in the lungs and kidneys of Syrian hamsters (Figure 4) . The abundant expression of DPP4 on bronchiolar epithelium and the occasional presence on type I pneumocytes indicates that the absence of replication in the Syrian hamster is not due to a lack of the receptor, but rather to the fact that the epitope that MERS-CoV binds to is not conserved in Syrian hamster DPP4 or that other restrictions exist on the cellular level that prevent virus replication. HCoV-EMC/2012. A qRT-PCR assay to detect Mx2 was performed on RNA isolated from lungs, spleen and mandibular lymph nodes collected on 2, 4 and 8 days post inoculation (dpi) of Syrian hamsters with 10 6 TCID 50 of HCoV-EMC/2012 (green bars) via the intratracheal route (left panels) or 4x10 2 TCID 50 of HCoV-EMC/2012 via aerosol (right panels, green bars) and compared to mock inoculated animals (blue bars). Data are shown as the fold change of Mx2 over uninfected controls and normalized to an internal reference gene (RPL18). Means were calculated from 4 mock animals and 4 (2 dpi) or 8 (4 and 8 dpi) inoculated animals. Error bars represent standard deviation. Immunohistochemistry was performed on Syrian hamster lung and kidney tissues using an α-DPP4 antibody. In the lung (A and B), DPP4 was abundantly present on bronchiolar epithelium (blue arrow) and smooth muscle cells (black arrows) and was occasionally present on type I pneumocytes (black arrowhead and inset in panel B). In the kidney, DPP4 was present on glomerular parietal epithelium (white arrowhead) and in nerve tissue (purple arrow). Although these experiments did not result in a small animal model for MERS-CoV, they do provide insight into the potential host range of this virus. Given the continuing circulation of the MERS-CoV virus and the associated high case fatality rate, the search for an animal infection/disease model is of utmost importance for our understanding of the pathogenesis of this virus and for the development of effective countermeasures.
