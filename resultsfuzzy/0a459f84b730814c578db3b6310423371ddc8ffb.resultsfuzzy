3.1. TK9 adopts a change in secondary structure in the presence of micelles TK9 adopted a random coil conformation in aqueous solution, as seen from the characteristic single negative minima at 195 nm in the CD spectra (Fig. 1A) . Interestingly, in the presence of micelle, the CD spectra exhibited two negative minima at 208 and 222 nm, indicative of a structural transition from the random coil to an alpha-helical conformation in the micellar environment. In-depth solution state NMR experiments in both micellar systems helped to gain further atomistic resolution understanding of the conformational alternation of TK9 in either case. It is already well established that micelles like DPC or SDS are useful for NMR-derived structural elucidation of peptides in solution due to the quick tumbling motion of the peptide-micelle complex in solution [31, 32] . Hence, change in the peptide's conformation in presence of the micelles was further studied using the solution state NMR spectroscopy. Fig. 1B to D shows the amide and aromatic proton region of the onedimensional 1 H NMR spectra of TK9 in aqueous solution, in the presence of DPC and SDS micelle, respectively. TK9 in aqueous solution was less dispersed and showed sharp signals in the amide proton region (Fig. 1B) , whereas, in presence of micelles, the spectra were more scattered and, broadened, owing to the well-defined conformational change induced by the micellar environment ( Fig. 1C and D) . Furthermore, a greater degree of dispersion in the 1D amide proton region in case of DPC micelles when compared to SDS might suggest at the subtle conformational difference among the two micellar environments. Thus to gain atomic resolution understanding of the peptide's conformation, 2D 1 H-1 H NOESY spectra were acquired in the presence of DPC and SDS micellar environments, which were further assigned and used for the structural elucidation of TK9 in each case as detailed below. The lack of medium to long range NOEs of TK9 in aqueous solution signifies that the structure is mostly flexible and does not adopt any particular well-defined conformation in aqueous solution ( Fig. 2A) . On the other hand, the NOESY spectra in DPC (Fig. 2B) and SDS (Fig. 2C ) micelle contained a sufficient number of sequential and medium-range NOE cross peaks indicating the existence of a distinct structural fold. The fingerprint region in both micellar environments contained several characteristic, sequential and medium-range C α H/NH NOE contacts as illustrated in Figs. 2D-E, 3 . In addition to the intense sequential C α H/ NH (i to i + 1) NOEs, medium range C α H/NH (i to i + 2) NOEs were observed throughout the sequence of TK9 namely between V2/V4, Y3/ Y5, V4/S6, S6/V8, R7/K9 in DPC, while in SDS only two C α H/NH (i, i + 2) NOEs such as V2/V4 and S6/V8 were observed (Figs. 2D-E and 3 ). More specifically, the pattern of C α H/NH (i to i + 3) medium range NOEs were different for the two micelles, e.g., V2/Y5, Y3/S6, V4/R7, and Y5/V8 were observed in DPC micelle, while V2/Y5, Y3/S6, and V4/R7 were predominant in SDS micelle. Also, V2/S6 and Y5/K9 showed C α H/NH (i to i + 4) in DPC micelle and no such NOEs were observed in SDS micelle. Furthermore, a number of medium range NH/ NH (i to i + 2) NOE connectivity were found throughout the sequence such as T1/Y3, Y3/Y5, Y5/R7 in DPC while none had been seen in SDS apart from the usual characteristics NH/NH sequential (i to i + 1) NOEs. Therefore, it is evident that the number of medium range NOE connectivities were much higher in DPC micelle in comparison to SDS micelles. These data suggest that there is a structural difference of TK9 in the two different membrane environments. This observation was also well supported by the difference in the aromatic proton region in the NOESY spectra for these two micelles (Fig. S1 ). In DPC micelle, several aromatic/aliphatic NOE connectivities were observed for TK9, e.g., tyrosine phenyl ring protons (Y3 and Y5) are in close proximity to methylene and methyl protons of neighboring aliphatic residues. In contrast, such NOE contacts were absent in SDS micelle, suggesting the relative orientation of Tyr residues in DPC micelles is much well-ordered and packed within the hydrophobic pockets provided by the side chains of neighboring Val residue in comparison to SDS micelles. The chemical shift deviation of the 13 C α and H α resonances from the standard random coil value also provides the signature of the secondary structure of the peptide [33, 34] . A helical segment is characterized by negative chemical shift deviation of H α and positive chemical shift deviation of 13 C α for four consecutive residues while the reverse trend is a signature of the beta sheet structure. In our systems, all the H α resonances throughout the sequence of the TK9 demonstrate a downfield trend in H α chemical shift deviation in both the DPC and SDS micelles ( Fig. 4A and B) . It is also worthy to mention that, the corresponding 13 C α chemical shift deviations for TK9 were all positive in both micelles ( Fig. 4C and D) . This pattern of chemical shift deviation serves as a signature of the predominance of alpha helical conformation in DPC and SDS micelle. The standard chemical shift values used herein for simplicity were for the aqueous solution. However, a similar trend was obtained for the chemical shift deviations for H α and 13 C α in case of DMSO and a tri-solvent solution including chloroform, methanol, and water (4:4:1 by v/v). While DMSO best mimics the water-bilayer interface, the latter serves to represent the membrane environment [35] . In either case, a general negative deviation for Hα and a positive deflection was obtained for 13 C α over four consecutive residues (Fig. S2) . The average chemical shift deviation for both 13 C α and H α is slightly larger in case of DPC micelles when compared to SDS. This might give a qualitative indication of a greater helical propensity of TK9 in DPC micellar environment.
