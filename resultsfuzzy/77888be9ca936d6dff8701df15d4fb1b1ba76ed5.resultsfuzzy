Although the ARDL is applicable irrespective of whether the variables are I(0) or I(1), the computed F-statistics are not valid in the presence of I(2)variables. To ensure that none of the selected variables is I(2) or beyond, we conduct unit root tests using the Dickey-Fuller generalized least squares (DF-GLS) test (Elliot et al., 1996) . The results show that the null hypothesis for the level of ln AP t can be rejected at the 5% level, suggesting that ln AP t is a stationary I(0) process (Table 1) . On the other hand, the null hypothesis for the levels of ln AF t and ln Y t cannot be rejected at the 5% level, while the null hypothesis for the first differences can be rejected at the 5% level, indicating that ln AF t and ln Y t are nonstationary I(1) processes. Hence, we conclude that none of the variables is I(2) and the ARDL modeling can be pursued in Eqs. (1) and (2). 3 The ARDL modeling begins with determination of the lag structure (p) in Eqs. (1) and (2). 4 For this, we use the Schwarz Information Criterion (SBC) and Lagrange multiplier (LM) statistics for testing the null hypothesis of no serial correlation against lag length 1. The results indicate that p ¼7 and p ¼10 are the optimal lag lengths for US air-passenger and air-freight services, respectively (Table 2) . With the selected lag lengths, we then test the existence of long-run relationship (cointegration) among the variables in each model. As mentioned earlier, this amounts to conduct the F-test to determine the joint significance of laggedlevel variables in Eqs. (1) and (2); for this, the null hypothesis of non-existence of the long-run relationship is equivalent to a 1 ¼a 2 ¼0 in Eq. (1) and b 1 ¼ b 2 ¼0 in Eq. (2). It is important to note that, since the results of the F-test is quite sensitive to changes in the lag structure imposed on first differenced variables, we also use a negative and significant error-correction term (ec t−1 ) as another criterion to determine the existence of the long-run 2 According to the literature (e.g., Liew and Liew, 1979; Phu, 1991) , it seems more appropriate to include disposable income, instead of gross domestic product (GDP), in the demand for air service. This is because demand for air service is derived from traveler's budget for air transport, which is mainly determined by personal disposable income. In fact, we also use GDP as an alternative to disposable income to estimate Eqs. (1) and (2) and find that the estimated coefficients are consistently insignificant. In contrast, our models that use disposable income show that the estimated coefficient is highly significant (Tables 3 and 4) . Hence, disposable income should be more relevant in explaining air service demand. 3 The DF-GLS test statistics are estimated from a model that includes a constant and a trend variable. The MAIC criterion is used to determine lag lengths for the unit root tests. 4 It is worth mentioning that, since the specifications in Eqs. (1) and (2) are based on the assumption that the error terms are serially uncorrelated, it is crucial to balance between selecting a lag length (p) sufficiently large to mitigate the residual serial correlation problems and one sufficiently small to avoid being overparameterized, particularly in view of the limited time-series data available (Pesaran et al., 2001 , p. 308). relationship among the variables. The results of the F-test show that the calculated F-statistic for air-passenger demand lies above the upper critical value of 6.31 at the 10% level, while the test statistics for air-freight demand is found to fall below the lower level of 5.47 (Table 2 ). The coefficients of the error-correction terms in both models, however, are found to be negative and statistically significant at the 5% level (Table 2) . We thus decided to proceed with assessing the short-and long-run coefficient estimates for the both models for which there seems to exist evidence of a cointegrating relationship. The results of the long-run models show that the coefficient of the US real income is statistically significant at the 5% level in all two cases (Table 3 ). More specifically, the domestic real income has a positive long-run relationship with both the air-passenger and air-freight services, indicating that US demand for air transport services tends to increase with economic growth. This finding further suggests that air-passenger and air-freight services can be treated as normal goods and services-an increase in income leads to an increase in air transport demand and vice versa. Notice that the air-freight service seems to be more responsive to income changes than air-passenger service in the long-run. Additionally, the dummy variable for the 9/11 terrorist attacks is found be significantly negative, indicating that the 9/11 terrorist attacks have depressed air-passenger service by approximately 17%. This finding substantiates the results of Ito and Lee (2005) and Blunk et al. (2006) . For example, Ito and Lee (2005) find that the 9/11 terrorist attacks lead to an initial demand shock by over 30% and an ongoing downward shift in the airline demand by 7.4%. However, this finding contrasts with Lai and Lu (2005) in that the 9/11 terrorist attacks only have short-run impacts on US air traffic. The dummy for the SARS epidemic is also found to have a negative effect on US air-passenger demand (−6%). For the airfreight service, on the other hand, all the dummies are not statistically significant even at the 10% level, implying that the market shocks have little impact on US air-freight markets. The error-correction model (ECM) is estimated by the ARDL approach to capture the short-run dynamics among the selected variables (Table 4 ). The results show that the US real income is statistically significant at the 5% level and has a positive relationship with US air-passenger demand. This indicates that, as shown in the long-run analysis, air-passenger demand tends to increase with income in the short-run and thus can be treated as normal services. Additionally, the 9/11 terrorist attacks are found to significantly depress US air-passenger service (−14%) in the short-run, whereas the other market shocks are found to have little impact. For the air-freight service, the real income is found to be statistically insignificant even at the 10% level, indicating that the real income is not an important determinant of the air-freight service in the short-run. One possible explanation for this finding is that the capacity of current air cargo infrastructure and service is limited and shippers may not quickly increase air freight volumes as economy grows. Another possible explanation is that the commodities shipped by air have high values and are very timesensitive, which may limit shippers' choice of alternative transportation modes and reduce a substitution effect of air freight service when economy is in recession. In addition, as seen in the long-run analysis, all the market shocks are found to have little effect on US air-freight volume in the short-run. Finally, in order to ensure that estimated coefficients are stable over time, we apply the cumulative sum (CUSUM) and cumulative sum of squares (CUSUMSQ) tests to the residuals of errorcorrection models in Eqs. (1) and (2) (Figs. 1 and 2) . The result show that, with Cases І and II, the estimated coefficients are generally stable over the sample period; hence, the ARDL models presented above are well defined and provide sound findings.
