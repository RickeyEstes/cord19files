P3N-PIPO is expressed at very low levels in TuMV-infected plants To investigate the potyvirus frameshifting mechanism, we used a GFP-expressing infectious clone of TuMV (TuMV-GFP; Fig 1) . To enable efficient detection of both P3 and P3N-PIPO with the same antibody, we inserted a sequence encoding the V5 epitope to tag both the P3 and P3N-PIPO proteins near to their N-termini (Fig 1) . The V5 tag was stably maintained within the virus genome for at least four passages. Using a V5 antibody, it was possible to detect both P3 and P3N-PIPO in protein extracts from upper leaves of plants following inoculation of lower leaves with TuMV-GFP via agroinfiltration (Fig 2) Genetic analysis indicates that À1 ribosomal frameshifting is not the primary expression mechanism for P3N-PIPO in TuMV A highly conserved GAA_AAA_A sequence at the 5 0 end of the pipo ORF was proposed previously to be the site of frameshifting [4] ( Fig 1) . In TuMV, the motif is preceded by a "G", to form a G_GAA_AAA_A sequence that might be compatible with À1 PRF to access the pipo ORF ( Fig 3A) . On the other hand, conservation of the final "A" would not be relevant for À1 tandem slippage PRF but would be relevant for transcriptional slippage. To further elucidate the frameshifting mechanism, several mutants were constructed ( Fig 3A) . Mutants M1 and M2 carry mutations 5 0 -adjacent to the GAA_AAA_A sequence that are expected to inhibit possible À1 PRF by preventing P-site codon:anticodon re-pairing following a À1 shift. Mutant P has mutations at the 3 0 end of the GAA_AAA_A sequence that are expected to inhibit possible transcriptional slippage by reducing the length of the homopolymeric run of "A"s. Mutant FSko has mutations in the middle of the GAA_AAA_A sequence that should inhibit frameshifting by either mechanism. All the mutations listed above were introduced into the TuMV-GFP cDNA with V5-tagged P3 (denoted WT) and do not change the P3 amino acid sequence. Nicotiana benthamiana plants were biolistically inoculated with WT and mutant virus clones and virus infection monitored using GFP fluorescence ( Fig 3B) . As P3N-PIPO is required for virus movement, changes in its expression would be expected to manifest in an absence of movement or altered movement dynamics. In plants infected with WT virus, systemic infection was detected by 7 d.p.i. with GFP fluorescence detected in small clusters in the upper leaves. By 9 d.p.i., GFP fluorescence was seen over the entire leaf area of the upper leaves. Both mutants in which possible À1 PRF was inhibited, M1 and M2, behaved similarly to WT virus. In both cases, GFP fluorescence was detectable by 7 d.p.i. and reached maximum area by 9 d.p.i. In contrast, no GFP signal was detected in plants inoculated with mutant P, in which possible transcriptional slippage was inhibited, or mutant FSko, in which any type of frameshifting should be inhibited. The plants were monitored until 28 d.p.i. without any qualitative change being observable. Over two series of experiments, with 12 and 6 plants per construct, the percentages of systemic infection were as follows: WT, 75-100%; M1, 83-100%; M2, 83-100%; P, 0%; and FSko, 0%. Upper leaves of inoculated plants were also analysed for systemic infection using Western analysis and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) ( Fig 3C) . Coat protein (CP), P3 and P3N-PIPO were detected in plants inoculated with WT and mutants M1 and M2, but, as expected based on the previous results, these proteins were absent from plants inoculated with mutants P and FSko. Using RT-PCR, viral RNA was detected in plants inoculated with WT and mutants M1 and M2, but not in plants inoculated with mutants P and FSko. The cDNA fragments obtained from plants inoculated with M1 and M2 were sequenced, and no reversions were detected at the mutated sites. Virus movement was monitored in inoculated leaves by confocal microscopy (Fig 3D) . For WT virus, GFP fluorescence became easily detectable from 4 to 5 d.p.i. in clusters of cells, indicating virus cellto-cell movement. Cell clusters typically reached approximately maximum size and signal intensity by day 6. Similar cell-to-cell movement was seen with mutants M1 and M2. In contrast, with To ensure that the movement-deficient phenotype of P and FSko was not simply an artefact of defective virus replication (with GFP fluorescence observed in single cells resulting from translation of RNA transcribed directly from the plasmid), these mutants were tested for their ability to replicate within cells. Mutants were introduced into plants by agroinfiltration (Fig 4) . A replication-deficient TuMV-GFP clone, ΔGDD, lacking the catalytic GDD site of the viral polymerase, was constructed and used as a control. Using strandspecific RT-PCR, the positive-strand viral RNA (derived from T-DNA transcription and/or viral replication) was, as expected, detected with all constructs: ΔGDD, WT, P and FSko. However, when strand-specific RT-PCR was used to detect the negative-strand viral RNA, which can only be produced by the viral polymerase during viral replication, cDNA fragments were detected only for WT, P and FSko, indicating that mutants P and FSko are replication competent. Viral protein accumulation was also analysed. P3 and CP were detected by Western analysis in total protein extracts from patches infiltrated with ΔGDD, WT, P and FSko. Comparison of protein levels indicated that mutants P and FSko do not accumulate as efficiently as WT virus, though this might be an artefact of the assay as WT virus would reach more cells whereas the movementdeficient mutants would only replicate and accumulate in transformed cells. As expected, much lower levels of P3 and CP were detected in patches infiltrated with the ΔGDD mutant, consistent with transcription and translation of the T-DNA encoded sequence, without viral replication. In summary, the mutants unable to move from cell to cell (P and FSko) are still able to replicate and accumulate, supporting the proposition that the movementcompromised phenotype results from the absence or insufficient expression of P3N-PIPO. High-throughput sequencing reveals transcriptional slippage at the GA 6 site To further test whether transcriptional slippage might explain P3N-PIPO production, we performed high-throughput sequencing of the slip site region in the context of virus infection. RNA was extracted from systemically infected leaves (total RNA), as well as from virions and polysomes. Primers designed to anneal just upstream or downstream of the GA 6 sequence were used to reverse transcribe and amplify a region surrounding the GA 6 site, and the resulting cDNAs were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (Fig 5, Appendix Table S1 ). Around 1.9-2.1% of reads obtained from total RNA purified from WT TuMV systemically infected leaves contained a single "A" insertion within the GA 6 sequence (GA 6 changed to GA 7 ), thus allowing expression of P3N-PIPO at a level of~2%, consistent with Western blots of V5-tagged virus (Fig 2) . A single "A" insertion was the most abundant insertion/deletion event detected. Similar results were obtained with TuMV mutants M1 and M2, with 2.3-1.8% of reads containing a single "A" insertion. Polysomal and virion RNA (both purified from WT TuMV systemically infected leaves) were also tested. For polysomal RNA, a single "A" insertion was seen in 2.9% of reads, while, for virion-derived RNA, a single "A" insertion was seen in 2.1-2.5% of reads. Due to the movement-deficient phenotype of mutants P and FSko, RNA from agroinfiltrated patches was used to test for slippage, with insertions detected in ≤0.01% of reads. No insertions were observed when using plasmid DNA as template for library preparation, although deletions occurred at a low level (0.02-0.03%). Thus, insertions were not introduced during amplification, library preparation or sequencing. To test whether transcriptional slippage was specific to the viral polymerase, we also tested RNAs transcribed by host cell RNA polymerase. Samples from leaf patches agroinfiltrated with the ΔGDD TuMV mutant were analysed using the same primers as above. In these samples, TuMV RNA is transcribed by N. benthamiana RNA polymerase II from T-DNA, although it is conceivable that some transcripts produced in infiltrated A. tumefaciens cells may also be present. Prior to reverse transcription, samples were excessively treated with DNase and complete elimination of contaminating DNA verified by PCR. Insertion of a single "A" at the GA 6 site occurred at a level of 0.05-0.07% in these samples-around 33-fold lower than was seen with WT TuMV. Two host genes containing GA 6 G sequences (similar to TuMV) were also tested: ubiquitinconjugating enzyme E2 (Ubi E2) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5B (eIF5B). For eIF5B, two distinct GA 6 sites were tested. In two of the three cases, insertion of an additional "A" at the GA 6 site occurred at a level of 0.05-0.07% (around 33-fold below WT TuMV), while the third site was more slip-prone, with "A" insertions occurring at a level of 0.20-0.25% (around 9-fold below WT TuMV). In addition to testing specificity of higher levels of slippage to the viral polymerase, these experiments also put upper bounds on slippage introduced during reverse transcription. In contrast, the TuMV WT deletion rate (0.13-0.15%) was similar to that of the DGDD control (0.12-0.14%), indicating that pipo-site deletions are not specific to the viral polymerase. To test whether insertions were specific to the pipo slip site, total RNA from systemically infected leaves and virion-derived RNA were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (ENA databank accession PRJEB9490). Similar to before, single-nucleotide insertions at the GA 6 sequence were observed at a level of 1.9 and 2.1% for total and virion RNA, respectively. Elsewhere in the TuMV genome, an average insertion rate of 0.001% per nucleotide was seen with both samples and no other insertion "hotspots" were detected of similar magnitude to the pipo slip site (Appendix Fig S1) . While investigating translational frameshifting as a potential P3N-PIPO expression mechanism, we had previously performed in vitro translations of reporter constructs containing the pipo slip site and flanking sequences. We observed expression of both alternative frames with access to the pipo reading frame occurring at a level of 1.5-2.1% for WT sequence (Appendix Fig S2) . In view of the above results, we decided to test whether slippage in the in vitro system might also be occurring at the level of transcription. We subjected cDNAs derived from T7-transcribed transcripts to highthroughput sequencing and found that 2.8% of transcripts had an "A" insertion in the GA 6 sequence, while 0.5% of transcripts had deletions at the same site (Appendix Table S1 ). Thus, the in vitro frameshift products may be presumed to result from slippage by the T7 polymerase. The M1 and M2 mutations had little effect on expression of the frameshift products in vitro while the P mutation inhibited their production. To confirm that transcriptional slippage was not specific to TuMV, we analysed RNA from plants infected with two other potyviruses, Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV; aug_GAA_ AAA_Auc slip site) and Bean common mosaic necrosis virus (BCMNV; ucg_GAA_AAA_Auu slip site). In these species, insertion of a single "A" at the GA 6 sequence occurred at a level of 1.3% and 0.8%, respectively, and in both an elevated level of deletions was observed in comparison with the TuMV samples. We also analysed Plum pox virus data available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Short Read Archive (SRA) database Libraries were prepared and subjected to high-throughput sequencing in order to detect low-frequency insertion/deletion events. All samples apart from Ubi E2, eIF5B-1, eIF5B-2, BCMV and BCMNV correspond to TuMV. RNA was purified from upper leaves of systemically infected plants for samples TuMV WT, TuMV M1, TuMV M2, BCMV and BCMNV. Polysomes and virions were also purified from upper leaves of TuMV-infected plants. RNA from agroinfiltrated tissue was used for the TuMV P, FSko and ΔGDD mutants. Additionally, T7 in vitro transcribed RNA (T7 transc.) and plasmid DNA (DNA) were analysed. Three GA 6 sequences in host genes-Ubi E2, eIF5B-1 and eIF5B-2-were also analysed. For each sample, frequencies of transcripts with an "A" insertion at the GA 6 sequence are shown in blue; frequencies of transcripts with two or more inserted "A" nucleotides are shown in orange; and frequencies of transcripts with one or more "A" nucleotides deleted are in yellow. (accession numbers ERX013141 and ERX013142; 12 libraries). The mean frequency of an "A" insertion at the GA 6 site was 0.8%, with frequencies for individual samples ranging from 0.3 to 1.0% (Appendix Fig S3) . Similarly, a low level (1-2%) of frameshift mutations at position 2,891 (which corresponds to the GA 6 site) has been reported for Zucchini yellow mosaic virus [20] . Together, these results indicate that around 0.8-2% of viral transcripts produced by the potyvirus polymerase allow expression of P3N-PIPO as a consequence of an "A" insertion at the GA 6 site. Although previous mass spectrometric analysis of cDNAs derived from RNA from TuMV-infected plants failed to detect transcripts with insertions or deletions [4] , this analysis may not have been sensitive enough to identify the low level of slippage observed. While we cannot rule out À1 PRF occurring at some level in TuMV or other potyvirid species, our data suggest that transcriptional slippage alone can account for P3N-PIPO expression. An earlier hypothesis that potyviruses might use a novel +2 PRF mechanism, involving re-pairing of the P-and A-site tRNAs from GAA and AAA to A_AA and A_AN, respectively [10] , now seems unnecessary and unlikely.
