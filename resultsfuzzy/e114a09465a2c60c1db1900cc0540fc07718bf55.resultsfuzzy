The envelope (Env) protein of many retroviruses, including ALV, determines the capacity of the virus to produce cytopathic effect (CPE) (Dorner and Coffin, 1986; Riedel et al., 1988; Siliciano, 1996) . This suggests that the envelope protein which functions in cell attachment and fusion-mediated entry, may directly contribute to cell killing. Clues about mechanisms by which the ALV Env protein contributes to cell death were obtained following identification of the cellular receptor for cytopathic ALV strains ALV-B and ALV-D by expression cloning methods (Brojatsch et al., 1996) . Mouse cells that usually do not support infection by ALV were rendered permissive by expression of a cDNA encoding CAR1, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) family (Brojatsch et al., 1996) . These findings, along with evidence for direct interaction of CAR1 with the surface (Su) subunit of ALV Env, indicate that CAR1 serves as a receptor for ALV (Brojatsch et al., 1996) . Based on the evidence for the function of TNF-R family members in apoptosis, the capacity of ALV to induce cell death following CAR1 engagement was assessed. Soluble ALV-Bderived Su was capable of inducing apoptosis in a CAR-1 dependent manner (Brojatsch et al., 1996) . These findings indicate that attachment of cytopathic ALV strains to CAR-1 results in apoptosis. Although the precise pathway to cell death evoked following CAR-1 ligation remains undefined, it is likely similar to proapoptotic signaling following attachment of death ligands with members of the TNFR family (Lavrik et al., 2005) . Apoptosis induction following BHV-1 infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells or bovine B lymphoma cells also may be dependent on receptor binding. Initial investigation into the mechanism by which BHV-1 induces apoptosis indicated that BHV-1 virions inactivated by photochemical treatment with trioxsalen and UV irradiation remained capable of inducing apoptosis (Hanon et al., Fig. 2 . Initiation of proapoptotic pathways during cell entry. Three different stages of virus infection that occur early in infection prior to de novo synthesis of viral mRNA and proteins can initiate death signaling. Virus-receptor interactions at the cell surface can trigger death signaling either directly by engagement of death receptors by virus or indirectly through activation of signaling pathways that regulate the function of classical apoptotic pathways. Virus uncoating within the endosome may also result in activation of prodeath signaling by perturbing the properties of host membranes though fusion of host and viral membranes by enveloped viruses or by disruption of membrane integrity by nonenveloped viruses. In addition, products of viral disassembly generated within endosomes may trigger signaling pathways that culminate in cell death. The delivery of subviral particles or disassembled viral components into the host cytosol subsequent to successful membrane penetration also can mediate proapoptotic signaling.
