Whenever interpreting any influenza diagnostic test, the emergency physician or other health care professional must keep in mind the limitations of these tests, especially for RIDTs. In addition, the clinician should be aware of the disease prevalence in the community at any given time, because the level of influenza activity is known to affect the accuracy and reliability of test results. With respect to patient management, a positive influenza test result does not necessarily rule out any overlying coinfection by additional pathogens, and in the case of initial negative influenza test results from less sensitive diagnostic methods like RIDTs, the clinician should contemplate additional diagnostic testing (such as RT-PCR or culture) and decide whether antiviral treatment should be initiated empirically.
