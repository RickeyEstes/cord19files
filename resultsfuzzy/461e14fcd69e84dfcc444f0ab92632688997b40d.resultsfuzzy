The 26 studies included in this literature review were collated into three categories: background information on risk factors for transmission and virus survival on fomites, epidemiology and outbreak investigations, and experimental studies with swine bioassays. Information extracted from these studies may overlap into more than one category and, thus, may be discussed in more than one section. Additionally, the study summaries provided in this section are not meant to be detailed and fully comprehensive but rather are focused on the information pertinent to this literature review, namely, non-animal origin feed ingredients.
