The evidence from the included reviews is presented here by thematic analysis of determinants, grouped into four content categories: individual, job-related, interpersonal, and organisational determinants and consequences. Each of these content categories is divided by strength of evidence categories, within which we also account for the number and quality of the reviews' included primary studies and the outcome [48] 2007 [44] 2008 [45] 2010 [11] 2011 [46] 2012 [47] 2013 [41] 2013 [43] 2014 [42] Bycio 1995 [60] x x . All consequences were reported in relation to turnover. No reviews of determinants or consequences of turnover in adult nursing were judged to be of high quality. Seven reviews were judged as of moderate quality/moderate risk of bias and addressed all four content categories of determinants. Two reviews were judged to be of poor quality.
