The performances of LD-PCR and RM-PCR for detection of pertussis pathogens were compared in the dual-tested group, Cohort 3 (n = 490). A total of 27 (5.5 %) positive specimens were detected in this cohort, including both B. pertussis (n = 25) and B. parapertussis (n = 2) ( Table 1 ; Fig. 1 ). If the combined detection of pertussis pathogens (total n = 27, including two B. parapertussis) by either RM-PCR or LD-PCR was used as the reference stand- reproducible; the one case missed by RM-PCR was positive for a single target and reproducible by LD-PCR. Six of the 490 specimens in Cohort 3 had discordant results, with one specimen positive only by LD-PCR only and 5 samples positive by RM-PCR only ( Table 1 ). The median age of these 6 subjects was 1.9 years (range 6 weeks to 10 years), with respiratory symptoms present for a median of 5.5 days prior to testing (range 2-9 days). All six subjects had cough at their clinical assessment, and four of these reported coughing paroxysms. Only one child had a known exposure to pertussis, occurring 7 weeks earlier, and had received post-exposure prophylaxis with a macrolide antibiotic. Three of these six cases (all positive by RM-PCR) had pertussis diagnosed at another facility (method unknown) within 3 days prior to evaluation at our institution.
