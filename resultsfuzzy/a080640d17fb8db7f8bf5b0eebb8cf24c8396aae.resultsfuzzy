The presented method was tested by using three robots to locate the source in two release scenarios with different source locations: DS and RS ( Fig. 4 ) . In each scenario, 15 independent experiments were conducted. As shown in Table 3 , for source location DS, the source was successfully located in all 15 experiments, and the success rate (the number of successful experiments divided by the number of total experiments) was 100%; for source location RS, 14 experiments were successful (only 1 experiment failed), and the success rate was 93.3%. These results indicated that the presented method is robust in a time-varying mechanical ventilation environment. Table 3 also lists the averages and standard deviations of the number of steps required to locate the source at DS and RS. Note that each robot moved by the same number of steps in each experiment. Therefore, the average is the average number of steps moved by any one of the robots in all successful experiments. For DS and RS, the average steps were very similar, and the difference between the points was less than one step. However, the standard deviation in steps for DS was slightly larger than that for RS. The larger the standard deviation is, the greater the dispersion of the data. The reason for the observed difference may be that the periodic swinging of the cabinet air conditioner louver from left to right causes periodic changes in the air supply; furthermore, the effect of air supply at DS is significantly greater than that at RS. In other words, the variation in the airflow and concentration field near DS over time is much larger than that near RS. Fig. 7 shows the source localization process of the robots (R1-R3) and the maximum time-averaged concentration collected by the robots at each step in a typical successful experiment (the video of the experiment is provided in the supplemental material). In this experiment, each robot moved 27 steps. After the robots departed, they first found the plume, then tracked the plume and continuously confirmed whether they had found the source during the tracking process. From finding the plume to finally locating the source, the main stages experienced by the robots are becoming trapped in a local extremum area, escaping from the local extremum area, rediscovering the plume, and then tracking the plume.
