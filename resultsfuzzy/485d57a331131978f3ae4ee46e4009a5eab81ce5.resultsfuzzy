In this report, retrovectors coding for GLP-1-Fc (Retro/GLP-1-Fc) were packaged in CHO-S cells and used to transduce CHO-S cells. Transduced CHO-S cells quickly recovered from transduction, and approximately 90% of the cells survived puromycin selection. Stable cell pools were evaluated in 14-day shaking flask fed-batch culture. GLP-1-Fc stable expression cell culture supernatants were analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography with dulaglutide as a reference standard and CHO-S culture supernatant as a negative control. No prominent peaks with retention time identical to that of dulaglutide were detected in the CHO-S supernatant (Background). GLP-1-Fc yields of stable cell pools were 0.3 to 0.7 g/L. Retrovectors from CHO-S were also used to transduce CHO-DG44, and stable cell pools had GLP-1-Fc productivities of 0.1-0.3 g/L. We also packaged retro/GLP-1-Fc in CHO DG44 cells for CHO DG44 cell transduction. GLP-1-Fc yields in CHO DG44 stable cell pools were 0.1 to 0.3 g/L. To obtain single-cell clones with high yields, culture supernatants in 96-well plates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and ELISA to determine productivities. Top 100 clones were scaled up to 15 mL and 50 mL TPP mini-bioreactors for further productivity analysis with ELISA. Finally, top 8 clones were evaluated by 14-day shaking flask fed-batch culture. The supernatants were analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography. These top 8 clones have yields of 1.0 to 2.1 g/L (Table 1) . These clones were obtained within 45 days post retrovector transduction, which is significantly shorter than that of traditional cell line generation technology. To obtain higher productivity, single-cell clones No. 2 and No. 4 were transduced once more with Retro/GLP-1-Fc. Single-cell clones isolated from new stable cell pools have productivities of 2.65-3.15 g/L (Table 1) . GLP-1-Fc stable expression CHO-S cells were also generated with retrovectors packaged in HEK-293. The productivities of top 10 clones are 0.8-2.0 g/L (Single transduction). We could not conclude which packaging system gave rise to relatively higher yielding CHO-S stable cell clones, as available data are limited. However, generation of CHO-S stable cells with retrovectors from HEK-293 is more difficult. Almost 90% of transduced cells died at 4 days post transduction. Except for retroviral transduction-induced cell stress, the following could be other reasons: 1. Change of culture medium during the transduction process; 2. Withdrawal of FBS after transduction. We also generated GLP-1-Fc stable expression CHO-S cells, with the pCHO1.0 plasmid (Thermo Fisher Scientific) bearing a GLP-1-Fc expression cassette. Productivities of top 10 clones are 0.8-1.6 g/L after two rounds of DHFR/MTX-mediated gene amplification. Most of these top clones generated by different methods exhibited a peak viable cell density (VCD) of 30-40 Ã— 10 6 cells/mL, maintained high cell viability (N70%) throughout the 14-day fed-batch culture, and had a similar growth profile and metabolic profiles (lactate, glucose, and glutamine) in shaking flask fed-batch productions using the Dynamis media and Efficient Feed C + supplement (data not shown). These parameters indicate that stable cells generated by this new method have similar cell growth, nutrient consumption, and metabolite production rates as those of stable cells generated by traditional methods. Thus, productivities of stable cells generated by different methods are comparable. The cell culture process could be further optimized based on these parameters to obtain higher productivity and suitable post-translational modifications of GLP-1-Fc. For large-scale commercial manufacturing, cell lines routinely grow for over 25 generations to achieve high-density culture in larger bioreactors (working volume of up to 20,000 L). Long-term productivity stability is a key parameter for CHO stable cell line assessment. We passaged the master cell banks of 11 single-cell clones (duplicated transductions shown in Table 1 ) without selection pressure for 40 days in shaking flasks. CHO-S cells have a doubling time in the range of 17-20 h. Fortyday cultivation corresponds to approximately 48-56 generations. The single-cell clones at days 1 and 40 were fed-batch cultured in shaking flasks to determine GLP-1-Fc productivity. As shown in Fig. 1 , the loss of productivity after 40 days of culture is less than 5%. Retrovectors could integrate multiple copies of viral DNA into transcriptionally active sites on cellular chromosomes. The insertion of the viral DNA into the host cell genome is catalyzed by the virus-encoded integrase. Murine leukemia virus (MLV) has distinct preferences, favoring integration at transcription start sites and CpG islands. Retrovectors could efficiently generate genetically stable, highly expressing cell lines [15, 16] . This unique advantage of retrovectors has also been proven using the Catalent's commercial GPEx system [17] . For protein quality issues, the integrity of GLP-1-Fc was analyzed by peptide mapping. GLP-1-Fc recombinant proteins have identical amino acid sequence as that of dulaglutide molecules (data not shown). The bioactivity of GLP-1-Fc was evaluated by an in vitro fluorescencebased GPCR signal cascade activation assay. Compared with commercial Trulicity (relative bioactivity was set at 1.0), the relative bioactivity of GLP-1-Fc was 0.9-1.0. Viral safety is a key concern in the development process of recombinant proteins from mammalian cells. Contamination events in the biopharmaceutical industry could be catastrophic. The main purpose of this new retrovector package system is to eliminate potential virus contamination at the cell line development stage. It is not applicable to clear viruses already existing in CHO cells, such as endogenous retrovirus-like particles (RVLPs), which could be detected by electron microscopy [18] . These RVLPs are not infectious, and they have not been associated with any disease state in humans. However, CHO stable cell lines generated with retrovectors packaged in HEK-293 cells have chances for viral contamination. CHO cells are permissive to multiple types of viruses such as Adenovirus, Parainfluenza virus, Bovine respiratory syncytial virus, Vesicular stomatitis virus, Reovirus, and Bluetongue virus [14] . All the viruses listed above could be transmitted from either HEK-293 cells [11, 12, 13] or fetal bovine serum [8] . We believe there are unknown or undetected viruses existing in HEK-293 and bovine serum. CHO cells may be permissive to these unknown or undetected viruses. Alternative retrovector packaging cell line, such as NIH 3T3, still faces a similar situation as that of HEK-293. It is urgent to eliminate potential virus contamination from the retrovector packaging system at the step of stable line generation. Our new packaging system will eliminate potential viral contamination from traditional packaging cell lines and fetal bovine serum.
