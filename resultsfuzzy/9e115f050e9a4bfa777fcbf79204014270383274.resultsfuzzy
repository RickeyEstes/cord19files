Compound 3 was isolated as white amorphous powder. A molecular formula C 29 H 36 O 11 was established from the HRESIMS quasi-molecular ion peak at m/z 561.2339 [M + H] + . The IR, UV, and NMR spectral data of 3 were in agreement with those of 4 except for the appearance of new signals at δ H 2.08 /δ C 20.8 (COCH 3 ) and 171.7 (COCH 3 ) characteristic for an acetyl group in 3. Its attachment at C-17 was confirmed by the 3 J HMBC cross peak of H-16 to the carbonyl group of acetyl moiety at δ C 171.7 and further secured by the ESIMS ion peak at 357.2 [(M + H)-(Glu+Acetyl)] + . In addition, 3 was 42 mass units and one degree of unsaturation more than 4, confirming the presence of the acetyl moiety. The UV absorption maxima at 219, 251, and 293 nm indicated a diarylheptanoid structure of 3 (27). Its IR spectrum displayed bands ascribable to hydroxyl (3465 cm -1 ), ester carbonyl (1725 cm -1 ), ketone carbonyl (1715 cm -1 ), and benzene (1598 cm -1 ) functionalities (28). The 1 H NMR spectrum showed two singlet methoxy groups at δ H 3.95 (4-OCH 3 ) and 3.79 (3-OCH 3 ) ( Table 2) . They correlated with the carbons resonating at δ C 61.9 (4-OCH 3 ) and 61.7 (3-OCH 3 ), respectively in HMQC spectrum. Their connectivity at C-4 and C-3 was proven by the HMBC cross peaks of 4-OCH 3 to C-4 (δ C 145.0) and 3-OCH 3 to C-3 (δ C 146.9). Four aromatic proton signals at δ H 7.06 (dd, J = 6.6, 1.5 Hz, H-15), 6.87 (d, J = 6.6 Hz, H-16), 6.69 (d, J = 1.5 Hz, H-18), and 6.67 (s, H-19), which correlated with carbons at δ C 129.6 (C-15), 122.8 (C-16), 132.4 (C-18), and 129.1 (C-19) in HMQC spectrum, indicating the presence of 1,2,4-tri-substituted and 1,2,3,4,5-penta-substituted benzene moieties in 3 (20,21). They were established by the COSY cross peaks of H-15 to H-16 and H-18 and further secured by the HMBC correlations of H-15 to C-17 and C-18, H-16 to C-1 and C-14, H-18 to C-14 and C-17, and H-19 to C-3 and C-5 ( Figure 2 ). The connectivity of two phenyl In the HMBC, the cross peak of H-1` to C-5 (δ C 148.7) established the placement of glucose at C-5. Furthermore, signals for six methylene groups at δ H 1.80-3.07 and ketone carbonyl at δ C 213.6 (C-11), characteristic for heptanoid moiety in 3 were observed. In the COSY spectrum, the spin system started from H-7 to H-10 and cross peak of H-12 to H-13 established this moiety. It was secured by the observed HMBC cross peaks of H-9/C-7 and C-11, H-10/C-8, H-12/C-13, and H-13/C-11. The attachment of heptanoid moiety at C6-C14 of the biphenyl moiety was secured by the HMBC cross peaks of H-8/C-6, H-19/C-7, and H-18/C-13. Consequently, 3 was concluded to be 17-O-acetyl myricanone 5-O-βglucopyranoside and named alnuheptanoid B. Compounds 1-5 were identified to be myricanone (1) of the spectroscopic data and comparison with literature. The antioxidant activity of the isolated cyclic diarylheptanoids (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) was determined using DPPH free radical scavenging system at concentration 50 µM. The results showed that, 1 and 2 had significant antioxidant activity. While, 3-5 showed moderate activity in comparison with propyl gallate (a known antioxidant) ( Table 3) . Their antioxidant effect was related to the number of free hydroxyl groups in their structures. Compounds 1 and 2 showed significant activities compared to propyl gallate at the same concentration. However, blocking of the hydroxyl group by an acetyl or glucose moiety leads to a decrease in the activity as in 3-5 (33). Compounds 1-5 were evaluated for their antiinflammatory effects using carrageenin induced paw edema model. Compound 2 showed the highest activity comparable to indomethacin (10 mg/kg) (Table 4) . Also, 1, 3, 4, and 5 showed potent activity at dose 10 mg/kg after 4 h. The phenolic compounds are known to inhibit prostaglandins synthesis enzymes, more specifically the endoperoxide (26). It was reported that, prostaglandin like substances are released during the second phase of carrageenin induced edema (34, 35). So, the anti-inflammatory effects of the tested compounds may be due to inhibition of prostaglandin like substances. The observed activity of these compounds might be through the inhibition of the inflammatory prostanoids (36, 37) . In this work, we can make a conclusion on the SAR of the tested cyclic diarylheptanoids. It was observed that, the phenolic hydroxyl groups are responsible for anti-inflammatory activity as in 1 and 2 (36, 37). Glucosidation of phenolic OH group leads to reduce the activity as in 3-5. Secondary alcoholic hydroxyl group in aliphatic chain might increase the activity as in 1 and 5 in comparison to the other compounds.
