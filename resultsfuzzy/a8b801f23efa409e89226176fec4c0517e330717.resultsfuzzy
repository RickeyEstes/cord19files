Effects of esfenvalerate exposure: mortality and swimming behavior Fish larvae are known to be highly sensitive to esfenvalerate, with effects on swimming performance and enhanced susceptibility to predation resulting from concentrations as low as 0.0625 μg/L -1 [10] . Behavior alterations are construed as being consequential to the reported neurological mode of action of this pesticide, further affecting foraging, migration and reproduction [30] . Toxicity of pyrethroids in the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary is likely alleviated by the presence of particles and organic matter, and to date concentrations of esfenvalerate detected in the water column were low, however, concentrations in winter storm runoff from agricultural lands have been reported up to 0.093 μg.L -1 [31] , influencing our decision to investigate dose response exposures to both high and environmentally relevant concentrations in confirmatory studies. In terms of mortality, 10-d old delta smelt were only slightly more sensitive in this study (LC 50,24 h = 0.19 μg.L -1 ) than 52-d old (LC 50,24 h = 0.24 μg.L -1 ), however swimming performance of the younger larvae was affected at a concentration approximating one third of that observed affecting older fish (figure 1). Swimming abnormality in 10-d old larvae, intensified with increasing esfenvalerate concentration at 4 h, escalating significantly after 24 h exposure (figure 1a). This swimming abnormality was also concentration dependent in 52-d old fish, however swimming effects resulting from different time point measurements differed only at the highest exposure concentration of 0.250 μg.L -1 (figure 1b), where effects on motion increased from 22.5% anomaly at 4 h to 45% at 24 h. Behavioral abnormalities, reduced food intake and growth, as well as increased susceptibility to predation were reported in fathead minnow larvae exposed to esfenvalerate for 4 h to concentrations above 0.455 μg.L -1 [10] . Significant swimming impairments were determined in this study at 0.250 μg.L -1 , thus delta smelt are highly sensitive to sublethal esfenvalerate exposure. Furthermore, bioaccumulation in rainbow trout have resulted in concentrations 400 times higher than background ambient levels http://extoxnet.orst.edu.
