For the preparation of pure lymphocyte suspensions, the method of Boyum (14) was used with minor modifications (15, 16) . Blood was drawn in Li-heparin (Sigma) containing polypropylene syringes (130 USP Li-heparin/lOml blood), diluted (1: 1) with sterile filtered phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.3)) well mixed, and layered onto 4ml Lymphoprep (Nyegaard & Co. AS, Oslo, Norway; density 1.077 f 0.001 g/ml [2O"C]) in 15 ml tubes. The tubes were centrifuged (400g; 20 min; 20°C) in a ,Beckman J-6M/E centrifuge. The mononuclear cells at the interphase were aspirated and diluted with an equal volume of PBS containing 2% (v/v) foetal calf serum (FCS; Gibco Limited, Paisley, Scotland). The suspension was centrifuged (25Og; 15 min; 20°C) and the super-Initial measurements in medium containing lymphocytes showed absence of ACTH. From this observation it was deduced that ACTH, produced by lymphocytes, was still an integral part of the precursor molecule, POMC. Methods were evaluated whereby ACTH could be released from the POMC molecule. After the initial culture period, the lymphocyte culture was treated with 3% (m/v) pepsin and the pH adjusted to pH2 for optimal conditions of pepsin. From Table 1 it is clear that this step was necessary for the release of ACTH from the precursor-molecule since the pepsin-treated cultures showed statistically significant increased ACTH levels (p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test). Investigations into the possibility that pH alone natant aspirated. The pellet was resuspended in 2% (v/v) FCS/PBS and centrifuged (350g; 10 mitt; 20°C). This step was repeated and the pellet resuspended in 10% (v/v) FCS/RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco Limited, Paisley, Scotland; pH 7.3) containing 0.6% (v/v) antibiotics (Novopen lo3 U/ml + Novostrep lo3 U/ml dissolved in 100 ml sterile distilled water). The cell suspension was transferred to a petri dish and incubated in a Hot-pack COz-incubator for 30-45 min (37°C; 5% CO*; 95% humidity). The supernatant was aspirated and the concentration of lymphocytes determined with a Coulter-counter. Aliquots of the lymphocyte suspension (1 x lo6 cells) were incubated in lml incubation medium (10% v/v FCS/RPMI-1640; pH 7.3; 0.6% antibiotics) in a COz-incubator (37°C; 5% CO,; 95% humidity). Synthesis of POMC was terminated by adjusting the pH to pH2. Processing of POMC was carried out at 37°C for 24 hours. The released ACTH was subsequently measured quantitatively using a standard ACTH (1251) Irma adrenocorticotropin-hormone kit (Euro-Diagnostics BV, Apeldoorn, Holland). The sensitivity of the assay is 8pg/ml as judged by a 2.5 SD change of duplicate standards from zero values. Both inter-and intraassay variability was less than 10%. It should be mentioned that this kit is highly specific for ACTH1-39 and that ACTH fragments l-24, l-32 and 18-39 do not interfere with the assay. Aliquots of suspensions containing 1 X lo6 cells/ml were also incubated for different times before pH adjustment. From Figure 1 the linearity between ACTH production and time of incubation is clear. In addition, it was found that ACTH production increased linearly with increasing concentrations of lymphocytes (Fig. 2) . Lymphocytes of 5 male controls (mean age If: SD = 33.2 k 8Syr) displayed ACTH levels of 97.4 f 31.2 pg/106 cells/24 hour, while those of 10 female controls (mean age k SD = 34.0 f 9.6yr) showed levels of 110.3 + 45.8pg ACTH/106 cells/24 hour. No statistically significant difference between the two sexes could be detected (Table 2 ; Mann-Whitney U-test).
