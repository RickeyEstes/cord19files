We conducted a large experiment to compare the vulnerability of a wide range of network topologies (Fig. 1) to a broad range of epidemic spread scenarios, that we obtained by varying randomly the three epidemic parameters of the SNES (ρ, ι and τ, see Section 2). In simulated networks, the magnitude of epidemic outbreaks (Fig. 3) was well explained by the combination of epidemic parameters and by network properties (Table 1) . Surprisingly, topological properties, and particularly the density of infection pathways (quantified by network connectance), and their redundancy (quantified by network clustering, that is how often two nodes pointing to another one are linked, and by network robustness, see below) had a stronger effect on outbreak magnitude than the epidemic parameters when a broad range of network topology is considered (Fig. 4) . Network robustness (R) resulted also more important than epidemic parameters (and the second most important factor). This result was very consistent in two different scenarios where we assumed, respectively, that all nodes had the same susceptibility to infection (0.5), or a random susceptibility extracted from a normal distribution with mean 0.5 and standard deviation 0.1. This suggests that outbreak magnitude is driven by average susceptibility more than by its variation across individuals. Thus, we report and discuss here only the results referring to the first scenario. We replicated the same procedure (as was applied to the simulated networks) using a set of real-world networks. The experiment with simulated networks explored a very broad range of network topologies, and demonstrated how network topology affects epidemic outbreak magnitude even more than epidemiological parameters. Conversely, for our test on real world scenarios, we focused on a set of networks representing independent replicates of the same exact real world setting, and that therefore exhibited a relatively low variability in their structural features (Fig. 2) . This permitted us to investigate if (and to what extent) small variations in network properties may be major determinants of epidemic outbreak magnitude. Even in this case, where network topological variability was limited, important epidemiological parameters, such as the one controlling the duration of the infective stage (ρ), and the one modelling the immunizing effect of pathogens (ι), had a negligible effect in determining outbreak magnitude (Fig. 4) . Transmission rate (τ) emerged as the most important factor, although both network robustness and network connectance had very strong effects (much higher than those of ρ and ι). The other network parameters were less relevant, and their effects were not always consistent with those observed in the set of simulated networks. For example, clustering was positively associated to epidemic magnitude in simulated networks, but negatively associated in real world networks (Fig. 4) , which highlights how the dynamics and outcome of an epidemic event are affected by network structure in complicated ways that cannot be captured by individual basic network properties, and that do not offer a straightforward interpretation. In both experiments, the Unique Robustness Measure (R) (Schneider et al., 2011) was consistently one of the most influential factors, and positively associated with outbreak magnitude (Figs. 4, 5) . The R measure is computed by counting the number of nodes present in the largest connected component after nodes are progressively removed, thus representing the ability of a system such as a power grid or the Internet to delay collapse after subsequent failures (Schneider et al., 2011) . In the context of epidemics, R may offer a synthetic picture of the redundancy of infection pathways. In a network with higher R, a pathogen will have many chances to spread between nodes and will be less affected by the immunization of many nodes (or their death, leading, in both cases, to their removal from the network). This finding has two important implications. On the one hand, it indicates that the networks where a potential outbreak is predicted to be strongest will also be the most difficult to protect, since having a high R complicates immunization procedures based, for example, on targeted vaccination (Morone and Makse, 2015) . On the other hand, it suggests that R's ability to synthesize various aspects of network structure in a single value might make it a useful index to rank networks on the basis of their intrinsic vulnerability, thereby offering a way to prioritize preparedness efforts by focusing preventive and surveillance actions on the most vulnerable networks. This idea was supported by our experimental results, which confirmed the Unique Robustness Measure, R as an efficient measure of intrinsic network vulnerability. In particular, the rank of field vole networks according to R was very consistent with the rank obtained by ordering networks on the basis of their vulnerability in a broad range of epidemic scenarios, that we modeled by running a set of classical SIR models (Pastor-Satorras et al., 2015) under different combinations of infection/recovery probabilities ( Fig. 6 ; adjusted R-squared: 0.59, p < 0.00001, regression line y = 0.77x + 0.12). We quantified vulnerability in terms of the total fraction of nodes reached by the infection throughout the epidemic simulation (see Fig. 3 -II). This result is particularly convincing when considering the limited topological variability of the field vole contact networks (see Fig. 2 ), which makes them a challenging benchmark to test the sensitivity of R as a vulnerability measure. Using different criteria of node removal to compute R (namely, node degree and betweenness) led to very consistent results (adjusted R-squared: 0.60, p < 0.00001, regression line y = 0.78x + 0.11 when node degree was used; adjusted R-squared: 0.61, p < 0.00001, regression line y = 0.78x + 0.11 when node betweenness was used). Intuition suggests that the outcome of an epidemic should be affected mainly by disease behaviour (in terms, for example, of transmission, infection dynamics, or latency) (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2009 ). Yet, Table 1 Effects of network properties and epidemic parameters on outbreak magnitude. The table reports the results of the Canonical Correlation analysis performed on the outcomes of simulations performed on both the set of randomly generated networks, and the set of real-world networks indicating contacts between field voles (n = 10,000 in both cases). I: epidemic duration; II: cumulated fraction of nodes reached by the infection; III-IV: maximum and average fraction of infected nodes per step; V: area under the curve of fraction of infected nodes per step); τ: pathogen's transmission rate; ρ: duration of infection (i.e., survival time of the pathogen in the host); ι: pathogen's immunization effect on hosts over repeated infections.
