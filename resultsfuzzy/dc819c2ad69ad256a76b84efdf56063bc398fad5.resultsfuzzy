Development of PV pv with Sabin strain capsid proteins. In a previous study, we produced type 1, 2, and 3 PV pv , which possess a luciferase-encoding PV replicon based on the Mahoney strain in the capsids of wildtype strains (type 1 Mahoney, type 2 MEF-1, and type 3 Saukett A in PV1 pv [WT], PV2 pv [WT] , and PV3 pv [WT], respectively) 12, 21 . Here, we constructed PV capsid expression vectors that express the capsid proteins of type 1, 2, and 3 Sabin strains. We also produced type 1, 2 and 3 PV pv , which possess a luciferase-encoding PV replicon based on the Mahoney strain in the capsids of type 1, 2, and 3 Sabin strains, respectively (PV1 pv [Sabin], PV2 pv [Sabin], and PV3 pv [Sabin], respectively) ( Fig. 1A) . We obtained type 1, 2, and 3 PV pv (Sabin) with high titres (2.5 × 10 7 , 1.2 × 10 7 IU, and 6.0 × 10 6 IU per mL, respectively), which were about 10-fold lower than PV pv (WT) 12, 21 . Next, we optimized the amounts of PV pv (Sabin) for pPNT with standard antisera (Fig. 1B) . Specific and similar neutralization profiles were observed for PV pv (Sabin) at a range of the examined amounts (200, 400, or 800 IU) 21 . We used 400 IU of PV pv (Sabin) in pPNT.
