The component parts of the resilience definition shared by most studies were as follows: an adversity must be experienced to demonstrate resilience, resilience is the ability to maintain healthy levels of function over time despite adversity or to return to normal function after adversity, and resilience is a dynamic concept as opposed to a fixed personality trait. This is in agreement with flourished across many disciplines of psychology and health because of the rising popularity of positive psychology in these areas. Although sparsely studied in the diabetes population, in other areas of chronic illness and stress such as HIVÃ¾ men, survivors of violent trauma or battered women in shelters, resilience has been found to be associated with better emotional and physical health. Resilience measured using a resilience scale/questionnaire. A resilience factor score was derived using 4 scales, used to measure: optimism, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and self-mastery. Three groups identified: low, moderate, and high resilience based on the lower, middle, and upper tertiles of the resilience factor score.
