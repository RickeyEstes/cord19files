Arginine side chains in subunit a as NMR reporter groups. To analyze the interactions of arginine residues in the proton channel of ATP synthase, we used detergent purified subunit a and the previously designed model protein, which consists of subunit a fused to the C-terminal α-helix (helix-II) of subunit c, followed by a complete copy of the second subunit c (Fig. 1C) . Our previous work 22 shows that this protein incorporates into the complete ATP synthase in the correct transmembrane topology, and the arrangement of the transmembrane (Fig. 1D ). Both subunit a and the a-c/2-c protein were successfully purified in LMPG ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ), a lysophospholipid, previously shown to produce good quality spectra of membrane proteins 23 . Our screening of various detergents with purified subunit a confirmed that LMPG produces the best spectral quality. Subunit a was found to be monodisperse in this detergent with the apparent molecular weight of the protein-detergent complex of 48 KDa, as estimated by size-exclusion chromatography. However, even under the optimal conditions, α-helical membrane proteins such as the 271 amino acid residue long subunit a and the 411 amino acid residue long a-c/2-c protein remain a serious technical challenge for NMR. Neither protein yielded sufficient spectral resolution to proceed with structure determination by NMR. However, the signals of the side chains of all four arginine residues in subunit a were well resolved and presented themselves as useful reporter groups to test several hypotheses regarding subunit a and the a-c interface structure. We were particularly interested in R210, the putative gateway residue in the proton channel of the ATP synthase, and in R140, which, on the basis of the earlier studies, was believed to form a stabilizing salt bridge with D124 of subunit a. We have assigned the signals of the R210 and R140 residues by comparing the spectra of the wild type and R210Q ( Fig. 2A) or R140Q (Fig. 2B ) subunit a variant respectively.
