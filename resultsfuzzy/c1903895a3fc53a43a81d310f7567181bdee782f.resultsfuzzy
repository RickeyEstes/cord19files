The synthetic strategy adopted for the preparation of the target derivatives is depicted in S3 and S4 Files. Indoline-2,3-diones 1a-c were refluxed with 99% hydrazine hydrate in methanol to obtain the corresponding hydrazone derivatives 2a-c.The reaction of hydrazones 2a-c with different substituted benzaldehydes 3a-e in ethanol in the presence of a catalytic amount of glacial acetic acid furnished the target derivatives 4a-o with 67-83% yields (S3 File). The IR spectra of compounds 4a-o displayed absorption bands around 3400 cm -1 for the indolic NH group in addition to the absorption bands of carbonyl groups near 1720 cm -1 which is consistent with the previously reported ones for compounds 4a [26] and 4f [27] . Also, their 1 H NMR spectra revealed a D 2 O-exchangeable signals in the region δ 10.84-11.01 ppm attributable to the NH protons of the indolin-2-one moieties, in addition to the signal of the methine protons (-CH = N-) in the region δ 8.55-8.70 ppm which is in accordance with those previously reported for compounds 4a [26] , 4f [27] and 4i [28] . Moreover, the 13 C NMR spectra of compounds 4a-o showed signals resonating around δ 163 ppm, characteristic of C = O carbons. Direct methylation and benzylation of indoline-2,3-dione 1a with dimethyl sulfate and benzyl bromide were carried out in the presence of sodium hydroxide or potassium carbonate to furnish intermediates 6a and 6b, respectively. The second group of the target indolin-2-ones 7a-e was obtained in good yields (67-79%) through the reaction of the two intermediates 6a and 6b with the appropriate 3-hydrazonoindolin-2-one 2a-d in refluxing ethyl alcohol using catalytic amount of glacial acetic acid (S4 File). The IR spectra of the target compounds 7a-e revealed the presence of the characteristic absorption bands due to the NH and carbonyl groups of indolin-2-one moieties. Moreover, the 1 H NMR spectra of 7a-e revealed the presence of the singlet indolic NH protons at a δ 11.02-11.15 ppm. Also, the signals of the aliphatic protons (N-CH 3 ) of compounds 7a, b were observed as singlet signals around δ 3.22 ppm, while the benzylic protons (-CH 2 ) of 7c-e appeared as singlet signals close to δ 5.01 ppm.
