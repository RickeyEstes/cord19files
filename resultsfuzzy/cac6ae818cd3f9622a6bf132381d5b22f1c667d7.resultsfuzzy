Specimens ofXestospongia sp. and an unidentified haplosclerid sponge were collected by hand using SCUBA at Hagakhak and Haningad Islands, Philippines, 1997, and were kept frozen until extraction. Both sponges were processed in the same manner. The concentrated methanolic extract of the Xestospongia sp., obtained by soaking the diced sponge tissue, was partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The aqueous extract, which had shown mild activity in the initial screens against prostrate, human colon, colon carcinoma and mouse lung carcinoma, was chromatographed on Amberlite XAD-2 resin, followed by Sephadex LH-20 We initially assigned these signals as an N-methyl doublet at 8 3.61 (J = 11 Hz) but this possibility was eliminated when the HMQC experiment indicated that the two proton signals were correlated to two carbon signals at slightly different chemical shifts. Since N-methyl sulfamates normally give rise to methyl singlets, s we had to account for an N-methyl sulfamate group that adopted two different conformations (see Building on from a basic steroid structure, the structure of haplosamate A (1) The stel~ochemistry at C-24 was assigned with reasonable confidence on the basis of the large coupling constant between H=23 and H-24, which required a preferred anti conformation, and NOESY data. Haplosamates A (1) and B (2) did not possess useful activity against tumor cell lines but were shown to inhibit HIV-1 integrase with ICs0 values of 50 ttg/mL and 15 ttg/mL respectively. The desulfated compound 3 did not inhibit HIV=I integrase. From these results and previous research, m2 it appears that the sulfate groups are important for activity.
