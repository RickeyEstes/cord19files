While indoor tornado carrying smoky contaminants can be easily visualised through experiments, the observations were only reflecting the high concentrated smoke region near the centre of the vortex. However, the actual size of the effective vortex could be much wider than the highly concentrated centre. It is extremely difficult to visualise or measure the effective vortex boundary through experimental measurements. Simulations, on the other hand, would have full potential to identify and visualise the effective boundary of the vortex, which would be the key leading to a better and deeper understanding of the indoor tornado. Therefore, the vortex identification criteria (e.g. vortex intensity and core region) were firstly studied and discussed in conjunction with the aforementioned factors to investigate the impacts of these factors on the development of the vortex and to provide accurate 3D visualisation of the indoor tornado.
