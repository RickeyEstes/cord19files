It should be noted that price wars and collusion in China's airline markets largely occurred on a route-by-route basis. There has not been a case where a price war or collusive price rise occurred simultaneously between the two carriers in all the markets they served. This is because pricing decisions were decentralised to the station managers or even the marketing staff at an airport who could closely monitor and respond promptly to rival airlines' prices. Therefore, once an airline significantly cuts the price on a particular route, almost all the airlines that operate on that route will match the price and get involved. Zhang and Round (2009a) have reported that almost identical prices were charged by China Eastern and China Southern on the same routes during 2002-2004. Based on the definition of price wars and price collusion discussed earlier, the average fall when China Eastern participated in a price war, and the average increase when it engaged in a price-fixing collusion, was 26% and 31%, respectively, and 28% and 35%, 8 Our conversations with some of the airline sales managers in Shanghai show that this is one of the enforcement mechanisms employed to prevent cheating. 9 The government has helped the airlines through difficult times, however. For example, during the SARS period, all airlines were exempted from some taxes. 10 Note that we use the airline dummies to capture the overall effect of these differences between airlines, not the asymmetries of a particular route. respectively, when China Southern did so. Figs. 2 and 3 show that neither price wars nor price collusion lasted long. Typically 74% and 86% of the collusions in which China Eastern and China Southern participated, respectively, broke down within one month, while 59% and 69% of the price wars that the two airlines were involved in also ended within one month. The average duration of a price war was 1.7 months for China Eastern and 1.5 for China Southern. This is very different from the findings of Morrison and Winston (1996) , who claimed that nearly 90% of the fare wars lasted two or fewer quarters with an average duration of 1.8 quarters. The price collusions in our study seem to be shorter lived than price wars, with an average of 1.5 months for China Eastern and 1.4 for China Southern. However, it can also be seen in the figures that there was a small number of instances where collusion lasted for more than two months. Longer duration is an indicator of successful collusion. In a country where antitrust laws make explicit pricing agreements illegal and collusion can only be achieved implicitly through repeated interactions, firms might use the lessons they learned from past experience and act cautiously in upsetting an implicit collusion, as they do not know whether they can quickly establish another one. However, given that the price agreements in China were not totally illegal and could be achieved in many ways, a price agreement could be established quickly any time the airlines wished. If one of the members was not happy with the outcome of an agreement, collusion could quickly break down because of the lack of an effective enforcement mechanism, but it was easy enough to form another one soon thereafter. This might explain why price wars and price collusion in China have tended to be short-lived. The natural questions are how a price war started and how it ended in China's airline markets. Without resorting to in-depth interviews with the relevant parties, the true causes may never be established by merely relying on statistical data. In fact, as the services provided by different airlines are not perfectly substitutable, there will always be a relatively disadvantaged airline that has lower revenue on a route than that of other members of the collusive group. In most instances, the only choice for a disadvantaged airline to increase its total revenue is to cut prices (owing to the elastic demand at the agreed price level). When all the airlines follow suit, a price war will break out. The base airline (with headquarters in the city) usually plays an important role in coordinating an agreement to end the war on the route out of that city. Our interviewees all expressed the view that the base airline should take the responsibility to call all the relevant parties in for talks. If this did not work, the station managers would report the case to their own top management for action, and communication at senior levels could then terminate a war. This suggests that, quite often, the end of a war implies the formation of a collusive agreement. In this sense, price wars could be interpreted as a means to enforce collusive agreements, sometimes leading to a more stable agreement after lessons had been learned. One strategy used by the airlines to keep a collusive agreement alive, according to our interviews, is to design a plan to accommodate the disadvantaged carrier on a route. For example, the main carriers could allow the disadvantaged airline to sell at a lower price level, say 10% lower, while others stick to the agreed price, so that all airlines can have roughly equal revenue in a particular market proportional to the number of seats that each carrier offers. Our data indicate that there was a slight increase in the duration of collusive agreements in 2004. Our interviews suggested that in 2005 on a small number of routes, the agreements using such approach were quite successful. However, given that any collusive contract could not cover all the aspects of the participants' interests and that the outside conditions on a particular route changed from time to time, it was the norm for agreements to collapse frequently, followed by a new one formed soon after the price wars, with new additional conditions to suit each individual airline's needs. The different goals of airlines on a particular route could also be one of the causes of price wars and explain the irrational behaviour observed during these wars. The big three airlines had much less trouble than the local airlines in making profits due to their widespread networks which made cross-subsidising possible. Our interviewees emphasised that once price wars broke out, the large airlines could be more irrational if the markets concerned were not their main profit earners, but they were the main sources of revenue for the local airlines. On these routes, the major airlines' goals could be quite different from those of the local airlines. They may simply want to enhance or maintain their market shares, and so the large airlines could start a war on these routes and set the price at unexpectedly low levels. For most cases, price wars were begun by an airline with a relatively small market share and a poor load factor. For airlines that dominated the routes, they most likely responded by cutting their prices, but these prices could remain at least 5% higher than those of the low market share carriers, as they would know that their larger frequencies could offer more flexibility and so they would retain the patronage of most of their passengers. Repeated wars of this kind have led to the larger airlines agreeing to the small market share carriers charging slightly lower prices when negotiating new agreements, as discussed earlier. The difficulties in enforcing collusive airline agreements are considerable, given the need to cater for different groups of passengers. For example, the cheaters could disguise their price cuts in the name of discounts offered to tourist groups. Thus, a booking for a group appears to be for a return tourist trip, but the cheating airline may cancel their return flight after the outbound flight departs. These passengers are in fact not tourists but have been given tour group prices. However, such behaviour could be revealed in some way to rival airlines by the travel agent or the passengers, and a price war would soon follow. Given the lack of effective punishments to impose on cheaters, apart from price wars, our interviewees claim that the negotiation and coordination abilities of the sales managers are the key to preventing wars and maintaining the price agreements for a long time. Given the somewhat arbitrary nature of our definition of price wars and collusion, we then tried alternative definitions of price wars and collusion. The duration of the two pricing behaviours are reported in Figs. 4 and 5. Awar1 represents the beginning of a price war when the price has decreased by 15% from the previous month and an end of the war when the monthly average price has gone up by 10% from the previous month (or when the accumulated increases reach 10% in the previous consecutive months 11 ). Awar2 alternatively defines a price war with the necessary decrease being measured as 25% and the increase being 10%. Similarly, we have two definitions for collusion corresponding to Awar1 and Awar2 respectively. Our conclusion does not change significantly with the alternative definitions as shown in Figs. 4 and 5, as the majority of the price wars and collusive conduct episodes still tend to last only one or two months, especially in China Southern's markets. 11 In some cases, the price increases by 3%, 4%, and 5% in three consecutive months rather than by 10% in one month. In these cases, we consider the price war ends in the third month. Figs. 6 and 7 present the number of price wars and the number of instances of collusion that were present in China Eastern's sample markets from January 2002 through to December 2004. Fig. 6 is based on the base definition of price wars and collusion that we discussed in Section 3, i.e., a 20% decrease (increase) at the beginning and a 5% increase (decrease) at the end. The discontinuity in August 2002 is due to missing data for China Eastern on all its routes. Fig. 7 comes from the alternative definitions just discussed. Both price wars and collusion appear to have occurred more frequently after the airline mergers in October 2002 in China Eastern's markets. Generally similar patterns can be found in Figs. 8 and 9 for China Southern. Although we find that price wars and price collusion coexisted for most of the periods, generally, when the frequency of price wars was high, the number of collusive episodes in the sample markets was low, suggesting that seasonal demand changes could be an important factor eliciting the collapse of a collusive agreement. The results of the price war and collusion models for China Eastern are reported in Table 3 and those for China Southern are given in Table 4 . 12 The interpretation of probit coefficients is not analogous to the corresponding coefficients obtained by linear regression models. The magnitude of each coefficient is not especially useful in a practical sense. Therefore, the marginal effect (or partial effect), which shows the effect of an infinitesimal change in a continuous independent variable on the probability of a price war or collusion, is usually reported. In the case of a non-continuous variable, such as a dummy variable, the marginal effect reports the discrete change in the probability of this dummy variable changing from 0 to 1. The marginal effects of the significant variables provided in the two tables were computed at the means of the independent variables. 13 For each model, the Wald test statistic shows that the hypothesis that all the coefficients are simultaneously zero can be rejected at the 1% significance level. 14 In our data sets, the number of passengers variable reflects demand fluctuations both across routes and over time. This may not correspond to the theoretical models of price wars in Green and Porter (1984) and Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) , whose models seem to pertain only to demand fluctuations over time. Although not entirely comparable, the negative sign in the price-war model for China Southern gives some support to the view of Green and Porter that a price war is more likely to erupt when demand is low. 15 Also, the collusion model (China Southern) shows that successful collusion is less likely to be maintained in a market where demand is high. This seems to be consistent with the conclusion in Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) that collusion is hard to maintain in booms. The results of the passenger variable suggest that both price wars and price collusion could happen in a low demand period or in a market where air travel demand is relatively low. It could also be the case that when demand was low, some routes were experiencing price wars, while some others were engaging in price-fixing activities. The seasonal effects as well as the effect of the SARS dummy provide further evidence that demand fluctuations have an impact on the airlines' pricing behaviour. Compared with the shoulder season in June, peak seasons such as January (before the Chinese New Year) and April (before the week-long holiday for Labour Day) in all the models show that an inference can be made about a strong tendency towards collusion and less likelihood of a price war. Our interviews suggest that the airlines are well aware of the times of peak and low seasons. The incentive to coordinate pricing during high seasons is stronger as they believe that the profits in this period can cover the losses in the low seasons. Therefore, it was common practice for the sales managers to meet before the advent of the peak season to form an agreement, as they understood that if they lost peak time revenues, they would suffer losses for the whole year, Therefore, most of airlines observed the agreements quite closely when demand was high, even though this sometimes meant that the flights were not full. 16 This again supports the view of Green and Porter (1984) . However, coefficients on the SARS dummy suggest that when air travel demand was extremely low, the probability of collusion significantly increased for both China Eastern and China Southern. As a result, the likelihood of price wars occurring was reduced. This seems to be consistent with the rationale presented in Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) . Another week-long holiday (1-7 October) does not appear to induce more collusive activities, but the two price-war models show that the chance of getting into a war is diminished in October as well as September for China Southern. For China Eastern, more price wars could be seen in November, which confirms our interview information. For China Southern, as well as January, April, September and October, price wars are also less likely in December. This can be Fig. 6 . Number of price wars and collusive conduct episodes in China Eastern's markets (base definition). 12 Only the results using the base definition of price wars and collusion are reported, as we believe that, based on the work experience of one of the authors in the Chinese airline industry, the base definition is more representative of the actual facts. The models were estimated using Stata command "ivprobit" with a maximum likelihood estimation method. 13 For example, in China Eastern's price-war model, the tourism routes have a 4% higher probability of experiencing a price war (at the means of the independent variables). 14 To avoid the coefficient being too small in magnitude, we rescaled the oapthhi, distance and paxno variables by dividing them by 100. The rescaling will not affect the interpretation of the results (Wooldridge, 2006) . 15 A similar conclusion in support of Green and Porter (1984) was arrived at by Brander and Zhang (1993) who included a macroeconomic variable (real GNP) in their regression and found that it had a significant positive effect on the collusive conduct of United Airlines. 16 This has already been observed in Figs. 6−9. Only China Eastern appears to engage in more price wars in 2003 at the 5% significance level. If we could assume that most of the collusive agreements would last for a long time, then most likely we would have seen price increases in 2003 and 2004. However, a previous study (Zhang and Round, 2009a) has shown that on average, 2003 and 2004 experienced substantial drops in airfares on most routes compared with 2002. The contradictory results suggest that although the reduction in the number of competitors following the mergers would have facilitated the negotiation of price agreements, most were not effectively enforced and quickly died out. Not surprisingly, the declining trend in airfares was not changed by any more frequent engagement in collusion. It is understandable that Air China, with its business mainly centered on international routes, tended to be reluctant to engage in fare wars in its domestic markets. Shanghai Airlines, a strong competitor on many routes out of Shanghai, which shares the same base airport with China Eastern, might be very familiar with China Eastern's operations and thus mutual forbearance and convenient communication might have helped them avoid destructive competition. The presence of China Eastern on China Southern's routes increased the likelihood of both price wars and price collusion at the 10% and 5% significance levels respectively, indicating that these two airlines, of similar size, fought against one another fiercely in one period and cooperated in harmony in another period, or competed on some routes and colluded on others. Table 3 also shows that the presence of China Southern in China Eastern's markets could intensify competition between the two carriers. The presence of Hainan Airlines did not induce more price wars in China Eastern's sample markets. However, its presence could increase the likelihood for China Southern to engage in price wars. This finding is not surprising as Zhang and Round (2009b) found that Hainan Airlines has had the effect of disciplining the major airlines in pricing, especially for China Southern, as the primary bases of the two airlines are geographically quite close. Departures from one of the top 5 busiest airports would be more likely to see a price war in China Eastern's sample markets, but the presence of a busy airport did not have any serious impact on airline cooperation. However, this is not to say that collusion did not happen in the markets departing from these cities. It is possible that that markets associated with these cities are crucial to the airlines involved in terms of generating large amounts of revenue, and therefore it is in every player's interest to keep airfares in these markets as high and stable as possible through collusion. Without dramatic changes in prices, our measurement of collusion cannot capture such types of price cooperation. The tourism markets of both China Eastern and China Southern experienced more price wars, reflecting higher elasticities of travellers' demands on this type of route. The tourism routes had little effect on the likelihood of forming a price union, as disclosed by the price collusion models of the two airlines. In China Southern's hub-to-hub markets, price wars seemed to be less likely to occur. China Southern's price-war model shows that longer routes were more likely to experience price wars. One possible reason could be that relatively low personal disposable income in many areas of China constrains the use of air transport for longdistance travel (in fact, for the vast majority of the population, travel by train is the first choice, especially when long-distance travel is very expensive). An additional possible reason is that longer routes are usually associated with a route involving a rival's hub airport, and thus competition tends to be strong. In contrast, shorter routes are usually within an airline's sphere of influence and a certain degree of market power could be exercised. The sign of the distance variable is also positive in China Eastern's price-war model, but it is not statistically significant. For collusion models, the distance variable did not have a significant effect. We move now to the concentration measures. For China Eastern, an increase in departure airport HHI, on the one hand, increased the likelihood of price wars (at the 10% significance level). On the other hand, it also increased the likelihood of a successful price agreement (at the 1% significance level). These findings once again are not conflicting. Rather, it is very likely that when there is a price war, price collusion follows in the same market. The market share at the departure airport seems to have no significant impact on the price wars and collusion. Although economic theory suggests that collusion is more likely to occur in concentrated markets, we have not generally found this result in all the models we have estimated. This is consistent with the survey conducted by Levenstein and Suslow (2006) who conclude that there is no simple relationship between industry concentration and the likelihood of collusion. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that firms in China's concentrated airline markets had the ability to alleviate price fluctuations, or to collude with a moderate pricing strategy, and perhaps on other competitive variables such as flight schedules and capacity that cannot be captured by our price-war and collusion models. Finally, any increase in multimarket contact had no significant effect for China Eastern in terms of its engagement in either price wars or collusion. This variable, however, indicates that China Southern was more likely to get involved in a price war at the 5% significance level. This contradicts the traditional mutual forbearance hypothesis, but is consistent with the findings of Morrison and Winston (1996) . They give the explanation that although multimarket contact might facilitate carrier cooperation that reduces the chance of price wars, it can also facilitate the spread of price wars once the cooperation breaks down. This might also be true in China's airline market. As well, owing to the strong rivalry in China's airline markets, explicit price-fixing agreements generally could not be expected to last long, let alone any implicit collusion implied by mutual forbearance. In addition, airline pricing decisions are generally made locally. A successful and stable collusion is largely dependent on the negotiation skills of the local sales managers as noted earlier, and these will reflect each individual's self-interest. Under these circumstances, mutual forbearance or implicit collusion across the board is quite difficult to achieve.
