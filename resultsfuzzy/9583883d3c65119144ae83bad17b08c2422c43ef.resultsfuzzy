Histological changes in degeneration ( Fig. 5.24A , B) vary in degree, but are relatively stereotypic. In the early stages, Sertoli cells develop either a fine basal vacuolation or a more dramatic vacuolation of the apical cytoplasm.There also is disorganization and exfoliation of germ cells. In some cases there may be failure of release of germ cells from Sertoli cells (spermiation) and spermatozoa are phagocytized by Sertoli cells. Early changes in the germ cells include failure of maturation of spermatozoa and degeneration of spermatids; many spermatids are necrotic and others produce characteristic spermatidic multinuclear giant cells. When the degeneration is more advanced, the affected areas are more extensive and degenerative changes appear in the precursors of spermatids. Depending on the insult, there may be cytoplasmic vacuolation and nuclear pyknosis, or apoptotic bodies are seen. Progression of the changes results in loss of germinal cells, and eventually, loss of even the resistant Sertoli cells. Basement membrane thickening is a frequent finding, and as a result of shrinkage and collapse of tubules, it becomes wavy and buckled. The PAS stain clearly accentuates the basement membrane change. In ultrastructural studies of the testes of normal bulls and bulls with atrophy or hypoplasia, mean thicknesses of the actual basal lamina were approximately 0.7, 1.5, and 1.0 txm, respectively. Once-only scrotal heating can cause the appearance of giant cells in degenerate testes and perhaps in the semen. Two types of giant cells, mononuclear giant cells probably derived from pachytene spermatocytes that fail to differentiate further, and multinucleate cells considered to be derived from coalescence of identical spermatids, are observed histologically. Even extremely brief heating, of several minutes only, induces giant cell formation. Such giant cells are seen as early as 6 hours and as late as 7 weeks post-heating, but they seem to be most prevalent at about 1 week. The fate of these cells is unclear. They may disintegrate or pass out of the testis. In addition to giant cell formation, minor increases in testicular temperature in sheep produce a marked accumulation of B-type spermatogonia; histologically this can be demonstrated by the presence of many cells in which mitosis is incomplete. Granulomas can form in degenerate testes (Fig. 5.25A, B) . This and the presence of lymphocytes and plasma cells indicates an immune response to spermatozoa, but complicates the differentiation of simple degeneration from interstitial orchitis. Osseous metaplasia sometimes occurs in tubules affected by spermiostasis for a long time. Mineralization is a common sign of degeneration, and it may involve all or part of one seminiferous tubule, or whole regions ( Fig. 5.26 ). This latter pattern of change is only significant if the testes are to be biopsied, wherein the section may not be representative of the whole. The basic mechanism of degeneration of the cells that make up the germinal epithelium is presumed to be via apoptosis. The testis is very susceptible to the effects of increased scrotal temperature. Both testicular and epididymal function are altered when intrascrotal temperatures increase. In the epididymis, an increase in temperature reduces m R N A expression of a spermatozoal membrane glycoprotein (CD52) in a testosterone-independent manner. An inability to maintain the testes at a temperature lower than normal body temperatures can occur with pyrexia, increased environmental temperatures, scrotal thickening and hair and wool cover, and by the presence of intrascrotal inflammation or scrotal dermatitis.Varicocele is also implicated in the failure to maintain testicular thermoregulation. The progressive degeneration of maldescended testes is believed to be the result of abnormally high testicular temperature. Degeneration of the testes with advancing, age is a recognized phenomenon. The cause is not fully known but it may be secondary to degenerative vascular lesions within the testis. Old bulls and rams have a diffuse increase in intertubular stroma and a decreased proportion of tubular mass. Other changes include increased thickness of tunics and tubular basement membrane, increased proportion of degenerate tubules, and an apparent increased number of interstitial endocrine cells, which contain increased lipofuscin. Gonadotrophins are essential for the normal development and function of the reproductive tract. The pathology of disruptors of endocrine function is a major focus because of the effects of antiandrogenic and estrogenic substances on male reproduction. Substances that reduce androgen concentrations, such as lead and ethanol, adversely affect spermatogenesis and cause degeneration. Sometimes the degeneration is subtle -such as reducing the number of spermatids. Drugs and chemicals (phenobarbital, DDT) that stimulate the hydroxylases that reduce testosterone activity also can create antiandrogenic effects. Some directly acting toxicants are known in domesticated mammals. These may be derived from plants, or from other environmental or therapeutic sources. Biotransformation of such compounds can occur in the testis, as those formed elsewhere may not attain significant concentrations in the testis. The toxicant may affect any one or several of the cell types, including the Leydig cells, Sertoli ceils, spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, spermatozoa, or the epididymal tissues. Interstitial endocrine cell toxicants, as expected, affect testosterone production. Ketoconazole, ethanol, acetaldehyde, and cannabinoids are examples.Their effects include alteration of Sertoli cell function and maturation of germ cells, especially pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids. Direct Sertoli cell toxicants will have detrimental effects on the blood-testis barrier, orientation and translocation of germ cells, hormonal and nutritional support of germ cells, and phagocytosis of residual bodies. The targets for toxicants include the actin filaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules. Cytochalasin disrupts actin filaments, acrylamide disrupts intermediate filaments, and colchicine, vinblastine, and vincristine affect microtubules. Fortunately, many of these drugs, when used at therapeutic doses, have a temporary effect that is reversed when therapy ceases. Effects seen microscopically include vacuolation or swelling and germ cell changes. Failure of spermiation can occur. Toxicants that affect the germ cells are those that are used to prevent rapid mitotic division, and the spermatogonia are the major targets. Adriamycin and cyclophosphamide are examples. Damage by these compounds to the genetic composition of stem cells will also have effects on the later stages of development, up to spermatozoa. Toxicants of the other germ cells are little recognized in domestic species, although in rodents, ethyl glycol alkyl ethers affect spermatocytes, nitroimidazoles affect spermatids, and compounds that impinge on energy metabolism affect spermatozoa. Damage to various stages causes apoptosis, with a rapid uptake of the detritus by Sertoli cells. Within 48 hours, there may no longer be evidence of apoptosis-just the appearance of"maturation arrest." Toxicants can also affect the efferent ductules and epididymis and/or the spermatozoa in transit.The difficulty with investigating efferent ductular toxicosis is separating the effect due to alteration in testosterone concentration, and direct toxic effects. Substances that affect the efferent ductules include cyclophosphamide, methyl chloride, and reserpine. Such toxicants decrease spermatozoal concentration and cause spermiostasis, sperm granuloma formation,  


Section:testicular degeneration may be uni-or bilateral, and it is assumed that unilateral degeneration is the result of a local event, while bilateral degeneration usually is the result of a systemic problem.
