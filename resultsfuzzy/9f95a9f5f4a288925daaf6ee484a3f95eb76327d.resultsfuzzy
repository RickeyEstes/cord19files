Vector construction and E. coli expression The pLD-LH-CTB (Figure 1 (a)) vector integrates the genes of interest into the inverted repeat regions through homologous recombination events between the trnI and trnA chloroplast border sequences of the transformation vector and the corresponding homologous sequences of the chloroplast genome. Unique advantages of integration of foreign genes at this site include accomplishment of homoplasmy in the ®rst round of selection due to the presence of a complete chloroplast origin of replication within the¯anking sequence 31, 32 and doubling the copy number of foreign genes per cell. The chimeric aminoglycoside 3 H adenylyltransferase (aadA) gene, conferring resistance to spectinomycin and streptomycin, and the CTB gene downstream of it are driven by the constitutive promoter of the rRNA operon (Prrn), each with individual ribosome-binding sites (GGAGG), and the foreign transcripts are stabilized by the psbA3 H untranslated region. Since the protein synthetic machinery of chloroplasts is similar to that of E. coli, 33 CTB expression of the pLD-LH-CTB vector was initially tested in E. coli. Western blot analysis of sonicated E. coli cell extracts showed the presence of 11 kDa CTB monomers, similar to commercially available CTB (Figure 2 (a)), when blots were probed with rabbit anti-cholera serum. Oligomeric expression of CTB was not observed in E. coli, as expected, due to the absence of a leader peptide sequence present in the native CTB gene that normally directs the CTB monomer into the periplasmic space allowing for concentration and oligomeric assembly. Inability of E. coli to form dis-ul®de bridges in the cytosol is a major limitation in large-scale production of this antigen.
