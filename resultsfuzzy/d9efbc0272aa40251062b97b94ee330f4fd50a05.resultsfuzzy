This microarray has 108 spots arranged in nine rows (Fig. 3(A) ). 20 samples were assayed with the microarray, yielding the sequence information that was completely confirmed by DNA sequencing (data not shown). A result is shown in Fig. 3(B) . However, cDNA samples obtained from health persons did not produce any signals (data not shown). Referring the design (Fig. 3(A) ), the discriminating oligonucleotides (Table 3 ) and the spotting oligonucleotides (Table 4) , we can get the genotypes from the detection sketch (Fig. 3B ). They are: C (nt9404), T (nt9479), G (nt19838), A (nt21721), C (nt22222) and C (nt27827). It is the characteristic genotypes of the middle phase of the SARS epidemic. If there are two kinds of genotypes, this microarray can also detect them, such as the heterozygous sample. The wild genotypes of six bases are C, C, A, A, C and C. The mutated genotypes are C, C/T, G, A, C and C in middle phase; T, T, A, G, T and T in late phase. The bases (nt9404, nt9479, nt21721, nt22222 and nt27827) are stable after the mutation in the evolution of SARS-CoV. This suggests that the change of these bases may play an important role in the evolution of this virus and the corresponding proteins related to these mutated bases may be more important for viral infection. Besides the identification of the SARS-CoV, this universal microarray can provide the related genotypes in the different phases of epidemic. These relative genotypes comprised of six bases can help the epidemiologists to know that the detection samples belong to which phase of the epidemic. The aim is to develop an efficient and economical microarray system to detect the SARS-CoV and identify the genotypes of the six mutated bases. We designed the spotting control and the hybridization control. The spotting control was used to optimize the conditions of the immobility of the spotting samples. The hybridization control is useful to find out the range of the better hybridization conditions with less time. In order to confirm the SARS-CoV samples, PCRs were applied with 16-pair SARS-specific primers. SARS-CoVspecific primers, HotStar DNA polymerase and touch-down PCRs were used in the amplification of the samples, which can guarantee the fidelity of the SARS-CoV cDNA amplification. There were still the PCR products with the "mutant" due to the generation of the single base "mutant" during PCRs. LDR reaction with strict matched in the hybridization zone can almostly eliminate the influence of the "mutant". The reasons may be the following facts. If not the detection base, the "mutant" becomes noneffective after LDR reaction. At the time, the amount of the SARS-CoV templates was far more than the amount of the templates with the "mutant", which was the main reason to eliminate the influence of the PCR "mutant". As result of these, this microarray system can decrease the influence of the PCR "mutants" significantly. This microarray is the ideal tool for the detection of the virus with high-mutation rate, such as SARS-CoV. This method can also be applied to the study of other point mutation viruses.
