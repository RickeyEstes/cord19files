(a) Space filling model of B41 CD4/17b illustrating a newly created pocket that is now occupied by the fusion peptide. A close-up view of the pocket (center) and space-filling model (right). (b) K574 of gp41, which forms a salt bridge with D107 of gp120 in the prefusion state, now interacts with F53 of gp120. (c) The tryptophan clasp, previously described as a stabilizing feature of the pre-fusion state 14 , is retained in the CD4-bound state. (d) Intraprotomer stabilizing interactions of helix α0 and β3-β4. (e) Two aromatic residues of the fusion peptide rearrange upon CD4-binding and fit in two pockets. Sequence alignment of the fusion peptides of BG505 (pre-fusion) and B41 (CD4-bound) with the aromatic residues highlighted. All pre-fusion model coordinates are based on PDB: 5CEZ.
