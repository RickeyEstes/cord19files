Blood buffy-coat cells from both cases of SRC produced amplified 529-bp bands characteristic of E. risticii (Figure 1 ). Southern hybridization and DNA sequencing revealed that the 529-bp bands were indeed 16S rRNA gene fragments from an E. risticii strain. Sequencing of the majority of the 16S rRNA gene (1422 bp) indicated that the SRC agent from the Mt. Shasta horse was most closely related to the Kentucky strain ofE. risticii, with which only 3 nucleotide differences were noted (  Periods indicate conserved positions relative to E. risticii-Illinois, the type strain.
