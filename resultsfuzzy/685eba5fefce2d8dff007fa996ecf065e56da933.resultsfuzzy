QTiPs of Virus-Induced CD11b + , Ly6G − , Ly6C high Myeloid Cells Exposure to pathogens, especially viruses, drives the recruitment of CD11b + , Ly6G − , Ly6C high myeloid cells that undergo functional transition at the site of infection. To directly visualize this transition of newly recruited, virus-induced myeloid cells in situ, we performed 10-plex quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) on temporally collected, cell-sorted, reovirus-driven myeloid cells. Reovirus induces the accumulation of otherwise absent CD11b + , Ly6G − , Ly6C high cells at the site of infection as early as 1 d.p.i., which subsequently exhibited a gradual loss of Ly6C expression over time (hence the reference to these cells as CD11b + , Ly6G − , Ly6C high-low ; Figure 1A and Figure S-1A-B). These CD11b + , Ly6G − , Ly6C high-low cells were sorted from the site of infection (SOI, inflammatory) and the BM (resident) from 10 C57BL/6 mice per collection point. QTiPs analysis identified 6634 proteins and quantified 5019 proteins from the in vivo harvested and cell-sorted myeloid cell population spanning the course of 10 days in both the SOI and BM ( Figure 1B , Data S-1). Comparing 10 to 1 d.p.i., SOI-isolated cells contained more proteomic changes (>-or <2-fold) than in the BM myeloid cells (12.69 vs 5.46%, respectively) ( Figure 1C ). Because the QTiPs data set provides rich temporal proteomic data, it can be interrogated further to reveal temporally distinct virus-driven myeloid cell changes over the course of acute infection. Because of the limited knowledge of the overall proteomic signature of CD11b + , Ly6G − , Ly6C high-low cells, we first conducted
