To compare the quantity and quality of research papers from the 3 regions, we applied the following measures. First, the numbers of papers from the 3 regions during the 10-year period were counted and analyzed for international cooperation status. Second, the average impact factor (IF) was generated according to the Journal Citation Report (JCR) 2009 established by the ISI [10] . Third, total times cited and times cited per paper based on the literature searching date (February 27, 2010) were calculated for each of the 3 regions. In addition, papers published in the top10 highest impact factor public health journals were generated; the top10 public health journals in which authors published most often among the 3 regions were determined according to the numbers of published papers. Both data searching and paper selection processes were performed independently by 2 authors (Zheng ML and Yang LL). Discrepencies were resolved by consensus.
