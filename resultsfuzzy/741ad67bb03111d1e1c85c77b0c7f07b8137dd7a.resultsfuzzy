3.1. Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry ML-7, and a related compound ML-9, used as internal standard, could be easily separated on an ACQUITY UPLC TM BEH C 18 reversedphase column (1.7 m, 50 mm × 2.1 mm I.D.), using 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile as the mobile phase, which is probably the most commonly used solvent system for LC-MS analysis. The only difference in the chemical structure of the components, an I-atom for ML-7 and a Cl-atom for ML-9 in the naphthalene part (see Fig. 1) , gives however such a difference in polarity and in molecular mass (91.45 Da), making their isocratic separation not really a challenge. ML-9 is then the earlier eluting component with a retention time of 2.19 min, under the chromatographic conditions as described in Section 2.3, while ML-7 elutes about 1 min later at 3.28 min (see Fig. 2 for a chromatogram of a standard solution) . Fig. 1 shows besides the chemical structures of both ML-7 and ML-9, also the mass spectra obtained after direct infusion of a standard solution of 5 g ml −1 of ML-7 and ML-9 in the ESI source, in combination with the LC mobile phase using a T-union. The best Fig. 2 . MS/MS mass chromatograms of a standard solution of ML-7 and ML-9 (equivalent of 10 ng ml −1 sample), a blank plasma spiked with ML-7 and ML-9 (equivalent of 10 ng ml −1 sample) after extraction, a blank plasma spiked at 10 ng ml −1 of ML-7, a blank plasma sample spiked at 1 ng ml −1 of ML-7 (=LOQ), a blank plasma sample, and an incurred plasma sample (ML-7 concentration measured = 299.1 ng ml −1 , of a cat treated intravenously with 4 mg/kg BW, 2 h after administration). All chromatograms of spiked samples shown concern blank 1. ML-9 concentration in all plasma samples is 100 ng ml −1 . For each chromatogram, the upper trace represents ML-9, the lower trace is signal was obtained in the positive ion mode, probably because the components incorporate e.g. 2 N-atoms that can be easily protonated. In MS, a major ion at m/z 417.07 and 325.29 was observed for ML-7 and ML-9 respectively, corresponding to the protonated molecules [M+H] + of both components (molecular mass of respectively 416.28 and 324.83 as base). For ML-9, clearly also an ion lower in intensity at m/z 327.30 was observed due to the 37 Clisotope. The CID product ion spectra of both components show a predominant ion at m/z 98.97, which was therefore used in the MRM transition for quantification. According to the Mass Frontier 6.0 software (HighChem, Ltd., Bratislava, Slovakia) this corresponds to the 1,4-diazepine moiety of the components, after protonation and charge site rearrangement (rHc (␥)). This software has a module "Fragments and Mechanisms" which is an expert system providing information about basic fragmentation and rearrangement processes based on literature, starting from a user-supplied chemical structure. A major product ion with higher m/z was also observed, at m/z 253.10 and 160.93 for ML-7 and ML-9 respectively, according to Mass Frontier corresponding to the iodonaphthalene and chloronaphthalene moieties of the components, after protonation and inductive cleavage (i). Also several common fragments at lower m/z were present in the product ion spectra: m/z 43.94, 55.88, 57.03, 58.10, 68.01, 68.96, 69.98, 82.03 and 85.02. These correspond all -according to Mass Frontier -to smaller fragments of the 1,4-diazepine moiety of the components, as the result of more complex fragmentation mechanisms. The predominant fragment ions could be confirmed with reasonable certainty by infusion of a 10 g ml −1 solution of ML-7 and ML-9 in the hESI source of an Exactive ® orbitrap mass spectrometer. This instrument allows high mass accuracy measurements of the fragment ions, which can then be related to the theoretical masses of the fragments generated by the Mass Frontier software. Mass errors (= m/m × 10 6 , with m the mass difference between the measured mass and the theoretical mass, and m the theoretical mass) of 0.50, 0.87 and 2.25 ppm were obtained for the fragment ions at m/z 98.97, 160.93 and 253.10 respectively, of ML-7 and ML-9. These low mass errors confirm the fragmentation mechanism proposed by the Mass Frontier software (see above).
