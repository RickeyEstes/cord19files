Hypoxia is the end result of decreased oxygen concentration at any point in its passage from air into the respiratory tract through hemoglobin uptake and transport by the vasculature to cells, where it drives mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Ischemia is a local decrease in blood supply to tissue with resultant decreased delivery of oxygen (hypoxia), glucose, and other nutrients to the cell, as well as decreased removal of metabolic wastes. Because any injury to the respiratory or cardiovascular system can lead to hypoxia, it is commonly the ultimate cause of acute cell swelling. When cellular oxygen is depleted, oxidative phosphorylation stops, and the cell must switch to anaerobic metabolism (i.e., glycolysis) or die. As production of ATP declines, the resultant drop stimulates hexokinases, phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1), and other enzymes of glycolysis. PFK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, another integral step in glycolysis. The end products of glycolysis are ATP and pyruvate and heat. This anaerobic generation of ATP (though less efficient than oxidative phosphorylation) contributes to short-term survival of the cell. In addition, pyruvate produced by glycolysis can enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. However, certain specialized cells (e.g., neurons) cannot generate ATP anaerobically and therefore need a continuous supply of oxygen and glucose. This dependency makes neurons one of the cells that are most susceptible to a deficiency or lack of oxygen. The early events in acute cell swelling (see Figs. 1-7 and 1-9) caused by hypoxia or ischemia are potentially reversible if the injury is mild or of short duration. With the depletion of cellular oxygen, oxidative phosphorylation stops. The resultant deficiency of ATP causes failure of the Na + /K + -ATPase pumps with influx of Na + , Ca 2+ , and water into the cytosol, and loss of K + and Mg 2+ from the cytosol. The electrolyte imbalance and influx of water expand the cytosol and swell mitochondria and the cytocavitary network. Ultrastructurally, chromatin is clumped, the cytosol is electron lucent, ribosomes detach from rER, and the ER becomes vesiculated. Damaged membranes coil into whorls (also known as "myelin figures"). Cytoskeletal damage causes the plasma membrane to lose microvilli or other specialized structures and to undergo blebbing (the formation of multiple irregular bulges). With light microscopy the acutely swollen cell has an expanded and rounded profile with pale eosinophilic or vacuolated cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic pallor and vacuolation is the result of dispersion of organelles and dilution of cytosolic proteins by the influx of water. The ATP deficiency also prompts a switch to anaerobic metabolism with production of ATP (and pyruvate) through glycolysis. Glycolysis depletes cellular glycogen, leads to an accumulation of lactate with decreased intracellular pH, and produces heat, which if excessive may also injure the cell.
