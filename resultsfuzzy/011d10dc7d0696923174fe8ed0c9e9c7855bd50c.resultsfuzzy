The frequency with which a primary tuberculous infection is overcome, usually without the patient being aware of its presence, roused interest in the possibility that in tuberculosis, as in many other infectious diseases, recovery from an attack might leave a heightened resistance to infection in the event of subsequent exposure to the same organism. Further, as some degree of immunity generally results from a natural infection, the question was raised whether similar protection could be conferred by some controllable prophylactic procedure. An affirmative answer has been given to both these questions. The first study that disclosed convincingly that a primary infection conferred some protection was made by Heimbeck in Oslo. His conclusions were based on studying follow-up records of positive and negative tuberculin reactors among probationer nurses entering the municipal hospital in that city. Through a comparative study of the findings on enrolment and the subsequent medical history while nursing, it became apparent that, although all were equally exposed to the same general hospital environment and its hazards, the incidence of overt tuberculosis was significantly less in those girls who were positive reactors at the time of their entry. Heimbeck's conclusions have since been scrutinised and confirmed in many studies elsewhere. The most extensive of these -the Prophit
