This mechanism involves both lymphocyte and macrophage accumulation at sites of virus replication, together with local secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by these cells. Of course, cell-mediated immune responses are also an important contributor to recovery from viral infections (see Chapter 6: Adaptive Immune Responses to Infection), as becomes evident if they are abrogated by cytotoxic drugs, or are absent as is the case with some immunodeficiency diseases. The classic model of death due to a cell-mediated immune response is lymphocytic choriomeningitis in adult mice inoculated intracerebrally. The virus replicates harmlessly in the meninges, ependyma, and choroid plexus epithelium for about a week until a CTL-mediated immune response develops, causing severe meningitis, choroiditis and ependymitis, and cerebral edema, convulsions and death. Experiments with knockout mice, and with chemical immunosuppression and adoptive transfer of T cells, have clearly confirmed that CTLs are necessary for the development of disease. Normally CTLs help to control infection, but within the rigid confines of the skull this response is fatal. A lethal pneumonia develops when some inbred strains of mice are infected with certain strains of influenza virus by the intranasal route. Adoptive transfer of influenza virusprimed CD8+ cytotoxic T cells protect mice against intranasal challenge, but CD4+ Th1 cells actually accelerate their demise. Coxsackie B virus infection of mice is manifested as myocarditis, but in transgenic mice lacking the perforin gene, the disease takes a mild course, indicating that both intrinsic virus-induced damage and cytotoxic lymphocytes contribute to the pathology. Hepatitis B is a clear example of liver damage as a result of specific immune responses to viral proteins. Transgenic mice expressing hepatitis B envelope proteins show little liver damage unless injected with hepatitis B-specific CTLs; this causes hepatocyte damage and inflammatory cell infiltration, characteristic of acute viral hepatitis. In humans, the degree of liver damage is governed by the strength of the immune response. Patients with marked immunosuppression can express high levels of virus in the absence of significant liver damage: patients with a strong immune response clear the virus, but those with an intermediate response show continuing liver damage and viral persistence. Any restoration of immune competence can induce pathology; for example, in HBV/HIV co-infected patients there is partial recovery of immune competence with a risk of "flares" of liver damage, after patients are treated with anti-retroviral drugs. The maculopapular rash of measles involves virus infection of endothelial cells in the superficial layers of the dermis, spread of infection to overlying epithelial cells, vascular dilatation, and infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and macrophages into sites of replication. Individuals with deficiencies in cellular immunity may develop measles without a rash, but the disease in such patients is especially severe.
