3.1. iROAD assay for viral RNA detection Fig. 1 illustrates the iROAD assay that was designed for the clinical detection of viral RNAs, which were extracted from the nasopharyngeal swab samples with either Influenza (IFN)-A/B or human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43/229E or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-A/B, by the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit. Following the extraction of viral RNA, the target region was amplified by an isothermal-based asymmetric RNA amplification method through recombinase polymerase amplificationreverse transcription (RPA-RT) reagents. For the reaction of iROAD assay, one primer was grafted covalently to an optical sensor surface and the other was in solution, while the temperature was kept constant at 43°C. The amplified viral RNA targets were simultaneously detected with the grafted primer on the sensor surface in a label-free and realtime manner (Fig. 1) . First, selection of primer pairs used for amplification and detection in both solid-and solution-phases was critical for the specific amplification of viral RNA. The primer pair sequences from each viral infection were complementary to the target sequences (Table S1 ). In order to avoid the formation of primerdimers, one primer was immobilized and possessed a 5′-amine group as an asymmetric assay on the silicon microring resonators (SMR), which could be used as unique refractive index sensitive sensors that allow target molecules to selectively bind to the immobilized receptors in the evanescent field of the resonator waveguide, subsequently causing an increase in the proportion of each wavelength during the reaction. Second, during the amplification process, complementary DNA (cDNA) was obtained from the viral RNA template after reverse transcription (RT) reaction. As a result, the cDNA was hybridized with the immobilized primer on the amine-modified SMR surface, and then the target amplification commenced from the RPA-RT mixture. This resulted in binding of the recombinase-primer complex to doublestranded cDNA by components of the proteins (namely gp32, uvsX, and uvsY) to facilitate strand exchange, leading to strand elongation and an exponential increase in the number of target cDNA copies. This assay was placed on an in-house thermal pad with an optical instrument to enable the simultaneous amplification and detection of viral RNA. Finally, the exponentially amplified targets by repetition of the reaction on the sensor surface are monitored by the wavelength shift of the microring resonator without any labeling and in a real-time manner. Subsequently, the iROAD assay detected the respiratory viral targets from the clinical sample by measuring the resonance wavelength shift within 15-20 min (Fig. 1) .
