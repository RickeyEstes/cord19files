Any overall policy to ensure clean surfaces should include monitoring surface cleanliness. When and where to monitor (Table 44 .11) needs to be considered in relation to surface type, risk, and the potential for cross-contamination, the type of information required and the reasons for sampling. Firms should construct an appropriate environmental sampling plan, this should specify the approaches, methods, numbers, and types of sample for each location and a results communication strategy. This helps to provide a consistent approach to routine sampling but should also give flexibility and allow for investigative or nonroutine sampling based on observations of poor cleaning practices/results, product problems, or the need to adopt a "seek and destroy" approach (Butts, 2003; Malley et al., 2015) . It is important that the results of any testing are communicated to the correct people. Poor/noncommunication of results was partly responsible for at least one major outbreak of listeriosis, where positive L. monocytogenes isolations were not reported to senior management (Weatherill, 2009 ). It is unfortunate that in some companies, sampling concentrates on the center of large flat surfaces. Easier-to-sample surfaces are usually easier to clean and so are clean, hard-to-sample surfaces are often more difficult to clean and may be less well cleaned or overlooked. Less attention may be given to hand-contact surfaces or cracks and crevices where soil and later microorganisms can accumulate. Hand-contact surfaces in particular are known to be often heavily contaminated and frequently touched prior to handling RTE foods (Clayton and Griffith, 2004; Griffith, 2013) . Rinses, especially in CIP, in liquid-processing plants can be tested to provide an indirect estimate of surface cleanliness, as can the quality of the first product run after, for example, a weekend shut-down. One approach is to designate surfaces as food contact, general environmental, hand contact, and cleaning (equipment/ cloths). The latter need care and attention and can act as vectors causing the zig-zag spread of pathogens within an environment (Harrison et al., 2003) . Another approach uses a "criticality index" of six levels (Microgen, 2015) , whereby the frequency of monitoring is assigned to an area depending on how critical it is, for example, final product area subjected to greater testing than a raw material area. Or areas subjected to warmer wetter conditions would constitute a higher risk than colder dryer areas. This type of approach would need careful thought if testing for Listeria or Listeria monocytogenes. For high hygiene areas, particularly for the manufacture of RTE foods, and for which final product sampling for pathogens is frequent, a three-stage sampling program is proposed. Barriers to the high hygiene area (eg, personnel entry areas, product decontamination entry tunnels, packaging entrances) are sampled for pathogens during production. If pathogens are found, the control of the barriers is checked. As an indication of whether pathogens are present during manufacturing periods, pathogen "collector points" (eg, cleaning equipment, drains, footwear, vehicle wheels) are sampled during production. If these are negative, there is some confidence that the production area is free of pathogens. If positive, extended sampling can then be undertaken to elucidate the pathogen source. Finally, cleaned equipment is sampled for pathogens to verify cleaning and disinfectant performance. A third option (ICMSF, 2002) , a variation of the high risk/low risk which has been developed in the United States where final product testing for pathogens may be less frequent, is to arrange areas into zones or shells (Fig. 44.9 ). This essentially establishes successively "cleaner zones" and/or zones of increased sampling frequency and decreasing levels of contamination. Zone 1 represents the most critical areas of cleaning-mainly surfaces in contact with RTE products, for example, conveyor belts and cutters. Filling and depositing heads, spray drying, or cream depositers can be particularly difficult to clean effectively. Zone 2 could include hand-contact areas in close proximity to zone 1 and may even include the surfaces used/touched during hand-washing . Zone 2 would also include environmental areas in close proximity to Zone 1.
