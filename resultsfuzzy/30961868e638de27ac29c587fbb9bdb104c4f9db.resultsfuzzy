In this section we address the important aspects of practical implementation of RIRGN algorithm (3.4). To that end, we investigate the trajectories of the 2014e2015 Ebola epidemic in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (World Health Organization, 2016) . For illustration, we use early incident reported data to estimate the values of five unknown parameters, r, t, p, a, and K, by solving the regularized least squares problem with the RIRGN method (3.4). Then we substitute the estimated parameters into (1.1) to find the approximate values of future incident cases using the built-in Matlab ode23s solver. The data for this numerical experiment have been retrieved in 2015 from the World Health Organization (WHO) web site. The weekly series of cases were directly obtained from the WHO patient database. For successful application of any regularized procedure, the right choice of the stabilizing sequence, fã k g, is very important. The value ofã 0 has to be sufficiently large to ensure that we incorporate enough stability into the system to reduce the excessive noise propagation. On the other hand, over-regularization may slow down the convergence of the iterative sequence fq k g, and result in unnecessary loss of precision. In our experiment, we takeã 0 ¼ 5,10 À4 for Sierra Leone and Fig. 3 . Sierra Leone: Estimation of r, t, p, a, and K, and Forecasting. r ¼ 0.52 (95% CI: 0.31, 0.71), t ¼ 27 (95% CI: 25, 29), p ¼ 0.86 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.91), a ¼ 1.03 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.04), K ¼ 1.7 ,10 4 (95% CI: 1.5 ,10 4 , 1.8 ,10 4 ). Liberia andã 0 ¼ 10 À3 for Guinea, where the data are more noise contaminated. We setã k ¼ã 0 expðÀk=2Þ, since this choice gives us the most aggressive convergence rate for fq k g while maintaining stability for every value of k. The outer step of the RIRGN scheme (3.4) identifies the direction of the decent. In order to optimize the step size in that direction, we implement a version of the Armijo-Goldstein line search strategy (Nocedal & Wright, 2000) , i.e., a backtracking which is commonly used for Gauss-Newton type algorithms. Iterations are stopped at the moment when the discrepancy for the approximate solution is consistent with the level of noise in our data in order to guarantee convergence and, at the same time, it is not too small to prevent over-fitting that may compromise the accuracy of the estimated parameters, i.e., the stopping index, K ¼ K ðdÞ, is evaluated by a posteriori stopping rule A q K ðdÞ À D=K q K ðdÞ 2 rkd < Aðq k Þ À D=Kðq k Þ 2 ; 0 k K ðdÞ; r > 1: (4.1) To balance the sensitivity of the cost functional to all four unknowns in the penalty term, we choose L based on our prior knowledge of the difference in the orders of magnitude between the value of t and the values of three other parameters. This suggests L in the form (2.6) with u > 1 (u ¼ 10 works well for our code). The selection of the initial vector, q 0 , and the reference vector,q, in the penalty term is rather difficult. In the beginning of an emerging outbreak, it is not straightforward to make a sophisticated guess about when the disease is going to peak. Hence, in our experiment, we take t 0 in q 0 to be slightly greater than t m , the last week for which the data is available, and we take t in Fig. 4 . Guinea: Estimation of r, t, p, a, and K, and Forecasting. r ¼ 1.3 (95% CI: 0.03, 2.7), t ¼ 41 (95% CI: 33, 49), p ¼ 0.87 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.9), a ¼ 0.96 (95% CI: 0.95, 1), K ¼ 1.1 ,10 4 (95% CI: 1 ,10 3 , 5.9 ,10 4 ). q to be equal to 60, i.e., we assume the incidence curve will turn before 60 weeks of the epidemic have passed. The values of p in q 0 andq are taken to be 0.7 and 0.1, respectively, to enforce the sub-exponential growth rate. The values of two remaining parameters, b (used to compute r) and a are taken to be 1 in both vectors for the lack of better information. Fig. 3 illustrates parameter estimation and the epidemic forecasts based on the generalized Richards model with 20 weeks of incident case data for the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone. After the five unknown parameters have been recovered from early epidemic data, 100 additional data bootstrap curves are generated by adding a Poisson error structure to the weekly series of reported cases (see (Chowell, Ammon, Hengartner, & Hyman, 2006) ) in order to quantify uncertainty in the recovered parameters. An alternative is to employ analytic results from asymptotic theory to estimate parameter uncertainty (Banks, Davidian, Samuels, & Sutton, 2009) . The histograms in the upper row show the recovered values of the parameters, while the collection of curves at the bottom of the figure demonstrates the accuracy of the forecasting. In a similar manner, we estimated parameters and produced forecasts for the Ebola epidemics in Guinea (Fig. 4) and Liberia (Fig. 5) . Not surprisingly the model has most difficulties tracking the epidemic in Guinea due to its multi-mode nature (Fig. 4) . Since this outbreak is also the longest, we need more data (30 weeks) to forecast future incidence cases. On the other hand, the Liberia outbreak, which is 45 weeks total, can be projected from as little as 12 weeks of early data. This inverse modeling approach could be adapted to analyze outbreaks of other disease system, e.g., avian influenza, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Zika. One could envision disease forecasts for an emerging outbreak in real time with updates every few weeks or so (depending on the disease system). In conclusion, we have illustrated the potential of rigorous mathematical approaches for generating reliable parameter estimates and useful epidemic forecasts in the context of the generalized Richards equation, a simple phenomenological 4parameter model. Our results here suggest that carefully linking mathematical models with regularization techniques could lead to stable parameter estimation and associated forward projections. Fig. 5 .
