Results were analysed and quantification performed using standard curves produced by Opticon Monitor software v. 3.1 (Bio-Rad). The absolute copy number of the gene of interest was normalised to cDNA concentration. Cytokine mRNA copies (ng cDNA Ã€1 ) were presented as the logarithm of the fold change relative to controlinoculated cultures, from the same dog, at the same time post-inoculation. This method of analysis was adopted to minimise any differences in cytokine mRNA levels due to maintenance of the tracheas in vitro and natural variation in baseline levels and responses between different animals. Cytokine mRNA levels were also calculated relative to the CRCoV copy number at a given time point post-inoculation. Statistical analysis of the results of canine cytokine mRNA levels was performed using SPSS v. 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). The relationship between control-and CRCoV-or LPSinoculated canine tracheal cultures at a given time was assessed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc comparisons made using the Bonferroni method. 2.6. Latex bead clearance assay 10 mL of a suspension of 1 mm diameter latex beads (Polybead polystyrene microsphere beads; Polysciences Europe, Eppelheim, Germany) was pipetted onto the surface of tracheal cultures daily. The beads covered the whole mucosa and following incubation for 30 min each tracheal culture was scored blind by visual inspection according to a scale of 0-5. Zero was defined as no clearance and five was complete clearance of the whole suspension to one edge of the tracheal piece. Statistical analysis of the results of latex clearance was performed using SPSS v. 16.0. The relationship between control-and CRCoV-or LPS-inoculated canine tracheal cultures was assessed using 3-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) and post hoc comparisons made using the Bonferroni method.
