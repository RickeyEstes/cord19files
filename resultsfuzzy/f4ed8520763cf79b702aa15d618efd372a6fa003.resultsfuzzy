The 3-indolylation of isatin, which was found very sluggish in nature is essentially a Friedel-Crafts reaction. This recognition implies that the reaction could be assisted by enhancing the nucleophilic character of indoles in basic media, or by activating the carbonyl group of isatin with the aid of acidic species. In this view, we envisaged that the acid-base guanidinium ionic liquids could be suitable choices for performing the dual role. Our initial trials on the model reaction between indole and isatin in TMGT f was very encouraging as it proceeds smoothly at room temperature and stops at the stage of monoindolylation of isatin to afford 3-(indol-3yl)-3-hydroxyindolin-2-one 3a in fairly high yield. We have also performed the model reaction in either of the neutral ionic liquids, [BMIM]Cl and [BMIM]BF 4 or in the absence of ionic liquids to respond the issue if the high polarity of TMGT f is responsible for catalysis of the reaction. Of note, the model reaction has not proceeded in either of the above imidazolium ionic liquids or absence of them, confirming the functional role of TMGT f in catalysis of the reaction. To learn more about this function and on expectation that Li þ could play the same role as H þ in TMGT f we intended to test our model reaction in [BMIM]BF 4 doped with LiCl. As expected, the LiCl contained in [BMIM]BF 4 efficiently catalyzed the addition of indole onto isatin to provide 3-(indol-3-yl)-3-hydroxyindolin-2-one 3a in a few minutes (Table 1) . Several indoles and isatin derivatives, having electron donor and electron withdrawing substituents, likewise underwent the same reaction efficiently in both ionic liquids, TMGT f and [BMIM]BF 4 -LiCl. The results are summarized in Table 2 . All the compounds 3a-f are formed solely under these conditions and were not contaminated with the production of 3,3-di(indol-3-yl)indolin-2-ones 4 even when 3 equiv of indoles were employed in the reactions. Delighted by this result, we intended to examine the effect of another guanidinium ionic liquid. For this purpose the reaction involving a 1:1 mmol ratio of isatin and indole was similarly carried out in N,N,N,N-tetramethylguanidinium trifluoroacetate (TMGT), in place of TMGT f , at room temperature. Monitoring of this reaction by TLC revealed a rather slow disappearance of the reactants, compared to the reaction in TMGT f or [BMIM]BF 4 -LiCl, and still signifying an efficient conversion giving both 3-(indol-3-yl)-3hydroxyindolin-2-one 3a and 3,3-di(indol-3-yl)indolin-2-one 4a in about an hour. Formation of 3,3-di(indol-3-yl)indolin-2-one 4a as a by-product obviously accounts for the capability of TMGT to catalyze the Friedel-Crafts reaction between 3-(indol-3-yl)-3hydroxyindolin-2-one 3a and another indole molecule, meanwhile showing a need for optimization of conditions to gain better yield of 4a. In order to optimize the reaction conditions, we performed the model reaction using different quantities of reactants and the ionic liquid. The best results were obtained with 1:2 mmol ratios of isatin and indoles in the presence of 1 mL of TMGT at room temperature. Therefore, we set out a method comprising the room temperature reaction of a 2:1 mixture of indole 1 and isatin 2 without using any solvent or additional catalyst in TMGT and thereby 3,3-di(indol-3-yl)indolin-2-ones 4a-f were obtained in fairly high yields (Table 3) . Here again both electron donor as well as electron withdrawing substituents exert no considerable effects on reactivity of reactants under catalysis of TMGT. The condensation of indoles with isatin derivatives is better rationalized by an initial nucleophilic addition of the indole onto the ketonic carbonyl group of isatin to yield the corresponding 3-(indol-3-yl)-3-hydroxyindolin-2-one 3. Dehydration of this adduct gives the intermediate 6, which subsequently undergoes nucleophilic addition of the second indole molecule to provide the final products 3,3-di(indol-3-yl)indolin-2-ones 4 (Scheme 1). In the next phase of this investigation we planned to take advantage of the difference between catalytic activities of TMGT and TMGT f for the synthesis of unsymmetrical 3,3-di(indol-3-yl)indolin-2-ones in a more controlled manner. In this protocol the initially synthesized 3-(indol-3-yl)-3-hydroxyindolin-2-ones 3, on reaction of an isatin derivatve with an indole in TMGT f or [BMIM]BF 4 -LiCl ionic liquids, was treated with 1 equiv of another indole derivate in TMGT to give the desired unsymmetrical 3,3-di(indol-3-yl)indolin-2-one 5. The results of the application of this procedure are summarized in Table 4 . Table 3 Synthesis of symmetrical 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones from indoles and isatin derivatives in TMGT Scheme 1.
