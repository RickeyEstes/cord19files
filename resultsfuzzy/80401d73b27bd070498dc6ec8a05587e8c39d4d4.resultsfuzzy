3.1. Simple and label-free pathogen enrichment via homobifunctional imidoesters using a microfluidic (SLIM) system for ultrasensitive pathogen detection The principle of the SLIM system for ultrasensitive pathogen detection in large clinical specimen volumes (1-2 mL) via pathogen enrichment and the use of a single microfluidic chip are illustrated in Fig. 1 . The source of the pathogen, such as an environmental swab, saliva, or plasma, needs to be mixed with HI reagents which are used as non-chaotropic reagents to enrich and extract these organisms onto the assembled double chips (ADC). HI consists of several methylene groups and bifunctional imidoester groups (Fig. 1A , left) that combine with the ADC platform consisting of 5 layers, including 3 thin films (top, middle and bottom) and 2 double-side tapes with 36 microwells ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ) for streamlining of the processing. The microwells including channels and chambers were used as binding reservoirs for rapid mixing with high flow rate of sample volume during the sample loading, washing and elution (Yoon et al., 2018) . The simple and low-cost ADC platform can be readily fabricated as a rapid prototype device using a CO 2 laser cutting machine. First of all, to enrich and concentrate the pathogens from a large volume samples via the SLIM system, a pre-mixed solution of sample and HI is introduced onto the ADC platform which has been pre-activated with amine reactive groups on its surface to electrostatically capture complexes of pathogens and HI reagents. The positively charged HI reagents by the amino group of HI capture the negatively charged pathogens by electrostatic adsorption (Fig. 1A, middle) . As the suspension flows through the platform, pathogen capture occurs on the inner surface while other substances flow through (Fig. 1A, middle) . Second, after the enrichment process at room temperature to selectively capture pathogens, a lysis buffer with additional HIs is added to isolate nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) from the captured pathogens by covalent bonding on the same platform at 56°C for 20 min. Elution buffer is added to collect the nucleic acids by breaking the interaction between the complex and the inner surface of the platform. The SLIM system can thus capture and extract nucleic acids from pathogens from 1 or 2 mL Ultrasensitive pathogen detection system combining a simple and label-free system via homobifunctional imidoesters (HIs) with a microfluidic (SLIM) platform and an isothermal solid-phase nucleic acid amplification and detection sensor (iNAD). A mixture clinical sample and HI reagent is added to the SLIM system to enrich the pathogen and extract the DNA/RNA within 50 min without the need for detergents or bulky instruments. The extracted nucleic acids using the SLIM system were then used to detect a pathogen via an iNAD sensor.

Finally, a rapid and sensitive detection of the pathogenic organisms is made using the isothermal solid phase nucleic acid amplification and detection (iNAD) optical sensor (Fig. 1A, right) . A single primer is covalently immobilized on the sensor surface to which a mixture of the other primer, the target nucleic acids, and recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is added. The target nucleic acid sequences are exponentially amplified on the sensor surface at 38°C for 30 min, which is monitored in real-time using the wavelength shift on the optical sensor without the need for labeling. Using the SLIM system, pathogens in a large samples can be rapidly and sensitively detected within 80 min via enrichment and extraction compared with conventional assays (several hours) such as ultra-centrifugation for enrichment and extraction, and detection with PCR (Fig. 1B) . The clear advantages of the SLIM system are effective and direct pathogen enrichment from large clinical samples with HI reagents followed by a streamlined processing of large volumes with double microfluidic chips with no loss of the pathogens. In general, a large sample volume will increase the time, cost and effort involved in testing it. However, the SLIM system significantly decreases the time, cost, and complex instrument requirements and with a high sensitivity and specificity for pathogen diagnosis in clinical specimens.
