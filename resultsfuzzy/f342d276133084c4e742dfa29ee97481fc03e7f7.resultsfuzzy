Since previous papers describing the disulfide bonding of The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 144, 1999 270 vv proteins omitted to use an alkylating reagent before cell lysis and virus isolation, it could not be excluded that the observed disulfide bonds were due to an artifactual postlysis oxidation of the proteins. Throughout this study we therefore used the alkylating reagent NEM before cell lysis. Disulfide bonding was analyzed under three different conditions of infection. First, IMV was isolated and purified using our standard protocols, except that the infected cells were treated with NEM (or iodoacetamide; data not shown) before lysis, in order to assess the disulfide bonding as it occurred in the (isolated) IMV. Second, cells were infected in the presence of rifampicin, a drug that reversibly blocks the IMV formation at an early assembly stage but does not interfere with the synthesis of late proteins (40); this allowed us to assess whether or not the disulfide bonding depended on IMV assembly. Finally, cell lysates were also prepared from infected cells that were not treated with rifampicin to study the vv proteins in the infected cells at all stages of assembly. The membrane proteins p21, p16, and p32 (see Fig. 1 and Table I ) appeared to form disulfide-bonded dimers under all three conditions, since they occurred in monomer and dimer forms under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2  a) . The amount of dimer formation was somewhat variable; in the case of p21 and p16 ‫ف‬ 50% of the protein dimerized (see also below) while of p32 no more than 30% of the protein was in the dimer form. As noted before (48, 49, 55) , the dimers of both p16 and p21 migrated at molecular masses that were smaller than the sum of two monomers. We presume that this is a consequence of a folded conformation of the dimer and not due to heterodimerization. By two-dimensional (2-D) gel analysis we have shown before that the dimers of p21 and p16 run at the same pI as their respective monomers (26). Since heterodimer formation would result in a shift of the pI relative to the monomeric protein, these 2-D gel data show that both proteins form homodimers. In contrast to these three proteins, the migration of p35 was not altered when comparing reducing to nonreducing gels, arguing that this membrane protein does not form disulfide bonds (Fig. 2 a) . The migration of this latter pro-tein, however, varied slightly when comparing e.g., the rifampicin-blocked cell lysates to the IMV. The reason of these variations in molecular mass are presently not clear. The dimers of p21 and p16 (but not of p32, or the disulfide bonded forms of the core proteins; see below) were highly resistant to reduction (see also 48, 49); boiling in sample buffer containing 5% ␤ -mercaptoethanol only resulted in little reduction of their dimers. Addition to the standard sample buffer of higher concentrations of SDS or urea (up to 4 M), replacing ␤ -ME by freshly prepared DTT or increasing the boiling time also did not result in a quantitative reduction of either p21 or p16 (not shown). For reasons we do not understand, the most complete re- Figure 1 . Schematic representation of the IMV structure. The brick-shaped core in the central part is made up predominantly by the proteins 4a, 4b, p25, and p11. The core is studded with a layer of spikes that consists at least in part of the p39 protein. The particle is surrounded by two cisternal membrane layers that we believe do not fused with themselves (which is depicted in this figure as a hypothetical overlapping of the cisternal membranes). The inner of the two membranes contains mainly p21 and p16, the outer p35, p32, p8, and the peripheral membrane protein p14 (see also 50). In this model the cisternal envelope is akin to the two membranes of the nuclear envelope, continuous but distinct in protein composition.
