According to the Schwarz's Bayesian Criterion, the appropriate lag length of autoregressive specification AR(q) as given in Eq. (1) is 1 and an AR(1) model is used to analyze the Taiwanese THI cycle. Table 1 summarizes the parameter estimates from the MSM using maximum likelihood estimation. As shown in Table 1 , the model separates the sales growth rate of the Taiwanese tourist hotels into two distinct states. In addition, the average growth rate of state 0 is 1.5% and that of state 1 is 0.7%, indicating that state 0 is the highgrowth state (HGS) and state 1 is the low-growth state (LGS). Accordingly, the standard deviations of HGS and LGS are 0.8% and 3.8%, respectively. The parameter estimates for the transition probabilities are as follows: P 00 ¼ 0.94 and P 11 ¼ 0.65, suggesting that P 10 ¼ 0.06 and P 01 ¼ 0.35. Fig. 2 plots the smoothed probability of the THI being in the HGS and LGS. Following Hamilton (1989) , we can infer the periods of the THI being in HGS or in LGS by using the probability value of 0.5 as the cut-off value (i.e., PrðS t ¼ 1jSG T Þ > 0:5 or PrðS t ¼ 1jSG T Þ < 0:5) for S t ¼ 0 or 1. Further, one can calculate the expected duration of both regimes based on the maximum likelihood parameter estimates. Specifically, conditional on being in state 1 (the highgrowth), the expected duration of HGS is Similarly, the expected duration of LGS is To examine if indeed there are switching states, this study tests the null hypothesis H 0 : a 0 ¼ a 1 . Under this hypothesis, SG follows a stochastic process as described by model with the mean growth rate the same in both states. If a 0 ¼ a 1 , it implies no switching states because the states have the same mean growth rate. A Wald statistic for testing the null hypothesis is given by: The Wald test statistic is 6.56. Given that the 5% critical value of a c 2 (1) is 3.84, the null hypothesis is rejected at the 5% significance level, implying that there are switching states.
