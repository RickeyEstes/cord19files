Lwoff proposed in 1959 that the degree of virulence of viruses is related to their level of temperature sensitivity, i.e. greater sensitivity to heat is correlated with reduced virulence [57] . In 1979, Richman and Murphy confirmed this association and reviewed its implications for the development of live virus vaccines [58] . They noted that the replication of temperature-sensitive (ts) 1 influenza, parainfluenza, RSV, and foot-and-mouth viruses was consistently more restricted in the lungs of a variety of animals than in their nasal cavities. They also found that both naturally-occurring and synthetic ts viruses were very frequently less virulent than their non-ts counterparts in humans and animals, noting several cases (including influenza and vaccinia virus) where the loss of the ts phenotype resulted in the restoration of the virulence or growth capacity of the virus, both in vivo and in vitro [58] . Chu et al. later tested seven H1N1 strains with varying degrees of temperature sensitivity in volunteers and found a correlation between temperature sensitivity and the severity of symptoms, with strains that were more ts being less virulent [59] . It is reasonable to conclude that the ts phenotype facilitates the transmission of the wild virus because it prevents or reduces multiplication of the virus in the lungs or internal organs, which is likely to result in the immobilization, or possibly the death, of the host. One possible explanation of vARI seasonality (M4) is therefore that the lower temperatures of winter increase the activity and virulence of respiratory viruses, as a side-effect of their tropism. This may explain why nearly all respiratory viruses share the same seasonality. It is known that there is a temperature gradient in the human respiratory tract, from around 24°C at the glottis to around 35.5°C at the subsegmental bronchi [52] . The temperature in the respiratory tract drops rapidly when the air being breathed is cold, when the host breaths rapidly, or -significantly -when the host is chilled [50, 52] . Putting these observations together, a simple explanation (M4) of the seasonality and temperature sensitivity of vARIs can be proposed: (1) One or several steps in the life-cycle of most ''wild" respiratory viruses are ts. These ts steps might include the release of virions from cells, their binding to cells, their entry into cells, or any subsequent step in their replication (see the biochemical evidence reviewed below). (2) Ts virions that bind to cells lower down the respiratory tract (therefore at relatively high temperatures) may remain dormant at some unknown cellular location (which might be on extracellular material, on the surface of, or within, the cells that line the respiratory tract). (3) Virions that bind to cells higher up the respiratory tract (therefore at relatively low temperatures) may become active, but will not normally cause a vARI because they are active in low numbers at any one time and can be removed 1 In this article temperature-sensitive or ts refers to viruses that are more active at lower temperatures, i.e. they are heat-sensitive. by the host's immune system (or, if a proportion of virions are defective, simultaneous invasion of each cell by several virions may be required to initiate infection). (4) Each day the temperature of the respiratory tract varies, and this variation clears certain populations of virions from certain regions of the respiratory tract, leaving other populations intact. (5) If the temperature of the respiratory tract drops suddenly below its normal range, batches of virions that were previously dormant may be activated simultaneously, giving rise to a vARI. The virions' binding sites in the respiratory tract might also reflect the correlation, noted by Richman and Murphy, that more virulent strains tend to be less ts [58] . For example, avian influenza virions that can infect human hosts might be expected to bind to cells lower down the respiratory tract than typical seasonal influenza. An important point is that M4 is sensitive to temperature fluctuations, not absolute temperature, because the temperature sensitivity of viruses may adapt quite rapidly as a result of selective pressures, and they can bind in different regions of the respiratory tract. This can explain the data of van Loghem, Milam, Jaakkola and others, discussed above [5, [14] [15] [16] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . It can also explain the seasonality of vARIs, because chilling outside of the range of the previous few days or weeks becomes more likely when the seasonal temperature drops in the autumn. In the spring, by contrast, exceptional chilling becomes less frequent as the seasonal temperature steadily rises. M4 can explain the association of vARIs with wind and rain in the tropics, since these weather events often result in the chilling of individuals, even when the ambient temperature remains constant. It also provides an explanation for the strange epidemiology of influenza, including the low attack rate of many epidemics within families [5, [43] [44] [45] and the rapid cessation of epidemics when many susceptible individuals remain in the population [7] ; bear in mind that each member of a family has a different history of exposure to viruses and of chilling. For example, some family members may take regular outdoor exercise in the winter, which (I suggest) clears virions from the respiratory tract in small batches (outdoor exercise reduces mortality from vARIs [15] ). Other family members may be exposed to a virus for the first time during particularly cold weather (e.g. in midwinter), so that virions bind and become dormant relatively low down the respiratory tract, and are therefore not activated unless even colder weather follows. Still others, who remain indoors much of the time, but are chilled occasionally may be prime candidates for infection (e.g. waiting for a bus in the rain may put individuals at risk -standing still outside in cold weather, and shivering outside, have both been shown to be a dangerous activities [15] ). These trends can therefore explain the low attack rates and lack of transmission within families, as well as the rapid cessation of epidemics. Note that the natural temperature sensitivity of respiratory viruses contributes to M4 in two steps; in a first step, it allows virions to become dormant; in a second step, it provides viral activation as a result of chilling. Step 2, however, could also be the result of the depression of immunity in the host -M3 above. There is no reason to rule this out, and, in the absence of experimental data, the relative contributions of changes in host physiology and virus biochemistry remain unknown. I noted above that changes in host susceptibility alone probably cannot account for the extreme sensitivity of vARIs to small temperature drops, but they may contribute. M3 may contribute to the simultaneous arrival of vARIs across wide geographical areas, and may be at least partly responsible for the arrival vARIs in tropical regions during rainy seasons. However, it seems unlikely that M3 is the main driver of seasonality. As noted above, experiments carried out in the 1950s and 60s with the common cold failed to find an effect where host chilling increased the likelihood of volunteers getting colds [53] [54] [55] [56] . However, it seems likely that the procedure of recycling viruses used in these studies may have eliminated some of the wild virus's natural temperature sensitivity. M4 therefore offers an explanation of the negative results of these studies, as discussed in detail in the next section. I noted above that the Eurowinter Group found that exposure to cold outdoor air can have opposite effects according to the situation: shivering outside greatly increased respiratory disease-related mortality (p-value = 0.001), while outdoor exertion sufficient to cause sweating greatly reduced mortality (p-value = 0.020) [15] . (The absolute values of the regression coefficients of mortality due to respiratory disease on these two cold exposure factors were far higher than any others found by the Group.) The first point, that shivering increased mortality, could be explained by either M3 or M4 -host defenses could be diminished, or virions could be activated, by cold. The second point, that outdoor sweating reduced mortality, is more difficult to explain. Although heat stress may boost the immune system above its normal level, the result would not be noticeably protective if virions are dormant and therefore invisible to the immune system. If they were visible they should be destroyed anyway during the much greater time spent indoors. A roughly neutral effect of M3 would therefore be expected. M4 would suggest that mortality should increase, because outdoor exertion clearly causes cooling of the respiratory tract, due to rapid breathing. The best explanation may be a combination of M3 and M4: the cold air and rapid breathing cools of the respiratory tract, which activates some of the dormant virions that are present. However, the good blood flow to the respiratory tract that is associated with heat stress allows the activated virions to be destroyed by the immune system. There is extensive biochemical evidence for the temperature sensitivity in respiratory viruses, particularly influenza, which is discussed below. This includes temperature sensitivity that is associated with the steps of the uptake of virions into cells [60] , RNA transcription [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] (including the ts control of the balance between the synthesis of mRNA and replicative products [66, 67] ), and the transport to the cell surface of hemagglutininesterase-fusion protein, the protein that promotes the fusion of influenza C virions with cells [68] . In summary, many observations of vARIs cannot be satisfactorily explained without invoking the activation of respiratory viruses by temperature drops or host chilling (M4). The evidence is outlined in Table 1 . M4 is probably the most important driver of seasonality in vARIs, although other mechanisms may also contribute to seasonality, especially the increased susceptibility of hosts as a result of chilling (M3). Moreover, when we consider different virus families, we can expect variations in both the timing and underlying mechanisms of seasonality.
