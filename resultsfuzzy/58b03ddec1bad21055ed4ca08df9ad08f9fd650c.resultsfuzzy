The complete genome sequences of the reemerging Korean strains showed a typical PEDV gene order of 5 0 UTR-ORF1a/1b-S-ORF3-E-M-N-3 0 UTR and were identical or almost identical (one synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the ORF1a/1b gene) to each other. Multiple alignment with other PEDV complete genomes indicated that the reemerging Korean strains possess genome sequences, which are distinct from those of previous Korean field strains (Fig. 1) . A previous study had discussed evidence of frequent recombination events between different genetic lineages or sublineages of PEDV (Huang et al., 2013) . However, genomic sequences of the reemerging Korean strains did not show any regions recombined with those of the previous Korean strains during the recombination analysis performed using SimPlot 3.5.1 (Lole et al., 1999 ) (data not shown). In addition, phylogenetic analysis of the S gene between the reemerging and previous Korean strains of PEDV indicated that the reemerging Korean strains were included into a genetic lineage different from those of previous endemic Korean PEDV strains (Fig. 2) . These results suggest that the reemerging strains have been recently introduced into Korea from another country. Interestingly, comparative genome analysis of the reemerging Korean PEDV isolates and other strains revealed that the complete genome sequences of the recent Korean strains were almost identical (99.9%) to those of the US PEDV strains isolated in 2013 (Fig. 1) . Compared with the complete genome of the reemerging Korean isolates, genomes of the US strains, USA/Iowa/18984/2013 and USA/Indiana/17846/2013 showed five (three non-synonymous Table 1 Primers used for the amplification of full-length genomes of the reemerging Korean PEDV strains.
