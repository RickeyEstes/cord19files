Results are shown in detail in Table 1 . The mean and standard deviation of the width and height of the ciliated conical protrusions were 3.4 ± 0.51 μm (max 4.3; min 2.1) and 3.9 ± 0.52 μm (max 5.1; min 2.8) respectively. A high speed video recording of the ciliated conical protrusions are shown in Additional file 1. Ciliated conical protrusions were observed in the ciliated epithelium in 73% of patients diagnosed with PCD on the initial brush biopsy samples. Examination of the ciliated epithelium from these patients, after regrowth at an air liquid interface, showed a marked reduction in ciliated conical protrusions (73 to 15%). No ciliated conical protrusions were seen in the 67 patients referred for diagnostic testing for PCD where the diagnosis was excluded, or in patients with CF or mild, moderate or severe asthma in the initial samples or following culture of ciliated epithelium at an air liquid interface. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for the presence of ciliated conical protrusions to predict a diagnosis of PCD were 76.5, 100, 100, and 77% respectively (for calculation see Additional file 2). Typical images of the ciliary conical like protrusions on light microscopy are shown in Fig. 1 and on electron microscopy are shown in Fig. 2 . This study reports a novel observation that characteristic ciliated conical protrusions from the surface of ciliated cells are commonly seen in nasal epithelial samples from patients with PCD and are seen across different PCD phenotypes both on light and transmission electron microscopy. They were seen in both very healthy well ciliated strips of epithelium from patients with PCD and in areas where secondary epithelial damage was present. The number seen in patient samples was not associated with increasing patient age. We found the presence of ciliated conical protrusions had a specificity for PCD of 100%. Sensitivity however, was lower at 76.5%. Although fewer ciliate conical protrusions were seen following ciliated cell culture, their presence in cultures suggests they are not due to solely to underlying infection or external inflammatory stimuli. As ciliated cells lining the respiratory epithelium survive for many months, and ciliated cell cultures were studied after just 4 weeks in culture it is possible that the number of protrusions in cell cultures may have increased over time. It is also possible that respiratory infection or inflammation in the respiratory tract of PCD patients may have contributed to increased numbers of ciliated conical projections seen in a b c Fig. 1 Single frame capture from a high-speed video showing ciliated epithelial edges observed using a 100× oil immersion lens. a Healthy control showing an intact ciliated epithelium. b and c Ciliated epithelium from a PCD sample showing characteristic conical ciliated projection (arrow) epithelial samples taken directly from patients. In contrast to protrusion of cells from the epithelial surface (7), that is commonly seen in the presence of secondary epithelial damage [8] , conical ciliated protrusions involve only a proportion of the surface of a ciliated cell and did not appear to be associated with breakdown of intracellular junctions. The absence of ciliated conical protrusions from ciliated cells in patients with mild, moderate and severe asthma and CF, as well as in the epithelium of patients with chronic respiratory symptoms in whom the diagnosis of PCD was ruled out suggests that this feature may be specific to PCD. The ciliated conical protrusions were seen in all phenotypes of PCD studied and were not directly related to the presence of static cilia as in some of the PCD phenotypes studied cilia beat frequency was within the normal range. We could find only one study on cell membranes in patients with PCD, by Kantar and colleagues [19] . This showed increased membrane fluidity in neutrophils from patients with PCD. The authors speculated that alterations in the cytoskeleton may be responsible, however, it was not possible to perform similar measurements in ciliated cells and the mechanism responsible for the ciliated conical protrusions and increased membrane fluidity in neutrophils remains unclear. We believe that a combination of increased membrane fluidity in PCD epithelial cells coupled with disruption in the cellular dynein cytoskeleton may cause the features that we see, however this remains to be proven. The results of this study will not change our diagnostic approach that includes measurement of nasal nitric oxide in those old enough who have patent nasal passages, assessment of ciliary beat pattern and beat frequency by high speed video microscopy and electron microscopy, supplemented by immunofluorescence testing, ciliated cell culture and genetic testing as required. However, as multiple epithelial edges are observed during our initial routine diagnostic assessment the presence of ciliated conical protrusions from can be recorded and may help to increase confidence in diagnosis.
