Numerical simulations were conducted using the CFD software ANSYS/Fluent ® to predict the flow and temperature fields in a capillary tube. The average cell length was approximately 0.074 cm with the least spacing of 12.6 m to resolve the steep variations of velocity and temperature near the surfaces. Computations were conducted on the total grids of 145472, 183913, and 229086 points at CFL = 0.5 and 0.25. During the transient calculations, the normalized residual errors of the flow variables (u, v, w, p and T) converged to 10 −4 with the mass conservation check within 0.5% for each time step. The calculated velocity and temperature profiles along the tube centerline at different grids and CFL values indicated that satisfactory grid independence could be achieved using a mesh setup of 183913 grids with CFL = 0.5. A complete simulation for developing a stable thermo-flowfield (with the greatest variations of the centerline velocity and temperature predictions below 0.5%) requires approximately 240 h of central processing unit (CPU) time on an Intel ® -Core TM i7 990X-3.47GHz work station. Fig. 2 shows (a) the simulated temperature fields controlled by Rayleigh-Bénard (RB) convection, as well as a comparison of (b) the visualized particle path images with (c) the predicted time sequences of streaklines and velocity contours of flow pattern (with an animation, T = 30 s). The temperature of 95 • C was chosen so that a double-stranded DNA could be melted into two strands in the bottom of the capillary tube. Each strand was further duplicated into the double-stranded DNA along the axial tube length with the support of a polymerase enzyme under the effect of natural convection. To view the internal flow structure, the deionized water flow was seeded with 50-m-diameter polystyrene polyamide particles (density p = 1005 kg/m 3 ). This study also used the graphic software Tecplot 360 ® to generate streaklines by releasing a sequence of particles from the discharge points and integrating the solved velocity field to locate their positions in the flow. The calculated streaklines may be further animated to a file. Considering the kinematic impermeability and no-slip conditions satisfied by the real Fig. 2 . Illustration of (a) simulated temperature fields controlled by Rayleigh-Bénard convection, as well as a comparison of (b) the visualized particle path images with (c) the predicted time sequences of streaklines and velocity contours of flow patterns (with an animation). fluid on the walls, the velocity contours demonstrated the swirling flow pattern in which fluid elements on the exterior streamlines circulated inside the RB convection chamber of the capillary tube at a slower rate than those on the interior streamlines. The particle path images from flow visualizations and the predicted time development of streaklines and velocity contours obviously showed a single-roll flow pattern with a mean revolving speed of approximately 1.3 mm/s, corresponding to a 30-s period for finishing a rolling cycle. Overall, the predicted single-roll flow pattern agreed favorably with the observed images. In the capillary, the rolling motion of the fluid allowed the sample to endure annealing and extension effects, and the DNA template fell and was heated once again to achieve the PCR cycles. Both the simulated and experimental results suggest the required time of approximately 30 s to realize a single PCR cycle. Because it normally requires 55-60 cycles to complete a single PCR process, the total reaction time is predicted to be approximately 28 min to complete DNA amplification. This study adopted the target DNA fragment, HBV 122 bp fragment, for the DNA quantification measurements with the number of initial copies of target DNA ranging from 10 1 copies/L to 10 5 copies/L. The test samples were prepared using the LightCycler-Fast Start DNA master (with Cat. No. 03 003 230 001, Roche) and SYBR Green I labeling dye in all of the runs. The quantification experiments were performed on both the commercial RT-PCR instrument and the prototype RT-cPCR machine. The measured results were then compared with the predicted fluorescence intensity computed using the proposed models. To enhance the fluorescence signal quality for the prototype machine, an adaptive signal preprocessing approach was developed based on the lower-upper-middle (LUM) filter scheme [16] . A LUM filter algorithm is based on the comparison between lower order statistics, middle order statistics and upper order statistics to determine the signal intensity output. If optimal parameters can be chosen, the LUM algorithm is good at eliminating noise while keeping the useful information of the fluorescence image. Furthermore, the reproducibility of DNA quantification for both machines was compared using intra-assay and inter-assay methods. This comparison can verify whether the present prototype machine can attain high-quality performance that is comparable with the commercial RT-PCR instrument. Fig. 3 shows (a) a comparison of the fluorescence signal gain plot processed by applying the filtering scheme to the captured fluorescence images with the predictions from the fluorescence model, plus (b) the electrophoresis gel test results. With increasing template, the product appeared earlier to check whether the PCR generated the anticipated DNA fragment (also sometimes referred to as the amplimer or amplicon) for qualitative analysis. In general, the model predictions are in favorable agreement with the measured data from the RT-cPCR prototype machine after treating the fluorescence images. The average error against different initial DNA copies is less than 8%, indicating that adaptive signal processing is an effective approach to eliminate noise and achieve fidelity for accurate DNA quantification. For the electrophoresis gel experiments, lane 1, 100-bp ladder, the initial DNA copy numbers from 10 5 , 10 4 , 10 3 , 10 2 , 10 1 to 0 were amplified by the RT-cPCR platform (lanes 2-7) with a total reaction time of approximately 28 min, which is consistent with the simulated results. This research established an effective simulation model applicable to predict the suitable temperature distribution and flow pattern in the tube for determining the feasibility of the PCR reaction procedure, as well as the required time for accomplishing a PCR revolving cycle. Fig. 4 shows the influence of the adaptive signal processing on fluorescence images from 14 to 23 min at initial DNA copies of 10 5 copies/L to resolve DNA quantification. This study compared the images of raw data with the processed images and noticed the removal of fluorescence signal noise by implementing the adaptive signal processing. The reproducibility of the RT-cPCR machine is primarily affected by the accuracy of the fluorescence detection system. The coefficient of variation (CV) with the percentage unit is commonly adopted as an index and is defined as follows [14] : where C s means the specified initial DNA copies, C M represents the measured initial DNA copies, and n denoted the different experimental data on different days. The CV value stands for the discrepancy between the average of several quantification results and the number of specified DNA copies, whereas a relatively low CV value indicates high reproducibility of the system with all induced measurement errors minimized. Fig. 5 shows the CV values tested by using different initial DNA copies from the present prototype machine and the commercial RT-PCR instrument. The values of correlation coefficient R 2 indicate the accuracy of the measured Table 3 The difference between the traditional machine and our platform. results. When the R 2 values are close to 1, the accuracy approaches perfection. The values can be determined by: The R 2 values of the commercial RT-PCR instrument and this RT-cPCR platform were 0.993 and 0.988, respectively. The reproducibility of the prototype machine was significantly enhanced by implementing the filtering scheme to the captured images for reaching similar CV values, compared to those obtained from the commercial RT-PCR instrument. This study demonstrates that the developed adaptive image-processing scheme can adequately filter the captured fluorescence images for achieving good reproducibility of the proposed low-cost CCD-based fluorescence detection system in the DNA quantification process. Table 3 presents the advantages of the proposed prototype machine over the conventional RT-PCR instrument. The proposed RT-cPCR prototype machine basically adopts a simple design concept by employing single temperature control in the heating system and a capillary as the reagent holder with a weight of less than 1 kg, and the reaction time of the prototype RT-cPCR platform can be retained to less than 30 min. The estimated price of the RT-cPCR prototype machine can be reduced to US$1000 for easier access to medical applications in less-developed countries.
