To identify possible mutations that could explain the highly effective attenuation observed, deep sequencing of heat and RNAse treated virions from infected vero cells resulted in a total of 59.42 and 24.44 MB of raw reads were obtained by RNA seq for the treated and untreated samples, respectively. Clean reads obtained after trimming were 26.94 and 19.53 GB, respectively. The Qphred20 values for the clean reads were 96.69 and 98.49 for the untreated and tread samples, respectively, indicating satisfactory quality of the data obtained. As listed in Table 2 SNPs and insertions or deletions (INDELS) were detected in the polyprotein, spike and envelope proteins ( Table 2 , S1 Sequence File and Supplementary Figures 1-3 ) of heat and RNAse treated virions, when compared to the untreated virions. In addition, insertions and deletions were detected in the S1 region for the spike protein. The N terminal signal peptide region of the spike protein had a 2 amino acid deletion and one non-synonymous change at position 355, changing the sequence from IGEN to K-N. A conservative in-frame insertion was detected at position 355 in the S1 region, changing the amino acid sequence from L----AT to LKKKGAT ( Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 2) .
