The parameters are initialized as the beginning: N 0 = 6 refers to the total number of days (for which study is conducted) the epidemic lasts. N(1) = 5 means there are in all five cases of new outbreaks on the first day. The other parameters A, b, B, C and S will be determined in the simulation by comparing with the actual epidemic data. Results of simulation are shown in Figs It is easy to see that the simulation is roughly in accordance with the actual situation. The parameters related to the artificial interventions include B and C. If B is large, the epidemic can take place few times in most simulations; if B is very small, the epidemic can always happen and most times the overflow can happen. As for C, if it is small enough, the epidemic hardly takes place, otherwise it can almost happen. Therefore the effective, powerful and stringent control measures are the key to stop the epidemics. It should be pointed out that the parameters in the model are independent of each other, since each of them plays an independent role. These parameters have definite meaning, so the result of simulation can hardly coincide with the actual situation of the epidemic if the parameters cannot be adjusted to proper values. Simulation results are presented in Table 1 . It is clear from the table that the probability of new outbreak to occur decreases with the increase of distance from the source countries. The probability of occurrence of outbreak in India is very low because the flu virus reaches on the sixth day and also the country is far from the source country. The probability of occurrence of outbreak in Indonesia is also very low even on the second day. This is due to very large distance from the source country and also due to some other factors (like temperature). Figs. 3 and 4 show the pattern, that the probability of outbreak to take place follows, depending upon the distance and number of days. These graphs show that the probability of outbreak is inversely proportional to the distance from the source country as well as the day on which the flu virus reaches the country.
