The intraperitoneal injection of allogeneic tumor cells has been shown to generate allogeneic specific CTLs recoverable from IELs and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) 6-11 days after immunization Parrott, 1980,1981; Parrott et al., 1983) . This cytotoxic activity was observed without re-stimulation of isolated effector cells in an in vitro MLR. Control mice do not respond to allogeneic targets, and the subcutaneous route of immunization does not generate high levels of CTL activity in the gut mucosa (Davies and Parrott, 1981; Parrott et al., 1983) . LPLs contained the highest levels of cytotoxic activity of all tissues tested after intraperitoneal immunization; this cytotoxicity lasted for prolonged periods (>40 days; Parrott et al., 1983) . The phenotype of both alloantigen-specific effectors and precursor CTLs (pCTLs) generated in vitro in primary isolated IEL MLR cultures was shown to be Thy Γ Lyt 2 + . The frequency of alloantigen-specific pCTLs was found to be approximately threefold higher among unfractionated splenocytes than in isolated IELs . Alloantigen-specific CTL clones have been obtained from isolated IELs derived from BALB/c mice that were immunized twice, intragastrically and intraperitoneally, with allogeneic tumor cells (EL-4) (Klein et al., 1985; Klein and Kagnoff, 1987) . Two types of effector clone were generated: (1) clones that were antigen specific with respect to proliferation and cytolytic activity and (2) clones that were antigen specific for proliferation but were not cytolytic when maintained in 4% Con A-conditioned medium. When cultured in the presence of 25% Con A-conditioned medium for 4 days, these clones exhibited broad lytic potential and were cytotoxic for EL-4 cells, P-815 cells (SC), and Yac-1 cells (NK), as well as for syngeneic and allogeneic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) blasts. Although one clone (D3) was reported lytic for syngeneic LPS blasts, it does not lyse itself when 51 Cr-labeled D3 cells are used as targets. The phenotype of both types of clones was Thy 1 + Lyt 2 + (Klein et aL, 1985; Klein and Kagnoff, 1987) . These broadly cytotoxic clones may be an in vitro counterpart of the broadly cytotoxic NCTC cells observed in normal Peyer's patches. The presence of broadly cytotoxic cells in gut mucosal tissues might be one mechanism by which mucosal tissues are protected from infection with particular intracellular pathogens. Infection of mice with several strains of rotavirus is a potent inducer of virus-specific CTLs. Rotavirus infection by either oral or parenteral route elicits effector CTLs in multiple lymphoid tissues that can be detected without in vitro amplification Dudzik, 1988,1989b; Offit and Svoboda, 1989; Offit et al., 1991b) . Effector and precursor CTLs are serotype nonspecific Thy 1 + CD8 + lymphocytes Dudzik, 1988,1989b; Offit and Svoboda, 1989; Dharakul et al., 1991; Offit et al., 1991a) . Although these effectors usually are elicited by infection with replicating virus, inoculation with noninfectious virus has been shown to be capable of eliciting rotavirus-specific CTLs (Offit and Dudzik, 1989a) . The tissue distribution of rotavirus-specific CTLs has been analyzed after various routes of immunization. The salient observations from these studies follow: (1) Six days after oral immunization, effector CTLs were detected among Peyer's patch, mesenteric lymph node, LPL, spleen, and IEL lymphocyte populations (Offit and Dudzik, 1989b; Offit et al., 1991b) . (2) Six days after intraperitoneal or subcutaneous immunization, effector CTLs were detected among Peyer's patch, mesenteric lymph node, LPL, spleen, and peripheral lymph node lymphocytes. Effector CTLs were observed in IELs after intraperitoneal but not subcutaneous immunization (Offit and Dudzik, 1989b; Offit et al., 1991b) . (3) Four weeks after oral, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous immunization, pCTLs (as assayed by in vitro culture) were detected in Peyer's patch, mesenteric lymph node, LPL, spleen, and peripheral lymph node but not IEL lymphocyte populations (Offit and Dudzik, 1989b; Offit et al., 1991b) . (4) IEL effector CTLs obtained from orally infected mice were shown to be CD3 + and express the aß form of the TcR (Offit et al., 1991b) . (5) When the frequency of pCTLs was analyzed 3, 6, and 21 days after immunization, the site of rotavirus infection determined that pCTL first appeared in Peyer's patch and mesenteric lymph nodes three days after oral infection. Three days after footpad infection, pCTLs were detected first in the inguinal peripheral lymph node. At six days, pCTLs were 30-fold higher in Peyer's patches after oral infection and ~7fold higher in inginual peripheral lymph node after footpad infection. However, by 21 days, pCTLs were distributed uniformly throughout the lymphoid system (with the excep-tion of IEL), regardless of the route of immunization (Offit and Dudzik, 1988; Offit et aL, 1991b) . Thus, in contrast to results obtained with gut mucosal reovirus infection, which suggested that the route of immunization may be important for the generation and maintenance of a gut mucosal CTL response, the route of immunization with rotavirus does not appear to be as important for the generation of disseminated gut mucosal responses. The lack of persistence of rotavirusspecific pCTLs in the epithelium also contrasts with results obtained with gut mucosal reovirus infection. These discrepancies are likely to be the results of differences in virus dissemination and interaction with the immune system, and suggest that different strategies for particular mucosal pathogens may be devised that elicit protective T-cell immunity at mucosal surfaces. The potential functional relevance of rotavirus-specific CTLs has been demonstrated in two animal model systems. In the first example, Thy 1 + CD8 + splenocytes obtained from intraperitoneally immunized mice passively protect suckling mice against diarrhea induced by rotavirus challenge (Offit and Dudzik, 1990 ). In the second, rotavirus infection was cleared in SCID mice after the transfer of immune CD8 + splenic lymphocytes from intraperitoneally immunized histocompatible mice (Dharakul et aL, 1990 (Dharakul et aL, ,1991 . Interestingly, CD8 + immune splenocytes or Thy 1 + CD8 + IELs obtained from orally immunized mice only temporarily cleared rotavirus infection of SCID mice (Dharakul et aL, 1990 (Dharakul et aL, ,1991 . Whether the suboptimal ability of orally immunized spleen and IELs to contain rotavirus infection in SCID mice is a result of intrinsic differences in cell population after oral or intraperitoneal immunization or is simply a technical problem remains to be resolved. 


Section:. intraperitoneal injection or chronic feeding of mhc disparate tumor cells (el-4 cells into balb/c mice) was found to increase the level of allogeneic cytotoxicity developed in secondary mlr cultures of primed rather than normal peyer's patch lymphocytes, suggesting that the gut mucosal application of stimulator cells results in an increase in precursor frequency
Section:. in contrast, gut mucosal infection with rotavirus results in a generalized infection of small intestinal villous epithelial cells and can cause acute viral gastroenteritis in humans and animals (offit and dudzik, 1989a, and references therein).
