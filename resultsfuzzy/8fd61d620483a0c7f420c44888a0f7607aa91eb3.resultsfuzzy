The isolation and identification of a particular virus, or demonstration of infection by serological methods, in a patient with a given disease, are not necessarily relevant to the for example, the rate of new hepatitis C infections 5. Evaluate immunization programs, for example, measles, hepatitis B 6. Assess level of herd immunity, for example, influenza 7. Assess exposure resulting from occupation, lifestylewhether certain activities are associated with increased rates of infection? 8. Use age-specific prevalence patterns to analyze transmission efficiencies and possible transmission routes, for example, age-specific acquisition of EBV antibody 9. Determine whether an apparently new infection in man has actually been already circulating subclinically 10. Search for an animal reservoir of an apparently new zoonotic infection, for example, which non-human species show antibodies to SARS or Ebola viruses The usual approach is to regard all unknown biological specimens as potentially infectious, and to apply a level of containment appropriate to the majority of agents likely to be present, for example, BSL2; individual samples from known or suspected cases of greater hazard, for example, Ebola, are handled at a higher containment level once these are identified. Similarly, material from laboratory or wild animals, particularly primates, may contain unknown pathogens with a danger to humans. For all containment levels, good laboratory technique is an essential aspect for avoiding laboratory hazards. Use of elaborate safety equipment, negative air pressure management, etc. will not compensate for sloppy or unsafe practices. Rigorous aseptic technique must be practiced. Mouth pipetting is banned. Laboratory coats must be worn at all times, gloves must be used for handling potentially infectious materials, and special care taken with sharp objects. Rigorous attention must be given to sterilization, where possible by autoclaving, of all potentially infectious waste as well as used equipment. Special arrangements for the disposal of "sharps" are essential. Spills are cleaned up with an appropriate chemical disinfectant. Staff should be immunized against such diseases as hepatitis B and poliomyelitis as a matter of routine and, when vaccines are available, against more exotic agents in those special laboratories handling such viruses. Limitations should be placed on the type of work undertaken by pregnant or immunosuppressed employees. It is also important to inactivate the infectivity of any particularly dangerous viruses employed as antigens in serological tests other than virus neutralization (e.g., arenaviruses, rhabdoviruses, togaviruses, or flaviviruses). This can be done, without destroying antigenicity, by Î³-irradiation, or by photodynamic inactivation with ultraviolet light in the presence of psoralen or related compounds. Viral proteins produced by recombinant DNA technology provide a simple, standardized, and safe alternative to whole virus as antigen in many serological tests.
