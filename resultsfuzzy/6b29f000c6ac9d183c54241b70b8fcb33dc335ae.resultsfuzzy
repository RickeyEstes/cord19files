We first compared results from the unchanged naive experimental design (such as used in [10] ) to a non-iterative version of the optimal design algorithm described above, i.e., optimizing only the observation times (τ ) or the input ⃗ b. For each case, we considered a scenario with 27 experimental observation times of total RNA3 over 26 h, where the initial and final times were fixed at t = 0 h to t = 26 h, respectively ( Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 ). Only results from SE-optimal design criteria were plotted in Fig. 1 , since this criterion, unsurprisingly, results in the lowest standard errors for each parameter. We also consider the simple case in which the time intervals over which ⃗ . . , H, are of equal length. We found that optimizing the input ⃗ b with the SE-optimal design criteria resulted in lower normalized standard errors (NSE) for each parameter as compared to optimizing the time points τ or the naive experimental design (Table 1 ). Among optimizations of ⃗ b, SE-optimal design criteria outperformed the D-and E-criteria when considering the overall sum of the NSEs (see Fig. 3 ). We next compared results from SE-, D-, and E-optimal design criteria when iterating between Eqs. (4) and (5) (see Fig. 2 ). We found that the effectiveness in using the algorithm allowed the use of less observation time points; hence in the results below we used 14 observation time points instead of 27. Overall, the iterative algorithm outputs an experimental design which may result in significantly lower standard errors for all parameter estimates as compared to the naive experimental design regardless of the optimal design criteria choice (Fig. 3 (left) , zero iterations = naive experimental design). Between the optimal design criterion, the SE-optimal design resulted in the lowest sum of NSEs, followed by D-optimal and E-optimal designs, although we note that there was variability in this comparison for each individual parameter (Table 2) .
