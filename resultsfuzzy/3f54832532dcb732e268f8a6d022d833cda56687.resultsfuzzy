Printing and Detection of Anti-IgG-HRP Antibody on a Paper-Based Platform. First, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 μg/ mL aliquots of the anti-IgG-HRP antibody were loaded on a Piezo printhead inkjet printer and printed on printing paper and nitrocellulose and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes ( Figure 1A ,B). Data suggest that IgG-HRP antibodies were successfully printed on the paper-based membrane ( Figure 1B) . The printed IgG-HRP antibodies on paper-based membranes were then incubated with the HRP substrate, and the HRP signal intensity was recorded. Chemiluminescence intensities from 100 μg/mL of the printed IgG-HRP antibody gave values of 4123 ± 1214, 4325 ± 385, and 4936 ± 325 (arbitrary unit) for printing paper, nitrocellulose membrane, and PVDF membrane, respectively ( Figure 1C ). Stability Measurement of Membrane-Printed IgG-HRP. Three different paper-based membranes printed with the IgG-HRP antibody were stored at room temperature (r.t.), 4°C or −20°C for 1−180 days, and the HRP signal was monitored ( Figure 2A ). The data suggest that the signal intensity from IgG-HRP printed on printing paper decreased by half on days 56.3 and 57.1 (from 0.8 cm diameter dot) under 4 and −20°C storage conditions, respectively, while that at r.t. was 6.7 days ( Figure 2B −D). The chemiluminescence intensity of IgG-HRP printed on both nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes decreased by half on day 1.3 and day 2.5, respectively. Storage temperature does not induce >10% changes in the signal for nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes. No chemiluminescence signals from the printed IgG-HRP antibody were detected after 6 months of storage for printing paper or nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes. Detection of Printed PSMA and TNF-α on a Paper-Based Platform. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) recombinant proteins were printed on printing paper and nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes ( Figure 3A ,B). After the designated storage period, PSMA/TNF-α printed paper strips were incubated with antibodies-HRP, and HRP signals were monitored. The chemiluminescence signal intensity from anti-PSMA and anti-TNF-α antibodies conjugated with HRP increased as the concentration of printed PSMA and TNF-α increased ( Figure 3C ,D). PSMA and TNF-α printed on printing paper showed the highest signal intensity from antibody-HRP (2016 and 2786, respectively, from a 0.8 cm diameter dot, arbitrary unit), followed by PVDF (1073 and 1932, respectively) and nitrocellulose membrane (496 and 693, respectively). Stability Monitoring of Paper-Based Sensors of PSMA and TNF-α. Printed PSMA and TNF-α were stored at r.t., 4, or −20°C for 28 days, and chemiluminescence signal intensities from antibody-HRP were monitored. Signal intensity from printed PSMA was reduced by half on days 3.3, 3.1, and 2.6 for −20, 4°C, and r.t. storage, respectively, for printing paper ( Figure 4A ), while that of nitrocellulose was 0.9 ± 0.2 ( Figure 4B ). Times to reach half intensities compared to the original signal for printed PSMA on the PVDF membrane were 4.1, 3.8, and 2.9 days for −20, 4°C, and r.t. storage ( Figure 4C ). Signal intensity from printed TNF-α was similar to printed PSMA, and the time to reach half intensities of the initial signal was the longest for the PVDF membrane followed by printing paper and nitrocellulose membrane ( Figure 4D − F). No signals were detected.
