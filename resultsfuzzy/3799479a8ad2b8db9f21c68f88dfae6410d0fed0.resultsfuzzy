Across the three experiments, SignalP is clearly the most accurate; with the ANN version [16] achieving slightly better results over the HMM version [17] . This is followed by Rapid Prediction of Signal Peptides (RPSP) [24] . It can be seen that most tools achieve accuracies well over 80%, which is consistent with what have been reported in many earlier studies, without complete details of specificity and sensitivity. A breakdown of the prediction results measured by sensitivity and specificity for each experiment, give us a better account of the strength and weakness of each tool. Results from experiment 1 The first experiment uses 270 eukaryotic (human) sequences with experimentally verified SPs, from the study by Zhang and Henzel [20] . Table 1 : Description of the three datasets developed for benchmarking the thirteen SP prediction tools. Only the first 70aa of the sequence are retained as input. All the negative dataset are subjected to redundancy reduction. T denotes the sequence identity threshold set for redundancy reduction. 1 From a first-pass-filtered set of 9,851 reduced to 4,989 upon redundancy reduction (T = 40%) and atypical/spurious sequences removed; 2 From a first-pass-filtered set of 427 reduced to 230 (T = 40%); 3 From a first-pass-filtered set of 370 reduced to 307 (T = 65%); 4 From a first-pass-filtered set of 8,930 reduced to 4,445 (T = 40%); 5 From a first-pass-filtered set of 110 reduced to 61 (T = 40%); 6 Based on the results from this experiment ( Figure 2 and Table 2 ), Signal-BLAST predicts the highest number of correct positive instances (i.e. best sensitivity) (0.978). This is dramatically reversed when it scores 0.815 in specificity upon tested with negative instances where it is tasked to distinguish between secretory and non-secretory proteins. This contrasting result is expected since Signal-BLAST which uses a pairwise alignment algorithm (BLAST tool [35] ) at its core, needs to find a delicate balance between the two types of datasets in order to achieve a good discrimination. SignalP scores the second best accuracy with the artificial neural network ( Signal-CF [27] and Signal3L [29] which adopt the "subsite-coupled model" achieve accuracies of 0.774 and 0.813 respectively. The results are lower than those reported in the authors' publications using the same dataset. Manual inspection of Signal-3L revealed that there was a mistake quoted by the authors in their publication [29] . For the entry [Swiss-Prot: Q6UXL0], the authors reported the cleavage site as 28aa instead of the correct 29aa that the authors indicated in their supplied supplementary data ("Online Supporting Information B: Signal-CF dataset -supp-B.txt"). Thus, the tools that were evaluated may have been wrongly penalized (SignalP (version 3.0) and PrediSi [22] ). From our examination, Signal-CF and Signal-3L identify the cleavage site at 63aa and 28aa respectively based on the input sequence of length 70aa. When we reduced its evaluation length to LENGTH(SP)+LENGTH(30aa of the mature peptide) which is 59aa in length (the sequence being: MQTF TM VLEE IW TS LFM WFFYALIPCLLTDEVAIL-PAPQNLSVLSTNMKHLLMWSPVIA) as reported in their publication, Signal-CF and Signal-3L reported SPs of 29aa and 28aa. Comparing the two tools, we noted that selecting the correct "species" option in Signal-3L is critical; otherwise a markedly different length of SP is reported. Signal-CF, on the other hand, is extremely sensitive to the different lengths. Additionally, it is unclear whether the additional classification of sequences into more specific groups (e.g. plant, human, animal etc.) adopted by Signal-3L is able to generate greater advantage over Signal-CF as we shall see in the other experiments. Sensitivities of SOSUIsignal (0.189) [28] and SPOCTO-PUS [30] (0.393) are not comparable to the other methods. This is possibly because identification of cleavage site may not have been a priority in their study [28] as SOSUIsignal was developed to discriminate SPs from non-SPs containing sequences while SPOCTO-PUS was developed as a combined predictor for SPs and membrane protein topology. Other methods namely Philius, Phobius, PrediSi, SigHMM, RPSP and Signal-3L return accuracies that are above 0.800 or 80%. However, closer examination reveals that although their specificities are impressive, their sensitivities are modest, largely in the range of 0.630 to 0.790. The second experiment recruits a much larger dataset consisting of 4,704 sequences that are spilt into positive and negative datasets of equal size. The negative set consists of a mix of Euk cytoplasmic and nuclear sequences. The dataset is further divided into the three organism groups (details available in Table 1 ). SignalP-ANN (Acc:0.910) and SignalP-HMM (Acc:0.903) achieve the best overall accuracies. This is closely followed by RPSP (Acc:0.901), an extremely fast prediction tool with excellent specificity in discriminating Results from Experiment 3. The datasets employed in this experiment are derived from Swiss-Prot Release 57.0 and subjected to the filtering process described in [33] . Table 2 and Figure 4 . Here, SignalP (both ANN and HMM versions; with HMM scoring higher than ANN) again presents consistently high results. The sensitivity values for other tools plummet particularly when tested with the Gpos dataset. This drop is particularly acute for Signal-BLAST, despite its more recent update. We checked the distribution of the data but do not note any significant differences compared to the previous two datasets.
