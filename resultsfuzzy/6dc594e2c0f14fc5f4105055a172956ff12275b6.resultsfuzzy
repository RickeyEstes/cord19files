A set of 35 different amino acid sequences of SCV helicase proteins, collected from the NCBI protein database, was aligned using the ClustalW v.1.8 software [11] and among all the considered sequences pairwise identities of 99% were observed. Thus, a representative consensus sequence was obtained for the SCV helicase, suggesting the presence of two separate domains, i.e., the helicase domain (Hel) and a metal binding domain (MBD). Such a combination of a putative MBD and a Hel domain in the same protein, as in Equine Arterivirus nsp10, has been found in a number of other viral and cellular proteins [24] [25] [26] . Accordingly, the nsp13 model building was performed in two separate steps, one for each domain of the enzyme, and a hybrid protein structure was assembled from the two modeled domains. A 3D model of the SCV helicase Hel domain, spanning residues 80-568, was made on the basis of the crystal structure of the Escherichia coli Rep helicase. Both helicases belong to the same Superfamily 1 helicase classification on the basis of seven conserved sequence motifs [27] . Therefore, the Protein Data Bank entry 1UAA [16] , corresponding to E. coli Rep helicase crystal structure, was used as a suitable template for a model building of the Hel domain using the threading program Pyre v.0.2 [14] . A manual alignment between the secondary structure elements predicted by shuffled PsiPred runs [13] and the ones observed in the model enhanced the correspondence of identical and positively conserved residues, respectively to 11% and 23%. As far as the MBD structure is concerned, it should be noted that all coronaviruses exhibit very different amino acid sequences. However, coronavirus MBDs, as well as all the other nidoviruses, have a Cys and His rich motif which can orient the overall modeling procedure of this domain. In fact, arterivirus helicases have been shown to possess MBD domains which coordinate four Zn 2+ [28, 29] in a way that could be similarly adopted by coronaviruses. In this Zn 2+ binding domain, known also as binuclear cluster, a Cys residue coordinates two closely spaced Zn 2+ ions bridging a Zn 2 Cys 6 group, typically found in GAL4-like proteins [30] with Zn 2 Cys 4 His 2 , found in RAG1 domain [31] . The SCV MBD structure has been reconstructed using tetrahedral geometry characterization, distance constraints, and orientations typical of Cys and His residues of the latter clusters, suggested by the crystal structures of GAL4-like and RAG1. The corresponding Protein Data Bank files, 1PYI, and 1RMD, respectively [30, 31] , provided accurate distance constraints for the two components of the MBD. The reliability of the predicted tertiary structures of both SCV helicase domains was tested on the basis of simple physico-chemical rules, such as the ones suggested by Ramachandran plots, and the agreement between hydropathy profile and residue accessibility in the two modeled structures. Additional features which support the predicted structure of the Hel domain are given by the fact that 10 out of a total 15 cysteine residues, which are predicted to form cystine bonds, are involved in disulphide bridges. After refinements of loop regions and manual tracing of side-chains for both Hel and MBD models no severe disallowed atomic contact was detected with PROCHECK v.3.5.4 [19] , suggesting an essentially good stereochemistry, with 63% and 29% of the residues in the most favored and additional allowed regions, respectively, and with 4.8% and 3.2% residues in generously allowed and disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Once the models of the Hel and MBD domains had been successfully predicted, a molecular docking simulation was carried out to obtain the complete nsp13 tertiary structure in an unbiased way. Among the lowest energy solutions, only the ones consistent with the overall protein sequence were taken into account and manually refined before a final energy minimization. The theoretical structure of SCV nsp13, shown in Fig. 1 , was again confirmed by PROCHECK v.3.5.4 [19] and deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the ID code 2G1F. Reliability of protein structures may be conveniently assessed by PROSAII program package [20] and, accordingly, the predicted single components of the SCV helicase as well as the final tertiary structure have been considered by this program package. In Fig. 2 , we compared the energy profiles obtained with PROSAII program package [20] for the isolated Hel and MBD domains with the one calculated for the entire SCV helicase structure. From the negative values of the energy, which have been obtained by subtracting the energy profile of the two separate domains from the one calculated for the final protein structure, see Fig. 2 , it is apparent that higher stability is achieved when the two domains are assembled. Negative peaks in the latter profiles, indeed, are found for the interface regions of the two domains, i.e., 42-48 residues for MBD and 198-204, 325-335, and 353-360 residues for the Hel domain, respectively. Since a typical ATP binding site motif between residues 282 and 289 of the helicase sequence may be predicted, it is noteworthy that in the obtained nsp13 model the corresponding fragment, the so-called P-loop, is surface exposed and located between a b strand and a short a helix, exactly as this active site should be [32] , see Fig. 1 . We conclude that a theoretical model of SCV helicase is here proposed which will provide a foundation for the rational design of helicase inhibitors that could potentially act as anti-SCV drugs.
