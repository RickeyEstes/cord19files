To determine whether pretreatment of either cells or virus affects the viral infectivity, cells or the TGEV inoculum were treated with concentrations up to 25 mM of LiCl prior to infection. Subsequent infection of either LiCl-treated cells with untreated virus or untreated cells with LiCl-treated virus indicated that there is no inhibitory effect regardless whether infection was analyzed by plaque or MTT assays (data not shown).
