The retention of Tfl0 could have been caused if Tfl0 were inefficiently released from the TfR after returning to the cell surface. For example, if the rate of receptor-ligand dissociation was slow in comparison to the internalization rate of the receptor, the receptor bound Tfl0 would be reinternalized and persistently recycle. If recycling of occupied receptors occurred, a pool of surface-bound ligand would appear during externalization. TRVb-1 cells were incubated with 3 },g/mi of either ~25I-Tf or 125I-Tf10 for 15 min. Surface-bound ligand was removed by a mild acid wash. The surface-cleared cells were chased for varying amounts of time, and the supernatant was removed. The cells were incubated again in a mild acid wash to release any ligand that had returned to the surface and remained bound. Radioactivity released by the second acid wash was used as a measure of recycling. No more than 1-2% of the original cell associated 125I-Tf was contained in the second Nonspecific binding was determined as before. Surface associated Tf or Tflo was removed by a 2-rain mild acid wash as described in Materials and Methods. The surface-stripped cells were incubated for varying amounts of time at 37Â°C. The supernatant from each sample was removed, assayed for 125I content and brought to 10% TCA. The resulting precipitate was assayed for 125I content and defined as the released intact fraction (squares). The relased degraded fraction (triangles) was defined as the difference between the 1251 found in the original supernatant and that found in the precipitate. The cells were solubilized with 1 N NaOH, assayed for 125I content and designated as cell associated fraction (circles). The data are reported as a percentage of the sum of three fractions (Cell associated, Released lntact, and Released degraded) at each time point. The sum of three fractions varied less than 5% between time points. The data presented are from a representative experiment. Error bars give the standard deviation for each data point. acid wash. While the amount of 125I-Tf10 found in the second acid wash was approximately twice that of Tf, it never exceeded 4% of the originally bound 125I-Tf10. The small amount of surface Tf and Tfl0 decreased with time (data not shown). The higher amount of Tfl0 on the cell surface may be accounted for by the twofold decrease in the internalization rate of Tfl0 as compared to Tf. These data indicated that the observed retention of Tfl0 is not a result of an elevated level of recycling of Tfl0 without release at the surface.
