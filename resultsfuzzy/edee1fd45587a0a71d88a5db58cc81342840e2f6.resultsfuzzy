Our host kinome data suggested that pdm2009-MRSA co-infection-mediated modulation of host cell signaling responses shifted to a MRSA-dominated response during the 8-12-h post-MRSA addition period. Thus, we next examined whether the MRSA-dominated host response observed in the kinome data also dominated barrier function disruption. To assess this, we incorporated ECIS to characterize alveolar epithelial cell barrier function in response to pdm2009-MRSA infection by measuring temporal changes in resistance [47] .  Our host kinome data suggested that pdm2009-MRSA co-infection-mediated modulation of host cell signaling responses shifted to a MRSA-dominated response during the 8-12-h post-MRSA addition period. Thus, we next examined whether the MRSA-dominated host response observed in the kinome data also dominated barrier function disruption. To assess this, we incorporated ECIS to characterize alveolar epithelial cell barrier function in response to pdm2009-MRSA infection by measuring temporal changes in resistance [47] . Alveolar epithelial cells were initially plated and rested overnight prior to pdm2009 infection (0 h). Following the overnight rest, cells were infected with pdm2009 (first arrow; Figure 5 ). Mock-infected control cells were treated with media alone. IAV-and mock-infected cells were subsequently infected with mid-log phase MRSA or mock-infected with media alone (second arrow; Figure 5 ), and resistance was continually monitored for the duration of the experiment. A summary of the data is presented in Figure 5 , beginning just prior to the initial infection with pdm2009 (20 h). Mock-infected cells were left untreated throughout the duration of the experiment (negative control). Infection of alveolar epithelial cells with pdm2009-alone at a MOI of 0.1 resulted in no changes to resistance during the first 24 h of infection. Only a small loss in resistance was found following the addition of mock-infected inoculum at 43 h ( Figure 5A ). The addition of MRSA (MOI 0.1) to mock-infected alveolar epithelial cells at 43 h resulted in the loss of resistance of the alveolar epithelial monolayer beginning at 57 h. Infection with pdm2009-MRSA (MOI 0.1) resulted in a nearly identical loss in resistance across the alveolar epithelial cells as that for infection with MRSA-alone. We also examined how a lower MOI of MRSA would affect the trends in resistance across our alveolar epithelial cells. Losses in resistance across the alveolar epithelial monolayers were similar between the two MOIs of MRSA tested (0.1 and 0.01). In contrast, the trend in resistance measurements differed slightly between the two MOIs of MRSA during co-infection. As these results suggested that pdm2009-MRSA co-infection-mediated disruption of alveolar epithelial barrier function largely resembled that of MRSA infection alone, we sought to expand on these observations. We examined pdm2009-MRSA co-infection using higher MOI pdm2009 and/or lower MOI MRSA inocula ( Figure 5B ). Infection with pdm2009-MRSA (MOI 0.1; MOI 0.01) resulted in a nearly identical loss in resistance across the alveolar epithelial cells as that for infection with MRSA-alone. We also examined how a higher MOI of pdm2009 would affect the trends in resistance across our alveolar epithelial cells. By 9 h post-pdm2009 infection (31 h; MOI 3), the resistance measurements began to decrease from the mock-infected condition and remained under 300 ohms for the duration of the experiment. Following the addition of MRSA (MOI 0.01) to the high MOI pdm2009-infected cells, resistance values across the alveolar epithelial cells began to decrease at the same time as in MRSA-alone and MOI 0.1 pdm2009-MRSA infections. However, the high MOI pdm2009-MRSA infections resulted in losses to resistance equivalent to those of the 1% triton-treated cells much more rapidly than the other infection conditions. To examine the effect of pdm2009-MRSA co-infection on distal regions of the respiratory tract, we investigated the effects of co-infection on HBEC-3KT human bronchial epithelial cells ( Figure S2 ). The trends in loss of resistance during MRSA-alone-and pdm2009-MRSA-co-infection were largely similar to those found in A549 cells. Collectively, these data suggested that the increased damage imparted to respiratory epithelial cells by high MOI pdm2009 results in exacerbated MRSA-mediated cytotoxicity during co-infection, even at low MOIs of bacteria.
