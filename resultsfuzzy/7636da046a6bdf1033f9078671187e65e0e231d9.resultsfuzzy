Four patients, two from each sex, had six cases of infection related to CVC during the study (two patients had two cases). All were younger than 65 years old, none was at the ICU, and three had a totally implantable CVC. Table 3) . Among the 308 observations not associated with positive blood cultures, 16 were collected in presence of clinical signs suggestive of infection, between 3 days before and 1 day after withdrawal of negative blood cultures. Therefore, when the measurements related to negative and positive blood cultures were compared, the temperature around the CVC insertion area was higher in those with CRBSI (p=0.03; statistical power of 0.58). Also, higher mean values were encountered in patients with infection in both subtractions of temperatures: catheter area minus forehead (p=0.03; statistical power of 0.85) and catheter area minus contralateral region (p=0.02; statistical power of 0.45), respectively (Table 4) .
