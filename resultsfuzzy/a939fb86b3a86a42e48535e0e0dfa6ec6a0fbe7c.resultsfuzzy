A total of 645 diarrheic fecal samples from 629 calf herds were screened by RT-PCR and nested PCR. Nine positive fecal samples from 9 herds were detected using the 1-step RT-PCR assay, which targeted a 594 bp fragment of the RdRp region in the unclassified BECs. Fifty-nine fecal samples (9.2%) from 57 herds (9.3%) were found positive by the nested PCR assay, which targeted a 194 bp fragment of the RdRp region. Of the 59 unclassified BECs-positive fecal specimens, 19 fecal samples (2.9%) from 18 herds (2.8%) tested positive to this virus alone. The other 40 fecal samples (6.2%) from the 39 herds (6.2%) also tested positive to other enteric pathogens including BRV A-C, BCoV, BNoV, BVDV, BToVand E. coli. In addition, 402 fecal specimens from the 401 herds that tested negative for unclassified BECs tested positive for other enteric pathogens. No enteric pathogens were detected in the 184 fecal samples from 171 herds. The reported fecal prevalence of the BECs in calf diarrhea ranged from 8.4% in the UK (Oliver et al., 2006) to 28.0% in the US (Smiley et al., 2003) . These results suggest that BEC infections are endemic in diarrheic calves in South Korea in a similar manner to the prevalence of BEC infections in the UK (Oliver et al., 2006) . Seasonally, BEC infections were less prevalent in diarrheic fecal samples of calves obtained in spring than in the other seasons; 30 (7.4%) out of 407 fecal samples (Kumar et al., 2004) . The names of the viruses used are listed in Table 1. BEC infections and to establish BEC surveillance programs to prevent BEC infections. Molecular analysis was performed by sequencing 194 nt of the nt 5698 to nt 6454 region of the RdRp gene from 16 BECs, which were sequenced from the 59 positive samples for the RdRp region by nested PCR. The paired comparisons of these viruses revealed the nt and aa sequences of the Korean viruses RdRp gene to be more homologous to each other (96.4-100% nt and 95.3-100% aa) and more closely related to the NB-like viruses (80.9-88.1% nt and 84.5-98.4% aa) than to the NA1-like viruses (75.8-78.4% nt and 79.7-82.8% aa) ( Table 2 ). Phylogenetic analysis of the nt sequences of the partial RdRp gene from the unclassified BECs also revealed the 16 Korean RdRp gene to cluster together and closely in a branch with the NB-like strains, particularly with the PenrithC39 and Starcross93 strains (Fig. 1) . The NA1-like viruses including the NA1, Penrith142, Starcross117, Penrith151, Pen-rith143 and Penrith150 strains clustered on a separate major branch (Fig. 1) . These results suggest that the Korean BECs are closely related to NB-like but distantly related to the NA1-like viruses. A previous study reported that unclassified BECs can be divided into two potential genotypes, NA1-like and NB-like, according to phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp gene (Oliver et al., 2006) . It was reported that both genotypes are circulating in the UK but the US has only NB-like viruses (Oliver et al., 2006) . The genetic similarity of the Korean BECs to NB-like viruses from the US can be explained by the fact that from the 1960s, South Korea imports live cows mainly from countries in North American and Oceania, not from European countries. However, the possibility of NA1like virus infections in South Korea, even with a very low infection status, cannot be excluded. Therefore, continuous monitoring and intensive study of the BECs with a larger number of bovine fecal samples will be needed. The RT-PCR assay with the primer pair specific to the whole capsid gene (1692 nt of the nt 5035 to nt 6726) carried out using the 59 fecal samples testing positive to the RdRp gene by nested PCR. Among the positive amplicons, 12 amplicons that had been amplified strongly by RT-PCR were selected and Fig. 2 . The nucleotide identity plot of the Newbury1 and all Korean unclassified bovine calicivirus strains was generated in comparison with the Nebraska strain using Simplot with a 200-nucleotide window moving along in 20 nucleotide steps. The capsid gene was divided into the S (white box), P1A and P1B (gray box) and P2 (black box) domains (Chen et al., 2004). sequenced. The Korean viruses shared high nt and aa identity with both NB-like (86.8-87.7% nt and 92.9-93.8 aa) and NA1-like (85.7-86.7% nt and 92.3-93.3% aa) viruses for the entire capsid gene (Table 2 ). In the S domain, which is the most conserved region in the capsid gene (Green et al., 2001) , the Korean viruses showed high nt and aa identity with both NB-like (92.9-93.9% nt and 98.2-99.1% aa) and NA1-like (93.1-94.0% nt and 97.7-98.6% aa) viruses (Table 3) . However, the Korean BECs had lower nt and aa identity with the NB (76.9-78.1% nt and 82.2-84.0% aa) and NA1 (75.3-76.7% nt and 81.7-82.8% aa) viruses in the P2 domain, which is the putative receptor binding and the most hypervariable region in the capsid gene (Green et al., 2001) (Table 3 ). The SimPlot results were equivalent to those of the nt and aa identities of each domain of the capsid gene, where (Chen et al., 2004) . Fig. 3 . The phylogenetic trees of the nucleotide sequences of the entire capsid gene of the caliciviruses were constructed using the neighbor-joining method of Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Ana-lysis (Kumar et al., 2004) . The names of viruses used are listed in Table 1. the most hypervariable region was observed in the P2 region (Fig. 2) . In addition, an analysis of the nt and aa sequences of the Korean BEC capsid as a whole, S and P regions were more homologous to each other (Fig. 2) . Unlike the phylogenetic data of RdRp region, the phylogenetic tree of the nt sequences of the whole capsid gene did not show any characteristic clustering to the NB-like or NA1-like viruses. Moreover, all Korean BECs clustered on a separate branch. The NB-like and NA1-like viruses were on a different branch (Fig. 3) . In addition, the Korean BECs in the phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp and capsid genes clustered together, and the other known BECs clustered on a separate branch. In contrast to genotyping by the RdRp gene, it was reported that there are no capsid genotypes (Oliver et al., 2006) . Therefore, this data can support the above suggestion (Oliver et al., 2006) and suggests that the Korean BECs may have a distinct evolutionary pathway from the NB-and NA1-like BECs. In summary, unclassified BEC infections are endemic in diarrheic calves in South Korea. The infecting strains are genetically closer to NB-like viruses but may have a distinct evolutionary pathway from the NB-and NA1-like BECs.
