The cytotoxicity and cytopathic reduction (CPE) effects of natural anthraquinone 1 and 2 and derivatives 3-7 (Fig. 4) together with a penta-acetyl sugar, were evaluated. None of the quinones and pentaacetyl sugar showed a significant cytotoxic effects (CC 50 > 90 μM) in MDCK cells, indicating 100% cell viability at all the concentrations tested. We then assessed CPE reduction, as observed in Table 1 , compound 2 showed weak CPE reduction (IC 50 = 62.31 μM) with the susceptible strain, with IC 50 values similar to those presented by compound 5 with the resistant strain. In contrast, compound 7
