To the Editor, Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are a great threat to public health worldwide. Around 60%-80% of human EIDs originate from wildlife, the typical examples being influenza, coronavirus and henipavirus-related lethal neurologic and respiratory diseases that originated from wild animals and bats, respectively (Hu et al., 2017; Su et al., 2017 Su et al., , 2016 . Pigs act as "mixing vessels" since they are susceptible to viral infections of wild animal species and can transmit zoonotic diseases to humans (Zhou et al., 2019) . In addition, the high-density farming and international trade within the pig industry increases the risk of transmission and global spread (He et al., 2019b; Morilla Gonz√°Lez et al., 2003) . Indeed, contact between pigs and humans was an important factor for the emergence of pandemic influenza virus and Ebola-Reston virus, among others (Horimoto and Kawaoka, 2005; Morris, 2009) . Considering the broad spectrum of viruses to which pigs are susceptible and the number of pathogens currently identified in pig, it is essential to understand the factors determining the emergence and evolution of these pathogens. Circoviruses (family Circoviridae, genus Circovirus) are the smallest known autonomously replicating viruses. Their genomes consist of a circular, single stranded DNA molecule with two open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the REP and CAP proteins using an ambisense strategy (Cao et al., 2015; He et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2018; Palinski et al., 2016) . Although they were originally described in avian species, numerous members have been characterized in fish, insects and mammals (Garigliany et al., 2015; Li et al., 2010) . Until now, three species of circovirus are known to infect pigs including, porcine circovirus (PCV) 1, PCV2 and the novel PCV3 (Li et al., 2018a (Li et al., , 2018b (Li et al., , 2018c Palinski et al., 2017) . The diversity of circoviruses and its association with multiple vertebrate hosts represents an important model for understanding how viruses emerge and establish themselves in pig hosts.
