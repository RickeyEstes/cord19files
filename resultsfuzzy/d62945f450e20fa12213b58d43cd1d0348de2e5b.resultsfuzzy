As the proportion of unique sequences in an outbreak can be determined without knowledge of the transmission tree, we used this metric to compare our predictions with empirical estimates from studies collecting WGS in an outbreak setting (Fig 1B, S6 Table) . The proportion of unique sequences observed in M. tuberculosis, Influenza A, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks were well predicted by one or both evolutionary models. The phybreak model better predicted the observed genetic diversity for both M. tuberculosis outbreaks and the SARS-CoV outbreak, the latter of which fell outside the prediction interval of the outbreaker model, whereas the diversity observed in the Influenza A and MERS-CoV outbreaks was similarly supported by both models. Outbreaks were simulated using both the outbreaker and phybreak models. B) For each simulated outbreak, we calculated the proportion of sequences that were unique. Black circles represent empirical observations of the proportion of unique sequences for a given outbreak (S6 Table) , scaled by the size of the outbreak. The grey circle in the EBOV column represents the weighted mean across the four outbreaks. The violin plots with the dotted outlines in the K. pneumoniae column were generated using the empirical serial interval of 25.8 days observed over the course of the outbreak described by Snitkin et al. [106] , which differs significantly from the value of 62.7 days in our literature review. The mean proportion of unique sequences observed across four EBOV outbreaks was also in good agreement with our simulations, with slightly greater support by the outbreaker model. However, diversity between these outbreaks was more variable than expected, ranging from 0.40 to 0.92, with one value falling outside both prediction intervals and two values only expected under either the phybreak or outbreaker model. Furthermore, though the genetic diversity observed across 333 cases of C. difficile infection in Oxfordshire, UK [17] fell just within the prediction interval of our simulations, this result was unlikely under both evolutionary models, especially given the large sample size of the study. The greatest disagreement with our predictions was observed for a K. pneumoniae outbreak described by Snitkin et al. [106] , for which 7 out of 18 WGS were identical, while our simulations predicted nearly all cases to be genetically distinguishable. However, the average serial interval over this outbreak was only 25.8 days (S6 Table) , which was unusually short compared to the average value of 62.7 days from our literature review. When repeating our simulations using the realised serial interval, the observed genetic diversity was well predicted by the phybreak model (Fig 2B) .
