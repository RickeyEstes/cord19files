Odds ratios (ORs), case-fatality rates (CFRs), absolute differences in CFRs, and difference in means were calculated as summary statistics with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Study characteristics and outcome measures were tabulated. A recognized framework for narrative synthesis was adopted [15] . Because of potential concerns with clinical heterogeneity, analyses were stratified by viral etiology for each research question in accordance with the protocol [11] . An exploratory, post hoc, random-effects-model metaanalysis was conducted to describe the pooled OR of mortality, irrespective of SARI etiology, following treatment with convalescent plasma or serum, using the odds after receipt of placebo or no therapy as a reference. Results were adjusted by adding 0.5 to each cell of the contingency table when no deaths occurred in the exposed group in individual studies [12] . Meta-analysis of crude CFRs, using a random-effects model, was undertaken. Statistical heterogeneity was ascertained using the I 2 statistic, and meta-analyses were abandoned when this reached 85% [16] . Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to investigate the impact of excluding studies with â‰¤5 patients in the exposed group. Publication bias was assessed through construction of funnel plots and by use of the Egger test. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata software, version 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX), except for meta-analysis of pooled proportions, for which we used StatsDirect software, version 2.8.0 (StatsDirect, Altrincham, United Kingdom). Statistical significance was assumed at the 5% level.
