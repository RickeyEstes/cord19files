3.1. Overall structure (Fig. 1) The wild-type human Ap4A hydrolase crystallized with four monomers in the asymmetric unit and there was no evidence of higher order oligomeric assemblies in the crystal lattice, which was consistent with the purification of the enzyme as a monomer by size-exclusion chromatography (data not shown). The E58A mutant crystallized with two monomers which interacted to form a dimer through crystallographic packing. However, the mutant Ap4A hydrolase also exists as a monomeric form in solution as determined by gel filtration chromatography. The structures of all monomers from the three models are structurally similar, with RMSD (root mean square deviations) ranged from 0.14 Å to 0.41 Å for main chain atoms. Similar to the canonical Nudix fold, the human Ap 4 A hydrolase monomer shows the common aba-sandwich architecture. This contains three a-helices (a1-a3), two b sheets (composed of seven b-strands b1-b7) and loops (L1-L7). The central feature is a curved four-stranded mixed b sheet spacially arranged in the order b4b1b6b5 from left to right when facing a1. This part is sandwiched between two antiparallel a-helices (a2, a3) and a1 (roughly perpendicular to a3). There is also one short 3 10 -helix (g1) in connecting peptides between loop L5 and b5. Fig. 2A) The conserved Nudix sequence motif (GX 5 EX 7 REUXEEXGU) is located mainly on a loop-helix-loop region (residues 43-65) as found in other known homologous structures. This segment is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds among conserved residues. At the N-terminus of the motif, hydrogen bonds from Glu49 to Glu46 and Arg57 clamp the helix a1 to loop L4. The first residue of the Nudix motif, Gly43, is on b4 and anchored by intrasheet hydrogen bonds to Cys6 of b1. Arg57, a conserved residue in the Nudix hydrolases, is involved in salt links with Glu49 and Glu58.
