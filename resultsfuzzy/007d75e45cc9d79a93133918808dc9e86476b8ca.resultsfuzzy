The following theorem shows that model (2.1) is biologically and mathematically well posed. Proof. The vector field defined by (2.1) and (2.2) is Lipschitzian in each compact set in R 2 p + , so the initial value problem has a unique solution for all t ≥ 0 as long as the boundedness of solutions holds [14] . Suppose there exist proper subsets P 1 , P 2 of P and t 0 ≥ 0 such that I i (t 0 ) = 0 for i ∈ P 1 and I i ( t 0 ) = 0 for i ∈ P 2 . From (2.1) and irreducibility of ( g ij ), we have for some i ∈ P 1 , which implies that I i is an increasing function of t at t 0 . Note that the state without any infectious individual will not change in any one I i . Thus, I i remains nonnegative for each i ∈ P . Suppose there is one of the first S i 0 (t 1 ) = 0 for , non-negativity of each I i and irreducibility of the matrix ( f ij ), Denoting the total population of the system by By a comparison theorem, the total population Then the positive invariance and global attractivity of G are proved by the method in [3] . In order to verify that the model (2.1) is equipped with disease-free equilibrium (DFE), we consider with initial value S i (0) > 0 for i ∈ P . In [3] , the disease-free subsystem of an epidemic model was studied by using the strongly sub-linearity property. In fact, the disease-free subsystem (3.1) obey this property due to the adaption on dispersal rates. Hence, we study (3.1) by using the theory of monotone dynamical systems [15] . Indeed, the following result reveals that model (2.1) always admits a unique DFE, labeled by E 0 = (S 0 We used the proposed model to investigate the influence of media coverage among spatially distinct patches of habitat by adapting dispersal rates. Our results showed that the basic reproduction number R 0 was a threshold parameter of disease spread. Specifically, the epidemic model either has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium when R 0 < 1 , or a globally asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium when R 0 > 1 , if the disease mildly influences the dispersal of infectious individuals, and if the disease rarely induces death. In [7, 8] , media coverage was assumed to affect only the interactions of the local population through the incidence rate, and did not play a role in R 0 because the basic reproduction number was evaluated in the absence of disease. By contrast, from (3.2) and (3.3) , the assumption in our model on media-induced adaption effects on dispersal affects this threshold value for predicting disease outbreak. In addition to theoretically determining the convergence dynamics under certain cri- study. In addition to the SIS model with contagious transmission, adaptive dispersal can be considered in other epidemic models, including noncontagious diseases such as vector-host models.
