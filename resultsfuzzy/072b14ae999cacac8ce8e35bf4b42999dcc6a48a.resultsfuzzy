Trypan blue dye staining and MTT assay were utilized to investigate the effect of p17 on cell growth. Equal amounts of control vector pcDNA3.1(À) or p17-pcDNA3.1(À) were transfected into Vero, BHK, 293, and HeLa cells. These cells were then cultured in MEM containing various concentrations of fetal bovine serum at indicated time period. Next, we compared the viable cell number and cell proliferation rate of p17-expressing cells with those of vector transfected cells. Trypan blue day exclusion assay revealed that the viable cell number was reduced in p17-expressing cells as compared with vector transfected cells. The significant difference was observed at 24 and 48 h incubation. The interesting aspect is that the p17-mediated effect was more clear when cells were cultured in lower serum (1% and 0.1%) condition ( Fig. 2A) . The doubling time of each experiment was calculated and is shown (Fig. 2A) . The p17 expression increased the doubling time significantly as compared with vector transfected cells. By using an alternative MTT assay to evaluate the cell proliferation rate, the same growth inhibition pattern of p17 was observed (Fig. 2B, upper) . To further confirm that this growth inhibition activity of p17 was specific, we transfected sigma C-pcDNA3.1(À) plasmid into cells. The sigma C expression was demonstrated in our previous study [23] . The presence of sigma C did not alter the cell proliferation rate (Fig. 2B, lower) . The p17 inhibits cell growth activity that was not dependent on host cell type, since this protein also exhibited a growth retardation activity in BHK, 293, and HeLa cells (data not shown).
