As in any compartmental disease transmission model (Brauer et al., 2008) , we divide the total population in a migrants' home village (with size N(t)) into three disjoint classes of individuals: namely, susceptible, infectious and recovered, with class sizes denoted by S(t), I(t) and R(t), respectively. It is assumed that recruitment into the susceptible class is at a constant rate L. Let b be the transmission coefficient, m S ,m I ,m R be the natural death rates for susceptible, infectious and recovered individuals, respectively, and g be the rate at which infectious individuals recover. Let d denote the death rate of migrants, and let m S and m R denote the rates at which susceptible and recovered individuals migrate, respectively. Let t be the average time a migrant worker spends working away from home. It is also assumed that infectious individuals do not migrate. The flow diagram of our model is presented in Fig. 1 . Assume that recovered individuals have permanent immunity. Let pðtÞ denote the probability that a susceptible migrant worker returns home with an infection. Throughout, we assume that pðtÞ is either a constant or satisfies the assumption (H): p : ½0, þ1Þ-½0; 1Þ is nondecreasing and continuous. For example, we may take pðtÞ ¼ 10t=ð1000 þ tÞ. Assume that the force of infection is given by mass action, which is appropriate since the population in a village is relatively small (McCallum et al., 2001) . Then the model is governed by the following system of delay differential equations: S 0 ðtÞ ¼ LÀm S SðtÞÀbSðtÞIðtÞÀm S SðtÞþð1ÀpÞm S e Àdt SðtÀtÞ, I 0 ðtÞ ¼ bSðtÞIðtÞÀgIðtÞÀm I IðtÞþpm S e Àdt SðtÀtÞ, R 0 ðtÞ ¼ gIðtÞÀm R RðtÞÀm R RðtÞþm R e Àdt RðtÀtÞ: ð2:1Þ The associated initial conditions are SðyÞ ¼ jðyÞZ0 for yA½Àt,0, Ið0Þ 4 0 and RðyÞ Z 0 for yA½Àt,0. As the variable R does not appear in the first two equations, we can just consider the first two equations S 0 ðtÞ ¼ LÀm S SðtÞÀbSðtÞIðtÞÀm S SðtÞþð1ÀpÞm S e Àdt SðtÀtÞ, I 0 ðtÞ ¼ bSðtÞIðtÞÀgIðtÞÀm I IðtÞþpm S e Àdt SðtÀtÞ, with their associated initial conditions. Our main results are given in the following theorem with the proofs postponed to the Appendix. Theorem 2.1. Consider model (2.2) with the associated initial conditions. The model is well posed, i.e., there is a unique solution ðSðtÞ,IðtÞÞ which exists globally, and S(t) and I(t) are positive and bounded for all t 40. There exists a unique positive equilibrium, then the equilibrium E is globally asymptotically stable. ( Remark 2.1. The above theorem implies that the disease always persists and the number of infectious individuals stabilizes at a constant level I n as long as the probability of migrant workers returning home with an infection is not zero.
