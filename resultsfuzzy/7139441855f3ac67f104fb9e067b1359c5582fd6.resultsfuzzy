A number of the amino acid changes in the spike protein have been hypothesized to be involved in virulence or tissue tropism of the virus [14] . In particular, amino acid change from Ser in the UP group to Ala in the P group was observed at amino acid 769 which is directly adjacent to the spike protein proteolytic cleavage site. A serine at this site has been hypothesized to be associated with cell fusion [37] , and our data indicate loss of the serine is associated with gain of the positively-charged insert in the S2 subunit of the spike protein. Another region immediately upstream of the insert (899-907) has been suggested to be a fusogenic domain by Parker et al. [22] . Interestingly there is a nonconservative amino acid change in this sequence from a nonpolar amino acid, Ala in Parker et al. (1990) and Gly in Chouljenko et al. (1998) and P group, to an acidic amino acid, Asp, in our UP group. This region is composed almost entirely of nonpolar amino acids and the addition of a charged residue may influence function. Another mutation occurred at amino acid 1030 which is part of the heptad repeat, a domain associated with class I fusion proteins and host range [39] , in this case a Gly in the UP group was replaced with an Asp in the P group. Ultimately, the role of these mutations in viral phenotype will need to be confirmed using reverse genetics. Using high throughput sequencing, we tracked the evolution of variant genotypes over several passages through cell lines. The identification of variants through deep sequencing of multiple BCoV samples points to the RNA virus' relatively high mutation rate. However, the majority of the identified variants were detected in relatively low abundance, leaving open the question of their functional significance. Comparing consensus point mutations with their variant counterparts was used as a way to find variants with greater potential for functional significance. Our results showed that rather than de novo mutation being the driver of genetic change at the consensus population level, selection of preexisting mutations was evident in the majority of cases. Presumably with a sufficiently large population size and extended evolution, novel mutation becomes a bigger factor. The results here illustrate that introduction of novel mutations is a non-trivial process. Moreover, the results indicate the importance of identifying the variants in the population as a potential key piece of information in assessing how a viral isolate would most likely adapt genetically to a new host environment.
