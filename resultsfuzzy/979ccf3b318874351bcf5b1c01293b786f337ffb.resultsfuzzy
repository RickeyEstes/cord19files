Proper interpretation of microbial forensic evidence is imperative for establishing confidence, to withstand the scrutiny of the legal system and for making critical policy or response decisions. Microbial forensics, much like human forensic DNA interpretation, can support the conviction or exoneration of an individual. However, more dire consequences can occur or be prevented based in part on a microbial forensic result. In the case of a bioterror attack, attribution to a particular government or sovereign entity could result in diminished diplomatic relations or military retaliation. Therefore, proper guidelines, validations and quality assurance, and statistical support need to be in place for microbial forensic evidence interpretation. Microbial forensic analyses typically rely on the comparison of evidentiary samples to a known reference sample(s) or other evidentiary item. The three general types of interpretation, include: inclusion; exclusion; or inconclusive. An inclusion, or association, is stated when the evidentiary profile matches, or is highly similar, to the comparative profile. In microbial forensics an inclusion also can mean that the microorganism from the evidentiary sample and comparative microorganism share a recent common ancestor. An exclusion is stated when the profiles are sufficiently dissimilar such that they cannot have originated from the same common ancestor or from the same source. An inconclusive is stated when there is insufficient information to render an interpretation. When an interpretation of an association is made, a statistical assessment or weight is assigned to this interpretation. These results are combined with other metadata to determine whether there is support, for example, of an intentional attack and that a particular person or persons are the perpetrator. When associations are made between an evidence and reference sample the significance of the weight of the results must be properly stated. Currently there are no standard interpretation guidelines for microbial forensic evidence. However, some recommendations have been made. Although standard interpretation guidelines are lacking in the microbial forensics field, phylogenetic analyses have supported associations and have successfully been admitted as evidence in legal criminal proceedings in the United States and abroad Bhattacharya, 2014 . Reconstructing phylogenies has been used as a microbial forensic tool to convict individuals in cases of intentional infection with RNA viruses González-Candelas et al., 2013; Metzker et al., 2002; Sajantila, 2014; Scaduto et al., 2010 . A well-known case in which phylogenetic analyses supported an investigation in a criminal matter was in the seconddegree attempted murder case in which Dr. Richard J. Schmidt was accused of intentionally injecting his girlfriend, Janice Trahan, with HIV Metzker et al., 2002 . On August 4, 1994 Schmidt allegedly injected his girlfriend with a mixture of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) tainted blood from two of his patients Metzker et al., 2002 . Subsequently, Janice Trahan was diagnosed with HIV Metzker et al., 2002 . An investigation occurred and sequence data of two genes (gp120 and RT ) were generated from samples from the HIV-positive patient, Janice Trahan, and a local population of HIV-positive patients (about 30 control samples and 2 database samples) Metzker et al., 2002 . Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the HIV variants between the patient and the victim were more similar than those from the local population Metzker et al., 2002 . This evidence was used in the conviction of Dr. Schmidt Metzker et al., 2002 . Phylogenetic analysis also was used in the investigation and submitted as evidence in the case of a Spanish anesthetist, Juan Maeso, who allegedly infected 275 of his patients with HCV by injecting himself with some of the patients' morphine prior to administering the drug to patients using the same needle Bhattacharya, 2014; González-Candelas et al., 2013 . In February 1998 HCV outbreak was investigated and led to the association of hundreds of cases linked to two hospitals where Maeso worked González-Candelas et al., 2013 . Sequence data were generated from two genes (NS5B and E1-E2) from 322 patients and 44 local controls González-Candelas et al., 2013 . These data led to the exclusion of 47 patients from the outbreak strain and association of 275 patients infected by Maeso González-Candelas et al., 2013 . Maeso was convicted of professional malpractice González-Candelas et al., 2013 . This case differed from other cases using phylogenetic analysis since this case spanned a longer time frame, nearly 25 years, and involved many victims; as such, a molecular clock analysis was used to infer the time of infection of some of the patients González-Candelas et al., 2013; Sajantila, 2014 . These accounts of phylogenetic analysis and use of models, such as the molecular clock analysis, will provide insight into best practices of interpretation that should be considered for assessing statistical significance. Endemicity can play a large role in microbial forensic investigations for weighing the probability of the presence of a microorganism being due to a natural or intentional outbreak. The lack of endemic data played a key role in the difficult response of a partial positive result for Francisella tularensis (a NIAID Priority Pathogen and select agent) from routine sampling in the BioWatch program in Washington, DC in Eshoo et al., 2011 . On September 24-25, 2005 partial positive results for a low-level signal of F. tularensis were reported from routine air sampling in the Capital Mall area of Washington, DC Eshoo et al., 2011 . This detection occurred during the time of an antiwar protest, attended by a large number of people Eshoo et al., 2011 . F. tularensis, a highly infectious bacterium, is a naturally occurring microorganism endemic to many areas and has been found in samples such as air, water, and soil Barns et al., 2005; Kuske et al., 2006 . Shortly after the partial positive result, the CDC issued a health advisory to inform public health officials and individuals of potential exposure; however, no infections were reported Eshoo et al., 2011 . It is more likely that the large movements of the protestors stirred up natural dust and excrement from the ground that contained endemic F. tularensis as opposed to the result of an intentional bioattack. Endemic data assist in source tracing of microorganisms and to trace the origin of a particular microorganism, especially in the case of a disease outbreak. In 2010 following the Haitian earthquake, there was an outbreak of cholera, a disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, resulting in more than 470,000 cases and more than 6,600 deaths by 2011 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011. Source tracing of the V. cholerae strain, using MPS to sequence clinical isolates, determined the origin to be a strain from South East Asia Chin et al., 2011; Hasan et al., 2012 , specifically Nepal Hendriksen et al., 2011 introduced by human activity such as humanitarian aid in response to the earthquake. Source tracing also can be used to investigate microbial contaminants to provide associations or indication of intentional or accidental contamination aiding in microbial forensic investigations. For example, in 2009 multiple cases of injectional anthrax were diagnosed among heroin users in Scotland Price et al., 2012 . B. anthracis is not endemic to Scotland Price et al., 2012 . The source of the infection was believed to be a batch of heroin Price et al., 2012 . Canonical SNP genotyping and WGSS were used to determine the strain and origin of the B. anthracis spores, which were likely introduced in Turkey or surrounding areas Price et al., 2012 . This source tracing method indicated likely contamination from an endemic source, possibly from using an animal-derived cutting agent and determined the likely drug trafficking route that was used to smuggle the drugs into Europe Price et al., 2012. Microbial contamination was a potential signature in the 2001 Amerithrax case. Some of the letters contained a contaminant of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, a non-pathogenic near-neighbor of B. anthracis National Research Council, 2011. Although, this contamination of B. subtilis did not provide any additional investigative lead value in the Amerithrax investigation, it was noted by the NAS (National Academy of Sciences) Review of the FBI's investigation that such co-cultured contaminants could be considered endemics of an area or of a laboratory and could be invaluable evidence in future cases National Research Council, 2011, to trace the origin of the biothreat producer or to trace routes of dissemination. Knowing the types of strains and the geographic areas they reside helped in determining that the Ames strain is not a common endemic in the United States and indicated a likely source would be laboratories. The Ames strain was used for research and a number of laboratories had access and housed stock cultures of this strain Keim et al., 2011. Databases are an essential tool in microbial forensics. Microbial forensic interpretations require the comparison of evidentiary genetic data to fully characterized references comprised in databases. Databases must be as inclusive as possible and contain as many strains of a particular species as possible, in addition to near-neighbors and other microorganisms representative of a wide range of phylogenetic diversity. Population genetic data within databases can be analyzed to provide information for unique markers for genetic typing for assay development and other data such as mutation rates and diversity. In addition to genetic data, databases must contain associated metadata. Metadata are the information associated with a given sample such as collection site location, date of collection, tissue source, virulence, extraction and sequencing methods, assembly and annotation methods, etc., which can be used to determine endemicity and other information associated with quality control of data. Metadata are essential to epidemiological investigations providing information to aid in source tracing and therapeutics and essential to microbial forensic investigations providing invaluable supplementary information of investigative value. Since the majority of microbial diversity is unknown, current databases may not represent the true range of diversity that exists and programs have been initiated to sequence more reference genomes Wu et al., 2009 . However, in microbial forensics the focus is on microbes that are particularly infectious and/or pathogenic and many representatives have been sequenced and with continued improvements in MPS, the number of microbial genomes that will be available will also increase. For example, the HMP (Human Microbiome Project) Consortium initiated the task to sequence new reference genomes for enhancing interpretation of health vs disease-state microbiomes Human Microbiome Jumpstart Reference Strains Consortium, 2010, and the 100K Foodborne Pathogen Genome Project seeks to sequence 100,000 different food-borne pathogens to help with epidemiological investigations UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, 2014. More inclusive databases with reference sequences of forensic relevance can help improve source tracing efforts and phylogenetic reconstructions to determine disease transmission in biocrime and other biothreat cases. Databases constructed for biosecurity purposes must be systematically curated, have high quality genome sequences and the number and quality of draft genomes included must be properly vetted. Recommendations and guidelines also must be in place for metadata, including security-related regulations Sjödin et al., 2013 . International databases would improve the capability of determining strain level attribution and source tracking Yang & Keim, 2012; however, international databases likely will not come to fruition as it requires countries to share information that they may regard part of their own national security or may not want to release as outbreaks can have serious economic consequences.
