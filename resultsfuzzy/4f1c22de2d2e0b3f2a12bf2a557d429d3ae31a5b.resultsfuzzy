In total, 15 guano samples (7.9 %) tested positive for the presence of AstVs, without difference between sampling location along the transect (χ 2 = 10.5; P = 0.31). Significant differences in the number of positive samples between sampling dates were detected (χ 2 = 46.7; P < 0.001), with AstVs mostly detected after the parturition period (late December), in February and March, when the cave was occupied by juveniles ( Figure 1 ). This pattern suggests a potential effect of the population age structure (Mendenhall et al., 2017) rather than changes in size and density associated to the formation of the colony (Drexler et al., 2011)
