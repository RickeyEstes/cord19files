The analysis was performed with open source R software packages (http://www.r-project.org/ and http://www.BioConductor.org/). Gene expression was quantified with the array package using print tip group lowess normalization without background subtraction. The resulting measures of expression for each array are the log2 ratios (M values) and the average log2 intensities (A value) of Cy3 and Cy5 signals. Statistics of differential expression between the different groups of samples were calculated with a linear model fitted by the limma package. Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy mini kit following the manufacturer's protocol for adherent cells in the case of CHO cell cultures. For the isolation of total RNA from brain tissue, the TRIzol reagent was used as described in the human samples section. RNA was dissolved in water, which was followed by ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, USA) quantification and pico chip quality control analysis (6000 Nanochip assay Agilent Technologies, Meno Park, USA). Results were analyzed by the DDCt method [90] and significance was calculated via students t-test. b-actin was used a normalizer to determine DCts. DDCts were calculated against the mean of DAPT treated WT-CHO DCts or the mean of healthy human brain cortex DCts. Results were expressed as relative quantification by 2Ë†-(DDCt) [90] .
