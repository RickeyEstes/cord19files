In summer 2007, an outbreak of chikungunya fever affected the Italian provinces of Ravenna, Cesena-Forli, Rimini and Bologna [1, [42] [43] [44] . Health authorities identified 214 laboratory-confirmed cases with date of onset from July 15 to September 28 2007. Most cases (161) occurred in the two neighboring villages of Castiglione di Cervia and Castiglione di Ravenna, but five smaller clusters of local transmission were also detected in five towns in the same region (i.e., Cervia, Cesena, Ravenna, Rimini, and Bologna) which are located 9 to 75 km from the initially affected villages [1, [42] [43] [44] , see Fig. 3 . Model M was parametrized to describe epidemic spread only in Castiglione di Cervia and Castiglione di Ravenna. Daily estimates of the number of vectors over time N v were obtained by the vector dynamics model. The ratio of mosquitoes to humans was estimated to be in the range of 10-35 during the peak mosquito activity (Fig. S3 show the predicted dynamics of the vector for different numbers of breeding sites B). By fitting model M to notification data up to August 23 (the day before intervention) and by assuming B = 200 ha {1 we estimated k to be 0.09 days {1 (95% CI 0.05-0.16 days {1 , see Fig. 4b ). We recall that the explored range for k through the LHS procedure was Â½0,1. Good fit to data were obtained for values in the entire range explored for all the other model parameters (see Fig. S4 ). x h Human susceptibility to infections 50%-80% [58] p s Symptomatic ratio 82% [18] p n Notification ratio 54% [18] 1=v v Latent period in mosquitoes 2-3 days [26, 58] x v Mosquito susceptibility to infections 70%-100% [62] doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0018860.t003 The uncertainty of k depends on the uncertainty of all model parameters. Unfortunately, no field data are available for the study area to validate these results. In [37] , plausible values for the biting rate and the ratio of mosquitoes to humans in Europe are considered to be k~0:25 days {1 and N v =N h~2 0 (based on published and non published data, e.g. [10] ). However, we acknowledge that it might be misleading to compare these results with others carried out in other localities. In fact, abundance and biting rate of Aedes Albopictus are strongly affected by abiotic factors, both climatic and environmental (e.g. presence of other hosts). Estimates of the biting rate and its uncertainty allowed us to estimate R 0 and its uncertainty from Eq. (8). Besides parameters more strictly related to the infectious process, R 0 is an increasing function of the square of k, as the biting rate controls transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans, and the ratio of vectors to humans N v =N h (see Fig. S5 ). However, it should be considered that Eq. (8) depends on the number of vectors N v which substantially varies over time as a results of seasonal meteorological factors. Thus, as for models explicitly considering seasonal variations in transmission, it is difficult to precisely define R 0 . Therefore, we computed R 0 by considering the average value of N v from June 21 to July 26 2007 (i.e. the initial phase of the epidemic), as predicted by the vector dynamics model. We estimated R 0 to be 3.3 on average (95% CI 1.8-6, see Fig. 4e ). Fig. 4d shows that R VH 0 is below the critical threshold for all vales of B and thus the epidemic is mainly determined by R HV 0 , i.e. by transmission from humans to vectors. As for the effective reproduction number R e (i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated per primary case at a given time), which accounts for both depletion of susceptible individuals and mosquito dynamics, its value over time is shown in Fig. 4c and Fig. 4f (by considering or not interventions) . It emerges that R e , which does not change much by varying the number of breeding sites, can vary substantially over time as an effect of mosquito dynamics. This suggests that R 0 could have been even larger, depending on the time of epidemic seeding. Recently, it has been demonstrated using mathematical modeling in the context of dengue that it is possible to generate outbreaks even in cases when R 0 v1 provided that the vector-tohuman component of R 0 is greater than one and that a certain number of infected vectors are introduced into the affected population [45] . However, it has been demonstrated that the index case was a man of Indian origin from Kerala living in Castiglione di Cervia, without history of traveling during the previous year [1] . He only reported contact with a relative of his, who had arrived in Italy on June 21 2007 from Kerala, India (a region of India affected by the CHIKV epidemic), and visited him (see Eq. 6 and 7). e As a but for the basic reproduction number. f As c but by assuming reference interventions, resulting in the following reductions: 40% as for breeding sites and eggs, 90% as for larvae and 95% as for adults. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0018860.g004 in Castiglione di Cervia village on June 23, while feverish. Therefore, having the human index case being identified, we can reasonably exclude the contemporaneous introduction of infected vectors in the two villages. Moreover, our estimates show that R VH 0 is well below the critical threshold. As several cases were reported in Italy among travelers returning from endemic areas [46] (only one, however, in the study area; additional imported cases throughout the duration of the outbreaks were not detected), the question arises why no previous outbreaks of CHIKV occurred in other Italian regions. By assuming B = 200 ha {1 , we estimated the probability p (see Eq. 9) that a major outbreak of the disease would occur after the introduction of a single infective host to be 0.59 (95% CI 0.35-0.76, see Fig. S5 ) and, by assuming the same density of mosquitoes, epidemic outbreaks are more likely in rural areas with respect to urban areas -as the human population density is much lower in the former. This could explain why cities like Cesena (96,000 inhabitants), Rimini (141,000 inhabitants) and Bologna (377,000 inhabitants) and Ravenna (157,000 inhabitants) located in the same region of the two most affected villages did not experience any epidemic outbreak, though sporadic CHIKV cases were recorded in the same period [1, [42] [43] [44] . These results support the hypothesis that outbreaks of Chikungunya virus in those temperate climate countries characterized by high density of Aedes albopictus are probable after the importation of an index case from abroad. The potential epidemic trajectory in the absence of interventions by assuming B~200 ha {1 is shown in Fig. 5a . The resulting cumulative attack rate (i.e., the percentage of symptomatic cases in the population at the end of the epidemic) was estimated to be 73.4% of the population (95% CI 57.8%-81.5%, see also Fig. 5b) . Results do not change much by varying B (B = 50 ha {1 : 74%, 95% CI 55.3%-81.6%, see also Fig. S6 ; B = 100 ha {1 : 73:9%, 95% CI 55.8%-81.5%; B = 150 ha {1 : 75%, 95% CI 57.3%-81.3%). Much lower prevalence values have been estimated in La Reunion Island and in Mayotte, namely 38.2% and 37.2% respectively. However, these estimates are hardly comparable with our model predictions as these territories have benefited from high resource allocation to mitigate the epidemic [19] . As for the undertaken interventions, breeding sites and eggs were removed on August 23 2007, larvicides were used on August 23 (effect lasting 30 days), and adulticides were used from August 23 to August 25 2007. Through model simulations, we evaluated the effects of strategies mimicking the timing of the actual interventions undertaken in Italy. As for the effects in terms of reduction of breeding sites, eggs, larvae and adults, likely values Figure 5 .

We discuss first results obtained by assuming 40% as for reduction of breeding sites and eggs, 90% as for reduction of larvae and 95% as for reduction of adults. The effects of such an intervention are shown in Fig. 5c . The resulting cumulative attack rate, by assuming B~200 ha {1 , was estimated to be 8.7% (95% CI 5.6%-12.7%, see Fig. 5d ), in good agreement with the observed value, namely 8.4%, computed by multiplying the overall observed prevalence, 10.2% [18] , by the symptomatic ratio p s~0 :82 [18] . Results are similar for other choices of B (for instance, for B = 50 ha {1 the figure becomes 8:5%, 95% CI 5.3%-13%; see also Fig. S6 ). To keep track of the number of symptomatic cases identified by the active surveillance system, we assume that human symptomatic cases are identified with probability p n and this allows fitting notification data in model simulations. According to model estimates, the number of notified cases would have been about 185 on average (95% CI 117-278), in good agreement with the number as reported to the surveillance system, namely 161 cases [1] . The number of cases drastically decreased in late August while the effective reproduction number, in the absence of interventions, would have fallen below the epidemic threshold in late September (see Fig. 4c and Fig. 4f) . This proves that a combined strategy resulted in a drastic reduction of the epidemic impact, despite the relatively large value of R 0 . Let us now consider two aspects of the control strategy. Firstly, we assume different efficacy in terms of reduction of breeding sites, eggs, larvae and adults to evaluate the robustness of the estimated effects of the interventions undertaken in Italy. As shown in Fig. 6b , results are robust for small variations of the efficacy of the vectors control. In a fully susceptible population the time from primary index case to secondary infections was estimated to be 11 days on average (95% CI [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . This allows public health authorities to gain time to put in place control measures. Secondarily, we investigate the efficacy of the single interventions (breeding sites removal, larvicides, adulticides). Results are shown only for B~200 ha {1 . As shown in Fig. 6a , reduction of eggs and breeding sites could be effective only by hypothesizing a massive intervention (cumulative attack rate is reduced on average from 73% to 55% by reducing eggs and breeding sites of 60%); adulticides do not contribute much to reducing the overall number of cases (cumulative attack rate is reduced on average from 73% to 60%); larvicides contribute to a substantial reduction of the overall number of cases (cumulative attack rate is reduced on average from 73% to 40%); In fact, larvicides are effective for a prolonged period of time and thus can contribute to decrease systematically the number of adults for a long period of time and, consequently, to substantially reduce the overall attack rate. Quite the contrary, adulticides were used for a very limited period of time (3 days) and thus their effect is limited due to the rapid increase of adults suddenly after the intervention. Overall, these results suggest that only a combined intervention, as the one performed during the outbreak, can result in a drastic decrease of the number of cases. Five smaller clusters of local transmission were detected in five towns in the same region (i.e., Ravenna, Cervia, Cesena, Rimini, and Bologna). Cervia and Ravenna are the main towns of the municipalities where the two most affected villages (Castiglione di Cervia and Castiglione di Ravenna) are located. The two affected villages account for the 2.1% of the population of the municipalities of Cervia (27,000 inhabitants) and Ravenna (157,000 inhabitants). By analyzing commuting data of the Emilia-Romagna region [47] , we found that the number of individuals traveling daily to Cervia and Ravenna for work or study is 8,787 (from 249 different municipalities), and the number Figure 6 . Sensitivity analysis. a Red: distribution (2.5%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 97.5% percentiles) of the cumulative attack rate (only symptomatic cases are considered) by assuming no interventions (baseline scenario) as in Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b , and B~200 ha {1 .

Green: as in the reference scenario but for different reductions of breeding sites and eggs. Blue: as in the reference scenario but for different reductions of larvae. Cyan: as in the reference scenario but for different reductions of adults. The horizontal dashed red line represents the observed percentage of symptomatic cases as resulting from survey data [18] . doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0018860.g006 of persons traveling daily from Cervia and Ravenna to other municipalities is 10,861 (towards 139 different municipalities). The exact number of commuters for Castiglione di Cervia and Castiglione di Ravenna is unknown but it should not exceed 2.1% of the overall number of commuters. However, the probability of traveling from/to a certain municipality should be similar to that observed for the two municipalities as a whole and we found that clusters of local transmission were recorded in municipalities well connected with the municipalities of Ravenna and Cervia (see Table 4 ). For at least four of the five clusters, population movement (i.e., persons who visited the area that was primarily affected or persons from the primarily affected area who visited one of the four towns) can be reasonably assumed to have been the main determinant of local transmission. Another possible explanation is passive vector mobility (e.g. infected mosquitoes transported by car from the initial cluster), since the flight range (active mobility) is usually considered to be less than 1 km [35, 48, 49] . Our results suggest that the transmission potential of CHIKV in Italy was similar to the one observed in tropical regions where Chikungunya fever is widespread (e.g., Reunion Island, where the best estimate for the initial R 0 was 3.7 [3] ). Specifically, we estimated R 0 to be in the range of 1.8-6. However, being the reproduction number strongly dependent on the density of mosquitoes, which in turn varies a lot over time as a consequence of seasonal meteorological effects, different (even larger) values of R 0 could be observed in future outbreaks, depending on the time of epidemic seeding. In [3] , by adapting a method originally introduced in [50] for human-to-human infections, R 0 was estimated from the generation interval probability distribution function and the number of gonotrophic cycles of the mosquito. This method can not be applied in our study, as the undertaken control measures have contributed to alter the gonotrophic cycles of the mosquito in a indeterminable manner. We found that the probability of observing a major outbreak after the introduction of an index case depends on the ratio of mosquitoes to humans and was estimated to be in the range of 32%-76%. These results confirm the high risk to Europe of tropical vector-borne diseases as a consequence of globalization, which has been modifying the mobility of humans and vectors. Climate changes could have been playing a role, as the geographical limits of mosquito-borne diseases can be influenced by climate [51, 52] , but this is still debated [53] [54] [55] . Moreover, our analysis strongly support the efficacy of the disinfestation strategy performed during the Italian outbreak, which drastically contributed to reduce the cumulative attack rate (of about 88%), though the application of self-protection preventive measures (insect repellents and window screens) could also have played a role [18] . Therefore, even if the transmission potential of Chikungunya virus could be sensibly high also in temperate climate countries, the epidemic can be controlled by performing timely interventions. The proposed model has several limitations. We assume exponential distribution for all parameters of model M related to the length of the different periods (e.g. latency, infectiousness, etc.), though it would be preferable to use multiple classes within each group to give more realistic gamma distributed lifetimes (see for instance [56] ). We assume density-dependent growth only in eggs, though other density-dependent regulating processes should be considered for other lifestages of the mosquitoes, e.g. larvae and pupae [25] . These modeling choices are due to the lack of data for parametrizing the model. The lack of information on the actual number of breeding sites -it could be assessed only by performing a field study -prevent us to give precise estimates on the density of mosquitoes over time in the study area. However, we would note that our estimates of R 0 , attack rates and probability of major outbreak are robust with respect to assumptions on the number of breeding sites. Moreover, the temporal dynamics of the vector is qualitatively well captured by model M (though not in terms of absolute abundance) and this allowed us to clarify whether or not the sharp decrease in the number of cases observed after the intervention was due to the intervention itself or to the spontaneous reduction of adults due to decrease of temperature. Definitely, a key lesson learnt from the analysis of the Chikungunya outbreak in Italy is the necessity to improve tools for obtaining reliable, though costly, estimates of the vector density (see for instance [57] ) -thus bypassing the necessity of developing ad-hoc models. The proposed model, describing the temporal dynamics of Aedes albopictus, provides a valid alternative in the absence of reliable field data.
