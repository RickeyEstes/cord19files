Seventy-eight calves were ultimately included in the study: 57 I. Lora et al. Preventive Veterinary Medicine 152 (2018) 12-15 females and 21 males, 54 Holstein purebreds and 24 Holstein-beef crossbreds. The overall mean ( ± SD) of calf serum Ig concentration was 12.6 ± 6.2 g/L, with a minimum of 1.6 g/L and a maximum of 30.9 g/L. The overall percentage of calves with FTPI was 34.6%, and it was in line with the most recent prevalence of FTPI reported for Italian dairy calves (41.0%), which was found in a previous study by the same authors (Lora et al., 2017) . Considering the 21% incidence risk for calf neonatal diarrhea in dairy herds reported by Lundborg et al. (2005) and Windeyer et al. (2014) , the percentage of calves with scours found throughout this study was high (50.0%), but it was almost comparable with the findings by Furman-Fratczak et al. (2011) in a similar study, where 37% of the 175 heifer calves considered suffered from diarrhea. The absence of respiratory disease cases observed during this study was not surprising, because calves under 30 days of age usually suffer from diarrhea, whereas respiratory diseases are more typical of older animals (McGuirk, 2008) . On the other hand, probably due to the high percentage of scours recorded, the mortality rate found in this study (6.4%) was greater than those reported by other authors (ranging from 3.1 to 5.7%), even if they were calculated on larger numbers of calves (Svensson et al., 2006; Raboisson et al., 2013; Windeyer et al., 2014) . Calves that suffered from diarrhea within 30 days of age had lower serum Ig concentrations (least squares mean (LSM) ± SEM: 11.1 ± 1.0 g/L) than asymptomatic calves (LSM ± SEM: 14.4 ± 1.1 g/L; P < .05). Moreover, calves that died in the first month of life had serum Ig concentrations nearly two times lower than calves that had survived (LSM ± SEM: 7.4 ± 2.7 vs 13.0 ± 0.7 g/L; P < .05). Therefore, being also in accordance with the previous studies by McGuire et al. (1976) and Blom (1982) that reported an association between low serum Ig concentrations and disease and mortality occurrence in dairy calves, our results confirmed the importance of a proper PI transfer to calf health. The FTPI, in particular, was a relevant risk factor for both disease and mortality occurrence among the calves considered in this study (P < .01 and P < .05, respectively; Table 1 ). Even if only few papers in literature focused on the relationship between FTPI and enteric diseases in calves (Raboisson et al., 2016) , other authors found a greater risk of disease and mortality occurrence for calves with FTPI compared to those with an adequate level of serum Ig concentration (Donovan et al., 1998b; Berge et al., 2005) . However, the level of immune protection in calves could affect not only disease occurrence, but also disease severity. In this regard, Furman-Fratczak et al. (2011) found that calves with higher PI levels suffered from milder forms of both enteric and respiratory diseases, whereas calves with serum Ig concentration higher than 15.0 g/L at 30-60 h of life avoided respiratory tract infections at all. Even if no specific indicators of calf diarrhea severity were measured in this study (e.g. dehydration, body temperature, fecal scoring), the tendency of having a lower Ig concentration observed in sick calves that needed antibiotic treatments (25.6% of the overall sick calves) compared to those that were not treated (LSM ± SEM: 8.6 ± 1.8 vs 12.2 ± 1.2 g/L; P = .127) reasonably suggested a greater severity of the disease in calves with lower PI levels. On the other hand, even if not being statistically significant, the latter result highlighted how an adequate PI level could affect the antimicrobial use in dairy farming, in accordance with Berge et al. (2005) , who actually found a relationship between FTPI and a higher risk of antibiotic treatments in calves. In this study, FTPI affected also the age at the first disease outbreak ( Fig. 1 ; Wilcoxon test of equality over strata: χ 2 = 8.27; P < .01), with a higher hazard of becoming sick over the time for calves with FTPI than for those with an adequate PI transfer (hazard ratio = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.12-3.98). Moreover, the onset of diarrhea was delayed by about 6 days in calves with an adequate PI transfer compared to those with FTPI (mean ± standard error: 16 ± 1 vs 10 ± 1 days; P < .01). The latter result, which reflected the report by Davidson et al. (1981) about calf respiratory infections (disease onset was delayed by 5-7 days for calves with higher serum Ig concentrations), could be of a crucial importance to dairy practice, because it might not be excluded that a delay in the age at disease outbreak could significantly enhance the possibility of calf recovery. With regards to specific enteropathogen infections, Cryptosporidium spp. and rotavirus were the major agents of calf diarrhea in this study, as it was expected from findings by other authors (de la Fuente et al., 1999; Bartels et al., 2010; Meganck et al., 2015) , whereas positivity to E. coli K99 and coronavirus were rarely detected and exclusively in mixed infections. Particularly, out of the 28 fecal samples that were collected from the 39 calves with scours, 13 (46.4%) were positive only to Cryptosporidium spp., five (17.9%) were positive only to rotavirus, four (14.3%) were positive to more than one infectious pathogen (two to rotavirus and Cryptosporidium spp., one to rotavirus and coronavirus, and one to E. coli, rotavirus and Cryptosporidium spp.), and six (21.4%) were negative to all the tested enteropathogens. Even if data on specific enteropathogen infections collected in this study resulted to be few, FTPI was a predisposing factor for infections caused by rotavirus and Cryptosporidium spp. (P < .05; Table 2 ). Although a larger dataset Table 1 Percentage, odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI of diarrhea and mortality occurrence in 78 calves under 30 days of age with or without failed transfer of passive immunity (FTPIserum immunoglobulin concentration < 10.0 g/L) (P < .05). a Only healthy calves (n = 39) and calves whose feces were positive for the specific pathogen included in the model (n = 9 for rotavirus and n = 16 for Cryptosporidum spp.) were considered for the statistical analysis.
