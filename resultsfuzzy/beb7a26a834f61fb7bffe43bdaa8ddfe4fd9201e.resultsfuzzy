In this section, we apply the discrimination measure to analyze two sets of DNA primary sequences. The similarities among these species are computed by calculating the discrimination measure between every two sequences. The smaller the discrimination measure is, the more similar the species are. That is to say, the discrimination measures of evolutionary closely related species are smaller, while those of evolutionary disparate species are larger. Fig. 1 illustrates the basic processes of the DM algorithm. The first set we select includes 10 bÀglobin genes, whose similarity has been studied by many researchers using their first exon sequences (Randic et al., 2003b; Liu and Wang, 2005) . Here we will analyze these species using their complete bÀglobin genes. Table 1 presents their names, EMBL accession numbers, locations and lengths. In Table 2 , we present the similarity/dissimilarity matrix for the full DNA sequences of bÀglobin gene from 10 species listed in Table 1 by our new method. Observing Table 2 , we note that the most similar species pairs are human-gorilla, humanchimpanzee and gorilla-chimpanzee, which is expected as their evolutionary relationship. At the same time, we find that gallus and opossum are the most remote from the other species, which coincides with the fact that gallus is the only nonmammalian species among these 10 species and opossum is the most remote species from the remaining mammals. By further study of the values in the table, we can gain more information about their similarity. Another usage of the similarity/dissimilarity matrix is that it can be used to construct phylogenetic tree. The quality of the constructed tree may show whether the matrix is good and therefore whether the method of abstracting information from DNA sequences is efficient. Once a distance matrix has been calculated, it is straightforward to generate a phylogenetic tree using the NJ method or the UPGMA method in the PHYLIP package (http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html). In Fig. 2, we show the phylogenetic tree of 10 bÀglobin gene sequences based on the distance matrix DM, using NJ method. The tree is drawn using the DRAWGRAM program in the PHYLIP package. From this figure, we observe that (1) gallus is clearly separated from the rest, this coincides with real biological phenomenon; (2) human, gorilla, chimpanzee and lemur are placed closer to bovine and goat than to mouse and rat, this is in complete agreement with Cao et al. (1998) confirming the outgroup status of rodents relative to ferungulates and primates. Next, we consider inferring the phylogenetic relationships of coronaviruses with the complete coronavirus genomes. The 24 complete coronavirus genomes used in this paper were downloaded from GenBank, of which 12 are SARS-CoVs and 12 are from other groups of coronaviruses. The name, accession number, abbreviation, and genome length for the 24 genomes are listed in Table 3 . According to the existing taxonomic groups, sequences 1-3 form group I, and sequences 4-11 belong to group II, while sequence 12 is the only member of group III. Previous work showed that SARS-CoVs (sequences 13-24) are not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronaviruses and form a distinct group IV. In Fig. 3 , we present the phylogenetic tree belonging to 24 species based on the distance matrix DM, using UPGMA method. The tree is viewed using the DRAWGRAM program. As shown in Fig. 3 , four groups of coronaviruses can be seen from it: (1) The group I coronaviruses, including TGEV, PEDV and HCoV-229E tend to cluster together; (2) BCoV, BCoVL, BCoVM, BCoVQ, MHV, MHV2, MHVM, and MHVP, which belong to group II, are grouped in a monophyletic clade; (3) IBV, belonging to group III, is situated at an independent branch; (4) the SARS-CoVs from group IV are grouped in a separate branch, which can be distinguished easily from other three groups of coronaviruses. The tree constructed based on DM algorithm is quite consistent with the results obtained by other researchers (Zheng et al., 2005; Song et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2007; Li et al., 2008) . The emphasis of the present work is to provide a new method to analyze DNA sequences. From the above applications, we can see that our method is feasible for comparing DNA sequences and deducing their similarity relationship.
