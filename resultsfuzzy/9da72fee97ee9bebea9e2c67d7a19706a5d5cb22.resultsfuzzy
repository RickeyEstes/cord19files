In order to highlight issues relating to the reporting of RVP results let us consider some real life experiences with RVP testing in a variety of clinical scenarios and use these experiences to formulate some general recommendations for results reporting. As background to these clinical scenarios our laboratories use the following methods for processing clinical samples for the detection of respiratory viruses. Nasopharyngeal specimens are collected using a flocked swab (Copan or Starplex Starswab Multitrans Collection and Transportation System) inserted into the posterior nasopharynx, which is then placed in the provided viral transport medium. On receipt in the lab the sample is transferred to a biological safety cabinet and vortexed to dislodge any cellular material from the swab; the swab is then discarded and the sample centrifuged. The transport medium is then decanted and saved. Part of the cellular pellet is re-suspended in a small volume of the virus transport medium and used to make smears for DFA (influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1, 2 and 3, RSV and adenovirus) using a direct fluorescent antibody kit (Diagnostic Hybrids Inc. or Chemicon Int. Light Diagnostics) (this also serves as a check for the sample quality). The decanted medium is then added back to the remaining pellet and the cells are re-suspended and set up for shell vial culture (R-mix shell vials, Diagnostic Hybrids, Athens, Ohio). The remaining sample could then be available for RVP testing (see below for positioning of test). Results from the DFA test are usually reported within 3 hours of receipt in the lab and the shell vial cultures are reported after 16-24 hours, usually the next morning before 11 AM. The viruses detected using EIA, DFA, and SVC are influenza A, B, parainfluenza virus types 1âˆ’3, adenovirus, RSV and in some labs human Metapneumovirus since monoclonal antibodies have recently become commercially available. We would not detect influenza H5 strains, SARS, Coronaviruses 229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1, enterovirus or rhinovirus, or subtype influenza. How to position the RVP test in the clinical laboratory may depend on the needs of the laboratory and its clients. The RVP could be used as a front line test to replace all other tests (EIA, DFA and cultures) or it could be used to test EIA-or DFA-negative specimens. This is discussed elsewhere in this volume and will not be discussed here other than to put the RVP testing in the appropriate context for the following clinical scenarios. Six scenarios that illustrate various issues with respect to reporting of RVP results are (Table 1) : Scenario 1. A traveler returning from an endemic area for avian influenza H5 and SARS with a clinical picture compatible with an acute viral pneumonia. Scenario 2. An outbreak in a long-term care facility that was not diagnosed using routine testing. Scenario 3. Situations in which two viral pathogens were identified. Scenario 4. Unidentified influenza A detected. Scenario 5. Retrospective diagnosis of previously undiagnosed viral illness. Scenario 6. Outbreaks seemingly related to one another in which different etiologies were determined using RVP. In all six scenarios issues arose regarding how to report the results, and from these occurrences some recommendations can be made. In scenario 1, where a traveler returned from a SARS and H5N1 endemic area, the issue was primarily to rule out H5 avian influenza and SARS. We initially reported that neither of these agents had been detected. This prompted a flurry of calls to the laboratory asking if any other viruses had been found. The first recommendation would be that the report clearly indicate all the viruses that are tested for and the results for each virus indicated as "detected" or "not detected". In scenario 2 we had a situation in which our routine testing failed to identify the cause of an outbreak in All outbreak patients should be tested for all respiratory viruses RVP provides broad viral coverage a long-term care facility. Subsequent to our negative results the samples were sent through the RVP which identified the causative agent which in this case was human metapneumovirus (hMPV) that would not normally have been detected on routine testing. In this situation we ended up sending amended reports to the charts of those patients in which metapneumovirus was detected indicating that "on further investigation human metapneumovirus was detected". We also informed the infection control service directly that we had identified a causative agent even though hMPV was not in fact a reportable disease in our jurisdiction. The second recommendation then is that even if results are available after a previously reported negative and that the outbreak has been successfully managed, the amended report listing all the respiratory viruses detected or not detected should become part of the clinical record so that retrospective studies looking at the epidemiology of suspected respiratory viral outbreaks will have complete records to correlate with the clinical presentation. In scenario 3 two viral pathogens were isolated from a single sample, one being an enterovirus/rhinovirus. The attending physician had one or two responses. Either he or she called the lab to discuss the possible interpretation of the results or they assumed that the enterovirus/rhinovirus was insignificant and ignored it. This second response may be because of how we were using the RVP test at the time as it was essentially used as a backup to our routine testing so the clinician already had a diagnosis in hand. If the RVP became the front line test the question of the significance of two pathogens would likely occur more often. The third recommendation then is that when more than one pathogen is detected they should all be reported and become part of the clinical record. The report should not say "two respiratory viruses detected" but rather should list all the viruses tested for and whether they were detected or not detected. One of the surprising results in using the RVP is that samples containing more than one pathogen were much more common than previously supposed. In our experience with the RVP test between 5 and 8% of positives are dual infections with two or more viruses present (Mahony et al., 2007) . A careful review of the literature indicates that dual infections detected by a combination of DFA, culture and NAAT have been reported at frequences as high as 30-50% (Chiu et al., 2005; Kuypers et al., 2007; van der Hoek et al., 2005) . It is not possible to interpret the significance of dual infections at this time; this will have to be evaluated in appropriate clinical studies. In scenario 4, an untyped influenza A virus is detected by a signal on the pan-reactive Influenza A matrix bead in the absence of a signal on the H1 or H3 subtyping beads. The RVP assay was developed with this scenario in mind to identify new subtypes such as H5N1 or H7N2 circulating in the human population. The matrix gene PCR target is highly conserved so that all influenza A subtypes will be detected (Mahony et al., 2007) . In developing the test it was noted that that matrix PCR was more sensitive than the H1 or H3 PCR so that occasionally an H1N1or H3N2 may be detected by the matrix bead in the absence of a signal on the typing bead. In this scenario the influenza strain should be sent to a reference laboratory for subtyping. In scenario 5 the RVP was used retrospectively to investigate the etiology of previously undiagnosed cases, sometimes from months earlier. We felt it prudent to phone the attending physician prior to sending the report so they would fully understand why the result was now being reported. We left it to the discretion of the attending physician to inform the patient rather than the lab informing the patient directly. We did this for two reasons. First the physician ordered the test, not the patient, so the physician remains the laboratory client, and secondly we were not aware of the outcome of the case whereas the treating physician was. Again if the RVP is adopted by the lab and becomes the primary test for respiratory viral infections this scenario would not occur in future, though labs doing a look back study may be faced with this scenario. However it is not unlikely that in the future other new technologies will become available that may be used in a similar fashion for retrospective diagnosis so the recommendation would still be to contact the attending physician prior to submitting a report to the clinical record. Scenario 6 also relates to the management of outbreaks in a long-term care facility and perhaps requires more extended explanation of the actual situation. Two outbreaks occurred on separate but closely associated wards in a long-term care facility. On one ward the outbreak was limited to two individuals, whereas on the other ward five individuals became involved in the outbreak. It was assumed initially, as these outbreaks had occurred at the same time, they were likely related to one another and probably had the same etiology. We were able to determine by direct testing that the outbreak involving two individuals was related to influenza A but the cluster of five patients on the other ward were negative for all pathogens tested for in our routine direct testing. At that time, both outbreaks were assumed to be of common etiology and preparations were being made to treat those individuals infected on both wards and also to prophylax the entire institution against influenza A. We ran all samples from both of these outbreaks through the RVP test and results were available later the same day. We were able to confirm influenza A in the two-patient outbreak, but the five patients who had been negative by our direct testing were all negative for influenza A but had coronavirus NL63 detected by the RVP, thereby establishing different etiologies for the outbreaks. As a result, management was modified to prophylax only those individuals on the ward where influenza A had been identified and simply use cohorting measures to deal with the other ward. Neither of these outbreaks spread any further than the wards concerned. It is often not possible to identify an etiological agent for all respiratory outbreaks and thus, if an etiology is found in any of the patients and the outbreaks are felt to be related, it is simply assumed that all individuals involved in the outbreaks have the same etiology. The RVP test provided a clear differentiation of etiologies and therefore the implementation of more appropriate infection control measures by providing accurate diagnoses. Perhaps as experience grows with the use of the RVP it will be recognized that more than one respiratory virus can circulate simultaneously in an institution. This is quite possible because in Hamilton in January of 2006 the RVP test identified 10 respiratory viruses co-circulating in the community. In this scenario there were no reporting issues but it does demonstrate the value of having RVP available both for management, as in this case, as well as better defining the epidemiology of respiratory viral infections in institutions. In light of the need for good communication between the laboratory and its clients, physicians using a specific laboratory need to be informed when tests for new analytes or new tests for existing analytes are added to the testing menu. It is good laboratory practice to inform users by official memo about new tests that have been introduced. The memo should include a rationale for the new test and if possible a few facts on the new analytes (respiratory viruses) being tested, the methodology being used, how results will be reported (including any normal values or ranges), any action that may be required relating to infection control or public health, and the name and telephone number of a contact person in the laboratory who can address questions and/or concerns.
