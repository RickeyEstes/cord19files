Four clinical trials (two in the United States, two in Europe) were initiated to study the relative effectiveness of loracarbef in treating acute bronchitis. Each trial was designed as a two-arm, randomized, parallel study comparing the efficacy of loracarbef with that of another antibiotic frequently used for treating acute bronchitis. The first study compared high-dose loracarbef (400 mg twice daily) with amoxicillin (500 mg three times daily) (Dere WH, unpublished data, 1991) . The second trial compared low-dose loracarbef (200 mg twice daily) with amoxicillin (500 mg three times daily) [Dere WH, unpublished data, 1991] . Of the remaining two trials, one compared low-dose loracarbef with the standard dose of cefaclor (250 mg three times daily) [15] , and the other compared high-dose loracarbef with the standard dose of amoxicillin/clavulanate (500/125 mg three times daily) [16] . All regimens were administered for 7 days. To be enrolled in any of these four studies, patients were required to have a diagnosis of acute, purulent bacterial bronchitis. All of the patients had a cough that was productive of purulent sputum as confirmed by microscopic examination (>-25 white blood cells and <10 epithelial cells per highpower field). Furthermore, to ensure that the infection was acute, patients were required to have experienced a rapid onset of symptoms within 14 days of enrollment in the study. Patients who were diagnosed as having chronic bronchitis or who had an infiltrate on chest radiograph, renal impairment, or hypersensitivity to fi-lactams were excluded from these trials. Pregnant and nursing women were also not eligible. More than 2,000 patients were enrolled in the four studies: a total of 538 received high-dose loracarbef, 561 received low-dose loracarbef, 244 received amoxiciUin/clavulanate, 159 received cefaclor, and 716 received amoxicillin [15, 16; Dere WH, unpublished data, 1991] . Many of the patients enrolled in these clinical trials did not qualify for clinical and bacteriologic evaluation; disqualification in most cases occurred because pretherapy evaluation of sputum cultures did not yield a known respiratory pathogen. Of 654 patients who were considered evaluable, 71% had pure or mixed cultures positive for one of the following four organisms: H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae ( Table |) . Resistance of respiratory pathogens to the antibiotics used was uncommon in both treatment groups in all four studies (Table II) [15, 16; Dere WH, unpublished data, 1991] . These low rates of resistance to loracarbef, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and cefaclor were not unexpected; surprisingly, however, the level of resistance to amoxicillin, particularly of H. influenzae, although higher than for the other agents, was also relatively low. The explanation may likely be that the studies involving the amoxicillin treatment groups took place in Europe, where the prevalence ofH. influenzae resistance to amoxicillin is generally lower than it is in the United States [17] . To determine the clinical and bacteriologic responses to antibiotic therapy, patients were evaluated within 3 days (posttherapy) and then 10-14 days (late-posttherapy) after the drugs were discontinued. The results of these studies are shown in Table II ] [15, 16; Dere WH, unpublished data, 1991] . From these data, it is clear that clinical and bacterial responses to both high-dose and low-dose loracarbef were virtually identical. In addition, loracarbef had comparable clinical and bacteriologic efficacy to each of the comparative agents. The relative safety of loracarbef in comparison with the other antibiotics was also addressed in these studies. In the study comparing loracarbef with amoxicillin/clavulanate, a similar proportion of patients in each group reported experiencing nausea, vomiting, or both as well as rash or other cutaneous manifestations of hypersensitivity (Table IV) [16] ; the proportions of patients who discontinued therapy were also comparable. However, a significantly greater number of patients in the amoxi- Cephalothin disk was used to test susceptibility to cefaclor. mpicillin was used to test susceptibility to amoxicillin. Data from [15, 16; Dere WH, unpublished data, 1991] . cillin/clavulanate group reported experiencing diarrhea. In the study in which loracarbef was compared with cefaclor, the safety profiles of the two drugs were similar for all event categories ( Table  V) [15] . This was also true for adverse reactions reported by patients who received treatment with high-dose loracarbef, low-dose loracarbef, or amoxicillin (Table VI) [Dere WH, unpublished data, 1991] . In summary, recent clinical trials designed to evaluate the use of loracarbef in treating acute bronchitis have shown that loracarbef had clinical as well as bacteriologic efficacy similar to that of the comparative drugs against such major respiratory pathogens as H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, ; Posttherapy evaluation occurred 3 days after therapy was discontinued; late posttherapy, 10-14 days after therapy was discontinued. "Clinical success" refers to elimination of or improvement in symptoms. ~b'Bacteriologic success" refers to documented elimination or presumed elimination (in patients who had clinical success and a repeat culture was not possible or indicated--sputum production resolved) of the pathogen.
