For the NA tree, nine routes were identified with the Al Fayyum â†’ Al Qalyubiyah route having the highest support with a BF of 34.40. Like the HA, the majority of the routes begin and end in the Delta region. However, it also contains a route from the Delta region in the north to the Qina governorate in the south. This is consistent with the HA map. We conducted a phylogeography study of H5N1 that focused on Egyptian strains of the variant clade 2.2.1.1. The utilization of viral sequence data and generation of phylogeographic models highlighted the complex history of the virus and the countrywide spread during a small time period. As mentioned, phylogeography allows one to infer geographic dispersion as a component of genotype evolution over time. By considering geography as a state within H5N1 evolution, we identified locations that are impacted by certain clades; in this case the variant 2.2.1.1. Our findings are consistent with Arafa et al. [24] , Balish et al. [21] and Taha et al. [26] , in identifying the Delta region as an important area for 2.2.1.1. In addition, Al Qalyubiyah, also in the Delta, dominated a large portion of both trees, yet there was uncertainty about migration to and from this location. Finally, the statistical phylogeography metrics suggest that H5N1 diffusion is geographically structured in Egypt.
