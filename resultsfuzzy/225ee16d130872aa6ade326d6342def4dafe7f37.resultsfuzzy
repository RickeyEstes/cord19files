Construct Design and Enzymatic Properties of M48 USP A 205 residue module in the N-terminal portion of MCMV M48 and EBV BPLF1 is necessary and sufficient for deubiquitinating activity and Ub specificity (Schlieker et al., 2005) . The proposed catalytic triad and oxyanion residues of this cysteine protease module are conserved in all herpesviruses. The tegument protease domains otherwise display only moderate sequence conservation (%12% identity between representatives of a, b, and g subfamilies) yet share a high degree of structural similarity according to secondary structure predictions (Schlieker et al., 2005) . Neither BLAST searches (Altschul et al., 1997) nor threading programs that employ sequence alignment and protein-fold recognition algorithms (McGuffin et al., 2000) uncovered homologs other than herpesvirus tegument proteins (data not shown). This suggested that htUSPs have structural properties that are distinct from known DUBs and other cysteine proteases Sulea et al., 2006) . Accordingly, UL36 USP and its homologs represent an independent family (C76) in the CA clan of proteases in the MEROPS peptidase database (Rawlings et al., 2004) . To explore the structural and mechanistic properties of htUSPs, we expressed an N-terminal fragment encompassing residues 1-236 of the MCMV M48 tegument protein (M48 USP ), which likely comprises the entire USP domain of M48, because it is followed by an $70 residue region that is likely unstructured according to secondary structure predictions. To confirm that this domain is a functional deubiquitinating enzyme, we first tested the ability of M48 USP to hydrolyze the fluorogenic substrate Ub C-terminal 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (UbAMC). UbAMC hydrolysis followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with k cat / K M = 9.17 3 10 6 M À1 s À1 (data not shown). To determine whether M48 USP can cleave true isopeptide-linked Ub chains, we examined its ability to attack K48-linked or K63-linked diUb by using a 500-fold excess of substrate over enzyme. Both adducts were converted to free monomeric Ub, albeit with $5-fold slower kinetics for K63-linked compared to K48-linked diUb ( Figure 1A) . Can M48 USP also cleave Ub conjugates found in living cells? To address this issue, 293T cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged Ub and treated with a proteasome inhibitor, ZL 3 VS (Bogyo et al., 1997) , to allow accumulation of (poly)-ubiquitinated species. Cell lysates were prepared and incubated in the absence and presence of M48 USP or its catalytically inactive counterpart, M48 USP -C23A (Schlieker et al., 2005) , and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting ( Figure 1B ). Both free Ub and Ub conjugates were readily detectable, the latter being more prominent in samples derived from ZL 3 VS-treated cells. Upon exposure to nanomolar concentrations of M48 USP , the majority of cellular Ub conjugates were deubiquitinated, as judged by the near-complete elimination of high molecular weight, anti-HA-reactive material and a corresponding increase in free Ub. For comparison, we also tested the homologous EBV-derived protease BPLF1 USP and observed similar deubiquitinating activity ( Figure 1B) , confirming that the activity exerted on poly-Ub adducts is conserved among herpesviruses.
