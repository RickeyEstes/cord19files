We found a significant incremental linear association between the number of individual contacts and participant age. We found no significant association between the number of individual contacts and modes of data collection, but household size above 4 was associated with a greater number of individual contacts. The probability of reporting group contacts was significantly associated nonlinearly with participant age, with a similar relationship of contacts and participant age to the number of total contacts. Telephone interview was associated with a significantly greater probability of reporting group contacts than self-reporting. Workdays and higher population density were associated with a significantly greater probability of reporting contacts (Supplementary Fig. S14 and Supplementary Table S9 ). The distribution of the number of animal contacts was right-skewed with a median of one animal. Children aged 3-6 years, especially females, had the highest number of animal contacts (Fig. 2 B1-B2) . The distribution of the animal contact duration was also right-skewed with a median of 0.62 hours. In those aged 20-74, animal contact duration was much longer in females than in males, but this was reversed in other age groups ( Fig. 2 C1-C2 ). Most frequently, participants had contact with one kind of animal, and amongst the animal species encountered, dogs still dominated (45.1%) ( Fig. 2 D1-D2) . Most of the animal contacts occurred in the home setting (81.6%). Adults aged 60-75, especially females, more frequently had animal contact outside of the home (Fig. 2 E1-E3 ). Supplementary Text S10: The evaluation of the quality of data collection 78% participants who chose self-reporting filled out the questionnaire on the day that was assigned to them, while 82.8% participants who chose telephone interview had completed the interview on the assigned day. The proportion of rating their own recall performance as "well" or "very well" was 89.6% and 95.3% respectively for selfreporting and telephone interview. For self-reporting, 11.1% participants reported not including all contacts, and the mean number of contacts that had been left out was 1.1. For telephone interview, 10.9% participants reported not including all contacts, and the mean number of contacts left out was 0.8. To sum up, telephone interview participants rated the quality of their responses across a number of dimensions higher than self-reporting participants, although both of the different modes of data collection had a good quality of data collection (Supplementary Table S13 ).
