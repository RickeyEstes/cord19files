EBV and CDV RT-PCR were performed using conventional methods (primers are listed in S1 Table) and the amplicons were visualized on 1% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. PCR amplicons were sequenced using the ABI 3100 genetic analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the sequenced nucleotides were analyzed using Geneious version 7.0.6. (Biomatters Limited, New Zealand). Bloodmeals were identified by multiplexed PCR targeting cytochrome b DNA as described [28] .
