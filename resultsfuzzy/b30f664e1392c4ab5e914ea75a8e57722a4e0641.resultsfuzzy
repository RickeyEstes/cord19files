The reception area and the NPA sample aliquoting area were kept separate from the working areas. Results were considered positive when concordant PCR results were obtained in two different aliquots. Each positive sample in the first batch of test samples was extracted and amplified twice. If a positive result remained 'unconfirmed' after this protocol was followed, the result was reported as negative.
