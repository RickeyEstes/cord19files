The time series plot of the main variables in the form of annual growth used in Equation (1) shows no abnormality in the trend and pattern (see Fig. 2 ). There is a sharp decline (by 7.3 per cent) of tourism arrivals at the outbreak of the SARS pandemic in 2003 while the global financial crisis only produced a minor fall of 0.8 per cent. However, the reductions in these two periods were followed by strong bounce-back corrections, resulting in an average annual growth rate of 19.3 per cent in the whole period, which is much faster than the average annual growth rate of GDP per capita (9.3 per cent) and price index (0.5 per cent). To check for stationarity of main variables, we use the augmented Dickey-Fuller test with the null hypothesis that the series have a unit root. The test results rejected the null hypothesis for tourist arrivals (p-value ¼ 0.001), lag of tourist arrival (p-value: 0.002), cost index (p-value ¼ 0.000), and migration flows (pvalue ¼ 0.004) but failed to reject the null hypothesis for GDP per capita (p-value ¼ 0.272). Despite one of the regressors having a unit root, we can still proceed with the analysis if all regressors are not cointegrated. The Johansen trace test for cointegration failed to reject the null hypothesis that the rank of the cointegration matrix is zero (test statistics: 63.55; critical value at 5%: 47.21). Thus, we are confident that these variables can be used to estimate the determinants of Chinese arrivals in Australia as specified in Equation (1). Because the lagged dependent variable is included, the error term in Equation (1) may have serial correlation. 3 To mitigate this issue, we firstly applied the Prais-Winsten regression to take into account possible heteroscedasticity and serial correlation in the error terms. The diagnosis tests show that the regression residuals meet the required criteria. In particular, the Durbin h test failed to reject the null hypothesis that the regression residuals do not have autocorrelation (p-value: 0.393) while the Portmanteau test failed to reject the null hypothesis that the residuals are white noise (pvalue: 0.622). To check for the robustness of results, we then conducted the Cochrane-Orcutt regression, which is an alternative approach to control for serial autocorrelation in Equation (1). Although results from both techniques are similar, the Cochrane-Orcutt estimator is better for model selection criteria (i.e., Akaike Information Criterion e AIC, and Bayesian Information Criterion e BIC) are lower (see Table 4 ). Thus, it is a preferred model in this paper. We now focus on discussing results of the Cochrane-Orcutt estimator.
