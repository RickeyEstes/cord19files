Although home NPPV is widely accepted for the treatment of chronic hypercapnia due to respiratory or neuromuscular disease, whether stable hypercapnic COPD patients should routinely be offered this therapy is still discussed [48] . Recently, the role of ventilator management on physiological parameters and outcome in stable hypercapnic COPD patients has become more evident. It is suggested that its benefits depend on the ability of NPPV to substantially reduce PaCO 2 through using "high" inflation pressures [49] . This was confirmed by prospective trials, showing an advantage of high over lower inspiratory pressure levels, with regard to improvements of lung function, blood gases, exerciseinduced dyspnoea and health status [50, 51] . A multicenter study showed a highly significant survival advantage of NPPV (compared with standard care) when it was targeted to maximize hypercapnia reduction [52] . The findings of that study may influence the attitude of clinicians on the use of NPPV in patients with stable hypercapnic COPD. However, the effect of elective home NPPV on exacerbation frequency in stable hypercapnic COPD remains to be determined. The use of NPPV is a first line treatment of acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure in COPD patients [8] . However, once acute hypercapnic respiratory failure is successfully managed and these patients are discharged, there is an 80 % re-hospitalization rate due to another acute exacerbation over the following year [53] . Furthermore, long-term survival in this patient cohort remains poor [54] . Three relatively small studies investigated the effect of home NPPV after acute hypercapnic respiratory failure successfully treated in COPD patients. One study showed that, compared to sham (continuous positive airway pressure) ventilation, NPPV significantly reduced the probability of recurrent acute hypercapnic respiratory failure [55] . Another study compared home NPPV versus standard therapy in chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure patients after acute exacerbation in order to prevent clinical worsening [56] . The authors demonstrated that the probability of clinical worsening was significantly lower in the group receiving home NPPV, with additional improvements observed in exercise capacity. The third, retrospective, study demonstrated better survival in COPD patients discharged after acute respiratory failure with home NPPV compared to those discharged without this form of therapy [57] .
