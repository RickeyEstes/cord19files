Intracellular pathogens such as bacteria and viruses modulate key cellular processes which may involve changes in reference gene expression [25, 26] . Each pathogen manipulates several cellular transcription pathways in different degrees also according to the affected cell type [25, 26] . Efficient infections with P. salmonis and IPNV have been evidenced by increasing cytopathic effect, as well as by accumulation of bacterial DNA and viral RNA over time in both CHSE-214 and RTS11 cell cultures (Figures 1 and 2) . To rule out persistency, we made sure CPE was detectable resulting in productive infection ( Figure 1 ). As well, no primer specific amplification of the ITS region of the bacteria 16S operon and the VP2 fragment of IPNV were evidenced in control samples (Figure 2 ). Despite progressive pathogen replication and accumulation in cultures, the expression of some reference genes remained constant, while others varied. Prior validation of the selected reference gene candidates (ACTB, EF1A, GAPDH, UBQ and TUBA), general expression levels based on mean qPCR threshold cycle (Ct) values in control CHSE-214 and RTS11 cells were determined, since extremely high or low expression levels might preclude their usefulness as internal controls ( Figure 3) . Ct values from 16.17 and 24.99 indicated expression levels in an appropriate range. For each assay, a standard curve for RTS11 and for CHSE-214 samples was generated by using 10-fold serial dilutions of pooled cDNA, generated from a mix of infected and control samples. Linear correlation coefficient (R 2 ) varying from 0.9910 to 0.9998 and efficiencies between 87% and 96% showed that these assays were suitable for quantitative purposes (see Additional file 1). The stability of gene expression over different samples can be achieved by evaluating qRT-PCR data with statistical algorithms. The geNorm software was chosen, since several studies have not found large differences between this tool and the NormFinder and the Bestkeeper [14, 26, 27] . GeNorm permitted to determine the internal control gene-stability measure M, which was calculated from the average pairwise variation of a particular gene with all other control genes. Genes with the lowest M values have the most stable expression. Assuming that the control genes are not co-regulated, stepwise exclusion of the gene with the highest M value results in a combination of two constitutively expressed housekeeping genes that have the most stable expression in the tested samples [3] . The ranking of the 5 candidate reference genes according to their M value was very similar in all assays (Figure 4a) . In order to determine the optimal number of reference genes required for accurate normalisation, the pairwise variations V n/n+1 between each combination of sequential normalisation factors NF n containing an increasing number of genes were calculated (Figure 4b) . If the addition of a gene produced large differences between consecutives V n/n+1 , then the added gene should be preferably included for calculation of NF n [3] . Following this criteria, only the IPNV infection assay on RTS11 cell cultures might consider the inclusion of a UBQ and EF1A were the best ranked reference gene candidates, as they had the lowest sum p values (0.813 and 1.023, respectively) which represents the standard deviation (SD) of reference gene expression over all infections investigated (Table 2 ). EF1A has been demonstrated to be a good housekeeping gene for the analysis of infection challenges, although a slight upregulation in RTS11 cells after 9 days P. salmonis infection ( Figure  5A ). In contrast to the reports of modulated expression by viral infections of human cell lines [26] and in infection of Atlantic salmon with ISAV [11] , ACTB showed in general a good performance during P. salmonis and IPNV infection, being considered in all cases as one of the three most stable genes ( Figure 4a ). As well, its reliability has been confirmed in LPS stimulated cells and tissues of fish [12] and birds [27] . In order to show how transcription profile of the least stable genes can be affected during each experimental setting, their relative transcription levels were determined using the normalization factor calculated from the geometric mean of the three most stable housekeeping genes ( Figure 5 ). In agreement with several other studies on teleosts, GAPDH was one of the least stable genes in our panel [13, 15, 28] . In mammals GAPDH was shown to be influenced by a large number of Figure 5 Normalized GAPDH, TUBA and EF1A gene expression. Relative mRNA levels for GAPDH (grey bars), TUBA (dark grey bars) and EF1A (white bars) at times after the addition of either P. salmonis (A) or IPNV (B). Gene expression was normalized by the geometric mean of the three most stable housekeeping genes determined by geNorm in each assay. The 2d and the 6 h controls were used as calibrators (value = 1) in the (A) P. salmonis and in the (B) IPNV assays, respectively. Bars represent the mean values (Â± SE) for samples from three biological replicates. The asterisk (*) denotes significant differences from calibrators (P < 0.05; Mann-Whitney test). physiological states and to play a role in a broad range of cellular mechanisms [29] . GAPDH expression was increasingly upregulated in RTS11 cells infected with P. salmonis and was slightly upregulated over 48 h in both control and IPNV-treated CHSE-214 cultures. This regulation on non-infected cells was not perceptible in the long-term experiment with P. salmonis or in the assays with RTS11. Schmitten and Zakrajsek [30] demonstrated that the addition of serum to serum-starved human fibroblast cultures increased the mRNA amount for GAPDH. Although in our experiments, cells were maintained in a low serum concentration (5% fetal bovine serum), the addition of fresh media prior to infection could stimulate slightly the expression of GAPDH in the first few hours. Therefore, an important point to consider during the selection of a reference gene is whether expression could be eventually regulated by other factors than the challenge self. This differential regulation in the reference gene could lead to over-or sub-estimations of target gene expression. As well, TUBA showed increased expression over 48 h in both control and IPNV-infected CHSE-214 cultures, while in infected RTS11 cultures, TUBA was downregulated. Then, TUBA gene expression was influenced by IPNV infection but the direction of the influence depended on the cell type. From our experiments using CHSE-214 and RTS11 as in vitro infection models for the study of immune host responses to the facultative bacteria P. salmonis and to the aquabirnavirus IPNV, we recommend the use of the following housekeeping genes: UBQ, EF1A and ACTB, as they showed an overall stable performance in both cell types under the infection conditions.
