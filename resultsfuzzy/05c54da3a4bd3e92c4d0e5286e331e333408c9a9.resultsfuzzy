Samples of all animals collected (Table 2) were tested in the replicase 1a qRT-PCR assay. Of the Myuchelys georgesi turtles tested (n = 31), viral RNA was detected in conjunctival swabs from eight animals and also in oral swabs from 2 of these animals. Ct values were consistently high (Ct >31), with most Ct >35. Low levels of viral RNA were also detected in conjunctival swabs from two of the 49 Emydura macquarii turtles tested and in 2 of 13 samples of egg casings of unknown species (Ct >37 in each instance) ( Table 2) . These casings had been adherent to the plastron of 2 M. georgesi. The reactivity detected in each of these samples collected during this field survey was confirmed with similar results obtained when tested in the replicase 1a qRT-PCR.
