To characterize the phenotype of SARS ϩ cells, autopsy lung samples from nine SARS patients Identifi cation of the nature of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-infected cells is crucial toward understanding the pathogenesis. Using multicolor colocalization techniques, we previously reported that SARS ؉ cells in the lung of fatally infected patients expressed the only known functional receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and also a binding receptor, liver/lymph node -specifi c ICAM-3 -grabbing non-integrin (CD209L). In this study, we show that SARS-infected cells also express the stem/progenitor cell markers CD34 and Oct-4, and do not express cytokeratin or surfactant. These putative lung stem/progenitor cells can also be identifi ed in some non-SARS individuals and can be infected by SARScoronavirus ex vivo. Infection of these cells may contribute to the loss of lung repair capacity that leads to respiratory failure as clinically observed. were subjected to triple-color sequential immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofl uorescence staining on the same section. We found that the SARS antigen could be detected in six patients who died within 11 d after illness onset, but not in the other three patients who died 21, 24, or 27 d after disease onset ( Table I ) , which is consistent with a recent report showing that SARS antigen or RNA could not be detected in patients who died Ͼ2 wk after disease onset ( 11 ) . In samples where SARS antigen was detected, as many as 42 SARS ϩ cells in a microscopic fi eld (400ϫ) were identifi ed ( Table I ) . By location, SARS ϩ cells were found in the alveoli ( Fig. 1 , a and b, and d and e , red) and the bronchiolar lining layer ( Fig.  1 , j and k , red). By morphology, SARS ϩ cells were round or oval in shape and rich in cytoplasm ( Fig. 1, b , d, e, j, and k ). Furthermore, SARS ϩ cells did not express surfactant A, a type II pneumocyte marker ( Fig. 1, a, b , d, and j , brown), or cytokeratin ( Fig. 1 , e and k , green). SARS ϩ cells did not express surfactant C (also a type II pneumocyte marker) or T1 ␣ (a type I pneumocyte marker) either (Fig. S2 , available at http://www .jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070462/DC1). Because bronchial/bronchiolar lining layers are composed of multiple cell types that are compactly arranged, some SARS ϩ cells were " overlapping " with adjacent cytokeratin ϩ cells (e.g., one indicated by a circle, Fig. 1 k and Fig. S3 ), which could be mistakenly interpreted as " colocalized " on two-dimensional images. However, they could be carefully distinguished by adjusting the focus under the microscope. Our fi ndings indicate that SARS-infected cells are unlikely to be pneumocytes (either type 1 or type 2) or cytokeratin ϩ epithelial cells. This observation is supported by a recent report that SARS-CoV cannot infect or replicate in the fully diff erentiated mouse type 1 or type 2 pneumocytes ( 14 ) . Our result does contradict some data in the literature that suggest that cytokeratin ϩ , surfactant ϩ , or the epithelial membrane antigenexpressing pneumocytes are targeted by SARS-CoV ( 6 -12 ) . Upon reviewing the literature, however, we noticed that in is in the right column. Isotype antibody control for IHC and immunofl uorescence is in g and h, respectively. Some SARS ϩ cells were actually " overlapping " with adjacent cytokeratin ϩ cells (one indicated by a circle in k), which might be mistakenly regarded " colocalized " on two-dimensional photos. Panels of each row represent results of the same section from a patient. Results are representative of six SARS patients who died within 11 d after disease onset. Bar, 20 m.
