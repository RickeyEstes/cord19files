To examine the predictive capacities of the original composite index, the revised index, the official historical cases and the historical cases combined with original and revised indices, we used all of the previous data to predict cases of HFMD for a given week. To validate the accuracy of the predictions, they were compared to the official HFMD cases. From the start of 2009 to the end of 2011, this method was used on a rolling basis to predict HFMD cases week by week, thus reflecting how such a system would likely be used in the real world [3] . As there are not sufficient data available for historical data determinations for the first ten weeks of 2009 (less than ten weeks), their HFMD cases are not predicted. Models were fitted to Eqs (3), (4) and (5) . The original composite index was fitted using (Eq 3): The revised index was fitted using (Eq 3): The historical cases (lagged CCDC) were fitted using (Eq 4): The combination of historical cases and the composite index (composite index + lagged CCDC) were fitted using (Eq 5): The combination of historical cases and the revised index (revised index + lagged CCDC) were fitted using (Eq 5): The performances of these models were measured using the mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root-mean-squared error (RMSE). Table 2 summarizes the accuracy metrics for each of these models. Of all of the models examined, the model that combined the revised index and lagged CCDC performed the best. Compared to the composite index models, revised index, lagged CCDC, and combined composite index and lagged CCDC, we found MAE improvements of 47.34%, 35.35%, 21.53% and 11.19%, respectively. An MAE of 749.2 denotes that each city's error level reaches nearly 35.68 cases per week. Improving total HFMD case estimations may help the government and hospitals better prepare for an impending epidemic. Fig 5 provides a visualization of the predicting curves of all of the models, illustrating that the combined revised index and lagged CCDC is more stable and accurate in modeling HFMD trends. The mean absolute percent error was 20.81%, which was lower than both the lagged CCDC (26.93%) and the combined composite index and lagged CCDC (23.5%).
