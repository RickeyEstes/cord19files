The respondents were usually owners (34%) and general managers (41%), with a large majority of them males with university bachelor degrees (70%). The majority of these firms were independent, mainly family-run businesses (78%). The participating firms were categorized into three groups in order to determine whether there were any differences in their responses to survey questions. Based on the Ministry of Tourism's hotel grade criteria, four-and five-star hotels and first-class holiday villages formed group I (n = 36), two-and three-star hotels group II (n = 31), and one-star hotels and other types of hotels registered with the local municipalities group III (n = 39). Of the 106 firms that participated in the study, 64 (60.4% of the sample) had not expected a crisis in Turkey before February 2001. Only 38 (35.8%) claimed to have predicted a possible crisis. Their preparation activities are presented in Table 1 . According to the results of the Mann-Whitney-U test, there was no statistically significant difference between the hotels in Bodrum and those in Nevsehir in terms of preparation activities. The results from the Kruskall-Wallis test indicated that (except for one item, ''reviewed our debts''), no statistically significant differences existed in preparation activities among the participant firms. The hotels in groups II and III seemed to have been much more concerned about their debts than those in group I. The 38 properties appeared to have taken only financial precautions, and none seem to have formed any management plans or teams in advance. These findings are perhaps not surprising because, reflecting the industry in general, the majority of the participants were small and mid-sized family-run businesses, which often lack the knowledge and resources to devote to formal training activities for learning and employing contemporary management practices. During the interviews, the respondents stated that they had failed to predict the crisis but they claimed that unexpected developments and disasters often broke out in and around Turkey; therefore, all of the firms in the industry were trying to survive. In their own mind, they were always trying to cut costs, improve quality, and be more cautious and conservative when deciding on new investments, believing this to be the true approach to crisis management. However, these activities were more reactive and tactical, and more like fighting a fire (Bohn 2000) , than proactive. Table 2 presents the findings on the actions taken by participating firms to deal with the crisis after it had broken out. The results from the Mann-Whitney-U test indicated that Bodrum and Nevsehir differed on four items: increased marketing and sales efforts; checked business agreements and contracts; spent more time on environmental scanning and prepared plans. On the other hand, when the Kruskull-Wallis test was applied, it was found that the three groups did not differ much from each other in terms of ranked scores, except on one item: spending more time on environmental scanning. The results suggest that the crisis had both negative and positive impacts on tourism in Turkey. This is in line with studies in the generic management field such as those by Fink (1986) and Kovoor-Misra, Clair and Bettenhausen (2001) . More than half of the respondents (54%) believed that it had resulted in more negative impacts, 38% agreed that it had resulted in both negative and positive impacts, and 8% believed that it had resulted in only positive impacts. Table  3 shows the main short-term negative effects. Because the results from the t-test indicated that there were no statistical differences between the two destinations concerning the items given in Table 3 , the test results were ignored. However, the results of the ANOVA test indicated that only two items, ''reduced budget for training'' and ''fixed and variable costs increased'', differed among the three types of hotels. In particular, firms in groups II and III seemed to have reduced their budget for training and realized that their costs increased much more than firms in group I. Among the main short-term positive effects, as presented in Table 4 , the most important ones were being able to increase sales prices in Turkish Lira, being forced to reduce costs, and being able to introduce new management techniques. The results from the t-test indicated that there were no statistical differences between the two destinations concerning the items given in Table 4 , excluding ''realized our internal managerial inefficiencies''. Firms in Bodrum seemed to have agreed with this item much more than those in Nevsehir. Similar to this, except for ''realized our internal managerial inefficiencies'', the results of the ANOVA test did not reveal any significant differences among types of firms on the short-term positive impacts. The long-term negative effects are presented in Table 5 . There were no statistical differences between the two destinations concerning the items given in Table 5 , except for ''diminishing domestic demand'' and ''the loss of qualified staff to other sectors''. On the other hand, ANOVA indicated significant differences among the types of hotels in three items relating to the long-term negative impact: ''diminishing domestic demand'', ''the resultant image of Turkey as a cheap destination in international markets'', and ''qualified employees leaving the industry''. Hotels in group II seemed to have stronger views on these items than those in groups I and III, whereas on the last item groups II and III seemed to have stronger views. The main long-term positive impacts are presented in Table 6 . According to the results from the t-test, except for ''more attention will be given to marketing'', there were no differences between the two destinations regarding the items in Table 6 . Similarly, because ANOVA indicated no significant differences on the long-term positive impacts among the types of hotels, the test results were omitted. The study by Taylor and Enz (2002) reveals that the tragic events of September 11 in the United States affected hotel segments in different ways; for example, high-priced hotels experienced a greater decline in business than budget ones. Upscale hotels relied on marketing strategies to attract new customers, while budget ones offered discounts. As presented above, the results of the current study indicate some differences between the destinations and among the hotel types in some items. However, there are more similarities than differences between the destinations and among types of firms in their responses to the event and their views of its short-and long-term positive and negative impacts. Although these two destinations are quite different in terms of product, market segment, and the customer profile, the similarities among the research results reveal that the impacts of the crisis did not differ much in relation to destination. The research results indicate important similarities between the short-and long-term negative effects, whereas few similarities can be seen between the short-and long-term positive impacts. When comparing both types of negative effects, it seems certain that these and their consequences are likely to be felt for several years. During the interviews, the respondents were asked how they could benefit from the crisis in the long term. It was understood that considering the negative effects of the crisis and the poor financial performance of firms over the years; it did not seem to be so easy for them to capitalize on positive effects. To capitalize on these, participating firms needed to undertake formal analyses and devote time, money, and human resources. Although the crisis had some negative impacts, both short-and longterm, this was not the case for foreign tourist demand and revenues. The number of arrivals rose from 10.4 million in 2000, to 11.5 million in 2001, and to 13.2 million in 2002. In turn, tourism revenues increased from $7.6 billion in 2000, to $8 billion in , and to $8.5 in 2002 in (Tursab 2004 . It is perhaps the case that if a crisis occurs in a tourist-generating country, their receiving destinations may suffer. For example, Okumus, Altinay and Arasli (2005) investigated the impact of the 2001 economic crisis in Turkey on the tourism industry in Northern Cyprus. Their findings indicated that this event had dramatic negative impacts on incoming tourism, since tourists from Turkey comprised the main market in Northern Cyprus.
