Production of new commercial vaccines against new IBV variants is generally not beneficial to the concerned biological firms because of the high expenses and the period required for their product validation [16] ; besides, the relationship between protection and serotype is often hard to evaluate for the choice of the right vaccine serotype [24, 25] . For these reasons, assessing antigenic relationships among field and vaccine IBV strains must be accomplished by standard methods that mainly include laboratory cross-challenge studies in chickens. In the current study, protection conferred by the H120 vaccine (Massachusetts group) against the Tunisian TN20/00 variant was evaluated. In addition, the protection offered by the vaccine was compared with the protection provided by the CR88 variant vaccine (793B type) alone or in association with the H120 vaccine, under laboratory conditions. In addition, a field study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of a vaccination protocol based on the administration of H120 vaccine at 1 d followed by a second vaccination with the CR88 strain at 14 d old. The antigenic relatedness between the CR88 and the TN20/00 serotypes in addition to their renal tropism were the main factors for using the CR88 vaccine strain in the current study. Bouroga√¢ et al. [14] demonstrated by phylogenetic studies that the CR88 vaccine was closely related to the Tunisian field variants, especially the TN20/00 variant.
