The following sections present and discuss collected data on the removal efficiencies of selected PhCs as well as conventional parameters from HWW by different systems acting as primary, secondary and tertiary steps. A specific section is devoted to the removal ability of microorganisms observed in the different technologies and on measures suggested to reduce the spread of pathogens and also of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Supplementary data provides a brief overview on the main reactions taking place during AOPs and might help in reading the following discussion.
