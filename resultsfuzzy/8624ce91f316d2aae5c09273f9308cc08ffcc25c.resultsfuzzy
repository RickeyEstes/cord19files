Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the causative agent of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which leads to a highly contagious respiratory disease in nursery pigs and reproductive failure in sows [1] . PRRS was first reported in 1987 in North America and has become pandemic within a few years. PRRS is still one of the most economically important diseases for the swine industry worldwide [2, 3] . PRRSV is a member of the genus Arterivius of the family Arteriviridae within the order Nidovirales. This enveloped virus bears a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome containing at least seven genes, encoding the replicase (ORF 1a and ORF 1b) and the structural proteins E, GP2 or GP2a, GP3, GP4, 5a, GP5, M, and N in the order 5′-ORF1-E-GP2-GP3-GP4-5a-GP5-M-N-3′ [4] [5] [6] . The structural proteins are expressed by a nested series of subgenomic (sg) RNAs, which are produced during viral transcription. The structure of the arterivirus and coronavirus sg mRNAs derives from the discontinuous step of minus-strand RNA synthesis, which is guided by conserved AU-rich transcription-regulating sequences (TRS) [7] [8] [9] . There are two key elements of TRSs that are present both at the 3′ end of the leader sequence (leader TRS) and at the 5′ end of each gene in the 3′-proximal region of the genome (body TRSs). The body TRS motifs are found preceding almost all structural genes, while a leader TRS is present at the 5′ end of the genome. Minusstrand RNA synthesis is guided by base-pairing between the genomic leader TRS and the copy of the body TRS present in the 3′ end of the nascent minus strand. Next, the nascent strands are extended with the complement of the genomic leader sequence, generating a nested set of minus-strand templates that can be directly copied into the sg mRNAs [10, 11] . Leader TRS is highly conserved among Arteriviridae. For example, in equine arteritis [12] , highly related with those found in lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) (UAUAACC) [13] and in simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) (UUAACC) [14] . In case of PRRSV, the leader TRS is also highly conserved and appears to be UUAACC regardless of the PRRSV genotype (type 1 or type 2, also called European and North American genotypes, respectively) [15, 16] [16] [17] [18] . Others and we have previously shown that the infectious clone of PRRSV can be engineered as an expression vector, in which a foreign gene could be expressed under the control of a body TRS as a separate transcription unit. These findings have confirmed the potential use of PRRSV as a vaccine vector against swine pathogens [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .
