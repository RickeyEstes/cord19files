As shown in Fig. 2 , it is not apparent to observe all the change points from raw historical data. In order not to overlook any information, we would examine all change points via the minimax threshold (13) and via the fix point threshold (7), and then compare their features and characteristics. Afterwards, we make reference to historical events that correspond to the detected changes. This is followed by a discussion on the location effect and on the spreading out effect among the four cities under study (see Fig. 3 ).
