Transcription profiling of the candidate genes cDNA was synthesised from DNA-free RNA (checked with minus RT control) isolated from 8 normal equine skin and 8 equine sarcoid samples. A real-time PCR assay, based on SYBR ® Green detection, was designed for the transcription profiling of six frequently used reference genes (ACTB, B2M, HPRT1, UBB, TUBA1 and RPL32 )in these cDNA samples. During optimisation of the protocol, real-time PCR products were visualised by gelelectrophoresis and sequenced for verification. For every assay, a single amplicon with the expected size was generated without primer dimer formation. Indeed, the formation of primer dimers and unspecific amplification, which can falsely increase the gene expression levels, is a major point of attention, particularly when using intercalating dyes such as SYBR ® Green. Amplicon sequences of ACTB, B2M, HPRT1, and TUBA1 were 100% identical with the described sequences on which primer design was based. The sequencing of UBB revealed 1 gap and 3 SNPs compared to the original sequence (98% identity). The gap is probably due to sequencing errors; the SNPs did not result in an amino acid variation. When translated to amino acid sequence, the RPL32 sequence was 100% identical to publicly accessible horse ESTs and human RPL32 amino acid sequences. After optimisation, gene-specific amplification was confirmed by a single peak in melt-curve analysis. For each assay, a standard curve was generated by using 10-fold serial dilutions of pooled cDNA, generated of both normal skin and equine sarcoid tissue, characterised by a linear correlation coefficient (R 2 ) varying from 0.991 to 0.998 and a PCR efficiency between 88.1 and 104.6%. These findings showed that these assays are suitable for quantitative purposes. In order to select a reliable set of reference genes, each assay was performed in duplicate and included the appropriate control samples. To compare the transcription level of the selected genes across the different samples, the Ct values, ranging from 16.4 to 31.4 were converted into raw data based on the PCR efficiency, gathered by standard curve analyses. For the reasons discussed above, we have confidence that our gene expression results are accurate and reliable. The described set of reference genes can be used in gene expression studies both in normal skin, equine sarcoids and the combination of both. One of the points of interest in veterinary medicine is the expression level of BPV in different kinds of equine sarcoids. With the normalisation technique described in this study, reliable results can be obtained. Another research topic in this domain is the study of BPV expression in normal skin, showing latent infection with BPV. Also, the expression level of specific horse genes with a putative role in tumourigenesis, can be investigated.
