Analytical methodology is an essential component not only in the developmental phase of a drug substance but also in the continuing evaluation of clinical efficacy. The HPLC methods have been applied to pharmacokinetic studies. The pharmacokinetics of wogonin in rats was studied by HPLC after a dose of 5 mg kg −1 by intravenous administration [101] . A biphasic phenomenon with a rapid distribution followed by a slower elimination phase was observed from the plasma concentration time profile. In another report, the metabolism of baicalin in human was studied by HPLC after oral administration of Sho-Saiko-To [102] . Baicalin is one of the major components of Sho-Saiko-To. Baicalein 6-O-sulfate was identified as the metabolite of baicalin. Baicalein 6-Osulfate was detected after 1 h, reached a maximum level at 5 h and then decreased to the level less than the quantitative limit (5 ng ml −1 ) after 36 h, and the plasma level of baicalein 6-Osulfate showed a small peak at 24 h. Baicalin was detected after 1 h, reached a maximum level at 5 h and then decreased to the level less than the quantitative limit (5 ng ml −1 ) after 36 h, and the plasma level of baicalin showed two peaks at 12 h and 24 h. The metabolic pharmacokinetics of baicalin and baicalein in rats were compared [103] . After intravenous administration of baicalein, 75.7% of the dose was circulated as its conjugated metabolites. After oral administration of baicalein, absorption of baicalein itself was negligible, whereas the glucuronides/sulfates of baicalein were predominant in the plasma. When compared with intravenous bolus administration with dose correction, the absolute absorption was 40%. When baicalin was administered orally, glucuronides and sulfates of baicalein were exclusively circulated in the plasma. The relative absorption for baicalin was 65% when compared with baicalein. Profound differences of serum profile and pharmacokinetics were observed between oral baicalein and baicalin. Baicalin demonstrated significantly a time lag to achieve the peak concentration t max , and the lower peak serum concentration (C max ) of baicalein conjugated metabolites compared to baicalein, indicating baicalin was absorbed more slowly and to poorly than baicalein. In addition, the urinary pharmacokinetics of baicalein, wogonin and their glycosides in humans were studied after oral administration of Scutellariae radix [104] . Ten healthy male volunteers received a dose of 5.2 g commercial powder (comparable to 9 g crude drug), respectively. The mean cumulated renal excretion of baicalein glucuronides and sulfates were 43.1 ± 4.5 mol (2.9% of dose) and 64.8 ± 6.3 mol (4.3% of dose), respectively, whereas wogonin glucuronides and sulfates were 21.6 ± 2.0 mol (5.9% of dose) and 20.7 ± 1.7 mol (5.7% of dose), respectively. The renal excretion of conjugated metabolites of wogonin (11.6% of dose) was higher than that of baicalein (7.2% of dose). The baicalein sulfates was predominant than the corresponding glucuronides, whereas wogonin sulfates was comparable to the corresponding glucuronides. The metabolism of active constituents in Huangqin-Tang, a prescription in traditional Chinese medicine, was studied by human intestinal flora [105] . Huangqin-Tang and all individual herbs in the decoctions were incubated with a human fecal suspension separately. The active con-stituents of Huangqin-Tang, including baicalin, wogonoside, oroxylin-A glucuronide, paconiflorin, liquiritin, isoliquirtin and glycyrrhizic acid, were converted to their metabolites baicalein, wogonin, oroxylin-A, paeonimetabolin-I, liquiritigenin, isoliquiritigenin and glycyrrhetinic acid by human intestinal flora. The contents of the metabolites in Huangqin-Tang and in each single herb decoction increased significantly after incubation with intestinal flora. Comparing with single herb decoctions, the transformation of baicalin, wogonoside, oroxylin-A glucuronide, liquiritin and isoliquirtin in the compound prescription was promoted, however, that of paconiflorin and glycyrrhizic acid was inhibited. All the results suggested that the glycosides of many medicinal herbs could be converted to aglycones by human intestinal flora, and the metabolism of most glycosides was improved in the compound prescription. In another report, the pharmacokinetics of multi-constituents in Huangqin-Tang decoction in rats were studied [106] . At different intervals after oral administration of the Huangqin-Tang decoction or a single herb decoction at a dose of 10 g kg −1 , the concentrations of the constituents and their metabolites, baicalin, wogonoside, oroxylin-A glucuronide, baicalein, wogonin, oroxylin-A, paeoniflorin (PF), paeonimetabolin-I, liquiritin, liquiritigenin, glycyrrhizic acid and glycyrrhetinic acid, were detected in the rat plasma by HPLC. There were obvious differences in the pharmacoldnetic parameters of most constituents (especially constituent wogonoside) between the compound prescription and single herb decoction. The constituents in the compound prescription had delayed absorption and elimination, a longer residence time in the body, and higher C max and AUC (0-lim), than those in the single herb decoction. Therefore, they were more efficient and durable, making them promising to exerting pharmacological effects in vivo. The degradation of thirteen flavonoid aglycones-wogonin, diosmetin, hesperetin, baicalein, morin, genistein, daidzein, quercetin, naringenin, luteolin, kaempferol, apigenin and neophellamuretin were investigated in rabbit, rat and human fecal flora suspensions as well as in artificial intestinal juice, using HPLC [107] . The result indicated that all flavonoid aglycones except baicalein, diosmetin and quercetin were stable in artificial intestinal juice, whereas all were degraded in rabbit, rat and human feces suspension. Wogonin and diosmetin were among the less degraded ones for all three feces tested. The presence of a methoxy group on the A or B ring of the flavonoid seems to protect the structure from bacterial degradation. In addition, the bioavailability of baicalin-phospholipid complex was also studied by HPLC [108] . A complex of baicalin with soy phospholipid was prepared to improve the bioabsorption of baicalin. The concentration of baicalin in rat plasma reached a peak of 0.42 g ml −1 at 5.3 h after oral administration, 600 mg kg −1 . However, after intake of its phospholipid complex, a peak of 0.90 g ml −1 occurred at a later time, 6.1 h. The elimination of the complex tended to be slower than that of the free drug. There was a significant difference in the mean area under the concentration-time curves (AUC) between the free drug and the complex (P < 0.01). The HPLC method has been used for quality control of medical products based on S. baicalensis Georgi by the determination of baicalin content in Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China [2] . In addition, the fingerprinting technique on HPLC-UV has been used for quality control of raw medical material of S. baicalensis Georgi [109, 110] . In order to explore more effective herbal products based on S. baicalensis Georgi, more widely pharmacological studies should be carried out to determine new pharmacodynamic effects, such as anti-SARS coronavirus effect of baicalin [18] . Secondly, more attention should be paid to minor components in S. baicalensis Georgi because special pharmacodynamic effects may be found from minor components. Finally, bioactive components at highly purity should be used instead of crude extracts in medicinal preparations. Therefore, separation and purification techniques will play an important role in these studies.
