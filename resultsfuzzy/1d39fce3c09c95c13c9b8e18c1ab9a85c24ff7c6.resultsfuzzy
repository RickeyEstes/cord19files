Histopathological studies in experiment 2 revealed severe denudation and focal infiltration with mononuclear cells; intertubular congestion and intertubular hemorrhage in kidney, severe activation of mucous glands, hyperplasia of lining epithelium with sloughed epithelium and submucosal hemorrhage in trachea and severe focal hemorrhage and lymphoblasts infiltration, thickening of the wall of blood vessels with focal depletion and thickening of the capsule in spleen in group 5.
