A total of 660 students participated in the study. Students who indicated they had diabetes were excluded from the dataset (n = 8). Demographic characteristics of all respondents are shown in Table 1 . The mean BMI of participants was 24.77 ± 5.96 kg/m 2 . More than half (55.9%) of the participants had a body weight within the normal range (18.5-24.9 kg/m 2 ), whereas 4.5% were classified as underweight (<18.5 kg/m 2 ), 24.8% as overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m 2 ), 9.2% as obese class 1 (30-34.9 kg/m 2 ), 2.6% as obese class 2 (35-39.9 kg/m 2 ), and 3.0% as in an extreme weight category (>40 kg/m 2 ) (27). Less than one-fourth (21.5%) of the participants reported having a blood relative with diabetes in their nuclear family, whereas more than half (57.9%) indicated that they had a blood relative with diabetes in their extended family. Eleven of the participants had been diagnosed with diabetes or prediabetes (type 1 diabetes n = 1, type 2 diabetes n = 2, gestational diabetes n = 5, and prediabetes n = 3). A χ 2 test was conducted to test the first hypothesis that more college students think their peers are at risk for type 2 diabetes onset than believe that they are themselves at risk. The results showed that the majority of students (68%) thought their peers were at risk for type 2 diabetes. Significantly more participants believed that their peers were at risk than believed they were themselves at risk (23%) for the disease (χ² =176.076, df = 1, P <0.001). Consequently, this hypothesis was accepted. The first research question sought to determine whether there is a sex-related difference in type 2 diabetes risk perception. Participants (n = 358) who indicated that they did not know their risk for type 2 diabetes onset were omitted from the analyses. The results showed that 358 participants were not sure about their risk for diabetes onset. Of the excluded students, 64% were female, and 36% were male (χ² = 23.520, df = 1, P = 0.000). A total of 105 students (35.0%) were classified as overweight, obese class 1, obese class 2, or extremely obese. The majority of the excluded participants thought their peers were the ones at risk for type 2 diabetes onset ("Others are at risk" 85.8% vs. "I am at risk" 14.2% [χ² = 151.838, df = 1, P = 0.000]). More than half (69%) of the excluded students were Caucasian, 16.3% were African American, 10% were Hispanic, 0.7% were Asian or South Pacific Islander, 0.7% were American Indian/Alaska Native, and 3.3% were of other ethnic or racial backgrounds (χ² = 625.160, df = 5, P = 0.000). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted with the remaining 302 participants to test for sex-related differences. The results showed a statistically significant difference between the means of the sexes (F = 9.472, df = 1, P = 0.002). The second research question sought to identify differences in risk perceptions of type 2 diabetes onset between students who thought they were personally at risk for type 2 diabetes and those who thought other students were at risk. Students who had a lower risk perception (n = 241) exercised an average of 3.68 days/ week. Within this group, 15.8% In addition, 13% of the participants who had low risk perception reported having no daily servings of vegetables, 32.6% reported having 1 daily serving, 30.5% reported having 2 daily servings, 18% reported having 3 daily servings, and 5.9% reported having ≥4 daily vegetable servings. Participants who reported having a blood relative with diabetes in their nuclear family had a moderately high risk perception (mean = 6.58, t = 10.740, df = 306, P = 0.000). In this group, 65 participants indicated that they thought they were at risk for type 2 diabetes, and 69 indicated that their peers were at risk for diabetes onset. African-American (mean = 5.79) and Hispanic (mean = 5.87) participants reported a moderate risk perception of type 2 diabetes onset. Caucasian participants reported a lower risk perception average (mean = 4.88). An ANOVA was conducted to answer the second research question. The results showed a significant difference between the groups ("I am at risk" mean = 6.66 ± 1.05 vs. "Other students are at risk" mean = 4.33 ± 1.37; F = 232.854, df = 1, P = 0.000).
