We performed extensive simulations and investigated the temporal and spatial features of the predicted epidemic. Figs. 2a-d show the aggregated epidemic curves of the full model. Smallpox parameters result in a more protracted epidemic which infects a larger number of people than influenza parameters. Fig. 2e shows the spatial progression of an influenza-like epidemic of the infection at different times in the model realisation, when seeding the epidemic in central London (King's Cross). A spatial wave of infection can clearly been observed spreading out from London and moving north and west.
