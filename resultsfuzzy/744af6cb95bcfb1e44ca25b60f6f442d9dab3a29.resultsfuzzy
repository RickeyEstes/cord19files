We investigated the effects of two zinc salts, ZnCl 2 and ZnSO 4 , on infection of ST cells with TGEV and compared it to the effects of a control salt, MgSO 4 . As a first step, cytotoxic effects of treatment with both Zn salts and MgSO 4 were examined. Both Zn salts caused cytotoxic effects in a concentration-dependent fashion only at high concentrations when applied for 48 h, while no such effect was observed for MgSO 4 . The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) for ST cells treated with ZnCl 2 and ZnSO 4 for 48 h was calculated to be 321 mM and 343 mM, respectively. When Zn salts were only present for 4 h, no cytotoxicity was observed even at the highest concentration of 500 mM (data not shown). For the examination of Zn effects on viral replication, different non-cytotoxic concentration of Zn salts were applied to ST cells infected with a low MOI of 0.1, in order to more closely reflect natural infection, where multiple infection cycles occur. Pretreatment of TGEV with Zn salts under cell-free conditions before infection did not affect the virus yield (Fig. 1a) , which indicates that Zn salts do not inactivate TGEV directly and fail to inhibit receptor binding. For other viruses, Zn was shown to block virus adsorption through deposition onto the virion surface (KÃ¼ mel et al., 1990) or through deposition on the target cells (Suara and Crowe, 2004) . These mechanisms seem to be irrelevant for TGEV as suggested by our results, which may be due to differences in the viral glycoproteins and their receptors, and/or target cells. The addition of Zn salts to ST cells at an early stage of infection (1-4 hpi), when TGEV had been allowed to bind to its receptors but not to enter the cells, led to a significant reduction of viral titers (Fig. 1b) . The mean virus titer in the mock-treated cultures was 10 6.7 TCID 50 /ml (SEM = 0.28log 10 TCID 50 /ml) compared to 10 5.2 TCID 50 /ml (SEM = 0.36log 10 TCID 50 /ml) for ZnCl 2 and 10 5.3 TCID 50 /ml (SEM = 0.08 log 10 TCID 50 /ml) for ZnSO 4 at a concentration of 200 mM. This corresponds to a more than 25-fold reduction in viral titers for Zn treatment. Similar results were observed when Zn salts were added in a later stage of infection (22-24 hpi) after several infection cycles. Virus yields were also significantly reduced at 100 and 200 mM concentrations of each Zn salt (Fig. 1c) . The mean virus titer at 200 mM in the mock-treated cultures was 10 6.7 TCID 50 /ml (SEM = 0.72 log 10 TCID 50 /ml) compared to 10 5.2 TCID 50 /ml (SEM = 0.32 log 10 TCID 50 /ml) for ZnCl 2 and 10 5.1 TCID 50 /ml (SEM = 0.36 log 10 TCID 50 /ml) for ZnSO 4 corresponding to a more than 30-fold reduction in viral titers for Zn treatment. These results suggest that Zn interferes with stages of the viral replication cycle that follow the adsorption of TGEV to its receptor. When added at an early stage of infection (1-4 hpi), Zn might partly block or delay the initial cell entry of TGEV, which is mediated through receptor mediated endocytosis and acid dependent fusion (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2002) . The same could be valid for the entry of newly produced virus, when Zn is added in a later stage of infection (22-24 hpi) after multiple replication cycles. Additionally or alternatively, Zn could also impair stages of viral replication that follow the release of TGEV into the cytoplasm. A possible intracellular target for Zn-mediated inhibition is the viral RNA polymerase which was reportedly inhibited by increasing intracellular Zn ions in case of the SARS-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and other viruses (te Velthuis et al., 2010) . In our study, the relative amount of viral Sprotein RNA detectable in infected cells was significantly reduced by Zn treatment for 1-4 hpi without previous inhibition of virus penetration as shown in Fig. 2 . In case of ZnCl 2 treatment, the reduction was more than 40-fold and in case of ZnSO 4 it was more than 16-fold compared to the viral RNA levels in the untreated wells. We also found the relative amount of viral proteins released from infected cells to be reduced by more than 40% for the early-stage treatment without previous inhibition of virus penetration (Fig. 3) . This reduction of viral proteins could be a result of the inhibition of previous stages of viral replication, but again there is also evidence that Zn could directly inhibit the proteolytic cleavage of viral polypeptides (Korant and Butterworth, 1976) . Potential points of action against TGEV might be a chymotrypsin-like protease that is responsible for the cleavage of polyproteins into functional proteins, and which is highly conserved in coronaviruses (Kuo et al., 2009) , or a papain-like protease which, in case of the SARS-CoV, was shown to be potently inhibited by Zn ions (Han et al., 2005) . The highest reduction in virus yields was observed when Zn was added at 1 hpi following the virus entry and treatment was continued for the whole infection time of 48 h (Fig. 1d) . The mean virus titer in the mock-treated wells was 10 7.3 TCID 50 /ml (SEM = 0.28 log 10 TCID 50 /ml) compared to 10 4.9 (SEM = 0.43 log 10 TCID 50 /ml) for ZnCl 2 at 200 mM (P < 0.05), and 10 5.5 (SEM = 0.43 log 10 TCID 50 / ml) for ZnSO 4 at 200 mM (P < 0.05). In case of ZnCl 2 treatment this parallels a more than 250-fold reduction and in case of ZnSO 4 a more than 60-fold reduction. Presumably the repeated inhibition of one or more viral replication steps could potentiate the antiviral effects of Zn treatment. The observation that the virus yield reduction achieved with the long-term treatment did not reach the potential amount of the combined early and late shortterm treatment, however, might be explained by the fact that the long-term treatment was initiated without prior inhibition of initial virus penetration as is was the case with the early short-term treatment (1-4 hpi), so that this initial reduction is missing. Taken together, the data reported in this report show that Zn salts specifically inhibit the replication of the coronavirus TGEV in a concentration dependent manner. Clearly, further studies are indicated to elucidate the exact mechanisms and the in vivo relevance of those findings. Concerning the potential in vivo application, the present results suggest that Zn salts even if used for a short-term treatment might be therapeutically efficient in early as well as in later stages of coronavirus infections in animals as well as in humans.
