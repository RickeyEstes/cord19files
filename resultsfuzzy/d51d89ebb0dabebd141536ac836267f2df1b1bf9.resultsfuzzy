The electronic supplement provides further details of the results. The results (Table 3) confirm interdependence between the PSMCs' (a) decisions in specialising in microbes which have public good properties (i.e., TS) and their (b) profile of distribution to industry. Specifically, specialisation in TS is positively correlated with an overall provision of microbial strains (TS and non TS) to industry.
