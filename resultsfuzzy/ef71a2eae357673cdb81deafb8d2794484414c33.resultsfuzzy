When the variables of interest are non-stationary or exhibit a unit root, the procedures of conventional econometric technique may not be appropriate (Eagle & Granger, 1987; Enders, 1995) . Granger and Newbold (1974) pointed out that in the presence of non-stationary variables, an OLS regression might become a spurious regression, thereby leading to biased and meaningless results. It is important to test stationarity of time-series data to set up an appropriate methodology in the formation of econometric models (Eagle & Granger, 1987) . As shown in Fig. 1 , in growing economies such as Taiwan, economic time-series data are likely to be nonstationary. Therefore, prior to testing a long-run equilibrium relationship between tourism expansion and economic growth, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (Dickey & Fuller, 1981) and Phillips-Perron (Phillips & Perron, 1988) tests were carried to examine the presence of a unit root for all study variables. Results of both ADF and PP tests for stationarity are reported in Table 2 . Judged by MacKinnon's (1991) critical values, the null hypothesis of one unit root against the alternative of stationarity cannot be rejected in levels of variables, but is rejected in their first differences. In other words, time-series data of LGDP and LTOUR are integrated of the same order 1, Ið1Þ. Therefore, we proceeded with a long-run equilibrium analysis using the cointegration technique. According to Engle and Granger (1987) , the two nonstationary variables that are integrated in the same order are cointegrated if one or more linear combinations that exist between them are stationary. If the two variables are cointegrated, there is a long-run relationship that prevents them from drifting away from each other. In other words, in this study, if LGDP and LTOUR are cointegrated, there is a force of equilibrium that keeps LGDP and LTOUR together in the long run. We applied the procedure developed by Johansen (1988 Johansen ( , 1991 and Johansen and Juselius (1990) to conduct the Vector Autoregression (VAR)-based cointegration test. 6 The Johansen procedure uses two
