The detection rate of viruses by RT-PCR was 457/560 (81.6%) ( The distribution of the viruses per month is shown in Fig. 2 . Peak incidence of FLU in both seasons was in January and February. Other viruses were isolated throughout both winter seasons. The original study was a randomized controlled clinical trial [15] . A chi-square test showed an equal distribution of the virus groups between intervention-(rapid reporting of PCR-results to the clinician) and the control (late reporting) group (data not shown).
