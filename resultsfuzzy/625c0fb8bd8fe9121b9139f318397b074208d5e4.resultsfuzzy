To visualize RV-C-infected cells, human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were differentiated in vitro at an air-liquid interface (ALI) for 30-50 days, and then inoculated with RV-C15 (C15). After 16-18 h, immunofluorescent staining revealed cells with bright cytoplasmic staining for the viral capsid. These C15-positive (C15+) cells were distributed diffusely along the epithelium (Fig. 1a) . Virus-infected cells often appeared rounded, and the brightest C15+ cells were observed above the epithelial layer among the epithelial cilia. Mockinoculated cultures demonstrated a uniform, undisrupted epithelium (Fig. 1b) . Following inoculation, cell-sized holes in the epithelial layer were noted by confocal microscopy just basal to C15+ cells that were not observed in mock-inoculated cultures ( Fig. 1c-f ). In order to determine whether these holes in the epithelium were created by shedding of infected cells, we inoculated HBEC-ALI cultures with a C15 genetically engineered to express GFP during viral replication (C15-GFP) and performed time-lapse fluorescent imaging over the course of 30 h of viral infection (Additional file 1). Cells expressing GFP indeed rounded in place and then detached from the epithelial layer, leaving gaps in the epithelium that subsequently contracted over the course of the experiment.
