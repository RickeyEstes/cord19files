Inscribed sphere or circumscribed sphere? In [1] , we introduced a method that maps a DNA sequence onto a point within the regular tetrahedron (RT). In [2] , we showed that for most genomes, S < 1/3, that is, the mapping points are within the inscribed sphere of the RT. Elhaik et al. claimed that "the inscribed sphere calculations were erroneous", and the conclusion that S < 1/3 and the mapping points are within the inscribed sphere is "a consequence of a mathematical error", because they noted that the radius of the inscribed sphere of the RT involved is 1/4 rather than 1 3 / [5] . Using 235 bacterial genomes, they found that the mapping points of 45% of these genomes were outside the inscribed sphere [5] . Their calculation is incorrect, due to the neglect of a parameter, as shown below. Letting the nucleotide frequencies of A,C, G and T be denoted by a, c, g and t, respectively, and taking the center of the RT as the origin, a coordinate system (X, Y, Z) can be set up [ (1) where X, Y and Z are the coordinates of the mapping point P in this coordinate system. For convenience, we introduced a reduced coordinate system (x, y, z) such that (refer to the equation (3) of the reference [1] ) , . ( Then we have x a g c t y a c g t z a t g c x y z Equation (3) is the one that has been mostly used in related studies. Based on equation (2), where R and r are the radii of the inscribed sphere in the original (X, Y, Z) and the reduced (x, y, z) coordinate systems, respectively. Therefore, in the reduced coordinate system the radius of the inscribed sphere is One can use either the original (X, Y, Z) or the reduced coordinate system (x, y, z), but should use the corresponding radius, R (1/4) or ( 1 3 / ), for the former and latter, respectively. Elhaik et al. used the equation (3) to obtain the coordinates in the reduced coordinate system (x, y, z), but still used R (1/4), the radius in the original system (X, Y, Z) [5] . In other words, their mistake is due to the confusion of the original and reduced coordinate systems. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the mapping points of the 235 bacterial genomes used in [5] . Based on the correct radius, in contrast to their conclusion that 45% of genomes have mapping points outside the inscribed sphere, none has the mapping point outside the inscribed sphere and none has an S value larger than 1/3. Therefore it is the inscribed sphere, as correctly indicated in the original article [2] . The mistake of Elhaik et al. is the confusion of the original and reduced coordinate systems, and consequently, the neglect of the parameter 4 3 / .
