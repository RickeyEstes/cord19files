For any positive blood culture results, we thoroughly reviewed the results, including preliminary reporting and final reporting times. In preliminary results, only gram staining results of the species growing in culture bottle were reported. In the final report, the exact names of the identified pathogens were reported with the antibiotics susceptibility test results. For changes to the antibiotics regimen following the blood culture results, we reviewed the daily antibiotics administration with the exact times until 24 h after the final result report time. For adverse events due to contaminations, we defined the unnecessary administration of vancomycin as the start of administration after the preliminary reports and its discontinuation following the identification of contaminants in the final reports. Additionally, unnecessary followup blood cultures were defined as blood cultures performed after preliminary reports that were confirmed as contaminants in the final reports and the follow-up results were negative. The following isolates were identified as contaminants: coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Bacillus species, Micrococcus species, Corynebacterium species, and Propionibacterium species.
