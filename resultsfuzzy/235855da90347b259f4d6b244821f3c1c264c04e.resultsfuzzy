The PD 50 test was performed to assess the subunit vaccine potency by following the bovine potency test protocol described by the OIE to test the traditional inactivated FMD vaccines. In this research, the result showed the vaccine potency of the batch immunized with the expressed antigens reached 6.34 PD 50 per dose (Table 4 ). Discussion FMD still threatens world livestock production. Seven distinct serotypes of FMDV have been identified, named A, O, C, Asia I, SAT I, SAT and SAT with none cross immune protection occurring between them. The FMDV serotype Asia which was first isolated in Pakistan is epidemic within Southeast Asia and Indian peninsula, disseminating among Near East, Middle East and Far East [22] . In March 2005, FMDV serotype Asia was found in HongKong (Asia I/HNK/CHA/05 strain). Subsequently, this type of the virus was reported from mainland of China in April 2005 [23] . The P1 sequence of Asia 1/HNK/CHA/05 isolate was aligned and compared with 9 reference sequences. The result confirmed that Asia 1/HNK/CHA/05 has a high identity with nine Asia I reference sequences from 85.9 to 92.6% [24] . Expression products of baculovirus expressing system are generally considered to be well immunogenic and possess the ability to assemble empty viral capsid. When the same FMDV expression cassette were expressed in E.coli and baculovirus expression system, the expression products from baculovirus excels that from E.coli in terms of the immunogenic [25] and protective effects [26] . Empty capsid comes into being only when capsid precursor P1-2A, protease L and 3C coding region from FMDV O1K serotype were all expressed in baculovirus expressing system(AcMNPV-Sf cell). Truncated protease L can not be selfcleaved from VP0. But, the expressed protease L is harmful to host cell growth, reducing the expression efficiency [27] . In adenovirus expression system, P12A3C expression cassette, including full structure of P1-2A,3C and portion of 2B and 3B, can be expressed and assembled into empty capsids [8] . Myristoylation of the animo terminus of P1-2A is of great importance to the assembly of viral particles [28] . It has been reported that the expression products of AcMNPV-Sf cell can be myristoylated well [29] . Based on the above studies, and using the design previously published by Mayr et al [8] , the P12A3C expression cassette of FMDV serotype Asia I was constructed. After two sorting rounds of recombinant virus and measurements of expression efficiency for more than 20 viral clones, the over-expressed recombinant virus Bm-P12A3C was obtained. It can express with very high efficiency in the hyperexpression variety of silkworm (JY1). The specific antigen produced per milliliter in silkworm haemolymph at least 100 folds more than the BHK-21 cell vaccine which had a PD 50 value of 3.6. Because cattle are the most important economic and susceptible cloven-hoof animal, we designed an experiment to verify whether this produced antigen can be used for preparing a cattle FMD vaccine. We followed the bovine potency test protocol described by the OIE to test this subunit vaccine potency. We used 1/30 diluted dosage to vaccinate five cattle and two controls were vaccinated with vaccine prepared from BmBacPAK-6's. By two weeks post vaccination, the antibody level of the five vaccinated cattle reached a high titer. The antibody level has some ascension but maintained thereafter two weeks, while the control group maintained lower than titer 8. After virulent homologous virus challenge, four of the five were considered protected, and one delayed the disease and ease the clinical symptom, but two unvaccinated cattle developed lesions on all the feet and in the inside of mouth on the second day. Cell-mediated -immune response was probably involved in the protection: that would explain why animal 45 has the same neutralizing antibody titers as 122 but is not protected. This demonstrated that the expression products from silkworm-baculovirus expression system were immunogenic as well. Based on above result, we did the PD50 test to assess the bovine potency of the subunit vaccine. When employed for routine prophylactic use, the vaccine should contain at least 3 PD 50 per dose for cattle by OIE recommended. The result showed the subunit vaccine potency could get 6.34 PD 50 a dose for cattle. This leads to a conclusion that it is feasible to use the silkworm-baculovirus expression system for FMD vaccine production.
