All of these results are in agreement with the participation of electrogenerated MQI in the Michael addition reaction with BS [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Fig. 1c is the cyclic voltammogram of BS which indicates that in the studied potential range, BS is not electroactive. Controlled-potential coulometry at E app < E pA1 (E app = 0.40 V vs. Ag/AgCl) was used to determine the number of the electrons transferred (n) for the anodic oxidation of MAP in the presence of BS (Fig. 2I) . The cyclic voltammetry during the progress of CPC indicates two significant changes: (i) decreasing I pA1 and (ii) increasing I pA2 . The I pA1 reaches zero when the charge consumption was about 2e âˆ’ (n = 1.95) per molecule of MAP. The CPC was also performed at E app > E pA2 (E app = 0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl) (Fig. 2II ). In comparison with CPC at E app = 0.40, it shows two significant differences: first, the number of electrons is increased from two to four electrons (n = 4.5). Second, both anodic peaks have been removed. Another CPC was performed in the same solvent/electrolyte system containing MAP (0.25 mmol) in the presence of methanesulfinic acid (MS) (0.75 mmol) at E app = 0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl) (Fig. 3) . Contrary to Fig. 2 , during the progress of CPC, a new anodic peak (A 3 ) appeared at more positive potentials than the main wave. Under these conditions, all anodic and cathodic peaks disappear at the end of CPC after consumption of 151 C (n = 6.3) of electricity. The following evidences along with the spectroscopic data of the final products were used to propose the following mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation of MAP at different applied potentials in the presence of sulfone nucleophiles. As indicated in Fig. 4 , when the applied potential is 0.40 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the nucleophilic attack of the sulfone compounds on the electrogenerated MQI would result in INT1-4 which undergoes aromatization to afford the mono sulfonyl-p-(methylamino)phenol derivatives (MSP1-4) as the final products. MSP1-4 is structurally a p-methylaminophenol derivative, however, because of the presence of an electron-withdrawing sulfonyl group in its structure, its oxidation is more difficult than the oxidation of MAP (Fig. 5) and thus, its oxidation at the anode is avoided. With increasing the applied potential to 0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the oxidation of MSP1-4 becomes possible and MSP ox 1-4 is formed. The addition of sulfone nucleophile to MSP ox 1-4 followed by aromatization, converts MSP ox 1-4 into bis sulfonyl-p-(methylamino)phenol derivatives (BSP1-4). Since the oxidation of BSP1-4 is more difficult than the oxidation of MSP1-4 and MAP (Fig. 5 ), its oxidation was stopped due to the presence of the two electron-withdrawing sulfonyl groups as well as the insolubility of BSP1-4 in the electrolysis medium. A remarkable finding in this study is related to the role of methanesulfinic acid (MS) as a nucleophile. Despite several attempts to synthesize BSP4, no bis sulfonyl derivative has been isolated and unexpectedly a tris sulfonyl compound, TSP, which is a new sulphonamide molecule was obtained via the oxidation of BSP4 and attack of MS to electrogenerated BSP ox 4. The oxidation of BSP4 at 0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl, can be related to the lower electron-withdrawing ability of the methyl-sulfony group compared with aryl-sulfony groups that causes the oxidation potentials of bis and tris sulfonyl compounds do not have any significant differences. In addition, higher nucleophilicity and lower steric effect of MS compared with aryl-sulfone nucleophiles and more solubility of the MQI is a bis-Michael acceptor (ortho and meta of the phenolic group) and can be attacked by the sulfone nucleophiles from two sites to yield two isomers (for example, 4-(methylamino)-m-(methylsulfonyl)phenol and 4-(methylamino)-o-(methylsulfonyl) phenoltypes). However, the comparison of simulated 1 H NMR 35 for the possible compounds and experimental 1 H NMR of the final product (See SI), confirms synthesis of ortho derivative. The protonation of the amino group in MAP at pH = 2.0, makes the ortho position in MQI more reactive than meta position for the addition reaction. The compounds MSP1-4 were tested for the antibacterial activity against the Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus) (Fig. 6 ) and Gram negative (Escherichia coli) strains. The results indicated that Staphylococcus aureus was more sensitive to MSP1-4 than Escherichia coli (See SI). The existence of an exterior membrane along with a collection of resisting pumps against drugs in the negative gram bacteria, makes a very effective barrier from this group of bacteria against antibacterial growth and operation. We also found that the antimicrobial activity of MSP derivatives to vary in the order MSP 4 (R=CH 3  The observed homogeneous rate constants (k obs ) of the reaction of MQI with the sulfinic nucleophiles was studied based on ECEC (Fig. 7 , parts I-IV) and EC (Fig. 7 , parts V-VIII) mechanisms, by computer simulation of the experimental cyclic voltammograms. Our data shows that, k obs is strongly dependent to pH so that, it increases with decreasing pH value. The protonation of the nitrogen atom in MQI, makes it more reactive toward the addition reaction and is responsible for increasing k obs . In addition, the results displays that, k obs is also dependent directly to the electron donating ability of the nucleophile, so that, it varies in the order methanesulfinic acid > p-toluenesulfinic acid > banzenesulfinic acid > p-chlorosulfinic acid (Fig. 8 ).
