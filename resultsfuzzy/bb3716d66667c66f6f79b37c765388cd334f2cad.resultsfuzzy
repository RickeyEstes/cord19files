(% Î©/cm 2 ) of H4 Cells over Time. Figure 4 shows changes in TER of H4 cells exposed to T. esculentum extracts, Combivir (AZT), or DMEM with and without RV over time. Over the whole 67 hours, coincubation of RV with bean seed coat extracts (ethanolic extract (MSCE), and water extract (MSCW) or AZT led to higher TER across the cells than when the virus was coincubated with cotyledon extracts (MCE and MCW). Incubation of H4 cells with individual extracts alone or AZT alone resulted in lower TER than extract/AZT-RV coincubation treatments. Incubation of cells with RV alone from the start of the experiment until about 40 hours resulted in TER lower than the rest of the treatments. However between 40 and 67 hours of exposure, wells with RV only treatments generally had higher TER (though sporadic) than the rest of the treatments. All T. esculentum extracts generally had better enhancement of TER than AZT over the initial 67 hours. NO 2 release was significant from human intestinal epithelial cells (H4) exposed to all extracts used {seed coat water and ethanolic extracts (MSCW and MSCE, resp.), cotyledon water and ethanolic extracts (MCW and MCE, resp.), and tuber water extract (MTW)}, while only MCE and MTW significantly increased NO in CLAB cells ( Figure 5 ).
