We examined serums of healthy people with method of double-antigen sandwich ELISA, and found one positive respectively in the 935 servicemen of Hong Kong garrison and in the 158 servicemen of the Macao garrison. But when we tested the two positive samples with method of IFA, we found that they were negative. We detected 160 Health care workers in Peking with ELISA to find that they were all negative. And we detected 200 healthy people in Guangzhou area with both methods of ELISA and IFA, and the results were all negative. Details of the result were listed in Table 1 . There were 257 SARS cases diagnosed by ELISA. We followed 43 cases of them (after onset of disease, 3-360 days), the result showed that serum IgG antibodies titer was lifted with time went on in the first 4 to 6 months, most of the patients' antibodies lift to the top at the 6th month. Most of them reached the peak in the 6th month, and a part of them began to drop down but still keep the positive tow years (Figure 1 and Figure 2 ). dIscussIOns So far, we know nothing about how SARS came to be and what its infectant and epidemiological rules are. Seroepidemiological Study is the important method to study infectious disease and the prevalence rules. In order to cognize roundly the rules of Serum IgG antibodies and infection charts after onset of SARS, Indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) and double-antigen sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect in sera of 1710, including 1453 healthy populations and 257 SARS patients from Guangzhou and Peking. ELISA method was used to detect the serum samples of 1453 healthy population, including 160 that closely contacted with SARS patients, and only 0.14% of them showed positive SARS-CoV IgG. Due to the false positive result of ELISA, we validated further two positive SARS-CoV IgG serums of them by IFA only to find that the result was negative. We didn't find positive antibodies in 200 serums from Guangzhou district using both IFA and ELISA. This made clear that not the recessive infectious of SARS in the health people. This study result showed that, of the clinical SARS infected patients in Feb. and Mar. of 2003, at least 90% could be confirmed by serology method. However, we may miss many cases if we detect SARS-CoV IgG antibodies by serology method at the early stage of the disease (first 10 days). Ten days later, serums antibodies appeared in most patients and the results by IFA and ELISA were identical. From the study, we got to the conclusion that the serology method, especially the IFA, has great diagnostic value for the dubious patients diagnosed in clinic and epidemiology (4). Therefore, double serums detection was obviously necessary in SARS lab diagnosis. By detecting 257 SARS patients from 3 to 360 days after onset of SARS, we found that their serum antibodies titers increased steadily in 4to 6 months (5). The antibodies of most patients reached the peak in the 6th month and lasted to the 24th month. The antibodies of some patients began to descend after reaching the peak. Though the antibody could be detected positive on the 360th day, the titer declined. This study put forward that the duration of SARS-CoV IgG would last for more than 2 year. We will further trace the falling curve of SARS-CoV IgG antibodies.
