An overall summary of the statistically significant results ( Table 1) illustrates that PEDV infection of gilts at different stages of gestation (Figure 1 ) affects multiple maternal systemic immune parameters prepartum, including natural killer (NK) cells, cytokines, B cells, and PEDV Abs and antibody secreting cells (ASCs). In addition, significant postpartum effects on lactogenic immune parameters in colostrum and milk were observed including significantly increased PEDV IgA (colostrum and milk) and IgG (colostrum only) ASCs and PEDV IgA Abs and VN Abs in PEDV-infected second trimester gilts ( Table 1) . Notably several gilt [PEDV IgA (colostrum and milk) and IgG (colostrum only) ASCs, Abs, and VN Abs] and piglet (serum PEDV IgA and IgG Abs) parameters were positively correlated with piglet survival rates ( Table 2) , demonstrating the association between IgA ASCs and Abs and VN Abs and lactogenic immune protection of suckling neonates. The detailed results for each parameter are described in the following sections. Third Trimester Gilts Had Significantly Higher PEDV RNA Shedding Titers and More Severe PEDV-Induced Diarrhea Third trimester gilts had significantly higher PEDV RNA shedding titers at PID 2 compared with second trimester gilts (Figure 2A) . Additionally, second trimester gilts had delayed onset of PEDV RNA shedding compared with first and third trimester gilts. Fecal consistency scores at PID 4 were significantly higher in third compared with second and first trimester gilts and third trimester gilts were the only treatment group with clinical diarrhea (mean fecal consistency score of >1) ( Figure 2B ). To determine the effect of stage of gestation at time of PEDV infection on lactogenic immune protection, piglets were challenged with PEDV at 3-5 days of age. The number of viable piglets born were not statistically significant between treatment groups ( Figure S5 ). Second trimester PEDV infection of gilts resulted in 100% survival of PEDV challenged piglets ( Figure 7A ). First trimester gilts provided intermediate protection (87.2% survival) while third trimester gilts provided the least amount of protection (55.9% survival) among PEDVinfected gilts. Mock piglet's survival rate (5.7%) was significantly lower than all other treatment groups. Comparison of piglet weight gain revealed second trimester litters gained significantly more weight than all other treatment groups starting at post challenge day (PCD) 4 and lasting throughout the experiment ( Figure 7B ). First trimester litters had significantly higher normalized weights than third trimester litters at PCD 6, 7, and 9, but were similar thereafter. Mock litters were stunted (decreased or no weight gain) from PCD 1-7 and had the lowest normalized weights throughout the study. Lactogenic immune protection coincided with decreased PEDV RNA shedding titers where mean peak titers were 6.1 ± 0.2 log 10 copies/ml, 7.8 ± 0.3 log 10 copies/ml, 9.1 ± 0.3 log 10 copies/ml, and 10.1 ±.2 log 10 copies/ml for second, first, third, and mock litters, respectively ( Figure 7C ). Corresponding to increased weight gain and decreased PEDV RNA shedding titers, diarrhea scores were significantly lower in second trimester litters throughout the study ( Figure 7D ). While first trimester litters had diarrhea, it was delayed and significantly lower than third trimester litters at PCD 2-5. Mock litters had diarrhea immediately at PCD 1, lasting through PCD 11 and diarrhea scores were significantly higher than all other treatment groups. Gilt mean PEDV RNA shedding titers and fecal consistency scores were measured post piglet challenge. Mock gilt PEDV RNA shedding titers were significantly higher at PCD 2-7 than first, second and third trimester PEDV-infected gilts and remained numerically higher until PCD 17 ( Figure S6A) . Additionally, first trimester gilt PEDV RNA shedding titers peaked at PCD 4, earlier compared with second and third trimester gilts ( Figure S6A ). Mock gilt fecal consistency scores were significantly higher at PCD 5-11 compared with first, second and third trimester PEDV-infected gilts ( Figure S6B) . Diarrhea was not observed in previously PEDV-infected gilts post piglet challenge ( Figure S6B ).
