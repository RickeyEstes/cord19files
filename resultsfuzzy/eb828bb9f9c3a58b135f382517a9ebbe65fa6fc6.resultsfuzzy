A total of 1398 studies were obtained from the initial search of the After the full-text assessment, 125 studies were included in the final review. Studies were mostly excluded based on full-text assessment because they did not focus on POC diagnostics (n = 81), but instead described a tool, strategy or guideline to support POC testing. The PRISMA flow diagram of the search is presented in Appendix A. From the 125 studies in the synthesis set, 195 test evaluations were identified. The percentage that each determinant was reported in the test evaluations are provided in Figure 1 , together with the overall weight of each determinant as found by. 12 The four determinants that were reported the most were turn-around-time (n = 105; 52.2%), technical performance (n = 97; 48.3%), positive predictive value (n = 91; 45.3%) and negative predictive value (n = 89; 44.3%). The determinants reported the least in the evaluations were room for innovation (n = 0; 0%) and risks (n = 1; 0.5%), followed by reimbursement (n = 2; 1.0%), legislations (n = 3; 1.5%) and scientific evidence (n = 3; 1.5%). Each of these POCTs has at least one test evaluation. The most frequently evaluated tests were those measuring HbA1c (n = 14;
