The influences of supplementing a blend of prebiotics, probiotics, and hyperimmune dried egg protein on the performance, health, and innate immune responses of Holstein calves during the first 21 d of age were investigated. The study was conducted in February 2010. The average low and high temperatures during the study period were −1.8 and 9.8°C, respectively. At enrollment there were no differences in initial BW or total serum protein between treatments (Table 2 ). There were no differences observed in the performance of calves between treatments (Table 2) . Among all calves, there was a negative ADG during the first week, −0.261 kg/d, which was then positive from d 7 to 21, 0.426 kg/d. These results are similar to those of Hill et al. (2008) , wherein they observed no difference in ADG from birth through wean-ing when calves were supplemented with either 4 or 8 g/d of a prebiotic fructo-oligosaccharide (Ultra-FOS, Encore Technologies LLC, Minneapolis, MN). In addition, Heinrichs et al. (2003) did not observe any differences in ADG when Holstein calves were supplemented with 4 g/d of a prebiotic (Bio-Mos, Alltech, Nicholasville, KY); however, they did observe a postweaning increase in calf starter intake among calves fed the prebiotics. In contrast to the present data, Abe et al. (1995) observed increases in ADG and efficiency of BW gains when Holstein calves were either administered 3 × 10 9 cfu/d of the probiotic Bifidobacterium pseudolongum M-602 or L. acidophilus LAC-300 in the milk replacer. In addition, Cruywagen et al. (1996) reported that supplementing milk replacer with 5 × 10 7 cfu/d of L. acidophilus prevented the loss in BW that is often observed in dairy calves during the first 1 to 2 wk of life. In contrast, Morrill et al. (1995) did not observe any increase in performance when Holstein calves were supplemented with a probiotic (Biomate, Chr. Hansen, Milwaukee, WI); however, they did observe an increase in performance when a portion of the protein in the milk replacer was replaced with spray-dried plasma from either porcine or bovine sources. In contrast, when Quigley et al. (2002) replaced either 16 or 20% of the CP in the milk replacer with spray-dried bovine plasma, they did not see any improvements in ADG from 0 to 28 d of age. The present data, when taken together with past literature, indicate that the influence that prebiotics and probiotics, as well as supplemental proteins, have on the performance of Holstein calves is variable. Milk replacer refusal was inversely proportional to age during the first 4 d of life, after which a refusal was rare and associated only with a morbid calf. There was no influence of treatment on the proportion of calves that refused milk replacer during the first 4 d of age (57 vs. 51% for control and prophylactic, respectively; P = 0.589). However, among calves that did refuse milk replacer, the prophylactic calves refused less milk replacer during that period (Table 2) . Therefore, the prophylactic treatment lessened the intensity of milk refusal among calves that refused milk replacer. The underlying mechanism of the seemingly improved appetite among those calves that refused milk replacer during the first 4 d of life is unknown but could be attributed to less severe enteric disease. Enteric morbidity, classified as having consecutive days with fecal scores ≥3, was more common among control calves than among prophylactic calves (Table 3) . These data are consistent with the literature. Inclusion of prebiotics (Heinrichs et al., 2003) , probiotics (Abe et al., 1995; Görgülü et al. 2003) , and hyperimmunized egg protein (Ikemori et al., 1997; Hennig-Pauka et al., 2003) improved fecal scores and reduced scours. However, as with performance, data on the influences of prebiotics, probiotics, and hyperimmune proteins on enteric health are equivocal. Hill et al. (2008) did not observe any improvement in scours in calves less than 2 mo of age when milk replacer was supplemented with fructo-oligosaccharides. In addition, Cruywagen et al. (1996) did not observe improvements in the incidence of enteric morbidity when calves were supplemented with 5 × 10 7 cfu of L. acidophilus. The age when scours were observed was not different between treatments (Table 3) . Scours are a nonspecific symptom of enteric disease, and the etiology of spontaneous calf scours is complex and often involves more than one infectious agent, including various bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Because the clinical signs of scours are nonspecific, causative agents are difficult to ascertain without directly examining the fecal microbiota ecology. Age of the calf is usually the best diagnostic indicator, with E. coli being the major pathogen during the first week of life and rotavirus and cryptosporidiosis appearing in the calf etiology during the second and third weeks of life (Blood, 2000) . Future research should determine whether the prophylactic treatment used in the current study has different efficacies on different combinations of pathogens and ages of the calf. Finally, the duration of scours among calves that developed scours was not different between treatments (Table 3) . Control calves that scoured were treated with oral doses of antimicrobials, whereas scouring prophylactic calves were not treated with antimicrobials but were instead administered additional doses of the probiotics. It remains to be determined if the probiotics or additional probiotics during enteric disease improve recovery from the disease and, therefore, could be used as an alternative therapeutic to antimicrobials in the treatment of bacterial scours. In children, a meta-analysis on the influence of Lactobacillus spp. as a therapy in the treatment of acute diarrhea indicated a 0.7-d reduction in diarrhea duration as well as diarrhea frequency (Van Niel et al., 2002) . However, not all probiotics may be equally effective. In children with acute diarrhea, 5 different probiotics were evaluated in addition to oral rehydration therapy, and only one of the probiotics shortened the duration of diarrhea (Canani et al., 2007) . Therefore, the proof of efficacy of each probiotic species or strain needs to be determined through research, and generalizations across strains or species should be limited to the development of hypotheses. Treatment did not influence total peripheral blood leukocyte or differential counts (Table 3 ). In addition, there were no differences in hematocrit or plasma concentrations of haptoglobin, cortisol, glucose, or urea nitrogen (Table 3 ). These data indicate that the prophylactic treatment did not influence the systemic physiology of the calves during the first 21 d of life. The reduction in the proportion of peripheral leukocytes as neutrophils as well as the decreased plasma haptoglobin over time (data not shown) indicated either maturation of systemic physiology or adaptation of the calves to the ex utero environment. It cannot be determined whether the age-related changes in peripheral neutrophil counts or plasma haptoglobin concentrations were due to lower immunogenic stimulation or reduced stress. Mortality rate in the current study was low; only one calf died (7-d-old control calf). In addition, only 2 calves (1 in each treatment) were classified as severely ill, laterally recumbent and completely anoretic (6 and 9 d old for control and prophylactic, respectively). Therapeutic treatment of severely ill calves included ceftiofur hydrochloride (Excenel, Pfizer Animal Health, New York, NY), flunixin meglumine (Banamine, Intervet/ Schering-Plough), and subcutaneous lactated Ringer's solution. Therefore, the incidence of systemic infection was likely low. Thus, low calf morbidity rates in the present study did not allow for any potential benefits on systemic variables or mortality to be expressed. Future research should evaluate the potential of the prophylactic treatment used in the current study to reduce mortality on a group of high-risk, experimentally challenged, or immunocompromised (e.g., no colostrum) calves. There are many plausible mechanisms explaining the reduced incidence of enteric morbidity when milk replacer fed to calves is supplemented with a combination of prebiotics, probiotics, and hyperimmune pro- teins. These include neutralization of potential pathogens (Bernet et al., 1994; Hennig-Pauka et al., 2003) , direct bactericidal activity (Midolo et al., 1995) , and immune modulation (Blum et al., 2002; Lomax and Calder, 2009 ). In the current study, there was no influence of treatment on the innate immune responses of peripheral leukocytes of Holstein calves when evaluated at 21 d of age (Table 4) . These data agree with the findings of Letellier et al. (2001) where prebiotics and probiotics alone or in combination did not influence peripheral blood phagocyte function in neonatal piglets. However, the roles that prebiotics and probiotics play in immune modulation are inconclusive and are likely influenced by many environmental factors (Blum et al., 2002; Lomax and Calder, 2009) . Regardless, the current data indicate that the benefits of a combined prebiotics, probiotics, and hyperimmune egg protein supplement on reducing enteric morbidity during the first 21 d of age are not likely associated with increases in nonspecific immune responses of Holstein calves.
