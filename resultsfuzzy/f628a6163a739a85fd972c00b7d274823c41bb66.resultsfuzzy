We explore the effects of different assumptions about speed and effectiveness of asymptomatic transmission on the importance of asymptomatic transmission and estimates of the basic reproduction number R 0 , using a gamma assumption (see Methods). Across the range of parameters we explore, the intrinsic proportion of asymptomatic transmission z is similar to the realized proportion q ( Figure 1A ). As the relative mean generation interval of asymptomatic transmission,Ḡ a /Ḡ s , increases, q decreases because symptomatic cases are .

Figure 1B shows the effect of different assumptions about the generation interval of asymptomatic cases,Ḡ a , on the basic reproduction number R 0 . WhenḠ a is long compared toḠ s , then we are effectively assuming a longer mean for the overall generation interval. This assumption leads to a larger estimate of R 0 for a fixed value of r (see [13] ). Conversely, whenḠ a <Ḡ s , generation intervals are shorter, leading to lower estimates of the epidemic strength R 0 . Both of these effects are stronger when the intrinsic proportion of asymptomatic transmission z increases (and disappear as z → 0). Therefore, when R 0 is estimated without explicitly accounting for asymptomatic spread (white, dashed line in Figure 1B) , it can be over-or under-estimated depending on the relative duration of infection between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The qualitative effects of z andḠ a /Ḡ s on q and R 0 remain robust when we assume narrower (κ s = κ a = 0.3; Figure S1 ) or wider (κ s = κ a = 0.8; Figure S2 ) generation intervals. Relative generation-interval dispersion of asymptomatic cases κ a /κ s have similar, but smaller, effects on q and R 0 ( Figure S3 ). Since a wider generation-interval distribution has a higher proportion of early transmission than a narrow one, increasing the generationinterval dispersion has qualitatively similar effects on q and R 0 as decreasing the mean generation interval.
