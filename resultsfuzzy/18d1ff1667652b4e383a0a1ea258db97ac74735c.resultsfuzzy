Recent advances in System Biology, especially in the context of high-throughput DNA sequencing (genomics), gene expression (transcriptomics), metabolite and ion analysis (metabolomics/ionomics) and protein analysis (proteomics) carries with it the challenge of processing and interpreting the accumulating data sets [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] . Publicly accessible databases and bioinformatic tools are employed to mine this data in order to filter relevant correlations and create models describing physiological states [90] . Reconstructing the networks of interactions of the various cellular components as enzyme activities and complexes, gene expression, metabolite pools or pathway flux modes is therefore possible. However, capturing the interactions of network elements requires experimental setups with a variety of conditions [90, [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] . The ultimate goal of systems biology in the context of plant research is to understand the molecular principles governing plant responses and consistently explain plant physiology [90, 100, 101] . These approaches were described in detail in this very journal in the 2001-2008 period. Recent studies of protein-protein interactions focused on using some global sequence or structural features. For example Sprinzak et al. [35] presented a linear regression method trained on nine global protein attributes, such as domain signature, fold type, gene fusion, phylogenetic profile, gene context, conservation of neighboring genes, protein localization, type of molecular pathway, mRNA coexpression, or transcription coregulation. A protein could then be represented as points in nine-dimensional space using those features, and linear regression was applied. The problem is very complicated and non-trivial. Proper selection of the protein domain is necessary [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] . In addition to pure chemical data [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] in the context of the Drug Discovery [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] , there is also a need for some knowledge on protein-protein interactions, the high quality structural prediction of proteins [2, [128] [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] and their inhibitors, and a detailed understanding of how those inhibitors affect the molecular recognition between proteins. The development of theoretical methods for function annotation clearly shows that a detailed analysis of local characteristics of the protein chain can significantly improve accuracy. Recently published papers [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] [142] use local sequence description with some structural features (for example relative solvent accessibility RSA) for much more efficient training of machine learning methods. In the work of Meller et al. [84] , the authors tested the whole set of machine learning methods (neural networks, support vector machines and linear discrimination). Those methods were trained on the stable protein complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). This work strongly supports the use of machine learning methods and the local representation of proteins. The authors obtained almost 70% accuracy of protein-protein interaction prediction, provided the structures of the interaction partners were known. The next step in the development of computational methods is based on several structural features of both interacting partners predicted from a sequence. The sequences can be represented as sets of short fragments with a known homology profile (build for the whole proteins). Such an approach was first used by Ofran and Rost in 2003 [68] , and later by Fernandez-Ballester and Serrano [143] as position-specific multiple-sequence alignment matrixes. Both broad types of interactions (stable and transient) are described as interactions between some key amino acids of both partners. The proper selection of important interacting residues allows for the performance of more certain predictions. Therefore, the analysis of contact maps in protein complexes with predicted local structural conformation of the main chain enriched by homology profiles will allow the collection of a more natural training set for machine learning methods. The proper representation of both the sequence and structure of the interacting partners is of crucial importance for the further development of bioinformatics computational methods for protein-protein interaction prediction [144, 145] . The sequence-based methods typically search for homologues of both interacting proteins with tools such as PSI-BLAST [26] or RPS-BLAST. If some interacting partners are present in both sets, the protein pair is likely to interact. Those methods are not yet sensitive enough in the case of distant homology. Some proteins from large and diverse superfamilies are dissimilar in terms of sequence: only a fold and a few important residues in an active site are preserved [146] . The lack of clear sequence similarity makes new family identification or function prediction more difficult. Protein-protein interaction prediction is also more complex when no close interacting homologs are known. Structure-based methods have a very limited area of usefulness due to their dependence on known structures of protein-protein complexes. Therefore, more sensitive sequence (eg.: Meta-BASIC at http://basic.bioinfo.pl/ [2] ) or structure prediction methods (like those coupled in the Protein Structure Prediction Meta Server http://BioInfo.PL/Meta/ [133, 147, 148] ) will be a significant improvement over standard sequence-based methods, even without knowledge of the exact threedimensional structures of the interacting partners. Other types of approach focus on predicting protein-protein interactions using protein-protein interaction network topology [149, 150] . In their approach, a spectral method derived from graph theory is used to select the topological substructures of protein-protein interaction networks that are biologically relevant functional groups. The function of uncharacterized proteins is then assigned based on the classification of known proteins within topological structures [149] . The clusters can also be identified by an eigenmode analysis of the connectivity matrix of the protein-protein interaction network. Such functional clustering allows for further prediction of new protein interactions [150] . The structural matching is also used to recognize protein-protein interaction sites in protein structures [151] . Prism (http://gordion.hpc.eng.ku.edu.tr/prism) uses protein interface structures derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for the automated prediction of protein-protein interactions. Both structure and sequence conservation in protein interfaces are employed providing additional insight into the protein-protein interaction predictions [152] . The InterPreTS server http://www.russell.embl.de/cgi-bin/interprets2, given a pair of query sequences, searches for homologs in a database of interacting domains (DBID) of known three-dimensional complex structures. Pairs of sequences homologous to a known interacting pair are then scored for how well they preserve the atomic contacts at the interaction interface [153] [154] [155] . Up to now, all the computational algorithms have only used single machine learning methods for the analysis and prediction of protein-protein interactions [156] [157] [158] [159] [160] , or the statistical analysis of interacting patches of protein surfaces [75, 149, 161, 162] . Our experience clearly supports the idea that each machine learning algorithm performs better for selected types of training data [163, 164] . Some have very high specificity, others focus more on sensitivity. Sometimes one can have a very large number of positives in training, but it is also common for some specific types of experiments with only a few confirmed instances known. In most cases, the proper selection of negatives is not trivial. In the case of protein-protein interactions, one should use a rich variety of input data for training, such as sequences, short sequence motifs, evolutionary information, genomic context, enzymatic classification, or the known or predicted local or global structure of interacting proteins. Using this data, one can apply various types of machine learning methods trained on the same set of positives and negatives, for example neural networks, the support vector machine, the random forest, decision trees, or rough sets. The crucial step of meta-prediction is building a consensus between those various prediction methods. Since systematic errors of multiple methods are usually randomly distributed, the consensus approach can be used to select a common prediction, probably the most accurate one [165] . Thanks to its easy parallelization, a consensus method can improve the accuracy of any single machine learning method without extending the time of prediction (the time needed is equal to the slowest used machine learning algorithm). The combination of various approaches done by Sen and Kloczkowski [166] provides the solid justification for this statement. They combine four different methods, such as data mining using Support Vector Machines, threading through protein structures, prediction of conserved residues on the protein surface by analysis of phylogenetic trees, and the Conservatism of Conservatism method of Mirny and Shakhnovich [167] [168] [169] . A consensus method predicts protein-protein interface residues by combining sequence and structure-based methods. Therefore, we hypothesize that consensus approaches are the main tools to handle the prediction of protein-protein interactions on the whole proteome level, the ultimate goal of system biology.
