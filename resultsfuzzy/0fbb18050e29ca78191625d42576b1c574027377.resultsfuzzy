We designed 5 full LAMP primers sets targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with amplicon regions designed to the 5′ region of the ORF1a gene and Gene N. Each set was tested with synthetic DNA substrates and RNA transcribed from that DNA substrate before consideration for use clinically. To evaluate detection sensitivity, synthetic RNAs were serially diluted from ~120 million copies down to ~120 copies (per 25 μ L reaction) at 10fold intervals in LAMP reactions. All five primer sets showed similar detection sensitivity and could consistently detect as low as a few hundred copies, with sporadic detection of 120 copies (or 4.8 copies/μL; Fig. 1 ). The results from colorimetric detection were 100% in agreement with the real time detection. To estimate the relative efficiency using RNA or DNA templates, we compared synthetic RNA with similarly diluted gBlock dsDNA on real-time LAMP signal (Fig. 2) . For the 2 primer sets we compared, one showed slightly slower amplification and detection with RNA template while the other appeared slightly faster, confirming the RNA is efficiently converted to cDNA by the reverse transcriptase (WarmStart RTx) and subsequently amplified via LAMP by the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (Bst 2.0 WarmStart). .

This will of course enable maximum efficiency and sensitivity but requires skill and instrumentation in addition to adding extra time to the diagnostic workflow. We investigated whether it is possible to perform detection using crude cell lysate in order to avoid this RNA purification step. The results indicated that ~480 copies were detected with all four primer sets, a similar sensitivity as the detection sensitivity with synthetic RNA alone (Fig. 3A) with no interference by the lysate to either the amplification efficiency or visual color change. We also tested whether we could recover the synthetic RNA spiked into biological sample with a mock experiment during purification of total RNA. We spiked various amount of synthetic RNA into whole human blood and purified the total blood RNA. We were able to recover and detect the spiked RNA (Fig. 3B) , indicating the total RNA has no interference during the purification or the detection process. While the column-based approach is less compatible with the simple, field detection enabled by colorimetric LAMP, this is a typical laboratory workflow and can be used with simple isothermal amplification in a similar fashion to more expensive and involved qPCR detection workflows. With this preliminary evaluation of potential LAMP primer sets, the best performing sets (ORF1a-A, GeneN-A) were shared and synthesized in Wuhan for testing with actual COVID-19 samples. RNA was extracted from swabs using the standard laboratory protocol (see Materials and Methods) and RNA tested in colorimetric RT-LAMP alongside a commercial RT-qPCR assay. In addition to controls, a total of 7 patient RNA samples were tested, 6 of which were determined to be positive by RT-qPCR using ORF1a primers (C q 25-36.5, Table 2 ) and 4 positive with Gene N primers. One sample was negative by both RT-qPCR primer sets. When these samples were tested in the colorimetric LAMP assay, all 6 RT-qPCR positive samples showed visible color change indicating positive amplification, while the single RT-qPCR negative samples maintained pink color and was judged negative (Figure 4 ). Thus the colorimetric LAMP assay showed 100% agreement with the RT-qPCR results across a range of C q values. Although a small number of samples were tested here, the colorimetric LAMP assay enables reliable SARS-CoV-2 detection without sophisticated instrumentation, matching the RT-qPCR performance in field and point-of-care settings. .

Not only purified RNA can be used as the sample input, but also direct tissue or cell lysate may be used without an RNA purification step. This combination of a quick sample preparation method with an easy detection process may allow the development of portable, field detection in addition to a rapid screening for point-of-need testing applications. This virus represents an emerging significant public health concern and expanding the scope of diagnostic utility to applications outside of traditional laboratories will enable greater prevention and surveillance approaches. The efforts made here will serve as a model for inevitable future outbreaks where the use of next generation portable diagnostics will dramatically expand the reach of our testing capabilities for better healthcare outcomes.
