A one-step RT-PCR assay, which targets a 603 bp fragment of the M gene in the BToV, detected three positive fecal samples from three herds. The nested PCR assay, which targeted a 409 bp fragment of the M gene, detected 19 positive fecal samples (2.9%) from 19 herds (6.9%). The calculated percentage of BToV infections in the diarrheic calves in South Korea was comparatively low compared with that reported in other countries, where the reported fecal prevalence of the BToV in calf diarrhea was 5% in Lower Saxony, Germany (Liebler et al., 1992) , 6.5% in Japan (Ito et al., 2007) , 9.7% in the USA (Hoet et al., 2003a) , and 36.4% in southern Ontario, Canada (Duckmanton et al., 1998a) . This suggests that BToV infections are sporadic in diarrheic calves in South Korea. Of the 19 BToV-positive fecal specimens from the 19 calf herds, 4 fecal samples from 4 herds tested positive to the BToV alone, while the other 15 BToVpositive fecal samples from the 15 herds also tested positive to other enteric pathogens (Table 2 ). This suggests that other bovine enteric pathogens play an important role in the clinical and pathological presentation of this disease. An increase in the severity of the disease after a natural co-infection with other bovine enteric pathogens has been reported (Duckmanton et al., 1998a; Hoet et al., 2003a) . Seasonally, BToV infections were less prevalent in the diarrheic fecal samples of calves obtained in the spring than in the other seasons (Table 2) ; 4 (1.0%) out of 407 fecal samples tested positive in spring; 1 (1.4%) out of 73 fecal samples tested positive in autumn; 2 (3.4%) out of 58 fecal samples tested positive in winter; and 7 (6.5%) out of 107 fecal samples tested positive in summer. This result is very similar to that reported by Hoet et al. (2003a) , who showed that two peaks of BToV shedding were observed, one during the winter months and the other during the summer season. Thirteen nested PCR products were selected, purified and sequenced directly, and their nt and aa sequences were compared with those of other known toroviruses (Table 1) . Table 3 shows the sequence relationships of the nt and aa of the partial M gene among the torovirus strains. Interestingly, a comparison of the nt and aa sequences among the BToVs revealed all the Korean BToVs to share 100% nt and aa Table 3 Sequence relationships of the nucleotide and amino acid of the partial membrane gene among torovirus strains identity to each other, except for the K96 strain (99.0% nt and 98.8% aa identity). In order to eliminate cross contamination, the negative control for RT-PCR and nested PCR was used when the field diarrheic fecal samples were analyzed by RT-PCR and nested PCR. However, there was no positive reaction detected in this negative control. Therefore, this identical nt and aa sequence homology of the M gene among the Korean BToVs might be due to the fact that the positive fecal samples used for DNA sequencing originated from the same county, Muan, even though they had been sampled from different farms at different times (Tables 2 and 3 ). The Korean BToVs shared higher nt and aa sequence homology to the Japanese BToVs (98.5-99.5% nt and 98.5-100% aa identity) and the Dutch BToVs (98.3-99.3% nt and 99.3-100% aa identity) than the Italian (96.6% nt and 99.3-100% aa identity) and American (96.6% nt and 98.5-99.3% aa identity) BToVs. In addition, the BToVs including the American, European, Japanese and Korean BToVs had a lower nt and aa identity to the equine torovirus strain, Berne (43.2-44.9% nt and 9.8-10.5% aa identity), than to porcine toroviruses (78.2-81.2% nt and 88.9-91.1% aa identity). From these results, the Korean BToVs were more closely related to the Japanese and Dutch BToVs than to the American and Italian BToVs. In addition, the overall nt and aa sequence homology of the BToV M gene in this study is higher than of the spike (S) protein gene (Ito et al., 2007; Koopmans and Horzinek, 1994) . The relative conservation of the M protein of all BToVs suggests that the structural constraints on this protein are stern, resulting in more limited evolution of this protein than the S protein (Koopmans and Horzinek, Fig. 1 . A phylogenetic tree of the nucleotide sequence of the M gene of the bovine torovirus strains was made using the neighbor-joining method of Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (Kumar et al., 2004) . The names of the viruses used are listed in Table 1. 1994). Therefore, future studies will be needed to generate more information on the genetic diversity by including other parts of the genome particularly the S gene as well as including the fecal specimens from other regions in South Korea. Generally, phylogenetic data of nt sequence of the partial BToV M gene revealed that the Korean BToV strains were closely related to the Japanese and Dutch BToV strains (Fig. 1) . Of the Korean BToV strains, all Korean BToV strains clustered together with the exception of the K96 strain, which clustered on a separate branch with the Japanese BToV strains, K-674 and K-676. Other Japanese and Dutch BToVs made separate branches. In addition, the American Breda and the Italian B6 strains clustered on a separate major branch, suggesting these were the most distantly related to the other known BToV strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the aa sequence did not show any significant classification of the BToVs because the homology of the aa sequence among the BToV strains was higher than that of the nt sequence (data not shown). This data supports the above mentioned hypothesis that the Korean BToVs were more closely related to the Japanese and Dutch BToVs than to the American and Italian BToVs. South Korea imports live cows mainly from countries in North American and Oceania, not from Japan and European countries. Hence, the similarity in phylogenetic data on the Korean BToV with the Japanese and Dutch BToVs is quite surprising. Therefore, continuous monitoring and intensive studies will be needed for a more detailed characterization of the BToV with other genes. In conclusion, BToV infections are sporadic in diarrheic calves in South Korea. Based on the partial sequence of the BToV M gene, the Korean BToVs were more closely related to the Japanese and Dutch BToVs than to the American and Italian BToVs. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the detection of BToV shedding and its genetic diversity in diarrheic calves in South Korea.
