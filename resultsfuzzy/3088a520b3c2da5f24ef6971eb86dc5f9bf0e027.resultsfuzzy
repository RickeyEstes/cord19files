Three experimental runs for each sterile water and virus maintenance fluid were undertaken and the results of the SARS virus decay are shown in Table 1 . As is seen, the natural decay of the microorganisms during first 2 h of operation was around 0.75 and 1.25 lg in average for virus maintenance fluid and water, respectively. Even after 4 h of run, the viral decay in maintenance fluid was in average of 1.76 lg. On the other hand, a much higher decay rate of the SARS virus (2.58 lg) was observed for the bubbling through viral suspension in sterile water. Taking into account a very stress sensitive nature of the SARS virus these results indicate that the device filled with virus maintenance fluid is capable of providing a relatively low level of microbial decay and can be evaluated for monitoring of such microorganisms in the air environment. The inter sampler variation is also a very important part of the experimental procedure (Agranovski et al., 2002b) . The discrepancy between all three experimental runs employing virus maintenance fluid was minimal and did not exceed 0.25 lg. This is very important as, taking into account the absence of any reference technique for such measurement, it was the only parameter which could be used for the evaluation of sampler's performance on monitoring viable SARS virus.
