2.1. Polyclonal antibodies against four recombinant SeACoV proteins can react with viral antigens in SeACoV-infected cells Four SeACoV specific polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against distinct viral protein antigens were generated and validated. Two viral genes, SeACoV N and the nonstructural protein 3 (Nsp3) acidic domain (Ac) of ORF1a, were expressed as soluble products in the bacteria; the SeACoV spike subunit 1 (S1) was expressed in insect cells, secreting into the cultured medium. Purified recombinant SeACoV proteins (N, S1 and Ac) and an antigenic peptide corresponding to the last 14 amino acids (aa) at the carboxyl terminus of the M protein were used to immunize rabbits, respectively, generating four polyclonal sera that were then used to detect viral proteins on SeACoV-infected Vero cells. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) conducted at 48 h post-infection (hpi) using respective pAb showed that the four viral antigens (N, M, S1 or Ac) were each expressed in the cytoplasm of the infected cells, with the anti-N and anti-M pAbs displaying the higher fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1A) . In contrast, mock-infected controls did not show any positive IFA signals (Fig. 1A) . To determine the intracellular localization and the timing of the viral protein expression with higher magnification, time course analysis of confocal image was performed. Vero cells infected with SeACoV were fixed at 4, 8, 12, and 24 hpi, and labeled with four pAb, respectively. Perinuclear and cytoplasmic foci were detected by anti-N staining at 4 and 8 hpi, and were distributed throughout the cytoplasm at 12 and 24 hpi, probably reflecting that N protein is associated with sites of viral RNA replication in early infection phase and assembled into virions subsequently (Fig. 1B) . Anti-Ac (Nsp3) staining also resulted in detection of perinuclear foci at four time points, indicating localization to the viral replication-transcription complexes (Fig. 1C) , which was similar to the pattern of Nsp3 antibody observed in SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells (Prentice et al., 2004) . Confocal microscopy detected discrete cytoplasmic fluorescence signal throughout the cytoplasm with anti-M (Fig. 1D ) and anti-S1 (Fig. 1E ) as early as 4 hpi. Diffuse and more intense fluorescence was observed over time, demonstrating the process of virus assembly by incorporation of M and S proteins into virus particles. The anti-N pAb recognized a single band of 42 kDa in the lysate of SeACoV-infected cells but not in control cells at 48 hpi by western blot analysis (Fig. 1F ). The molecular size was consistent with the deduced aa sequence of the N protein but was a little less than the purified products expressed in the bacteria (Fig. 1F) . Expression of the M protein with the predicted 25-KDa molecular size was also detected by using anti-M pAb in SeACoV-infected cells (Fig. 1G ). The reactivity of anti-S1 or anti-Ac was less distinct as seen by western blot analysis (data not shown). Therefore, all the four SeACoV pAbs can be used for specific detection of SeACoV infection in the cultured cell by IFA staining, and the anti-N and anti-M pAbs can also be used particularly in western blot analysis. The antibodies are available to the research community upon request.
