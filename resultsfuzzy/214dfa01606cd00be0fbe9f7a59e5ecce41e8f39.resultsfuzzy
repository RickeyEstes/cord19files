Using the 0-40 km as the treatment buffer and 100-140 km as the control buffer, Table 4 reports the monthly treatment effects of Table 1 , city-distance band fixed effects, and year-months fixed effects.

FNA on land prices. In Columns 1 and 2, we estimate Eq. (3) to investigate whether there are common trends between treatment groups and control groups. Specifically, in Column 1, we estimate the coefficients of k t from October 2010 to February 2011 in the pretreatment period, we find that the pretreatment coefficients are statistically insignificant. In Column 2, we absorb October 2010 into the baseline group and conduct the estimation again, the results are very similar to what we obtain in Column 1. Both of these estimations suggest that the trends of land prices of treatment groups and control groups are not statistically different. After assuring that the common trends assumption holds in our analysis, in Column 3, we formally investigate the dynamics of treatment effects by using Eq. (2). In general, pooling the transactions in the 0-40 km sample produces similar coefficients as the data in 0-20 km and 20-40 km distance bands. Land prices within 40 km fell by approximately 18% in April 2011. These effects became statistically insignificant after April 2011. These results appear to support our hypothesis that individuals tend to place greater emphasis on recent information. Thus, the effect of FNA on land prices is stronger in the short run. Next, we estimate the treatment effects of FNA on land prices in different grouped time spans. The purpose of grouping posttreatment months into different aggregate periods is to observe if there is any trend of the treatment effects. Moreover, it also facilitates our exploration heterogeneous effects in different time spans in the next section. In Column 1 of Table 5 , we present the regression results of Eq. (1) by assuming homogeneous effects of FNA over time. The results show that the magnitude of coefficient decreases to −0.074 (3) as the regression model, this table shows the monthly treatment effects of FNA on land prices before and after the event. In Column 1, the absorbed baseline period is July to September 2010. In Column 2, the absorbed baseline period is July to November 2010. In Column 3, the absorbed baseline period is July 2010 to February 2011. These regressions use land parcels in 0-40 km to the nearest nuclear power plant as treatment group and land parcels in the 100-140 km distance band as control group. The core variables are products of a time dummy It and a treatment indicator Itreatment, the coefficients of them represent the time-varying treatment effect estimates. Control variables include land characteristics defined in Table 1 , citydistance band fixed effects, and year-months fixed effects. Robust standard errors clustered at group-level (city-distance band combinations) are in parentheses. * * Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent level. but is statistically insignificant. In Columns 2 and 3, we use various combinations of post-accident months to distinguish the short-run, mid-run, and long-run effects of FNA. In Column 2, April 2011, May to August 2011 and September to December 2011 are respectively considered to be the short-run period, mid-run period and long-term period. The results show that the coefficient for April 2011 is the same as that in Column 1. Additionally, there is a clearly decreasing trend of magnitudes of short-term, mid-term, and long-term coefficients, implying that the estimated effects tend to decline over time. In contrast, in Column 3, we equally divide the nine postevent months into three groups. Although the magnitudes of the coefficients also decrease over time, the estimated parameter for the short-term (April 2011 to June 2011) is marginally insignificant. Therefore, we prefer categorizing Column 2, which can highlight the short-term impacts of FNA, in the previous manner to further investigate other heterogeneous treatment effects. There are two possible explanations for the short-lived effects of the FNA on land prices. First, people may have shifted their attention from the FNA over time. Fig. 1 in Section 1 displays the frequency of Google searches involving the keywords "nuclear power plant". It shows that the search frequency in China soared to their peak levels immediately after the FNA, but then declined to the normal frequency within one to two months. This pattern is similar in 5 other countries including France, Germany, Japan, UK and the US. Second, the Chinese believed that the nuclear power plants are safe in China. Soon after the FNA, the Chinese Government started a comprehensive safety review of all nuclear power plants, which were all announced to be safe after the inspection (He et al., 2014 , Wang et al., 2014 . The study by He et al. (2014) shows that "Chinese citizens tended to choose the government as the most trustworthy source when it came to information provision on nuclear risks and in cases of nuclear accidents" and "in responding to nuclear accidents, Chinese citizens trusted most of all governmental authorities" (page 448). One possible concern of our identification strategy is related to the selected distance bands for the control and treatment groups. Although we have shown that the 40 km treatment group boundary is determined by stepwise regressions by different assumed treatment bands, it is still crucial to test whether our main results are sensitive to the selection of control groups. In this section, we examine the robustness of our results by changing the distance boundaries of the treatment and control groups. In Column 1 of Table 8 , the control groups are placed 80-120 km away from the power plants, while the treatment group boundary remains 40 km as in the main analysis section. The estimated coefficient for short-term effects is −0.118 and is significant at the 10% level, which is smaller than the result in Column 3 of Table 4 . Column 2 places the treatment group boundary at 60 km, Table 1 , city-distance band fixed effects, and year-months fixed effects. Robust standard errors clustered at group-level (city-distance band combinations) are in parentheses. * * * Significant at the 1 percent level. * * Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent level. while keeping the control group boundary the same as Column 1. After extending the treatment boundary for 20 km, neither the short-term nor long-term impacts of FNA are found to be significant. This suggests that including area that are less affected into the treatment groups will lead to an imprecise estimation of the real treatment effects. Columns 3 and 4 replicate the above regressions but narrow the control group boundaries further to 100-120 km. The estimated treatment effects of FNA are reported to be slightly larger than those in Columns 1 and 2. In summary, evidence from these various combinations of treatment and control groups implies that: a) the conclusion of short-term effects of FNA on land prices is robust to the choice of control groups, and b) our inferred 40 km treatment boundary is a credible choice for assessing the effect of FNA on risk perception.
