At the start of each group experiment, the sampler was operated for 30 minutes to obtain baseline readings of the laboratory atmosphere. Collection of aerosols from the seven groups of experimental procedures and controls followed the steps detailed in the Materials and Methods section. The processing time was 30 min for each group, except for group I (time was 1 h), and the air sampling distance was 38 cm from the working materials. Statistics of the group temperature and relative humidity for each of the data collection processes, including operations and control of the collection, were measured automatically by the aerosol collector. None of the aerosol samples collected from any group at the time directly prior to processing of the experiment had detectable levels of H5N1, as evidenced by negative reverse transcription (Rt)-PCR and HA text results. All liquid aerosols collected from the experimental procedure of group III were also negative for H5N1 (Table 1 , Figure 2 ). The aerosols collected during the experimental procedures of all other six groups were positive for H5N1. The aerosols from each group taken after disinfection were negative ( Table 2) . Our experiment was carried out in a negative pressure isolation unit with mechanical arm ( Figure 3 ). The three groups of procedures with simulated accidents (broken glass containers with influenza virus suspension, syringe-ejected influenza virus suspension, and centrifuge tube rupture) all produced aerosols. The controls for each were all negative. All of the aerosols that were produced contained H5N1 that was detectable by Rt-PCR and HA text (Table 1, Figure 4 ).
