Among these positive clones, the sequences of eight clones produced no BLAST results, and 12 different BLAST results were obtained from the remaining clones.  The GST-S1 and His-UBXN1 fusion proteins were used in the GST pulldown assay to verify the interaction between S1 and UBXN1. Lanes 1 and 4: result of S1 and UBXN1 pulldown; lanes 2 and 5: His-UBXN1 fusion protein (42 kDa); lanes 3 and 6: GST-S1 fusion protein (97 kDa) and GST tag blank control (20 kDa). C Co-IP assay for the interaction between S1 and UBXN1 in vivo. IPEC-J2 cells were infected with TGEV Miller for 36 h and were then subjected to a Co-IP assay. The coimmunoprecipitated proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE (left) and Western blotting (right). +: virus-infected group; −: normal group. (ARSs). ARSs are widely expressed among organisms and are responsible for catalyzing the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs [16] , and the role of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in TGEV infection has already been explored [17] . Microsomal glutathione transferase 1 (MGST1) is a membrane-associated protein in the eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism (MAPEG) superfamily, which are glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) [18] . MGST1 is widely distributed, with high levels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). MGST1 is an ER-membrane-bound enzyme [19, 20] . MGST1 participates in a variety of physiological activities, including cellular defense against toxic, carcinogenic, and pharmacologically active electrophilic compounds (thereby protecting cells against H 2 O 2 -induced cell trauma) [2, 21] . The sensor histidine kinase is a membrane receptor with the highest diversity among all biological activities of microorganisms [22] . The receptor region of this protein is responsible for structural dynamics in control signal regulation [23] . This receptor functions in two-component signaling systems (TCSs); tens of thousands of TCSs are necessary for many aspects of biological activities in cells, including growth and survival [24] . Kinesin-like protein (KIF2C) belongs to the kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs) and has the features of a highly conserved structural domain and a core that catalyzes hydrolysis. KIF2C plays a significant role in intracellular transport systems as a molecular motor that transmits the energy released from chemical reactions into mechanical motion [25] . Calcium-binding protein 2-like regulates its own biological activities via a reversible interaction of its specific protein-binding sites with Ca 2+ [26] . Ca 2+ is a common intracellular signal carrier that regulates many cellular processes from cell birth, differentiation, and reproduction to apoptosis [27] . In our screening results, UBXN1 appeared at a high frequency among the candidate proteins and was known to have a strong inhibitory effect on the RNA virus-induced type I interferon response [13] . Therefore, the candidate protein UBXN1 was selected as protein of interest for further verification of its interaction with TGEV-S1. Recently, UBXN1 was identified as a negative regulator in the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-mediated signaling pathway [11] . In the process of TGEV infection of IPEC-J2 host cells, the RNA of the single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus TGEV is recognized as a viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). PAMPs are mainly regulated by cytoplasmic receptors, such as RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) [28] . Once the viral RNA is recognized, RIG-1 and MDA5 trigger a signal cascade reaction, stimulating the production of cytokines and chemokines. Type I interferons (IFNs) are quickly produced to establish the antiviral status in host cells. Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) (also known as IPS-1, CARDIF, and VISA) is an important protein in the RLR signaling pathway. MAVS binds to viruses via an interaction between the N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of RLRs. Then, the TRAF functional module (TIM) recruits the E2 ligases TRAF3 and TRAF6, which activate canonical IκB kinases (IKKs) and IKK-related kinases such as TBK1 and IKKε, and eventually promoted the production of type I IFNs and proinflammatory factors [29] . Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein, as a central adaptor of RLRs, is negatively regulated by UBXN1. After infection with TGEV, UBXN1 is induced to recruit MAVS. UBXN1 blocks the binding site of TRAF3/6 (aa 450-480), which is important for MAVS-mediated regulation of the IFN induction. The binding of UBXN1 to MAVS interferes with intracellular MAVS oligomerization and blocks the formation of the MAVS/TRAF3/ TRAF6 signalosome to inhibit the type I IFN response [2] . It has been confirmed that the N terminus of UBXN1 is responsible for binding to MAVS (aa 438-467) and that UBXN1's functions in ubiquitination are independent of binding to VCP/p97 [30] . We confirmed the interaction between TGEV-S1 and UBXN1 using yeast two-hybrid screening, which suggested that TGEV-S1 might participate in UBXN1-related intracellular biological functions. UBXN1 directly bound to S1 in vitro and in vivo, as determined by the GST pulldown and Co-IP assays. Moreover, we found that TGEV-S1 and UBXN1 had a positive association. TGEV infection triggered an increase in the UBXN1 levels, and UBXN1 promoted TGEV proliferation, as proven by the siRNA and overexpression assays. We deduced that the binding of TGEV-S1 to UBXN1 induced UBXN1 expression to enhance TGEV proliferation. TGEV infection induces massive production of IFN-I in host cells, but it also results in a variety of immune escape mechanisms with IFN resistance. Finally, we confirmed by siRNA and overexpression assays that UBXN1 had a negative relationship with IFN-β, suggesting that TGEV infection promoted UBXN1 to inhibit the production of IFN-β in the late stage of infection to augment proliferation. The detailed mechanism of this process is worthy of further research. In the present study, we identified 12 candidate proteins that potentially interact with TGEV-S1 in porcine small intestinal epithelial cells. Most of these proteins are involved in protein synthesis and transport, biological signal transduction, and negative regulation of signaling pathways; therefore, it is likely that TGEV-S1 has multiple functions in intracellular proteinrelated processes. We further confirmed the interaction between TGEV-S1 and UBXN1 and found that UBXN1 expression increased after TGEV infection. Moreover, UBXN1 negatively regulated TGEV-induced IFN production. We reported for the first time the interaction between TGEV-S1 and the UBXN1 protein in IPEC-J2 cells and found that UBXN1 plays an important role in the replication of TGEV in cells. In summary, the UBXN1-S1 complex may have a regulatory effect on TGEV infection-induced IFN production. These findings will lay a foundation for further understanding TGEV pathogenesis.
