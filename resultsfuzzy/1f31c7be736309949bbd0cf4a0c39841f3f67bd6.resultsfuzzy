Maximum likelihood (ML) tree yielded over 20 distinct PRRSV clades (Fig. 2) . We selected three clades (A, B and C) for further analyses, ensuring that each selected clade's spatial and temporal distribution represented the geographical extent and period of the study (Figs 1A and 2). Clades A and B ORF5 sequence data favored the expansion and the exponential coalescent tree models, respectively (BF > 20; Table S2 ). That finding suggests that Clade A viral population grew at an increasingly exponential rate, whereas Clade B population grew at a fixed exponential rate. However, while both clades favored different coalescent tree models, inferred posterior growth rate parameter was similar and equal to 0.23 year −1 (95% HPD:0.07, 0.38) and 0.21 year −1 (95% HPD:0.08, 0.36) for clades A and B, respectively. Clade C ORF5 sequence data favored the logistic coalescent tree model (BF > 34; Table S2 ), which assumes that population size of the virus grew at a decreasing rate over time (Table S2) . However, Clade's C inferred posterior growth rate parameter was substantially larger than that of Clades' A and B and was equal to 2.63 year −1 (95% HPD:1. 28, 4.20) . Furthermore, estimates of the clades' relative genetic diversity through time suggest that all the three clades exhibited typical annual seasonal increases in population size (Fig. 3 ). Continuous diffusion phylogeographic models indicated that geographical spread of PRRSv outbreaks for the three clades followed a heterogeneous, rather than homogenous, spatial diffusion process ( Table 2) . Both A and B clades favored the gamma RRW model with initial dispersal rates of 16.3 and 13.1 km/year, respectively (Table 2) . However, clade C favored the Cauchy RRW model with a dispersal rate that was substantially higher and reached up to 73.1 km/year (Table 2 ). Mean evolutionary rates of clades A and B were closely similar (0.0074 and 0.0089 substitution/site/year, respectively) and substantially smaller than clade C (0.0114; Table 2 ). However, viruses from clade C have evolved more recently than those from clades A and B (Table 2 ; Fig. 4 ). Tree topologies inferred by the ML method ( Figure S1 ) for the three clades were substantially different from the topologies inferred by the Bayesian diffusion phylogeographic models (Fig. 4) . For all the three clades, highest among-branch spatial diffusion rate variation was inferred at most of the tips of the MCC trees, which is a typical reflection of the heterogeneous diffusion process (Fig. 4) . Finally, the inferred geographical origins of the posterior phylogeny and dispersal routes with a high rate of spatial diffusion for clades A and B were mostly encompassed by the identified high-risk areas predicted by the final Maxent model (Fig. 5) . Indeed, most of the MCC tree branches of clades A and B had accumulated at the predicted high-risk areas (Probability <0.8), with narrow dispersal patterns (Fig. 5) . However, even though clade C's point of geographical origin was encompassed by the predicted high-risk areas in the borders between Minnesota and Iowa (Fig. 5) , the MCC branches exhibited a substantially wider dispersal pattern compared to clades A and B, and did not accumulate in the predicted high-risk areas (Fig. 5) . Instead, the MCC branches of clade C predominately spread throughout the study region as demonstrated in Fig. 5 .
