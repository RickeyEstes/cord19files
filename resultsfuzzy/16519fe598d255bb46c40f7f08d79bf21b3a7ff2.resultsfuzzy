We collected 5221 cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs. Of these, 4176 (80%) were from chickens, 321 (6AE1%) from ducks, 382 (7AE3%) from turkeys, and 342 (6AE6%) from geese (Table 3) . Most (99AE5%) of the specimens were collected from healthy birds, but 0AE5% of samples were collected from clinically sick birds that mainly had diarrhea, difficulty in breathing, and nasal discharges. Of the 5199 (99AE6%) specimens tested that could be linked to individual bird data, influenza A virus was detected in 42 (0AE8%). Influenza was detected in 35 ⁄ 4166 (0AE8%) chicken OP ⁄ CL specimens, 3 ⁄ 381 (0AE8%) turkey OP ⁄ CL specimens, and 4 ⁄ 335 (1AE2%) geese OP ⁄ CL specimens (Table 3) . No virus was detected in 317 duck OP ⁄ CL specimens [2AE3% upper limit at 95% confidence level (CI)] ( Table 3) . The mean C T value of the 42 specimens that were positive for influenza A by rt RT-PCR was 37AE2 (Standard error 0AE29); the median C T value was 38AE1 (Range 33AE1-39AE6). Test results for 22 (0AE4%) specimens could not be linked to individual bird data and were excluded from further analysis. All of these 22 specimens were negative for influenza A. None of 485 environmental specimens collected and tested for influenza A virus were positive (upper limit 95% CI 0AE8%) ( Table 4 ). In total, we collected specimens for 22 months and influenza virus was detected in the poultry in 14 (63AE64%) of Detection of influenza A virus in live bird markets ª 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd these months. We did not observe any seasonal or monthly differences in influenza detection ( Figure 2 ). The median monthly detection rate was 0AE4%; the highest detection rate (4AE1%) was in January 2011. Influenza virus was detected in both OP and CL specimens in chickens (Table 3 ). In turkeys and geese, influenza A was detected in OP but not in CL specimens (Table 3) . In all species, virus detection was significantly higher in OP [33 (1AE2%)] than in cloacal [9 (0AE4%)] specimens (P-value < 0AE01). Overall, influenza virus prevalence was highest in geese 4 ⁄ 168 (2AE4%) and lowest in turkeys 3 ⁄ 191 (1AE6%). There was no significant difference in the observed prevalence of influenza among chickens, turkeys, geese, and ducks (P-value 0AE29). All the influenza positive specimens were from healthy birds. Influenza A was detected in all the five markets (Table 4 ). In the four markets trading primarily in chickens, the detection rate varied from 0AE5% in Nakuru to 1AE2% in Kariokor. The detection rate in Nyambari market, which traded in mixed species (turkeys, geese and ducks), was 0AE7%. There was no significant difference in the influenza detection rate in the five markets during this period. In total, the 35 influenza A-positive specimens in chicken were distributed in 13 administrative districts. Ten of 35 (28AE6%) influenza A-positive chicken specimens were from birds sourced from one district (Bomet district) where 1 ⁄ 3 of the chickens sold in the four markets originated from. Influenza A detection by district was variable and ranged from 0AE3% to 12AE5% for this period. However, there was no significant difference in the influenza A detection rate of the chicken, geese, or turkey specimens by district or source of the birds.
