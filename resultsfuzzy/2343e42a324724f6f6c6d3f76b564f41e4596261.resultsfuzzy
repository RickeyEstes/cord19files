A true positive was defined as either being positive (identical result) by the 2 assays or by a single assay if confirmed by the corresponding "in house" RT-PCR assay coupled to direct sequencing. Agents not included in CLARTÂ® PneumoVir panel and detected by the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v1 (hCov HKU1, NL63, and OC43) were excluded for comparative analyses. Pairwise differences in sensitivity were determined by the McNemar test, with P values b0.05 being considered significant. The level of agreement between both assays was calculated by means of Kappa statistics.
