ELM with a specific database drastically reduced the computational time and saved disk space. Furthermore, ELM was effective even for short reads. Though short reads can reduce the accuracy of BLAST searches, in this study we verified ELM for average lengths of between 73 and 400 bases. The results showed no difference between the capabilities for taxonomic assignment. One approach to reduce the computational time needed for the BLAST search is the subtraction of reads by mapping host-derived reads onto reference sequences [18] , this virus is the novel pig stool-associated single-stranded DNA virus, which is not assigned to a specific genus. [21, 22] . This approach might be considered effective for reducing analyzed sequence data but is limited to known hosts. It is not suitable for surveillance of wild animals or metagenomic analysis because the host sequences have yet to be deposited in databases. Therefore, we need to decide a moderate threshold for NGS data before the mapping. For ELM we adopted another approach using specific databases composed only of target sequences to reduce the computational cost. The difficulty in applying this approach directly to virus identification was the increase of false positive assignments (Figure 4) . We tested several ways to solve this problem. As shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1 , changing the threshold of the E-value dependent on the size of the database is probably not effective for discriminating between true and false assignments. The criteria for evaluating breadth coverage, i.e. the proportion of reads mapped across the hit genomes and the depth coverage (the number of reads mapped at a position), also failed to identify the target viruses (Additional file 1: Figure S2 ). On the other hand, ELM analyzed how sequence similarity to the relatives changes. This extension of the LCA method suppressed the rise in false positive assignments. A limitation of ELM would be the false-negative errors because ELM cannot detect viruses distantly related to other relatives (Table 4 ). Therefore, viruses without relatives should be carefully handled without the inflation index.
