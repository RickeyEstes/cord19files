After having established that OSBP and -possibly -ORP4 are novel targets of ITZ, we wanted to study how ITZ targets these proteins. Because of available tools, we focused on OSBP for the remainder of this study. In line with published data (Burgett et al., 2011) , OSW-1 caused a massive recruitment of overexpressed GFP-OSBP to the Golgi apparatus (as marked by staining endogenous PI4KIIIÎ²) ( Figure 4A) . A similar relocalization was observed for endogenous OSBP ( Figure 4B ). ITZ and posaconazole, but not the azoles that lacked antiviral activity, redistributed OSBP in a manner that is similar to OSW-1. Live-cell imaging was performed to study the dynamics of GFP-OSBP relocalization by the compounds. Before addition of the compounds, GFP-OSBP primarily localized in the cytosol with a Golgi pattern faintly visible. A few minutes after the addition of the compounds, GFP-OSBP fluorescence at the Golgi was clearly increased in cells treated with either ITZ or OSW-1 and continued to increase at the expense of the cytoplasmic signal ( Figures 4C-D and Movie S1). OSW-1 was previously reported to disrupt the structure of the Golgi apparatus (Burgett et al., 2011) , which we also observed from ~30-60 min onward as GFP-positive punctae that became more numerous over time ( Figure 4C ). In ITZ-treated cells, the Golgi pattern became affected only hours later and appeared less dispersed than that in OSW-1 treated cells.
