Following the signal-to-noise criterion and known instrumental limits, three variables (12, 14.9 and 18.4 mm size bins) were excluded from the model, while five variables (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9 and 10 mm particles) were labelled as "weak" by tripling their uncertainties. Two additional variables (15.1 and 16.8 nm) were categorised as weak because of showing high scaled residuals in (2) airport traffic (arrivals þ departures); (3) solar irradiation; (4) nitrogen oxide concentration; (5) sulphur dioxide concentration; (6) particle number concentration for the nucleation range (14e30 nm); (7) particle number concentration for the Aitken range (30e100 nm); (8) particle number concentration for the accumulation range (100e1000 nm); (9) BC concentration; (10) contour plots of SMPS data. preliminary runs; the total particle concentration was set as the total variable (weak). A total of 172 samples were excluded as containing missing or incomplete data. A final matrix composed of 49 variables and 4434 samples was then used as input for the PMF. The model was run several times by investigating solutions between 3 and 10 factors, by changing the extra modelling uncertainty option and by finding the most physically plausible result. Solutions of each preliminary run were investigated to avoid poorly/awfully resolved sources or unstable results by: (i) checking the model diagnostics; (ii) identifying factors having significant inter-factor correlations (Pearson r > 0.4 at p < 0.01); (iii) minimising the sums of the squared differences between the scaled residuals for pairs of base runs. A final 6-factor solution with 9.5% extra uncertainty was selected as the best compromise over the PMF diagnostic results and interpretation reliability for factors. Generally, solutions with less than 6 factors returned many unresolved profiles; 7-factors had higher inter-factor correlations, while for >8 factors solutions generated profiles with Q well below the expected (theoretical) value of the residual sum of squares Q exp and/or no physical meaning. Convergence of the final PMF solution was then ensured over multiple runs for the 6-factor solution using a random starting seed. PMF results were carefully checked by investigating the base model displacement error estimation (DISP) and bootstrapping (BS) error estimation Brown et al., 2015) . Diagnostics reported that: (i) no factor swaps occurred for DISP analysis indicating that there are not significant rotational ambiguities and the solution is sufficiently robust to be used; (ii) factor mapping from the BS runs suggested that the BS uncertainties can be interpreted and the selected number of factors is appropriate. PMF rotational ambiguities were further assessed by varying the FPEAK value (Paatero et al., 2002) between À5 and 10 and checking the relative changes in Q, the total number of negative contributions and the G-space plots for edges. The more physically realistic and independent solutions were obtained for FPEAK ¼ 2.5. Uncertainties of FPEAK-rotated solutions were finally estimated over n ¼ 200 BS runs. The extracted factor profiles are presented in Fig. 7 as normalised number and volume fractions, while uncertainties of the final solution are shown in Fig. SI5 as percentage of species sum with the associated uncertainty estimated by BS. A summary of PMF results is also provided in Table 1. A first attempt to link PMF factors with airport traffic was carried out by computing Spearman correlations among factor contributions and real airport traffic movements (total, arrivals, departures) at 5 min resolution. Airport traffic was elaborated to return the more plausible number of aircraft movements every 5 min and takes in account the exact timing of each movement. Traffic data include the timings of landing and parking at the terminal (for arrivals) and the timings of departure from gates and take-off (for departures). This way, each movement was adjusted for the real time that each aircraft was moving. The dataset was also handled to maximise the signal of aircraft, i.e. selecting hours with high airport traffic (10 a.m.e9 p.m.) and wind regimes blowing air masses from the taxiway and runway to the sampling site (45e170 ). No one factor showed significant (p < 0.001) strong (r > 0.6) or even weak (0.35 < r < 0.6) correlation with airport traffic. This result may be explained by a number of reasons: (i) airport emissions are complicated to model and predict due to the large number of different phases in the LTO cycles: even if it possible to know the exact time of each movement, it is difficult to predict the timing and the relative position of aircraft at different phases (e.g., the time spent by aircraft in the queue at the beginning of the runway was not recorded or when they are exactly upwind of the sampling site); (ii) although aircraft engines are expected to be the larger contributors to the air pollution at the airport, other sources may interfere by emitting particles with similar size distributions and, then, adding noise to the PMF results (e.g., the aircraft auxiliary power units (APU), which are small on-board turbines providing a source of electrical power and compressed air when aircraft are parked at the gate and sometimes during taxi); (iii) other strong sources are present in the study area; (iv) wind data are recorded hourly and then interpolated for obtaining 5 min time resolution, therefore unknown discrepancies may occur between estimated and real wind data. This latter point was overcome by investigating 1 h-averaged traffic and PMF data, but correlations were still low for all of the factors. Due the inability to link PMF factors directly with aircraft movements, the interpretation of the extracted sources was principally based on the modal characteristics of the distributions and further post-processing analyses including: (1) the daily trends of factor contributions (Fig. 8); (2) the investigation of the source directionality by mean of polar plot and polar annulus analyses (Fig. 8); (3) the results of Spearman rank correlations (r) with other measured pollutants (Table 2 ) and (4) cross-correlation functions (CCFs) among variables and calculated at ±24 h lag time using hourly averaged data or with higher time resolution (5 min) and within ±3 h lag time for PMF source contributions and BC data (Fig. 9 ). The first factor includes most of the particles in the nucleation range (<25 nm), exhibits a sharp mode in the number distribution at 15e20 nm and makes the largest contribution to the total PNC (43.8%, confidence interval at 95% based on 200 BS runs (c.i. 95 ) between 43.4 and 44.1%). However, its contribution to the volume distribution is~1%. This factor shows significant (p < 0.001) but weak (0.35 < r < 0.6) positive correlations with NO (but not NO 2 ), OX, solar irradiance, air temperature and exhibits an evident diurnal variation peaking at 1 p.m. and higher levels during the afternoon. The polar plot analysis (Fig. 8) indicates enhanced levels when winds blow from the SW and SE quadrants: whilst the increase from the SE quadrant arises for high wind speeds (>5 m s À1 ) towards the airfield, the increase in the SW quadrant occurs for lower speeds (3e5 m s À1 ). The polar annulus analysis indicates that the higher concentrations are for winds blowing from S to SW at 12 noon-4 p.m. This behaviour is consistent with the location of several anthropogenic sources in the study area which can contribute to particles in the nucleation range, i.e. the road traffic in the urban area of Mestre (toward SW), the stack emissions from the industrial area (SW), shipping in Venice and its tourist harbour (S) and the airport activities and aircraft movements (SE). In this context, particles peaking in the nucleation range have been observed for multiple anthropogenic sources: (i) fresh diesel engines (Shi and Harrison, 1999) , (ii) diesel-equipped boats at high engine loads (Petzold et al., 2010) , (iii) coal-fired power plants (Nielsen et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2010) aircraft (Anderson et al., 2005; Kinsey et al., 2010; Mazaheri et al., 2013; Lobo et al., 2015) . However, particles in this size range may also originate from photochemically-driven nucleation processes. The profile for this factor relates well to the shapes grouped in the cluster 5 in the kmeans cluster analysis (midday nucleation events). The polar plot for this factor (Fig. 8 ) also shows the highest intensity in areas of the plot showing the lowest PM 2.5 concentrations (Fig. 3) . This is consistent with nucleation being favoured by a low condensation sink (Dall'Osto et al., 2013) . Beside the number of potential sources for this factor, the daily profile (Fig. 8) shows a sharp peak at noon-2 p.m. which is strongly related to the solar irradiance and well matches with the hourly counts of cluster 5, but also bears some similarity to aircraft movements (Fig. 2) or road traffic rush hours. Aircraft takeoffs start before 6 a.m., when the contribution of this factor is still low. Moreover, the maximum average values shown in the polar and annulus plots at noon-2 p.m. are towards the SW, which is not consistent with a main origin from the airfield. Results of a subsequent study give further insights for interpreting the first factor. A similar sampling campaign was carried out in July 2014 at a kerbside site in the urban area of Mestre using a similar set of instruments (SMPS, aethalometer). Preliminary results of this study are provided as supplementary material: Fig. SI6 shows the map of the sampling location, while Fig. SI7 reports the "nucleation factor" extracted by applying PMF analysis to SMPS data. These results show an identical size distribution (particles peaking at 15e20 nm) with a similar daily pattern (main peak at noon-1 p.m. followed by a second minor peak at 6e7 a.m.). However, the polar plot analysis significantly differs showing strong increases for winds blowing from the SE, i.e. the direction of the industrial zone. Since the kerbside site is located 9.5 km WSW from VCE and weather conditions were very similar (summer sea/land breeze regime), an origin of factor 1 from airport activities is not consistent with the results. An origin from the industrial zone is plausible. As already reported, a large coal-fired power plant and an oil refinery are located in the industrial area of Porto Marghera and both installations are potential sources of particles in the nucleation range (Nielsen et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2010; Cheung et al., 2012) and SO 2 . Emission inventories for 2010 (ARPAV e Regione Veneto, 2015) reported that combustion in energy and transformation industries accounts for~72% of total SO 2 emissions in the Venice Province. It has been reported that the probability of nucleation is increased by elevated SO 2 concentrations (e.g., Stanier et al., 2004) and a 13 year-long monitoring of airborne pollutants conducted in Mestre (Masiol et al., 2014b) reported evident peaks of SO 2 for winds blowing from the industrial zone. A large influence of oil refineries and/or coal-fired power plants upon the particle number concentrations in the nucleation range have been observed in many parts of the world (e.g., Stevens et al., 2012; Cheung et al., 2012; Gonz alez and Rodríguez, 2013) . All of these insights support the interpretation of factor 1 as mainly driven by photochemical nucleation processes occurring in the atmosphere (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2006; Zhang et al., 2011) probably including gas-to-particle conversion of SO 2 . CCFs (Fig. 9) well depict the relationship between this factor and solar irradiation: a short delay of the highest positive correlations at þ1/ þ2 h lags may be attributed to the time needed for the growth of nucleated particles into the measured size range. However, beside its main probable origin from photochemical nucleation of SO 2 , the directional analysis (Fig. 8) further suggests that this factor might also be also secondarily associated with locally-emitting primary anthropogenic sources. Since the sampling site is located downwind of major combustion sources during sea breeze regimes, particles arising from the urban area are sampled on timescales of several minutes after emission and, then, may undergo a substantial evaporative shrinkage resulting in a shift toward smaller sizes. The condensation/evaporation/dilution processes have been demonstrated to be major mechanisms in altering aerosol size distributions after primary particles in the nucleation range are emitted in the atmosphere (Zhang et al., 2004; Harrison et al., 2016) ; this effect has been observed in heavily developed urban areas, such as London . In addition, the polar plot for factor 1 also shows minor increases towards the airfield for strong winds. The sulphur content in jet fuel is limited to 3000 ppm and is commonly reported within the range 300e1100 ppm (Masiol and Harrison, 2014 , and reference therein), which is approximately 30e100 times higher than that for automotive fuels (<10 ppm). Consequently, aircraft emissions are a high potential source of SO 2 and may secondarily contribute to this factor under some particular circumstances. In summary, although this factor could consist of a few distinct sources resulting in poorly resolved PMF solutions, its fingerprint remains similar for solutions of up to 10 factors, demonstrating its structural robustness and the lack of potential artefacts upon the PMF solution. As a consequence, the hypothesis of multiple-source attribution for nucleation particles is plausible and it is impossible to assign to a specific one with certainty. However, the temporal profile and the fact that the same source profile was found in another site in the area and affected by different emission scenarios is very consistent with a nucleation source driven by regional processes and the most significant sources of sulphur dioxide in the area. The second factor is made up of ultrafine particles in the nucleation range (20e100 nm) with a clear mode at 35e40 nm for Table 2 Spearman's correlations among extracted factors, common air pollutants and some micro-meteorological parameters. Only correlations significant at p < 0.001 are shown; r > 0.6 are bold faced 0.35<r < 0.6 are in italic. the number distribution, and which accounts for 25.5% (c.i. 95 25.3e25.9%) of particle number. Its contribution to the volume distribution is low (~5%) and peaks at 80 and 500 nm. Several observations link this factor to road traffic: (i) correlation analysis shows significant moderate positive associations with NO 2 (r ¼ 0.44) and BC (r ¼ 0.41), which are pollutants primarily emitted by road traffic (mainly diesel); (ii) such correlations have maxima at 0 h lag, suggesting covariant sources (Fig. 9) ; (iii) the diurnal variations reveal a typical cycle common to traffic-related sources (morning and evening rush traffic hours); (iv) the directional analysis shows increased levels when air masses move from the main populated sectors of the mainland, i.e. the urban area of Mestre (SW), and several mains road towards the N and (v) the factor profile is very similar to the cluster 1 (road traffic) extracted by the k-mean cluster analysis. It is extensively reported that particles in the size range of factor 2 may originate from the dilution of diesel exhaust emissions (Charron and Harrison, 2003; Janh€ all et al., 2004; Ntziachristos et al., 2007; Harrison et al., 2011) as well as from gasoline-powered cars Huang et al., 2013) . Similar factor profiles have been also reported in the literature for road traffic (e.g., Yue et al., 2008; Costabile et al., 2009; Harrison et al., 2011) . However, the polar plot analysis also shows increased levels for winds blowing from S, i.e. the direction of the historic city centre of Venice and its passenger terminal and for high wind regimes from SSE, i.e. toward the Lido inlet, a main entrance of cruise ships into the Lagoon of Venice. A number of studies have associated particles in this size range with marine traffic. Jonsson et al. (2011) reported that emissions from cargo and passenger ships peak at~35 nm; Healy et al. (2009) (1999) , who investigated the mechanisms of particle formation during combustion within marine diesel engines affected by hot corrosion and erosion. In the light of this, besides road traffic, factor 2 can be also linked to the marine traffic emissions from ships, waterbuses and boats of public or private transport services, which are commonly equipped with marine diesel engines. Currently, the contribution of the Port of Venice to the levels of PM is heavily debated (Contini et al., 2015) and information on the emissions from waterbuses and the private boat fleet is still lacking (Pecorari et al., 2013a) . Factor 2 was interpreted as road þ shipping traffic, mainly due to diesel engine emissions. The third factor shows a main mode in the number distribution at 80 nm and a second mode in the nucleation range, which seems to extend beyond the lower limit of particle detection of the SMPS (14.6 nm). Three modes in the volume distribution are found at approx. 200, 500 nm and 5 mm. Its contributions to the particle number and volume are 20.3% (c.i. 95 20.1e20.5%) and 19.6%, respectively. This factor lacks relevant correlations with other air pollutants and its diurnal cycle is relatively constant through the early part of the day, with a strong decrease in the early afternoon following the increased wind speeds due to the sea breezes. Several studies available from the current literature report that aircraft engine emissions show a main mode in the nucleation range (Masiol and Harrison, 2014; and references therein; Lobo et al., 2015) . However, despite the particle size profile of factor 3 differing from those commonly reported in the literature for aircraft emissions, there are a number of a reasons for attributing this factor to the airport emissions: The polar plot exhibits the main contributions when air masses blow from the airfield (E to SSE) and from the main airport terminal (NE), while the polar annulus clearly shows that maximum levels for winds blowing from the airfield are reached in the central hours of the day, i.e. during the busy airport hours. No other factors show polar plots consistent with aircraft emissions. Some studies also report the presence of a second mode in the accumulation range for aircraft exhausts (Kinsey et al., 2010; Lobo et al., 2012; Mazaheri et al., 2013) . For example, in a study conducted at the Brisbane airport (Australia), Mazaheri et al. (2009) investigated a total of 283 individual aircraft plumes during landing and takeoff (LTO) cycles and reported accumulation modes between 40 and 100 nm, more pronounced in particle number size distributions during takeoffs. These findings are also consistent with Herndon et al. (2008) , who studied the emissions from in-use commercial aircraft engines downwind of operational taxi-and runways at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airport (USA) and reported the presence of a mode at~65 nm associated with takeoff plumes and a smaller mode at~25 nm associated with idle. Comparing the profile of factor 3 with clustering results, it can be noted that it fits profiles for both cluster 2 and 4 (aircraft and airportrelated shapes). In particular, looking at the diurnal variations, factor 3 seems more related with cluster 4 than with cluster 2. Although factor 3 lacks a main peak in the nucleation range, its fingerprint (Fig. 7) shows the presence of a significant second mode for particles below 14 nm, which may represent the main peak in the nucleation range reported in the literature for aircraft emissions. An apparent shift towards smaller particle sizes can be attributed to evaporative shrinkage of particles before the exhaust plumes reached the sampling site Harrison et al., 2016) . In this context, the total number of particles attributed by our study to the aircraft exhaust emissions will be underestimated because the lower limit of detection of SMPS curtails this second peak below 14 nm. In addition to the main exhaust emissions from aircraft engines, there is some evidence suggesting that this factor can also be related to supplementary contributions from other on-airport sources: the high concentrations observed for winds blowing from the main terminal (ENE) suggest a supplementary contribution from the aircraft APUs. Moreover, the peaks in particle volume at 500 nm and 5 mm can be tentatively attributed to the brake dust and tyre wear during landing and to the dust resuspension due to the turbulence created by the aircraft movements, respectively. Factor 3 was hence attributed to the primary emissions from the airport. The fourth factor is a minor contributor to PNC (5.9%, c.i. 95 5.8e6.1), but accounts for the main percentage of the volume distribution (41%). It has two modes in the number distribution (30 and 200 nm) and a main mode in the volume distribution (400 nm). Polar plot analysis does not reveal any significant directionality toward specific local sources, but shows a marked boost during wind calm hours (r wind speed ¼ À0.54) and low winds from the NNE. The daily pattern is the mirror image of the air temperature, and it is positively correlated with NO 2 (but not with NO), PM 2.5 and BC and negatively correlated with O 3 , OX and SO 2 . The factor 4 can be related to the cluster 3 (nighttime pollution): they match for the 30 nm peak and they show the same diurnal patterns. These results raise the following issues: (i) the higher levels reached in calm and low wind periods may suggest that the origin of the factor is local rather than external or linked to regional transport; (ii) an origin from the airport can be excluded because of the diurnal profile (very limited airport traffic recorded overnight); (iii) the directionality toward NNE, where there are no significant emission sources, may indicate that such a factor is not linked to freshly emitted pollutant. The peak intensity during the nighttime and the significant, but weak, association with NO 2 are highly consistent with the chemistry driving the heterogeneous reactions of N 2 O 5 and NO 3 on aerosol surfaces (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2006; Bertram and Thornton, 2009; Brown and Stutz, 2012) . This process has been observed in many polluted areas (e.g., Fine et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009 ). In particular, Dall'Osto et al. (2009) observed that most nitrate particles in London are: (i) locally produced in urban locations during nighttime; (ii) mainly present in particles smaller than 300 nm and (iii) internally mixed with sulphate, ammonium, elemental and organic carbon. Therefore, this factor clearly depicts the condensation of secondary nitrate on pre-existing particles occurring overnight and enhanced by the air temperatures below 20 C. The analysis of CCF (Fig. 9 ) confirms this interpretation by revealing a delay of about 2 h in maximum negative correlations with ambient temperature, which is likely linked to the time needed for the heterogeneous reactions on the surface of particles. Moreover, it would be expected that nitrate-containing particles can subsequently undergo evaporation during daytime. This latter interpretation relates well to a recent study by Squizzato et al. (2013) , who reported low levels of PM 2.5 -bound nitrate in Venice during the warm season because of the partitioning of nitrate towards the gas-phase. Further information can be extracted by analysing this factor. The high correlation with BC (r ¼ 0.64 with maximum correlations at 0 h lags) suggests that BC particles have a key role in the formation processes by acting as condensation nuclei for nitrate aerosol. BC is a primary pollutant and is therefore directly emitted from specific combustion sources: in the study area principally industries (mainly coal power plant), shipping and traffic. However, none of these primary sources are located toward the NNE. This correlation is mostly driven by the concurrent effects of the nocturnal circulation (prevalent winds blowing from the NNE) and the lower mixing layer height reached in the coldest nighttime hours (typically at 6 a.m.). In the warmest season, the mixing height over the study area may reach 1 km or more during daytime, allowing a greater dispersion of pollutants emitted at the ground, whereas it drops down to below 100 m or less during night (Pecorari et al., 2013b) . Therefore it can be speculated that locallyemitted BC particles and NO x undergo a wide dispersion within the expanded mixing layer during the daytime and move toward the mainland because of the sea breezes. Overnight, the reduction of the mixing layer height restricts BC and nitrogen oxides emissions to a layer close to ground level. In this scenario, both the reduction in air temperatures and the increased concentrations of NO x (Fig. 2b) potentially boost the formation of nitrate aerosol in the particle-phase on BC nuclei. The last two factors show main super-micrometre modes for the volume distribution, respectively at 2e3 and 4e6 mm. Their contributions to the total particle volume concentrations are 21.1% and 12.2%, respectively, while their shares of PNC are negligible (3 and 1.5%, respectively). Apparently, both factors also show increased levels with high winds blowing from the first NE sector and diurnal cycles inverse to the air temperature. However, despite most factors showing repetitive or cyclic daily variations, factor 5 does not present a regular diurnal pattern, but exhibits two relatively short periods with very high contributions: 18e19 and 23e24 May. This result may indicate that it is not necessarily linked with local stationary sources and not strongly affected by micro-or meso-scale weather conditions, such as breezes. Consequently, the potential origin of this factor was investigated through the concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis of the back-trajectories. Details of the adopted method are provided in Hsu et al. (2003) . Results reveal a potential regional origin from Central Italy (Fig. SI8 ), but also increased levels when air masses move from some populated areas of Central Europe. The best interpretation for this factor is therefore the regional/transboundary pollution transport across Italy and/or Europe. Data analysis of factor 6 shows increased levels for strong winds blowing from the NE sector and higher levels in the colder hours of the day. Super-micrometre particles are likely emitted from noncombustion sources. The daily cycle is very similar to that of nighttime nitrate (factor 4), BC and NO 2 , but no correlations are significantly high with those variables. On the contrary, factor 6 clearly shows weak negative correlations with O 3 , OX, wind speed, solar irradiance and air temperature. Strong winds from the NNE bring air masses from agricultural fields as well as from some places in the surroundings of the airport affected by work during the sampling campaign. Consequently, the most plausible interpretation for factor 6 is the local resuspension of large dust particles, presumed to be of crustal origin. The diurnal pattern is explained by the fact that land breezes occur at nighttime, only linking source areas to the sampling site at this time of day.
