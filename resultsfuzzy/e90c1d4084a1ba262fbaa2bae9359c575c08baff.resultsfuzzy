The laboratory reports stating an antiviral effect of ascorbic acid against influenza virus has not been challenged by any report thus far. The antiviral activity of ascorbic acid against influenza virus is not due to its interaction with the H and N antigens of the virus but may be due to its prooxidant effect, its genomic effect of cell cycle arrest at S phase, or perhaps both. Therefore, the antiviral activity of ascorbic acid should occur irrespective of the antigenic drift of the virus, which changes the N or H antigen, causing an influenza pandemic emergency, and renders the existing influenza vaccines ineffective for prevention of a pandemic influenza virus strain infection or causes drug resistance of the neuraminidase inhibitor (N). In the community, although many trials have assessed the relation of cold and flu symptoms and vitamin C supplementation, no trial has assessed the specific viral load in an influenza epidemic/pandemic in a population with ascorbic acid supplementation. The supplementation trials have been reviewed several times, but the individual studies considered in those trials mostly have not estimated the viral load and ascorbic acid concentration available in the respiratory secretion before and after vitamin C supplementation. Therefore, the available reviews and meta-analyses speaking for and against vitamin C supplementation may not exist without substantial errors. Availability of ascorbic acid in bronchial secretion is a proven fact [61] . It has been shown that after 1-g/d supplementation of vitamin C, ascorbic acid concentration in the bronchial secretion is around 90 mM, a concentration ineffective to exhibit an antiviral effect on the MDCK cell line or to arrest the cell cycle at S phase in fibroblasts [62] . Therefore, we are of the opinion that, if a sustained high dose of vitamin C is available in the respiratory secretion, it can exhibit substantial anti influenza virus activity.
