The Anyplex TM II RV16 Detection kit (Seegene) was used as a third analytical technique for samples that gave discordant results. This multiplex RT-PCR test detects 16 viruses, including influenza A and B. Thirteen discordant samples were tested with the Anyplex TM II RV16 Detection kit: seven were RespiFinder Â® concordant, while six were PLEX-ID TM concordant (Table 4 ). Six discordant samples were not tested due to a lack of material.
