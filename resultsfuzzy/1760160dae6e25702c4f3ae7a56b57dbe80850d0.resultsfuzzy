The experiment was conducted in the thermovision measurement laboratory in the Institute of Automatic Control at Silesian University of Technology, with a database of 125 thermal images of faces. The camera used was characterized by the parameters described in Section 3. In Fig. 9 the scheme of the examination room is presented and the measurement parameters are given. The ambient temperature was 23.3°C, relative humidity 44.0%, distance between the camera and the examined human varied between 0.5 and 3 m with 0.5 m steps. After the acquisition of the images, normalization was performed to attenuate objects surrounding the face. An example of normalization is presented in Fig. 10 . The distance between the human and the camera lens was varied to test different space filling in the image by the face (see Fig. 11 ), the proportion of the face to the image and for different resolutions of the region of interest -face and eyes. The influences of the other objects, such as other persons and heat sources, were minimized before starting the experiment. Also the distance between the camera and the walls must be such as to provide minimal influence from the thermal energy reflected by the walls. The tested persons were in the room for a minimum of 15 min before the experiment started and they did not wear glasses. Thermal images of the humans were taken only in the upright position, deviations in the vertical axis was a maximum 15°. For reference, the axillary temperature was measured simultaneously with the image acquisition. The parameters in the algorithm were chosen to maximize the quality of the final result. The first experiment was designed to determine the optimal distance between the examined human face and the thermal camera lens. The determinant of the optimal distance was the accuracy of the localization and the time complexity. The accuracy of localization for different regions of interest was made by comparing the set of pixels from the manual selection and the set of pixels identified by automatic region localization. Fifty per cent accuracy indicates that half of the pixels of the two sets of pixels are identical. For example, Table 1 shows that the average accuracy at a distance of 1.5 m for the region LE is equal to 97.1%, which means that 97.1% of the pixels in the left eye region localized by the proposed algorithm coincide with the same pixels in the left eye region localized manually. The accuracy of localization depends on the distance from the camera. It is presented in Table 1 . The same conclusion, regarding the dependency of localization on the distance from the camera, comes from the analysis of the average temperature of the eye region for the tested thermal images (Fig. 12) . The difference between temperature obtained from the algorithm and axilla temperature is the smallest for the 1.5 m distance and is about 0.1°C. Of course, this relationship will change once the infrared thermal imager is changed, particularly with different detector resolutions -when the resolution increases then the allowable distance also increases. This experiment shows that the best distance for temperature measurement is about 1.5 m. At distances greater than 1.5 m the number of pixels in the tested regions dramatically decreases; on the other hand, at distances of less than 1.5 m the field of view of the thermal camera should be considered. Fig. 13 represents the decreasing trend of the number of pixels, which is qualified by the algorithm of the inner canthus of the eye region. In conjunction with information from Table 1 , this shows the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The thermal image has 110 592 pixels, the algorithm gives good results for a set of pixels representing about 0.1% of the total number of pixels. Next, experiments show the comparison between the proposed method, the SHT and RHT. The comparison was based on the average accuracy of the localization of the regions (see Table 2 ) and on the computational complexity (see Table 3 ). The experiment was performed on a PC class computer with a 2.8 GHz processor and 2 GB of RAM memory. The SHT allows good results to be obtained, especially if average accuracy is to be taken into consideration. The result confirms the HT theory, it is a very accurate method, but, in the standard form, the time complexity is unacceptable. The average time complexity of about 4 s results from the method of image analysis -every pixel in the image must be examined in 5-dimensional space. The proposed method decreases the time complexity with accuracy on a similar level as the RHT method. Simple calculations, based on selected face area with different number of pixels, show that the time complexity decreases linear with number of pixels. On the output of the proposed algorithm, we have a thermal image with marked regions, geometrical statistics and the temperature in the localized regions. For example, Fig. 14 shows an example of an output thermal image with marked regions of the face and the eyes. The calculated parameters are given. Ellipses of the face and eye regions are always models of the face, thus never perfectly matched to the shape of the real examined face. Geometric parameters of the face showed: O = (214, 150) pixels at the center of the ellipse and about 87°to be the angle of the vertical axis. Similar information is obtained for the left/right eye region and the left/right inner canthus of the eye. In Table 4 the temperature is shown for one of the thermal image samples. The absolute error, calculated as a difference between temperature obtained from the proposed method and measured by the reference sensor, is less than +0.2°C.
