The turkey Th1 cytokines IFN-␥, IL-12␤ and IL-18 have all been characterised previously (Balu and Kaiser, 2003; Kaiser, 2007; Lawson et al., 2001) but no reagents have been available to investigate the turkey Th2 response or regulatory response. Turkey IL-10 cDNA was amplified from RNA from PMAstimulated turkey splenocytes by RT-PCR, using primers based on the chicken IL-10 cDNA sequence. The coding sequence of 528 nt from start to stop codon was identified and encodes a 175 aa polypeptide (Fig. 1) . Sequence identity between turkey IL-10 and human IL-10 is 61.9% and 42.5% at the nt and aa levels, respectively. Turkey and murine IL-10 share 57.6% and 39.1% nt and aa identity, respectively. Identity between chicken and turkey IL-10 is high, with 94.1% and 92% identity at the nt and aa levels respectively, with complete conservation of the IL-10 family signature motif, G-X-X Fig. 1 ). All cysteine residues in IL-10 are conserved between the chicken and turkey and all hydrophobic aa of the heptad repeats are conserved, suggesting that turkey IL-10 has six ␣-helices, as do chicken and mammalian IL-10. The cDNA sequence was submitted to Ensembl with the Acc. No. AM493432.
