The bacterial colonies on each plate were counted and the types of bacteria were classified with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MicroflexLT/SH. BRUKER, Germany). For the surface study, the colony form unit (CFU)/cm 2 is the number of colonies counted on each plate. For the air pathogen culture, results were reported as total CFU per plate. When CFU was over 100 per plate, results were reported as 100.
