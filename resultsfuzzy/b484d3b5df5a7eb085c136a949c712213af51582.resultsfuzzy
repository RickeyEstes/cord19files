We apply the proposed method to the Hong Kong residential housing price indices. The results are summarized in Table 2 where " âˆš " represents that a jump point is detected for a housing price index in that period of time. The discussions on the jump points are as follows. The first one was the BSD for non-permanent residents and foreign companies and the second one was to adjust the rates and extend the SSD for another 3 years. In February 2013, the HKSAR government announced new stamp duty measures, DSD, to double the rates of stamp duty on property transactions, applicable to all persons, except Hong Kong permanent residents buying residential properties but who do not own any residential property in Hong Kong at the date of agreement. After the HKMA further tightened the prudential measures, the property market experienced a period of consolidation in 2013. Residential property price inflation was softened and speculative transactions almost vanished. Jump points in most of the domestic price indices are detected to reflect the policies issued during the period 2013M1-M3. We shall compare our proposed method with the wavelet approach in Hui et al. (2010) . Briefing speaking, this approach applied discrete wavelet transform with Haar wavelet to the time series of housing price indices and the jump points were detected by the hard threshold on the wavelet coefficients. Since the dataset used in Hui et al. (2010) is monthly price indices from January 1993 (1993M01) to December 2006 (2006M12), we shall apply our proposed method to the same dataset and the results are shown in Table 3 . The discussions on the jump points for our approach are as follows. (a) The U.S. experienced an interest rate hike cycle in [1993] [1994] which in turn significantly affected the Hong Kong real estate market and stock market. In our analysis, jump points are detected for the domestic price index of all classes in the period 1993M9-1993M11. (b) In February 1994, the HKMA made two prudential recommendations to the banks to maintain their ration of property lending to loans. The recommendations were (i) to introduce a 40% benchmark for property lending by financial institutions and (ii) to propose a benchmark on the growth of property lending at Table 3 Jump points detected by the proposed method (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) . between 20 and 23 October 1997. At least up till early 1999, the crisis had not yet been over and the general atmosphere in the economy remained pessimistic. The financial sector was the first to suffer from this economic turmoil while Hong Kong was mired in an economic recession throughout 1998. In the subsequent correction in the wake of the Asian financial crisis, real property prices dropped by more than 40% between the last quarter of 1997 and the last quarter of 1998, returning to their levels in the early 1990s. As the Asian financial crisis has a disastrous effect on the real estate, changes in prices of private domestic units are detected in 1997M11-1998M1. (d) In his maiden Policy Speech on 08 October 1997, the Chief Executive of the HKSAR set out three main targets: to build at least 85,000 flats a year in the public (55,000) and private (30,000) sectors; to raise home ownership rate from 50% to 70% in ten years; and to reduce the average waiting time for public rental housing from seven to three years. In June 1998, the HKSAR government announced a nine-month moratorium on land sale and thereby disrupted the adjustment mechanism of the property market. The policy was another main factor that caused the real estate bubble burst. Hence, jump points in domestic price indices for most classes are detected in 1998M6, 1998M10 and 1998M12-1999M2. (e) The Hang Seng Index recovered from the Asian financial crisis in 1999 with a year high of 16,962 in November 1999. The residen- Table 4 Jump points detected by the wavelet approach (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) . The jump point detection results (1993M01-2006M12) using the wavelet approach are summarized in Table 4 . We observe that almost all jump points detected in Hui et al. (2010) can be detected by our method. In addition, we can also detect some jump points which are not otherwise detectable by the wavelet approach. This implies that our proposed method outperforms the wavelet approach, which is mainly due to the following reasons:
