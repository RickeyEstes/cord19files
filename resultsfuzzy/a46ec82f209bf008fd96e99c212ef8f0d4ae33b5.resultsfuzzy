For rural households, results were somewhat different. The coefficient for out-of-pocket health expenditure and health insurance payout were both statistically significant. Residential home and education spending did not have statistical significance associated with household saving. The disaggregation into 2 periods, 1990 to 2001 and 2001 to 2012 (not shown) yielded a much higher urban level of statistical significance in each of the models for the positive coefficient associated with insurer payout in the years the health insurance safety net was implemented. Note. Significant at *.1, **.01, and ***.001 levels. Results including household consumption expenditures as a share of GDP are not shown. But for urban households, only the health insurance payout had a positive relationship with household saving (0.67). For rural households, three variables showed statistical significance: out-of-pocket health expenditure, education spending, and rural household consumption/GDP. The coefficients were 1.36, −1.07, and −0.79, respectively.
