The final search strategy for each database and all ancillary searches conducted will be provided in the Additional file 1 of the final report. A flow chart, following the PRISMA guidelines [17] , will be used to illustrate where citations were eliminated during screening and ancillary searches, including information about the rationale for exclusion in full article screening. To illustrate the potential for publication bias and small study effects, a funnel plot will plot the effect estimates (horizontal axes) against the standard error (vertical axes) for each meta-analysis with n > 10 studies [29] . The results of this review will be provided via text and characteristics of studies tables in a published journal article. The tables will describe the seasonal or meteorological exposure, the outcome(s) measured, the direction and magnitude of association, and the period of study. Descriptive statistics (i.e., frequencies, proportions, missing data) will be provided as extensions of this table when appropriate or in narrative (i.e., proportion of studies with each ARI outcome). Individual study results will be presented in forest plots [17] . If heterogeneity exists, separate forest plots will be used to illustrate results by strata. If the data are too limited (i.e., fewer than two studies with the same population, exposure, outcome, and region) or are heterogeneous, the results will be presented in a forest plot without a summary effect size. A summary of findings table for key outcomes will be generated based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation [30] . A priori key outcomes will include prevalence of upper ARI and prevalence of lower ARI. Additional key outcomes identified in the systematic literature review will be documented as protocol amendments. A table will be provided to summarize the findings of the ROB assessment. This table will follow the ROB presentation suggested in the PRISMA guidelines [17] . An additional column will highlight the rationale for the study's ROB level. Maps indicating the specific location of studies (point map) will be generated. Climate zones will be indicated on each map (e.g., tropical, temperate, or arctic).
