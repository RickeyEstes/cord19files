A reference range for haematological parameters is given in Table 6 .2. The haematological picture gives an indication of the general health status of a rabbit. Stress and a range of diseases will alter haematological parameters. Hinton et al. (1982) analysed the haematolog-• Rabbit blood clots quickly and haemolyses easily • Food deprivation does not guarantee a fasting blood sample as rabbits ingest caecotrophs • Stress associated with transport or handling can affect parameters such as blood glucose and the distribution of neutrophils and lymphocytes • Pregnancy, anaesthesia, blood collection techniques and intravenous fluid therapy will influence some blood results • Time of day can influence blood results as many parameters follow a duirnal rhythm in common with many physiological processes in rabbits • Laboratory reference ranges are often derived from animals of the same breed and strain. Pet rabbits come from a more genetically diverse population • Reference ranges for pet rabbits are often an amalgamation of laboratory reference ranges that can be so wide that almost any result will fall within them • Different analytical techniques can result in disparity between laboratory reference ranges • Automated flow cytometry is not suitable for differential white cell counts in rabbits. Accurate results can only be obtained by manual counting methods. ical findings in 117 healthy and diseased rabbits and found that blood cellularity was a good indicator of disease especially with regard to erythrocyte and lymphocyte counts. These findings are in agreement with studies of experimental infections in rabbits Krueger, 1988, 1989) and in a clinical study by Harcourt-Brown and Baker (2001) . In this study, significantly higher red cell counts, haemoglobin values, haematocrits and lymphocyte counts were found in rabbits kept outside with unlimited access to grazing and exercise. A comparison was made with rabbits kept in hutches and those suffering from dental disease (see Figure 6 .1).
