We found 56 publications describing the development and testing of 49 classification workflows, of which three were unavailable for download or online use and two were only available upon request (Table 1) . Among these were 24 virusspecific workflows, while 25 were developed for broader use, such as classification of bacteria and archaea. The information of the unavailable workflows has been summarized, but they were not included in the decision trees. An overview of all publications, workflows and scoring criteria is available in Data Sheet 1 and on https://compare.cbs.dtu.dk/inventory#pipeline.
