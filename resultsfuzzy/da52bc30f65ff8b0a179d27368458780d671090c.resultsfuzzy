A set of ANOVAs were calculated at T1 and T2 separately, defining sex (male, female) and age (< = 29 years, > = 30 years) as predictors of T1/T2 intentions and T1/T2 behaviors. Educational level was not considered as a predictor because the sample size was insufficient for the group of less formal education. Results of the first set of ANOVA revealed a significant effect of sex on T1 intentions (F [1,294] = 6.240, p < .01) and T1 behavior (F [1,359] = 8.790, p < .01). In both cases, females presented significantly higher scores as compared to males. Moreover, in the second ANOVA was found that age had a significant effect on T1 intentions (F [1,294] = 7.797, p < .05) and T1 behavior (F [1,359] = 5.659, p < .05). Here, older participants reported higher frequency in the use of handwashing behaviors as compared with younger participants. Results are consistent with literature and confirmed our expectations only for T1. Table 2 shows the Product-Moment Correlations (pairwise solutions) between T1/T2 predictors (risk perception, self-efficacy) and T1/T2 criterion variables (intentions, behaviors). At T1 and T2, self-efficacy was positively correlated with intentions and behavior (p < .05, p < .01, respectively). A similar type of positive correlations emerged from analyses between T1/T2 intentions and T1/T2 behaviors (p < .01). Results are consistent with literature and confirmed our expectations for T1 and T2. Correlations were moderated too low and consistent with theoretical assumptions.
