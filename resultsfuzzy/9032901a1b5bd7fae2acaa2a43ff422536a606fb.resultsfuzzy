To determine the causative agent of the diarrhea outbreaks, pigs with severe diarrhea was euthanized using nano-nest PCR. Based on the classical and variant PEDV strains, the same sequence designed a fragment of 817 bp outer primers and the different region set inner primers of 295 bp. When the outer primers were simultaneously amplified, the classical and variant strains of PEDV displayed conserved regions. However, the inner primer only identified the variant strain and did not amplify the classical strain. Results showed that the sample was positive for PEDV variant strains (Fig. 1) . Of 26 specimens with diarrhea symptom, 23 samples were detected as PEDV positive, and the positive rate was 88.46% (23/26). All of the PEDV-positive samples (n = 23), the positive rate of the PEDV variant strains was 80.77% (21/ 26). The viruses were successfully propagated in Vero-E6 cells, the CPE are shown in (Fig. 2B) . The Vero-E6 cells that infected by PEDV of round shaped and shedding. These viruses can be passaged on Vero-E6 cells stably and named as PEDV CH/JLDH/2016 (Accession No.MF346935). After conventional negative staining, the complete virus with a typical coronavirus structure were showed under the transmission electron microscope. The virus had petal-like fibrils on the surface, and the diameter of the virus (including the fibrous) was about 100 nm-120 nm (Fig. 3A) . The process of replication and release of PEDV virus particles in the endoplasmic reticulum was observed under electron microscope. As the pictures showed that PEDV which is oral or round shape, likes crown, surrounding with fiber and was pictured at 20 h after infected that entered the cells by endocytosis (Fig. 3B) . No virions were observed in Vero-E6 cells without PEDV infection. The PEDV propagation successfully in the Vero-E6 cells cultures was confirmed by electron microscopy observation. The IFA method was used on Vero-E6 cells. Specific green fluorescence was visible in Vero cells 24 h post-infection with CH/JLDH/2016 isolated (Fig. 4A ), but no fluorescence was detected in control cultures (Fig. 4B) . The results showed that PEDV were successfully cultured in the Vero-E6 cells.
