The EtOAc-soluble fraction of methanolic extract of the stems of T. regelii was repeatedly subjected to silica gel and ODS columns, and then purified by preparative and/or semi-preparative HPLC to yield three new triterpenoids (1-3 (Table 1 ) displayed 29 carbon signals, including signals of a carboxylic carbon (δc 182.7, C-29), a conjugated ester carbonyl carbon (δc 163.8, C-2), three double bonds, six quaternary carbons (including a ketal one), one methine, seven methylenes, and seven methyl groups (including an oxygenated one), which were accounted for five degrees of unsaturation. These characteristic data suggested 1 to be a dinor-friedelene derivative with five rings [22] [23] [24] . Comparison of the 1 H and 13 C NMR data of 1 with those of dzununcanone [22, 24] , a 3,24-dinor-2,4-seco-friedelene triterpene, indicated both compounds bearing similar B-, C-, D-and E-rings. The downfield shift of C-29 (δc 182.7) in 1 relative to that (δc 179.1) in dzununcanone [22, 24] implied a carboxylic acid group present at C-29 in 1 instead of the methyl ester in dzununcanone. The remaining signals of 1 showed a olefinic carbon (δc 110.3, C-1), a conjugated carbonyl carbon (δc 163.8, C-2), a ketal carbon (δc 103.8, C-4), a tertiary methyl (δc 24.8, C-23) and a methoxyl (δc 50.5) groups. The upfield shift of the C-2 carbonyl (δc 163.8) in 1 relative to that (δc 166.1) in dzununcanone revealed that an α,β-unsaturated δ-lactone ring was formed between C-2 and C-4 in 1, accounting for the remaining one degree of unsaturation. Both the methoxyl and the tertiary methyl groups were assigned at C-4, as deduced from HMBC correlations from their protons to C-4 (δ C 103.8) in 1. Thus, the planar structure of 1 was established as a 2, 4-esterified derivative of dzununcanone, which was further confirmed by 1 H − 1 H COSY and HMBC correlations ( Fig. 2A) . The relative configuration of 1 was determined by analysis of ROESY spectrum (Fig. 2B) . The observed key correlation between C-4 methoxy protons and H 3 -25β indicated that the methoxyl group at C-4 was βoriented. The remaining stereogenic centers in 1 were assigned as the same relative configurations with those in dzununcanone, as evidenced from the important ROESY correlations of H 3 -25/H 3 -26, H 3 -26/H 3 -28, and H 3 -28/H 3 -30. Therefore, the structure of 1 was characterized as shown in Fig. 1, and (Table 1) of 2 are closely similar to those of 1 except for the downfield shifts of C-4 and C-23 (δ C 105.6 and 28.2) relative to those (δ C 103.8 and 24.8) in 1. These data were indicative of different configuration of the C-4 stereogenic center of both compounds. Moreover, a key ROESY correlation between H 3 -23 and H 3 -25β was observed, revealing an α-orientation of the methoxy group at C-4. Therefore, the structure of 2 was elucidated as a 4-epimer of 1, and given a trivial name of triregelolide B. Compound 3 was obtained as amorphous powder. The molecular formula was determined as C 30 (Table 1 ) of 3 showed 30 carbon signals, which were ascribed to a carboxylic group (δ C 182.2, C-29), two olefinic carbons [δ C 158.4 (C-14) and 117.1 (C-15)], five methines (including two oxygenated ones), six quaternary carbons, nine methylenes, and seven methyl carbons by DEPT and HMBC experiments. These characteristic signals indicated that 3 was a taraxerene-type triterpene [25] [26] [27] . The 1 H and 13 C NMR data of 3 were very similar to those of esculentoic acid A [26] isolated from Manihot esculenta, except for the presence of an additional oxygenated methine [δ H 4.13 (1H, td, J = 9.6, 4.2 Hz, H-2); δ C 68.6] and the absence of a methylene signals (δ H 1.78 and 1.60; δ C 25.3) in esculentoic acid A [26] . The downfield shift of H-2 at δ H 4.13 suggested hydroxylation of C-2 in 3 compared to those (δ H 1.78 and 1.60) in esculentoic acid A [26] . The coupling constant of 9.6 Hz between H-2 and H-3 (J 2, 3 ) indicated a 2,3-trans diaxial relationship of the above two protons in 3, whereas the H-3 was in a equatorial bond in esculentoic acid due to a smaller J 2, 3 of 2.8 Hz. The key NOESY correlations of H-2/H 3 -25β, and H-3/H-5α suggested an αoriented hydroxyl group at C-2 and a β-oriented hydroxyl group at C-3 in 3. Thus, the structure of 3 was determined as 2α, 3βdihydroxytaraxer-14-ene-29-oic acid, and named triregeloic acid. In addition, twenty known triterpenoids were also isolated and identified as NST6A (4) [28] , celastrol (5) [29, 30] , 22β-hydroxytingenone (6) [31] , triptocalline A (7) [32] , polpunonic acid (8) [33] , orthophenic acid (9) [31] , demethylzeylasteral (10) [30] , wilforol A (11) [31] , regelin D (12) [19] , triptotriterpenic acid B (13) [34, 35] , ⁎ All compounds except for 21, showed significant (p b 0.05) inhibitory effects on the proliferation of MCF-7 cells compared to the vehicle control group. The value of p b 0.001 when statistical comparison was conducted between either compound 5 or 6 with taxol. a Other triterpenes were not evaluated for cytotoxicity due to the limited amount obtained. b The inhibitory rate (%) on MCF-7 cells was determined at a drug concentration of 10 μM.
