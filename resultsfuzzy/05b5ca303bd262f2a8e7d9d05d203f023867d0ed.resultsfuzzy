Kex2p contains an aromatic residue (Tyr) in its cytoplasmic domain that is essential for its efficient retention in the Golgi (Wilcox et al., 1992) . That study combined with our analysis of DPAP A raises the question of whether multiple Golgi membrane proteins are recognized via the same retention "machinery" or whether each membrane protein is recognized and retained by a separate mechanism. To address this (vector with no insert; first two lanes), pCW-KX20 (wild-type Kex2p under control of the GAL/promoter as described by Wilcox et al., 1992 ; WTlanes), pCW-KX21 (derivative of pCW-KX20 containing the Y713A mutation; Y713A lanes), and pCW-KX27 (derivative of pCW-KX20 containing the C-tailA mutation; C-tailA lanes). The ceils were grown overnight in the presence of 2 % galactose, 35S-labeled for 30 min, and chased for 2 h in the presence of 50 #g/ml each of methionine and cysteine, whereupon immunoprecipitation was carried out as in Fig. 6. question we exploited the earlier observation that overproduction of DPAP A caused a portion of DPAP A to be mislocalized to the vacuolar membrane (Roberts et al., 1992) . This result suggested that mislocalization could be achieved by overwhelming the putative Golgi retention machinery with high levels of ligand. If the retention machinery recognizes both DPAP A (or A-ALP) and Kex2p, then overexpression of one protein might lead to mislocalization of the other. To test this idea, we 35S-labeled pho8A yeast cells carrying A-ALP alone on a single copy plasmid, or A-ALP with a plasmid overexpressing Kex2p from the GAL/ promoter (Johnston and Davis, 1984) , and immunoprecipitated A-ALP after 120 min of chase (Fig. 9) . No processing was observed in the presence of normal Kex2p levels but when wild-type Kex2p was overproduced (,M5-fold) a significant fraction of the A-ALP protein underwent PEP4-dependent processing (29%). However, the same level of overproduction of retention-defective mutant versions of Kex2p (Wilcox et al., 1992) lacking a critical tyrosine residue (Y713A) or the entire cytoplasmic tail (C-tailA; removes residues 702-814) resulted in greatly diminished levels of A-ALP reaching the vacuole (8 and <3% processing, respectively). Thus, A-ALP was less efficiently retained in the Golgi when wild type but not mutant Kex2p was overproduced, suggesting that the cytoplasmic retention signals of the two proteins may be recognized by the same retention machinery. It should be noted that although 'M5-fold Kex2p overproduction significantly increases the rate at which A-ALP reaches the vacuole, the majority of A-ALP protein in the steady state localizes to the Golgi under these conditions ( Fig. 4; data not shown). Similarly, F87V-A-ALP, which ex-hibits a slow but significant rate of PEP4-dependent processing (tu2 = 165 min), also exhibits Golgi complex staining (data not shown). Finally, Kex2p overproduction did not have an effect on processing and secretion of or-factor demonstrafing that general Golgi functions are intact under these conditions (data not shown).
