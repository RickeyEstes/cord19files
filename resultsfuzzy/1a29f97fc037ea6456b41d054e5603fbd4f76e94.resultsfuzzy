Sequencing data from the F-gene analysis showed that the 24 isolates from wild birds in Brazil, Bulgaria, Ukraine and the USA contained fusion protein cleavage sites specific for NDV of low virulence with two basic amino acids between residue positions 113 and 116 and a leucine at position 117 ( 113 RQGR#L 117 ) [59] . As a result of the preliminary phylogenetic analysis including all available sequences from GenBank and the 24 sequences obtained in this study (data not shown), 54 viral sequences that were evolutionarily closely related to reference vaccine strains from genotypes I and II were selected for further analysis. The corresponding data about these selected viruses are presented in Table 1 . Utilizing established criteria, the 24 NDV sequences were classified as members of genotype II of class II [81] . Nine of them clustered together with the vaccine strain chicken/USA/LaSota/1946, while the other 15 isolates grouped with two additional ND vaccine strains of genotype II-chicken/USA/HitchnerB1/1947 and turkey/USA/VG/GA/1989 (Fig 1) . Fig 1 illustrates the distribution of the isolates from wild birds that are genetically closely related to vaccine strains of NDV genotype I and II. Within genotype II, 28 isolates from wild birds originating from Argentina, Bulgaria, China, India, Mexico and Ukraine clustered in a monophyletic branch with the vaccine strain chicken/USA/LaSota/1946. The mean genetic distance between this vaccine strain and the isolates within the branch was considerably low (0.2%). Within the same genotype, another 19 wild bird isolates from Brazil, China and USA grouped together with vaccine strains chicken/USA/HitchnerB1/1947 and turkey/USA/VG/ GA/1989. The genetic analysis showed that the latter isolates of wild-bird origin displayed genetic distance of 0.3-0.4% when compared to these two vaccine strains. Similarly, seven wild-bird NDV isolates of genotype I of class II also showed close phylogenetic relationship with vaccine strains. Five Mexican isolates of wild-bird origin from 2009 clustered with the vaccine strain PHY-LMV42/1966, while two 2009 and 2011 Chinese isolates of duck origin grouped closely together in the phylogram with the vaccine strain chicken/Australia/Queensland/V-4/1966 (Fig 1) . The mean genetic distance between the viruses and the vaccine strains within each of these genotype I branches was 0.2%. Pairwise distance and pairwise distance per decade results among viruses within of the described groups are presented in S7, S8 and S9 Tables. Based on the above results and the pairwise distances per decade (from 0.009% to 0.093%), the 54 viruses from these groups were determined as "vaccine-derived". Our data indicate that at least 17 species from ten avian orders occupying different habitats excreted vaccine-derived NDV ( Table 1 ). The most frequent isolations occurred in the orders Columbiformes (n = 23) and Anseriformes (n = 13), with occasional isolations from eight other orders. The oldest isolation detected occurred in 1997 and the most recent in 2014 with samples from free-ranging (n = 47) and captive (n = 7) birds. The obtained results demonstrate that vaccine-derived NDV were detected in eight countries on four different continents. Lastly, some of the vaccine-derived viruses were obtained from wild birds representing declining species or species at imminent risk of decline according to international standards and conservation working groups (Table 1 ). These species of special concern include the Highland Guan (Penelopina nigra), Red-lored Amazon (Amazona autumnalis), Yellow-naped Amazon (Amazona auropalliata), Vinaceous-breasted Amazon (Amazona vinacea), Chilean Flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis), and an endemic Psittacine from India, a country where all Psittacines are facing declines [82] .
