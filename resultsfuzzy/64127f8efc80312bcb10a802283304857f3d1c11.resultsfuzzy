The common usage of the 95% confidence interval to establish reference intervals means that 5% of healthy animals will be reported as abnormal for a given test. When multiple tests are done in laboratory medicine profiles, the probability of at least one test being abnormal increases with the number of tests done. For example, there is a 64% chance that at least one abnormal test result will be obtained when 20 analytes are measured from a healthy animal. 6 The degree to which a test result is above or below the reference interval is generally important in deciding whether a high or low value should be taken seriously.
