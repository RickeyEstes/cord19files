In this section, we review some definitions and some results of fractional Caputo derivative. To get more details, the reader can refer to: [24] [25] [26] [27] for example. The Caputo fractional derivative of order α is defined as where α ∈ R + is the order of integration, and is the Euler Gamma function. Caputo derivative and the Riemann-Liouville integral satisfy the following properties [24]  In this work, we study fractional differential system where 0 < α < 1, so the last formula becomes In this section, we carry out some numerical results with forward Euler method and variational iteration method for the fractional order SIS model (19) by using different values for the epidemiological parameters b, β and γ . In our case, we use α = 0 . 95 , 0 . 9 , 0 . 99 , 1 . We consider the fractional problem (19) . If we apply fractional VIM method so, the successive approximations I n ( t ) of the solution I ( t ) could be manually obtained. Consequently, the solution is given by Eq. (20) . In hand manipulation, one can not easily calculate beyond the third term which is given by formula (32) . as where as when α is approaching to 1, this numerical analysis is often used in different papers see [4, 7, 9, 12] and [13] , we conclude that the fractional model generalizes the ordinary one (19) , furthermore, from the same figures, we remark that if the fractional derivative order decreases, the disease takes more time to be eradicated (presence of memory effect). In Figs. 4 and 6 we compare the numerical solution with forward Euler method and variational iteration method, the polynomial used to approximate the solution in Fig. 6 is the vim polynomial of degree 37 α, where the polynomial using in Fig. 4 is the vim polynomial of degree 3 α. The theoretical VIM method produces a section of symbolic terms of analytical solution, that are hardly to be calculated manually beyond first terms, which makes this method only effective for small time intervals, by the programmed function Vimfrac(b, c, d, alpha, n) we have avoided this restriction, by comparing Figs. 4 and 6 , one can remarks the following: the numerical solution is more effective as n increases ( I n ( t )).
