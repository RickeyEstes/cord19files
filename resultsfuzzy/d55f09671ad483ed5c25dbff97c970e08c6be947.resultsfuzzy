We genotyped the VNTR polymorphism of DC-SIGNR neck region among 361 peri-centenarian individuals and 342 matched young individuals in Han Chinese. The homozygote proportion, genotype and allele frequencies of the VNTR were listed in Table 1 . A length variation ranged from 5 repeats to 9 repeats in this VNTR locus were observed in our samples, and these different repeats (alleles) form 11 genotype. The most common genotype in our population is 7/7 (homozygote for the allele of 7repeats), followed by 5/7 and 7/9. The allele 7 has the highest frequency of 66.6%, followed by allele 5 of 15.5%, allele 9 of 14.15% and allele 6 of 3.62%. The allele 8 was fairly rare in Han Chinese population with a frequency of only 0.13%. The genotype frequencies of pericentenarian and control population did not deviate from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p > 0.05, by both chisquare and a Markov chain method in GENEPOP). Our results indicated that there was no significant difference in the homozygote proportion, genotype distribution and allele frequencies between the two groups. While, as we know, animals from a broad variety of taxa show sex differences in lifespan, for example, in mammals and insects, females commonly live longer than males [22, 23] , but males outlive females in most bird taxa [24] . To investigate whether there is a potential difference in our samples introduced by gender, we further divided the two groups into four: female peri-centenarian, male peri-centenarian, female control and male control. All groups also followed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The result indicated that there was more 6/7 genotype in female peri-centenarian group than that in control group (Table 2 ) with a marginal level of significance (5.56 vs. 1.28%, p = 0.041), but this difference was no longer significant after correction by Bonferroni method. It seems that the 6/7 genotype may show a false positive association due to multiple testing. However, we cannot exclude a functional role of 6/7 genotype and the hypothesis that the effect of DC-SIGNR on longevity maybe different between males and females. Considering the relative small sample size of this study, our hypothesis needs to be replicated with larger sample size. Genetic factors are crucial in the ageing process and thus, also influence longevity. Mitchell et al. estimated a 25% heritability for the life-span in an Amish population in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania [25] , which implied a relatively strong genetic impact on human life-span. However, many genetic factors and signaling pathways involved in ageing process are still unknown [26, 27] . Here we hypothesized that genes which control immune response to infectious disease are likely related with longevity, but immune-related genes usually present a very high polymorphism and thus are prone to be confounded by population stratification in regular case-control studies [28] . For example, our former study suggested that a previously unrecognized population stratification, which was a geographic difference in genotype proportions and allele frequencies of the neck region of DC-SIGNR, existed in the Chinese of different geographic areas [18] . However, in the present study, our peri-centenarian and control groups came from the same community, and were ethnically matched, thus the spurious association caused by population stratification could be ruled out. Furthermore, all participants shared the same living environment and common diet habits, thus non-genetic factors were averted to the greatest extent. A total of 11 genotypes and 5 alleles in neck region tandem repeat of DC-SIGNR were investigated in this population. The distributions of genotype and allele frequencies were similar to previous reports on Han Chinese populations [11, 29] . Although there were reports suggesting a balanced selection could sharpen the alleles frequencies of this locus [30] , the absence of association between the neck region polymorphism of DC-SIGNR and longevity in Han Chinese population may be caused by various reasons. First, most of the peri-centenarian individuals in this study had lower chance to get infectious diseases, as they were collected from Dujiangyan in Sichuan province, a relative isolated and remote region, i.e. the selection pressure on this locus was relaxed. For example, the sudden outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003 was extensive in China but did not spread to this region [31, 32] . Furthermore, the HIV-1 case was rare in the region we studied. In this case, many infectious diseases could not exert selective pressure on such population. This may be one explanation as to why we could not find an association between the neck region polymorphism of DC-SIGNR and longevity. Another explanation for our result might be the relative small sample size in our study, especially when the sam- ples were stratified by gender, which is also a handicap in many association studies. Therefore, replication with a larger sample size may improve our understanding on the consequence of this polymorphism and provide more explorative data about the potential influence of this gene on human longevity. After all, it was equally likely that DC-SIGNR gene did not have a role in healthy aging of human beings.
