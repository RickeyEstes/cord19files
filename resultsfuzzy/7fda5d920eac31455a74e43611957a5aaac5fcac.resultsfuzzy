As mentioned above, in contrast to the standard and RNG k-ε models, which are inherently time-averaged approaches for turbulence simulation, one of the advantages of LES is its ability to capture the instantaneous turbulences. Hence, besides the time-averaged airflow conditions, the root-mean-square (RMS) velocity, which is a measure of the magnitude of time-dependent fluctuating velocity, is also employed to estimate the quality of LES using the MRT-LB method. A comparison of RMS velocities simulated by the MRT-LB method and the other three numerical models is shown in Fig. 7 . It can be clearly seen that the MRT-LB method produces results very similar to the RNG LES, especially in the left zone of the model room as well as the inlet jet flow region. They predict significantly higher (one order) RMS velocities than the standard and RNG k-ε models. This indicates that the LES using MRT-LB method can perform as well as the RNG LES and can provide better predictions of the turbulent airflow characteristics than the time-averaged approach.
