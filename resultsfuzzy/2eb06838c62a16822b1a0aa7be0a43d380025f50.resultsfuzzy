Variables in the ITT Group. The results of a -test performed to evaluate significant differences between 2 groups before and after ingesting the test food materials verified that the duration of cold symptoms ( value = 0.5748) and cold symptom levels ( value = 0.2462) at visit 1 were not significant at a significance level of 5%. Statistical analysis also showed that no difference occurred between test groups prior to the ingestion of food materials. During visit 3, the duration of cold symptoms in the experiment group (3.1579 ± 4.4814 days) was lower than that of the placebo group (6.6842 ± 9.3581 days). The difference between the test groups was statistically significant ( value = 0.0410). The EAP group also had a lower score for cold symptom levels than the placebo group (8.7105 ± 13.7269 versus 18.3421 ± 30.1566, resp.). This difference was significant at a level of 10% ( value = 0.0790) but not 5% (Figure 2 ). were verified with respect to the mean difference of each measured item between the visitation times to assess the effectiveness of the test food materials on the blood test results. The results were not significantly different between the EAP and placebo groups (Table 5 ) at a significance level of 5%. For WBC, basophil, and lymphocyte counts that Wilcoxon's rank-sum test was used to analyze variables that did not follow normality. Missing values were replaced with averages and used in the ITT group data analysis. did not follow normality, a nonparametric Wilcoxon's ranksum test was conducted. The results were not significantly different between the EAP and placebo groups (Table 6 ) at a significance level of 5%. To assess the effectiveness of the test food materials, a -test was conducted to evaluate significance differences in the mean cytokine concentrations between visits 1-3. The results were not significantly different between the EAP and placebo groups (Table 7 ) at a significance level of 5%. IL-10, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-values did not satisfy normality; a nonparametric statistics Wilcoxon's ranksum test was conducted, revealing no significant differences in any of the items at a significance level of 5% (Table 8) .
