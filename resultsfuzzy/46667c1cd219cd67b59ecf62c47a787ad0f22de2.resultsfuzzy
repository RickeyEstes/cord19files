The permutation entropy and the statistical complexity are calculated for embedding dimension D = 4 and delay τ = 1, based on the B&P criterion that satisfies M ≫ D!. We also performed the analysis for two extra embedding dimensions D = 3 and D = 5. The results seem to be independent of the embedding dimension selected for the symbolic reconstruction of the original time series, therefore we focus on D = 4. We start our analysis by presenting in Fig. 1, panel (a) and (b), the Shannon Complexity-Entropy Causality Plane (CECP) for all Real Estate indices in Hong Kong, partitioned by size and location. Panel (a) presents the calculated quantifiers of the pre-crisis period based on size indices. All indices before the crisis appear to have higher permutation entropy and lower complexity value, than the quantifiers of the post-crisis period. In particular, prior to the crisis entropy and complexity values range from 0.914 to 0.929 and 0.079 to 0.095 and after the outbreak of the crisis, the quantifiers are 0.878 to 0.91 and 0.095 to 0.126 respectively. It can be concluded that the financial crisis has affected the dynamic structure of the indices, increasing their regularity and predictability. In terms of efficiency, which according to Fama's sense means that the time series are random, the General index and the Large and Small/Medium size flats indices show a lower efficiency level, during the post-crisis period, compared with the prior period. In other words, the results for the post-crisis period suggest that last week's price influence next week's price. Panel (b), Fig. 1 , presents the analysis of the four sub-regions of Hong Kong, namely Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, New Territories East, and New Territories West. Although most indices depict the same picture as the one with the size, where the after crisis period quantifiers exhibit lower permutation and higher complexity than with the pre crisis period, Kowloon index behave much differently. Based on the quantifiers, the index for the post-crisis period exhibits higher permutation and lower complexity than the pre-crisis period, signifying that the dynamical structure of the Kowloon index is affected the opposite than the other indices. Likely, the index was not affected by the crisis, evidently by the increased informational efficiency which by the way, is higher than the level before the crisis. A possible explanation of the apparent departure could be found on the following reasons. Kowloon is a major part of the decentralized trend, due to Hong Kong Island's high prices for office and retail space, and, also, a major recipient of strong demand for residential space manifestly by the major construction projects that took place, especially after the second half of the 2000-decade. In order to show the robustness of the previous results we present in Fig. 1 the quantifiers of the shuffled data. Please note that the quantifiers of the shuffled data are close to 1 in terms of permutation and 0 for statistical complexity, necessary conditions for a time series to be considered as a Gaussian random process (white noise). According to Fama's notion, this optimal combination (1, 0) characterizes the strong form of the EMH, where the market is strongly efficient reflecting both private and public available information. For the exact estimation of all quantifiers for each sub-period with embedding dimension D = 4 and τ = 1 are detailed in Table 1 . In order to compare the results, derived by the symbolic permutation entropy, with the Hurst exponent h, we generate a time series with the use of the fractional Brownian motion. As is well known, values of h = 0.5 means that the process is purely random while values of over 0.5 means that positive (or negative) steps are followed by positive (or negative) steps. If the value is less than 0.5 then a positive step is followed by a negative step and the opposite. Thus, we perform the analysis of fractional Brownian motions (fBms) using different Hurst exponents. Although there is a wide use of correlated stochastic processes for financial time series modeling, in our case, we generate 1000 numerical independent realizations of fBms with Hurst exponent h ∈ {0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, 0.45, 0.50, 0.55, 0.60, 0.65, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90}. The length of data is N = 1010 data points and we use the algorithm proposed by Abry and Sellan [46] , and Bardet et al. [47] . The fBms generated curves are illustrated in Fig. 1 in both panels, along with the quantifiers from the permutation entropy method. The values of the entropy complexity plane as discussed before are very close to the ones obtained by fBms process, meaning that they share some similar dynamical properties. The h exponents of fBms are within the range of 0.5-0.7, and few of them close to 0.5, particularly for the pre-crisis period, a sign of uncorrelated dynamics. Next we consider the Tsallis q entropy and complexity, and present in Fig. 2 the q-complexity-entropy curve. Using the fractional Brownian motion, following Hosking's procedure (Hosking [48] ) we apply various Hurst exponents (0.2, 0.3, . . ., 0.9) for the embedding dimension D = 3 and D = 4. The plots are average values from 100 realizations of 1000 length time series of the entropy and complexity causality plane, with the parameter q ranging from q = 0+ to q = 1000 with 10 3 evenly spaced points between them. The D = 3 and D = 4 results of our Real Estate indices in Fig. 2 , panel (a) and (b) resemble those of the fractional Brownian motion in the last two panels (c) and (d). All form loops with different size for the pre and after crisis period and the larger the value of h the broader the loop. Since most of the indices behave similarly as the General index, we present only the General and the Kowloon indices. More specifically, The General index depicted in Fig. 2 revealed broader loops for the after crisis period, while for the Kowloon index, the loop for the after-crisis period is much smaller, for both D = 3 and D = 4. Except for the Kowloon case, the results confirm the notion that during the outbreak of the crisis, the housing market indices exhibit larger Hurst exponents. The dependence of q values on the Hurst exponent is shown in Fig. 3 . As in Ribeiro et al. [45] , Hurst exponent h = (0, 0.1, 0.2, . . ., 1) is presented along with minimum value of the normalized entropy, as a function of q at q = q H , and the maximum value of the complexity as a function of q, when q = q C . Fig. 3 panel (a) shows for D = 4 the positive correlation between q H and the Hurst exponent, while in panel (b) the q C increases monotonically as h increases. Panels (c) and (d) present the values of q the q = q H and q = q C for different embedding dimensions, i.e. D = 3, 4, 5. The extreme values q H and q C have similar trend, therefore we present only the General index. When D = 3, q H for both periods prior and after the crisis exhibit higher value followed by D = 4 and D = 5, respectively. On the other hand, the values of q C are almost the same for both indices, regardless of the embedded D value. All q values optimizing H q and C q are presented in Table 2 .
