We used a pangenome approach to explore the genome of SARS-CoV-2 (MN985325 and related isolates) in comparison to other Betacornaviruses, including SARS and MERS. Previous approaches 11 proceeded by extracting individual genes, aligning them, and then establishing a phylogeny. Our approach differs in that we first cluster all sequences to then calculate the alignment. This approach, based on using panX 12 , allows us to achieve a higher sensibility in the detection of gene clusters. The resulting pangenome including all core and accessory gene clusters, interactive trees and alignments from 24 Betacoronavirus genomes, including 4 isolates from SARS-CoV-2, is available at https://pangenomedb.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/. There are five essential genes in coronaviruses, the Spike protein (S), Membrane glycoprotein (M), Nucleocapsid (N), envelope protein (E) and the Orf1ab (a large polyprotein known as replicase/protease), all required to produce a structurally complete viral particle 13 . These five genes define the core pan-genome. However, panX 12 only retrieved four of these (S, M, N and the ORF1ab) as components of the core pan-genome ( Figure 1 ). However, the fifth gene in the Betacoronavirus core genome, the envelope protein (E), varied among genomes, defining three distinct subclusters within the envelope protein E of Betacoronaviruses ( Figure 2 ). One of these E clusters comprises only SARS-CoV-1 (AY274119), SARS-CoV-2 and two Bat Coronaviruses (MG772933 and KF63652). Among the other two protein E gene clusters, one includes MERS (JX869059 and KC164505) and several coronaviruses from different animals, while the third cluster includes coronaviruses from two Rousettus bats. To validate the conservation and specificity of the SARS E cluster, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 E sequence with all known sequences in NCBI's non redundant (NR) protein database. This comparison showed, consistent with our pan-genome analysis, that the subcluster of the protein E gene appearing in SARS-CoV-2, SARS and two bat coronaviruses, is defined by the same essential functional features, which are exactly conserved (100% similarity) between bats and SARS-CoV-2, but differ slightly (95% similarity with one deletion and three substitutions) from SARS ( Figure 2B and supplementary figure 7) . A recent study compared genomes and gene families of all alpha, beta, delta and gamma coronaviruses, but did not explore the variability present within the protein E gene sequences, which we did through the clustering approach reported above. We found five accessory gene clusters (15% of the accessory genome of genus Betacoronavirus) common to SARS-like coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, out of 33 total accessory gene clusters. Four of these gene clusters (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF8, Fig. 1A ), appear only in SARS-CoV-2, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and the SARS virus. A gene cluster annotated as ORF10 appeared to be unique to SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 1) . However, a blast-based search against the DNA of all sequences in NCBI's NT database showed that the ORF10 sequence matches with 100% coverage in DNA of other SARS-like genomes, but there is no open-reading frame predicted for those genomes in the matching region ( Fig 1A) . Hence, the apparent uniqueness of ORF10 might simply be an artifact of the GeneBank annotation pipeline that did not predict an ORF for this gene in other matching genomes. However, for completeness, we report a functional analysis of ORF10 as Supplementary material (Supplementary material 1) since at present there is no experimental evidence available against or in favor of this being a real gene. Compared to the essential genes S, M, N, E and ORF1ab, other genes such as ORF3a and ORF7a are poorly characterized, according to GenBank annotations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/proteins/86693?genome_assembly_id=760344). Our bioinformatic protein structural analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a (cluster 12), also known as viroporin, and ORF7a (cluster 17), that is same as ORF8a 14 in SARS, retain the structural features observed in other SARS viruses, namely a multi-pass transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic b-barrel or b-sandwich fold (ORF3a) and an N-terminal secpathway signal peptide, cleaved after residue 15, an immunoglobulin-like b-sandwich fold stabilized by two cysteine di-sulfide bonds, and a C-terminal single-pass transmembrane helix (ORF7a; Supplementary Figures 5,6 ). Hence these SARS-CoV-2 proteins are expected to act in the same way as they do in other SARS, namely as accessory proteins mostly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment, but also occurring on the cell membrane where they enhance viral pathogenicity and mortality through protein-protein interactions [15] [16] [17] . The remaining two accessory gene clusters, ORF6, ORF8, present in SARS-CoV-2, SARS and bat-SL-CoVZC45 are functionally uncharacterized. All are very short polypeptides (61, 121 and 38 residues for ORF6 and 8, respectively) with a large percentage of hydrophobic residues (62%, 56%, respectively). None of the proteins have trans-membrane regions, but ORF8 has an N-terminal sec-pathway signal peptide with a cleavage site after residues 15, suggesting that it is secreted into the extracellular space ( Supplementary Figures 5,6 ). Following signal peptide cleavage, the ORF8 protein core is predicted to consist largely of b-strands and features 7 cysteines. We predict that this protein adopts a cysteine disulfide-bond stabilized b-sandwich structure similar to the soluble domain of ORF7a (Supplementary Figures 5,6 ), inferring that ORF8 also functions as ligand binding module. ORF6 consists of a long amphipathic helical region, followed by an acidic tail. Our deep-learning-based annotation (DeepGOPlus 18 ) suggested that ORFs 6, 7, 8 are involved in the regulation of molecular functions, either in response to stimuli (ORFs 8), or in cellular component biogenesis and organization (ORF6) (Suppl. Figure 2-4) . Collectively, our analysis suggested no major function or gene cluster to be unique to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our analysis is in agreement with ORFs 3a, 6, 7a, 8 and The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.17.952895 doi: bioRxiv preprint being accessory non-essential proteins, that would be inefficient targets for COVID-2019 therapy. The S protein binds to the host receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for preventing viral entry into host cells 1 . The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar 2 , but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3 . We therefore focused our attention on the protein E, which is highly similar in SARS-CoV. The E protein, also a viroporin 19 , was previously confirmed as a determinant of pathogenicity 4,5 in SARS-CoV-1. Protein E was used as target for SARS antivirals 6 , and studies using SARS-CoV with lacking or mutated protein E as vaccine candidates showed promising results [20] [21] [22] [23] . Furthermore, the E gene is one of the key genes used in identification of SARS-CoV-2 through RT-PCR 7,24 . The SARS-Cov-1 protein E has ion channel (IC) activity and features a postsynaptic density-95/discs large/zona occludens-1 (PDZ)-binding motif (PBM). Both IC and PBM were required for SARS-CoV to induce virulence in mice 14 . The protein E from SARS-CoV-2 differs from that of SARS-CoV-1 only by three substitutions and one deletion (Figure 2A Studies on SARS-CoV-1 demonstrated that the E protein uses the IC and PBM to trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs. Ultimately these events result in ARDS 4-6 , a leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection 7, 8 . However, the drugs Amantadine, Hexamethylene amiloride and also BIT225 (BIT225 is in clinical trials) completely block the IC activity of SARS-CoV-1 9,10 and restrict its reproduction, leading to better survival of the animal host. The PBM enables the E protein to interact with the cellular PDZ domains. Its association with the tandem PDZ domains of syntenin activates the MAP kinase p38, triggering the overexpression of inflammatory cytokines. Consequently, inhibition of p38 by SB203580 increases the survival of the host 5 . The high level of conservation of the IC and PBM within clade 2, including SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, strongly suggests that the available inhibitors for the E protein of SARS-CoV-1 should also be active on SARS-CoV-2.
