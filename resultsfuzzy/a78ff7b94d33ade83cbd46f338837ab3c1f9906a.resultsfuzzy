We use two metrics to measure the effectiveness of vaccination strategies in the city of Portland: the number of infections and the success rate of local containment. For the first metric, a better vaccination strategy is expected to generate a lower number of infected cases. For the second metric, we measure how well we can contain the outbreak at the source. If the number of infections outside of the containment areas identified by geo-social interaction patterns is zero, we consider the local containment successful. Otherwise we consider the local containment a failure. Fig. 3 show the containment effectiveness of three typical vaccination strategies in which the first initial infections occurring within the first level local containment scale with approximately 5,000 individuals in the city of Portland according to the two metrics: the number of infections and the success rate of local containment. Fig. 2 illustrates that an increasing number of vaccines can produce a decreasing number of infections. The random-based vaccination strategy generates the largest number of infections, followed by the degreebased and betweenness-based vaccination strategies. The latter two vaccination strategies produce the similar control efficacy in which betweenness-based ones lead to a relatively faster decreasing number of infections. The explanation of such patterns is illustrated in the Fig. 3 . Fig. 3 shows that an increasing number of vaccines can produce a decreasing number of local containment failure rates. In other words, betweenness-based vaccination strategies can contain disease outbreak at the local geo-social scales more successfully than the other two vaccination strategies. One reason is that betweenness-based vaccination strategies target high risk individuals who lie on the bridge among different communities, so they can control epidemics more effective through preventing epidemic outbreak from the local geo-social containment areas to outside areas.
