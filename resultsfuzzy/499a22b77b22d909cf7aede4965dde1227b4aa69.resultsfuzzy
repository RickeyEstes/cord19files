Test results of the response of hotel revenue measures (occupancy rate and revenue per available room) to inbound tourism development are summarized in Table 3 . The coefficient of GTA, as shown in panel A, is positive and statistically significant at the 1% level. This implies that GTA can significantly promote hotel occupancy rate, supporting the assumption that increasing inbound tourism demand can increase corporate earnings of hotel companies. The coefficient is 0.0016, indicating that a 1% increase in GTA can leads to a 0.0016% increase in hotel occupancy. The explanatory power of GTA on OPR, indicated by adjusted R 2 value, is high at 53%. The influence of GTA on Occupancy remains significant after the crisis event dummy variables are incorporated into test equation (see panel B). These results indicate that GTA is a strong explanatory factor of occupancy rate of hotel companies. Results in panel C reveal that GTA has a positive effect on RevPAR and the effect is statistically significant at the 1% level, suggesting that GTA can significantly improve hotel RevPAR. The coefficient 0.0045 suggests that 1% increase in GTA can increase RevPAR by 4.5 (0.0045 × 1000) NT dollar. The explanatory power of GTA on RevPAR is as high as 92%, indicating that GTA is a very strong explanatory factor of RevPAR. The significant influence remains when test equation includes the crisis event dummy variables (see panel D). Table 4 shows test results of the response of hotel profitability measures to inbound tourism development. The coefficients of GTA on ROA (panels A and B) and ROE (panels C and D) are both positive and statistically significant at the 1% level, with and without other control variables. In other words, expansion in inbound tourism can strongly strengthen hotel profitability. Specifically, a 1% in GTA can leads to a 0.0094% increase in ROA and a 0.0135% increase in ROE. The overall explanatory power of GTA on ROA and ROE is also high at 48% and 45%, respectively. While GTA has a positive effect on HSR, the effect is not statistically significant based on test results presented in Table 5 . The overall explanatory power of GTA on HSR is very low, i.e. the goodness-of-fit for the estimated regression equation is very poor and the independent variable GTA explains very little proportion of variation in HSR. Panel regression test results of the response of hotel performance to inbound tourism development in Tables 3-5 confirm that inbound tourism growth can significantly benefit hotel occupancy rate, revenue per available room, ROA and ROE, but have no significant influence on hotel stock performance. The findings Table 4 Test results of the response of hotel profitability measures to inbound tourism development. hence support the first hypothesis (Hypothesis I) that international tourism development should have a more direct impact on hotel sales and profitability instead of hotel stock return. Table 5 also displays test results of the impact of inbound tourist market development on risk of hotel stock returns. The coefficient of GTA, as shown in panel C, is negative, indicating that the inbound tourist market development can decrease investors' perceived riskiness of cash flows of hotel stocks and hence lower the discount rate. However, this influence is not statistically significant. The explanatory power of GTA on Risk is low at 5%. Similar results are found after the crisis event dummy variables are included into test equation (see panel D). That is, inbound tourism growth cannot significantly affect risk of hotel stock returns over the full sample period and supports Hypothesis II that inbound tourism growth is expected to have no significant impact on risk of hotel stock returns. Among three crisis events, the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US and the SARS outbreak significantly hurt hotel occupancy rate (see Table 5 Test results of the response of hotel stock return and risk to inbound tourism development. Table 3 ). The 9/21 earthquake had a significantly negative effect on occupancy rate, but the effect was not statistically significant. Results in panel D of Table 3 indicate that all three crisis events substantially harmed revenue per available room. Although the 9/21 earthquake, the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the SARS outbreak significantly hurt hotel revenue, they inflicted no strong damage on hotel profitability (see Table 4 ). All three events had an adverse impact on ROA (panel B) and ROE (panel D), the negative impact is not statistically significant. As found in the previous studies, all three events had a significantly negative influence on hotel stock returns (see panel B in Table 5 ). Tables 6-8 show test results of asymmetric response of hotel performance to inbound tourism development. The results in panel A of Table 6 demonstrate that hotel occupancy has a stronger reaction to inbound tourism expansion in contraction. Note that the coefficient b k1 (b k2 ) indicates the impact of expansion in inbound tourism market on hotel performance during business cycle expansion (contraction). Test results of asymmetric effects of tourism expansion on hotel stock performance are presented in Table 6 . The coefficient b 11 , representing the impact of expansion in inbound tourism market on HSR during business cycle expansion, is positive but is not statistically significant. On the contrary, the coefficient b 12 , representing the impact of inbound tourism growth on HSR during business cycle contraction, is 0.3693 and statistically significant at the 1% level. In other words, while tourism expansion has no substantial impact on hotel stock return during business cycle expansion, a 1% increase in tourism expansion can significantly causes a 0.3693% increase in HSR during business cycle contraction. The response of HSR to tourism expansion in contraction is about 9 times the size of the response in expansion. The difference between b 11 and b 12 is 0.3293 and statistically significant at the 1% level. The difference between regression coefficients is still statistically significant at the 5% level when the regression test equation includes dummy variables. Table 7 depicts the test results of asymmetric impact of inbound tourism development on hotel revenue measures. The coefficient b 21 is 0.0016 and statistically significant at the 1% level, implying that 1% increase in tourism expansion during business expansion leads to a 0.0016% increase in hotel occupancy rate (see panel A). The coefficient b 22 is 0.0024 and statistically significant at the 1% level, suggesting that hotel occupancy rate rises by 0.0024% in response to 1% growth in inbound tourism market during business contraction. The response of hotel occupancy to tourism expansion in contraction is 1.5 times the size of the response in expansion. However, the difference between regression coefficients, representing the response of hotel occupancy in contraction and expansion, is not statistically significant. Similar results are found when regression test equation includes dummy variables (see panel B). Test results in panel C of Table 7 also show that RevPAR has a stronger reaction to inbound tourism expansion in contraction than in expansion. Both b 31 and b 32 are positive and statistically significant at the 1% level. A 1% increase in tourism expansion during business expansion increases RevPAR by 4.2 (0.0042 × 1000) NT dollar. In contrast, RevPAR jumps by 9 (0.0090 × 1000) NT dollar in response to a similar tourism growth during business contraction, which is more than double the size of the response in expansion. The difference between regression coefficients is 0.0048, but is not statistically significant. Similar results are found after regression test equation includes dummy variables (see panel D). Table 8 summarizes test results of asymmetric effects of tourism expansion on ROA and ROE of hotel firms. As shown in panel A of Table 7 Test results of asymmetric impact of inbound tourism development on hotel revenue measures. Note: * Significance at the 10% level. ** Significance at the 5% level. *** Significance at the 1% level. Note: * Significance at the 10% level. ** Significance at the 5% level. *** Significance at the 1% level. Table 8 , both b 41 and b 42 are positive and statistically significant at the 5% level. Given that b 41 is 0.0080 and b 42 is 0.0292, 1% growth in foreign tourist arrivals increases ROA by a 0.0080% in expansion and a 0.0292% in contraction. This also reveals that ROA has a stronger reaction to tourism growth in contraction than in expansion. The response of ROA to tourism expansion in contraction is more than 3 times of the size of the response in expansion. The difference between b 41 and b 42 is 0.0212, but is not statistically significant. When dummy variables are added into regression test equation, b 41 and b 42 are positive and statistically significant at the 5% level (see panel B). However, the difference between regression coefficients is still not statistically significant. The influence of tourism expansion on ROE is similar to that of tourism expansion on ROA (panels C and D in Table 8 ). Both b 51 and b 52 are significantly positive at the 5% level. A 1% increase in tourism expansion causes a 0.0116% (0.0401) increase in ROE during business cycle expansion (contraction). ROE reacts more strongly to tourism growth in contraction than in expansion and the response of ROE to tourism expansion in contraction is more than 3 times the size of the response in expansion. The difference between b 51 and b 52 is 0.0285 and not statistically significant. Similar results are found after dummy variables are incorporated into regression test equation. Table 9 shows test results of asymmetric effects of tourism expansion on risk of hotel stock returns. The coefficient b 61 is 0.1058, but not statistically significant (see panel A), implying that expansion in inbound tourism market has no significant impact on risk of hotel stock returns during business cycle expansion. In comparison, the coefficient b 62 is −0.0486 and statistically significant at the 5% level, suggesting that risk of hotel stock returns decreases by 0.0486% in response to 1% growth in inbound tourism market during business contraction. This also illustrates that RISK has a stronger reaction to inbound tourism growth in contraction than in expansion. The difference between b 61 and b 62 is −0.1544 and statistically significant at the 10% level. When dummy variables are added into regression test equation, similar results are found (see panel B). The difference between regression coefficients becomes Table 9 Test results of asymmetric impact of inbound tourism development on risk of hotel stock returns. Note: * Significance at the 10% level. ** Significance at the 5% level. *** Significance at the 1% level. more pronounced and still statistically significant at the 10% level. Overall, the results reported in Tables 6-9 show strong evidence of a statistically significant difference between the reactions of hotel stock returns and risk of hotel stock returns to inbound tourism growth in business expansion and contraction. However, the impact of inbound tourism growth on occupancy, revenue per available room, ROA and ROE is not significantly different in business contraction and expansion. These findings support the fourth hypothesis (Hypothesis IV) that there is cyclical variation in the response of hotel stock performance to international tourism development and the impact of inbound tourism growth on hotel stock returns is stronger in business contraction than in business expansion.
