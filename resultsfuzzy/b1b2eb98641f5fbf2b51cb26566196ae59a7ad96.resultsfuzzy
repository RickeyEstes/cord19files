The results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis are also shown in Table 5 . As the odds ratio's of variables already in the model did not change substantially after inclusion of variables in subsequent steps we present the full model. The only statistically significant interaction term in the model was between self efficacy and thinking about AI. In the final model the time of the survey, a higher age, a lower level of education, a non-Dutch ethnicity, being vaccinated against influenza, a higher perceived severity, a higher perceived vulnerability, a higher self efficacy, a lower level of knowledge, more information about AI, and thinking more about AI were all associated with taking preventive measures. Self efficacy was a stronger predictor of precautionary behaviour for those who never or seldom think about AI (OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.9 -2.7), compared to those who think about AI more often (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.2 -1.9). The discriminative value of the final model, expressed as the area under the curve (AUC) with 95% confidence limits is 0.69 (0.67-0.71).
