The empirical analyses were run with EViews (version 6.1), a commonly used statistical software. Tables 4-6 summarize the Ordinary Least Square estimations of the explanatory model in different functional forms. The adjusted R-squared returned ranges from 0.35 to 0.38, which means at least 35% of the variation in the perhousehold amount of recyclables collected can be explained by the variations in the independent variables. As far as the control variables are concerned, none of the housing factors show significant impacts on the dependent variable, regardless of the functional form used. The analysis results show that socio-demographic factors such as education level, gender and household size do not hold any relevancy in determining waste recycling behaviour. MHINC is the only socio-demographic factor with significant relationships with WASTE (at the 10% level at least). This confirms the findings of Saltzman et al. (1993) , Gamba and Oskamp (1994) and Owens et al. (2000) that wealthier residents tend to be more active recyclers. As for median age of resident, a positive relationship significant at the 5% level is found with the weight of recyclables collected in both the linear and log-linear models (but not in the quadratic one). In this study, placement of waste separation facility in the housing estates serves as a proxy of recycling convenience. The estimated coefficients of the dummy variable FLOOR are positive in sign in the three estimations but they are statistically insignificant even at the 10% level. While most of the previous studies suggested that enhanced convenience could motivate people to recycle, putting waste separation facility on each domestic floor of building was found to be unable to increase the average amount of recyclables collected in the housing estates investigated in Hong Kong. Perhaps, the London study by Robinson and Read (2005) gives hints for explaining these results. Robinson and Read evidenced that people living in high-density housing opted for drop-off sites while usage of curbside service was higher in areas with a high concentration of single-family dwellings. It is thus crystal that density of living place matters. In Hong Kong, communal areas (e.g. corridors and staircases) in multi-storey residential buildings are usually confined or with limited natural ventilation. Given the high-density living environment, keeping the place clean and hygiene is vital for the health-being of residents in high-rises. Recycling bins placed in the communal areas of the upper domestic floors can become a source of contamination or a breeding place of rodents if some irresponsible recyclers dispose soft-drink cans to the bins without prior cleansing. The worry about unhygienic conditions overwhelms particularly after the painful lesson of the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. Therefore, residents did not prefer to use the waste separation facilities located closer to them in view of the potential high health costs. In the explanatory model in Eq. (2), the estimated coefficient of REWARD measures the partial effect of regular reward scheme on the amount of recyclables collected, keeping other things constant. No matter which model specification was used, the estimation results show a positive, significant (at the 1% level) coefficient for this dummy variable, suggesting that regular reward scheme is a strong motivator for domestic waste recycling. By these results, one can conclude that residents in Hong Kong are positively stimulated by the economic incentives to take pro-environmental behaviour, Notes: All coefficients were estimated with White's Heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors and covariance. * denotes the estimated coefficient of the variable to be significant at the 10% level. ** denotes the estimated coefficient of the variable to be significant at the 5% level. *** denotes the estimated coefficient of the variable to be significant at the 1% level.

Olson (1971) applies to the game of domestic waste recycling in the city. Beyond reasonable doubts, changing existing life style to a more pro-environmental one is demanding (Price and Joseph, 2000) . More importantly, when the benefits of collective environmental actions like waste recycling cannot cover the costs, no rational individuals will undertake collective action. With a view to the analysis results of this research, the Hong Kong Government should consider incorporating different economic incentives in their policies and schemes promoting domestic waste recycling. For example, government-operated collection centres can be set up and a reward scheme, in which citizens can exchange recyclables for tickets for free public services (e.g. booking of badminton court or dental check) can be formulated. Alternatively, the Government can sponsor property management companies or other non-governmental organizations to organize different reward schemes to promote recycling. As pinpointed by Schultz et al. (1995) , recyclers (or potential recyclers) were very sensitive to economic incentives. Reward strategies may only produce short-lived changes in behaviour and behaviour usually returns to baseline levels when the reward is terminated. A heavy long-term financial burden can be resulted if the Hong Kong Government continues to offer inducements directly to encourage domestic waste recycling. Therefore, in a long run, the Government is required to mobilize the resources in the private sector to offer economic incentives for promoting domestic waste recycling. Recognitions or tax concessions can be given to those private enterprises contributing to recycling promotion voluntarily. These help to foster a culture of inter-sectoral partnership in promoting pro-environmental activities in Hong Kong.
