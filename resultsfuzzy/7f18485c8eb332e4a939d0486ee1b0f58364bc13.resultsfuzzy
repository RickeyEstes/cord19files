Family history of CAD is another known risk factor and probably represents a combination of multiple risk factors. Drug-eluting stenting (DES) has been shown to have a lower restenotic rate in comparison with baremetal stenting. 11, 12 Recently, several clinical trials and registries have proven the efficacy of DES in highrisk subsets such as diabetes, small vessels or long lesions. [13] [14] [15] However, few studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of DES for premature CAD patients, who are usually associated with multiple atherosclerotic risk factors. We conducted this retrospective study and investigated the short-term results of DES in premature CAD patients with diverse and multiple risk factors. The clinical follow-up was counted up to May 2006 with a mean follow-up duration of 540 ± 168 days. Drug-eluting stent and premature CAD Eleven (42%) patients had a second angiogram in the follow-up period (200 ± 98 days after DES) and none of them had binary restenosis (Table 3) . Moreover, no patients had TLR in the clinical follow-up period. However, 2 patients (5.9% of intervened vessels) had TVR (non-target lesion) during follow-up. One was a 44-year-old man who had a patent PES site over the proximal obtuse marginal branch on follow-up angiogram but restenosis of the far-distal obtuse marginal ballooning site (beyond the stented segment). The other was a 42-year-old man, who received PES at the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). On follow-up, he had a patent LAD-proximal stented site, but a previously untreated LAD-middle lesion became significant and intervention was subsequently performed with balloon angioplasty. No patients developed stent thrombosis or recurrent acute MI in the clinical follow-up period. Regarding risk factor modification, the 14 patients who met the criteria for hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol > 200 mg/dL or LDL-C > 130 mg/dL) were all put on HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor treatment during the clinical follow-up period. Forty-two percent of the original cigarette smokers quit smoking after index percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
