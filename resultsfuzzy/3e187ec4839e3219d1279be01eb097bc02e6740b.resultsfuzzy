Severe uremia associated with an acute exacerbation of chronic renal failure (acute on chronic) or end-stage chronic renal failure may be associated with extreme clinical signs including: • Halitosis, ulceration of oral mucosa or tongue and brownish discoloration of dorsal surface and sloughing of anterior tip of tongue (due to fibinoid necrosis, arteritis and bacterial degradation of urea to ammonia). • Occasionally diarrhea, which may be hemorrhagic from uremic enterocolitis. • Terminally, seizures, stupor or coma may occur. Clinical signs relating to systemic arterial hypertension are common. Hypertension is reported in 29-61% of cats with chronic renal failure. Clinical signs which may be associated with hypertension include: • Ocular signs include sudden blindness with dilated pupils, hyphema or retinal hemorrhage, retinal edema, retinal vessel tortuosity, retinal detachment. • Systolic heart murmurs and a gallop rhythm. • Neurological signs including seizures and stupor. Small and/or irregular kidneys may be palpable, occasionally kidneys are enlarged (for example in neoplastic or cystic kidney disease). • Vaccinated cats will test positive with all current testing methods. • In unvaccinated cats, FIV antibodies are associated with lifelong viral infection. A positive test implies a persistently infected cat. • Passive transfer of antibody via milk will result in a positive test in kittens nursed by an infected queen. Such kittens should not be tested until at least 6 months of age. • False-positive results occur with ELISA or RIM tests, but at a low frequency. A positive test should be confirmed using a western blot if it will influence management of the cat. Interpretation of a negative antibody result: • The cat is not infected with FIV. • The cat is infected but no antibodies are present. -This occurs in early stages of infection, usually 2-4 weeks after infection. -Small numbers of cats (up to 10-20%) have delayed seroconversion or may never seroconvert. -The cat is in the terminal stages of the disease, when antibody production declines. Symptomatic therapy for fever includes: • Oxygen. • Crystalloid fluid therapy. • Antipyretic drugs (NSAIDs) -these act directly on the thermoregulatory center and should be tried before surface cooling, unless the fever is lifethreatening, when they may be instituted together. • Surface cooling. Core temperature will continue to decrease after surface cooling has ceased, so to avoid large oscillations in temperature, aggressive cooling should stop just prior to reaching the desired temperature. -With cool, not cold, water (avoid inducing shivering). -Fans. -Ice packs over large blood vessels.
