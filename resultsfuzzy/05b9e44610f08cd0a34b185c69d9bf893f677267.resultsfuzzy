In this study, we compared the properties of sera obtained a rabbit that was immunized with bacterially expressed GST-3a (134-274 aa) (i.e. C-terminal, Rabbit #1, Ref. [4] ), and two rabbits that were immunized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to 15-28 aa of 3a (i.e. N-terminal, Rabbit #2 and Rabbit #3). This peptide corresponds to aa 15-28 of the SARS-CoV 3a protein ectodomain which is predicted to face the extracellular matrix in infected cells [4] . Western blot analysis was performed to determine the specificity of the rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Total cell lysates obtained from Vero E6 cells transiently transfected with a DNA construct for expressing full-length 3a or SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells were used in Western blot analysis with sera collected from the immunized rabbits after different number of immunizations with the peptide. As shown in Fig. 1A , the sera from 1st to 5th bleeds of one of the immunized rabbits (Rabbit #2) could react specifically with the full-length 3a protein of $35 kDa. Similar results were obtained with the other immunized rabbit (Rabbit #3, Fig. 1B ), but the relative reactivity to 3a is lower than for Rabbit #2. Hence, subsequent experiments were performed with the sera from Rabbit #2. Western blot analysis of SARS-CoV infected cells also demonstrated that the anti-3a N-terminal antibody (Rabbit #2, 5th bleed) could react specifically with the 3a protein expressed in infected cells (Fig. 1C, lane 2) . For comparison, the anti-3a Cterminal antibody (Rabbit #1, 6th bleed) also detected 3a in infected cells (Fig. 1C, lane 4) . Consistent with previous studies [10, 11] , the N-terminal of 3a is sufficient to stimulate specificity antibody response in rabbits. The anti-3a N-terminal antibody (Rabbit #2, 5th bleed) was used in indirect immunofluorescence experiments and it could detect the 3a protein expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 1D, left panel) and intracellularly (Fig. 1D, right panel) . It was previously showed that properly folded 3a protein is efficiently transported to the cell surface with its N-terminal facing the extracellular matrix [4, 21] ; hence, the results showed that the anti-3a N-terminal antibody could recognize the native form of 3a expressed on the cell surface. Next, the rabbit polyclonal antibodies were tested for their abilities to inhibit SARS-CoV propagation in Vero E6 culture. Microneutralization assays were performed by mixing a constant amount of virus with different dilutions of rabbit sera and then overlaying the mixture onto Vero E6 cells in 96-well plates. Calculations were made from the cytopathic effect induced in cell culture by the virus as described previously [20] . As shown in Table 2 , the sera obtained from the rabbit immunized with the N-terminal of 3a (Rabbit #2) showed a neutralization titer of 1:67 for the 1st bleed and 1:80 for the 2nd to 5th bleeds, while the pre-immune serum did not have any neutralizing activity (titer <1:10). In contrast, the anti-3a C-terminal antibody did not show any neutralizing activity (Rabbit #1, 6th bleed, titer <1:10), neither did the pre-immune serum from this rabbit. All experiments were performed three times and the average values are showed in Table 2 . The neutralizing activities of the rabbit sera from Rabbit #2 were observed even though the components of the complement system have been inactivated by heating. In order to determine if this result is reproducible, the sera from another rabbit immunized with the same 3a N-terminal peptide (Rabbit #3, Fig. 1B) were used for neu- tralizing assays. Indeed, the results showed that the sera from Rabbit #3 were also neutralizing, albeit with a lower titer of 1:40 (average value obtained for all the bleeds). For comparison, parallel experiments were also performed with a neutralizing antibody targeting 1055-1192 aa (SD10), which contains the heptad repeat 2 domain known to be important for mediating membrane fusion, of SARS-CoV S protein [17] . In this experiment, the rabbit anti-SD10 polyclonal antibody had a neutralizing titer of 1:160, which is consistent with our previous findings [17] . To be certain that the inability of the anti-3a C-terminal antibody to neutralize the SARS-CoV is not due to lower antibody concentrations, we determined the relative binding affinities of the anti-3a N-terminal and C-terminal rabbit polyclonal antibodies to 3a protein expressed in 293T cells by ELISA. Diluted rabbit sera were added to wells coated with total cell lysates from untransfected cells or cells transiently transfected with a DNA construct for expressing the fulllength 3a protein. The OD difference (in arbitrary units) represented the specific binding of antibody to the 3a protein. As shown in Fig. 2 , the serum from Rabbit #1 (i.e. C-terminal, 6th bleed) has relatively stronger binding affinity to the 3a protein than the sera from different bleeds of Rabbit #2 (i.e. N-terminal). The pre-immune sera from both rabbits showed little binding to 3a. Hence, it is clear that the anti-3a C-terminal antibody did not have any neutralizing activity, even though it contains a relatively higher level of 3a-specific antibodies than the anti-3a N-terminal antibody. Interestingly, B cells recognizing the N-terminal ectodomain of the 3a protein were found in two separate cohorts Fig. 1 . Detection of SARS-CoV 3a protein expressed in Vero E6 cells with rabbit anti-3a polyclonal antibodies. (A) Rabbit #2 and (B) Rabbit #3: Western blot analysis was performed using sera obtained from two rabbits that were immunized with a synthetic peptide which corresponds to amino acids 15-28 of the 3a protein (i.e. N-terminal). All sera were diluted 1:2000 and the lysates were obtained from Vero E6 cells transiently transfected with a DNA construct for expressing full-length 3a (+) or untransfected cells (Ã€). (C) Vero E6 cells were infected with an MOI of 1 and then prepared for Western blot analysis. Pre-immune serum from the rabbit (Rabbit #2) that was immunized with the 3a N-terminal peptide showed no reactivity (lane 1), while the 5th bleed from the same rabbit after immunization detected the 3a protein in infected cells (lane 2). Similarly, pre-immune serum from the rabbit (Rabbit #1) that was immunized with the 3a C-terminal bacterially expressed protein showed no reactivity (lane 3), while the 6th bleed from the same rabbit after immunization detected the 3a protein in infected cells (lane 4). (D) Cellular localization of 3a in transfected Vero E6 cells as determined by indirect immunofluorescence. Serum from the 5th bleed of the rabbit (Rabbit #2) that was immunized with the 3a N-terminal peptide was used at a dilution of 1:200 to detect for the 3a protein expressed on the cell surface (left panel, no permeabilization) and intracellularly (right panel, permeabilization with 0.2% Triton-X 100). Table 2 Neutralizing titers for the pre-immune sera and the different bleeds obtained from rabbits that have been immunized with either the N-or C-terminal of the SARS-CoV 3a protein of SARS patients [14, 15] . In another study, it was reported 48.8% of patients who recovered from SARS had antibodies against the N terminal of 3a while only 7.4% of the diseased patients has such antibodies [11] . It was further demonstrated that anti-3a antibodies in the patient serum could bind cells expressing 3a and induce the elimination of these cells in the presence of the human complement system [11] . Several other studies also found that anti-3a antibodies were presented only in a subset of SARS patients [4, 9, 10, 22] . In this study, we showed that rabbit polyclonal antibody targeting a 14 aa epitope (aa [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] in the N-terminal ectodomain of 3a could neutralize the SARS-CoV replication in Vero E6 cells in the absence of the complement system. On the other hand, serum obtained from a rabbit immunized with the Cterminal cytoplasmic domain of 3a (aa 134-274) was not capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV even though it contains a higher amount of 3a-specific antibodies. Hence, it is clear that both the ectodomain and cytoplasmic domain of 3a are immunogenic but only the ectodomain stimulates neutralizing antibodies. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a SARS-CoV group-specific protein that can induce neutralizing antibody. Our results showed that antibody targeting the N-terminal of 3a can inhibit SARS-CoV replication, suggesting that 3a can stimulate protective humoral responses during SARS infection. This finding is consistent with a recent report that a higher percentage of patients who recovered from SARS infection have antibodies against the N-terminal of 3a, when compared to the patients who died from SARS infection [11] . Even though the 3a protein is not essential for SARS-CoV replication in cell culture and the murine model [23] , it is very likely that 3a contributes to viral replication or pathogenesis in the natural host(s). In future studies, it will be crucial to determine the role of 3a during SARS-CoV infection in non-human primate models, where the animals could develop a disease comparable to that in SARS patients [24] . The precise role of aa was immunized with bacterially expressed GST-3a (134-274 aa) (i.e. C-terminal) and the pre-immune serum and the serum from the 6th bleed were tested. Rabbit #2 was immunized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 15-28 of 3a (i.e. N-terminal). For Rabbit #2, the preimmune serum and the sera from the 1st to 5th bleeds were tested. All experiments were performed in duplicates and the average values with standard deviations are plotted. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] in the N-terminal ectodomain of the 3a protein during SARS-CoV infection also remains to be elucidated.
