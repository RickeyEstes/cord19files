For all seven crime rate series in Figs. 1 and 2, we adopt the basic structural time series model as defined in Eq. (1) with the trend component as a random walk with fixed drift, together with a step intervention variable in January 1995. For the burglary and larceny series we also controlled for an outlier with a pulse intervention variable (see Fig. 3 (a) ) in December 1989. The estimation results are presented in Table 1 , while the smooth estimated trend and seasonal components are displayed in Figs. 6 and 7 for the property and violent crimes, respectively. The estimated regression coefficients of the step intervention variable for January 1995 are negative for burglary, larceny, murder, and rape. However, a statistically significant effect of the new legislation is only found for burglary and murder. The values of the regression coefficients of the step intervention variable for January 1995 are positive for motor vehicle theft, robbery, and aggravated assault, but these are not significantly different from zero. From these analyses we conclude that the new legislation only resulted in a drop for the burglary and murder offences, but not for the other crime categories. The results of the univariate structural time series analysis with a step intervention variable (see Fig. 3 (b) ) indicate a deterrent impact of the new legislation for burglary and murder. This evidence is based on the intervention variable B t for which the impact starts in January 1995. In order to investigate the robustness of this result and whether the impact was instantaneous or more gradual, we repeat the empirical analyses of the previous section on the basis of a smooth break intervention S t instead of a step intervention B t . Our smooth break intervention S t is shown in Fig. 3 (c) ; we let the break start in January 1995 and we let it end in different years. Table 2 contains the absolute values of the t-statistics of the estimated intervention effects based on B t and S t (for different lengths of the gradual break). The results provide some evidence that a gradual break (S t ) has been more likely than an abrupt break (B t ) in 1995. In particular, the gradual break that ends in 2000 shows a significant effect for larceny and murder. The estimated regression coefficients associated with this gradual break S t are found to be negative for all crime series. The more gradual breaks also lead to less precise interpretations of the break. A smooth break affects the overall trend in the period 1995-2000 and therefore cannot be exclusively associated with an event in, say, January 1995. However, in our empirical study the longer prison sentences imposed under the 1994 sentencing reform are likely to have had gradual effect on Virginia's prison population. For example, when we consider the inmates confined for offences committed in early 1996, about 25% of this new inmate population admitted to the prison came in under the old parole system, before 1995, while at the end of 2000 this number was about 1%. This provides some justification that the gradual intervention S t should also be considered in our intervention analysis. In our bivariate analyses we consider burglary and murder as 'eligible' crimes. The new legislation also targeted robbery and rape offences, hence we consider these crimes to be 'eligible' as well. Larceny, motor vehicle theft, and aggravated assaults are considered as 'non-eligible' crimes. We analyse sets of two time series simultaneously using the bivariate structural time series model as discussed in Section 3 with one variable treated as a treatment group (burglary, robbery, murder, rape) and one variable treated as a control group (larceny, motor vehicle theft, aggravated assaults). We have twelve combinations of two variables and therefore present the estimation results for twelve bivariate models. In our analysis we consider the BSM with a deterministic slope for the trend component and with intervention effects; the sample size is 324; for intervention effects, we report the t-statistic between round brackets; for the variances, we report the q-ratio in square brackets (it is the ratio of the component variance against the irregular variance); MVT = motor vehicle theft; AA = aggravated assault. The bivariate structural time series model for crime series is also used to assess the effect of parole abolition and of reformed sentencing in Virginia. Since more data is used and since we explicitly model eligible (or treatment) and non-eligible (or control) crime series jointly, we expect an increase of the statistical significance of the intervention from a bivariate analysis in comparison to a univariate analysis. If the treatment variable is affected by the new legislation while the control variable is not, we expect to obtain a strong significant effect of the intervention from our estimation procedure. The economic interpretation for having treatment and control crime groups can be given as follows. Observed changes in crime around the time of the introduction of the new legislation "may reflect a combination of the true deterrent impact of harsher repeatoffender enhancements and of other factors correlated with but not caused by the law change, such as changes in demographics, in other state policies, and in broad social norms against crime," see Kessler and Levitt (1999) . The estimation results for burglary as a treatment series and three different control series are presented in Table 3 . The analogous specifications for robbery, murder, and rape as "treatment" series are presented in Tables 4, 5, and 6, respectively. We find significant negative effects in two out of three of the bivariate structural time series specifications for burglary, with motor vehicle theft and aggravated assault as control groups. The estimated regression coefficient ranges from −3.99 to −5.19, which is in the neighbourhood of the univariate estimate of −3.98. The estimated bivariate models for burglary satisfy all of the diagnostic requirements of residual independence, homoscedasticity, and normality. Inspection of the Akaike information criterion indicates that the fit of the bivariate models (all around 2.02) is about as good as the fit of the univariate model (2.03). A similar picture is obtained for the bivariate structural time series analyses of the murder series, see Table 5 . Negative significant effects of the new legislation are found in all three bivariate structural time series models with control groups. When motor vehicle theft and aggravated assault are treated as non-eligible crimes, the estimated effect of the new legislation on murder is −0.10, which is almost identical to the univariate result of −0.09, see Table 1 . The bivariate model residuals for murder also satisfy all of the model assumptions, while the fit of the bivariate models is similar to that of the univariate model (with AIC value −4.45). When we treat robbery as a treatment series, we do not find significant results in any of the three bivariate model specifications, Note: We report t-tests (absolute values) for the step Bt and smooth break St interventions. The break for Bt takes place in January 1995. The start of the smooth break St is t 1 and corresponds with January 1995 while t 2 is the end of the gradual break and is January in the year indicated by the column headings. Note: Sample size is 324; t-statistic in round brackets; q-ratio (ratio of the estimated standard deviations of the state disturbances and estimated standard deviation of the irregular) in square brackets; BSM model fitted to all specifications; MVT = motor vehicle theft; AA = aggravated assault. see Table 4 . This finding suggests that although the new legislation targeted robbery as a most violent property crime, we do not find any confirmation that the behaviour of this series has been significantly altered by the new legislation. When we consider the bivariate results in Table 6 , where rape is handled as a treatment series, we find a significant negative effect for rape when it is modelled together with aggravated assault as a control group. The estimated effect is −0.24, which is larger in absolute value than the univariate estimate of −0.12. The AIC values of −2.84 for rape in the bivariate model and of −2.82 in the univariate model again indicate that these two models fit the rape crime series about equally well. In summary, the multivariate estimation results confirm that new legislation significantly affected burglary (−3.99 to −5.19) and murder (−0.10). As far as rape is concerned, we find a significant drop of −0.24 in one of the three bivariate model specifications, which is a larger effect than the (insignificant) univariate estimation result of −0.15. We have also considered the simultaneous treatment of all seven crime series in a unified model but this multivariate analysis has not led to an improvement of the univariate or bivariate specifications presented above. Also, we have not found a common trend in the seven crime variables. Our study has aimed to capture the statistical effects of policy interventions with a known date. It is also possible within a structural time series analysis to develop a statistical procedure for determining the number of interventions and the locations of these. Hence we do not need to set a-priori the dates of the interventions but 11 We have carried out four different unit root tests: a standard augmented Dickey-Fuller(ADF) unit root test, plus three tests which allow for structural breaks (those of Zivot and Andrews (1992) , Lumsdaine and Papell (1997) , and Lee and Strazicich (2003) ). All four tests consistently point to the rejection of the null hypothesis of a unit root; the results are available upon request. Hence stochastic trends are not present in our time series. These results are consistent with the presented results from our structural time series analysis; the estimated variances of the level components are equal to relatively small values which imply that the level components are close to a constant and do not behave as stochastic trends. they can be treated as unknown. Such a procedure is implemented in the STAMP package of Koopman et al. (2010) . It is based on a first analysis where a sequential inclusion of outlier and level break dummies in the model, over each time point t, is considered and the dummy parameters are estimated. All significant dummies (or those close to significance) are recorded. In a second analysis, all recorded dummies are included in the model and all parameters are estimated simultaneously. Then a general-to-specific estimation and testing methodology is adopted to determine the final model specification. In the structural time series analysis adopted in STAMP, each estimation round is based on a model where the trend and seasonal unobserved components are included such that it always accounts for the possible non-stationary dynamic features in the time series. The methodology is different from cointegration and Perron (1998,2003) analyses. In STAMP, the computations rely on the Kalman filter and the analytical methods developed by Harvey and Koopman (1992) . To assess the robustness of our empirical results presented in Section 4, we have carried out the outlier and level break detection procedures of STAMP. We present these additional results for the key time series of burglary 12 and adopt the univariate structural time series model from Table 1. In the first step, we introduce outlier and level break interventions at each consecutive time point and record the resulting t-statistic for the related dummy variables. In Fig. 8 we present the t-statistics for the level break interventions in a time series index plot. We find that significant level breaks are detected in the series while the break for the reformed sentencing change from 1995 is not outstanding. In the next step we consider the univariate model that includes all significant outlier and level breaks from the first step (the level break intervention variables are for March 1984 , November 1987 , and October 1990 plus our parole policy intervention for January 1995. The resulting t-statistic for the policy change has now risen from −1.95 in Table 1 to −2.51 for this extended model. Hence the evidence of a significant change due to the parole abolition and reformed sentencing in Virginia has become stronger. However, this result is not found for all other six crime series, in In our analysis we consider the BSM with a deterministic slope for the trend component and with intervention effects; the sample sizes are 324 (monthly) and 108 (quarterly); MVT = motor vehicle theft; AA = aggravated assault; abs.diff = absolute difference between monthly and quarterly estimates; the asterisk* indicates statistical significance. most cases the additional analysis has not changed our conclusions as presented in this study. To investigate whether our analysis is robust to analyses of different sample time frequencies, we have re-considered the monthly univariate structural time series analysis with the results reported in Table 1 . Instead of analysing the monthly time series, we have aggregated all underlying time series of crime rates into quarterly time series and re-estimated the parameters of the same underlying model but now based on the quarterly time series. We expect the estimates, and in particular the estimated structural, or step, break for the first month/quarter of 1995, to have the same corresponding values and significance levels. The estimated step break coefficients for month and quarter sample frequencies are presented in Table 7 . The reported results indicate that the estimates of the step break dummy for the first month/quarter in 1995 are robust to the different monthly and quarterly sample frequencies. For all crime series, the differences between the two estimates (month/quarter) are statistically not different from zero, except for the larceny crime series. The monthly and quarterly analyses are based on the same models, but in case of the larceny series, the behaviour of the trend component is somewhat different (more variation in the quarterly case) and this affects the estimate of the step break dummy. Finally, apart from the burglary time series, the 1995 break estimates in the quarterly case are also significant for the motor vehicle theft and murder series.
