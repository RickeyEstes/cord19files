After sequence filtering a final international dataset was obtained, including 807 partial S1 sequences of strains collected from 18 countries between 1993 and 2015 (S1 Table) . TempEst analysis demonstrated the presence of a significant temporal structure, being the correlation between genetic distances and sampling dates equal to 0,57 (R 2 = 0,33; slope 2,96Á10 −3 ). Additionally, the Xia test, performed for each codon position, demonstrated the absence of substitution saturation. The obtained dataset was thus considered suited for further analysis. The Italian dataset, after filtering and removal of recently imported strain, included 454 sequences for which collection region and date were available. Strains were sampled from 16 regions between 2005 and 2015 (S2 Table) . Intentional dataset. BEAST analysis performed on the 10 randomly generated datasets showed concordant results in terms of MRCA, substitution rate (Fig 1) and viral population history (Fig 2) . Mean MRCA and substitution rate over the 10 run were 1977,86 [95HPD:1965,54-1986,64] and 2,71Á10 −3 [95HPD:2,22Á10 −3 -3,26Á10 −3 ], respectively. The population dynamics analysis revealed that after the MRCA the viral population increased until about 1993. Thereafter, the relative genetic diversity fluctuated over time, with Phylodynamic reconstruction of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) QX genotype history at least four distinct peaks that followed one another until the end of the considered time period, when a more significant decrease was observed. The migration rate analysis revealed different well supported spreading path (Fig 3) . Remarkably, the same routes were identified as significant using the ten randomly built datasets with the only exception of Germany to Sweden and South Africa to China connections that were identified only in run 4 (S1 Fig). Considering the robustness and the consistency of the obtained estimates, only the results of run 2, which showed the higher ESS and the best mixing, will be described for graphical and interpretability reasons. It is possible to recognize two nuclei of global spread: China and Europe. The former represented the original epidemic source and contributed to the spread to Europe, other Asian countries and Middle East. After introduction in Europe, most likely in Germany, the virus widely circulated in this area, as evidenced by the higher migration rate among the UE countries compared to other ones (Fig 3) . Countries of the central Europe played a relevant role in the dissemination to Eastern Europe ones while Mediterranean countries seemed to contribute to the GI-19 lineage spread to Northern Africa (Egypt) and Turkey. A more detailed picture of the GI-19 history was obtained by plotting the MCC tree in time and space. After its origin in China in the late '70, the GI-19 lineage circulated within the Phylodynamic reconstruction of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) QX genotype history country until the late '90 when it migrated to Europe (Germany;~2002) and Thailand (~2005). After European first introduction, it rapidly spread to all main countries during the first half of the decade: Poland and Italy (~2003) and the Netherlands and France (~2004). Then, Spain (~2006), Sweden and United Kingdom (~2007), Ukraine (~2009) and Hungary (~2010) were involved. In the following years, Europe contributed to the disease spreading to other countries; France to South Africa (~2010), Italy to Turkey (~2011) and Spain to Egypt (~2015). In the meanwhile, strains from China invaded South Korea (~2008) and Iran (~2011) from where they spread to Iraq (~2013) (S1 Video). Italian dataset. Also for this country, BEAST analysis performed on the 10 randomly generated datasets showed concordant results in terms of MRCA, substitution rate (Fig 4) and viral population history (Fig 5) . Mean MRCA and substitution rate over the 10 run were 2003,57 [95HPD:2000,82-2005,08] and 3,22Á10 −3 [95HPD:2,33Á10 −3 -4,31Á10 −3 ], respectively. The population dynamics estimation showed a pattern comparable with the international databases ones. After QX genotype introduction, a rapid initial raise in the median genetic relative diversity was replaced by consecutive waves that endured until the final decrease, observed at the end of the considered time period. The Italian QX spreading patterns revealed a remarkably complex picture. The Emilia-Romagna was identified as the major source of viral spreading toward both Northern and Southern Italian regions (Fig 6) . However, other regions contributed to the viral spreading. More specifically, after the introduction in Emilia-Romagna in 2003 (concordantly with the international dataset estimations), QX radiated to other regions of Northern and Southern Phylodynamic reconstruction of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) QX genotype history Italy following an intricate and hardly predictable pattern. Even if not always significant from a statistical perspective, the migration fluxes among regions were often bidirectional and characterized by multiple introduction events, with regions exporting and importing different strains from different areas. Particularly in the southward diffusion process, the long distance spreading was mediated/facilitated by the passage in intermediate regions (S2 Fig and  S2 Video) . Similarly to the International scenario, the high densely populated region of Northern Italy showed the highest migration rates (Fig 6) .
