The questionnaire was completed by participants from 23 states (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden and Turkey). All states have laws addressing the prevention and control of communicable diseases. In nine states there are also emergency powers provided in legislation that include a pandemic in the definition of an emergency, whilst fourteen states will limit interventions in a pandemic to those provided for by public health laws. Six of the Schengen states' plans consider a pandemic to constitute a serious threat to public policy or internal security to justify reintroduction of internal border controls. The Schengen Treaties (1985) on free traffic of persons, since 1997 incorporated into EU Law, are applicable in 26 countries, including the non-EU countries Norway, Iceland and Switzerland, but excluding the UK, Ireland, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Romania. Ten states have laws that would authorise border closure in a pandemic. Table 2 provides some examples of the range of measures provided across those states for which we have completed questionnaire results: The organizational structure of governments differs across European states as a consequence of cultural factors and differences in legal system. Seven state rapporteurs in the project responded that their state operated on the basis of a federal or quasi-federal system: Austria, Belgium, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. See Table 3 . In follow up research, the national pandemic plans of the five federal or quasi federal states where plans were available in English were analyzed, examining the distribution of pandemic planning roles and responsibilities between national and regional governments. See Table 4 .
