B. bronchiseptica isolate KM22 was originally isolated from a pig, and this isolate, along with KM22-derived mutants, have been used in many infection studies in its natural swine host to characterize the associated disease phenotypes. The phenotypes of some KM22-derived mutants used in these studies did not always concur with reciprocal studies using the well characterized rabbit RB50 isolate, along with RB50-derived mutants, in rodent infection models Nicholson et al., 2012) . To determine genomic differences that could account for such virulence-associated phenotypic differences, we compared the genomes from KM22 and RB50, as well genomes from five additional B. bronchiseptica strains (1289 isolated from a monkey, 253 from a dog, and MO149, Bbr77, and D445 from humans).
