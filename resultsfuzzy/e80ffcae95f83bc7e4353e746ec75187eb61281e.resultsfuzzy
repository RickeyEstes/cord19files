The forecasting performance of the hybrid ARIMA-SVMs and benchmarking method on the four airlines' air passenger series covered a period from January 1990 to December 2001 are shown in Table 2 . For each accuracy measure and prediction horizon, the strategies are rank order from 1 (the best) to 6 (the worst) in Table 2 . (i) As far as the comparison between ARIMA-SVMs with others benchmark methods is concerned, the results are mixing among the prediction measures examined. In terms of MAPE and the data without deseasonalization-detrending, I-ARIMA-SVM gets the best performance when horizon = 1, and D-SVM gets the best performance when horizon = 4, 8, 12 and in the average accuracy measures over the prediction horizon 1 to 24, while D-ARIMA-SVM gets the performance when horizon = 2, 6, 18, 24. (ii) It is obvious that applying deseasonalization and detrending approach for multistep-ahead prediction obtains better performances. Following the experimental procedure presented in Figure 3 , an ANOVA procedure is performed to determine The Scientific World Journal 9
