Cattle performance and supplement intake data are presented in Table 1 . By design, cow age and initial BW were not different between treatments (P ≥ 0.69). Both ending cow BW and gain were similar for SUPP and CON cows (P ≥ 0.19). Calf age at the onset of the experiment, initial BW, and ADG were not different (P ≥ 0.18) between SUPP and CON pairs. There was a 15-kg increase in ending BW for SUPP calves compared with CON that was not significant (P = 0.08); much of this difference was due to differences in initial BW. Although no attempt was made to measure the amount of supplement consumed by the calves, calves were observed at the bunk with their dams and appeared to be eating supplement daily. With no significant differences in cow or calf performance between treatments, the SUPP treatment appears to be a viable option when land resources are limited. The results observed in the current experiment generally concur with that reported by other investigators. Cows double stocked and supplemented with a 30:70 ratio (DM) of wet distillers grains plus solubles (WDGS) and wheat straw tended to have greater ADG compared with those grazing at a recommended stocking rate in similar work on upland native Sandhills range (Nuttelman et al., 2010) . Interestingly, calf performance was not affected by supplementation. In a different experiment by the same authors, both cow and calf ADG were improved by feeding a 45:55 ratio of WDGS and grass hay to double stocked pairs. The researchers attributed the improvement in calf ADG to increased milk production by the dam due to intake of a high quality feed, direct consumption of the supplement by the calves, or a combination of both factors (Nuttelman et al., 2010) . Also in agreement, nonpregnant, nonlactating cows grazing smooth bromegrass had numerically greater ADG when double stocked and supplemented with a 35:65 blend of Golden Synergy (40% wet corn gluten feed and 60% MDGS; Archer Daniels Midland Company, Columbus, NE) and wheat straw (Doerr et al., 2012) . Likewise, ADG of yearling steers grazing upland native Sandhills range at twice the recommended stocking rate was improved by supplementing a mixture of 60% forage (wheat straw or grass hay) and 40% WDGS (DM basis; Villasanti et al., 2011) . The supplementation rate in the current experiment was designed to replace grazed forage intake rather than improve performance. The small numerical increase in performance by SUPP pairs is logical, given the supplement would contain more energy than the grass it replaced. Data from Watson et al. (2012) indicated IVDMD of smooth bromegrass diet samples decreased from almost 69% in May to 51% in September, averaging approximately 59%. This is slightly lower than the 63% TDN content of the supplement in the current experiment. In addition to greater TDN content, the supplement had greater RUP content compared with the grass it replaced. Buckner et al. (2013) reported that brome diet samples contained only 0.92% digestible RUP as a percentage of DM. The supplement contained approximately 5.8% digestible RUP. Therefore, the supplemented pairs consumed about 3 times more RUP than the control cattle, 522 g/d compared with 171 g/d, respectively. The metabolizable protein needs of the lactating cow and the young growing calf are high, and the RUP from the supplement helps to meet these requirements. Across all 3 yr, average total pair BW was 722 and 737 kg for CON and SUPP pairs, respectively. Based on these BW and data from Meyer et al. (2012) , total estimated DMI was calculated to be 18.6 and 19.1 kg/pair daily for CON and SUPP, respectively. For SUPP pairs, supplement intake averaged 7.1 kg of DM/d throughout the season. By difference, grazed forage intake was calculated as 12.0 kg/d. This suggests the supplement reduced grazed forage intake by 35%, and 0.93 kg of grazed forage was replaced by every 1 kg of supplement fed. It was assumed that stocking rate changes between the SUPP and CON treatments did not affect intake, although this was not directly measured. Similar research conducted in the Sandhills (Nuttelman et al., 2010) with cow-calf pairs demonstrated grazed forage replacement values of approximately 40 to 50% when a 30:70 ratio (DM basis) of WDGS and wheat straw was fed. Daily forage disappearance per cowcalf pair was not influenced by supplementation of a 45:55 ratio of WDGS and grass hay in other work by Nuttelman et al. (2010) . Doerr et al. (2012) noted that a blend of 35% by-product and 65% wheat straw (DM) decreased smooth brome intake by 48%. Range forage intake of double stocked yearling steers was reduced 44 to 54% by feeding a low-quality forage and WDGS (Villasanti et al., 2011) . However, supplement characteristics appear to be important in determining substitution effects on forage intake. Grazed forage intake was not reduced when yearling steers were supplemented only dried distillers grains plus solubles in studies by Gustad et al. (2008) and Stalker et al. (2012) . Although previous work (MacDonald et al., 2007; Griffin et al., 2012) has suggested a substitution effect on forage intake when distillers grains are fed in forage-based diets, reductions in forage intake have not been great enough to allow for a 2-fold increase in stocking rate . This indicates using fibrous low-quality forages in the supplement is essential to reducing voluntary grazed forage DMI and achieving significant forage replacement rates. This concurs with the well-established concept that intake of forage-fed cattle is regulated by rumen fill and digesta passage (NASEM, 2016). Table 2 reports rainfall and forage production in pastures adjacent to the pastures used in the current experiment. Production in 2012 was lower than 2011 and 2013 because of limited rainfall. Based on the estimated forage intakes, harvest efficiency in the control pastures ranged from 28.7 to 49.2% across years. Calculated harvest efficiency was numerically greater in the SUPP pastures, ranging from 36.2 to 64.3%. Visual observation suggested that the pairs used the SUPP pastures to a greater degree early in the grazing season and depended more on the supplemental feed later in the season. This greater utilization early in the season maintained the brome in a more vegetative state throughout the grazing season. Because the grazing pattern was different and harvest efficiency was greater with the SUPP treatment, subsequent forage production was of interest. Forage production was measured the year following this experiment to determine the effects of 5 yr of the CON and SUPP treatments being applied to these pastures. Forage production measured on July 10, 2014, was 9,312 kg/ ha for the CON pasture and 10,558 kg/ha for the SUPP pasture. We conclude that the grazing pattern and higher harvest efficiency in the SUPP treatment actually had a positive effect on the pastures. A partial explanation for increased forage production in the SUPP pastures might be added N from the supplement. The supplemented feed contained 2% N and supplied 18.5 kg of N/pair during the grazing season. At 19% protein in the gain (NASEM, 2016) , the calves removed about 4.3 kg of N and the cows would have removed about 0.10 kg of N/yr. Assuming one half the gain came from the supplemental feed, then about 2.2 kg of N was removed by a pair. The net excretion would be 16.3 kg of N/pair or 23 kg of N/ha. This may explain the greater forage production in 2014 because of carryover of N deposited by the pairs during the previous 3 yr. It also suggests that forage production in the SUPP treatment pastures during this experiment may have been greater than that in the control pastures.
