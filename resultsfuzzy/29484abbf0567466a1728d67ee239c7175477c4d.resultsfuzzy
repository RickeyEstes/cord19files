In this section, we verify our model by simulation and present the results. Initially, we randomly choose 1% and 5% of all individuals to be infected and vaccinated. Without specific statement, we use the number of final recovered nodes, R∞, to denote the epidemic size. The larger R∞ is, the severer the disease is. Besides, ρ S , ρ I , ρ R , ρ V are set to describe the fractions of susceptible, infected, recovered and vaccinated nodes, respectively. The simulation will be ended when no infected individuals exist in the network, and each data is obtained by averaging over 50 independent runs. We first apply the model in square lattices network [33] with. But when θ o > 0.9 (region III), the epidemic size hardly changes. After breaking plenty of connections with the infected, SI links are sparse and infected individuals are relatively isolated, which cut off the disease spreading path. Thus the impact of the SI link removal process on lowering epidemic size gradually diminishes. Some previous literatures [15, 27] mainly concluded that rewiring strategy can suppress the disease completely. However, different from these studies, our results exhibit that the rewiring strategy cannot always control the epidemic based on the above description. At the same time, there exist two critical points for θ o (one is about θ 1 o = 0.65 and the other is about θ 2 o = 0.9), which can be treated as an important index for effective link removal. According to these critical points, Fig. 3 can be divided into two types of regions. In regions I and III, the epidemic size hardly changes as θ o increases and these regions are defined as ''ineffective region'' for controlling epidemic spreading. The region II, which can effectively lower the epidemic size, is called ''effective region''. Furthermore, to better understand the impact of rewiring strategy on the epidemic spreading, we consider node and link dynamics of four kinds of link-breaking thresholds in lattice network with uniform weight distribution. From θ o = 0.3 ( Fig. 4(a) ) to θ o = 0.8 (Fig. 4(c) ), the time that the density of recovered nodes (ρ R , green upper triangle symbols) tends to be stable gradually shifts (from A to C, where A corresponds to the time 350, C corresponds to the time 1200). That suggests that the disease spreads out more and more difficultly. Whereas when θ o = 0.95, the epidemic cannot outbreak. Besides, the proportion of RR links (red slash area) goes up with time, which demonstrates that R nodes are more inclined to be clustered. The cluster of R nodes also helps to control the disease propagation to some extent. In Fig. 4(d) , since plenty of large weight links are removed, the disease cannot spread out and the infection (ρ R ) keeps in the low level. With respect to link strength, disparate types of links play disparate roles in epidemic spreading [34] . To further explain the above results, it is imperative to investigate the epidemic spreading when breaking the same number of SI links with different weight. E [ω 1 ,ω 2 ] is defined as the set of SI links with weight in the interval ∼[ω 1 ω 2 ]. Here we take lattice network with uniform distribution (U(0, 2)) as an example. In this type of weighted network, different weighted links are distributed uniformly in the network. The number of links in E [ω 1 ,ω 2 ] is approximately equal to that of E [ω 3 ,ω 4 ] (where ω 2 − ω 1 = ω 4 −ω 3 ). Fig. 5 shows the change of the density of recovered nodes (ρ R ) with time when SI links in E [ω 1 ,ω 2 ] are removed. In Fig. 5,   A , B and C represent the time that ρ R reaches the stable state when the SI links in the corresponding set are removed. For example, in the subpanel (a), the point A represents that in the time 350 ρ R reaches the stable state when the links in E [0. 6, 1] are removed. It is found that the value of ρ R in the stable state hardly changes as the increase of weight of removed SI links, which indicates that only breaking large weight links cannot lower the epidemic size (For instance, the stable values of ρ R in Fig. 5(a) are almost the same for three different scenarios). Moreover, when some large weight SI links are broken, it is more effective to slower the epidemic spreading, which can be exhibited from the time that ρ R tends to be stable (such as A, B and C in Fig. 5(a) and (b) ). But the gap of three time points in Fig. 5(a) and (b) is small. Therefore, we just show two cases (E [0,1.2] and E [0.8,2.0] ) in Fig. 5 (c) and one side of weight intervals takes the extremum, which exhibit the different stable time of ρ R (A and C) more clearly. Comparing subpanels (a) and (b) in Fig. 5 , we can find that breaking more SI links can slower the epidemic spreading more effective, because A corresponds to the time 350 and 400 in subpanels (a) and (b) respectively. We also find that when more weak links are broken, the stable time will be longer and the disease is suppressed more effectively. For instance, C in subpanel (a) is equivalent to the time 500, and C in subpanel (b) is equivalent to the time 600. Besides, when the set E [0.2,1.0] in subpanel (b) is expanded to E [0,1.2] in subpanel (c) from two sides or in other words more weak and strong links are removed, the effect of disease control is much better. Since the point A in subpanel (b) is approximately equal to the time 400, while A in subpanel (c) reaches to the time 500 and the difference can be exhibited more obviously from C in subpanels (b) and (c). The above results suggest that both small and large weight links (or we can treat them as weak and strong links) play important roles on epidemic spreading, which has been concluded by many pre- vious literatures [34, 35] . Based on previous studies, we try to show the disparity between strong links and weak links. The difference may be that strong links lead to high infection rate (infection rate β (ω) increases with weight ω) and contribute to the epidemic spreading, while the weak links mainly stabilize the network structure [34, 35] . Therefore, when θ o lies in the interval ∼[0, 0.65], rewiring strategy just destroys the stability of the network. As θ o increases, rewiring strategy rapidly lowers susceptible individuals' infection rate by removing strong links, which results in disease control. Previous studies have shown that the contact patterns can dramatically influence the disease dynamics [36, 37] , so we also verify the proposed model on other types of networks. For this purpose, we apply our model with two kinds of weight distributions (uniform distribution and normal distribution) on different networks including the square lattice network, the Erdös-Rényi (ER) network [38] , the Barabási-Albert (BA) network [39] and Watts-Strogatz (WS) network [40] . Fig. 6 exhibits that, in despite of disparate degree and weight distribution, the dynamic relation between epidemic size and θ o is similar to the result in Fig. 3 . Although Fig. 6 (b) and (d), there is no region III in the ER and WS networks with uniform weight distribution, which may be related to the coaction of special network structure and weight distribution. The initial vaccination rate, vaccine effective rate and the cost of vaccine may have impact on the disease propagation [41, 42] , so we investigate the stability of the results under different kinds of vaccine in square lattice network with uniform weight distribution. Each subpanel in Fig. 7 is associated with a given (v, e) . As a result, the similar results like Fig. 3 come out, but there are some quantitative differences between the results. First, the epidemic size becomes small with the increase of initial vaccination rate (ρ ′ V ) in each subpanel. For example, when v = 0.2 and e = 0.2 ( Fig. 7(a) ), the blue triangle symbols (ρ ′ V = 0.08) is lower than the black square symbols (ρ ′ V = 0.02) as θ o is small. Second, when v is fixed (such as v = 0.2), the final recovered density (R∞) gradually reduces as vaccine effective rate (e) increases. The main reason resulting in the decline of epidemic size is that more rational individuals prefer to take high effective vaccine. Third, when v gets larger (from 0.2 to 0.8), less individuals incline to take vaccination and different initial vaccination rate (ρ ′ V = 0.2, 0.5, 0.8) leads to more similar epidemic size with small θ o . Especially, when e = 0.2 and ρ ′ V = 0.02 (the black square symbols in Fig. 7(a) , (d), (g)), the disease can only be controlled to some extent even with high link-breaking threshold, especially when v = 0.8. That is because, compared with expensive but low effective vaccine, most individuals prefer to low-cost strategy, namely, rewiring strategy. According to the above analysis, we can conclude that, without vaccination, the disease cannot be suppressed very well only through rewiring strategy, which implies that vaccination plays an important role on lowering the epidemic size. The network evolution, caused by rewiring strategy (link-breaking and link-creating strategy), may affect the epidemic spreading [43, 44] . Results presented in Fig. 8
