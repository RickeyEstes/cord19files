Carbon tetrachloride is one of the commonly used agents to induce hepatotoxicity in experimental animals. In the endoplasmic reticulum CCl 4 is converted to ÅCCl 3 and ÅCl 3 COO resulted in lipid peroxidation (Snyder and Andrews, 1996) . Lipid peroxidation increase endoplasmic reticulum and other membranes permeability to Ca 2+ resulting in a severe disturbances of calcium homeostasis and consequently necrotic cell death (Weber et al., 2003) . Significant increase in the levels of transaminases (AST and ALT) alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and serum bilirubin were observed in the control group treated with CCl 4 (Table 1 ). Treatment with10 mg/kg (20.7 lmol/kg) of SI prior to the administration of CCl 4 resulted in a significant decrease (p < .001) in the elevated AST, ALT, GGT, ALP and bilirubin levels in rats (Table 1) . SI have scavenging ability against prooxidant free radicals. In addition, it increases the intracellular concentration of GSH. SI restores the cellular membrane permeability and increases its stability against xenobiotics injury; increases the synthesis of ribosomal RNA and stimulates protein synthesis to regenerate liver cells (Saller et al., 2007; Dehmlow et al., 1996) . The hepatoprotective and nephroprotective effect of HF at 12 mg, GL at 84 mg/kg body weight as well as combination of the two compounds at 6 mg + 42 mg/kg body weight and 12 mg + 84 mg /kg body weight of HF and GL, respectively, was explored in comparison with SI. The protective effect was monitored via serum parameters, tissue parameters as well as histopathological study using light and electron microscope. Serum liver parameters (Table 1) indicated that GL alone offers the least reduction in the elevated levels of the studied enzymes. SI at 10 mg /kg body weight was still the best in improving the level of liver serum parameters. SI reduced the AST by 62%, ALT by 67%, GGT by 56%, ALP by 39% and bilirubin by 69%. Following SI the combination of HF and GL at 12 and 84 mg /kg body weight reduced significantly (p < .001), the elevated levels of AST by 57%, ALT by 62%, GGT by 52%, ALP by 37% and bilirubin by 68%. Table 2 represents the effect of the studied compounds on the levels of LDH, creatinine kinase, serum creatinine, urea and uric acid. The same pattern was observed where SI provide the best protection followed by the HF and GL at 12 and 84 mg/kg combination except for the effect of GL at 84 mg/kg body weight where the level of LDH was reduced by 20% following SI that offered 23% reduction. Malonaldehyde (MDA) is the main end-product of polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation that cause toxic stress in cells. The increase in MDA levels induced by toxic agents leads to tissue damage (Alqasoumi and Abdel-Kader, 2012b) . SI reduced the levels of MDA to 0.92 ± 0.07 and 1.00 ± 0.06 nmol/g in both liver and kidney tissues after the elevation caused by CCl 4 to 4.79 ± 0.18 and 3. 92 ± 0.24 nmol/g respectively (Table 3) . Best results from the tested compounds were observed from the HF and GL combination at 12 and 84 mg/kg where the levels of MDA reduced to 2.07 ± 0.13 and 1.52 ± 0.09 in both liver and kidney tissues respectively. Treatment of animals with CCl 4 lead also to reduction in the non-protein sulfhydryl moiety (NP-SH) (Alqasoumi and Abdel-Kader, 2012b). SI restored the levels to 4.24 ± 0.21 and 4.41 ± 0.21 followed by HF and GL combination at 12 and 84 mg/kg where measured levels were 4.18 ± 0.22 and 3.47 ± 0.11 nmol/g in both liver and kidney tissues respectively. One of the liver damage circumstances is the disruption and disassociation of polyribosomes on endoplasmic reticulum leading to reduction in the biosynthesis of protein expressed as decrease in TP. Restoring the normal levels of TP is an important indicator for liver recovery (Alqasoumi and Abdel-Kader, 2012b). The levels of TP reduced from 105.38 ± 3.76 and 1 All values represent mean ± SEM. a As compared with Control group. b As compared with CCl 4 only group. * p < .05; ** p < .01; *** p < .001; ANOVA, followed by Dunnett ' s multiple comparison test. 50.44 ± 2.82 to 52.68 ± 2.31 and 70.25 ± 4.81 g/l following CCl 4 intoxication in liver and kidney tissues. SI restored the TP levels to 97.40 ± 3.74 and 119.35 ± 2.58 while the HF and GL combination at 12 and 84 mg/kg came in the second position by increasing levels to 72.65 ± 2.36 and 110.97 ± 3.19 g/l in both liver and kidney tissues respectively. Histopathological study for liver (Fig. 2) and kidney (Fig. 3) tissues were supportive for the biochemical parameters results. Liver of rats treated with CCl 4 showed multiple areas of necrosis, severe vacuolization, fatty changes, parenchymal architecture disruption, deposition of collagen fibers, decrease in glycogen content, dilatation of sinusoids, central vein congestion and inflammatory infil- tration. Treatment with SI showing slight necrosis, vacuolization, portal triage with slight aggregation of nuclei towards endothelial of portal vein. Liver cells of rats treated with CCl 4 and combination of 12 mg HF, 84 mg GL/kg body weight showed central vein area and triode area with slight to moderate fatty changes and vacuolization. Other than this, it is almost look like normal. Other treatment did not show good protection for the hepatocytes. Kidney cells of rats treated with CCl 4 showed necrotic tubule walls accompanied by intertubular hyaline material, while those treated with CCl 4 and SI showed slight necrosis in glomerulus and tubules along with degeneration and accumulation of hyaline material. Kidney cells of rats treated with CCl 4 and combination of 12 mg HF, 84 mg GL/kg body weight showed glomerulus and tubules area with very slight degenerative changes. The liver and kidney tissues obtained from each group were also prepared for electron microscopic study (Figs. 4 and 5) . Liver cells of rats treated with CCl 4 showing nuclear and cellular deterioration and accumulation of cytoplasmic electro-dense material. Treatment with SI prior to CCl 4 showed almost normal appearance with the least cellular deterioration and accumulation of electro-dense materials. Liver cells of group treated with CCl 4 and combination of 12 mg HF, 84 mg GL/kg body weight showed almost normal appearance with minimal cellular deterioration. Other treatment showed less protective effect for the liver cells from CCl 4 toxicity. Treated with CCl 4 resulted in sever intracellular deterioration and accumulation of electro-dense materials in the kidney cells. Group treated with CCl 4 and SI showed kidney cells with almost normal appearance with the least cellular deterioration and accumulation of electro-dense materials. Best protection from the tested compounds for the kidney cells was observed in the group treated with CCl 4 and combination of 12 mg HF, 84 mg GL/kg body weight where cells looks like normal with slight intracellular deterioration and accumulation of electro-dense materials was observed.
