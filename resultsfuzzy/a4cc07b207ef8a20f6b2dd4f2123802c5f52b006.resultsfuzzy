Among the 425 original tweets posted by CDC, the size of information diffusion (i.e., number of retweets) ranged from 1 to 473 (M = 39.89, SD = 42.98, skewness = 6.89, kurtosis = 38.73) and structural virality ranged from 1.00 to 5.81 (M = 2.26, SD = 0.63, skewness = 1.08, kurtosis = 5.58). Consistent to findings from a dataset of 1 billion tweet events (Goel et al., 2016) , median structural virality was less than 3, exhibiting fairly shallow diffusion trees. For the perceived message features of the 425 tweets, the average ratings were 2.22 (SD = 0.42) for susceptibility, 3.28 (SD = 0.58) for severity, 3.23 (SD = 0.59) for efficacy 2 , 1.86 (SD = 0.39) for positive emotion, 1.49 (SD = 0.34) for negative emotion, 2.92 (SD = 0.44) for novelty, and 2.28 (SD = 0.41) for entertaining. Among all the tweets, 82.9% included URLs and 85.6% included hashtags. Table 1 presents message examples selected based on the survey ratings. Table 2 presents descriptive statistics of and zero-order correlations among the key variables in this study. With respect to health topics, 79.92% of the tweets communicated health education and prevention knowledge; 20.08% of the tweets featured CDC's announcement such as sponsored events and awards. Among the tweets that mentioned health education and prevention knowledge, specific topics covered included cancer (39), vaccine (31), food safety (29) (17), HIV (15), mosquito-borne disease (11), and others (e.g., diabetes, birth control, hepatitis, heart disease, hand hygiene, injury prevention, and listeria outbreak etc.)
