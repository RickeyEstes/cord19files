Evidence for pneumonia etiology due to S. pneumoniae is based on three independent pieces of information: high load nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) PCR, high density whole blood (WB) PCR, and blood culture. This sensitivity analysis evaluated the impact of lowering the blood culture sensitivity priors for S. pneumoniae only, while also specifying increased certainty. The midpoint value of the sensitivity prior ranges decreased from approximately 11% to 2%; no changes were made to the other sensitivity or aetiology priors. *Site-specific observed results. The Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 33 (FTD Resp-33) multiplex PCR kit which was used in the PERCH study includes the following 33 viral, bacterial and fungal targets: Data from all nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs (NP/OP) PCR targets were used in the analysis except Klebsiella pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Some targets underwent additional confirmatory testing, as described below. 10 • Klebsiella pneumoniae: Positive results were considered invalid because of poor assay specificity. 17 • Moraxella catarrhalis: This target was summarized in the descriptive NP/OP PCR analyses but excluded from aetiology analyses due to poor specificity (odds ratio significantly less than 1.0) and inability to determine a density threshold that improved specificity such that is was positively associated with case status. 12 M. catarrhalis is a commensal bacterium that can cause pneumonia but was observed more commonly among controls than among cases. There is some evidence in the literature that presence in the NP/OP may be protective against developing pneumonia. The hypothesized biological rationale is that if the child's microbiome is slanted more toward colonization of M. catarrhalis, it may out compete other more pathogenic organisms. 18 Because the underlying assumption of the analytic model is that what is measured in the NP is a signal of what is in the lung, the statistically significantly higher rate in controls who do not have pneumonia is in direct conflict with this assumption. Therefore, these NP/OP data do not provide useful diagnostic evidence of pneumonia etiology and so are not used. • Legionella species: Samples positive for Legionella species underwent confirmatory PCR testing using a different extraction method due to contamination of the original extraction reagents. Only one positive remained following confirmatory testing. Although there was only one positive, since we systematically tested for Legionella species and it is thought to be a potential cause of paediatric pneumonia, it was included as a possible cause in the aetiology analysis; this was handled consistently across all sites, including those where no Legionella species positives were detected. Quantitative PCR density thresholds were applied to NP/OP for pathogens with poor specificity (i.e., odds ratio <1) where a threshold that improved distinction between cases and controls could be identified: pneumococcus, H. influenzae, cytomegalovirus, and Pneumocystis jirovecii by NP/OP. [11] [12] [13] Measles was not systematically tested for in the PERCH study. Of all PERCH study enrolled cases, 33 cases were identified who met the PERCH study clinical criteria for measles testing (history of measles in past month, measles rash, measles admission diagnosis, measles discharge diagnosis); the NP/OP swabs from these 33 cases were tested for measles. Of the 33 suspected measles cases, 4 (12.1%) tested positive (Kenya n=2; Mali n=2; all had either an admission or discharge diagnosis of measles), none of whom had a positive CXR. Since measles was not systematically tested for, we elected to remove this as a potential cause in the aetiology analysis and simply describe the number of positives identified in the PERCH study. These four cases were excluded from the aetiology analyses and population aetiology distributions. Quantitative PCR density thresholds were applied to whole blood results to improve distinction between prevalence in cases and controls. 14,15 Blood culture was performed at each site's laboratory for each case enrolled. Positive specimens underwent confirmatory testing at the central laboratory. 10 Below is a summary of the review process: • Out of 4,176 cases with blood culture data, 526 (12·6%) had an organism isolated from blood o 328/526 (63·4%) cases were classified as having only a contaminant organism isolated (based on a priori list of contaminants; see below Table 2 ) • The remaining 198 blood culture positive cases underwent individual case reviews by a panel of PERCH study senior investigators to determine whether the organism detected was the likely cause of the child's hospitalisation or a contaminant. The review included clinical, laboratory and risk factor data. o This review resulted in an additional 51 cases being classified as having only a contaminant organism isolated. o A total of 147 cases had one or more pathogen identified that were considered to be plausible causes of the hospitalisation. A similar review was conducted for PCR and culture results from lung aspirate and pleural fluid specimens. The lung aspirate results used to update the aetiology priors were restricted by the following criteria: 1. The specimen was obtained within 3 days of enrollment to exclude any nosocomial infections. 2. The positive result was confirmed to be a cause of the child's pneumonia by the Silver Standard Working Group (see Section 2.4) based on their clinical presentation, course of treatment, and the laboratory data (e.g., weakly positive PCR results were excluded). 3. The child was not HIV+ (as the primary analysis excludes HIV+ children). To inform the aetiology priors the following rules were applied to the eligible specimens to determine the updated aetiology priors used in the PIA (Table 7) : Abbreviations: LA, lung aspirate; PCV13, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
