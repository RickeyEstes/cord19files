Previously, an in vitro frameshifting assay was performed with all constructs containing the same slippery sequence (G GGA AAC) and a 7-nt single-stranded spacer 19 . A 7-nt spacer (UGAUCGA) is present in SF206, SF209 and SF211, and a slightly different spacer (UAGUUGA) is present in the four remaining constructs. Neither of the two spacer sequences is expected to affect the (un)folding dynamics of the downstream pseudoknot which has two G-C pair-rich stems (Fig. 1a) . The mRNA-ribosome interaction is assumed not to be significantly affected by the small change of the unstructured single-stranded spacer. The frameshifting pseudoknots chosen in our studies include the "wild-type" pseudoknot (SF206) with the three-dimensional structure revealed by NMR 18 , and a series of mutants (see Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S1 ) whose design was based on the NMR structure 19 . The structure of SF206 reveals consecutive minor-groove base triples formed between stem 1 and loop 2 (Fig. 1c) . Mutations were designed to disrupt the base triples and the base stacking interactions expected to affect frameshifting efficiencies 19 . The previous mutational studies 19 revealed that SF206 and the six mutants display in vitro frameshifting efficiencies in the range between 21% and 1%, which allows us to investigate the possible coupling effect between stem 1 and loop 2 on thermal and mechanical stabilities of the frameshifting pseudoknots, and the possible correlation with the frameshifting efficiency. mRNA thermal stability has no correlation with in vitro frameshifting efficiency. The NMR structure for the "wild-type" SRV-1 pseudoknot SF206 (containing the residues 1-34, see Fig. 1b ) was solved in a buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM KHPO 4 /KH 2 PO 4 (pH 6.4) 18 . We measured the ensemble thermal unfolding of the oligonucleotide constructs for the pseudoknots (containing the residues 1-34) and a control hairpin (containing the residues 1-19) in 20 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.3 with varying NaCl concentrations (0 mM, 200 mM or 1 M NaCl). In the thermal (un)folding experiments, all the melting curves are superimposable for heating and cooling curves (Fig. 2a,b) , suggesting the thermal unfolding and folding transitions are reversible. In the buffer with 0 mM NaCl, except for SF348, two apparent transitions (with melting temperatures at T m,1 and T m,2 , T m,1 < T m,2, ) are observed for all pseudoknots (Fig. 2a,c) . In 0 mM NaCl, the T m,2 of SF206 (~80 °C, Fig. 2a) is similar to the melting temperature of the control hairpin (stem 1 hairpin) (Fig. 2b) , suggesting that stem 2 (T m,1 ) melts before stem 1 (T m,2 ) in the SRV pseudoknots. SF348 shows two-step thermal melting in the buffers containing 200 mM (Fig. 2e ) and 1 M NaCl (Data not shown), suggesting that stem 2 in SF348 is formed in 200 mM and 1 M NaCl but not in 0 mM NaCl. SF348 has a significantly lower T m,1 compared to other pseudoknots, probably because the shortened loop 2 creates steric strain resulting in partial deformation of stem 2 and/ or unstacking with stem 1. According to the nearest-neighbour thermodynamic model [42] [43] [44] , changing a G-C (SF206) to a C-G (SF209) and an A-U (SF211) pair (Fig. 1a) destabilize stem 1 by 0.5 or 1.9 kcal/mol (penalty for terminal A-U pair is considered), respectively, at 1 M NaCl and 310 K (predicted using RNAstructure 5.3). Consistently, in 0 mM NaCl, the T m,2 values of SF209 (76.4 °C) and SF211 (71.2 °C) are significantly lower than those of other pseudoknots (Fig. 2c,d) . As expected, except for SF209 and SF211, the T m,2 of the pseudoknots in 0 mM NaCl are in a narrow range between 78 and 82 °C, which is close to the melting temperature of control stem 1 hairpin (80.1 °C). The SRV pseudoknots and the control stem 1 hairpin do not completely melt even at 95 °C ( Fig. 2a,b ,e) in the buffer with 200 mM or 1 M NaCl. Taken together, our thermal melting profiles suggest that the transition with higher melting temperatures (T m,2 ) corresponds to the thermal unfolding of stem 1 in the pseudoknots. The two-step melting pathway observed in our study is in agreement with the coarse-grained simulation for SF206, although an apparent one-step melting transition was observed in the simulation 41 . Stem 1 is directly in contact with a ribosome during the − 1 frameshifting process, and its stability may correlate with frameshifting efficiency. However, our thermal melting data show no obvious correlation between T m,2 and in vitro frameshifting efficiency measured previously 19 by using a commercially available in vitro translation system (reticulocyte lysate (Promega)) (Fig. 2d) . The absence of a correlation is consistent with previous observations 37 and is likely due to the fact that the formation of stem 2 and minor-groove triples (formed between stem 1 and loop 2) in a pseudoknot may exert a coupling effect in stabilizing stem 1 as has been observed in recent nanopore pseudoknot unzipping experiments 45 . The thermodynamic stabilization effect due to the coaxial stacking [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] in the buffers with 1 M (red), 200 mM (green) and 0 mM (blue) NaCl, respectively. Solid lines represent the heating curve and dashed lines represent the cooling curve. (c) Normalized UV melting trajectories of pseudoknots and control hairpin in the buffer with 0 mM NaCl. SF348 shows only the melting of stem 1 suggesting that the pseudoknot structure for SF348 does not form at this condition. (d) No correlation is observed between T m,2 in 0 mM NaCl and in vitro frameshifting efficiency previously measured 19 . The blue solid line and the black dashed lines represent the linear fitting curves for data points with and without SF209 and SF211 included, respectively. (e) Normalized UV melting trajectories of pseudoknots and control hairpin in the buffer with 200 mM NaCl. (f) No correlation is observed between T m,1 value in 200 mM NaCl (green) and 1 M NaCl (red) and previously measured in vitro frameshifting efficiency 19 . The green and red lines represent the linear fitting curves for thermal melting data points obtained at 200 mM and 1 M NaCl, respectively. Scientific RepoRts | 6:39549 | DOI: 10.1038/srep39549 between stem 1 and stem 2 and stem 1-loop 2 bases triple formation is not observed in the thermal denaturation, because under the global temperature perturbation, the base triples and stem 2 melt before stem 1. Previous NMR and mutational studies revealed that a triplex structure is formed between stem 1 and loop 2 and disruption of the base triples decreases the frameshifting efficiency 18, 19 . Thus, the triplex stability may correlate with the frameshifting efficiency. However, the thermal melting transitions for the triplex and stem 2 seem not to be resolved, resulting in one overlapped transition (Fig. 2a ,c,e). Thus, the low-temperature transition (T m,1 , Fig. 2a ,c,e) of the pseudoknots corresponds to the melting of both the tertiary triplex structure and stem 2. We did not observe a clear correlation between T m,1 (in 200 mM or 1 M NaCl) and previously measured in vitro frameshifting efficiency (Fig. 2f) 19 . The absence of a correlation might be due to the fact that the melting of the triplex (formed between stem 1 and loop 2) and duplex (stem 2) are not coupled, i.e., triplex and stem 2 melt independently, but with an overlapped broad melting transition. The relatively broad melting transitions and limited resolution of the experimental data prevented us in extracting the thermodynamic parameters for the transitions 9, 15, 46 . Taken together, our experimental ensemble thermal melting results reveal no correlation between thermal stability and in vitro frameshifting efficiency.
