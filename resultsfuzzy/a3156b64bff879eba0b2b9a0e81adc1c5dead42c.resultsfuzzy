A frequent side effect of IFN-I treatment against cancer or chronic viral infections is the induction of autoimmune reactions. Consistently, ISG expression is a hallmark of many spontaneous systemic or tissue-specific autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosous (SLE), Sjogren's syndrome, psoriasis, and other skin disorders (11) . The dysregulation of IFN-I responses observed in patients with these autoimmune diseases likely results from both genetic and environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies show that polymorphisms in genes involved in IFN-I responses strongly correlate with increased susceptibility to many autoimmune diseases (11) . Diverse environmental factors can also contribute to the onset of autoimmune diseases. Microbial infections often precede first clinical manifestations of autoimmune diseases. Whether infections (116) and/or alterations in the commensal microbiota of the affected barrier tissues (117, 118) are the cause or rather the consequence of autoimmunity is still matter of debate. Infection-or dysbiosis-induced tissue damages and unbridled IFN-I responses can contribute to initiate autoimmune reactions. Gender is another prominent factor affecting susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. Women are more prone to autoimmunity, which may result from endocrine regulation of IFN-I responses. pDC IFN-I production is enhanced in human and mouse females, due at least in part to cell-intrinsic enhancement of TLR7/9 responses by the female hormone estradiol (119). In autoimmune diseases, different mechanisms could operate to initiate the dysregulation of immune responses leading to a vicious circle of reciprocal activation between innate IFN-I responses and adaptive self-reactive lymphocyte responses (Figure 4) . Adaptive immune cells are educated to spare "self." This occurs through negative selection of potentially autoimmune B and T cells during their development in the bone marrow or thymus, respectively, a process called central tolerance. Self-reactive B or T cells that have escaped this pruning can be either deleted or functionally inactivated once they have egressed in secondary lymphoid organs or non-lymphoid tissues, a process called peripheral tolerance. In some individuals, polymorphisms in genes involved in the promotion of central or peripheral tolerance lead to a higher number, diversity, and/or responsiveness of self-reactive lymphocytes in the periphery, in particular of B cells secreting anti-DNA or anti-RNP antibodies (120, 121) . Mammalian DNA or RNA are poor inducers of pDC IFN-I induction under normal conditions. However, pre-existing anti-DNA or anti-RNP autoantibodies can break this innate tolerance of pDC. Indeed, antibodies binding to self nucleic acids can protect them from degradation and compact them into nanoparticles that are very effective for the induction of IFN-I in pDC (Figure 4) . DNA-containing immune complexes (ICs) are frequently found in the serum of SLE patients (SLE-ICs) and can activate pDC IFN-I production (122) . In turn, pDC IFN-I activate cDCs, monocytes (123) , and B cells, leading to a vicious circle of reciprocal activation between DCs and Frontiers in Immunology | Microbial Immunology FIGURE 4 | A simplified model of the deleterious role of IFN-I in several autoimmune diseases. When exposed to different kinds of injuries (microbial infection, commensal microbiota dysbiosis, chemical or physical insults), healthy tissues can undergo cell damage and death. These events induce the release of apoptotic bodies encompassing self RNA or DNA. Neutrophil recruitment and activation in inflamed tissues can also constitute a potent source of self nucleic acids, through the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). Self RNA or DNA can associate with cationic peptides (e.g., LL37) as shown in psoriatic patients or with inflammatory molecules (e.g., high mobility group box 1, HMGB1) to generate nanoparticles that are extremely efficient for IFN-I production by pDC and eventually other cell types. pDC can also be efficiently activated for IFN-I production by immune complexes (ICs) generated by the association between self nucleic acids and auto-antibodies as frequently found in the serum of systemic lupus erythematosus patients. IFN-I promote the differentiation and/or the maturation of antigen-presenting cells, in particular different subsets of DC. Activated DC can then present self-antigens for activation of auto-reactive T CD4 + cells, including follicular helper lymphocytes, which in turn activate auto-reactive B cells for auto-antibody secretion, leading to a vicious circle of reciprocal activation between innate and auto-reactive adaptive immune cells. iDC, immature DC; mDC, mature DC; Mo-DC, monocyte-derived DC. See main text for further details. self-reactive lymphocytes and to the exacerbation of autoimmune responses (Figure 4) . Certain infections or dysbiosis of the commensal microbiota of the affected barrier tissues could promote chronic production of host amphiphatic peptides able to combine with eukaryotic DNA or RNA, likely released from dying cells, thus forming pDC-activating nanoparticles. Indeed, in psoriatic skin, both a high expression of LL37 and a massive infiltration of pDCs is observed (124) (Figure 4) . Hence, to treat many autoimmune diseases, novel therapeutic strategies could be designed to target dysregulated pDC IFN-I production or B cell activation by IFN-I. One of the most common complications of primary infections by many respiratory viruses, in particular influenza virus, is a lifethreatening pneumonia due to secondary pulmonary infections by bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Haemophilus influenza (125, 126) . These pathologies affect especially infants, elderly, and immunocompromised patients. Retrospective studies indicate that secondary bacterial pneumonia was highly recurrent in lung tissues isolated from patients who died during last century influenza pandemics, independently of antibiotic availability (127, 128) . Influenza virus induces high IFN-I responses in human beings and mice. In both hosts, secondary bacterial infections are lethal only when they occur in a limited time window following primary viral infection (3-7 days), around the peak of IFN-I responses, before complete virus clearance. Mouse models of viral/bacterial coinfections are being used to dissect disease mechanisms (129) . IFNAR1-deficient mice appear more resistant to secondary pulmonary bacterial infections, showing that IFN-I responsiveness contributes to disease (130) . Similarly, after lymphochoriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, wild-type but not IFNAR1-deficient mice are more susceptible to LPSinduced septic shock (131) . Several mechanisms may contribute to the detrimental role of IFN-I in secondary bacterial infections ( Figure 5) . Early during viral infection, IFN-I decrease the host ability to control bacterial replication, by dominantly polarizing immune responses toward anti-viral functions, simultaneously inhibiting the development of the types of immune responses required for protection against most bacterial infections. IFN-I can inhibit the production of chemokines required for the recruitment to the respiratory tract of antibacterial effector innate immune cells, in particular neutrophils or monocytes/macrophages (132, 133) (Figure 5) . Depending on the experimental models used, IFN-I can on the contrary induce a CCR2-dependant recruitment of classical monocytes (134) . In infected tissue, IFN-I might skew the functional polarization of resident or infiltrating monocytic cells toward immunosuppression, because it does limit their antibacterial functions by inhibiting their IL-1 production (135) (136) (137) while it might promote their production of IL-10 and nitric oxygen intermediates. The exact nature of infiltrating monocytic cells is not clear and could correspond to activated classical monocytes, MoDCs, monocyte-derived macrophages, or myeloidderived suppressor cells (MDSCs). The boundaries between these putatively different cell types are currently ill-defined (138) . These cells could fuel local replication of monocyte/macrophage-tropic bacteria (134) , be immunosuppressive (139) or contribute to local immunopathology (140) . The role of IFN-I on monocytes/macrophages is complex and will require further investigations to determine when it is protective versus deleterious and what the underlying mechanisms are. Depending on the context, IFN-I can either promote or inhibit the induction of Th1 cytokines such as IL-12 and IFN-γ, and myeloid cell responses to IFN-γ (10, (141) (142) (143) . IFN-I can also polarize CD4 T cell responses toward Th1 at the expense of Th17, while the Th17-type cytokines IL-17A and IL-22 are required for host defense against pulmonary www.frontiersin.org bacteria by inducing the production of anti-microbial peptides and of tissue repair molecules ( Figure 5 ) (141) (142) (143) . IFN-I may not only affect host resistance to bacterial infection, but also host tolerance, i.e., the ability of the host to tolerate a given burden of pathogen without undergoing excessive tissue damages (143, 144) . Hence, to counter IFN-I deleterious effects during secondary bacterial infections, it will be important to better delineate the respective contribution of lung tissue tolerance modulation and of immune-mediated resistance weakening. Another well documented example of deleterious effects of IFN-I due to their inappropriate functional polarization of immune responses is the enhanced susceptibility to fungal infections of patients with genetically determined hyperactive IFN-I responses, as exemplified in the hereditary disease Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiadis (CMC) (Figure 5 ) (145) . Patients with CMC have a significant deficit in Th17 CD4 T cells, at least in part as a consequence of altered responsiveness to IL-6 or IL-21. Several STAT1 mutations were identified in patients with autosomal dominant CMC. Gain-of-function STAT1 mutations were found to hard wire CD4 T cell responses to cytokines toward STAT1 signaling, compromising their STAT3-dependent ability to produce IL-17 upon IL-6 or IL-21 stimulation. This was associated to induction of a global IFN-I transcriptomic signature in blood (145) . Deleterious IFN-I effects on immunity to Candida might not only occur in CMC patients but also in other types of individuals upon secondary fungal infections occurring shortly after a primary viral infection, likewise to the situation discussed above for secondary bacterial infections. Indeed, PolyIC induced IFN-I abrogate innate immunity to systemic candidiasis in mice (146) , and IFNAR-deficient mice can be more resistant to Candida infection under certain experimental settings (147) . However, the role of IFN-I in the modulation of the ability of immunocompetent hosts to control fungal infection is disputed (148, 149) . The inhibition of Th17 responses by IFN-I could be protective in at least one important human pathology, MS (Figure 5) . MS represents a striking exception to the previously discussed detrimental role of IFN-I in autoimmune diseases. Indeed, a large proportion of MS patients have low serum IFN-I activity and low ISG levels. These MS patients present a significant reduction of MS relapse upon IFN-β administration (150) . The underlying mechanisms are not yet completely unraveled. However, in the experimental autoimmune encephalitis mouse model of MS, Th17 responses bear a major contribution to nervous system damages and are inhibited by the IL-10 and IL-27 induced upon IFN-I administration (151) . In summary, IFN-I responses can be deleterious in autoimmunity by promoting a vicious circle of reciprocal activation between innate immune cells and auto-reactive CD4 T or B lymphocytes. IFN-I responses can also be deleterious upon secondary bacterial or fungal infections in the lung or the kidneys occurring shortly after a primary viral infection, by compromising the recruitment of anti-microbial innate effector cells and/or by preventing the proper functional polarization of immune responses. We will now discuss how IFN-I responses can also compromise host immune defenses against certain viruses and promote chronic infections. Different LCMV strains such as Armstrong and clone-13 (Cl13), respectively, lead to acute versus chronic infections in mice. A hallmark of chronic LCMV infection is the loss of the proliferative potential and effector functions of anti-viral CD8 T cells, a process called exhaustion. Exhausted CD8 T cells are characterized by a high expression of the inhibitory receptors PD-1, CTLA4, and LAG-3 (152) . In vivo blockade of these inhibitory receptors can reverse T cell exhaustion and allow resolution of the chronic infection (152) . IFN-I and ISGs are induced early after infection with all strains of LCMV, albeit to lower levels with those leading to chronic infection. This early IFN-I production is critical to limit viral replication (3). In models of acute infection, IFN-I responses rapidly return to normal, undetectable, levels, before viral replication is completely controlled. In contrast, ISG induction is maintained in chronic infection, including the expression of PD-1 ligands on APCs and of the immunosuppressive IL-10 cytokine, consistent with a prolonged expression of IFN-I albeit at low levels (13, 14) . In vivo neutralization of IFN-I by antibody administration promoted resolution of chronic LCMV Cl13 infection, allowing the Frontiers in Immunology | Microbial Immunology restoration of functional anti-viral CD8 T cell responses at least in part through CD4 T cell-and IFN-γ-dependent mechanisms (13, 14) . During persistent LCMV Cl13 infection, chronic low level IFN-I production polarizes CD4 T cell responses toward T follicular helper (Tfh) rather than Th1 functions. Thus, chronic IFN-I responses promote enhanced anti-viral B cell responses but facilitate CD8 T cell exhaustion due to deficient CD4 T cell help, therefore contributing to host failure to prevent chronic infection (153) . Strikingly, establishment of chronic infection by LCMV Cl13 could also be prevented by early administration of two shots of a high dose of exogenous IFN-I, at days 2 and 5 post-LCMV inoculation. This treatment allowed viral clearance by rescuing anti-viral CD8 T cell from exhaustion (154) . Altogether, these studies show that the timing and duration of IFN-I production during viral infections is critical in determining how this response will impact the balance between the virus and the host. An early and robust but transient production of IFN-I promotes strong induction of cell-intrinsic viral restriction mechanisms as well as adequate polarization of adaptive anti-viral immune responses, which combined effects lead to viral clearance. In contrast, if the production of IFN-I is too low and/or too late, both viral replication and low IFN-I responses become chronic, their combined action leading to induction of immunosuppressive effects and to inadequate functional polarization of CD4 T cells. This results in CD8 T cell exhaustion and maintenance of chronic infection. Chronic viral replication and CD8 T cell exhaustion is also a hallmark of HIV-1 infection. We will now discuss the complex and disputed role of IFN-I in this disease.
