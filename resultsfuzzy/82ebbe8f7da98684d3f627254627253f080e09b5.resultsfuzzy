To verify the RNA-seq analysis, seven genes (GZMA, GZMK, LITAF, DDX60, AVD, CYP26B1, and ENSGALG00000019325 (novel gene)) were examined by qRT-PCR using the RNA of CD4 + T cells derived from infected and non-infected birds. The results ( Figure 5 ) showed good agreement with the DE analysis pattern, indicating the reliability of the latter. To verify the RNA-seq analysis, seven genes (GZMA, GZMK, LITAF, DDX60, AVD, CYP26B1, 295 and ENSGALG00000019325 (novel gene)) were examined by qRT-PCR using the RNA of CD4 + T cells 296 derived from infected and non-infected birds. The results ( Figure 5 ) showed good agreement with 297 the DE analysis pattern, indicating the reliability of the latter.
