It can be envisaged that the use of siRNAs as an antiviral treatment for VEEV infection would involve a multiple-dosing regime, resulting in the virus being exposed to siRNAs over an extended time period. As RNA viruses have high mutation rates, there is a strong probability of VEEV escaping the inhibitory effects of RNA interference by introducing mutations in the siRNA target sites. To determine the ability of VEEV to overcome RNA interference, strains TrD and BeAn8 were subjected to 10 consecutive incubations in the presence of siRNA 2, Lamin A/C siRNA, the pool of non-targeting siRNAs or the VEEV siRNA pool (Fig. 8) . Individual siRNAs were used to test whether resistant mutations arose more readily in the presence of single siRNAs compared to pools of siRNAs. However, in the case of VEEV strain TrD, resistance to the siRNA pool was observed after four exposures, whilst resistance to siRNA 2 alone was observed after seven exposures ( Fig. 8A and B) . In contrast, VEEV strain BeAn8 remained susceptible to either the individual siRNA or the pool of siRNAs throughout the experiment ( Fig. 8C and D) . RNA was extracted from virus that had been exposed to 10 consecutive incubations in the presence of siRNA 2 or the VEEV siRNA pool. The sequences of the siRNA target sites were analysed and found to be identical to the conserved sequences (results not shown).
