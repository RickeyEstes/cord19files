In the unrooted control phylogeny, SARS-CoV branches, with convincing support, along the lineage leading to group II coronaviruses (Fig. 1a) , which is in agreement with previous reports Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . The long branch separating SARS-TOR2 from the group II coronaviruses, in comparison to the branch lengths separating the various group II representatives, is in general agreement with earlier opinions for SARS-CoV as a new, fourth group of coronaviruses (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) , and contrary to Snijder et al. (2003) who suggest, based on analysis of replicase ORF1b, that SARS-CoV is more aptly considered a distant member of group II. For the individual alignments the models of sequence evolution identified by MODELTEST were GTR+gamma (alignments corresponding with TOR2 coordinates: 10, 645-10,902; 12,613-13,344; 13,725-14,147; 20,100-20,984; and recombinant regions: 15,259-15,342; 19,577-19,862) , 125; 13, 610) , GTR + gamma + invariants (7366-7710; 10,147-10,626; 11,554-11,973; 11,989-12,516; 18,117-18,980; 14,172-17,936; 19,065-19,871) , or HKY + gamma (recombinant region: 15,974-16,108). Under our recombination criteria, several regions of recombination were evident, involving two alternative positions of SARS-CoV (Fig. 1b and c) . These two branching arrangements were SARS-CoV on the branch leading to group III viruses (avian) or as sister lineage to the group I clade (porcine, human, etc.). PLATO identified anomalous regions included 15,259-15,342 (Z value of 5.0666; Z values greater than 3.8896 judged to be significant), 15,974-16,108 (Z value of 4.3997; Z values greater than 3.8896 judged to be significant), and 19,577-19,862 (Z value of 6.1619; Z values greater than 3.6471 judged to be significant). Phylogenetic analysis of 15,259-15,342 supported SARS-CoV with group III (Fig. 1b) , whereas 15,974-16,108 supported SARS-CoV with group I (Fig. 1c) . Phylogenetic analysis of the third putative recombinant region identified by PLATO (i.e. 19, 862; Fig. 1d) , proved inconclusive, with ML and Bayes supporting SARS-CoV with group I, and parsimony and NJ yielding the control topology (bootstrap support under 60%, and Bayesian posterior probability less than 0.50). Three further recombinant regions were identified by phylogenetic analysis, that did not yield significant PLATO results, simply because the entire (or very nearly) alignment appears to represent a recombinant zone (i.e. nothing for PLATO to identify as anomalous; Fig. 1d ). Mutational saturation at synonymous positions of codons can be ruled out as a possible explanation for the alternative branching arrangements of these five (possibly six) recombinant zones, because phylogenies for these same regions based on alignments that exclude third codon positions, as well as amino acid sequences, yielded identical topologies. The resulting genomic picture suggests a complex evolutionary history of recombination involving SARS-CoV (Fig. 1d) . The placement of SARS-CoV on the branches leading to groups I or III and not nested within these groups indicates that either the recombination events are ancient in nature or the donor species are not present in currently available sequence data. The inclusion of greater host species representation, which is presently possible for a few regions of the genome, such as a 922 bp region of polymerase (for which there are additional GenBank sequences from cat, dog-group I; turkey-group III; human OC43, porcine-group II) (Stephensen et al., 1999) , did not allow a more specific identification of the possible species involved, and implicated the same recombination event between positions 15,259-15,342 (Fig. 1d) . Two recent reports regarding the SARS genome suggest, based on analysis of amino acid sequences, that there is either no evidence for recombination or no evidence for recent recombination involving other coronaviruses (Marra et al., 2003) . Although the methodological details regarding recombination detection are scant in both these reports, we gather that in the one case they came to this conclusion by comparing branching arrangements between gene trees (Marra et al., 2003) , and in the other case by performing an amino acid similarity plot . In the first case, a comparison of gene trees would not pick up recombination events that crossed gene boundaries, or which involved relatively short stretches of sequence within a gene. In the second instance, similarity plots will only tend to pick up recombination events in comparisons that involved the actual donor, a close relative to the donor, and/or a recent event. In contrast, our analysis agrees with Rest and Mindell (2003) in identifying recombination in RDRP (RNA dependent RNA polymerase), although our approach tends to suggest more specific break-points, and a larger number of smaller recombinant regions than does their analysis (three regions in RDRP: 13, 610; 15, 342; 15, 108 , based on TOR2 coordinates). We also identified several additional recombinant regions in the SARS-CoV genome, encompassing regions not analyzed by Rest and Mindell, including: 12, 344 including all of nsp9 and most of nsp10 and 18,117-18,980 of nsp14. Analyses of currently available sequences of coronaviruses, yields the conclusion that group III is exclusively composed of avian coronaviruses, while groups I and II have viruses isolated from pig, human, murine rodents, cat, dog and bovine. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV recombined with a member of the group III lineage, suggesting that an avian coronavirus was involved, a further point of general agreement between our results and that of Rest and Mindell (2003) . Other recombination events evident from our analysis, involve the branch leading to group I, which encompasses viruses from several mammalian taxa, including two very divergent strains of porcine coronaviruses. Thus, our analyses indicate that human SARS-CoV have a past history of recombination with coronaviruses hosted in distinct animal groups. Mixed animal husbandry practices, in proximity to human populations, could have led to the evolution of the SARS coronavirus and facilitated its progression as an infectious disease in humans. Novel human influenza viruses are thought to have arisen from the reassortment, within porcine hosts, of avian, swine, and human influenza viruses (Gregory et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 1999) . We suggest that our recombination results for SARS-CoV implicate a suspiciously analogous history. More specifically, SARS-CoV could have arisen from a combination of host jumping and recombinational events, involving as yet unidentified strains of avian coronavirus group III and mammalian (possibly pig) coronavirus group I. Rest and Mindell (2003) suggested host-species shifts have been relatively common in the diversification of coronavirus lineages, a result consistent with our hypothesis for SARS-CoV. Critical to determination of the evolutionary origin of SARS-CoV are expanded epidemiological surveys of wild and domestic animals, including in particular, additional avian species. Understanding the origin and evolutionary history of SARS-CoV is important to proper vaccine development as well as the epidemiological modeling of future outbreaks. Current perception of the SARS-CoV genome is one of relative genetic stability (Brown and Tetro, 2003; Ruan et al., 2003) , however, our analyses indicate that SARS-CoV has a complex history of recombination, suggesting that the genome may not be as stable as previously thought. We propose that future epidemiological modeling efforts and vaccine development take this new evidence into account.
