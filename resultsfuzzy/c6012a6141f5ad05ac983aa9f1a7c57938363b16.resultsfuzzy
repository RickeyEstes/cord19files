Results of univariate analyses showed that the HR associated to in-hospital death of NT-proBNP was 1.368 (95% CI 1.217-1.541, P<0.001). Meanwhile, older, male, history of hypertension (HP), myoglobin (MYO), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), high-sensitivity troponin-I (Hs-TnI), white blood cell (WBC), lymphocytes (LYM), c-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were correlated with the risk of in-hospital death (Table 2) Modes of Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to evaluate the independent prognostic effect of NT-proBNP level. After adjusting for sex and age (Mode 1), the HR of NT-proBNP for in-hospital death was 1. Figure 3 ).
