A negative result from a microbiological culture, PCR assay, fluorescent antibody assay, or other detection method could mean that the patient does not have an infection with that organism, or that the specimen was inadequate, or that the assay is not sensitive enough. Some organisms are much harder to culture than others, or to detect by alternative methods such as antigen detection, special stains, or serological testing. In some situations, multiple assays will be used simultaneously to rule out an infection, such as cultures from multiple sites, combined with a molecular assay, combined with serological testing. Cost considerations would favor limiting testing to the most appropriate number of tests needed for a given patient. Likewise, any assay has some number of false-positive results, so all results must be considered in a clinical context.  Caution must be used when interpreting quantitative molecular results, such as viral loads. Many of the tests used in clinical laboratories are not available as FDA-approved assays and the results are not standardized, although all laboratories are required to perform extensive validation of their assays. While HIV viral load testing is standardized, many viral assays are developed in-house by specific laboratories and are not FDA-approved. The viral loads for cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and adenovirus are often followed over time in transplant patients. The comparison of viral loads over time in a single patient should be done with data from a single accredited laboratory. However, a result from one laboratory should not be compared to a result from a second laboratory to determine if the viral load has increased or decreased, unless the results are standardized between laboratories. Otherwise, the physician may mistakenly determine that the viral load has changed for better or worse when it has not. Unlike many chemistry tests that can be run immediately, directly from a blood specimen within minutes, microbiology results are often delayed due to the time required to grow an organism, isolate it from the other organisms in the culture, and determine susceptibility results. One approach to reduce turnaround time for blood cultures is the use of FISH, which uses peptide nucleic acid probes targeting specific microbe 16S rRNA after a blood culture has flagged positive. A limitation is that the FISH probes will detect only organisms that are targeted, missing organisms not targeted with the selected set of probes. Although faster than traditional bacterial identification systems that require incubation time for enzymatic or carbohydrate utilization assays to occur, there is extra work to run the FISH and then to perform further testing when required. Workflow and cost considerations prevent some labs from adopting this approach. Another rapid approach is to perform MALDI-TOF analysis directly from extracted material from a positive blood culture, without waiting for isolation of specific organisms. Of significant note, organisms will often be missed in mixed infections for a number of these rapid approaches, so a complete workup of all organisms present in a blood culture is still required. The positive outcome of these rapid approaches is that preliminary data are provided to clinicians for rapid refinement of the differential diagnosis and possible early treatment changes. Scientists continue to work on the 'Holy Grail' of complete microorganism identification directly from patient specimens without the need for culture. Currently, to detect the maximum number of organisms, a routine clinical microbiology laboratory uses a combined approach of culture, serology, antigen detection, biomarker detection, molecular methods, microscopy, and stains.
