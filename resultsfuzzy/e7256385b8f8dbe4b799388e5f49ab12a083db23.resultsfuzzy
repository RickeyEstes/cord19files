We used RNAVLab to computationally predict and identify secondary structure motifs in the terminal nucleotides in the 3 0 end of RNA2 that could potentially be critical for RNA replication [47] . We analyzed predicted RNA secondary structures of progressively shorter lengths from the 3 0 end of RNA2 from the seven members of the nodavirus family presented in Table 1 . Our goal was to identify common motifs across samples, code predictions, and viruses. Due to the dynamic nature of the prediction programs, the final secondary structures are heavily dependent on neighboring structures: having a certain substructure present in all the predictions, independently from the starting and ending points of the segments, may indicate a strong base pairing that ultimately may be present in nature. For each virus, the terminal 100 nucleotides of the 3 0 end of RNA2 were sampled using the progressive segmentation strategy with a step size of 10 nucleotides. The three different prediction programs currently available in RNAVLab were used, i.e., Pknots-RG, Pknots-RE, and NuPack. All the final predictions, obtained from genome segments from different viruses, with different lengths, and different prediction programs, were processed by the tool in the structure analysis component that allows for identifying common motifs, i.e., pseudoknots or stem-loops, and then were aligned for identification of shifted and overlapping structures. The prediction time for the several secondary structures ranged from several hours for long segments predicted using Pknots-RE to a couple of seconds for short segments predicted using Pknots-RG and NuPack. The predictions were performed in parallel across the pool of machines managed by Condor. For each of the seven viruses, 10 sample segments per virus were processed for prediction using the three codes, for a total of 210 predictions. Within the 210 predictions, 1982 common motifs were found, ranging from simple motif with a single bond to more complex structures such as pseudoknots. To reduce the number of motifs and identify the most significant ones, overlapping motifs were merged into canonical motifs. Overlapping motifs are those contained within larger motifs in terms of nucleotide length and number of bonds but with the same prediction frequency for the same prediction codes and viral genomes. Moreover, simpler motifs, i.e., hairpins with fewer than 4 base pairs, and less frequent motifs, i.e., motifs that were predicted by a single code or had a frequency below 33%, were not considered. The frequency of a motif is measured as the number of times the motif was indeed predicted over the maximum number of times the motif could be predicted by the three codes in samples with a suitable length to accommodate the motif length and its starting portion.

For each virus, Table 2 presents the motif length, the number of nucleotide bonds, the frequency of the predictions across codes and samples, the number of predictions per code (where E stands for Pknots-RE, R stands for Pknots-RG, and N stands for NuPack), and the motif secondary structures in terms of brackets. The alignment of the 28 motifs allows for rebuilding larger motifs. Figs. 15-21 show the output of the RNAVLab analysis (a) and the PseudoViewer representation of the RNA2 terminal part for each virus with the common motif that has resulted from the analysis of the several predictions (b). For NoV (Fig. 15 ) and BBV (Fig. 16) , RNAVLab consistently predicts the presence of stem-loop structures near the 3 0 end of RNA2. In particular, for NoV a hairpin is predicted from nt 1299 to nt 1322, within the last 50 nucleotides of RNA2. For segments shorter than 40 nucleotides, the stem-loop is no longer predicted. For BBV, we predict two hairpins within the last 50 nucleotides: from nt 1357 to nt 1370 and from nt 1376 to nt 1391, respectively. For both SJNNV (Fig. 20) and GGNNV (Fig. 21 ), RNAVLab identifies a pseudoknot followed by a hairpin at the terminal part of their RNA2 segment: while the pseudoknot is identical, the terminal hairpin in SJNNV resembles the hairpin in GGNNV but it has an additional pair of nucleotides. A similar pseudoknot followed by a hairpin is also found at the end of BoV (Fig. 17) and at the terminal part of PaV (Fig. 18) , although for the latter virus, this structure is followed by a tail of 23 nucleotides that is predicted to fold into a variety of hairpins of different sizes that vary with the program used. A pseudoknot is found at the very end of FHV (Fig. 19) together with a hairpin that is located inside the pseudoknot to form an HL-out type pseudoknot. These results found with RNAVLab are consistent with the work conducted experimentally in [48] . We are currently studying whether the pseudoknots and stem-loops are indeed critical structures that drive the genome replication of these viruses. To address this critical question we are combining computational and experimental methods. Driven by the computational results presented in this paper, we will ultimately address the question of whether the biological relevance of the pseudoknots and stem-loops can indeed be experimentally verified. This will be accomplished using two approaches. First, to determine whether the predicted structures can be verified in solution, we will generate a nuclease map using single-and double-strand-specific ribonucleases (RNases) as described by Tuplin et al. in [49] . Viral RNA will be transcribed in vitro and treated with RNases A, T1, and V1, to cleave the 3 0 end of single-stranded uracils and cytosines, the 3 0 end of single-stranded guanines, and double-stranded nucleotides, respectively. A labeled primer will be used for reverse-transcription of the digested RNAs and sequencing of the undigested cDNA transcription templates. This technique will allow us to confirm or refute predicted structural elements. Second, to test the role of these predicted structures in the viral life cycle, we will use a process called reverse genetics. Because it is technically difficult to make changes to RNA directly, we will use cloned complementary DNA (cDNA) copies of the viral genomic RNA instead. We will use site-directed mutagenesis to make specific deletions and substitutions of nucleotides within the predicted structural elements. The altered cDNAs will be introduced into cultured cells, where they will be transcribed into RNA by cellular DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. These primary RNA transcripts will then be able to replicate in the presence of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Therefore, we will test the effect of the RNA2 mutations by transfecting the mutant form into cells together with RNA1 as a source of RdRp. Following incubation to allow the viral RNA to replicate, we will isolate total cellular RNA from the cells and assay for the presence of RNA replication products (negative strand intermediates of RNA1 and RNA2, together with production of subgenomic RNA3) using strand-specific Northern blot hybridization. For example, to test the function of the predicted stem-loop near the 3 0 end of NoV RNA2, we could delete it altogether or change specific nucleotides to disrupt base pairing interactions within the predicted stem. If these structures are important for viral RNA replication, we will observe a decrease in the level of replication products detected (relative to wild-type RNA2 controls). Together these methods will allow us to experimentally test whether the structures we predict in the RNAVLab are physically present in the viral RNAs and whether they have functional significance in the viral life cycle.
