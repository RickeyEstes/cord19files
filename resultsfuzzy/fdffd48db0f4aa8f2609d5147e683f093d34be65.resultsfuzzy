Since there was some variation in the number of sections obtained from different animals, the activities of various enzymes in serial homogenates were related in an "idealized villus-crypt unit."%' This maneuver allowed data from a number of animals to be easily compared. The percent distance each homogenate represented of the total villus-crypt unit was determined in any given tissue block. Thus, enzyme activity in the sixth of 16 homogenates was considered to represent enzyme activity at a point between 35% and 40% of the distance between tip and base of an "idealized villus-crypt unit." Table 1 . The enzyme activity of each homogenate was calculated both as specific activity (micromoles of substrate hydrolyzed per hour per milligram protein) and as total activity (micromoles of substrate hydrolyzed per hour per homogenate). Since both lactase and sucrase activities were performed on the same homogenates, the lactase/sucrase ratio is independent of how the individual activities are expressed. However, to allow for statistical comparison between individual lactase and sucrase activities at any point along the villus-crypt unit, two alternative modes of expression of data were utilized: (a) The highest specific activity of each enzyme along the villus-crypt unit in any given rat was set at 100% and all other activities on the same unit expressed as a percent of that highest activity. (b) The total activity of each tissue block was determined by summation of total activities of consecutive homogenates. The total activity of each enzyme in each homogenate was then expressed as a percent of the total activity of the tissue block. The data from each of eight rats were plotted along the idealized villus-crypt unit as explained above. Average values for each 5% of distance were calculated. When comparing lactase to sucrase activity at any given height of the villus-crypt, Student's t-test was used.2Q One-way analysis of variance30 was used to determine if there was significant variation of mean lactose/sucrose (L/S) ratios at different heights of the villus crypt. Figure 1 shows the distribution of specific lactase, sucrase, and acid /&galactosidase activity along the villus-crypt unit. The general pattern of distribution of activity agrees with previous reports.'-' The mean L/S ratios at different heights of the villus crypt are plotted in Figure 2 . Since both enzyme assays were performed on the same homogenate, the L/S ratio is independent of how enzyme activity is expressed. The results show that there is a definite gradient of increasing L/S ratio in going from crypt to apical villus. Using one-way analysis of variance, the ratio in lower villus is significantly less than in apical and midvillus ( Table 1 ). The reason for this increase in L/S ratio can be seen if the specific activity of each enzyme is expressed as a percent of the maximal specific activity along a particular villuscrypt unit (Figure 3 ). Sucrase reaches maximal activity in enterocytes along the upper 70%-75% of the villus-crypt height, whereas lactase does not peak until the top 45%-50%. If the total activity of each enzyme in each homogenate is expressed as a percent of the total activity of the tissue block, the lag in expression of maximal lactase activity is also seen (data not shown).
