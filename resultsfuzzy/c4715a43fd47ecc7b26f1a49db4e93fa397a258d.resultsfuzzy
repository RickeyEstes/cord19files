Introduction: Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has been showing more than 99% of sensitivity and specificity in detecting trisomy 21, 18 and 13. However, for sex chromosomal aneuploidy (SCA), the specificity has been lower than that of those three autosomal trisomies. Recent reports explains that some NIPT false positive results were caused by maternal copy number variant (CNV) and fetal/placental mosaicism. Here, we present a false positive fetal SCA (47, XXY) result caused by maternal X chromosome copy number variation. Methods: A pregnant woman who is suffered from placental insufficiency at 17 weeks donated her blood to conduct NIPT research done by Green Cross Genome. Trisomy of 21, 18 and 13 was not detected; however, it was suspicious of having SCA (47,XXY). Results: G scores for X and Y chromosomes were -0.86 (normal female fetus: Gx:-2.58~3.04, normal male fetus:Gx<-2.58) and 6.31 (normal male fetus:Gy>5, normal female fetus:Gy<5). Real-time PCR for SRY gene confirmed male fetus and estimated fetal fraction was about 10%. To rule out segmental maternal CNV, which could skew the G score, the bin median value is calculated from the median of zscores measured per 50 Kb bin. Together, visualization was performed by plotting the per-bin z-score across the X chromosome. As a result, the bin median of chromosome X was not increased compared to that of normal male pregnancy and plotting of the z-score of the X chromosome was indicative for the presence of a maternal CNV across about 550 Kb region. Indeed, subsequent high resolution microarray analysis of maternal white blood cell DNA confirmed a duplication of approximately 521 Kb at chromosome Xq28 including MECP2, the common duplication region for male patients with severe intellectual disability, hypotonia at birth, progressive spasticity, epilepsies, recurrent infections, and early death.Conclusions: Zooming in to subchromosomal bins allows us to detect false positive results of NIPT. In case of NIPT results suggesting fetal trisomy including SCA, the confirmation of the presence of maternal CNV would be recommended to avoid unnecessary referral for invasive testing and also to evaluate the risk to the fetus.

Introduction: To address the need for a clinical NGS platform for low input DNA samples and the requirement for a quick turnaround time in some clinical settings, we developed and validated a solid tumor custom MSK-AmpliSeq panel in formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor and matched normal DNA samples and benchmarked this amplicon-based Ion Torrent sequencing assay against our hybridization capture-based clinical NGS clinical assay, MSK-IMPACT (Cheng D, et al 2015) . Methods: Given the tendency of Ion Torrent technology for higher basecalling error rates within homopolymer stretches, we first focused our validation on samples with at least one insertion/deletion (INDEL) in combination with one or more single nucleotide variants (SNV) in the exons covered by the MSK-AmpliSeq panel and considered for NYS DOH submission. DNAs from 68 specimens (34 tumor/normal pairs) previously run on MSK-IMPACT were selected. MSK-AmpliSeq library construction was performed with 20ng of FFPE tumor and matched normal DNA by multiplexed amplification of 891 regions tiled by 2126 amplicons. MSK-AmpliSeq covers 94 genes including all clinically actionable genes present in the larger MSK-IMPACT panel. Sequencing was done on the Ion Torrent PGM and the data were analyzed with a custom pipeline developed at MSK. Aligned BAM files generated by Torrent Suite were primer trimmed and variant calling was performed to detect SNV and INDEL variants using VarScan2, which were annotated using ANNOVAR. SNVs and INDELs were filtered for variant allele read depth and variant allele frequency (AF) at 15X and 5% and 40X and 10%, respectively. Genotyping of historical (unmatched) normal blood BAM files at variant loci was used to remove recurrent systemic artifacts. Results: By comparing the MSK-AmpliSeq variants detected in the 34 tumor/normal pairs with a stringent custom analysis pipeline to the variants previously identified by the MSK-IMPACT assay, 72/77 (93.5%) were detected by the MSK-AmpliSeq assay in the validation exons, of which 41/44 (93.1%) and 31/33 (93.9%) were SNVs and INDELs, respectively. The five missed exon variants (6.4%) were present at lower coverage upon reviewing the sequencing raw files. Two SNV and two INDEL variants were discarded by the pipeline due to our filtering thresholds and one SNV due to an amplicon failure. One new variant detected by the MSK-AmpliSeq pipeline analysis but not originally called by MSK-IMPACT was found at sub-threshold coverage upon manual re-review of the MSK-IMPACT sequencing reads. Conclusions: MSK-AmpliSeq Ion Torrent sequencing data analyzed through a custom pipeline identified the correct variants in 93.5% of the calls detected with our MSK-IMPACT clinical NGS assay. Specifically, we were able to confidently detect 93.1% SNVs and 93.9% INDELs calls present at more than 5% and 10% AF respectively. To eliminate potential false positive calls, our analysis thresholds missed 6.4% of real variants present in the sequencing raw files. Our results demonstrate that combining a stringent filtering for somatic variants detected in tumor/normal pairs with the exclusion of targeted primer sequences and recurrent sequencing artifacts results in a robust AmpliSeq-based assay with improved sensitivity and specificity. Its mutational profile is known to be similar to small cell carcinoma, but genomic aberration of LCNEC is not well identified. Methods: In this study, 22 LCNEC samples was analyzed to investigate genomic aberrations including single nucleotide variation (SNV) and small indel mutations, copy number variation (CNV) and structural variation under targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) system. Using genomic DNA isolated from tumor and matched normal FFPE tissues, DNA libraries were generated using the SureSelect XT kit with TruSeq adapter, and 505 targeted genes were enriched by capturing with RNA baits (Agilent), and followed by sequencing with MiSeq system (Illumina). Mutect, somatic indel locator, Breakmer, and Recapseq algorithms were used for identification of SNV, indel, Translocation and CNV, respectively. Results: Under 2.9 Mb of whole target size, mean target coverage and % more than 30x coverage were 168x and 94. 14q12-q13 (NKX2-1, FOXA1 ) and 8p22 (DLC1). Specific copy number alteration was associated with tumor recurrence. One patient showed a well known druggable target, ALK-EML4 fusion, and which is validated by immunohistochemistry. Conclusions: Our data suggest that targeted NGS could be used for detection of druggable targets and genome based prognostication of LCENC of the lung. M.B. Durso, S. Zhong, A.I. Wald, L.M.

Introduction: Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) serves as a discovery tool for detection of novel fusion types and quantifying gene expression levels in research laboratories. It is not routinely applied in the clinical setting due to difficulties in both wet sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. We have developed and validated an RNA-Seq approach that can be effectively used in the clinical laboratory for detection of gene fusions and gene expression in oncology samples. Methods: RNA-Seq analysis was performed with sequencing parameters optimized for use in the clinical laboratory and validated on 200 ng of RNA from 13 frozen tumors with known fusion types. Transcriptome libraries were generated with the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA kit (Illumina) and sequenced using rapid run on the HiSeq 2500 using on-board clustering and the HiSeq Rapid SBS Kit v2 (Illumina). A custom bioinformatics pipeline was developed that uses both existing bioinformatics tools including Tophat and Chimerascan, and also in-house developed scripts and filters for quantifying gene expression levels as well as improving the specificity of fusion detection. The pipeline was validated on 26 tumors with previously known gene fusions. Results: RNA-Seq analysis was optimized to sequence 5 tumor samples in a 27 hour run. An average of 192x106 total reads per sample were generated with 97% of >Q30 quality score. Between 2 and 50 reads spanning break points was detected per driver fusion. The developed bioinformatics pipeline accurately detected different types of fusions including fusions in ALK, BRAF, PPARG, RET, NTRK1, and NTRK3 genes in all samples analyzed. Custom filters narrowed down the fusion candidate list to 1-3 clinically important fusions per tumor sample that were further confirmed by evaluation of break points and expression pattern of fused genes. The cost of sequencing reagents was $832/sample and library preparation, sequencing, and analysis running time was 59 hours per sample. Conclusions: Whole transcriptome (RNA-Seq) analysis can be used in clinical setting for accurate detection of gene fusions and gene expression in oncology samples. Its clinical utility may be the highest for those tumors where no targetable mutations had been detected by less expensive and more rapid targeted NGS analysis.
