IFN-l4 is a novel type-III IFN with moderate similarity to other type-III IFNs; it has 29% amino acid identity with IFN-l3, the most related member of this family (Prokunina-Olsson and others 2013). The three other type-III IFNs (IFN-l1, IFN-l2, and IFN-l3), which share high protein identity (81% between IFN-l1 and IFN-l2 and 96% between IFN-l2 and IFN-l3), were discovered in 2003 (Kotenko and others 2003; Sheppard and others 2003) . All four type-III IFNs are encoded by a 55 Kb genomic cluster on the human chromosome19q13.2. Due to low sequence similarity between IFNL4 and the genes for other type-III IFNs, IFNL4 could not be identified by a homology search. The reference human genome sequence has the rs368234815-TT allele, which does not support the IFN-l4 ORF, thus the existence of IFN-l4 was not predicted. IFN-l4 was identified by direct cloning and annotation of sequences discovered through RNA sequencing of human hepatocytes treated with PolyI:C to mimic viral infection (Prokunina-Olsson and others 2013). Once the protein sequence of human IFN-l4 was known, it was used to search for IFN-l4 orthologs in all *100 vertebrate species with genomic information available through the UCSC Genome browser. Complete ORFs encoding IFN-l4 proteins were found in several mammalian species, but not in nonmammals (Key and others 2014) . The regions corresponding to IFN-l4 could not be found in the mouse and rat genomes, although orthologs for IFN-l2 and IFN-l3 are present in these species. Now, we generated expression constructs for 11 IFN-l4 orthologs ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S1) and tested their functionality in a human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, in comparison with human IFN-l4. We used the human cell line, HepG2, because it has all necessary components for type-III IFN signaling and was used to characterize human IFN-l4. We recognize that a human cell line may not be optimal for all IFN-l4 orthologs because the human receptors (IFNLR1 and IL10R2) and other signaling components may not work efficiently with nonhuman IFN-l4s. However, our aim was to perform initial comparative characterization of IFN-l4 orthologs in the same established experimental system. Additional studies on IFN-l4 orthologs should be performed in experimental systems relevant for species of interest. Protein sequence alignment of IFN-l4 orthologs showed high similarity between primates, while more diversity was observed among nonprimate species (Fig. 1) . All orthologs were predicted to have a leader peptide, with a cleavage site located between amino acids 22 and 23 in most cases and between 21 and 22 or 23 and 24 in some cases. Interestingly, the lowest leader peptide prediction score was for human IFN-l4 (0.56), followed by marmoset (0.67); all other orthologs had higher prediction scores (0.77-0.87) (Table 1) . However, a swap of leader peptides between the poorly secreted IFN-l4 and highly secreted IFN-l3 did not affect the secretion of IFN-l4 (Hamming and others 2013), suggesting that the predicted strength of the leader peptide might not be relevant for IFN-l4 secretion. The most diverse area in IFN-l4 is the sequence immediately after the predicted leader peptide-the 7 amino acid fragment was missing in all primates and this sequence was different in all nonprimates (Fig. 1) . This fragment did not seem to affect the leader peptide prediction scores and its functional significance is unclear. Despite being only poorly secreted, human IFN-l4 can efficiently activate IFN signaling (Prokunina-Olsson and others 2013; Onabajo and others 2015). We evaluated biological activity of the IFN-l4 orthologs after transient expression in HepG2 cells stably expressing an interferonstimulated response element (ISRE) coupled with luciferase reporter (ISRE-Luc); this system was previously used to characterize human IFN-l4. We observed differential biological activity of the IFN-l4 orthologs: compared with human IFN-l4, proteins from chimpanzee, orangutan, marmoset, and cynomolgus showed similar levels of biological activity (ISRE-Luc activation), while the dog protein showed significantly higher activity (by 40%). Orthologs from rhesus, panda, and elephant were significantly less active (25% compared with the human IFN-l4, Fig. 2 ). Biological activities of the IFN-l4 orthologs measured in this experiment are likely to be affected by differential affinity of these proteins to human receptors and do not represent quantitative comparisons. However, the fact that all of the IFN-l4 orthologs were able to activate ISRE-Luc reporter above the background level (control-Halo) indicates that these proteins are biologically active as IFNs, even in human cells. Because all of the IFN-l4 orthologs are predicted to have leader peptides and showed biological activity for induction of IFN signaling, which is typical for exogenously acting IFNs, it is likely that at least a portion of these proteins is secreted. At the same time, if these orthologs behave like the human IFN-l4, they will also be retained in the cytoplasm. To test this, we evaluated protein expression and cellular localization of all orthologs transiently expressed in HepG2 cells. Western blot analysis of protein lysates (Fig. 3) , flow cytometry analysis ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ), and confocal imaging ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ) confirmed that all IFN-l4 orthologs are detectable by an antibody or a fluorescent ligand for the Halo-tag, which is present on all these proteins. Confocal imaging showed that in most cases, IFN-l4 was expressed as a cytoplasmic protein, although, in some cases, it was also detected in the nucleus (such as in dog and panda, Supplementary Fig. S2 ). PSORT analysis (Nakai and Horton 1999) identified nuclear localization signals within IFN-l4, and some of the orthologs were predicted to be nuclear proteins (Supplementary Table S2 ); however, there was no correlation between these predictions and intracellular localization observed by confocal imaging. It is possible that nuclear localization of IFN-l4 might be an alternative option utilized in some specific conditions. Cytoplasmicnuclear shuttling has been reported for some factors involved in immune response ( Jans and Hassan 1998) , including IFN-g (Subramaniam and others 1999) and IRF3 (Kumar and others 2000) , and the possible functional effects associated with nuclear translocation of IFN-l4 should be further explored in relevant experimental models. Next, we tested the possibility of detection of IFN-l4 orthologs with two custom monoclonal antibodies generated against nonoverlapping peptides within the N and Cterminal parts of the human IFN-l4 protein. In Western blot analysis (Fig. 3) , flow cytometry ( Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs S1 and S3), and confocal imaging (Fig. 5) , the mouse monoclonal antibody (MAB-IFN-l4) recognized IFN-l4 from the human, chimpanzee, orangutan, rhesus, marmoset, cynomolgus (all the primates in the panel), and elephant. The results were similar for orthologs that were detectable both by Halo-tag and MAB-IFN-l4. The rabbit monoclonal antibody (RAB-IFN-l4) recognized only the human IFN-l4. This is likely because the area that can be recognized by MAB-IFN-l4 is more conserved between species compared with the area that can be recognized by the RAB-IFN-l4 (Fig. 1) . Further genomic studies may help to identify IFN-l4 orthologs in other relevant species. The success and accuracy of these predictions rely on the quality and completion of available genomic sequencing and additional targeted DNA sequencing is often needed to validate the existing sequences and close the gaps. Detailed analysis of functional properties of IFN-l4 orthologs in relation to differences in protein sequences could provide additional information on its biology. In conclusion, the importance of IFN-l4 in different aspects of antiviral response can be implied based on the conservation of its sequence and biological activity in mammals. However, it remains largely unknown what factors induce endogenous IFN-l4 expression in different conditions and why elimination of IFN-l4 was a beneficial event in humans strongly supported by positive selection. Answers to these questions might be relevant for dealing with existing and emerging infections across species. Viral infections have been directly responsible for some of the most dramatic and deadly disease pandemics in human history and many of these infections, including the recent Ebola outbreak, are of zoonotic origin ( Jones and others 2008). There are also indirect devastating effects of these infections through the loss of livestock and wildlife, causing food shortages and financial distress (Frolich and others 2002; Thumbi and others 2015) . Some animals and corresponding derived cell lines are used for studies of human infections and vaccine development (Meurens and others 2012; Gerdts and others 2015) . Thus, our findings and research tools might help to identify factors that trigger IFN-l4 expression and explore the spectrum of its biological effects in different conditions.
