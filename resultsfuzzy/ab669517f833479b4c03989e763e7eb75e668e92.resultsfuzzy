The detailed analysis of each case is described in the following subsections. Interaction parameters (c i ) are calculated for each window in each case by using non-linear least square method. Cooperation Commensalism A parasitic type of relationship where one airline benefits from the activity of the other. In effect, the market is shared with a market leader and a follower, but it is the interest of the leader to share with the follower. for FSCs (a) and LCCs (b) when the moving-window LV model is applied. Fig. 7 shows that the relationship is not mutualism for all periods, but rather shows a parasitic relationship (commensalism) for some time then a switch in roles halfway through; this supports our motivation of observing changing dynamics over time. Fig. 7 (a) represents dependence of the growth of FSCs on LCCs demand; it shows that FSC did not gain any benefit from of LCCs initially, but began to do so later. The opposite is true for LCCs, where the dependency of LCCs growth on FSCs has decreased over time (Fig. 7[b] ). We can summarise our results by saying that in the early years of the emergence of LCCs within the FSC-dominant market, a parasitic behaviour of LCCs on FSCs is observed. However, the role is reversed in the subsequent years and the competitive dynamics between FSCs and LCCs evolved to a parasitic behaviour of FSCs on LCCs. It is important to understand that dependency of the growth of LCCs on FSCs decreased over time but the growth of LCCs kept increasing (see Fig. 5 ), which indicates that LCCs created their own new market by attracting the new customers.
