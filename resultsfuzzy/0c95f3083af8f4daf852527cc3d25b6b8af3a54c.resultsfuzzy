The design principle for integrating a mechanical sample homogenizer with TruTip nucleic acid purification is described elsewhere [33] . Briefly, the concept involves separating the consumable from the energy-transducing mechanism-in this case, a rotating cylindrical magnet that is external to the lysis tubes (or reagent plate). At high rotational speeds, the external magnet induces the rotation of a small magnetic stir disc inside of each lysis tube, which in turn agitates the solid particles. Particle agitation is controlled by adjusting the speed of the external, rotating magnet. Magnetically-induced vortexing (MagVor) therefore generates a chaotic bead-milling or bead beating effect within the sample using simple hardware components and with minimal heat generated in the solution. Adjacent to the rotating magnet is a motorized carriage with integrated heater that holds all consumables for the extraction including sample lysis tubes, heater tubes, and a 96-well reagent plate. The carriage controls the position of the consumables relative to a fixed-position, 8-channel, custom-built pipetting manifold. The pipetting manifold (with attached TruTips) moves vertically up and down and a positive-displacement syringe pump controls the speed and aspiration/dispense volumes across all eight tips simultaneously. Pipetting speed is used as a proxy and means for controlling flow rate through the TruTip matrix. A selection valve and small air pump control air flow to the individual tips to dry the silica binding matrix after wash steps and before nucleic acid elution. Biosafety concerns were (partially) addressed in the prototype workstation by incorporating a HEPA-filtered exhaust fan and enclosure around the moving parts and consumables, creating a negative pressure air box relative to the operating environment. Electronic components were protected from potential liquid splashes by protective covers that can be wiped down with bleach or other disinfectants. The prototype was also designed to fit within a standard Biosafety cabinet if needed or desired. The synergistic, positive impact of integrated bead milling on nucleic acid recovery is summarized in Table 2 , where DNA yield at least doubled (> 1 ΔC t ) at cell inputs ! 10 3 CFU mL -1 (p < 0.05) and M. tuberculosis dilutions [at 100% extraction and detection efficiency, a 1 C t difference represents a 100% increase in recovered DNA]. The data also show that the extra offline enzymatic liquefaction step is not required for efficient DNA extraction, but was retained for all subsequent experiments because it simplified the transfer of a precise sputum volume from the primary sample container to the automated system lysis tubes. Given the heterogenous nature of individual sputum samples and an inability to accurately split a primary sputum sample, we were unable to determine the relative effect of MagVor alone on native (nonspiked) specimens. In the absence of a centrifugation step or a re-sealable lysis tube, there is a risk of generating aerosols during the homogenization step and contaminating other samples processed in parallel. To address the risk, 2 x 10 8 cells of H37Ra were added to 12 independent sputum samples and processed in three replicate runs, where every other lysis tube, channel, and row in the reagent plate contained a water blank. There was no detectable IS6110 DNA in any of the water blanks (n = 36; C t values > 37 at an estimated LoD of 3 fg per reaction). All other external negative controls processed during this work (n = 53 system runs containing negative controls) were likewise negative (not shown), indicating that the MagVor homogenization does not introduce a significant sample contamination risk. We established analytical performance metrics for the integrated TruTip workstation by amending six independent, TB-negative sputa with a five-fold dilution series of H37Ra cells and extracting them with the automated protocol in Table 1 . Real-time PCR data (C t ) values are summarized in Fig 1 (p 0.05 for each dilution) . Because there was no fully automated sputum extraction method available at the time of this study, we used a commercially-available, manual Norgen Sputum DNA Isolation Kit as a benchmark of performance rather than a head-to-head comparator. One replicate extract from one of the six TruTip sputum samples was PCR-negative at 16 CFU mL -1 (PCR detection limit of 3 fg DNA (< 1 M. tuberculosis cell equivalent)). From these data, the automated workstation can repeatedly and reliably extract M. tuberculosis-detectable DNA from sputum (of variable background composition) containing between 16 and 80 CFU mL -1 . The estimated limit of detection across multiple sputum backgrounds is consistent with published performance guidelines [2] and is within the analytical sensitivity range for detecting M. tuberculosis DNA in smear-negative specimens. Clinical sample characteristics are summarized in S1 Table. Nine samples were both smear negative and culture negative, so these nucleic acid extraction and PCR amplification results are not included in the final analysis (below). Sputum samples ranged from saliva-like to hemoptoic (containing blood), with most samples characterized as mucoid (mucus-like) or mucopurulent (containing mucus and pus). One of the AFB smear positive (+), solid culture positive (+) sputum samples was consumed in its entirety during NALC-NaOH decontamination, leaving 123 sputum extracts and 124 sediment extracts for automated nucleic acid extraction. The M. tuberculosis DNA detection rate was 99% and 100% for sputum and sediment, respectively, for all samples that were not categorized as smear negative, culture negative ( Table 3 ). The single false-negative for sputum was at the detection limit for the paired sediment sample and was positive upon re-extraction. There was no significant relationship between sample quality and M. tuberculosis DNA detection efficacy, indicating that the automated TruTip protocol and workstation is equally effective regardless of sputum composition or consistency. Although only a few samples in the clinical set were described as containing blood, the procedure and reagents are similar to that used for extraction from whole blood, which results in high purity nucleic acid without PCR inhibitors. Even so, additional studies on a wider range of sputum types are required to further characterize the protocol performance. DNA recovery relative to AFB smear and culture status is summarized in Table 4 . There was a significant linear correlation between DNA recovery and smear status (or quantity of acid fast bacteria) for both sputum and sediment extracts, which corresponds with the estimated bacillary load in the original sample. Nucleic acid recovery was significantly higher from raw sputum as compared to that of matched sediments regardless of smear or culture grade (inclusive of smear negative and culture negative samples), averaging at least five times (log 2 2.45) more DNA recovered from raw sputum than sediment (p < 0.0001) and > 10X yield in 34% (39/116) of the smear positive specimens. In fact, there were only 14 samples where there was more detectable M. tuberculosis DNA in the sediment extract than in the raw sputum extract (S1 Table, negative ΔC t values). We suspect that the lower DNA recovery from sediment is due, in part, to cell and/or DNA loss during the sputum decontamination and sedimentation process (e.g., [34] ), or minimal amounts of human DNA in sediment that may otherwise serve as a carrier in sputum extracts. Nevertheless, the data show that one and the same automated protocol is equally efficacious on raw sputum and sediment, regardless of sputum quality or characteristics, and that primary sputum may actually be the preferred specimen for sensitive M. tuberculosis detection or diagnosis. While Table 4 shows a strong correlation between AFB smear status and average C t value (or DNA recovery), we nevertheless tested for the possibility that the sputum extracts contained PCR (or fluorescence) inhibitors that affect the accuracy of the C t measurements. Ten independent sputum extracts of variable quality characteristics were diluted in ultra-pure water and re-analyzed by real-time PCR, with data summarized in Fig 2. The correlation coefficient (R 2 ) was > 0.997 for each sample (not shown). A separate experiment with purified M. tuberculosis DNA amended into PCR-grade water or a pooled, TB-negative sputum extract also showed no difference in C t values over a range of DNA input concentrations (not shown). In combination, these data indicate that amplification or fluorescent inhibitors (if present) were not detectable or negatively influencing reported C t values over the course of this study. We should point out that our study used retrospective frozen specimens which could prematurely break down sputum and lyse bacterial cell walls. Because we focused on challenging the system with the most viscous sputum from smear positive TB patients, we acknowledge that further study including TruTip efficacy on prospective (fresh) specimens with statistically relevant prevalence of smear-negative specimens is required to accurately estimate the clinical sensitivity. The long-term technology objective of this research is to unite automated sputum sample preparation with a M. tuberculosis drug susceptibility test (e.g., [35] ) in a flexible, sample-toanswer diagnostic device. We opted to pursue an "open" sample preparation fluidic architecture of TruTips and reagent plates because the approach (and workstation) provides several straightforward opportunities to increase input sample size (volume), modify reagents, and/or adjust procedural steps to increase extraction efficacy, if needed. Indeed, the specific design of the automated workstation and its open fluidic architecture provides a level of engineering and IVD product development flexibility that is difficult to achieve with cartridge-based or otherwise "closed", point-of-care microfluidic devices. As a stand-alone workstation, however, there is now an opportunity to push sputum nucleic acid sample preparation closer to the point of need and independent of any specific nucleic acid detection technology. TruTip protocols can also be automated on a personal, electronic pipette (e.g., [28] ), so we might expect a similar level of performance by translating the sputum protocol to an ondemand, more manual format and a set of sample preparation tools. Conversely, prior nasopharyngeal aspirate, swab, blood, plasma and saliva protocols [28, 30, [36] [37] [38] can be easily transferred to the automated workstation reported here with integrated heater to further simplify chemical lysis and enzymatic procedures typically performed off-line. TruTip therefore satisfies a basic sample processing demand identified by Denkinger [4] and others [2, 20, 39, 40] . At the same time, the ability to transfer protocols between personalized, on-demand Tru-Tip tools and fully automated workstation affords an opportunity to standardize nucleic acid sample preparation procedures, reagents, and quality control across multiple levels of the health care system, irrespective of desired throughput. We therefore expect TruTip and the automated workstation will add value to the TB community as a stand-alone sample preparation device while continued research focuses on integrating automated TruTip sample preparation with drug-resistant TB amplification microarrays.
