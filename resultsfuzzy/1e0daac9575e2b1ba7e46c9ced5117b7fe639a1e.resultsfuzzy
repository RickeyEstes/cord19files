To explore the general accessibility of mucin-derived Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc as a substrate for commensal sialidases like BTSA from B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482, we exposed BTSA-His and NanS-His or its homologs simultaneously to BSM, suggesting that de-O-acetylated sialic acids are convenient substrates for the sialidase. For this purpose, we incubated BSM with either sialidase BTSA-His, or coincubated BSM with sialidase BTSA-His and either NanS-His, NanS-p1-His, NanS-p2-His or NanS-p4-His. After an exposure time of 4 h, we determined the sialic acids released from BSM first by means of HPTLC. The results of the enzymatic digestions of BSM using BTSA-His alone and combined with NanS-His, NanS-p1-His, NanS-p2-His or NanS-p4-His are shown in Fig. 3 . One mg/mL Neu5Ac (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 9) or Neu5,9Ac 2 (Fig. 3,  lanes 2, 10) were used as standards. Due to its higher polarity, Neu5,9Ac 2 clearly separates beyond Neu5Ac allowing for unequivocal distinction of the two compounds. BSM incubated in buffer only without enzymes served as negative control (Fig. 3, lane 3) . The HPTLC analysis of enzymatically released sialic acids from BSM after incubation with BTSA-His alone (Fig. 3, lane 4) revealed two clearly DAPA-stained bands indicating the presence of enzymatically cleaved de-O-acetylated and mono-O-acetylated sialic acids. On the other hand, the combination of BTSA-His with NanS-His (Fig. 3, lane 5) , NanS-p1-His (Fig. 3, lane 6) , NanS-p2-His (Fig. 3, lane 7) or NanS-p4-His (Fig. 3, lane 8 ) revealed a single strong band, which separates at the position of Neu5Ac in the chromatogram as deduced from standard Neu5Ac (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 9) . Collectively, our experimental data gave evidence that BTSA-His is able to cleave Neu5Ac and Neu5,9Ac 2 from BSM. The enzyme seems not to exhibit any specificity for Neu5Ac or the O-acetylated derivative. Coincubation of BSM with BTSA-His and O-acetylesterases revealed Neu5Ac only, while Neu5,9Ac 2 could not be detected. Due to the suggested capability of NanS-His and its homologs to deacetylate mono-, di-, and tri-O-acetylated sialic acids, the above described digests were repeated and the released sialic acids were detected using mass spectrometry. For this purpose, proteins of the digests were precipitated with methanol and the supernatants were directly applied to nanoESI MS. Mass spectra of sialic acids obtained from digests of BSM using BTSA-His alone, BTSA-His combined with NanS-His and BTSA-His combined with NanS-p1-His are shown in Fig. 4A , 4B and 4C, respectively. Identified sialic acids with the m/z values of the corresponding ions are listed in Table 3A -C, respectively. The mass spectrum obtained from BSM exposed to BTSA-His alone (Fig. 4A) shows ions derived from Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc basic structures and Neu5Ac(OAc) and Neu5Gc (OAc) (listed in Table 3A ). Thus, BTSA-His was capable to cleave off Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc as well as the mono-O-acetylated counterparts from glycans. Di-and tri-O-acetylated sialic acids were not detected and Neu5Ac (lanes 1, 9) , and Neu5,9Ac 2 (lanes 2, 10) served as standards. hence not released by BTSA-His. The combination of BTSA-His with the O-acetylesterases NanS-His or NanS-p1-His revealed ions indicating liberated Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc as shown in the mass spectra of Fig. 4B (listed in Table 3B ) and Fig. 4C (listed in Table 3C ), respectively. Both combined approaches revealed Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc but no O-acetylated sialic acids. The combination of BTSA-His and NanS-p2-His or NanS-p4-His gave the same results (data not shown). In conclusion, the results demonstrate that the combination of both BTSA-His with NanS-His or NanS-p1-His, respectively, enhances the release of de-O-acetylated core Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc from mammalian mucin O-glycans, which might serve as a carbon and/or nitrogen source for EHEC. 4. Recombinant BTSA supports the growth of EHEC O157:H7 strain EDL933 on BSM dependent on the presence of NanS-p We compared the growth behaviour (OD 600 values) of EHEC O157:H7 strain EDL933 (NZ_CP015855) (Saile et al., 2016) , EDL933ΔnanS, and EDL933ΔnanSΔnanS-p1a-p7 for 24 h in growth medium containing BSM with or without BTSA-His. Despite an expected trend of the OD 600 values, which decreased from 0.88, 0.8 to 0.76 for EDL933, EDL933ΔnanS and EDL933ΔnanSΔnanS-p1a-p7, respectively, the differences were not statistically significant (Fig. 7) . However, if BTSA-His was added to the medium, significant differences in the OD 600 between EDL933ΔnanSΔnanS-p1a-p7 and EDL933 or EDL933ΔnanS was detected with values of 0.91, 1.32 or 1.24, respectively (Fig. 5) . For all strains, an increased OD 600 was observed when BTSA-His was added, compared to the cultivation without BTSA-His. An explanation for this phenomenon is that both, Neu5Ac and Neu5,9Ac 2 , terminally bound to the mucin, were released by BTSA-His, whereby the degradation of Neu5Ac was unaffected by the deletions. Thus, Neu5,9Ac 2 may be additionally utilized by EDL933 or EDL933ΔnanS. As a control a culture of EDL933ΔnanSΔnanS-p1a-p7 was supplemented with NanS-p4-His, resulting in an OD 600 comparable to that of a wildtype EDL933 culture. The results of this study showed for the first time, that NanS-p Oacetylesterases are active in a mucin environment and can de-O- Fig. 4 . nanoESI mass spectra of sialic acids obtained from digests of BSM treated with BTSA-His alone (A), BTSA-His combined with NanS-His (B), and BTSA-His combined with NanS-p1-His (C). The nanoESI MS analysis revealed ions which could be assigned to Neu5Ac(OAc) and Neu5Gc(OAc) only in the digests when using BTSA-His alone (A), whereas the combined digests (B and C) solely revealed the Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc cores.
