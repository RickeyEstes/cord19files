As demonstrated in Ref. [9] , the move-length distribution of agents' mobility in the hierarchical geographical network obeys the power-law-like form PðdÞ $ d Àb . Fig. 2 (a) shows that when the value of w increases from 1.0 to 2.0, the powerlaw exponent, b, monotonically decreases from 2.0 to 0.74, which is in agreement with a whole range of empirical observations on human mobility patterns [3] [4] [5] . We also see that after a sufficient number of iterations, the majority of agents resides in higher-layer cities, which again depends on the value of the parameter w. Thus, as w increases, the long-range jumps to higher-layer cities become more frequent ( Fig. 2(b) ). Interestingly enough, we observe that intervals between the two consecutive contacts established among pairs of agents in our model also obey a power-law-like distribution with an almost unchangeable exponent À1:35 and slight fluctuations Hierarchical structure of the geographical network used in the presented study (K ¼ 9 and L ¼ 3), (a) shows the 3-dimensional representation of the planar hierarchical organization and the edges between the cities in different layers, (b) and (c) display the full-connected structure in the two sub-graphs of the network, (d) shows the corresponding distribution of cities in different layers of the network on the plane. The blue, red, and green circles are the cities in the 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-layer, respectively. The blue and light pink arrows denote the corresponding parts in different panels. The single topmost node is the first or highest layer, n ¼ 1. The black arrows show the possible movements of an agent. The panel (e) zooms in an individual node, showing an invasion of an infector (blue agent) and the local spreading within a city, whereas the grey arrow denotes the interaction and contagion spreading between the infector and a previously healthy agent (now infected). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure caption, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) ( Fig. 2(c) ). This observation is very close to the temporal properties of natural, real-world social contacts [25] that are clearly different from the behaviors generated by a traditional Lévy-walk system [26, 27] . As in an SI model, the spreading velocity is represented by the growth of the total infection rate RðtÞ ¼ M I ðtÞ=M and the rate of new infected cases IðtÞ ¼ RðtÞ À Rðt À 1Þ, where M I ðtÞ is the number of infectors at time step t. As shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (b), the spreading velocity is monotonically accelerated with the increasing value of the layer-dependent weight w. When the ratio of layer-dependent weight w is held constant (Fig. 3(d) and (e)), we find that the contagion spreads first from its source location to the closest higher-layer city (directly linked to the contagion source), and then diffuses to the surrounding same-layer cities of the initially affected higher-layer city via available long-range links. Cities in the lower layers of the network are the last ones to become infected. These results suggest that higher-layer cities are at a higher risk for fastgrowing epidemic, and long-range travelers may play the crucial role in this spreading process. Moreover, it is certainly not by chance that hub-like nodes with great infectivity in epidemic contact networks are actually dubbed the superspreaders in the epidemiological literature [28] . The layer-by-layer spreading observed in our simulations implies that the spreading process in the hierarchical network is sensitive to the source location of the epidemic onset. Setting the first infector as static in an L 0 -th layer city at t ¼ 0, as shown in Fig. 3 (f) and (g), the disease transmission becomes faster when the source is located in higher-layer cities (i.e. when L 0 is small), and especially at larger w. This confirms previous findings suggesting that it is of utmost importance to set the disease monitoring focus on the big cities and transport hubs with greater attraction for long-range travelers. To compare the dynamics of disease transmission emerging on our hierarchical geographical network with that generated by the Lévy flight model, we additionally simulated the spreading process with Lévy-walking agents in same-sized, 81 Â 81 lattices. To enable comparison, the move-length distribution originating from the Levy-flight model was the same as the one found in the hierarchical network structure (see Appendix A for details). However, relative to the hierarchical network scenario, the movements of agents in the Lévy-flight scenario were not limited to those along the edges and contact intervals did not show scaling properties. As depicted in Fig. 4 (a) and (b), the spreading velocity in the hierarchical network structure is somewhat slower than that observed in the scenario with the Lévy-flight model (when w is close to 1:0). When the value of w > 1, the growth rate of infections in the hierarchical structure is higher in the early stages of the spreading process (relative to the scenario with Lévy-flight agents), but slower in the later stages, such that the overall relaxation time from the start of the epidemic to the full-infected state is longer than that found in the Lévy-flight model, as illustrated in Fig. 4 (c) and (d).
