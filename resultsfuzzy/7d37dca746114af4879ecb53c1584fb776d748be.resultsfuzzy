Testing results for the veterinary medicine samples collected throughout Korea between 2006 and 2016 are shown in Table 2 . A total of 18,213 samples, comprising 9504 antibiotics, 8137 OCD, and 572 biologics, were tested, among which a total of 358 samples were found to be noncompliant (average noncompliance rate of 2.0%). The number of noncompliant samples found in different drug groups are antibiotics 103 (1.1%), OCD 248 (3.0%), and biologics 7 (1.2%). The average noncompliance rate by year steadily decreased over the 10 years (Fig. 2) . Reasons for noncompliance in collected and tested veterinary medicines Table 3 outlines the causes for noncompliance in veterinary medicines collected and tested between 2006 and 2016. From a total of 358 cases, 283 (79.1%) and 60 (16.8%) cases were deemed noncompliant owing to "insufficiency of major ingredient quantity" and "excess of major ingredient quantity", respectively. Moreover, 3 (0.8%), 4 (1.1%), 3 (0.8%), and 5 (1.4%) cases were marked as "inadequate pH," "abnormal characteristics," "violation of marking standards," and "others", respectively. Noncompliance rate by active ingredient in collected and tested veterinary medicines Table 4 shows the noncompliance rates for individual compounds in veterinary medicines collected and tested between 2006 and 2016. For antibiotics, the highest number of noncompliant cases (n = 86) were found concerning macrolide drugs, such as tylosin, spiramycin, and erythromycin, followed by 55 cases concerning beta-lactams, such as ampicillin, amoxicillin, and penicillin, and 22 cases concerning tetracyclines. For OCD, the ingredients found to be noncompliant included vitamin A (n = 59), probiotics (n = 9), and topically applied products such as pet shampoos (n = 15), disinfectants (n = 8), and glucocorticoids (n = 10). For biologics, bovine rota-coronavirus live mixed vaccine, canine parvo and coronavirus live mixed vaccines,
