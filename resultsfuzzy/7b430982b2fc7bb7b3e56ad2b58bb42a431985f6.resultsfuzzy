As shown in Fig 2 (A) , nebulization and thermal drying produced natural-product nanoparticles with a wide size distribution, ranging from a few to several hundred nanometers in diameter. The distribution is best represented by a monomodal curve with a peak diameter of 75.16 nm, a geometric mean diameter (GMD) of 75.82 nm, and geometric standard deviation (GMD) of 1.217. The particles generated from methanol showed a broad size distribution, and compared to size distribution and concentration of natural-product nanoparticles, the particles generated from methanol were trivial (<3%). The deposition efficiency of these particles is shown in Fig 2 (B) . More than 98% of particles with diameters less than 43 nm and greater than 277 nm were deposited onto the control filter. The deposition efficiency of particles between 43 and 277 nm was lower. The lowest deposition efficiency on the control filter was 85.3% for particles 92 nm in diameter. The relatively low deposition efficiency observed for particles between 43 and 277 nm results from the mechanism of particle filtration. Particles with midrange diameters were too large for diffusion filtration and too small for impaction and interception mechanisms [1] . SEM micrographs show spherical and polydisperse naturalproduct nanoparticles on the filter fibers (Fig 2 (B) ). The quantity of deposited material was determined by weighing the filters before and after particle deposition using a microbalance (Mettler MT5; Mettler-Toledo International, Inc., Seoul, Republic of Korea). The weight of the particles deposited on the filter surface ranged from~590 to 1150 μg/cm 2 filter (590, 855, and 1150 μg/cm 2 filter correspond to deposition times of 3, 6, and 9 min, respectively). Fig 3 shows that pressure drop across the filter increased linearly from 1.1 to 13.4 mmH 2 O as the quantity of deposited nanoparticles increased (y = 1.37x + 1.94, r 2 = 0.9857, p <0.05) [60] . Filtration efficiencies were tested using S. epidermidis and M. luteus aerosols. As shown in Table 1 , the test bacteria concentrations were~278 (S. epidermidis) and~234 particle/cm 3 (M. luteus), respectively. The distribution of the S. epidermidis aerosol was a monomodal curve with a peak diameter of~0.84 μm, a GMD of~0.81 μm, and a GSD of~1.22 (S1 Fig, Table 1 ). Although the shape of size distribution curve of the M. luteus aerosol was similar to that of S. epidermidis aerosol, the M. luteus particles were larger than those of S. epidermidis (S1 Fig). No statistically significant difference was observed between the filtration efficiencies of filters that had been coated for 3 and 9 min (p >0.05). However, because of the dissimilar size distributions of the two bacterial aerosols, filtration efficiencies of the two species were slightly different (p <0.05):~97% for S. epidermidis and 95% for M. luteus. Also, note that flat panel-type filters were used in these tests to estimate the effects of natural-product nanoparticles. Real-world applications would typically employ folded filters to increase the filtration area and decrease the pressure drop. As shown in Fig 4, the inactivation efficiencies of antimicrobial filters increased for both bacteria with increasing nanoparticle deposition time (M. luteus: r 2 = 0.9612, S. epidermidis: r 2 = 0.9959, p <0.05). Approximately 61, 73, and 82% of the M. luteus aerosols were inactivated on filters that had been coated for 3, 6 and 9 min, respectively, while the corresponding values were~78,~88, and~94% with S. epidermidis. M. luteus was more resistant to the E. japonica extract than S. epidermidis under all conditions (p <0.05), with a maximum difference of 17%. Although both M. luteus and S. epidermidis are Gram-positive bacteria, M. luteus is more suited to survive in extreme and/or nutrient-poor environments over extended periods of time [61] . Similarly, in extreme environments, Micrococcus strains have been shown to exhibit greater resistance to novobiocin than Staphylococcus strains [62] . The major chemical constituents of E. japonica extract were investigated using HPLC. The results showed that the chromatogram detected at 280 nm contains three major peaks To assess the toxicity of E. japonica, in vitro cytotoxicity tests were conducted using EZ-Cytox cell viability assay kits, the results of which were compared with those of SNCs, which are known to produce genotoxic effects in cells. The SNC used in this study is classified as a human carcinogen by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) and Beraterkreis Toxikologie in Germany [68] although it is a weaker carcinogen than other, insoluble nickel compounds. Fig 5 shows the concentration of E. japonica and SNC required to attain 50% inhibition of A549 cancer cells and HEL 299 cells. For both cell types, the inhibitory concentration of E. japonica was statistically confirmed to be higher than that of the SNC following 48-h exposures (p <0.05). The required E. japonica concentrations were 137 and 256 μg/mL, >57% higher than those of the SNC. In addition, the antimicrobial activities of E. japonica and the SNC were casually evaluated using the disk diffusion method. Approximately 50 mg of E. japonica extract and SNC powders were dissolved in 1 mL of DMSO and distilled water, respectively, and 10 μL of each suspension was used to soak Whatman filter papers (11-mm diameter; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Fig 6 shows the results against S. aureus, Enterococcus hirae, M. luteus, and S. epidermidis. The antimicrobial activities of E. japonica were similar to those of the SNC against E. hirae and M. luteus (p >0.05), while it was considerably more effective against S. aureus and S. epidermidis with inhibition zones extending to more than twice the radius of those of the SNC (p <0.01) The results in Figs 5 and 6 confirm that E. japonica is less toxic and exhibits stronger antimicrobial activity on some bacteria than the SNC.
