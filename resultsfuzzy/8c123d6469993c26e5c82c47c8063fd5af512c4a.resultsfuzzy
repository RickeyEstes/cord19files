The appropriate feeder cell line was X-irradiated at 2000-4000 R and then diluted with sufficient fresh culture medium and FCS to yield 5 Ã— 105 cells/ml in medium supplemented with 20% FCS (thus the medium was partly pre-conditioned by feeder cells). The cells to be cloned were then added in a minimal volume of culture medium and 200 ~tl aliquots of the resulting cell suspension were seeded into flat-bottomed, 96 well plates (Nunc). At 2-week intervals, 50% of the medium in the wells was exchanged for fresh culture medium. In some cases, an additional 105 Xirradiated feeder cells were added to each well at the first medium change. Antibody-producing LCLs were routinely established from primary cultures seeded at the equivalent of one or ten cells/well. Anti-malaria antibody-secreting LCLs were transferred to 1 ml culture medium in a well of a 24 well plate (Linbro) and expanded, by a two-fold dilution of the cell suspension, once or twice weekly. Once LCLs had been expanded to 4 ml or beyond, they were recloned. Established clones were maintained by two-fold dilution every 3-4 days.
