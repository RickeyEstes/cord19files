BPIV-3 can vary considerably, ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe respiratory illness. In the implicated infection cases, mild clinical signs were characterized by coughing, fever, and nasal discharge. Mixed infections with two or more infectious agents can cause more severe clinical presentation and production losses, due to the immunosuppression and severe bronchopneumonia from secondary bacterial infections. To investigate the potential infectious pathogens causing coughing and nasal discharge, BVDV, BPIV3, BHV-1, and BRSV were detected by PCR. The results of PCR are summarized in Figure 1 . Three nasal swab samples were positive for BPIV3. These three samples positive for BPIV3 were used for virus isolation. The samples were filtrated through a 0.22 µm filter and inoculated to monolayer culture MDBK cells. The cells were cultivated three times with five-day intervals. Cell cultures (third passage) were frozen and thawed three times before inoculating MDBK cells. MDBK cells inoculated with the virus produced typical cytopathic effects characterized by rounding, shrinkage, and cracking off ( Figure 2 ). The successfully isolated BPIV3 stain was named BPIV3-BJ. The median of viral tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of the third passage was determined in MDBK cells. The titer of BPIV3-BJ was up to 10-9.5/0.1 mL. The high titer of BPIV3-BJ on MDBK indicated that the virus has a good growth performance in MDBK cells. The whole genome of BPIV3-BJ was assembled using SeqMan. The genomic annotation was performed according to the blastx search. The complete genomic length of BPIV3-BJ was 15,480 bp with 36.1% GC content. The percentage of nucleotide sequence similarities was assessed with these BPIV3 strains for which complete genomic sequences were available in GenBank. BPIV3-BJ showed a low nucleotide similarity to BPIV3 strains located in genotype B (83%-83.6%) and genotype C (81.7%-82.1%). It shared a higher nucleotide identity with isolates located in genotype A. In total, 99% of nucleotide identity was observed between BPIV3-BJ and 910N (Genbank number: D84095). The virus isolated in this study showed a lower nucleotide identity with Chinese BPIV3 strains.  BPIV-3 can vary considerably, ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe respiratory illness.

The virus isolated in this study showed a lower nucleotide identity with Chinese BPIV3 strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that BPIV3-BJ (opened diamond in Figure 3 ) is located within the clade composed of BPIV3 isolates of the genotype A. This clade (clade A) includes the strain 910N isolated in Japan in 1987 (filled diamond in Figure 3 ) and the divergent strain NM09 (Genbank number: JQ063064) recently isolated in China. The tree also indicates the position of the isolate SD0835 (opened circle in Figure 1 ) in the cluster of genotype C. It is important to mention that all clades of genotype A include the BPIV3 strain from the USA and some of these American strains were isolated before the 1990s. In addition, regardless of the date, the American strains were isolated, they are located at the base of the clades. These facts suggest that the global dissemination of BPIV3 of genotype A is continuously spread from American strains to other countries. We also estimated genetic distances within each clade (values within rectangles in Figure 3 ) to show that the amino acid diversity among isolates of clade A (0.068 ± 0.002) is higher than that of clade B (0.043 ± 0.001) and clade C (0.017 ± 0.001).

The differences in the nucleocapsid (NP) protein among some strains are summarized in Table 1 . Since the NP protein has been implicated in immunization studies, it is important to determine the extent of differences between BPIV3-BJ and other strains. The comparison of BPIV3-BJ and the Chinese isolate NM09 showed that these strains are highly divergent. Although there are few BPIV3 complete genomes available, the genetic divergence of strains of genotype A suggests that this genotype is continuously disseminated in distinct countries. Our study showed that the diversity of genotype A strains in China was likely affected by incoming strains from the USA. Because China imports large amounts of beef resources from the USA and the European Union, it is quite reasonable that this trade has impacted the spread of BPIV3 of genotype A to the region. Furthermore, there are also some levels of imported or smuggled live cattle from abroad and this will certainly have had a direct impact on the maintenance of distinct BPIV3 strains in China. To better address the dynamics of BPIV3 in China, and the pathways and impact of animal trade, a very extensive survey on local herds and shipments coming from other countries should be conducted. Phylogenetic tree constructed using 24 genomic sequences of BPIV3. The tree was inferred using a maximum composite likelihood (MCL) approach assuming the HKY model plus a discrete Gamma correction and the rate of invariable sites. Values above branches indicate bootstrap support after 500 replications. The BIPV3 strain in this work is indicated by an open rectangle in the tree. Numbers within each gray rectangle are the genetic distances and standard errors of strains of each genotype (i.e., genotype A, B, and C). Phylogenetic analyses and estimation of genetic distances were conducted using MEGAX software. The differences in the nucleocapsid (NP) protein among some strains are summarized in Table  1 .

In summary, we have described the isolation and genomic sequencing of BPIV3 genotype A strains isolated from cattle in China. Our isolate is highly divergent from the previously described isolate from China, NM09. The BPIV3 genotype A infection has been infecting livestock animals in China and causing enormous economic loss to the cattle industry. For this reason, the isolation and genomic characterization of our divergent BPIV3 genotype A strain will help the development of molecular diagnostic tools and vaccine studies.
