Although we observed fewer transitions to detect detailed patterns of transmission with viruses other than HRV, we found evidence for intrahousehold transmission for coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, influenza, and bocavirus, and reduced susceptibility with older age in paramyxoviruses, influenza, and bocavirus. We detect a reduced rate of loss of coronaviruses in hosts infected with HRV and of bocavirus in male hosts, small households, and in households with a high frequency of concurrent infections (Table 4 ). Simulations of HRV infection are based on regressions simplified in four ways: (1) we do not include the association with symptoms, which depend on infection status in a complex way, (2) we do not include the interaction with coronavirus which have their own dynamics, (3) we do not include the relatively small association with the youngest household member, and (4) we break age into age groups to provide easier comparison with census data. Using the ages and household sizes in the BIG-LoVE cohort, the simulation accurately reproduces HRV prevalence over time (Fig 3a) , higher prevalence in larger households (Fig 3b) , and lower prevalence with older hosts (Fig 3c) . However, if we fit the number of individuals infected in each household with the beta-binomial distribution (package bbmle in R [54] ), the values of the parameter θ in the simulation are consistently larger than those from the data. Larger values of θ produce a distribution closer to a binomial distribution where individuals have equal and independent probabilities of testing positive, indicating that the factors included in the simulation do not capture the full range of heterogeneity (Fig 3d) . We use the model to quantify sensitivity to four model components: age-dependent susceptibility, intrahousehold transmission, interhousehold transmission, and intrahousehold reinfection. Linear regressions quantified the effects of model components on overall mean prevalence and the slope of prevalence as a function of household size (Table 5) . Excluding the age-dependent susceptibility reduces population prevalence by 3.6% and setting intrahousehold transmission to zero reduces population prevalence by 4.0%. Simplifying age-dependent interhousehold transmission reduces population prevalence substantially (about 5% when the age-dependence is not included or when intrahousehold transmission is absorbed into the intercept), and setting the coefficient to zero reduces population prevalence Table 4
