We reasoned that exploring glycan-binding profiles of broadly virus-neutralizing agents may provide key information to uncover the carbohydrate-based viral neutralization epitopes. In the first set of the experiments, we verified that the preparations of GNA or 2G12 we utilized recognize corresponding epitopes presented by the native viral antigens. Subsequently, we performed a comparative carbohydrate microarray analysis to characterize the glycan-binding profiles of 2G12 and GNA and to pinpoint specific glyco-epitopes they recognize.
