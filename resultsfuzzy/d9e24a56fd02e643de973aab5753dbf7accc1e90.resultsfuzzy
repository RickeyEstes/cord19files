A flow diagram of discrepant analysis is described in Figure 1 . In summary, 167 samples (83.1%) with positive results from at least two RV assays or negative results from all three assays were not tested with the additional assay. However, the other 34 samples (16.9%), containing 36 discordant results showing a single positive result in any assay, were tested with the following additional assay. A single positive result from AP and RQ assay was retested individually with RV assay. Whereas a single positive result from AD assay was performed with monoplex PCR followed by direct sequencing. If the results between the original and additional tests were concordant, they were considered to be a consensus of positive results. Conversely, if the results between original and additional tests showed a discordance, they were considered to be a negative consensus. Because both AD and RQ assay cannot detect PIV4 and EV, the results about PIV4 and EV were excluded from the discrepant analysis. Statistical analysis using percent agreement between RV assays in each virus type were high, ranging from 94% to 100%. Overall agreement between three RV assays ranged from 97% to 98%. Overall distribution of respiratory viruses from 3 RV assays is presented in Table 4 . There are indications of the predominance of INFA, ADV, HRV, and MPV. Excluding these four major types, the rest of RV types accounted for only 0.8% to 8.9% of total viruses identified.
