The results indicate that the efficacy of VOR against Candida albicans and C. neoformans was not antagonised by AMB or 5-FC in vitro. Furthermore, in guinea pig models of systemic candidiasis and intracranial cryptococcosis, no antagonism was observed between the lower doses of VOR and either AMB or 5-FC on the basis of reductions in tissue fungal loads. At the highest doses of VOR, both AMB and 5-FC showed some antagonism, but the combinations were still effective in significantly reducing fungal tissue loads compared with vehicle-treated control animals. Conclusion: These results suggest that VOR may be used in combination with standard antifungal agents, and future studies to elucidate the clinical potential of VOR combination therapies in the management of Candida and Cryptococcus infections are warranted.
