The data from the 12 included studies were charted according to their author(s), years, locations, methodologies and domains of competencies. The data relevant to the objectives of this scoping review are shown in Table 3 . The number of domains varied across the selected studies. The first study, conducted by Gebbie and Qureshi [13] , identified 11 competency domains in which nurses must be educated and trained. In 2003, the International Nursing Coalition for Mass Casualty Education (INCMCE) developed the core competencies for registered nurses and students. These competencies include 10 domains, the following 4 of which are main core competencies: critical thinking, assessment, technical skills and communication skills. The other six are associated with core knowledge [30] . In 2004, eight dimensions of emergency preparedness competencies were developed by Wisniewski et al. [37] based on previous research conducted at Vanderbilt University and by the ICNMCE. These competencies are important for all healthcare workers, particularly nurses; however, their study focused only on the response and preparedness phases and did not include other important phases, such as mitigation and recovery. In 2005, Markenson et al. [23] identified 22 domains of core competencies: 8 for principal management, 5 for terrorism, 2 for public health and 7 for patient care. Hsu et al. [15] used a systematic consensus to identify the fundamental knowledge and skills required for disaster nursing. Their study consisted of the following five stages: a literature review, a structure review, synthesis, refinement and the development of objectives. Valid contributions were provided regarding seven important domains of the competencies of healthcare providers. Surprisingly, among the seven core competency domains, no themes were generated for several of the important domains [15] study were measured, as they seem broad and were not determined based on specific objectives. In 2008, three studies were conducted in the United States to explore the core competencies of disaster nursing [26, 11, 31] . Each study contributed to the body of knowledge on disaster nursing by organising the competencies in each phase of disaster management. Polivka et al. [26] identified a total of 25 competencies (10 for disaster preparedness, 8 for response and 7 for recovery). Everly et al. [11] identified five domains of core competencies, while Subbarao et al. [31] identified seven domains, including planning, communication and ethics. Although there were differences in the number of domains in the three studies, they found similar domains, such as planning, communication and the Incident Command System (ICS). However, serious doubts have been raised regarding how the competencies in all of these studies are to be measured. A study was conducted by the ICN and WHO in 2009 that differed from previous studies in several respects. The study reviewed two documents created by Stanley [30] and Yamamoto [38] to develop the core competencies of disaster nursing. The ICN helped explain the importance of disaster management for nurses and identified the knowledge, skills and abilities that nurses must have in each phase of a disaster (i.e., mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery). Approximately 130 core competencies were identified across 10 domains. As such, the study helped develop disaster nursing core competencies and tested the levels of nurses' competencies. This is understood to be the only framework that has been developed for determining the core competencies of disaster nursing. However, the focus of this study was on general nurses; thus, the core competencies for emergency nurses were not understood completely. There has been a gradual development in the core competencies of healthcare providers, particularly nurses. Researchers have developed many core competencies based on specific objectives [29, 35] . For instance, Walsh et al. [35] outlined the core competencies as having 11 domains, along with 37 sub-competencies. Although considerable progress was made in their study, concerns regarding the core competencies in triage, transportation and psychological issues remained unexplored. However, a solution was proposed by Schultz et al. [29] , who identified 19 core competencies and more than 90 objectives. In doing so, they contributed to knowledge regarding disaster management for all healthcare providers (i.e., physicians, nurses and emergency management staff), both inside and outside of hospitals. The last study used a different methodology, as emergency nurses in Brazil were interviewed about the domains of the core competencies of disaster management; as a result, five domains were identified with a total of 17 competencies focused mainly on preparedness and response [22] . While several competency sets have been designed, no unified standards have been formulated; therefore, the sets are inconsistent and have yet to be validated empirically. The structures of these core competencies differ across previous studies; however, the most common domains that were found across the selected studies include knowledge related to the following: (1) communication, (2) planning, (3) decontamination and safety, (4) ICS and (5) ethics. Each competency is a key component of disaster preparedness and response.
