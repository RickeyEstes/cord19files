Two variants located in the CD209 promoter region (À871 A/G and À336 A/G) exhibited a frequency distribution significantly distorted between TB patients and controls, as indicated by a Chi-square test (Table 1) . For the À871 variant, genotypes GG and GA were less frequently observed in cases (16.8%) compared to the control group (27.2%) (p ¼ 8.2 3 10 À4 ). For the À336 variant, genotypes GG and GA were more frequent in cases (70.6%) than in controls (61.9%) (p ¼ 0.01). These observations suggest that the alleles À871A (odds ratio [OR]: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.29-2.66) and À336G (OR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.08-2.02) increase the risk of developing TB in our South African cohort. At the haplotype level (Table 2) , a Chi-square test first revealed that the global distribution of haplotype frequencies was significantly different between cases and controls (p ¼ 1.2 3 10 À3 ). One haplotype (H3) turned out to be the main haplotype responsible for such a distorted frequency distribution ( Table 2 ). This haplotype, which contains both À871G and À336A, was found to be strongly associated with the control group (p ¼ 1.6 3 10 À3 ; OR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.22-2.38). The associations with this haplotype, and with À871, remained highly significant (p ¼ 1.3 3 10 À2 and 6.6 3 10 À3 respectively), even after the conservative Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Although our cohort is considered a present-day homogeneous community that has received genetic contribution from different populations multiple generations ago [31, 32] , population stratification between cases and controls can be a confounding factor leading to a spurious positive association. Indeed, the use of admixed populations in associationmapping studies can be very useful to identify disease-causing genetic variants that differ in frequency across parental populations. However, when the admixture event is too recent, allelic frequencies can differ coincidentally among cases and controls, reflecting a nonuniform genetic contribution from the parental populations to each subpopulation (i.e., cases and controls), rather than a genuine association between a given genetic variant and the phenotype under study. In this case, the study-cohort is said to present population stratification. To formally test and quantify the levels of background genetic differences [38] , if any, between cases and controls, we genotyped the entire cohort for a panel of 25 independent SNPs markers which are (1) not in linkage disequilibrium with the candidate CD209 locus and with any other known gene, (2) randomly distributed along the genome, and (3) polymorphic among the major ethnic groups ( Table 3 ). The mean v 2 statistic among the 25 SNPs for the comparison of allele frequencies between cases and controls, which represents the levels of stratification (l) between the two groups [39] , was 1.25 (p ¼ 0.26), implying that the two groups were not significantly stratified. As an additional correction for stratification, we divided the v 2 values obtained for our candidate gene CD209 by the level of stratification detected (1.25) [39] . Even after such a conservative correction, the associations observed with À336 and À871 as well as with H3 remained significant (À336 p ¼ 2.8 3 10 À2 ; À871 p ¼ 2.7 3 10 À3 ; H3 p ¼ 4.8 3 10 À3 ). These observations support therefore the idea that the À871G and À336A variants are indeed genuinely associated with a protective role against TB. In order to gain insights into the frequency distribution of these two SNPs, we genotyped them in 254 human chromosomes from sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and East Asia as well as in eight chimpanzee chromosomes. We observed that the À871G and À336A forms, which we propose as offering protection against TB, corresponded to the derived allele in humans; we also observed that these forms are present at higher frequencies in Eurasians as compared to Africans (Table 4) . Indeed, the À871G is absent in African populations whereas it reaches high frequencies (20%-40%) in European and Asian populations. Given the absence of the haplotypic combination of À871G and À336A among sub-Saharan Africans, its presence among South African Coloureds suggests that it was introduced through the historically wellknown admixture with Europeans and Asians [31] . This observation highlights the power of using admixed populations to better understand historical issues associated with the geographic/ethnic origin of disease-affecting alleles, provided that their prevalence varies in the ancestors of the admixed population (i.e., different frequency of H3 in Africans versus non-Africans; Table 4 ). In the context of TB, it has been suggested that present-day susceptibility to TB is determined by previous history of exposure [40] . There is fairly convincing evidence that TB has been endemic in Europe for several hundred years, whereas in Africa it has probably been rare before contact was initiated with Europeans [41] [42] [43] . It is expected therefore that M. tuberculosis has exerted stronger selective pressures on European than African populations [42] . Our results lend support to this hypothesis and suggest that the protective alleles À871G and À336A increased in frequency in non-African populations as a result of genetic adaptation to a longer period of TB exposure. The potential impact of tuberculosis on the frequency of resistant alleles in European populations has been recently addressed using epidemiological data and statistical modeling [44] . The authors have sought to evaluate the expected changes in resistant allele frequencies, during the 300-y period corresponding to the peak epidemics of TB in Europe. They concluded that if a given resistant allele was at a low frequency in the beginning of an epidemic, selection by M. tuberculosis alone would increase the frequency of this allele, but not enough to bring it to epidemiologically significant levels. In this context, since DC-SIGN is known to interact with a vast range of pathogens, it is indeed likely that the increased frequencies observed today for both À871G and À336A in non-African populations (specially for À871G which is absent in sub-Saharan Africans) may have been driven, not only by the selective pressures imposed by M. tuberculosis, but also by other infectious agents. Indeed, two independent studies have recently reported a genetic association between the À336A variant and protection against parenteral HIV infection [45] and severity of dengue pathogenesis [46] . Although HIV infection, for example, is too recent to have left any signature of selection on CD209, these observations emphasize the possible action of other pathogens in shaping the patterns of variability of this gene. From a functional point of view, the À336A allele has been shown to affect an Sp1-like binding site and to modulate transcriptional activity in vitro by increasing the levels of expression [46] . In the context of TB, increased DC-SIGN expression levels by DCs may result in better capture and processing of mycobacterial antigens, leading to a stronger and wider T-cell response. In addition, we have recently shown that DC-SIGN expression is markedly induced in alveolar macrophages in active TB patients and that M. tuberculosis is preferentially phagocytosed by DC-SIGNexpressing macrophages in these individuals [47] . Thus, the higher prevalence observed among healthy individuals of the À336A variant, which is associated with increased DC-SIGN expression, may underlie an increased efficiency of host phagocytes, such as DCs and macrophages, to control the infection. In addition to the À336A variant, our genetic data showed a strong association of the À871G allele with healthy controls, suggesting also a functional consequence of this variant that, either alone or in combination with À336A, remains to be defined. In conclusion, the significant association found for the CD209 promoter variants together with their phylogenetic status and frequency distribution strongly suggests that the À871G andÀ336A alleles may reduce the risk of developing TB. More generally, our results, together with those reporting association of CD209 promoter variants with both HIV susceptibility and dengue pathogenesis [45, 46] suggest that variation in this lectin may be of crucial importance in the outcome of a number of infections due to DC-SIGN-interacting pathogens. Detailed in vitro and in vivo studies assessing the functional consequences of CD209 variants on the quality of the host immune response against pathogens, including M. tuberculosis, are now required to eventually develop knowledgebased and effective pathway-targeted treatments.
