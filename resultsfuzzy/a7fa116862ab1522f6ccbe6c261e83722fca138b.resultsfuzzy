Spatial distributions of infection risks Fig 3B, 3D , 3F and 3H) shows average infection risk distributions of 1,000 simulations at the end of the exposure period via the long-range airborne route and fomite route (Patterns 1, 3 and 5), respectively. Correspondingly, Figure D (iv, vi and viii) in S1 File shows those of the fomite route (Patterns 2, 4 and 6). For fair comparison, the parameters were set to be the same for the aforesaid distributions (Fig 3B, 3D , 3F and 3H and Figure D (iv, vi and viii) in S1 File). For the long-range airborne route, the spatial distribution of infection risk (Fig 3B) was similar to that of the reported attack rates (Fig 3A) , i.e., highest in the source cubicle, lower in the adjacent cubicle and lowest in the remote cubicles. Virus-containing airborne droplets were generated by the index patient in the source cubicle, leading to the highest virus concentration in the air in the source cubicle (Figure C in S1 File) and thus the highest infection risk (Fig 3B) . Due to the small temperature differences between zones, two-way airflow occurred at each inner opening in the ward [35] , so some virus-containing airborne droplets spread to other cubicles by airflow. As the remote cubicles were farther away from the source than the adjacent cubicle was, the airborne droplet concentrations in the former were further diluted than that in the latter (Figure C in S1 File), leading to lower infection risk (Fig 3B) . With the high mechanical ventilation rates in Ward 8A, the results from both CFD simulations [20] and multi-zone modelling methods ( [35] and Figure C in S1 File) show that the aerosol concentration in the source cubicle was much higher than that in the adjacent cubicle. Therefore, the difference between infection risks (Fig 3B) in the source and adjacent cubicles was very large (1:0.43 in this scenario), which was inconsistent with the small difference (1:0.80) in the reported attack rate distribution (Fig 3A) . Although several studies showed the very probable evidences for the airborne transmission of SARS such as in the Amoy Gardens outbreak [19] , the inconsistence suggests that the outbreak might not merely be induced by the long-range airborne route. For the fomite route, on the whole, the infection risk distributions were influenced by HCWs' hands and common environmental surfaces, which were important mediums to transfer viruses from the index patient to other inpatients. As HCWs' hands usually contact patients in a certain sequence, viruses received by normal inpatients vary with their positions in the ward. In Fig 3D, 3F and 3H and Figure D (iv, vi and viii) in S1 File, the infection risk always reaches its highest value in inpatients visited by HCWs after the index patient, and then decreases in the direction of the HCWs' routine rounds. However, inpatients had the same opportunities to contact common surfaces, such as common toilets in Ward 8A, so common surfaces reduced the difference between viruses received by each inpatient from HCWs and contributed to a uniform infection risk distribution. Except for a few visited by HCWs after the index patient, the inpatients share a similar infection risk of 0.07. For the six routine round patterns considered here, infection risk distributions vary. In Patterns 1 and 2 ( Fig 3D and Figure D (iv) in S1 File), as more HCWs examined each patient in a routine round, the transmission of viruses was enhanced and the infection risks were generally higher than those in other patterns (Fig 3F and 3H and Figure D(vi and viii) in S1 File). In Patterns 3 and 4 ( Fig 3F and Figure D(vi) in S1 File), as different groups of HCWs were responsible for different cubicles, HCWs did not transmit viruses across cubicles, and thus the infection risks for inpatients in the adjacent cubicle and remote cubicles were nearly the same. In Patterns 5 and 6 ( Fig 3H and Figure D(viii) in S1 File), the inpatient subsequently visited by HCWs after the index patient was not necessarily Inpatient 10 or 12. Therefore, although the infection risks still decreased in the direction of routine rounds, the reduction was small compared with other patterns (Fig 3D and 3F and Figure D (iv and vi) in S1 File). Among the six infection risk distributions, only those of Patterns 1 and 5 (Fig 3D and 3H ) were highest in the source cubicle, lower in the adjacent cubicle, and lowest in the remote cubicles, similar to that of the reported attack rates (Fig 3A) . Nevertheless, as for Pattern 1, the difference between infection risks (Fig 3D) in the source and adjacent cubicles was too large (1:0.35 in this scenario) and not consistent with the small difference (1:0.80) in the reported attack rate distribution (Fig 3A) . In contrast, for Pattern 5, the difference between infection risks (Fig 3H) in the source and remote cubicles was too small (1:0.52 in this scenario), not consistent with the large difference (1:0.28) in the reported attack rate distribution (Fig 3A) . respectively. Since the distribution of reported attack rates in this SARS outbreak exhibited a statistically significant pattern (P = 0.0015, Pearson chi-square test), in many scenarios the minimum RSS were larger than 2.5525 (small black dots in Fig 4) , indicating large deviations from the outbreak data. Therefore, these scenarios were regarded as less probable ones.
