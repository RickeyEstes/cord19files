In our experience there is good agreement between using quantitative proteomics to identify interacting partners from pull down-based experiments and subsequent follow on experiments using specific analysis techniques (Emmott et al., 2013; Jourdan et al., 2012a; Wu et al., 2012) . Nevertheless, aspects of the N protein interactome were validated by conducting repeat independent interaction studies of control and experimental systems and probing for specific virus and cellular proteins by western blot. We used two proteins with a lower and higher potential binding ratio; hnRNPA2/B1 (ratio 4) and eIF4 (ratio 45). Both of these proteins interacted with N protein but not UBC9 indicating the potential specificity of the interactions recorded by the LC-MS/MS analysis (Fig. 3A) . One of the unique proteins identified in the current study was Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1), which although normally associated with DNA virus (e.g. (Grady et al., 2012; Ohsaki et al., 2004; Tempera et al., 2010) ) and retrovirus biology (e.g. (Bueno et al., 2013) ) has also been shown to be a positive factor for influenza virus biology (Bortz et al., 2011) . To confirm the interaction between PARP-1 and N protein, independent pulldown assays were performed. Recombinant protein from an empty negative control vector (pTriEx1.1 Neo), MBP-His control bait or recombinant N-His protein were purified using Nickelaffinity beads and incubated with a HEK293T cell lysate. Western blotting was then used to investigate whether PARP-1 was pulled down by the N protein compared to an MBP-His control bait (Fig. 3B) . The data indicated that PARP-1 only associated with the N protein in contrast to the MBP-his control protein or the background matrix.
