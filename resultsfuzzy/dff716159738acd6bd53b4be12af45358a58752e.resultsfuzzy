Identification of Mycoplasma spp. in patients with breast cancer was carried out using primers from the region of the 16S-23S RNA genes. This region includes 16S ribosomal RNA gene, partial sequence; 16S-23S ribosomal RNA intergenic spacer, complete sequence; and 23S ribosomal RNA gene, partial analysis. In this, more detailed analysis we used primers for RNA polymerase beta subunit gene. Figure   1A shows the result of analysis of DNA samples for blood, saliva and tumor tissue of four patients using 16S -23S primers. Figures 1B, 1C and 1D show results of analysis of saliva samples with primers, specific for RNA polymerase gene.

Unfortunately, almost nothing is known about molecular biology of M.faucium, but its properties may be similar to those of other mycoplasmas. For example it is known that mycoplasmas trigger the secretion of cytokines, including IL-1b (interleukin-1b), IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), interferon alpha (IFN-α), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) [5] . However, most of these cytokines are growth factors. This means that when they interact with appropriate receptors, D cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 (cdk 4/6) appear in the cell, which in turn initiate cell division. If the growth factor receptors located on the cell membrane, which are present in breast tissue, it may mean that such cytokines may promote cell division in a mammary gland. At the same time, cell division which is not controlled by the organism is one of the main (if not the main) symptom of cancer. Thereby mycoplasmas theoretically are able to participate in the development of cancer by activating cell division. Data presented in the Table 3 show that some cytokines can participate in the development of cancer. * IL-1β -activates T cells. IL-2 -T-cell growth factor, stimulates IL-1 synthesis, activates B-cells and NK cells. IL-4growth factor for activated B cells, resting T cells, and mast cells. IL-6 -stimulates Ig synthesis, growth factor for plasma cells. TNF-a -a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, TGF-α is a mitogenic polypeptide. GM-CSF -it is a white blood cell growth factor.
