Protein alignments were visualized with the help of ESPript 2.1 [193] . To visualize Bayesian samples of trees, DensiTree.v2.2.1 was used [194] . R was used for visualization [195] . S5 Table) , respectively. Outline of the procedure (see S1 Materials and Methods) is presented on blue background. Iterations of the procedure are designated by Latin numbers on the left. Grey bars represent regions of PSCNV polyprotein that served as HHsearch queries to three profile databases. Basis used to split polyprotein into regions during each iteration is indicated on the right. Locations of clusters of hits with Probability (P) >95% are depicted in dark blue, with numeric indices that reflect their relative position in polyprotein, from the N-to C-terminus. Locations of accepted hits with Probability ï¿½95% are depicted in red, with letter indices that reflect their relative position in polyprotein, from the N-to C-terminus. 4438-4664 aa) . The aligned proteases employ catalytic residues that include as the principal nucleophile either a Cys residue (TGEV, NDiV, GAV) or a Ser residue (BRV, PSCNV). Columns containing TGEV 3CLpro catalytic dyad residues are marked by black stars. TGEV 3CLpro Val84 residue that is spatially equivalent to the catalytic acidic residue of serine proteases is marked with empty circle. Residues of the TGEV 3CLpro substrate-binding pocket are underlined with green bars [87] . Absolutely conserved residues are shown on red background and partially conserved residues in red font. Secondary structure is shown in blue. Residue numbering on top of the alignment refers to TGEV nsp5. (8342-8629 aa) . Columns containing SARS-CoV ExoN catalytic residues and Asp243 residue, essential for nuclease activity, are marked by black stars and circle, respectively. Green and orange triangles mark columns that contain residues of two SARS-CoV ExoN zinc fingers; empty circles indicate columns that contain SARS-CoV ExoN residues interacting with nsp10 (the majority of such residues are not depicted, as they belong to the N-terminal 1-76 aa region of SARS-CoV nsp14) [92] . Absolutely conserved residues are shown on red background and partially conserved residues in red font. Secondary structure is shown in blue. Residue numbering on top of the alignment refers to SARS-CoV nsp14. [98] . Absolutely conserved residues are shown on red background and partially conserved residues in red font. Secondary structure is shown in blue. Residue numbering on top of the alignment refers to SARS-CoV nsp16. (TIF) S15 Fig. Comparison of FN2 domains from human matrix metalloproteinase-2 and PSCNV. Shown is the MSA of the third FN2 domain of human matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) and FN2a (10555-10613 aa) and FN2b (12186-12233 aa) of PSCNV. Pairs of cysteine residues, predicted to form disulfide bridges, are designated by blue bars (first pair) and stars (second pair). Absolutely conserved residues are shown on red background and partially conserved residues in red font. Secondary structures, derived from MMP2 1J7M and predicted for PSCNV domains, is shown in blue. Residue numbering above the alignment refers to the top sequence. (TIF)
