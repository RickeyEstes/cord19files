Flu GFP PCR amplicons were derived from pHW72-EGFP [21] . In order to determine whether a Flu PCR amplicon could be transfected into cells and be amplified by the influenza polymerase complex, a PCR product was produced encoding the GFP reporter gene in negative orientation flanked by the influenza segment 7 untranslated regions (UTRs) and further flanked by the human pol1 promoter and the mouse t1 termination signal, pol1EGFPt1 (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1A , Table S1 ). Co-transfection of the pol1EGFPt1 amplicon along with 4 protein expression plasmids encoding the influenza virus polymerase complex (3P) and NP into 293T cells resulted in efficient amplification of the reporter replicon and detection of green fluorescence signal ( Fig. 2A) . The proportion of green cells observed was comparable to those observed in the positive control cells co-transfected with pHW72-EGFP and the 3P and NP expression plasmids (Fig. 2B) . The fluorescence signal of another amplicon, pol1EGFPutr, which lacks the t1 signal, was present in fewer cells compared to the pol1EGFPt1 amplicon indicating that run off transcription by the RNA pol1 complex may result in vRNA fragments with incorrect and/or incomplete influenza sequences (Fig. 2C ). As expected, no fluorescence signal appeared when cells were transfected with a Flu GFP PCR amplicon lacking the pol1 and t1 elements (UTREGFPutr) (Fig. 2D ) or by removing the PB1 plasmid in cotransfected cells with either PCR amplicons or pHW72-EGFP plasmid ( Fig. 2E and data not shown) . These initial studies were expanded in order to test whether PCR amplicons containing RNA polymerase II (pol2) and polyadenylation sequences flanking an appropriate ORF would result in gene expression (Fig. S1B) . Thus, PCR amplicons of the 3P and NP genes were obtained using a set of primers spanning the cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV) and bovine growth hormone (bgh) polyA elements. Co-transfection of the pol2PB2bgh, pol2PB1bgh, pol2PAbgh, and pol2NPbgh, along with pHW72-EGFP, resulted in efficient reporter replicon expression indicating that PCR amplicons with either pol1 or pol2 transcription elements are appropriately transcribed by the corresponding transcription complexes (Fig. 2F ).
