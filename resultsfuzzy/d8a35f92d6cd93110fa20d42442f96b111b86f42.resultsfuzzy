implicates directly the ligand binding function of the SH3 thymus, and a hemorrhagic malignant pleural effusion that was the cause of death ( Figure 6C) . The same dis-domain in the rescue mechanism. The P1124L SH2-CD linker mutation also restored induction of CML-like ease is induced by p210 Bcr-Abl with a point mutation in the SH2 domain that impairs catalytic activity (Roumi-disease by p210⌬cc although less efficiently ( Figure 6A ). Likewise, mutation at either Pro1013 or Pro1124 re-had myeloproliferative disease with splenomegaly and peripheral blood leukocytosis, but eventually succumbed stored induction of CML-like myeloproliferative disease by p210LZA ( Figure 6B)  Mutation of the homolog of the major autophosphory-tion ( Figure 5G ). The P1124L mutation rescued p210LZA more effectively, with five of seven recipients developing lation site in c-Abl significantly attenuated leukemogenesis by p210 Bcr-Abl, with the majority of recipients of CML-like disease and the remaining two animals developing T-ALL and histiocytic sarcoma (HS), another Bcr-p210Y1294F-transduced marrow developing CML-like disease but only after a significant delay ( Figure 6D ). 


Section:with all circulating cd4/cd8-positive cells (data not shown). similar t-lymphoma occurs in recipients of marrow ex-recipients succumbing within 10 weeks posttransplant with leukocytosis due to maturing myeloid cells, hepato-pressing bcr-abl lacking the entire bcr n terminus or with a point mutation in the grb2 binding site at tyr177 splenomegaly, and pulmonary infiltrates and hemorrhage. these mice had normal lymph nodes and thymus (he et al., 2002; million and van etten, 2000; zhang et al., 2001), and results from transduction of t-lymphoid and no evidence of b-or t-lymphoid malignancy based on histopathological and flow cytometric analysis (data progenitors in the donor bone marrow. recipients of marrow transduced with p210f54p developed rapidly not shown). this result is consistent with the induction of cml-like disease by p210 with deletions in both the fatal acute b-lymphoid leukemia (b-all) characterized by moderate splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, normal coiled-coil and sh3 domains (zhang et al., 2001) and
Section:. two recipients of p210lza/ to t-lymphoma or hs. together, these results argue that oligomerization of bcr-abl via the coiled-coil domain p1013l-transduced marrow succumbed to myeloproliferative disease but with longer latency compared to is required for induction of cml-like myeloproliferative disease in mice, but disruption of the sh3 domain ligand mice receiving either p210-or p210⌬cc/p1013l-transduced marrow, suggesting that the sh3 point mutation binding function or a complementary mutation in the intramolecular sh3 binding site can compensate for de-complements this particular coiled-coil domain mutation inefficiently, as it does for b-lymphoid transforma-fects in oligomerization.
