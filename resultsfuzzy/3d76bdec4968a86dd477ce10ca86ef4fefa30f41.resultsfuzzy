5.1. Model selection and GARCH structural break unit root test (Narayan and Liu, 2015) Before estimating the pass-through effects of CPI to gold prices, it is important to select the best specification of the NARDL model for each country. For this purpose, we first estimate the NARDL model in Eq. (2) in the six countries. We then perform the Wald tests for shortand long-run symmetry in order to select the best-suited specifications. The optimal lag length is selected by the commonly-used information criteria (AIC and SIC). Table 2 summarizes the results that we obtain. A close look at the Wald test results shows that the NARDL with asymmetry is selected for the UK, USA and Japan, while the symmetric ARDL is chosen for China, India and France. The only case with both the short-run and long-run asymmetry is the USA, while it is only with the long-run asymmetry for the UK and Japan. Furthermore, these model selections are also consistent with the AIC and SIC criteria. These findings first suggest that ignoring the nonlinearity and asymmetry in modeling the relationship between gold prices and CPI may lead to spurious conclusions for the UK, USA and Japan. Furthermore, the special case of the USA may be explained by the specific relationship between gold and the USD as explained in the Introduction section. These model specifications also lead us to suspect that there is a significant difference between developed gold markets (UK, USA, Japan) and small (France) and emerging ones (China and India). In the former group (UK, USA, Japan), gold prices and CPI have a nonlinear and asymmetric relationship while in the latter (France, China, India) , it is linear and symmetric. This suggests thus that the reasons for the nonlinear passthrough of CPI to gold prices (Section 2) are more pronounced in developed gold markets than in small and emerging ones. Before estimating the cointegration NARDL model, it is useful to check whether the series understudy follows a unit-root process. For that, we use the GARCH structural break unit root test, developed by Narayan and Liu (2015) , which allows taking into account the heteroscedasticity of our monthly series. 16 This test is performed in two different steps: in the first one, we select the number of structural breaks using the Bai and Perron (2003) test; and in the second one, we perform the GARCH unit root test developed by Narayan and Liu (2015) using the number of breaks selected in step one. The results of these two tests are presented in Tables 3A and 3B.  Table 3A shows results of the structural break test of Bai and Perron (2003) following which there are two significant structural breaks in the series understudy. Results of the trend-GARCH unit root test (stat) in Table 3B indicate that 5 series over 12 are stationary at the 1% level and 2 series are stationary at the 10% level (integration of order 0). As for the 5 other series, they follow a unit root process (integration of order 1). Thanks to the flexibility of the NARDL model of Shin et al. (2014) , even if the series understudy do not have the same order of integration, we can always conduct the cointegration test which the results are presented in the next sub-section. Based on the results of the Wald tests in Table 2 , we now estimate the best-suited NARDL model for each country, with gold prices the dependent variable and the CPI as the independent one. At the first sight, the NARDL results in Table 4 confirm the selection of the best models identified in the previous step regarding the significance of the estimated coefficients. A close look at the model's diagnosis tests shows that the empirical models are correctly specified. With the series filtered by the NARDL, no remaining ARCH effects are present in the estimated residuals (compared to the raw series). The symmetric long-run effect of the CPI on gold prices, for China, India and France, is captured by the coefficients associated with cpi t − 1 . It is not significant at the conventional levels for all the three countries. This result suggests that gold does not help to hedge against inflationary risk in the long run in France, China and India. This finding thus suggests that in small (France) and emerging gold markets (China and India), gold does not serve as an inflation hedge in the long run. For China and India, this result may be explained by the fact that buying gold in these two countries (the two biggest gold consumers worldwide) is more motivated by its cultural and traditional aspects (e.g., gifts for wedding and new year celebrations) than by its financial aspects (only for the profitability). Hewitt et al. (2014) show that in India, gold is an integral part of the family budget such that the gold demand is not dependent on price fluctuations. Moreover, Indian women are sentimentally attached to their jewelry. As for China, according to Soundararajan et al. (2014) , the greatest part of gold demand is for jewelry and not for investment (2755 tons between 2009 and 2013, more than the half of the total demand). As for France, this result confirms our intuition (see Introduction section) that France constitutes a specific case due to its small gold market (gold has not been quoted in the Paris stock exchange since 2004); and the preference of French people for gold hoarding (people prefer keeping gold than selling it, see Section 4). In the second group of countries (UK, USA, Japan), the CPI affects gold prices in an asymmetric manner in the long run. This is captured by the cpi t − 1 + and cpi t − 1 − for positive and negative changes of the CPI, respectively. For both the UK and USA, the coefficients associated with positive changes are not significant. This result suggests that gold is not a hedge against inflation in the UK and USA in the long run. This result thus confirms findings of the second stream of literature that we analyzed in Section 2 (e.g., Batten et al., 2014; Beckmann and Czudaj, 2013; Wang et al., 2011) . This means that investors in the UK and USA should not use gold to hedge against inflation in the long run. Furthermore, the coefficients associated with negative changes of the CPI are significantly negative for these two countries. This means that in the long run, when the CPI decreases, gold prices increase (negative sign of the cpi t − 1 − coefficient). In this case, investors in the UK and USA should care about deflationary periods in which gold prices increase. For the UK, the deflationary period was in the 1980s essentially while for the USA, it was post 2008 (see Section 4). Finally, the cpi t − 1 − coefficient is much higher for the USA than for the UK (−1.308 vs. −0.259). This suggests that the variation of gold prices following a 1% decrease of the CPI is higher in the USA than in the UK. This may be due to the specific relationship between gold and the USD established within the Bretton Woods exchange system (see Section 1). For Japan, the long-run effect coefficients related to positive (cpi t − 1 + ) and negative (cpi t − 1 − ) changes of the CPI on gold prices are both significant and negative. This mechanism is not perfect since the coefficients are lower than 1, but still high (−0.702 and −0.884, respectively). This result suggests that gold is not a hedge against inflation in Japan in the long run because the coefficient related to positive variations of the CPI (cpi t − 1 + ) is negative (instead of positive). This means that an increase in the CPI does not lead to a rise in gold prices but a decrease, the contrary of an inflation hedge defined in Section 3. The negative value of the coefficient cpi t − 1 − means that when the CPI decreases, gold prices increase. This information is important for Japanese investors because Japan has been in a long deflationary period (see Section 4). Compared to the UK and USA, the case of Japan is different because the coefficient related to positive changes of the CPI (cpi t − 1 + ) is significant, but negative (instead of not significant). Always with the long-run relationship, the long-run coefficients (L cpi for symmetric cases; or L cpi þ ; L cpi − for asymmetric cases) capture the relationship between the CPI and gold prices at the long-run equilibrium. For symmetric cases (France, China and India) , all coefficients are nonsignificant. In asymmetric cases (UK, USA and Japan), for the UK and USA, only the coefficients related to negative variations of the CPI are significant but negative. This confirms the above analysis showing that a decrease in the CPI conducts to an increase in gold prices in the long run in the UK and USA. For Japan, both positive and negative coefficients are significant but they are very highly negative (− 20.978 and −26.409 for L cpi þ ; L cpi − , respectively). This means that at the long-run equilibrium, gold prices and the CPI evolve inversely in Japan. So, overall, results on the long-run coefficients confirm previous ones and suggest that gold is not a good hedge against inflation in the long run in all cases. Once again, we notice that the coefficients related to downward changes of the CPI are higher than those associated to upward changes. The short-run effects (captured by the coefficients associated with Δcpi t − i ) of the CPI on gold prices are significant for three over six countries (the UK, USA and India). As we mentioned above, the USA is the only country for which there is an asymmetry in the short run (coefficients related to Δcpi t + and Δcpi t − 1 − ). For positive variations, the lag is 0 and the coefficient is highly positive (4.810). This suggests that gold can serve as a good hedge against inflation in the short run in the USA. For negative variations of the CPI (Δcpi t − 1 − ), the lag is 1 and the coefficient is highly negative (− 5.955) . This means that when the CPI decreases in the short run, gold prices increase. This suggests that investors can also profit from deflation in the short run in the USA. As for India and the UK, the short-run effects are symmetric. For the UK, the short-run impact is positive at lag 5 and negative at lags 1 and 10. More precisely, the short-run effect of the CPI on gold prices in the UK is 2.073 (considering the 1% significance level for lag 5) and − 0.067 (considering the 10% significance level). 17 In this case, gold can be considered as a hedge against inflation in the short run in the UK thanks to a highly significant and positive coefficient (2.073). In India, the short-run impact is positive and significant at lag 4 (1.179). In this case, gold can be considered as a hedge against inflation in the short run in India at the 10% level only. Overall, the above results suggest that gold is not an inflation hedge in the long run but only in the short run in the UK, USA and India. This finding partly confirms that of Wang et al. (2011) showing that gold is not an efficient hedge against inflation in the long run in the USA and Japan. As for the short run, the authors find that gold is an inflation hedge only in the USA (in high momentum regimes) but not in Japan. Fig. 2 depicts the variation of the dynamic multipliers obtained in Eq. (5). These multipliers show the symmetric or asymmetric adjustments of gold prices to its new long-run equilibrium following a negative or positive unitary variation of the CPI. The positive and negative change curves capture the adjustment of gold prices to a unitary positive or negative variation of the CPI at a given forecasting horizon. For its part, the asymmetry curve represents the linear combination of the dynamic multipliers associated with positive and negative variations of the CPI. We also display the lower and upper bands for asymmetry with a 95% confidence interval. If the zero line is located between the lower and upper bands, the asymmetric effects of the CPI on gold prices are not significant at the 5% level. Fig. 2 shows that the adjustment patterns of gold prices to a unitary change of the CPI differ across countries. In the UK, USA and Japan, this adjustment is asymmetric while in France, China, and India, it is symmetric. In the UK, USA and Japan, a positive change in the CPI conducts to a decrease of gold prices (the blue line). This confirms previous results about the negative long-run effect coefficients cpi t − 1 + (see Table 4 ). This decrease is the strongest in Japan, followed by the UK and USA, confirming again results on the cpi t − 1 + coefficients (Table 4) . Always in these three countries, a negative change in the CPI conducts to a variation in the opposite sign of gold prices (the red line), which confirms the negative values of their cpi t − 1 − coefficients. Again, the highest impact is for Japan, followed by the UK and the USA. The graphs of these three countries also show that the new long-run equilibrium is attained after almost 80 months. For France, China and India, the symmetric relationship between the CPI and gold prices is confirmed in Fig. 2 . In France, a positive change in the CPI conducts to a rise in gold prices (the blue line). This confirms the positive long-run effect coefficient for France. However, this coefficient is very low and not significant. As for China, we see that there is no 17 At the 10% significance level, the short-run effect of the CPI on gold prices in the UK is the sum of the short-run coefficients − 1.052 (lag 1) + 2.073 (lag 5)-1.088 (lag 10) = −0.067.
