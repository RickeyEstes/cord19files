It has been demonstrated that MEK1 and MEK2 play a different role in EV71 replication [6] . To further elucidate the roles of downstream kinases of MEKs, ERK1 and ERK2 in EV71 replication, the effects of distinct knockdown of ERK1 or ERK2, or both on progeny viral titers were investigated. A clear reduction of progeny EV71 titers by about 90% were obtained in cells pre-treated with siERK1, siERK2 and siERK1+2, respectively, when compared with that of siNC control (Figure 2A ). To further determine the impact of specific ERK isoform on EV71 protein, viral structural proteins VP1 and VP3/4 were detected by Western blot analysis in EV71-infected RD cells pre-transfected with siERK1,or siERK2, or both, respectively. As shown in Figure 4A , ERK1, or ERK2, or ERK1/2 expression were almost diminished by siERK1, or ERK2, or siERK1+2, which resulted in the activation inhibition of ERK1, ERK2, or ERK1/2 by about 80% to 90%. The silencing effect decreased the expression of VP1 and VP3/4 by around 70%, when compared with that of siNC control ( Figure 4B ). It seemed that siERK1 had a better inhibitory effect on VP1 and VP3/4 but no significance difference compared with that of siERK2 and siERK1+2 ( Figure 4B ). In addition, U0126 reduced more than 99% of viral VP1 and VP3/4 expression which was significantly reduction than that of siERK(s)-treated groups. Our results suggested that both ERK1 and ERK2 might be crucial for EV71 protein production. Figure 4 . Impacts of ERK1 and ERK2 on protein production of EV71 in RD cells. (A). RD cells pre-treated with siERK(s) or U0126 were infected with 2 MOI of EV71. At 12 h p.i., total protein harvested was blotted with antibodies specific to VP1 and VP3/4. β-actin was used as the loading control. The relative intensities of VP1 (panel B) and VP3/4 (panel C) normalized to β-actin were presented by the percentage of the intensity of respective DMSO+EV71 group (100%). Data represent the average of three independent experiments and is shown as the means ± SD. ** p < 0.01 *** p < 0.001, versus corresponding control groups by Student's t-test.
