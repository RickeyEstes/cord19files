When will a prophylactic antiviral control program be able to prevent an epidemic? Several studies have addressed this question using simulations of metapopulation models that include household structure and other population and pathogen details [6] [7] [8] . Here we focus on a basic model for a large well-mixed population. To evaluate whether successful invasion of the pathogen is possible we calculate the (basic) reproduction number (denoted by R 0 ), which gives the number of new infections caused by a single infected individual in a population of uninfected individuals in the early stages of an outbreak [15] . If R 0 .1 the pathogen can invade a population in which it is not yet present, while it cannot if R 0 ,1. In the case that the pathogen-induced mortality is such that it hardly affects the infectious period, the reproduction number is given by (see Text S1 for a derivation). The first factor in equation ( Equation (1) shows that the pathogen cannot invade the population if the rate of antiviral prophylaxis exceeds a certain critical rate of antiviral prophylactic therapy s c , which is given by the solution of the equation R 0 = 1. For the default parameter values (Table 1 ) it turns out that the critical rate of antiviral prophylaxis is s c = 1.96 (yr 21 ) if antiviral drugs provide complete protection against infection (AVE S = 1). This implies that approximately two-thirds of the population needs to be protected against infection by antiviral prophylaxis in order to prevent an epidemic. This fraction increases if antiviral drugs provide partial protection against infection and subsequent transmission.
