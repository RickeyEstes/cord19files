This statement can easily be confirmed. Lund (1971 Lund ( , 1973 Lund ( , 1976 found viruses in primary sludges in a number of cases where the corre sponding raw wastewaters did not yield viruses. In various chemical treatments in a Copenhagen pilotplant (table 1) the same was the case. In other cases a concentration procedure was required for virus de monstration from wastewater, when direct inoculation was enough for the corresponding sludge sample. When it is remembered that in pri mary settling about half the virus will go with the sludge and that the primary sludge has a volume of about 0.5 per cent of the raw wastewater from which it originates these findings are not surprising. In fact before we get methods for virus demonstration in primary sludge that give more than 10-fold and preferably 100 fold as much virus from sludge samples than from wastewater samples our methods for solid associated virus are probably not good enough, even if the wastewater methods were. From this kind of reasoning it may also be deducted that some sludge disposal practices may be hazardous from a virological point of view and that efforts to improve the methodology of virus detection from sludge samples may be justified, so that a more firm base for public health precautions may be obtained. quality, so gradually its use seems discontinued. In connection with studies of drying bed sludges and land application of sludges it was found that the sludges to which sludge thickeners have been added more frequently yielded viruses than other sludges. Nielsen and Lydholm (unpublished;results) studied the use of these polyacrylamid sludge thickeners and found it very satisfactory to employ them for virus detection in the following way: To a 20 ml aliguOt the polyacrylaraid (e.g. 100 ppm of Zetag, molecular weight 10 J was added at pH 5.5. The floe formed was ^iltemd. through a 1 i^n nesh Î•. Lund sieve or a loose cotton plug. Elution was performed at pH 9 using glycine buffer or beef extract. With seeded samples the recovery was very high (60-120%) with less than one per cent of the virus in the filtrate. With natural samples the eluates were concentrated by poly ethylene glycol hydroextraction. In table 4 some results obtained using this method are compiled. The samples are collected in August-September 1978 from three treatment plants at Copenhagen and a num ber of technical data were obtained for the sludges. 


Section:glass and o'brien (1980) emphasize that enterovirus removal by ac tivated sludge treatment cannot be equated with virus inactivation. they state that fluid volume reduction from mixed liquor to settled sludge could result in concentrations of infective viruses in sludge which exceeds the concentration in the original wastewater.
Section:as also described in the review by hajemion and butler (1979) poly electrolytes like pego have been employed for the concentration of viruses (e.g. wallis and co-workers, 1969, chandhury and westwood, 19 72). the pego apparently gave very varied results and varied in
