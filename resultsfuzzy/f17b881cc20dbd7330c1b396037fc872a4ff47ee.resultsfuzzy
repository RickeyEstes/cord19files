Feces were usually characterized as brown to light green or yellow with or without blood and mucus, with a consistency varying from semisolid to very watery and a strong, unpleasant odor. Clinical signs in diarrheic calves ranged from normal to marked changes in posture and behavior, from strong to absent suckling reflex, and from slight to severe delay in skin tenting. The rectal temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate in diarrheic calves varied from 33.5 to 40.7 C, 60-185 beats/min, and 15-80 breaths/min as minimum and maximum values, respectively, and did not differ from the healthy control calves (Table 2) . Further demographic information and the statistical evaluation of laboratory findings in control and diarrheic calves are summarized in Table 2 . Overall, calves with acute diarrhea had higher WBC, K, AST, creatinine and urea, NO and blood ammonia, and lower pH, HCO 3 , BE, total protein, CIT, and ARG values than healthy control calves (Table 2) , and the differences in plasma CIT and its related metabolites remained important after adjusting for age. There was a significant effect of time on plasma CIT (P = .03), ARG (P < .001), NO (P = .01), and blood ammonia concentrations (P = .008) in the healthy control group during the neonatal period (Supporting information Figure S1 ). significantly lower in the infectious diarrhea ( Figure 1B ), in FS 3 ( Figure 2B ), severe dehydration ( Figure 3B) , and SIRS-positive subgroups ( Figure 4B ) than in the healthy control group. In addition, plasma ARG concentrations were significantly lower in the severe dehydrated subgroup than in the mild dehydration subgroup (P = .03) and in the SIRS-positive subgroup than in the SIRS-negative subgroup (P < .001). Plasma NO and blood ammonia concentrations were significantly higher in the infectious diarrhea subgroups than in the control group ( Figure 1C,D) . Plasma NO concentration was higher in severe diarrhea (FS 3) subgroup ( Figure 2C ) whereas blood ammonia concentration was higher in both moderate (P < .01) and severe diarrhea (P < .001) subgroups ( Figure 2D ). Both variables were also significantly higher in the severe dehydrated diarrheic subgroup than in the healthy control group ( Figure 3C,D) , as well as the mild (P < .001) and moderate dehy- The relationships between plasma CIT and its related variables and independent variables (age, diarrhea etiology, SIRS status) by linear regression in diarrheic calves are presented in Table 3 . There was no significant effect of age on plasma log-transformed CIT, ARG, and NO as well as blood ammonia concentrations. By contrast, the pres- Furthermore, diarrhea etiology was found to be positively associated with plasma log-transformed NO and blood ammonia (Table 3 ). An ANCOVA revealed no effect of severity of diarrhea (P = .29), degree of dehydration (P = .40) or the covariate calf age (P = .77 for severity of diarrhea, and P = .50 for degree of dehydration) on plasma CIT level. The interactions between severity of diarrhea and age (P = .50) and between degree of dehydration and age (P = .67) were also not significant. An ANCOVA revealed no effect of the covariate calf age on plasma CIT (P = .77), ARG (P = .14), NO (P = .30), and blood ammonia (P = .09). The interactions between severity of diarrhea and age and between degree of dehydration and age for CIT and its related metabolites were also not significant. However, there were significant effects of severity of diarrhea on plasma CIT (P = .04), ARG (P = .04), NO (P < .001), and 39 The blood ammonia concentration with a median of 28.7 μmol/L in healthy control calves ( Table 2 ) was in agreement with the values <90 μmol/L reported previously by other investigators. 40 Veterinary assessment of calves with diarrhea is generally based on clinical examination and routine laboratory variables alone; however, To date, no studies have evaluated plasma CIT in neonatal calves with acute diarrhea, and only 1 study on ARG levels demonstrated lower lysine + ARG concentrations. 41 Therefore, the plasma CIT concentration observed in the present study is not directly comparable. However, our plasma CIT result is in agreement with the findings of several previous reports in humans with enteropathies 10-12,15 and sepsis, 13, 16, 17 as well as in dogs. 22, 42 As previously reported in humans, decreased plasma CIT and ARG in diarrheic calves could be because of impaired intestinal production, different metabolic processes altered in inflammatory conditions, or a combination of both. 9, 11, 13, 33, 42 Infectious diarrhea in neonatal calves results in a low to strong inflammatory response. 1, 4, 43 Approximately 80% of CIT is converted to the amino acid, ARG, in the body to support ARG and NO levels. 6, 8, 9, 44 Conversion of CIT to ARG and converting/recycling ARG to CIT and NO appear to be dependent on the severity of inflammation. 6, 7, 14 Therefore, the decreases in plasma CIT and ARG levels can especially be based on intestinal damage, dysfunction, or both mechanisms, leading to the impaired production of these amino acids. Although small bowel enteroscopy or histopathological examination was not performed in this study, certain enteropathogens, particularly C. parvum, rotavirus, and coronavirus are associated with mucosal injury in calves. 1, 4 Considering all of these factors, low plasma CIT and ARG concentrations in neonatal calves with diarrhea ( Figure 1A,B) . We cannot explain the exact reasons for these results. Perhaps this result stems from the low number of calves with noninfectious diarrhea enrolled in the study. Another factor affecting plasma CIT concentration might be renal impairment. 6 However, CIT is metabolized into ARG in the intestine instead of CIT and decreased uptake of glutamine by the enterocyte. 6 In addition, CIT production is severely reduced during SIRS and sepsis, resulting in diminished ARG de novo production and NO availability. 7, 9 For NO synthesis, inducible NO synthases (iNOS) known as inflammatory NOS, can be expressed by almost all cell types in most tissues. 47 After its induction by certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, lipopolysaccharide, or both, a large amount of NO is produced over a long period of time during the inflammatory process of infectious disease. [48] [49] [50] In this study, 50 of 60 diarrheic calves were evaluated as infectious. Similar to previous studies in humans 50 indicating NO formation, are well documented in patients with SIRS or sepsis, and this alteration contributes to intestinal damage and its consequences. 9 In the present study, significantly higher plasma NO concentration in diarrheic calves with SIRS can also be explained by a similar process ( Figure 4C ). Ammonia is a toxic compound to many organ systems, especially the brain. Excessive blood ammonia concentration might result in respiratory alkalosis, cerebral edema, mental disorders, seizures, coma, and death. Increases in blood ammonia concentration are generally considered to only be a result of liver-related disorders, but other underlying causes should be assessed as well. 20 High blood ammonia levels can develop from several different mechanisms, including (1) hepatic insufficiency, (2) reduced activity of urea cycle enzymes, (3) metabolic disorders of organic acids, and (4) portosystemic shunt. 20 In the present study, blood ammonia concentration with a median of 59.8 μmol/L in diarrheic calves was significantly higher than that in healthy calves (Table 2 ). Although these median levels remained within the reference range (<90 μmol/L) reported for cattle, 40 median blood ammonia levels in the severe diarrhea (105.7 μmol/L), severe dehydration (113.9 μmol/L), and SIRS positive (105.7 μmol/L) subgroups were above the reference limits ( Figures 2D, 3D, and 4D ). This increase in these subgroups can be considered to be hyperammonemia and might be related to the loss of liver or kidney function because of circulatory failure in the result of diarrhea, as well as the decrease of plasma citrulline and arginine concentrations which decreases the efficiency of the urea cycle. In this content, hyperammonemia has also been reported in a human case of short bowel syndrome along with decreased concentrations of arginine and citrulline 54 and in systemic infections with bacteria or virus. 55 The moderate and positive relationship of blood ammonia with SIRS status (Table 3 ) and the effects of severity of diarrhea and degree of dehydration) might be based on the factors affecting urea cycle and ammonia metabolism. 20 The results of this study are subject to some limitations. This study included a variety of mono or combined causative agents (Table 1) with NCD in calves with noninfectious diarrhea cannot be determined because only the antigens of the most common enteropathogens in feces were evaluated. Additionally, the duration of disease is a confounding factor which could cause difficulty in diagnosis of noninfectious diarrhea. Lastly, the sample size of this study was small, especially in neonatal calves with noninfectious diarrhea. In conclusion, the present study reported that neonatal calves with acute diarrhea have significantly lower plasma concentrations of CIT and ARG, as well as higher plasma NO and blood ammonia levels, and these changes were associated with SIRS status, severity of diarrhea, and degree of dehydration. Plasma CIT concentrations could be a useful marker to evaluate the presence and degree of intestinal damage and gut barrier dysfunction in neonatal calves with acute diarrhea. However, further studies are needed to determine the importance of decreased plasma CIT and ARG levels and increased levels of plasma NO and blood ammonia with regard to diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy in NCD.
