Acutely isolated CD11b + CD45 int cells express high levels of microglial homeostatic genes and represent a specific resident immune cell population Cell-specific transcriptomic analyses are critically dependent on isolation protocols to obtain pure populations resembling their physiological profiles. To characterize microglia close to their proper environment, mouse brains were mechanically dissociated into single-cell suspension with all the steps performed at 4°C [36] . Since microglia in the mouse brain represent only 10% of the cells, CD11b + CD45 int microglia were purified from other CNS and immune cells, including CD11b + CD45 high macrophages and CD11b À CD45 high lymphocytes, by FACS, as described previously (Figs 1A and EV1) [37] . To verify accurate microglial enrichment, we compared gene expression levels of specific CNS cell type markers between RNA extracted from unsorted total brain cells and CD11b + CD45 int sorted microglia (Fig 1B) . We analysed the expression levels of microglial homeostatic genes (Olfml3, Fcrls, Tmem119, Siglech, Gpr34, P2ry12) as well as astrocytic (Gfap, Gjb6, Ntsr2, Aldh1l1), oligodendrocytic (Mobp, Mog, Cldn11) and neuronal (Tubb3, Vglut1, NeuN) markers. As expected, microglial markers were highly expressed in CD11b + CD45 int sorted cells, whereas astrocytic, oligodendrocytic and neuronal markers were undetectable or detectable at background levels (Figs 1B and EV1). We next investigated whether CD11b + CD45 int population contained resident non-parenchymal macrophages, such as perivascular macrophages. This was inferred using CD206 as an additional marker for resident macrophages [38] . Under homeostatic conditions, CD11b + CD45 int microglia contained only 0.04 AE 0.02% CD206 + cells, while CD11b + CD45 high cells contained 24.7 AE 3.8% CD206 + resident macrophages (Fig 1C and D) . Similar results were obtained for the dendritic cell marker CD11c and the monocytic markers Ly6C and CCR2 (Fig EV1) . Taken together, these results show that our approach highly discriminates pure and not activated microglial populations from other resident CNS cells. Microglia isolated from LPS-injected mice show a classical activated pro-inflammatory profile accompanied by a decreased homeostatic signature The response of microglia towards specific pro-or anti-inflammatory cues in vitro has been extensively studied [39] . Treatment of primary microglial cells with TGF-b, LPS or IL-4 generates, respectively, the so-called M0 homeostatic, M1 pro-inflammatory and M2 anti-inflammatory states defined by specific gene signatures [5, 40] . However, our understanding towards the reaction of microglia under inflammatory conditions in vivo is only starting to emerge. To comprehensively investigate the effect of a systemic inflammatory and/or infectious state on microglia, we peripherally injected mice with LPS (4 lg/g body) 24 h prior analysis. It has been shown that a single-dose injection of LPS induces acute inflammatory, but not neurodegenerative processes [35] . We isolated CD11b + CD45 int cells from LPS-injected mice and compared mRNA levels of specific genes ▸ Figure 1 . Characterization of acutely isolated CD11b + CD45 int cells. A FACS gating strategy representative of five independent experiments adopted to sort CD11b + CD45 int microglia distinctly from CD11b + CD45 high resident macrophages and CD11b À CD45 high lymphocytes. B Analysis of relative transcript levels of CD11b + CD45 int FACS-sorted microglia compared with whole brain tissue by qPCR. Gene expression levels of microglia (Olfml3, Fcrls, Tmem119, Siglech, Gpr34, P2ry12), astrocyte (Gfap, Gjb6, Ntsr2, Aldh1l1), oligodendrocyte (Mobp, Mog, Cldn1) and neuron (Tubb3, Vglut1, NeuN) markers. Bars represent mean (n = 4; pool of one female and one male per biological replicate) of relative expression (Gapdh as housekeeping gene) AE SEM (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01 by two-tailed Student's t-test to the corresponding cells isolated from saline-injected control mice by qPCR. In agreement with previous studies [32, 41] , the expression levels of homeostatic (e.g. Olfml3, Fcrls, Tmem119, Siglech, Gpr34, P2ry12, Mef2c), phagocytic (Tyrobp and Trem2) and anti-inflammatory genes (e.g. Mrc1 and Arg1) were highly decreased in microglia isolated from LPS-injected mice compared to untreated mice, while the classical pro-inflammatory genes (e.g. Il1b, Tnf and Ccl2) were markedly increased (Figs 2A and EV2) . Notably, it has been recently shown that signals from the CNS microenvironment have considerable influence in shaping, maintaining and reinforcing microglial identity by regulating expression and establishing distinct chromatin landscapes surrounding enhancer regions [42] [43] [44] . Changes in chromatin remodelers associate with changes in the expression of nearby genes. Specifically, MEF2C binding sites were shown to be over-enriched in enhancer regions of microglial-specific genes [42] and the loss of MEF2C was associated with priming of microglia [45] . In line with these observations, Mef2c expression levels were highly decreased in microglia isolated from LPS-injected mice compared to naïve mice. We verified that this signature is microglia-specific, and it is not affected by LPS-activated immune peripheral cells, such as lymphocytes (CD11b À CD45 high cells) and peripheral monocytes/macrophages (CD11b + CD45 high cells), as no significant differences were detected between cellular populations present in brains of salineand LPS-injected mice (Figs 2B and EV2). Importantly, CD11b + CD45 int FACS-gated cells contained very rare (< 0.25%) Ly6C + putative monocytes and (< 0.1%) CD206 + putative resident macrophages ( Fig 2C) . Also, the expression of monocytic markers Ly6c1 and Ccr2 was very low in CD11b + CD45 int microglia compared to bone marrow-isolated monocytes with no significant differences under LPS exposure (Figs 2D and EV2). In order to further assess that the decrease in the homeostatic signature under inflammatory conditions is not due to the presence of other immune cell types, but it is an intrinsic property of microglial cells, we also analysed the effect of LPS on cultivated microglial from adult and neonatal mice. As expected, the expression level of the homeostatic genes was markedly decreased in cultivated cells when compared to acutely isolated microglia ( Fig EV2) [5] . Thus, we cultivated adult microglia in the presence of TGF-b (50 lg/ml) and M-CSF (10 ng/ ml) or neonatal cells with TGF-b 24 h prior treatment with LPS to induce the expression of the homeostatic genes, although at a lower extent than in ex vivo isolated cells (Fig EV2) . Cells treated with LPS (1 ng/ml) for 6 h showed a dramatic decrease of the expression levels of the homeostatic gene markers, such as Olfml3, Tmem119 and Gpr34, accompanied by enhanced expression levels of inflammatory marker genes, such as Il1b, Tnf and Ccl2 both in adult and in neonatal microglia when compared to cells treated with TGF-b only (Fig 2E) . In the healthy brain, TGF-b is expressed at low levels by both neurons and glial cells [46, 47] , while its expression is increased upon injury [48, 49] , hypoxia-ischaemia [50] and neurodegeneration [51, 52] . SMAD and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins are key signal transducers and transcription factors controlling TGF-b downstream signalling [53] . Specifically, STAT3 and suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) regulate inflammatory responses [54] . The binding of SOCS3 to both JAK kinase and the cytokine receptor results in the inhibition of STAT3 activation. In our analysis, microglial cells treated with LPS showed increased amounts of STAT3 phosphorylation along with upregulation of Socs3 expression levels compared to untreated cells (Appendix Fig S1) . Taking advantage of the "harmonizome" collection of databases [55] , we attested that more than 1/3 of the top 100 sensome genes [4] possess STAT3-binding sites in their promoter region. Hence, we hypothesized that the SOCS3-STAT3 antagonistic signalling may be responsible for the suppression of the homeostatic microglia signature and the concomitant shift towards the inflammatory profile [56] . These results show that microglia isolated from LPS-injected mice display a classical activated pro-inflammatory profile associated with a decrease in the expression of the homeostatic genes. The decrease in the homeostatic signature under inflammatory conditions is an inherent facet of microglial in vivo and in vitro. Single-cell mRNA sequencing of CD11b + CD45 int microglia isolated from LPS-injected mice reveals a global transcriptional shift and increased heterogeneity compared to steady state conditions Based on the observed differences in the targeted qPCR approach under steady state and LPS conditions, we next aimed to investigate microglial states at the genome-wide level and infer their transcriptomic heterogeneity at single-cell resolution, since studying a population of cells masks the differences among individual cells. For this purpose, FACS-sorted CD11b + CD45 int cells from saline-or LPSinjected mice were analysed using the recently developed highthroughput droplet-based Drop-seq method [23] . In Drop-seq, single cells and functionalized barcoded beads as cell identifiers are co-encapsulated into droplets followed by cDNA synthesis, amplification, library preparation and next-generation sequencing. First, we sought for differentially expressed genes between all LPS and all naïve/saline cells using MAST [57] . We identified 2,405 differentially expressed genes between these two conditions with a false discovery rate (FDR) cut-off of 5% (Dataset EV1) and exemplified the top 100 differentially expressed genes in a heatmap ( Fig 3A) . Second, principal component analysis followed by twodimensional t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (2D-tSNE) of the overall gene expression data of 1,247 analysed cells identified two main cell clusters that were independent of the 2D-tSNE parameters and library sizes (Appendix Fig S2) . Microglia isolated from LPS-injected mice distinctly clustered from the corresponding steady state microglia presenting discrete gene expression signatures ( Fig 3B; Dataset EV1 ). Intriguingly, we noticed from both analyses that, although most of the activated cells clustered together, a small group of cells assembled closer to the control cells, thus highlighting the existence of potential subpopulations under inflammatory conditions, which we characterized later. Gene set enrichment analysis (GO) of upregulated genes in microglia isolated from LPS-injected mice using DAVID [58, 59] uncovered significant involvement (P < 2.5 × 10 À9 ) in "translation", "protein folding", "ribosome biogenesis" and "immune system process", thus reflecting highly activated cells. On the other hand, GO of the corresponding downregulated genes identified, among others, significant enrichment (P < 4.9 × 10 À5 ) in "regulation of transforming growth factor beta receptor signalling pathway", thus reflecting that TGF-b signalling is among the most affected pathways in microglia exposed to LPS (Appendix Fig S3) . In line with gene expression results obtained at the bulk level, microglial homeostatic genes (e.g. Tmem119, Mef2c, P2ry13, P2ry12, Siglech) were among the top downregulated genes and classical pro-inflammatory genes (e.g. Ccl2, Gpr84, Nfkbia) were mainly upregulated also at the single-cell level (Appendix Fig S2) . We further investigated individual gene expressions at single-cell level using 2D-tSNE to show specific homeostatic and inflammatory gene expression levels. For example, Tmem119, Siglech and P2ry12 genes were consistently expressed under steady state, but were downregulated in microglia isolated from LPS-injected mice, while Ccl2 and Gpr84 were largely upregulated in most of the cells exposed to LPS compared to saline conditions ( Fig 3C; Appendix Fig S4) . Notably, a prominent decrease in TMEM119 and P2RY12 expression was further confirmed at the protein level by flow cytometry (Fig 3D) . Although microglial activation is a common hallmark under inflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions [22] , microglia transcriptional signatures have been shown to be different. For example, Chiu et al [16] demonstrated that acutely isolated microglia from the SOD1 G93A mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) differed from LPS-activated microglia, defining an ALSspecific phenotype. Following the recent description of a novel disease-associated microglial (DAM) phenotype identified under neurodegenerative conditions at single-cell resolution [14] , we here compared our inflammatory-associated microglia (IAM) signature to DAM. The scatterplot showing the fold change of genes between microglia isolated from LPS-injected mice (2,405 genes; Dataset EV1) versus DAM (1,660 genes; Dataset EV2) compared to homeostatic microglia (FDR < 0.05) disclosed 1,826 unique genes affected by the LPS treatment (e.g. Tnf, Irf1), 1,081 distinct genes in DAM (e.g. Itgax, Axl) and 579 shared genes between the two populations (e.g. Gpr84, Tmem119), thus highlighting that these cells mainly display a unique expression profile ( Fig EV3) . Specifically, only 215 upregulated genes (12.1%) and 364 downregulated genes (21.2%) were shared between the two groups ( Fig EV3) . Gene set enrichment analysis (GO) and identification of key genes being discriminative between inflammatory microglia and DAM revealed a high inflammatory reactivity upon LPS treatment and a phagocytic/lysosomal gene signature in DAM (Fig EV3) . For instances, Trem2 and Tyrobp expression levels were highly decreased in IAM, whereas an elevation of both genes was reported in DAM. TREM2 associates with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing adaptor protein TYROBP (DAP12), in which signalling involves the recruitment of tyrosine kinase Syk that further phosphorylates downstream pathways inducing cell activation. TREM2 is required for phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons, microglial proliferation and survival [56, [60] [61] [62] . These subtle differences in perceiving different signals induced by CNS perturbations support the microglial critical role in modulating specific functional activities. In fact, it is intuitive to consider that sensing inflammatory environments to maintain a homeostatic neuronal network (e.g. through the expression of Clec4a and Clec5a genes that are exclusively upregulated in our dataset) or recognizing and clearing pathogenic factors (e.g. by expressing Clec7a/Dectin-1 in DAM), such as b-amyloid aggregates in AD, require distinct activated phenotypes. In a different context, it has been recently shown that myelin pieces are gradually released from ageing myelin sheaths and are subsequently cleared by microglia [63] . Age-related myelin fragmentation is substantial, leading to lysosomal storage and contributing to microglial senescence and immune dysfunction in ageing [63] . It could be then hypothesized that a similar accentuated mechanism may be encountered by microglia surrounding b-amyloid plaques, which become dystrophic at a late stage of the disease [64] . Interestingly, genes described to be associated with neurological diseases, such as Cd33, Cd9, Sod1, Ctsd, and Hif1a, were also downregulated in our signature in comparison with DAM. Taken together, these results suggest that microglia under acute systemic inflammation present a highly activated state, which is heterogeneous and distinct from neurodegenerative diseaseassociated profiles.
