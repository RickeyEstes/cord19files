Column (1) of Table 3 reports results for an ordinary least squares specification that is representative of the FDI literature. The coefficients on income per capita and total population, our indicators of market size, are positive and strongly significant, and this remains true for all our specifications. The coefficients on each are usually not significantly different from unity in our regressions, indicating that in practice normalizing FDI flows by total GDP is valid. Corruption is not significantly different from zero in our specifications, yet the other gover- nance measure, quality of bureaucratic institutions, is both significant and positive in the model. Adding life expectancy in column (2) demonstrates that health is a statistically significant predictor of gross FDI inflows at the 1% level and is robust to adding education in column (3). The results indicate that every additional year of life expectancy increases FDI inflows by about 7% among the full sample of countries. The other component of human capital, education, has a positive coefficient, but is not statistically significant. This finding is consistent with the conflicting evidence on the importance of education in determining the inflows of FDI. Root and Ahmed (1979) , as well as Schneider and Frey (1985) , report that education does not significantly affect FDI flows to developing countries. More recently, however, Noorbakhsh et al. (2001) and Globerman and Shapiro (2002) argue that education does have a positive and significant impact on foreign investment and that its effect has been increasing over time. The reason for the poorly determined coefficient on secondary schooling in our model could be measurement error in the data on education that biases the estimated coefficient toward zero (see Krueger & Lindahl, 2001) . We also tried other measures of education, such as the number of accumulated years of education in the population aged 15-64 and school enrollment rates, but did not find any measure that produced a statistically significant effect. We further test for robustness by adding infrastructure and geographic variables that are also postulated to be determinants of FDI inflows. The results reported in column (4) indicate that the coefficient on life expectancy is robust to these alternate specifications, though many of the controls do not themselves appear to be statistically significant. 12 Recent evidence suggests that pooling data from industrial and developing countries in empirical FDI studies may yield misleading coefficient estimates (Blonigen & Wang, 2004) . We might expect that developing countries are more dependent on export-oriented FDI, while industrial countries are more attractive for market-seeking FDI (Shatz & Venables, 2000) . Of particular relevance to the current study, we noted a gap in average life expectancy between income groups: 75.2 years for high-income countries versus 59.4 years for low-and middle-income countries. Diminishing returns to health might well make it a more important investment in low-income countries. We therefore analyze the model using two restricted samples, one of low-and middle-income countries and one of high-income countries selected on the basis of the World Bank's income classification. 13 The results for low-and middle-income countries are reported in Table 4 . The model being estimated in Table 4 is identical to that reported in Table 3 , the only difference being the sample. The results are broadly similar to those listed in Table 3 . The coefficient on openness is somewhat larger than before, which is consistent with foreign investment to developing countries being mainly export-oriented. Life expectancy once again has a positive and statistically significant effect on FDI. The large decrease in the coefficient on GDP per capita when we add life expectancy to the model indicates that when health is excluded from the model, GDP per capita is, to some extent, serving as a proxy for health in low-and middle-income countries. The effect of population health on FDI inflows is robust to adding education and other control variables. Our results suggest that every additional year of life expectancy is associated with a 9% increase in gross FDI flows to lowand middle-income countries. The index of corruption is now significant, but of the ''wrong'' sign. The results suggest that higher levels of corruption are associated with higher levels of FDI in low-and middleincome countries. This finding, although perhaps surprising, agrees with Stein and Daude's (2001) and Wheeler and Mody's (1992) results. It is also consistent with Alesina and Weder (1999) , who argue that the relationship between corruption and economic performance is complicated. Some types of corruption may allow the relatively efficient provision of services to foreign firms, its main effect being on the distribution of domestic economic gains, with little distortion of productive activities. Table 5 uses the same specifications as Table  3 for a sample restricted to high-income countries. The sample size now becomes quite small and may lead to some variables becoming statistically insignificant simply because of a lack of power; therefore, these results should be treated with caution. Unlike the results reported from the previous two samples; openness, GDP per capita, and bureaucratic quality are not statistically significant. The lack of significance of openness is consistent with the idea that FDI going to industrial countries is mainly to access their markets rather than to export. Even though GDP per capita does not have a significant association with FDI inflows, the other proxy for market size, total population, is highly significant at the 1% level. The lack of significance of GDP per capita could be due to a balancing of the market size effect with the cost of production effect, which should work in the opposite directions. Reduced corruption does appear to have a positive and significant impact on FDI in this sample; indicating that the type of corruption, or the way it affects the economy, may differ between industrial and developing countries. Health is not statistically significant in any specification among high-income countries. This is consistent with the idea that the worker productivity effects of health differentials appear mainly in developing countries; however, we hesitate to emphasize such an interpretation due to the small sample size. Our results are consistent with those of Blonigen and Wang (2004) , who argue that the underlying factors that determine the level of FDI activity vary systematically across countries at different stages of development. This split of the sample is supported by the fact that we can reject parameter equality between the two sub-samples in some specifications. For example, taking regression 1, the F-test (distributed as a v 2 (7, 121)) yields a statistic of 2.18. This leads us to reject the hypothesis that the coefficients reported in the two sub-samples are the same at the 5% significance level. We also reject the commonality of coefficients in regression specification 2. Although we fail to reject the null hypothesis of equality for regression specifications 3 and 4, it seems preferable to consider the two sub-samples separately.
