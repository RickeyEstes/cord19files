SHAPE analysis of MHV-A59 5 0 region of RNA In vitro synthesized and refolded RNA corresponding to nts 1-489 plus a 24-nucleotide unstructured region were separately reacted with the SHAPE reagents 1M7 and NMIA, and SHAPE reactivity at each position was assessed by primer extension as described in Materials and methods. In vitro synthesized RNA was used as the initial substrate for SHAPE analysis because all previous biochemical analyses of the RNA secondary structure of the 5 0 region of coronaviruses have used in vitro synthesized RNAs (Brown et al., 2007; Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010; Guan et al., 2012 Guan et al., , 2011 Li et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009a; Raman et al., 2003; Raman and Brian, 2005; Yang et al., 2011) , thus allowing a direct comparison of results. Although 1M7 provides a faster reaction rate and more accurate information regarding RNA structure than NMIA (Mortimer and Weeks, 2007) we utilized both 1M7 and NMIA in order to compare the results obtained with the two chemicals and to provide a basis for subsequent in virio genomic RNA SHAPE experiments which require NMIA being able to penetrate virus envelopes . The SHAPE reactivity profiles obtained with 1M7 and NMIA were highly reproducible and very similar. The electropherograms of a typical region at positions 20-74 obtained by 1M7 and NMIA modification are shown in Fig. 2A and B, respectively. Strikingly, the core leader-TRS sequence at nts 60-72 and the flanking region showed high SHAPE reactivity, as expected, because these regions in MHV are predicted to be weakly paired or unpaired (Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010; Liu et al., 2007) . Three independent experiments were carried out for each reaction and the raw electropherograms containing SHAPE reactivity versus nucleotide position were analyzed using ShapeFinder as described in Materials and methods to yield quantitative SHAPE reactivities at single nucleotide resolution. The mean SHAPE reactivity data for 1M7 modified in vitro transcribed RNA corresponding to nts 1-489 plus a 24 nts unstructured region is shown for nts 18-457 in Fig. 3 . Quantitative SHAPE results were not obtained for the 5 0 -most 17 nts and for nts 458-474 at the 3 0 end of the target sequence. The data shown in Fig. 3A is the average SHAPE reactivity obtained using a primer complementary to position 261-282 near the mid-point of the target sequence. Fig. 3B displays data obtained using a primer complementary to the unstructured primer binding site included in the in vitro transcribed RNA 3 0 to nt 489. The experimental reproducibility was excellent. SHAPE analysis informs a secondary structure model of the 5 0 474 nts cis-acting region required for replication of MHV-A59 DI RNA The mean SHAPE reactivity results obtained with 1M7 for the 5 0 474 nts segment of in vitro transcribed and refolded RNA representing the MHV-A59 genome (see Fig. 3 ) were imported into RNAstructure, incorporating the SHAPE reactivity as pseudo-free energy constraints as described in Materials and methods. The secondary structure prediction from RNAstructure, annotated by the nucleotide resolution SHAPE reactivity, is shown in Fig. 4 . A similar analysis was performed with the NMIA-derived mean SHAPE reactivity as the input into RNAstructure (Fig. S1 ), and the secondary structure generated for in vitro transcribed and refolded RNA was identical with that obtained using 1M7 as the modification reagent (compare Fig. 4 with Fig. S2 ). The structure generated (Fig. 4 ) is in agreement with our previous characterization of SL1 (Li et al., 2008) , SL2 (Liu et al., 2009a (Liu et al., , 2007 and predicts the correct structure for SL4 at position nts 80-130 (Yang et al., 2011) . These stem-loops serve as cis-acting elements required for driving subgenomic RNA synthesis. Interestingly, the stem predicted for SL3 by phylogenetic algorithms (Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010) in the TRS region was single-stranded with relatively high SHAPE reactivity, consistent with the prediction of Liu et al. (2007) that this region was weakly paired or unpaired. The structure was also in good agreement with the two recent models of MHV-A59 RNA secondary structure (Guan et al., 2012 (Guan et al., , 2011 ) that identified two additional cis-acting replication elements required for optimal viral replication. S5 (Fig. 4) which contains a long-range RNA-RNA interaction (nts 141-167 base paired with nts 363-335) was largely equivalent to the base pairing (nts 141-170 paired with nts 363-332) predicted by Guan et al. (2012) . The sole exception is nts 332-334, which are unpaired in the Guan model but are part of the SL5C stem in our model. SL5A (nts 171-225) was identical to the stem-loop The leader core TRS region spans nts 60-72. The blue channel represents the modification reaction extended with the FAM-labeled primer; the green channel represents the control reaction with DMSO extended with the JOE-labeled primer; the red channel is the sequencing reaction with ddA terminator, displaying a U ladder, and the ROX-labeled primer. The gray channel is empty. The vertical axis, labeled SHAPE reactivity, represents fluorescence intensity and the horizontal axis is the elution time aligned to the nucleotide reference sequence (NC_001846). designated as SLIV previously (Brown et al., 2007; Guan et al., 2011) . Furthermore, SL5A is remarkably similar to a stem-loop, predicted and designated SL5 by Chen and Olsthoorn (2010) based upon a structural-phylogenetic analysis of the 5 0 UTRs of betacoronaviruses. SHAPE analysis has also provided biochemical support for SL5B, SL5C, SL6 and SL7 (although we have no SHAPE reactivity data for nts 458-474 in SL7), which, in MHV, previously lacked support from any genetic or biochemical studies. Nucleotides 238-262 and nts 284-309 make up a segment of the bulged stem-loop designated SL5B in our SHAPE-generated model, and correspond to an identical stem-loop structure that was predicted as the basal segment of SLV (nts 238-262 and nts 284-309) for betacoronavirus by Mfold and by covariation analysis (Brown et al., 2007) , and as part of an unnamed stem-loop by a structuralphylogenetic analysis of betacoronavirus (Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010) . The SHAPE-generated model differs from earlier models in that, nts 234-237 are base-paired with nts 314-310 in the base of SL5B but these nucleotides are not included in SLV (Brown et al., 2007) or the corresponding region in Chen model (Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010) . Moreover, the structure predicted by SHAPE analysis for nts 263-283 in the terminal part of SL5B agrees with that predicted by the Chen model (Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010) , but is different from the stemloop predicted for the terminal portion of SLV by Brown et al. (2007) . BCoV SLV (nts 239-310) is also supported by RNase structure probing 18-457 (underlined) were obtained by combining data from the analyses with the two primers. We did not obtain reliable results for the 5 0 -most 17 nts and 3 0 end nts 458-474. The nucleotide positions in MHV-A59 genome and their corresponding nucleotide sequences are shown in the horizontal axis. (Brown et al., 2007) . SL5C (nts 315-334) is similar to the distal part of SLVI predicted by Brown et al. (2007) and to the corresponding region in the Chen model (Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010) . BCoV SLVI has been identified as a cis-acting element required for DI RNA replication (Brown et al., 2007) . The SHAPE-generated SL6 (nts 376-446) is remarkably similar to SLVIII, predicted by Mfold for betacoronavirus (Brown et al., 2007) , but there is no previous structural or functional evidence to support this prediction.
