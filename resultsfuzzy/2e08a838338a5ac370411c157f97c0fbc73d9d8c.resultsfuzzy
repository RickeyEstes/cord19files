The allelic and genotype frequencies of the DC-SIGN and L-SIGN neck-region tandem repeats in the 351 TB patients and 360 healthy controls are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Both patients and controls, which are ethnically matched, belong to the South African Coloured population. It is worth mentioning that population stratification between the two study groups, a situation that can lead to spurious associations, was excluded in a previous study by analyzing the entire cohort for a panel of 25 independent genomewide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers [23] . When examining the allelic frequencies of repeat units for DC-SIGN and L-SIGN neck regions, no statistical differences were observed between TB cases and healthy controls ( Table 1 ). In the case of DC-SIGN, the 7-repeat allele was by far the most frequently observed, with a frequency of more than 98%. As to L-SIGN, the 7-repeat and the 6-repeat alleles account for more than 80% of the overall diversity. We next examined whether the frequency distributions of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN neck-region genotypes were significantly distorted between cases and controls. Again, no significant differences were detected between diseased individuals and healthy controls for both DC-SIGN and L-SIGN. In regard to DC-SIGN, low genotypic variation was observed in accordance with the allelic data. The 7/7 genotype accounted for nearly all genetic variation (more than 96%), and genotypes 7/4, 7/5, 7/6, and 7/8 were observed at very low frequencies ( Table 2 ). For L-SIGN, the genotypes 7/7 and 7/6 were present at similar frequencies (30 -36%), followed by 7/5 (ϳ12%), 6/6 (ϳ6%), 6/5 (ϳ5%), and 9/7 (ϳ4%). The results of the present study indicate that the number of repeats of the DC-SIGN and L-SIGN neck regions does not seem to influence the host susceptibility to develop TB. In the case of DC-SIGN, our results are in agreement with a recent case-control study in a cohort of northwestern Colombian origin [36] . In this report, the authors analyzed DC-SIGN neck-region variation in a cohort of 110 tuberculosis patients and 299 matched controls, and observed no statistical differences between the two study groups. Thus, both studies support the notion that length variation of the DC-SIGN neck region does not influence the host susceptibility to develop TB. In the context of other infectious diseases, the only positive association published so far between DC-SIGN neck-region variation and susceptibility to infectious disease is restricted to HIV-1 infection [29] . In this study, the authors observed an excess of heterozygous individuals for DC-SIGN tandem-repeats in a group of repeatedly-exposed seronegative individuals as compared to the groups of HIV-1 seronegative and HIV-1 seropositive individuals. These observations were interpreted as heterozygosity in the DC-SIGN neck region being associated with reduced susceptibility to HIV-1 infection [29] . At the level of the general population, it is of interest that the DC-SIGN neck region exhibits very low levels of polymorphism [9, 28] . Indeed, we recently screened the entire Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP-CEPH panel), which is composed of more than 1,000 control individuals from 52 different ethnic groups, for repeat variation in the neck regions of both DC-SIGN and L-SIGN [28] . For DC-SIGN, we observed that the 7-repeat allele accounts for nearly all genetic variation (ϳ99%), and that the other alleles, which range from 2-10 repeats, are present at very low frequencies. In addition, the levels of sequence variation in the entire DC-SIGN coding-region, particularly of those that affect amino-acid identity, were found to be extremely low [28] . The low levels of genetic variation observed in the DC-SIGN coding region are also reflected in the context of disease association studies. Indeed, the different associations published so far between DC-SIGN genetic variation and susceptibility to infectious diseases always involve polymorphisms in the DC-SIGN promoter region, and not in its coding region [23, 37, 38] . For example, we have previously shown that the combination of two DC-SIGN promoter variants (Ϫ871G and Ϫ336A) is associated with a reduced risk of developing TB in the same South African cohort analyzed here [23] . Furthermore, the genetic variation in DC-SIGN that has been associated with protection against parenteral HIV-1 infection [37] and with the severity of dengue pathogenesis [38] also involves polymorphisms (i.e. Ϫ336A/G) restricted to the DC-SIGN promoter region. Taken together, all these studies support the view that it is the variation in the amount of DC-SIGN protein being produced that can influence infectious disease susceptibility, and not differences in the DC-SIGN protein itself or variation in its neck region. Our study presents the first investigation of the role of L-SIGN neck-region variation in susceptibility to TB. A number of studies have already explored possible correlations between L-SIGN neck-region variation and susceptibility to other infectious diseases [30 -32, 39] . For example, the L-SIGN tandem-repeat 7/5 genotype has been recently associated with an increased protection against HIV-1 infection in high risk individuals [30] . However, this association remains controversial because a previous study failed to detect such an association [39] . In the context of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a study comparing the frequency distribution of L-SIGN neck-region polymorphisms in a group of infected patients with noninfected individuals failed to demonstrate any statistical difference between the two study groups [32] . However, the same authors did observe an association between neck-region polymor- phisms and individual HCV viral loads, and suggested that length variation in the L-SIGN neck region affects HCV replication efficacy. Finally, a recent study focusing on susceptibility to SARS infection has shown that individuals who are homozygous for L-SIGN neckregion repeats are better protected against SARS infection [31] . However, our results clearly indicate that the L-SIGN neck-region allele/genotype frequencies are not statistically different between TB patients and healthy controls in our large South African cohort (Tables 1 and 2) . Thus, our data seem to exclude length variation in the L-SIGN neck region as a factor influencing TB susceptibility. More generally, our study clearly illustrates the advantages of using admixed populations in the context of disease association studies. Indeed, the South African Coloured population represents a present-day homogenous population who originated from the variable admixture of different populations, such as African Khoisan and Bantu-speakers, Malaysians, Indians, and Europeans [40, 41] . Consequently, the South African Coloured population presents a large degree of genetic diversity, resulting in a high number of alleles or genotype combinations that can be used in association studies. For example, the L-SIGN genotypes 6/5, 7/5, and 9/7 are observed at relatively high frequencies among the South Africans (providing evidence for the genetic input received from European and Asian populations), whereas they are rare or even absent in other subSaharan African populations [28] . The presence of these genotypes in the South African population offers a unique opportunity for testing their association with disease in a single population, a hypothesis that would be difficult to test in other African populations because these genotypes are found at a very low frequency, or are even absent. In summary, our results show that the length of the neck regions of both DC-SIGN and L-SIGN are not associated with an increased or decreased host susceptibility to develop TB, at least in our South African cohort. These data are in contrast with other disease association studies where the tandem-repeat polymorphisms of DC-SIGN and/or L-SIGN seem to contribute to different susceptibilities to HIV-1 and SARS infections, and to the HCV replication efficacy [29 -32] .
