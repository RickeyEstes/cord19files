Here we define three types of viral relationships between different cypoviruses and their hypenopteran hosts. These are: (1) Non-pathogenic, commensal virus: a reovirus that occurs and replicates in a wasp population and may be found in association with others types of viruses. (2) Putative mutualistic virus: a reovirus present routinely in a wasp population in association with others viruses, but which does not appear to play a major role in the host/parasitoid relationship. (3) Mutualistic virus: a reovirus present routinely in the wasp population that is not associated with other viruses, and contributes markedly to parasitic success. They are not symbiotic viruses like PDV because they can be replaced by other types of viruses.
