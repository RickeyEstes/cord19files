A. Quantifying the spatial and temporal evolution of the disease incidence. One of the main characteristics of the COVID19 disease is its long latency times. Currently, the average incubation period has been reported to be 5.2 [13] . Thus, before proceeding with the evaluating the impact of the disease, we .

To do so, we use the random-walk effective distance where P (j|j) is the normalized flow matrix without row and column j, p(j) is the j-column of P with element j removed and δ is a dimensionless parameter that depends on the infection, recovery and mobility rates [14] . This quantity, defined for SIR metapopulation models, gives us the expected time that it would take for the disease to reach each subpopulation of the system, also known as the hitting time. In Figure 3 , we compare the hitting time obtained from stochastic simulations of the SEIR metapopulation model with the theoretical distances derived for the simplified SIR model. We can see that the correlation is nearly perfect, implying that the spreading itself is quite similar in both models. However, we find that the hitting times in the SEIR implementation are at least two times larger than the theoretical ones for the SIR scenario (on its turn, stochastic simulations of the SIR model agree very well with the theoretical expectations for the model, see appendix C). Thus, the addition of the latent state produces a substantial delay on the spreading of the epidemic. This is in line with the fact that the epidemic is thought to have started in mid-November or early December, however, a noticeable number of cases was only reported by early January. Figure 4 shows the expected hitting time for each province when the disease starts from 5 different locations, as well as one case with seeds in multiple places, as obtained from the SEIR metapopulation model. As before, the hitting times might seem long, but this is due to the long latent periods of the disease, in agreement with the evolution of reported cases in mainland China. We also note that Spanish major cities are expected to be affected by the outbreak in no more than 40 days −but often within 20 days− from the initial time in all the situations considered. Indeed, to mimic the situation in the country as of February 28th, 2020, and to make projections about the evolution of the disease into the future, we considered the scenario in which the model is initialized with infected individuals in the capital of each region where there are cases of COVID19: Madrid, Tenerife, Barcelona, Balearic Islands, Zaragoza, Seville and Valencia [15] . The results show that the spreading is much faster (note that the outer circle in the 5 individual provinces represents 60 days while in this case it represents only 40 days) in such a situation. Complementarily to Figure 4 , we present in Figure 5 further results on the temporal and spatial evolution of the disease dynamics. Here we have computed, through stochastic simulations of the model, the cumulative number of infected individuals within each region assuming that the disease propagates from Barcelona by 10 initially infected individuals. The results align with the theoretical predictions, and highlight the close relationship that exists between the two biggest cities of Spain (Barcelona and Madrid), even though they are relatively far geographically (around 620 kilometers through the shortest path by car). Again, note that the relative slow speed of the epidemic agrees with what has been observed in China. Finally, it is worth remarking that all of these quantities have been obtained assuming that no control measures are taken, which is not the current case as (detected) infected individuals are being isolated and monitored by the authorities. Additionally, we also stress that it is difficult to assess whether this corresponds to a worst-case projection or not, given the many unknowns that can't be taken into account, such as inflow of infected subjects from abroad, the fraction of infectious individuals that have gone undetected, etc. However, as we show next, this data-driven modeling approach do allow to evaluate the effect of customary contention measures. .

As it is not clear yet what are the final disease parameters that affect the predictions about the spreading of the coronavirus, we here provide quantitative evidences that the results reported in the main text still hold for other values of the generation time T g .

Figures 11, 12 and 13 show results obtained for T g = 10 and T g = 12.5. As it can be seen, the previous conclusions hold, and in most of the cases, also quantitatively in terms of relative variation with respect to the scenario in which no measures are implemented.
