To demonstrate that our computational pipeline for drug repositioning can yield reasonably accurate prediction results, we also validated our network-based knowledge mining algorithm ( Figure 1B) using the retrospective data of the two coronaviruses that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and had been relatively well studied in the literature, i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. With the aid of our developed text mining tool BERE, we found that many of the drugs that had been reported previously in the literature to have antiviral activities against the corresponding coronavirus, were also among the top list of our predicted results ( Table 2) . For example, chloroquine, an FDA-approved drug for treating malaria [7] , which was previously reported to exhibit micromolar anti-SARS-CoV activity in vitro [8] , was also repurposed for targeting the same virus by our prediction framework. Gemcitabine, which was originally approved for treating certain types of cancers [9] , was also predicted for targeting SARS-CoV with validation by previous in vitro studies [10] . Cyclosporine, a calcineurin inhibitor approved as an immunomodulatory drug [11] , was observed to block the replication of SARS-CoV [12] , and also successfully predicted by our approach. Among the predicted top list for MERS-CoV, miltefosine, which was approved for treating leishmaniasis [13] , was previously identified to have anti-MERS-CoV activity [14] . Chlorpromazine and imatinib, which were used for treating schizophrenia [15] and leukemia [16] , respectively, were also selected by our computational pipeline as anti-MERS-CoV drugs and can be validated by previous in vitro experiments [10] . Thus, the above retrospective study illustrated that our computational framework is able to predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus.
