The federation of St. Kitts and Nevis is a twin island nation in the Lesser Antilles of the Caribbean region with a total human population of âˆ¼55,000 (Map is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Although there are no official estimates on the canine population of St. Kitts, different breeds of domestic dogs, including a local island breed are kept as pets in many households on the island. Diarrhea, including hemorrhagic gastroenteritis is prevalent in domestic dogs on St. Kitts, as evident from clinical cases that are presented now and then at the two major veterinary clinics (the Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine Clinic [RVC] , and the Ponds Veterinary Clinic [PVC]) on the island. In the present study, CPV, or CCoV were detected in 30 (28.8%) of the 104 fecal samples obtained from diarrheic dogs at the two veterinary clinics on St. Kitts (Table 1) .
