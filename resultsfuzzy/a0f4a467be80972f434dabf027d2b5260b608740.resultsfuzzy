We propose herein, for the first time, a QSRR-perturbation model able to predict variations in the propensity of a peptide to act as B-epitope taking into consideration the propensity of a peptide of reference and the changes in peptide sequence, immunological process, host organism, source organisms, and the experimental technique used. The first input term is the value ( ) ref is the scoring function of the efficiency of the initial process (known solution). The function ( ) ref = 1 if the th peptide could experimentally be demonstrated to be a B-epitope in the assay of reference (reference) carried out in the conditions , ( ) ref = 0 otherwise. The variational-perturbation terms ΔΔ are at the same time terms typical of perturbation theory and moving average (MA) functions used in Box-Jenkin models in time series [60] . These new types of terms account both for the deviation of the electronegativity of all amino acids in the sequence of the new peptide with respect to the peptide of reference and with respect to all boundary conditions. In Table 1 , we give the overall classification results obtained with this model. Speck-Planche et al. [61] [62] [63] introduced different multitarget/multiplexing QSAR models that incorporate this type of information based on MAs. The results obtained with the present model are excellent compared with other similar models in the literature useful for other problems including moving average models [64, 65] or perturbation models [58] . Notably, this is also the first model combining both perturbation theory and MAs in a QSPR context. The other input terms are the following. The first Δ and ( ) for all new and reference peptides in IEDB that are epitopes under the th or th boundary condition. The values of these terms have been tabulated for >500 source organisms, >50 host organisms, >10 biological process, and >30 experimental techniques. We must substitute the values of ( ) and ( ) of the new and reference peptides and the tabulated values of * ( ) and * ( ) for all combinations of boundary conditions to predict the perturbations of the action as epitope of peptides. In doing so we can found the optimal sequence and boundary conditions towards the use of the peptide in the development of a vaccine. In Table 2 we give some of these values of * ( ) and * ( ). In Table 3 we depict the sequences and input-output boundary conditions for top perturbations present in IEDB. All these perturbations have observed value of ( ) new = 1 and predicted value also equal to 1 with a high probability. See Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi .org/10.1155/2014/768515 file contains a full list of >200,000 cases of perturbations.
