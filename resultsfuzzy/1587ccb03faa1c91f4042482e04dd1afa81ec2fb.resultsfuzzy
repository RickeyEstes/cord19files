To investigate the serologic relationships between PEDV and PdCV, we prepared high quality porcine-origin PEDV and PdCVspecific polyclonal antibodies. Cross reactivity was first explored using a virus-serum neutralization (VN) assay. For this, PEDV or PdCV-specific VN titers were determined using a plaque reduction neutralization assay. As shown in Table 1 , the VN titer of four PdCV sera ranged from 382 to 544 and no VN titer was detected in PEDV and control sera when PdCV was used as antigens. Thus, only PdCV immune serum neutralized infectivity of PdCV; neither control sera nor PEDV specific antisera neutralized PdCV. A similar homologous relationship was found when PdCV serum was tested for neutralizing activity against PEDV; cross-neutralizations were not observed. The PEDV-specific VN titer of four PEDV-infected piglets ranged from 230 to 256, and no PEDV-specific VN titer was detected in PdCV and control sera. Serum cross-reactivity was also measured by standard ELISA. Ninety-six-well plates were coated with 50 ml of highly purified PEDV or PdCV (2.5 mg/ml). Individual serum samples were tested for PEDV or PdCV-specific IgG on viral antigen-coated plates. Interestingly, PEDV antigen had an obvious cross-reactivity with all tested PdCV sera (Table 1) . Three out of four PdCV sera had an ELISA titer of 80, and one PdCV sera had a titer of 40, when PEDV was used as the coating antigen. Similarly, PdCV antigen had a detectable cross-reactivity with all PEDV-immune sera (Table 1) . Two out of four PEDV sera had an ELISA titer of 80, and two PEDV sera had a titer of 40, when PdCV was used as the coating antigen. In all cases, sera from control piglets were negative for ELISA titer (<20). Thus, a two-way cross-reactivity between PEDV and PdCV was detected by ELISA. The above results clearly demonstrated that two-way crossreactivity of PEDV and PdCV was detectable by ELISA but not VN assay. To address the possible reasons contributed to this difference, we decided to perform additional serological assays. Serologic cross-reactivity was next determined by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) in virus-infected cells. Confluent ST cells were infected with PEDV VBS2 strain or PdCV Michigan/8977/2014 strain at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0. At 24 h post-infection, the cells were fixed and reacted with PEDV or PdCV polyclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A , strong fluorescent signals were detected in PEDV-infected ST cells whereas no signal was detected in PdCV-infected or mock-infected ST cells when stained with PEDV polyclonal antibody. Similarly, strong fluorescent signals were detected in PdCV-infected ST cells whereas no signal was detected in PEDV-infected or mock-infected ST cells when stained with PdCV polyclonal antibody. Thus, no cross-reactivity was detected by IFA. Cross-reactivity was also determined in virus-infected intestinal tissues. Twelve Gn piglets were divided into three groups (n = 4) and housed in three separate isolators. Gn piglets in group 1 and 2 were orally inoculated with 10 4 PFU of PEDV VBS2 and PdCV Michigan/8977/2014 strain respectively. The remaining four piglets in group 3 were orally inoculated with DMEM as controls. As expected, PEDV and PdCV-inoculated Gn piglets developed severe watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration at 24 h postinoculation. These two viruses caused indistinguishable clinical signs in gnotobiotic piglets. However, PEDV caused more severe diseases than PdCV in gnotobiotic piglets. 72 h post-inoculation, piglets inoculated with PEDV reached 20% body weight losses. Thus, all piglets were terminated at this time point. Replicate sections of duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon were subjected to immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. In tissue sections, anti-PdCV antibody reacted only with virus-infected intestinal epithelial cells (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) in tissue sections collected from PdCV-infected Gn piglets and not with either PEDV-infected or uninfected control tissue sections (Fig. 1B , Table 2 ). In a similar fashion, the PEDV-specific antibody reacted only with PEDVinfected tissue sections. No cross-reactivity was detected by IHC ( Fig. 1B , Table 2 ). The cross reactivity detected by serum ELISA promoted us to perform further analyses. Next, we sought to determine whether anti-PEDV or anti-PdCV antibodies can cross-react with purified PEDV and PdCV virion proteins. For this, 2 mg of purified PEDV and PdCV was analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot using commercially available monoclonal PEDV and PdCV nucleocapsid (N)-specific antibody (Medgene Labs, Brookings, SD). PEDV N (49.0 kDa) and PdCV N proteins (37.0 kDa) were detected by PEDV and PdCV N monoclonal antibody, respectively; and no cross-reactivity was observed ( Fig. 2A) . A similar Western blot was performed using either anti-PEDV or anti-PdCV polyclonal antibody raised in Gn piglets. As shown in Fig. 2B , PEDV antibody reacted strongly with PEDV proteins. Interestingly, a protein band with molecular weight corresponding to PdCV nucleocapsid (N) protein was detected by anti-PEDV antibody. Similarly, anti-PdCV antibody had a strong reaction with PdCV proteins but also reacted with PEDV N protein. Thus, a two-way of cross reactivity in N proteins between PEDV and PdCV was detected, a finding consistent with the cross-reactivity detected by ELISA. The results of ELISA and Western blot suggest that N protein is responsible for the two-way cross-reactivity. Thus, we performed a sequence alignment of N proteins of selected PEDV and PdCV strains. It was found that four regions , and 329-EWD-332) are conserved between PEDV and PdCV ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). These regions likely contain the N protein epitopes that account for the cross-reaction observed between these two viruses in both ELISA and Western blot assays. Porcine coronaviruses are significant enteric and respiratory pathogens of swine. In 1946, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), an Alphacoronavirus (a-CoV), was identified as the cause of a devastating enteric disease of pigs in the United States (Doyle and Hutchings, 1946) . A second US porcine a-CoV, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) was officially identified in 1984 (Wesley et al., 1990) . PRCV is a deletion mutant of TGEV that alters viral tropism from intestinal to respiratory epithelia. In 1971, a new a-CoV, PEDV was first identified in the United Kingdom (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978) . In 2014, a porcine Deltacoronavirus, PdCV was characterized in the US . TGEV, PEDV, and PdCV replicate in small intestinal enterocytes causing life-threatening acute enteric disease in suckling piglets. Currently, the antigenic relationship among these porcine enteric coronaviruses is still  A Gn piglets were immunized intramuscularly twice (two weeks apart) with 0.3 mg of inactivated PEDV or PdCV antigen. For antigen preparation, 1.2 mg of purified PEDV and PdCV stocks were inactivated by 0.05% formalin, and mixed with 3 ml of Alhydrogel aluminum Hydroxide Gel Adjuvant in 1 ml of PBS. The control piglets were immunized with 1 ml of adjuvant alone. Sera were collected from PEDV antigen, PdCV antigen, or mocked-inoculated Gn piglets at week 4 postimmunization and were heat inactivated at 56 C for 30 min. B Virus-serum neutralizing antibody titer was determined by a plaque reduction neutralization assay using PEDV or PdCV. Data are average of three independent VN assay. Value within a column followed by the different lowercase letters (a and b) are significantly different (P < 0.05). C Serum IgG titer was determined by ELISA using purified PEDV or PdCV as coated antigens. poorly understood. Recently, it was reported that no crossneutralization was observed between TGEV and PEDV despite the fact that both of them belong to Alphacoronavirus (Lin et al., 2015) . Interestingly, one-way cross-reactions were observed between TGEV Miller strain hyperimmune pig antisera and PEDV strains using a cell culture immunofluorescent (CCIF) assay (Lin et al., 2015) . Specifically, PEDV antigens can be detected using hyperimmune TGEV Miller antiserum. Sequence analysis suggested at least one epitope on the N-terminal region of PEDV/TGEV N protein that contributed to this cross-reactivity (Lin et al., 2015) . Our study is the first study to systemically assess the antigenic relationship between PEDV and PdCV, both of which are currently prevalent in the US. We found that no virus neutralization crossreactivity was observed between PEDV and PdCV. Interestingly, a two-way of cross-reactivity was detected between PEDV and PdCV despite the fact that they belong to two different coronavirus genera. Our study contributes to our understanding of the antigenic relationship among porcine coronaviruses and will facilitate the development of more specific serological diagnostic assays and effective vaccines to control PEDV and PdCV outbreaks.
