Crystal structure of PRRSV endoribonuclease nsp11. Previous studies demonstrated that full-length wild-type endoribonucleases (SARS-CoV nsp15, MHV nsp15, EAV nsp11, and PRRSV nsp11) are expressed only weakly; accordingly, these endoribonucleases may be toxic to E. coli and cause slow cell growth and low protein yields (20, 21, 23) . Thus, to obtain wild-type nsp11, we assessed different expression vectors and used different E. coli strains as hosts; nevertheless, the yield of wild-type nsp11 remained extremely low. Indeed, our experimental results showed that wild-type nsp11 causes cell cytotoxicity and death after an extended expression time (approximately 3 h). The duration of wild-type nsp11 expression was examined at different times (0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, and 90 min) at 37°C, with 60 min found to be the best expression time (data not shown). The yields of wild-type nsp11 from the expression vectors [pET-42b (ϩ) and pET-30a (ϩ)] were estimated to be approximately 0.05 mg and 0.2 mg of protein, respectively, per liter of bacterial cell culture. In contrast, the yield of mutant protein reached approximately 5 to 6 mg/liter (37°C, 5 h). Previous studies indicated that functional endoribonucleases can cleave the 3= terminus of the pyrimidines of ssRNA and dsRNA substrates (18, 20) , which might act on both their own and cellular mRNA and cause NendoU expression to be potentially "suicidal" (7) . The crystal structure of PRRSV nsp11 (residues Gly1 to Glu223) was determined using the SAD method and was refined to 2.75-Å resolution, which was of sufficient quality to trace the entire chain (excluding the C-terminal His 6 tags). The Matthews coefficient and solvent content are 2.99 and 58%, respectively, as determined by cell content analysis. The solvent content value is high, which may explain why the diffraction of the crystals was poor. The crystal belongs to the space group P4 1 2 1 2 and consists of two subunits in an asymmetric unit (Fig. 1B) . Interestingly, subunit A is visibly different from subunit B (Fig. 1C , D, and E). In subunit B, residues in the regions Asp134-Gly141, Ser166-Lys173, and Leu222-Glu223 could not be traced due to a lack of interpretable electron density (Fig. 1C) . The crystal structure can be divided into two major parts: the N-terminal domain (NTD; Gly1 to Phe90) and the C-terminal catalytic domain (Arg107 to Glu223). The NTD is formed by six ␤-strands (␤1 to ␤6) and two ␣-helices (␣1 to ␣2) and is connected to the catalytic domain through a linker domain (LKD; Val91 to Thr106). The catalytic domain has a typical fold consisting of a compact groove region containing sequentially connected left and right parts (Fig. 1A) : the left part of the catalytic domain consists of two ␣-helices (␣3 and ␣4) and six ␤-strands (␤7 to ␤12), and the right part is formed by three antiparallel ␤-strands (␤13 to ␤15) and one ␣-helix (␣5). Details of the data collection and structure refinement are summarized in Table 1 . Mutational studies in the dimerization interface. In this study, gel filtration chromatography revealed the dimeric architecture of nsp11. Our data indicated that nsp11 eluted primarily in one peak; the calculated molecular mass is approximately 58.9 kDa, which corresponds to a dimer (Fig. 2C, D, and E) . This finding is consistent with the dimeric crystal structure of nsp11 (Fig.  1B) . The dimerization interface is shown in Fig. 2A and B. Residues Gly1, Leu54, Arg55, Tyr69, Ser74, Phe76, Gly137, Gly138, Arg153, Val165, and Ser166 were chosen as candidate targets to abolish the dimerization. The mutant (G1A, L54A, R55A, Y69A, G137A, G138A, V165A, and S166A) proteins eluted as a dimer; these mutations could not prevent nsp11 dimerization (data not shown). However, elution of the mutant (S74A and F76A) proteins by gel filtration yielded two 280-nm absorption peaks ( Fig.  2D and E). Our results indicated that these two mutations significantly disrupt the dimerization in solution. Moreover, the R153A mutant existed mainly as an intermediate form (the calculated molecular mass is approximately 48.8 kDa) compared with the wild type ( Fig. 2D and E) . Meanwhile, the oligomerization of wildtype and mutant (S74A, F76A, and R153A) nsp11 proteins was further analyzed via sedimentation analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), and the results were shown in Fig. 2F and G. The molecular weights of monomers and dimers from the wild-type nsp11 protein are approximately 29.2 (approximately 14.04% of the total population) and 63.7 (approximately 86.67%) and are essentially consistent with those of gel filtration chromatography. The sedimentation coefficient (S 20,W ) of the mutant (S74A, F76A, and R153A) proteins decreased significantly compared with the wild type, though the relative populations of monomers and dimers of those mutant proteins were not successfully determined. This indicated that the oligomerization of the mutant proteins had markedly changed. Therefore, our biochemical data consistently showed that nsp11 exists mainly as a dimer in solution and that the mutations in the dimerization interface, S74A, F76A, and R153A, disrupt dimerization. In our crystal structure, a total binding surface of 1,309 Å 2 is buried at the interface (Fig. 3A) , which is smaller than the subunit A-subunit B binding surface of SARS-CoV nsp15, which is 2,253.3 Å 2 (Fig. 3C) . Regardless, this smaller binding surface may be sufficient to stabilize monomer-monomer interactions because the molecular weight of nsp11 (approximately 25.6) is lower than that of SARS-CoV nsp15 (approximately 38.5). In addition, the catalytic domain of subunit A and the NTD of subunit B are associated with a largely hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding network ( Fig.  2A and B) . A total of 16 residues in the NTD of subunit B interact with 17 residues in the catalytic domain of subunit A. Residue Phe76 interacts with residues Tyr150, Leu151, Pro152, Gly164, Val165, and Ser166 via the hydrophobic forces ( Fig. 2A  and B) ; thus, Phe76 is a key residue within the dimer interface. Moreover, residue Ser74 interacts with residues Pro152, Val163, and Gly164 and is thus also a key residue within the dimer interface ( Fig. 2A and B ). In addition, interactional residues Leu77, Val110, and Cys112 were also observed with residue Arg153 ( Fig. 2A and B) . Therefore, these mutations (S74A, F76A, and R153A) may disturb both hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions between monomers and prevent the formation of stable dimers. To clarify the relationship between dimerization and catalytic activity, we performed FRET assays using fluorescence-labeled RNA as the substrate. As predicted, the activity levels of the mutants (S74A and F76A) were significantly decreased (being at least 4-fold less than wild-type levels) but not completely abolished (see Fig. 7C ) because the mutant proteins were not purely monomeric. In addition, gel filtration chromatography revealed that the 280-nm absorption peak of the mutant S74A protein was obviously lower than that of the mutant F76A protein with the same amount of total protein ( Fig. 2D and E) , which indicated that the mutant S74A protein is very unstable. This may be the reason why the NendoU activity of the S74A mutant is lower than that of the F76A mutant. In conclusion, the S74A and F76A mutations severely diminished the catalytic activity, indicating that the dimer is the biologically functional unit. The structural basis for nsp11 functioning as a dimer rather than a hexamer. Our crystal structure indicates that nsp11 assembles into dimers, which is different from coronavirus nsp15 (19, 21) . The monomer structure of SARS-CoV nsp15 includes three domains, the N-terminal domain (NTD), the middle domain, and the catalytic domain (23) (Fig. 3C) ; the NTD is critical for hexamsites are shown. (B) Detailed molecular interactions of the supporting loop (subunit A, magenta) with the active site loop (subunit A, red) and the N-terminal domain (subunit B, red) were determined using LIGPLOT. Hydrogen bond interactions and hydrophobic interactions are shown as described for Fig. 2A. (C) Surface representation of hexameric SARS-CoV nsp15 (PDB code 2RHB). The individual subunits are colored and marked A to F. The active site loop (residues His234 to His249) and the supporting loop (residues Lys276 to IIe295) are highlighted as described for panel A. The description of SARS-CoV nsp15 domains is based on a previous report (23) . The monomer-monomer buried surface areas of PRRSV nsp11 and SARS-CoV nsp15 were analyzed using PDBePISA.
