Forty disaster care experts were randomly selected from the editorial boards of the American Journal of Disaster Medicine (AJDM) and Disaster Medicine Public Health and Preparedness (DMPHP) using a random number generator (Minitab, State College, PA). This sample included physicians, public health officials, researchers, pathologists, first responders, and military personnel. Four Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the survey.

Of the 40 disaster medicine experts surveyed, 25 responses were received, giving a response rate of 62%. The respondents included 8 physicians (32%), 9 public health officials/hospital managers (36%), 3 pathologists (12%), and 5 emergency room doctors (20%). given clinical settings. The results showed that in disaster settings, respondents showed a significant preference for handheld diagnostics (Fig. 2 ) and cited increased portability and versatility as the rationale. When respondents were asked to choose between a device that tests multiple patient samples in parallel for a single pathogen versus a device that performs multiplex testing of several pathogens for a single patient sample (Fig. 3) , respondents preferred a multiplex test in the urgent care and emergency room settings (Fig. 4) . Participants cited the need to quickly screen a large volume of patients in a disaster setting, whereas a full workup is necessary in urgent care and emergency room settings. Several of the respondents who chose the device that parallel processes multiple patient samples for a single pathogen given a disaster setting, referenced biothreat or pandemic scenarios. Fig. 5 shows 2 different sample collection methods, a test cassette and vacutainer. A test cassette provides a housing platform in which one can automate preanalytical processing steps that are critical to subsequent analytical steps that follow on the POC device. Fig. 6 reflects general acceptance of test cassettes in disaster, urgent care, and emergency settings. Various POCT devices that test for a variety of analytes and pathogens are used during disaster and emergency situations, such as Hurricane Katrina. Emergency medical responders, disaster medical assistance teams (DMATs), international medicalsurgical response teams (IMSuRTs), and other first responders deploy to disaster sites carrying POCT devices. 6 They use POCT devices to test, rapidly diagnose, and, as indicated, treat victims. 6 Depending on where responders are deployed, the pathogens they encounter will vary, possibly unpredictably and unexpectedly. Table 3 7-32 documents the variety of pathogens present in several modern disasters, such as flooding, hurricanes, and earthquakes. When comparing the top 10 pathogens identified by preliminary needs assessment survey results in various disaster scenarios (see Table 2 ) with pathogens found in major disasters, there was substantial overlap. During Hurricane Katrina, for example, various pathogens were identified that also were selected and ranked by experts and surveyed as high priority for general disaster, blood donor screening, bloodstream pathogen, and pandemic test clusters. Specifically, in Table 2 for the general disaster scenario and in Table 3 for Hurricane Katrina, there is overlap for Vibrio cholerae, MRSA, and Escherichia coli. Thus, preliminary survey results demonstrate that survey experts identified pathogens encountered at disaster sites (see Table 3 ) as important for having POCT devices capable of detecting these organisms (see Table 2 ). A similar finding was observed when comparing pathogens detected at the tsunami disaster site in Southeast Asia (see Table 3 ) versus the general disaster and bloodstream pathogen test clusters ranked highly in Table 2 . Survey results identified several pathogens in the general disaster and bloodstream pathogen test clusters, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MRSA, and Salmonella species. These pathogens also were detected at tsunami disaster
