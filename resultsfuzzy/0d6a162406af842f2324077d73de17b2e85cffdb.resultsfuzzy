When a signal was detected, it was considered as positive. The interpretation of the results obtained by each kit was validated with the acknowledgement of the corresponding supplier. The respective sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and agreement (as evaluated by the Cohen kappa coefficient) of each tested kit were calculated by reference to the performances of the Argene/ bioMÃ©rieux duplex tests used as gold standard. Following testing of the 88 samples with the reference method, the number of each pathogen considered to be present in the panel was as depicted in Table 2 . Most pathogens, with the exception of influenza A virus, were frequently associated with at least another pathogen. The performances of each kit are summarized in Table 3 for viruses and in Table 4 for bacteria.
