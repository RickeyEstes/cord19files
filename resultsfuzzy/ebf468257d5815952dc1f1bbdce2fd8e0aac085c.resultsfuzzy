Besides, among the independent variables, political ties (P_TIE), ownership type (O_TYP) and industrial type (I_TYP) are significantly associated with firm size (ln SIZE), and ownership type (O_TYP) are significantly related to industrial type (I_TYP). The coefficients may suggest that there may be slight collinearity problem. Therefore, in the following regression analysis we put the independent variables into the model one by one. Meanwhile, the values of Tolerance and VIF (variance inflation factor) are also calculated. In order to further test the hypotheses proposed formerly, multiple regression analyses are conducted by using Ordinary least square (OLS) as method and SPSS (16.0 edition) as tool. We first test the effects of controlled variables on dependent variable (corporate philanthropic giving). Following that we add the four independent variables into the model step by step. Finally, we put all the variables into the model. Table 4 reports the results of regression analysis. From Model (1) we can find that the two control variables have a significant effect on corporate philanthropic giving. Both the effects of profitability and leverage are positive. From Model (2) to Model (5) we can see when the independent variables are put into the model one by one, all variables have a significantly positive effect on corporate philanthropic giving at the level of 0.05 except industrial type (I_TYP). From Model (6) putting all the variables into the model, the direction and significance of some variables changed. This may indicate that some significant interactions exist among the variables. According to the rule of thumb in the econometric literature (a VIF N10 or a tolerance level b0.1 are signs of severe multicollinearity problems), there is no significant collinear relationships among these independent variables. According to Model (6), the F value (=41.558) is significant (p b 0.01) and adjusted R 2 is 0.490, which indicates that the combination of these variables can explain about 49% of the variance of the level of corporate philanthropic giving. Firm size (Ln SIZE) (β = 0.651, p b 0.01) is found to have a significant and positive effect on corporate philanthropic disaster relief giving. This result keeps in line with the findings of many previous research (e.g., Adams and Hardwick, 1998; Buchholtz et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2009) and suggests that large firms do donate more than smaller firms. This finding conforms to our expectation, and thus Hypothesis 1 is supported. Political ties (P_TIE) (β = 0.258, p b 0.01) is found to be significantly and positively associated with corporate philanthropic disaster relief giving. This finding is in line with our expectation and suggests that companies who have political ties donate more than those companies who do not have political ties. Therefore, Hypothesis 2 is supported. Ownership type (O_TYP) (β = − 0.037, p N 0.05) is found to have a negative but insignificant effect on corporate philanthropic giving. This finding suggests that SOEs donate no more than non SOEs. This result is out of our expectation and thus Hypothesis 2 is not supported. Industry type (I_TYP) (β = −0.136, p b 0.01) has a negative and significant effect on corporate philanthropy. It suggests that service companies donate significantly less than non service companies. The result is contrary to our expectation and thus Hypothesis 3 is refused. Among the control variables, the effect of profitability keeps significant and positive while the effect of leverage changes from significantly positive to insignificantly negative. The results suggest that firms who have high profitability donate more than firms who have lower profitability. Firms who have high leverage donate slightly less than firms who have lower leverage but the extent is not significant.
