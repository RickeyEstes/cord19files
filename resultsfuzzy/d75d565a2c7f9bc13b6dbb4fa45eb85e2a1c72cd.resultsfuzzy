We now demonstrate how the above results can be interpreted with respect to a specific country in the Asia Pacific region. Papua New Guinea (PNG) was chosen as a suitable exemplar for several reasons. The Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases (APSED) data demonstrated generally lower levels of capacity among Pacific Island countries [19] . Although PNG's Human Development Index (HDI) (0.505 in 2014) is slightly higher than that of EVD-affected West African countries (0.411 in Guinea, 0.413 in Sierra Leone and 0.43 in Liberia), it is the lowest ranked country in the Southeast Asia/West Pacific region, and among the lowest ranked countries globally. Therefore, estimates of health care system and population factors relevant to disease transmission are likely to be comparable. The geographic proximity of PNG to Australia and Australia's existing engagement in PNG make it likely that Australia would be called on to support the response to any outbreak in PNG [43] . First, we divided the country into high-level administrative regions (listed in Table 1 ) and used population sizes as reported in the 2011 census [44] . Estimates of hospital bed and health care worker numbers were provided by country experts at the Nossal Institute for Global Health (University of Melbourne, Australia), who suggested that no more than 10% of beds could be used for isolation of EVD cases. We also assumed a (modest) national contact-tracing capacity of 100 contacts per day. We allocated national hospital beds to Port Moresby and distributed remaining beds (regional and provincial hospitals) among the administrative regions in proportion to their population densities, as a proxy for both population size and health care system accessibility. The health care workforce and contact-tracing capacity were allocated among regions in proportion to their designated bed capacities. From these data, we estimate that the Port Moresby region has a medium health care system (almost 0.2% of the population are health care workers), that the Islands region has a small health care system (almost 0.1% are health care workers), and the remaining regions have even less health care infrastructure. While Port Moresby is the largest city in Papua New Guinea and the commercial centre of the country, the vast majority of the population live elsewhere, and country experts at the Nossal Institute also advised that residents of Port Moresby frequently visit friends and relatives in rural regions upon return from international travel. Accordingly, it was judged pertinent to consider the probability of outbreak control in each of the regions. We assumed that the force of infection in the community was twice as high in Port Moresby (highly urbanised population) than in the other regions (with population densities 100 times lower than Port Moresby), and that the average time to burial following death was 3 days, allowing for the return of bodies to the home village for burial. To estimate the case ascertainment proportion in Papua New Guinea, we consulted a variety of data sources and also referred back to the EVD outbreak in West Africa. Despite the high proportion of EVD cases that are symptomatic, early in the West African outbreak it was estimated that only about 40% of all cases sought clinical care [16] . Papua New Guinea has a low HDI ranking similar to those of the West African nations, and faces similar challenges in providing access to and quality of health care services. These challenges include: very few health professionals (less than 1 doctor per 10,000 people), insufficient health workforce in rural areas (more than 80% of medical officers work in urban areas, despite 87.5% of the population living in rural areas), low levels of workforce retention in rural areas (due to remoteness, financial instability, and dangerous environments), limited availability of basic essential medical Table 1 . The administrative regions of Papua New Guinea. We separate Port Moresby (the largest city and national capital) from the rest of the Southern ("Papua") region on the grounds that Port Moresby comprises a much more urbanised population than the rest of the region. supplies, and lack of access to clean water in many facilities [45] . Given these issues of access and provision, we assumed that case ascertainment in Papua New Guinea was unlikely to be higher than in the West African outbreak (40-50%) and, particularly in rural areas, might be substantially lower (10-20%).
