3.1. Some quantified statistical variables about the self-similarity characteristic of different genomes In the above section, Fig. 2 reveals that the main characteristics among genes show clustering features. The genes are clustered into many social structures. These social structures have different scales. Here, as for every genome of Table 1 we calculate some quantified statistical variables. To simplify the description in Table 3 , let N S be the number of social structures. Let N S-genes and P S-genes be the total number of genes in all social structures and their proportion in genome, respectively. Let N LS-genes and P LS-genes be the total number of genes in the largest social structure and their proportion in genome, respectively. Let N LS-links and A LS-links be the total number of links in the largest social structure and the average of links of every gene. From Table 3 we can get some interested conclusions: (i) From the fourth and the fifth column of the table, we find out that the genes clustered into social structures occupy the majority proportion of complete genome. The proportion P S-genes of clustering genes of 17 species in the table are more than 70%. The proportion in Clostridium perfringens 13 has the highest percentage 92%. There are only three species with a percentage less than 60%. These data indicate that most of genes in genome are relatively active in their evolution pathways. As for a genome, it is impossible for point mutation to reach so large social structures. The statistic data give a possible explanation that some genes continuously exchange some segments each other. Perhaps segment reassortment (or recombination) and association in genome, that is to say, are the main evolutionary approaches. (ii) In the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth column of the table, we calculate the statistic information about the largest one in all social structures. The statistic data shows that the genes in the largest social structure occupy the majority proportion of complete genome. The other social structures only occupy a small percentage in genome except for the largest social structure. The statistic data shows that most of genes in genome are associated with each other. The ninth column in the table illustrates the average number of links of every gene in the largest social structure. Obviously, the genes are more active when their links are high. The species with the largest number of connections is Clostridium perfringens 13 in which the average number of links reaches 6.96. The average links can discover the comprehensive trend about relation among different genes. In the following section, we will further reveal more details about the largest social structure such as degree distribution and edge-weight distribution.
