According to the preliminary questionnaire 22 of 30 laboratories regularly examined calf faeces for the presence of C. parvum, whereas the other eight only did so in suspected cases. Twenty laboratories described this parasite as common, nine found it only rarely. Six laboratories considered it to be an important primary pathogen, whereas the others did not. While 18 laboratories thought C. parvum was a common secondary cause of diarrhoea the rest thought it to be rare. Of the 19 laboratories that answered this part of the questionnaire 11 considered the prevalence of cryptosporidia in faecal samples to be <10%, three laboratories thought it to be 10-20%, two 10-50% and three laboratories 20-50%. The results of the routine diagnostic tests are described in Table 1 . Between 19 and 34% of the faecal samples and 20 and 36% of the post mortem cases tested positive for C. parvum, 1993-1997. and in 53 and 43% of these cases, respectively, no other pathogens were detected. In mixed infections C. parvum was most commonly associated with rotavirus (25 and 33%) followed by E. coli (9 and 11%), while other combinations were rare. In Kassel and Bonn where only small numbers of samples were examined the annual prevalence for Cryptosporidium varied between 29 and 54% for faecal samples and 12 and 100% in post mortem examinations. The other laboratories reported annual prevalences of 16-28% in faecal samples and 14-40% in post mortem samples (Fig. 1) .
