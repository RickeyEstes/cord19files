The six strains reported here were not included in the initial report of the CC genomes (Srivastava et al. 2017 ) because of differences in health status and high levels of residual heterozygosity. Three strains (CC078/ TauUnc, CC079/TauUnc and CC080/TauUnc) were quarantined to remove potential pathogens. Five strains (CC078/TauUnc, CC080/ TauUnc, CC081/Unc, CC082/Unc and CC083/Unc) had levels of residual heterozygosity over 10%. Typically, ,10% residual heterozygosity was recommended before distribution of a CC strain independent of residual heterozygosity levels. While not fully inbred, many CC users will find that these new strains are valuable for genetic mapping, validation experiments, and disease modeling because they add haplotypes from underrepresented CC founder strains. Based on the MRCAs, the average residual heterozygosity of the six new strains is 19.9%, compared to 8.0% in the previously released strains. Among all 75 CC strains sequenced, five of the new strains are among the seven least inbred strains. In four of these new strains, over 20% of the genome is segregating in the MRCAs (Table 1) . CC083/Unc has the unique distinction among CC strains, where three haplotypes are segregating at a locus. Specifically, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/ShiLtJ and CAST/ EiJ haplotypes are present in a 17 Mb region on chromosome 15 (31,869,802-58,735,934). All six new strains have haplotype contributions from all eight founders while almost 20% of the previously released strains have only six or seven founders (Table 2) . Overall, three founder haplotypes (A/J, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ) are overrepresented and two (NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HlLtJ) are underrepresented in the six new strains (Table 2) . Importantly, two of the overrepresented founders (CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ) are of non-domesticus origin (Table 1 & 2) . These two founders were underrepresented in the previous report (Srivastava et al. 2017) . We also previously reported that wild derived founder haplotypes were significantly overrepresented in regions of residual heterozygosity in the CC (Srivastava et al. 2017) . We observe the same pattern in the new CC strains where wild-derived haplotypes are enriched in regions of residual heterozygosity (P , 0.0001). The six new CC strains contribute at least one CAST/EiJ or PWK/PhJ haplotype to 62% and 54% of the genome, respectively. This partially relieves the deficit of these underrepresented haplotypes in the CC population. For example, chromosome 5 contains a locus between 127Mb and 137Mb where currently only one CC strain has a CAST/ EiJ founder haplotype (Figure 1) Figure 1 ). These areas have a decreased non-domesticus haplotype frequency on the periphery of the n highlighted area, suggesting selection is acting against those particular haplotypes in the CC. The eight founder strains of the CC have been sequenced at high depth, their variants annotated, and their genome recently de novo assembled (Keane et al. 2011; Doran et al. 2016; Lilue et al. 2018) . Previous genetic variation analyses have used sequence from these founders to infer haplotype specific genetic variation in the CC (Durrant et al. 2011; Ferris et al. 2013; Gralinski et al. 2015; Oreper et al. 2017) . By directly sequencing CC strains, we can define founder specific variants across multiple CC strains sharing a founder haplotype at each locus, and identify strain specific variation unique to a CC strain. We first compared the sequenced samples' GigaMUGA genotypes and confirmed that they are consistent with the corresponding MRCA. Next, we queried variation within identical founder haplotype regions at any given locus across the CC to identify de novo mutations. We identified four unique de novo deletions larger than 500bp in the newly sequenced mice that are not present in the assembled reference genome of the CC founders or in the previous cohort of 69 sequenced CC mice (Table 3 ). Figure 2 shows a 19.8kb deletion in CC079/TauUnc that is predicted to delete the Gm14515 gene. The breakpoints were resolved using msBWTs to locally assemble sequence flanking the deletion. A PCR assay was designed to discriminate between the presence or absence of this deletion, and the deletion was fixed in both the MRCA and the three CC079/ TauUnc mice tested. We conclude that this mutation arose before or during the early CC inbreeding stages. Mutation and genetic drift may cause distinct variation to arise and become fixed in individual CC strains leading to genetic differences between founder strains and their haplotypes in the CC population. To better characterize inbreeding progress in the CC, we performed a colony survey using the newly developed MiniMUGA array to genotype three mice (two females and one male) for 72 CC strains, including the six newly sequenced strains. We selected this sex ratio to sample the Y chromosome in each colony and to increase the X chromosome representation in the analysis. First, we confirmed that all sampled mice had consistent Y and mitochondria with their respective MRCA and sequenced sample. Next, we confirmed that all sampled mice had autosomal genotypes that matched with their respective sequenced sample using 3,295 markers common to MiniMUGA and GigaMUGA ( Figure S1 , Table S2, Table S3 ). We observe that each of the 216 samples most closely match their respective sequenced sample. This set of markers is sufficient to distinguish two closely related CC strains (CC051/TauUnc and CC059/TauUnc) ( Figure S1 ). The colony survey also allows us to estimate current levels of corresponding MRCA ( Figure 3A ). The four clear outliers that have both a high level of current heterozygosity and a small decrease in residual heterozygosity are four of the six new CC strains. We hypothesize that the overrepresentation of non-domesticus haplotypes combined with high initial residual heterozygosity and small number of generations between MRCAs and genotyped samples contributes to the low change in residual heterozygosity. The CC population now has three distinct resources that describe their genomes. The first resource is genotype and haplotype reconstructions for the MRCAs of each CC strain. The second resource is whole genome sequence from a single male for 75 CC strains. The third resource is a colony survey of 72 CC strains using MiniMUGA. On average, 2.4 years separate MRCAs from sequenced samples and three years separate sequenced samples from the colony survey. However, there is considerable variation for the lengths of these periods among CC strains (Table S1 ). These three resources have complementary strengths that can help users of the CC. n The MRCAs, being the most conservative estimate of haplotype composition from the CC colony, are the most robust for genetic mapping, especially when mice were acquired from a wide time range, or sampled from colonies maintained by individual investigators. Users of the CC should be aware that genetic drift has likely fixed regions of residual heterozygosity in the MRCAs, as shown by the MiniMUGA residual heterozygosity analysis ( Figure 3A ). At regions with residual heterozygosity in the MRCAs, experimental mice could have any of the three combinations of the two segregating haplotypes. However, experimental mice will not contain any additional haplotypes not already in the MRCAs. Mapping power will be reduced in analyses where the MRCAs shows residual heterozygosity that is actually fixed in an experimental population, but one of the two haplotypes will be correctly classified. The MRCAs can be accessed through http://csbio.unc.edu/ CCstatus/index.py?run=FounderProbs as genotype probability files for genetic mapping. The probability files are downloadable for each individual MRCA as well as a strain consensus probability file in the GRC mouse build 38. The whole genome sequence from a single male for 75 CC strains is an excellent resource to define consistent founder haplotype specific variants, identify de novo mutations not present in the genomes of the eight CC founder strains, and improve resolution in the transition regions between founder haplotypes. However, attempting to conduct genetic mapping based on the sequenced sample would lead to systemic under-sampling of haplotypes segregating in the SGCF colony. For 51 strains (72% of the sampled CC), the sequenced sample underestimates residual heterozygosity compared to the three more recent samples genotyped in MiniMUGA (Table 1, Figure 3B ). On the other hand, identification of potential causative variants within candidate intervals following genetic mapping should rely on the sequenced CC mice relative to the sequenced founder strains. This alleviates potential differences between the sequences of the founders Figure 2 De novo private deletions in the new CC sequenced strains.

(Keane et al. 2011; Doran et al. 2016; Lilue et al. 2018 ) and the CC (Srivastava et al. 2017) , and includes strain specific variants. We created a search tool for comparing sequence across the CC to provide CC users with easy access to sequence data. The msBWT k-mer search is a fast and user-friendly tool to query any k-mer shorter than read length and returns matching sequence http://www.csbio.unc.edu/ CEGSseq/index.py?run=MsbwtTools. The colony survey of 72 CC strains using the set of 6,293 markers defined in the Materials and Methods is a resource that will allow CC users to confirm the strain ID of their CC mice through genotyping. The genotypes of these strains are available at https://www.med.unc.edu/ mmrrc/genotypes. Using a subset of 3,295 markers that overlap between MiniMUGA and GigaMUGA, we verified that genotypes of these mice were consistent with the sequenced samples and can be used as a comparison resource ( Figure S1 , Table S2, Table S3 ). We recommend that users of the CC preserve tissue samples from all CC mice (and derivatives) used in an experiment. Genetic mapping using genotypes from parental mice (i.e., breeders) would provide the most accurate estimation of current segregating haplotypes for that population. This will also facilitate the correction of potential errors in mouse identity, and serve as a validation of key resources. Our colony sampling of the CC at the SGCF highlights that residual heterozygosity is decreasing, but still present. For experiments where residual heterozygosity could disrupt analysis (i.e. vQTL mapping studies, F 2 mapping studies, recombinant inbred crosses), accurate analyses and interpretation of experimental results will likely benefit from genotyping individual experimental animals to ensure accurate haplotype assignment. Residual heterozygosity may also influence genetic mapping and the presence of QTL, if only one of the two haplotypes at a locus influences a trait (Rogala et al. 2014) . QTL that have residual heterozygosity may be a double-edged sword. Fixation of a haplotype (or population subsampling) may impede experimental replication in later studies. Alternately, residual heterozygosity can allow for QTL validation studies utilizing a segregating locus within a strain. Given the level and potential effects of residual heterozygosity in many of the CC strains, regular and comprehensive updates on the heterozygosity still remaining within the SGCF's colony of CC mice would improve the value of the CC resource. Therefore, the SGCF plans on heterozygosity segregating in the colony over time. Finally, it would be helpful to expand whole genome sequencing beyond a single mouse per strain to ensure that mutations that arise in the colony are taken in to account and potentially exploited in genetic analyses (Kumar et al. 2013) .
