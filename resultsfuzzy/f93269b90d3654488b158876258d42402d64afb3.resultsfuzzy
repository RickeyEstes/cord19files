To understand the biological significance underlying the gene expression data, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used [106] . This method analyzes all of the gene expression data to identify genes coordinately regulated in predefined gene sets. GSEA was applied independently to gene expression results obtained at 15 hpi and to those obtained at 65 hpi. Gene expression results were sorted by their logRatios. Gene Sets based on Gene Ontology keywords as defined in the subset C5 of Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB v2.5) [106] were used. 1402 Gene Sets containing more than 4 and less than 501 members were considered. 1000 permutations were performed. In each case, the top 20 Gene Sets showing positive correlation with upregulated genes in our data were further analyzed. [1] . All the primers were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). Data were acquired with an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed with ABI PRISM 7000 SDS version 1.0 software. Levels of viral RNAs are represented in comparison to reference levels from cells infected with rSARS-CoV at 0 hpi.
