Both MimoPro and Pep-3D-Search failed in 1YY9_A, 2GRX_A, 1EER_A, and 3EZE_B. Consequently, PepMapper failed as well. We think that this failure could be attributed to a number of factors, including the quality of the experimental data and the complexity of the predicting tasks. For instance, we found that the mimotope set used for predicting the epitopic region of 2GRX_A is screened against the whole complementary protein rather than the restricted region of the two interacting proteins. Therefore it is reasonable to suppose that there may be multiple regions on the surface of the target antigen to which the mimotope can bind. As a result, the mimotopes may bind to the regions that are different from the preferable region. Additionally, the limited number of mimotopes (1D4V_B, 1EER_A) and surface amino acids may also complicate the matter, since the small number of mimotopes contains little information for locating the epitopic region, especially where too many surface amino acids exist. Furthermore, even though the dataset for our experiments has been the largest ever reported publicly, a few bad results can still greatly influence the statistical results. The Intersection operation of PepMapper captures the idea of mutual verification of epitope prediction. Intuitively, the more the commonly shared peptides in the same area are, the more likely the area to be a part of an epitope is. On average, this operation has the highest specificity of 0.930 and a high precision of 0.256 compared to that of the Union, MimoPro, and Pep-3D-Search (Tables 2 & 3) . However, its sensitivity is the lowest because some epitopic amino acids predicted by either method but not in common are left out in the calculation. This also reveals the weakness of the Intersection operation of PepMapper, i.e., in case of no overlapping between the two methods, it does not mean that no epitopic sites may be predicted by either MimoPro or Pep-3D-Search alone. 1MQ8 is such a case without common peptides, but MimoPro still predicts some positive epitopic sites. Fortunately, the union operation of PepMapper complements the weakness of Intersection operation by joining the results from the two methods together to increase the size of potential epitopic sites. The Union operation produced the best performance in sensitivity but the worst in precision and specificity compared to that of the Intersection, MimoPro, and Pep-3D-Search (Tables 2  & 3) . This is because the increased size of potential epitopic sites brought in by the Union operation also contains more false positives in the candidates. Using Consistency defined in Equation (3) as an indirect sufficient condition to judge the likelihood of successful prediction of epitope by combining both Intersection and Union, our tests tend to support its usefulness in indicating the likelihood of successful prediction (Table 3) . Although the number of tests is still insufficient for us to draw any exclusive conclusion on its implication on epitope prediction, our initial analysis leads to the following indications:
