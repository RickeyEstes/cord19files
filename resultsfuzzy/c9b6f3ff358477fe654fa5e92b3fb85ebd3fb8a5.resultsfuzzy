Previously, we reported an age-dependent susceptibility to CHIKV infection in mice. Infection of 6 day old animals resulted in 100% mortality; 9 day old animals developed paralysis, with approximately 50% of the animals succumbing to infection; while by 12 days of age the mice became refractory to symptoms of severe disease and lethality [15] . To compare our experimental mouse model of CHIKV infection to the response seen in human infants we assessed the IFN and proinflammatory responses in 8-9 day old mice. We first assessed the induction of the IFN response at the local site of infection by monitoring mRNA levels of IFNb and selected interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) in the skin. Mice were inoculated with 2610 5 PFU of CHIKV and the injection site was removed between 3-120 hrs post-infection. Increased expression of IFNb mRNA could be detected as early as 3 hrs post-infection with peak levels being achieved at 16 hrs post-infection ( Figure 3A ). Similar to IFNb mRNA induction, IRF7, Mx1 and ISG15 mRNA levels could also be detected as early as 3 hrs post-infection, with peak levels observed at 16 hrs post-infection ( Figure 3A) . Thus, at the site of infection, neonatal mice are able to induce IFNb expression as well as a subset of known ISGs. Of note, IRF7 and Mx1 mRNA expression is indicative of signaling via the type I IFN receptor, suggesting that the production as well as reception of IFNab is intact in neonatal mice. We next assessed the systemic inflammatory response in this model. Similar to our findings in human infants infected with CHIKV, we observed a strong induction of IFNa and IFNc in infected pups ( Figure 3B ). Plasma concentration of CCL2, CCL4, CXCL9 and CXCL10 were also elevated, however IL-12p70 was only modestly induced ( Figure 3C ). Similar to the human data, a mixed Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokine profile was observed with the induction of IL-12, IL-5, IL-13, IL-15, and IL-17 ( Figure 3C ). For all analytes, peak levels were seen 16-24 hrs post-infection ( Figure 3) . Notably, there were some differences seen between the murine neonate and human infant inflammatory profiles. Most interestingly, the mice displayed increased levels of the pyrogenic cytokines, including IL-1b, IL-6 and TNFa, which were not seen in our studies of human infants ( Figure 3C ). While this may represent differences in pathogenesis, we believe it is more a reflection of the fact that the mice can be assessed within hours of viral inoculation, while the exact timing of the human infection is unknown. Overall, we find that the similarities between the mouse and human responses support the use of neonatal mice to study the response to CHIKV infection, and indicate that induction of IFNs, as well as the triggering of an ISG response, are both rapid and robust. Figure 1 that showed a correlation with viral load, IFN or age are plotted in a network array, illustrating the correlations identified in neonatal vs. adult individuals. Connecting lines indicate Spearman correlation (r s ) values; positive correlations in red and negative correlations are depicted in blue. IFNa data from adult patients were previously reported [20] , but are shown here for comparison to data from infected neonates. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1002322.g002 Next, to confirm that endogenous IFN contributes to the control of CHIKV in neonatal mice, mice lacking subunit 1 of the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR 2/2 ) mice were infected with CHIKV at 9 days of age. Consistent with our previous observations in adult mice [15] , neonatal pups lacking IFNAR1 were highly susceptible to CHIKV infection with 100% of the pups dying by day 2 postinfection ( Figure 4A) . These pups developed a rapid, disseminated infection. Within 1 day of infection, the IFNAR 2/2 mice displayed viral loads at the injection site that were 100-fold higher than that detected in WT controls. We also observed a striking increase in viral titers in the serum and multiple organs, including the brain, liver, and lung ( Figure 4B ). These data indicate that endogenous IFN, while insufficient to protect mice, plays an important role in limiting CHIKV infection during disease pathogenesis in neonatal animals.
