This section uses descriptive statistics to discuss the results of the questionnaire-based indicators validation. Table 2 shows the mean scores (out of maximum score of 5) for the proposed indicators. It reflects the stakeholders' perceptions and cumulative ranking. Table 3 Environment: Clients have 13 indicators in this category among their top 25 rankings. Also clients show particular preference for indicators that are measured by their compliance with statutory and regulatory provisions such as the EIAO. This reflects the existing approach to enforcing responsible sustainability behaviours. This is predominantly through command and control structures manifested in the form of ordinances and statutory guidelines as opposed to responsible behaviours induced by market forces. Other indicators that clients rank high are performance-based and relate to waste management. Health and safety: All the stakeholders rank indicators under this main category high. It is of particular interest that public health-related indicators scored very good ranking. Three of the indicators are within the top 4 positions in the overall ranking by all stakeholders ( Table 1 shows that top 25 ranked indicators have a minimum mean score of 3.71 (for rehabilitation cost of ecosystem, which is ranked 34 by all stakeholders. Table 3 summarises the respective top 25 ranked indicators by all the stakeholders. c EIAO-Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance (in HKSAR), or equivalent statutory provisions in a given country. d ACABAS-Advisory Committee on Aesthetics of Bridges and Associated Structures (in HKSAR), or its equivalent body in a given country/state. The activities of ACABAS in HKSAR are intended primarily towards vetting the design of bridges and other structures associated with the public highway system from the aesthetic and visual impact points of view. e This is a metaphysical belief that is deeply rooted in Chinese tradition and culture. It is similar to the concept of FUbuntu_ in South Africa [25, 33] . sustainable health and hygiene was rarely mentioned in (SDUs) liaison meetings with stakeholders, and was not one of the priorities. Yet in recent liaison meetings (after the SARS outbreak) this has been cited as a key pillar of sustainable development in Hong Kong.'' This observation, which is also substantiated by the SDU, shows that some indicators like health and safety are vulnerable to shifts in society's definition of sustainability and prioritization of the core elements. It further raises some issues related to intergenerational priorities in sustainability and hence the associated risks. Thus, there is need for sustainability risk management strategies. Economy: All the stakeholders rank life cycle cost on the top 25, but there are noticeable differences in the rankings. Clients rank it 23, while consultants rank it 12 and the contractors rank it 1. It is also observed that contractors rank four cost-related indicators on their top 25. Clients rank Frehabilitation cost of ecosystem_ as No. 25 . Societal: The entire stakeholder ranks ''extent of encroachment on concerned areas'' among the top 25 indicators. In addition, clients also rank Ffootprint of project in archaeological sites_ as No. 12. Both indicators fall under cultural heritage. Resource utilization: All the stakeholders rank reusability of moulds among the top 10, while the cumulative ranking is No. 1 (Table 2) . Generally, indicators under resource utilization relate to construction methods and strategies that minimise depletion of the limited resources. Construction is an intensive transformation process that often involves assembling and transforming resources into physical artefacts. Resource reuse relates to material conservation and hence environmental aspects of sustainability. It is also a function of construction methods and innovative designs (including designing for durability and deconstruction) etc. This ranking reflects increasing level of awareness among stakeholders and their recognition of the need to avoid overusing renewable resources. Contractors rank three indicators in this category as No. 1. Also contractors rank eleven of the indicators under this among their top 25 indicators. This is significant because contractors are mostly engaged at the construction stage of projects. They are in the best position to ensure optimised resource utilization during construction (e.g., through reuse, adequate Table 3  Top 25 Indicators ranked by various stakeholders (source: consolidation of Table 2) Key sustainability item Indicator (rank)
