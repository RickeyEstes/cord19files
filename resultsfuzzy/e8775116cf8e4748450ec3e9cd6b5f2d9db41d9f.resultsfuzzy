The SARS outbreak devastated several industry sectors of the Taiwan economy. The tourism industry was seriously damaged during the SARS period, while the manufacturing, retail trade, and banking industries were less influenced (see Table 2 ). The findings of the study confirmed that the tourism industry experienced the most serious damage in terms of stock price decline (approximately 29 percent) among many industries on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in the month following the SARS outbreak. As part of the tourism industry, hotel business in Taiwan was also severely affected by SARS during the first half of 2003. Due to the large decrease in leisure and business visitors, the occupancy rates of five-star hotels dropped by as much as 40 percent and average room rates also plummeted during the SARS outbreak. To offset the dramatic losses of revenue, most hotel management adopted cost-reduction strategies: closing some floors, reducing operating hours of food and beverage facilities, asking employees to take non-paid leave, and stopping all overtime payments (Pine and McKercher, 2004) . This research examined the effect of the SARS outbreak on Taiwanese hotel stock performance. Seven publicly traded hotel companies had significant declines in their earnings and stock prices during the SARS period. Such a finding indicated that hotel stocks, on average, were exposed to above-market-average risk during the SARS outbreak period, which is consistent with the common perception that the hotel industry is most vulnerable to a decrease in the number of tourists. It suggests that investors expect hotel stock prices to react negatively to a future epidemic and ask for a higher return to compensate for higher risk. Table 4 presents the CARs for four models and ten industries within the 10-day event windows before the SARS outbreak. As shown in Table 4 , the estimated CARs during the 10-day period prior to the SARS outbreak were not statistically significant across all the models and industries. Thus, these results indicated that the value of CAR for the hotel industry as well as the other industries was not different from zero in the absence of the SARS influence and no significant abnormal returns were witnessed before SARS outbreak (Table 5) In comparison, the estimated CARs over the event window (0, 10), i.e. the 10-day period after SARS outbreak, the negative CARs were found to be statistically significant at the 5% level for seven out of ten industry sectors. However, only for the hotel and foods industries among those seven sectors, the negative CARs of all four models were statistically significant at the 5% level. Among the four models, the market model showed the weakest results for most industries in general. Moreover, we estimated CARs during the 20-day period after SARS outbreak (see Table  6 ). Only in the hotel sector the CARs were statistically negative at the 5% level for all four models. These results evidenced that the SARS outbreak did have a negative impact on the hotel stock performance in Taiwan. The results of this research clearly showed that a tragic event like the SARS outbreak dampened the Taiwan stock market. Due to the widespread global panic about SARS and intensive news coverage, the catastrophic event could result in an irrational market response (e.g., a sell-off, a panic, or a contagion effect). A contagion effect prevails in case that unpredictability concerning some stocks is transferred to other stocks in the same or related industry. Among different segments of the tourism industry, stock prices of hotels could have immediate negative reaction right after the SARS outbreak, and other industry segments such as restaurant, travel agency, rental car companies could also be directly exposed to significantly negative stock market returns. The influence of the SARS outbreak on the tourism industry was quickly assimilated into declining stock prices in reality. Thus, accompanied by a sharp decline in sales revenue and cash flow due to significant decrease in occupancy and average daily rate, a widespread panic caused stakeholders who invested in hotels to perceive higher risk and to require higher rate of return for their investment in Taiwan. Therefore, hotel investors considered their stocks over-valued, resulting in sell-off of their stocks.
