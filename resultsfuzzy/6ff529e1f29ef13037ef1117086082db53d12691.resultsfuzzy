SVM-prediction results obtained with optimized kernel parameters on known Pg-act peptides are shown in Additional file 1 a,b,c for SK, Additional file 2-a,b,c for SAK, Additional file 3-a,b,c for UK and Additional file 4 for tPA of amino acid(AC), dipeptide(DC) and PSSM profiles composition respectively. It can be seen that a large number of activators are predicted over a threshold of 0.9 and all are predicted above threshold 0.5.
