Of the 240 samples collected, 132 (55%) were PCR positive for influenza A only, 9 (3.8%) were picornavirus PCR positive only, 3 (of 77 samples) were RSV PCR positive only, 2 (0.8%) samples were PCR positive for both influenza A and picornavirus and 94 (39.2%) were negative for all four viruses. No influenza B virus was detected by PCR in this study population. The rate of influenza A PCR positivity in this study fell significantly in samples taken longer after onset of ILI (83.3%, days 0-3; 45.2%, days 4-7 and 23.9% after 8 or more days (Fig. 2) ).
