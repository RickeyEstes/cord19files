Here we report a combinatorial ensemble of twenty-six N-functionalized aziridinyl peptides, 7 of which carry on the aziridine nitrogen another L-a-amino acidic residue and 2 malonic residues. Among them, 4 new amido aziridinyl peptides are synthesized by a highly selective hydrolysis of the cyano group.
