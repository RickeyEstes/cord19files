To synthesize the first series of the amides 5, xaminophosphonates 7a-7d containing straight chain linkers were selected (Scheme 2). The x-aminophosphonates 7a-7d were prepared according to the described procedures [12] [13] [14] . Among them, aminomethylphosphonate 7a was considered as the most important since it was later transformed into the analogs 17a-24a in which nitrogen atoms (N1 or N9) in nucleobases and the phosphorus atom are separated by four bonds, thus providing compounds structurally closest to the drugs 1-4. Uracil (9)-, 5-fluorouracil (10)-, 5-bromouracil (11)-, thymine (12)-, and benzouracil (14) are also known compounds and they were synthesized by alkylation of the respective nucleobases by chloro-or bromoacetic acid [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . For future introduction of cytosine-and adenine-acetyl fragments, the protected acids 13 [20] and 15 [21] had to be prepared to significantly increase lipophilicity of the respective amides 21a-21d and 23a-23d. (2-Amino-6chloropurin-9-yl)acetic acid 16 [22] served as a precursor to guanine-decorated amides 25a-25d (Scheme 3). A large number of coupling reagents have been developed for the efficient formation of the amide bond [23, 24] but only some of them proved useful in the peptide chemistry [25] . In search for the coupling system to be applied to our tasks, we were directed by studies of acylation of model secondary amines with (thymine-1yl)acetic acid (12) [26] . When the aminophosphonate 7a was reacted with the acid 12 in the presence of benzotriazol-1-yloxytris (dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP) [27] , (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) [28] , N-[(dimethylamino)-1H-1,2,3-triazolo-[4,5-b]pyridin-1-ylmethylene]-N-methylmethanaminium hexafluorophosphate N-oxide (HATU) [29] , and 1-[(1-(cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethylideneaminooxy)-dimethylamino-morpholinomethylene)]methanaminium hexafluorophosphate (COMU) [29] with triethylamine or diethylisopropylamine as additives, the expected amide 20a could not be isolated from the complex reaction mixtures. The same coupling was next performed with propylphosphonic anhydride (T3P Ã’ ) [30] and N-(3dimethylaminopropyl)-N 0 -ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) [31, 32] to produce pure amide 20a [33] in acceptable yields (Table 1) . As expected, microwave irradiation significantly accelerated the amide bond formation. In most cases, couplings of the aminophosphonates 7a-7d with nucleobase-substituted acetic acids 9-16 in the presence of EDC proceeded almost quantitatively. However, the final products 17a-24d were isolated in moderate yields since several crystallizations were necessary to remove the last traces of triethylamine hydrochloride. The guanine-containing phosphonates 25a-25d were prepared from the 6-chloropurine precursors 24a-24d by hydrolysis in acidic medium (Scheme 3) [34] .
