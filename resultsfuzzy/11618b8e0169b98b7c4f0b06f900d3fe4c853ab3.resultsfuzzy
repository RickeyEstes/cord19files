After characterization of Bat/KE4852/07, we processed an additional 39 E. helvum bat fecal swab samples from Kenya and screened them for rotaviruses by using VP6 RT-PCR. Three additional samples (Bat/KE5096/07, Bat/ KE5105/07, and Bat/K5175/07) were positive for rotavirus. These 3 samples were obtained in Maseno, Kenya, which is â‰ˆ20 km from Vihiga. Given the population dynamics and migratory patterns of this species, bats from both roosts likely interact, at least during certain times of the year. VP6 sequences for Bat/KE5096/07, Bat/KE5105/07, and Bat/ K5175/07 samples were 100% identical to VP6 sequence of Bat/KE4852/07. In an attempt to obtain a complete genomic sequence for the bat rotavirus, we will analyze this virus by using sequence-independent deep sequencing.
