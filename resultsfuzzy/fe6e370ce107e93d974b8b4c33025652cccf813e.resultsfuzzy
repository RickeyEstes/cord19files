3.1. Cloning and sequence analysis of P. alecto RLH's Although no whole genome sequence is currently available for P. alecto, a low coverage genome sequence is publicly available in Ensembl for the closely related pteropid bat, P. vampyrus. Three RIG-I like helicases were identified by keyword searching of the P. vampyrus genome using the search terms DDX58 (RIG-I), IFIH1 (mda5) and DHX58 (LGP2). Blast queries of the public databases using these sequences confirmed their homology to corresponding genes from other species. BLAT searches of the P. vampyrus genome using these sequences as well as human and mouse homologues of these genes did not identify any additional homologues in P. vampyrus, nor did BLAST searches of the trace file archive from which the genome was constructed. To determine the complete gene structure of RIG-I, mda5 and LGP2 in P. alecto, RACE PCR was performed using primers based on sequences identified in the P. vampyrus genome sequence using spleen cDNA as a template. Inwards facing PCR primers were then designed from the RACE products to amplify the entire coding region of each gene as a single large PCR product, which was then cloned for sequencing. The longest transcript obtained for each gene was designated the prototype and full-length mRNA sequences were deposited into GenBank under the accession numbers JN031514-JN031516. Each gene contained a single open reading frame corresponding in size to homologues in other mammalian species. P. alecto RLH mRNA sequences were compared to the corresponding P. vampyrus genomic DNA sequences to determine the intron-exon structure (Fig. 1) . Mda5 was found to be the longest of the RLHs, consisting of 16 exons encoding a 3075 bp open reading frame (ORF). RIG-I consisted of 18 exons encoding a 2790 bp ORF, whereas LGP2 consisted of 12 coding exons plus one non-coding 5' exon encoding a 2037 bp ORF. The bat RLHs are of typical length and organisation to corresponding genes in other mammals, however bat RIG-I and LGP2 occupy considerably less genomic DNA than their human counterparts (RIG-I: 34 vs. 71 kb, LGP2: 8 vs. 11 kb) due to reduced intron sizes, whereas mda5 is similar in bat and human (50 vs. 52 kb). This is not an unexpected finding, since bat genomes are known to be more constrained than in other vertebrates, a feature shared with birds and hypothesised to be a consequence of adaptation to flight 1 . Predicted intron-exon organisation of P. alecto RLHs. The intron-exon arrangements of pteropid bat RIG-I, mda5 and LGP2 were predicted by nucleotide alignment of P. alecto mRNA and P. vampyrus genomic DNA. Predicted coding and non-coding exons are drawn as light and dark rectangles respectively, while putative introns are indicated by dotted lines. The figure is drawn to scale and distances are given in bp, however some intron sizes may be underestimated due to gaps in the P. vampyrus genome assembly. mda5 exon 8 is absent from the P. vampyrus genome assembly due to a sequencing gap, however it is expected to be a contiguous exon in the pteropid bats as it is highly conserved and present as a single exon in other species examined. In all other cases, intron-exon boundaries were clearly identified by homology with other species and by the presence of splice site consensus sequences. (Smith and Gregory, 2009 ). Kozak consensus sequences for strong eukaryotic translation consist of either adenine or guanine in the À3 position and guanine in the +4 position relative to the start codon (Kozak, 1997) . LGP2 contained both Kozak elements (À3: adenine,+4: guanine), whereas RIG-I and mda5 each contained only one Kozak element (À3: adenine). Polyadenylation signals (AA-TAAA) were present in the 3 0 UTRs of all three transcripts in close proximity to the Poly A + tail. P. alecto RIG-I, mda5 and LGP2 genes are predicted to encode proteins with molecular weights of 107, 116, and 77 kDa, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequences were analysed by conserved domain analysis to identify putative domains (Fig. 2) . Both RIG-I and mda5 (but not LGP2) contained two N-terminal CARD domains, while all three proteins contained a DExD/H-box RNA helicase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain. The protein domain organisation of bat RLHs is therefore highly conserved with other mammalian species and thus indicative of similar function. At the amino acid sequence level, P. alecto RIG-I and LGP2 were 82% identical to their human counterparts, while P. alecto mda5 was 85% identical to human mda5. Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the amino acid sequences of RIG-I, mda5 and LGP2 from P. alecto and other mammals (Fig. 3) . P. alecto mda5 and LGP2 were most closely related to horse genes, followed by other members of Laurasiatheria. P. alecto RIG-I was slightly more divergent but still clustered with Laurasiatheria. At both the nucleotide and amino acid level, interspecies differences appeared to be evenly distributed across the open reading frame with no obvious hypervariable regions. Although several of the predicted branch points were only weakly supported by bootstrap analysis, these findings support the idea that fruit bats are quite closely related to horses. This is supported by a recent phylogenetic study based on retrotransposon insertion analysis (Nishihara et al., 2006) , as well as findings from previous studies of bat immune genes Iha et al., 2009; Iha et al., 2010; Cowled et al., 2011) and our own additional observations, and might be considered significant in light of the fact that horses are the main spillover host for Hendra virus.
