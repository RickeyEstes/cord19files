The cationic lipids 1 and 2 (Figure 1 ) containing a guanidinylated lysine spacer between the hydrophobic tails and mannose-mimicking shikimoyl-and quinoyl head-groups as well as their mannosyl analog lipid 3 (Figure 1 ) were synthesized by conventional peptide coupling of the acetyl protected shikimic, quinic acids and mannose to appropriately derivatized lysinylated amphiphiles followed by quaternization, deprotections, and chloride ion exchange (Supplementary Schemes S1-S3). The details of synthetic schemes, procedures, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and mass spectral data for lipids 1-3 as well as the highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) profiles of the purified lipids 1-3 in two different mobile phases are provided in the Supplementary Information (Supplementary Figures S1-S9 .
