Traditionally, incubation period is defined as the period between the infection of an individual by a pathogen and the manifestation of the illness or disease it causes [32, 33] . Different infectious diseases have different incubation periods. However, for a certain infectious disease, its incubation period is relatively fixed. Since the number of pathogens entering the body, virulence and reproductive capacity, as well as power of resistance are different for different people, thus, it is reported that the incubation periods obtained from patients for a certain disease should follow logarithm normal distribution [16, 33] . Generally, incubation period can be measured by physiological observations and biological experiments [33] . The determination of incubation period has great implications for disease transmission control and policy making. The estimation of the incubation period of COVID-19 is a very difficult task. The main difficulty is in that it is difficult to determine the infected time. Based on patients' information, some works have reported the incubation period of COVID-19. For example, Yang et al. [4] reported that the median incubation period of COVID-19 is 4.75 days; the interquartile range is 3.0 − 7.2 days. Hereinafter, we try to estimate the incubation period of patients in Henan. The collected data are with varied quality, many descriptions of patients only told us when the person left Wuhan, or When she/he had suspicious contacts with persons from Wuhan or suspicious persons (Following, we call they are exposed). To facilitate us to estimate the incubation period, we define estimated incubation period as the period from the date of exposure to the date of appearing clinical symptoms or making a definite diagnosis. Apparently, such definition overestimates the actual incubation period. For example, the information from a patient .

Weighted indegree and outdegree distributions of the directed graph that was shown in C. Weighted indegree denotes the total number of patients with clinical symptoms or confirmed infected; while weighted outdegree represents the total number of exposed persons that will be confirmed to be infected later. (Mr Zhou, No.2 patients in Nanyang) in Nanyang says that his son left Wuhan and arrived at home at January 6, he and his son were all disease-free for a long period. Until February 3, he became sick and was quickly confirmed with infection of COVID-19. His son was disease-free till now. From our definition of incubation period, his incubation period will be 28 days, which is surprisingly high. We note that, our definition of estimated incubation period may be a little higher than the actually case, since we can not exclude the cases that the person has contacted some other people that carried the COVID-19. That is, we cannot know who was the intermediate spreader (unknown person B), and when she/he transmitted the virus from person A to person C. Among the collected data, the incubation periods of 483 confirmed patients can be estimated. Statistical results are shown in Fig.3 and Tab.1. The estimated incubation periods for the 483 patients roughly follow the logarithm normal distribution, with a long right tail. Specifically, the 483 confirmed patients were with average estimated incubation periodτ D = 7.4 days, the mode was 4 days (50 out of the 483 cases) and the median was 7 days (48 out of the 483 cases). About 55% patients were with incubation periods lower than 7 days, while more than 92% patients were lower than 14 days. About 7.45% patients were overestimated with more than 14 days incubation periods. Due to the definition, the estimated incubation periods in this paper may be longer than the real cases. However, the distribution has some implications. It indicates that a few patients may be with very long incubation period, which increase the difficulty to control and prevent the COVID-19. .
