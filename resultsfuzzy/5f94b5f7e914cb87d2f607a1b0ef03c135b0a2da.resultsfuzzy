The baseline concentrations of SP in the nasal lavage fluid were similar in the azelastine and the placebo group (86.8 T 18.2 pg/mL versus 82.3 T 21.4 pg/mL). Significantly lower concentrations of substance P were noted in nasal lavage fluid after 10 days of azelastine treatment (73.2 T 16.9 pg/mL) when compared with placebo treatment (83.1 T 17.8 pg/mL). The differences between the azelastine and the placebo treated group VRS symptom scores (6.4 T 2.4 versus 8.6 T 3.2) were also statistically significant demonstrating that the reduction in nasal lavage SP levels occurred in conjunction with improvement in clinical symptoms. Conclusion: Intranasal azelastine reduces substance P release into nasal lavage fluid of non-allergic rhinitis patients associated with clinical improvement during a 10 day treatment period. The efficacy of azelastine in perennial non-allergic rhinitis may be related to reduction of release of SP and other non-adrenergic non-cholinergic neural mediators into nasal secretions. The results showed that there was no predominant clone of S. aureus with a high heterogenicity of spa typing and MLST. A toxin gene assay showed very interesting results that all S. aureus strains had at least two kinds of toxin genes; sea and tsst-1 being the most prevalent. Conclusion: In this first head-to-head comparison of Levo and Deslo in CIU, patients satisfaction with Levo was significantly higher, onset of action of Levo was faster and the overall efficacy of Levo was significantly better than Deslo in relieving CIU symptoms. The DBH and ALLHOME studies identified cultural behaviour as an important factor when performing epidemiological studies. Information gathered from the descriptive cross-sectional study could provide clues leading to the formulation of epidemiologic hypotheses, which could be tested in the analytic nested case-control study. A target group of pre-school children was proposed, since children at that age spend most of their time at home. A crosssectional questionnaire, developed for the DBH study and containing 87 questions on demographic data, health symptoms, housing characteristics and lifestyle factors was proposed. The use of parental questionnaires for information on housing characteristics could be an effective tool in conducting studies on housing and health. The proposed nested case-control study includes dwelling inspections of a non-destructive type (building checklist, sensory and visual evaluation of dampness, dust sampling for HDM, moulds, pollens, phthalates), engineering measurements (air temperature, humidity, CO2 level) and medical examinations (general examination and skin prick test). Special attention should be paid on storage of collected data, statistical analyzes and dissemination of the research results. Conclusion: The paper can be used as a guideline for performing studies on indoor environment and allergy/asthma. The correlation between the reaction of IgE towards Phl p and the four grass pollen extract mixes, irrespective of the number included in the mixes, is statistical significant (0.96Y0.98, Spearman). Phl p has the capacity to inhibit the reaction of the patients specific IgE to the four grass pollen extract mixes indicating a high degree of cross-reactivity of the patients IgE. SIT with Phleum pratense induces IgG4 which exhibit a statistical significant correlation (0.92Y0.99, Spearman) in their reaction with the individual nine Pooideae grass pollen extracts and the four grass pollen extract mixes. Thus, IgG4 induced by SIT with Phl p cross-react extensively with both single and mixed grass pollen extracts. Conclusion: Immunochemical and clinical data together support the conclusion that Phl p alone is as effective for allergen specific immunotherapy against allergy to Pooideae grass pollens as any mix or single specie fro the Pooideae family. Background: The clinical efficacy of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SIT) in the treatment of allergic respiratory diseases is well documented, but its main drawback of is the risk of systemic reactions (SRs). This 3-years prospective study evaluated the safety of SIT with standardized extracts in real life in patients with allergic rhinitis and/or asthma. Methods: Between January 2003 and June 2006 a total of 248 patients (140 male, mean age 31.4 years, range 7Y65) referred to our Allergy Unit were prescribed SIT for their respiratory diseases. 176 of the patients had seasonal/ perennial rhinitis and 72 asthma with or without rhinitis. Allergen extracts were all standardized by biological methods (ALK-Abell√≤ and Stallergenes). 204 patients were treated according to a traditional (12 weeks) schedule, whereas 44 underwent a cluster protocol (7 weeks). Patients were treated for grass (35%), birch (13%), parietaria (31%), mite (21%). Systemic reactions (SRs) were categorized into immediate SRs (occurring within 30 minutes) and late (930 minutes). They were graded in four levels of severity according to EEACI Immunotherapy Position Paper (0= No symptoms; 1= Non specific symptoms probably non IgE-mediated; 2= rhinitis/asthma responding adequately to treatment; 3= non life-threatening SRs, e.g. urticaria, angioedema or severe asthma; 4= Anaphylactic shock). Results: A total of 9,650 injections were administered in the 248 patients. SRs registered are shown in table 1 and divided according to the two phases of the schedule (build-up and maintenance). Results. There were 18 SRs (7.3% patients and 0.20% injections). 13 occurred in the build-up phase and 5 in thye maintenance. SRs were more frequent in females (66%). Grass pollens were most frequently responsible of SRs (65%) than other allergens (parietaria 18%, tree 5%, mite 10%) SRs were Grade 1= 8 cases; Grade 2 = 7 cases; Grade 3 = 1 case, Grade 4 = 2 cases (Epinephrine administered). Both severe reactions occurred within 30 minutes after injection. Late reactions were less common (7 SRs). Conclusion: If properly used, SIT has a low and acceptable rate of side effects. In our population female gender and build-up phase were the two main risk factors. Keywords. Specific immunotherapy, injection, systemic reaction. The transcripts gave rise to categories relating to risk perception, illness cognitions, coping strategies, understanding of health and well-being, meanings given to diet and food. Transcripts also revealed developmental, parent/child, and sex differences vital to creating a targeted and food allergy sensitive intervention. A psycho-education intervention was then developed and is currently being validated with strong initial findings. Conclusion: Middle childhood is a period when problems with anxiety, low self-esteem, peer comparison, and malconstructive coping strategies emerge, leading to higher risk in adolescence. Our data suggests that an intervention at this critical point in the food allergy developmental perspective is vital to ensuring successful biopsychosocial adjustment in day-to-day life.
