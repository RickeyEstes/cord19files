Reasons for negative test results using virus isolation are numerous, so the clinician should not assume that a virus is not present when a negative test result is obtained (Box 1-2) . Negative test results can occur as a result of inadequate specimen size, lack of viral shedding by the animal at the time of specimen collection, the binding of antibodies to viruses within the specimen, inadequate organism numbers at the anatomic site of specimen collection, or loss of organism viability during transportation to the laboratory. Loss of viral viability is more likely to occur with enveloped viruses such as canine distemper virus than with non-enveloped, hardy viruses such as canine parvovirus or FCV. Negative test results can also occur when the cell line inoculated is not sensitive to the virus present in the specimen. Lowpassage cells may also lose their infectivity for viral infection if they have undergone multiple serial passages. False negatives can also occur if the plates are overgrown by bacteria or fungi. Although treatment of the viral transport and culture media with antimicrobials can help prevent this, resistant bacteria or fungi may still be present. Sometimes, multiple viruses are present within a specimen, and one virus overgrows another. For example, this can occur with mixed infections with FCV and feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) in cats with upper respiratory tract disease. FCV rapidly infects Crandell-Reese feline kidney cells and produces CPE, which obscures the concurrent presence of FHV-1. It is imperative that veterinary clinicians be aware that the detection of a virus in a specimen does not always imply that the organism is the cause of the animal's clinical signs. This is especially true for specimens collected from the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts, where multiple infectious agents may be present concurrently, and in many cases, viruses can replicate in these locations without causing clinical signs of illness. In some animals, the development of severe clinical signs is more likely when there is simultaneous presence of multiple infectious agents. As noted previously for specimens that test negative, the presence of one agent may also obscure the presence of another, more significant organism (such as with FCV and FHV-1 co-infections), which could result in the incorrect assumption that only one organism is the cause of an animal's disease.
