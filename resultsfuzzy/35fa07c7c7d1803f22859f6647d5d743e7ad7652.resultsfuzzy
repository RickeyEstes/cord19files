The main aim of this study was to classify and predict novel compounds active against parasitic nematodes. The various molecular descriptors (333 in total) were calculated initially, using MOE [42] . After removing insignificant attributes (standard deviation ≤ 0.3) and applying a correlation test with a cutoff value of 0.8 we were able to reduce the total number of attributes to 113. Subsequently the SDA algorithm was applied and finally a set of 14 descriptors was selected for the development of classification model (details in Methods section). The obtained model correctly classified 87.56% of the active compounds and 85.30% of the inactive compounds with the overall accuracy of 86.43% in the training set while 81.82% in the test set. The F−measure of the training and test sets are 86.52% and 79.17% respectively. Table 4 shows the result of the classification for the training and testing sets. All the predicted compounds can be found in Additional File 2. The machine learning systems such as this could clearly reduce the cost involved in experimental methods involved in drug discovery pipeline. As the SVM algorithm has been effectively applied in various classification problems, we investigated the utility of SVM approach for the prediction of potential anthelmintic lead compounds. The accuracy of the model on the training dataset may indicate the effectiveness of a prediction model however; it may not be able to accurately show how the model will perform on novel compounds. Therefore, it is critical to test the model on an independent dataset, not used in training. In our case we trained and optimized the SVM classifier separately using the entire training set and evaluated the model on the test set. As shown in Table 4 , the SVM model obtained an accuracy of 81.79% for the test set. On careful examination of our prediction result, we find that structural similarity of many false positives to the compounds in the active set is quite high, which may suggest a lower accuracy figure for the test set, due to our stringent threshold values. Further, we also note that a few false negatives are at the borderline and are thus classified as inactive by our model. To best of our knowledge, there are not many reported studies on the prediction of anthelmintic compounds therefore we were able to compare our results with only one study. We find that our results are comparable to that study. Marrero-Ponce et al. [19] used linear discriminant analysis to classify anthelmintic drug-like from non-anthelmintic compounds. The authors reported the accuracy of around 90.4 % in the training set while 88.2% in the test set which is slightly higher than ours. However, we believe our model is more robust because our selection criterion to pick inactive compounds was quite stringent. We selected molecules within the Tanimoto range of 0.25 to 0.75 of the compounds present in the active set which would make it relatively difficult to classify than if chosen randomly. The idea was to build a robust model that can classify compounds into separate groups even with structural similarity. Further, we surmise that since DrugBank covers most of the FDA approved drugs, the inclusion of DrugBank compounds in our inactive dataset would allow us to navigate to the unexplored regions of drug-like chemical space. The results obtained are particularly interesting from a clinical perspective. From our scaffold analysis we note that even though the size of both the dataset (active and inactive) is approximately same, the number of unique Figure 4 Top ten scaffolds present in active and inactive dataset. Inactive dataset is more diverse than active dataset. Five out of top ten scaffolds are shared in both the datasets. scaffolds found in the inactive set is almost twice the number of unique scaffolds found in active set. This clearly indicates that the inactive set is more diverse than the active set. The number of unique scaffolds, along with the relative percentage according to the total number of molecules present in the dataset is reported in Table 5 . In Figure 4 , we report the top ten molecular scaffolds in both the datasets. We note that, over 70.0% of the active compounds are represented by the top 10 scaffolds whereas only 51.1% of the inactive compounds are represented by the same number of scaffolds. This again suggests high scaffold diversity in inactive dataset. It should also be noted that five of the top ten scaffolds shown in Figure 4 are shared by both datasets. In the 45 predicted compounds, we note that piperazine-like substructures appear frequently suggesting that the nitrogen atom in the piperazine ring might be involved in binding to the receptor. Figure 5 shows an example set of predicted active compounds. Also, we note that many predicted compounds either contain benzimidazole scaffold or are derived from it e.g. in Figure 5 , six compounds out of twelve are a derivative product of the benzimidazole scaffold. This shows the validity of the above method since the benzimidazole class of compounds are well recognized for anthelmintic activity [2] . Further, we searched the ChEMBL database for the binding affinity, assay type and target information of the identified compounds. We note that many predicted compounds bind to targets of interest in model organisms but experimental validation in the case of nematodes needs to be further carried out. Out of the total 45 predicted compounds six compounds are particularly interesting. Compound 3 with antiviral activity, compound 10 with inhibitory activity against Ancylostoma ceylanicum (a nematode), compound 12, compound 37 with antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, compound 26 with activity to inhibit SARS-CoV 3CL protease enzyme and compound 40 with activity against Rhinovirus. In addition, there are compounds that bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and tubulin β-1 chain in rats or humans. Since these two receptors are successful targets in nematodes, predicted compounds that bind Figure 5 Examples of the actives predicted in the prediction set derived from ChEMBL database. All the molecules shown in the figure pass "rule of five" (Ro5) test and are medicinal chemist friendly (MCF). Further a few of them also pass lead-likeness "rule of three" (Ro3) test. to these targets can be used as leads to design novel compounds with high binding affinity to nematodes nicotinic acetylcholine and tubulin β-1 chain receptor.
