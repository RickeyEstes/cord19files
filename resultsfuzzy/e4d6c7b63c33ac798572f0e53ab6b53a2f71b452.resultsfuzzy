The present study proposed the use of the corrected actual reproduction number, R a , for statistical inference of R 0 based on incidence and known relative frequency of secondary transmissions (i.e., the generation time distribution) during the early growth phase of an epidemic. The previously available method using (5) forced us to adopt an exponential growth assumption, and moreover, an additional step towards the estimation of r (i.e., the translation of r to R 0 ) was required [9] . The proposed method does not necessarily require an exponential growth assumption and provides a "short-cut" to estimate R 0 from incidence data. The simple likelihood function employing a binomial distribution was also proposed to yield an appropriate uncertainty bound of R 0 . It should be noted that given the knowledge of g s and readily available incidence data, equation (15) permits calculation of the expected value of R 0 without likelihood. Such a calculation can be attained using any spreadsheet. The usefulness of the actual reproduction number, calculated as a product of the mean generation time and the incidence-to-prevalence ratio, has been previously emphasized in assessing the epidemiological time course of an epidemic [14, 15] . However, it appears that R a does not precisely capture the secondary transmission if the transmission rate () varies with infection-age  [18] , and moreover, the cohort-and period-reproduction numbers directly derived from the renewal equation have been suggested to be more accurate figures in capturing the underlying transmission dynamics [17, 33] . In the present study, replacing the denominator (i.e., prevalence) of R a by the total number of potential contacts, it was shown that the R 0 derived from the renewal equation coincides with the corrected actual reproduction number, R a , and also that the likelihood can be quite easily derived. The corrected R a does not require prevalence data, and uses only the incidence data and the generation time distribution. Many future tasks remain, however. Most importantly, the estimation of R 0 from early epidemic growth data for a heterogeneously-mixing population is called for. R 0 in the present study can even be interpreted as R 0 for a heterogeneously-mixing population (i.e., the dominant eigenvalue of the nextgeneration matrix), provided that the early growth rate is the same among sub-populations (though it is not the case if the growth rate varies across sub-populations) [34, 35] . Analyzing heterogeneous transmission among approximately-aggregated discrete groups, the estimate of the next-generation matrix would give more detailed insights into the epidemic dynamics, including the most important target host for intervention [36] . As discussed in a modeling study in this special issue of the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health [37] , understanding the implications of sexual partnerships and their variations as a function of calendar time as well as infection-age is also of utmost importance. As the next step for a similar estimation framework, methods for estimating robust R 0 and the next-generation matrix from structured data (i.e., data stratified by age-and/or risk-groups) will be useful. Despite the future challenges, I believe the present study at least satisfies a need to offer a likelihood-based approach to estimate R 0 from early epidemic growth data, while being easily tractable and calculable among general epidemiologists.
