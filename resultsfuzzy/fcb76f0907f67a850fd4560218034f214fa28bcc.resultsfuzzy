The tumor ECM is a barrier that restricts diffusive transport of therapeutics. The interaction between the ECM with the surface physicochemical properties of nanomedicines dictate their transport through this barrier. Here, the objective was to identify peptides as surface coatings using combinatorial selection against the tumor ECM and validate that they improve diffusive transport through the ECM. A second objective was to understand how physicochemical properties of peptides, including charge and hydrophobicity, can affect transport through the ECM barrier.
