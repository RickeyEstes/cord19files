However, all six codons are used for active site serine residues in the chymotrypsin family; the most common are from the TCX set, but hepsin, plasmin, thrombin, coagulation factor IX, protein C, and complement components Clr and Cls have AGT or AGC codons. Brenner I pointed out that codons in both groups can be derived from cysteine codons in a single step, and suggested that separate evolutionary lines of serine peptidases may have diverged from an ancestral cysteine peptidase. How-ever, our phylogenetic analysis suggests that the "AGX" members do not represent a monophyletic group, and that the change of codon usage has occurred independently several times. It is possible that the "AGX" members have evolved from "TCX" members via proteins without catalytic activity. Codons from both sets also occur in the catalytic serine in the a-lytic endopeptidase family ($2) of clan SA, as well as in two unrelated lines of serine peptidases, the families of prolyl oligopeptidase ($9) and carboxypeptidase C (S10). The chymotrypsin family contains several proteins that lack peptidase activity. Among these, haptoglobin (HPT_RAT, HPTI_HUMAN, HPT2_HUMAN) has the active site His replaced by Lys, and the active site Ser by Ala, whereas the essential Asp residue is retained. In protein Z (PRTZ_*) and azurocidin (CAP7_*), both the active site Ser and His residues have been replaced. The complete triad is present in cattle procarboxypeptidase A subunit III (CAC3_BOVIN), and the inactivity of this has been attributed to lack of two N-terminal hydrophobic residues. 8 In rhesus monkey apolipoprotein (a) (APOA_MACMU) the active site Ser is replaced by Asn, but in the human protein (APOA_HUMAN) all three residues of the catalytic triad are present. The expected hydrophobic residues at positions 16 and 17 (chymotrypsinogen numbering) are also present in the human apolipoprotein, so that it has the appearance of a fully functional proenzyme. Conversion to an active peptidase would apparently require cleavage of a Serq-Ile bond, and proteolytic activity of apolipoprotein (a) has been reported. 9 The fact that members of family S1 occur in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes has been the subject of considerable debate. The actinomycete trypsins have sequences too similar to eukaryote trypsins to be consistent with a divergence 3500 million years ago, which is when the common ancestor of prokaryotes and eukaryotes is generally thought to have lived. Hartley 1Â° attempted to explain this apparent anomaly in terms of a "horizontal" gene transfer from higher organisms to bacteria, whereas Young et al. 11 presented a dendrogram with bacterial sequences at the root, along with an estimate of divergence at about 1300 million years ago, and the implication that because this corresponded to the time that mitochondria were introduced into eukaryotes, a horizontal gene transfer had occurred. Our calculations confirm this date, and we suggest that the gene transfer is most likely to have been from the protomitochondrion to the eukaryote host. 


Section:two base changes. thus, any single point mutation results in loss of the serine, and would doubtless result in loss of catalytic activity in a serine peptidase containing it. in line with expectation, only codons of the tcx group seem to be used for the catalytic set in the subtilisin family ($8).
