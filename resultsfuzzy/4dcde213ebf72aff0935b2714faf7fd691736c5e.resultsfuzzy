As important natural antioxidants, both monoflavonoids and biflavonoids effectively scavenge ROS. To compare their relative ROS scavenging levels, acacetin and its 3 ,8"-dimer isoginkgetin were examined by using the ·O 2 scavenging assay. This assay is based on the pyrogallol autooxidation principle [17] and was improved by our team in a previous study [18] . The improved pyrogallol assay demonstrated that the ·O 2 scavenging percentages of both the flavonoids were increased in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary 3 Figure S3 .1); however, acacetin had a higher IC 50 value than that of isoginkgetin (Table 1 ). This means that both flavonoids can act as an antioxidant to effectively scavenge ·O 2 -, a typical ROS. However, the higher IC 50 value means that acacetin is an inferior antioxidant to isoginkgetin. The IC 50 value is defined as the lowest concentration with 50% radical inhibition or relative reducing power, calculated by linear regression analysis, and expressed as the mean ± SD (n = 3). The linear regression was analyzed by using Origin 6.0 professional software. The IC 50 values with different superscripts ( a and b ) between acacetin and isoginkgetin are significantly different (p < 0.05). Trolox was used as the positive control. All dose-dependent curves are given in The mechanism of ·O 2 scavenging has been reported to involve ET [19] . To test the possibility of ET in this system, both flavonoids were comparatively examined using the Cu 2+ reducing assay in a pH 7.4 aqueous buffer. The results indicated that the amount of Cu 2+ reduced by acacetin and isoginkgetin increased in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary 3 Figure S3 .2), implying that these flavonoids possessed potential ET activity in a pH 7.4 aqueous solution. However, acacetin possessed a higher IC 50 value than isoginkgetin (Table 1) . Cu 2+ is not a free radical; however, the Cu 2+ reducing assay is similar to a radical scavenging assay. To fully explore their ET potential in radical scavenging, the two flavonoids were further measured by using the ABTS + · scavenging assay. The ABTS + · solution was prepared by an ET reaction (Section 3.4), where (NH 4 ) 2 ABTS was oxidized by K 2 S 2 O 8 to give ABTS + ·, a radical with a λ 734 nm absorption peak and dark-green appearance (Supplementary 4 Figure S4 .1) [20] . Thus, the ABTS + · scavenging assay is considered as an ET-based radical scavenging reaction [5, 21] . In the assay reaction, the (phenolic) antioxidant transfers one electron to ABTS + ·, which diminishes the λ 734 nm absorption (Supplementary 4 Figure S4 .1). The ABTS + · scavenging assay suggested that both acacetin and isoginkgetin effectively increased their ABTS + · scavenging ability with increasing concentration (Supplementary 3 Figure S3. 3), indicating that both flavonoids might employ an ET pathway to exert their antioxidant action. Nevertheless, the ET potential of acacetin was weaker than that of isoginkgetin, according to the IC 50 values listed in Table 1 . Combined with the Cu 2+ reducing assay results, it can be deduced that acacetin is indeed inferior to isoginkgetin in an antioxidant capacity through ET, and that 3 ,8"-dimerization can improve the ET potential of antioxidant flavonoids. As seen in Figure 1C ,D and Supplementary 2 Figure S2 , isoginkgetin contains two planar acacetin residues; however, the two planar moieties do not share the same plane. There is a dihedral angle of 45 • between the two acacetin planes. A similar dihedral angle can also be observed in other 3 ,8"-biflavonoids, such as (+)-morelloflavone [13] and amentoflavonoid [22] . The dihedral angle of 45 • implies that the two acacetin residues are partially planar, and thus, partial π-π conjugation can occur through the 3 ,8"-linkage. This partial π-π conjugation can slightly increase the ET potential, as seen in the Z-resveratrol molecule [23] . Thus, isoginkgetin possesses higher ET potential than acacetin. The ET antioxidant potential is known to be associated with the cytoprotective effect. Thus, our findings can be used to explain why 3 ,8"-biflavone amentoflavonoid possesses better chemoprevention and neuroprotective effects than its mono-flavonoid apigenin [24] [25] [26] . Previously, our group reported that phytophenols may generate dimers after incubation with free radicals [27] . To verify whether acacetin can give a dimer, it was treated with 4-methoxy-TEMPO for 24 h in this study. The UHPLC−ESI−Q−TOF−MS determination revealed that acacetin yielded a small chromatographic peak at a retention time of 1.8269 min ( Figure 2D ). This chromatographic peak was associated with a MS peak with m/z 566, a value of twice the molecular weight of acacetin ( Figure 2E ), implying the generation of one dimer of acacetin. This dimer further produced several MS/MS peaks, including those at m/z 565, 550, 413, 389, 374, 345, 330, and 283 ( Figure 2F ). In accordance with these MS spectra, this dimer was elucidated as that shown in Figure 3A . It should be emphasized that other possible linkages between the two acacetin residues cannot be excluded, such as 7-O, 5"-O, 6-C, 8-C, and 6"-C. If a C-O linkage is present, one of the phenolic -OH groups may be involved in the dimerization; thus, the dimeric product is presumed to be less active than the mono-flavonoid. Of course, the identification of the linkage will be the subject of further research in the future. Table 1 . Combined with the Cu 2+ reducing assay results, it can be deduced that acacetin is indeed inferior to isoginkgetin in an antioxidant capacity through ET, and that 3′,8′′dimerization can improve the ET potential of antioxidant flavonoids.

Of course, the identification of the linkage will be the subject of further research in the future. Suffice to say, this dimer is not identical to isoginkgetin. As seen in Figure 2I , the standard isoginkgetin yielded eight MS/MS peaks, including those at m/z 565, 533, 518, 489, 401, 389, 374, and 151. These MS/MS peaks can be elucidated, as shown in Figure 3B . The elucidation further suggested that acacetin does not produce isoginkgetin upon interaction with the methoxy-TEMPO radical. Nevertheless, the m/z values with high resolution suggested that there were several same moieties between the dimeric acacetin molecule and the isoginkgetin molecule. The typical m/z values included 565.1132, 389.0560, and 374.0416 in dimeric acacetin ( Figure 2F) , and 565.1137, 389.0647, and 374.0412 in isoginkgetin ( Figure 2I ). The relative deviations of these corresponding m/z values were calculated as 8.8 × 10 −7 , 2.2 × 10 −5 , and 1.0 × 10 −6 , respectively. Suffice to say, this dimer is not identical to isoginkgetin.
