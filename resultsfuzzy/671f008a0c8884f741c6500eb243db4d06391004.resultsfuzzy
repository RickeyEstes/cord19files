The specific binding of PEX19 to seven PMPs with diverse functions in metabolite transport (PMP70, PMP34, and ALDR), peroxisomal matrix protein import (PEX10, PEX12, and PEX14), and peroxisome membrane biogenesis (PEX3) strongly suggests that PEX19 is a broad specificity PMP-binding protein. We tested this hypothesis, as well as whether PEX19 could bind PMPs within human cells, using a completely independent assay. Specifically, we targeted PEX19 to the nucleus and asked whether this resulted in nuclear accumulation of newly synthesized PMPs. Wild-type PEX19 accumulates in the cytoplasm when overexpressed (Fig. 3 A) , but a form of PEX19 containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS/PEX19) is instead targeted to the nucleus (Fig. 3 , B and C). Normal human fibroblasts were cotransfected with plasmids designed to express a variety of epitope-tagged PMPs and either pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-NLS/ PEX19 . 4 h after transfection, the distribution of the newly synthesized PMPs was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. As expected for a PMP, PEX14myc was imported into peroxisomes in cells cotransfected with pcDNA3. In contrast, PEX14myc was found in the nucleus of cells that were cotransfected with pcDNA3-NLS/ PEX19 (Fig. 3 , D-F). This PMP was never detected in the nucleus in the absence of NLS/ PEX19 expression. NLS/PEX19 expression also resulted in the nuclear import of newly synthesized PMP34myc, ALDPmyc (a myc-tagged version of another nonperoxin PMP [Mosser et al., 1993 [Mosser et al., , 1994 ), PEX3myc, PEX11 ␤ myc, and PEX12myc (Chang et al., 1997; Fig. 3 , G-U). Similar results were observed for PMP70myc, ALDRmyc, PEX10myc (Warren et al., 1998) , PEX11 ␣ myc (Schrader (South and Gould, 1999) , PMP24myc (Reguenga et al., 1999) , and PMP22myc (Diestelkotter and Just, 1993 ; data not shown). To control for the specificity of this nuclear mislocalization assay we also examined the effects of NLS/PEX19 on the distribution of PTE1, a peroxisomal thioesterase (Jones et al., 1999) . PTE1 was imported into peroxisomes regardless of NLS/PEX19 expression (Fig. 3 , V-X). Similar results were observed for PECI, another peroxisomal matrix protein (data not shown). Furthermore, NLS/ PEX19 did not affect the distribution of PMPs that al-ready had been imported into peroxisomes, shown here by the presence of endogenously expressed PMP70 in vesicles with the typical morphology of peroxisomes in cells expressing NLS/PEX19 (Fig. 3 , Y-AA). All together, the nuclear mislocalization assay provided evidence that
