The average monthly temperature for the NWES nursery ranged from 8.4·C in April to 19 .6·C in August. At the SES, the lowest average monthly temperature was in March at -2.2°C. and the highest average monthly temperature was in June at 19·C. The lowest average monthly temperature of -2.4·C occurred in February at SP. and the highest average monthly temperature was in August with 19°C. On Males consumed significantly more DM from MR than did females because of higher average birth weights than those of female calves (43.8 vs. 40.0 kg). Amounts of MR consumed did not differ among treatments or locations (Table 3) . Milk refusals for each treatment and location were minimal. Low fat MR promoted higher starter DMI than did high fat MR through weaning. Other studies have reported similar decreases in starter DMI with additional milk or milk solids in the diet (4, 6, 7, 15 ). In addition, increased milk solids decreased intake of milk when fed for ad libitum intake (11). The MR treatment continued to affect starter DMI after weaning. Prior to weaning, type of starter did not affect DMI; but, after weaning, calves fed low fat starter consumed more DM than calves fed high fat starter. Calves fed high fat MR consumed less starter until weaning than calves fed low fat MR. After weaning, consumption of starter by all calves increased, but those fed low fat starter consumed more starter DM than calves fed high fat starter. Miller et al. (13) found that calves receiving 10 or 20% fat (OM basis) in starter had lower DMI than calves fed a control starter with no added fat. A sex x MR x starter interaction occurred for starter DMI from d 43 to 56 (P < .02). Both males and females consumed the most starter on the LL diet, and females consumed the least on the HH diet; however, males on the HL treatment consumed less than males on the HH diet. Prior to weaning, females consumed .55 kg/ d of starter DM compared with .50 kg/d by males. After weaning, females consumed 1.74 kg/d, and males consumed 1.68 kg/d. Location affected starter DMI before and after weaning: calves at SES and SP consumed more starter DM before and after weaning than did NWES calves; after weaning, SP calves also consumed more than SES calves. Lower intakes by calves at NWES likely were the result of differences in housing facilities, because SES and SP calves were raised in outdoor hutches, but NWES calves were housed indoors. McKnight (12) found that calves housed in hutches consumed more starter than calves in indoor facilities. The amount of fat in MR affected average daily gain (ADG) from d 14 to 42 ( In our experiment, fat added in either the MR or the starter did not improve ADG at any of the three locations. Calves for our experiment were 2 wk old at the start of the dietary treatments, which likely allowed them to tolerate cold stress better than a younger calf would. Scibilia et al. (19) reported that 6-d-old calves, raised in a -4·C environment for 3 wk and receiving additional fat in the liquid diet (25% of DM), had higher ADG than calves receiving a low fat diet (10% of DM). However, calves in the same study (19) raised at 10·C did not benefit from added fat. Gebremedhin et al. (2) found that the thermoneutral zone of calves housed in chambers was between 15 and 29·C and observed that ITreatments include high fat MR and high fat starter (HH), high fat MR and low fat starter (HL), low fat MR and high fat starter (LH), and low fat MR and low fat starter (LL). heat production of calves markedly increased at temperatures <soc. In the present study, temperatures in February, March, and April were below the thermoneutral range, but calves probably were not in a state of severe enough cold stress to benefit from the fat. Similarly, Stewart and Schingoethe (20) did not find an effect of a starter containing supplemental fat on intake or gain in mild winter conditions.
