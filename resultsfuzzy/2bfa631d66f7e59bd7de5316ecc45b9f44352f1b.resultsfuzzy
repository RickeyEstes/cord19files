It is useful to distinguish between the private decision problem (the decision-problem facing susceptible and infectious individuals, or those trading potentially infected animals or animal products) and the social decisionproblem (the decision-problem facing public health or sanitary authorities). The main elements of both problems are an objective function describing the decision-maker's goals, a constraint set describing the dynamics of the system being managed, a control or choice set-the mechanisms by which the decision-maker is able to influence those dynamics, and the feedback loops that link these components. To illustrate the EE approach, consider the private decision-problem faced by susceptible individuals seeking to manage the risks of an infectious disease of humans. Let the disease dynamics be described by a three-compartment (susceptible, infected and infectious, and recovered) discrete time S, I, R model: w ct , w ht , and w mt denote the costs of contact, C t , prophylactic measures, H t , and mixing decisions, M t SI . The function C(Á) is the rate at which susceptible individuals make contact with others within the population, b(Á) is the probability that an infectious contact results in infection, P(Á) is the conditional probability that a susceptible person will encounter an infected person-the outcome of susceptible individuals' mixing choices, and v is the recovery rate. In the simplest epidemiological models, the functions C(Á)b(Á) are assumed to be the same for all individuals regardless of health status. Indeed, it is common to find C(Á)b(Á) combined into a single parameter that assumes contacts to be proportional to the size of the population. Mixing is also commonly assumed to be homogeneous: i.e., P(Á) is assumed to take the form, I t /N. We make no special claims about the value of the S, I, R over other compartmental epidemiological models. We use it only to demonstrate an approach that has been applied to many different models. In EE models, the time paths of C(Á)b(Á) and P(Á) are derived from the solution to an economic decision problem in which individuals seek to meet their goals by choosing, respectively, the number of contacts they make, precautionary measures that reduce the probability that a contact will lead to an infection, and/or the effort they commit to avoiding contact with infectious hosts. One example of C(Á) allows contact choices to vary with health status, as individuals in different health classes make different choices . The contact function between susceptible and infected individuals takes the form: where C S , C I , and C R is a measure of the average number of contacts an individual in the health classj makes. Another example derives the contact rate from the individual's aversion to disease risk. The number of contacts an individual makes is assumed to depend on the exposure, and the resulting probability of infection, they are willing to accept (Aadland et al. 2013) . In both variants, the key implication is that contact choices vary over time, and by health class, in response to changes in the cost of disease and disease mitigation arising from changes in the states S, I, and R. Models that focus on mixing rather than contact decisions have their roots in the affinity-based mixing models developed in the 1990s to explore the consequences of the choice of with whom to mix with, rather than how much to mix (Dietz and Hadeler 1988; Busenberg and Castillo-Chavez 1991; Hadeler and Castillo-Chavez 1995; Morin et al. 2010; Galeotti and Rogers 2013) . In such models, susceptible individuals choose P(Á) rather than C(Á), the value of P(S t , I t , M t SI ) depends on the efforts susceptible individuals make to avoid mixing with infectious individuals. Whether people choose P(Á) or C(Á), their choices people depend on the costs and benefits of alternative actions. Specifically, people balance the benefits from making contacts (e.g., the benefits from buying or selling goods or services) against the costs of disease. They choose the number of contacts and/or the disease class with whom to make contact so as to maximize some index of wellbeing (utility), balancing the benefits of contact against the expected cost of disease and disease mitigation, conditional on the current states so that the choices change over time. The likelihood of becoming infected depends on the number of contacts made, and the riskiness of those contacts. Typically, the contact choices of a forward-looking susceptible individual are modeled as the solution to a dynamic programing problem: where q is a discount factor; Q Sj is the probability of transition from health state S to health state j conditional on the choice of C t S and/or M t S , and on the current state of the system (the health state of others); and V t+1 (j) is the future value of being in health state j. In solving the problem, people increase disease risk mitigation up to the point where the marginal cost of mitigation equals the state-dependent marginal benefit of reductions in disease risk. Because the choices people make change infectious disease transmission rates, they also change epidemiological dynamics. It follows that disease dynamics are sensitive both to the cost of disease (the income forgone during illness and the direct cost of illness) and the cost of disease avoidance. If the cost of disease is very low there is little incentive to avoid it, and disease dynamics will be those associated with proportionate mixing. If the cost of illness is very high, people will invest substantial resources in disease avoidance. In extreme cases, private decisions about selection of contacts can lead to an effective quarantine on infected individuals-an effect that would never occur in classical models. Disease dynamics are also sensitive to the benefits of contact. People trade-off disease risks against the benefits of contact. If there is much to be gained from contact they will accept much greater disease risks than if there is little to be gained (Areal et al. 2008; Fenichel et al. 2010; Gramig and Horan 2010; Horan et al. 2010) . Improved understanding of the behaviors that influence disease dynamics improves disease management. It increases both the number of control options open to public health authorities, and identifies how much public intervention is warranted. Depending on people's goals, their resources, and the opportunities open to them, the behavior of some individuals may slow epidemics, while the behavior of others can speed them up (Kremer 1996; Aadland et al. 2013 ). If the private and social costs of disease and disease avoidance are the same, then the decisions people make in their own self-interest coincide with the decisions they would make if they were acting with the interests of society in mind. If the private and social costs of disease and disease avoidance are different-if people make private decisions that are not in the social interest-then public health authorities can use an understanding of the private decision process to incentivize people to make different decisions. In so doing, they can minimize the expected social cost of the disease and its control. This opens up a novel set of disease management instruments aimed at confronting individuals with the external costs of their actions or compensating them for the external benefits their actions provide. Specifically, public health managers may select instruments that change the course of disease by changing contact and mixing incentives. The same costs of disease and disease avoidance that drive private contact and mixing decisions become potential points of leverage on contact and mixing behavior. If the social decision-maker is able to alter those costs through, for example, taxes, subsidies, access fees, penalties, and so on, then the social decision-maker is also able to change private behavior and disease dynamics (Francis 1997; Auld 2003; Francis 2004) . For example, where tracking mechanisms allow the sale of diseased animals to be traced back to a specific hub in the supply chain, opening the responsible individuals up to legal penalties provides them with an incentive to exercise care. By increasing the private payoff to actions that confer benefits on others, it is possible to enhance the public good even if individuals act only in their private self-interest (Francis 1997; Sandler and Arce 2002) .
