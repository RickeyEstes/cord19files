The nsp8 protein of the SARS coronavirus was cloned from the Tor2 Singapore isolate and expressed using the yeast twohybrid vectors resulting in an N-terminal in-frame fusion protein with the GAL4 activation domain (AD). Similarly the ORF6 protein was PCR cloned and expressed in yeast twohybrid vectors resulting in an N-terminal in-frame fusion protein with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD). In order to check for correct reading-frame constructs, the final plasmids were sequenced and checked for in-vitro protein expression. Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 cells were transformed with single plasmids, or co-transformed with the GAL4 BD-and AD-vectors containing SARS Co-V ORF6 and/or nsp8, respectively. The AH109 host strain containing pAS2-N and pACT2-N were used as positive controls (Surjit et al., 2004) . Cloning of the putative nsp8 and ORF6 genes from the SARS CoV genome. The full-length nsp8 (198 amino acids) and ORF6 (66 amino acids) genes of the SARS coronavirus (Tor2 isolate) were PCR-amplified from a genomic construct of clone NC_004718 and cloned into the pCR-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) as described in Table 1 . The scale on top shows genomic region. AH109 contains integrated copies of both HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes under the control of GAL4 binding sites. The results of the two-hybrid assay are shown in Fig. 2A . Single transformants used in this assay were yeast (AH109) cells containing BD-ORF6, and host cells containing AD-nsp8, also yeast cells containing only the BD-and only the AD-vectors, were also used as negative controls. All these transformants and co-transformants grew well on the unrestricted YPD plate (non- Fig. 2 . Yeast two-hybrid results showing that nsp8 and ORF6 proteins interact with each other. (A) AD-nsp8 fusion protein and BD-ORF6 fusion protein tested as single and co-transformants on various synthetic growth media lacking specific amino-acids. YPD media shows uninhibited growth of all transformants and host strain. SDTrp − and SD-Leu − selective media have Tryptophan and Leucine missing, respectively. SD Trp − Leu − His − media are triple dropout plates lacking Tryptophan, Leucine and Histidine. Growth on the SD Trp − Leu − His − plate and blue color (shown here in shades of grey) on the β-gal filter assay represents a positive interaction. BD-N:AD-N combination was used as a positive control in these yeast two-hybrid experiments (Surjit et al., 2004) . (B) Liquid β-galactosidase assay results of the nsp8-ORF6 protein-protein interactions. Single transformants and co-transformants were analyzed in a liquid β-galactosidase assay and compared with each other. Values given are in arbitrary units. The numbers above each bar represent the mean from five independent transformants. Y187 corresponds to the untransformed host strain. Transformants with more than one plasmid are separated by a slash. Positive controls used in this assay are denoted by BD-SNF1/AD-SNF4 (Harper et al., 1993) . (C) Measurement of strength of the nsp8-ORF6 interactions on an increasing 3-AT gradient. Activation of the HIS3 reporter was determined for the host AH109 strain, single transformants (BD, AD, BD-ORF6 and AD-nsp8), and co-transformants (BD-ORF6/AD-nsp8 and BD-N/AD-N). Hundred-fold serial dilutions of all of the above-mentioned log-phase cultures were plated on YPD (left) followed by SD-His-plus 50 mM 3-AT in increasing concentrations (0 mM to 5 mM 3-AT). selective media). Also, the untransformed host cells were plated as a negative control. Single transformants containing the BD-by itself or as a fusion with the ORF6 protein, showed growth on the synthetic dextrose Trp − plate (SDTrp − ). Correspondingly, single transformants containing the AD-by itself or as a fusion with nsp8 showed growth on the synthetic dextrose Leu − plate (SDLeu − ). The co-transformants were similarly plated on YPD and synthetic dextrose medium lacking Trp or Leu or Trp, Leu and upon positive growth on these was subsequently plated on His − medium (SD Trp − Leu − His − ) to test for His prototrophy. Growth of the co-transformants, containing the BD-ORF6 and AD-nsp8 constructs, in both SDTrp − and SDLeu − plates simply showed that both plasmids were present in the transformed cells. Growth of these clones on the SD Trp − Leu − His − media showed that the transcription of the HIS3 gene was turned on by the reconstitution of the GAL4 transactivator due to a specific ORF6-nsp8 interaction. Colonies were transferred on to nitrocellulose filters and a β-galactosidase filter assay was performed as described in methods. The co-transformants containing both the BD-ORF6 and AD-nsp8 constructs along with all positive and negative controls were used in this assay. Results obtained from the β-galactosidase filter assay were in agreement with the results obtained from the SDHis − growth experiments. The liquid β-galactosidase assay was conducted and the activity determined using the substrate chlorophenol red-β-Dgalactopyranoside (CPRG) as described in methods. The host strain alone, along with single transformants containing either AD-nsp8 or BD-ORF6 and co-transformants containing AD-/ BD-without a fusion protein was tested. Negative controls (host untransformed cells) showed almost no liquid β-galactosidase activity. BD-SNF1/AD-SNF4 was the positive control whereas the clones containing BD-ORF6/AD-nsp8 were the test samples in this experiment (Fig. 2B ). Relative enzymatic activity was determined in five independent transformants from each group. Our results from this assay indicate a moderate strength protein-protein interaction between the AD-nsp8 and BD-ORF6 proteins. This observation was further confirmed by the use of a 3-AT gradient on which the His + phenotype was tested (Fig. 2C ). 3-AT is known to be a competitive inhibitor of HIS3 protein, thus enhancing the stringency of selection, it reduces the background signal by inhibiting the product of the HIS3 reporter. This result clearly showed that the interaction of nsp8 with ORF6 was not as strong as the N-N dimerization positive control interaction. On plates with increasing concentrations of 3-AT, the growth ability of the His + colonies diminished and was almost undetectable at 5 mM 3-AT concentrations. To further confirm these interactions we performed a coimmunoprecipitation assay using proteins expressed by a cell-free coupled transcription-translation system. The rabbit reticulocyte lysates expressing His6-nsp8 and myc-ORF6 proteins separately were tested for expression ( Fig. 3A ). For detection of the expressed proteins, the lysates were immunoprecipitated using the respective antibodies i.e. anti-His antibody was used for detection of the nsp8 protein and antimyc antibody was used for the detection of the ORF6 protein. When the two cell lysates were mixed in equal proportions, one of the two antibodies was added and subsequently pulled out using Protein A Sepharose beads, we observed the interacting protein to be present in the gel as well. This procedure was repeated conversely to show the other corresponding antibody pull out the interacting protein partner as well (Fig. 3B ). When Fig. 3 . Confirmation of the nsp8-ORF6 interaction using an in-vitro cell-free coupled transcription/translation coimmunoprecipitation assay. (A) The His 6 -tagged nsp8 and myc-tagged ORF6 proteins were produced by coupled transcription-translation in the presence of 35 S-Met and detected using their corresponding antibodies (Anti-His and anti-myc, respectively). Both nsp8 and ORF6 proteins were visible and corresponded to their correct molecular sizes on 12% and 20% SDS-PAGE, respectively. (B) The 35 S-Met-His-nsp8 and 35 S-Met-myc-ORF6 proteins were detected by autoradiography. The nsp8-ORF6 complex was detected by both anti-His and anti-myc antibodies on 16% SDS-PAGE. When nsp8 was probed for using anti-His antibody, the ORF6 protein was visible and when ORF6 protein was probed using myc antibody, the nsp8 protein was visible. (C) In a control reaction, the 35 S-Met-His 6 -nsp8 and 35 S-Met-myc-ORF6 proteins showed no cross-reactivity with the other antibody used in the pull-down experiments. Also this control experiment shows that the proteins do not non-specifically bind to the beads used in the results shown in panel B. Lane 1 shows the nsp8 protein immunoprecipitated by anti-His, lane 2 does not show nsp8 protein band when immunoprecipitated by anti-myc. Similarly, lane 3 shows myc-tagged ORF6 protein immunoprecipitated by anti-myc and lane 4 does not show ORF6 protein where it was immunoprecipitated using anti-His. anti-His antibody was used to pull out the nsp8 protein from the mixture of proteins, it also pulled out the ORF6 protein. Similarly, when anti-myc antibody was used to pull out the ORF6 protein, the nsp8 protein was also observed to be pulled out as an interaction partner of ORF6. In a control experiment we observed no ORF6 protein binding directly to the anti-His antibody Sepharose-A complex and similarly observed no binding of the nsp8 protein to the anti-myc antibody Separose-A complex (Fig. 3C) . These results clearly showed that the two proteins nsp8 and ORF6 interacted with each other. In order to verify the interaction between nsp8 and ORF6 in mammalian cells, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using lysates obtained from Vero E6 cells expressing transiently transfected myc-tagged nsp8 and untagged ORF6 proteins carried by a replicative recombinant vaccinia virus. Myc-polyclonal antibody conjugated to protein A Sepharose beads was used to pull-down myc-nsp8 or myc-GST (negative control), and any ORF6 protein that coimmunoprecipitated was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide of ORF6 (Abgent). This antibody specifically detected the ORF6 protein (∼ 7 kDa) in cells that were infected with ORF6 recombinant vaccinia virus (Fig.  4, lanes 1 and 2) . As shown in Fig. 4 , ORF6 was co-immunoprecipitated by myc-nsp8 (lane 3) but not by myc-GST (lane 4), showing that the ORF6 and nsp8 proteins can interact in Vero E6 cells. In order to confirm that the interaction between nsp8 and ORF6 occurs during SARS-CoV infection, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with lysates obtained from SARS-CoV infected cells. Infection of Vero E6 cells with an isolate of SARS-CoV (strain HKU 39849) was carried out in a physical containment level 4 (PC4) laboratory as previously described (Kaye et al., 2006) . The cells were harvested at 0 or 24 h post-infection (h.p.i.) and the lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis to determine the expression of nsp8 and ORF6 proteins (Fig. 5) . Two specific proteins in the cells at 24 h. p.i. were detected with purified supernatant from hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies against the nsp8 protein (see Materials and methods) and these were not found in the cells harvested at 0 h.p.i. (upper panel, lanes 1 and 2). The protein that lanes 1 and 2) . Equal amounts of lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-myc polyclonal antibodies and protein A beads. The immuno-complexes were subjected to Western blot with either anti-ORF6 polyclonal (upper panel, lanes 3 and 4) or anti-myc monoclonal antibodies (lower panel, lanes 3 and 4). (B) Equal amounts of total cellular protein from Vero E6 cells either uninfected (lane 1) or infected with wildtype Dryvax (lane 2), a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the SARS-CoV S protein (lane 3), or the recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the ORF6 protein used in this study (lane 4) were subjected to Western blot and probed with anti-ORF6 rabbit polyclonal antibody. This demonstrates that the ∼ 37 kDa band seen in lanes 1 and 2 of panel A is a cross-reacting protein that is probably a vaccinia virus protein or an up-regulated cellular protein which is detected by the rabbit anti-ORF6 antibody used in this study. lanes 1 and 2) . Cell lysates obtained at 24 h.p.i. were then subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-Flag (irrelevant antibody as negative control) or anti-ORF6 rabbit polyclonal antibodies and protein A beads. The immuno-complexes were subjected to Western blot analysis with mouse anti-nsp8 monoclonal antibody (upper panel, lanes 3 and 4) . migrated at ∼ 24 kDa matched the predicted molecular mass of nsp8 while the slower migrating protein (∼ 65 kDa) may be an aggregated form of nsp8. As expected, the ORF6 protein was also detected at 24 h.p.i. and not at 0 h.p.i. (lower panel, lanes 1 and 2). Cell lysates obtained at 24 h.p.i. were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with either an irrelevant antibody (rabbit anti-Flag polyclonal antibody, lane 3) or rabbit anti-ORF6 polyclonal antibody (lane 4) and protein-A agarose beads. Western blot analyses showed that nsp8 protein (∼24 kDa) was co-immunoprecipitated when anti-ORF6 antibody was used but not when an irrelevant antibody was used, indicating that the nsp8 interacts specifically with ORF6 in SARS-CoV infected cells (upper panel, lanes 3 and 4) . Indirect immunofluorescence analysis of ORF6 expression in SARS-CoV-infected cells (Fig. 6, middle panel) showed that, consistent with previous publications (Geng et al., 2005; Pewe et al., 2005) , ORF6 was found in the cytoplasm. Most of the ORF6 protein seen in infected cells were observed in a punctate staining pattern consistent with a vesicle-associated intracellular distribution. Using the rabbit polyclonal antibody against ORF6 (Abgent) and purified supernatant from hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies against the nsp8 protein (see Materials and methods), cells infected with an isolate of SARS-CoV (strain HKU39849) were examined by indirect immunofluorescence to determine if the two proteins colocalized, as their interaction would suggest. The extent of colocalization seen between the two proteins was significant, both localizing to the same set of punctate structures (Fig. 6,  middle panel, D) . The punctate distribution of nsp8 has been previously described (Prentice et al., 2004a) and the colocalization of ORF6 protein with nsp8 suggests that ORF6 could be associated with the SARS-CoV replicase complex, localized to a subset of the vesicular trafficking complex in mammalian cells. These ORF6-containing vesicular structures did not colocalize with AP-1 and LAMP-2 (data not shown), which are present in early and late endosomes respectively. However, the ORF6 protein does colocalize with LAMP-1 (Fig. 7) , which is a lysosomal marker. LAMP-1 has been used as a marker for characteristic double-membrane vesicles seen in infections by other viruses (Jackson et al., 2005) and it has been shown that at least one other coronavirus induces these double-membrane vesicles, presumably as a site for the assembly of virus replication complexes (Prentice et al., 2004b) . Given this, the ORF6 protein might localize to these vesicles which have been suggested to be derived from the cellular autophagosomal machinery, but further study will be required. A recent structural study of the nsp8 protein has suggested a role for the nsp8-nsp7 hexadecamer in binding dsRNA intermediates in the viral replication cycle (Zhai et al., 2005) , further lending impetus to such a study. This is the first report describing the interaction between the ORF6 accessory protein and the nsp8 protein. We demonstrated the strength and specificity of this interaction by three independent methods, i.e. by yeast-2-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation using in-vitro translated proteins in a cell-free system and co-immunoprecipitation using lysates from Vero E6 cells. Interestingly, two previous publications on ORF6 have shed some light on its possible function in viral pathogenesis. Geng and co-workers detected ORF6 protein in lung and intestine of SARS patients and showed that it could stimulate cellular DNA synthesis when overexpressed (Geng et al., 2005) . Pewe et al. (2005) showed that when SARS-CoV ORF gene was introduced into an attenuated murine coronavirus, the recombinant virus grew faster in cell culture and also exhibited enhanced lethality of infection in mice. In contrast, Yount and co-workers reported that the SARS-CoV virus with ORF6 deleted has the same viral replication kinetics as the wild-type virus in cell-culture and mice (Yount et al., 2005) . Hence, ORF6 is non-essential for viral replication in these models although it cannot rule out that ORF6 (and/or the other accessory proteins of SARS-CoV) contributes to the virulence and pathogenesis of SARS coronavirus infection in its natural host. Further experiments in more robust animal models, like non-human primates that demonstrate clinical disease upon SARS-CoV infection, will be needed to determine the actual function of ORF6 during SARS infection in vivo. Since our data shows that ORF6 interacts with nsp8 which is part of the replicase complex (Prentice et al., 2004a (Prentice et al., , 2004b , it will be important in future studies to determine if the interaction between ORF6 and nsp8 can modulate the viral synthesis process and to determine how ORF6 modulates viral pathogenesis in these animal models.
