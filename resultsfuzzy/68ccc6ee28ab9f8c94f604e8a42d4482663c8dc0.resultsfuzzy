The estimation results in Table 7 showed that the parameters of all the models had the same signs, indicating the low probability of multi-collinearity. The obtained parameter signs satisfied expec- Thus, the CB questionnaires in this study proved to be appropriate for studying individual preferences. The results of Model 2 showed that income (ICM), part-time job (JBPTJ), high school education (EDHS), vocational college education (EDVC), and anxiety about being infected by the bird flu (AXBF) were not statistically significant. The results of Model 3 showed that the parameter signs of GND, AGE, JBTS, JBFP, JBST, EDJC, EDUV, EXKYOTO, and INTKYOTO were positive, while those of MAR, JBSOM, JBHM, and EDTC were negative. Finally, the statistically significant and positive sign of b ODR indicated that the probability of attaining a "yes" response was influenced by the order effect. The results of main variables by WTT periods from Model 2 are shown in Table 8 . The complete details of all results are shown in Note: N ¼ 2128. Standard errors are in parentheses. Number of respondents who answered "Never" appears in brackets. Appendix 2. The estimated parameters of main variables (from b safe to b TC ) without income parameters (b ICM ) are statistically significant in all periods, while the b ICM are statistically significant in first week and 52 week, though not in other periods. The parameter signs from b safe to b TC are same in Models 1 to 3. Furthermore, the signs of b ICM are negative from the 1st week to the 12th week, and positive from the 24th week to the 52nd week. Table 9 shows the simulation results for SC nosafe to SC full . The minimum and maximum values were 0.0934 and 0.2431 for the 1st week, 0.1095 and 0.2770 for the 4th week, 0.1646 and 0.3804 for the 12th week, 0.2855 and 0.5546 for the 24th week, 0.4476 and 0.7164 for the 36th week, and 0.6753 and 0.8664 for the 52nd week, respectively. Table 11 shows the results of the price discounting (prices after the discount) policy simulations. The minimum and maximum values were ¥9984 for SC ranx full and ¥56,867 for SC full , respectively. The applicability of the CB method and information policy effects were evident from the results of Model 3 in Table 7 . First, the signs of the parameters were as expected. Second, the results b visitor safe > b event safe and b visitor nosafe > b event nosafe indicated that the preference orderings were preserved. Thus, the CB method can be used to analyze tourism demand recovery from disasters. The orderings indicated that providing visitor information could be more effective than event information. Next, the ordering b safe > b visitor nosafe > b event nosafe indicated that safety information could have the highest effect among all information policies. Most tourists were not willing to travel to disaster sites without safety information. The ordering b visitor safe > b event safe > b safe indicated that mixed policies could have a greater recovery effect over single policies. These results also supported the applicability of the CB method for estimating preferences. The findings confirmed the mixed effects of safety and other information. A pure effect of event information was that b event safe À b safe ¼ 0.3020 >b event nosafe . Furthermore, according to the visitor information, b visitor safe À b safe ¼ 0.3836 >b visitor nosafe . These results indicated that mixed policies could generate synergetic effects. Moreover, the fact that the value of b safe was larger than the pure effect values indicated that providing safety information could have the highest effect. Table 8 indicates that the parameters of information policies totally tend to increase in spending periods (although there are cases of increment and decrement by periods). For example, the estimated parameters of IP safe (b safe ) are 0.3972 in the 1st week and 0.7098 in the 52nd week, respectively. The estimated parameters of IP visitor safe (b visitor safe ) are 0.7604 in the 1st week and 1.1833 in the 52nd week, respectively. The reason could be that the respondents' anxiety toward the bird flu outbreak decreased as time passed; respondents might come to think the bird flu outbreak would not occur. Thus, the travel cost parameters (b TC ) decrease from À0.0166 in the 1st week to À0.0311 in the 52nd week. This indicates that the price effects are enhanced over time due to an increase in the number of willing-to-travel respondents by reducing (overcoming) their anxiety. Table 8 also shows that the signs of ICM parameters (b ICM ) turned negative from the 1st week to the 12th week to positive from the 24th week to the 52nd week b ICM was statistically significant for the 1st week and 52nd week, and insignificant from the 4th week to the 36th week. The results indicated that tourism at disaster sites was an inferior good (that decreases corresponding to increments of ICM) in the period just after its occurrence, but changed to a normal good (that increases corresponding to increments of ICM) as time passed. This can be attributed to the fact that a tourism site in disaster would be considered a low-quality good that was not be preferred to other non-disaster tourism sites (Loomis & Walsh, 1997, p. 91) . Finally, the results for the individual characteristics indicated that the following persons were willing to travel provided information announcements were made: male respondents (because of their tolerance level, they typically suffer less anxiety about being infected by the bird flu compared to women); the elderly, temporary staff, freelance professionals, and university students (because they have ample free time to plan and travel); and those interested in traveling to Kyoto. Information policies could be effective at attracting these persons to travel. Otherwise, persons who were married, operating self-owned businesses, homemakers, and those educated at technical colleges were not swayed by information policies, possibly because of the fear of catching the infection themselves and/or infecting their children (the negative influence of tourists' perceived risks for tourism sites described in Law, 2006 and Rittichainuwat & Chakraborty, 2009 ). Furthermore, they could also possibly have little time to travel because of their jobs or study commitments (the substitution between work and leisure time described in Weiermair, 2006). Table 9 shows that information policies cannot help postdisaster tourism demand levels (the maximum was approximately 86.6% for SC full ) recovery to reach the pre-disaster demand level (92.6%). Overcoming the reasons for the rejection in Table 10 makes it possible for the post-disaster demand level to come close to the pre-disaster demand level (91.2% for SC allrr full ). Thus, an issue in recovering tourism demand is how to compensate for demand losses by the reasons for rejection.  The estimation results in Table 14 showed that only g visitor nosafe is not statistically significant. The signs of estimated parameters are same as Model 3. The ordering of degree of information policy parameters was also same as that of Model 3db visitor Otherwise, the results of interaction term variables showed that g event safe > g visitor safe > g safe >g event nosafe >g visitor nosafe ; the visitor information parameters were smaller than the event information parameters. Similarly, the ordering of pure effects of event and The estimation results indicated that safety information would have the highest effect on demand recovery. The ordering of event and visitor information are reversed with and without the time series factor. The reason could be that the visitor information based on the actual behavior might give respondents a sense of trust regarding the safety of a disaster site regardless of the periods. Deutsch and Gerard (1955) showed that an individual's behavior is sometimes influenced by the information obtained from another as evidence about reality. Furthermore, McFerran, Dahl, Fitzsimons, & Morales. (2010) showed that a part of the purchase behavior was determined by other consumers' purchase quantities. The parameters of visitor information show little changes as time passes by (also see Table 11 ). Second, combinations of these information policies would generate synergetic effects on tourism demand recovery with and without the time series factor. Third, the parameters of ICM Â D 1 and ICM Â D 52 in Table 14 showed that tourism at disaster sites would be an inferior good in the period immediately after the disaster, and thereafter, changing to a normal good with time. The third result and the negative sign of price parameter might also indicate that researchers would be allowed to analyze the cost-benefit ratio using the consumer surplus for reconstructing infrastructures in tourism sites in a year after the disaster (Johansson, 1987) . Finally, the AIC and R2 values of Model 4 indicate that it is more suitable for simulations due to the lower and higher values than the ones of Models 1 to 3, respectively. Table 15 shows the simulation results from Cases 1e5. As references, values in brackets show SC nosafe and SC safe values in Table 9 for Cases 1 and 2, respectively. The values of Cases 2e5 in the "1st week" column showed the recovery amounts by policies immediately after disaster site decontaminationdthe first is safety information, followed by visitor information, price discounting, and event information (Policy effect order 1; PEO1). The "52nd week" column showed that the order changes to safety information followed by visitor information, event information, and finally price discounting (PEO2). Thus, implementing safety information as the first step is valid. The result indicates the following: First, planning requires dynamic policy effect analyses because of the possibility of changing policies with time, in contrast to static analyses, due to lack of information. Moreover, it would be necessary to consider applicable tourism management frameworks, in disaster, corresponding to policy effect changes with time. Second, the pricing policy after solving a disaster will not have a significant effect, in contrast to previous studies, possibly due to respondents' anxiety matching income effects. Table 8 also shows that the b TC decreases from À0.0203 in week 36 to À0.0311 in week 52. This result indicates that rapid and broad announcements of information polices could be more important. The simulation results of price discounting also indicated that the low price design in the CB questionnaire might not cause bias due to the small differ-enced0.7238 and 0.7057 in 52 weeks for 80% and 40% price discounting in Table 15 , respectively. The simulation results from Cases 6e11 are shown in Table 16 . In the 80% price discounting case, the minimum and maximum values in 52 weeks are 90.83% in Case 11 and 91.50% in Case 6. Thus, the ordering of Case 6 could recover tourism demand in 52 weeks to near the standard demand level (92.6%). The result showed that the optimal policy ordering is Case 6, which implements safety information as the first step, followed by event information, visitor information, and price discounting, in contrast to the results of policy effect orderings in Table 15dCase 9 for PEO 1 and Case 8 for PEO 2. The results indicated that the policy orderings based on the effects would not be optimal, that is, they may not achieve the highest recovery of tourism demand due to the time delay (in Table 13 ) and the policy effect changes by period. The optimal policy ordering would be valid. After announcing safety information, policymakers and/or companies could encourage tourists to visit the site by events. Then, informing the situation, the price discounting could enhance the increment of the number of tourists. The validity of designing the price discounting in the final step is also supported from another viewpoint. Canina, Enz, and Lomanno (2006) stated that price discounting helps increase tourism supply (e.g., hotel rooms), but this comes at a cost to revenues. To elaborate, (extreme) price discounting might have a positive effect on tourism demand recovery, whereas it might deteriorate the finances of the government and/or the tourism company. The measurement of price discount rate without deterioration of finances of other stakeholders should be considered in future research. Finally, the optimal timing of implementing the policies is discussed based on Table 17 and drawn from Table 8 . Table 17 shows the changes of synergetic effects of mixed policies (b event safe À b safe and b visitor safe À b safe ) and b TC by WTT periods. Here, we assume two conditions: i) the policy ordering of Case 6 is employed and ii) the policies were implemented one by one. Announcing safety information in the first step as soon as possibledwithin week 1, immediately after decontaminating the disasterdwould result in faster tourism demand recovery at such sites. Since the b event safe À b safe values decrease from the 36th to the 52nd week, it is preferable to time the second step (event information) within 24th to 36th weeks after the disaster. The increment of b visitor safe À b safe values from the 36th to the 52nd week and condition (ii) indicated that it would be timed until the 52nd week after the 37th week for the third step timing (visitor information). Thus, it would be appropriate to implement the fourth step (price discounting) immediately after the third step due to the decrement of b TC values from the 36th to the 52nd week. In summary, it is preferable to implement announcing the safety information (the first step) within one week, the event information (the second step) within 24th to 36th week after the first step, visitor information (the third step) within 37th to 52nd week after the second step (e.g., 40th week), and the price discounting until the 52nd week immediately after the third step (e.g., 41th week). Note that the timing relies on the framework of this study. More proper policy timing analyses are needed for the (optimal) recovery process of restructuring infrastructures of tourism sites as described in Faulkner (2001) .
