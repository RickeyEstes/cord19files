Four lncRNAs were randomly selected for confirmation of microarray results using RT-qPCR. Data showed that, compared with HCo group, 4 lncRNAs showed similar expression tendency in both LTBI group and ATB group: ENST00000429730 and uc011ncc.1 were down-regulated, while ENST00000457582 and chr2:192293450-192304436þ were up-regulated in both LTBI group and ATB group; compared with ATB group, ENST00000429730 and uc011ncc.1 were increased, while ENST00000457582 and chr2:192293450-192304436þ were decreased in LTBI group (Fig. 4) . The results were consistent with those obtained by microarray analysis.
