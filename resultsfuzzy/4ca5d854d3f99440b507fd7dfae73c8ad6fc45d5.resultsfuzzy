Continuous UV-C radiation was then applied at a distance of 0.7 cm (FIGURE 1A) for various time intervals (10, 20, 30, 45 , and 60 sec). Reduction of bacterial growth was determined visually after 18 hours incubation at 37 °C. For this purpose, the number of CFU was counted on a defined area of 4 cm² per plate (FIGURE 1B) and compared to the number of expected CFU in an area of that size. All experiments were performed twice. Results: The corresponding killing curves are shown in FIGURE 2. A sufficient reduction ( 5 log steps) was achieved for S. aureus and E. coli after 10 sec already, but 20 sec were needed for the same effect on E. faecium. Discussion: Our results confirm that UV-C light from the device is capable of killing bacteria in principle. However, when using such a device for disinfection purpose in daily life, one has to keep in mind that 20 sec UV-C light exposition time was necessary in order to properly disinfect a rather small surface area from enterococci. Thus, much longer time intervals will be necessary for larger surfaces such as toilet seats. So there might be few opportunities when such a device could be a useful tool, but it seems less helpful on larger exterior due to time necessary for disinfection. Noteworthy, new batteries allowed an overall device working time of less than 15 minutes only.  The spa typing of the MRSA collection analyzed here identified spa type t003 as predominant spa type which was found in 28 isolates (60%), followed by t504 which was found in 11% (5 isolates). 38 isolates (81%) were positive for the ß-lactamase structural gene (blaZ) and its transcriptional regulators blaI and blaR. The resistance gene ermA, conferring resistance to macrolide-, lincosamide-, and streptogramine antibiotics, was found in 42 isolates (89%). Nearly all (96%) of the strains possessed a capsule type 5 genotype, and only one strain exhibited a capsule of type 8. The predominant accessory gene regulator (agr) type identified in this collection was type 2, which was found in 42 MRSA isolates (89%). 5 MRSA isolates were positive for agr type 1 (11%). All isolates were negative for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) ant tst (encoding the toxic shock syndrome toxin), but harbored the genes for the staphylococcal superantigen-like proteins C, 6/SSL1 and 7/SSL7. The enterotoxin gene cluster egc (comprising the genes seg, sei, sem, sen, seo, seu) as well as genes coding for enterotoxins M, N and U were found in 44 isolates (94%). The results of the genotypic and phenotypic characterization of the MRSA collection analyzed here will be compared with those of matched controls of patients of the same risk-factors colonized with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strains. Backround: Rapid detection of causative microorganisms in patients with bloodstream infections is crucial for the early initiation or adaption of adequate antimicrobial therapy. Objective: The goal of this prospective study was to evaluate a commercial PCR-based kit (SeptiFast, SF) for the detection of 25 clinically important pathogens in septic patients after liver transplantation (LTX) and major abdominal surgery (non-LTX). Methods: Overall 225 blood samples from 170 patients (46.5% after LTX and 53.5% non-LTX) with suspected sepsis were obtained in parallel for blood culture and SF over a period of three years at a tertiary care centre. Results: In total, SF and BC yielded concurrent results, negative in 110 (48.8%) samples and positive in 51 (25.3%). 35 (15.5%) blood samples were SF positive/BC negative. 23 (10.2%) samples were BC positive/SF negative of which in twelve cases the detected pathogens were considered to be contaminants. Using BC as gold standard the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of SF was for LTX 81%, 70%, 68%, 82% and for non-LTX 58%, 80%, 53%, 83%, respectively. Conclusion: In LTX and non-LTX patients SF yielded a higher positive rate than BC. The SF performance had a higher sensitivity and positive predictive value for the LTX patients, but lower specificity and negative predictive value compared to non-LTX patients. Objective: There is growing evidence that microgaps between dental implants and their abutments lead to bacterial contamination of the interior of the implants that might provide a reservoir for pathogens causing periimplantitis. The aim of this study was to investigate the intraimplant bacterial spectrum of two stage implants, and to compare the results of two different sample collection methods. Methods: Ten healthy patients without clinical symptoms of periimplantitis and with two-stage implants on each side wearing ball-attached removable prosthodontics took part in this investigation. Abutments were removed 56-105 months (median 63.1 months) after connection, and samples were obtained by i). collecting the intra-implant fluid (planctonic bacteria) and ii). by brushing the cavity (biofilm growth). Bacterial colonization was evaluated by aerobic and anaerobic incubation on agar and broth media. Isolated bacterial colonies were identified by means of MALDI-TOF identification, classical biochemical differentiation tests, and 16S rDNA sequencing. Results: Specimen from a total of 20 implants were investigated, resulting in 3 -25 (median: 16) different bacterial species per implant, representing a total of 105 different taxa. Streptococcus anginosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Veillonella parvula were found most frequently while periimplantitis marker bacteria such as Prevotella intermedia or Fusobacteria were only sporadically detected or not at all (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). Comparison of specimen collection by rinsing and by brushing showed a low consistency of results (median: 21 %). Most taxa per implant found were detected by brush collection (median: 62 % of species), however, only combination of both methods allowed complete analysis of the intra-implant microbiom. Conclusions: Our results suggest ubiquitous heavy contamination of internal spaces of dental implants, revealing a broad spectrum of bacterial species. For analysis of the intra-implant microflora the combined examination of both intra-implant fluid and cavity surface samples is recommended in order to cover biofilm-grown as well as planktonic microorganisms. The hybridoma clone UK-66 was the basis for the identification of the antibody binding domain against IsaA. The coding sequence was used to construct recombinant scFv and scFvFc fragments towards IsaA ( Fig. 1 ) and to humanised the murine antigen binding domain. The murine and humansed scFv fragment was expressed in E.coli and the murine and humanised scFvFc fragment was expressed in eucaryotic HEK293 cells. The scFv-and scFvFc fragments were characterized in their function and specificity by Western Blot analysis, ELISA-studies, immuno-fluorescence analysis and FACS experiments. The results revealed that all constructed fragments showed a high specificity towards IsaA and the property of the antigen binding fragments to detect IsaA on the cell surface of different S. aureus strains. Conclusion: IsaA is an antigenic structure expressed in vivo in different S. aureus strains. The murine anti-IsaA antibody is protective in animal models. The murine and humanised scFv-and scFvFc fragments showed a high specificity towards IsaA. For an improved treatment of infectious diseases the identification of optimized combinations of antibiotics is a promising approach. A major requirement for such investigations is the rapid testing of a moderate number of different compound combinations with a limited number of infectious agents. We developed a device for the combinatorial generation of compound mixtures by diffusion with concentrations over several orders of magnitude. Diffusion takes place in cell compatible polymer matrices such as agarose, gelatine or AB3 agar. Mixtures of test compounds are generated by a superposition of concentration gradients (2D-gradient). Only two pipetting steps are required to generate a series of assays that only depends on the spatial resolution by which the diffusion gradient is converted into a biological assay. The diffusion device is compatible with 12-well microtiter plates enabling the efficient testing of combinations of different compounds. The device is applicable for all diffusible compounds such as small molecules, peptides, lipopeptides and antibodies. Here we present the investigation of antibiotic combinations against different staphylococcal strains to define antibiotic combinations with additive and synergistic effects. The miniaturization, parallelization and especially the reduction of the number of steps required for the preparation of samples enabled the rapid and efficient screening of drug combinations on different microbial strains. Invasive fungal infections are a main cause for morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients and immunocompromised patients in the clinic and thus a growing health problem. Regarding the constantly growing number of resistant strains the discovery of new classes of antimycotic drugs is highly necessary. In a high throughput activity-selectivity screening a series of (S)-2aminoalkyl benzimidazole derivatives with strong antimycotic activity against Candida albicans was identified. A collection of analogues for a SAR-study was prepared in order to evaluate and improve the antimicrobial properties. We examined the activity of five of the (S)-2-aminoalkyl benzimidazoles against a set of twenty-one fungal strains including different type strains and significant clinical iso-lates of Candida spp. and confirmed the antimycotic activity. The most active com-pound 120B12 in this study showed potencies equal to that of fluconazole. Consequently, the novel non-toxic (S)-2-aminoalkyl benzimidazoles represent promising candidates for future developments in antimycotic drug discovery. Currently, studies with Caenorhabditis elegans are carried out. The Bavarian Health and Food Safety authority (Bayerisches Landesamt für Gesundheit und Lebensmittelsicherheit, LGL) provides several microbiological services for local health authorities in Bavaria. According to the German Protection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IFSG) § § 29-31 the public health system is responsible to ensure an adequate care of TB cases and in the following the performance of contact investigations to actively identify infected persons. In this context, the LGL maintains a TBlaboratory facility for the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infections. As the interferon-gamma-release-assays (IGRA) have been shown to improve the diagnosis (better specificity and sensibility than TST) especially of latent tuberculosis infections (LTBI) this test has been increasingly requested with more than 8500 samples in 2010 by health care workers and clinicians. IGRAs (e.g. QuantiFeron®-TB Gold In-Tube test and T-SPOT®-TB) measure a person's immune reactivity to specific mycobacterial antigens. Specimens are mixed either with peptides that simulate antigens of M. tuberculosis. These M. tuberculosis specific antigens (ESAT-6, CFP-10 und TB7.7) are lacking in all BCG strains and almost all non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) except M. kansasii, M. szulgai and M. marinum. In a person infected with M. tuberculosis, the white blood cells recognize the peptides and release interferon-gamma. Test result is based on the amount of interferon-gamma releas. At present the LGL supply the QuantiFeron®-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT) mainly due to operational advantages regarding the high-throughput of blood samples. The poster will give an overview about laboratory performance of QFT at the LGL. Salmonella enterica is one of the most common causes of human gastroenteritis worldwide. It is also responsible for nosocomial outbreaks particularly in developing countries. In Tunisia, many nosocomial outbreaks, occurred in pediatric services, have been involved various different serotypes, especially serotype Livingstone. In Belgium, the reported sporadic human cases of S. enterica serotype Livingstone infection is low. In this study, 43 S. enterica serotype Livingstone were analyzed. Most of them were isolated from human (31 strains from Tunisia and 10 from Belgium) and tow strains came from food products (pork and beef meats). Tunisian strains were isolated in the same hospital but during different periods (2002, n=1; 2004, n=1; 2005, n=27 and 2009, n=2) . All strains were characterized by antibiogramm, Multilocus sequence Typing (MLST) and virulotyping. This last technique was carried out by simple PCR of chromosomic genes (agfA, hin/H2, iroB, phoP/Q and sly A) and plasmids genes (spvA, spvB and spvC). Tunisian strains were resistant to amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ticarcillin, gentamicin, kanamycin and showed a particular -lactam resistance phenotype. Belgium strains were susceptible for the majority of the antibiotics. Further to MLST analyses, tunisian strains belonged to the same sequence type, ST543. For belgium isolates, 3 strains had a ST638 profile, 8 strains had ST543 profile and one strain had an unknown sequence type. Analyses of the virulence genes content showed that strains isolated in different years, in different origins (human and food products) and in different countries had the same virulence profile. They carried the same chromosomic virulence genes and the plasmidic virulence genes were lacked. Combination of different typing methods showed that the majority of belgium strains (8/12) and all tunisian strains isolated in different time periods are closely related; they belonged to the same sequence type (ST543) and had the same virulence profile. The topology of the dendrogram (Figure 1 ) generated from the spectra of the VRE isolates was in agreement with that inferred from the PFGE analysis ( Figure 2 ). Three different strains could be clearly identified. C1 was the index case and was held responsible for the transmission to all others beforehand. Epidemiological analysis revealed actually two transmissions; the first from patient C1 to C2 and the second from patient A1 to A2. Patient B was probably an already prevalent case. In the dendrogram, strain B is separated from the others but closer related to strain C than A. Discussio: MALDI-TOF MS provided results concordant to the PFGE gold standard and that in a fraction of time and costs. These results show great promise for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as an epidemiological tool for the real-time management of VRE outbreaks. In Cologne, the most prevalent spa type was t003 (32/38); t001, t018, t030, t032, t038, and t068 each in a single patient. Conclusion: SAB is a common infection in German hospitals associated with a high mortality. In Cologne, the most prevalent spa type is t003 which currently is also one of the most prevalent spa-types in Germany. The D58°C of C. sakazakii was 2.2 to 6.6 in CASO bouillon and 1.8 to 4.3 in the infant formula. Influencing factors were heat conductivity of media, culture conditions and state of cell growth. C. sakazakii is able to form biofilm on cellulose and polypropylene fibres under dry conditions. On cellulose fibres the bacteria were rod-shaped while on polypropylene coccoid forms occurred. C. sakazakii is approvingly sensitive to nitric acid. Sodium hydroxide (2.5 -3%) treatment leads to aggregate formations of the bacteria and to a total depletion after 60s incubation time. Conclusion: As C. sakazakii adheres to organic and synthetic filter materials, spray drying processes of milk based products are at risk for contamination. Therefore, pasteurisation process validation for all kind of heat exchanger and cleaning regimes with nitric acid and sodium hydroxide reduces this specific contamination risk. Cronobacter bacteria, formerly classified as Enterobacter sakazakii, have been implicated in several incidents as the cause of meningitis and enterocolitis with high mortality rates in premature infants resulting from feeding with contaminated powdered infant formula (PIF) [1] . PIF therefore is strictly recommended to be "sakazakii-free" which is defined as the absence of any colony forming unit in 30 samples of 10g of PIF [2] . In 2010, about 47% of all paediatric hospitals and 11% of all neurology departments in Germany made use of the offer of free enterovirus diagnostics. In the five years till end of 2010 a total of ~13,500 samples were tested; on average 2,500 samples annually. In about 65% of cases stool samples were tested, the remaining 35% were CSF samples. The age distribution of patients reflects the great interest of paediatric clinics on the enterovirus diagnostics: overall, about 83% of samples originate from children <15 years of age (median = 7 years). The seasonal pattern of samples sent for testing shows the classical dominance of enteroviruses during the summer months. The overall PCR-positivity rate amounts to ~30% (33.4% for stool samples and 19.6% for CSF samples). So far, more than 2,800 samples were serotyped and >50 different serotypes were detected (ECHO 30 most common). Polioviruses were not detected between 2006 and 2010, as expected. Of 20,007 specimen tested, 436 (423 throat/nose swabs, 13 wound swabs) were positive (prevalence, 2.2/100 admissions; 13,9% of total S.aureus); prevalence varied between institutions (0/100 -9.0/100). These figures are higher than those previously determined in other German APS programs, and they also differ from those previously reported from other central European regions or institutions. spa type 003 (ST225) was most frequent among MRSA followed by spa type 504 (previously rarely reported). A detailed risk assessment (multivariate analysis) revealed that previous MRSA history, chronic care, and presence of a skin wound/ulcer were significantly associated with MRSA carrier status. H Background: Increasing prevalence of clinical isolates of Vancomycinresistant enterococci (VRE) in patients of an ICU was noticed during 6 to 9/2010. Therefore a VRE screening was implemented to determine both the rate of colonisation at ICU admission and the rate of acquisition during ICU stay. Methods: From 10 to 12/2010 an universal VRE screening was introduced on an interdisciplinary ICU. Perianal swabs were taken from all patients at admission and once weekly until ICU discharge and analysed by culture for the presence of VRE. Pre-existing VRE carriage was assumed if samples taken within 72 hours after admission were positive; nosocomial acquisition was defined as a positive follow-up screening after a negative result at ICU admission. VRE-positive patients were characterised in detail and were monitored for developing VRE infections during hospitalisation. Results: 737 patients were screened for VRE at least once and 111/737 patients (15.1%) were positive. 126/737 (22%) patients could be included in the follow-up screening. Because 42/111 (37.8%) of the VRE-positive patients had been hospitalised for more than 72 hours before the first screening swabs, the distinction community vs. nosocomial acquisition could be made only for the remaining 69 patients. 32/69 (43.5%) of these patients were VRE carriers at ICU admission, 37/69 patients (56.5%) did acquire VRE during their ICU stay. The mean time from admission to first VRE detection was 20 days (range: 4-54) in the nosocomial cases. Interestingly, none of the VREpositive patients was previously known to carry VRE. A total of 37 (33.3%) patients had been treated with Vancomycin prior to VRE detection; 8 patients (7.2%) were known to be colonised/infected with Methicillin resistant S. aureus. Only 6/111 of VRE positive patients (5.4%) developed a definite VRE infection (3 bloodstream and 3 abdominal infections); 4 patients had an asymptomatic bacteriuria. Mortality in VRE patients was 14.4% (14/111) regardless to their VRE infection or colonisation status. Conclusions: Universal screening revealed a substantial VRE positivity rate of 15.1% including a high proportion of nosocomial acquired cases (56.5%). Reasons for the high VRE prevalence may be the previous Vancomycin therapy (33%). The clinical significance of VRE detection was low (5.4%). Neither did colonisation predict consecutive infection, nor was the VRE status associated with mortality. Therefore, we did not implement a universal VRE screening subsequent to this study period. Moreover, concerning infection control standard contact isolation precautions without single room isolation seemed to be justified. Further studies are warranted to determine the role of the environmental contamination especially in a setting of moderate hand hygiene compliance. E. Köster* 1 , E. Ott 1 , D. Sohr 2 , I.F. Chaberny 1 1 Hannover Medical School, Inst. for Med. Microbiology and Hospital Epidemiology, Hannover, Inst. for Hygiene and Environmental Medicine, Berlin, Deutschland Background: A routine surveillance for MRSA was established since 2001 at Hannover Medical School. In order to identify nosocomial transmission episodes molecular protein A (spa)-typing was introduced. Method: MRSA infections of all inpatients were analysed according to CDC definitions and were classified into nosocomial or imported cases from 2004 to 2007. Sequencing of the repeat region of the Staphylococcus protein A gene (spa typing) were performed from microbiological isolates of all MRSA infections. Results: In total 2,460 MRSA cases including 358 (14.6%) MRSA infections were detected. Surgical site infections were the most frequently type of MRSA infection (64.8%) followed by primary bloodstream infection (12.0%), pneumonia (11.7%) and urinary tract infection (11.5%). In addition, secondary bloodstream infections (10.6%) were detected. A significant reduction of MRSA infections was observed from 2004 to 2006 (OR 0.363; p<0.001). The spa typing revealed 49 distinct spa types. The spa type t032 (so called "Barnimer" strain) was the predominant strain type (68.4%) followed by t003 (4.5%), t020 (2.8%), t456 (2.5%), t004 (2.2%) and t022 (2.2%). The proportion of infections with secondary bloodstream infections were significantly associated with the spa type t003 (OR 6.75; p=0.004). The spa type t032 was significantly less associated to secondary bloodstream infections (p=0.041). Conclusion: The molecular spa typing provided additional information to the epidemiological associations during routine MRSA surveillance. The spa type t003 seemed to be a more invasive MRSA strain contrary to spa type t032. Further studies were needed to verify these observations.
