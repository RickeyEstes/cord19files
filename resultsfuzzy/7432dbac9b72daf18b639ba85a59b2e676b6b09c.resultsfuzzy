Demultiplexing and filtering yielded 57.8-79.7 million reads per sample, 85.1-89.0% of which were mapped on the bovine genome. Detailed results regarding read mapping, sequence assembly, locus annotation and transcript quantification were presented in detail in our previous report [19] . The results presented here focus on the different response of the cows on transcriptome level in whole blood with a specific emphasis placed on the different time point of antigen challenge relative to calving, pre-or postpartum.
