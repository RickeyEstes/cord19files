Initially, the aza-Michael reaction of isatin 1a with methyl acrylate 2a (1:1.2 ratios) was investigated in the presence of 10 mol % of the organo-NHC precatalyst, 1,3-dimesitylimidazolium chloride (IMes·Cl), in combination with various organic and inorganic bases in different solvents to optimize the catalytic conditions. Acrylates were used in slight excess (1.2 equiv) because of their volatile nature. The detailed reaction conditions and results are presented in Table 1 . For the preliminary study, base condition of the reaction was investigated in the presence of the IMes·Cl precatalyst in the selected solvent, dichloromethane (entries 1−6). The intended roles of the inorganic/organic base are (a) to generate in situ organo-NHCs from IMes·Cl and (b) to assist the organo-NHC catalyst-directed path in the aza-Michael reaction. The combination of the IMes·Cl precatalyst with relatively mild inorganic/organic bases (Et 3 N or K 2 CO 3 or 1,8diazabicyclo [5.4 .0]undec-7-ene (DBU)) resulted in a highly chemoselective aza-Michael addition in dichloromethane (DCM) to produce NS-isatin 3aa as the sole product (entries 3−5). On the other hand, the combination of IMes·Cl with the strong bases KOt-Bu and NaH resulted in the formation of 3aa along with other unidentified products (entries 1 and 2). The best result was observed under the IMes·Cl/DBU condition with high chemoselectivity and the maximum yield of 81% (entry 5). Surprisingly, in contrast to other entries, IMes·Cl/ DABCO produced a MBH product from 1a and 2a (entry 6). Because DABCO is a weaker base than DBU in terms of pK a (pK a values of their conjugated acid in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO): Et 3 N−H + pK a ∼ 18.82, DBU−H + pK a ∼ 24.34, and DABCO−H + pK a ∼ 8.9), 52 it is not sufficient for capturing the NH proton of isatin, but sufficient for mediating the MBH reaction. Under the optimal condition of entry 5, we also compared the catalytic efficacy of four well-known organo-NHC precatalysts (entries 5, 7−9) to prove that NHC catalysis can produce chemoselective aza-Michael adducts consistently. To enhance the performance of entry 5, we studied the solvent effect in sequence. No considerable improvement was observed in the solvents MeOH, EtOH, CH 3 CN, and CHCl 3 in either the reaction time or the yield of 3aa (entries 10−13). In the case of the THF solvent, the IMes·Cl (A) is sparingly soluble in the solvent to present a very low yield (entry 14). At this juncture, we tried to add a catalytic amount of more polar solvent DMSO to the IMes·Cl/DBU system to improve the solubility and the reaction rate with the related reports of Arduengo and others. 53, 54 The white turbid THF solution containing IMes·Cl/DBU ( Figure 2a ) became a clear, light yellow solution immediately on the addition of DMSO ( Figure  2b ), which indicates the fast generation of in situ organo-NHC. A further quick change in color from yellow to wine red was observed upon successive addition of 1a after 2a (Figure 2c ,d) with the supposition on the proton loss (N−H) of 1a during aza-Michael addition. Therefore, the click-type rapid chemoselective aza-Michael addition took place between 1a and 2a in less than 1 min at RT to provide a 93% yield of 3aa (entry 15). Next, with the impressive reaction time and yield, the efficiency and reaction scope of our optimized reaction was investigated. First, the loading amount of catalysts was only modified under the optimized condition (entry 16). Under the condition of 5 mol % of NHC and 5 mol % of DBU, the product 3aa was acquired with a slightly reduced isolation yield and elongated reaction time (67%, 60 min), showing the importance of the catalyst loading scale. It is worth noting that this catalytic system could catalyze the same reaction even at 0°C (entry 17). In addition, we attempted a one-pot synthesis of the aza-Michael reaction followed by the MBH reaction. The NHC catalyst activity was tested after completion of the aza-Michael addition in the reaction mixture. The reaction between 1a (1 equiv) and 2a (1.2 equiv) was conducted with the 10 mol % NHC/DBU catalyst system. After 1 min, 1a was completely converted to 3aa, whereupon one more equivalence of 2a (1.2 equiv) was added to the reaction mixture. Surprisingly, 5aa was formed with a low yield (entry 18). An additional reaction was initiated with 1a (1 equiv) and 2a (2.5 equiv), under the 10 mol % NHC/DBU catalyst condition. In
