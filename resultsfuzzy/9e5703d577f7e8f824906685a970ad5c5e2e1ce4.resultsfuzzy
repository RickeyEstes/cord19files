The SARS-CoV PLpro-(1600-1858) fragment is capable of catalysis The crystal structure of SARS-CoV PLpro suggested a catalytic domain between the residues 1542-1858 of the SARS-CoV polyprotein [11] . The first 62 residues form an independent Ub like domain, whose significance in the catalytic activity is not well understood. Initially we analyzed the catalytic activities of PLpro with and without the Ub like domain. Their kinetic parameters are summarized in Table 1 . The k cat of PLpro-(1600-1858) is slightly higher than that of PLpro- (1541-1858) , while the K m of PLpro-(1541-1858) is about 2.5-fold lower and k cat /K m is twofold higher. The results indicated that their catalytic abilities are quite comparable. The results suggested that the PLpro-(1600-1858) fragment, which contains the palm, thumb, and zinc-finger domain (Fig. 1A) , is sufficient and active in terms of catalysis. Next, the unfolding of PLpro-(1600-1858) (shortened to ''PLpro'' below) was studied to delineate the functional roles and stability of its three constituting domains.
