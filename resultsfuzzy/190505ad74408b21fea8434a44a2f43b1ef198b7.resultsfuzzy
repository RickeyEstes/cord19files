The key intermediates for the synthesis of ethyl 1-[(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino]-2-methyl-5-(1methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-4-[(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)carbonyl]-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylates 10a-e are the β-diketones 12a-e prepared in good yields (45-70%) from N-methylindoles 11a-e by a Friedel-Crafts reaction using malonyl dichloride in dichloromethane, as previously reported [22] (Scheme 1). One-pot reaction of the latter with 1,2-diaza-1,3-diene (DD) 13 in tetrahydrofuran and in the presence of CuCl 2 ·2H 2 O as catalyst furnished the corresponding ethyl 1-
