The set of 48 digital chest radiographs (25 normal and 23 pathologic) described in Section 2 has been used in the experimental validation of the proposed method. The testing procedure performs a leave-one-out process, which consists in removing one image from the data set, , and takes the rest of images as the training set, . Image is classified against using LBP histograms and the 6 classifiers described above (GDAV, DV, and CV; using discrimination matrix or not). If the predicted class is different from the real class of , then there is a classification error. This process is repeated for all the available images. The success rate of a classifier is defined as the number of correctly classified images with respect to the total number of images. In a problem of binary classification, as the present one, the expected error rate of Table 1 : Success rates (as a percentage from 0 to 1) of classification using GDAV, DV, and CV methods, with and without discrimination matrix. The best result for each classifier is marked in bold. In the male/female tests, only those classes are included in the training and testing process. a completely random classifier would be 50%. The fact that some experiments, for example, GDAV method in the male subset, produce a higher error is an evidence of the complexity of the tackled problem. Besides the implicit difficulty of the problem, the small number of images available poses an additional challenge. To get a sample of all possible variations of sex, age, pathologies, and so forth, some thousands of radiographs would be necessary. For example, some classifiers in Table 1 produce better results with the complete set than with only the male/female set. There is not a method clearly yielding the best accuracy for all the tests, although voting schemes, DV and CV, usually obtain less error rates. Figure 7 shows that the correct selection of the threshold, specially in CV method, can affect greatly its effectiveness. In CV, the optimum threshold appears to be near 0, as it would be expected. Regarding the comparison between using or not the discrimination matrix, there is very strong evidence that using it has a big benefit in the obtained results. Almost all methods achieve a significant improvement applying the matrix of weights, with an average of 21% higher accuracy. The best result is obtained with CV method, giving 87% of correct classifications. Considering the set of all images, the optimum classifier is DV with discrimination matrix, producing 79% of accuracy. A relevant limitation of our data set is that the areas of abnormality are not marked in the available pathological images; indeed, these radiographs may contain many normal regions. This fact hinders the distinction of normality. The improvement achieved by using the discrimination matrix shows that this problem has a great effect in the results. A greater benefit could be obtained if pathological areas were precisely marked in the training samples.
