SNAP inhibited SARS-CoV replication at non-toxic concentrations (222 M) with a selectivity index of 2.6 ( Table 1 ). The NO concentration released by 222 M SNAP is between 30-55 M NO. No protective effect below the CC 50 could be demonstrated for SNP. The difference in activity between these two NO donor compounds might be explained by a different mechanism of releasing NO. SNAP is a direct donor of NO and generates NO in aqueous solutions through hydrolysis, while SNP only releases NO after reaction with a reducing agent. [10] [11] [12] No protective effect could be obtained with N-acetylpenicillamine (NAP), which is the non-nitrosylated form of SNAP and does not release NO in solution ( Figure 1 ). These results illustrate that the protective effect of SNAP is a consequence of NO release and not of a potential solitary antiviral effect of the N-acetyl-penicillamine moiety. In this study, we provide additional evidence that NO and NO-donors may have an antiviral effect against the SARS-CoV and we speculate that the prolonged effect of inhalation of NO gas observed earlier could be an antiviral effect of NO against SARS-CoV. Based on our results we encourage the inclusion of inhalation of NO in the treatment of SARS. NO-donors, including SNAP, have been described as potential therapeutics in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. 13 To confirm the anti-SARS-CoV effect of NO gas and NO donors and before SNAP can be used in SARS treatment, additional in vivo experiments are required. As resurgence of the SARS outbreak is a distinct possibility, the search for antivirals effective against the SARS-CoV remains an important endeavour.
