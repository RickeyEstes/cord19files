In order to construct a decision tree, we analyzed the nature of the mutations exclusively associated with amyloid formers using an algorithm and accompanying visualization program that we have previously developed [22, 23] . Results indicate that most of the mutations that occur exclusively in CDR residues or in FR residues of amyloidogenic derivatives are most likely the biggest contributors to misfolding, with 69% of the mutations in exposed CDR resulting in a general increase in sheetforming propensity, as opposed to the 36% in buried FRs (Figures 1 and 2 ; Table 2 ). In contrast, the complements (31% for exposed CDRs and 64% for buried FRs) resulted in decreased sheet-forming propensities. We used these information as branch weights for an initial decision tree (Table 3) ; before establishing the weight thresholds for classification, however, we checked if paths taken by amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic derivatives can be generalized. Interestingly, we found no consensus paths for either amyloidogenic or Figure 1 Normalized mutation matrices of amyloidogenic (Column A) and non-amyloidogenic derivatives (Column B) of 12 antibody germlines. Original residues are in rows and corresponding replacement residues are in columns. The amino acids have been arranged according to increasing b-sheet forming propensities [54] . The intensity matrix of the difference between the amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic matrices (Column C) reflects the relative predominance of a mutation type in either amyloid or non-amyloid formers. A fourth matrix set (Column D) is used to indicate the mutations that occur exclusively in amyloidogenic derivatives. Separate matrices were generated for mutations in buried CDR, exposed CDR, buried FR and exposed FR positions. non-amyloidogenic sequences; instead, consensus paths appear to exist for each germline ( Figure 3A , Table 4 ). Consequently, we constructed a second decision tree which takes the germline of origin into account, as the case was in the Bayesian analysis. Depending on the germline, weights along selected paths are either boosted or decreased ( Figure 3B , Table 4 ). Thresholds for separation were chosen to maximally distinguish samples in the training set (Table 5) , and are evaluated using the holdout test set. Table 6 lists the classification results per germline.
