The 20 sporadic isolates were classified by MLST in 9 Sequence Types (ST) all but one belonging to the 5 same Clonal Complexes as epidemic clones (CC5, 8, 45, 22 and 30) . SCCmec type distribution among sporadic strains was as follow: type I: 9 isolates, type IV: 7, type III: 2, type II and V: 1 isolate each. SCCmec type IV was associated with the greatest number of different STs (5). Based on MLST combined with SCCmec typing, 12 clonal types were identified, only 5 of which were identical to those of major Belgian epidemic clones. The 20 sporadic isolates belonged to 16 spa types of which up to 6 were shared with epidemic strains. Conclusion: The majority of sporadic and epidemic MRSA strains identified over a 11-year period in Belgian hospitals share common genetic background. Although, only half of sporadic MRSA strains belong to the same ST-SCCmec type as epidemic strains, suggesting that resistance cassette type and other epigenetic markers are involved in conferring the epidemic behaviour of MRSA.
