At 4°C. strong cleavage occurs after the second, third and fourth nucleotides in loop 2 (U17, U,, and U19) (Fig. 2) . At 22°C and 37"C, weaker cleavage also occurs in loop 1 and after the other nucleotides in loop 2 (data not, shown). The molecule is completely resistant to cleavage by RNase T, (specific for single-stranded G) at temperatures at and below 37°C. Nucleotides in loop 2. which bridges the minor groove, are more accessible to single-strand-specific probes than t,hosr in loop 1; this is also observed for the pseudoknot formed by TYMV RNA (van Belkum et al., 1988 .

Cleavage is observed after each of the nucleotides in stem 1 although cleavage is weak after G, and C, 5. In stem 2, cleavage occurs following each nucleotide on the 5' side of the stem (Cs through CIZ). Weak cleavage after G,,-, cannot be correlated to the pseudoknot structure, since a hairpin containing only the stem 2 region shows the same sequence-specific pattern of RNase V, cleavage (data not shown). On the 3' side of stem 2, cleavage is observed only after residues G,, and UZ3. Lack of cleavage near the 3' terminus of stem 2 is consistent with RNase V, cleavage of other hairpins and duplexes. RNase V, does not cleave single-stranded control molecules; cleavage after loop nucleotides U7 and U,, is correlated with stacking. The solvent accessibilities of the three adenosine residues in the oligonucleotide were compared over a range of temperatures using diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEP) (see the following paper; Fig. 2 ). The carboxyethylation reaction at the N-7 position is sensitive to stacking (Peattie & Gilbert, 1980) . Both A,, and A,,, residues in stem 2 of the pseudoknot structure, show the same extent of modification throughout the temperature range from 4°C to 85°C. As expected for nucleotides in duplex regions, A l1 and AX are only slightly reactive at low temperatures. The mid-point of the percentage cleavage versus temperature curve is approximately 65"C, roughly the same as the optically observed melting temperature (see the following paper). Below 45"C, A,, the first nucleotide of loop 1, is about one third as accessible to modification as it is in the denatured oligonucleotide at 85°C. The midpoint of the melting transition of A, is approximately 5 to 10 deg.C lower than that of A,, and A,,. The DEP modification data, like the cleavage patterns obtained using enzymatic probes, support the existence of stem 2. The increased DEP modification of A, as compared with the adenosine residues in stem 2 suggests that this residue is part of a loop region; however, A, also shows a melting transition so it is partially protected from solvent by the folding of the pseudoknot. Loop 1 is proposed to bridge stem 2 across the major groove of the helix. The n.m.r. spectrum of the exchangeable imino protons in 5 mM-MgCl,, 50 mM-NaCl, 10 mM-sodium phosphate (pH 6.4) at 4°C is shown in Figure 3 . The total of eight base-paired imino resonances is consistent with pseudoknot formation. The two resonances farthest downfield, at 13.92 and 14.35 p.p.m., The resonances below 11.5 p.p.m. are most, likely due to non-hydrogen-bonded imino protons on uridine residues. The imino resonances were assigned using one-dimensional NOE measurements. An NOE is observed between protons that are less than 45 to 5.0 A apart. Since the inter-base-pair distance in both A-form and B-form helices is approximately 3.5 to 3.8 A, an NOE is expected from an imino resonance of one base-pair and the imino protons corresponding to the two flanking base-pairs. In addition, uridine imino protons involved in a Watson-Crick A. U base-pair will have a strong NOE to the adenine H2, which is separated by only 1.9 A from the imino proton. The assignments of the imino protons are summarized in Figure 3 (b) and Table 1 . imino resonances 4, 5 and 6 from the core of stem 2 remain. Resonance 4, which corresponds to the terminal C12. Gzz base-pair of stem 2, remains relatively sharp up to 5O"C, whereas the imino resonance from G3. C1 3 pair 3 has completely broadened. The sequential order of broadening of the imino resonances could be due to differences in either the thermodynamic stability or the kinetic behavior of the two stems. Data discussed in the following paper support the latter. The region between 7.0 p.p.m. and 8.6 p.p.m. contains resonances from AH8, GH8, CH6 and UH6 as well as AH2 protons. For the oligonucleotide described here, this region should contain 29 resonances. UH5, CH5 and sugar Hl' protons resonate in the region between 5.0 p.p.m. and 6.2 p.p.m. The spectrum can be significantly simplified in these two regions through selective deuteriation. Deuteriation of pyrimidine residues at the 5 position is experimentally straightforward for either the nucleotides or the DNA or RNA strands (Wataya & Hayatsu, 1972; Brush et aE., 1988) . Since 11 of the 26 nucleotides of the oligonucleotide are uridine residues, UPT deuteriated at the 5 position was incorporated using T7 RNA polymerase. The region between 5.0 p.p.m. and 62 p.p.m. is significantly simplified by the elimination of 11 UH5 resonances. Deuteriation of UH5s also improves the appearance of the 7.0 to 8.6 p.p.m. region of the spectrum because the UH6 resonances are singlets; the presence of deuterium in the H5 position eliminates the splitting of these resonances. The first step in the assignment of the nonexchangeable spectrum was the identification of uridine and cytidine H6 resonances. The COSY spectrum of the deuteriated oligonucleotide exhibits six cross peaks due to H5-H6 J-coupling (not shown), and allowed the unambiguous identification of the six cytidine H6 and H5 resonances. Figure 5 shows the H8/H6 to Hl'/H5 region of the 400 millisecond mixing time NOESY spectrum. Strong cross peaks arise at the chemical shifts of the CH5-H6 protons in the NOESY spectrum due to the short fixed 2.45 A. This NOESY spectrum was compared with the NOESY spectrum of the non-deuteriated molecule under identical conditions. Strong cross peaks missing in the NOESY spectrum of the deuteriated molecule, due to UH5-H6 interactions? permitted the identification of 6 of 11 UH6 resonances; the other uridine resonances were not sufficiently resolved to allow assignment. The assignment of the pyrimidine residues aids in the confirmation of the aromatic to HI' assignment paths shown in Figure 5 ; the paths are consistent with both sequence and secondary structure. Connectivity path 1 (Fig. 5(a) ) encompasses nine nucleotides: 3' U-C-R-C-C-R-R/U-U-C 5' (R is a purine). Only one region of sequence is consistent with this assignment path: 3' U16-C15-G,4-C,3-C,2-A~~-G~c-U~-Cs 6. This path spans the two-stem regions of the pseudoknot. Connectivity path 2 ( Fig. 5(b) ) encompasses five nucleotides: 3' R-R-C-U/R-R 5'. This path corresponds to the 3' terminus: 3' G26-A25-C24-U23-G22 5'. Both regions are double-stranded stems on the basis of assignment of the imino spectrum and chemical and enzymatic mapping. One-dimensional NOES from the two A. U imino protons allowed assignment of the resonance at 7.02 p.p.m. as A,,(H2) and that at 7.71 p.p.m. as A,,(H2). Both AH2 positions have NOE connectivities to two Hl' protons. A,,(H2) has NOES to G,,(Hl') and G,,(Hl'); A,,(H2) has NOES to C12(Hl') and &(Hl'). These NOES from AH2 to the S/-neighboring HI' on the same strand and the Hl' proton across strand in the 5' direction are exactly those expected for an A-form helical geometry. Both assignment paths can be confirmed using the 3' H8/H6 * 5' H2' and Hl'-H2' NOE cross peaks (see below). The final connectivity path ( Fig. 5(b) ) involves the stem region at the 5' terminus. The purine at 7.77 p.p.m. is assigned at G,(H8), since it has a NOE to its own H1'(5*94*p.p.m.), and to the C,(Hl') (5.71 p.p.m.). The C,(H6) (7.93 p.p.m.) was the only unassigned CH6-CH5 cross peak in the COSY spectrum. The C,(H5) (5.96 p.p.m.) has a second weak cross peak at 5.50 p.p.m. due to a small amount of 5' hairpin structure present . The 5'-terminal G I (H8) was identified by incorporation of dsGMP during transcription. Since T7 RNA polymerase preferentially primes synthesis with GMP rather than GTP, the d*G is selectively incorporated at position 1 (Sampson & Uhlenbeck, 1988). G,(H8) (8.24 p,p.m.) has a NOE to its own Hl' (5.90 p.p.m.) and to the C,(Hl'). NOE connectivities are also observed between loop 1 nucleotides ( Fig. 5(b) ). The farthest downfield aromatic resonance at 8.53 p.p.m. is assigned as A, (HS) and the resonance at 821 p.p.m. is A,(H2). These assignments were confirmed by the presence of both these resonances after incorporation of d*GTP (data not shown). The A,(HB) has a strong cross peak to the A,(Hl') at 6.09 p.p.m. The UH6 at 7.74 p.p.m. has a NOE to the A,(Hl'). This proton, assigned as the U,(H6), also has a NOE to the U,(Hl') at 5.78 p.p.m. Further assignments are summarized in Table 2. (ii) Nueleotide conformation: sugar pucker The individual nucleotide conformations can be determined using both J-coupling and NOE information. Scalar (J) coupling information is used to characterize the sugar conformation as north (approx. C-3'-endo, 1' = 18") or south (approx. C-2'. endo, P = 162"). For smaller RNA molecules, the sugar conformation can be more precisely determined using additional coupling information (i.e. H2'-H3', HY-H4') (Davis et al., 1996) ; this information is limited in the case of the 26 nucleotide molecule studied here. The two families of puckers represent points of minimum energy for the pseudorotation phase angle, P (Olson & Sussman, 1982; Olson, 1982) . Since the rate of interconversion between these two conformers is fast on the n.m.r. time-scale, the value of J,,,, for a nucleotide is an average of J,,,, for north (J,,, < 1 Hz) and south (J,,.,, = 8-O Hz) conformers weighted by the relative population of each. An empirical formula for determining the percentage of each conformer has been described (van den Hoogen, 1988): (yoN = 114.9-14.5. (J1,.2,) , showing NOES between H8/H6/H2 and H5/Hl' protons. NOES between H8/H6 and Hl' protons are indicated by continuous lines and those between AH2 and Hl' are indicated by dotted lines. Labeled NOE cross peaks indicated a NOE from that nucleotide's aromatic proton to its own Hl' sugar proton. Conditions were: 5 mM-I$$&, 50 mNaC1, 10 mm-sodium phosphate (pH 64) at 23°C. The mixing time was 466 ms. (a) H8/H6 to Hl' NOE connectivity pathway 1, which spans nucleotides Ui6 to Cs. (b) H8/H6 to Hl' NOE connectivity pathway 2 spans G,, to G,, and from G, to C,. Note that there is no NOE between G,,(H8) and G,(Hl'). The broken line indicates the NOES between A, and U, in loop 1.
