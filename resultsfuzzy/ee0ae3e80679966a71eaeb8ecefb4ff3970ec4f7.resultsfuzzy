The amino-terminal region (region 1) of IBV N protein (amino acids 1-133) was cloned and expressed in Tuner (DE3) E. coli (Novagen) and purified as described previously [2, 31] , with the additional step of gel filtration chromatography. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A ) demonstrated that purified IBV proteins were obtained. The SARS-coronavirus N protein has been reported to be unstable [33] and also certain regions difficult to purify [34] . To confirm that the purified IBV amino-terminal protein was folded, a technique described by Kingston et al. [35] was used. Uniformly isotopically labelled protein was expressed in minimal media containing 15 N and 2D-HSQC spectra obtained by solution state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). For a folded protein that does not aggregate, 1 H-15 N HSQC spectra exhibit dispersed and well-defined peaks for most side chain amide protons and backbone. The distribution of peaks on the spectra for the amino-terminal region indicated that the protein fitted these criteria indicating that the protein was in a folded conformation (Fig. 1B) . SPR was used to investigate the interaction of the amino-terminal region with viral RNA. Previously, this system has been used to determine the RNA binding properties of IBV N protein to an IBV leader sequence, which contains the TRS, as a model for the viral genome [2] . Similar binding studies have utilised the murine coronavirus leader sequence [36, 37] . The viral RNA used in this study consisted of a biotin group at the 5 0 end followed by the 90 nucleotide leader sequence up to and including the translation initiation codon ( [2] ).

Briefly, the biotinylated IBV leader sequence was immobilised on a strepavidin sensor chip (BIAcore) and varying concentrations of the protein passed over. The resultant sensogram ( Fig. 2A) , analysed using BIAevaluation software (BIAcore), was different from that obtained with native N protein [2] (and this study). The association rate for the binding of the amino-terminal region to viral RNA was 2.8 · 10 4 (1/Ms), the dissociation rate was 0.0404 (1/s) with an overall binding affinity to RNA of 1430 nM (v 2 = 7.5). This is in contrast to the high affinity binding ($1 nM) of N protein to leader RNA observed in a previous study [2] (and similar to this study). In both cases the kinetic data fitted to the Langmuir 1:1 binding model indicating that co-operative binding mediated by protein:protein interactions did not occur. The recently solved crystal structure of the amino-terminal region of IBV N protein [24] highlighted the presence of a basic cluster of amino acids, which we hypothesise may form electrostatic interactions with viral RNA. The binding of the aminoterminal region to leader RNA was analysed using SPR with increasing concentrations of NaCl, which we predicted would disrupt electrostatic interactions [38] . The kinetic data obtained revealed that increasing the NaCl concentration from 150 mM to 300 mM reduced the association rate of the amino-terminus to 10.4 (1/Ms) (v 2 = 1.64), an approximately 2000-fold reduction (Fig. 2B) , whilst 500 mM NaCl abolished binding (data not shown). This experimental data would support the model in which electrostatic interactions play a key role in the binding of the amino-terminus of N protein to RNA. In order to determine whether native N protein was reliant on these electrostatic interactions to facilitate high affinity binding with viral RNA, SPR analysis was extended to the full length N protein (Fig. 3A) , which bound to target RNA with a binding affinity of 2 nM, with an association rate of 7 · 10 4 (1/Ms) and dissociation rate of 1.41 · 10 À4 (1/s) (v 2 = 10.4). To assess the effects of increased salt in the buffer the binding kinetics of IBV N for leader RNA were analysed at 150, 300 and 500 mM NaCl. The resulting sensograms (Fig. 3B) show that the addition of 300 mM salt decreased the overall binding affinity of N protein to RNA (11 nM). Although unlike the amino-terminal region there is a large proportion of full length protein retained on the RNA at the end of the dissociation period (Fig. 3B ) (dissociation rate 0.012 1/s). This data suggests that interactions are stronger between full length N protein and RNA than those of the amino-terminal region. Therefore, interactions other than electrostatic, such as hydrogen bonds or base stacking may stabilise the total protein/RNA complex. Interestingly, analysis with BIAevaluation revealed that the association rate of full-length protein for viral RNA increased with the addition of NaCl to the running buffer, until a decrease was observed at 500 mM salt. A similar result was observed for the binding of MetJ to the met-box DNA operator regions [39] . In which the addition of salt to the SPR buffer resulted in an increase, and subsequent decrease at higher salt concentrations, of association rate. A plot of log of the association rate (k ass ) versus log[NaCl] (Fig. 3C ) has a 'bell shape' distribution often observed for a sliding mechanism [40] . This occurs when the protein ''slides'' along the nucleic acid in a one-dimensional non-sequence specific manner, mediated by electrostatic attractions, until it meets its target sequence or structure to which it can bind specifically. In the case of N protein and viral RNA this target sequence could be the TRS. Certainly the binding affinity of N protein for a non-viral RNA is approximately the same as viral RNA when the non-viral RNA contains a TRS [2] . CD spectroscopy was used to determine whether the structure of the amino-terminal region of N protein altered during association with viral RNA, as has been predicted for the native protein [36] and occurs with other viral RNA binding proteins. Many common secondary structure motifs, such as the a-helix, b-pleated sheet, b-turn and random coil, have characteristic CD spectra [41] . Therefore, CD allows the detection of gross protein conformational changes, and can be utilised to monitor changes in secondary structure upon ligand binding. Here, it was used to assign secondary structure to the amino-terminus and full length N protein and to determine whether these proteins altered upon binding viral RNA. CD measurements were taken in the far-UV (180-260 nm) using initial protein concentrations of 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 mg/ ml, the resultant sensogram is shown in Fig. 4A . There was no significant difference in the CD spectra between these concentrations and therefore 0.4 mg/ml of the amino-terminal protein was used in subsequent experiments. This protein was analysed in the absence and presence of leader RNA with a molar ratio of 1:1, in six independent experiments (representative CD spectra is presented in Fig. 4B ). Leader RNA alone was analysed by CD at these wavelengths and no adsorption was observed (data not shown). Secondary structure content for each spectra was calculated using DICHROWEB [42] which utilises a series of algorithms to provide calculated secondary structure content and allows direct comparison of cal- culated structures and experimental data (Table 1 ). This analysis of the real time solution structure of the amino-terminal region of IBV N protein suggested a large proportion of bsheet, turns and random coils, which is in close agreement with the solid state crystal structure [24] . There was no significant difference in this solution structure of the amino-terminus with and without viral RNA, suggesting that no gross conformational change occurs. In contrast, CD analysis of the binding of the leader RNA to N protein resulted in a conformational change of the protein (Fig. 5 ) indicated by the change in the CD profile between the presence and absence of RNA. For example, DICHROWEB revealed that the percentage of a-helix changed from 21% to 16% in the presence of leader RNA. The data suggests changes in the secondary structure of N protein are required to accommodate the viral RNA. Previous equilibrium binding studies have shown that the amino-terminal region of IBV N protein binds to viral RNA [4] . However, little is known about the underlying mechanism and kinetics of this interaction. SPR analysis allowed the monitoring of the formation of complexes in real-time and provided simultaneous equilibrium and kinetic information [43] . The dynamic nature of protein:RNA interactions may be a key feature in the regulation of a number of biological mechanisms. The rate of binding and release may influence processes such as the ordered assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes (encapsidation of viral RNA), movement of RNA:protein complexes between sub-cellular compartments and competition for binding sites. Elucidation of the partial crystal structure of N protein revealed that conserved basic amino acids in this region lie within close proximity to form a positively charged cluster [9, 23, 24] . The resulting data indicated that electrostatic interactions, most likely between this basic cluster and the negative phosphodiester backbone of RNA, play a central role in binding. However, other bonds may important in the stabilisation of N protein with viral RNA. Similar to that proposed for U1A protein [26] , we hypothesise that the amino-terminal region of N protein forms longrange non-specific electrostatic interactions with RNA (a 'lure' step). This brings the full-length protein within close proximity to the RNA, and may facilitate sliding, until specific interactions form between viral RNA (perhaps mediated via the TRS) and N protein (forming a 'lock' step). We postulate N protein may locate its target TRS and other high affinity binding sites via a sliding mechanism. Prefixes denote the type of secondary structure and figures refer to the proportion of a particular structure in the molecule (scored out of one). The average values and standard deviations of the six experiments are shown in bold face. The Student's t-test was used to determine whether there was any significance (P < 0.05) between the two data sets.
