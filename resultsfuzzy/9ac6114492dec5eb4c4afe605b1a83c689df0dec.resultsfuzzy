In the electronic supplementary material, we consider whether the results shown in figure 5 are robust to alternative disease severity formulations. One alternative formulation reflects the assumption that T cells can secrete cytokines that contribute to disease severity, and that these secreted cytokines do not simply amplify, but contribute additively to peak E levels. This assumption leads to the alternative disease severity for- where a is a parameter quantifying the production rate of endothelial activators by T cells. This formulation reproduces the relationships between the virological indicators and peak levels of E observed with the original disease severity formulation provided in equations (4.1) (electronic supplementary material, figure S2 ). With this alternative formulation, however, an individual with high T-cell counts but low viraemia can experience a high risk of developing severe disease, a pattern that is not supported by the literature [29, 67] . Returning to equation (4.1) to describe endothelial activator dynamics, we can alternatively consider the risk of severe disease to be proportional to the total amount of endothelial activators secreted during the infection ( . This alternative formulation also reproduces the described relationships between the virological indicators and the risk of developing severe disease (electronic supplementary material, figure S3 ). However, this disease measure incorporates cytokine dynamics after vascular leakage has occurred, making it, to some degree, biologically unreasonable. The incorporation of post-defervescence cytokine dynamics also generates more scatter in the relationships between the virological indicators and the risk of developing severe disease.
