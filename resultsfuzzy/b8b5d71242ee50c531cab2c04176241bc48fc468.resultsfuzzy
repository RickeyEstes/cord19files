A challenge experiment was performed using highly virulent IBDV to evaluate the protection efficiency of genetically engineered Lactobacillus strains. Loss of appetite and depression were caused in most chickens on day 3 post-challenge. In the next few days, white watery stools occurred, especially in the PBS group. Results in chickens given two booster immunizations showed that both pPG-eGFP-vp2-SP/M-11 and pPG-eGFP-vp2/M-11 had good protective effects with a rate of 80% (12 chickens) and 60% (9 chickens), respectively. By contrast, chickens in the PBS group developed severe clinical signs of infection and died by 1 week post-challenge ( Figure 6E ). Twenty percent of the chickens in the pPG/M-11 group survived with mental depression and reduction in food consumption. IBDV replication often leads to extensive lymphoid cell destruction in the bursa of Fabricius. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the bursa of Fabricius on the 7th day after challenge showed that bleeding points in the vaccine groups were less than those in the pPG/ M-11 group and PBS group ( Figure 7A) . However, follicular atrophy, massive necrosis of lymphocytes, connective tissue hyperplasia, and macrophage infiltration existed in the vaccine groups, the pPG/ M-11 group, and the PBS group. Chickens which survived the acute phase of the disease recovered from clinical disease. Figure 7B shows the shrinking of the bursa that appeared in all the surviving chickens on the 14th day post-challenge. Interestingly, the shrinking in the pPG-eGFP-vp2-SP/M-11 group was less than that in the pPG-eGFP-vp2/M-11 group (p < 0.05). Results in chickens with one booster immunization ( Figure 8A) showed that both pPG-eGFP-vp2-SP/M-11 and pPG-eGFP-vp2/M-11 had a good protective effect with rates of 62.5% (15 chickens) and 37.5% (9 chickens), respectively. Figure 8B shows the bursa in each group. Figure 8C shows that the shrinkage in the pPG-eGFP-vp2-SP/M-11 group was less than that in the pPG-eGFP-vp2/M-11 group (p < 0.05). From the above results, it can be concluded that, with the participation of SP, the protection efficiency increased.
