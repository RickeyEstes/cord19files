Chain Termini of the SARS-CoV M pro Influence Catalytic Activity Two different gene constructs coding for the SARS-CoV main proteinase were used in this study. One of them ([DSer1]/ C-His 6 ) has the last two residues at the C terminus of the protein (Phe305 and Gln306) replaced by a hexahistidine tag, while the codon for the N-terminal serine has been replaced by the start codon, AUG. As we can demonstrate by Edman degradation (not shown), the corresponding formylmethionine residue was cleaved off during synthesis in Escherichia coli, most probably by methionyl-aminopeptidase (Hirel et al., 1989) , creating D(Ser1)/C-His 6 M pro . The other construct (''authentic M pro '') carries an N-terminal GST-AVLQ tag that is autocleaved by the protease itself, and a C-terminal GP-H 6 tag which can be removed Ribbon diagram and surface representation of the dimeric SARS-CoV M pro (protomer A in blue, protomer B in light orange). The catalytic dyad residues (Cys145 and His41) in both monomers colored by atom (yellow, carbon; red, oxygen; blue, nitrogen; green, sulfur). The N finger (residues 1-7) is colored magenta for monomer A and green for monomer B. The very N terminus is marked by a sphere. It interacts with residue Glu166 of the opposing monomer. The oxyanion loop is colored red for monomer A and dark brown for monomer B. by PreScission protease, so that the final proteinase product possesses the authentic N and C termini (Xue et al., 2007) . The difference in enzymatic activity and dimer stability between the two constructs illustrates the importance of an intact N terminus (N finger). The k cat /K M of the (DSer1)/C-His 6 protein, determined by using an HPLC-based assay with the pentadecapeptide SWTSAVLQYSGFRKWA as a substrate, was 61.9 (±1.5) mM À1 min À1 (Tan et al., 2005) . Using a FRET-based assay with a fluorogenic peptide substrate (Dabcyl-KTSAVLQY SGFRKME-Edans), this value was 167.9 mM À1 min À1 . The K D value for the monomer-dimer equilibrium of this enzyme species was estimated at z250 nM by using the method of Kuo et al. (2004) , much lower than the values derived for a similar construct by Graziano et al. (2006) from small-angle scattering and chemical crosslinking. Accordingly, the fraction of catalytically active (DSer1)/C-His 6 dimers at the enzyme concentration used in the assays (1.0 mM with respect to monomers) is about 0.8, and the k cat /K M of this enzyme species has to be corrected to z209 mM À1 min À1 . The M pro with the authentic chain termini, however, is significantly more active under the same circumstances and has a k cat /K M value of 502.3 mM À1 min À1 . For the latter enzyme, the K D value for dimer dissociation was estimated to be significantly lower than 100 nM, in agreement with most reports in the literature Hsu et al., 2005b) . This would indicate that > > 90% of the authentic M pro molecules exist as dimers at the concentration of 1.0 mM (with respect to monomers) used in the assays. Occasionally, much higher K D values have been reported for SARS-CoV M pro dimer dissociation in the literature (e.g., Fan et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2005a) , but in most of these cases, the enzyme did not have authentic chain termini. For the authentic enzyme, we determined K M = 2.2 mM and k cat = 1105 min À1 , whereas for (DSer1)/C-His 6 , the respective values were 0.24 mM and 40.3 min À1 (prior to correction for dimer dissociation; see above). Thus, the authentic enzyme, although displaying a 10-fold larger K M value, exhibited a 27fold higher activity than (DSer1)/C-His 6 . The crystal structures presented below provide an explanation for this observation.
