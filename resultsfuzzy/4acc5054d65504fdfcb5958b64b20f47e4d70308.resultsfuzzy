Chemistry. The first group of derivatives (12e18) was prepared by synthesizing various bis-alkylthio maleimides 4a-10a from 3,4dibromomaleimide 3, followed by subsequent ethoxycarbonylation of the maleimide NH group [23] making compounds 4b-10b suitable for conjugation to the N-terminus of teicoplanin pseudoaglycon 11 (Scheme 1). Although we have described this path earlier [24] for the synthesis of compounds 4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18 , this time we also prepared the bis-n-butylthio and bis-n-hexylthio maleimide derivatives (5 and 6) for the sake of the systematic approach in this study. We also prepared the asymmetrically substituted maleimide variant 9 that has an n-propyl and n-dodecyl function. The second series of derivatives contains similar maleimidederived side chains as the previous group, but these are attached through a triazole linker to the glycopeptide core, in order to increase the distance of the lipophilic chains from the pseudoaglycon. In this synthetic procedure we prepared N-propargyl maleimides 19e24 by reaction of the corresponding N-ethoxycarbonyl maleimides (4b-8b, 10b) with propargylamine. Finally, an azide-alkyne click reaction was carried out between azido teicoplanin pseudoaglycon 25 [9] and maleimides 19e24, yielding final products 26e31 (Scheme 2). The third group of derivatives carrying maleimide substituents differs from the previous one in the structure of the linker, which in this case contains a tetraethylene glycol segment besides the triazole ring as in compounds 1a and 1b. By introduction of the tetraethylene glycol fragment, the overall lipophilicity of the compounds is reduced, while the crucial lipophilic substituents are still incorporated in the structure. This linker modification proved to have a substantial effect on the biological profile of the molecules (see below). The compounds suitable for this type of modification (33e39) were prepared by the simple reaction of N-ethoxycarbonyl Scheme 1. Synthesis of maleimide derivatives 12e18 (Series 1) with double lipophilic tails by direct coupling of 4e10 to teicoplanin pseudoaglycon 11. Scheme 2. Conjugation of the bis-alkylthio maleimide derivatives 19e24 to azido teicoplanin pseudoaglycon 25 through a triazole moiety (Series 2). maleimides 4b-8b, 10b, 32b and triethylene glycol 2-aminoethyl propargyl ether. Subsequent click reaction with azido teicoplanin pseudoaglycon 25 gave glycopeptides 40e46 (Scheme 3). The fourth type of modification we describe here was based on our previous results mentioned above. Although compounds 2a and 2d possessing single, relatively long alkyl chains were highly active against influenza virus, they also displayed considerable cytotoxicity [21] . (For the sake of clarity, these compounds are listed as a separate series, i.e. Series 4 in Table 1 . The structures can be found in Fig. 1.) We speculated that this high cytotoxicity might be related to a combination of two factors, the first being high lipophilicity of the side chains in contrast to the hydrophilic pseudoaglycon part, which may cause a membrane-disrupting effect. This might be enhanced by the simple structure of the alkyl chains, which could facilitate insertion of these molecules into biological membranes. In our previous work [21] we attached two very bulky substituents (a perbenzylated disaccharide and a calix [4] arene carrying tert-butylsubstituents) to the same pseudoaglycon (2i and 2j). Calculated logP values for these compounds indicated higher lipophilicity than e.g. the n-hexadecyl or n-octyl derivatives 2a and 2d. These derivatives did not produce profound cytotoxic effect, supporting our hypothesis that cytotoxicity is determined by the combination of the lipophilicity and bulkiness of the substituents. It needs to be mentioned here, that in the A2 components of teicoplanin the ÃŸ-Dglucosamine on the D-ring is N-acylated by similarly simple acyl chains, yet these compounds seem to be harmless to mammalian cells. Therefore, the overall lipophilicity of the molecules may also influence cytotoxicity. Since the introduction of alkyl chains proved to be promising in terms of antiviral activity, we decided to insert the tetraethylene glycol linker between the core and these substituents, in order to decrease lipophilicity as in the case of maleimide derivatives, which again caused a significant change in biological properties. First, the mono-azido derivative of tetraethylene glycol 47 was utilized in a click reaction with alkyl propargyl ethers 48e51, yielding triazole derivatives 52e55. These were O-alkylated with propargyl bromide to provide compounds 56e59, which were used in the last step in a CuAAC reaction with azido teicoplanin pseudoaglycon 25 to obtain derivatives 60e63 (Scheme 4). Finally, by the reaction of teicoplanin pseudoaglycon with different sulfonyl chlorides 64e71 we prepared sulfonamide derivatives (72e79) (Scheme 5). This type of derivatization was attractive mainly because of its simplicity and high stability of the sulfonamide bond. Despite this, to our knowledge no one has thus far reported this type of derivatives of teicoplanin or related glycopeptides. Biological evaluation. The anti-influenza virus activity was determined in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells using a reported cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction method, in which CPE is assessed by microscopy plus formazan-based cell viability assay [25] . In parallel, cytotoxicity was determined in mock-infected cells. Table 1 summarizes the data for three human influenza A strains (including an A/H1N1 2009 pandemic strain) plus one influenza B strain. Series 1, maleimide derivatives 12e18, showed variable activity against the four influenza virus strains tested, but neither of them proved as potent as compound 1a. Only compounds 17 and 18 displayed quite consistent activity against the four strains. Curiously enough, neither the double n-propyl nor the double ndodecyl substituted maleimide moieties yielded active compounds, while the combination of n-propyl and n-dodecyl chains (compound 17) led to notable activity. The fair activity of compound 18 carrying a double galactose substituted maleimide was accompanied by modest selectivity with an SI of 5 [selectivity index (SI): ratio of MCC to average EC 50 ]. This indicated the need for structural modification in order to reduce the cytotoxicity. Series 2 (26e31) containing the triazole linker was, overall, more successful against influenza virus with somewhat lower cytotoxicity than the first series. Namely, antiviral activity was seen in the case of compounds 27, 28 and 29 which contain double nbutyl, n-hexyl and n-octyl chains, respectively. The presence of the linker highly altered the behavior of these compounds, since the analogous derivatives in the previous series (i.e. no triazole linker) with the same alkyl chain lengths were inactive. 29 displayed robust antiviral activity and a favorable SI of 10, whereas 27 and in particular 28 still had poor selectivity. 30 with the double ndodecyl moiety remained inactive, but became less cytotoxic, which was a general finding in Series 2. Sadly, the double galactose substituted derivative lost its activity on introduction of the triazole linker. The biological results for Series 3 (40e46) demonstrated that by introducing the tetraethylene glycol linker, cytotoxicity was generally reduced, while the anti-influenza virus activity was retained in the n-butyl (41) and n-hexyl (42) derivatives, and even increased in the n-octyl (43) analogue. Since the tetraethylene glycol element seemed beneficial, we also prepared a derivative with double tetraethylene glycol side chains (46), but this modification did not yield an active compound, probably because it misses the lipophilic moiety that proved to be essential for anti-influenza virus activity (see conclusions). Surprisingly, despite the lack of lipophilic moieties, compound 46 proved to be highly cytotoxic. Ultimately, 41 stood out as the most promising compound in this group, with very low cytotoxicity and robust activity against all tested strains, yielding a nice SI of 16. The activities of triazole derivatives (2a-j) in Series 4 have already been published [21] elsewhere. These data are shown again, considering the systematic approach in our present report and the structural analogy to some of the compounds in this work. Surprisingly, among the alkyl substituted compounds, only the nhexadecyl (2a) and n-octyl (2d) derivatives showed high activity, while the attachment of n-dodecyl (2b) and n-decyl (2c) side chains led to inactive compounds. However, all four derivatives had very high cytotoxicity. 2e with a n-hexyl side chain and compounds with aromatic substituents (2f, 2g) were only mildly active with Scheme 3. Conjugation of bis-alkylthio maleimide derivatives equipped with an N-TEG-propargyl moiety (33e39) to azido teicoplanin pseudoaglycon 25 gave Series 3 (40e46). c Cytotoxicity expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC; compound concentration producing minimal changes in cell morphology, as estimated by microscopy) or the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ; estimated by the MTS cell viability assay). Data represent the means of two to five independent tests. moderate cytotoxicity. Interestingly, 2h and 2i (a perbenzylated lactose and a calix [4] arene derivative) displayed moderately high activity which was accompanied by only modest cytotoxicity, despite their very high calculated logP values indicating much higher lipophilicity when compared to 2a. As stated above, the explanation could be that, although these molecules are very lipophilic, their bulky structures may lead to an inability to disrupt cellular membranes as is the case for alkyl derivatives. To further investigate how the tetraethylene glycol linker impacts the cytotoxicity, we synthesized Series 5, derivatives 60e63, which are analogous to the alkyl chain-containing triazole derivatives in Series 4. We speculated that introduction of the linker would boost the antiviral activity and reduce the cytotoxicity compared to the published compounds. Indeed, compound 63 (an analogue of 2c) showed excellent antiviral activity and reasonable cytotoxicity compared to 2c which is highly cytotoxic and devoid of anti-influenza virus activity. Interestingly, lowering the length of the alkyl chain (analogues 60e62) did not yield effective compounds. Also for the sulfonamide derivatives (Series 6), the size and type of lipophilic substituents seemed to play an important role. The less hydrophobic tosyl (72), benzenesulfonyl (73), and p-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl (74) derivatives had rather low or no antiinfluenza virus activity and were also not cytotoxic. However, the more lipophilic aryl substituted compounds, such as the biphenylsulfonyl (75) and dansyl (76) derivatives, displayed good activity. Unfortunately, they were also cytotoxic in the MDCK cells. The relationship between alkyl chain length, cytotoxicity and antiviral activity was very clear in case of alkylsulfonates 77e79. The hexanesulfonyl derivative (77) was the best compound showing moderate cytotoxicity and very consistent anti-influenza virus activity. With growing alkyl chain length (78, 79), the activity rapidly increased, but so did the cytotoxicity. Inhibition of influenza HA-and NA-bearing lentiviral pseudoparticles. We previously published the anti-influenza virus mechanism of action of a lipophilic derivative of aglycoristocetin denoted SA-19 [16] . This compound proved to have nice activity in an assay with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing lentiviral pseudoparticles bearing influenza virus HA and NA. This was consistent with other findings that SA-19 interferes with HAmediated endocytosis. We now used the same procedure for two of the most potent teicoplanin pseudoaglycon derivatives (1a, 63). Strong and dose-dependent inhibition was seen with all four control compounds (Fig. 3) , i.e. SA-19; chloroquine (an inhibitor of endosomal acidification); and two aniline-based influenza fusion inhibitors (80, 81, Fig. 2 ) which inhibit the conformational refolding of H1 HA at low endosomal pH [26] . With 63, the inhibition of pseudoparticle entry, as deduced from the reduction in GFP signal, was 92% at 10 mM and 56% at 2 mM. Likewise, 1a produced 54% reduction at 2 mM. Activity against human coronavirus 229E. Given that teicoplanin and related glycopeptides were reported to have anticoronavirus activity [10, 11] , we evaluated a subset of the newly synthesized compounds against human coronavirus 229E, using two complementary methods, i.e. CPE reduction in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblast cells and virus yield reduction in human lung carcinoma A549 cells. Among Series 1, 2 and 3, we tested the analogues carrying alkyl groups of intermediate length, i.e. n-butyl and n-hexyl; for Series 6, the entire series was tested. The antiviral activity values obtained (see Table S6 in Supporting Information) in HEL and A549 cells showed nice agreement. In A549 cells, several compounds produced 2-log 10 (i.e. 100-fold) reduction in coronavirus yield at a concentration of~10 mM, with no or minimal cytotoxicity at 50 mM. The alkanesulfonamide derivatives 77 and 79 displayed potent anti-coronavirus activity in terms of EC 50 (~2 mM) and SI (ratio of MCC to EC 50 : 11 for 77 and 13 for 79). Within the same series, the p-toluenesulfonamide analogue 72 was also nicely active and selective (SI: 19).
