showing that interferon treatment inhibits early viral message translation all agree that this is a significant action mechanism for inhibition of virus replication. Several early studies have shown that early viral RNA synthesis was inhibited in interferon-treated cells (Lockart et al., 1962; DeSomer et al., 1962; Taylor, 1965; Friedman and Sonnabend, 1965b; Gordon et al., 1966; Mecs et al., 1967) and, with a particular virus, some classes of RNA are more susceptible to interferon-induced inhibition than others. In these cases viral RNA replications were dependent on the synthesis of a viral RNA polymerase. Thus, the inhibition of viral RNA synthesis could result from the primary inhibition of viral RNA polymerase synthesis Friedman and Sreevalsan, 1970) . A similar depression of viral polymerase synthesis was found in Semliki Forest virus infection of chick cells Sonnabend et al., 1967) and in Mengovirus infection of L cells (Miner et al., 1966) . Speculation on the mechanism of interferon action based on these findings included that of Levy and Carter (1968) who claimed that, in the case of mengovirus, inhibition resulted from the inability of viral ribosomes to associate with viral mRNA to form functional translational units, whereas Friedman and Sreevalsan (1970) found no such inhibition of polysome formation. In the case of reovirus infection, a strong inhibition of viral protein synthesis was observed with a minimal level of inhibition of viral RNA transcription (Wiebe and Joklik, 1975) . Studies with vaccinia virus infection have indicated that thymidine kinase induction by vaccinia virus was inhibited by interferon treatment in chick cells (Bodo and Jungwirth, 1967; Ghosh and Gifford, 1965; Levine et al., 1967; Ohno and Nozima, 1964) but not in mouse cells (Barban and Baron, 1968) . It was suggested by Magee et al. (1968) that while cell-directed primary uncoating of vaccinia virus proceeds normally, the viral-directed secondary uncoating of virus is inhibited by interferon, and the virus remains in core particles. Even though the vaccinia viral mRNA formed an interferon-treated cells are polyadenylated (Klesel et al., 1974) , they are unable to form stable polysomes (Bodo et al., 1972; Joklik and Merigan, 1966; Metz and Esteban, 1972; Metz et al., 1975) . There is, however, one non-antiviral effect of interferon (double-stranded RNAtoxicity-enhancement, Stewart II et al., 1972a) which complicates the results obtained from the vaccinia virus studies. During vaccinia virus infection, interferon-treated cells are destroyed more rapidly than control, untreated cells (Joklik and Merigan, 1966; Horak et al., 1971; Stewart II et al., 1973a) . This is most likely due to double-stranded RNA synthesized in vaccinia virus-infected cells (Colby and Duesberg, 1969) ; thus, this rapid inhibition of both cellular and viral protein synthesis in interferon-treated cells could be due to polysome breakdown and/or total cell destruction. Another virus studied extensively with respect to interferon action is SV40. It was suggested that the inhibition of SV40 T antigen synthesis in interferon-treated cells (Oxman and Black, 1966) may be due either to uncoating inhibition (Yamamoto et al., 1975) or to transcription inhibition (Oxman and Levin, 1971) . The findings of Graessmann et al. (1974) , showing that SVa0 cRNA microinjected into interferon-treated cells was also inhibited in its translation, strongly suggest that the primary inhibitory action of the interferon mechanism is at the translational level. More recently, Yakobson et al. (1977b) demonstrated that interferon is able to fully induce the antiviral state in monkey cells preinfected with SV4o and actively synthesizing SV40T antigen. By 18-24hr after addition of interferon, both early and late SV40 protein synthesis is completely arrested, even though viral mRNA synthesis continues at an unaltered rate (Yakobson et al., 1977a) . During SV4o infection, host cellular protein synthesis continues unchanged; thus, it is easier to draw the conclusion that interferon treatment inhibits viral mRNA translation in this system than in the vaccinia virus system where total cell destruction takes place. A rather different approach to explain the action of interferon-induced selective inhibition of viral mRNA translation was taken by Levy and Riley (1973) and Riley and Levy (1977) . They proposed that interferon-treated cells are able to differentiate between cellular and viral messages by synthesizing modified mRNA which is larger than normal, and that interferon-treated cells are capable of making the enzymes required to effect these modifications to cellular mRNA. These puzzling data await confirmation.
