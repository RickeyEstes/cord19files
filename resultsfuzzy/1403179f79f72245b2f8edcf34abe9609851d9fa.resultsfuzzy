Veteran Geotechnical Engineer Steven W. Hunt P.E. (MWH, Milwaukee, WI) spoke out in a Geo-Strata letter (July 2003) reiterating the current state of affairs brought about by bid-shopping. He noted: Use of unfocused, thoughtless scopes of works from previous projects; Use of house-standard report formats and contents; Proposals with little/no time for analyses or client communication; Over-reliance on (computer-canned) simple, conservative rule-of-thumb analyses; Firm-standard scopes of work, irrespective of expected site conditions; Failure to conduct ''desk studies'' on existing site or site-area information, and; Lack of effort to become involved in the ''big picture'' of the project goals. Most of our readers are well aware of this malaise, but we need to face this to the degree each of us can develop our own personal concepts of the ethic and sensibility of practice. Mr. Hunt leaves us with the working rule that ''Most commodity-type (bid-shopped) reports do not identify previous subsurface investigations or include boring logs from them. . .If construction problems develop and lawyers for the contractor find out that other data existed, a claim of withholding critical information may be made. . .''. We also subscribe to engineer-defense in malpractice litigation by way of adopting the position of client bid-shopping practices represent the root cause of legal claims. Where possible, owners who indulge in seeking the cheapest geoenvironmental input as possible should be exposed for that practice, before judge and jury in litigation proceedings involving variable site conditions claims. One of the predicted results of bid-shopping has been a withdrawal of ''hands-on'' practitioners of Engineering Geology from participating in meetings, delivering papers, and in publishing their findings and deliberations in general. In the words of Charles Daugherty, a US tunneling geologist of nearly 40 years of experience, this hesitance is due to complicating external factors. Charlie's bullets are: ''Too much contention in the form of disputes, claims, etc., which means the lawyers won't let you publish; Contractor personnel work fast, ungodly hours, and publishing is the last thing they normally have time for, and; Designer personnel have become very bottom line driven. Clients don't want to be billed for their extracurricular activities, and the employer doesn't want the time charged to overhead because it affects the company profits. Moreover, writing on one's own time is often not as easy as it may sound.'' Most geologic work assignments in the ''underground'' are in urban surroundings, requiring significant time-distance travel to and from the office or tunnel site. As Daugherty notes: ''With my working hours and my commuting time, I get about four hours of face time with my wife each work night and writing papers is not a good way to keep the home fires burning. That leaves weekends, with their multiple chores that have to be performed. Mine is a fairly simple case, considering the total three hours and twenty minutes I spend commuting-there are people around here (New York City) who do it four to six hours every day. On top of which, many are constantly traveling and have to spend their plane and hotel time working on official reports and other submittals''. 4.8. Corporate environmental deaths: rest in peace (R.I.P.) After the rash of corporate failures in 2002, there has been a slackening of failures. We have heard, however, that several formerly robust firms have ''gone on sick call'' over symptoms of malnourishment at the hand of bid-shopping utility clients. Among the victims is Phillip Services Corporation (PSC), headquartered at Ottawa, Ontario, but formerly quite successful in the US, after taking over Burlington Resources (a division of Burlington North/Santa Fe and formerly John Mathes and Associates), at Columbia, IL. PSC was quite successful in gas works site and waste characterization work and in oversight of remedial actions. We understand that court-managed bankruptcy is the present status of the firm.
