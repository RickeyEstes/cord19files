The estimated coefficients on the core variables of the gravity model, PGDP, POP, and DIS, are significant and have an expected sign, indicating that a country with a higher per capita GDP and greater population has more tourists visiting Macau, ceteris paribus. This finding reflects the fact that the large and rich countries, for example, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US, are the main outbound tourism countries in the international tourism market. As transportation costs account for a large share of travel expenditure, the coefficient of geographical distance is negative and significant at the 1% statistical level. Transportation costs are 12 As Macau is a special case with the sovereignty transferred from Portugal to China in 1999, a referee suggested us to extend to several years prior to 1999 to consider the impact of transfer on Macau tourism. However, tourism statistics is only available after 1998. 13 Countries other than the 19 countries are integrated as a regional sum; it prevents us to include more countries. For detailed numbers of visitor arrivals by country/region, please refer to the Statistics section of DSEC website: http://www. dsec.gov.mo/Statistic.aspx. It is also shown in Appendix Table. particularly relevant to the international tourism market when the price of petroleum increases. Alternatively, the negative effect of DIS can be interpreted by the fact that many travelers cannot bear long-distance flights and prefer to spend vacations in surrounding countries. The variable of change in exchange rates was found to associate with a significantly negative coefficient in all estimates. This indicates that all other things being equal, an appreciation in the Macau dollar will reduce international tourist arrivals, arising from the important role of exchange rates in determining international spending. The impacts of local characteristics, HOTEL, PO, and CASINO, are summarized below. The estimated coefficients for HOTEL (Model 1) are all significantly positive at the 1% statistical level, suggesting that sufficient accommodation facilities are a prerequisite for providing tourism service. Likewise, the estimates of CASINO (Model 2) are also positive and significant. As discussed previously, the gambling industry is the long-standing famous attraction that lures international tourists to visit Macau. Moreover, along with the deregulation on the license of casinos, more luxurious and multi-recreational functions casinos were established to attract tourists of various age levels. As expected, the crime variable (PO) has a significantly negative impact on tourist arrivals in all FE estimates, supporting the findings in existing literature, for example, Eilat and Einav (2004) and Naude and Saayman (2005) . Furthermore, as expected, the unanticipated outbreak of the SARS epidemic in 2003 had a significantly negative effect on tourist arrivals. More importantly, do the empirical results support the tourism-enhancing effect of the WHL? Various estimates show that, while the estimated coefficients on the WHL variable are positive, not all of them are statistically significant. This finding is consistent with Cellini (2011) and within the estimates in Yang et al. (2010) . That is, contrary to common belief, being included on the WHL is not a primary driver of international tourism. One point worth mentioning is that the coefficient of the WHL dummy can only be explained as the average treatment effect between pre-and post-WHL inclusion periods for all sample countries. In other words, the coefficient of the WHL dummy cannot provide more insightful implications such as year effects or country-specific effects. Table 3 reports the results of estimating Equation (2), where the WHL variable is replaced by a series of year dummies.
