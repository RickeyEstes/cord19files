Young female cotton rats that were immunized twice i.m. with live HRV16 (10 6 PFUs) were bred to unimmunized males. Newborn pups delivered from immunized or non-immunized females (the gestation time for S. hispidus is 4 weeks) were challenged at 3-5 days of age with HRV16 i.n. and euthanized at 10, 24, and 48 h p.i. Pups from non-immunized mothers showed lung HRV16 titers consistent with those of naïve adult cotton rats challenged with HRV16 (Fig. 5A) . Pups from immunized mothers showed a statistically significant reduction in infectious virus titers (>3 log 10 ) and also a significant reduction in the viral load measured as copies of HRV16 (À)vRNA (Fig. 5B) . Neutralizing antibody titers in the pups correlated with the level of lung protection. Fully protected pups (all animals euthanized at 10 h, Fig. 5 ) showed neutralization titers >8192, whereas pups euthanized at 24 or 48 h post infection harboring low but detectable virus titers showed neutralizing antibody titers of $256, suggesting a correlation of protection and serum neutralizing antibody titers as seen in the adults. These data indicate that maternal immunity conferred by immunization is transferable to newborn pups and sufficient for protection of offspring from viral infection and possible replication in the lung.
