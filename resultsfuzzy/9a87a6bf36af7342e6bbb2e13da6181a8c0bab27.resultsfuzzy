As shown in Figure 1A , mRNA level of zbTRIM25 was downregulated within 24 h after RGNNV infection. Meanwhile, we also investigated the expression of zbTRIM25 in RGNNVinfected zebrafish embryos at 24 h, and the results were concordant with ZBE3 cells (Figure 1B) . These data indicated a potential role of zbTRIM25 in innate immune response to RGNNV infection.
