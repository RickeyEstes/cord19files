CGAP collected 284 complete chloroplast genomes from NCBI Organelle Genome Resources (http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/genomes). According to the annotation information stored in the GenBank format file, CGAP extracted all types of genome features including Gene, CDS, tRNA, rRNA, Exon, Intron, Promoter, RepeatRegion, StemLoop, -10 Signal and -35 Signal. Complete chloroplast genomes and all genome features were stored in CGAP chloroplast database. You can view and download all genomes and features in Fasta format online.
