The methodology and definition used here yielded 782 instances of relevance markers, or approximately seven instances per 10,000 words. 3 However, this average conceals considerable variation as about half the lectures contain fewer than four instances and about a sixth contain ten or more. Although it would be interesting to explore this and other idiolectic and disciplinary variation, this is beyond the scope of this article. An inspection of the concordances uncovered similarities in the elements and structure of relevance markers that could be represented as patterns (Hunston & Francis, 2000) . Depending on their main element, or 'focus' (Hunston & Francis, 1998, p. 49) , relevance markers were classified with a particular adjective, noun, verb, or adverb pattern. To keep the overview transparent and practitioner-friendly, we have adopted a fairly generalizing approach to this classification. Postmodification (e.g., about that) and ellipsis (of the link verb or determiner) are not specified in the pattern, so that (4) is classified as MN v-link (a metalinguistic noun with the link verb is). (4) and the point about that it holds for all sets A (pslct025) Instances with embedding have also been simplified so that (5) and (6) are respectively viewed as variants of 2 pers pron V n (second person pronoun, verb, nominal complementation) and there v-link adj MN (there, link verb, adjective, metalinguistic noun). (5) it's the only number you need to remember (lslct033) (6) there's something very important to note about this (pslct010) The category 'assessment-related expressions' (cf. Section 4.5) contains the few instances which did not fit these patterns. As can be seen in Table 1 , verb patterns are overwhelmingly the most frequent relevance markers, followed by noun patterns. This predominance is largely due to the prevalence of V clause (verb with clausal complementation) (7) and MN v-link (8). (7) remember slavery had already been legally abolished (ahlct008) (8) the point is that people can't do that (sslct028) The main words in adjective, noun, verb and adverb patterns are respectively important, point, remember and importantly (see Appendix for a full list of focus elements). Relevance markers further vary in their textual and interactive orientation (see Table 2 ). Interestingly (and reassuringly), most highlight following points. Such prospective marking is likely to benefit online processing and note-taking and also reflects the (semi-) planned nature of lectures. Typically, the highlighted statement is included in the clause containing the relevance marker (9); alternatively, it is encapsulated by a deictic and subsequently stated in full (10). (9) note that in Spenser the weather is always there (ahlct010) (10) the point is this in in many member states in the European Communities as they then were accounting regulation is entirely by law (sslct007) Retrospective relevance markers are considerably less common and are chiefly restricted to patterns containing a deictic with anaphoric reference. (11) he was very largely influenced by his religious upbringing and that's important to know (ahlct024) In a few cases, a restatement of the highlighted discourse follows retrospective relevance marking. An especially strong highlighting effect is created when an immediately preceding point is restated. (12) such action as it deems necessary now this is an essential point such action as it deems necessary (sslct019) In this regard, it is also noteworthy that relevance markers often co-occur with discourse markers (mainly and, but, now, and so) (cf. (12)). To some extent this reflects the position of many relevance markers at transition points but some discourse markers may also have an attention-focusing effect (cf. Brinton, 1996) . Interactively, relevance markers are orientated towards the listeners, the speaker, the listeners and speaker jointly, or the content. About half are listener-orientated, including pronouns referring to the listener and/or verbs denoting listener actions (13). Speaker-orientated markers refer to the speaker and/or contain verbs denoting speaker actions (14). Some patterns combine both listener-and speaker-orientation (15). Content-orientated relevance markers contain no such references or verbs (16). (13) so you have to remember this part is permeable to water (lslct029) (14) i ought to stress that i'm talking about vectors here (pslct031) (15) so we're interested in the gradient here (pslct030) (16) that's an important point (sslct003) These differences in textual and interactive orientation also affect the clarity and possibly effectiveness of relevance marking: for instance, prospective, listener-orientated marking (13) often seems the clearest. Clarity may also vary with explicitness. For example, instances with relevance adjectives (16) mark relevance explicitly, while those which are multifunctional (e.g., the thing is) or contain polysemous lexemes (e.g., note) are arguably harder to recognize as signaling relevance and seem more ''muted signals'' (Swales & Burke, 2003, p. 17) .
