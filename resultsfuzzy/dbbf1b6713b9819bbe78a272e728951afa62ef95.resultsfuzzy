Developer C extracted influenza A RNA from all spiked samples with sensitivity of 100%. Developer E extracted most influenza A RNAs, but not all RT-PCR tests were positive when using low sample extracts (e.g. SP1), with a further three false positive replicates reported from one extract (SP3) indicating potential cross contamination. Analyses of the Influenza A RNA produced by Developer E's extraction technology showed an overall sensitivity of 86% for Influenza A RNA. Influenza A RNA from the medium (SP10) and high (SP4 and SP7) spiked samples was produced at detectable levels by two developers (A and F), but the low-level sample (SP1) was scored as negative with these technologies. Developers B and D did not produce Influenza A RNA in any SP extracts, even those with high-spike levels. When specificity was considered, most developers scored 100%, with the exception of developer E scoring 93%. Overall, developer C had the highest concordance with the predicate methods for influenza A RNA extraction from sputum, namely Qiagen manual extraction (PATH) or the MagNaPure (CDC). Better overall extraction performance was observed with MTB (Table 2) . Developer A correctly extracted MTB DNA from all spiked samples, whereas developers C and E managed to produce MTB DNA from most MTB spiked samples, though not as consistently from three replicates from the MTB low-level spiked samples (SP5 and SP7). Developers B and D were only able to extract detectable MTB DNA from the samples with the highest-spiked levels (SP1 and SP3). Of note are the MTB DNA extracts from developer A where the C t values generated from testing were generally lower than the MagNaPure (CDC) and manual (PATH) data sets ( Table 2 ), indicating that for MTB, the developer A extraction method was more efficient than the PATH or CDC reference methods. Analyses of the extracts from developer A achieved a sensitivity of 100%, whereas extracts from developers B, D, E and F demonstrated significantly lower sensitivities. The extracts from most technologies scored well with regards to specificity, with developers B, C, E and F achieving 100%, however developer A scored least well of the six groups with their extracts generating a specificity of 86%, possibly due to cross contamination affecting the MTB-negative sample, SP4 (Table 2) . Overall, for MTB DNA extraction in sputum, developer A had concordance to the reference methods amongst the six technologies, but developer C also scored well. For the sputum panel overall, developer C demonstrated the highest concordance to the reference methods when considering the simultaneous extraction of both DNA and RNA targets. The extracts from developers A, B, E and F all contained detectable amounts of MS2 RNA across the spiking range from high to low (Tables 1 and 2 ). However, only extracts from developer A had 100% agreement for all replicates compared to the MagNaPure (CDC) and Qiagen (PATH) reference data. With MS2, developer A extracts gave consistently lower C t values than the reference data indicating the most effective purification overall. Extracts from developer F correctly corresponded to the positive samples, but an extract from a negative sample, BL9, gave a false positive RT-PCR result, presumably because of a cross contamination event. Developer E detected some low-spiked sample replicates (BL1 and BL6) but correctly detected all replicates from the higher-spiked panel members (BL4, BL7, and BL10). RT-PCR on the extracts from developer B correctly identified the majority of replicates spiked with MS2, but surprisingly, many of the unspiked sample extracts also scored RT-PCR positive (Table 2) , resulting in poor specificity for this panel. Upon investigation it was discovered that developer B routinely used MS2 in other development work in their laboratory, so it is possible that reagents were contaminated with MS2 phage or MS2-related amplicons. Samples from developers C and D were non-reactive for 3/6 and 4/6, respectively, of the 6 MS2-spiked samples, resulting in poor sensitivity. The observed specificity for developers A, C, D and E was 100% with developer F closely following at 98%. Overall, developer A ranked highest with the MS2 challenge in whole blood with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Developer F followed with an observed sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 98%, respectively. Developer E has slightly lower sensitivity of 87% with a specificity of 100%. The MagNaPure extracts gave the lowest C t values across the panel range with S. pneumoniae DNA extraction from whole blood. Many of the developer's technologies demonstrated good performance with all spiking ranges correctly generating RT-PCR positive results (Table 2) . However, only the extracts from developer A were consistently RT-PCR positive with all spiked replicates, resulting in a sensitivity of 100%. The replicate extracts from the low-spiked samples (BL5 and/or BL7) as prepared by developers C, D, E, and F generated variable RT-PCR results with developers E and F showing higher sensitivities at 96% and 98%, respectively. All technologies achieved �90% specificity, with developers A, B, C, D and E scoring 100%. Factoring in both MS2 RNA and S. pneumoniae DNA extractions from whole blood, developer A scored best overall with similar C t values to the reference assays used by the CDC and PATH. The MS2 RNA extractions from stool panel were the only test panel where no developer achieved 100% sensitivity, as not all replicate extracts derived from the low-spiked samples (ST1 and ST6) gave positive RT-PCR results ( Table 2 ). The MagNaPure assay also performed poorly as compared to the Qiagen method employed at PATH. The extracts from developers A and F scored highest sensitivity with 84% and 80%, respectively. In terms of specificity, developer B extracts again appeared to be confounded by potential MS2 contamination, but to a lesser degree than observed with the blood panel. The extracts from other developers demonstrated 100% specificity. Overall, developer A had the greatest concordance for extracting MS2 RNA as compared to the six technologies, with developer F being a close second. All of the positive samples had C t s �4.8 higher than the corresponding PATH data, indicating that the extraction and/or the co-purification of confounders had significant negative effects on generating a test result. For S. Typhimurium, developer A was the only technology whose NA extracts were detected with 100% sensitivity. Interestingly, the sensitivities scored for extracts from the other developers were all relatively low compared to the other microbe panels, with developer D as the next best at 64%. All technologies scored 100% for specificity. With the stool panel, developer A had significant concordance with the data derived from the different extraction methods used at PATH and CDC than compared to any of competitors in terms of both RNA and DNA extraction followed by developer F.
