In fall 2014, student evaluations (N Â¼ 74) were conducted. Using Stata version 13 (StataCorp, 2013), responses were analyzed to determine mean scores and frequencies of each response for each of the eight learning objectives. Students reported substantial increases in skills and expertise for most learning objectives (Figure 2 ). For learning objectives four and five, >80% of students indicated that their skills and expertise had increased a lot or to a great extent. The poorest performing learning objective was, ''Develop preventive plans at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels,'' with fewer than 50% feeling that their skills had increased in this area. This result led us to critically review the simulation content focused on preventive plans, and we determined that this topic was not explicitly addressed in any of the assignments, providing an implicit validation of student feedback. Students also assessed their group effort on five dimensions (engagement, contribution, staying on task, ''It was interesting to be able to think in the shoes of a public health nurse and made lecture concepts more realistic and easy to understand.'' ''Great benefit derived from acting in role of public health officials investigating outbreaks and completing associated tasks-> think[ing] about how to respond in leadership position'' Achievement of learning objectives ''Creating the interview questions and having the role-playing make interview was really helpful. I learned more about what to look for and how specific questions need to be.'' ''I learned how to create and analyze an epidemic curve-that was cool!'' ''Helpful to learn how to calculate the statistics in a real-world scenario rather that in a lecture or homework assignment'' ''There has to be a lot of critical thinking involveddyou cannot consider just one patient and their disease. You have to think about who they exposed, what kind of symptoms they have how are they affecting other people. Containment and treatment measures affect everyone.'' Pace and schedule ''This was great but way too long. Hard to stay engaged.'' ''Shorter! But the simulation was very helpful'' ''I liked the simulation overall but it was way longer than necessary (in my opinion!). I think it could have been done in w4 hours rather than 6 (some of the tasks were repetitive, things we covered a lot already in class)'' Group work ''It was sometimes hard to formulate answers to questions with the input of so many people'' ''Group worked well together but it was stressful when faculty came to observe knowing that part of our grade was based on that brief interaction i.e. one group member was quiet then even though they were an important contributor to the group'' ''My team rocks! Everyone contributes based on their own strengths (technology, creativity, communication etc.)'' ''Having a large group was really helpful for not only breaking up tasks but also for bringing new ideas into our deliverables. I think this kind of simulation definitely functions best within teams.'' Surprises ''The impact nurses have in spreading disease in a healthcare setting.'' ''How difficult it was to determine all of the potential ways to control and spread the disease and how to address it publicly'' ''I was surprised by how difficult it was to come up with interview questions.'' social interaction, communication), and 93% of the students rated the team effort as either very good or outstanding. The open-ended responses were reviewed several times, and frequencies of the most common comments were calculated. The comments were then organized into themes (see Table 4 for key themes and representative quotes). Based on responses to open-ended questions, students were engaged and interested in the simulation and learned about the key challenges of outbreak investigation. Some students felt pressured by the time constraints, and although most were satisfied with the working as a team, others felt that group members did not appear to contribute equally to the assignments. This feedback led to the addition of a peer assessment component to the simulation grade beginning in summer 2015.
