Because the prevalence of Helicobacter infections in laboratory mice is uncertain, we investigated a sample of laboratory mice in the specific-pathogen free tract of our animal facility on Helicobacteraceae. METHODS: From 50 laboratory mice harboured in the central animal laboratory of our university feces was collected and analysed for Helicobacteraceae using a group-specific PCR. DNA-sequencing and subsequent sequence analysis were performed to identify the individual Helicobacter species. In double infected mice species identification was completed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: In 28 (56%) of the 50 tested laboratory mice the PCR assay produced a strong amplification product indicating Helicobacter infection. Nine mice (18%) were PCR-negative. In the remaining 13 mice (26%) the PCR assay produced a marginal result. Therefore, these samples were not further analyzed. In 25 out of the 28 Heficobacter-positive mice the 16S rRNA sequence obtained by DNA-sequencing of the amplification product could clearly be assigned to known Helicobacter species: H. ganmani (n= 14) , H. sp. "ulmiensis" (n=6), H. hepaticas (n=3) , and H. sp. "hamster B" (n=2). In 3 mice DNA-sequencing indicated an infection of the animals with more than one Heficobacter species. In these mice co-infection with H. ganmani and H. hepaticus was diagnosed by restriction fragment polymorphism analysis. CONCLUSION: Although the mice were reared under SPF conditions and some of the mice had been delivered as Helicobacter free, in the investigated mice Helicobacter infections were frequently detected. This is of importance because Helicobacter infections have to be considered as undesirable and incalculable variables, which may have impact on the reproducibility of animal experiments especially in the field of hepatology and gastroenterology. Communication between neurites and mast cells is a prototypic example of neuro-immune interaction. We previously reported a close apposition between mucosal mast cells (MMCs) and a dense network of calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP)-IR extrinsic primary afferent nerve fibres in the lamina propria of S. mansoni-infected murine ileum (1). These CGRP-IR fibres originate from dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Using optical recordings of intracellular calcium (Ca2 + )i we examined the bidirectional interaction between primary cultured MMCs and DRG neurons in vitro. The degranulatory EC50 for the mast cell degranulator C48/80 (10/.~g/ml) and the neuropeptides CGRP (2.10-8 M) and SP (3.10-8 M) were determined by measurement of extracellular mMCP-1. Application of the mast cell degranulator C48/ 80 (10p, g/ml) to fluo-4 loaded (I~M, 40rain, 20Â°C) MMCs induced a transient rise in (Ca2+)i in 56_ + 1% (mean _+ SD; 3 cultures) of the 260 cells studied, with a lag time of 47-+21s and an amplitude of 7-+2 RE (Relative Fluorescence; baseline RF= 1). A smaller (P~0.01) percentage of MMCs was activated by 10-7M CGRP (15-+6%; 3 cultures; 599 cells) and 10-7M SP (12 -+ 3%; 2 cultures; 547 cells). The lag time of the response to CGRP (33 _+ 26s) and SP (21 -16s) was shorter (P~0.001) than that to C48/80. The CGRP response could be completely blocked (to 1 _+ 2% of control; 5 cultures) by pertussis toxin (2p.g/ml; 3h), indicating involvement of G-proteins. Application of 'MMC juice' (obtained by C48/ 80 degranulation) to fluo-4 loaded DRG neurons (5 cultures) induced a rise in (Ca2 +)i, with a lag time of 5 _+ 2s and an amplitude of 2 _+ 0.4 RF. We also showed that degranulation of MMCs by C48/80 in culture dishes containing DRG neurons, caused a comparable activation (1.7-+0.4 RF) of DRG neurons, but with a much longer lag time (25_+ 10s, P<0.001; 2 cultures). In conclusion, these results demonstrate that a bidirectional crosstalk between cultured MMCs and DRG neurons in vitro, indicating a functional relevance for the close apposition of MMCs and CGRP-IR nerve fibres in vivo.
