Interpretation of the results of immunohistochemical stains is the province of the surgical pathologist and is best accom plished by pathologists who have the appropriate level of experience not only in the morphologic aspects of diagnosis but also with regard to immunohistochemical findings. As in any other area of pathology, experience matters: A pathol ogist with little experience with immunohistochemistry, who runs a few different tests each week or month, will obtain very different results from a pathologist who per forms and interprets immunohistochemical tests on a daily basis. As the impact of immunohistochemistry on surgical pathology increases, these differences will become more profound. As described previously, many factors influence the results. All these factors must be considered by the pathol ogist in interpreting the findings. Negative, weak, or unin terpretable results should lead to a repetition of the test after the use of antigen retrieval. 11, 12 One measure of antigen preservation is to test for expression of the intermediate filament vimentin, a fixationsensitive protein that is typi cally expressed by vascular or connective components; this technique often serves as an internal indicator of the con servation or loss of antigenicity. 11 Test results may also be affected by technical artifacts and by the nature of the tissue under study. For instance, if tumor cells are crushed, false positive or nonspecific staining may be encountered. Non viable areas of tissue from a necrotic tumor may also be a source of falsepositive results, attributable in part to leakage of serum proteins (e.g., immunoglobulins). The subcellular distribution of immunoreactivity is critical to the interpreta tion of immunohistochemical results. For example, Her 2/neu shows membranous staining, whereas antibodies to estrogen and progesterone receptors produce nuclear stain ing. When unexpected staining patterns are observed with an antibody, the results should be discounted. 1 To interpret the results effectively, the pathologist must have extensive knowledge of the staining patterns of the primary antibod ies under consideration, including a detailed knowledge of tissue specificity and subcellular localization of the antigen, and an awareness of technical variables. Each lab oratory performing immunohistochemical staining should have established written criteria for determining and report ing positive and negative findings for each immunohisto chemical stain, with particular reference to stains that are expected to produce cell surface membrane, cytoplasmic nuclear, or extracellular staining. Although it seems obvious, it often is overlooked that staining should be recorded as positive only if it occurs in the expected cellular or tissue location.
