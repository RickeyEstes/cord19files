Approximately 65% of PLT products met the guard bands during the operational trial. Presplitting largely obviated the need for conducting volume reduction. The number of PR units currently labeled is less than 50% due to combination of demand, staffing, aggregates, and units exceeding 24 hours. Additional observations included a radical shift in type of PI kit used from predominantly dual-storage kits to small-volume kits; the use of large-volume kits remained the same. Before implementation of mitigations, the split rate of PI products fell to 1.30. After implementation of mitigations the split rate of PI products increased to 2.10. Programming of Amicus devices was standardized, and collection volume increased; triples became eligible and products were not downgraded. The labor required for PRT is greater than using the BacT/ALERT system with a single bottle. Time studies compared both processes. Demonstrated an 11.1% increase in the time required to complete tasks for unmitigated PI products as compared to the traditional process. There was a 22% increase in time required to complete tasks for mitigated PI products compared to traditional process. Productivity for the unmitigated PI process was poor because the volume of products eligible for treatment was low with batch sizes of two to four products. Productivity improved 52% after implementation of mitigation steps due to significant increase in products eligible for treatment with Increased batch sizes of eight to 12 products.
