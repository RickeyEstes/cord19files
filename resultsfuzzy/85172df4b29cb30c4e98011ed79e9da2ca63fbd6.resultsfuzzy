Hamster cDNA sequence assembly, characterization, and annotation As noted above there are a number of experimental infection models in Syrian hamsters that are relevant to human disease [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . However, there is limited availability of molecular tools for studies of disease pathogenesis in this model. A draft genome of Mesocricetus auratus determined via genome shotgun sequencing has been reported (NCBI Accession APMT01000001), but it was incompletely annotated at the time when the data presented here were being analyzed. As an initial approach to address this obstacle we sequenced a Syrian hamster cDNA library constructed from a pool of mRNA that had been isolated from 1) spleen, LN cells, and peritoneal macrophages exposed to various stimuli, and 2) normal tissue or tissue harvested from hamsters infected in vivo with several different pathogens. We chose to use cells and tissues that had been exposed to a broad range of stimuli and pathogens (bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminths) in order to enrich for a diverse set of mRNAs involved in immune responses. From the cDNA library 10,000 independent clones were sequenced to obtain 5085 unique expressed sequence tags (EST). Datasets representing all sequences were assembled into contigs of overlapping sequences using Phred (for accurate base-calling from DNA sequence traces) and Phrap (for fast and accurate DNA sequence assembly), and were compared to the non-redundant nucleotide database using the BLAST algorithm [23] . Sequences that had a significant match with a mouse, rat, or human sequence were considered Syrian hamster orthologs of the closest match. The breakdown of closest match by non-hamster species is shown in Additional file 1: Table S1 . Hamster cDNAs had the highest level of homology with mouse (49.6%) and rat (27.7%) sequences; 12.9% did not have a significant match to the GenBank database. Only 4.5% of sequences showed the highest homology to human or non-human primate DNA and 3.7% of sequences matched to non-mammalian species and were likely of pathogen origin since RNA from the protozoa, helminthes, or viruses in the infected tissue would have been included in the RNA used to construct the library (see Additional file 1: Table S1 ).
