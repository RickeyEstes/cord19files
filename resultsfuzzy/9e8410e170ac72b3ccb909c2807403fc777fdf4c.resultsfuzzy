Network statistics varied across the pathogen taxa studied, as illustrated in table 1. Viruses (all, DNA and RNA) and helminth networks were less dense than bacteria and protozoa networks (electronic supplementary material, figure S1 ). The protozoa network exhibited the highest level of transitivity, indicating higher probability that if two host species shared protozoan pathogens, their neighbours were also connected. Network-level order E-I index revealed that hosts of helminth and DNA viruses (and to lesser extent all viruses royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rspb Proc. R. Soc. B 287: 20192882 and RNA viruses) tended to share pathogens in these taxa with members of their orders (table 1).
