Microarrays are powerful tools for examining the expression of thousands of mRNAs, but two potential sources of error exist. First, as microarrays rely on hybridization, accurate measurement is possible only when each feature on the microarray is in great excess over the amount of mRNA in the test sample. Second, crosshybridization, especially in spotted cDNA microarrays, can be another source of error. Therefore, confirmation of the results of gene expression levels is frequently required. One common method is using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR). Conventional PCR is not quantitative, because the end product is observed only after the bulk of the product has been synthesized. When the rate of synthesis of new molecules has reached a plateau, small differences in the amount of target at the start of the reaction are masked. Real-time measurement of fluorescent product accumulation provides the number of cycles required to attain the linear phase of increase in product biosynthesis [42] . With each cycle, the fluorescence intensity reflects the number of molecules of double-stranded DNA that have been synthesized. The end point of RT-QPCR analysis is the threshold cycle or C T . The C T is determined from a log-linear plot of the PCR signal versus the cycle number. The two most commonly used methods of analyzing data from RT-QPCR experiments are absolute quantification and relative quantification. Absolute quantification determines the input copy number, usually by relating the PCR signal to a standard curve [42] . Relative quantification measures the PCR signal of the target transcript in a treatment group and compares it to that of another sample (usually an untreated control). The method is convenient in analyzing the relative changes in gene expression from RT-QPCR experiments [42] . In the demonstration by Livak and Schmittgen [42] , the efficiency of the amplification of the target gene (c-myc) and the internal control (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH]) was examined using RT-QPCR and TaqMan detection. Using reverse transcriptase, cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg of total RNA isolated from human Raji cells. Serial dilutions of cDNA were amplified in a real-time PCR using gene-specific primers. The sample contained cDNA derived from 1 ng of total RNA. The ⌬C T (C T c-myc -C T GAPDH) was calculated for each cDNA dilution. If the absolute value of the slope is close to zero, the efficiencies of the target and reference genes are similar, and the ⌬⌬C T calculation or the relative quantification of target may be used. Important steps in the design and evaluation of a RT-QPCR experiment are: (1) to select an internal control gene, (2) to validate the internal control to determine that it is not affected by experimental treatment, and (3) to perform a PCR on serial dilutions of RNA or cDNA for both the target and internal control genes to ensure that the efficiencies are similar. Finally, statistical data should be converted to the linear form and should not be presented as raw C T values. The purpose of the internal control gene is to normalize the PCRs for the amount of RNA added to the reverse transcription reactions. Standard housekeeping genes usually suffice as internal control genes. Suitable internal controls for RT-QPCR include GAPDH, β-actin, β 2 -microglobulin, and rRNA.
