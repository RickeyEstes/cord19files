When the project is completed, the Project Status bar changes to that shown in the bottom of Figure 3 . By clicking on the "See Result" button one is led to the Result Page. The Result Page almost entirely consists of a long table summarizing taxa convergence except for two buttons in the upper-right corner: "See Tree" and "Download Result". "See Tree" is the portal to the interactive tree display to be described in Section 2.4. "Download Result" is where the user can download the results to the local computer for further analysis and archiving. It may be used any time while on-line or after reloading a project.
