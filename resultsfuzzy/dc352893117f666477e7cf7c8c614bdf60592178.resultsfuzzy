Here, we have investigated the feasibility of using mineral-oilspread agar plate in enhancing the bioaerosol sampling by Andersen type samplers. In our experiments, we have observed that use of mineral-oil-spread agar plates substantially improved the biological collection efficiencies of Andersen type samplers for both environmental bioaerosols and aerosolized ones (p-values are shown in Table 1 ). Figure 1 shows the indoor bacterial aerosol sampling for 10 min using the Andersen six-stage sampler in conjunction with mineral-oil-spread and regular agar plates. As observed from the figure, regardless of the particle size ranges mineral-oil-spread agar plates were shown to substantially enhance the bacterial aerosol collection efficiencies of the Andersen sixstage sampler from 36% increase for the 6 th stage to 71% for the 3 rd stage (p-values,0.05 shown in Table 1 ). When sampling bacterial aerosols outdoors using the Andersen six-stage sampler, similar results were obtained as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). Different from indoor bacterial aerosol sampling, the protective effect was found more pronounced for the stage 4 of the sampler, about 97% enhancement. This difference is likely due to the difference in particle size distribution and bacterial aerosol compositions in different environments. In general, the observed enhancements varied with stages of the Andersen six-stage sampler, which could be attributed to the differences in several factors: impaction stress, particle size, species composition and environments. The mineral oil film plated was about 180 mm thick, therefore the bioaerosol particles can be embedded into the layer, thus lowering the desiccation effects. Due to the non-evaporating attributes of mineral oil, the agar surface is also protected from the desiccation, accordingly reducing the particle bounce. In addition, the mineral oil layer is softer than the agar surface, thus reducing the relevant impaction stress. Despite the sampling desiccation stress, i.e., amount of air impacted on agar surface per unit area per unit time [23] , remained similar for the stages of the Andersen sampler operated at 28.3 L/min, each stage has a different impaction velocity: 24 (6 th stage), 12.8 (5 th stage), 5.3 (4 th stage), 3.0 (3 rd stage), 1.8 (2 nd stage) and 1.1 (1 st stage) m/s, thus presenting different impaction stress. Larger bacterial particles tend to sustain higher impaction stress compared to smaller ones given similar impaction velocity. Accordingly, different stages of the Andersen sampler impart different impaction stress on the bioaerosol particles. Thus, use of mineral oil can have a greater protective effect for larger particles from the impaction stress than smaller ones. For different stages of the sampler, different size particles were collected because of their different cutoff sizes, thus the species collected onto different stages might be also different. Different species respond to the sampling stress differently. However, in natural environments bacterial particles could appear in aggregates or harbor on larger non-biological particles such that they could be collected onto upper stages of the sampler. This possibility could make differentiating the aggregates from their single cells difficult with respect to the recovery. Besides, different environments could also have different microbial species compositions. In addition, particles collected onto each stage of the Andersen six-stage sampler have stayed in the sampling line for different amount of time, and due to the particle bounce certain particles might have been impacted more than once too. Given all these influencing factors, the enhancement trend for different stages of the Andersen six-stage sampler by the mineral-oil-spread agar plate is rather difficult to predict. To investigate the effects of sampling time on the performances of mineral-oil-spread agar plates, we used the BioStage impactor to sample environmental bacterial aerosols, aerosolized B. subtilis and E. coli for 5, 10 and 20 min. The relevant results are shown in Figures 2, 3 , and 4, S2 (Supporting Information). As observed in Figure 2 , increasing sampling time resulted in increased enhancements from about 26% at 10 min to about 50% at 20 min (pvalues = 0.007, 0.009) except for 5 min when mineral-oil-spread agar plates are used for sampling indoor bacterial aerosols. Unexpectedly, higher bacterial aerosol concentration was observed for 20 min as shown in Figure 2 , which was likely due to the sudden environmental bioaerosol fluctuations. Similar results were obtained when the BioSatge impactor was used to collect outdoor bacterial aerosols under different sampling times (5, 10 and 20 min) as shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). Different from indoor sampling, all sampling times for outdoors were found to result in a statistical difference between mineral oil and agar plates (p-values,0.05 shown in Table 1 ). Compared to indoor bacterial aerosols sampling, more enhancements were observed for outdoor bacterial aerosol sampling, especially for 20 min sampling, about 2 times protection effects obtained for outdoor bacterial aerosols by use of mineral oil. This might be due to species compositions and their different sensitivity to the sampling stress in different environments. In different environments, Grampositive (G+) and Gram-negative (G-) bacteria might account for different percentages, and they could respond to the sampling stress differently. Accordingly, different enhancements are expected by use of the mineral oil. In addition, the observed differences between indoors and outdoors might be also attributed to their different humidity levels: 46% for indoors and 36% for outdoors. When sampling aerosolized B. subtilis and E. coli under different sampling times, similar results were observed as shown in Figures 3  and 4 . Regardless of the sampling time, use of mineral-oil-spread agar plates was shown to substantially enhance the recovery rates of both species compared to the regular ones without the mineral oil plated (p-values,0.05 shown in Table 1 ). In general, for B. subtilis aerosols increasing sampling time was observed to lead to a decrease of aerosolized culturable bacterial aerosol counts collected by the regular agar plate due to the prolonged sampling desiccation; however for mineral-oil-spread agar plates increasing sampling time resulted in an increased recovery rate of bioaerosols, e.g., from 47% increase at 5 min to 60% at 20 min. This on the other hand indicates that the sampling stress causes a large number of bacteria cells to become non-culturable, while use of mineral oil can effectively minimize such side effects. Similar to B. subtilis, increasing sampling time resulted in increased recovery rates for E. coli aerosols, e.g., from 64% increase at 5 min to 107% at 20 min, when mineral-oil-spread agar plates used. In general, higher enhancement rates were observed for E. coli than B. subtilis at all sampling times by mineral-oil-spread agar plates. E. coli is a Gram-negative bacteria, more sensitive to environmental stress compared to Gram-positive B. subtilis, accordingly use of mineral oil had more protective effects on E. coli. In general, increasing sampling time also led to the decrease of culturable E. coli and B. subtilis counts given only mineral-oil-spread agar plates used. For environmental bioaerosols, the enhancement was found relatively lower (not statistically significant) for 5 min sampling time, which was possibly due to less particle bounce and desiccation. In contrast, for freshly aerosolized bacterial aerosols the enhancement was also found statistically significant more than 40% Figure 1 .

Statistical analysis of performances of mineral-oil-spread agar together with Andersen six-stage sampler and BioStage impactor for sampling bioaerosols. increase for the same sampling time. The difference might be due to the initial viability of the bioaerosols being sampled, i.e., high viability for freshly aerosolized bioaerosols and low viability for environmental ones. Continuous sampling desiccation could also cause the agar to be desiccated, thus exposing those bioaerosols already collected, while mineral oil would not desiccate and evaporate [21] . The sampling desiccation for bioaerosols has been observed in many studies [18] [19] [20] 23, 24] . One study also indicated that the decreases in bioaerosol recovery by several portable microbial samplers were attributed to the desiccation of the agar plate (causing particle bounce) and those already collected bioaerosol particles [20] . Use of mineral oil can minimize the relevant desiccation problems due to its non-evaporating attributes. Previously, we have demonstrated that portable BioStage impactor reported higher culturable bacteria and fungal concentrations under 5 min sampling than the RCS High Flow due to the higher desiccation effects of the RCS High Flow sampler, about 8 times higher than the BioStage impactor [23] . In our recent study, we have shown that use of mineral-oil-filled agar strip resulted in about 4-12 times higher culturable bacterial aerosol concentration compared to the use of agar strips with RCS High Flow sampler [22] . Use of the mineraloil-spread agar platewith the Andersen type sampler significantly reduced the sampling stress and particle bounce regardless of the species and environments.
