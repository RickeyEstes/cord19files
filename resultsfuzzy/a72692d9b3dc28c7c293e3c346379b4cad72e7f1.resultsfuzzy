The ability to produce IL-2 in response to mitogen stimulation was assessed in whole blood cultures (Fig. 5 ) and in cultures of purified PBMC (results not shown). Clear suppressive effects of the ACTH treatment were seen, but only in whole blood cultures, and only with the mitogens PHA and Con A. In contrast, no inhibitory effects were noted in the cultures of purified PBMC.  


Section:less clear cut results were obtained when the mitogen-induced proliferation was assessed in cultures of purified pbmc. repeated significant differences between groups a and c were only recorded at days 32 and 35 for the pha-and con a-induced proliferation and between groups b and c at days 32 and 35 for the pha-induced proliferation.
