5.1. The effects of regional integration on energy and CO 2 emissions performance In this section, we revisit the effects of regional integration on energy and CO 2 emissions performance. Fig. 6 depicts the positive cross-province relationship in the two measures of regional integration (indicators including all provinces and only including adjacent provinces) against two measures of energy and CO 2 emissions performance (UEI and ECPI). It implies that provinces with higher degree of regional integration, regardless of dminteginter or dmintegintra, are inclined to perform more efficiently in energy use and CO 2 emissions. Energy and CO 2 emissions performance is defined to be censored between 0 and 1 in econometric sense. The widely used OLS or panel model might therefore be biased. Thus, we apply Tobit model to estimate Eq. (12). Hausman test is necessary for model selection because when unobserved individual factors are not correlated with the regressors, random effect model is not only consistent but also more efficient. A summary result of Hausman test are reported in Table 3 . The test statistic follows a chi-square distribution with a degree of freedom of 7 (i.e., Ï‡ (7) 2 ), and p-values of statistics are in parentheses. p-value less than 0.05 indicates that the fixed and random effects models are sufficiently different to reject the null hypothesis of orthogonality. In this case, it would be better to prefer the fixed effects model and reject the random effects model. According to the p-values reported in Table 3 , fixed effects Tobit model appears to be more appropriate for both UEI and ECPI, and for both dminteginter and dmintegintra. Therefore, fixed effects are adopted for estimation. Table 4 reports the effect of regional integration on energy and CO 2 emissions performance in which province dummies and year dummies are controlled for individual and time heterogeneities. Column (1) and (2) use all provinces to construct regional integration (dminteginter), while columns (3) and (4) use adjacent provinces (dmintegintra). The results suggest that regional integration has significant and substantial positive effects on energy and CO 2 emissions performance. The results of this study are quite robust whether using UEI or ECPI. Moreover, filtering geographical distance would not change our conclusion that regional integration significantly contributes to the improvement of energy and CO 2 emissions performance, as the coefficients only decrease by less than 30%. This indicates that more than 70% of the effects are caused by artificial barriers (such as local protectionism), rather than geographical distance. For the control variables, several results can be drawn from Table 4 . (i) In all models, the coefficients of fiscal expenditure is negative which imply that government spending would lead to the distortions of resource allocation and thus reduce energy and CO 2 emissions performance. (ii) The share of SOE has positive effects on energy and CO 2 emissions performance. Usually, privatization is considered to enhance efficiency improvement because private sector has more incentives to improve efficiency due to competition. But for energy and CO 2 emissions performance, it might not be the case. Facing the government's requirement of energy conservation and CO 2 mitigation, political pressure makes state-owned enterprise to have more incentive to achieve the requirement. (iii) The effects of fuel price on energy and CO 2 emissions performance are ambiguous and statistically insignificant. This might be indicative of the administrative control on energy prices (Lin and Li, 2014) . This is because compared with the product markets, factor markets in China are still distorted and the prices of energy are controlled even decided by the Chinese government. (iv) The coefficients of environmental regulation are significantly negative. As discussed above, environmental regulation has two opposing effects. The results imply that its net effect contributes to more energy use and CO 2 emissions because the diversion of resources to the required abatement might reduce the resources that could be used for R & D. (v) Human capital promotes energy and CO 2 emissions performance which is consistent with our expectations. In particular, Table 4 suggests that international openness helps to Note: The scores of UEI and ECPI are both averaged by time. Fig. 4 . The averaged trends of regional integration. J. Li, B. Lin Energy Policy 101 (2017) 366-378 enhance energy and CO 2 emissions performance. We would further discuss it and its interaction with regional integration in Section 5.2. In order to evaluate the robustness of our results in Table 4 , three alternative estimations are adopted. The first one is alternative method proposed by Simar and Wilson (2007) . Recently, Tobit regression in DEA related two-stage studies has been critical due to the possibility of J. Li, B. Lin Energy Policy 101 (2017) 366-378 serial correlation. To solve this problem, Simar and Wilson (2007) propose a bootstrapped truncated model. Many studies has applied this approach, such as Choi et al. (2012) , Barth et al. (2013) . The results using method proposed by Simar and Wilson (2007) are shown in Table 5 . It further supports our results that China's energy and CO 2 emissions performance benefits from regional integration. Second, we exclude the outliers in regional integration in the sample by excluding all provinces above the 95th percentile and below the 5th percentile. The results in Table 6 are robust to this trimming methodology, which also suggest that regional integration enhance energy and CO 2 emissions performance. Third, another issue which needs to be addressed is the possibility of reverse causality which might lead to endogeneity and thus estimation bias. Reverse causality means that the improvement in efficiency might in turn encourage regional integration. In general, energy and environment efficiency is also a kind of competitiveness, provinces that perform more efficiently in energy use and CO 2 emissions might have fewer incentives to implement regional segmentation because they might be more competitive than other provinces and thus domestic openness would not substantially threaten their internal markets. We propose the instrumental variable method to address the issue of reverse causality. Similar to Lin and Du (2015) , the lag terms of regional integration are employed as the instrumental variables. The intuition underlying this strategy is similar to the idea of General Moment Method (GMM) for dynamic panel model. The results as shown in Table 7 using instrumental variable method are also similar to those in Table 4 which further support the robustness.
