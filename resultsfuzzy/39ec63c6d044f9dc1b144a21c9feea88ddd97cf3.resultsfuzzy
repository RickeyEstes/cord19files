Sequence alignments with scores of 30 or greater were observed between proteolipid and 249 viral decapeptides, excluding identities seen with proteins from similar strains of virus. These include decapeptides from a variety of types of viruses, such as adenoviruses and Epstein-Barr, influenza and measles viruses. Only those with a score of 38 or greater, or which show at least 60% identity are shown in table 1. The degree of similarity between proteolipid and viral proteins is significantly greater than that observed [3] between MBP and viral proteins. Furthermore, although only 10% of the proteins in the protein sequence database are viral proteins, they account for over 30% of the similarities. It is interesting and perhaps significant that many of the strong similarities lie between residues 135 and 150 in the proteolipid. This region is predicted (Shaw, S.-Y., unpublished) to have a strong tendency to form an amphipathic helix (hydrophobic on one side and polar on the other), and thus might be regarded as a prime candidate for an antigenic site. Likewise, many similarities are found with the N-terminus of the proteolipid, a region which has also been predicted to be an amphipathic helix [8l. The two proposed models [8, 9] for the organization of the proteolipid in the myelin membrane are Table 1 Comparison of myelin proteolipid decapeptide sequences with those of certain viral proteins
