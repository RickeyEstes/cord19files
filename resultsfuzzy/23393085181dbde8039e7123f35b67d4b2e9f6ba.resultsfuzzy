First, three different methods of total nucleic acid extraction were tested: QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, PureLink Viral RNA/DNA Mini Kit, and the automated NucliSENS EasyMAG system. Plasma from healthy donors was spiked with different viruses (adenovirus, poliovirus, HHV-4, influenzavirus A) and extracted, and the concentration in the eluate determined by qPCR. Easy-MAG extraction was most efficient for both RNA viruses, while virus concentrations for DNA viruses were similar to PureLink extraction. The Qiagen extraction kit led to the lowest recovery of viral genomes for all tested viruses (Additional file 1: Figure S1 and Table S2 ). Thus, the EasyMAG system was selected as standard extraction method for all further experiments.
