As shown in the TEM images in Figure 1A , SeNPs and Se@RBV appeared monodisperse and spherical. Moreover, the diameter of SeNPs was 200 nm, while that of Se@RBV ,100 nm. Size distribution in Figure 1C confirmed that the average sizes of Se@RBV and SeNPs were 65 nm and 100 nm, respectively. When decorated with RBV on the surface, the surface-free energy of SeNPs decreased and the nanoparticles became more stable. Thus, the diameter of Se@RBV is smaller than SeNPs alone. The particle size of Se@RBV contributed to the stable nanostructure, which made it propitious to pass through the cytomembrane. Surface elemental composition analysis was carried out by EDX. Figure 1B reveals a strong signal of Se atom (91.5%), C atom (7.2%), O atom (1.1%), and N atom (0.2%). The presence of O atom indicated that RBV had conjugated to the surface of SeNPs. As shown in Figure 1D , the zeta potential of SeNPs alone was -25 mV and decreased to -10 mV after carrying RBV, explaining the higher stability of Se@RBV.
