StralSV produced variability matrices and sequence profiles (not shown; for excerpts see Tables 1 and 2 ) from which were extracted data for analyzing related structure Table 1 Excerpt of sample StralSV output "matrix" file for positions 229-269 from poliovirus RdRp analysis fragments and quantifying positional variability. Plots containing data extracted directly from the matrix and profiles files are shown in Figures 3, 4 , and 5. We performed additional analyses in order to annotate the primary StralSV results: 1) Secondary structure assignments were calculated for poliovirus RdRp using DSSP [20] and were plotted along the x-axis of Figure 3 . DSSP output was simplified as follows: helix, comprising alpha helix (H), pi helix (I), and 3/10 helix (G); strand, comprising extended strand (E) or residue in isolated beta bridge (B). 2) To determine whether we could discern patterns with respect to positional hit frequency and previously Table 3 identified polymerase sequence motifs, we overlaid a plot comprising qualified hits versus sequence position with the positions of the well known motifs, extracted from the literature ( Figure 5 , gray boxes with labels A-G). This was accomplished by examining sequence alignments and extracting coordinates defining the known sequence motifs A through G from papers that included poliovirus RdRp among the aligned sequences [21] [22] [23] [24] . Because there was considerable inconsistency regarding the boundaries of the sequence motifs, we defined inclusive boundaries for each motif whereby residues were included if they were identified within a motif in any of the sequence alignments reported in the literature. 3) In order to inspect the most abundant sequence variants (i. e., the most conserved positions) in the context of the positional hit frequency along the reference protein, we extracted from the matrix files the frequencies of the most frequent residues and plotted them versus sequence position along with the positional hits for window size 80 ( Figure 5 ). 4) The literature was searched for evidence of functional annotation [18, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] for the most frequently observed residue positions (see additional file 2: StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 1) and positions for which functional annotation was identified were marked in Figure 5 .
