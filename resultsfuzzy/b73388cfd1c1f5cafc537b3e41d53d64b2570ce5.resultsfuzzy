Of the 1191 genes on the array, a total of 327 genes (27%) were altered by two-fold or more at one or more time points between 6 and 72 h PI. Of 200 transcripts that belonged to the category of unknown genes, 177 (88%) and 23 (12%) were up and down-regulated by two-fold or more, respectively. In contrast, of the 127 annotated genes (39% of differentially expressed genes), 111 (87%) and 16 (13%) were two-fold or more up and down-regulation, respectively. The analysis of altered genes revealed expression changes in many vital functional classes including kinase signaling, interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), chemokines and adhesion molecules, vesicular protein trafficking and fusion proteins genes, host genes involved in viral RNA synthesis, extracellular matrix protein genes, and genes belonging to cell cycle, metabolism, physiology and development, RNA binding, transcription and translation regulation, and ubiquitination. A partial list of differentially expressed genes and a graphical representation of kinase gene expression is shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1 , respectively. A comparison of the gene expression profile for IBV infection in ovo (Table 2 ) and APV infection of chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells in vitro (Munir and Kapur, 2003 ) revealed a list of 14 genes (with >2-fold change in expression) that were common to both viral infections (Table 2 ). This comparison was completed for genes differentially expressed at 24 and 48 h PI. Gene expression changes at 6 and 72 h PI in IBV infection were not compared with APV since similar time points were not available for APV infection.
