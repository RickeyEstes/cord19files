The phylogenetic tree is a branching diagram showing the evolutionary relationships among various biological species based upon similarities and differences in their sequences. A qualitative comparison between our results and the phylogenetic tree of protein sequences is used to prove the utility of our approach. The matching between the results and phylogenetic trees means matching with the na√Øve measure of sequence similarity (sequence homology). The basic local alignment tool (BLAST) is used to draw the phylogenetic trees. The phylogenetic trees of beta globin's seven species, ND5 nine species, and 29 spike protein sequences are illustrated in Figures 8, 9 , and 10, respectively. The qualitative comparison of the results of Tables 9, 10, and 11 and Figures 8, 9 , and 10 shows the utility of our work especially the angle results.
