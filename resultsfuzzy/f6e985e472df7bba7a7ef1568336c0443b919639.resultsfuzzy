We provide an overview of empirical results for the stability of natural and engineered inserted sequences, following the Baltimore classification. Our primary focus is on engineered viruses: studies where gene insertions are an addition to the viral genome (leading to an increase in genome size) and where the subsequent fate of these inserted sequences has been tracked. As inserted sequences can incur a fitness cost, these are often quickly purged from the viral genome. Often these fitness costs are related to a disruption of the viral genome (e.g. gene order). We therefore also consider studies on genome rearrangements in wild viruses and introduce other relevant modifications that shed light on what the impact of genomic inserts can be. We provide an overview of the results and main conclusions of our review in Table 1 .
