The present study characterises the morphological properties, quality parameters and phytochemical composition of A. canadensis fruits. The results are discussed in relation to the potential of serviceberry as a functional food. Table 3 presents the fruit weight and size, TSS, pH, and TA of the analysed serviceberry genotype. Results showed that the fresh fruit are small and spheroidal (length: 9.94 ± 0.22 mm; width: 8.76 ± 0.22 mm), with a mean weight of 0.65 ± 0.03 g. The cultivated serviceberry fruit size is on average greater than the size of the fruit harvested in the wild, as reported in the previous studies (Bakowska- Barczak & Kolodziejczyk, 2008; Cazares-Franco et al., 2014) . The results (Table 3 ) corroborated with Stushnoff (1991) , who reported that cultivated serviceberry showed up to 25% larger fruit size compared with wild fruit one. Quality analysis reported a mean value of TSS 21.90 ± 2.89°Brix, TA 68.82 ± 7.37 meq · L −1 and pH 3.42 ± 0.02 (Table 3 ). The TSS in various serviceberry genotypes ranged from 20% to 30% FW, with 16-23% sucrose and 8-12% reducing sugars (Mazza, 1982) . Wolfe and Wood (1971) found that the sugar content slowly increased as the fruit matured and then considerably accelerated before ripening: fructose content greatly decreased (−25%) after the fruit ripened while the glucose content remained unaltered. The pH of wild fruits, as reported in previous studies (Cazares-Franco et al., 2014; Lim, 2012) , is often lower than the pH of cultivated fruits: the higher pH indicates that the cultivated fruit is a low-acid food, a positive sensory feature, as confirmed by TA values reported in this study. Moreover, a lower TSS/TA ratio than other
