2.1. Preparation of SARS-CoV 3CL pro and effect of isolated phlorotannins on SARS-CoV 3CL pro trans-cleavage assay Because of the numerous functions and requisite roles of cysteine proteases in viral replication and pathogenesis, they may serve as attractive targets for antiviral drugs. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) depends on a chymotrpsin-like cysteine protease (3CL pro ) to process the translated polyproteins into functional viral proteins. This enzyme is a target for potential anti-SARS drugs. Ultimately, our goal is to develop a naturally derived SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitor for use as anti-SARS drug. Our first step toward this goal was to expressed and purified SARS-CoV 3CL pro from E. coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus-RIL cells as described in Section 2. The purified protease ran at approximately 33 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulface-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with greater than 90% purity. The purified 3CL pro from Escherichia coli cells had a specific activity of 32.0 Â± 5.2 lM towards the Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans substrate. A bioassay-guided investigation of the ethanol extract of Ecklonia cava resulted in the isolation of nine phlorotannins:phloroglucinol (1), triphloretol A (2), eckol (3), dioxinodehydroeckol (4), 2-phloroeckol (5), 7-phloroeckol (6), fucodiphloroethol G (7), dieckol (8) , and phlorofucofuroeckol A (9) (Fig. 1) . First, we examined the effect of nine phlorotannins 1-9 on the cell-free SARS-CoV 3CL pro trans-cleavage assay. The percent inhibition at 200 lM concentrations of compounds 1-9 was initially determined, and the results are reported in Table 1 . As shown in Table 1 and Figure  2A , all of the phlorotannins investigated, except phloroglucinol (1), exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on 3CL pro hydrolysis with IC 50 values ranging from 2.7 to 164.7 lM against cell-free 3CL pro trans-cleavage. As the concentrations of the inhibitors were increased, the residual SARS-CoV 3CL pro activity decreased dramatically. All inhibitors exhibited a similar relationship between enzyme activity and enzyme concentration. As an example, the relevant data for dieckol (8) is illustrated in Figure 2B The inhibition activity was slightly affected by subtle changes in structure. Initially, we compared a closed-chain trimer of phloroglucinol (3, eckol) with an opened-chain trimer of phloroglucinol (2, triphloretol A), and we found that the activity of eckol (IC 50 = 8.8 lM) was 20-fold higher than that of the trimer itself (IC 50 = 164.7 lM). Replacement of the 3,5-dihydrophenoxy group by a dioxinodehydro group (4, IC 50 = 158.3 lM) led to weaker inhibition compared to 3; however it was still more active than 2. Similar to this relationship, substitution of the 3,5-dihydrophenyl group on the opened-chain trimer that formed a biaryl linkage tended to increase the activity (7, IC 50 = 22.5 lM vs 2, IC 50 = 164.7 lM). However, substitution of the 3,5-dihydrophenoxy group of eckol yielded the tetremeric phlorotannins 4-6 with reduced activities. When we compared a series of phloroeckols (5 and 6), we found that introduction a 3,5-dihydrophenoxy substituent at the 2C-position of the 3,5-dihydrophenoxy group (phloro-) increased the inhibitory activity $3-fold; 2-phloroeckol (5) had an IC 50 = 13.3 lM and 7-phloroeckol (6) had an IC 50 = 42.1 lM. Interestingly, blocking of one of the hydroxy units (C7) on the A ring, which contains a five-membered closed ring, appear to exert a variable (9, IC 50 = 16.7 lM) but not insignificant effect on the activity. As evidenced from the SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibition data, the eckol structure is essential and crucial for good inhibition of 3CL pro . Most importantly, we found that dieckol (8) , which possesses two eckol groups linked through a diphenyl ether, showed the most potent SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 2.7 lM). In addition, the inhibitory effect of dieckol (8) was comparable to that of a naturally derived quinone-methide triterpene (IC 50 = 2.6 lM), which we isolated during our previous investigation on 3CL pro inhibitors from Tripterygium regelii. 24 Dieckol (8) showed 30-, 50-, and 60-fold greater activities than the positive control, hesperetin (60 lM), daidzein (105 lM), and aloeemodin (132 lM), respectively, previously reported by Lin and co-workers. 22 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the biological activities of phlorotannins isolated from E. cava toward SARS-CoV 3CL pro . Next, we studied the kinetic mechanism of the interaction of these inhibitors with SARS-CoV 3CL pro . The enzymatic activity was measured with a series of substrate concentrations and various inhibitor concentrations. The inhibition data were globally fit to all of the possible kinetic models. As shown in Figure 2C , the kinetic plots show that dieckol (8) has competitive inhibition profiles because the Lineweaver-Burk plot (1/V vs 1/[S]) is a series of straight lines with the same y-axis intercept for the SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors. All of the isolated inhibitors exhibited the same mode of action for inhibition. The K i values in Table 1 were calculated from the Dixon plots, which are useful for determining the K i value of the inhibitor (see Supplementary data Fig. 4S ). The predominant inhibition mode shown by the naturally occurring viral enzyme inhibitors was noncompetitive. Interestingly, the inhibition of SARS-CoV 3CL pro by the phlorotannins isolated from E. cava was rarely competitive, encouraged us to further investigate this phenomenon with a more detailed biological study.
