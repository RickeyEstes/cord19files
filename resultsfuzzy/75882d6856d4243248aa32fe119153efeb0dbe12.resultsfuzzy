I nterferon (IFN) is a key endogenous mediator of viral clearance by the innate immune response. One excellent example of this is hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection of the liver (1) . Interferon signaling drives the expression of multiple interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which mediate viral clearance. ISGs, however, can also be induced by other factors, including inflammatory stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-␣) (2) . HCV infection, which induces chronic inflammation of the liver, is associated with high serum TNF-␣ (3, 4) . Interestingly, anti-TNF-␣ treatment has been shown to lead to an improved virologic response to IFN-␣/ribavirin antiviral therapy for HCV (5) , while other data show safety of combined treatment but no effect on HCV viral loads of HCV treatment-naive individuals (6) . The purpose of the present study is to define an important causal link between inflammation and the host hepatic innate immune response, with broad viral relevance. Our recent work in the host innate immune response to chronic HCV infection suggested an association between hepatocytes and the liver resident immune cells that drive liver inflam-mation (7) (8) (9) . There is a dichotomous response to chronic HCV infection in the liver, and this response predicts who will and who will not respond to exogenous IFN-␣ treatment. In patients that do not respond to therapy with IFN/ribavirin, hepatocytes have strong preactivation of the IFN-response, with high expression of a subset of ISGs (7) (8) (9) . In patients exhibiting a sustained virologic response on therapy with IFN/ribavirin, tissue macrophages show a high expression of ISGs (7, 9) . The expression of ISGs in macrophages or hepatocytes is more predictive of treatment outcome than IL28B polymorphisms (7) ; this finding suggests a link between hepatic inflammatory cell activation and viral clearance. Liver Kupffer cell inflammatory responses are induced by and play a role in the control and clearance of multiple viral infections of the liver (10, 11) . Although the mechanisms underlying these patterns are undoubtedly complex, the association between liver macrophages and hepatocytes raises the question of how the hepatocytes react to the cytokines produced by the macrophages (and other inflammatory cells). If ISG expression in hepatocytes reflects a response to inflammatory stimuli, then how the liver responds to a viral infection will be modulated by the inflammatory milieu. In HCV infection, we have found that the ISG15/USP18 pathway is an important regulatory pathway. Both ISG15 and USP18 are ISGs that are strongly upregulated in the livers of IFN treatment-resistant patients (7) (8) (9) . ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like protein that is strongly upregulated by IFN and conjugates to multiple cellular proteins (12, 13) . USP18 is an ISG15-specific protease that is also upregulated by IFN-␣ (12, 13) . Both ISG15 and USP18 have been suggested to blunt type 1 IFN signaling (12, (14) (15) (16) . In addition to its ability to remove ISG15 from its conjugated proteins, USP18 has been shown to bind to the type 1 IFN receptor and blunt IFN signaling (15) . Upregulation of USP18 may represent a negative-feedback loop counteracting the effects of type 1 IFN. Furthermore, knockdown of USP18 increases both ISG induction and anti-HCV activity of IFN-␣ (14) , and data have shown that IFN-␣ treatment given to mice in vivo increases hepatic USP18 and blunts the effect of a subsequent dose of IFN-␣ (12) . The mechanisms controlling USP18 expression in the liver are poorly understood but will have relevance to understanding innate immune mechanisms in chronic viral infection. Although the majority of work on USP18 has centered on its upregulation by type 1 IFN, interferon stimulated genes have multiple upregulatory stimuli other than IFN-␣ (2, 17) . For example, inflammatory stimuli, e.g., endotoxin and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), have been shown to upregulate USP18 in peritoneal exudate macrophages (18) . If similar stimuli lead to increased USP18 expression in hepatocytes, then this pathway could represent a novel link between inflammatory and innate immune responses in the liver. The present study is based on the hypothesis that liver inflammation will directly impact hepatocyte expression of USP18 and therefore will impact IFN signaling. This link will have relevance to multiple diseases, since inflammatory stimuli such as TNF-␣ and LPS have been shown to play roles in many liver diseases, including viral hepatitis (19) (20) (21) . The link may also help to explain our observations in chronic HCV infection, since chronic HCV infection is characterized by increased serum TNF-␣ (3, 4), increased hepatocyte USP18, and impaired IFN responsiveness (8) . Quite apart from HCV, the importance of the link between hepatic inflammation and innate immune response lies in the downstream effects of the impairment of innate immunity. We speculate that by blocking IFN-␣ signaling, USP18 expression may lead to an enhanced susceptibility to infection with interferon-sensitive viruses and enhanced viral proliferation. Support for this notion is found in a mouse study in which expression of USP18 in macrophages led to lower IFN responsiveness, leading to locally restricted replication of VSV (22) . In the present study, treatment of hepatic cells with LPS and TNF-␣, but not IL-6 or IL-10, led to upregulated USP18 expression in hepatocytes. The enhanced USP18 expression was associated with decreased IFN-␣-stimulated expression of p-STAT1 and ISGs, a phenomenon reversed by USP18 knockdown. As an in vivo correlate of our in vitro findings, experimentally induced hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury induced USP18 mRNA expression in liver and enhanced lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV) replication, an effect not seen in USP18 Ϫ/Ϫ mice. These data demonstrate that certain inflammatory stimuli (TNF-␣ and LPS), as well as ischemic injury, but not other cytokines (IL-6 and IL-10) can lead to enhanced hepatocyte USP18 expression and thereby inhibit IFN signaling. These findings lend new knowledge to our understanding of how inflammation can modulate hepatic innate immune responses, with USP18 representing a potential target for intervention to reverse any proviral effect of inflammation. phorylated-STAT1 (p-STAT-1; Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA), rabbit polyclonal anti-STAT-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat polyclonal anti-UBE1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or mouse monoclonal anti-actin (Sigma) antibodies, followed by anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA). An enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to determine the levels of protein expression. Flow cytometric quantification of USP18 expression in Huh7.5 cells. USP18 expression on Huh7.5 cells treated with LPS or TNF was quantified by using flow cytometry as previously described (28) . Briefly, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with mouse anti-human USP18 polyclonal antibody (Abnova) or a relevant isotype-matched control antibody. Staining was detected with a secondary goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The cells were acquired using a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). A minimum of 10,000 events were collected. The resulting data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). The experiments were repeated four times. siRNA targeting murine USP18 and UBE1L. USP18 small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a pool of three target-specific 19-to 25-nucleotide (nt) siRNAs designed to knock down USP18 gene expression that was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The UBE1L siRNA used was a pool of three to five target-specific 19-to 25-nt siRNAs designed to knockdown mouse UBE1L gene expression and was obtained from Santa Cruz. USP18 and UBE1L siRNA was transfected into 5 ϫ 10 5 primary murine hepatocytes according to the manufacturer's instructions using the Santa Cruz siRNA reagent system sc-45064 (Santa Cruz) and as previously described (14) . Inhibition of inflammatory signaling in primary mouse hepatocytes. To inhibit LPS-or TNF-␣-stimulated NF-B activation, primary mouse hepatocytes were incubated with the following inhibitors for 30 min prior to 6 h of stimulation with LPS or TNF-␣: P6062, a protein kinase A inhibitor (29); NSC33994, a Jak2 inhibitor (30); P3115, a protein kinase C inhibitor (31); PD098059, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor (32); silibinin, an inhibitor of IKK␣ (33) ; and wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase inhibitor (34) . The concentrations, sources, and main targets of these inhibitors are described in Table 1 . After LPS or TNF-␣ stimulation, hepatocytes were harvested and USP18 and IL-1␤ (a surrogate of NF-B activation) mRNA expression was evaluated as described below. RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Huh7.5 cells and primary murine hepatocytes were treated with IFN-␣ (100 U/ml), TNF-␣ (20 ng/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), IL-6 (100 ng/ml), or IL-10 (10 ng/ ml) over a 24-h time course, and USP18 expression was determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) as previously described (8, 9) . Briefly, total RNA was prepared from cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reverse transcription reactions of the extracted RNA were performed with a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's directions. First, 1 g of extracted RNA was added in a total volume of 15 l of combined cDNA reaction reagents with random hexamer oligonucleotides as the first-strand primer in a 1.5-ml reaction tube. Samples were heated to 65°C for 10 min, chilled on ice for 5 min, and incubated at 37°C for 1 h, followed by a 10-min incubation at 80°C. The specific primers for all of the detected genes for the PCRs were based on GenBank-published sequences: Mus musculus ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18; NM_011909) forward primer (5=-TACAGCAGAGAGCAGCAGGA) and reverse primer (5=-CACATGTCGGAGCTTGCTAA); Mus musculus myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1 (Mx1; NR_003520) forward primer (5=-TCTGAGGAGAGCCAGACAAT-3=) and reverse primer (5=-ACTCTGGTCCCCAATGACAG); mouse hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT; NM_013556) forward primer (5=-TCAGT CAACGGGGGACATAAA) and reverse primer (5=-GGGGCTGTAC TGCTTAACCAG); Mus musculus IL-1␤ (NM_008361) forward primer (5=-GAAATGCCACCTTTTGACAGTG) and reverse primer (5=-TGG ATGCTCTCATCAGGACAG); Homo sapiens IFN-␣2b (IFNA2b; AY255838) forward primer (5=-GCTTGGGATGAGACCCTCCTA) and reverse primer (5=-CCCACCCCCTGTATCACAC); Homo sapiens IFN-␥ (IFNG; NM_000416) forward primer (5=-TCGGTAACTGACTTGAATG TCCA) and reverse primer (5=-TCGCTTCCCTGTTTTAGCTGC); Homo sapiens actin, beta-like 2 (ACTBL2; NM_001017992) forward primer (5=-GTCTGCCTTGGTAGTGGATAATG) and reverse primer (5=-TCGAGG ACGCCCTATCATGG); Homo sapiens ubiquitin specific peptidase 18 (USP18; NM_017414) forward primer (5=-AGGAGAAGCGTCCCTT TCCA) and reverse primer (5=-TGGTCCTTAATCAGGTTCCAGAG); and Homo sapiens myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance-1 (MX1; NM_001144925) forward primer (5=-GGTGGTCCCCAGTAATGTGG) and reverse primer (5=-CGTCAAGATTCCGATGGTCCT). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7900HT machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with SYBR green realtime PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the directions provided by the manufacturer. All of the RNA samples and controls were assayed in duplicate. Real-time PCR conditions were as follows: 10 min at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 15 s at 60°C monitor fluorescence in SYBR channel during a 60°C annealing/extension step. The results were analyzed by using Applied Biosystems SDS2.2 software (Applied Biosystems). Experimental hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury model. Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (HIRI) was simulated as before (35) . Partial (70%) hepatic ischemia was induced for 60 min in mice, after which the surgical clamps were removed. Control (Sham) animals underwent anesthesia and laparotomy alone. Animals were euthanized 6 or 24 h after ischemia/reperfusion, the affected liver segments were removed, and target gene expression was determined by qPCR in whole liver tissue. LCMV strain WE was propagated in L929 cells (ATCC CCL-1) as previously described (36) . In additional experiments, after 60 min HIRI or sham laparotomy, mice were infected with 2 ϫ 10 6 PFU of LCMV WE by intravenous tail vein injection. The ischemic liver lobes were harvested at day 7 postinfection. Snap-frozen liver tissue samples were homogenized in ␣-MEM (Multicell, USA) supplemented with 5% FBS, L-glutamine, and 100 U of penicillin/ml plus 100 g of streptomycin/ml using the TissueLyser LT system (Qiagen, Netherlands). Viral titers were examined on MC57 cells (ATCC CRL-2295) using a focus-forming assay as previously described (37) . Statistical analysis. All data were analyzed using Prism version 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Statistically significant differences in Fig. 1E were calculated by using a two-tailed Student t test (Prism software). The impact of HIRI on LCMV replication (see Fig. 6A and B) was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance with the Tukey's post hoc test. 


Section:inflammation may prevent the control of viral infection when it impairs the innate immune response, enhancing viral replication and spread. blunted immunity as a result of inappropriate innate inflammatory responses is a common characteristic of chronic viral infections. previous studies have shown that expression of certain interferon-stimulated genes is upregulated in chronic hcv infection, leading to impaired hepatocyte responses. in this study, we show that multiple inflammatory stimuli can modulate interferon stimulated gene expression and thus inhibit hepatocyte interferon signaling via usp18 induction. these findings represent a new paradigm for how inflammation alters hepatic innate immune responses, with the induction of usp18 representing a potential target for intervention in various inflammatory states.
