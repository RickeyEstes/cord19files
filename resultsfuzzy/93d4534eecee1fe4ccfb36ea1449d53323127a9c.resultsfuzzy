By nonselective cultivation, 162 E. coli isolate were obtained for AST. Thereof, 140 (86.4%) were fully susceptible to all 16 antimicrobials used in this study, and two (1.2%) showed intermediate resistance to cefazolin and streptomycin, respectively (supplementary Table 1 ). All isolates were susceptible to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, fosfomycin, aztreonam and kanamycin (supplementary Table 1 ). AMR E. coli were isolated from 20 (12.4%) of the samples. Resistance to tetracycline was detected most frequently (11.7%), followed by ampicillin and streptomycin (both 10.5%), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (9.9%). Resistance to all other antimicrobial agents were detected at rates between 0% and 1.2%. MDR was identified in 17 (85%) of the 20 resistant E. coli isolates, corresponding to 10.5% of the total of 162 E. coli . The distribution of antimicrobial resistance among the 162 isolates is shown in Fig. 1 , and the resistance profiles of the AMR E. coli are summarized in Table 1 . There is a scarcity of previous data on AMR in camels in Africa to compare our findings with. However, a previous study from Tunisia showed that among E. coli isolated from fecal samples of camel calves, the ampicillin/tetracycline resistance phenotype was most prevalent, corresponding to the most commonly used antibiotics in that country [30] . For Kenya, recent reports on the consumption of antimicrobials in animals are not available, however, the tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim resistance phenotypes observed in this study correlate with data reported from 1997 to 2001 that show that tetracyclines, sulfonamides and trimethoprim are the most frequently used antimicrobials in food-producing animals in Kenya [31] . Notably, the AST results for the antimicrobials were interpreted using breakpoints relevant for the administration in humans and thus may not be reflective of susceptibility when applied to camels. Nevertheless, the results presented in this study provide the possibility to monitor trends in antimicrobial susceptibility and to identify emerging resistance. Accordingly, quantitative data such as the zone diameter values provided in supplementary Table 1 could be helpful. Among the 20 camels with AMR E. coli , 17 (85%) were female, and three (15%) were male, amounting to 14.6% of the 116 female and 6.7% of the 45 male camels included in this study, respectively. Accordingly, fecal carriage of MDR E. coli was confirmed for 12.9% of the female and 6.7% of the male camels, respectively. The relatively high prevalence of AMR isolates among female camels is noteworthy. The frequency of ampicillin, streptomycin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim resistance may be reflective of the usage of antimicrobials commonly used to treat mastitis in camels. In contrast to cattle, mastitis in camels is treated systemically with penicillin/aminoglycoside or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [32] . However, for this study, no data on the use of antimicrobials was available, and further studies would be required in order to correlate the use of antimicrobials with the fecal carriage of AMR in camels. By selective cultivation, one ESBL producing E. coli was detected, amounting to 0.6% of the 162 samples. Molecular characterization assigned the isolate to phylogenetic group A and sequence type (ST) 48 and identified the ESBL-encoding gene bla CTX âˆ’M-15 . The ESBL producer was identified in a fecal sample of a female camel, corresponding to a fecal carriage rate of 0.6% among the 162 camels and 0.9% of the female camels. ESBL producing E. coli from feces of healthy camels have very rarely been described in Africa. So far, only one CTX-M-1 producing E. coli isolated from a food producing dromedary camel in Tunisia has been described [19] . While CTX-M-1 is a livestock associated ESBL, CTX-M-15, which was identified in E. coli ST48 in this study, has emerged worldwide as one of the most important ESBLs in human medicine [10] . Although the phylogenetic group A and the sequence type of E.coli ST48 does not indicate high pathogenicity [28 , 29] , it is to be noted that CTX-M-15 producing E. coli ST48 have been reported to cause nosocomial urinary tract infections in Belgium [33] and have been detected among human isolates in hospitals in Nigeria [34] . Furthermore, E. coli ST48 belongs to clonal complex 10 which is associated globally with the dispersion of CTX-M type ESBLs [35] . Although the prevalence of ESBL producing E. coli among the camels analyzed in this study is low, this observation is important, since such isolates could be transmitted to humans. Indeed, ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae have been detected previously in raw and in fermented camel milk in Kenya [36] . Fecal carriage of ESBL producers in camels may contribute to such contaminations in non-industrialized milk production. The emergence of plasmid-mediated colistin resistance is most probably related to the use of colistin in animal husbandry [6] . Monitoring colistin resistance is important, since the mcr gene has been detected in food producing animals worldwide, including Africa [37] . In our study, screening for plasmid-mediated colistin resistance genes mcr-1 through mcr-5 remained negative for all isolates (data not shown). The absence of plasmid-mediated colistin resistance confirms previous reports from Tunisia and suggests that camels do not play a major role as a reservoir for mcr harboring E. coli [38] . However, although we screened for all known variants at the time of analysis, novel mcr genes are emerging globally, and it cannot be excluded that variants including mcr-6 through mcr-8 may have been missed in this study. A further limitation of this study is the sampling scheme which may have led to bias associated with operational circumstances, e.g., sampling of more manageable animals. This may have resulted in an overrepresentation of samples originating from female camels. In conclusion, our results indicate that dromedary camels in Kenya may be reservoirs of E. coli exhibiting resistance to antimicrobials commonly used in humans and animal medicine. Furthermore, camels may carry ESBL producing E. coli that could potentially be transmitted to humans by direct contact or via the food chain.
