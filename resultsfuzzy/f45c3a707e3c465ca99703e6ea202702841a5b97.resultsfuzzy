Finally, analyses will be most useful if they are shared widely across policymakers, local health teams and other research groups. The format for dissemination could be anything from a report to a scientific publication. Reports can be made available faster and regularly updated but do not undergo the peer review process of publications. Peer review can delay publication, though there are now new platforms for fast-tracking this process [154, 155] . At the time of writing, as interest in Zika virus is gaining momentum, there seems to be an encouraging trend to the use of pre-print servers [156,157].
