The MWCNT/Tyr was prepared as previously reported. 30 Briefly, mushroom Tyr from Agaricus bisporus and BSA (BSA/Tyr ratio 3:1) were immobilized on oxidized MWCNTs, 34 by deposition of a layer of PDDA (MWCNTs-PDDA/Tyr ratio of 5:1) in sodium phosphate buffer (PBS; 0.1 M, pH 7) at room temperature ( Fig. 1, step A) . The excess PDDA was removed by centrifugation/re-dispersion cycles since residual PDDA in the solution can precipitate upon mixing with enzyme. The concentration of adsorbed PDDA was evaluated by UV-vis analysis (at 595 nm) of the supernatant after treatment with Comassie Brillant Blue (CBB) (experimental details and the calibration curve for PDDA are in Supplementary information, SI # 1, Table A , Fig. 1 ). 35 The amount of PDDA adsorbed per mg of starting material was found to be 0.58 ± 0.01 mg. This amount is similar to the 'just enough' amount of PDDA (0.48 mg) required to cover all the surface of MWCNTs (100% covering efficacy), as previously reported. 36 The presence of cationic PDDA facilitates the loading of Tyr, that is negatively charged at the operative pH 7.0 (isoelectric point of Tyr 4.7-5.0). 37 Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), an inert enzyme characterized by an isoelectric point close to Tyr, was used during the co-immobilization procedure to reduce the surface area available to the enzyme, avoiding undesired conformational changes due to enzyme strives for the greatest surface coverage. 38 Glutaraldehyde (GA) was then added to increase the reticulation grade and stability of the catalyst (Fig. 1, step B ). 39 Crosslinking with glutaraldehyde is a widely applied procedure for the immobilization/reticulation of enzymes on different kind of support. 40 In accordance with data reported in the literature, 41 the effectiveness of the crosslinking procedure was confirmed by FT-IR analysis, observing the appearance of a new absorption band in the range of 1700-2100 cm À1 attributable to the formation of Schiff bases (representative FT-IR spectra of MWCNT/Tyr with or without GA are in Supplementary information, SI # 2, Figs. 2 and 3). The activity of native Tyr (81.2 U/mg) was determined by the dopachrome assay following the oxidation of L-tyrosine at 475 nm (the enzyme unit is defined as the increase in absorbance of 10 À3 unit/min at 25°C in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0). 42 The activity of MWCNT/Tyr (80.5 U/mg), and the value of activity parameters, namely immobilization yield (68%), and activity yield (48.5%), were in accordance with our previous data (for the definition of these parameters see in the experimental part). 30 The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) of MWCNT/Tyr were in accordance with data previously reported, and confirmed the polyelectrolyte deposition and enzyme immobilization. 30 In particular, the AFM analysis clearly showed functionalized nanotubes characterized by a smooth surface probably due to the presence of BSA in the interstitial sites between Tyr molecules. The maximum height and width were higher than that observed for MWCNTs alone (experimental procedures, SEM analysis, and magnified details of the bi-dimensional high resolution AFM images of MWCNT/Ty and MWCNTs with the corresponding profiles, are in Supplementary information SI #3, Figs. 4 and 5). 30 Kinetic parameters for native Tyr and MWCNT/Tyr were evaluated in CH 2 Cl 2 and PBS, using tyrosol acetate 2a as a selected substrate to be oxidized (see next). The initial reaction rates were measured at substrate concentrations ranging from 1.0 to 20 mM at 25°C. Kinetic constants were evaluated by using different linear regression equations (Lineweaver-Burk, Hanes and Eadie-Hofstee). The kinetic parameters (K m , V max , and K cat ) for the native enzyme and MWCNT/Tyr are reported in Table 1 . MWCNT/Tyr shows a performance about two times lower than the native enzyme, in agreement with the expected decrease of catalytic efficiency after immobilization. The catalytic efficacy of MWCNT/Tyr (defined as V max /K m ) was found to be 81.7 10 -4 (as the average value of the three tests). The ester derivatives of commercially available 3(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid 1 and tyrosol 2 (4-hydroxyphenylethyl alcohol) were used as substrates. In particular, the ester derivatives 1a-d (Scheme 1) were prepared by reaction of 1 with an excess of the appropriate alcohol in the presence of trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) at 25°C (experimental details are in Supporting SI #4). 43 The esterification of 2 to yield compounds 2a-d (Scheme 2) was carried-out using lipase from Candida antarctica to avoid the possible formation of mixture of esters, due to competition between alcoholic and phenol groups (Supporting SI #5). 44 The oxidation of compounds 1 and 1a-d (0.05 mmol) was performed with MWCNT/Tyr (240 U) in CH 2 Cl 2 /buffer (Na phosphate 0.1 M pH 7, CH 2 Cl 2 /buffer ratio 1.0:0.1) at 25°C under O 2 atmosphere for 24 h (Scheme 1, Table 2 ). The use of CH 2 Cl 2 as reaction solvent was necessary to increase the solubility of hydrophobic substrates, in accordance with improved stability and selectivity (with limited formation of ortho-benzoquinones and polymeric side-products) reported for Tyr in organic solvents. 45 The oxidation of 1 and 1a (as selected samples) was also performed using previously reported Tyr/ECM as reference, in which Tyr is covalently immobilized on micro-spheres of the synthetic resin Eupergit C250L (methacrylamide, N,N 0 -methylenbis-acrylamide polymer). 26 MWCNT/Tyr selectively afforded catechol derivatives 3 and 3a-d in quantitative conversion of substrate and yield of product (Table 2 ). In these reactions, MWCNT/Tyr showed a reactivity similar to Tyr, and higher than Tyr/ECM ( Table 2 , entry 3 versus entries 1 and 2, and entry 6 versus entries 4 and 5). In this latter case 600 U were required to obtain the quantitative yield of products (Table 1 , entries 2, 5 and 10). These data further confirm the benign role of MWCNT as nanosized supports for the immobilization of Tyr in synthetic applications. In a similar way, the oxidation of tyrosol esters 2a-d afforded the corresponding lipophilic catechols 4a-d (Scheme 2) in quantitative conversion of substrate and yield of product ( Table 2 , entries [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Again, MWCNT/Tyr performed better than Tyr/ECM ( Table 2 , entry 11 vs entry 10). Recycling experiments proceeded with success in the oxidation of compound 1 under similar experimental conditions. After the first oxidation, MWCNT/Tyr was recovered by centrifugation, washed, and reused with fresh substrate. As shown in Table 3 , MWCNT/Tyr was used for at least six cycles with only a slight decrease of efficiency to give 3 ( Table 3 , entry 1 vs entry 6). Note that MWCNT/Tyr was more stable than Tyr/ECM, for which a significant decrease in the activity was observed (ca. 37%; Table 3 , entry 1 vs entry 6).
