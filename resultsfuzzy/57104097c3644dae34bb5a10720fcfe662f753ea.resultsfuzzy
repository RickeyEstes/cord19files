To synthesize the final nucleosides 3aee, we designed the retrosynthetic analysis, as illustrated in Scheme 1. Final nucleoside 3 was derived from amino intermediate 4 by the linear purine base build-up approach. Amino derivative 4 was easily derived from ketone 5 via the stereoselective reduction of the ketone and S N 2 displacement with azide as key steps. 6-Fluoroketone 5 was synthesized using stereoselective electrophilic fluorination of silyl enol ether, which was obtained from key intermediate 6. Ketone 6 was derived from D-cyclopentenone 7, using a Michael reaction as a key step. Intermediate 7 was efficiently derived from D-ribose according to our previously published procedure with a minor modification [16, 17] . Key intermediate 6 was synthesized according to our previously published procedure, as shown in Scheme 2 [17] . Briefly, D-ribose was converted to diene 8 in four steps without purification in a 64% yield. The ring-closing metathesis (RCM) reaction of 6 with Neolyst M2 instead of Grubbs' catalyst, followed by pyridinium dichromate (PDC) oxidation afforded the cyclopentenone 7 in a 56% yield. This modified procedure created desired intermediate 7 in six steps with a 36% overall yield [16] . The Michael addition of 7 with vinylmagnesium bromide in the presence of copper(I) bromide afforded vinyl ketone 9 [18] in a 76% yield. Reduction of 9 with sodium borohydride yielded a-alcohol 10a as the single stereoisomer, which was protected with a tertbutyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS) group to yield 10b. The hydroborationoxidation of 10b with a borane-dimethyl sulphide complex afforded primary alcohol 11. The removal of the TBDPS group of 11 with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) yielded diol 12, in which the primary hydroxyl group was selectively protected with a TBDPS group to afford 13. Oxidation of the remaining secondary alcohol in 13 with tetra-n-propylammonium perruthenate (TPAP) and Nmethylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO) afforded ketone 6 [17] , which served as the key starting material for the electrophilic fluorination. Ketone 6 was converted to the amines 18a and 18b, which were the key precursors for the synthesis of the final nucleosides, as shown in Scheme 3. Ketone 6 was treated with lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (LiHMDS), followed by trapping the resulting enolate with chlorotriethylsilane (TESCl) to produce silyl enol ether. The silyl enol ether was treated with electrophilic fluorine, octane ditetrafluoroborate) to produce desired 6-b-fluoro-cyclopentanone 14 as the single stereoisomer, which was equilibrated to geminal diol because of the electronegative fluorine atom [14, 16, 17] . The b stereochemistry of fluorine was obtained because of the steric hindrance by the 2,3-isopropylidene group, which was confirmed by long-range coupling between H-8 and 6 0 -b-F and Xray crystallography after conversion to adenosine derivative 3a. 6,6-Difluoro ketone 15 was synthesized from 14 in a 50% yield using the same procedure. Fluoro ketones 14 and 15 were reduced with sodium borohydride to produce alcohols 16a and 16b, respectively. First, we attempted a direct condensation reaction with 6chloropurine under the Mitsunobu conditions to obtain the desired nucleoside, but it failed to yield the desired condensed product. Direct S N 2 reactions of triflates synthesized from 16a and 16b with a 6-chloropurine anion were also unsuccessful. Thus, we decided to utilize the linear purine base build-up approach [14] . The S N 2 displacement of triflates of 16a and 16b with a linear, less bulky and more powerful nucleophile, NaN 3 proceeded smoothly to yield azido derivatives 17a and 17b, respectively. Catalytic reduction of 17a and 17b with 10% Pd/C yielded amines 18a and 18b, respectively. 6-Fluoroamine 18a was treated with 5-amino-4,6dichloropyrimidine and triethylamine in n-butanol under microwave irradiation to yield 19a (Scheme 4) [14, 16] . However, weaker nucleophile, 6,6-difluoroamine 18b did not give desired product 19b under the same microwave conditions. Thus, we used a stronger electrophile, 4,6-dichloro-5-formamidopyrimidine rather than 5-amino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine, which afforded the desired product 19b in a good yield. The cyclisation of 19a and 19b with diethoxymethyl acetate yielded 6-chloropurine nucleosides 20a and 20b, respectively. The H-8 proton in the 1 H NMR spectrum of 20a was split as a doublet with a small coupling constant (J Â¼ 2.4 Hz), which resulted from the long-range coupling between H-8 and 6 0 -b-F, which confirmed the desired stereochemistry of 6 0 -F, as well as 6-chloropurine. Treatment of 20a and 20b with 50% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid yielded 6-chloropurine nucleosides 21a and 21b, respectively. For the synthesis of adenosine derivatives, 21a was treated with saturated tert-butanolic ammonia to yield 3a, whereas 21b was converted to 3d using saturated methanolic ammonia solution in a steel bomb. Treatment of 21a and 21b with 40% aqueous methylamine afforded N [6]-methyladenosine nucleosides 3b and 3e, respectively. Hydrolysis of 21a with 1 N HCl in 1,4-dioxane yielded inosine derivative 3c. The structure of 3a was confirmed by singlecrystal X-ray crystallography [19] (Fig. 2 ).
