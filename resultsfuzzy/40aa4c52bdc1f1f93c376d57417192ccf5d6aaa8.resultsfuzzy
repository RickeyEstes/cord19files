Nucleotide sequence and organization of the SBMV-B genome The main strategy employed in the determination of the sequence of SBMV-B involved the use of the dideoxychain termination method together with a selection of overlapping cDNA clones which spanned the full-length of the genome of SBMV-B, excluding approximately 40 nucleotides at the 5' end. The use of synthetic oligonucleotide primers designed on both strands of the clones as the sequences were elucidated enabled systematic sequencing along the whole length of the clone. All of the genome was sequenced from at least two independent clones and each clone was sequenced on both strands. Attempts at cloning the 5' terminal sequences into the bacterial plasmids pUC18 or pBluescript proved unsuccessful and all clones obtained lacked at least 40 terminal nucleotides. The sequence of the 5' terminal region of the RNA that was not contained within the cloned cDNA was therefore analyzed directly on the viral RNA using specific oligonucleotide primers and reverse transcriptase and by additional extension using terminal transferase. The reason for the inability to clone the 5' terminal region in pBluescript and related plasmids is unknown but it did prove possible to clone in plasmids in Escherichia coil behind the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. It appeared that this portion of the SBMV-B genome could be toxic to E. coil ceils if behind the T7 or T3 promoters. The 3' terminal sequence was obtained from independent poly(A)-tailed cDNA clones and shows identity in all but eight bases when compared to the published 393 nucleotide terminal sequence of SBMV-B (Mang et aL, 1982) . Six of the changes were U-C, C-U, A-U, or U-A substitutions, the 3' nucleotide was a G-U substitution and nucleotide 91 on the Mang eta/. (1982) sequence was absent in our sequence. The differences were conserved in all the clones that were sequenced and could represent isolate heterogeneity rather than sequencing artifacts. The complete nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of the predicted translation products of SBMV-B are shown in Fig. 2 . The genome contains 4109 nucleotides and thus is slightly shorter than that of SBMV-C. The base composition of SBMV-B RNA comprised 23.7% A, 24.5% C, 25.6% G, and 26.0% U residues, which is similar to that reported from direct analysis (Tremaine, 1966; Ghabrial et aL, 1967) , and the RNA has an overall sequence identity with SBMV-C of only 55%. The identity of SBMV-B with RYMV at the nucleotide level was 45.1%; sequence homology between RYMV and SBMV-C was 45.6%. Computer analysis of SBMV-B RNA and its complementary strand in all six possible reading frames revealed three potential open reading frames (ORFs) of >10 kDa on the messenger-sense strand of the RNA, referred to as ORF 1 to ORF 3 in order of their proximity to the 5' end of the sequence (Fig. 1) ; there were no 0RFs of >10 kDa on the complementary strand. Thus, the overall genome arrangement of ORFs 1, 2, and 3 appears similar to ORFs 1, 2, and 4 of SBMV-C ( Fig. 1) and RYMV. However, there are differences in detail. In SBMV-B and RYMV there are intercistronic regions between ORFs 1 and 2 whereas these ORFs overlap in SBMV-C. In SBMV-B there is also an intercistronic region between ORFs 2 and 3 whereas the analogous ORFs of SBMV-C and RYMV (ORFs 2 and 4) overlap. No potential internal coding region within ORF 2 similar to the ORFs 3 of SBMV-C and RYMV could be identified in SBMV-B. An increasing number of viral genes are now known to utilize non-AUG codons, which allow translation of multiple related proteins from a single ORF (Beccera et aL, 1985; Prats et aL, 1989; Gordon et aL, 1992) . The efficiency of translation is generally much lower than initiation at AUG. However, even with these initiation codons no ORF could be defined which was similar to SBMV-C ORF3.
