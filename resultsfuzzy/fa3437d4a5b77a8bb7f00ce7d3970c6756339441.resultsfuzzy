3.1. Synthesis and characterised of the imprinted polymers GL imprinted polymers were synthesized by using the non-covalent imprinting approach, because the rapid recognition kinetics, the simplicity of the process and because of the wide range of functional monomers which can be used (Mosbach, 2001) . When considering the chemical structure of template GL, it is clear that the functionalities suitable to interact with functional monomer are mainly the carboxylic ones. In literature, it is reported that these kinds of template can be successfully imprinted by using acidic, basic or neutral monomers (Beltran, Marc√©, Cormack, & Borrull, 2009 ). Thus, we performed a screening of the most commonly used functional monomer, and in particular MAA was chosen as acidic (MIP1 and NIP1), DMAEM as basic (MIP2 and NIP2) and HEMA as neutral (MIP3 and NIP3) functional monomer. All the polymeric matrices were prepared using the same molar ratio between template, functional monomer and crosslinker. In particular, a template/functional monomer ratio of 1/32 was chosen because GL is a high functionalized molecules with several groups able to form coordination interactions. The imprinting effect in the synthesized materials was evaluated by binding experiments in which amounts of polymeric particles were incubated with an GL solutions 0.2 mM for 24 h. These preliminary experiments were performed both in ethanol and in an ethanol:water mixture (6:4 v/v) to characterise the materials in eco-compatible environments. In addition, the same binding experiments were performed using GA, which differs from GL because of the absence of the two sugar moieties, in order to test the MIP selectivity (Fig. 1) . The results shown in Table 1 , clearly prove the efficiency of the prepared polymers in selectively recognise the template. The chemical and spatial complementarity of the imprinted cavities in the MIP structure, indeed, determines a higher value (%) of bound template by MIP comparing to NIP, as well as a stronger interaction with the template that with the analogue molecule. To better characterise the imprinting effect, the specific parameters, a and e, should be introduced ). a Value is determined as the ratio between the amount (%) of template bound by MIP and NIP and thus represents a quantitative determination of the presence of the imprinted cavities in the polymeric structure. e Value, which is a quantitative measure of the selectivity within the imprinted cavities, is calculated as the ratio between the amount (%) of GL and GA bound by MIP. For all the polymers, high a GL values were recorded in all the tested environments, proving the specificity of the interaction between the template and the functional groups on the polymeric microparticles. In addition, all the obtained e values are higher than 1.00, confirming that the imprinted cavities are characterised by stronger interaction with the template around which they are formed and lower affinity for its analogue. By comparing the three different polymers, it is clear that the presence of DMAEM as functional monomer carried out to higher non-specific interactions between analytes and polymeric matrices, as a result of the strong ionic interaction between amine functionality of DMAEM and carboxylic groups of GL and GA.The most efficient polymers were found to be MIP1 and MIP3, containing MAA and HEMA as functional monomer, respectively.
