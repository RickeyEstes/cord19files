One study staff nurse (EF) observed each injection for a number of parameters. Virtually no users requested to see the instructions for use or a demonstration of the product or practiced with the device beforehand. However, almost all were given verbal explanations regarding the function of each device. In this regard the exposure to the devices mimics that of a pandemic, where detailed training for all Fig. 3 . The means of dead-space volumes (n-40 per device) for the seven devices tested. Devices 1 and 2 had statistically significantly lower deadspace volumes than the other devices. users might be impossible. For all devices except number 2 almost no users required any additional training during the injection sequence. Almost a third of those using device 2 did require such training. Device 2 was the only device with a fixed dose feature (0.5 mL) and an automatic locking mechanism to prevent reuse (i.e. auto-disable syringe). It was the only device that appeared to be different from what the clinicians would normally use. For all devices except number 2 the clinicians used them correctly virtually all the time (>97.8%). For device 2 only 93.3% of users used it correctly, a difference that was statistically significant (p = 0.01). There was no statistical difference amongst devices regarding ease of use. There was no statistical difference amongst devices in the adequacy of training given; almost all clinicians felt it was adequate. There was a statistical difference amongst devices in ability to draw up using one's usual technique; device 2 accounted for this difference, as it required significant numbers of clinicians to change technique. There was a statistical difference amongst devices in terms of amount of time to draw up and administer an injection; devices 1 and 2 took less time to operate, while devices 3 and 7 took more.
