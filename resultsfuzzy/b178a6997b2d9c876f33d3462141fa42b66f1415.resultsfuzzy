This study used the normalized concentration (c) as the index to analyze the effects of different urban permeability and building geometries on air pollutant dispersion in the street canyon. This was given by: Where <c> is the modeling result of the time-averaged concentration of NO 2 and <c 0 > is the reference emission concentration, the norm of <c>. Given the definition of c, the threshold value of c was set to 1.0. When the value of c is less than 1.0, air pollutants start to disperse and do not concentrate in the street canyon. In addition to the analysis of contours of the normalized concentration, statistical studies were also conducted to evaluate the implied importance of design strategies for high-density urban areas, and to cast further light, if any, on the sustainable building design guidelines [26] . Furthermore, the discussion section was provided to further clarify the reasons of the observed dispersion phenomenon in scenarios with different urban permeability and building geometries. The above analysis clarified that, in general, the effects of building geometry on pollutant dispersion in street canyons are similar to the effects on pedestrian-level natural ventilation (which underlie the AVA guidelines). However, a significant difference should be emphasized: air pollutant dispersion significantly depends on the permeability of the entire street canyon layer. Interestingly, the incorporation of building porosity in Case 6, which had previously been shown as a poor mitigation strategy for improving the performance of pedestrian-level air ventilation [27] , can effectively improve air pollutant dispersion both horizontally and vertically. To further describe air pollutant dispersion in the street canyon and explain the cross-comparison results, the vertical distribution of the normalized concentration ðcÞ, turbulent intensity (I), and wind speed (U) at the vertical test line in the center of the building gap were plotted in Fig. 11 . The analysis indicated that turbulent diffusion played a major role in pollutant dispersion in cases with low permeability (Cases 1e3: P ¼ 0.9), and the pollutant dispersion significantly depends on convection effects in high permeability cases (Cases 4 to 6: P ¼ 0.7e 0.8). In Cases 1 to 3, the value of c in the street canyon displayed almost constant decreases with height. Regression analysis indicated that the vertical distribution of c in the low permeability cases (Case 1e3) significantly depended on the turbulent intensity (I) (R 2 ¼ 0.87), but no relationship between the normalized concentration and turbulent intensity (R 2 ¼ 0.11) was observed in high permeability cases (Case 4e6), as shown in Fig. 12 . In cases with higher permeability, building separation, stepped podium void, and building porosity all increased the effect of convection on pollutant dispersion. The normalized concentration did not depend on turbulent intensity, as shown in Fig. 12 , and did not constantly decrease with height. As shown in Fig. 11 , the normalized concentration rapidly decreased until the height of building permeability and then slowly developed to an asymptotic value. In Cases 5 and 6, even though wind speed and turbulence intensity largely decreased above the height of the building permeability, the normalized concentration remained at a low level because the building permeability let clean air flow horizontally into the street canyon, diluting and transporting air pollutant out of the street canyon. The building permeability in Case 4 was achieved by building separations that range from the ground level to the top of the building. Therefore, the strategy in Case 4 was better than in other cases. The building porosity in Case 6 provided more building permeability than Case 5, so that the pollutant dispersion in Case 6 was better than Case 5. Based on the above analysis, it was considered that, to lower air pollutant concentrations, strategies to promote convection effects, such as building porosity, separation and podium void, may be more efficient than the strategies for larger turbulent diffusion such as building setback. This finding is also explained the crosscomparison results in Sections 4.1 and 4.2. Furthermore, further examining the eight contours of the normalized concentration on the pedestrian level Fig. 7 indicated that, in high-density cities, the direction of dispersion of pedestrian-level air pollutants depends on both input wind direction and the urban permeability. In Cases 1e3 (P ¼ 0.9) with low permeability, pedestrian-level air flow was reversed, contrary to the input wind direction, so that air pollutant were transported upwind of the pollutant source. In contrast, in Cases 4e8 with high urban permeability (0.6 P 0.8), air pollutants were mainly dispersed downwind of the pollutant source. Therefore, unlike the understandings for low density cities, it is not dependable to estimate the direction of pollutant dispersion at the pedestrian-level in high-density cities solely based on the prevailing wind direction. For a reliable estimation, the urban permeability also needed to be taken into consideration.
