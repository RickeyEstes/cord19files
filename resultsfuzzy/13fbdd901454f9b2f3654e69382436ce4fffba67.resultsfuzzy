The error data also confirmed that influenza impaired search tasks but not those involving focused attention. Unfortunately, no further influenza trials were carried out at the Common Cold Unit. An attempt was, however, made to examine the mechanisms underlying the effects of influenza on performance and this study is described below. In influenza, interferon α can be found in the circulation and it is now clear that such peptide mediators have an effect on the CNS. It was, therefore, postulated that the performance deficits observed in influenza may be due to interferon or some similar molecule. This was tested by injecting volunteers with different doses of interferon α and it was predicted that those who attention tasks. received a dose which produced the symptoms of influenza would show comparable performance impairments. The results of this study are described in detail in Smith et al (1988c) and Smith et al (1991a) . The data from the simple reaction time task showed that an injection of 1.5 Mu produced an identical change to that seen in subjects with influenza. This is shown in Figure 7 .5. Subjects with colds were not impaired on the two detection tasks but they were worse at the tracking task than those who remained well. Separate analyses of the rhinovirus and Coronavirus groups showed similar effects, although the impairment on the tracking task was greater in those with rhinovirus colds. The rhinovirus group had greater nasal secretion than those challenged with the Coronavirus, and this suggested that there may be a direct link between the severity of the symptoms and the performance decrement. However, when correlations were calculated between objective measures of illness and performance (for subjects with significant colds only) no significant relationship was obtained. Smith et al (1988b) compared the effects of influenza with colds following challenge with respiratory syncytial virus. Again, the volunteers with colds showed a different pattern of impairment to those with influenza, and in the case of colds it was performance of the pegboard task which was impaired, not the search and memory task. This is shown in Figure 7 .7. Volunteers with colds also differed from those with influenza in that no impairments were observed during the incubation period and neither did volunteers with subclinical infections show significant changes. However, results from another study (Smith et al, 1987b ) did show that both those with colds and those with subclinical infections were slower than uninfected subjects on another task (the five-choice serial reaction time task) involving hand-eye co-ordination. These results are shown in Figure 7 the moment it is unclear why such after-effects occur. One possibility is that the performance tests are sensitive to the immunological changes that occur after symptoms have gone. Another possibility is that subjects continue to perform at a lower level because they 'learnt' the task when they were ill. Further experiments are required to resolve this issue. These initial studies showed that experimentally-induced colds impair tasks involving hand-eye co-ordination but have little effect on detection tasks. It is unclear which mechanisms underlie these effects. There is considerable evidence that certain types of virus (e.g. enteroviruses) have a strong affinity for muscle and may produce muscle damage. Recent evidence (Mier-Jedrzejowicz et al, 1988) confirms that upper respiratory tract infections can influence muscle function and this provides a plausible explanation for some of the effects on performance. Another possibility is that some other cytokine (e.g. interleukin 2) is involved. Indeed, it is well known that these mediators have an effect on the muscles which could account for the impaired hand-eye co-ordination. Alternatively, the impairments could be due to changes in sensory stimulation via the trigeminal nerves in the nose. Lastly, they could represent a 'distraction effect', produced by sneezing or other nasal irritations. The main difficulty for all these possible explanations is in accounting for why the effects are selective (observed in some tasks but not others). These selective effects were examined in further detail by considering the effects of colds on a range of memory tasks and also different aspects of vision. The following sections summarize these two topics. 


Section:effects of influenza a illnesses on the difference between search and focused performance is reported by smith et al. (1989). they examined the effects of influenza on two types of selective attention, one involving focused attention and the other categoric search. broadbent et al. (1989) have argued that the distinction between the two types of task is a fundamental one for models of selective attention. this view is supported by several pieces of evidence, one of which is that factors which change the state of the person have selective effects on measures from the two tasks. the results from the influenza study showed that performance of the search task was impaired by influenza but not performance on the focused attention task. the difference between reaction times for the two tasks is shown for subjects with and without influenza in
Section:smith et al. (1987a) examined the effects of colds produced by rhinoviruses and coronaviruses on the same three tests used in the influenza trials. these results are shown in
