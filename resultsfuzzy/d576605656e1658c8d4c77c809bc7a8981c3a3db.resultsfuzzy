The results of Granger causality tests in Table 1 show that market returns are affected by past movements of MATS returns in China; by SVS in India, Japan, and Malaysia; by FIN in South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand; by TECH in Malaysia; by HEA in Singapore and Taiwan; and by OIL in Thailand. We find a new trend that SVS leads market returns. We summarize the results of the Granger-causality test in Panel A of Table 2 , which shows that a leading relationship between industry and market returns varies across countries. The results demonstrate that the four hypotheses we intend to examine appear to co-exist in the selected eastern and southern Asia countries, possibly because of differences in country environments or government industry policies. Our results suggest that focusing attention only on a unidirectional relation from industry return to market return may be incomplete and thus does not present the whole picture on the nexus, particularly in a cross-country investigation. To check if the results above are robust, we use an alternative currency measure and control for the effect of trading activity. Panel B using local currency returns shows the findings on the industry leading hypothesis with US currency measure still hold in eight out of eleven industry-leading industries in the local currency. The difference is unavoidable, because the change in exchange rates across countries is different due to various trade conditions, and thus evaluating the return in a different currency base will cause differences. We concentrate on the results obtained using the US dollar return series for two reasons. First, a common currency across the ten sampling markets allows us to compare the results easily. Results in terms of US dollar measure are especially relevant to international investors (Chen, Firth, & Rui, 2002) . Second, when returns of indices are expressed in a local currency, part of the index' return volatility is induced by monetary phenomena such as changes in anticipated and actual inflation rates. Historically, inflation emerged as the biggest macroeconomic Table 1 Causality test results between market returns and industry returns (Eqs. (1) and (2) (1) and (2)). Notes: "→" means market returns Granger cause industry returns, supporting the market leading hypothesis. "←" means industry returns Granger cause market returns, supporting the industry leading hypothesis. "⇔" means market returns and industry returns Granger cause each other, supporting the feedback hypothesis.

N/A denotes data are not available. challenge confronting developing Asia during 2007-2008 (Jongwanich & Park, 2009) , leading results to interpretation problems in using returns denominated in the local currency. In Panel C of Table 2 , we control trading activity by including trading activity as an independent variable into the empirical model to evaluate its impact on industry-market returns, which is a manner commonly adopted in previous studies (i.e., Chen, Martin, & Wang, 2012; Wang, 2010) . The results in Panel C shows still hold in eight out of eleven industry-leading industries in controlling for trading activity, suggesting that trading activity does not substantially affect the industry leading relation here. In the past, nations use tariffs, exchange controls, quotas, restraints, and competitive devaluation of currencies, as instruments to control trading activity (MaPherson, 1995) . We attribute the difference results between US dollar and local currency measures for inflation and monetary policy, and the difference with and without controlling for trading activity for government's regulation to influence specific industry. Among the 11 industry returns, 10 show that market returns respond positively to a shock from industry returns and are significant up to day 2, but the shock dies out in the third day. Except for Japan's SVS having a negative impact on market returns in day 2. Within 15 industry returns that have bi-directional relationships with market returns, 7 have salient negative relationships with market returns in day 2. The responses of the stock market from shocks INDU in Japan seems to have the most impact over time. The most dramatic negative effect is the response of the stock markets to UTIL in HK, UTIL in Japan, and to HEA in Japan. This result is consistent with the idea that investors prefer investments in some fall-resistant stocks -that is, when the market goes down, the specific-industrial stock returns increase. 4 A one standard deviation shock to China's MATS (South Korea's FIN) raises the market returns by 0.23 or 0.24 points on the Chinese (South Korean) market returns in the first day. China's TELE and Thai's FIN follow thereafter. After 3 or 4 days, however, this impact quickly diminishes. Using monthly data, Hong et al. (2007) claim that stock markets react with a delay to information contained in industry returns. This study agrees with Wang et al. (2003) who disclose significant industry effects on returns in current mainstream industries. Whereas Wang et al. (2003) show that computer software, electronics, semiconductors, and wireless and telecommunications equipment were the mainstream sectors during 1990-2001, we find that SVS and FIN are the current mainstream industries, and IT has diminished its importance in explaining market returns, which is consistent with Tessitore and Usmen (2005) . We concur with Chen and De Bondt (2004) that styles perform variously over time. 3.5. The results of multiple structural breaks Hendry (1997) and Clements and Hendry (1999) argue that many major failures of economic forecasts are due to the presence of structural breaks, which are represented by parameter instability. Therefore, to check whether the above findings hold when potential structural breaks and different time spans are considered, we first examine the VAR system under multiple structural changes.

A possible reason is that the daily data frequency used in this study is not easy to present structural changes due to the short interval. Even so, changes still exist for some industries in some countries, including MATS, SVS, and TELE in China, MATS in Hong Kong, SVS and FIN in Japan, FIN and OIL in South Korea, and INDU and TECH in Malaysia. Among the above ten industries presenting structure changes, only three are market leading industries (MAT in China, SVS in Japan, and TECH in Malaysia) , signifying the relationships between the leading industry and market return are not affected by the structural break events. Most of the structure breaks that notably affect industries returns are: two coal mining disasters that happened on November 26, 2006 in China influence SVS in China, and MAT in China and Hong Kong; 5 the global financial crisis (2008) (2009) (2010) influences MAT, SVS, and TELE in China, MAT in Hong Kong, and FIN in South Korea; typhoons, floods, and mudslides (end-2003 to 2005) impact SVS and FIN in Japan; 6 South Korea was the largest coalition partner after the U.S. and UK in the Iraq War and deployed troops in August 2004, which resulted in an influence on OIL in South Korea; SARS (2002 SARS ( -2003 outbreak influences FIN in South Korea, and INDU and TECH in Malaysia 7 ; subprime crisis (July 2007) influences SVS and FIN in Japan, TELE and SVS in China, and OIL in South Korea; heavy rain showers hit Malaysia continuously every day for several weeks from November 2006, causing a series of flood to influence INDU and TECH in Malaysia. 8 We further estimate the coefficients under different regimes for these industries by employing Qu and Perron's (2007) procedure, as shown in Table 5 . 9 Distinct from other multiple structural breaks models, Qu and Perron's (2007) model can be applied to a system of equations, which allows us to consider the bi-directional relationships when examining the impact of industry returns on market returns. Based on the possible dates of structural changes, we divide the whole period into three subperiods. The results show that in different sub-periods the stock returns of some industries in some countries have divergent effects, i.e., positive and negative, on the market returns respectively. On the other hand, Japan's SVS and Malaysia's INDU are negatively impacted by the structural changes, while Japan's FIN and Malaysia's TECH are positively impacted by the structural changes. China's MATS, SVS, and TELE are negatively influenced by structure breaks in regime 3, rather than regime 1. Whether the condition is due to the gradual openness of China's economy awaits further research investigation. The returns in regime 3 in these industries have a negative impact on the nextday market return. Interestingly, this sub-period starts in the latter half of 2008, or about the time of further deterioration from the global financial crisis. The results have several implications for the investigation of stock market returns. The impact of industry returns on market returns varies in different periods, because of the emergence of unusual shocks or the phenomenon that some industries are influenced by business cycles. Hence, different conclusions may be achieved, suggesting that the occurrence of substantial shocks should be considered when exploring the effect of the return from certain industries on the market returns. The technique this article adopts of examining structural changes is a procedure that takes into account the property of data and endogenously determines multiple structural break points, thus providing objective results, which limit any discussion of prior works. Qu and Perron (2007) . Lagged market returns are omitted to save space. 3.6. Market predictability across the business cycle Jacobsen, Marshall, and Visaltanachoti (2011) find that Hong et al.'s (2007) findings are much stronger when accounting for sign-switching due to different sectors signaling good or bad news during contractions and expansions. To examine if the business cycle affects the prediction of the industry return for the market return, we take the business cycle into consideration. Following Jacobsen et al. (2011) , we estimate the following regression: where R t is the market return at time t, IND t−1 denotes the industry return at time t−1, and Expansion t−1 (Contraction t−1 ) is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the economy is expanding (contracting) and zero if it is contracting (expanding). We examine the effect of the business cycle utilizing the data of Japan and Taiwan because only datasets from these two countries are readily available for expansion and contraction periods. As Table 6 shows, the business cycle matters more for the leading relationship between industries and the market in Japan than in Taiwan. For Japan the returns of six out of ten industries significantly impacts the market returns in the contraction period, and HEA and UTIL are associated with the market both in the expansion and contraction periods. In Taiwan, in contrast, the change in the business cycle in general does not make a difference in the relationship between industries and the market. Japan and Taiwan are characterized, respectively, as the developed versus developing economy, and therefore our results imply that the degree of economic development could be a factor influencing the effect of the business cycle on the industry-market relationship. 10
