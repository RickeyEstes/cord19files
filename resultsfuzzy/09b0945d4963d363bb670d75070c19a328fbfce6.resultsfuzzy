In total, samples from 101 bats constituting five genera were tested for coronaviruses (Table 1 and  Table S1 ). Of these, two samples contained coronavirus RNA, originating from two individuals of the Rhinolophus genus. Barcoding and molecular identification confirmed the host species to be Rhinolophus clivosus (Table S1 ). Coronavirus sequences were extended to 820 bp with RGU assay primer sets [16] . The two sequences (Rh-BtCoV/441/Rwanda/08 and Rh-BtCoV/445/Rwanda/08) share 99.9% nucleotide identity; pairwise similarities and phylogenetic analysis group these sequences with other lineage B betacoronaviruses (Figure 2 ). The closest relative to the Rwandan betacoronavirus was reported from Kenya, BtCoVKY72 (Tao et al. unpublished; Genbank accession number KY352407.1), though the Rhinolophus species is not specified. The sequences share very close sequence similarities (95.5% nucleotide identity and 100% amino acid identity), suggesting that similar betacoronaviruses may be harbored by both Kenyan and Rwandan Rhinolophus bats. Full genome comparisons will be able to determine if Kenyan and Rwandan Rhinolophus bats are infected by the same betacoronavirus species. Within the analyzed conserved RdRp gene segment, this Rwandan Rhinolophus betacoronavirus also shares pairwise similarities of 88% nucleotide identity (98.9% amino acid identity) to the Bulgarian betacoronavirus Rh-BtCoV/BM48-31/BGR/08 [16] , as well as close similarities (86.1-86.4% nucleic acid similarity and 98.9-99.2% amino acid identity) to Asian Rhinolophus SARS-related coronaviruses such as SARSr-Rh-BtCoV/Rp3 and SARSr-Rh-BtCoVWIV16 [18, 49] . Other coronavirus surveillance in Rwanda, and surrounding countries such as Uganda and Tanzania also report SARS-related coronaviruses from the Rhinolophus genus [11] . Unfortunately, the sequences cannot be compared as an assay targeting a different conserved peptide of the RdRp gene was used [22] . Boldface indicates positive samples. Twenty-four samples from 23 bats were tested for paramyxovirus RNA (Table S1 ), none of which tested positive with the Avula-Rubulavirinae (AR) assay. An overall percentage positivity for paramyxovirus RNA, detected using the Respiro-Morbilli-Henipavirus (RMH) assay, was found to be 16.6% (n = 4). Three of the viral sequences were detected in the insectivorous bat species Hipposideros ruber and Otomops martiensseni, while one other sequence was detected in the frugivorous bat species Rousettus Twenty-four samples from 23 bats were tested for paramyxovirus RNA (Table S1 ), none of which tested positive with the Avula-Rubulavirinae (AR) assay. An overall percentage positivity for paramyxovirus RNA, detected using the Respiro-Morbilli-Henipavirus (RMH) assay, was found to be 16.6% (n = 4). Three of the viral sequences were detected in the insectivorous bat species Hipposideros ruber and Otomops martiensseni, while one other sequence was detected in the frugivorous bat species Rousettus aegyptiacus. Host identification of positive samples was confirmed using molecular analysis (Table S1 ). Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences indicated that the insectivorous bat-borne viral sequences grouped with the Jeilongvirus genus as well as in a Jeilongvirus-related clade (Figure 3 ). One of the H. ruber sequences (BatPV/Hip_rub/UP401 /RWA/2008) described from this study potentially groups within the Jeilongvirus genus. The second H. ruber-derived viral sequence (BatPV/Hip_rub/UP450/RWA/2008) grouped with a paramyxoviral sequence detected in a bat from the same genus sampled in Cameroon in 2010, however, was not identical. The detection of two diverse viruses from bats of the same species and same population has previously also been reported in insectivorous bats sampled in other African countries [36] . These observations can in part be explained by the generation of viral quasi-species populations due to the high mutation rate of RNA viruses as a consequence of RNA proofreading deficiency of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase [50] . A larger pool of diverse viruses within a bat population and the co-roosting of several cave-dwelling bat species may facilitate viral sharing between different bat species [51] . However, ongoing biosurveillance in these cave-dwelling bat species will be required before active viral sharing can be shown. The paramyxoviral sequence detected in the O. martiensseni bat (BatPV/Oto_mar/UP535/RWA/2008) was near identical to the viral sequences previously described from several individuals of the same species sampled in Kenya in 2011 [36] . These sequences shared a 99.3% similarity on both nucleotide and amino acid level. The R. aegyptiacus-derived viral sequence (BatPV/Rou_aeg/UP438/RWA/2008) grouped within a Henipavirus-related clade and was near identical to a paramyxoviral sequence detected in the same host species previously reported from Kenya [36] . Sequence similarity shared between these two sequences was found to be 98.1% and 98.7% on nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively. To our knowledge, this study reports on the first evidence of paramyxovirus RNA in bats from Rwanda. Two of the four viral sequences detected in H. ruber, were not closely related to the paramyxovirus sequences previously reported (sharing nucleotide and amino acid similarities of less than 80% and 83.5%, respectively) and might represent novel viral species. However, a more rigorous analysis with variable genes such as the fusion and hemagglutinin gene will be required before putative species can be inferred. As observed in previous studies, viral sequences from frugivorous bats were mostly found to belong to the Henipavirus genus or a related clade, while insectivorous bat-associated viral sequences have been linked to other genera including Morbilliand Jeilongvirus [36] . This observation was again reflected in the current study. The detection of highly similar viral sequences from bats in Rwanda and Kenya, which are more than 1000 km apart, can be explained by either the phenomena of metapopulations or the hypothesis of co-evolution of paramyxoviruses with their bat hosts [3, 52, 53] . RNA viruses have an exceptionally high mutation rate commonly associated with quasi-species populations and with the potential to cross the species barrier, among others. This is evident in the high diversity of paramyxoviruses described to date and the wide host range associated with these viruses [3, 28, 36, 54] . Additionally, due to the emergence of SARS, MERS and SADS, it is widely accepted that coronaviruses are capable of readily adapting to new hosts [5] . The Rwandan caves are considered an ecotourism site and guano is also mined on a small scale, providing an ideal bat-human interface. Several insectivorous bat species co-roost with the Egyptian fruit bats in these caves and future studies should investigate viral sharing. The Egyptian fruit bat also uses these caves as a maternity roost and studies have shown that increased viral shedding is linked to reproductive cycles [37] . Longitudinal biosurveillance studies can therefore identify high risk periods in the future. As such, the detection of a SARS-related bat coronavirus potentially circulating within the Rhinolophus population and a Henipavirus-related paramyxovirus in R. aegyptiacus in the Ruhengeri region may merit further investigation to determine exposure, and the potential for spill-over events to occur. To date, emphasis of paramyxovirus surveillance has mostly been placed on fruit bats, the Henipavirus genus and related viruses due to the association of other henipavirus species with zoonotic events [30, 31] . However, research regarding the zoonotic potential of the insectivorous bat-associated viruses is still lacking. One major aim regarding surveillance of wildlife populations is to identify potential zoonotic agents and to evaluate any threat to the public as well as domestic animal health. Though these bat-borne viruses are unlikely to pose a significant threat, it still merits continued monitoring of the chiropteran species within these caves as well as mammalian species that inhabit the surrounding area. 2010, however, was not identical. The detection of two diverse viruses from bats of the same species and same population has previously also been reported in insectivorous bats sampled in other African countries [36] . These observations can in part be explained by the generation of viral quasi-species populations due to the high mutation rate of RNA viruses as a consequence of RNA proofreading deficiency of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase [50] . A larger pool of diverse viruses within a bat population and the coroosting of several cave-dwelling bat species may facilitate viral sharing between different bat species [51] . However, ongoing biosurveillance in these cave-dwelling bat species will be required before active viral sharing can be shown. The paramyxoviral sequence detected in the O. martiensseni bat (BatPV/Oto_mar/UP535/RWA/2008) was near identical to the viral sequences previously described from several individuals of the same species sampled in Kenya in 2011 [36] . These sequences shared a 99.3% similarity on both nucleotide and amino acid level. The R. aegyptiacus-derived viral sequence (BatPV/Rou_aeg/UP438/RWA/2008) grouped within a Henipavirus-related clade and was near identical to a paramyxoviral sequence detected in the same host species previously reported from Kenya [36] . Sequence similarity shared between these two sequences was found to be 98.1% and 98.7% on nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively. For countries where the bat-human interface is more pronounced, as a result of ecotourism, guano mining or bat hunting and consumption, surveillance is key to identify the diversity of viruses present and their potential host species. Longitudinal and well-structured surveillance programmes would better characterize the circulation and shedding periods of the paramyxo-and betacoronaviruses within the Ruhengeri cave system. Such information would be most valuable towards well-considered zoonotic disease risk assessments and mitigation strategies.
