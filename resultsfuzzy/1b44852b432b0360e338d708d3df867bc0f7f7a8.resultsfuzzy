To better illustrate this work, we collected data of two representative diseases, H7N9 and Dengue fever. Each disease has two time series datasets: (i) daily number of individuals infected by the corresponding disease in China, which are collected from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention ; (ii) online diffusion messages discussing or forwarding the information of the corresponding disease during the same period of epidemic spreading. The message diffusion data was crawled from the largest micro-blogging system in China [56] , Sina Weibo ( http://www.weibo.com/ ). We have essentially obtained one-year data for the disease H7N9 from the year 2013 to 2014, and two-year data for Dengue from the year 2012 to 2014. We assume that individuals who post or retweet messages about the observed diseases are considered to be aware of the disease. Empirical analysis of H7N9: Fig. 1 (a) shows the spreading processes of both disease and disease information of H7N9 . It can be seen that the evolutionary trend of two processes are highly correlated, with Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.49. When the epidemic broke out in Apr. 2013 and Feb. 2014 ( Fig. 1 (a) ), it shows that many people were discussing it online simultaneously. Actually, public responses to H7N9, such as staying at home or wearing face masks, can also affect the spread of the epidemic. The peaks of the disease spreading and the information diffusion shown in Fig. 1 (a) suggest that the mutual influence of these two spreading processes could be significant. Interestingly, the size of the first epidemic peak (Apr. 2013) is smaller than the second one (Feb. 2014), which is inversely correlated with the information amount. That is to say, the number of individuals discussing the disease during the first outbreak is much greater than that of the second one. This might imply that the awareness of epidemics and the physical epidemics could influence each other. Empirical analysis of Dengue fever: Fig. 1 (b) describes the spreading processes of both disease and disease information of Dengue. Similar to the analysis of H7N9, the evolution trend of the two processes is also consistent with each other, with even much higher correlation coefficient of 0.89. According to the two largest peaks (in Sept. 2012 and Sept. 2013, respectively) of disease spreading, we find that the first epidemic peak is also smaller than the second one, while the corresponding information peaks show a contrary trend. Considering the two small peaks of information in Fig. 1 (b1) and (b2), we can also find the same relationship between the the two dynamic processes as that of two largest peaks, suggesting also the possible coupling effect of the awareness of epidemics and the infected cases of dengue.
