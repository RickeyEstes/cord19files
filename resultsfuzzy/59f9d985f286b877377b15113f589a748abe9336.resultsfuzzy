There is an increasing interest in using oral fluid to determine herd health and documenting the circulation of viruses in commercial swine populations (Ramirez et al., 2012) but little is known about the stability of viruses in oral fluid. The few studies investigating the stability of RNA in oral fluid are related primarily to human mRNA as biomarkers of disease (Fábryová and Celec, 2013) . Viral RNA can be present in oral fluid as intact RNA protected by the protein coat of the virus or accessible to RNases in the form of free RNA or associated with damaged virus particles (Roy et al., 1999) . The aim of the study was to evaluate different handling procedures to minimize the deterioration of viruses and viral RNA present in the oral fluid. Oral fluid contains degradative enzymes and some studies have suggested that a heat treatment may inactivate salivary enzymes and prevent degradation of viral RNA (Roy et al., 1999) . Gomes-Kellar et al. (2006) incubated feline saliva samples at 42 • C for 10 min before extracting nucleic acids and reported that there was good agreement with the detection of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) in saliva and plasma but average Ct values were 1.5 units higher in saliva. The effect of heat treatment on the performance of the assays was not investigated in that study but the initial levels of FeLV were fairly high in such samples, where mean Ct values were below 20. Roy et al. (1999) concluded that a heat treatment of 15 min at 60 • C prior to storage at −20 • C for 30 days did not prevent the degradation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in whole saliva and oral fluid samples during frozen storage but the effect of a heat treatment alone on the detection of HCV in those samples was not reported. Preliminary studies with oral fluid inoculated with low levels of HEV derived from a clarified fecal HEV suspension (5 × 10 3 gc/ml of oral fluid) indicated that a heat treatment of 60 • C for 15 min was detrimental to HEV RNA (data not shown). While HEV was detected in 10/10 samples incubated at 4 • C for 1 h and 18 h and in 3/10 samples stored at −20 • C for 30 days, HEV was not detected in any of the samples that were heated for 15 min at 60 • C or heat treated and then stored at −20 • C for 30 days (data not shown). Based on those preliminary findings, the effect of heat treatment as a means of inactivating degradative enzymes was not investigated in subsequent trials. Alternative methods to minimize or prevent the degradation of RNA in oral fluid include the addition of RNAse inhibitors and RNA stabilizers (Fábryová and Celec, 2013) . Park et al. (2006) demonstrated that the RNA protect Saliva Reagent, included as part of the RNeasy Protect Saliva Mini kit (Qiagen), was significantly better than RNAlater or Superase Inhibitor in protecting salivary ␤-actin mRNA from degradation during storage at room temperature for 7 days, although the difference between RNA protect Saliva Reagent and Superase Inhibitor after 3 and 7 days of incubation was <1.3 Ct units. RNAprotect Saliva Reagent can stabilize mRNA in saliva for up to 12 weeks, which permits the collection and transport of saliva samples at ambient temperatures and facilitates screening and diagnostics on a global level (Park et al., 2006) . There is no peer-reviewed information about the stability of viral RNA with the RNeasy Protect Saliva Mini kit, therefore the recovery of viral RNA stored at 4 • C or −20 • C and extracted with the QiaAMP Viral RNA Mini kit was compared with RNA stabilized at 37 • C or −20 • C and extracted with the RNeasy Protect Saliva Mini kit. The experimental conditions are representative of compatible storage conditions identified by the manufacturer. The recovery of HEV RNA without a stabilizing reagent was significantly greater than when RNA was stabilized with RNAprotect Saliva Reagent (Table 2) . HEV was recovered from 25/25 and 24/25 samples of oral fluid when samples were incubated for ≤24 h at 4 • C and 30 days at −20 • C, respectively, without a stabilizing agent and extracted with the QiaAMP kit. In contrast, HEV RNA was detected in 16/25 and 11/25 samples when samples were incubated with a stabilizing agent for 24 h at 37 • C and 30 d at −20 • C, respectively, and extracted with the RNeasy Protect Saliva kit. Moreover, the mean number of gc/ml of HEV recovered from oral fluid stored at −20 • C without the stabilizing agent was 2.9 log units higher than oral fluid stored at −20 • C in the presence of the stabilizing agent. In all instances, the log number of gc recovered from each individual sample stored at −20 • C was higher in the absence of the stabilizing agent ( Table 2 ). The level of HEV inoculated into the oral fluid was >2 log units above the limit of detection. HEV is extremely difficult to cultivate by cell culture (Berto et al., 2013) . Therefore the source of HEV in this study was derived from a swine fecal sample that was positive for HEV by qRT-PCR. Other possible sources of HEV include serum or lymphnodes of infected animals, which were not available to the researchers. The fecal sample was diluted in PBS and clarified by centrifugation, a procedure used commonly for the detection of HEV by real time RT-PCR (Jones and Johns, 2012; Leblanc et al., 2007) . One of the drawbacks of using fecal extracts is that fecal material contains inhibitors that may affect the PCR assay. The concentration of inhibitors originating from the fecal extract are diluted in the inoculated oral fluid where each sample of inoculated oral fluid contains approximately 3.3% of orginal fecal material, which may be realistic and comparable to the presence of background fecal material naturally present in oral fluid of pigs due to environmental contamination. Detecting viral RNA in oral fluid from pigs is complex. In addition to PCR inhibitors present in oral fluid itself, concerns have been raised about additional PCR inhibitors from fecal material and other environmental contaminants in oral fluid (Chittick et al., 2011) . Chittick et al. (2011) reported that the interference of PCR inhibitors in oral Table 2 Recovery (log genome copies) of hepatitis E virus/ml of inoculated oral fluid after incubation at 37 • C, 4 • C, or −20 • C and extracted with the QIAamp Viral RNA or RNeasy Protect Saliva Mini kit.
