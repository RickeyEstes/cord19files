In this study we amplified and sequenced the IL17A gene for four leporids species (European rabbit, European brown hare, brush rabbit, and pygmy rabbit). For European rabbit (O. c. cuniculus) and European brown hare, both genomic and cDNA sequences were identical and only one of the sequences is presented; however both sequences have been assigned different accession numbers. These sequences were further compared to sequences of IL17A from another lagomorph, American pika (Ochotona princeps), and from representatives of the most relevant mammalian groups (e.g., Artiodactyla, carnivores, Chiroptera, Primates, rodents, etc.) available in online databases. In the European rabbit, IL17A is located in the forward strand of chromosome 12 and has a similar structure to other mammals with three coding exons. The IL17A cDNA sequence obtained in this work for Lepus europaeus showed a similar structure. In humans, IL17A codes for a protein with 155 amino acids (aa) and has the ability to bind with high affinity to IL17RA and IL17RC [6, 45, 46] . The interaction between interleukins and their receptors is crucial for their function and signaling and any changes in the amino acid composition may induce alterations in the protein conformation. In humans and rodents these interactions sites are described [6, 45] and include Leu52, Ile54, Ser61, Ser70-Tyr72, Arg75, Arg84, Arg88-Val94, Trp96, Leu103, His114, His115, Asn117, Positively selected amino acids are boxed (according to [19] ).

Disulfide bonds between side chain cysteines are represented by a light grey dashed line. Ser118, Gln122-Glu124, Leu128, Arg130, Phe139, and Pro155-Met160 (Figure 1 ). In leporids, IL17A codes for a protein with 153 aa and we observed that the sites that likely interact with the receptors are quite conserved. Indeed, from the thirtythree amino acids involved in the linkage between IL17A and IL17RA, eighteen are conserved: twelve are maintained between mammals and the other six, despite being different, do not alter the charge or the polarity. For the remaining fifteen amino acids, only three are differently charged, seven have distinct polarity, and five have both different charge and polarity (Table 1) . Between leporids these sites are highly conserved, but a mutation was observed that is located in the external coil of the IL17A in a site where this protein interacts with IL17RA ( Figure 2 ). This mutation, 88Arg>Pro, occurs in the European rabbit and in the European brown hare, while in brush rabbit and the American pika the amino acid present is a proline as in most mammals. Some studies showed that Arg>Pro mutations have crucial effects in the  The amino acid polarity ( * hydrophilic; # hydrophobic) and charge ( + positive; − negative) are properly annotated.

Indeed, the 332Arg>Pro mutation in human Trim5 restricts infection by HIV-1 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1) [49] while the 132Arg>Pro mutation in the helicase protein of coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus was lethal to infectivity in vitro [48] . Additionally, this mutation alters the physiochemical properties of the amino acid by changing from a basic polar and positively charged arginine to a nonpolar and neutral proline. Disulfide bounds and N-glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr/Cys motifs where X can be any amino acid except proline) are important for the protein structure, stability, and function [50] [51] [52] . Disulphide bounds occur between cysteines side chains and these linkages are also important for protein protection [53] . In human and rodents, IL17A has a cysteine knot fold characterized by two sets of pairedstrands (1/2 and 3/4) interconnected by two disulfide bounds between strands 2 and 4 linked between four conserved cysteines (Cys100-Cys150 and Cys105-Cys152) [45, 54, 55] . In addition to these cysteines two other cysteines are common to all mammals, Cys36 and Cys135. For the European rabbit, the PsiPred predicted secondary structure and the DiANNA predicted disulfide bonds results are in agreement with those obtained and described for human and rodents [45, 54] . An extra linkage is also predicted between Cys31 and Cys135. When compared to other mammals, there is an extra cysteine (Cys19) in leporids located in the signal peptide. The rat and Mediators of Inflammation 5 the European hedgehog also have an extra cysteine located in different sites of the signal peptide (Cys11 and Cys3, resp.). Given that the signal peptide is cleaved in order for the protein to become active, this extra cysteine should not have an impact on the IL17A structure. N-glycosylation is a crucial factor for the modulation of protein activity; therefore, alteration on these sites may interfere with recognition of targets, including receptors, and consequently affects the biological activity of the proteins and also their ability to diffuse through the organism [56, 57] . Human IL17A is N-glycosylated at Asn68. Detection of putative N-glycosylation sites indicated that this N-glycosylation site is present in the majority of mammals, including rodents and lagomorphs. Other putative N-glycosylation sites were detected and include Asn56 in lagomorphs, pig, and cattle, Asn51 in American pika and armadillo, and Asn49 in the lesser hedgehog tenrec. The killer whale and the African bush elephant have no putative N-glycosylation sites. The implications of the absence/presence of N-glycosylation sites in IL17A are unknown; however some studies indicate that presence/removal of glycans in some proteins do not alter their folding or function, although a decrease in the protein dynamics is observed [50, 52, 57] . Comparison of the nucleotide sequences (Table 2) indicated that, in leporids, the European rabbit and the European brown hare IL17A sequences are the least divergent (0.011) while the European rabbit and the pygmy rabbit IL17 sequences are the most divergent (0.026). Between the European rabbit and American pika, the genetic diversity obtained was 0.112-0.115. For the remaining mammals the highest divergence occurs for the lesser hedgehog tenrec (0.312) and the lowest divergence for the flying lemur (0.145). The comparison of the nucleotide diversity of several interleukins in the European rabbit suggested that it could represent a better animal model for research [34] . For IL17A, similar results were obtained, with the human sequence being more closely related to the European rabbit (0.169) than to mouse or rat IL17A sequences (0.236). This is further supported by a Maximum Likelihood tree inferred for IL17A mammalian sequences ( Figure 3 ).
