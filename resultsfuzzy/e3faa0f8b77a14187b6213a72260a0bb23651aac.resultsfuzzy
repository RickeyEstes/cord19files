Japanese are the biggest group of inbound tourists to Taiwan, accounting for approximately 30% of all tourists. During the SARS outbreak, inbound tourists from Japan accounted for only 21.36% of total inbound tourists in Taiwan. This suggests that Japanese tourists tend to evade risks when choosing travel destinations in order to avoid uncertainty. Due to the importance of Japanese tourists for the Taiwanese tourism market, this paper analyzes Japanese tourists. Fig. 2 shows the changes in the number of Japanese tourists visiting Taiwan. The number of Japanese tourists coming to Taiwan has steadily increased with the increase in the national income of Japan. The number of Japanese tourists arriving in Taiwan had an upward trend, except during the four aforementioned major disasters. In general, as soon as a disaster strikes, tourism demand falls for months; however, demand for the month of the disaster may not experience a slump, especially if the disaster strikes towards the end of the month, since the negative impact of the disaster will be diluted by the monthly average. From 1996 to 2006, Taiwan's tourism industry experienced four destructive disasters. Fig. 2 indicates that the industry suffered the greatest decrease in 2003. The first disaster was the Asian financial crisis in 1997. The purchasing power of the private-sector dropped, and as a result, the willingness to travel declined. The second disaster was the earthquake on 21st September 1999. Figures provided by the National Management Institution show that the earthquake claimed more than 2400 lives, resulted in over 13,000 casualties, and made more than 10,000 people homeless. In central Taiwan, many public tourism facilities were seriously damaged. Private-sector tourism suffered losses totaling approximately US$123.3 billion. The national scenic areas reported losses of about US$20 million. The Sun Moon Lake, an internationally renowned tourist destination, was devastated. The number of inbound tourists drastically decreased after press reports. The Tourism Bureau of the ROC initiated a campaign with a theme of carefree traveling in Taiwan to attract foreign tourists, in order to counter the impact of negative news reports. A series of events, including the Taipei International Travel Fair, were organized to revive the tourism industry in Taiwan. The third disaster was the terrorism attack in the US on 11th September 2001. The tourism industry suffered the most from this catastropy. Many American airlines announced their plans to lay off pilots and other employees. Taiwan also saw a setback in tourism demand as the global tourism market was badly hit with a decline in the willingness to travel by air. After confirmation that Taiwan was not a priority target of terrorist attacks, traveling to Taipei was perceived as less dangerous. In addition, the Doubling Tourist Arrivals Plan, launched by the Taiwanese government in 2002, has resulted in a marked increase in the number of inbound tourists and tourism-related income. The fourth disaster was the SARS outbreak in 2003. The outbreak was a sudden blow to the tourism industry in Taiwan, and brought the number of inbound tourist arrivals to a record low. The SARS outbreak was the worst epidemic in Taiwan in the past five decades. From the discovery of the first SARS patient on 14 March 2003, to the removal of Taiwan from the list of SARS-infected zones by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 5 July 2003, a total of 664 SARS cases were reported and 73 people died over a period of nearly four months. During the outbreak, the Taiwanese government announced that SARS was listed as a Type 4 Legal Infectious Disease. The WHO advised against traveling to Taiwan, as Taiwan was one of the main SARS-infected locations. The tourists who had originally planned to travel to Taiwan were taken aback, and either cancelled or changed their plans to visit Taiwan as the media reports focused on the Asian regions hit by SARS. Since Taiwan was removed from the list of SARS-infected areas, the government developed initiatives to target overseas travel industries in order to restore their confidence in Taiwan. These measures included promotion of the safety of traveling to Taiwan, invitations to travel agents and intermediaries to investigate the safety of traveling to Taiwan, and arrangements to offer travel packages by working with travel agencies to attract visitors. Meanwhile, the government launched the Doubling Tourist Arrivals Plan, and as a result, the number of inbound tourists exceeded 3 million for the first time in 2005. The foreign currency income created by the tourism industry reached US$4.977 billion. These figures indicate that the government's Post-SARS Tourism Recovery Plans were successful. These proactive measures to promote tourism to international communities are valuable experiences in crisis management in the face of major disasters. Table 2 summarizes the estimates made by applying the bound tests developed by Pesaran et al. (2001) . There are co-movements in the tourism demand model, indicating that there is a long-term equilibrium between the number of inbound tourist arrivals, income, relative prices, exchange rates, and oil prices. Over the long-run, all variables become interconnected. The coefficient of the error correction item is Ã€0.53, indicating a negative and rapid adjustment from a short-term imbalance. This implies that the imbalance of inbound tourist arrivals from the previous period may be adjusted during this period with error corrections that resume the long-term equilibrium. This indicates that long-term relationships are valid. National income is an indicator for the ability of Japanese to travel. The test results show that income during a period is the most significant influencing factor for Japanese coming to Taiwan for sightseeing. The coefficient is greater than 1, indicating that sightseeing products are luxuries. The citizens of Japan have enjoyed a steady increase in Japan's GDP, creating more wealth, which has led to an increased emphasis on the quality of leisure and traveling. As the Japanese are the largest customers for Taiwanese tourism, Taiwan should establish well-planned and attractive sightseeing facilities in order to attract more Japanese tourists. Also, any shock to the currency exchange rates between the two countries can cause sudden changes in consumer prices for tourists, and will naturally affect the willingness of tourists to travel to Taiwan. The exchange rate for a period is the second most significant influencing factor for the inbound tourism model. Exchange rate fluctuations affect the willingness of Japanese to travel overseas. Depreciation of the Japanese yen reduces the number of Japanese tourists, whereas appreciation of the Japanese yen reduces the travel costs for Japanese tourists coming to Taiwan, increases their travel demand, and in turn, increases the number of Japanese tourists arriving in Taiwan. Most of the transportation cost variables are statistically significant, and all of the coefficients are negative. This indicates that an increase in oil prices directly affects the travel costs of tourists, and as a result, they are less willing to come to Taiwan for sightseeing. It is suggested that weekly passes or discounts for the high speed rail should be offered to overseas tourists. Alternatively, flights between Taipei and Kaohsiung should be bundled with discount tour packages, to partly make up for the rising travel costs of air tickets. In addition, lag variables can measure gradual changes over time. The value of the lagging period for the number of inbound tourists from Japan indicates the number of inbound tourists from Japan during previous periods (quarters). Aside from the slightly negative value of the first lagging period, all of the other values are positive. This implies that Japanese tourists are highly loyal to Taiwan, and that word of mouth recommendations have a considerable influence on the preferences of other Japanese tourists to visit Taiwan. The short-term effect of the number of inbound tourists on itself is negative during the first lagging period (quarter). In the fourth lagging period (approximately one year), the effect on the number inbound tourists for a period is significant and positive, with a 5% significance level. The effect on the subsequent lagging period is negative. This implies that, during a fixed period of time (about half a year), the total number of inbound tourists should be constant. If the number of inbound tourists for a previous quarter is too high, it will impact the interest in inbound tourism for the quarter, as evidenced by a lower number of inbound tourists. Therefore, to attract more Japanese tourists to Taiwan, it is necessary for travel products and tourism service industries to improve their service quality. Tourists prefer sightseeing destinations where they feel safe. In reference to the quality of travel, tourists may ask the opinions of others who have been to the same places when deciding on a travel destination. Tourism demand is stimulated by both 'word of mouth' from friends and family, and by active promotions and marketing strategies by the tourism industry. The relative price index indicates travel costs. The coefficient of relative prices for the period is negative, but not statistically significant in reference to its influence on the number of tourists. This indicates that, given the same income levels, the rise in prices in Taiwan will reduce the purchasing power of inbound tourists. The increase in travel costs for foreigners coming to Taiwan will lower their sightseeing interest and, as a result, the number of inbound tourists to Taiwan will drop, and tourism revenues and related industries will suffer. On the other hand, if prices drop, the willingness of inbound and outbound tourists to travel increases. More tourists will spend money on accommodations, food, and beverages. In contrast to the usual scenarios, the influence of price changes on the coefficient of lag periods is always positive. In other words, when the relative cost of traveling from Taiwan to Japan increases, it does not affect the Japanese' willingness to come to Taiwan. This may seem counter-intuitive, but it is logical once the situations of both countries are considered. Japan and Taiwan are geographically close, and it is very convenient for Japanese to visit Taiwan for sightseeing. Moreover, the prices in Taiwan are lower than those in Japan. When the relative prices go up, coming to Taiwan remains an economical choice for Japanese. The market is only subject to the influence of price hikes by domestic hotels in Taiwan for that quarter, as evidenced by the decline in the number of visitors. This is a short-term effect in terms of its influence on the willingness of certain inbound tourists. The selection criteria that people use for tourist products are not necessarily centered on prices, since these products are not necessities, and there are a number of substitutes. The characteristics of the products and the preferences of the consumers have a critical influence on these selections. Overall, the influence of relative prices is variable, and depends on the travel purpose and mode. A vast majority of Japanese tourists are insensitive to price increases in Taiwan, as they come to Taiwan for business. As for those who come to Taiwan for sightseeing, they usually come as tourist groups and are backed by travel agencies with bargaining powers. Therefore, they are not sensitive to the relative prices of the destination country (Taiwan, in this case). The price hikes in Taiwan affect the interests of Japanese travelers coming to Taiwan; however, the tourism industry has adopted a low-price promotion policy in their itineraries to stimulate the interest of Japanese tourists to come to Taiwan. Since Japan is a high-income country, with high prices and consumption, coming to Taiwan for sightseeing remains a good deal, as the prices in Taiwan are approximately one-third of those in Japan. In addition, over 50% of the travel expenses borne by Japanese tourists are their airplane tickets, which are not reflected in CPI. Martin and Witt (1987) attempted to establish a tourist price index, but the outcome was below expectations. The coefficients of major disasters are negative, and except for D97, they are all statistically significant. The coefficient of D03 is the greatest coefficient, as Taiwan and Taipei were primary SARSinfected areas, and therein, were greatly impacted. This disaster had the largest impact, since Taipei is one of the primary destinations for Japanese tourists, and SARS is a highly contagious disease. The September 21 earthquake had the second largest impact, since many tourist spots were destroyed and tourists were worried about aftershocks. The third greatest influencing factor was the September 11 attack, as the associated airline disasters made travelers question the safety of air travel. Finally, the influence of the Asian financial crisis was the smallest, as it did not raise concerns over the safety of travel. This minimal effect is reflected in the fact that the 1997 dummy variable was insignificant. In general, most countries would benefit from a steady increase in the number of inbound tourist arrivals. The Asian financial crisis was different from the other events in terms of the nature of the demand shock. The Asian financial crisis was an economic event, whereas the other three were related to safety (natural disasters, disease and terrorist attacks).
