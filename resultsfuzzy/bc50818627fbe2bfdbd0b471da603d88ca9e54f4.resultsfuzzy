A total of 200 bat guano samples were collected from three sites: Kepterkhan tunnel (n = 101), Qaraungir cave (n = 50), and Ungirli cave (n = 49). Each cave was occupied by two bat species, the dominant species being Myotis blythii (lesser mouse-eared bat) and the more infrequent species being Hypsugo savii (Savi's pipistrelle). Overall, 25 (12.5%) of all guano samples screened were positive for coronaviruses: Qaraungir cave with the highest percent positive (24%) and Kepterkham tunnel with the lowest (6.9%) ( Table 1) . Sequence data were successfully generated for 12 of the 25 PCR positive samples. Our RdRp phylogeny demonstrates that all 12 new CoV sequences (GenBank Accession MK603150-MK603161) from Kazakhstan bats belong to the genus Alpha-CoV (Figure 2 ; Figure S1 , Supplementary Materials). The Alpha-CoV genus comprises a large number of coronaviruses from diverse hosts, including bats, shrews, dogs, cats, ferrets, pigs, and humans. In Kazakhstan bats, the new CoV sequences were found to be segregated into two different groups. The majority (11 sequences) of the Kazakhstan CoVs formed a strongly monophyletic single clade (bootstrap (BS) = 95%), referred to here as "KZ3", with the nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 94.7% to 100%. The KZ3 clade was a sister group to three bat CoV sequences from Spain (Miniopterus schreibersii and Myotis blythii) and China (Myotis ricketti). Within the KZ3 clade, two smaller co-circulating lineages (KZ-3a and KZ-3b) were formed that are also strongly monophyletic (BS = 82% and 98%, respectively). The KZ-3b sub-lineage contained seven bat sequences (RIBSP-7, 1, 13, 18, 62, 65, and 66) with 100% nucleotide similarity; however, the samples were collected from two different sites. Bat KZ-3b sequences (RIBSP-7, 11, 13, and 18) were collected from the Qaraungir cave, whereas bat KZ-3b sequences (RIBSP-62, 65, and 66) were collected from the Altyntau cave. This suggests the Kazakhstan bats residing in two different caves appear to harbor highly similar CoV strains. The KZ43 group contains only one Kazakhstan sequence (RIBSP-43) from the Altyntau cave, which is markedly divergent (nucleotide identities: 70.2-72.9%) from the KZ3 sequences. The RIBSP-43 sequence is most closely related with Pipistrellus pipistrellus CoV (nucleotide identity: 88.1%) described from France in 2014. These sequences in turn grouped with diverse bat species from broad geographical regions including Spain (Nyctalus lasiopterus and Myotis myotis), China (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), and South Africa (Neoromicia cf capensis). Taken together, our results indicate that Kazakhstan bats may harbor a wider diversity of Alpha CoV, possibly by means of the regional and intercontinental spread of the virus. Although the pooled feces prevented attribution to a singular species, the two lineages of Alpha CoV may be derived from the different species of bats, Myotis blythii and Hypsugo savii. KZ3 is similar to Myotis coronavirus sequences, while the KZ43 is most similar to a Pipistrellus sequence and H. savii is a pipistrelle bat. Our approach was opportunistic sampling in three sites, and the total sample size was 200, limiting the conclusions we can make about bat-borne coronaviruses in central Asia; however, this study provides a baseline for future studies. Intense coronavirus surveillance is ongoing in China since the SARS-CoV outbreak, and it was demonstrated that co-roosting can maintain all strains with the necessary components to make SARS [10] . There is a paucity of bat-borne virus surveillance efforts across central Asia, even though this region is one of the largest grassland biomes in the world. This area is also of interest because it is where the Eurasian and Asian bat populations may be panmictic, as seen in other bat species with large distributions [21, 22] . The range of M. blythii and H. savii is extensive, with both species found from China and northern India through to Spain, and these populations may be co-roosting at multiple sites due to the paucity of roosting areas in the steppe [23, 24] (Figure 3 ). Myotis blythii is considered an occasional migrant, with movement of greater than 450 km recorded. The migratory behavior of Hypsugo savii is not known [25] . The potential panmixia and co-roosting of these bat species may lead to a similar mixing of viruses. These results provide a foundation to study bat-borne coronaviruses in Kazakhstan and highlight the need for collaborative efforts in understudied countries to increase integrated surveillance capabilities toward better monitoring and detection of infectious diseases.
