Patient serum samples received for routine serological testing were chemically inactivated with Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 0.1% or 1% and compared with PBS-treated controls by several ELISA-based serological assays (Table 1) . Samples were carefully selected to cover a wide range of concentrations. Qualitative results were assessed for each sample and a false result rate (FRR) was calculated by computing false-negative and falsepositive results compared with controls for each test. The bias of test results compared with controls (mean differences versus average) was e0.6 ± 9.2% after treatment with 0.1% of Triton X-100 and e0.1 ± 18.6% after treatment with 1% of Triton X-100 (Table 1, Figs. 1a,b) . This good agreement was confirmed by other statistical methods including Deming linear regression with Spearman correlation coefficient >0.99 (Table S1 ). Automated chemiluminescent assays (CMIA and CLIA) gave similar results to manually performed ELISAs. Only one discordant qualitative result was observed for Dengue IgG after treatment with Triton X-100 0.1% and concerned a sample which was around the borderline cutoff (Table S2 ). The overall false result rate after treatment with 0.1% of Triton X-100 was 0.4% (0e2.2%, Table 1 ). Increasing concentration of Triton X-100 to 1% led to a non-significant increase of this false result rate to 1.7% (0.5e4.9%, Table 1 ). Accordingly, serology results were not substantially altered (Fig. 1b) . False results concerned the same borderline Dengue IgG sample: one sample with an Aspergillus test value around the positive cut-off and one sample for which HBV anti-HBc total Ig changed from weak positive in the control to negative in Triton X-100 1% (Table S2 ). In contrast, thermal inactivation by incubation of serum samples at 60 C for 1 h yielded aberrant serological test results with a mean bias of 17.5 ± 66.4%, which further increased to 37.9 ± 79.8% when combined with Triton X-100 0.1% (Table 1, Figs. 1c,d) . Since results did not fulfil the assumption of homoscedasticity (Figs. 1c,d) , no regression analysis was performed. The most relevant changes were seen for CMV IgG with biases of more than 95% (Table 1) . Accordingly, high false result rates were observed for most of the assays with an average of 14.5% (10.3e20.0) after heat inactivation and 25.6% (19.5e32.9) after the combination treatment (Table 1) . HIV antigen þ antibody (AgþAb), HBV HBs Ag, and IgG test results, however, remained relatively unaffected by heat inactivation with minimal bias and no discordant qualitative results (Table 1 ). In addition to the ELISA-based assays, we analysed the performances of a rapid test and a microagglutination test for the diagnosis of tularaemia after chemical or thermal inactivation of serum samples ( Table 2) . Triton X-100 0.1% did not have an effect on the accuracy of both tests. Triton X-100 1%, however, yielded acceptable rapid test results but disturbed microagglutination results. End titres were affected and several prozone and partial agglutination effects were observed. Heat inactivation yielded both poor rapid test and poor microagglutination results with many prozone effects.
