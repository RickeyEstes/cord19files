4.1. ARMAX models for single datasets 4.1.1. The impact of SARS on tourism demand Before building an ARMAX model for each SARSinfected country, the unit root tests must be implemented to ensure that the dependent variable is stationary. Table 3 presents the results of the ADF tests for the three series, including tourism demand, namely, international tourist arrivals, the probable SARS-infected patients and the number of confirmed cases of Avian Flu. The ADF test statistics are compared with the critical values from the nonstandard Dickey-Fuller distribution at the 5% significance level. If the ADF statistics are less than the critical value (i.e., MacKinnon critical values) at the 5% level, this will lead to the rejection of the unit root hypothesis, whereas the reverse results suggest that the null hypothesis of a unit root is not rejected. Since the ADF statistics with time effects for the tourism demand series for all SARS-infected countries are greater than the critical value, the unit root hypothesis cannot be rejected, implying that the series are non-stationary. By taking the first differences of the series, the unit root can be rejected for the first differences at the 5% significance level. We may, therefore, reasonably conclude that the series in relation to the tourism demand will be included in the ARMAX model for every country in the first-difference form. On the other hand, for the series regarding the number of SARS-infected patients, the ADF results without a deterministic trend show that stationarity exists in each country. Hence, the independent variables of probable SARS-infected patients will be included in the ARMAX model for each country in the levels form. In order to identify a suitable ARMA model for the dependent variable that has been transformed appropriately to obtain stationarity, two goodness-of-fit criteria, namely, the AIC and SBC, are used to select the most appropriate model. The results of deciding the initial ARMA model for the first-difference series of dependent variables in each country are presented in Table 4 . The model involving AR(2) and MA(2) in China is the most adequate ARMA model, while the first-difference series of tourism demand for Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan are represented by the ARMA(1,3) model, ARMA(1,3) model, and ARMA(1,3) model, respectively. After selecting the ARMA model for the dependent variable, the next step is to determine the lag length of probable SARS-infected patients (S). In this study, we start with an over-parameterized model according to maximum lengths of the AR and MA terms to get an initial ARMAX model. The results of the initial ARMAX model are presented in Appendix B. Table 5 shows the results of the simplified ARMAX model for estimating the impacts of SARS on tourism demand, namely, the estimation results of SARS on the tourism demand for China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. The estimated coefficients for probable SARSinfected cases (S it , S i(tÀ1) , S i(tÀ2) , S i(tÀ3) ) could be interpreted as the impacts of each SARS-infected patient on tourism demand if only distributed lags are included in the ARMAX model. For instance, the estimated results from Table 5 show that the impacts of probable SARSinfected cases on tourism demand for the current and next periods in Singapore will be significantly reduced by 798 and 1742 arrivals, respectively. However, the coefficients that determine the impacts on each period would be calculated on the basis of the quotient of polynomials formed by the distributed lags and by the AR polynomial lags if both the distributed lags and AR terms are included in the ARMAX models. The coefficients that determine the impacts of each period for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are shown in Table 6 . As for the impacts of probable SARS-infected patients on the tourism demand in China, we found that the change in tourism demand was reduced by 299 persons as one person became infected by SARS in the current period (or month) while in the next period the tourism demand was reduced by 355 arrivals. However, the estimation results for Hong Kong show that the impact of probable SARS-infected patients was that the tourism demand was reduced by 149 arrivals as one more person became infected with SARS in the current month. Finally, the estimation results for the impact of probable SARS-infected patients on the tourism demand in Taiwan are shown in the last column of Table 6 . In Taiwan, if one more person were to be infected by SARS in the current period, there would be reductions in the tourism demand in the current and the next period of about 175 and 57 arrivals, respectively. The estimation results in Table 6 indicate that the time period for the impacts of SARS on tourism demand in Asian countries extends for about 2 months which implies that the impact of SARS on tourism demand constitutes a short-term shock.
