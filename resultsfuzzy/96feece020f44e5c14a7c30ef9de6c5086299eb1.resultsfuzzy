no other tissues were FCoV RT-qPCR-positive. Only mutated FCoVs were detected in 14 samples, all of which had the M1058L mutation (nucleotide 23531A>T n = 7; nucleotide 23531A>C n = 7; none mixed). Failure (n = 1) Low copy number (n = 1; 2.6) a This includes 11 tissue samples with histopathological changes consistent with FIP, from cats definitively diagnosed with FIP based on analysis of additional tissue, but for which immunohistochemistry was negative (10 were positive for FCoV by RT-qPCR).
