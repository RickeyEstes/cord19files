The estimation results of the short-term impact of the FAA downgrade and EU ban on tourism receipts, tourist arrivals, and length of stay are shown in Tables 1, 5, and 6, respectively. Fig. 4 shows the downward trend in the monthly tourism receipts from January 2007 to March 2011, which includes the periods that correspond to the short-term impact of the downgrade (January-December 2008) and ban (April 2010-March 2011). The FAA downgrade and EU ban result in USD 28.28 million and USD 13.68 million decrease in monthly tourism receipts, respectively, in the short term (refer to Table 1 ). These results are not surprising since the DOT reported cancelations of travel to and tours in the Philippines following the downgrade and ban. The downgrade cost the Philippine tourism industry USD 339 million from January to December 2008, representing almost 14% of that year's tourism receipts while the ban cost the tourism industry USD 164 million in the 12 months following the ban (April 2010-March 2011), representing almost 7% of tourism receipts in 2010. The short-term negative impact of the downgrade and ban on tourism receipts corroborates the short-term effect of shocks on Fiji's tourism receipts (Narayan, 2005) as well as the temporary impact of shocks on the Caribbean tourism industry (Browne et al., 2009) , indicating that the Philippine Government's failure to comply with international aviation safety standards has a similar effect. The negative impact of the downgrade and ban on monthly tourism receipts is consistent with the data and trend line indicated in Fig. 4 . Since the short-term impact of the downgrade and ban on tourism receipts is substantial, the Philippines should address the safety concerns in its civil aviation industry in order for international visitors to return and continue traveling to and around the country, which invariably results in higher tourist expenditures. Table 2 An additional foreign visitor contributes, on average, USD 836, to tourism receipts per stay while an additional night per visit adds USD 25.28 million to tourism receipts monthly. These results imply that the Philippines should implement visa and tourismrelated policies that encourage foreign visitors to continue traveling to the country to increase tourist arrivals and visit multiple sites to increase length of stay, which invariably increase tourism receipts. International shocks such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and financial crises tend to reduce tourism receipts as foreign visitors either postpone or cancel their travel plans or cut their trip short. The impact of domestic shocks on tourism receipts is not significant. Table 4 ). The FAA downgrade and EU ban variables have the reverse sign -both impact tourist arrivals positively in the short term (refer to Table 5 ), indicating that foreign visitors, business and leisure travelers, ignored the downgrade and ban, resulting in 32,000 and 51,600 more tourists following the downgrade and ban, respectively. This may be due to the difficulty of canceling or modifying travel plans at the last minute or the financial cost associated with trip cancelation or modification, especially for business trips and visits to relatives. As mentioned earlier, the impact of the downgrade and ban on tourist arrivals is moderated by the millions of ethnic Filipinos with foreign passports who travel to the Philippines regularly. The reverse sign may also be due to the absence of major air transport accidents in the Philippines in the year immediately before and following the downgrade and ban, giving foreign visitors the impression that Philippine carriers and the civil aviation industry are relatively safe. The results also indicate the resilience of the tourism industry in the Philippines despite lingering safety concerns on its civil aviation industry by international aviation safety organizations. The absence of a negative impact of the downgrade and ban on tourist arrivals is similar to Thailand's-external shocks are insignificant to tourists' decision to visit and revisit (Kraipornsak, 2011) . The reverse sign of the downgrade and ban is consistent with the increasing trend in monthly tourist arrivals in Fig. 5 . The negative impact of the FAA downgrade and EU ban on tourism receipts (refer to Table 1 ) and their positive impact on tourist arrivals (refer to Table 5 ) are consistent with the observation of Campos-Soria et al. (2014) that in the short-term, tourists adjust quite readily by spending less during a financial crisis while tourist arrivals continue to increase. A weaker PHP results in more than 14,000 additional international visitors, underscoring the importance of an effective exchange rate policy to encourage leisure and business travelers to keep visiting the country and stay longer. The GDP growth in OECD countries results in 2,000 fewer visitors, indicating that the Philippines may not be a destination of choice for travelers with rising incomes or high-spending travelers. The impact of domestic shocks on tourist arrivals is not significant. International shocks impact tourist arrivals negatively, however, reducing the number of monthly visitors to the Philippines by more than 29,000, underscoring the vulnerability of the tourism industry to negative shocks such as terrorist attacks, epidemics, and economic crises. Fig. 6 shows the decreasing trend in the monthly average length of stay from January 2007 to March 2011, which includes the periods that correspond to the short-term impact of the FAA downgrade (January-December 2008) and the EU ban (April 2010-March 2011). The impact of the FAA downgrade on length of stay is positive, though small, while the impact of the ban is negative and substantial (refer to Table 6 ), suggesting that while some foreign visitors may have ignored the downgrade, most visitors considered the ban as serious and cut their trips short. Since length of stay is correlated with the number of destinations tourists visit during their trip (de Oliveira Santos et al., 2014) , the results suggest that foreign visitors for the period January to December 2008, which corresponds with the short-term impact of the downgrade, have essentially similar itineraries compared with tourist itineraries in other years since length of stay increased only by a fourth of a night, while the decrease of more than 1.2 nights from April 2010 to March 2011, which corresponds with the ban, suggests that tourists cut their trips short, resulting in less tourism receipts during this period (refer to Fig. 4) . The negative impact of the ban on length of stay is consistent with the downward trend in length of stay from January 2007 to March 2011 (refer to Fig. 6 ), indicating that the ban's negative impact on length of stay overwhelms the slightly positive impact of the downgrade. Although the expected daily expenses of foreign visitors in the Philippines and international shocks are highly significant and have the correct sign, their impact on length of stay is trivial. The GDP growth of OECD counties and domestic shocks are not significant. While tourist arrivals did not decline in the short term, Three asterisks (***) indicate significance at the 1% level and two asterisks (**) at the 5% level, while without an asterisk is insignificant. notwithstanding a 5% decline in 2009, the substantial decline in tourism receipts implies that foreign visitors have been spending less (refer to Fig. 4 ) and staying shorter following the downgrade and ban (refer to Table 2 and Fig. 6 ). This may indicate that tourists have shorter itineraries since additional trips within the Philippines entail travel using local airlines and exposure to the "unsafe" civil aviation system and that high-spending tourists, which are arguably more safety conscious than the average traveler, have not returned following the downgrade and ban. The estimation results of the long-term impact of the FAA downgrade and EU ban on tourism receipts, tourist arrivals, and length of stay are shown in Tables 7, 8 , and 9, respectively. Fig. 7 shows the increasing trend in monthly tourism receipts from January 2007 to December 2012, which includes the periods that correspond to the long-term impact of the downgrade (January 2008-December 2008) and ban (April 2010-December 2012). The FAA downgrade impacts tourism receipts negatively in the long term (refer to Table 7 ). The downgrade results in USD 37.46 million decline in monthly tourism receipts from January 2008 to December 2012 or a loss of almost USD 450 million annually, representing 16% of the average annual tourism receipts from 2008 to 2012. Table 2 shows that the annual tourism receipts did not return to the pre-downgrade level in 2007 until 2011, at least three years following the downgrade in January 2008. A consequence of the downgrade to Category 2 is the inability of the Philippine Airlines (PAL), the country's flag carrier, to expand its route network in North America, implying that the economic loss due to the downgrade extends beyond the tourism industry. The long-term impact of the EU ban on tourism receipts is positive, indicating that foreign visitors may have shrugged off the ban due to the lack of fatal airline accidents in the country between 2010 and 2012 and decided to proceed with their travel plans to the Philippines and perhaps even stayed a bit longer, i.e., length of stay started to recover, from its lowest level in November to December 2010, in January 2011 (refer to Fig. 6 ), reversing the short-term negative impact of the ban. This result may also indicate the resilience of the tourism industry in the long term in spite of the apparent deficiencies in civil aviation safety standards in the Philippines. The positive impact of the ban on tourism receipts in the long term is consistent with the increasing trend in monthly tourism receipts in Fig. 7 . An additional tourist spends USD 962 per stay while extending a visit for just one night results in USD 28.38 million additional tourism receipts per month. Since more tourists and longer stays result in higher tourism receipts, the country should implement more tourist and business friendly policies so that those who visit the country are encouraged to return, spend more, and invest in local businesses up to the legal limit of 40% per business venture. International shocks tend to reduce tourism receipts, underscoring the vulnerability of the tourism industry to unexpected and troublesome events around the world. The short-and long-term impact of the FAA downgrade and EU ban on tourism receipts have the same adjusted R 2 of 0.78, suggesting that the explanatory variables in both equations (refer to Eqs. (1) and (4) and Tables 1 and 7) adequately explain the variability in tourism receipts compared with the studies examined by Wang and Davidson (2010) , which reported R 2 or adjusted R 2 values of below 0.2 and lower than 0.1, respectively. The FAA downgrade and EU ban have the reverse sign (refer to Table 8 ), suggesting that tourists and business travelers ignored the safety warnings on the Philippine civil aviation industry and underscoring the positive impact of the millions of ethnic Filipinos with foreign passports who travel to the Philippines oblivious of the downgrade and ban. The results are similar to the short-term impact of the downgrade and ban on tourist arrivals (refer to Table 5) and corroborate the findings of Kraipornsak (2011) on international tourist arrivals in Thailand and the results of Aly and Strazicich (2000) and Browne et al. (2009) that suggest external shocks have a temporary effect in Israel and Egypt and on the Caribbean tourism industry, respectively. The reverse sign of the long-term impact of the downgrade and ban is consistent with the increasing trend in monthly tourist arrivals from January 2007 to December 2012 (refer to Fig. 8) . The real exchange rate and income variables have the correct sign-a weaker PHP and stronger economic growth in OECD countries result in more foreign visitors, underscoring the importance of a favorable exchange rate and increasing incomes. The FAA downgrade and EU ban impact length of stay negatively in the long term (refer to Table 9 ). The average length of stay decreased for three straight years from 2008 to 2010 and only slightly recovered in 2011 (refer to Table 2 ).The shorter stay partly explains the lower tourism receipts in the same period compared with the 2007 level. The impact of economic growth and expected daily expenditures on length of stay, though positive, is trivial while external shocks tend to impact length of stay negatively. The negative impact of the downgrade and ban on length of stay in the long term is consistent with the decreasing trend in length of stay from January 2007 to December 2012 (refer to Fig. 9 ).
