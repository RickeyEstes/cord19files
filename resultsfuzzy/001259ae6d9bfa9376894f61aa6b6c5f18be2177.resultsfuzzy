The characteristics of the MHV-JHM ts mutants used in this study are presented in Table 1 . wt MHV-JHM is highly neurotropic and induces mainly acute fatal encephalomyelitis. Surviving animals (l-25% of those infected) develop demyelinating disease (Weiner, 1973; Lampert et al., 1973) . In contrast, the live ts mutants are severely attenuated in their neurovirulance. The ts 104, ts 110 and ts 115 MHV-JHM mutants did not induce any brain disease, even after inoculation of up to 10,000 plaque forming units (PFU). The ts15 mutant induced demyelination in only about 5% of infected mice. In contrast, ts8 induced demyelination in the spinal cord in 99% of the mice infected with 500 PFU, and in over 50% of the mice infected with 50 PFU. Therefore, the ts8 Robb et al., 1979 . g Haspel et al., 1978 mutant has been extensively used as an excellent model to study demyelination. The primary aim of these studies was to determine whether there are any differences in the viral structural proteins expressed by cells infected with wt or ts MHV-JHM mutants. The virions of MHV-JHM contains 3 structural polypeptides: the phosphorylated nucleocapsid N, the transmembrane M protein and the S peplomer glycoprotein (Siddell et al., 1981; Sturman and Holmes, 1983; Bond et al., 1984) . Immunoprecipitation, using specific i kl Fig. 1 . See page 108 for legend. antibodies against S, M and N polypeptides, of 35S-labeled lysates of L2 cells infected with either wt or ts MHV-JHM mutants, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis, revealed that all three viral proteins exhibited the same molecular masses (Fig. 1) . In particular the S peplomer protein from cells infected with either wt or any of the five ts MHV-JHM mutants exhibited a molecular mass of 180 kDa. The M matrix protein had a molecular mass of 25 kDa and the N nucleocapsid protein of 60 kDa (Fig. 1) . The remainder of our studies were concentrated on the S peplomer protein since it mediates many of the important biological functions of the virus. The S peplomer proteins expressed by L2 cells infected with either wt or any one of the 5 ts MHV-JHM mutants were compared using isoelectric focusing followed by immunoblotting. (lanes d,gj) . Lane a is from the autoradiogram exposed seven days longer than the autoradiogram (from the same experiment) shown in lane b. Different aliquots of L2 cells infected with either wt or any one of the 5 ts MHV-JHM mutants were subjected to isoelectric focusing as described in Materials and Methods. The focused MHV viral proteins were then transferred to NC sheets and the S peplomer proteins were identified using specific goat anti-S antibody. Bound anti-S antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG and diaminobenzidine as substrate (Fig. 2) . wt MHV-JHM S peplomer protein displayed microheterogeneity on isoelectric focusing and exhibited eight bands, in the range of pl between 6 to 7.45. The S peplomer protein of the ts mutants was also resolved into several bands (six or seven) with pl in the range of 6 to 7.45. Comparison of the staining pattern of wt MHV S peplomer protein with each one of the 5 ts MHV-JHM mutants revealed significant differences. Furthermore, there were significant differences in the staining pattern of the S proteins between all five ts MHV-JHM mutants. Control experiments where the NC sheets were reacted with normal goat serum instead of specific goat anti-S antibody revealed no visible bands (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation of the S peplomer protein, using goat-anti S specific antibody, from lysates of L2 cells infected with the 5 ts MHV-JHM mutants, followed by SDS-PAGE, revealed that they exhibited identical apparent molecular weight (Fig. 1) . In contrast, Taguchi and Flemming (1989) infected with MHV-JHM or from cultures of astrocytes persistently infected with MHV-JHM exhibited significant differences in the size of S peplomer protein in comparison to that of the parent virus (Taguchi et al., 1985; Morris et al., 1989) . The S peplomer protein of MHV is involved in cell to cell fusion, induction of neutralizing antibodies, attachment to the MHV cellular receptor and is a target of cell-mediated immune responses (Collins et al., 1982; Holmes et al., 1981; Wege et al., 1988; Wysocka et al., 1989; Williams et al., 1990) . It is an important determinant of cell and organ tropism of MHV and may have a key role in the evolution of persistent infections. Recently, we have demonstrated a molecular mimicry between S peplomer protein and Fc receptor Leibowitz 1990a, 1990b; Oleszak at al., 1992) . The S peplomer protein plays a major role in establishing persistent infection. Major differences were found in the microheterogeneity of the S peplomer proteins between the wt and all five of the ts MHV-JHM mutants. This finding is not unexpected since the S peplomer protein has 21 glycosylation sites (Schmidt et al., 1987) . The S peplomer protein like many other N-linked glycoproteins contains both mannose and fucose, but no N-acetylgalactosamine (Holmes et al., 1981) . It is synthesized on membrane-bound ribosomes as N-glycosylated polypeptide with molecular weight of 150,000. During transport through Golgi, glycosylation take place resulting in a 180,000 mol wt. S glycoprotein (Holmes et al., 1981; Siddell et al., 1981) . The fact that the S peplomer protein of the ts mutants and the wt MHV-JHM have identical molecular weights suggest that the microheterogeneity that we observed is due to differences in glycosylation. It remains to be established whether these differences in glycosylation of the S peplomer protein plays a role in the different neuropathogenic properties of the wt and the ts MHV-JHM mutants. It is not clear at present if changes in amino acid sequence or conformation might be responsible for these changes in glycosylation.
