The $2 sequences The newly determined D207 and D 1466 sequences are based on data from two or more independent cDNA clones. With strain D1466, two nucleotide differences between cDNA clones were observed. Neither of these differences resulted in an amino acid replacement. From the nucleotide sequences (submitted to the EMBL Genbank and DDBJ Nucleotide Sequence Databases), amino acid sequences have been deduced. In Figure 1 the amino acid sequences are listed together with those of all other known $2 sequences. Assuming the conserved Arg-Arg-X-Arg-Arg-Ser sequence to be the cleavage site between S1 and $28, the (Table I) . However, 19 out of 20 cysteine residues and most glycosylation sites are completely conserved.
