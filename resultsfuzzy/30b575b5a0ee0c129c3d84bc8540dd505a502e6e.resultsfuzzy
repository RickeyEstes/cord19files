Many different parameters can be used to encode RNA sequence information and further assign or predict the function or physical properties (Gonzá lez-Díaz and Uriarte, 2005). The present approach involves the calculation of different sequence parameters, which can be applied to different types of molecular graphs (Aguero-Chapin et al., 2006) , including DNA, RNA and proteins (Di Francesco, 1999; Gonzá lez-Díaz et al., 2005c) . MM has been applied successfully to Genomics and Proteomics and represents an important tool to analyse biological sequence data. In particular, MM has been used for protein folding recognition (Chou, 2001b) and for prediction of protein signal sequences (Chou and Shen, 2007b; Van Waterbeemd, 1995) . This work compared two models based on different TIs including p k and y k values of the stochastic matrices 1 P(LN) and 1 P(SG) ( SG M) associated with LN and SG, LN x k parameters of 1 P(LN) as well as classic TIs for 1 P(SG). These parameters describe the distribution of the nucleotides of the DNA sequence in the above graphs/ networks. This calculation was carried out for two groups of DNA sequences, one made up of Mps and the other formed by Cgs. In addition, previous results of the RNA secondary structure (2S) QSAR are compared. In the first study of the DNA LN representations, the best QSAR equation that classifies a novel sequence as Mps or not is the following (Table 3) Table 3 . Analyzing the above equations, it is important to highlight that, the combination of a negative contribution of LN x 1 and a positive contribution of LN x 5 in Eq. (21) point to a pseudo-folding rule for the biological activity. A validation procedure was subsequently performed in order to assess the model predictability. This validation was carried out with an external series of Mps and randomized Cgs. The present model showed an accuracy of 90.87%, which is similar in comparison to results obtained by other researchers when using the LDA method in QSAR studies (Gonzá lez-Díaz et al., 2007f) . These results are also consistent with many others that we have recently reviewed in-depth and published as a review article where we used different networklike indices in small-sized, nucleic acid, and protein QSAR (Gonzá lez-Díaz et al., 2005d , 2007d Marrero-Ponce et al., 2005a, b; Van Waterbeemd, 1995) . The second study used the SG-QSAR models in order to evaluate the same mycobacterial DNA promoter property (see Table 3 ). The grouping of the embedded and non-embedded TIs was done similar to the lattice models: the traces ( SG p k e / SG p k ), the Shannon entropies ( SG y k e / SG y k ), the rest of embedded and nonembedded TIs (H, W, S 6 , S, J, 0 X, 2À5 X, 1 XR, H e , W e , S 6 e , S e , J e , 0 X e , 2À5 X e , 1 XR e ) and all SG TIs (pool). The forward stepwise selection variable method, conjugated with the nE & E TIs of the virtually translated DNA sequences, provides better results for the codon grouping of the nucleotides, with accuracy, sensitivity and specificity greater than 70% for the SG p k e / SG p k and for the pool (Table 3) . Even if the accuracy of the simple nucleotide sequences are up to 81.58% (pool), the selectivity and the specificity have values lower than 70%. The best QSAR model using the SG based on the codon sequences is defined with the SG p k e / SG p k group of indices in Eq. (22)
