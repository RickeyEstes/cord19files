(Figs 2-4) demonstrate the importance of CP in STMV replication while results of the Co-IP assays (Fig. 6A ) demonstrate that CP interacts with HV-RdRp. Does interaction of HV-RdRp with STMV RNA require CP? To answer this question, we performed a Far-Northwestern assay. Results are shown in Fig. 7(A,B) . Since variant 3A translates inefficiently in vivo (Fig. 4F) , a Northwestern analysis was performed using in vitro translation
