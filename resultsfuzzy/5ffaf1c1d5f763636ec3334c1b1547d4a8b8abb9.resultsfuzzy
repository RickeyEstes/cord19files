Cultures of nasopharyngeal aspirates from 100 patients were positive in 67% of patients. Cultures yielded growth of one or more pathogen among upper respiratory tract normal flora. Gram positive cocci were isolated from 57/90 (63.3%) of specimens including: Streptococcus pneumoniae 25/90 (27.7%), Staphylococcus aureus 32/90 (35.5%). Gram negative bacilli were detected in 33/90(36.6%) of specimens including, Klebsiella pneumoniae 15/90 (16.6%), Escherichia coli 10/90 (11.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8/90 (8.8%), while Cultures of the control group showed growth of upper respiratory tract normal flora (table 1) . Twenty two (22%) out of the 100 NPA specimens of the patients were positive for HBoV and 78 (78%) specimens were negative by qualitative PCR. While all the 50 NPA of the control group were negative for HBoV. Also there was a high significant difference between the patient and the control groups since p < 0.001 (table 2) . Eighteen (18%) out of the 100 serum samples of the patients with respiratory tract manifestations were positive for HBoV IgM antibodies by ELISA such patients are also positive by PCR, and 82 (82%) specimens were HBoV negative by ELISA. While all 50 serum samples of the controls were negative (table 3) . Serum concentration of IgM antibodies against HBoV were detected significantly in patients (0.28 ± 0.06 vs 0.07 ± 0.01 controls), p < 0.001. Table 4 showed the number of positive cases by the different diagnostic methods. Table 5 showed that there was a highly significant association between the PCR and ELISA techniques.
