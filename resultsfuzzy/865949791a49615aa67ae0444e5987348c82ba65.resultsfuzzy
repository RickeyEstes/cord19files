Image analysis of 2-DE serum protein profiles from healthy subjects and OSCC patients Unfractionated serum samples were separated via 2-DE to generate high-resolution proteome profiles for healthy subjects (Fig. 1a) and OSCC patients (Fig. 1b) . Protein spots in the 2-DE gels from OSCC patients (n = 25) and normal controls (n = 25) were analyzed using PDQuest 2-D gel analysis software. This comparative analysis revealed several up-and down-regulated proteins in the serum of OSCC patients ( Table 1) .
