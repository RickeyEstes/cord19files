Of the 951 tested samples, 95.0% (903) samples showed consistent results between PCR and ELISA in the detection of C. parvum (Table 4) , including 5.4% (51) positive and 89.6% (852) negative samples. The samples also included 0.7% (7) samples that were PCR+/ELISA-and 4.3% (41) samples that were PCR-/ELISA+. The value was calculated to be 0.65, indicating good agreement. In addition, no samples positive for C. bovis/ryanae, based on the PCR results, showed positive results using ELISA.
