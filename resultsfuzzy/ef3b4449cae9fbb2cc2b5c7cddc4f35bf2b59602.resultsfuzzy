Studies have shown an increase in preventive measures taken by the public against 2009 H1N1 influenza infection (Goodwin et al., 2009; Rubin et al., 2009) , and our findings support this. The health protective behaviors of covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands regularly, and adopting healthy lifestyles appeared consistently high from week 2 to week 6 of the survey (Fig. 1.3) . Declining trends were observed in the latter two as the number of deaths decreased after week 6. The apparent reduction in some avoidance behaviors as the number of deaths declined may indicate a decrease in risk perception, with consequent decline in the adoption of preventive measures (Lau et al., 2007; Leppin and Aro, 2009 ). The proportions wearing masks, staying at home and taking preventive medicine increased with the number of reported deaths, and despite a decline after the peak weekly deaths, remained at a higher level at the end of the study when compared to the beginning. Our data indicate that reported deaths due to the H1N1 influenza pandemic influenced public's health-protective behaviors. As such, health authorities and media should stress to the public to continuously adopt healthy behaviors to prevent infection even if the number of reported deaths decreases. There were clear increases in impact on respondents' and their family's routines during the acute phase of the pandemic (weeks 4 to 6), with a decline after week 6 to earlier levels ( Fig. 1.4) . This suggests that, in the event of a new H1N1 pandemic, provision of information to the public should be designed to increase perceived risk of infection and yet minimize social and economic impact.
