Description of the ADRP Domain of SARS nsP3 The cloned insert contains 182 residues from nsP3 of SARS-CoV-Tor2 and has a monomer molecular weight of 19,523 Da and a pI of 6.9. The final structural model refined against crystallographic data to 1.4 Å resolution has four subunits in the asymmetric unit in very similar conformations (rmsds < 0.4 Å for 166 Ca atoms). We do not observe electron density for a few residues at the C terminus of each of the four monomers. These include 5 residues in chain D, 15 residues in the chain A, and 9 residues each in the B and C monomers. The final refinement statistics and stereochemical parameters of the structure are listed in Table 1 . Overall, each subunit consists of eight b strands and six a helices ( Figure 2A ). Strands 2-8 form a central seven-stranded b sheet that has a strand order of 2387465. The outermost strands on either side are antiparallel to the rest. The six helices straddle the central b sheet to form a three-layered a/b/ a topology. Two of the subunits in the asymmetric unit form a loosely packed head-to-head dimer ( Figure 2B) . A short loop connecting strand 6 and helix H4 is involved in weak interfacial contacts with the conserved Gly-rich segment of the other monomer. The interface is fairly small at w870 Å 2 (435 Å 2 per monomer) and predominantly nonpolar (60%). Residues that form the putative active site lie close to the dimer interface. The enzyme elutes as a homodimer in gel-filtration studies (data not shown), indicating that the physiologically relevant form of this protein may be dimeric.
