Bicalutamide (Casodex, Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, DE) is a nonsteroidal, androgen antagonist drug that blocks the androgen receptor at the level of the target organ and at the level of the hypothala mus. Biclutarnide is available in 50-mg tablets, which can be used at a dosage of 5 mg/kg once a day. 26 Results do not appear as encouraging as with leuprolide acetate, but it can be effective in certain individual animals. It works particularly well to alleviate the stranguria associated with an enlarged prostate. (Table 8 ). recommend ACTH stimulation test to evaluate corticolytic effects tion in the ferret, which is an induced ovulator. High levels of estrogens in jills that are not brought out of heat either by coitus or by use of therapeutic drugs can result in fatal bone marrow depression. In most cases, ovariohysterectomy is the logical and efficient method of bringing the jill out of heat, especially when prolonged estrus is the result of owner ignorance or neglect; however, ovulation can be induced in breeding jills or by animals that are not surgical candidates by injec tion of exogenous hormones. Human chorionic gonadotropin (Cystore lin, Merial Ltd., Athens, GA) can be used IM at a dose of 100 IU, or gonadotropin releasing hormone can be used at a dose of 20 µ.g either IM or subcutaneousl y. The dose can be repeated in 1 week if signs of estrus have not significantly regressed. 


Section:• 1 3 clinical trials in ferrets are ongoing, and initial results are promising. the drug can be used as a daily injection, or a 1-or 4-month depot injection. each bottle must be reconstituted with diluent, which is provided by the manufacturer. although expensive, a single vial can treat 10 ferrets. stability once reconstituted is unknown but is also under investigation. clinical signs generally begin to resolve within 1 to 4 weeks of treatment. reversal of clinical signs is often complete.
