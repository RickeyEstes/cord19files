Wastewater as a source of infection Developing countries In particular developing countries and to some extent also developed countries, rural areas predominantly, sanitation is inadequate resulting in diseases such as infections [2] . It is estimated that there are over 4 billion diarrheal cases per year resulting in 2.2 million deaths [2] . The major cause is exposure to excreta and wastewater where Vibrio cholerae and Salmonella typhi are notable causes of diarrheal diseases [25, 26] . Interventions focusing on sanitation has shown to reduce the percentage in diarrheal morbidity with 36% [27] . Other benefits with improved sanitation are economic and environmental gains [28] . In numbers, the return of investment is huge. Every US$1 invested on sanitation brings a $5.50 return by keeping people healthy and productive. In comparison, poor sanitation, costs countries between 0.5 and 7.2% of their gross domestic product (GDP) [28] . The potential savings and need for better quality in life has resulted in e.g. the UN-Water wastewater task force involving different stakeholders working to improve sanitation [29] .
