As shown in Scheme 1, OA derivatives, namely, 3a-g, were synthesized. The esterification of OA at C-28 was performed by treatment with benzyl bromide to produce OA ester 2a. Organic acids (R 1 OH) were coupled with the 3-OH position of 2a to obtain esters 3a-e using the DMAP/EDCI system. Nicotinic acid or isonicotinic acid was dissolved in SOCl 2 , and triethylamine and 2a were added to obtain 3f-g. The synthesis of GA derivatives 3h-n is described in Scheme 2. Treatment of GA with benzyl bromide in the presence of K 2 CO 3 gives the GA ester 2b. The 3-OH position of 2b reacts with organic acids (R 2 OH) in the EDCI/DMAP system to form compounds 3h-l. Treatment of nicotinic acid or isonicotinic acid with SOCl 2 was followed by the addition of triethylamine and 2b as the acid-binding agent, using the esterification procedure to obtain the compounds 3m,n . Compounds 5a,b, 6a,b and  7a,b were prepared as shown in Schemes 3 and 4. In some studies, it has been reported that the esters of acetylsalicylic acid easily undergo ester exchange reactions. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] 39 Thus, when acetylsalicylic acid was reacted with 2a,b in the EDCI/ DMAP system, we did not obtain 4a,b, but rather 5a,b, and we have shown the possible reaction mechanism in Figure 2 . The high nucleophilicity of DMAP contributed to its nucleophilic addition to the ester moiety of acetylsalicylic acid to form intermediate I, which was converted to a N-acylpyridinium intermediate by elimination of a phenoxide anion. Afterward, the N-acylpyridinium salt was nucleophilically attacked by the hydroxyl moiety of 2a,b to produce intermediate II, which was neutralized by the in situ formed phenoxide anion, followed by removal of DMAP and transformation into the desired ester 5a or 5b. We have attempted to obtain 6a,b and 7a,b by treating 2a,b with acetyl 3-hydroxybenzoic acid and acetyl 4-hydroxybenzoic acid in the EDCI/DMAP system. While the treatment of 2a,b with acetyl 3-hydroxybenzoic acid indeed allows preparing 6a,b, we almost did not get other by-products. Interestingly, the main product obtained as a result of the interaction of acetylated 4- hydroxybenzoic  acid with 2a,b is 5a,b instead of 7a,b. in vitro cytotoxic activity The compounds 1a,b, 2a,b, 3a-n, 5a,b, 6a,b and 7a,b were evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxicity against SGC-7901, MCF-7, Eca-109, HeLa, Hep-G2 and HSF cells by 40 Considering that the literatures related to this study used both micromolar studies of the cytotoxicity of OA and GA derivatives, 31, 32, 41, 42 so this research used micromolar to study the cytotoxicity of the compounds 1a,b,  2a,b, 3a-n, 5a,b, 6a,b and 7a,b. The antitumor activities were expressed in terms of IC 50 (μM) and are summarized in Table 1 . On the whole, GA and its derivatives had better cytotoxicity than OA and its derivatives. The parent compounds OA and GA both showed low inhibitory activities against MCF-7 cells, Hep-G2 cells and HSF cells. GA had better cytotoxicity values than gefitinib for SGC-7901 cells, Eca-109 cells and HeLa cells, especially for SGC-7901 cells with an IC 50 value of 10.20±1.23 μM, but OA showed a poor inhibitory effect on these three cell lines. In contrast to OA and GA, esterified compounds 2a and 2b with benzyl group exhibited relatively high inhibitory activities against MCF-7 cells, Eca-109 cells and Hep-G2 cells. This indicated that the benzyl group introduced in C-28 position of OA or C-30 position of GA was beneficial to improve the inhibitory activity against these cancer cells. The selective inhibitory activity of the compounds was significantly enhanced when OA was further modified. Compounds 3a-g showed strong inhibitory activities against Hep-G2 cells, but a poor inhibitory effect on HSF cells. This result is consistent with the test results of novel ligustrazine-oleanolic acidamino acid derivatives synthesized by Chu et al. 31 The R 1 group was 4-(1H-indol-3-yl)butyroxy long-chain-substituted compound (3b, IC 50 8.97±0.13 μM), which had a significantly stronger inhibitory activity against Hep-G2 cells than 2-(1H-indol-3-yl)acetoxy short-chain-substituted compound (3a, IC 50 24.47±1.18 μM). Introducing salicyloyloxy (3d) to C-3 position of 2a led to a significant increase of the selective inhibitory activity with a low IC 50 value of 4.06±0.24 μM on Hep-G2 cells, but for HSF cells, it exhibited a poor inhibitory effect with a high IC 50 value of 79.94±4.42 μM. In addition, 3f and 3g with heteroaroyl group at C-3 position of 2a also presented the superior activity against Hep-G2 cells. Surprisingly, compounds 6a and 7a, bearing the same AcO group in different locations, presented a strong inhibitory activity against HeLa cells, and the compound with o-AcO substitutions (6a, IC 50 11.98±0.51 μM) at an aromatic ring was more active than the compound with p-AcO substitutions (7a, IC 50 15.51±0.73 μM). As a result of further modification of GA, the compounds exhibited different anticancer activities. Compounds 3h, 3i and 3k displayed a poor inhibitory effect on the five kinds of cancer cells, indicating that these organic acid moieties introduced in C-3 position of 2b were not beneficial to enhance their inhibitory activity. Compounds 3j and 3l exhibited a strongly selective inhibitory activity, and in particular, compound 3l showed the strongest inhibitory activity against HeLa cells with an IC 50 value of 4.32±0.89 μM, suggesting that an AcO substituent might enhance 3j toward tumor cell lines. Compounds 3m and 3n presented more potential anticancer activity in comparison with gefitinib, with compound 3m being the most active one, indicating that the heteroaroyl introduced in C-3 position of 2b was beneficial to enhance its inhibitory activity. The cytotoxicity of the derivatives obtained by the Schwarz and Csuk introduction of amino acids at the C-3 position of the GA benzyl ester is consistent with the present results. 42 Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of compound 3m on HSF cells was lower than that of gefitinib (IC 50 , 20.54±0.52 μM). In addition, 5b with AcO group at C-3 position of 2b showed the superior inhibitory activity against tumor cell lines, especially for Hep-G2 cells with an IC 50 value of 3.74±0.18 μM. Yadav et al 43 used the quantitative structureactivity relationship (QSAR) model to predict that compound 5b has a significant inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells. Our experimental results are consistent with the predictions. Like compounds 6a and 7a, compounds 6b and 7b also presented strong targeting inhibition of HeLa cells with IC 50 values of 7.82±0.02 and 10.51±0.62 μM, respectively. In summary, although the structures of OA and GA were similar, they and their derivatives exhibited different anticancer activities. Their anticancer activity was different even if the same group was introduced. Another important finding was that the introduction of a pyridine ring with a lower electron density to the 3-OH position of GA benzyl ester (compounds 3m and 3n) could greatly increase its anticancer activity. Furthermore, the incorporation of a carbonyl group with an electron-withdrawing property into the 3-OH position of GA benzyl ester (compound 5b) also could greatly improve its anticancer activity. Therefore, we tried to sum up a conclusion as follows: GA was first converted into its benzyl ester of GA, and then an electron-withdrawing group was introduced to the 3-OH position of the benzyl ester of GA, which could greatly improve the anticancer activity of GA. This conclusion also applied to OA because the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups to the 3-OH position of the benzyl ester of OA (compounds 3f, 3g and 5a) could also significantly improve the anticancer activity of OA.
