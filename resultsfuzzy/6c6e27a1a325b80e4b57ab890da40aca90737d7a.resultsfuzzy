Penetration of particles through mask before and after decontamination Figs 3-7 depict the penetration of particles through the electret masks before and after decontamination using the five selected methods. Before decontamination, the particle penetration through the N95 mask did not exceed 5%. However, the penetration of particles larger than 27.9 nm through the Gauze mask exceeded 5%, and that of particles from 14.1 nm to 594 nm through the Spunlace mask exceeded 8.6% (Fig 3) . According to Fig 3, the penetration of particles through the test masks following heating in the rice cooker was similar to that before heating. Treating the masks in an autoclave increased the penetration of particles through the Spunlace and Gauze masks (Fig 4) . Figs 5-7 reveal that treating the test masks with ethanol, bleach or isopropanol raised the penetration of particles, (especially larger ones. Submersion in bleach significantly changed the penetration through the N95 masks (Fig 6) . Filter quality of electret masks in filtering aerosol particles after decontamination Electret fibrous filters, which were used in the masks were tested in this investigation, are highly representative of such respirators. For a given fiber diameter, packing density, and thickness, electret filters have much higher filtration efficiency than non-electret filters, particularly for submicron aerosols [12] . To assess the effect of charge density on filtration efficiency, filters were dipped in isopropanol to remove charges before measuring the filter quality [2] . Filter quality of electret masks in filtering aerosol particles after decontamination The charge density of filters strongly affected the filtration efficiency. Reducing the charge density increased aerosol penetration. Treatment of N95 masks with isopropanol increased the penetration of particles larger than 50 nm, owing to a reduction in the charge density of the filter. Filter quality of electret masks in filtering aerosol particles after decontamination The experimental results indicate that decontamination by dry heat in a rice cooker had little effect on the penetration of particles through any of the tested masks (Fig 3) , while wet heat in the autoclave had little effect on that of the N95 mask (Fig 4) . From a previous study [8] , the penetration of N95 masks that were sealed in a standard poly/paper autoclave bag and then treated in an autoclave, as measured using a TSI Model 8130 automated filter tester, increased from 0.7% to 18.7% (p = 0.003). However, in the same study, the penetration of particles had little effect on the N95 masks that were treated with tap water (p = 0.417) or dry heat at a temperature of 80˚C (p = 0.192). The major discrepancies of penetration of particles between pretreated and treated masks were discussed in the later section of MPS. Chemical methods that involved submersion in liquid ethanol, isopropanol or bleach influenced the penetration of particles through the electret masks, probably because alcohols and bleach eliminated the electrostatic charges on the filters [22] , and characteristics such as fiber diameter, packing density and charge density determined the ultimate effect [12] . Bleach destroys the structure of Gauze filters. Treatment with bleach seriously damaged the structure of the filter in the double-layer static Gauze mask used in this study, preventing it from being tested further (Fig 6) . Similarly, FFR melted under microwave irradiation or dry heat starting at 100˚C. [9] . The penetrations of particles before and after decontamination were experimentally compared using particles of traditional standard sizes for penetration tests. The standard sizes were 75 nm [10] and 300 nm for electret masks and mechanical filter filtration [12] , respectively. The results thus indicate that decontamination increased the penetration of both 75 nm and 300 nm particles through the masks (p<0.05), except in the cases of decontamination of N95 masks in a rice cooker or an autoclave, and Gauze and Spunlace masks in a rice cooker (Fig 8) . Moreover, Spunlace masks treated by ethanol did not statistically significant increase the penetration of 300 nm particles (p = 0.093).
