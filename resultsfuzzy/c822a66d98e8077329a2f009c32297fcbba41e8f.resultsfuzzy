The expression of soluble S protein containing the receptor binding domain The S glycoproteins of coronaviruses carry out essential virus entry functions [11, 12] . In some coronaviruses, proteolytic cleavage of the S protein yields the amino-terminal S1 and carboxyl-terminal S2 subunits, which function in receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively [9, 10] . Although there is not yet direct evidence that the S protein of SARS-CoV is cleaved into subunits, the S1 and S2 domains of the SARS-CoV S protein can be identified through their homology with the S1 and S2 subunits of other coronaviruses. To determine whether the S1 domain of SARS-CoV S protein can interact with SARS-CoV permissive Vero E6 cells, we expressed a series of truncated S1 proteins tagged with 9· His in the baculovirus expression system: S640 (14-640), S500 (14-502), and S440 (14-440). These fragments would be secreted into the culture medium because of the signal peptide ligated to their N terminal, and their existence in conditioned medium was tested by ELISA. The binding of these proteins to Vero E6 cells was analyzed by FACS using sera from SARS patients or anti-6· His mAb. We found that both S640 and S500 were able to bind with Vero E6 cells while S440 was unable to do so (Fig. 1A) . Further study with S500 showed that it did not bind to non-infectable cells such as HeLa cells (Fig. 1B) . Moreover, this S500 binding could be blocked if S500 was pre-incubated with neutralizing sera from convalescent SARS patients (Fig. 1C) . These studies indicate that S500 could specifically interact with a putative receptor expressed on the surface of Vero E6 cells. Similar results were recently reported that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein located in the N-terminal 318-510 residuals [15, 16] . Our results further indicated that 503-510 residuals were unnecessary for binding with the receptor.
