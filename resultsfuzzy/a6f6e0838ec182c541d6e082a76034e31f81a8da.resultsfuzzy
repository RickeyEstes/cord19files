The procedure report should include, at a minimum, the following: the primary and secondary operators; the indication for the procedure; names and doses of any medications administered; intake, output, and estimated blood loss; catheter/pacing/ICD lead model numbers, serial numbers, insertion sites, and intracardiac destinations; findings and procedure performed; complications encountered; and fluoroscopic exposure (minutes; mGy; dose-area product). Patients who receive excessive radiation exposure during a procedure (typically 43000 mGy, but requirements vary by state) must be notified and followed up for evidence of skin damage. Ideally, this information is stored in a database for QA purposes. Recordings made during the procedure (electrograms and fluoroscopic and mapping system images) should be archived on digital media (ideally on a network, or alternatively on a CD or DVD) for future reference, if needed. 64
