The mass spectra produced from pyrolysis of media from cell cultures are inherently complicated because of the many different chemical constituents required to grow and maintain viable cells in vitro. Growth and maintenance media are isotonic solutions that furnish cells with nutrients and vitamins while regulating the pH and electrolyte balance [21] . The growth media is also routinely supplemented with blood serum (5%-20% v/v) which provides the cells with additional nutrients and growth factors such as hormones, trace elements, minerals, and lipids [21] . Antibiotics are also added to the culture to inhibit bacterial contamination. Viruses are usually harvested by physical lysis of the infected host cells, a practice which further complicates the culture milieu by releasing intracellular biochemical constituents. Figure 1a , b displays the mass spectra of supernatants recovered from a Vero cell culture infected with VEE and media from a Vero cell culture that was not infected. Many of the peaks observed in the two spectra are fragment ions generally attributed to the pyrolysis of proteins and free amino acids [22, 23] . In addition, ion fragments from the other classes of biomolecules (lipids, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates) also contribute to the spectral peaks observed for the cell culture media [24] . The two mass spectra are similar both qualitatively and quantitatively. The relative proportions of biomolecules apparently remains constant between the two cell cultures despite one being infected with the VEE virus. VEE is composed of a strand of nucleic acid encapsulated in a protein shell which is covered by a lipid bilayer. Biomolecules, regardless of their origin, are thermally degraded to the same degree. Therefore, pyrolysis of the virus is expected to produce molecular fragments of similar nominal masses as produced by the culture medium. Because the two mass spectra in Figure 1a , b are nearly identical it is presumed that the contribution of the virus is negligible, otherwise a noticeable difference in peak ratios between the two spectra would be visibly apparent. This result was not unexpected, considering that the yield of viral mass from infected cells is small (ϳ0.1% w/w) relative to the overall masses of the host cells and growth media. The chemical signal originating from the cell culture media dominates the spectra of the unpurified viral media overwhelming the peaks generated from the viruses. This result is consistent with the previous study by Tas et al. [16] which concluded that purification appeared to be a prerequisite for reliable classification of the virus. Subsequently, the cell culture media was examined in greater detail because a biomarker distinct to the virus could not be easily detected from the matrix. The planned course of this analysis was to systematically determine which of the constituents of the cell culture media contributes the greatest to the overall mass spectra generated by the supernatants. The constituents for both the infected cell culture media, and supernatants from these media are listed in Table 1 . The constituent recognized as having the strongest influence would then be thoroughly examined for potential biomarkers that would facilitate rapid detection of media commonly associated with viruses. The mass spectrum from a complete growth medium consisting of EMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% of a 100ϫ diluted antibiotic-antimycotic solution is shown in Figure 1c . Visibly, this mass spectrum is comparable to the spectra from cell culture supernatants (Figure 1a, b) . The most noticeable difference being the higher intensities of m/z 70 and 84 in the complete growth medium spectrum. The varying intensities observed between the spectra in Figure 3 are most likely the direct result of the metabolic activity of the cultured cells. Aside from the variability in peak intensities, it appears that the complete growth media is a dominant contributor to the overall distribution of mass spectral peaks. Consequentially, each constituent (EMEM, fetal bovine serum, and antibiotic-antimycotic solution) of the complete growth media was examined. Due to the complexity of the individual spectra, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to help interpret the data. The score plot of the first two principal components (59% of total variance) obtained for the mass range beginning with m/z 210 and ending with m/z 420 is shown in Figure 2 . Each datapoint, on the score plot, represents a mass spectrum from either the complete growth media or one of its constituents. The similarity between two mass spectra is measured by the distance between their respective datapoints on the score plot [25] . The closer the distance between two datapoints, the more these two mass spectra resemble one another. Datapoints representing the fetal bovine serum spectra clustered nearest to the respective points for the complete growth media. Therefore, the mass spectral peaks observed for the complete growth medium originate mainly from the blood serum constituent. The influence of the serum was determined to be the greatest for the mass range of m/z 210 to m/z 420. Blood sera was further analyzed to determine if characteristic biochemical molecules, in the mass range extending from m/z 210 to m/z 420, could be identified. The mass spectra of horse and fetal bovine serum are shown in Figure 3a Table 2 . The appearance of an intense linoleic peak in the horse serum spectrum and its almost complete absence in the spectrum of the fetal bovine serum agrees with reported concentrations of this acid in the two blood sera [26] . The total concentration of FFAs in horse serum and fetal bovine serum are 0.49 and 0.35 mol/mL, respectively [26] . The identity of each lipid moiety was verified by running pure standards, product ion scans of the molecular ions, and comparisons with the NIST database. The relative intensities of the cholesterol and FFA ions were enhanced by using 358°C Curie-point wires preferentially to higher temperature wires. The lower pyrolysis temperature helped reduce the contribution made by other components less volatile than the lipid compounds. Meuzelaar and Huff [27] reported the detection of cholesterol and long chain aliphatic fragments in human white blood cells using 358°C Curiepoint wires. Their spectra were generated by pyrolyzing the sample on the wire, removing the spent wire from the quartz sample tube, and then reheating the condensate that formed on the inside of the quartz sample tube. The spectra displayed in this report were all generated by direct pyrolysis from the Curie-point wire. This technique is simple in practice and unique because underivatized fatty acids are rarely employed for taxonomic studies [28] . Molecular ions for the FFAs were observed within the first 5 to 20 scans of the pyrogram (100 total scans). After this period, the absolute intensity of these ions decreased quickly to the point that they were no longer detectable. Evidently the initial rapid surge in temperature caused distillation of the intact FFAs, but as exposure time to the heat increased, so did thermal degradation of the fatty acids. Evidence of this effect was observed for the m/z 386 to m/z 368 peak ratios of cholesterol. In the first part of the pyrogram the relative intensity of m/z 386 exceeds m/z 368, but the opposite is true in the later part of the pyrogram. The two major sources of lipids in cell culture media are lipoproteins carried in the blood serum and the plasma membranes of the host cells. The mass spectrum generated by a standard mixture of bovine plasma lipoproteins is shown in Figure 4a . Cholesterol and FFA ions can easily be identified in this mass spectrum. Vero cells were analyzed in order to determine if lipid ions could also be detected for eukaryotic host cells. The cells were isolated and washed in water to remove the complete growth media and then resuspended in saline solution prior to analysis. The mass spectrum of the isolated cells is shown in Figure 4b ; peaks for cholesterol and the FFAs can be identified in this spectrum. The detection of the host cell lipids is important for cell lines that can be grown successfully on serum-free media. The use of such cultures would effectively eliminate the rich source of lipids carried in the blood serum. The Vero cells analyzed in Figure 4b were grown and maintained on a medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum. Lipids from the blood serum are incorporated, without modification, and used directly by the • Monolayer cells used to propagate viruses • Viruses • Complete growth media Ⅲ Growth and maintenance media (EMEM) Ⅲ Blood serum supplement Ⅲ Antibiotic-antimycotic Supernatant from infected cell culture media: • Cellular fragments from lysed cells • Viruses • Complete growth media cells so that the respective lipid profiles are expected to be comparable [29] . The mass spectra of fetal bovine serum (Figure 3b ) and the isolated Vero cells do show similar relative intensities for the cholesterol and FFA ions. Media collected from cell cultures used to propagate viruses were reexamined for lipid biomarkers in the m/z 210 to m/z 420 mass range. The spectra of FECV and VEE infected cell culture media are shown in Figure  5a , b. The supernatant, recovered from these two cell cultures, represent crude viral preparations anticipated to be encountered in field scenarios. Both media show very intense mass spectral peaks corresponding to cholesterol and free fatty acids. FECV was cultured in a growth medium supplemented with horse serum. As expected, the mass spectrum from the FECV infected medium is largely reflective of the horse serum ( Figure  3a) . Likewise, the mass spectra of the VEE medium (supplemented with fetal bovine serum) and fetal bovine serum (Figure 3b ) are comparable. Chicken egg embryos are sometimes utilized to propagate viral strains not easily grown in cell cultures. The egg itself is injected with the virus and incubated for a specified amount of time required to grow the virus. The mass spectrum of allantoic fluid recovered from a chicken egg infected with Influenza A virus is presented in Figure 6a . The ions of cholesterol and the FFAs are clearly visible in the spectrum of the allantoic medium. Because of the ubiquitous presence of cholesterol and FFAs in animal cell cultures, their presence in an aerosol sample could provide a fast and simple method for detecting media commonly used to propagate viruses. Cholesterol, in particular, is an excellent candi-date biomarker for the detection of cell culture media by Py-MS because it produces intense molecular and fragment ions. The corresponding mass spectral peaks of cholesterol are easily discernable and provide a rapid scheme for differentiating eukaryotic cell cultures from prokaryotic culture media. Cholesterol is not generally found in media used to cultivate bacteria or in the bacteria themselves. Figure 6b shows the spectrum of Yersinia pestis grown in trypticase soy broth. No cholesterol ions are observed in this mass spectrum. Purified viral preparations may also be encountered in the field. This issue was briefly addressed by examining purified mouse hepatitis viruses; the spectrum is displayed in Figure 6c . Peaks corresponding to choles- terol are present in the MHV mass spectrum. Cholesterol is known to be incorporated into the lipid membranes of MHV during intracellular virus assembly [30] . The cholesterol biomarker can thus be used to detect the presence of both purified and nonpurified viruses.
