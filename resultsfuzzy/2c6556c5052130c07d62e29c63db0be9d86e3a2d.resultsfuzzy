The United States produced a total of 11.5 million tonnes of beef during 2016, making it the number one beef producer in the world (USDA, 2017a). Beef cattle operations represented a total of 93.6 million cattle as of January 1, 2017, in the United States (USDA, 2017b). In 2016 the calf crop in the United States was estimated at 35.1 million cattle, and all cows and heifers that have calved represented 40.6 million cattle according to the 2016 USDA Cattle report (USDA, 2017c) . Currently, there are less than 32 million head of beef cows widely dispersed throughout the United States on over 720,000 farms and ranches (USDA, 2017c) . The cow-calf operation is considered the first stage of the beef production process, and it takes slightly over 2 yr from the time cows and heifers are bred until their offspring are ready for slaughter (Comerford et al., 2013) . As of 2012, there were almost 728,000 cow-calf operators in the United States according to the most recent Census of Agriculture (USDA, 2014) . Although cow-calf operations are spread across the United States, the top 25 cow-calf operations during 2015, ranked by number of cows, were located in Florida, Texas, Wyoming, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Missouri, and New Mexico (NCBA, 2015) . Texas was the state with the greatest number of beef cows and calves under 205 kg and the largest calf crop (4.5, 2.0, and 4.3 million, respectively; USDA, 2017c) for 2016; however, 9 out of the top 25 cow-calf operators in the country were in Florida during 2015 (NCBA, 2015) . An increase in preventative healthcare and management measures among beef cow-calf operations in the United States has been the result of an integrated proposal that advocates to improve health, performance, and profitability for the beef industry. These recommended programs, commonly referred to as preconditioning or backgrounding, focus on optimal cow herd nutrition and health, early castration and dehorning, anthelmintic treatment, proper and timely vaccinations for calves, and the weaning of calves 30 to 45 d before shipping (Kirkpatrick et al., 2008) . Preventative programs that reduce compounded stress have been shown to reduce incidence of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in the feedlot (Cole et al., 1979; Roeber et al., 2001) and improve ADG in the preconditioning period (Bolte et al., 2009) and the finishing phase (Peterson et al., 1989) . Table 1 provides general information and demographics of participating veterinary practitioners including states where they practice, proportion of their practice dedicated to cow-calf producers, years in practice, and number of beef cows serviced. A total of 148 veterinary practitioners responded to the survey, with most participants providing a response to the majority of questions. Responding veterinarians represented 35 states in the United States and 3 provinces in Canada. In the United States, 11% of veterinarians practiced in Kansas; 10% in Nebraska and Iowa; 6% in Oklahoma and South Dakota; and 5% in Missouri, Minnesota, and Texas (the remaining states represented less than 5% of total responses). In Canada, veterinarians practiced in Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec, but these represented less than 5% of the total response. Over 50% of responding veterinarians devoted more than 50% of their practice to service commercial cow-calf producers ( Table 1 ). The largest group (33%) of veterinarians had been in practice for over 30 yr. However, 26% of responding veterinarians had been in practice for only 0 to 5 yr. Similarly, Coetzee et al. (2010) reported that almost half of veterinarians (45.5%) participating in a castration method survey had been in practice for over 20 yr, and the second largest group of participating veterinarians (15%) had been in practice only 1 to 5 yr. More than 10,000 cows were serviced by 39% of these veterinarians' practices, whereas 25% of veterinarians serviced 5,000 to 10,000 cows each.
