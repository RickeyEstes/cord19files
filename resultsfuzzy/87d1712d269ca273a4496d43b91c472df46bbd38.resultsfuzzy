The mutual interference of substituent effects and the intramolecular hydrogen bond in a set of 4-and 5substituted salicylaldehyde derivatives (see Scheme 2) was analyzed. The energetic characteristics concerning the coupling of the substituent effect and the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds was performed using two approaches considered at two levels of computations (B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) and MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ): (1) Analysis of composition of the total energy of interaction, E tot , for H-bonded systems perturbed by substituents. (2) Analysis of SESE for homodesmotic reactions for substituted salicylaldehyde and appropriate disubstituted benzene derivatives: 4-substituted benzaldehyde and 4-substituted phenols (substituent: OH and NO 2 ). Two of the four possible conformations of salicylaldehyde (see Scheme 1) and its derivatives were considered in the study. Conformation (I) presented in Scheme 1 was found to be the most stable in many studies, e.g., [11] , whereas the open conformation, labelled (II) in Scheme 1, was necessary for the analysis presented in this study. Table 1 summarises all the data concerning the strength of intramolecular H-bonding, where the studied systems are presented in sequence from the strongest down to the weakest, taking into account the overall energy of the Hbond, E tot . Almost the same order was found in the case of "pure" H-bonding energy, E HB . The only difference with respect to the sequence used in Table 1 concerns salicylaldehyde and its 5-nitro derivative, but the difference in the E HB value was very small (amounts to 0.03 kcal mol −1 ). The same was found for E tot , so one can draw the conclusion that the nitro group in the meta position with respect to the CHO acts similarly to hydrogen. Note that E tot indicates as the most stable systems those in which a strong through-resonance effect is present: the para positions of CHO/OH and OH/NO 2 (i.e., 4-OH-or 5-NO 2 -salicylaldehyde, respectively). These systems are more stable by ∼1 kcal mol −1 than complexes with substituents of the same kind: para positions of OH/OH and CHO/NO 2 (i.e., 5-OH-and 4-NO 2 -salicylaldehyde, respectively). This kind of regularity is also observed for Hbond energies, E HB , but the difference between those with and without through-resonance is smaller, ∼0.6 kcal mol −1 . For the E del the effect is even smaller, being equal to ∼0.3 kcal mol −1 . The above mentioned data are from B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) computations, but a similar picture can be drawn from MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ calculations. It can be concluded from the data in Table 1 that the substituent effect on E tot , E HB and E del is rather small. The variability of E HB due to the substituent effect is also rather small (in the range of 0.98 kcal mol −1 ), slightly smaller than that of E tot (in the range of 1.56 kcal mol −1 ), indicating resistance of H-bond interaction on perturbation stemming from substituents in the ring. Note that E del , which is identified with changes in π-electron delocalization in the studied system, amounts to about 20% of E tot . A deeper insight into the intramolecular substituent effect gives an energetic characteristic of homodesmotic reactions (1), (2) and (3) (see Schemes 3, 4, 5, and The obtained SESE data are specified in the same sequence as in Table 1 . Positive values of SESE indicate greater stability of substrates, whereas negative values are products of the homodesmotic reaction. The influence of the substituent on the formyl and hydroxyl groups-participants in the intramolecular hydrogen bond-is seen in the first reaction (1; see Scheme 3 and data in the second and third column in Table 2 Table 1 ) we find immediately that the substituent effect, which is energetically substantial, acts very weakly on the total energy of Hbond formation as well as on the H-bond energy itself. Two remaining homodesmotic reactions for salicylaldehyde and its derivatives (presented in Schemes 4, 5, and S1-S5 in Supporting Information, and data in Table 2) show another aspect of the substituent effect on H-bond formation. The range of SESE values for the I.2 reaction (closed) is 3.42 kcal mol −1 . In this case the substituent interacting via a through-resonance effect (OH group) is para in relation to the CHO group involved in H-bond formation. It may be compared with the range of SESE values for reaction I.3 (closed) which is 5.27 kcal mol −1 . Note that, in this case, the substituent interacting via a through-resonance effect (NO 2 group) is para with respect to the OH group involved in H-bond formation as a proton donating group. Thus, energetically, the substituent effect due to the intramolecular charge transfer from the paracounter substituent (NO 2 ) to the proton-donating group (OH) is ∼35% greater than for the interaction of the para-OH with the proton-accepting group (CHO). This may suggest that, due to intramolecular charge transfer, the proton-donating component of H-bonding is more sensitive to the substituent effect than the proton-accepting one. A weaker H-bonding in 5-nitro-salicylaldehyde than in 4hydroxy-salicylaldehyde (Table 1 ) explains the obtained SESE value for meta-nitrobenzaldehyde (−1.95 kcal mol −1 , Table 4 ).
