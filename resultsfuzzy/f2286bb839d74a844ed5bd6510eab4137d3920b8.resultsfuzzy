During the study period, 74 children and adolescents with underlying hematological malignancies who experienced 93 episodes of respiratory illnesses were enrolled. Nine and five patients each experienced two and three episodes, respectively. The median interval between recurrent episodes of respiratory illnesses was 19 weeks (range, 5-52 weeks). Group I included 46 (49.5%) episodes of RVI, including 31 (67.4%) URIs and 15 (32.6%) LRIs. Eleven (73.3%) of the 15 LRIs were initially diagnosed with URIs that progressed to LRIs. Among the identified RVs, rhinovirus (N=17, 37.0%) was the most frequent ( Table 1) , followed by parainfluenza virus (N=14, 30.4%) and RSV (N=10, 21.7%). In five (10.9%) episodes, two viruses were concurrently identified: two (4.3%) episodes of rhinovirus and parainfluenza virus, two (4.3%) episodes of rhinovirus and RSV, and one (2.2%) episode of RSV and influenza A virus. Co-infections were identified in 21 (22.6%) episodes. Ten (10.8%) episodes were accompanied by bacteremia (Escherichia coli in two, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in two, viridans streptococci in two, Enterococcus faecium in two, Streptococcus pneumoniae in one, and Staphylococcus epidermidis in one). Eight (8.6%) episodes were accompanied by invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and two (2.2%) episodes were accompanied by herpetic gingivostomatitis. Chickenpox, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and Clostridium difficile infection accompanied one (1.1%) episode each. The rate of RV positivity was highest in autumn; however, no significant differences were found among the four seasons (range, 31.6-61.5%, p=0.258). Seven RSV infections occurred within a one-month interval in the same ward, six (85.7%) of which were hospitalacquired infection. Comparison between Group I and Group II. The rates of different underlying hematological malignancies and administered chemotherapies preceding respiratory illnesses were not significantly different between the two groups. Significantly more patients in Group II presented with hospital-acquired respiratory illnesses (p=0.003), and accompanied neutropenia (p=0.028) than those in Group I ( Table 2) . Most patients overall complained of fever and cough; however, those in Group I complained of rhinorrhea (p<0.001) and sputum (p=0.008) more frequently than those in Group II. In multivariate analysis, rhinorrhea, sputum, and community-acquired respiratory illness were significant factors for a diagnosis of RVI ( Table 3) . Significantly more complications occurred in patients in Group II compared to those in Group I ( Table 2) . Mortality was higher in Group II than that in Group I; however, the difference was not statistically significant.
