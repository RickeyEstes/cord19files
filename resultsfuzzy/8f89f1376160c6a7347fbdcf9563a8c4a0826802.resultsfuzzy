The interpretation of virologic data must be based on knowledge of the normal viral flora in the site sampled, the clinical findings, and the epidemiologic behavior of viruses. In some situations, serologic studies may be necessary to support or refute the possible association of a virus isolate with a disease. Viruses in Tissue and Body Fluids. In general, the detection of any virus in host tissues, CSF, blood, or vesicular fluid can be considered highly significant. Recovery of viruses other than CMV in urine may be diagnostic of significant infection-for example, mumps virus and adenovirus type 11, associated with acute hemorrhagic cystitis. However, recovery of CMV from urine can also be difficult to interpret. The CMV isolate may merely reflect active, asymptomatic virus replication or may indicate a significant infection in the patient. Viruria in the first 3 weeks of life establishes a diagnosis of congenital CMV infection, whereas the onset of viral excretion after 4 weeks of life reflects intrapartum or postpartum infection. Diagnosis of acquired CMV infections in older patients usually results from a combination of findings, including positive cultures from any site, illness known to be compatible with CMV, reasonable exclusion of other potential etiologic agents, and support by specific serologic or histologic data or both. Virus Isolation from Other Sites. Upper respiratory tract (or specimens obtained by traversing the upper airways), vaginal, and fecal cultures vary greatly in terms of their significance. At one extreme, isolates such as measles, mumps, influenza, parinfluenza, and RSV are very significant, because asymptomatic carriage and prolonged shedding of these viruses are unusual. Conversely, other viruses can be shed without symptoms and for periods ranging from several weeks (enteroviruses) to many months (adenoviruses, HSV, CMV). Examples include HSV and CMV in the oropharynx and vagina, adenoviruses in the oropharynx and intestinal tract and enteroviruses in the intestinal tract. VZV, HSV, CMV, adenoviruses, and EBV may remain latent for long periods and then become reactivated in response to a variety of stressful stimuli, including other infectious agents. In this setting, their detection may have no significance (VZV is an exception) or may merely represent a secondary problem complicating the primary infection (for example, HSV "cold sores" in patients with bacterial sepsis). Adenovirus isolates are common in infants and young children. Based on the epidemiology and observed serological responses, it has been found that. in febrile and res~iratorv svndromes, simultaneous isolation of these , , agents from both the throat and feces has greater probability of association with that illness; isolation from the throat, but not the feces, has a lesser probability of association, and isolation from the feces has the least diagnostic significance. In these latter situations, interpretation of the significance of the culture results can be aided by adenovirus serologic studies. Enteroviruses are also most commonly found in infants and children, particularly during the late summer and early autumn seasons. A knowledge of the relative frequency of virus shedding among various age groups in a particular locale is extremely helpful in assessing significance of results of throat or stool cultures; for example, the peak prevalence of enteroviruses in the stools of toddlers during the late summer may range from greater than 20 per cent in subtropical climates to 5 per cent in temperate zones. Even in the latter areas, carriage rates may approach 30 per cent in infants during periods of enterovirus activity. Shedding of enteroviruses in the throat is relatively transient (usually 1 to 2 weeks), whereas fecal shedding may last 4 to 16 weeks. Thus, in a clinically compatible illness, isolation of an enterovirus from the throat supports a stronger temporal relationship to the disease than does an isolate from only the feces. When echovirus or coxsackievirus is recovered from the stool only, it may be helpful to study the patient's serum for an antibody rise against that particular viral isolate. HSV is unusual in a fecal culture: in such cases, it usually represents . A either severe disseminated infection br infection of the anus or perianal
