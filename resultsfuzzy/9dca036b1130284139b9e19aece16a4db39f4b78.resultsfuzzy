Given the problems with inappropriate sampling and handling and lack of standards for these new techniques, what can be said regarding interpretation of test results? There is no question that molecular medicine has dramatically revolutionized infectious disease diagnosis, treatment, and especially biosecurity. In the long run, molecular-based assays are more efficient and allow for minimal exposure of laboratory personnel and veterinarians to many infectious agents. 11 Ultimately, nothing will take the place of isolation of an infectious agent as confirmation of active infection from a properly collected and handled sample, but the efficiency and accuracy with good sampling and laboratory standardization make testing strategy of PCR diagnostics the most common in the future. Given that sampling, handling, and all quality assurance for a particular laboratory are reliable, one must understand what a positive or a negative genomic-based test means. For instance, a positive PCR test result means that nucleic acids that belong to the genome of that particular pathogen were detected in the sample. This agent may or may not be live, infectious, or capable of replication in that sample. At least three different scenarios may be occurring in regard to the sample tested: (1) the pathogen is present and directly is causing the clinical signs observed, (2) the pathogen is present but is not responsible for the clinical signs observed, or (3) the pathogen is not present but the reaction mixture is binding to some other target in the assay. By the same token, a negative sample has failed to detect the nucleic acids of the infectious agent. A negative result can reflect at least three different scenarios in regard to the sample tested: (1) the pathogen was absent at the time of testing, (2) the pathogen is present but not detectable within the limits of sensitivity, and (3) there was some type of inhibition of the positive reaction. The mere results cannot be interpreted without understanding the context in which testing was performed in the first place unless this is used for regulatory purposes. In the absence of case criteria, the results by themselves are not confirmatory for disease causation. This is especially true for negative tests-hence repeated sampling is recommended should the case criteria create a high degree of suspicion for that disease. In the end, a comprehensive investigation using multiple samples employing different detection formats may be the only way to confirm disease causation in an outbreak or new emergence of disease in a group of animals. There is no "magic bullet" when it comes to testing.
