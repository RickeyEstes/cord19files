All the descriptive results from the questionnaire are available in Supplemental Table S1 (https: / / doi .org/ 10 .3168/ jds .2019 -16578). We identified limited significant associations between the studied calf management practices and the outcome variables in the univariate linear regression, and these failed to achieve significance at the multivariate level. Therefore, only the descriptive questionnaire results and the pilot study data are presented and discussed.
