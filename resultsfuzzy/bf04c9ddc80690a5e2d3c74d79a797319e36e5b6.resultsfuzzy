We use a previously benchmarked GRAMM-X 15 to obtain the initial PFN1-P10 binding structures to determine the binding modes. The rigid docking algorithm is suitable for PFN1-P10 based on the root mean square displacements (RMSDs) of PFN1 and P10 during the MD simulations (see below). Figure 1 shows the top 10 docked protein-protein structures ranked by the prediction scores from mode1 to mode10 (most stable to least stable) as well as the crystal structure mode11 (PDB ID: 1AWI) added for completeness. Note that the co-crystal structure binding mode was predicted by GRAMM-X (mode9). We then analyzed interfacial residue binding for all 11 binding modes. By the proximity of the binding interfaces, we divided them into 4 categories. Category I (mode1, mode2, mode8) consists of a mostly hydrophobic binding interface on PFN1 (here we refer to PFN1 only All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Category II (mode3, mode6, mode10) utilizes a mixed hydrophobic/hydrophilic binding interface, consisting of Y24, K25, D26, S27, P28, D41, T43, P44, A45, E46, V47, G48, V49, V51, G52, K53, D54, S57, F58, N61, G62, L63, T64, and G67 (37.5% hydrophobic). Category III (mode4, mode5, mode7) is also featured by a mixed hydrophobic/hydrophilic binding interface, but consisting of a different set of residues Y59, S61, V72, I73, R74, D86, R88, A95, P96, T97, N99, E116, G117, V118, H119, G120, G121, N124, and K125 (31.6% hydrophobic). Finally, Category IV (mode9, mode11) makes the use of the binding groove from the crystal structure between the N-terminal α helix and C-terminal α helix, mainly contributed by G2, W3, N4, Y6, D26, S27, S29, W31, H133, L134, S137, and Y139 (41.7% hydrophobic). Since both the highest scores mode1 and mode2 are in Category I, GRAMM-X seems to prefer a more hydrophobic binding interface for PFN1-P10, although it also picks out mixed binding interfaces, including the co-crystal binding interface -mode9 in Category IV. These 11 binding modes are used as the starting points for the binding free energy calculations with umbrella sampling, as well as MD simulations and SMD simulations. In the following sections we will explore these different methods in an effort to go beyond the normal (rigid) protein-protein docking for a better ranking of the binding strengths for the 11 binding modes. Based on Jarzynski's inequality 44 , the experimental atomic force microscopy (AFM) method has proven capable of recovering the binding free energies of complicated systems such as proteindrug complexes. 45 Concurrently, substantial efforts have been applied to adjust and optimize SMD to obtain accurate binding free energies computationally using the same inequlaity. [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] Note that even though the original Jarzynski's inequality does not require a working threshold of the rupture rate, it was largely accepted the slower the rate is, the more accurate the results will be. 47 In general, there are limitations in using SMD for free energy calculations due to insufficient sampling sizes; however, it is still worth comparing SMD to other PPI methods.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/418830 doi: bioRxiv preprint Without applying the optimization suggested for calculating binding free energies, here we test the applicability of using SMD as a fast method to rank the docked structures of PPI pairs such as PFN1-P10. We compare constant velocity SMD simulations with different pulling speeds (1 nm/ns and 0.1 nm/ns) to the properties acquired from MD simulations (RMSDs and IEs). The basic protocols of SMD can be found in the Methods section. The integrated work curves are shown in Figure S6 , Figure S7 . The maximal forces and rupture works are listed in Table S1 . With the simplest first order cumulant expansion approximation, we calculated the average rupture works from 10 replicas of SMD simulations for each of the PFN1-P10 binding modes. The rupture works calculated from two rupture speeds (1nm/ns and 0.1 nm/ns) both correlate well with the PMF differences (Figure 4 A, Figure 4 C), where R 2 is 0.49 for 1 nm/ns SMD, and 0.67 for 0.1 nm/ns SMD. The absolute values of rupture works from 0.1nm/ns SMD (<-15 kcal/mol) are closer to the PMF differences (see Table S1 for details), compared to the range (-10 ~ -30 kcal/mol) from 1 nm/ns SMD. This is in agreement with previous practice on free energy estimations from SMD simulations. 47 For our purpose, instead of following the common sense of "the slower the better" in the field (0.01 or even 0.001 nm/ns), we use a relatively fast rupture speed (1 or 0.1 nm/ns) to rank the docked structures. For example, each simulation only takes ~2.5 ns or ~25 ns for SMD with 1nm/ns or 0.1nm/ns rupture speed, respectively. This means that from 2.5 ns×10 replicas = 25 ns of simulations in total, a trend in PMFs can be predicted by SMD with high confidence, as compared to the 50 ns of MD simulation sampling a local well on the free energy landscape, or 20×20 = 400 ns of umbrella sampling for numerous binding modes from one PPI pair. Moreover, the replica numbers can be reduced to 6 to reach a comparable R 2 (see Figure S8 A, Figure S8 B) which further decreases the total simulation time to 15 ns (for 1 nm/ns SMD). A correlation between AFM maximal forces and binding constant was reported in a cell adhesion study 54 and an antibody-antigen unbinding study 54 . Here we investigate how maximal forces from SMD (with a much faster rupture rate) correlate with the PMFs. With two rupture rates, R 2 is calculated to be 0.53 for 1 nm/ns SMD, and 0.21 for 0.1 nm/ns SMD, respectively. Dependent on the separation pathway selected on a free energy landscape, overall maximal forces are unsatisfactory for predicting the trend of binding free energies.

In Figure S9 , we compare how the 5 properties (average RMSDs from MD over the first 50ns, maximal forces from two sets of SMD, and rupture works from two sets of SMD) rank the 11 binding modes as compared with PMFs. The correlation coefficients between the ranks are similar compared to the correlation coefficients between the absolute values ( Figure S9 A-E), ruling out the "clustering effect" of the data (meaning the ranks may be interchangeable when absolute numbers are close). In Figure S9 F, we list the most stable binding modes predicted from the 5 metrics. Interestingly, mode7 is the most stable binding mode for 4 out of 5 metrics except for the rupture work (from 1 nm/ns SMD) where mode4 (in Category III along with mode7) is predicted to be the most stable. The ranks of mode11 are reliable except for maximal forces (from 0.1 nm/ns SMD). The ranks of mode9 are also high in the list but may be affected by its structural flexibility seen in the MD simulations. Notably, the top ranks derived from the rupture works from SMD correspond well to the most stable binding structures obtained from the umbrella sampling, indicating that this technique could provide a fast and reliable way of ranking the PPI binding modes from the protein docking programs such as GRAMM-X.
