Cloning and sequence analysis A total of 21 overlapping cDNA fragments were generated by RT-PCR cDNA cloning to encompass the entire RNA genome. The oligonucleotide primer sets used for these amplifications are listed in Table 1 . The 5′ and 3′ end of the genome were determined by 5′ and 3′RACE, respectively. This resulted in a genome sequence of 31,076 nt including a poly A tail of 38 nt. The genome encodes 10 ORFs characteristic of Group 2 BCoV and 5′ and 3′ untranslated sequences of 210 and 298 nts (which do not include the poly A tail), respectively (Fig. 1 ). The ORF coordinates are shown in Fig. 1 . The predicted ORF 1a and ORF 1ab contained 13,152 and 21,282 nt, respectively ( Fig. 1) . ORF 1ab contains a 26 nt region that overlapped with ORF 1a and included a predicted 'slippery' sequence UUUAAAC. Based on evidence from other coronaviruses (Chouljenko et al., 2001b) , this sequence causes a − 1 frameshift during the translation of ORF1a. This results in a portion of the proteins (called ORF 1ab) avoiding translation termination and containing an additional 2711 amino acids. Upstream of five of the genes, there is a repeated intergenic sequence, UCUAAAC, that is predicted to interact with the viral transcriptase along with cellular factors to 'splice' the leader sequence onto the start of each ORF. ORF-NS1, HE, S, M and N were all preceded by this sequence (Table  2) , which would be predicted to give rise to a nested set of mRNAs characteristic of the order Nidovirales.
