3.1. Detection of SARS 6 protein in SARS-CoV infected patients and cells By immunohistochemical staining, SARS 6 protein was detected in pneumocytes of the lungs and surface enterocytes of terminal ileum from eight SARS autopsy cases (representative data shown in Fig. 1A and C) . Immunohistochemical signals were positive only in those tissues in which virus could be isolated [9] . No positive signals were detected in the corresponding tissues from ten non-SARS cases ( Fig. 1B and D) . It is known that lung and small intestine are the primary targets of SARS-CoV infection [10] . Our results confirmed that the hypothetical SARS 6 protein indeed existed and expressed in lung and intestine tissues of SARS-CoV infected clinical patients. To further confirm the expression of SARS 6 protein in SARS-CoV infected cells, Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV CUHK-W1 strain (GenBank Accession No. AY278554) followed by immunohistochemical staining. The results showed that SARS 6 protein was detected in SARS-CoV infected cells but not in non-infected control cells. Fig. 2A and 2B provides photographic details consistent with previously described observations [9] .
