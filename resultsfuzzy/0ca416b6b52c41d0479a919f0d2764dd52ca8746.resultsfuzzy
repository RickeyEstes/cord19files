The airflow fields indoors and outdoors, the air change rates (ACHs) of the lower and upper floor, and the ratio of the gaseous pollutant concentrations between the floors have been discussed in an earlier publication [5] . In the pure-buoyancy driven case, the ACHs through the windows are highest for both floors. A gentle approaching wind of 1.0 m/s normal to the window has very little influence on the ACH. However, 4.0 m/s wind could lower the ACH by 30-50% by suppressing the buoyancy force. In the windless situation, 7.5% of the air leaving from the window of the lower floor can re-enter into the upper floor. 1.0 m/s wind deflates the plume emitted from the lower window into the upper window, resulting in a higher re-entry ratio (10.9%). But 4.0 m/s wind confines the convection of air and thus reduces the ratio to 3.5%. The particle concentrations are calculated based on the airflow conditions in Gao et al. [5] . their ratio for 1.0 mm particles are close to the values of CO 2 . The results of 10.0 and 20.0 mm particles differ from the 1.0 mm particle remarkably. Different from gaseous pollutants, two factors constrain the cascade effect of coarse particles: the particle' gravity which counteracts with the upward buoyancy force and the deposition at solid surfaces. The latter one is a self-cleaning mechanism of particles which contributes to the decreased suspended concentrations in the lower floor and the reduced outlet concentrations. For an approximate estimation of particle' settling effect, the ratio of two time scales is indicative: the time required by the particle to settle down across the room height and the time needed to refresh the total volume of room air once [31] . For the current air change rate of 7.2-10.1 h Ã€1 , the ratio of the falling time of 2.7 m (room height) for particles larger than 15 mm to the air change time is comparable. As wind speed increases from 0.1 to 4.0 m/s, the windward airflow field simulated by the k-e model becomes more diffusiondominated. The ratio of particle concentration in the upper floor to that in the lower floor decreases. In case of 4.0 m/s, the ratio is 0.3% for 20.0 mm particles. It implies that in the design of ventilation and air distribution systems, the indoor air speed level is essential to determine the suspension of particles in the room air. Air at higher speeds could entrain larger particles, and even makes deposited particles re-suspended. Although, according to the deposition model by Lai and Nazaroff [25] , high friction velocity in the boundary layer will also increase the deposition velocity, this effect is negligible for particles larger than 2.5 mm because deposition onto the upward facing surfaces caused by gravitational force constitutes most of the overall deposition. The ratios predicted from the DRW model are much less than those predicted from the drift-flux model. In spite of the different definitions of the ''ratio'' in the two approaches, excluding the factor that some particles may enter into the upper floor and then move out of the same floor through the window, the particulate mass in the upper floor predicted by the DRW model is still lower than that by the drift-flux model. Fig. 8 shows that the discrepancy becomes large for fine particles, and small for coarse particles. For a close view of the results from the DRW model, Table 2 gives the numbers of deposited particles in both flats. Even for 1.0 mm particles, more than 70% of the particles have been predicted to be absorbed by the inner surfaces of the lower flat. This result is obviously irrational. Therefore in current settings, the application of the DRW model may falsely give us an overoptimistic result with regard to the upward transport of viruses by natural ventilation airflows. In the best case when wind velocity is 4.0 m/s, three out of 8000 particles of 20.0 mm can get into the upper floor. In terms of infection risk, this may still be indicative, given that one infected person may sneeze several times and one sneeze produces more than one million particles [37] . In principle, the Lagrangian method has an advantage to track the trajectory of each particle. Fig. 9 shows the locations of 500 representative particles at various times after their generations. In less than 3 min, particles could enter the space of the upper floor. This may well explain the epidemiologic findings that the SARS virus was found within the deposits on the window-sill above the room whose host was infected during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong.
