Peptide networks were approximately scale-free Scale-free network topologies have node degree distributions following the power law [37, 38] . There is a continuous range of node degrees, with the fewest nodes having the greatest number of connections [37, 38] . We found that peptide networks share this topology ( Figure 3 ) and have biologically informative graph properties similar to those found in gene co-expression networks (See descriptive network statistics in Table 1 ). With regard to distinct and significant modules, the SARS network contained 14 modules ranging from 65 to 369 peptides, with a mean size of 133.9 peptides. The Influenza network contained 6 modules, with sizes ranging Figure 2 Utility of de novo network inference in resolving peptide level discordance. Protein sub-networks constructed using peptide topological overlap show correlated clusters. Taken together, some proteins show conflicts between constituent peptides, where given a variable such as time, some peptides are increasing in abundance and other decreasing (A). To examine this, only proteins with uniquely mapping peptides were used. A protein sub-network is constructed by taking associated peptides, and keeping only edges with topological overlaps in a specified upper quantile (e.g. the upper 20% of all topological overlaps for the protein). In all three data sources, as the edge threshold is raised, the number of connected components with discordant peptides dramatically decreases (B, C). This suggests that inference of protein abundance can be guided by network topology. from 56 to 327 peptides and a mean size of 141.3 peptides. The sarcopenia network contained 19 modules ranging in size from 36 to 477 peptides, with a mean size of 142. 25 peptides. An initial examination indicates that low to moderate levels of missing data did not negatively impact the model fit ( Figure 3 ). Importantly, we note that all of the identified de-novo modules have significant connectivity with the exception of the sarcopenia network, which contained one module without significant connectivity (p-value 0.33).
