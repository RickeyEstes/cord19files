For each health outcome, we present a brief summary of the conclusions and identified data/research gaps from the HSA, to clarify the baseline it established between climate change and these outcomes, before presenting the results from the recent literature. The results of the HSA were published in Environmental Health Perspectives. The executive summary was published in 2000 (Patz et al. 2000) and the results from the individual health outcomes assessed were published in 2001 Greenough et al. 2001; Gubler et al. 2001; McGeehin and Mirabelli 2001; Rose et al. 2001 ). In addition, described the process and products of the HSA. Temperature-related morbidity and mortality. For the HSA, McGeehin and Mirabelli (2001) assumed that an increase in global average temperatures would increase the severity and frequency of heat events and the morbidity and mortality attributable to these events. The authors concluded that this would result in a net increase in temperature-related morbidity and mortality because any ameliorating impact of increasing temperature on winter mortality rates would not be great enough to offset the projected increase in mortality attributed to heat events. The data gaps identified (McGeehin and Mirabelli 2001) included the need to determine the significance of changes in alternative measures of temperature (e.g., daily minimum, daily maximum) on the risk of experiencing an adverse health outcome and the need for research on increases in morbidity during extreme temperature events. Of particular interest was research on the efficacy of heat response plans. The authors also noted that further research is needed on effective urban design to mitigate heat retention and urban heat islands, to facilitate adaptation planning. Finally, they noted that the development and widespread adoption of standard methods for recording heat-attributable health outcomes would greatly aid epidemiologic investigations and increase public awareness of these risks. The substantial research into the morbidity and mortality impacts of temperature completed since the HSA has mostly confirmed the initial conclusions. Comprehensive literature reviews (e.g., Basu and Samet 2002) continue to conclude that elevated temperatures increase the risks of morbidity and mortality, that these risks vary by location, and that a number of socioeconomic factors (e.g., age, poverty) can affect an individual's health risk during a heat event. Other publications (e.g., Greene et al. 1999; Smoyer et al. 2000) continue to build evidence for site-specific relationships between combinations of meteorologic conditions and increased daily mortality through synoptic climate modeling studies. Similarly, a number of studies (e.g., Curriero et al. 2002; Davis et al. 2003a Davis et al. , 2003b ) support prior conclusions regarding the existence of regional differences in the vulnerability of U.S. populations, with populations in the northeastern and north-central regions at the highest risk. Few new studies evaluated the projected impacts of climate variability and change on the frequency and severity of future heat events. Patz and Lindsay (1999) supported the HSA conclusion that the future is likely to bring an increase in the frequency of excessive heat events, and Meehl and Tebaldi (2004) projected that future heat waves would be more frequent and intense and would last longer. In contrast, Robinson (2001) argues that, by definition, the future frequency of excessive heat events should not change because these events are defined based on comparisons to typical conditions (i.e., only some percentage of summer days can have "excessive" heat conditions within a given time frame). Although this does not address whether the typical conditions in these events may change over temporal and geographic scales, Robinson suggests that if the frequency of exceeding a particular temperature threshold increases, the threshold should be revised for defining excessive heat events. However, this does not address the possible situation of temperatures exceeding the capacity to adapt or the fact that different population subgroups (e.g., outdoor vs. office workers) may have different definitions of what excessive heat is. Several recent studies (e.g., Davis et al. 2002 Davis et al. , 2003a Davis et al. , 2003b ) examined U.S. trends in mortality attributable to elevated temperatures at several locations. Collectively, these studies argue that there has been a declining trend in heat-attributable mortality in U.S. cities from the 1960s through the 1990s, although important regional differences remain (e.g., elevated mortality in northeastern and northern interior cities). An interpretation of these results is that estimates of future temperatureattributable mortality that fail to account for this trend, and instead use some central tendency estimate, will overestimate the mortality impact of future heat events. These studies can be viewed as an argument that there is an adaptive trend in the United States that will minimize the future health impacts of extreme heat events and that climate change will have little impact in shaping future mortality in U.S. cities (Davis et al. 2004 ). Sheridan and Dolney (2003) reported results contradicting the HSA's conclusion that residing in urban areas elevated one's health risks during heat events, partly as a result of the urban heat island effect. Sheridan and Dolney (2003) failed to find a statistically significant difference in the percentage increase in daily mortality and the level of urbanization using data from Ohio for 1975-1998. Although not conclusive as a single result, the study identifies a relevant area for future research on shaping adaptive responses by drawing attention to the risks faced by rural populations during heat events. Two studies (Hennessy 2002; Keatinge and Donaldson 2001) focused on how the impacts of temperature and air pollutant concentrations are controlled for in epidemiologic models. The authors' reviews found no clear bias in previous studies. Their general conclusions were that care needs to be taken in modeling these relationships because temperature and pollution levels are often highly correlated, and controls for each need to be incorporated into models to avoid overstating impacts for one of the factors. With respect to the data gaps initially identified, there has been research into the efficacy of extreme heat response plans. Ebi et al. (2004) , Palecki et al. (2001) , and Weisskopf et al. (2002) concluded that heat response plans have most likely helped reduce the incidence of heat-attributable mortality. In addition, significant research into the role that urban design plays in determining urban temperatures has been completed through efforts such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Urban Heat Island Reduction Initiative (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2006). There is ongoing research as to how best to characterize and model the health risks posed by meteorologic conditions (e.g., synoptic climate approaches or the use of specific meteorologic measures). Although specific criteria have been established to determine when a death may be attributable to extreme heat (Donoghue et al. 1997) , little progress has been made in having these criteria widely adopted. Health effects related to extreme weather events. Greenough et al. (2001) reviewed the literature on the potential health impacts of changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather as a result of climate change and provided detailed descriptions of the health risks associated with floods and storm surges, tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts, and fires. The authors concluded that increases in the frequency and severity of extreme precipitation would directly affect flooding and increase the incidence of associated adverse health outcomes. There was less certainty about the health impacts of changes in other extreme weather events that would be attributable to climate change. The main research needs identified centered on improving regional data and projections of the future frequency and severity of extreme events. In addition, Greenough et al. (2001) noted a need for more epidemiology studies of the long-term impacts of extreme events and more accurate assessments of vulnerability and adaptation strategies. Many of the recent publications summarized the health impacts and explored the successes and failures of warning and response systems for specific extreme weather events, particularly tornadoes and hurricanes. We identified no new publications that estimated changes in the future frequency and severity of extreme events in the United States. Kunkel et al. (1999) reviewed trends in extreme events in the United States but stopped short of making projections. Similarly, Pielke and Downton (2000) found that flooding in the United States might have increased, whereas Easterling et al. (2000) found increases in minimum temperatures and extreme precipitation that may have increased the number of deaths from flooding and excess heat. Blindauer et al. (1999) examined the range of health outcomes associated with the potential health impacts of blizzards. Their conclusions confirmed the finding that blizzards elevate the incidence of myocardial infarction (i.e., heart attacks). Several studies (Curriero et al. 2001; Hunt 2002; Kistemann et al. 2002) examined the potential health impacts of extreme precipitation events, focusing on their potential to affect contaminant loading to water systems. The results are summarized further below. A large number of publications evaluated in the second screening step focused on the short-and long-term mental health effects of extreme events [e.g., increases in diagnoses of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following severe floods or hurricanes]. Although the mental health impacts of these events were described as "controversial" in Greenough et al. (2001) , further research has confirmed that extreme events can increase PTSD (e.g., Hajat et al. 2003) . Publications in this general area were not reviewed given resource constraints. As noted in the HSA, projecting the number and intensity of extreme weather events in climate models must improve to refine estimates of the potential health impacts of these events. Continued research and development of regional climate models that have much higher grid cell resolution (e.g., 50 km 2 ) than general circulation models (with a resolution typically of several hundred square kilometers) holds promise for enhancing future regional scale forecasts of extreme weather events. Health effects related to air pollution. In the HSA, concluded climate variability and change were likely to increase health risks from increased fungal growth and particulate-transported fungal spores. For the other airborne pollutants, particularly ozone and particulate matter, the authors concluded that it was uncertain how future pollutant concentrations would respond to climate change. Ambient concentrations of air pollutants generally are the result of the interaction between meteorologic conditions, natural systems, and human activities. The net effect on human health was uncertain because uncertainty exists with respect to the magnitude or nature of change in one or more of these components (e.g., changes in the hydrologic cycle, winds, mixing heights, human response). Identified research gaps included the need for development of sophisticated meteorologic models that can estimate chemical and spatial relationships, specific meteorologic variables, and future locations and nature of human activities (i.e., anthropogenic emissions). In addition, the recurrent need for more regionally appropriate output from climate models was cited. In our review, we identified no publications that credibly challenge long-standing conclusions that increases in the concentration of airborne pollutants would increase morbidity and premature mortality. This general conclusion is consistent with the increase in the range of nonfatal outcomes that have been associated with changes in air pollutant concentrations and expansions in the populations viewed as being at risk. As an example, an area of ongoing regulatory interest and active research concerns the potential for exposure to ambient air pollutants to increase the incidence of low-birth-weight deliveries (e.g., Chen et al. 2002; Ritz and Yu 1999; Wilhelm and Ritz 2003) ; research results in U.S. study populations are inconclusive. Recent studies examined the potential impact of climate variability and change on airborne allergen concentrations and reached conclusions similar to those of that increased CO 2 and higher temperatures generally increase the growth rate of allergen-producing plants (e.g., ragweed) and the production of pollen (Ziska and Caulfield 2000; Ziska et al. 2003) . D' Amato et al. (2001) also concluded that air pollution might facilitate the penetration, and the depth of penetration, of allergens into the lungs, thus increasing the risk of these allergens. Additional studies explored the impacts of climate change on urban heat islands and their Climate change and health impacts in the United States Environmental Health Perspectives • VOLUME 114 | NUMBER 9 | September 2006 effects on ambient concentrations of ozone. Taha (2001) projected increases in peak ozone concentrations in Los Angeles and Sacramento, California, by linking output from general circulation models to future emissions inventories and the air pollution models used to evaluate air quality compliance. Related research examined the effect on ambient ozone concentrations of measures to reduce urban heat islands. Sailor (2003) , Taha (1997) , and Taha et al. (2000 Taha et al. ( , 2002 found modeling changes in urban albedo and vegetative cover both increased and decreased ozone concentrations, depending on the location and scenarios considered. The divergent results reflect the strong influence in these models of assumptions about a number of factors affecting ozone formation and resulting ambient concentrations, including the direction of prevailing winds, photochemical mixing, and reaction heights following the implementation of albedo and vegetation changes designed to address the urban heat island. These uncertainties highlight some of the difficulties in projecting future pollutant concentrations under different climate change scenarios. The overall conclusions from recent research support the HSA's conclusions that climate variability and change are likely to affect ambient air pollutant concentrations, but the direction and magnitude of the change remain uncertain. Water-and food-borne diseases. In the HSA, Rose et al. (2001) concluded an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme precipitation events attributed to climate change would increase the risk of contamination events, which would increase the risk of waterand food-borne illnesses. Although several factors affected this result, critical elements included the increased transport of diseasecausing organisms during extreme precipitation events and limits in the existing infrastructure for conveying and treating wastewater and sewage to avoid contamination events (e.g., problems with combined sewer overflows). Critical research needs identified in the HSA included improved capacity and coordination of disease surveillance systems to accurately quantify the burden of food-and water-borne disease in the population, further evaluation of local contaminant source-receptor relationships to aid risk assessments, and identification of adaptation alternatives. As with other health outcomes assessed, a critical data gap was the need to improve regional models of climate variability and change at a spatial scale that could be incorporated into regional/national health impact models (e.g., local hydrologic models). Recent studies examining the potential impacts of climate variability and change on the risks and incidence of water-and foodborne illnesses strongly support the conclusions of Rose et al. (2001) that the risk of water-and food-borne illness will likely increase with climate change. Specifically, Curriero et al. (2001) and Kistemann et al. (2002) found that extreme precipitation events increase the loading of contaminants to waterways, and Casman et al. (2001) concluded that climate change could increase the risk of illness associated with Cryptosporidium parvum. D'Souza et al. (2004) addressed the relationship of food-borne illness in response to changes in ambient temperature in Australia and found an association between increases in the lagged monthly mean temperature and increases in the number of notifications of salmonellosis infections in five Australian cities. The authors also noted that following current food preparation and storage recommendations could offset any climate change-induced increase in risk. Additional research is needed to clarify the burden of water-and food-borne illnesses on a pathogen-specific basis and to better understand the associations between these illnesses and ambient temperature to project potential increases in risk attributable to climate change. Vector-and rodent-borne diseases. In the HSA, Gubler et al. (2001) were uncertain about the cumulative impacts of climate change on vector-and rodent-borne illness because of limitations in the available climate models. Some of the climate scenarios projected that the temperature threshold for ticks that carry Rocky Mountain spotted fever in the southeastern United States could be crossed with increasing temperatures, potentially leading to more cases. Gubler et al. (2001) also expressed uncertainty about the impacts of climate change on rodent-borne illnesses because of a lack of available research and because of the potentially different impacts that could result from climate change as opposed to increased climate variability; the latter could result in population explosions and crashes that could increase disease risk. For mosquito-borne illnesses, Gubler et al. (2001) concluded that increasing average temperatures would generally reduce the U.S. population's susceptibility to epidemics, assuming increased amounts of time would be spent indoors in air-conditioned environments. However, Gubler et al. (2001) also noted that an increase in the frequency and severity of water-related extreme weather events (i.e., floods and hurricanes) could alter existing conditions governing human-mosquito interactions in large parts of the United States, potentially increasing mosquitohuman contact. The research needs identified in the HSA focused primarily on developing a better understanding of the populations of mosquitoes, ticks, and rodents and their sensitivity to shortand long-term fluctuations in their habitats. In addition, the need for additional information regarding the dynamics of disease transmission to humans was viewed as a critical element in assessing vulnerability and identifying adaptation strategies. These needs reflected a lack of understanding of how recent and historical climate variability has affected the incidence of vector-borne diseases. Only a limited number of recent studies address the potential response of vector-and rodent-borne illnesses to climate change in the United States. These studies focus almost entirely on the possible impacts on host populations and generally support the findings of the HSA. Specifically, McLean (2001) and Subak (2003) concluded that conditions associated with climate variability and change could increase tick populations and the incidence of Lyme disease. Zeil (2004) reported an association between the increased climate variability associated with the El Niño events and rodentborne outbreaks of hantavirus. However, Kovats et al. (2001) and Zeil (2004) cautioned that with natural reservoirs in animal populations, the emergence or reemergence of diseases involves complex interactions. Therefore, care should be taken when attributing an increased incidence of vector-and rodent-borne illnesses to climate variability and change. These cautions highlight the continued need to improve understanding of the population dynamics of the various vector and rodent populations that can transmit illnesses to humans.
