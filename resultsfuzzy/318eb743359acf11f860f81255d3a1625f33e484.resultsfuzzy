In these previous studies compounds possessing an activated double bond revealed covalent, but reversible binding to the cysteine residue of the respective protease. In addition to the structural modifications implemented in previous work [16, 17] , namely within the compounds 1, 2, 8-21, we now included fluoro-substituted compounds 3-7, several analogues without an activated double bond 25-32, as well as derivatives with polar side chains 22-23, and finally, a biotin-labeled inhibitor 24. In summary, the structure of etacrynic acid was modified as follows (Scheme 1): A: substitution pattern of the aromatic ring, B: esters and amides, C: ortho-position of the double bond containing side chain (cpd. 2), D: removal of the double bond. The inhibitors were synthesized according to previously described pathways [16, 17] which are summarized in Scheme 2. Halogen substituted anisoles were subjected to Friedel-Crafts acylation yielding the corresponding phenolic ketones. Further alkylation of the phenolic hydroxyl functions yielded amides 28, 30 -32, and esters 1, 9 and 29. Introduction of the double bond was performed either by Mannich reaction with TMDM ( 3, 6, 7) or by aldol condensation with formaldehyde ( 4, 8). The latter yielded the free acids 4 and 8 due to concurrent hydrolysis of the ester function. The free acids were coupled to various amides to give the amides 5, 10 -24. Amides 26 and 27 without activated double bond were also synthesized by standard amide coupling methods.  Br-CH 2 -CO 2 R K 2 CO 3 , KI Recombinant falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 were produced as previously described [14, 18] . Inhibitory activities against recombinant falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 were evaluated in fluorometric microplate assays using the substrates Cbz-Phe-Arg-AMC and Cbz-Leu-Arg-AMC (AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) [19] . The cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 was used as a positive control [20] . The solvent DMSO was used as negative control. Compounds 1-6, 8-11 and 13-28 were tested in vitro against the CQ-sensitive 3D7 P. falciparum strain or the CQ-resistant W2 P. falciparum strain. IC 50 values are shown in Table 1 . The in vitro data for the etacrynic acid derivatives are compared to those of the well known drug chloroquine and to E-64. In addition, the cytotoxicity of the inhibitor 23 was studied on human kidney epithelium cell-line 293T, as described previously [21, 22] , resulting in an IC 50 value of >160 μM. Inspection of the data in Table 1 allows the following conclusions to be drawn: in general, the etacrynic acid derivatives are weak or moderate inhibitors of falcipains and P. falciparum. Nevertheless, some structure-activity relationship can be found: The ethyl ester derivative (9) is more potent than the etacrynic acid (8), both against falcipain-2 and -3. This is in accordance with the results for papain and the SARS-CoV M pro . The dichlorosubstituted compounds (e.g. 9, 20) are better inhibitors than the mono-chloro-(e.g. 1) or fluorosubstituted (6) compounds, with one exception, namely inhibitor 5 (compared to 18). The α,ßunsaturated system appears to be favourable for activity against falcipains when comparing the analogous dichloro-compounds 20 and 27 or compounds 18 and 26. Short voluminous moieties such as the tertbutyl moiety of compounds 5, 28, 29, seem to be advantageous if combined with the fluorosubstituted aromate. In these cases, the activated double bond is apparently not essential for inhibition. Nearly all etacrynic acid amides show better inhibition properties than the free acid (8) . A longer acidic side-chain significantly enhances the activity (23, compared to 20, 21), making 23 the most active inhibitor of falcipains and P. falciparum within the series. However, insertion of an additional acidic group (e.g. 22) diminishes the inhibiting activity. The cytotoxicity/antiplasmodial ratio for the most active compound 23 is >8.5, indicating selectivity against the parasite. As the data against the target enzymes and the parasites do not correlate in all cases (e.g. 14), the question arises whether there are additional or other targets. In order to allow further affinity binding studies the biotinylated dichloro-substituted etacrynic acid amide 24 was included and synthesized according to the methods recently described [17, 23] (Scheme 2). Notably, this compound emerged as the most potent inhibitor of falcipains and P. falciparum within the series.
