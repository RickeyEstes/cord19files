Most of the infectious disease surveillance networks have based their strategies on the management of results generated by microbiology laboratories [21] [22] [23] . The different experiences at local and international levels have increased the efficiency of this process. The clinical laboratory should ensure sufficient internal data management resources and a substantial database storage capacity, as well as adequately developed computing equipment and protocols. Internal microbiology software should permit the automatic alert of unusual results, and detection of increased trends and accumulation of cases. These systems must be flexible and accessible to other computing systems in order that microbiology data can be integrated in regional, national and international databases. Again, experience in this area is based on resistance surveillance with the active participation of microbiologists.
