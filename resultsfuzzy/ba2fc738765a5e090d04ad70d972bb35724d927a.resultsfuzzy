Of the 209 collected blood samples (Table 1) hippoboscid flies tested positive for the presence of Haemoproteus. Although based on a limited sample size, the estimated prevalence of great frigatebirds infected with Haemoproteus parasites was comparable to other studies on frigatebirds, usually ranging from 30% to 56% [2] . No difference was observed between adults (36%618%) and chicks (35%621%) (chi-squared test, P.0.05). Additionally, no relationship was detected between the age of the chicks and the infection status (Student's t-test, P.0.05). Blood films examinations did not led to the observation of parasites of any blood stages, suggesting an extremely light parasite load. Genetic analyses support that the detected Haemoproteus parasite was closely related to Haemoproteus iwa previously detected in frigatebirds in the Pacific Ocean and in the Caribbean Sea (Figure 1 ), in Hawaii, the Pacific coast of Panama, the Cayman Islands and the Galapagos Islands [5] , as well as Mexico [20] and Christmas Island [7] . Haemoproteus sequences derived from this study were 100% identical to each other and had a perfect match to Haemoproteus iwa detected in frigatebirds in other geographic locations; however, as this was based on a limited alignment (478 bp), we cannot determine whether or not the apparent low genetic diversity of this parasite resulted from the limited length of nucleotide sequences available in public database. Genotyping of other genes such as the caseinolytic protease C encoding gene [4] [5] could provide conformation on the putative parasite species and also reveal the potential genetic diversity of Haemoproteus iwa on Europa and among distant bird populations, worldwide. Our findings support a large geographic distribution of Haemoproteus iwa associated with frigatebird breeding sites. Longdistance migrations may favor Haemoproteus parasites exchanges between breeding colonies. Based on satellite telemetry, Weimerskirch et al. [21] showed that a great frigatebird moved 4400 km from Europa to their roosting sites in Maldive Islands. More recent tracking studies conducted on great and lesser frigatebirds (Fregata ariel) from Europa have confirmed that both species disperse widely after breeding. One Lesser frigatebird tracked for about four months during the postbreeding migration crossed the entire tropical Indian Ocean from Europa to Indonesia, reached the Indonesian Sea via the Sunda strait and continued flying East up to the Salomon Island (Le Corre et al. in preparation), suggesting that frigatebird populations of the Pacific and Indian Ocean are interconnected. Combined with the study of frigatebird migrations, population genetic studies may provide new insight on parasite dispersal between oceanic islands. Although the absence of Haemoproteus in boobies has been described before [5, [22] [23] , the lack of positive detection in redfooted boobies on Europa is particularly surprising given the geographic proximity and interactions with frigatebirds. Redfooted boobies are nesting inside the frigatebirds colony, sometimes on the same tree (Matthieu Bastien, personal observation). In spite of this mixing with frigatebirds nesting sites, no hippoboscid flies were found on boobies, suggesting a strict host-vector specificity which could in turn explain the absence of Haemoproteus infection in red-footed boobies on Europa. Genetic analyses also revealed that hippoboscid flies sampled from great frigatebirds on Europa were closely related to Olfersia spinifera in the Galapagos Islands ( Figure 2 ). Flies collected on Tromelin on the two booby species were genetically related to Olfersia aenescens sampled on blue-footed boobies (Sula nebouxii). This finding further supports some level of specificity between the hippoboscid flies and their vertebrate hosts, as recently suggested by Levin and Parker [6, 11] . Although masked and red-footed boobies on Tromelin were heavily infested with hippoboscid flies (Matthieu Bastien, personal observation), none of the collected samples tested positive for the presence of Haemoproteus, supporting that birds and/or hippoboscid flies (Olfersia aenescens related species) on Tromelin may not be competent for the transmission of Haemoproteus iwa or alternatively that the parasite is not prevalent on Tromelin. In contrast, one of the eleven Hippoboscid flies sampled on frigatebirds on Europa tested positive for Haemoproteus iwa (Figure 1 ), supporting that this hippoboscid fly species is actually involved in parasite transmission. Our genetic analyses also supported that the Plasmodium we detected in a great frigatebird on Europa was genetically related to Plasmodium species identified in a large range of hosts (herons, penguins, kites) and geographic locations (Figure 3 ). Although the exact placement of the Plasmodium on the phylogenetic tree could not be resolved, this result nevertheless suggests that haemosporidian parasites other than Haemoproteus may be transmitted in seabird populations in the Western Indian Ocean. Plasmodium detection in seabirds is uncommon [2] , potentially because of the absence of competent vectors in marine and coastal environments [3] . On Europa, however, the presence of a mangrove habitat favors the maintenance of notoriously dense populations of several mosquitoes species, including Culex sitiens [24] , vector of Plasmodium juxtanucleare [25] . The peculiar host and vector species diversity found on Europa could favor parasite transmission as compared to oceanic islands such as Tromelin that are characterized by limited species richness and abundance. Future investigations are needed to determine if Plasmodium is actually transmitted by mosquitoes on Europa or if frigatebirds could be infected elsewhere during their foraging trip, or before their arrival on Europa for breeding. The complete host and geographic distribution of this parasite in the islands of the Western Indian Ocean also remains to be identified.
