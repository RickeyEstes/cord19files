SYBR green-based one step RT-qPCR was performed to generate a standard curve, using 1:10 serially diluted standard RNA templates. The results indicated that the standard curve had a wide dynamic range (10 1 -10 7 copies/reaction) with the high linear correlation (R 2 = 0.9999) between the cycle threshold (Ct) value and template concentration ( Figure 4A ). The slope of the standard curve was −3.297. The amplification efficiency of the RT-qPCR assay was 102.3%, according to the slope of the exponential phase in the amplification chart ( Figure 4B ). Melt curve analysis showed amplification of a specific product with a melting peak at 78.31 °C ( Figure 4C ), which was confirmed by the agarose gel electrophoresis analysis. Amplification was not observed in the non-template control. RNA extracts from samples were analyzed in duplicate reactions. Quantification of the viral RNA copies was possible if the Cq values of both reactions fell within the LDR of the RT-qPCR assay. Samples with a specific melt curve were considered positive but not quantifiable when the Cq value of the reactions fell at Cq values higher than the lowest peak of the LDR.
