All the inhibition results were listed in Table 1 . Similar to APN, MMP-2 is also a zinc-dependant metalloproteinase that involved in tumor invasion and metastasis. Thus the assay was performed on both of APN and MMP-2 so as to identify the compounds selectivity. Bestatin was used as the positive control. Almost all the compounds except 5a, 5c, 5i, 5v and 7b showed better activities against APN than MMP-2. For example, 5q with an IC 50 (MMP-2)/ IC 50 (APN) ratio equals to 65.8, while 5s equals to 46.3. The result, to a certain extent, confirmed our strategy for designing APN inhibitors. This possibly descript from the differences between the structures of two enzymes, leading to different requirements for their respective inhibitors. APN is a membranebound zinc exopeptidase that catalyzed the removal of NH 2 -terminal amino acid from the peptide, while MMP-2 is a zinc-dependent endopeptidase that could cut the peptide to parts from the specific amino acid residue of the peptide. The former L-lysine derivatives and 3-phenylpropane-1, 2-diamine derivatives designed by our group to inhibit APN all showed better activities against MMP-2. 16, 18 So L-arginine derivatives are more suitable for APN inhibitors. Comparing 5a-d and 5e-w, we could find that the compounds contained substituted phenyl groups have better activities than those contained unsubstituted phenyl groups. Among compounds 5e-w, we can conclude that the compounds contained two substituted groups on phenyl group have more potent activities than others. The most active compounds 5q and 5s both contain bi-substituted phenyl group. It is worth mentioning that the 2,4-dichlorobenzyl moiety of 5q was also effective in the precious L-lysine derivatives. 16 The possible reason might be that the 2,4-dichloro substituted benzene ring could accommodate the hydrophobic site of APN suitably, suggesting it is a potential moiety for APN inhibitors. From compounds 7a,b, we could confirm that the compounds contained sulfonyl groups showed equal activities against APN and MMP-2. That coincides with the fact that some sulfonyl groups containing compounds our group had synthesized before showed better MMP-2 inhibitory activities. 19, 20 The most active compounds are 5q and 5s (IC 50 = 5.3 and 5.1 lM), which have comparable activity with bestatin (IC 50 = 3.8 lM). 5o, 5t and 5l also have considerable activities (IC 50 = 15.9, 14.6 and 16.5 lM, respectively). In order to investigate the interaction of our compounds with APN, the most active compound 5s was constructed with Sybyl/ Sketch module and optimized using Powell's method with the Tripos force field with convergence criterion set at 0.05 kcal/(Å mol), and assigned with Gasteiger-HÜckel method. performed using Sybyl/FlexX module, the residues in a radius of 7.0 Å around Bestatin in the co-crystal structure (PDB code: 2DQM) were selected as the active site. Other docking parameters implied in the program were kept default. From Figure 2 , we can see the backbone of 5s inserted to S 1 pocket, the hydroxymate of 5s interacted with the zinc ion of APN and the 4-bromo-3-nitro benzamide side chain extended to S 0 1 pocket. For a further and detail understanding of the binding mode of 5s with APN, a 2D picture was also created with the program LIGPLOT. In Figure 3 , we can see the backbone of 5s could form hydrophobic contacts with Glu 121 , Met 260 and Tyr 376 of S 1 pocket and form hydrogen bond with Glu 121 by the imine of guanidinium group. The two oxygen atoms of hydroxymate chelated with the zinc ion of APN. The carbonyl of amide in R position could form hydrogen bond with Gly 261 and Ala 262 of S 0 1 pocket. The R substituted side chain of 5s could form hydrophobic contact with Gly 261 of S 0 1 pocket. While, the nitro group at the aromatic ring could form hydrogen bonds with Arg 783 and Arg 825 . Although the computed information partially supported our assumption, the exact binding mode of the L-arginine derivatives with APN should be obtained from further X-ray crystal studies.
