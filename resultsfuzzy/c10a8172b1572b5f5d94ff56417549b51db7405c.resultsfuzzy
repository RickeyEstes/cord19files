Differential mRNA splicing of the IFNL4 gene produces three protein-coding isoforms termed IFNL4P107, IFNL4P131, and IFNL4P179 based on the number of amino acids encoded ( Fig. 1 A) . To test their individual activities, we overexpressed IFNλ4p107, IFNλ4p131, and IFNλ4p179 isoforms and IFNλ3, all tagged with C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) in Huh7 cells. Overexpression was verified by immunoblot using α-HA and α-IFNλ4 antibodies (Fig. 1 B) . As the α-IFNλ4 antibody was raised against a peptide encoded in exon 2, this antibody only detects IFNλ4p131 and IFNλ4p179 isoforms. However, α-HA detected equal expression of all IFNλ4 isoforms and IFNλ3 in the whole-cell lysate. By immunoblotting, we detected two bands in the lysates for IFNλ4p131, IFNλ4p179, and IFNλ3 ( Fig. 1 B) . These bands usually arise from differential glycosylation, a posttranslational modification that is coded for, and which a majority of IFNs and cytokines require for, efficient se-cretion and stability. To test if the higher molecular weight bands reflect glycosylated forms of IFNλ4p131, IFNλ4p179, and IFNλ3, we treated the overexpression cell lysates with PNGase F and immunoblotted with α-IFNλ4 and α-HA. We observed that the higher molecular weight band was reduced, indicating that IFNλ4p131 and IFNλ4p179 were glycosylated ( Fig. 1 C) . Although two bands were detected for IFNλ3, PNGase F failed to reduce the higher molecular weight band, suggesting a non-N-glycosyl modification for IFNλ3. IFNs require secretion from the cell to engage with their cognate receptors at the cell surface and activate Jak-STAT signaling. To test if the IFNλ4 isoforms were secreted into the supernatant, we performed immunoblots on supernatants, both before (neat) and after concentration by tricholoroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation ( Fig. 1 D) . When IFNL isoforms were overexpressed, we documented secreted IFNλ4p179 and IFNλ3 in both neat and TCA-treated supernatants. However, we did not detect IFNλ4p107 or IFNλ4p131 (Fig. S1 A) . These data suggest that IFNλ4p179 and IFNλ3 are released extracellularly, whereas IFNλ4p107 and IFNλ4p131 are retained intracellularly. The supernatants containing IFNλ4p179 or IFNλ3 proteins were then subjected to PNGase F treatment. The higher molecular weight band of IFNλ4p179 was reduced to a lower molecular weight, suggesting that the secreted proteins are also glycosylated ( Fig. 1 E) . Another nonsynonymous variant of IFNL4 (Pro70Ser; rs117648444) exists that changes Proline to Serine at position 70 of the IFNλ4 protein (Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013; Terczyńska-Dyla et al., 2014) . This SNP results in lower activity of IFNλ4, presumably caused by changes in the protein structure, and has been associated with improved spontaneous HCV clearance and better treatment response in patients with ΔG at rs368234815 (Terczyńska-Dyla et al., 2014) . We also tested the secretion of IFNλ4p179 S70 (P70S) in comparison to IFNλ4p179 (P70) after expression of both variants in Huh7 cells and found that the S70 variant is secreted less efficiently ( Fig. S1 A) . Furthermore, expression of IFNL4P179 S70 (P70S) results in a lower ISG response compared with the IFNL4P179 P70 variant, as measured by MX1 quantitative PCR (qPCR; Fig. S1 B) . Overall, in our overexpression system, the glycosylated form of IFNλ4p179 is efficiently secreted out of the cell, the P70 variant more than the P70S variant, whereas IFNλ4p107 and IFNλ4p131 are predominantly intracellular. IFnλ4 signals exclusively through the extracellular IFnλr1-IL-10r2 receptor complex Similar to other type III IFNs, IFNλ4 is thought to signal through its cognate heterodimeric receptor composed of IFNλR1 and IL-10R2 subunits (Hamming et al., 2013) . Type III IFNs evolved from a common lineage with IL-10 family cytokines, many of which feature alternative receptor usage. Because IFNL4 shares this lineage and has low sequence identity with other type III IFNs (Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013) , we examined if IFNλ4 could also signal through a different IL-10 family receptor. We coexpressed the IFNL4 isoforms and IFNL3 together with a luciferase reporter downstream of an IFN stimulated response element (ISRE) in Huh7 wild-type and IFN LR1 −/− cells. We expressed the IFNL4 isoforms and IFNL3 in Huh7 cells. Cell supernatants were then transferred to Huh7 wild-type and IFN LR1 −/− cells expressing a luciferase reporter downstream of an ISRE. We found that expression of IFNλ4p179, the only secreted isoform, and IFNλ3 strongly induced ISRE luciferase reporter activity in wild-type Huh7 cells, whereas the nonsecreted IFNλ4p107 and IFNλ4p131 were inactive ( Fig. 1 F) . ISRE luciferase reporter activity was completely abrogated in IFN LR1 −/− Huh7 cells, suggesting that IFNλR1 was necessary for ISG induction by IFNλ4p179. To further test if IFNλ4 signals through extracellular IL-10R2, we blocked the receptor using a neutralizing αIL-10R2 antibody and coexpressed IFNλ4p179 or IFNλ3 together with the ISRE luciferase reporter. IL-10R2 blockade decreased ISRE luciferase reporter activity for both IFNλ4p179 and IFNλ3 ( Fig. 1 G and Fig. S1 C) . Lastly, downstream signaling via MX1 induction was completely abrogated in IFN LR1 −/− cells upon stimulation with IFNλ4p179 ( Fig. 1 H) . These data not only confirm that IFNλ4 requires both IFNλR1 and IL-10R2 chains, but also shows that it signals through this extracellular heterodimeric receptor complex.
