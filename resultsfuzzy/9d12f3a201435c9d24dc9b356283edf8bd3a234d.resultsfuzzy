Increase of Il-17 + CD4 + Th17 cell proportion following CD11c hi DC ablation in lymphoid tissues and the CNs during Je progression We previously showed that CD11c hi DC ablation exacerbated JE progression and resulted in the under-maturation of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes and enhanced permeability of the BBB (18, 19) . Here, we hypothesized that JE was exacerbated in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice through additional mechanisms such as abnormal infiltration and/or maturation of lymphoid and myeloid leukocytes related to pro-and anti-inflammatory processes. Since the roles and quantities of CNS-infiltrated CD4 + Th cell subsets, including IFN-g + Th1, IL-17 + Th17, and Foxp3 + Tregs, have been not defined, we decided to examine changes in CD4 + Th cell subsets in the spleens and brains of CD11c hi DC-ablated mice during JE progression. Interestingly, our data revealed that CD11c hi DC-ablated mice showed a higher frequency of IL-17 + CD4 + Th17 cells in spleens at 5 dpi, but IFN-g + CD4 + Th1 cells showed no change in frequency (Fig. 1A) . The accumulation of IL-17 + CD4 + Th17 cells in spleens was more apparent in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice; CD11c hi DC-ablated mice contained fewer IFN-g + CD4 + Th1 cells in their spleens (Fig. 1B) . In addition, CD4 + Foxp3 + Treg cells were detected at a lower frequency in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice during JE progression (Fig. 1C) , and CD11c hi DC-ablated mice had fewer CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs in their spleens (Fig. 1D) . These data suggest that the altered balance of CD4 + Th cell subsets (IL-17 + Th17 and IFN-g + Th1 cells) and regulatory CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs may contribute to the exacerbation of JE in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice. Furthermore, the frequency and total number of infiltrated IL-17 + Th17, IFN-g + Th1, and Foxp3 + Treg cells were determined in the CNS at 5 dpi. As expected, IL-17 + CD4 + Th17 cells were detected at higher levels in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice ( Fig. 1E and F) . However, CD11c hi DC-ablated mice showed a higher frequency and absolute number of IFNg + CD4 + Th1 cells in the CNS, which contrasted with the results from the spleen. This discrepancy may be caused by CNS-infiltration of CD4 + Th1 cells from the spleen that is considered reservoir. Therefore, enhanced CNSinfiltration of Th17 and Th1 cells seems to contribute to the exacerbation of JE in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice. In support of this, vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice showed higher proportion of CNS-infiltrated CD4 + Foxp3 + Treg cells (both frequency and total number) than CD11c hi DCablated mice (Fig. 1G and H) . This imbalance in Th17 and regulatory Treg cells that infiltrated the CNS resulted in a higher ratio of Tregs to Th17 cells in vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice, compared to that in CD11c hi DCablated mice (Fig. 1I) . Moreover, we examined the expression of transcription factors associated with the differentiation of CD4 + Th cell subsets in CD4 + T cells sorted from the brain. As expected, CD4 + T cells from the brains of CD11c hi DC-ablated mice showed higher levels of IL-17 and RORgT in the CD4 + Th17 cell subset and T-bet in the CD4 + Th1 cell subset, whereas Foxp3 expression in Tregs was lower (Fig.  2) . In conclusion, CD11c hi DC ablation causes an imbalance in Th17, Th1, and Treg CD4 + cell subsets during JE progression, thereby contributing to the exacerbation of JE. CD11c hi DC ablation causes fewer ly-6C lo monocytes to accumulate in lymphoid tissues and the CNs during Je progression Myeloid-derived leukocytes in the CNS may be responsible for inducing pro-and anti-inflammatory changes, which can lead to significant pathological outcomes during JE progression. Monocytes and macrophages are important contributors and/or regulators of immunopathological progression. Typically, two principle subsets of murine monocytes are identified, based on the expression of lymphocyte antigen 6C (Ly-6C) (20) . Inflammatory/classical monocytes are Ly-6C hi CCR2 hi CX 3 CR1 lo/int , whereas patrolling/ non-classical monocytes are Ly-6C lo/int CCR2 -CX 3 CR1 hi (20) . In a previous study, we showed that CD11c hi DC ablation caused abnormal differentiation of inflammatory CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes during JE progression, contributing to the exacerbation of JE (18) . Therefore, we were interested in the changes in CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes, but not CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes, during JE progression in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice. CD11c hi DC ablation increased the proportion of inflammatory CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in spleens during JE progression, whereas CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes decreased in CD11c hi DCablated mice, compared to those in vehicle-treated
