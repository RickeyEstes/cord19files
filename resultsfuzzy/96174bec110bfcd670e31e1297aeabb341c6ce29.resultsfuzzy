As shown in Figure 1 , the airways of rats exposed to SO2 for three weeks contained numerous mucous (goblet) cells. These were similar to those seen in human chronic bronchitis [2] . Secretions adhering to the apical surfaces of airway epithelial cells were also present in SO2exposed, but not SPF control rats (Fig. 1) . In order to monitor mucin mRNA levels in the airways of experimental and control rats, it was necessary to identify a mucin eDNA that hybridized with rat mucin mRNA. At the time we began our studies, mucin cDNAs had been isolated from eDNA libraries constructed from the human intestine [10] , pig submaxillary [11] , and human mammary [12] , [13] , [14] glands. The similarity between the amino acid compositions of intestinal and airway mucins [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] led us to test the feasibility of using an intestinal cDNA for our studies. Our initial studies revealed a high degree of homology between mucin mRNAs in the intestine and the airway of man [19] . Using the intestinal mucin cDNA SMUC 41 as a probe, we isolated HAM-l, a close homologue of SMUC 41 containing threonine-and proline-rich tandem repeats, from a human airway eDNA library [19] . Although we initially expected the human airway mucin eDNA to be more favorable for probing rat airways than the human intestinal mucin eDNA, the larger size of SMUC-41 made it more favorable. Using SMUC-41 in Northern blots, we probed RNA from two rat mucin-secreting organs (intestine and airways), and used RNA from a non-mucin secreting organ (heart) as a negative control. In Northern blots, the intestinal (Fig. 2) and airway (Fig. 3 ) signals were polydisperse, a distinguishing feature of mucin mRNA [10] [19] [20] corresponding to polydispersity in the size of nascent [21] and deglycosylated [18] mucin peptides. The integrity of the RNA was confirmed by reprobing blots with a beta actin eDNA (Figs. 2 and 3, lower panel). RNA from the heart and airways of specific pathogen-free rats was negative ( Figure 2, and D lanes, Fig 3) . The airway negativity is consistent with studies showing the paucity of mucous cells and mucin glycoprotein in the airways of specific pathogen-free rats (Fig 1, control, [22] , [23] ) as well as in healthy dogs [24] , [25] and humans [26] . The failure of SMUC-41 to hybridize to RNA from SPF rat airways was conspicuously reversed when rats were housed in the Animal Colony under non-pathogen-free conditions and exposed for 1-3 weeks to SO2 (Fig. 3 , C lanes) or air alone (Fig.3, A lanes) . Serum from each rat was tested (see Table) for the presence of antibodies directed against PVM, Sendai virus, Corona virus, KRV, Toolan H-l, M. pulmonis, and CAR Bacillus. We found that all rats with significant antibody titers for Sendal virus [27] , [28] , [29] (Fig. 3) showed mucin hybridization signals. SPF rats (Fig. 3 , D lanes and the bronchus lane in Figure 2 ) as well as those infected by another pathogen (i.e. Corona virus, Fig. 3 , B lanes) did not. Mucin hybridization signals obtained from airway RNA of Sendai virus-infected rats that were exposed to SO2 for 1 wk showed signals more intense than those from rats with infection alone (Fig. 3, C lanes) .
