A phylogenetic tree including 124 dsDNA viruses is shown in Figure 1 . Apparently, despite numerous horizontal gene transfer among large DNA viruses [13] , our analysis is able to divide the 124 dsDNA viruses into 10 families with only 4 outliers, CuniNPV, IIV-6, IcHV-1 and OsHV-1 (see Additional file 1: 124 large dsDNA virus names, abbreviations, and NCBI accession numbers for viruses names, abbreviations and accession numbers). Phylogenetic relationships of all 124 dsDNA viruses coming from 33 genera, 10 families are well consistent with the taxonomy by ICTV [1] and other phylogenetic studies [9] with few exceptions. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2a supports the division of this family into four genera. It is notable that the two genera, Atadenovirus and Siadenovirus, which both comprise viruses from a variety of hosts locate between another two genera, Mastadenovirus whose hosts are mammals and Aviadenovirus whose hosts are birds. This variety of host origin supports the hypothesis that interspecies transmission, i.e. host switches of adenoviruses, may have occurred [29] .
