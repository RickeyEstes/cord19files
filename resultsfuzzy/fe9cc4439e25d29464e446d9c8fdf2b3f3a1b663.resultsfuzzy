4.1. Growth patterns of electricity consumption, population, and GDP Hong Kong is a services center in Asia and an international finance center that had the largest total funds raised through new initial public offerings in 2010. It, as a former British colony, used to be a major manufacturing center for light industrial goods in the 1960s and 1970s because of its low labor cost. Hong Kong transformed to a commercial and trading center in the 1980s when manufacturers started moving their labor-intensive operations to mainland China. Over the past two decades, Hong Kong has transformed itself as an international finance center, emphasizing its strong link between East and West and a gateway to mainland China. In the past couple of years, Hong Kong has benefited significantly The growth of electricity consumption resembled a typical logistic curve. and Cho et al. (2007) demonstrated that the logistic growth model had explanatory power in modeling electricity consumption and predictive power for energy demands in short-term. Hence, a 4-parameter logistic function was applied to the data set. The resulting formula is: The value of R 2 of Eq. (1) was 0.999. R 2 is the coefficient of determination, a measure of the proportion of the variation in one variable that is explained by the variation in another variable. The predicted values of Hong Kong's electricity consumption are also shown in Fig. 1 . The accuracy of this 4-parameter logistic function was also assessed by using scale invariant measures -mean absolute percent error (MAPE) and root mean squared percent error (RMSPE). The calculated MAPE and RMSPE were 1.59 percent and 2.09 percent respectively, representing a highly accurate prediction (Witt and Witt, 1992) . Fig. 2 presents Hong Kong's population from 1970 to 2010. It shows that population increased quite linearly between 1970 and 2010 and R 2 , MAPE and RMSPE between the fitted linear curve and the actual data were 0.979, 2.37 percent and 2.18 percent, respectively. By plotting electricity consumption as a function of population, Fig. 3 shows the nonlinear relationship between them. As in the other cities (Brown and Koomey, 2003; Lai et al., 2008) , the increase in Hong Kong's total electricity consumption was partly due to population growth, but more importantly due to changes in economic structure over the past forty years. Details of these changes were described earlier. The function of economic growth is given as: ½Total GDP year ¼ 10000 The value of R 2 of Eq (2) was 0.965. However, if only the data set before 1997 were considered, the R 2 value was 0.997. The change in R 2 value between the data sets 1970e2010 and 1970e1997 can be understood because Hong Kong has gone through two critical changes in the past fourteen years. The first one was the Asian financial turmoil in 1997 in which Hong Kong's economic was ½Electricity consumption year ¼ 2000 þ 42800 1 þ expð0:138 Â ð1990 À yearÞÞ million kWh (1) since then. The predicted values of Hong Kong's total GDP are also shown in Fig. 4 . It should be noted that a discontinuous 4-parameter logistic function could be employed to model Hong Kong's GDP closely; one (as given in Eq. (2)) for the period 1970e1997, and another one for the period 1998e2010. The general form of the logistic function is: where GDP initial is the base level of GDP, DGDP the eventual increase in GDP, s time constant, and t mid the year of the highest growth rate. These values were 10, 000, 190,000, 0.138, and 1990 for t ¼ 1970, 1971,..., 1997, and 125,000, 105,000, 0.5, and 2004 for t ¼ 1998, 1999,. .., 2010, respectively. The R 2 , MAPE, RMSPE of the discontinuous 4-parameter logistic function were 0.997, 3.19 percent, and 4.56 percent for the former period and 0.977, 1.07 percent, and 2.31 percent for the later period respectively. Again, the function produced highly accurate predictions as shown in Fig. 4 . In fact, the total electricity consumption was significantly correlated to the total GDP (R 2 ¼ 0.962, p < 0.001). The plot of Hong Kong's total electricity consumption vs. total GDP is shown in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5 indicates that there was piece-wise linear relationship between electricity consumption and GDP. In the first period, i.e. 1970e2002, electricity consumption increased by about 2.5 million kWh when the total GDP increased by US$ 10 million. During the recent period, i.e. 2003e2010, electricity consumption increased by about 0.5 million kWh when the total GDP increased by US$ 10 million. It is because the finance and service sector that has expanded rapidly since 2003 does not consume electricity as much as the manufacturing or logistics industry per unit of GDP gain. Hence, the preferential treatment from mainland China greatly boosts the energy effectiveness of Hong Kong. As Hong Kong's population was 7.10 million in 2010, per capita electricity consumption was 5898 kWh. Hong Kong's electricity productivity was US$ 5.35 GDP per kWh. Moreover, Hong Kong's electricity consumption is going to increase by more than 300 million kWh each year in the near future. How much more gaseous pollutants will be generated? Table 1 shows the fuel consumed to generate electricity in Hong Kong for the period of 2002e2010 (no data were available from Hong Kong Electric before 2002). In 2010, the majority of electricity generated was made by burning coal (66.4 percent), supplemented by burning natural gas (33.2 percent) and oil (0.4 percent). Fig. 6 shows the fuel life cycle for the electricity consumption of Hong Kong. This figure indicates the operating greenhouse gases and other air pollutants emitted along the paths of fuel life cycle. Specifically, Hong Kong's power companies imported fuels from Indonesia (for 90 percent coal), Australia (for natural gas via Shenzhen LNG terminal for Hong Kong Electric (HKE) only and for 4.3 percent coal), China (for natural gas from Hainan province for CLP only and 3.8 percent coal), and the Middle East (for heavy fuel oil and light gas oil via oil refineries in Singapore) in 2010. Fig. 7 shows the transportation routes of those fuels.
