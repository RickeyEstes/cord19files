Negative control sera should have, at most, negligible coloration after the usual incubation period of 10 min. The positive control serum should yield a definite but light green color (1 to 2+). When the color in the well with the test sera is essentially equal to or darker than those with the positive control sera, they are considered positive. The acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) may be spread perinatally, parentally, and sexually. The AIDS is transmitted frequently by blood transfusions and by blood products from donors who have been infected with the T lymphotropic retrovirus type III (HTLV-III) designated also as the lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV). Recently Neurath et al (1985) described an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA)-inhibition tests to detect antibodies directed against LAV antigens (P24 and PL proteins). The application of their tests shows that among individuals belonging to groups at high risk of developing AIDS, 45.5% were positive for anti-PL and 42% for anti-P24, respectively. The authors suggested the development of a test measuring antibodies to all viral antigens as the most suitable solution for LAV/HTLV-III diagnosis.
