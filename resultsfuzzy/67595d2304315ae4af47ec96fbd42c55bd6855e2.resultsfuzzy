Searching, designing and selecting oligonucleotide probes for molecular applications experiments on sets of highly similar sequences, such as the 16S rRNA, is a non-trivial procedure, which involves many complex and timeconsuming steps. In this article, this procedure was accomplished by the use of ORMA, an integrated architecture of Matlab scripts. The 16S rRNA, a gene sequence of more than 1500 bp, is the preferred genomic target for analyses in the microbiological field (17) (18) (19) (20) . It should be noted that 16S region is commonly used in taxonomical classifications involving in silico alignment and procedures for its two basic properties: (i) 16S presents highly conserved regions which can be used to correctly align all the sequences in the database; (ii) on the other side, 16S presents highly polymorphic regions that can be used in clusterization, phylogenetic tree construction and molecular discrimination of microbiological families even very close one to each other (32) . Use of an automated method for discriminating positions determination, probe retrieval and filtering has obvious and evident advantages over the manual design, often used in previously published papers (8, (33) (34) (35) . These advantages become more significant with increasing dimension of the databases and of the sequences length. ORMA can perform all these operations with user-specified parameters in an automated way and calculates a series of Where sequencing has been performed, the result of the classification is also reported. Sample ID refers to the numbers used in Figure 2 . a Clonal DNA from environmental sample. b Specific indicates that only the probe corresponding to the species was present; non-specific means that no probe was present (except for the universal cyanobacteria probe); aspecific means that the species-specific probe was present, but also other probes showed an IF significantly above background signal. The number of replicates is reported within brackets. c According to RDP II database, release 9.60. qualitative parameters which help in the choice of candidate probes that best discriminate between the sequences of the positive and those of the negative set. The general idea of these scores is to distinguish the sequences/groups which are of interest in a given experiment from those who aren't and that can potentially have a cross-contamination with the positive set, because they could be amplified by PCR, contributing to the molecular complexity of the sample. In this article, performances of ORMA were evaluated by considering the experimental evidences coming from the design of LDR probe pairs on two different 16S rRNA datasets. First, a new set of cyano-specific probe pairs was designed and compared to the original one (8), generated on the same database of sequences. Then, the tool was used to setup LDR probe pairs for the identification of pathogenic species present in bovine milk.
