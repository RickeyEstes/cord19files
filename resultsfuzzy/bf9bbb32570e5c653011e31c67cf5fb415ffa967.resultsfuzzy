The anti-r-cystatin SA1 mouse antiserum (polyclonal) showed a strong cross-reactivity with cystatins of family 2 such as r-cystatin SA2, r-cystatin S, and plasma cystatin C or egg white cystatin, but not with cystatin A from human placenta (family 1 cystatin), as shown in Fig. 1 . The antiserum against r-cystatin SA2 (polyclonal) revealed almost the same cross-reactivity as the antiserum mentioned above. To obtain highly specific antibodies for human cystatin SA1 or its variant (SA2), we attempted to produce monoclonal antibodies using r-cystatin SA1 or r-cystatin SA2. Eventually, we were able to select two hybridomas harboring the monoclonal antibodies for r-cystatin SA1 and r-cystatin SA2, which are designated, respectively, as Cys3F11and Cys2E5 (see Table 1 ). By ELISA, the antibody Cys2E5 (IgG1 isotype) was found to show a strong reactivity with r-cystatin SA2 and a weak cross-reactivity with r-cystatin SA1 (22% crossreactivity) and plasma cystatin C (18% cross-reactivity). The Cys3F11 (IgG1 isotype) was demonstrated to react not only with r-cystatin SA1 but also with r-cystatin SA2 (89% crossreactivity) and plasma cystatin C (47% cross-reactivity). Neither monoclonal antibody reacted with any other cystatin tested, including r-cystatins S, SN, D, and E/M or egg white cystatin, as shown in Table 1 . The epitope specificity of the two monoclonal antibodies was then analyzed by ELISA additivity test. This assay requires that the antigen be saturated with each antibody tested. Accordingly, we determined the lowest concentration of each antibody at which saturation was achieved and used concentrations to perform ELISA with sin- gle and with mixed pair of antibodies. As shown in Table 2 , AI for Cys3F11 and Cys2E5 was 64%. This result shows that the bindings of the two monoclonal antibodies are additive, suggesting that these antibodies bind to distinct epitopes. Generally, the immunoblots of saliva samples by native gel with anti S-type cystatin antisera give five positive bands (for homozygotes of cystatin SA1 or SA2) or six bands (for the heterozygote of SA1 and SA2), as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 (lanes A and B) clearly demonstrated that immunoblots with monoclonal antibodies do not provide positive signals for non-phosphorylated cystatin S, mono-phosphorylated cystatin S, di-phosphorylated cystatin S, or cystatin SN. The immunoblot with Cys3F11 showed two positive bands for cystatins SA1 and SA2 with almost the equal intensity; how- Fig. 2 . Detection of S-type cystatins by Western blot. Western blot of human submandibular-sublingual saliva was performed as described by Shintani et al. (1994) .The first antibodies used are: P; anti-r-cystatin SA1 antiserum, A; Cys3F11, B; Cys2E5. ever, Cys2E5 formed a strongly reacting band with cystatin SA2 and a faint band (indicated by the arrowhead) with cystatin SA1, as seen in Fig. 2 . These observations emphasize that the monoclonal antibody, Cys2E5, can discriminate the structural differences between cystatins SA1 and SA2, both of which are encoded by the CST2 locus. Neither monoclonal antibody showed a positive reaction with cystatin D in the immunoblot by acidic polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Recently, monoclonal antibodies have been produced from a hybridoma resulting from the fusion of a mouse immunized with r-human S-type cystatins expressed with a carboxyl terminal 10Ã— His-Tag in a mouse myeloma cell line, NS0 (R & D Systems, Inc., catalog nos. MAB1296 for rcystatin S, MAB1285 for r-cystatin SN, and MAB1201 for cystatin SA). As compared in Table 1 , the commercially available antibodies do not show the ability to select r-human S-type cystatins. However, all the commercial monoclonal antibodies do discriminate the structural differences between r-human cystatin C and r-human S-type cystatins. It is noteworthy that the cross-reactivity of two monoclonal antibodies, Cys2E5 and MAB1201, is quite different. Taken together, it can be concluded that there may be common epitopes and specific epitopes for the cystatins of this family.
