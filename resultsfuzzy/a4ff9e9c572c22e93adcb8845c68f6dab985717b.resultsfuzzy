Of the total collection of 173 samples that were used in the validation panel, five samples were excluded. One sample was inhibited repeatedly in the MLPA and of four samples an insufficient volume was left to perform all tests. A total of 168 samples were included in the comparison: 129 (77%) samples were positive for one or two viral targets, including unconfirmed (false) detections. Sixty-nine (41%) samples were cell culture-positive, 116 (69%) samples were RT-PCR positive, 127 (76%) samples yielded positive MLPA results and 100 (60%) samples were found positive by the DPO. In Table 3 , the performance per method and detection rate are summarised. In Table 4 , the virus specific detections have been summarised per method. Both tables show the number of detections which exceeds the amount of positive samples due to mixed infections.
