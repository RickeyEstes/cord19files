Synthesis of 1-alkoxy-1H-benzo-and 7-azabenzotriazoles (Bt-OR and At-OR) We have previously described the use of (benzotriazol-1yloxy)tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP) for the dehydration of aldoximes to cyanides [22] . In that work, analysis of the reaction course by 31 P{ 1 H} NMR did not show the formation of a new phosphorus signal other than that for HMPA, which is a reaction byproduct. However, prior investigations by others [23, 24] and by us [25] [26] [27] have demonstrated the formation of phosphonium ions by the reaction of BOP with the oxygen atoms in amide linkages of purines and related heterocycles. In fact, related to these observations we have demonstrated the isolation and synthetic utility of a nucleoside phosphonium salt [28] . Thus, to us the reaction of oximes with BOP was an intriguing result, leading us to query whether a benzotriazolyl intermediate, rather than a phosphonium ion, was formed en route to the cyanide. This line of reasoning would then suggest that 1-alkoxy-1H-benzotriazoles may indeed be obtainable from the reactions of alcohols with BOP, and that different reaction pathways may be operative depending upon the nature of the nucleophile (Scheme 2). However, the formation of 1-alkoxy-1H-benzotriazoles by such an approach appeared implausible on the basis of prior observations, where no reaction of BOP with the free hydroxy groups of nucleosides was observed [23, 25] . Our recent work on a two-step one-pot etherification of purine nucleosides, quinazoline, and pyrimidines, had led some interesting preliminary observations [29] . Although BOP did not react with MeOH in the absence of a base, in the presence of Cs 2 CO 3 rapid formation of HMPA was observed and 1-methoxy-1H-benzotriazole (1-methoxy-1H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole) was isolated [29] . This evidence clearly showed that alcohols are capable of reaction with BOP in the presence of a base. Thus, we first evaluated whether the reaction of BOP with alcohols was general and we elected to use DBU as base for cost considerations. Table 1 shows the results of this analysis. Reaction of BOP with either 1.4 or 2.7 molar equiv of MeOH, in the presence of 1.4 molar equiv of DBU, gave comparable yields of Bt-OMe (1a, 48% and 50%, respectively). Use of MeOH as reaction solvent itself resulted in a 47% yield of 1a. These results seem to imply that maximal conversion of BOP to the N-alkoxybenzotriazoles is around 50%, possibly due to a competing reaction between BOP and DBU (see below). Nevertheless, 1° and 2° alcohols appear to react with BOP in the presence of a base, leading to the direct formation of N-alkoxybenzotriazoles. Because reactions with BOP produce HMPA, a suspected nasal carcinogen, and the modest yields of the N-alkoxybenzotriazoles obtained, we decided to investigate other reactive BtOH derivatives for this reaction. A variety of phosphorus and sulfonate derivatives of BtOH has been synthesized and studied as peptide-coupling agents [30] . Amongst these we selected the easily synthesized tosylates of BtOH (Bt-OTs) and its 7-aza analogue AtOH (At-OTs). Furthermore, we have used Bt-OTs for conversion of aldoximes to nitriles and this reagent was generally comparable to BOP in those reactions. This factor additionally favored the selection of these two tosylate derivatives. As can be seen from Table 2 , Bt-OTs is superior to BOP, and a wide range of 1° and 2° alcohols underwent reaction with Bt-OTs giving good to excellent yields of 1-alkoxy-1H-benzotriazoles. Some notable results are as follows. Despite the leaving group ability of BtO − , elimination to styrene does not appear to be a significant problem in the reactions with the isomeric phenylethanols ( enhanced acidity of these protons in 1o or a reactive intermediate. Such a problem was not encountered in the reactions of other benzylic alcohols. Use of K 2 CO 3 in place of DBU did not ameliorate this problem encountered with 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol. However, use of slightly modified conditions resulted in the for-mation of the desired product 1o in good yield (see Supporting Information File 1 for details). Reaction of phenol with Bt-OTs resulted in the formation of the phenyl tosylate ( Table 2 , entry 16), indicating the potential use of this reagent as a tosylating agent for phenols. The outcome in the phenol reaction may be linked to the potential reaction pathway, an aspect that is described below. However, because phenoxide is a softer nucleophile as compared to alkoxide, we had to consider whether this was a factor in the reaction mechanism. In reactions of alcohols with BOP or Bt-OTs, the product structure is independent of the mechanism since all possible mechanisms result in the same product. However, for reactions with unsymmetrical peptide-coupling agents, an understanding of the mechanistic details would be required. Thus, the next stage in these investigations focused on this aspect.
