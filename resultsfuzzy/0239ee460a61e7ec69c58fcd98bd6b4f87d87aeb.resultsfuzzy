To ensure the accuracy of the simulation results, let us consider the fact that the valid parameter sets should obey the following rules [9, 10, 41] : (i) the model must contain oscillations. This is important as there has been experimen-tal evidence that oscillations occur between p53 and MDM2 after cell stress; (ii) the mechanism used to mathematically describe the degradation of p53 by MDM2 is accurate only for low concentrations of p53; and (iii) the concentration of p53 * is much higher than that of inactive p53 after the system reaches an equilibrium. Based on these three rules and the existing parameter sets used in [10] , we obtained the kinetics of p53 stress response networks under continuous IR dose using the simulation platform in MAT-LAB7.0. The detailed parameter sets used in our model can be found in Tables 1-3.
