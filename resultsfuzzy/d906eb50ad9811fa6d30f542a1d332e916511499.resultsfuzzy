The theoretical concept of quasispecies was ¢rst described by Eigen [6] and Eigen et al. [26] , and has been demonstrated to be suitable for describing the behaviour of the RNA virus at the molecular level. The quasispecies structure of some RNA viruses has remarkable biological implications because, during viral replication, dynamic mutants with considerable adaptability are continuously generated. Human immunode¢ciency virus type 1 is one of the most dramatic examples of viral quasispecies, but similar observations have been made for many virus populations [27] . In coronaviruses, the genomic complexity and the quasispecies nature have been well documented mainly for the murine hepatitis virus, the study model of the genus [28] . Some studies have demonstrated that FCoVs can also consist of a complex of heterogeneous variants in vivo and in vitro [13, 29] . The main purpose of this study was to understand the heterogeneity of FCoVs in vivo analysing the genomic complexity of strains from both healthy and sick cats. The quasispecies composition of FCoVs was evaluated in SSCP analysis by testing PCR fragments from the N and ORF7b regions. The SSCP assay has been shown to be a reliable tool for evaluating the heterogeneity of RNA viruses; for each lane, the number of bands visible after electrophoresis of the amplicons is proportional to the number of viral subpopulations included in a given sample. We also analysed the viral tissue distribution in the sick cats. In cat 419, the virus was seen in the following organs: kidneys, spleen, brain cortex and large intestine, while in cat 420, we detected the viruses in all the organs analysed except the brain cortex and the lungs; in cat 453, the viruses were distributed in the pericardium, lungs and liver (Table 1) . Cats with FIP demonstrated more variability in their SSCP patterns than healthy ones. Our anamnestic data supported the hypothesis that cat 419 and cat 420 became infected by contact with carrier cats and the same viral strain evolved di¡erently within the diseased animals acquiring more genetic complexity. Our results showed that quasispecies composition di¡ers between organs in the same cat and the heterogeneity of the FCoV genome was correlated with the seriousness of the clinical forms and the lesions of the organs. In fact, the highest variability in SSCP patterns was observed in cat 420 a¡ected by systemic FIP and this was more obvious in its seriously degenerated liver and lymph nodes. The viral tissue distributions as well the genomic complexity were consistent with the seriousness of the disease, as proven by a higher distribution of the viruses in cat 420. These results con¢rm the biological relevance of the quasispecies; the high mutation rate of coronaviruses contributes to their rapid evolution with the selection of new variants [30] . In some cases the new variants can escape from the immune system and are more advantageous giving rise to more serious lesions such as those observed in the liver of cat 420. Higher variability was observed in the sick cats with acute disease, but, in contrast, more homogeneity was observed in the healthy cats with persistent infection. The two genomic regions analysed in this study showed di¡erent levels of variation. The N region demonstrated a stronger heterogeneity as compared to ORF7b, as has previously been described by other authors [13] . The limited presence of quasispecies was seen in the ORF7b region and the SSCP patterns were similar for most samples examined. In contrast, higher variability was seen in the N region both in the same cat and between di¡erent cats (t = 33.0866 ; P = 0.006; Table 2 ). N amplicons from the liver and mesenteric lymph nodes of cat 420, which showed the highest variability (Fig. 1) , were cloned to identify the di¡erent viral subpopulations and 10 clones randomly chosen for each specimen were analysed in an SSCP assay. The patterns of the clones from the liver showed a signi¢cant variability with respect to the clones from the lymph nodes (U = 6.000; P = 0.000; Table 3 ) while in the same organ, the quasispecies composition was homogeneous (Table 4) . To determine the relationship between the FCoVs detected in healthy and in sick cats, phylogenetic analysis was performed on nucleotide sequences of the N and the ORF7b regions. Nested PCR ampli¢cation and sequencing of the N and the ORF7b regions yielded cDNA fragments of 445 (N), 442 (N region of avirulent strains) and 490 (ORF7b) bp in size. The cloned liver sequences showed two main viral subpopulations: one population with an intact N PCR prod-uct of 445 bp while the other population had a deletion of 53 nucleotides leading to an alteration of the reading frame which introduced stop codons. We thought that this deletion arose during transcription because the viral RNA polymerase 'skipped' certain regions and the predicted secondary structure of the RNA genome showed a 'looping out' in correspondence with nucleotide 129, where the deletion began (data not shown). We speculated that these mutants containing deletions are not viable. Among the intact viral subpopulations, the divergence ranged from 0.9 to 13.8%. Lymph node clones showed more homogeneity with divergence varying from 0.2 to 0.4%. Multiple alignments with the nucleotide sequences of the N and the ORF7b regions were generated and sequence comparison with reference strains was performed. The N region alignment showed 100% nucleotide similarity between avirulent strains 352C, 352S, 352N and 368; strain 376 di¡ered from other avirulent strains by 0.5%. The other strains showed a sequence similarity which varied from 84.9 to 99.8%. Most of the nucleotide changes were point mutations, except one triplet deletion event detected in all avirulent strains at position 356^358 nt as well in consensus strain 453 at position 314^316 nt. As a consequence, the deleted amino acid sequences lack one residue in positions 119 and 104, respectively. The ORF7b region alignment showed complete identity among avirulent strains 352C, 352S, 352N, 368 and 376; sequence similarity among the other strains ranged from 92.2 to 99.6%. No insertions and deletions were observed; this is not in accordance with preceding studies which demonstrated a good correlation between deletions in the 7b gene and the attenuation of virulence [31] . To investigate the phylogenetic signal, the numbers of transitions and transversions were plotted against the Kimura two-parameter distance with DAMBE, but no saturation was observed (data not shown). The graphs showed a linear correlation for transitions and transversions over the entire range of divergence. On the other hand, to visualise noise in each data set sequence, we performed a likelihood mapping analysis using the TREE PUZZLE program. 20.2 and 14.4% of the random quartets for the N and the ORF7b region, respectively, fell in the centre of the triangle which represents a star-like phylogeny (Fig.  2) ; this implies that the alignments gave a completely re-solved phylogeny only in certain parts of the tree. Most of the dots in both alignments (76.6% for N and 80% for ORF7b) were equally distributed in the three corners of the triangle representing well-resolved phylogeny. Table 5 summarises the maximum likelihood (ML) parameters for each alignment data set. For both sequence alignments, N and ORF7b, the parameter K of the Q distribution is 6 1, which results in an L-shaped distribution of the rates along the sites. K 6 1 describes a situation of strong heterogeneity where few sites have high substitution rates and most of the sites are constant; in fact, the percentage of the invariable sites is 67.2% for the N and 72.9% for the ORF7b data set. Phylogenetic trees obtained with di¡erent evolution models showed a similar topology. The trees in Fig. 3 were constructed using neighbour-joining and the HKY85 evolution model ; the ML parameters were estimated from data sets and used for tree reconstruction. The tree obtained analysing the N region (Fig. 3A) showed three main clusters supported by a bootstrap value of 100%. One cluster included the ¢ve avirulent strains from healthy cats. The second cluster included the strains from cat 419 and most of the liver clones and lymph node clones from cat 420. The third cluster included two liver clones from cat 420 and the reference strain FIPV-791146. The phylogenetic tree built with the sequences of the ORF7b region (Fig. 3B) showed a separation between the reference strains and the strains which were the object of this study; avirulent strains formed a distinct cluster supported by a bootstrap value of 100% and inside the cluster of virulent strains, a separation is evident between viruses from strains 419, 420 and 453. Phylogenetic analysis of the N sequences showed that virulent strains from the same environment are highly correlated, but we also observed that some clones of cat 420 formed a distinct group with reference strain FIPV-791146; on the basis of this result, we could speculate that this correlation depends on the virulence. This is in contrast with other reports which revealed a strict correlation between di¡erent biotypes from the same geographic background [4] . In fact, in our study, the virulent strains 420 and FIPV-791146 were shown to be closely related despite their di¡erent geographical origin. This theory is con¢rmed by phylogenetic analysis of the ORF7b sequences. In fact, in spite of di¡erent geographic origins, virulent strains 419, 420 and 453 belong to the same cluster supported by a high statistical value. Furthermore, the percentage of similarity between di¡erent biotypes from the same area was shown to be lower than those of the same biotype from di¡erent areas. In conclusion, this study provided further information about the genetic patterns of FCoVs ; it has been shown that quasispecies composition is correlated with the seriousness of the clinical form and lesions in the organs. Phylogenetic analysis showed an evident separation among avirulent strains producing intestinal infection and virulent strains responsible for FIP; this could be due to the increase of the virulence produced by the genomic mutations. Further investigation will clarify the biological sig-ni¢cance of the mutations detected in the genome of FCoVs from naturally infected cats.
