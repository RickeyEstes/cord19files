effects over a functional protein-protein interaction network using network diffusion (Eq (3)) resulting in a ranking of genes by their estimated impact on the life-cycle of the group of viruses. We validated the inferred genes for five viruses using pharmacological inhibition and another siRNA knockdown of three further genes for HCV. Gene effect ranking. Given the results from the stability analysis and analysis of predictive performance, we concluded that the proposed random effects model model is preferable to PMM, due to the fact that it captures more of the variance in the data, for instance, when strong infection stage effects are visible, and because it allows distinguishing between genes that are influencing the viral replication cycle in the early stages of replication, or in the later stages, respectively. We applied the hierarchical model to the pan-viral data set and inferred the gene effects γ g (of which the top 25 are shown in Supplement S5 Text). We then used the estimated gene effects γ g and propagated these using the Markov random walk described in Eq (3). After diffusion we obtain a ranking of all genes in the network ( Table 2 ). While the majority of genes has already been previously selected by the random effects model, we also discovered novel hits, such as UBC (rank 1), EP300 (rank 9), and PLCG1 (rank 13) using the network diffusion. Among the strongest effectors derived from the hierarchical model are, DYRK1B (rank 3), a nuclear-localized protein kinase participating in cell-cycle regulation, and PKN3 (rank 11), a rather little studied kinase that has been implicated in Rho GTPase regulation and PI3K-Akt signaling. UBC encodes ubiquitin, which is involved in numerous cellular processes, most prominently protein degradation. PLCG1 is crucially involved in signal transduction from receptor-mediated tyrosin kinases (e.g. Src) and catalyzes the formation of the second messenger IP3 and DAG. Recently PLCG1 was also found to impact progression of HCC [42] , the HCV replication cycle [43] , as well as receptor-mediated inflammation and innate immunity Host factor prioritization for pan-viral genetic perturbation screens [44] . EP300 is an acetyltransferase and acts as a transcriptional co-activator and has not been studied in detail so far. We compared the strongest gene effects γ g inferred by the hierarchical model (Supplement S5 Fig) to the virus-specific gene effects ρ vg (for which RNAi screens have mostly been used; Fig 4) and found that for some of the estimates for the gene effects γ g the pathogen-specific effects are not consistent over all pathogens. For example, while perturbation of gene CDK5R2 has a beneficial impact on CHIKV replication, it has a restricting effect on the other three viruses. On the other hand perturbation of DYRK1B, PKN3, CDK6, or CSNK2B has either an all-negative or all-positive impact on the replication cycle of the ensemble of viruses. Genes that upon perturbation show the same consistent effect, i.e. suppression of early or late stages of the viral replication cycle, could be targets for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. Validation of identified host factors. We validated some of the top genes from Table 2 using pharmacological inhibitors to verify whether the predicted genes are indeed host factors that are involved in viral replication. In short, we searched the literature for inhibitors and conducted a screen for the proteins for which compounds were commercially available (see Supplement S4 Text for details on the experimental setup and Supplement S6 Fig for results) . In order to assess if the top inferred gene products really have a pan-viral effect, inhibitors were tested on DENV, CHIKV and HCV as before and two novel positive-strand ssRNA viruses, MERS-CoV and CVB. Of the top 20 host factors from Table 2 inhibitors were available for the dependency factors CAMKK2, CDK5R2, DGKE, DUSP1, DYRK1B, PIK4CA, PKN3 and PLK1. The inhibitors were tested in dose-response CPE reduction assays on cells infected with the viruses. In parallel we assessed cytotoxicity of the compounds and discarded measurements that led to a significant reduction in cell viability (below 75% of the signal obtained for untreated control cells). For every host factor, virus and compound concentration, we tested if inhibition of a protein reduced viral replication in comparison to a negative control significantly (one-sided two-sample Wilcoxon test). We adjusted all p-values for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction [45] . We found that inhibition of several host factors showed significant reductions in replication on subsets of the five viruses and specific compound concentrations. For instance, CDK5R2, PKN3 and DYRK1B were significant at the 10%-level after multiple testing correction for at least some compound concentrations in four of the five viruses. However, none of the tested compounds had a significant effect on the replication of all of the five viruses (Supplement S6 Fig) . Note that PLK1 was discarded due to cytotoxicity of the inhibitor at higher compound concentrations. For that reason, we point out that PLK1 should possibly also be discarded in the analysis of the primary screens. Furthermore, we validated the three genes that were newly identified by the network model (UBC, PLCG1, EP300) for HCV using two different siRNAs per gene. In particular, we were interested to see whether knockdown of these three genes would impact the viral replication significantly (see Supplement S5 Text for experimental details, data normalization and statistical analysis). We found that knockdown of UBC and PLCG1 caused a significant inhibition of replication at a level of α = 5% (Fig 5) in comparison to a negative control for all tested siRNAs (two-sided two-sample Wilcoxon-test). However, EP300 was not confirmed at the same significance level for both siRNAs tested.
