Of the 1194 cats included in the study, ages were known for 700 cats (59%), and the median age was 5.0 years ( Table 1 ). The sex of 712 (60%) cats was known: 192/1194 (16%) and 289/1194 (24%) were intact males or castrated males, respectively; 104/1194 (9%) and 127/1194 (11%) were intact or spayed females, respectively ( Table 1 ). The samples were obtained from Switzerland (641/1194; 54%), Germany (475/1194; 40%), France (53/1194; 4%), Austria (5/1194; 0.4%), Finland (9/1194; 0.8%), and Italy (2/1194; 0.2%). For nine samples, the country of origin was unknown. 1 FIV-negative and FIV-positive were defined according to the gold standard test, WB; samples producing one band in WB are "inconclusive"; 2 maternal antibodies are possible in WB-positive cats known to be younger than 6 months of age; unk = unknown; m = male, mc = castrated male, f = female, fs = spayed female; y = years; CH = Switzerland, DE = Germany, FR = France, AT = Austria, FI = Finland, IT = Italy. Most of the WB-negative samples (375/411; 91%) were FIV-TM ELISA-negative or showed an ambiguous result according to ELISA (25/411; 6%; Table 2 ). It is recommended that ambiguous FIV-TM ELISA results be directly retested by WB. Therefore, they do not pose an imminent problem in terms of the diagnosis of FIV infection (false positive/false negative) and were not further analyzed in this study. However, 3% of the WB-negative samples (11/411) were found to be false-positive according to FIV-TM ELISA. Of the 536 samples that were FIV WB-positive, 441 (82%) were also TM ELISA-positive, and 25 (5%) revealed an ambiguous result. Remarkably, 70 WB-positive samples (13%) were negative according to TM ELISA ( Table 2) . The diagnostic sensitivity (true positives/all positives) of FIV-TM ELISA was 82% (441/536); the diagnostic specificity (true negatives/all negatives) was 91% (375/411), and the diagnostic efficiency (correct tests/all tests) was 86% (816/947). The characteristics of the cats with false-negative ELISA results (WB-positive but ELISA-negative) are summarized in Table 1 , and the data for each cat are given in Table 4 . Such samples originated more frequently from male cats (29/70; 41%) than from female cats (16/70; 23%). The samples were sent mainly from Switzerland (38/70; 54%) or Germany (27/70; 39%); five samples were from France ( Table 1 ). The median age of cats with false-negative ELISA results (5.0 years; Table 1 ) was lower than that of cats with FIV WB-and ELISA-positive results (6.0 years; Table 1 ), and a minimum age of two months was observed in both groups. The oldest cat with a false-negative ELISA result was 16 years old, while among the WB-and ELISA-positive cats, 18 years was the maximum age. Table 1, Table 4 ).  We found 247 samples with inconclusive WB results ( Table 2) . Of these samples, the majority showed antibodies against p24 (230/247, 93%); only a few had a p15 band (17/247; 7%). Of the 247 samples, 36 were ELISA-positive, of which 30 had OD values ranging from 100% to 440% of that of the positive control; 205 tested ELISA-negative and six had an ambiguous result in the FIV-TM ELISA ( Table 2) . Animals with inconclusive WB results are recommended to be retested two to three months later.
