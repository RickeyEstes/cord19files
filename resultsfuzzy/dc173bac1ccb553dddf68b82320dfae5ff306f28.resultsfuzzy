The relative frequencies of the binned properties are presented in light gray for class A structures, in dark gray for structures belonging to class B and C pairs, and in black for the sequence-culled sc-PDB [65] subset. The binding site features were calculated using DoGSite [73] . https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006483.g012 software should be able to accurately score similarities, it also has to allow for the observation of non-obvious similarities. Additionally, the difference in performance between Cavbase and RAPMAD is very pronounced for this set of lifelike protein pairs. Obviously, a purely histogram-based comparison enriches dissimilar pairs together with the similar ones. Surface-and interaction-based tools are also characterized by a high early enrichment of known similar pairs. SiteEngine and ProBiS are the surface-based methods which are best suited to recover known similarities in this set. Despite the huge difference in their ability to score site similarities according to the number of substituted residues (data sets 3 and 4), both tools perform similarly in this analysis underlining the necessity to choose a binding site comparison tool based on the user's requirements. This analysis does not aim for the identification of the best method, but emphasizes the impact of the study design on the final decision. For example, while ProBiS can be safely applied to perform query-based searches for similar binding sites (e.g. for function prediction), SiteEngine is well suited to perform all-against-all comparison between binding sites of similar proteins to elucidate relationships and identify potential off-targets. With regard to the interaction-based methods, the clear superior performance of IsoMIF and KRIPO that was present for other data sets becomes even more evident here. This trend might change upon exclusion of binding sites that could not be processed for a comparison with Grim and TIFP which perform similarly good for this set. Although all interaction-based methods show a comparable early enrichment, KRIPO and IsoMIF seem to be the methods of choice for applications which originate from already known protein-ligand complexes. This relates with the finding that the worse performing methods Grim and TIFP fail to identify similar sites in complex with different (Tc < 0.6) ligands.
