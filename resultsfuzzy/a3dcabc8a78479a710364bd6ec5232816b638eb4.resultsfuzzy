Seroconversion was observed in 13 of the 14 patients either by anti-viral IgG (FIA) or by antigen capturing anti-N protein assay by 14 days after the onset of the symptoms. In contrast, anti-viral IgM was detectable only in 10 patients by14 days, and in 13 patients by 30 days after the onset of the symptoms. By comparison, anti-viral IgG and anti-N protein antibodies were detected in all the patients from 30 to 210 days after the onset of the symptoms. Antiviral IgM was shown to be negative in 4, 8, 12 and all 14 patients by day 60,120,180 and 210 days post disease onset, respectively. These results may indicate that antiviral IgG may correlate better with viral neutralization. Also, the recombinant nucleocaspid protein based antigen-capturing ELISA was at least as sensitive as the anti-viral IgG(IFA) assay. Anti-viral IgG and anti-Nucleocaspid antibodies were detectable earlier than anti-viral IgM antibodies, and the highest antibody titer was reached at 120 days (anti-viral IgG) and 180 days (anti-N protein) after the onset of the symptoms. The titer decreased slowly after that time point, and high titers of antibodies were observed in all patients 210 days after the onset of symptoms. Geometric mean values of the antibodies were shown in Fig. 1 . In contrast, a significantly lower titer of anti-viral IgM antibody was found with a peak titer at 30 days. Moreover, anti-viral IgM could not be detected in any of the 14 patients 210 days after the onset of the symptoms. To understand potential viral neutralization in convalescent patients against the infection by the virus, neutralizing antibodies were assayed in six convalescent patient's sera collected 20, 30, 60, 120, and 210 days after the onset of symptoms. It was found that, in all six patients, neutralizing antibodies were detected. The geometric means of the neutralization titers on day 20, 30, 60, 120 and 210 was 1:150, 1:475, 1:400, 1:200 and 1:200, respectively. These data indicate that viral neutralization is a feature of SARS infection, and the duration of the viral neutralization is greater than 7 months.
