Preliminary Shelf Life Study of Various SNAP-Doped Biomedical Grade Polymer Films. Three biomedical grade polymers (CarboSil, E5-325, and SR) with low water uptake (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information) were chosen as matrixes for incorporating SNAP. Ten wt % SNAP-doped polymer films were prepared to evaluate their shelf life during dry storage. To simulate the actual storage and/or shipping environments, the SNAP-doped SR, E5-325, and CarboSil films were stored in the dark with desiccant at 37°C over a period of 8 months. The amount of SNAP remaining in different polymer films was determined at various time points to find the best polymer matrix for maintaining SNAP functionality during storage. The SNAP remaining in the film was decomposed through both the Cu(I) mediated catalytic decomposition pathway and the photoinitiated decomposition pathway by the broad-spectrum 100 W halogen light source. The corresponding NO release measured by the NOA was integrated to determine the total amount of SNAP present in the polymer. The results indicate that SNAP is the most stable in the CarboSil polymer matrix, with 88.5 ± 4.3% of the initial SNAP remaining after 8 months, compared to 86.8 ± 4.9% in SR and 68.3 ± 3.2% in E5-325 (see Figure 1 ). Though the conventional silicone elastomer also exhibits equivalent stability, its lack of processability together with the prolonged polymer curing process (for cross-linking to occur) makes CarboSil a more promising material in terms of NO release properties. Ethylene Oxide (EtO) Sterilization of Various SNAP-Doped Biomedical Grade Polymer Films. Ethylene oxide sterilization is a routine procedure for sterilizing clinical appliances inside hospitals, during which the devices are subjected to high temperature and high humidity level. 43, 44 Ten wt % of SNAP-doped SR, E5-325, and CarboSil were sterilized in order to evaluate the SNAP stability in these materials when undergoing ETO sterilization. The results parallel the shelf life studies, indicating that SNAP is most stable within the CarboSil polymer matrix. Indeed, the CarboSil films maintain 91.8 ± 3.2% of the initial SNAP after ETO sterilization, compared to 82.7 ± 3.8% for the E5-325 films and 78.7 ± 3.1% for the SR films (see Table S2 ). These data suggest that the SNAP-doped CarboSil polymer matrix is the most attractive of all formulations as a NO release material for fundamental studies and eventually for potential biomedical applications. Cumulative Leaching and NO Release of SNAP-Doped CarboSil Films. Although SNAP is reported to be slightly hydrophobic and should preferentially stay within the polymer phase, 45 some SNAP is likely to diffuse from the polymer to the soaking solution. Thus, in vitro studies were conducted with SNAP-doped CarboSil films to examine the effects of different topcoat polymers by analyzing the amount of total SNAP leached into the PBS during soaking. Ten wt % SNAP-doped CarboSil films with no topcoat, 2 layers of CarboSil topcoat, and 2 layers of SR topcoat were soaked in 1 mL of PBS at 37°C . Although SNAP can absorb light in the UV range (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), 37, 42 it is not practical to quantify its decomposition species (e.g., NAP and NAP disulfide) by UV−Vis. 37, 46 Therefore, the concentrations of SNAP, NAP, and NAP disulfide in PBS solution buffers at each time point were monitored by LC−MS. Standard solutions of NAP, NAP disulfide, and SNAP (1, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 μM) were prepared and analyzed for the individual elution times and concentration−peak area calibration curves (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). The elution times of NAP, NAP disulfide, and SNAP from the C18 column are determined to be 3.45, 4.25, and 4.5 min, respectively, which correspond with the increasing log P values of three molecules (−0.07, 0.01, and 0.40, respectively). The log P values were calculated using Marvin Sketch software, where a higher value means greater lipophilicity and hence a longer retention time. Ten wt % SNAP films initially contain ca. 450 nmol of SNAP per mg of polymer. When SNAP films are in contact with the soaking solutions, water starts to diffuse into the polymer outer surface; SNAP begins to leach into the soaking buffer; and at the same time, SNAP (both from the PBS buffer and within the polymer) starts to release NO and form the NAP disulfide byproduct. The detection of NAP thiolate ion in the soaking solutions can be from two possible sources. It is known that, for solid RSNO samples, contamination of thiols is likely and such thiols can react with the trace amount of Cu(II) in solution and form Cu(I) (eq 2). Then, Cu(I), acting as a catalyst, can react with RSNOs (e.g., SNAP), and form RS − (e.g., NAP thiolate) and Cu(II) (eq 3). 47, 48 Alternatively, it is conceivable that small amounts of thiolate can be generated by hydrolysis of RSNOs (eq 4). 48 (2) As shown in Figure 2a , 47% of the initial SNAP (210 nmol/ mg polymer) diffuses out of the CarboSil films without any topcoat over the period of 22 days, compared to 35% for the films with the CarboSil topcoat and only 19% for the films with the SR topcoat. For each type of film, the rate of SNAP leaching is the fastest in the first few hours, and then significantly lower amounts of SNAP continue to diffuse into the PBS over sequential days. The SR topcoat, which is a crosslinked polymer, can reduce the amount of SNAP diffusion into the soaking solution better than the non-cross-linked CarboSil topcoat. Similar leaching patterns are observed for the NAP and NAP disulfide species from the films with different topcoats (Figure 2b,c) . NAP is a widely used chelating and detoxifying agent for treatment of heavy metal poisoning (e.g., mercury, cadmium, and arsenic, etc.). 49−54 Indeed, it hastens the excretion of poisons out of human body without inducing toxic effects, and it represents a protective measure against free radical induced organ injury. 53 Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that small amounts NAP and/or the dimer of NAP (NAP disulfide) emitted from the polymer into the contacting buffer or blood would not likely cause any toxic response in clinical applications. 10 The 10 wt % SNAP-doped CarboSil film with SR topcoats releases NO above 0.5 × 10 −10 mol cm −2 min −1 , the lower end of endothelial NO flux levels, for more than 3 weeks under physiological conditions (see Figure 3a) . A large burst of NO release was observed by the NOA (via chemiluminescence) on day 0 that correlates with the rapid SNAP leaching into the PBS buffer in the first few hours. The cumulative amount of SNAP that releases NO was calculated based on the NOA measurements and compared to the initial amount doped within the film. The total NO release from polymer films can originate from the SNAP decomposing and releasing NO inside the polymer phase as well as from SNAP molecules that diffuse out of the polymer into the PBS buffer. Assuming that the NAP and NAP disulfide detected in the buffer are reaction products of the original SNAP leached from the polymer, the total amount of SNAP that leaches out after time t should be Since the films were placed into fresh PBS during NOA measurements, the NO release detected by the NOA can be only attributed to the SNAP decomposing and releasing NO from inside the polymer phase ([NO] NOA ) (assuming the amount of SNAP leaching during the measurement was negligible). Therefore, the total NO release ([NO] total ) from the polymer film is [NO] total = [NO] NOA + [SNAP] total , which was compared with the initial SNAP in the CarboSil film. As shown in Figure 3b , the total moles of SNAP ([SNAP] total ) leached out over 22 days, the time period of the leaching experiment, is approximately 38.5% of the total NO released ([NO] total ) and, therefore, more than 60% of the total NO is, in fact, released from the polymer phase. This suggests that the leaching process is much slower than the rate of NO release from the polymers, so it is likely that, after the first day, NO release from within the polymer (primarily in the water-rich regions near the outer surfaces of the polymers) is the primary source of NO emission. The ability of the SNAP/CarboSil polymer system to deliver localized NO continuously and sufficiently to sites of interest makes it a very promising material for biomedical applications. Solid-State Analysis of SNAP-Doped CarboSil Polymer Systems. To better understand the fundamental reasons for which SNAP is so stable in CarboSil and is able to release NO for 3 weeks, a series of solid phase characterization has been conducted. Films of 5 wt % SNAP-doped CarboSil and blank CarboSil were viewed under a polarized optical microscope. Distinguished crystalline patterns were found in the SNAP/ CarboSil film in comparison with the blank film (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). Therefore, it is hypothesized that SNAP crystallized in the polymer matrix during the solvent evaporation process, as opposed to all dissolving in the polymer and forming a homogeneous matrix as previously suggested. 10 We further compared the Raman spectra of SNAP crystals, blank CarboSil film, and 15 wt % SNAP/CarboSil film. The spectrum of 15 wt % SNAP/CarboSil ( Figure S4 ) showed characteristic peaks of both CarboSil and crystalline SNAP that further substantiates the existence of crystalline SNAP within the polymer film. In order to identify the form of crystalline SNAP detected in the Raman spectroscopy characterization, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis of the synthesized SNAP crystals was conducted, and the results agree with the patterns of the orthorhombic SNAP reported in the literature (see Figure S5 ). It has been suggested that, in orthorhombic SNAP, one SNAP molecule can form 4 intermolecular hydrogen bonds with 4 surrounding SNAP molecules ( Figure S6 ). 55 The PXRD results of SNAP-doped CarboSil films (1−15 wt %) indicate that the characteristic film diffraction patterns are convolutions of blank Carbosil and the crystalline SNAP powder patterns (see Figure  4 ). The results also suggest that, as the amount of doped SNAP increases (for films with greater than 4 wt % SNAP), the intensity of orthorhombic SNAP peaks in the obtained PXRD pattern is enhanced, indicating a greater percentage of crystalline SNAP within the polymer films. However, SNAP peaks could barely be detected in PXRD patterns for samples with <4 wt % doped SNAP, indicating an apparent threshold for formation of the crystalline form of SNAP within CarboSil. Since all SNAP-doped CarboSil films (including those with <4 wt %) have a light green color, it is speculated that SNAP partially dissolves in the polymer, forming a polymer solution, and any excess SNAP beyond the polymer solubility limit crystallizes in the orthorhombic form during the THF evaporation and embeds in the polymer. This explanation is in agreement with the Raman spectroscopy and PXRD results that orthorhombic SNAP crystals are detected only when the SNAP concentration exceeds the solubility of SNAP in the CarboSil polymer. To calculate the SNAP solubility in the CarboSil polymer, a linear least-squares regression was conducted (see the Supporting Information) using three main PXRD peaks. The calculated solubility is 3.6, 3.5, and 3.9 wt %, respectively (see Figure S7 ), indicating that the solubility of SNAP in CarboSil was ca. 3.4−4.0 wt %. Characterizing the stabilities of SNAP-doped CarboSil films using PXRD further verifies the dissolution hypothesis. We compared the PXRD patterns of freshly prepared 5 and 15 wt % SNAP-doped CarboSil samples as well as the samples stored under ambient light at room temperature for 10 days under the same conditions. We hypothesize that the solubilized SNAP behaves as a solute, dissolving in the CarboSil polymer that acts as the solvent, and it is less stable at room temperature and decomposes faster than the crystalline SNAP. As the solubilized SNAP in the polymer decomposes and the SNAP in the polymer is under saturation, the crystalline SNAP is driven to gradually dissolve into the CarboSil polymer. For 5 wt % fresh samples, most of the SNAP added during preparation is dissolved in the polymer, which is labile and more likely to decompose via thermal decomposition. However, for the 15 wt % SNAP films, most of the SNAP in the film (ca. 11−12 wt %) is stabilized by the intermolecular hydrogen bonding. 55 The percentage of SNAP remaining in the 5 and 15 wt % films after 10 days under ambient light is 19.8 and 83.2 wt % of the initial amount, respectively. The attenuation of orthorhombic SNAP peaks in 5 wt % SNAP-doped CarboSil films relative to the fresh samples is indeed much greater than that of the 15 wt % samples (see Figure S8 ) where the SNAP peak changes are almost undetectable, thus validating our hypothesis. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the SNAP crystals is one of the key reasons for the elevated stability of SNAP-doped CarboSil films during dry storage for 8 months. In addition, as a tertiary nitrosothiol, the SNAP molecule itself is more stable with respect to the loss of NO than other primary and secondary RSNOs due to the steric hindrance effect imposed by the gem methyl group on the dimerization of the radicals that leads to the formation of the sulfur bridge 10, 40, 41, 45 and the hindered rotation of the RS−NO linkage at room temperature. 55 The literature also suggests that the acetamide group in SNAP plays a key role in increasing the S−NO bond strength and reducing the NO liability. 46 Moreover, it has also been reported that the viscosity of the polymer imposes an important cage effect on the S−NO bond cleavage and radical pair formation. Specifically, the restricted mobility of soluble SNAP molecules in the CarboSil microenvironment may favor the recombination of the primary radicals rather than radicals escaping from the solvent cage. 10, 12, 37 Therefore, doping SNAP into the polymer represents a viable option for storage and handling for long-term NO release applications. Further studies comparing SNAP solubility in different polymer matrixes and examining the relationship between the SNAP crystallization/ dissolution process and the stability of SNAP in certain polymers could be quite useful in designing additional NO release polymers with enhanced stability and long-term shelf life. Lastly, Raman mapping characterization using static scans was employed to determine the 2D representation of the SNAP crystal distribution in 3 and 5 wt % SNAP-doped CarboSil films. The green spots in Figure 5 represent regions where the orthorhombic SNAP peaks are detected and are found in large quantities only in the 5 wt % SNAP/CarboSil film, but not in 3 wt % films. This finding correlates with the PXRD peak area fitting results that indicate that the solubility of SNAP in polymer is ca. 3.4−4.0 wt %. However, the exact grain sizes of the SNAP crystals could not yet be quantified by this method because the focal depth of the laser is likely to exceed the grain size of the crystal. Thus, the green spots could represent crystals from both the surface and deeper within the polymer phase, which results in difficulty in distinguishing any individual crystal from overlaid crystals. In Vitro Antibiofilm Experiments. In order to generate NO release (at the higher end of the normal physiological flux level) for longer periods, 20 wt % SNAP-doped CarboSil catheters were prepared as described in the Experimental Section. These devices can release physiological levels of NO for 28 days at 37°C (see Figure S9 in the Supporting Information). Because stable NO releasing devices can abate bacterial adhesion and colonization associated with catheterization, we examined the antibiofilm properties of catheter segments with S. aureus for 7 days in a drip-flow biofilm reactor at 37°C. The drip-flow bioreactor was chosen because it promotes the growth of the bacteria that grows at the air− liquid interface, which mimics the condition of the surface of indwelling intravascular catheters. Results for 7 day S. aureus biofilms shows a 5 logarithmic unit reduction in viable cell count on the surfaces of NO release catheters segments when compared to the control segments (see Figure 6a ). This finding is further corroborated by the fluorescent images (Figure 6b) , which illustrates the live/dead bacteria as well as the bacterial surface coverage on the surfaces of both catheters, respectively. These results demonstrate that the SNAP/CarboSil catheter provides an approach that can potentially reduce/prevent catheter-related bloodstream infections. In Vivo Antithrombotic Experiments in Rabbits. In order to demonstrate the potential benefits of using SNAPdoped CarboSil polymer as a thromboresistant material, acute 7 h rabbit experiments were conducted to study the effect of NO release from CarboSil catheters on the thrombus formation area. The NO release from the SNAP/CarboSil catheter maintains an average flux of approximately 5.5 × 10 −10 mol cm −2 min −1 for 7 h at 37°C (see Figure S10 in the Supporting Information). One SNAP/CarboSil and one control catheter (non-SNAP) were placed into the external jugular veins of each rabbit for 7 h. Owing to the very slow loss of SNAP from the catheter reservoir (given the composite nature of the material), the dose of SNAP leached from the catheters is significantly below the threshold that can induce the adverse reactions. 10 After 7 h of implantation, the catheters were carefully removed from the rabbit veins, leaving the thrombus formation intact on the surface. To determine whether the NO release reduced the clotting on the catheter surface, digital images of the catheter surfaces were taken, and the two-dimensional (2D) representation of the thrombus area was quantitated using ImageJ software from the NIH. As shown in Figure 7 , the thrombus formation is significantly reduced for the SNAP/ CarboSil catheters with NO release ability when compared to the controls (n = 3 rabbit experiments). The SNAP/CarboSil catheters were also examined for NO release rates via chemiluminescence after explantation, and they still exhibit an average flux of 3.8 ± 0.2 mol cm −2 min −1 . This clearly demonstrates that the localized NO release from the catheter surface can significantly reduce platelet activation and thrombus formation.
