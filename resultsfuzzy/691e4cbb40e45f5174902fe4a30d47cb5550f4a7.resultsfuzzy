In vitro inhibition of SARS 3CL pro by inhibitor 1 The inhibition of SARS 3CL pro by inhibitor 1 was characterized using a FRET-based fluorogenic method reported previously. 12 When added to a mixture of protease and substrate, inhibitor 1 inhibited 3CL pro in a competitive fashion with a K ic of 250( ± 50) nM. No kinetic evidence of covalent inhibition was observed when 10 uM 3CL pro was pre-incubated with 100 uM inhibitor 1 (20 mM Bis-Tris (pH 7.0), 2 mM DTT, 37°C) for 15 to 60 min, nor under solution conditions that mimicked the crystallization buffer.
