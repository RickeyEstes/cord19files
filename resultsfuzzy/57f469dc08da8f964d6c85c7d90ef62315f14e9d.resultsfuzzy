Minutes or usually several hours, but may be justifiable with up to days/weeks in case of re-emerging contamination problem Exceptionally weeks, usually days, but may be shorter in case of products with short shelf life and high turnover As soon as possible, preferably minutes to hours, but can be days HTS can generate a vast amount of data describing the microbial community of foods. When technical issues such as speed and standardization of laboratory and bioinformatics methods are improved, HTS and especially shotgun metagenomics may find applications in routine analysis of food, also for control purposes, as it has already done in clinical settings. Interpretation of the results is an important issue, for both the agri-food industry and the competent authorities, but also how to act on the results (Lambert et al., 2017; Taboada et al., 2017) . In the quality control of products and production lines, the detection of a pathogen, a genus that includes pathogenic species, and/or specific virulence genes/factors may, but will not necessarily lead to withdrawal of the product or lead to decisions to decontaminate the entire production line. The decision will depend on the specific context, i.e., the specific combination of pathogen marker, how well characterized the pathogen is, the type of product and the intended use. Quantitative data may also play a role, but sometimes are not or cannot be made available. Legal requirements can direct the decision processes. In the European Union (EU), both food safety criteria and process hygiene criteria are listed with details on sampling plans, limits, analytical reference methods and stage where the criterion applies (European Commission, 2005) . Similarly, the safety of the food supply chain in the USA is regulated (FDA, 2011) . The application of WGS in microbiological risk assessments of foods is largely unexplored and faces important challenges. The number of hazards increase exponentially when zooming from serovars or serotypes to genotypes. The translation of multidimensional genotypic data into reduced information on phenotypes to ultimately generate a measure of risk that matches the requirements of food safety authorities and policy makers is therefore necessary (Franz et al., 2016) . The presence or absence of specific genetic markers in a bacterial isolate or in a sample can direct the acceptance or rejection of a particular product. Furthermore, specific detection of FBP-markers may only be required within a narrow concentration range. For example, the observed presence of the STEC-associated virulence genes stx1 or stx2 in ground beef can lead to rejection or at least to particular caution and further examination to preclude the presence of STEC. We suggest that the observed background level of E. coli can provide a basis for decision in the case of STEC. The presence of E. coli itself is undesirable and un-tolerable background levels of E. coli, e.g., ≥ 10 4 CFU g −1 should lead to rejection. Thus, we believe it is most critical to ensure that the POD for STEC (markers) is acceptable within the entire range of concentrations at tolerable background levels, e.g., POD ≥ 99% at < 10 4 CFU E. coli g −1 . We suggest that such an approximation can be used to guide both method developments and the enrichment efforts needed to obtain conclusive data. The infectious dose of FBPs vary, and for some FBPs it can be < 100 cells (Tilden et al., 1996; Tuttle et al., 1999; Hall, 2012) and must be considered for this type of calculation. Recently, it has been questioned if all protists and helminths, historically thought of as "parasites" are indeed parasites (Lukes et al., 2015) . Growing evidence of the diverse functional roles that specific bacteria can take on in humans, has forced us to acknowledge that beneficial and pathogenic may be two sides of the same organism, and that it must be understood in the broader contexts of ecology, symbiosis and diversity, among others. Collecting data on the entire microbial communities associated with their hosts may provide for better understanding of the functional interplay between hosts and hosted microorganisms, though so far no clear trend is emerging (Martin et al., 2015) . In the future, perhaps, by learning more aided by HTS studies, it will be possible to stimulate beneficial and prevent pathogenic behavior by microorganisms with broad phenotypic potentials.
