After treatment with rFeIFN-(at V2 and for the subsequent 6 months), an evident clinical improvement was observed in all sick treated cats, especially those with a clinical score (CS) of ≥6 (Table 1) . Such an improvement was not observed in untreated cats (p < 0.05). Asymptomatic cats or those with mild disease remained stable. This clinical improvement agrees with data from De Mari et al. (2004) and from studies with rHuIFN-␣ (Pedretti et al., 2006) .

For the erythrogram, leukogram, electrophoretogram, and CD4/CD8 ratio the situation in V1 and V2 are provided as follows: n, within normal limits; ↓, below normal limits; ↑, above normal limits. For the viral parameters the change from V1 to V2 is provided as follows: ↓, ≥20% decrease; ↑, ≥20% increase; =, stable. (F), favorable change; (U) unfavorable change.

Treated cats that initially presented erythrogram and leukogram values outside the norm showed improvement by V2. This agrees with previous reports that IFN was effective on anemic cats (De Mari et al., 2004) . However, one treated FIV + cat had developed lymphocytosis, and another, lymphopenia by V2 (Table 1 ). The three cats that were examined at V3 did not have a worse clinical or hematologic condition (data not shown). Most untreated cats initially had normal erythrogram and leukogram values. However, in three non-treated cats there was an unfavorable change in several hematologic parameters, although the values of neutrophil counts improved sporadically in two other non-treated cats. Initially, cats had hypergammaglobulinemia, with a low A/G ratio in all FeLV + cats and in two FIV + cats. A significant decrease in gammaglobulin concentrations (p < 0.001) was observed at V2 in five treated cats (4 FIV+ and 1 FeLV+), but it was not sustained as cats followed till V3 were again hypergammaglobulinemic shortly after the V2 period (data not shown). Gammaglobulin levels in untreated cats in which this parameter had initially been abnormally high always remained above normal limits. In the rFeIFN-treated cats, the CD4/CD8 ratio decreased in one FeLV + cat and in two FIV + cats. An improvement in the ratio was observed in two of them, but in another three, the CD4/CD8 ratio did not increase or decrease (Table 1) . Riondato et al. (2003) observed no correlation between CD4/CD8 ratio variations and clinical signs, as sick and healthy cats had very similar ratios, which agrees with our results. Proviral load was detected in all animals. Only one of the treated FIV + cats decreased its initial proviral load by V2, but was still within the detection limits. No treated or untreated cat became negative. In one treated-FeLV + and one treated-FIV + cat the proviral load increased, though they did not display worsened clinical condition. As regards to viremia, only FeLV + cats were positive for RT and capsid protein. In these cats, the response to interferon was variable (Table 1) . One of the treated FeLV + cats worsened in all the viral parameters, but its CS decreased. Caney et al. (2003) did not observe an effect of rFeIFN-on the proviral load. To date, the in vivo mechanism of type-I IFNs on retroviral infections is unknown. In a murine model with the Friend murine leukemia retrovirus, the immunomodulatory effect of IFN-␣ seemed to be more important than the antiviral effect through the induction of antiviral enzymes (Gerlach et al., 2009 ). In our preliminary study, rFeIFNinduced an evident improvement of the clinical condition of treated cats, as well as of the hemogram parameters. The CD4/CD8 ratio improvement was inconsistent, and the virological parameters, such as proviral load and viremia were not seen to be affected by treatment. This suggests that rFeIFN-possibly lacks antiviral effects in vivo, but rather may have an immunomodulatory effect. Taking these results into consideration, it would seem advisable to treat retrovirus-infected cats with interferon when they have clinical signs, as they would benefit from its effects in improving their clinical condition.
