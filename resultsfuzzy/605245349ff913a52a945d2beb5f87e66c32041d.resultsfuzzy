-production of new virus particles with or without lysis of the host cells -abortive infection -latency -transformation. • In the productive replication cycle, the sequential stages are attachment (adsorption), entry (penetration) into the cytosol, uncoating, synthesis of viral macromolecules (mRNA, proteins and genomes), assembly of new viral particles, morphogenesis and release. • In latency, the virus persists as its genome, with limited expression of selected viral genes, sometimes as RNA only. • In viral transformation, the virus persists as its genome, with expression of selected viral proteins that induce the host cell to behave like a tumour cell. emerging, is a fascinating one, as viruses are found to associate with, and affect, cells in a wide variety of ways. The range of possible interactions is indicated in Table 7 .1. It is possible to divide these into three broad categories that show considerable overlap: 1. Viruses that infect and replicate within cells causing the cells to lyse when the progeny virions are released. This is called a cytolytic cycle; the infection is productive and the cell culture demonstrates cytopathic effects, which are often characteristic of the infecting virus. The host cells are termed permissive. In some instances viruses are produced from the infected cells but the cells are not killed by the process: that is, the infection is productive but non-cytolytic, and may become persistent. 2. Viruses that infect cells but do not complete the replication cycle. The infection is thus called abortive or non-productive. Abortive infections can be due to a mutation in the virus so that some essential function is lost, or to the production of defective interfering particles, or to the action of interferons. It may be possible to manipulate the conditions in vitro to obtain a steady state or persistent infection in which infected and uninfected cells coexist and there is some, generally limited, virus production. 3. Viruses that enter cells but are not produced by the infected cell. The virus is maintained within the cell in the form of DNA, which replicates in association with the host cell DNA. The host cell is termed non-permissive and the infection is non-productive. Occasionally this type of interaction results in transformation, where the cell exhibits many of the properties of a tumour cell. In other cases a latent infection ensues in which little or no viral gene expression is found, no viral replication occurs and the cell retains its normal properties. Viruses are totally dependent on the cells they infect to provide the energy, metabolic intermediates and most (in some cases all) of the enzymes required for their replication. With advances in the techniques of molecular virology, crystallography and modelling, together with the classical methods of electron microscopy, titration and biochemical assay, it has become possible to study virus-cell interactions to a sophisticated level. The picture that has emerged, and is still particles and cells. Under in vitro conditions, the ionic composition of the culture medium is an important factor as both viruses and cells are negatively charged at neutral pH and thus tend to repel one another. The presence of cations, such as Mg 2+ , helps to promote close contact. Adsorption then takes place through specific binding sites on the virus and receptors on the plasma membrane of the cell. It is largely a temperature-and energy-independent process. Viruses vary widely in the range of cells to which they can adsorb, depending on the nature of the sites to which they attach and how widespread they are among cells of different types, tissues and species. The presence of the receptor determines whether the cell will be susceptible to the virus, but the cells must also be permissive: that is, for successful production of new virions, they need to contain the range of intracellular components required by the virus for its replication. The ability of a virus to enter and replicate in a particular cell type is called tissue or cell tropism. Many cellular receptors are protein in nature but they can also be composed of carbohydrate or lipid. There is considerable interest in identifying receptors for particular viruses, as the attachment step is a potential target for antiviral therapy and could aid in the understanding of viral pathogenesis. Specific receptors for selected viruses have been described, but have frequently been disputed. Newer techniques involving monoclonal antibodies, molecular cloning and gene transfer have helped to resolve these issues. It has become apparent that more than one type of receptor molecule may be required by the majority of viruses to complete the entry stage of the replication cycle. Indeed it is likely that there is a complex
