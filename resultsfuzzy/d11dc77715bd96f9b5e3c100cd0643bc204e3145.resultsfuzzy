We have tested the proposed people monitoring system with two videos acquired in a research laboratory using a camera to monitor the lab's only entrance. During 1-h monitoring period, video-I recorded eleven different people who were unaware of the experiment, of which four entered and left twice, another four entered and left only once, and three entered without leaving. Video-II simulated the process of people entering and leaving with the help of eight different students, among whom seven entered and left the lab for three times and another one twice. To further increase the test samples, a synthetic process generator is also designed to randomly re-arrange the entries and exits from the two videos based on the rule that one cannot enter unless he/she is outside the lab, and vice versa. This generator allows us to simulate a wide variety of combinations of entries and exits over time from the same group of people. For comparison, we also implement a recognition approach based on maximum likelihood (ML) classification [14, 21] as follows. When a person is detected entering a closed room, he/she is compared with people who are in the system's database and currently labeled as 'out'. If the maximum likelihood with respect to an 'out' person is larger than a threshold T m (set to 0.7 in our implementation), they are considered the same person. Then, the observed person is labeled as 'in' and his/her corresponding color histogram in the database is updated with the latest one. Otherwise, the person is assumed to be new and then labeled as 'in' with a new identity label. When there are multiple exits without entries among them, the leaving people are recognized from the people with label 'in' by maximizing a joint likelihood.
