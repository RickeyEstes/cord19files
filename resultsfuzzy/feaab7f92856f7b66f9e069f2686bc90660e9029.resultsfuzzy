3.1. Determination of the Activity of Single Alkaloid. The MRSA strain ATCC43300 contains mecA gene but no norA gene. In the absence of drug intervention, the fluorescence absorption reached around 40000 after 17 hours' incubation. In contrast, the fluorescence intensity was inhibited by adding the positive control cefoxitin and the alkaloids. The inhibiting effect could be calculated by the following equation: = ( − )/ × 100%, where represents the inhibiting ratio, represents the fluorescence absorption of the negative control (row 11), and represents the fluorescence absorptions of alkaloids groups (rows 1-10). After that, the EC 50 values were calculated from the I-concentration curves. The result showed that, among the alkaloids, berberine showed the strongest antimicrobial activity (Figure 3) , and the inhibiting ratios reached 85.2% and 94.0% at the concentration of 512 g/mL and 1024 g/mL, respectively. The sequence of the activity of alkaloids was Ber > Cop > Jat > Pal > Epi. This test adopted resazurin for fluorescent determination, and it could be found from Figure 4 that this method was reliable. When adding cefoxitin or Ber, the color of the MRSA suspension changed regularly with the increase of the concentration (Figures 4(a) and 4(b) ); the fluorescence intensity at 24 h significantly decreased when adding 64 g/mL cefoxitin (Figures 4(b) and 4(f)). In addition, it showed that the density of MRSA increased significantly after being incubated for 24 h (Figures 4(c) and 4(d)); however, the colony counts significantly decreased when adding 64 g/mL cefoxitin or 128 g/mL Ber (Figures 4(g) and 4(h) ). To date, there have been some reports of drug combinations on MRSA, such as tannins and polyphenols [23] , baicalein and ciprofloxacin [24] , flavones and -lactam antibiotics [25] , usnic acid and antimicrobial agents [26] , anacardic acids and methicillin [27] , arbekacin and vancomycin [28] , polyoxometalates and oxacillin [29] , fosfomycin and arbekacin [30] , gemcitabine and gentamicin [31] , penicillin and Salix babylonica L. [32] , ciprofloxacin and Isatis tinctoria L. [32] , ceftriaxone and Scutellaria baicalensis G. [32] , Rosmarinus officinalis and cefuroxime [33] , and pannarin and antibiotics [34] . However, to our knowledge, there have not been any reports on the combinations of ingredients in traditional medicine. The present study showed that alkaloids had anti-MRSA activity, but the activity was relatively weak compared with antibiotics. The reason might be that the bacteria had multiple drug resistance which resulted in low absolute concentration inside the cell membrane. Bacteria have evolved numerous defenses against antimicrobial agents, and drug-resistant pathogens are on the rise [35] . A general and effective defense is conferred by ubiquitous multidrug resistance pumps (MDRs), membrane translocases that extrude structurally unrelated toxins from the cell [36] [37] [38] [39] . (6, 9) , F3 = MS regression/MS error = 9.33 > F0.01, indicating significant. Therefore, the regression result was reliable. The regression coefficient was tested for its significance, and the items that were not significant were eliminated at the level = 0.10. The equation was optimized as = 0.34807 + 0.06611 1 + 0.07975 2 + 0.10040 3 + 0.04670 4 + 0.05185 5 +0.06406 2 2 . Analyzed by DPS, the program numbers higher than 0.41 were 1685. Meanwhile, the weighted mean and the 95% confidence interval were calculated ( Table 2 ). Standardized the weighted mean of berberine by 1, the weighted means of other alkaloids were obtained, and the optimal ratio was obtained as follows: 1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : 5 = 0.702 : 0.863 : 1 : 0.491 : 0.526. There have been multiple design methods, such as Central Composite Design [41] , Box-Behnken Design [42] , and Doptimal Design [43] . Compared with these methods, QRCD presents two features: (1) it sacrifices partial orthogonality to obtain rotatability, and it retains the merits of less test times, simple calculation, and low dependency among the regression coefficients; (2) it discards the disadvantage of lacking rotatability that cannot screen the optimal regions from predicted values. The results of this section were consistent to the results in 3.2. Figure 7 showed that the optimal combination in 3.3 had the strongest inhibiting effects on E. coli, S. aureus, S. dysenteriae, and S. pneumonia. Specifically, the EC 50 of geometric proportion of alkaloids on E. coli was 1.81 times larger than that of the optimal combination; the EC 50 of Berberidis Radix on S. aureus was 1.74 times larger than that of the optimal combination; the EC 50 of geometric proportion of alkaloids on S. dysenteriae was 1.59 times larger than that of the optimal combination; the EC 50 of Berberidis Radix on S. pneumonia was 1.41 times larger than that of the optimal combination. In addition, the antimicrobial activity of the optimal combination on C. albicans ranked second only to Rhizoma Coptidis. The results indicated that the optimal combination was not only applicable for ATCC43300, but also other laboratory strains.
