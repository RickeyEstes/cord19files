Because of the relationship between serum immunoglobulin status and enteric disease, it is of interest to know the concentration of immunoglobulin in the gastrointestinal tract secretions of calves with different serum immunoglobulin levels. Quantitation of immunoglobulins in ruminant gastrointestinal secretions has produced conflicting results (reviewed by Butler, 1983 and Morgan et al., 1981) . In young calves, for example, Newby and Bourne (1976) determined that IgG1 decreased from 95% to 48% of intestinal immunoglobulin between two and fourteen weeks of age, while Porter et al. (1972) We used intravenously-injected 1251-1abelled IgG1 to quantitate the passage of serum IgG1 into the gastrointestinal tract (Besser, 1986) . The discrepancy between IgG1 transfer to the gut measured by fecal excretion (32% of the total IgG1 clearance) and the transfer estimated from protein-bound 1251 in the gut at necropsy (68% of the total IgG1 clearance) may be explained by IgG1 proteolysis occurring after transfer to the gastrointestinal tract but before fecal excretion. The occurrence of such proteolysis was demonstrated by Feeding 48-hour-old calves 1251-1gG1. The calves did not absorb measureable IgG1 (protein-bound 1251) to serum and yet excreted only 28% of the 1251 dose as protein-bound label in the Feces. The remainder was excreted as non-protein bound 1251 in the urine.
