This section presents the trading results of the proposed intelligent straddle trading system based on the use of the MACD trading rule and the computed HV and IV forecasts from Sections 4.2 and 4.3. The simulated trading duration is defined as the last three years (i.e. Jan 2004 to Dec 2006) of the observation period. As benchmark, the MV time-series is directly employed to study the performance of the straddle trading system and the computed trading profit/loss serves as a baseline comparison to the trading results of counterpart trading systems employing the HV and IV projections. In addition, the performances of trading systems employing the eFSM-based volatility projection module (VPM) are also evaluated against the results of traders with a hypothetic Perfect-Predictor (PP) VPM. That is, with respect to Eq. (32), the PPbased VPM generates perfect forecast ofŷðt þ 1Þ ¼ yðt þ 1Þ. Table 3 lists the various trading results. Specifically, two different aspects of the trading performances of the various straddle trading systems evaluated are reported in Table 3 . They are: (1) the mean and standard deviation of the profit/loss e r s ðtÞ (in percent) for each straddle trade performed, and (2) the overall profit/loss e R (in percent) achieved by a trading system for the simulation period to the total investments committed. e R may also be interpreted as the return on every unit Hong Kong dollar committed to the straddle trades during the trading period. The results are expressed in percentages to facilitate the comparison of the trading performances for the various counterpart trading systems employing different HSI volatility measures and the eFSM or PP-based VPM. With respect to Eqs. (20) and (21)  where r s (t) is the computed return (profit/loss) for the traded straddle s; the value V s,0 denotes the initial investment committed by the evaluated trading system to take an open (longed or shorted) position on the straddle s; and S is the total number of straddle trades performed during the simulated trading period. From Table 3 , one can observe that regardless of the volatility measure used, the trading gains achieved by the proposed straddle trading system employing the PP-based VPM are significantly positive after accounting for the 1% transaction cost. This is reflected by the large positive gains for the expected profit/lossr s ðtÞ for each straddle trade and the overall return e R under the PP-VPM column. The results clearly demonstrated that the capability to predict (project) the daily HSI volatility levels from past historic observations can help a human trader to enhance his investment profits when trading the HSI straddles. In addition, the positive gains recorded by the various trading systems employing either the eFSM or PP-based volatility projection module (VPM) indicated that the trading strategy adopted by the trade decision module (TDM) of the proposed straddle trading framework is technically viable in capitalizing the uncertainties of the Hong Kong stock market for financial volatility trading. That is, the proposed straddle trading system can help a human trader to generate investment profit gains via straddle trading during rising, falling or side-way market conditions. Hence, considerable profits can be realized by the implemented trading framework. Individually, each of the three volatility measures produced different degree of trading return. Table 3 showed that the highest profit gains are consistently achieved by trading systems employing the implied volatility (IV) measure. Trading systems adopting the HV measure as a proxy to the implicit HSI volatility, meanwhile, have the lowest trading returns amongst all the evaluated systems. A plausible reason is that implied volatility (IV) is a forward projection of the price path of the underlying asset, which in this case, is the fluctuation of the Hang Seng Index. The statistically based HV measure, on the other hand, is backward-looking and could be less sensitive to information contributing to the existing market sentiments. Hence, the IV measure, which is derived from current option price data, may be a more accurate indicator of the anticipated movements of the HSI than the HV measure and subsequently results in much higher trading returns. Lastly, the profit gains of trading systems employing the model-based volatility (MV) measure obtained via the composite AR and GARCH processes fall between those achieved by counterpart systems employing the HV and IV measures. To further demonstrate the viability of the proposed straddle trading framework, the simple average uncompounded daily rate of return DR achieved by the various trading systems for each unit of dollar committed to a straddle trade during the simulated trading period is computed. With respect to Eq. (37), the simple average uncompounded daily return DR is defined as in Eq. (39).
