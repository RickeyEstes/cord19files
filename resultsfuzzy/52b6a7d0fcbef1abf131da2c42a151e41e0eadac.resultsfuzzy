Upon ascertaining the attribute characteristics of the 127 and 1134 residential units in RA and COS, linear regression analysis was performed using the statistical package, SPSS. Since this study attempts to find out the WTP and ES of the architectural and environmental attributes, all identified variables are included in the regression analysis. Accordingly, 'Enter' regression method was adopted to determine the coefficients for each independent variable. The resultant price models for RA and COS are shown in Equations (8)  It can be seen that positive coefficients have been generated for all the variables. This is judged to be reasonable because the less desired options were set as the base group. The four models have similar coefficients of determination (r 2 ), ranging between 0.464 and 0.56. Considering there are over 100 samples from both estates, the resultant r 2 indicates a significant correlation to confirm that architectural and environmental attributes have a positive influence on the properties' market price (Milton & Arnold, 1987) . The r 2 for RA is 0.56 (linear model) and 0.546 (semi-log model), while that of COS is 0.5 (linear model) and 0.464 (semi-log model). 2 Residential units are classified into Classes AeE according to the saleable areas (Class A: <39.9 m 2 ; Class B: 40e69.9 m 2 ; Class C: 70e99.9 m 2 ; Class D: 100e159.9 m 2 ; and Class E: >160 m 2 ) (RVD, 2013). Correlations tend to be stronger for a smaller number of samples (Hill & Lewicki, 2006) . While the site scale of COS is much bigger than that of RA, the correlation is stronger in the RA case.
