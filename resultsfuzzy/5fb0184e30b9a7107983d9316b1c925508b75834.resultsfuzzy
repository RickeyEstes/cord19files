In brain sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin, vacuolar or spongiform areas were evident in different brain regions 7 days after the ICV injection of NA, although occasionally such alterations could be observed as early as 48 h. The affected zones corresponded to myelinated axonal tracts lying near the injected ventricle, such as the fimbria-fornix (Figures 1B-D) and the SM (Figure 1E) , as well as more distant myelinated tracts, including the optic chiasm ( Figure 5G) . These tracts were consistently affected in all NA-treated rats, and the vacuoles correspond to the space generated adaxonally in some myelinated axons, as could be observed by electron microscopy (see below). Myelin vacuolation was mostly ipsilateral to the injection site, although as it extended along the tract it was sometimes possible to observe mild vacuolization in decussated tracts at the contralateral side. Vacuolated areas were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy in order to explore the ultrastructural features of the holes. While control animals displayed axons with uniform and regular myelin sheaths, in the NA-injected rats some dilated and irregularly shaped myelin sheath were observed in transverse sections of the SM (Figure 2E , dotted line encloses one myelinated axon). Such dilated myelin sheath displayed an inner cavity, probably corresponding to the vacuoles observed by conventional histological techniques. Despite its larger diameter, the dilated myelin sheaths themselves were apparently similar to that observed in non-affected axons, or in axons from untreated rats. Within the vacuoles, an axon was consistently found, partially in contact with the myelin sheath (arrows in Figures 2C-E) . Therefore, the cavity seems to arise from the space between the axonal surface and the innermost myelin wrap. Rarely axons showing a disorganized myelin sheath were found (asterisk in Figure 2F ). These images are compatible with a partial disruption of the interaction between the innermost lamella of myelin and the axonal membrane. Concerning the time course, myelin vacuolation reached a peak between 4 and 7 days postinjection of NA (compare Figure 3A with Figure 3B ). However, from day 15 on, the number and the size of the holes were significantly reduced (Figures 3C,D) , and 30 days after the NA injection, they were completely absent ( Figure 3D) . After 30 days, the SM and the fornix as well as the farthest myelinated tracts (e.g., the optic chiasm) were undistinguishable from those of non-injected rats, with a uniform hematoxylin-eosin staining and the absence of cavities.
