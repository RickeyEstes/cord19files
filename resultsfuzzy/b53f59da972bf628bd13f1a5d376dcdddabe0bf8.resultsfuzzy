Viruses can be inactivated by several methods, based on either physical or chemical mechanisms. We investigated five decontamination methods that are currently used for equipment, facilities, and waste decontamination: heat, alkaline treatment, sodium hypochlorite treatment, gaseous formol fumigation, and drying. It should be stressed that the data presented here have been obtained under our specific experimental conditions. Indeed, the virus sensitivity to inactivation depends on the virus environment and concentration. Thus, the methods presented here were validated with our specific suspensions and experimental conditions, and appropriate precautions should be taken when manipulating SARS-CoV under other laboratory conditions. Inactivation experiments using different pH values gave rise to unexpected results. When the pH was adjusted to pH13 or pH13.5, a strong decrease in the viral infectivity titer can be observed. However, the virus is not totally inactivated and even after 6 h of alkaline treatment, infectious particles can still be observed. Total inactivation is observed only after 24 h of treatment. These data are surprising as enveloped viruses are usually sensitive to such drastic alkaline conditions. The results from the experiments performed to evaluate the viral loss of the SARS-CoV due to drying on glass surface were also surprising: 35 -42 days were necessary to inactivate the virus to the detection limit of the technique. Other viruses, such as polio or rabies, can be inactivated by drying durations of approximately 72 and 144 h, respectively. In our experience, the SARS-CoV is the most resistant virus ever described in an industrial setting. The gaseous formaldehyde fumigation is a viral decontamination technique widely used throughout the world. We found that formol fumigation is totally inefficient on dried virus. However, virus in solution is efficiently inactivated. The two decontamination techniques tested here, drying and formaldehyde fumigation, reinforce the necessity to decontaminate the working areas in the laboratory, as well as the equipment, very frequently in order to avoid any drying of viral suspension onto glass or any other surface. Finally, sodium hypochlorite (2 ° Cl) and heat treatment were evaluated. The effect of sodium hypochlorite on dried virus is very rapid and efficient, as no infectious viral particles were recovered after washing the surface with sodium hypochlorite. Thermal decontamination was shown to be efficient at both 58 and 68 ° C. To achieve total inactivation of the SARS-CoV, 1 h heating at 68 ° C and 2 h heating at 58 ° C are necessary. Considering the decontamination data, the following strategy was put in place. All solid waste, as well as the equipment that could resist such a drastic treatment, was autoclaved. For liquid waste, the solutions were subjected to alkaline pH treatment for at least 2 h and then transferred into a tank for thermal decontamination at 105 ° C for 30 min. The laboratory facilities, and the equipment that could not be autoclaved, were decontaminated with 2 ° Cl sodium hypochlorite solutions, before being fumigated with gaseous formol. The data on decontamination of the SARS-CoV presented here show that existing decontamination strategies cannot be directly extrapolated to emerging viruses and that these inactivation conditions should be determined empirically for each virus. The difficulty with inactivating viruses remains the balance between fully validated inactivation and preservation of immunogenicity or epitopes associated with protection. It is well known that reagents used to inactivate viruses [betapropiolactone (BPL), formaldehyde] can change the outer membrane antigens with the risk of a reduced immunogenicity of the vaccine. For the inactivation of SARS-CoV, we chose to test BPL. Assays were performed to determine the best BPL concentration for inactivation while maintaining a good immune response in mice. Virus experiments encouraged us that the prototype vaccine could be produced in Vero cells using a single harvest totally compatible with our experience with inactivated poliovirus. Raw materials used to develop the candidate vaccine (serum and trypsin) were selected in accordance with current regulation. Calf serum was imported from Australia, and gamma irradiated prior to use. The trypsin was from porcine origin and also gamma irradiated. Extensive evaluation for adventitious agents was performed on the raw material, which included the search for cytopathogenic agents, hemadsorbing agents, and specific viral contaminants as bluetongue, reovirus, rabies, parainfluenza type 3, specific bovine viruses [adenovirus, parvovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)], bovine viral diarrhea, rhinotracheitis virus), and porcine viruses (parvovirus, adenovirus; transmissible gastroenteritis virus; hepatitis E virus, rabies virus, and porcine pestis virus).
