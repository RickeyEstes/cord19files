4.1. General trend of urbanization and agricultural pollution-related input intensity strict birth control policy of "one child for one family". The secondary and tertiary industry proportion grew by 21.18% between 1992 and 2013, with a 0.92% annual average rate of increase. In addition, a decreasing trend in the secondary and tertiary industry proportion was observed from 1993 to 1997 due to the soft landing policy engineered by the Chinese government to slow high inflation in the summer of 1993. Therefore, the development of secondary and tertiary industry in Hubei shifted from fast growth to slow growth. shows an increasing trend in the pollution-related agricultural input intensity in Hubei. The annual growth in the intensity of pesticide use was rapid at the beginning of the 1990s but then slowed. Chemical fertilizer use intensity grew faster than pesticide use intensity and agricultural plastic film use intensity. The intensity of chemical fertilizer use doubled during this period. Agricultural plastic film use intensity grew at a speed of 2.35%. In additional, there was a considerable increase of agricultural plastic film intensity in 2003. The primary cause was that the price of agricultural plastic film decreased because China's economy suffered a serious downturn in 2003 during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Keogh-Brown and Smith, 2008) . The low price of agricultural plastic film stimulated the increases of agricultural plastic film intensity in Hubei. The Mann-Kendall's test was applied to statistically detect the general trend (increase, decrease, or no significant change). The significant increasing trends were detected for urbanization and agricultural pollution-related input intensity since the values of UF k of UP, STP, PUI, CUI and AUI are positive, and the calculated probabilities are greater than the 95% significance level (Table 3) .
