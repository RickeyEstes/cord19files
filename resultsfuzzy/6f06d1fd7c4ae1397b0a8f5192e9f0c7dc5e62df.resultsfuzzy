A PEDV virus stock (USA/IN19338/2013 passage 7) with a known infectious titer of 5.62×10 5 TCID50/ml was 10-fold serially diluted into virus-negative cell culture medium, giving rise to theoretical infectious titers of 5.62×10 5 to 5.62×10 −5 TCID 50 /ml for the 10 0 to 10 −10 dilutions, respectively (Table 1) . Infectious titers of each virus dilution were back-titrated in Vero cells by end-point titration assay (TCID 50 /ml) and plaque assay (PFU/ml), with results summarized in Table 1 . The stock virus and 10 −1 to 10 −4 dilutions all had the same logarithms of titers as the theoretical titers based on the dilution factor, regardless of titration assays in the units of TCID 50 /ml or PFU/ml. The 10 −5 virus dilution had an infectious titer of 5 PFU/ml but remained undetected by the end-point titration assay in the unit of TCID 50 /ml. The 10 −6 to 10 −10 virus dilutions were undetected by either the end-point titration assay or the plaque assay during back titration. Each virus dilution was also tested in triplicate by a quantitative PEDV N gene-based rRT-PCR. The virus stock had an average Ct of 12.2 and the Ct values increased by roughly 3-4 for every 10-fold dilution until the 10 −7 dilution that had a Ct value of 37.62, beyond which all dilutions had Ct>45 (Table 1 ). This range of Ct values correlated to 2.1×10 10 genomic copies/ml in the virus stock through 689 genomic copies/ml in the 10 −7 dilution, and an undetected number of genomic copies/ml in all dilutions beyond that ( Table 1) . The PEDV dilutions 10 −3 to 10 −8 , having theoretical infectious titers of 5.62×10 2 to 5.62×10 −3 TCID 50 /ml and PCR Ct values of 24.22 to >45, together with virus-negative culture medium control, were selected to determine the infection outcomes in 5-day-old piglets and 3-week-old pigs ( Table 2 ).
