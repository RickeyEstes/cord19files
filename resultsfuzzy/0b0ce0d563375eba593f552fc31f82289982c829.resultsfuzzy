Of the 332 SARI cases, 309 (93%) patients had adequate specimens obtained for respiratory testing, and 134 (43%) tested positive for 142 viral respiratory pathogens: 49 (16%) were positive for influenza viruses, 25 (8Á1%) for HMPV, 20 (6Á5%) for PIV, 16 (5Á2%) for coronaviruses, 11 (3Á6%) for RSV, 10 (3Á2%) for rhinoviruses, four (1Á3%) for rhinovirus/ enterovirus, three (1Á0%) for enteroviruses, three (1Á0%) for adenoviruses, and zero for bocaviruses (Table 2) . Specimens were taken an average of 8 days after illness onset (range: 1-90 days). Patients whose specimens were collected within 7 days of the onset of symptoms were more likely to have a viral pathogen detected than those whose specimens were collected later (68% versus 32%, P = 0Á038). There were no differences in the clinical presentation of patients who tested positive for viral pathogens and those who tested negative except that the latter were more likely to be admitted to an ICU (Table S2) . Of the 233 patients with information on influenza vaccination and laboratory testing, 132 (57%) were vaccinated. Of these 132 patients, 76 (58%) tested negative for a virus. Among the 49 influenza-positive specimens, 76% were influenza A and 24% influenza B. While influenza A was more commonly detected in the beginning of the season (December to March), influenza B was detected throughout the season and was the only influenza virus identified between April and July ( Figure 1 The monthly distribution of non-influenza respiratory viruses is shown in Figure 2 . Their monthly distribution was similar to that of influenza viruses. Overall, 89% (n = 86) of respiratory viruses were identified between October and May. February had the highest number of viruses detected, especially for coronavirus (10/18, 56%) and HMPV (11/24, 46%). Over the four seasons, HMPV was the second most frequently detected virus circulating and the highest annual proportion of all HMPVs (71%) was seen in the 2013-2014 season. All four parainfluenza virus types were detected, but type 3 (50%) dominated. Compared to patients who tested positive for other viral pathogens, patients who tested positive for an influenza virus were significantly more likely to be intubated (29% versus 11%, P = 0Á032), have a headache (33% versus 18%, P = 0Á047), or have diabetes (47% versus 22%, P = 0Á03) ( Table 3 ). Compared to patients with no respiratory virus identified, patients with an influenza virus were significantly more likely to be female (61% versus 45%, P = 0Á047), have diabetes (47% versus 21%, P = 0Á007), or have renal disease (30% versus 6%, P = 0Á001). Patients with an influenza virus were significantly more likely to present within seven days of symptom onset compared to patients with no respiratory virus identified (94% versus 73%, P = 0Á003). Compared to SARI patients of other ages, children <5 years of age were significantly more likely to have a respiratory virus detected (82% versus 41%, P < 0Á0016). Among children <5 years positive for a respiratory virus, RSV was the most commonly identified virus (35%, n = 6/ 17). Additionally, 50% of mixed viral infections were observed among this age group (n = 3/6): enteroviruses/ RSV (n = 1), RSV/PIV3 (n = 1), and adenovirus/PIV 3 (n = 1). Among the 51 patients intubated, 16 (31%) tested positive for a viral respiratory pathogen. Of these 16 intubated cases, influenza virus was the most common (69%), followed by rhinovirus (13%), coronavirus (13%), and HMPV (6%). Eleven (39%) patients that died had a viral pathogen identified [influenza (n = 3), coronavirus (n = 3), HMPV (n = 2), parainfluenza virus (n = 2), and rhinovirus (n = 1)]. None of the three patients with an influenza virus reported being vaccinated for influenza.
