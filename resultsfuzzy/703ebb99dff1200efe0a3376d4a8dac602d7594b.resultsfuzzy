Copper(II) acetate reacts with o-nitrobenzoic acid and pyridine N-oxide resulting in the formation of the complex 1, [Cu 2 (o-NO 2 -C 6 H 4 COO) 4 (PNO) 2 ]. It has a dinuclear paddle wheel structure with two terminal pyridine N-oxide coordination (Fig. 1) . The complex exhibits characteristic IR stretching frequencies at 1614 and 1467 cm À1 due to the carboxylate stretching, the N-oxo stretching appears at 1227 cm À1 . The single-crystal X-ray analysis reveals that 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic P2 1 /c space group. The asymmetric unit of 1 consists of two o-nitrobenzoate ligands and one pyridine N-oxide ligand coordinated to a copper(II) centre. In the dinuclear molecule each of the copper centres (Cu1) adopts a square-pyramidal geometry with the four oxygen atoms O1, O2, O5 and O9 from four different carboxylate ligands residing at the corners of the basal plane. The apical position is occupied by the N-oxo, O8, of the pyridine N-oxide ligand. The basal atoms are almost coplanar and the Cu1 is positioned 0.224 Å above the basal plane. The bond lengths for the basal bonds (Cu-O1, Cu-O2, Cu-O5, Cu-O9) lie in the range 1.963-1.993 Å, while that of the axial bond (Cu1-O8) is 2.116 Å and the Cu-Cu separation is 2.686 Å which is normal for other copper complexes reported. With the intention of linking together the dinuclear paddle wheel units as formed in case of 1 we have reacted copper(II) acetate, benzoic acid with the 0 spacer 0 ligand 2,2 0 -bipyridyl-N,N 0dioxide. This ligand being a bidentate ligand resulted in the formation of the 1D coordination polymer 2 with the composition [Cu 2 (C 6 H 5 COO) 4 (2,2 0 -BPNO)] n . The 2,2 0 -bipyridyl-N,N 0 -dioxide ligand can act either as a chelating or as bridging ligand. This is possible because of the free rotation around the C-C single bond between the two rings of 2,2 0 -bipyridyl-N,N 0 -dioxide. In other words it can be said that 2,2 0 -bipyridyl-N,N 0 -dioxide can coordinate to metal centres either in a cis or a trans configuration as shown in Scheme 3. There are a few reports available on the chelating coordination mode of 2,2 0 -bipyridyl-N,N 0 -dioxide [43] [44] [45] . However, in case of the coordination polymer 2, the 2,2 0 -bipyridyl-N,N 0 -dioxide coordinates in the trans-fashion to bridge two paddle wheel units of copper(II) benzoate. The crystal structure of 2 is shown in Fig. 2 . It crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c and each asymmetric unit of 2 consists of one copper(II) atom, two benzoate ligands and half a 2,2 0 -bipyridyl-N,N 0 -dioxide molecule. Like in 1, here also each of the copper(II) centres adopts a square-pyramidal geometry, with the N-oxo of 2,2 0 -bipyridyl-N,N 0 -dioxide apically coordinated. Four of the carboxylate oxygens O1, O2, O3 and O4 occupy the corners of the basal plane, with bond lengths spanning the 1.957-1.983 Å range. The apical oxygen O5 is residing at a distance 2.171 Å from the copper(II) centre and the copper(II) centre is at a distance of 0.202 Å from the basal plane. The Cu-Cu distance in the paddle wheel unit is 2.639 Å, while the smallest CuÁÁÁCu distance between two paddle wheel units is 8.035 Å. Moreover the two planes of the two aromatic rings of 2,2 0 -bipyridyl-N,N 0 -dioxide form an angle of 67.12°which differs significantly from those reported for the cis-coordination geometries. A similar reaction of copper(II) acetate monohydrate and benzoic acid with 4,4 0 -bipyridyl-N,N 0 -dioxide led to an one-dimensional coordination polymer 3 of composition [Cu 2 (C 6 H 5 COO) 4 -(4,4 0 -BPNO)] n with the paddle wheel building blocks of copper(II) benzoate bridged through the spacer N-oxide ligand. We have evidence that the complex belongs to the triclinic space group P 1 and the structure of the coordination polymer is as shown in 3 . As in 2, in the coordination polymer 3 also the copper(II) adopts the expected tetragonal pyramidal geometry. However, the difference comes in the orientation of the 4,4 0 -bipyridyl-N,N 0dioxide ligand which gets distorted may be due to the geometry forced by the copper(II) ions. The two aromatic rings of the ligand are inclined at an angle 23.96°to each other, departing from the reported ones where they are mostly coplanar [10] . The separation between two nearest paddlewheel units is 12.57 Å. Some of the important bond lengths and angles are tabulated in Table 2 . The reaction between copper(II) acetate monohydrate, p-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4,4 0 -bipyridyl-N,N 0 -dioxide leads to the formation of another 1D coordination polymer 4 with compo- Fig. 4 which shows a square-pyramidal geometry around the copper centre. Two of the coordination come from two benzoate ligands, two from the 4,4 0 -bipyridyl-N,N 0 -dioxide and the rest from the aquo-ligand. The oxygen O7 from 4,4 0 -bipyridyl-N,N 0dioxide occupies the apical position with a Cu-O bond distance of 2.527 Å. Here, the distance between two nearest copper(II) centres bridged by 4,4 0 -bipyridyl-N,N 0 -dioxide is 12.007 Å. The one-dimensional chains interact through the hydrogen bonds O6-H6AÁÁÁO2 and O6-H6BÁÁÁO4 between aquo-groups and the carboxylate oxygen and O8-H8ÁÁÁO7, between the hydroxy group on the aromatic carboxylate ring and one of the N-oxo groups. The hydrogen bonded self assembly is shown in the Fig. 4b along with the coordination environment around Cu1 in Fig. 4a . A completely different product is found to be formed in the reaction between copper(II) acetate and nicotinic acid N-oxide where six coordination rather than five coordination of copper(II) is observed. The reaction yields the one-dimensional coordination polymer 5 with the composition [Cu(NicoNO) 2 Á2H 2 O] n Á4nH 2 O crystallizing in the monoclinic space group P2 1 /c. The crystal structure of 5 has already been reported [47] with space group P2 1 and then correctly reinterpreted by Clemente [48] and is not discussed here. However the magnetic measurement for 5 is carried out and discussed in the next section. It should be noted that the structure contains as many as four water molecules per copper core. These water molecules are strongly hydrogen bonded to each other form-ing net-like structures of hexameric aqua-units as shown in Fig. 5a . These aqua-nets surround the one-dimensional chain of the metal complex separating them from each other as shown in Fig. 5b . This makes a layered structure comprising of polymeric chains of the metal complex embedding a layered sheets of infinite chains like structures of water. At room temperature the complexes 1-3 are ESR silent; this could be due to antiferromagnetic coupling between the two copper(II) centres within the paddle wheel units. The ESR spectrum of 4 shows a well resolved four line spectra typical of copper(II) monomeric units expected for the coupling of the electron with the nuclear spin. On the other hand the ESR spectrum of complex 5 is axial in character (please refer to Supplementary material).
