MG-132 and Bortezomib inhibit proteasome activity without inducing cytotoxic effects. In order to analyze the effect of proteasome inhibition on CPXV replication, the proteasome activity in HeLa cells treated with two different inhibitors was tested. For this purpose, different concentrations of MG-132 and Bortezomib were analyzed for their inhibition of the chymotryptic-like proteasome activity in HeLa cells. Both compounds inhibit primarily the chymotrypsin-like site of the 26 S proteasome but may also act on the caspaselike site in a concentration-dependent manner 24 . A complete inhibition of proteasome activity was only observed using 10 µM MG-132 and 1 µM Bortezomib, which represented the highest inhibitor concentrations tested (Fig. 1a) . These concentrations have already been applied in previous studies, though proteasome inhibition has not been shown 2,3 . Analysis of the ATP amount revealed about 80% cell viability of inhibitor-treated cells after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 1b) . Inhibitor-induced release of lactate dehydrogenase, as a measure of cytotoxicity, was below 5% (Fig. 1c) , confirming acceptable conditions for infection experiments.
