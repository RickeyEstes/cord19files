The synthesis of the desired compounds (4a-j and 5a-j) is depicted in Scheme 1. Initially, the a-aminophosphonate compounds were prepared in good yields via the Kabachnik-Fields reaction. The 4-[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]benzaldehyde 1 was reacted with diethylphosphite and corresponding amine in acetonitrile using molecular iodine as catalyst [22] [23] [24] . The latter is low-priced, readily available, non-metallic, and nontoxic. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h to get compounds 2a-j. The next step is deprotection of the trimethylsilyl group. For this purpose, tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) in tetrahydrofurane (THF) was used to give the terminal alkyne [25] . The structures of 2e, 2f, 3d, and 3g were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (Fig. 1 ). According to the crystal data, the structures are similar for these compounds. The P-C bond has a staggered conformation, with the two six-membered groups with respect to the P --O double bond. The two benzene rings are almost perpendicular in all four compounds. In each crystal structure (2e, 3d, and 3g), the molecules are arranged as centrosymmetric or pseudocentrosymmetric dimers related by two N-HÁ Á ÁO --P hydrogen bonds. On the other hand, in the crystal structure of 2f, the hydrogen bond N-HÁ Á ÁO --P is not found, and the molecules are arranged as centrosymmetric dimers linked by C methyl -HÁ Á ÁO --P hydrogen bonds [26] . Next, the 1,2,3-triazolyl-nucleosides were prepared using the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. For this, the terminal alkynes 3a-j and b-azido-ribose [27] were coupled using the Cu alkyne-azide cycloaddition in basic medium (triethylamine) and the reaction was carried out under microwave irradiation [28] . Microwave heating has been shown to increase reaction yields and to speed up reaction time [29] , b-azido-ribose is slightly unstable under micro-wave conditions and was used in excess. The configuration at the anomeric carbon C1 0 is retained as it is present in the b-azido-ribose. The hydroxyl functions were protected by benzoyl groups prior to the CuAAC reaction in order to increase the solubility of the compounds. The structures of all compounds were confirmed on the basis of 1 H, 13 C NMR spectra as well as by high-resolution mass spectrometry. In the 1 H NMR spectra of the intermediates, the triazole proton appears as a singlet in the aromatic region while the anomeric proton appears as a multiplet around 6 ppm. The last step involves the removal of the benzoyl protecting groups from O2 0 , O3 0 , and O5 0 positions of D-ribose 4a-j using sodium methoxide (NaOMe) in methanol [30] to afford the desired 1,2,3-triazole nucleosides 5a-j (Table 1 ).
