Full results are shown in Table S2 and the enriched pathways are shown in Table 3 and Table S4 . Since a large number of proteins are involved, we only highlight a few top pathways here. Some of top pathways include cytokine and cytokine receptor interaction, VEGFA-VEGF2 signaling pathway, JAS-STAT signaling pathway etc. Table 4 and S5 shows the list of drugs whose targets overlap with the top-ranked proteins. Note that the tables do not explicitly discern the direction of effects of the drugs. A few drugs target more than one protein. If they are ranked by the number of proteins targeted, the top drugs are fostamatinib, copper, zinc and zonisamide, which target >=3 proteins.
