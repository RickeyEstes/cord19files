A stepwise multiple regression analysis was carried out to further reveal the correlations among emotion scores and coping strategies. In the regression analysis, emotion scores was used as the dependent variable, whereas two dimensions of coping strategies were used as independent variables (Table 3) author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This result is consistent with existing studies. This result is consistent with the results of a recent study by Xu and Zhang [21] , who found that 85.37% (35 patients) of the first-line nurses fighting COVID-19 had adverse emotional reactions, including 2 nurses with depression, 16 nurses with anxiety, and 21 nurses with terror. During the SARS outbreak, many nurses showed conflicting roles as medical service providers and parents. On the one hand, they felt altruistic and professionally responsible. On the other hand, they were afraid and guilty that they might infect their families [22] . Nickell (2004)'s study found that about 20% of the population suffers from emotional depression during SARS, and the incidence of nurses is as high as 45% in Toronto [23] . Long-term research has generally found that women have significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, and loneliness than men. This is considered to be related to gender traits. Women themselves attach more importance to their inner experiences and self-perceptions, their emotions are more fragile and sensitive, and they are more vulnerable to depression, anxiety and Loneliness [24] . Our study support this conclusion, which finds that women show more severe anxiety and fear than men. During the SARS outbreak, Gao et al. (2003) found that more women than men call for psychological counseling, and the content of the consultation is mainly emotional issues [24] . This indicates that there are gender differences in psychological characteristics in the face of public health emergencies. This study also found that participants from urban showed more anxiety and fear than participants from rural, but rural participants showed more sadness than urban participants. This may be that the city is densely populated and has a large flow of people, and the epidemic situation in urban is more serious. The COVID-19 is more closer to the participants urban than the rural participants. Urban participants are more concerned about whether they may be infected, so they are more anxious and fearful. On the contrary, rural participants pay more attention to the illness of others, and have sadness for patients. In addition, we found that the severity of the epidemic in the city has no difference in individual emotions, which may indicate that the individual is not very All rights reserved.

However, this study found that the more precise spatial distance between the epidemic and the participants significantly affected individual emotions. This study found that participants in the community or administrative village affected by COVID-19 (with diagnosed patients or isolators) had stronger anxiety and anger than those in the community or administrative village where were not affected by Participants in the community or administrative village with diagnosed patients reported significantly higher levels of anxiety and anger than participants in the community or administrative village with isolators. The presence of diagnosed patients in a community or administrative village means a higher probability of being infected. The geographical location of COVID-19 patients and the spatial distance of participants are a reflection of psychological distance. The closer the psychological distance is. The more people feel the danger, the more sexual and threatening, the more intense anxiety and anger. Our results and the research results during the outbreak of SARS support this conclusion, and this change is also in line with the psychological development law of people in response to stressful events [25] . College students often use immature or negative coping strategies instead of positive problem coping when faced with the pressure caused by public health emergencies [26] . As a medical worker with clinical work experience, the nurse has more knowledge and strategies to face similar pressures. This is consistent with our research, which found that nurses are more proactive in using problem-focused coping than nursing college students. This study also found that women are more likely to use problem-focused coping than men, and less likely to use emotional-focused coping. As mentioned earlier, women are more vulnerable and sensitive on emotional issues, so emotional-focused coping is rarely used when dealing with stress. In addition, this study also found that participants in the communities or administrative villages with isolators were more likely to using emotional-focused coping than those in the communities or administrative villages where was not affected or with diagnosed patients. This may be because when the communities or administrative All rights reserved.

When diagnosed patient (that is, the spatial distance is particularly close) appears in the community or administrative village, participants may not use sufficient emotional-focused coping due to the psychological typhoon eye effect [27] . In subsequent analysis, it was found that anxiety, fear, and anger were significantly positively related to problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping. That is to say, there may be "the more coping the more panic" or "the more panic the more coping" or the "coping-panic cycle" The phenomenon. An analysis of the direction of the relationship between emotion and coping found that problem-focused coping has a significant predictive effect on anxiety and sadness. The explanatory power of anxiety is 3.4%, and the explanatory power of sadness is 0.9%, which indicating that the more problem-focused coping, the more anxious and sadness. Although both problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping have significant predictive effects on fear, the total explanatory power is 6%, but the explanatory power of problem-focused coping is 5.6%, and the explanatory power of emotion-focused coping is only 0.4%. Therefore, the more problem-focused coping, the more fear. Problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping both have a significant predictive effect on anger, with a total explanatory power of 2.6% and a problem-focused coping interpretation of 2.2%, but the explanatory power of emotion-focused coping is only 0.4%. This shows that problem-focused coping can predict emotional responses to a certain extent. This shows that there may be a phenomenon that "the more problem-focused coping, the more anxious, the more angry , the more sadness". Subsequently, our conducted a regression analysis on coping strategies, which found that fear and anger have a predictive effect on Problem-focused coping. The total explanatory power is 6%, the explanatory power of fear is 5.5%, and the explanatory power of anger is only 0.5%. Anger has a predictive effect on Emotion-focused coping, with an explanatory power of 2.2%. It can be seen that people may be the All rights reserved.

Anxiety and sadness have no predictive effect on coping strategies. Combining the two parts of the regression analysis, it can be speculated that there may be a cycle of "the more fear-the more problem-focused coping" (forward interpretation power is 5.6%, reverse interpretation power is 5.5%), "the more angry, the more emotion-focused coping (2.2%) "," The more problem-focused coping, the more anxious (3.4%), the more angry (2.2%), the more sadness (0.9%) ". During the outbreak of COVID-19, gender, urban/rural, and spatial distance will affect the anxiety, fear, sadness and anger and coping strategies of nurse and nursing college students. There is also a large emotional difference between nurses and nursing college students. Nurses have stronger emotional responses and are more willing to adopt Problem-focused coping. This study further reveals the direction of the relationship between emotional responses and coping strategies. In the outbreak of COVID-19, we suggest that hospitals should focus on providing psychological support to nurses, providing timely psychological assistance, training in coping strategies, providing adequate medical protective equipment, and taking a variety of interventions to block the spread of infectious diseases to form a medical environment where COVID-19 stops spreading in hospitals. It has created an optimistic environment and guarantees for personal safety for nurses, thereby enabling nurses to carry out ambulance work with high quality, and to provide a strong guarantee for resolutely winning the battle against epidemic prevention.
