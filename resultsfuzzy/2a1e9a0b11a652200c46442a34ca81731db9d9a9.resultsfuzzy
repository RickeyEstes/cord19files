Diol 5 was prepared from commercially available 3␤-hydroxy-5␣-cholestane (1) by the four step synthesis shown in Scheme 1 [9] [10] [11] . Compound 5 was purified by successive vacuum-dry column chromatography on normal and C 18 silica gel and used as starting material for the synthesis of compounds 6-13. Triethylamine-sulfur trioxide complex was selected as the sulfating reagent owing to its facile preparation [8] and the stability of the triethylammonium salts of sulfate esters [12] . Treatment of diol 5 with 6.3 equivalents of triethylaminesulfur trioxide complex at 95 • C afforded the ammonium sulfate of compound 8, which was transformed via ion exchange into the disodium salt 8 (Scheme 2). On the other hand, the reaction of compound 5 with 2 equivalents of the sulfating reagent at room temperature rendered after ion exchange sodium 2␤,3␣-dihydroxy-5␣-cholestane 3-sulfate (6) and sodium 2␤,3␣-dihydroxy-5␣-cholestane 2-sulfate (7) in a 6.5:3.5 ratio, together with minor amounts of the disulfated derivative 8 (Scheme 2). Compounds 6, 7, and 8 were purified by preparative reversed-phase HPLC and characterized by HRFABMS and 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy (Tables 1 and 2) . The assignments of the NMR signals were derived from 1 H-1 H COSY and HETCOR experiments. Disodium 2␤,3␣-dihydroxy-5␣-cholestane disulfate (8) showed two methine signals at δ 4.73 (H-2) and 4.70 (H-3) , characteristic of the presence of two sulfate groups at C-2 and C-3 [13] . This is in accordance with the chemical shifts observed for C-2 (76.1) and C-3 (76.1) in the 13 C NMR spectrum. The 13 C NMR spectra of monosulfated compounds 6 and 7 differed in the chemical shifts of C-1 (δ 41.0 in 6, 38.8 in 7), C-2 (δ 70.0 in 6, 78.8 in 7), C-3 (δ 78.5 in 6, 69.0 in 7), and C-4 (δ 30.3 in 6, 32.5 in 7). The downfield shift of 9.5 ppm for C-3 and the upfield shift of 2.2 ppm for C-4 in compound 6 indicated that the sulfate group was located at C-3. These values confirm the assignment of the position of the sulfate group in ring A for disodium (20R)-2␤,3␣,21-trihydroxy-5␣-cholest-24-ene-3,21-disulfate, isolated previously by us from the antarctic ophiuroid A. agassizii [6] . The presence of the sulfate group at C-2 in 7 was confirmed by the downfield shift of 8.8 ppm for C-2 and the upfield shift of 2.2 ppm for C-1. 1 Looking forward for a major selectivity in the obtention of monosulfated analogs, an alternative synthetic strategy was tried (Scheme 3). Diol 5 was treated with acetic anhydride in pyridine rendering the diacetylated compound 9, which was submitted to selective deprotection with BBTO. This reagent has been utilized for the deprotection of a variety of steroid esters in non-hydrolytic conditions, in particular in the selective hydrolysis of the 3␤-acetyl group in the presence of the 6␣ one in 3␤,6␣-diacetoxy-5␣-pregnan-20-one [14] . As shown in Scheme 2, when a solution of diacetate 9 in toluene and BBTO was refluxed for 5 h, a mixture of monoacetylated compounds 10 and 11 was obtained in 89% yield in a 2.7:7.3 ratio. Both monoacetylated derivatives were separated and purified by chromatography and treated separately with triethylamine-sulfur trioxide complex in the same reaction conditions used for the monosulfation of diol 5 to give the sulfated analogs 12 and 13. It is to note that while sulfation of compound 11 rendered only compound 13, compound 10 afforded the expected sulfated analog 12 together with compound 7 derived from the deacetylation of 12. As compounds 7 and 12 were easily separated by HPLC, compound 7 was further transformed into 12 by a simple acetylation reaction. 1 H and 13 C NMR data of compound 12 (Tables 1 and 2) confirmed that the sulfate group is located at C-2 (δ C 76.0 ppm, δ H 4.44 ppm) and the acetoxy group is attached to C-3 (δ C 72.2 ppm, δ H 5.11 ppm). The spectroscopic data of 13 revealed that the 2␤-hydroxy group remained protected (δ C 72.6 ppm, δ H 5.14 ppm) while the sulfation took place at the free 3␣-hydroxy group (δ C 75.5 ppm, δ H 4.40 ppm). Again, assignment of proton and carbon resonances was based on the analysis of 1 H, 13 C, DEPT, 1 H-1 H COSY, and HETCOR NMR experiments. A great selectivity between positions 2 and 3 was observed for these reactions. Thus, in the monosulfation of diol 5, the analog sulfated at C-3 (6) was obtained as the major product and in the deprotection reaction of the diacetylated compound (9) with BBTO the 2␤-acetoxy-3␣-hydroxy derivative 13 was the predominant product. These results indicated that, as it was expected, groups attached to C-3 with ␣ configuration were more reactive than those attached to C-2 (␤) because of the steric hindrance due to the axial methyl group (C-19) at C-10 ( Fig. 2) . The antiviral activity of the five compounds was tested against HSV-2, the agent responsible for primary and recurrent infections of mucous membranes, genital lesions, neonatal infections, and meningitis [15] . From the data shown in Table 3 , compounds 7 and 8 were the most active against HSV-2 with IC 50 values of 19.3 and 23.9 g/ml, respectively. Monosulfated steroid 6, differing from 7 in the position of the sulfate group as well as acetylated and sulfated compound 13 were not active against HSV-2 at a concentration up to 25 g/ml. The four steroids also showed virucidal activity against HSV-2 with values of VC 50 ranging from 19.4 to 76.0 g/ml. Due to its low cytotoxic effect on Vero cells, the monosulfated steroid 12 containing an acetyl group at C-2 was assayed for antiviral activity at a higher concentration. Nevertheless, only a weak inhibitory activity against HSV-2 was observed (IC 50 = 90.5 g/ml). No virucidal effect of this compound was observed up to 100 g/ml. Of all the synthetic compounds tested, disulfated steroid 8 showed the best selectivity index (SI = 2.8). This result enabled us to test the antiviral activity of 8 against two pathogenic viruses in humans: JV and DEN-2. JV causes a severe disease in humans known as Argentine hemorrhagic fever [16] and DEN infection results in acute febrile illness or a more severe manifestation known as DEN hemorrhagic fever-shock syndrome [17] . Derivative 8 was not active against JV at a concentration up to 25 g/ml, while it elicited a marked DEN-2 inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 16.9 ± 0.2 g/ml). Several sulfated polyhydroxysterols have been recently isolated from sponges [18] . Most of these natural products are characterized by the 2␤,3␣,6␣-tri-O-sulfate functions but several bioactive sterols sulfated at C-2 (␤) and C-3 (␣) containing additional alkylation in the side chain have been isolated from the sponges Petrosia weinbergi [13, 19] ( [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] and Pachastrella sp. [20] (19) (Fig. 3) . Weinbesterols A (14) and B (15) and orthoesterol disulfates A (16), B (17) , and C (18) exhibited in vitro activity against the feline leukemia virus (FeLV), mouse influenza virus (PR8), and mouse corona virus. Compound 14 was also active in vitro against HIV. Halistanol disulfate B (19) was active in the endothelin-converting enzyme assay while the corresponding diol was totally inactive. In order to determine the role of the sulfate groups in the antiviral activity of disulfated steroid 8, we evaluated the in vitro activity of diol 5 against HSV-2. Although compound 5 showed no cytotoxic effect on Vero cells (CC 50 > 200 g/ml) it was not active against HSV-2 at a concentration up to 50 g/ml and showed no virucidal effect (VC 50 > 100 g/ml). These results are indicative of the role of the sulfate groups in the antiviral activity of 8. Due to its antiviral activity, disulfated steroid 8 is a good model compound for further introducing additional functional groups at the steroidal skeleton or its side chain in order to evaluate structure-activity correlations in the inhibitory activity against pathogenic viruses in humans.
