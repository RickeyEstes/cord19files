A motivating use case for this approach was to develop a framework for integrated, network-based prioritization of targets for perturbation and validation. We compared the module level results to those attained by use of a naïve correlation-based method. The naïve results took the form of two ranked lists for each data type. In the lists, there were both negative and positive correlations to the overall pathology phenotype. After mapping peptides and transcripts to Entrez IDs, correlation to the overall pathology phenotype, and the correlation between data types was compared (See Supplementary Figure 4) . While some peptide-transcript pairs showed both strong correlation to the phenotype and strong correlation across data types, 33.1% of peptide-transcript pairs were essentially uncorrelated (across data type correlation, −0.1 < r < 0.1), and 4.6% of peptide-transcript pairs were anti-correlated (r < −0.3). The naïve top ranked peptides and transcripts were not necessarily the most central within a given module. In transcript module 1, the most central (by correlation to the module eigenvector) was ranked 4th in the list of positive correlations. The next two top ranked module transcripts were not in the naïve top 10. On the peptide side, in module 4, the top ranked peptide was ranked 10th in the naïve list. This is due to the fact that the module construction is independent of any phenotype measurement. Module structure is a result of entities sharing a pattern of expression, rather than sharing a correlation with some external measurement. The naïve results showed a reduction in significance compared to the module level tests. Four sets were taken from the ranked lists: 151 positively correlated peptides (PCP), 151 negatively correlated peptides (NCP), 130 positively correlated transcripts (PCT), and 130 negatively correlated transcripts (NCT). The results are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . The PCP set of 151 peptides resulted in four significant GO terms, with Bonferroni adjusted p-values ranging from 2.67e-03 to 2.55e-02. The NCP set showed no significant GO term enrichment after Bonferroni adjustment. On the other hand, the PCT set of 130 transcripts showed 16 significant GO terms, with Bonferroni adjusted pvalues in the range of 9.14e-11 to 2.24e-02. The NCT set showed three significant GO terms, Bonferroni p-value range of 2.61e-04 to 1.29e-02. Two of the four significant GO terms found in the PCP set were also found in the PCT set ("protein polymerization" and "cellular macromolecular complex assembly"). However, one GO term, "cellular response to interleukin-4" (adj. p-value 2.67e-03), was not found in the enrichment results for both the naïve transcript sets and the peptide modules. From the PCT set, eight of ten of the most significant GO terms were also found in the bipartite module graph results. The two that were not included were "regulation of actin filament length" (adj. p-value 1.07e-04) and "regulation of actin filament polymerization" (adj. p-value 3.96e-04). Enrichment in the NCT set showed one term that was also found in the bipartite module graph, and two terms, including "xenobiotic metabolic process" (adj. p-value 7.77e-03) and "response to xenobiotic stimulus" (adj. p-value 1.29e-02), which were not. The module level organization provided more significance in enrichment tests compared to the naïve results. In peptide modules, the most significant results were found in peptide module 7 (not part of the module-graph) for GO terms "cellular component biogenesis" (adj. p-value 1.94e-17), "cellular macromolecular complex assembly" (adj. p-value 2.47e-17) and "nucleosome assembly" (adj. p-value 8.29e-12) where 15 of 36 Entrez IDs were present. In the NCP results, where the expression profile is negatively correlated with pathology, no GO terms were significantly enriched, whereas in the module-graph, there were sixteen significantly enriched GO terms. On the module level, highly ranked members (by module centrality), showed little overlap across data types in terms of shared Entrez IDs, even in the presence of significant module membership overlap (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) . Regardless, we found that significant GO term enrichment was observed to be overlapping across the data types. By utilizing the module sub-graph, the most central members were functionally compared, producing potentially novel connections to investigate. An example was found in the module sub-graph including transcript module 4 and peptide modules 12 and 13 (See Figure 4) . The most central members (r > 0.8) enriched the same GO terms, and in taking the union across modules, each data type brings unique, and functionally related, members to the analysis.
