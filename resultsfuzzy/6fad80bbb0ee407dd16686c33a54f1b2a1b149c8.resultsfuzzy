With the aim of validating the mean-field results, we next perform large scale numerical simulations on random (ER like) networks (generated using the Watts-Strogatz (WS) model with rewiring probability p = 1) and BA scale-free networks. All simulation results are averages over 100 independent runs and, unless otherwise stated, the size of the networks is N = 5000. Moreover, we set the average degree of both kinds of graphs to be ⟨k⟩ = 8 and simulations have been done using a recovery rate γ = 1. Fig. 2 shows the steady-state density of infected individuals or prevalence ρ(∞) as a function of the effective spreading rate λ 0 in both networks. Here we do not consider any recovery delay, that is, T = 0. In the figure, the arrows correspond to the analytical results for the epidemic thresholds for several values of α as indicated. In most cases, the analytical predictions agree well with the results of numerical simulations. However, for α = 0 and A = 3, the theoretical results are slightly different to the numerical ones, which we think is due to finite size effects. In any case, the figure nicely shows that the critical thresholds for an outbreak to occur can be largely altered by this scheme. On the other hand, Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of the second mechanism -the delayed recovery -when it is the only ingredient at work with respect to the standard case. Again, the results from numerical simulations are in accordance with our mean-field calculations and confirm that if infected individuals remain so for longer times, the critical threshold is reduced. Another scenario of interest corresponds to the case in which the spreading rate is inversely proportional to the degree of each individual (i.e. λ = λ o k −1 which means that α = 0). As it can be shown, in this case, in what regards the epidemic thresholds whether the network is homogeneous or heterogeneous is completely irrelevant, provided that both kinds of graphs have the same ⟨k⟩. Fig. 4 shows the numerical results, which confirm that the underlying networks do not determine the epidemic thresholds. Actually, they are the same in both panels for all values of T simulated. Fig. 5 describes what happens when both mechanisms are simultaneously active. Essentially, a delay in recovery will make the epidemic threshold smaller than for the standard case and unless the dependence of the spreading rate compensates for this effect, the disease-free regime will be shortened, as it happens after our parameter selection in this case. Finally, with the aim to clarify the nature of the small discrepancies between numerical results and the analytical predictions of Eq. (20), in Fig. 6 we consider the influence of network size on the epidemic threshold. Results highlight that, as expected, the critical threshold decreases as the network size increases. Simultaneously, the mismatch between numerical and theoretical values drops, suggesting that the initial differences are due to finite size effects.
