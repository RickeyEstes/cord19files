In order to con®rm that the observed intervesicular lipid mixing was indeed the result of membrane fusion, suspensions of LUV were directly visualized under an electron microscope, before and after the treatment with the peptides. Brie¯y, PC/PG (1:1) LUV of 100 nm diameter (200 mM) were incubated for 15 minutes alone, with SV-208, or Mu-SV-208 (peptide/lipid molar ratio of 0.12) in PBS, before visualization. Figure 3 shows representative micrographs of the LUV (a) without any peptide, (b) with SV-208, and (c) with Mu-SV-208. It is evident from the micrographs that the lipid mixing observed with SV-208 appears concurrently with an increase in size of the vesicles, con®rming that the ability of SV-208 to induce lipid mixing is the result of membrane fusion. Such a size increase was not observed with the N-terminal fusion peptide (Ghosh & Shai, 1999) .
