A total of 39 pharmacists responded to the invitation to participate in this study. Of those who responded, 28 met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate. Individual interviews were then scheduled. One participant dropped out before the interview because of personal scheduling reasons; consequently, a total of 27 pharmacists were interviewed for this study. A demographic profile of these participants is provided in Table 1 . As indicated, most of the participants involved in this study were community practitioners during the time of both SARS and the blackout. Interviews were undertaken pursuant to the finalized semistructured protocol ( Fig. 1 ). In addition to audio recording of interviews, extensive field notes were maintained to provide clarification of transcripts. Pharmacists who agreed to participate in this study represented both hospital and community practices. After iterative coding, categorization, analysis, and checking of data, 5 key themes emerged: 1. During times of civil crisis, pharmacies become frontline health care facilities During the SARS crisis and the blackout, large institutional care centers, including large clinics and hospitals, were forced to remain closed, in an attempt to prevent the spread of the virus from institutions to the general community. As a result, during the SARS outbreak the health care system literally was suspended for many patients. Elective surgeries, new admissions, and even emergency care were redirected to other, nonaffected cities or centers where possible, or patients simply had to go without access to institutionally based physicians and nurses. During this time, study participants reported that their community pharmacies experienced a large increase in the number of patients they saw and an increase in the acuity level. Roger: Where else are they supposed to go, right? The hospitals in quarantine, there's no clinics open.so they come to the pharmacy. It was really, really stressfuldpeople were desperate and asking all kinds of questions because they had nowhere else to turn to. We were still open, we sell (medications) so they would come and ask us everything. I know we're not allowed to diagnose, but what choice do you have when everything else is closed? Sandy: (I've been a pharmacist for 35 years.) The SARS time was probably the most rewarding time in my career, because for once the patients actually really really needed us. Any of them who had their doctors in the hospital, well, the hospitals were all closed, so they would come to us. I really think we shone, you know pharmacy real rose to the occasion and kept the (health care) system going. Whereas some participants reported a sense of enthusiasm and excitement at being called upon to engage in frontline health care services such as this, other participants felt quite overwhelmed and very nervous.
