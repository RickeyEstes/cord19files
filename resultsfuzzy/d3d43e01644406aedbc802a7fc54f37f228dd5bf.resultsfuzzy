[121] G3BPs, along with Caprin1, regulate the IFN system during viral attack to reduce infection. G3BPs are targeted by viral components to compromise the cellbased immune response to the virus. [34] G3BPs are essential constituents of CHIKV and HCV viral fractions. Facilitates viral replication and assembly. [105, 113] U. Alam activity of the p53 signalling pathway [43] . Regardless of their mechanism of action, both G3BP proteins inhibit p53 functions and hence play an accessory role in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, G3BP2 is transcriptionally activated by the androgen receptor (AR) and facilitates the proliferation of prostate cancer [44] . Upon androgen-mediated induction, G3BP2 interacts with the SUMO-E3 ligase, RanBP2, which facilitates the AR-dependent sumoylation of p53 and regulates the translocation of p53 from nucleus to cytoplasm [45] . The strong cytoplasmic localization of p53 is clinically correlated with elevated G3BP2 expression and predicts poor prognosis and disease progression to the hormone-refractory state, suggesting a role of G3BP2 in cancer metastasis and progression [45] . More recently, it has been found that tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) interacts with G3BP2 and is responsible for modulating the cellular localization of p53. TRIM25 is involved in the negative regulation of p53 through an interaction with G3BP2 and its over-expression suppresses the p53 activity via a G3BP2mediated export mechanism [46] . This study also suggests that TRIM25 could serve as a positive regulator of p53 sumoylation induced by a G3BP2/RanBP2 complex and a negative regulator of p53 ubiquitination induced by MDM2 [46] . Furthermore, USP10, a binding partner of G3BP2, is also an androgen responsive gene and is transcriptionally activated by the AR. USP10 regulates androgen-mediated signalling and inhibits p53 activities by regulating G3BP2 expression. The association of USP10 with G3BP2 suppresses p53 signalling which correlates to a poor prognosis in prostate cancer, highlighting an oncogenic role of USP10 in prostate cancer via G3BP2 [47] . These studies suggest a role of G3BPs, specifically G3BP2, in the mediating the tumour suppressor activities of p53 and thereby implicating it in cancer development or progression. Interestingly, G3BP1 and G3BP2 play an important role in SGs formation [48] and this activity has also been associated with cancer progression. Various cellular stresses like hypoxia and heat shock induce SGs formation, however, of particular interest is the finding that chemotherapeutics may also induce SGs formation which may in turn inhibit some stress responsive pathways (like the MAPK pathway) and hence suppresses apoptosis [49] , suggesting yet another role of G3BPs in cancer progression. In this case, through the regulation of the MAPK pathway [50] .
