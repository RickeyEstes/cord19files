Characterization of CD11c + cells within the CNS following MHV infection of CCL3 +/+ and CCL3 À/À mice To characterize the populations of cells present within the CNS of MHV-infected mice, cells were harvested at days 0, 2, and 5 post-infection (p.i.) and immunophenotyped by flow cytometry. We chose to focus our attention on markers that are associated with professional antigen presenting cells such as DC as recent studies have indicated DC-like cells can be detected within the brains under inflammatory conditions (Fisher and Reichmann, 2001; Fischer et al., 2000) . Furthermore, we have previously determined that CCL3 mRNA expression is detected within the CNS early (b3 days) and therefore may participate in the appearance of CD11c + cells within the brain following MHV infection (Trifilo et al., 2003) . Therefore, we sought to characterize the populations of CD11c + cells within the brain following MHV infection of CCL3 +/+ and CCL3 À/À mice. Results in Fig. 1A indicate the frequency of CD11c + cells present within the CNS of naRve CCL3 +/+ and CCL3 À/À mice is b1%. However, within 2 days following intracranial infection with MHV, there is a marked increase in the frequency of CD11c + cells within the brains of both strains of mice (Fig. 1A) . Analysis of CD11b expression revealed that approximately 75% of CD11c + cells in both CCL3 +/+ and CCL3 À/À mice were also CD11b + (Fig. 1A) . CD11c + CD11b + cells isolated from the CNS of either CCL3 +/+ or CCL3 À/À mice expressed little to no CD8a or DEC205 suggesting a phenotype similar to myeloid derived DC (CD11c + , CD11b + , CD8a À , DEC205 À ) ( Fig.  1B ) (Anjuere et al., 1999; Henri et al., 2001) . Increased CD8a and DEC205 expression on CD11c + CD11b À cells indicated that the majority of the remaining CD11c + cells present within the brain were similar phenotypically to lymphoid derived DC (CD11c + , CD11b À , CD8a + ) (Fig. 1B) (Anjuere et al., 1999; Henri et al., 2001) . Although the Fig. 1 . Analysis of dendritic cells (DCs) within the brain following MHV infection. (A) Cells were isolated from the brains of uninfected (naRve) or infected (day 2 p.i.) CCL3 +/+ and CCL3 À/À mice and stained for CD11c + and CD11b + expression. Gated populations represent CD11c + CD11b + (upper-right quadrant) or CD11c + CD11b À (lower-right quadrant) and numbers indicate frequencies of gated cells within the isolated population. (B) CD8a and DEC205 expression on CD11c + cells. CD11c + CD11b + cells from either MHV-infected CCL3 +/+ or CCL3 À/À mice at day 2 p.i. did not express detectable levels of either CD8a or DEC205 while expression of both CD8a and DEC205 was readily detectable on CD11c + CD11b À cells present within the brains of both populations of mice at day 2 p.i. (C) Total numbers of CD8a + and CD8a À DCs within the brains of MHV or sham-infected CCL3 +/+ and CCL3 À/À mice at days 2 and 5 p.i. Data presented represent an average cell number derived from two separate experiments with a minimum of 10 mice analyzed per experimental group. (D) CD8a À cells isolated from brains of CCL3 +/+ or CCL3 À/À mice at day 2 p.i. were gated upon and CD80, CD86, and CD40 expression was determined by flow cytometry. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for cells obtained from either CCL3 +/+ or CCL3 À/À mice is indicated. Flow data shown in panels A, B, and D are representative of two separate experiments with a total of 10 mice for each experimental condition. remaining CD11c + CD11b À CD8a À population was not further characterized, it is likely that these cells may be plasmacytoid in origin (CD11c + CD11b À CD8a À B220 + ) or consist of a yet to be defined population of DC. Comparison of the total numbers of CD8a + cells within the brains of MHV-infected CCL3 +/+ and CCL3 À/À mice revealed no dramatic differences between the two populations of mice at either 2 or 5 days p.i. (Fig. 1C) . In contrast, numbers of CD8a À cells were increased by approximately 30% within the brains of MHV-infected CCL3 +/+ mice as compared to CCL3 À/À mice at day 2 p.i. However, by day 5 p.i., there were increased numbers of CD8a À cells present in the brains of CCL3 À/À mice when compared to CCL3 +/+ mice. In attempt to better evaluate the activation state of CD11c + cells within the brains of MHV-infected mice, we next determined the expression levels of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 (B-7.1), CD86 (B-7.2), and CD40 on CD8a À cells within the CNS of CCL3 +/+ and CCL3 À/À mice. We chose to focus on this subpopulation of DCs in more detail as this clearly was the predominant DC population within the brains of infected mice suggesting a potentially more important role in defense. Analysis of CD8a À cells isolated from the brains of CCL3 +/+ mice at day 2 p.i. revealed these cells expressed detectable levels CD80, CD86, and CD40 as determined by measuring the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) (Fig. 1D ). Although MHV infection of CCL3 À/À mice also resulted in enhanced expression of CD86 on the surface of CD8a À cells, the MFI for both CD80 and CD40 was dramatically reduced as compared to CD8a À cells within the brain of CCL3 +/+ mice at day 2 p.i. (Fig. 1D ). Together, these results indicate that although CCL3 signaling is not required for the appearance of DC-like cells within the brain, expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD80 is muted in the absence of CCL3 signaling. Characterization of CD11c + cells within the CLN of MHV-infected CCL3 +/+ and CCL3 À/À mice Following MHV infection of the CNS, virus-specific T cells are present within the CLN suggesting that the bulk of virus-specific T cells are generated in the periphery (Marten et al., 2003) . Therefore, the accumulation of CD11c + cells within the CLN of infected CCL3 +/+ and CCL3 À/À mice was determined. Before infection, CD11c + cells expressing a myeloid DC phenotype (CD11c + CD11b + ) and lymphoid DC phenotype (CD11c + CD11b À ) were present within the CLN of both CCL3 +/+ and CCL3 À/À mice at an approximate 1:2 ratio, respectively ( Fig. 2A) . However, within 2 days of MHV infection of the CNS, the frequency of CD11c +-CD11b + DCs, but not CD11c + CD11b À DCs, dramatically increased within the CLN of CCL3 +/+ mice ( Fig. 2A) . Further analysis revealed that the CD11c + CD11b + cell population was CD8a À DEC205 À while the CD11c +-CD11b À population was CD8a + DEC205 + (Fig. 2B) . Although the total number of CD8a À cells increased within the CLN of CCL3 À/À mice, there was an approximate 4-fold reduction in total numbers of CD8a À cells as compared to CCL3 +/+ mice at days 2 and 5 p.i. (Fig. 2C ). Similar to the brain, no difference in numbers of CD8a + cells within the CLN was detected at either days 2 or 5 p.i. (Fig. 2C ). Examination of co-stimulatory molecule expression on CD8a À DCs present within the CLN of CCL3 +/+ mice correlated with the increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, CD86 as well as increased MHC I and II expression when compared to sham-infected mice (Figs. 2D and E) . These data suggest that this population of activated CD8a À cells within the CLN is able to present antigen and induce T cell differentiation within the CLN following MHV infection of the CNS. Although CD8a À DCs isolated from the CLN of CCL3 À/À mice expressed similar levels of CD80 and CD86 as compared to CCL3 +/+ (determined by MFI), expression of CD40 as well as MHC I and II were reduced as compared to CD8a À cells isolated from MHV-infected CCL3 +/+ mice (Figs. 2D and E).
