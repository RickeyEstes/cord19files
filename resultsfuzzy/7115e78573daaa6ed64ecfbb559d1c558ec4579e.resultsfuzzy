In the experimental group, 36 patients tested positive for respiratory virus, including 13 influenza A or B virus (7.7%), 9 RSV (5.3%), 9 human rhinovirus/enterovirus (5.3%), 2 coronavirus (1.2%), 2 parainfluenza virus type 3 (1.2%), and 1 human metapneumovirus (0.6%). In the control group, 20 patients (3.3%) were diagnosed with influenza, which was significantly lower than in the experimental group (P Â¼ .049) ( Table 2) . Of the 36 patients who tested positive for virus, 14 (38.9%) had a PCT level lower than 0.25 ng/mL. Coronavirus, influenza A, and human rhinovirus/enterovirus infections had higher serum levels of PCT (Figure 1 ).
