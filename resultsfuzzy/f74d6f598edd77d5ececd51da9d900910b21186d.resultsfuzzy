In the simulations, infection was introduced into an initially fully susceptible population through one latent infected individual. The simulations were carried out for closed populations with no birth or death or removal processes and for which disease progression was not influenced by treatment effects. The model was run for a simulated time period of 3 years, after which the infection either died out or, as indicated by preliminary results, converged to equilibrium prevalence in all simulated scenarios. Ten thousand replicates were generated for each parameter combination. The impact of host heterogeneity (in terms of both the source of variation and the underlying genetic architecture) was assessed by four different epidemic characteristics: first, we calculated the probability of the disease to exist in the population at different time points (calculated as the proportion of replicates with at least one infected individual Survival time for infectious bacteria in the environment 1, 1.5, or 12.0 days b N Population size 1000 a a Arbitrary values. The value for T S was chosen to yield footrot prevalences similar to those reported in field studies (e.g., Nieuwhof et al. 2008 ) for unit shedding rates k D and k C , respectively. For more information on the value for T C , see text. b Benchmark values adopted from Nieuwhof et al. (2009) .
