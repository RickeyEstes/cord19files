Performance evaluation based on different sequence encoding schemes In this section, we investigate the predictive performance of SVR models using different sequence encoding schemes and their combinations for cleavage site prediction of multiple proteases, by performing 5-fold cross-validation. The compared sequence encoding schemes include 'BINARY', 'PSSM', 'BLOSUM', 'KNN', 'CKSAAP' and 'AAIndex'. In addition, we also compared the performance of SVR models that were trained using all the initial features (referred to as 'ALL-Fea') and optimal selected features (termed 'mRMR-FS') after the two-step mRMR-FS feature selection. The ROC curves of these SVR models for cleavage site prediction of eight proteases [caspase-3, -6, -7, -8, MMP-2, -3, granzyme-B (human) and granzyme-B (mouse)] on the 5-fold cross-validation are shown in Figure 2 . Several important observations can be made. First, we can see that the 'ALL-Fea' model and 'mRMR-FS' model generally outperformed the other six models trained based on individual encoding schemes, with the AUC values ranging between 0.89 and 1.0. Second, the 'mRMR-FS' model achieved the overall best performance, after the two-step feature selection, compared with the other models for the MMP cleavage site prediction. For example, the 'mRMR-FS' model achieved an AUC of 0.968 for MMP-2 cleavage site prediction, while the second best 'ALL-Fea' model achieved an AUC of 0.892. Third, the accuracy of protease-specific cleavage site prediction varies substantially between different proteases and different protease families. The difficult cases include cleavage site prediction of the MMP family and other proteases (e.g. thrombin) whose activities are also regulated by confounding factors such as the presence of exosites (sites that are located outside the active sites) [120] [121] [122] . Compared with the caspases and granzyme B, the performance of cleavage site prediction with the MMP family achieved by a model using the same encoding scheme is much worse in terms of the AUC score. For example, the CKSAAP model only achieved an AUC of 0.502 and 0.581 for the cleavage site predictions of MMP-2 and MMP-3, respectively, compared with that of 0.914 and 0.922 for the cleavage site prediction of caspase-3 and caspase-7, respectively ( Figure 2 ). Future studies should investigate incorporation of other relevant features that might prove useful for improving the predictive performance of cleavage sites for proteases with a requirement for allosteric regulation to cleave their target substrates.
