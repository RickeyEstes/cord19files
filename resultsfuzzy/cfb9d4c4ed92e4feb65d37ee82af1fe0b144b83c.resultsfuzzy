The ACE2 model To begin to understand the interactions between the SARS-CoV S-glycoprotein and its recently identified receptor, ACE2, we attempted to develop an accurate model of the ACE2 3D structure. Currently, the only computational methodology that allows prediction of protein 3D structures with high accuracy (an rms error lower than 2 A) is comparative (homology) modeling. However, it requires sequence identity of the target protein with templates of known 3D structures higher than about 30% for accurate structure prediction. We found two proteins, tACE and AnCE, with available high resolution crystal structures, and ACE2 sequence identities of 43% and 35% (sequence similarities are 61% and 55%), respectively; the sequence alignment of ACE2 with tACE and AnCE2 is shown in Fig. 1 . Therefore, we have used homology modeling to build an accurate 3D model of ACE2 as described in Materials and methods. The architecture of the ACE2 model is very similar to the crystal structure of tACE ( Fig. 2A) . The superposition of the ACE2 model structure with the template structures of tACE and AnCE (Fig. 2B ) shows very small deviation (rmsd less than 0.5 A). A major feature of the ACE2 structure (and the template structures) is a deep channel on the top of the molecule that contains the catalytic site (Fig. 3A) . A comprehensive analysis of the structure and function of the catalytic site was very recently reported after our model was completed [19] ; here we will not discuss the enzymatic function of ACE2 but rather use the enzymatic site location for reference purposes. The channel is surrounded by ridges containing loops, helices, and a portion of a b-sheet. The long loop between N210 and Q221 that is missing in tACE and AnCE (Fig. 1) is on the ACE2 surface (Fig. 2B) ; note that the orientation of ACE2 in Fig. 2B is different than in Fig. 2A in order to show this loop. Potential N-glycosylation sites were identified at six positions: 53, 90, 103, 322, 432, and 546, but only two of them (53 and 90) were aligned with the tACE structure ( Fig. 1) . They shared the pattern NXTX (except 103) and were modeled with a N-acetylglucosamine moiety (Fig. 3B) . The direction of the main chain is illustrated in Fig. 3C . ACE2 surface potential, solvent accessibility, hydrophobicity analysis, and carbohydrate distribution Interactions of viral attachment proteins with protein receptor molecules are mostly determined by complementarity in surface charge distribution, hydrophobic interactions, and geometry; typically carbohydrates are excluded from the binding sites [9] . In an attempt to provide working hypothesis for possible regions involved in the interaction of the S-glycoprotein with its receptor we analyzed the ACE2 surface potential, solvent accessibility, hydrophobicity, and carbohydrate distribution. The surface of the deep channel at the top of ACE2 and the surrounding ridges is highly negatively charged (Fig. 3A) . These ridges contain residues D136, E150, N154, D157, D292, D295, and D299 some of which have large ASA values, e.g., D136, N154, and D157 have 109, 108, and 80 A 2 , respectively (Fig. 4) . Comparison of these residues with the corresponding residues from ACE that do not support fusion mediated by the S-glycoprotein [2] , and mouse ACE2 that binds to S but with somewhat lower affinity than human ACE2 (M. Farzan, personal communication) (Fig. 5 ) supports the possibility that some of these residues contribute to specific binding. The hydrophobicity analysis revealed distinct hydrophobic patches in close proximity to the negatively charged ridges (Fig. 3D) . There are at least three hydrophobic regions comprising different residues including Phe, Trp, and Tyr which could contribute to binding in addition to the charged binding surface. All carbohydrate sites are topologically apart from the electronegative surface at the top of the molecule (Fig. 3B) .
