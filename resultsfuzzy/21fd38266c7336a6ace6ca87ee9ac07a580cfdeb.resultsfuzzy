Clustering of 16S rRNA sequence data Clustering of 16S rRNA sequence data from each flock using CCA as described in the methods revealed the bacterial communities associated with the MSPF flock to be distinct from each of the experimental flocks (Fig. 1A) . This result likely reflects the higher biosecurity conditions under which the MSPF flock was maintained compared to the commercial or back yard settings in which the sentinel birds were placed. Comparisons of the taxonomic composition of the communities showed the MSPF flock had a relatively high proportion of sequences classified by the RDP as Lachnospiracae incertae sedis and Clostridium XIVa (Fig. 1B) . Both of these groups are members of the Clostridiales which are known to be the dominant taxonomic group in the ceca but are still somewhat poorly resolved taxonomically; the majority (>70%) of sequences classified as Lachnospiracae incertae sedis belonged to the genera Blautia or Ruminoccus according to the Silva taxonomy, while most (2/3) of the Clostridium XIVa sequences were classified simply in the genus Clostridium by comparison to the Silva database (v115). The similarities of the VG, DM, and CAB flocks (Fig. 1A) reflect their similar taxonomic profiles, particularly for the relative proportions of Lactobacillus and Syntrophococcus (Fig. 1B) . Similarly, the communities of the NG and GT flocks were quite similar to one another (Fig. 1A) , reflecting the relatively high proportion of Lactobacillus sequences (Fig. 1B) . Compared to the MSPF pre-contact birds, each of the sentinel bird groups had genera specifically under-or overrepresented in their intestines ( Table 1 ). The GT, BY, and NG flocks each had significant overrepresentation by the Blautia genus compared to the pre-contact MSPF birds, while the CAB flock was the only flock with significantly more Lactobacillus spp. reads. The back yard (BY) flock was over-represented by members of the Coprobacillus genus, a group of bacteria that have only recently been detected and initially described in poultry [45] . The VG flock was the only flock with significant over-representation by members of the Clostridium XIVb cluster, and members of the Robinsoniella and Lactonifactor genera were under-represented in only the CAB and DM flocks, respectively. How these taxonomic differences affect bird health and nutrition remains unknown, but if the differences in community composition between the MSPF and experimental flocks do reflect differences in biosecurity measures, this result may have important implications for husbandry and management practices.
