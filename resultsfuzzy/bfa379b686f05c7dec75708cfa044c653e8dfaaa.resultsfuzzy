The Day 3 Workshop evaluation results affirmed the interest in and tremendous success of this initiative. Based on an 85% response rate, 97% of participants "strongly agreed" or "agreed" that the workshop and the overall planning were worthwhile and useful. A compendium of pandemic plans for 25-plus groups exists as part of the CDHA/IWK Pandemic Influenza Contingency Plan. An executive summary is being developed, which will include the clinical surge capacity results and templates for beds, services prioritization and human resource needs by staff type. Another noteworthy output was the development of proposed patient flow and medical treatment for the CDHA/IWK population during a pandemic. Challenges and lessons learned • Structures and Potential Silos -1st major joint planning exercise between IWK and CDHA, -IWK and CDHA have responsibility for Public Health, Primary Care and Acute Care, -Long-Term Care and Home Care are not within our mandates. • Direction and Resources -Federal plan provided very broad guidelines and provincial plan was under development, -Staff had competing priorities and this work required significant time commitment, -Dedicated project manager was essential. • Scope and Complexity -Earlier smaller-scale planning attempts left people cautious to commit, -Iterative nature ultimately resulted in more than 25 working groups, -Planning the services was the easier task, while broader ethical concerns are more challenging, -Decision-making in an extended disaster requires different structures and processes for command and control. Our military colleagues and the municipal Emergency Measures Organization staff provided invaluable expertise, -As pandemic planning evolved, our focus shifted from individual patients to communities, from a short-term to a multi-phased, long-term outbreak, from a traditional disaster planning approach to an all-hazards plan and broader business continuity planning. 12
