The isolates belonged to 251 adults (70%) and 109 children. Origins were: respiratory tract (48%), blood (24%), ear (12%), conjunctiva (7%), CSF (4%), other sterile fluids (3%) and miscellaneous (2%). Penicillin resistance (I+R) was 42%, and erythromycin resistance was 36%. A total of 34 isolates were non-typeable and were excluded for further analysis. The most frequent serotypes (St) were 3, 19F, and 19A. St 14, 19F, and 23F were the most frequent among the penicillin-resistant strains, and St 3 among susceptible strains. The most frequent St of the 96 invasive isolates (blood and CSF) were 14 and 19F, in children and in adults, respectively. Among the 96 invasive isolates, 84% corresponded to St included in the 23-valent (23-V) vaccine, and 46% to St included in the 7-valent (7-V) vaccine. The most frequent non-vaccine St were 6A, 16, 31, 34, 35B, and 35F. A total of 106 (45%)of Sp isolated from adults belonged to St frequently isolated from children (6, 14, 18, 19, and 23) . Considering Sp isolated from all origins, the estimated coverage of the 7-V vaccine was 40% in children and 38% in adults; and the estimated coverage of the 23-V vaccine was 77% in adults. Considering only invasive isolates, the estimated coverage of the 7-V vaccine was 61% in children and 41% in adults; and the estimated coverage of the 23-V vaccine was 79% in adults. Conclusions: These results confirm the high rates of resistance of Sp to penicillin and erythromycin, the spread to adults of St frequently isolated from children, the evidence for the emergence of non-vaccine types causing invasive pneumococcal disease, and the moderate coverage of the 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine. Objectives: To determine the incidence of invasive pneumococcal infections (IPI) in patient groups recommended to receive pneumococcal polysaccaride vaccine (PPV23) as well as outcome of the illness. Methods: All laboratories performing blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures submitted data on isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from blood or CSF during 1995-2002. Information on vital status, comorbidities and denominator data on persons at risk were obtained from the Population Information System, National Hospital Discharge Registry, Cancer Registry, National Social Insurance Institution, and National Infectious Disease Registry. The patient's national identity code was used for linking databases. Only the first episode of IPI was included in the analysis. Results: A total of 4357 episodes of IPI were identified (incidence 10.6 cases per 100,000 population). Highest incidence of IPI was seen in patients with haematological malignancy (547 per 100,000 population), organ or bone marrow transplantation (164), males aged ‡55 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (143) and persons with HIV (130). The overall casefatality proportions (CFPs) at 7, 28 and 90 days after the positive culture were 9%, 12% and 16%, respectively. At 28 days the CFPs ranged from 1% to 25% in different age groups. In patients aged ‡50 they were significantly higher in men than in women (20% vs 15%; p < 0.01). Patients with non-hematological malignancy and alcoholism had the highest CFPs at 28 days, 31% and 27%, respectively. In patients with hematological malignancy the 28-day CFP was 16% and 6% among healthy adults aged 18-64 years. In adults aged 18-64 years, 931 (42%) of 2216 cases had an underlying condition for which PPV23 is recommended. The effects on resistance rates of excluding duplicate isolates (DI) were small despite the fact that almost one third of the isolates were excluded through the 365 days exclusion algorithm. Except for fluoroquinolones, resistance rates in E. coli decreased when DI were excluded on the basis of 30 days but increased when DI were excluded on the basis of 365 days. Resistance in S. aureus tended to decrease when duplicates were excluded independent of cut-off time. Conclusion: E. coli and S. aureus are two of our most important pathogens and as such common in resistance surveillance. Although the effects on resistance rates of exclusion of duplicate isolates were minor and not statistically significant in the present study we suggest that the exclusion cut-offs should match the timeline, i.e. if rates are presented as yearly figures, the exclusion cut-off should be 365 days, and so on. We furthermore believe that the effect of excluding duplicates should be presented in conjunction with presentation of surveillance data. Our data suggests that E. coli re-infection (infection with the same species more than 30 days after the first incident) is mainly caused by new and less resistant strains whereas patients who have acquired resistant strains of S. aureus continue to be colonized with the same strain.
