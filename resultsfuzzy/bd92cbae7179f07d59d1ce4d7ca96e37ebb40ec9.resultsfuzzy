Development of wide-spectrum inhibitors is an attractive strategy against CoV-associated diseases; however, it entirely depends on the availability of a conserved target within the whole genus Coronavirus. During the first round of target screening, all structural proteins (including S, E, M, HE, and N proteins) were excluded due to the considerable variations among different CoVs [1] [2] [3] 33, 34] . Subsequently, the RNAdependent RNA polymerase, RNA helicase, and M pro constitute attractive potential nonstructural protein targets for consideration. However, no structural data were available for the former two proteins, increasing the difficulties for rational drug design and downstream modification of possible drug leads. The pivotal roles played by M pro s in controlling viral replication and transcription through extensive processing of replicase polyproteins, together with the absence of closely related cellular homologues, identify the M pro as a potentially important target for antiviral drug design [35] . However, pairwise BLAST of the primary sequences among CoV M pro s showed identities of only 38% in some cases. Since it is acknowledged that three-dimensional structures are more closely conserved than primary sequences, we decided to investigate the conservation among the CoV M pro structures. As the M pro s showed comparatively high sequence similarity within each CoV group, representatives from every group were chosen for comparison. The structures of M pro s from TGEV (group I), HCoV-229E (group I), and SARS-CoV are available [36] [37] [38] . Although the crystal structure of IBV (group III) M pro is currently under refinement by our group, it can nevertheless be used as an experiment-based model. As the structure of MHV M pro (group II) was unavailable, and previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV is related to group II [10] , we constructed a homology model for MHV M pro based on the structure of SARS-CoV M pro . Superposition of the crystal structures and homology model showed approximately 2 Ã… root mean square deviation for all 300 C a , but the most variable regions were the helical domain III and surface loops. The substrate-binding pockets located in a cleft between domains I and II, and especially the S4, S2, and S1 are highly conserved among CoV M pro s suggesting the possibility for wide-spectrum inhibitor design targeting this region in the M pro s of all CoVs. This hypothesis was further supported by enzyme activity assays (see Table 1 ). Based on the assumption that the substrate-binding sites are highly conserved among CoV M pro s, a fluorescence-labeled substrate MCA-AVLQflSGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2 was synthesized to determine the kinetic parameters of TGEV, HCoV-229E, FIPV, MHV, IBV, and SARS-CoV M pro s. The substrate sequence was derived from residues P4-P59 of the SARS-CoV M pro N-terminal autoprocessing site, which has the sequence AVLQSGFRK. IBV M pro demonstrated an almost identical K m to that of SARS-CoV M pro . An interesting observation was that four other CoV proteases showed marginally stronger binding affinity to the substrate than SARS-CoV M pro itself. These results further support the preliminary biochemical studies on conservation of substrates of CoV M pro s [39] .
