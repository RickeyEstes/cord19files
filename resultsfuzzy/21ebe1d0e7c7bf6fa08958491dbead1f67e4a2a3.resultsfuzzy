The complexes Ia, Ib and Ic have an absorption maximum (k max ) at 560 nm, 557 nm and 584 nm respectively in 100% acetonitrile medium. Additions of ligand oxide/PSAA to the complex shift the k max appreciably to higher wavelength along with an immediate color change to emerald green. The shift in the k max is in the range of 13 nm-78 nm and the observed k max values in the presence and absence of additives are recorded in Table 1 . The shift in the k max value on adding ligand oxide/PSAA to the oxo(salen) complex indicates binding of LO/ PSAA with oxo(salen)chromium(V) + to form adduct.
