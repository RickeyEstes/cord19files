First, in order to better understand the genomic characteristics of the four types of viruses known to infect humans, dsDNA (n = 94), dsRNA (n = 15), ssRNA (n = 354), and ssDNA (n = 84), and understand how these characteristics can impact the evolutionary dynamics of these viruses (Methods; Figure S1 ), we examined the distribution of four of their genomic features. While dsDNA viruses had the largest and the most variable genome lengths, ssDNA were the smallest genomes by at least an order of magnitude, with both dsRNA and ssRNA exhibiting intermediate sizes (Figure 1a) . Because of the compact structure of these genomes, these differences were also reflected in the number of genes, protein-coding genes, and RNAs encoded by the genomes of these viruses ( Figure S2 ). In turn, these characteristics suggest that, with their large genomes, dsDNA viruses potentially have a higher degree of functional redundancy than ssDNA or even ssRNA viruses, possibly due to duplication events [40] , and thereby be under less stringent selective pressures than viruses with smaller genomes. On the other hand, the extent of correlated evolution and its interaction with selection is more difficult to predict. To address these questions, we first tested for the presence of episodic diversifying selection in each viral type. Altogether, we found extensive differences among all four viral types in terms of the number of genes under selection (Figure 1b ; X 2 = 99.61, d f = 3, p < 2.2 × 10 −16 ), and that single stranded viruses were more subject to selection than double stranded viruses (X 2 = 95.14, d f = 1, p < 2.2 × 10 −16 ). Indeed, and contra our original hypothesis, there were no differences between dsDNA and dsRNA viruses (X 2 = 0.26, d f = 1, p = 0.6110), or between ssDNA and ssRNA viruses in terms of prevalence of diversifying selection (X 2 = 2.07, d f = 1, p = 0.1503). Note that these differences cannot be attributed to genetic diversity, as dsDNA and dsRNA, which have similar levels of selection, have however different levels of diversity ( Figure S3 ). However, it is unlikely that "strandedness" (single vs. double stranded genetic material) alone drives selection, even if greater instability can be postulated in single-stranded nucleic acids [41] . Indeed, strandedness is negatively correlated with genome size (t = −4.98, d f = 108.35, p = 2.43 × 10 −6 ), which is itself correlated with mutation rates [42, 43] . As a result, episodic diversifying selection is mostly driven by structural aspects of viral genomes, which condition mutation rates across all virus types [44] . To understand if similar aspects drive intragenic correlated evolution, we counted in the same way the number of genes for which we could find evidence for interactions. Here, again, we found extensive differences among all four viral types (Figure 1c ; X 2 = 29.79, d f = 3, p < 1.5 × 10 −16 ), with no difference between dsDNA and ssDNA viruses (X 2 = 0.0005, d f = 1, p = 0.9827), or between dsRNA and ssRNA viruses (X 2 = 0.0001, d f = 3, p = 0.9903). Again, diversity is not driving these differences, as both dsDNA/ssDNA and dsRNA/ssRNA have significantly different levels of diversity ( Figure S3 ). As a result, the prevalence of correlated evolution seems to be mostly driven by the nature of viral genetic material. At least two processes can underpin correlated evolution: linkage and epistasis [12] . As recombination is pervasive in some dsDNA viruses [45] , linkage alone may not explain the high prevalence of correlated evolution in DNA viruses (close to 40%: Figure 1c ). Rather, this pattern suggests that intragenic constraints are higher in DNA viruses for unknown structural reasons, maybe due to protein structure [46] , or in the same way that recombination in RNA viruses may be driven by mechanistic constraints associated with genome structures and viral life cycles [47] . While previous work showed that both diversifying selection and correlated evolution can affect the same gene and even the same site in a viral genome such as Ebola's [17] , an ssRNA virus, the generality of this association is still unknown. At the gene level, we found strong heterogeneity among all four viral types for gene numbers showing evidence for selection, correlated evolution or both (X 2 = 206.54, d f = 6, p < 2.2 × 10 −16 ). Surprisingly, ssRNA viruses are those that show the least overlap between selection and correlated evolution, with only 11% of the genes evolving under both mechanisms (Figure 1d ). Patterns are, however, much more difficult to extract here, mostly because the number of genes involved becomes quite small, in particular for the virus type with most overlap, the dsRNA viruses (Figure 1d: 29 .4%, i.e., five genes).
