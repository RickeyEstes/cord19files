Case Study One: Twenty Years of One Health -The Coordinating Office for the Control of Trypanosomiasis in Uganda (COCTU) Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), or ''Sleeping Sickness'', is a Neglected Tropical Disease of significant public health importance across much of Africa, with Nagana the corresponding disease in livestock. Transmitted by the Glossina species of tsetse fly, trypanosomiasis manifests in humans as either an acute or chronic form caused by T. br. rhodesiense and T. br. gambiense respectively. Presently the only country with foci of both forms of this fatal human disease, Uganda has suffered from devastating epidemics and outbreaks since the beginning of the 20 th Century. To date the two forms have been confined to separate geographical foci in Uganda, facilitating surveillance and treatment. More recently however, country-wide movements of infected cattle -an essential reservoir of the T. b. rhodesiense parasites responsible for acute human disease in Uganda -have fuelled fears of disease convergence [10] , [11] . The intersectoral approach required for HAT control ''lies at the heart of African rural development'' [12] , providing a relevant case study through which to examine One Health. One health ''by accident''. Formed by a parliamentary Act (Statute 16) on the 8 th of October 1992, the Co-ordinating Office for the Control of Trypanosomiasis in Uganda (COCTU) is the secretariat of a permanently funded interministerial platform, mandated to co-ordinate policy and oversee all Human and African Trypanosomiasis control in the country [13] . Seated within Uganda's Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industries and Fisheries (MAAIF) and endorsed by the Office of the Prime Minister for the better part of two decades, COCTU is a unique example of Uganda's commitment to One Health long before the approach became ''fashionable''.
