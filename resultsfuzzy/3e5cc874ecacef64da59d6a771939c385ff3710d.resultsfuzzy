Six types of windows (Fig. 2) were assessed for pollutant crosstransmission through single-sided natural ventilation in a multistory building (Fig. 1) . The effects of the ambient wind and pollutant source location on cross-transmission and the assessment of infection risks are discussed. The Archimedes number Ar, which represents the ratio of the buoyancy force to the inertial force of the ambient wind, is used to identify the dominant driving force of the natural ventilation. The wind speed is estimated to be approximately 1.6 m/s when the buoyancy force is comparable to the wind force. When the wind speed is higher than 1.6 m/s, the wind becomes dominant. Otherwise, buoyancy is the dominant force. Notably, the dominant force driving airflow through windows into buildings also varied with window configurations and spatial positions. Therefore, identifying the dominant force using the Ar criteria can only provide a preliminary estimation.
