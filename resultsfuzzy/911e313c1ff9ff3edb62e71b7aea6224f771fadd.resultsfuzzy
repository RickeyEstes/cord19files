Induction of the EBV lytic cascade. The NPC HK1 cell line is derived from a squamous carcinoma of the nasopharynx (40) . The primary biopsy specimen was too small for EBV DNA analysis, but the outgrowing HK1 cell line did not show evidence of EBV infection as determined by staining for EBNA1 or by imaging of virus particles (40) . The HK1-EBV cell line was established by in vitro infection of a recombinant EBV originating from the EBV Akata strain (38) . In proliferating monolayer cultures, the EBV-infected HK1 cell line does not show induction of the lytic cascade and expresses a type II latency profile characterized by the expression of EBNA1, EBER1/2, LMP1, LMP2A, LMP2B, and BART transcripts (38) . In this cell line, expression of lytic genes can be induced by the HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) but is primarily abortive and does not yield progeny virus (16) . Epithelial differentiation is a physiological trigger for EBV reactivation and can be induced by culturing cells at the air-liquid interface (32) . Therefore, the HK1-EBV cell line was tested using the ALI epithelial cell polarization method for EBV reactivation and the timeline presented in Fig. 1B . Upon removal of apical media, harvest time points begin 1 day after lifting to the air-liquid interface (denoted week 0) and at weekly intervals for a total of 3 weeks. One additional hTERT-immortalized nasopharyngeal cell line (NP460hTERT-EBV) and A. An ALI Method To Study EBV Pathogenesis one natively infected NPC cell line (C666-1) were also evaluated (37) (38) (39) , but only the HK1-EBV cell line could be maintained under ALI growth conditions and could preserve an intact epithelium under polarized conditions (data not shown).
