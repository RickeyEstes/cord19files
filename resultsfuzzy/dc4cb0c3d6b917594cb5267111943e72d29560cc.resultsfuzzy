As commented in Section 1, direct electrochemical labeling, this made with electroactive molecules will simplify enormously the procedures of bioassays. However, highly detectable molecules as well as sensitive principles of detection are needed for replacing the amplification power of enzymes. Methylene blue is a molecule that presents a well-defined two-electron redox process [56] with cathodic (conversion to leucomethylene blue (LB)) and anodic (reoxidation to MB) peaks. The electrochemical behavior of this molecule converts it into a suitable candidate for covalent electrochemical biolabel. Since a covalent attachment does not produce a high label density (one or two MB molecules per DNA strand), the transducer has to favored electron transfer. In a previous work, it has been demonstrated that nanostructuration with MWCNTs-NH 2 produces the adsorption of MB on the surface allowing a very substantial increase in the analytical signal by employing an accumulation time [50] . In Fig. 1A a cyclic voltammogram of MB on bare and nanostructured screen-printed electrodes is presented. After the nanostructuration, the increase in the reversibility of the electrochemical process allows the employ of sensitivity-enhancing electrochemical techniques such as SWV or DPV, producing a seven-time higher sensitivity. In this case, the next step is the study of the electrochemical behavior of MB covalently attached to a single-stranded DNA and comparison with that of the MB molecule. With this aim, several single MB-conjugated DNA strands have been evaluated. Examples of the cyclic, differential pulse and square wave voltammograms obtained are presented in Fig. 1B-D to show the effect that CNTs have on the recorded analytical signals. Although ACV was employed in the bibliography [26] , in this case CV, DPV and SWV since they are less complex and more commonly found in commercial potentiostats. DPV was also used for recording the signal of MB covalently labeled to DNA in non-nanostructured conventional gold electrodes [27, 28] . Moreover, SWV is a fast electrochemical technique, which is very important when several assays are going to be performed.
