Details of the mouse exposures, particle characterization and pulmonary phenotype were previously published in Bourdon et al. (2012a,b) . Briefly, female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to a single installation of vehicle or Printex 90 (18, 54 or 162 g) and euthanized 1, 3 and 28 days post-exposure (n = 6/group). The intratracheal instillation route of exposure allows for deposition of known doses directly in the lungs of the mice, and controls for potential dermal-and ingestion-related CBNP exposure that can occur during whole body inhalation exposures. The doses were selected to represent 1, 3 and 9 working days of exposure at the occupational inhalation exposure limit of 3.5 mg/m 3 of CB (as established by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH))) for a mouse (assuming 1.8 L/h inhalation rate and 33.8% particle deposition in mouse, for an 8 h working day) (Dybing et al., 1997; Jacobsen et al., 2009) . Very limited filtration of CBNPs from the nose is expected during human exposure. Printex 90 CBNPs were characterized and displayed the following properties: 14 nm primary particle size, 295-338 m 2 /g Brunauer Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area, 74.2 g/g PAHs, 142 EU/g endotoxin, polydispersity index of 1, −10.7 mV zeta potential, 2.6 m peak hydrodynamic number and 3.1 m peak volume-size-distribution (Bourdon et al., 2012b) . Analysis of pulmonary inflammatory cellular influx in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed neutrophilic inflammation that was sustained to day 28 at all doses. Tissue-specific genotoxicity, as observed by DNA strand breaks, persisted up to day 28 at the two highest doses and FPG-sensitive sites at all doses on day 1 and the highest dose on day 3 (Bourdon et al., 2012b) . Whole mouse genome DNA microarray revealed 487 and 81 differentially expressed genes (FDR adjusted pvalue ≤ 0.1 and fold changes ≥ 1.5) overall in lung and liver, respectively (Bourdon et al., 2012a) . The complete microarray dataset is available through the Gene Expression Omnibus at NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/, Superseries GSE35284, SubSeries GSE35193). This dataset was previously used to examine molecular interactions between lung and liver upon CBNP exposure (Bourdon et al., 2012a) .
