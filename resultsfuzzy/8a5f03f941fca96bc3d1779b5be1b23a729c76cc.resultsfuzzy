The data shown in the graphs are numerical, with dots representing individual animals and lines representing the mean ± S.E.M. of results obtained from each group. In order to correct for the natural heterogeneity in body weights in the studied groups, this variable is expressed as relative (percentual) body weight gain relative to that observed at the beginning of the experiment. Lymphoproliferative response is expressed as stimulation index: the ratio between the mean CPM obtained from cells incubated with the mitogen and from non-stimulated cells. The significance of the differences observed among the groups was tested using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). When the F-test was found significant, the difference between two groups was identified using the Student-Newman Kleus' test. Trends were measured using Person's correlation coefficient (r), followed by comparison of slope and intercept of two lines when appropriate. For some cross-table comparisons, Fisher's exact probability test was used. The critical level of significance admitted was α = 0.05 (Glantz, 1996) .
