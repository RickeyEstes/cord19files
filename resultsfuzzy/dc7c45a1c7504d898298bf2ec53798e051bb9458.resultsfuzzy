Tables 5-10 present the main panel regression test results based on Models 1, 2 and 3. Along with these results, each table additionally shows results of the panel regression analysis with only main factors (i.e., IMS and IMS 2 , DIRS and DIRS 2 , and MAS and MAS 2 ) excluding the two control variables. Test results in Tables 5 and 6, in general, suggest a quadratic relationship between insider managerial shareholdings (IMS) and corporate performance when measured with ROA, ROE and SIZE does not explain stock return (SR) throughout the three models. SALES consistently shows a significant explanatory power on accounting performance measures (ROA and ROE), but does not explain stock-related performance measures (SR and Tobin's Q) among the three models.
