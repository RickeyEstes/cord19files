High level of variability in BKV as detected by NGS Access to the virus in the bloodstream and/or urine within a transplant setting, where HLA alleles of both donors and recipients are known, provides a unique opportunity to study viral evolution in vivo in the context of the individual's (both recipient and donor) HLA class I genotype. A retrospective cohort of 96 patients-225 samples-that underwent solid organ (N = 83) or hematopoietic cell transplantations (N = 13), harboring a minimum of 10 4 viral copies/mL in whole blood or urine, was selected. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that the viral titers in blood (8.98 × 10 4 ± 2.47 × 10 4 copies/mL) were significantly lower than those in urine (2.16 ×10 9 ± 3.94 × 10 8 copies/mL) (Mann-Whitney U = 315.0, two-tailed, P < 0.0001). After complete deep genome sequencing of all 225 samples and alignment to the BKV Dunlop reference strain (GenBank accession number NC001538), an average of 110 ± 3 polymorphisms per sample was observed with an average median coverage of 3043 ± 78 reads/position (S1 Table, Gen-Bank accession numbers KT896230-KT896454; see Methods). In total, 37.88% of all amino acid positions in the Agnoprotein, 12.43% in VP1, 9.97% in VP2, 11.21% in VP3, 8.20% in LTA and 8.72% in stA, were found to be polymorphic (S2 Table) . Agnogene is the only gene that is not under apparent selective constraints (Nei-Gojobori test, P = 0.8663), while the others are under purifying selection (Nei-Gojobori test, P < 0.0001, Fig 1, see Methods) . Only a few single nucleotide insertions or deletions were detected in the viral genes (S3 Table) . Due to methodological limitations (short reads) the non-coding control region was not included in the analyses. The occurrence of mutations is the main process generating genetic variability, but other processes, such as genetic drift, gene flow, selection and recombination, are responsible for shaping the genetic structure and variation of viral populations. Here, we present evidence that BKV is under strong purifying selection even in the immunocompromised host. Several specific features of the Polyomaviridae (e.g., limited size of the genome, small number of genes and overlapping transcription units) likely account for this outcome. In addition, the prevalence of purifying selection in essential genes is anticipated in all viruses as there is a requirement to complete the viral cycle, even in immunocompromised hosts. Most mutations in coding regions must be deleterious, and a high substitution rate implies the accumulation of mutations with deleterious effects [18] . This phenomenon is well known in RNA viruses, which have high mutation rates and short replication times. Similar results have been shown comparing mutational fitness effects and evolution in ssRNA and ssDNA viruses [19, 20] . Our study supports the hypothesis, in concordance with other recent findings [21] , that the evolutionary rate gap between small dsDNA and RNA viruses might not be as wide as previously thought. A recent study in lentiviruses has revealed that the combined effects of sequence saturation and purifying selection can explain the time-dependent pattern of rate variation. Purifying selection acts on the genetic diversity over long timeframes by removing a large number of transient deleterious mutations that are still present within short timeframes [4] . Phylogenetic analysis with all BKV complete genomes available from GenBank (Fig 2A) suggested the existence of three large groups or genotypes represented by serotypes I, II/III, and IV, with subtypes within genotypes. Limited differences (short branch lengths) between the previously designated genotypes II and III suggested the existence of only one genotype II/III with two subtypes (in contrast to more pronounced differences between serotypes II and III). A similar phylogenetic classification was observed by analyzing only the VP1 gene ( Fig 2B) . Incidentally, this finding indicated that the current BKV classification should be revised due to inconsistencies between serotyping and genotyping. Next, to establish the genotype of our samples, one reference strain of each genotype and subtype was used for the phylogenetic analysis ( Fig 2C) . Most of our samples (80.88%) belonged to genotype I, whereas genotypes IV and II/III were less represented (13.78% and 5.3% respectively). The clustering was patient-dependent but independent of the sample origin (urine or blood) and suggested that some samples likely contained a mixture of genotypes. This mixture might be due to multiple lifelong infections or the replication of viruses from the recipient and/or the donor.
