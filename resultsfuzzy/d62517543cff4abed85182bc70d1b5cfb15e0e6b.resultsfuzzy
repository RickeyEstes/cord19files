One of the conclusions Burnet et nl. (1937) arrived a t in their studies of several bacterial and animal viruses was that the two groups differed fundamentally in their interaction with antibody. Whereas bacterial viruses formed irreversible complexes with neutralizing antibody, animal viruses (those examined by Burnet et al.) formed freely reversible complexes (Burnet, 1960) . The assay inethods employed were at least formally comparable, namely, the plaque method for bacteriophages and the then newly developed pock-counting method utilizing the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated chick eggs for animal viruses. Subsequent studies (Dulbecco et aZ., 1956) of two animal viruses, poliovirus and WEE virus, employing the plaque assay method with animal cell cultures, indicated that the reaction of these viruses with antibody was irreversible. Reversibility, in the present context, represents a dynamic equilibrium between reactants and product with the final equilibrium depending upon association and dissociation rates, which in turn are concentration-dependent. The demonstration of reversibility requires that the sole variation in the reaction conditions be a change in the concentration of the reaction components, usually by dilution. Such a change should then drive the reaction toward dissociation until reestablishment of the equilibrium characteristic for the particular system. This aspect of viral neutralization has been under examination from the time that neutralization was first subjected to experimental scrutiny. Interpretation of early studies indicated that reversibility was characteristic of the neutralization of fowl plague virus (Todd, 1928) , vaccinia virus (Andrewes, 1928; Olitsky, 1930\, EEE virus (Pierce et al., 1941) , papilloma virus (Bryan and Beard, 1941)' influenza virus (Taylor, 1941; Burnet, 1936 Burnet, , 1943 , and poliovirus (Gebhardt and Bullock, 1931) . However, the reaction was considered irreversible for papilloma virus (Friedewald and Kidd, 1940) and EEE virus (Labzoffsky, 1946) , and partially reversible for influenza virus (Taylor, 1941 ; Burnet, 1943 ). It has also been reported that the extent of dilution dissociation decreased with prolonged incubation (Andrewes, 1930; Burnet, 1943) . This aspect of viral neutralization was examined by Gard (1955) using a particularly appropriate system, namely, a strain of Theiler's virus (FA strain of mouse poliomyelitis) which could be assayed in mice with or without dilution based on the incubation period. He observed that, whereas the undiluted virus-serum mixture indicated neutralization, the diluted mixture did not. However, after 24 hours a t 37°C or 10 days a t 4"C, dilution of the reaction mixture showed the expected decrease for a nondissociating complex. Gard proposed that the interaction between virus and antibody entailed two stages-a rapid but weakly cohesive union followed by enhancement of the forces binding virus and antibody. It may be relevant that the source of antibody in this study was serum from normal mice. It was shown by Olitsky (1940) that normal mice almost universally carry the TO strain of Theiler's virus. Antibody in the sera of these mice is TO-specific. The extent of cross-reactivity between the two strains may be a contributing factor to this phenomenon which Gard called "immunoinactivation." However, in subsequent studies with human poliovirus and homologous antibody, Gard (1957) observed the same immunoinactivation characteristics. Using the plaque assay for animal viruses employing animal cell cultures, Dulbecco et a2. (1956) analyzed the reaction of WEE virus and poliovirus with antibody. With respect to dilution dissociation, they reported that the phenomenon did not occur with these viruses. Studies of the reversibility of these and other viruses employing cell cultures as the test system indicated no spontaneous dissociation for NDV (Rubin, 1957; Rubin and Franklin, 1957; Granoff, 1965) , poliovirus (Mandel, 1958 (Mandel, , 1961 Ketler et al., 1961 ; Keller, 1965 ; Wallis et al., 1973 ), adenovirus (Kjellh, 1957 ), visna virus (Thormar, 19631, herpesvirus (Yoshino and Taniguchi, 1965b Ashe and Notkins, 1967) , or VEE virus (Hahon, 1969) . The possibility that dissociation occurs but to a minor degree was considered for JEV (Hashimoto and Prince, 1963; Iwasaki and Ogura, 1968b) and was proposed for herpesvirus (Ide and Yoshino, 1974) and W N virus (Westaway, 1965a) . The data from which Dulbecco et al. (1956) concluded that the reactions were irreversible were reinterpreted by Fazekas de St. Groth and Reid (1958) to show that the results were consistent with a reaction which is freely reversible and subject to mass-action phenomena. Reaffirmation of the view that a freely reversible equilibrium characterizes virus-antibody interaction resulted from studies on neutralization of influenza virus (Fazekas de St. Groth and Webster, 1963) . The complexity of the neutralization phenomenon has been stressed by Burnet (1960, p. 298) , Dulbecco et al. (19561, Fazekas de St. Groth and Reid (1958) , and Fazekas de St. Groth (1962) . It, is clear that neutralization consists of three domains-virus, antibody , and assay h o s t a n d each domain can be divided into subdomains of varying characteristics. To illustrate, Svehag (1965) compared the dissociability of poliovirus-rabbit antibody complexes when antibody was either early 19 or late 75. In neither case was dissociation evident with simple dilution. When dilution was carried out in conjunction with increasing ionic strength, minor but significant dissociation occurred when virus was complexed to 19s antibody. With 75 antibody no dissociation occurred when salt molarity was increased from 0.14 M to 5.0 M . The bond strength of the complex is a function of antibody type. The results of Svehag (1965) indicate that with late antibody the affinity constant is exceedingly high. In studies with poliovirus (Mandel, 1961) it was shown that, when centrifuged neutralized virus was suspended in antibody-free medium, no evidence for reversibility was obtained over a period of 50 days a t 5°C. Both diluted and undiluted resuspended virus was monitored. Neutralized virus was prepared using varying antiserum multiplicities that resulted in surviving fractions as high as 10%. Potentially dissociable virusantibody coinplexes were demonstrated by acid reactivation of infectivity. An analysis of dissociability on a molecular level was described by Lafferty (1963a,bl . The reaction of influenza virus with antibody was biphasic with respect to time. Shortly after initiation of the reaction, the virus-antibody complex was completely reversible by dilution. Given sufficient time, however, the complex became irreversible. When monovalent antibody fragments were used, virus-antibody complexes were formed but failed to become irreversible. Lafferty (1963a,b) proposed that the transition to irreversibility represented the time required for the second combining valence of a bound antibody molecule to bind to an adjacent antigenic site on the same virion. That such monogamous bivalent binding occurred was demonstrated by electron microscopy (Lafferty and Oertelis, 1963) . Reversibility therefore requires the simultaneous dissociation of both antibody-virus bonds. The probability of such an event is proportional to the square of the probability of the single event. Lafferty (1963a) also suggested that close scrutiny of the methodologies employed in studies of neutralization could reconcile the two views, i.e., that a t least some features of a freely reversible system are characteristic of virusantibody interaction.
