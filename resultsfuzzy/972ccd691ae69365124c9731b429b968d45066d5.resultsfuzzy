When comparing the groups of hospitalized patients (n = 93) and discharged patients (n = 57), mean age was significantly higher for hospitalized patients. A correction for age was performed and statistical analyses results are inTable 4. Significant p-Values are in bold characters and p-Values at the limit of significance are underlined. Again, the subset of patients for whom hospitalization was not intended and not instituted after test results were received was excluded to focus on the most critical population. The remaining subset (n = 106) was then split up into the group of patients who were indeed hospitalized (n = 93) and those who were discharged from the ER (n = 13). The groups were significantly different in age, as hospitalized patients were older (60.4 vs 36.8 years; p < 0.001) and a correction for age was performed for statistical analyses (Table 4) . When data were available, length of stay of hospitalized patients was compared between the group with a positive FilmArrray result (n = 49) and the group with a negative result (n = 43). As the mean age was different between the two groups (55.8 years for the group with a positive result vs 65.7 years for the group with a negative result; p = 0.010), a correction for age was applied. Even though the length of stay was longer when the FA result was negative (15.7 vs 9.3 days), the apparent difference was at the limit of significance after correction for age (p = 0.056).
