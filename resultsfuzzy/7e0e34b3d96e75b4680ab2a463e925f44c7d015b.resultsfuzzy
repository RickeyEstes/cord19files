SARS is an acute respiratory disease caused by a newly identified coronavirus SARS-CoV. The spike protein on SARS-CoV plays a crucial role in viral entry into the host cells, and therefore becomes the major target of neutralizing antibodies preparation. Specificity of monoclonal antibodies to the SARS-CoV spike protein makes them important for the early diagnosis, viral pathogenesis studies and vaccine development. Under specialized biosafety facilities, purified SARS-CoV viral lysates with high infectious potential are most commonly used as immunogens for anti-SARS antibodies preparation [5, 16] . Two recent reports have developed DNA vaccine with SARS N protein and truncated spike protein, which are shown to induce specific antibody and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) generation by two or three times intramuscular DNA immunization in several months [17, 18] . Here, we developed a mAb against SARS-CoV by a single-shot intrasplenic immunization of plasmid DNA encoding one fragment of ACE2-binding domain in the spike protein in a short time. Instead of hazardous wild-type SARS-CoV, chimeric MLV/SARS-CoV pseudotype virus was used to characterize this mAb. With immunoinformatics, we analyzed S1 domain in the SARS-CoV spike protein and selected fragment S1-3 (residues 430-454 aa) as the immunogen. Plasmid DNA encoding S1-3 was injected directly into the spleen of BALB/c mice to trigger immunological reaction. The antisera were analyzed with an ELISA plate coated with synthetic polypeptides or SARS-CoV lysates. In our preliminary experiment, all intra-spleen immunized mice showed positive immune response from day 5, and the sera titer peaked as 1:10 4 at day 7, much faster than protein or intramuscular DNA immunization. Therefore, we performed the hybridoma fusion 7 days after intra-spleen injection of pcDNA-S1- 3 . Some investigations demonstrated that it was possible to obtain good hybridoma production within a very short immunization time and irrespective of the antibody response of the intrasplenic immunized animal [10, 12] . The antibody responses of immunized mice were crucially determined by the expression of antigen in transfected spleen cells, which was concerned with the natural trait of the encoding antigen and the expression vector used. In the 24 hybridoma clones, 3E8 was subcloned and the mAb was determined as IgM isotype. Culture supernatants and ascites of 3E8 recognized synthetic S1-3 polypeptide specifically in ELISA assay. We also established mAb against SARS-CoV nucleoprotein (N protein) by singleshot intrasplenic inoculation of plasmid encoding an epitope (residues 20-49 aa) of N protein. Specific anti-N antibodies could be detected in mice at day 5 with ELISA kit coated with synthetic N protein fragment or SARS-CoV lysates (data not shown). These data suggested that S1-3 in the spike protein and fragment of N protein were potent epitopes, and single intrasplenic injection of eukaryotic expression plasmid coding antigens is efficient to induce specific antibodies in a short time, much faster than the protein or intramuscular DNA immunization. SARS-CoV is highly contagious and must be handled under stringent protection, so we utilized MLV/SARS-CoV pseudotype virus to evaluate 3E8 mAb. MLV pseudotype virus could inherit new cell tropism of envelope protein donating virus [13, 15, 19] . In this study, the genome of MLV was pseudotyped to carried SARS-CoV spike protein and GFP reporter gene. Viral supernatant from transfected 293T cells was concentrated 15-fold to a titer of 7.48 Ã— 10 4 IU/ml. MLV/SARS-CoV could infect SARS-CoV-susceptible Vero E6 cells, since giant multinucleated Vero E6 cells with EGFP fluorescence appeared after infection (Fig. 1) . And the titer was also determined by the percentage of GFP-positive Vero E6 after infected. To investigate the specificity of the mAb, the supernatants from 3E8 hybridoma cells were used as the primary antibody to probe lysates of MLV/SARS-CoV-infected 293T cells, and a band with MW of 170-180 kDa was detected (Fig. 2) . No signal was observed in mock-transfected 293T cells, suggesting that the 3E8 mAb could specifically recognize the spike protein. Spike protein is a type-I membrane protein; a portion of spike proteins unincorporated into the budding virions will be transported to the plasma membrane of infected cells. To determine whether the mAb recognizes spike protein in space, 3E8 mAb was used as the primary antibody to detect spike protein on MLV/SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. As shown in Fig. 3 , positive signals were predominant on the plasma membrane of the infected Vero E6 cells, whereas there is no signal on non-infected cells. These data suggest that 3E8 mAb could recognize the spike proteins on the infected cell surface. We further explored whether mAb 3E8 could block the combination of SARS spike protein to its receptor. After preincubation with 3E8, MLV/SARS-CoV showed the same infectivity to Vero E6 cells, as there is no difference in the percentage of GFP-positive cells after infection as compared with untreated MLV/SARS-CoV (data not shown). The epitope to which a specific antibody bind is usually five to eight amino acid residues on the surface of the antigen, and the epitope recognized by the antibody may correspond to the simple primary sequence structure, or a specific three-dimensional antigenic conformation. The 3E8 mAb is suitable for Western blotting and immunofluorescence assay but failed to reduce the infectivity of the MLV/SARS-CoV, suggesting that this non-neutralizing mAb may recognize a linear epitope but not a conformational one. In conclusion, we have developed a monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV spike protein by a single-shot intrasplenic DNA immunization. This intrasplenic DNA immunization route might shed light on the production of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against the exiguous antigens, which are difficult to prepare or dangerous in use. In future, SARS-CoV studies, neutralizing antibodies against spike protein, can be generated with this efficient approach for possible therapeutic purpose.
