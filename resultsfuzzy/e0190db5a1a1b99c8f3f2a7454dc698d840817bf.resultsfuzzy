The quantification of impacted region by the expired air is not easy. By plotting the pathlines originating from the human mouth and nose is a simple and intuitive method. However, such method is not accurate because the expired air may quickly mix with the surrounding air and the strong diffusion effect is nontrivial, which is unable to be represented by the pathlines. On the other hand, only the actual inhalation dose by a person does actually indicate the threshold level to be symptomatic. The local pollutant concentration should be known to obtain the inhalation dose. For simplicity, this investigation has proposed to quantify the impacted region of expired air according to the percentage of concentration decay, by assuming the baseline concentration at the initial release Table 2 Measurement thermal/flow boundary conditions.
