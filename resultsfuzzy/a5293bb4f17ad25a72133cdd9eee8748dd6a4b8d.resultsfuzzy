Including present case, 9 cases (age 20~63, male 5, female 4) with anaphylaxis by ant siting have been reported in Japan since 1987. The numbers of ant stings just before the onset of anaphylaxis were 1 to 3. The intervals between ant stings and onset of anaphylaxis in most cases were less than 15 minutes, except 2 cases without description and 1 case, in which the onset was two hours after the ant sting. Symptoms include wheal and urticaria, diarrhea, dyspnea, and hypotension. As for diagnosis, the causal relationship between ant stings and anaphylaxis was established mainly based on their temporal order. The patients themselves or doctors in charge caught the ants on the same day or later, enabling determination of the ant species. In most cases, the ants were identified as B. chinensis. The proof of IgE antibody against ant protein was done by skin prick test only in 2 cases. Our present case is the first Japanese case in which IgE antibody against B. chinensis protein was directly proved. Epinephrine was used in 5 cases, while only anti-histamine and glucocorticoid were used in other cases with good prognosis. All patients had prior history Background: The etiology of chronic urticaria (CU) remains unknown in most patients. Possible causes in some cases include food, but the role of hypersensitivity to food antigens in patients with CU remains controversial. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between food hypersensitivity and CU in 350 Korean participants. Methods: Patients with CU were assessed for a previous history of food hypersensitivity that caused symptoms of CU. Blood samples were taken from the patients to measure food allergen-specific IgE. Based on history and laboratory results, open oral food challenge (OFC) tests were performed. Results: Of 350 participants, 46 (13.1%) claimed to have experienced previous food hypersensitivity. Pork (n=16) were the main foods mentioned, followed by beef (n=7), shrimp (n=6) and mackerel (n=6). We found that 73 participants (20.8%) had elevated levels of foodspecific IgE, with pork (n=30), wheat (n=25), and beef (n=23) being the most common. However, when the open OFC tests were conducted in 102 participants with self-reported food hypersensitivity or raised levels of food-specific IgE, only four participants showed a positive reaction to pork. Conclusions: Although some participants claimed to have a history of CU related to food intake, when an open OFC test was conducted, few of them had positive results. We therefore conclude that food allergy is an uncommon cause of chronic CU. We enrolled the patients with physician-diagnosed ACOS (n = 207) and COPD (n = 258) from the medical records in a university hospital. The patients with ACOS had younger age and lower FEV 1 than COPD patients. With regard to skin prick test (SPT) responses, the overall positive rate was higher in ACOS than in COPD (22.3% vs. 14.3%, P = 0.027). However, the positive SPT responses to each allergen were not different between ACOS and COPD. In addition, there was no significant difference in levels of peripheral blood eosinophil percentage and total IgE. Conclusions: In conclusion, SPT positivity was higher in ACOS, but the other features of atopy were not different between ACOS and COPD. In the diagnosis of ACOS from COPD, SPT positivity needs to be considered as an important clinical feature. Of the 71 patients 50 were male, 21 were female. Median age was 7.5 years with a range from 3.3 to 22.5 years. The reason for elimination of CN in 8 patients (including 2 with anaphylaxis) was a history of immediate reaction to CN. Fifty seven patients had eliminated CN due to a positive CN specific IgE. Atopic dermatitis was seen in 76% (54/71), asthma 45% (32/71), allergic rhinitis 36% (27/71), allergic conjunctivitis 17% (13/71). History of immediate reaction to nuts other than CN was seen in 23% (16/71) of the patients and history of immediate reaction to peanut in 31% (22/71). Eighteen % (13/71) of the patients were positive in OFC and 82% (58/71) negative. Of the 13 patients with a positive OFC, anaphylaxis was seen in 5 patients. Oral mucosal symptoms were seen in 9 cases, gastrointestinal symptoms in 9 cases, cutaneous symptoms in 7 cases, respiratory symptoms in 6 cases, neurologic symptoms in 3 cases and cardiovascular symptoms in 1 case. Seven patients were treated with antihistamine, 5 patients with steroids, 4 patients with inhaled Î²2 stimulant and 1 patient with adrenaline. In the comparison of OFC between positive and negative patients, a significant difference (p<0.01) was seen in a history of immediate reaction to CN and CN specific IgE. There was no significant difference in other factors including sex, age, history of immediate reaction to nuts other than CN, immediate reaction to peanut and anaphylaxis due to CN. Hypersensitivity to Platinum-Based Chemotherapy Hye Jung Park 1,2 , Chein-Soo Hong 2 , Jae-Hyun Lee 1,2 , Sungryeol Kim 1,2 , Kyung Hee Park 1,2 , Choong-Kun Lee 2 , Beodeul Kang 2 , Seung-Hoon Beom 2 , Sang Joon Shin 2 , Minku Jung 2 , Jung-Won Park 1,2 1 Severance Hospital Regional Pharmacovigilance Centre; 2 Yonsei University College of Medicine, South Korea Correspondence: Hye Jung Park -Severance Hospital Regional Pharmacovigilance Centre World Allergy Organization Journal 2016, 9(Suppl 1):A227 Background: The prevalence of immediate hypersensitivity reaction (IHSR) to platinum-based chemotherapy has been rising, with the increase of chemotherapy usage. Although there is a proven ultimate solution, desensitization protocol, it has not yet applied in many institutes because of impracticalities such as cost, procedure duration and lack of trained manpower. Prediction of the success of a desensitization protocol will help reduce unnecessary workload. Objective: We aimed to determine the clinical characteristics and currently adopted measures against oxaliplatin IHSR and to predict the success of our newly developed practical desensitization protocol. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 2,640 cases of oxaliplatin IHSR in 271 oxaliplatin users who admitted to Severance hospital. We prospectively used our new desensitization protocol 31 times in 12 patients with hypersensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy. The new desensitization protocol was conducted with escalating of infusion rate regularly regardless of the concentration of bags, in order from 60 mL/h to 120 mL/h and 240 mL/h about every 15 minutes. Results: In 271 patients who administered oxaliplatin, 45 patients (16.6%) experienced oxaliplatin IHSR. In 39 patients, who experienced IHSR but need to keep oxaliplatin, 6 patients (15.4%) stopped due to the IHSR and 33 patients (84.6%) kept the regimen regardless of the anticipated risk. Any significant risk factor for the IHSR was not found. The new desensitization protocol was successfully completed in 12 patients (100%). However, among these 12 patients, the protocol was ineffective in 3 patients having fever without urticaria and a negative response in a skin prick test. Conclusions: Many patients who experience oxaliplatin IHSR are required to stop the effective regimen or maintain the regimen without desensitization with the anticipated risk of IHSR. Our new practical desensitization protocol might be applied easily and conveniently in real clinical practice. Fever without urticaria and a negative response in a skin prick test indicate that this desensitization protocol might be ineffective. Background: Bacterial flagellin, which is a Toll-like receptor5 agonist, is used as an adjuvant for immunomodulation. Recently, intranasal administration of OVA flagellin mixture was reported to be effective in allergic inflammation. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect and its mechanism of intralymphatic administration of OVAflagellin mixture in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Materials and Methods: BALB/c mice was sensitized with OVA and treated with OVA-flagellin (FlaB) mixture via intranasal, sublingual and intralymphatic routre to evaluate the effect of intralymphatic administration. Then several parameters of allergic inflammation was assessed including symptom score, eosinophil and neutrophil infiltration in the nasal mucosa, systemic cytokine levels, and Total and OVA-specific imuunoglobulin E. To evaluate the mechanism of intralymphatic injection, local cytokine, chemokine, and innate cytokine analysis was undertaken using real time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. Results: Intralymphatic injection by OVA-FlaB mixture reduced symptom score, eosinophil infiltration in the nasal mucosa and total and OVA-specific IgE levels more significantly than intranasal and sublingual administration. The systemic cytokines(IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-17 and IFN-r) and local cytokines(IL-4, IL-5) production were also decreased significantly in intralymphatic injection by OVA-FlaB. Double administration of mixture was more effective than single administration. Moerover, the expression of innate cytokine such as IL-25, IL-33 in nasal epithelial cells were decreased and the chemokine expression such as CCL24(eotaxin-2) and CXCL1,2 were decreased in the nasal mucosa, suggesting the underlying mechanism of intralymphitc administration of OVA+FlaB mixture. Conclusion: Intralymphatic administration of OVA+FlaB mixture was more effective in alleviating allergic inflammation than intranasal and sublingual administration in mouse model of allergic rhinitis and this effect could be attributed to reduced expression of innate cytokine and chemokines. This modality could be considered as a new therapeutic method and agent. Background Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) hypersensitivity is a commonly found drug allergy, in which two major phenotypes, respiratory (aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease <AERD>) and cutaneous (aspirin-exacerbated cutaneous disease <AECD> or aspirin-intolerant acute urticaria <AIAU>) types were noted in this country. Periostin is an extracellular matrix protein and structurally homologous with fasciclin I, an insect adhesion molecule. Previous study demonstrated that serum periostin level was significantly higher in AERD than in aspirin tolerant asthma. To evaluate serum periostin level as a biomarker for differentiating the phenotypes of NSAIDs hypersensitivity, we compared serum periostin levels between respiratory and cutaneous types of NSAID hypersensitivity. Methods Serum periostin levels were measured by human periostin ELISA in sera from 326 adult patients with NSAID hypersensitivity and 87 healthy normal controls (NC). The phenotype of NSAID hypersensitivity was defined according to previous histories of adverse drug reaction and/or aspirin provocation test. Results There were 45.7% of respiratory type of NSAID hypersensitivity (n=149) and 54.3% of cutaneous type (n=177). Mean serum periostin level was significantly higher in respiratory type (82.6 Â± 38.8 ng/mL) than in cutaneous type (39.7 Â± 31.1 ng/ML) and NC group (46.2 Â± 29.0 ng/mL). However, there were no significant differences of serum periostin levels between AECD and AIAU groups (P = 0.708), between AECD and NC groups (P = 0.195) , and between AIAU and NC groups (P = 0.110). The ROC analysis revealed that serum periostin level could differentiate AERD from cutaneous type of NSAIDs hypersensitivity (AUC = 0.826, P < 0.001) and cut-off level was 42.5 ng/mL with 93.3% of sensitivity and 61.0% of specificity. Conclusion These findings suggest that serum periostin level can be a useful biomarker for predicting the phenotype of AERD among NSAID hypersensitivity patients. Background: An early identification of sensitization pattern in suspected allergic children may supply evidence-based clues for prevention and management of allergic disease. Objective: To analyze the sensitization status to common inhalant allergens for children with suspected allergies in Beijing Children's Hospital in year of 2013. Methods: The enrolled children were screened for allergies through a semi-quantitative testing method (Mediswiss Allergy Screen allergen testing system, Germany), and a further comparison for sensitization patterns among different subgroups was performed. Results and conclusion: A total of 21,134 children had screened for allergies. In out-patient subjects, the positive rate of sIgE was 45.99% (8266/17974 cases), the top three positive allergens were mold, dog hair and dust mites. For the inpatient group, the positive rate of sIgE was 29.34% (927/3160 cases) and the top three allergens were dust mites, dog hair, and mold. It was also found that the highest positive rate was from children suffering from the nose or eye disease (outpatient:2092/3126,66.92%; in-patient:14/26,53.85%). Especially for the inpatients HSP children, when co-infected with lower respiratory tract infections(LRI), the positive rate was increased (HSP: 370/1024, 36.1%; HSP+LRI: 370/1024, 42.7%, P<0.05), and it was more likely to lead to the appearance the multiple sensitization. Therefore, it is necessary to keep a watch on the variation in the sensitization state, and to pay greater attention on interpreting testing results, which enables to supply the pediatrician a rational treatment and prophylactic strategy on the allergen avoidance. Oxidative stress has been postulated to play an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation. Nrf2 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of many antioxidant genes. In the present study, we investigated the role of Nrf2 on an experimental model of Ovalbumin (OVA) -sensitized and challenged allergic airway inflammation in both of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Nrf2â/â and Nrf2+/+ mice were used in both of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Allergic airway inflammation was generated in the mice by intraperitoneal sensitization with OVA/alum on days 0, 6 and 7. The mice were challenged with OVA intranasally on day 21. After OVA challenge twenty-four hours, we examined the cell populations in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and the IgE levels in the serum. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was assessed by whole-body plethysmography with a free-moving application. The number of total cells, macrophages and eosinophils in BAL fluid was decreased in Nrf2-/-compared with Nrf2+/+ mice, this was also the case for the AHR changes in both of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. The number of neutrophils in BAL fluid and the IgE levels in the serum were significantly increased in Nrf2-/-compared with Nrf2+/+ in BALB/c mice; in contrast, there was no significantly different between Nrf2-/-and Nrf2+/+ in C57BL/6 mice. In conclusion, the role of Nrf2 in the generation of allergic airway inflammation differs markedly between mouse strains. Our results suggest that Nrf2 may play a key role in the development of allergic airway inflammation related to neutrophils in BALB/c mice. Background: Neutrophils play an important role in the development of persistent airflow limitation in asthma, particularly in patients who show poor response to corticosteroids. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) has emerged as a new treatment option due to its immunomodulatory effect, however, the role of hMSCs in neutrophilic asthma is not yet understood. Method: BALB/c mice were exposed to ovalbumin and poly IC to induce neutrophilic airway inflammation. hMSC was administered intravenously, and then, bronchoalveolarlavage (BAL) was done to evaluate differential cell count and measure inflammatory cytokine including IL-8, IL-5, IL-10, IFN-gamma. We also measure cytokines include IL-17, IL-4, IL-10, IFN-gamma released from lymphocyte in pulmonary lymph node. In addition, lung histopathology was done to show peribronchial and perivascular inflammation. Result: hMSC treatment decreased BAL total cell count (P < 0.001), neutrophils (P < 0.001) and lymphocyte (P < 0.01) IL-5 in BAL fluid was decreased in hMSC treatment group (P < 0.01), however, IL-8, IL-10 and IFN-gamma showed no differences compared with wild type. IL-17 released from lymphocyte in pulmonary lymph node was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Histopathologic examination revealed that peribronchial inflammation was dramatically decreased in hMSC treatment group. Conclusion: hMSCs inhibited airway inflammation in poly IC induced neutrophilic asthma model. The mechanism underlying its immunomodulatory effect might be associated with down regulation of IL-17 which has key role in Th17 mediated inflammation. Background: Although several studies have claimed that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from human tissues can ameliorate allergic airway inflammation, the immunomodulatory mechanism of MSCs remains unclear. Objective: We aimed to determine the effects and underlying mechanism of tonsil derived MSCs (T-MSC) on allergic inflammation as compared to adipose tissue derived stem cells (ASCs) in mouse model of allergic rhinitis (AR). Methods: MSCs were isolated from human palatine tonsil (T-MSC) and adipose tissues (ASC), and the surface markers were analyzed. The effect of T-MSCs was evaluated in 24 BALB/c mice that were randomly divided into 4 groups (negative control group; positive control group; T-MSC group and ASC group). MSCs were administered intravenously to OVA-sensitized mice (T-MSC and ASC groups) on days 18 to 23 and subsequent OVA challenge was conducted daily from days 24 to 28. Several parameters of allergic inflammation were assessed. Results: T-MSC and ASC had similar characteristics in surface markers. Intravenous injection of T-MSC significantly reduced allergic symptoms, eosinophil infiltration, serum total and OVA specific-IgE and the nasal and systemic Th2 cytokine profile. Further analysis revealed that nasal innate cytokines such as IL-25 and IL-33, and chemokines such as CCL11, CCL24 induction were suppressed in T-MSCs injected groups, explaining their underlying mechanism. Additionally, the T-MSC group had more inhibition of allergic inflammation than the ASC group, which might be attributed to the more proliferative activity of T-MSC. Conclusion: Administration of T-MSC effectively reduced allergic symptoms and inflammatory parameters in the mouse model of AR. T-MSC treatment reduced Th2 cytokines and OVA specific IgE secretion from B cells. In addition, innate cytokine (interleukin-25 and inteleukin-33) expression and eotaxin mRNA expression was inhibited in the nasal mucosa, suggestive of the mechanism of reduced allergic inflammation. Therefore, T-MSC treatment is potentially an alternative therapeutic modality in AR. Objective: Allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma are a major global health problem in developed and developing countries like India. These diseases have an adverse impact on the patient's quality of life (QOL) and also pose a big socio-economic burden. Yoga has shown to have some beneficial effect on improving the sleep quality, lung function and quality of life in patients with asthma. But there is no scientific study on the effect of Yoga on airway resistance in patients with AR. The aim of this study was to assess the subjective and objective effects of yoga and also to see if Yoga can be adapted as a cost cutting intervention for better control of asthma and AR. Methods: The present study was conducted on 31 adult subjects with mild-moderate persistent AR with or without asthma. These patients were trained in specific Hatha yogasanas which are known to improve respiratory functions. The participants practised these asanas for 12 weeks. The subjective and objective outcome measures were assessed at baseline (Day 0) and at 12 weeks post yoga, using Rhinomanometry, Spirometry, Sino Nasal Outcome Test questionnaire and QOL Short Form 12. Results: There was a significant reduction in the Total Nasal Resistance (TNR) at 150 Pa/ml/s (p<0.001) and a significant increase in Total Nasal Airflow at 150 Pa/ml/s (p<0.01) after yoga as compared to the corresponding baseline values at day 0. Indices of pulmonary function such as FVC (p<0.001), FEV1 (p<0.05), Forced mid-expiratory flow at 75% of FVC (FEF 75%) (p<0.05) and PEFR (p<0.01) showed significant improvement. QOL questionnaire, Short Form 12 showed a highly significant improvement in both physical (p<0.001) and mental (p<0.01) composite score along with significant reduction in the Sino Nasal Outcome Test score (p<0.001) post yoga as compared to the corresponding baseline values. Conclusions: The direct cost of treatment such as medications and hospital visits etc., as well as the indirect cost due to loss of productivity is significantly high in patients with AR and asthma. The results of this present study conclude that the practice of yoga offers a significant advantage in patients with AR by reducing their nasal resistance, increasing nasal airflow, improving lung functions and their quality of life. Further studies are needed to analyze the immunologcal mechanisms involved in this form of therapy, the impact on acute exacerbations, the need for rescue medication and the long term effects of yoga. A true patient-physician partnership further empowers the patients compliance and adherence, thereby their function and health. Background and Objectives: Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common skin disorder characterized by hives and itching for at least 6 weeks. The QOL in CU can be substantially impaired due to its unpredictable symptoms and long-term nature. This study was aimed to evaluate the impact of CU on QOL by using the CU-specific QOL measurements, previously validated in Korea, and to identify the predictors of QOL in CU patients. Methods: We enrolled 390 adult patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria who were followed in the Allergy and Clinical Immunology Clinic in Ajou university hospital from March 2009 to December 2012. The CU-QOL questionnaires, urticaria activity score (UAS), the presence of angioedema, and serum total IgE levels were investigated. Results: The average CU-QOL scores was 70.6 of 100 points. The CU-QOL scores significantly correlated with the UAS, particularly with our 15-point UAS (UAS15, coefficient -0.532, P <0.01) than the 6-point UAS (-0.502, P<0.01). Total CU-QOL scores significantly decreased in patient with severe CU (UAS15 scoreâ¥13) than nonsevere CU (52.3 vs 72.1, P <0.001). In cases having angioedema, the urticaria symptom domain scores significantly decreased (37.4 vs 46.9, P = 0.004) than those with urticaria only. Multivariate analysis showed that severe CU, high log[total IgE], and the presence of angioedema were significant predictors of CU-QOL impairment (<85 points). Conclusions: It is important to consider QOL impairment and severe CU, log[total IgE], and the presence of angioedema are significant CU-QOL predictors in Korean patient with CU. Background: In house dust mite (HDM) allergic asthma, symptoms occur due to airway eosinophilia and Th2 cell activation. Budesonide is used to treat airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness. We showed that dietary non-digestible galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) suppress symptoms in a murine model for HDM-induced asthma. The aim is to study combined dietary GOS and budesonide treatment on allergic asthma in mice. Methods: BALB/c mice were intranasally (i.n.) sensitized with PBS in presence or absence of 1Î¼g HDM and challenged i.n. with PBS or 10Î¼g HDM on days 7 till 11 while being fed a diet containing 0, 1 or 2.5 w/w% GOS. On day 7, 9, 11, and 13 budesonide was either or not instilled oropharyngeally. On day 14, airway resistance to metacholine and inflammation were determined. Leukocyte subtypes were analyzed in the broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) and in lung cell suspensions. Mucosal mast cell protease-1 (mmcp-1) was measured in serum and cytokines in lung homogenates. Results: HDM-allergy significantly increased airway responsiveness and BAL leukocyte numbers. Budesonide treatment suppressed this, which reached significance in mice fed GOS. Budesonide reduced the number of lymphocytes and eosinophils in the BAL. Feeding GOS in absence of budesonide treatment reduced the number of eosinophils as well. In addition, both GOS as well as budesonide reduced mmcp-1 serum concentrations. Interestingly, only in the GOS fed mice, budesonide treatment reduced IL-33 and IL-13 concentrations and the frequency of Th2 cells in the lung. Conclusions: Dietary intervention using GOS may be a novel way to improve effectiveness of anti-inflammatory drug therapy in asthma. This study was performed within the framework of Carbohydrate Competence Center (WP25). Adherence to the AIT regimen was good till the end of the treatment period and 20 subjects in AIT group and 18 in the control group reached the final observation at 15 years from baseline: the mean SCORAD index in AIT group decreased from 59.72 to 44.55, in control group from 57,04 to 55,55; the use of topical corticosteroids was halved in AIT group vs. control group; the use of oral corticosteroids was decreased only in AIT group; 2/20 patients in AIT group developed rhinitis and asthma, in control group 14/18 developed rhinitis and 9/18 asthma, requiring regular pharmacotherapy; only 2 patients in AIT group developed new sensitizations, whereas all controls resulted polysensitized. Conclusion. AIT tablets of HDM carbamylated monomeric allergoid were well tolerated and provided sustained and long lasting partial improvement of the severity of atopic eczema, with remarkable reduction in the use of corticosteroids and preventive effect on the progression to respiratory allergy and onset of new allergic sensitizations. Objective To explore the levels and correlation of 90 food sIgG antibodies in serum in patients with allergic diseases. Methods Using ELISA to detect 90 kinds of sIgG antibody of 291 patients with allergic diseases in the first affiliated hospital of Guangzhou Medical University for diagnosis and differential diagnosis, Data were analyzed by SPSS19.0 statistical software. The object was to evaluate the effectiveness and benefits of long term stay for asthmatic children after the continuous treatment with vitamin D and physical exercises.The evaluation was done by the comparison of laboratory examination of blood and physical parameters in the beginning of the stay and in the end of the stay. It was determined the hypothesis that the long term stay has significant positive effect on level of vitamin D3 31.80 mmol/l in the beginning of the stay vs 45.58 mmol/l(p<0.001) and some parameters of physical fitness of children in the study done by modified Cooper'stest such as the test of abdominal muscles 18.45 pull s/min vs 27.15 pulls/min (p<0.001). Young-Hee Nam, Dong Sub Jeon, Soo-Keol Lee Dong-a University School of Medicine, South Korea Correspondence: Young-Hee Nam -Dong-a University School of Medicine, South Korea World Allergy Organization Journal 2016, 9(Suppl 1):A425 Background: Asthma is characterized by chronic inflammation associated with airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) which is measured using bronchial challenge testing. Mannitol as an indirect challenge has showed better reflect the complex effects of inflammation compared with direct challenges, and which is simple, safe, and more practical to use. Following airway hyperreactivity may be a useful strategy in asthma management because hyperreactivity may be abnormal even in patients with mild asthma and normal lung function. Airway hyperreactivity may better reflect airway inflammation and risk for deterioration than dose lung function or asthma symptoms. We investigated to analyze the follow-up results of mannitol challenge tests in asthma patients. Methods: A total of 59 asthmatics repeated mannitol tests at Dong-A university hospital from May 2010 to February 2015. We compared the clinical characteristics between negative conversion and persistent AHR group. Results: Fifty-three (89.9%) showed AHR to mannitol at initial test, 28 (47.5%) of whom had no AHR (negative conversion, groupI) and 25 (42.4%) had persistent AHR (group II) at follow-up test. Six had no AHR at initial test, 2 had response to mannitol at follow-up test. There were no significant differences in sex, age, smoking habits, levels of eosinophil of serum and sputum, and baseline lung function. A longer duration of asthma and high frequency of asthma exacerbation was observed in group IIthan in group I, while the proportion of atopy and steroid-naÃ¯ve patients were higher in group I. Total IgE and sputum eosinophil was much more decreased in group I compared with group II. Conclusions: In this study, 42.4% of asthma patients showed persistent AHR to mannitol. The negative conversion group of AHR may be associated with atopy, history of no ICS use, and improving of eosinophilic inflammation. In the environmental chamber test, a proportional relation between ambient HDM material concentration and allergen content sampled was proven. The proportional relation was significant considering the variance of the allergen concentration due to the dispersal system as well as the accuracy of the allergen analysis itself. In the maximum particle size test, even whole HDM bodies could be sampled, thus stuck on the stripe. Conclusion: The personal particle sampler is suitable for determining an individual's exposure to HDM material. However, it still has to be proven, that the concentration measured by the personal particle sampler correlates with an allergenic person's recognized symptoms in real life. Introduction: Severe atopic dermatitis (AD), seen in 1-15% of cases may present with rare uncommon complications such as poor weight gain, malnutrition, trace elements (including zinc) deficiency. These were published as case reports only, with on large studies, particularly on children. Objectives: to determine frequency and severity of zinc deficiency in AD children, and find out if there is any association between zinc level and AD severity or body mass index. Methods: retrospective, case control study. Review of records of all children (<14 years) seen at Ped Allergy-Immunology clinics of Hamad General Hospital during Jun 2014-2015 with severe AD who had zinc level tested. In addition to demographic data, lab. tests (CBC with differential, IgE, serum zinc, vitamin D, food allergens tests of SPT or specific IgE), SCORAD and weight and height were collected. Results: 23 children (out of 130 children, 17.7%) were found to have serum zinc-low (ZL). We case-controlled them with a group of 23, age-matched, normal-zinc (ZN) AD children. The 2 groups were similar in age (48 vs. 46 months), sex, co-existing allergies (26.1%) vs 26.1%), and no. of positive food allergens per patient (1.9 vs 2) and type of food allergens. ZL had higher positive family history of allergies (91.3% vs. 69.6%) and parental consanguinity (39.1% vs 26.1%) than ZN. Besides ZL had higher WBC (15,554 vs. 11,223 cells/ul), peripheral blood eosinophils (846 vs 685 cells/ul), and IgE (3,132 vs. 2,086 Ku/L), but lower serum zinc (8.3 vs. 12.3 umol/L) levels, lower BMI (15% vs.18%). Both groups had similar SCORAD (62 vs 63). There was no significant association between zinc level with BMI or SCORAD compared to control group. Conclusions: Zinc deficiency is quite common among children with severe AD. It seems positive family history and parental consanguinity are risk factors for it. AD zinc deficient children have elevated allergic inflammatory makers irrespective of AD severity. Background: The association between HLA-B*5801 and severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (SCARs) consisting of Stevens -Johnson Syndrome (SJS)/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) and Hyper-Sensitivity Syndrome (HSS)/Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been strongly reported in different ethnic populations. The strongest association has been described in Taiwanese study which HLA-B*5801 was found in 51/51 patients with allopurinolinduced SCARs ). In Vietnam, however, this allele has not been yet confirmed or revealed as a relevant pharmacogenetic risk factor for the situation of allopurinolinduced SCARs while its prevalence is as high as 6.5%. Therefore, in this study, we sought to determine the association between HLA-B*5081 with allopurinolinduced SCARs in the large teaching center of allergy and clinical immunology at Bach Mai Hospital. Methodology: Twenty -two cases of SCARs caused by allopurinol and confirmed by using established criteria, were recruited. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole peripheral blood with EDTA using Qiagen kits, as instructed by supplier. Polymerase chain reaction using sequence -specific primers was used to detect HLA-B*5801. Genotyping of the amplified products were determined using agarose gel electrophoresis. A random sample of positive samples was validated using direct DNA sequencing. After comparing results from both methodologies 100% agreement was found. Results: A total of 22 patients comprised 13 SJS/TEN (59.1%), Overlap 1 (4.5%) and 8 HSS/DRESS (36.4%) were genotyped. Out of 22 individuals, 21 (95.9%) patients were positive for HLA-B*5801. Conclusion: Our result suggests a strong association between HLA-B*5801 and allopurinolinduced SCARs in Vietnamese. These finding is the first to be described in the Vietnamese population. Considering that HLA-B*5801 is present in 6.5% of the general Vietnamese population, our study shows that there is a significant risk that someone carrying the HLA-B*5801 allele will suffer from a drug induced SCAR if treated with allopurinol. More individuals suffering from SCAR are also of a burden on the health system and thus needs to be addressed. Future studies will be performed on a larger sample of individuals followed by a case-control study. The data was analyzed by doing a Paired (2-tailed) T-Test, using the SPSS (Software package for the social sciences) version 16.The mean standard deviation of the nasal airway resistance was found to be 0.36 Â± 0.10 Pa/cm3/s before doing yoga and it was 0.30 Â± 0.10 Pa/ cm3/s at 150 Pa pressure after doing yoga ('p' value was <0.01). The mean standard deviation of the FEV1/FVC % before doing yoga was 73.6 Â± 18.7 and after doing yoga was 81.8 Â± 9.9 ('p' value was <0.05). Quality of life questionnaire, SF-12 showed highly significant improvement in both Physical (p<0.05) and Mental (p<0.05) composite score and there was significant reduction in SNOT score (p<0.001) after the practice of yoga. The total protein concentration of AP extract was 4.47 Î¼g per Î¼l. The AP extract SDS-PAGE pattern revealed 17 protein bands ranging from 10 kD to 100 kD. The mean wheal diameter induced by ID was significantly higher in the AP extract sensitized group compared to the sham group (P=0.00). Immunoblotting using pooled sera of AP extract sensitized mice revealed a major IgE-binding component of approximately 42 KD and several minor IgE-binding proteins ranging from 12 to 37 kD. Conclusions: In the present study, several AP extract IgE-binding proteins have been identified as a potential cause of immediate hypersensitivity reactions in sensitized subjects. These findings open up avenues for identification of AP extract allergenic proteins and its allergen-based diagnosis in patients suffering from allergic symptoms during the pollination period of this species. The allergenic pollen seasons of representative trees, weeds and grasses during the 2000s across the CONUS have been observed to start 3.0 (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.1-4.9) days earlier on average than in the 1990s. The average peak value and annual total of daily counted airborne pollen have increased by 42.4% (95% CI, 21.9%-62.9%) and 46.0% (95% CI, 21.5%-70.5%), respectively. Changes of ragweed pollen season timing and levels were identified as functions of latitude, and associated with changes of Growing Degree Days, Frost Free Days and precipitation. Conclusion: These changes are likely due to recent climate change and particularly the enhanced warming and precipitation at higher latitudes in the CONUS. The observed pollen season start date, season length and airborne pollen level could be correctly predicted using Bayesian and machine learning models based on the locally observed meteorological factors. Background Specific subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) with house dust mite (HDM) has been shown to improve clinical symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma in China, while less data regarding efficacy, safety and immunological mechanisms of specific sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) in allergic patients. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy, immunological mechanisms of SLIT HDM compared to SCIT HDM in rhinitis patients with HDM during 1 year of treatment. Method Recruitment took place from November 2009 to September 2010. The study enrolled 67 patients aged 5. '55 years old with moderate-severe HDM induced allergic rhinitis with or without asthma. They were randomized (2:2:1) in three groups (SLIT group, n=27; SCIT group, n=26; Placebo, n=14, following the same schedule as SLIT group). The allergic rhinitis and asthma symptom and medication score collected from patient diary cards (from baseline to 1 year) were used for assessment of efficacy. Visual analogue score (VAS) were collected and skin prick tests, total-specific IgE were performed at baseline and 12 months after treatment. In addition, patients underwent Der p IgG4 and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells measurements. Results SCIT groups had a significant improvement for the change from baseline in mean total rhinitis symptom score compared with placebo after 1 year therapy (P=0.015), but between SLIT and placebo groups there were no significant difference(P=0.060). Both two groups had a significant improvement in mean rhinitis medication score compared with placebo (P<0.05), and the analysis of rhinitis VAS score change from baseline showed the same results. The mean asthma symptom or medication score did not show significant difference among the three groups. There was a trend toward upregulation in the rate of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells from baseline to 1 year in both SCIT and SLIT subjects compared with Placebo group(P<0.05). The level of Der p IgG4 showed a significant increase in both SLIT and SCIT compared with placebo (P<0.05), furthermore, the mean level of Der p IgG4 of SCIT group was almost thirty times higher than SLIT group after 1 year therapy (P<0.05). Conclusion Both SCIT and SLIT had the efficacy in patients with moderate-severe HDM sensitized allergic rhinitis after 1 year of treatment, and SCIT also afford significant therapeutic benefits with respect to rhinitis symptom score. Serum Der p IgG4 and CD4+CD25+ FoxP3+ Treg cells may play roles in modulate immunoresponse to specific immunotherapy, but their relationship between clinical efficacy needs further study.
