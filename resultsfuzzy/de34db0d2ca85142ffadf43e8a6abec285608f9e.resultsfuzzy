To investigate the replication ability of IBV in vitro, CEK cells were infected with IBV at an MOI of 1. The replication of IBV was quantified by RT-qPCR to detect the IBV genome load in cell culture supernatants, and N protein was detected by a Western blot assay. We observed a significant increase in the IBV genome load in cell culture supernatants, with the highest level occurring at 60 h post-infection for the IBV-infected cells compared to the other time points (Fig. 1a) . The IBV N protein expression data are illustrated in Fig. 1b and c. The highest expression level of N protein occurred at 72 h post-infection. To monitor the kinetics of the chMDA5 and IFN response in relation to IBV replication in vitro, the transcription of chMDA5, chIFN-β, chIFN-λ and chMx was quantified in IBV-infected CEK cells (Fig. 2a-d) .
