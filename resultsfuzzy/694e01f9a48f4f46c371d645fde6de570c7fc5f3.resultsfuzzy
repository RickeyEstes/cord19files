A total of 41/45 (91%) calves were Cryptosporidiumpositive by immunofluorescence at some stage during the study. Two calves belonging to Group 2, that were able to be followed up for the entire observation period, remained parasitologically negative throughout the study (Table 1) . Sequence analysis of the 18SrRNA gene of the 9 fecal specimens analyzed by PCR-sequencing indicated the presence of C. parvum in all cases. Out of 23 specimens analyzed for other enteropathogens, 21 (91%) were positive for rotavirus and 3 (13%) for Salmonella Typhimurium. As expected for calves of this age, no E. coli K99-positive specimens were identified. Although analysis for Giardia spp. was not the subject of this study (as the parasite it is not widely considered pathogenic for calves), we note for completeness that Giardia cysts were observed in 20 calves by immunofluorescence.
