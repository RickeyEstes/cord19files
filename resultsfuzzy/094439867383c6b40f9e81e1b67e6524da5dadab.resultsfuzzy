We found strong support (100% of bootstrap replicates from the MP analysis of the seven genes, and posterior probabilities of 0.99 for both the molecular data and the molecular data plus morphology) for monophyly of the microgastroid complex, sensu Wharton (1993) , Mason (1994), WhitWeld (1997a) , and . Our Wnding of monophyly for Microgastrinae agrees with an earlier analysis of 16S data that also found the microgastroid complex to be monophyletic, although with equivocal bootstrap support WhitWeld, 1997b ). An analysis of portions of 16S and 28S rDNA also found strong bootstrap support for monophyly of the microgastroids . Our Bayesian analysis of the combined molecular and morphological characters found a relationship for the braconid subfamilies of (Cheloninae, (Mendesellinae, (Microgastrinae, (Cardiochilinae, Miracinae)))). Belshaw et al. (1998) found a similar relationship for the microgastrine subfamilies, excluding Mendesellinae, from an analysis of a portion of the 28S region. These results however, conXict with a MP analysis of portions of the 16S and 28S genes and 11 morphological characters , and a Bayesian analysis of portions of 16S 18S and 28S regions and 96 morphological characters (Min et al., 2005) , that found a relationship of (Adelinae + Cheloninae, (Miracinae, (Microgastrinae, Cardiochilinae))). We intend a more extensive examination of subfamily relationships within the microgastroid complex in the near future. It is diYcult to compare our estimate of relationships within Microgastrinae to other studies, as generally diVerent or fewer microgastrine species were sampled in those studies (e.g., Belshaw et al., 1998; . We found Microplitis and Snellenius represent an early diverging lineage of microgastrines. A phylogeny estimated from portions of 16S and 28S also found Microplitis to be basal as did a phylogeny estimated from a portion of 28S (Mardulyn and WhitWeld, 1999) .
