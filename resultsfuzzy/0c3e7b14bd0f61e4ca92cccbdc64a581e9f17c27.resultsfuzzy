At least one pathogen was identified in 90 out of 95 (95%) patients. Bacterial infection was observed in 73 patients (77%) and 60 (63%) had bacterial infections solely. Respiratory viral infection was found in 30 (32%) patients and 17 (17/95, 18%) had viral infections solely. Viral/ bacterial co-infection concerned 13 (14%) cases. Among the 73 patients with bacterial infections identified in respiratory specimens, 7 (9%) had concomitant positive blood cultures. HSV was found in 7 (7%) cases and fungal infection in 3 (3%) cases (Pneumocystis jirovecii n = 1, Aspergillus species n = 2). RVs were more likely to be found in immunocompromised patients (19/45, 42% vs. 11/50, 22%, p = 0.04). Distribution of all pathogens identified is shown in Table 2 .
