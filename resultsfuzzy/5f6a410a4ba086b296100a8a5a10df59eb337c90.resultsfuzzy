Cumulative incidence over time. In Technical Appendix 4, we provided a total of 31 plots of cumulative incidence over time (left panel) and log10 (cumulative incidence) over log10 (time) (right panel), for Hubei province, mainland China (except Hubei), and then each of the provinces except Tibet (as there was only one case). Thus, we linearized an exponential curve. If social distancing would have an impact, the slope of the log-log plot would decrease, indicating a decreasing epidemic growth rate.
