The possibility of generating false positive results by sample contamination is a major risk of NA amplification techniques. Clinical specimens or products of previous amplifications (carry-over) are the most common source of contamination. In order to minimize this risk, it is recommended to maintain CSF sterility in all the pre-laboratory and laboratory steps and to carry out the different laboratory steps in separate areas (Persing, 1991) . In addition, some laboratories use the enzyme uracil N -glycosilase (UNG), which degrades products from previous amplifications but not native NA templates, to prevent carry-over of amplification products. This is accomplished by substituting dUTP for dTTP in the amplification mixture, and pretreating all subsequent mixtures with UNG prior to amplification (Longo et al., 1990) . More in general, the use of negative controls, usually water or known negative samples tested in parallel with the CSF specimens throughout the whole procedure, and analysis of samples in duplicate, are useful to recognise false positive results. False negative results can be caused by the presence of inhibitors, i.e. molecules affecting the correct functioning of enzymes. Inhibition of amplification has been reported in 1 √Å/5% of CSF specimens . In order to reveal the presence of inhibition, it may be useful to amplify 'internal standard' molecules together with the target. In addition, amplification of Rozenberg and Lebon, 1991) . Conserved DNA sequence from the polymerase genes of HSV-1, HSV-2, EBV and CMV are amplified simultaneously in the same tube by a consensus primer pair targeting regions in common to these viruses. Following agarose gel electrophoresis, the amplified products have similar length (top) but each virus can be distinguished by using restriction enzymes (bottom) (a, Sma I and b, Bam HI; M: DNA marker). Alternatively, viruses can be differentiated following hybridization with virus-specific probes or DNA sequencing. both strong and weak positive controls in parallel with CSF samples can further help monitoring amplification efficiency of the whole reaction. It is not infrequent that viral NAs are found in the CSF in patients with infectious or noninfectious CNS diseases, but without a clear causative association with the disease itself. This is more frequently observed with viruses that may be latent in circulating blood cells, brain or other body sites. An example is the detection of EBV in CSF of patients diagnosed with other CNS infections, such as HSE or HIV-related opportunistic infections (Cinque et al., 1996b; Tang et al., 1997; Studahl et al., 1998; Portolani et al., 1998) . Theoretically, this finding might result from sliding of virus or latently infected lymphocytes through an impaired blood-CSF barrier, but also from reactivation of EBV infection in the CNS (Bossolasco et al., 2002) . Viral genomes have also been found in the CSF of patients with non-infectious CNS diseases. For instance, both JCV and HHV-6 genomes have been demonstrated in patients with multiple sclerosis, though their etiologic role in this disease has never been confirmed (Ferrante et al., 1998; Liedtke et al., 1995) . In other instances, viral NAs can be detected in CSF prior to the onset of clinically relevant neurological symptoms, which can be advantageous in order to allow for an early diagnosis. This has been observed in AIDS patients, in whom viral agents, e.g. CMV or EBV */not yet causing clinical disease */may occasionally be identified in CSF in patients with another neurological complication (Cinque et al., 1996b) . These examples are the consequence of the extreme sensitivity of NA amplification techniques, and underline the importance of careful interpretation of NA amplification findings in CSF within the individual clinical contexts. It is likely that quantitative molecular techniques might be of help to discriminate a clinically significant infection, characterised by viral replication and high viral loads, from incidental CSF findings.
