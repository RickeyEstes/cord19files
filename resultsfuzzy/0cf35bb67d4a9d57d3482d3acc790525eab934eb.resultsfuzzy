LNA Binding Supports the SHAPE-Directed Model of the Frameshift Region. We initially attempted to bind antisense LNAs to folded full-length genomic RNA extracted from HIV-1 virions. However, addition of LNAs directed against the anchoring helix failed to produce detectable SHAPE reactivity changes in the predicted partner strand. This result could reflect either that the targeted helix was too stable to be disrupted by LNA binding or that our model in the frameshift region was inaccurate. When we heated the HIV-1 RNA at 95°C for 5 min in the presence of LNA and snap cooled on ice prior to incubation in folding buffer, we found that SHAPE reactivities did increase in the predicted partner strand upon addition of LNA, indicative of a very stable target helix. For the results obtained upon heat denaturation and LNA binding in the frameshift element region to provide clear biological insights, the conformation adopted after heat denaturation must be native-like. We performed SHAPE on HIV-1 RNA gently extracted from virions and on a sample of this same RNA following heat denaturation and refolding. The standard SHAPE reagent 1M7 30 and two additional SHAPE probing reagents, 1M6 and NMIA, were used in these analyses. 1M6 and NMIA are sensitive to different local structural states and time scales and consequently provide a detailed structural fingerprint for an RNA. 31,32 SHAPE reactivities for the genome region near the frameshift element were highly similar in both Figure 1 ). We conclude that the refolded frameshift domain adopts essentially the same conformation as the ex virio HIV-1 RNA purified under nondenaturing conditions. We designed 9-and 10-nt LNA oligonucleotides to bind to each of the strands of the three major helices unique to the SHAPE-directed frameshift model (Figure 1 ). If the targeted helix existed and if LNA binding disrupted native base pairing, we expected to observe increased SHAPE reactivity at the strand complementary to the LNA-bound strand. In all six cases, SHAPE reactivity increased for at least some nucleotides in the predicted partner strand (Figure 2, gray boxes) . These results strongly support the formation of the slippery sequence (Figure 2A,B) and alternate lower ( Figure 2C ,D) and anchoring helices ( Figure 2E ,F) in the full-length HIV-1 RNA. LNA Binding Allows the Conventional Lower Stem to Form. Although reactivity increases were consistently observed at the predicted partner strand upon LNA binding, most LNAs also induced additional SHAPE reactivity changes. For example, LNA 1 was designed to disrupt the slippery sequence helix. In addition to the expected increases in SHAPE reactivity at the partner strand (Figure 2A , gray boxes), LNA 1 binding also induced SHAPE reactivity increases at nucleotides 1585−1590 and decreases at nucleotides 1641−1644. Nucleotides 1585− 1590 are predicted to be single stranded in the SHAPE-directed frameshift model, while nucleotides 1641−1644 are predicted to form part of the alternate lower stem. The changes in SHAPE reactivity upon LNA binding suggest the formation of base-pairing interactions that correspond to the lower stem from the conventional two-helix model (Figure 2A, red boxes) . Binding to the complementary side of the helix by LNA 2 did not result in this conformational switch ( Figure 2B ). LNA 2 targets nucleotides in close proximity to, and possibly overlapping with, the conventional lower stem. In this case, steric occlusion due to LNA 2 binding likely disfavors formation of the conventional lower stem. LNA 3 was designed to disrupt the alternate lower stem. LNA 3 induced relatively minor increases in reactivity in the partner strand ( Figure 2C , gray box) and more pronounced changes in reactivity in other regions ( Figure 2C , red and yellow boxes). For example, reactivity at nucleotides 1641− 1643 was reduced relative to the reactivity in the no-LNA control, consistent with the formation of the conventional lower stem. LNA 4 was also designed to disrupt the alternate lower stem, and its binding resulted in the expected reactivity increases at the predicted partner strand but no significant changes elsewhere. We attribute this lack of a conformational switch to the fact that LNA 4 binding would prevent the formation of both the alternate and conventional conformations of the lower stem. Binding by LNA 5 or LNA 6 also resulted in SHAPE reactivity increases in the corresponding partner strands ( Figure 2E ,F) and in changes similar to those observed upon LNA 1 binding to the slippery sequence helix and LNA 3 binding to the alternate lower stem. SHAPE reactivities decreased for nucleotides 1641−1643 and increased for nucleotides 1590−1595, consistent with a transition from the alternate lower stem to the conventional lower stem. These results suggest that the anchoring helix stabilizes the alternate lower stem. Formation of the Conventional Lower Stem Destabilizes the Slippery Sequence Helix. Binding by LNAs 3, 5, and 6 all induced a switch in RNA conformation from the alternate lower stem to the conventional lower stem ( Figure  2C ,E,F, red boxes). Binding by these LNAs also resulted in increased SHAPE reactivity at the slippery sequence helix ( Figure 2C ,E,F, yellow boxes). Remarkably, these changes even occurred upon disruption of the relatively distant anchoring helix by LNAs 5 and 6. In contrast, LNA 4, which destabilized the alternate lower stem but did not induce the formation of the conventional lower stem, did not cause significant SHAPE reactivity changes in the slippery sequence helix ( Figure 2D ). These results suggest that the alternate lower stem and slippery sequence stabilize one another and are structurally coupled. Frameshift Helix Stability Revealed by Formamide Denaturation. We next examined the relative stabilities of the four main helices present in the SHAPE-directed frameshift element. Formamide denatures nucleic acid structure. 33 Therefore, we incubated HIV-1 RNA in buffer containing a range (0−60% vol/vol) of formamide concentrations with the expectation that global reactivity to 1M7 would increase with denaturant concentration. Following a 20 min incubation at 37°C in folding buffer, we added formamide and incubated the solution for a further 20 min before initiating SHAPE probing with 1M7. At 20% formamide, nucleotides involved in the slippery sequence helix showed increased SHAPE reactivity relative to the buffer without formamide ( Figure 3A,B) . Nucleotides involved in the alternate lower stem exhibited reactivity changes that suggest a switch to the conventional lower stem at 20% formamide ( Figure 3B and Supporting Information, Figure 2 ). In 40% formamide, SHAPE reactivities indicated that the conventional lower stem was unfolded ( Figure 3C ). Nearest neighbor thermodynamic calculations indicate that the conventional lower stem is slightly more stable than the SHAPEdirected alternate lower stem (−8.4 kcal/mol and −8.2 kcal/ mol, respectively). We hypothesize that the formation of the alternate lower stem is largely dependent on stabilization from other elements in the domain and that, when these interactions are disrupted by LNA binding or by formamide denaturation, the slightly more stable conventional lower stem is able to form. The anchoring helix and upper stem show very low SHAPE reactivities up to 40% formamide. Nucleotides in the anchoring helix became reactive only at 60% formamide, and nucleotides in the upper stem remained unreactive even at this high denaturant concentration ( Figure 3D ). The high stability of the upper stem was noted previously. 34 We conclude from these experiments that the frameshift domain is bounded by two highly stable helices and that the intervening less stable helices have the propensity to unfold upon perturbation and, in the case of the lower stem, refold into alternative conformations. Frameshift Domain Is Less Structured In Virio than in Isolated RNA. We next probed the frameshift region of HIV-1 RNA as it exists packaged inside virions using the well-validated 1M7 SHAPE reagent. Structural interrogation of the in virio state is possible because SHAPE reagents readily cross biological membranes. 35, 36 SHAPE probing indicated that the frameshift domain of RNA packaged within the virion adopted a much less structured conformation than that adopted by either gently deproteinized genomic (ex virio) or refolded RNA ( Figure 4 ). Nucleotides involved in the slippery sequence helix and lower stem, including both the conventional and alternate base-pairings, displayed higher SHAPE reactivities in virio than in isolated RNA. These differences could reflect RNA refolding or protein binding in the in virio environment. In contrast, SHAPE reactivities for the anchoring helix and upper stem remained low, suggesting that these elements folded stably inside virions. SHAPE-Predicted Alternate Lower Stem Is Required for Native-Like Frameshifting. While the LNA binding experiments confirmed the existence of all helices unique to the SHAPE-directed model, the formamide denaturation and in virio experiments showed that some of these helices are relatively unstable. To determine the biological importance of each of these helices, we examined a set of mutants designed to disrupt individual predicted helices and evaluated frameshifting efficiency in a dual luciferase reporter assay. 22 Using this system, we were unable to detect any significant effect on frameshifting upon disruption of either the anchoring helix ( Figure 5 , mutants 1 and 2) or the conventional lower stem ( Figure 5, mutant 3) . However, when the alternate lower stem was disrupted, a significant decrease in frameshifting was observed ( Figure 5, mutant 4) . We conclude that native-like frameshifting levels are dependent on the formation of the alternate, but not necessarily the conventional, lower stem. These results suggest that the alternate lower stem is a potential therapeutic target. A very different result was obtained when the anchoring helix, alternate lower stem, and slippery site helix were simultaneously disrupted by mutagenesis ( Figure 5 , mutant 5). In this case, frameshifting increased to greater than native- like levels. These results agree with a prior report that frameshifting efficiency of a construct containing only the upper stem and conventional lower stem is approximately twice that of a construct that contains the entire SHAPE-predicted domain. 22 Together, these data are consistent with a translational pausing mechanism whereby structured regions preceding the frameshift site regulate ribosome spacing. 37 That these results differ from those obtained when the anchoring helix and alternate lower stem were mutated independently supports our hypotheses that there is strong structural coupling between these elements and that these helices have overlapping functional roles in modulating frameshifting efficiency. Frameshifting at an Alternate Slippery Sequence Is Dependent on Downstream Structure. The alternate lower stem overlaps with a UUUUCUU sequence (nucleotides 1676−1682) that resembles the conserved UUUUUUA slippery sequence. In viruses resistant to protease inhibitors, the C in this downstream region is frequently mutated to U. 38 At the protein level, this causes a Leu to Phe mutation that may increase cleavage efficiency and enhance the production of functional protease. This site could also act as a secondary slippery sequence that increases the overall amount of frameshifting, thereby increasing the relative amount of protease to compensate for reduction in protease activity in the presence of inhibitor. 39 When the standard slippery sequence is inactivated by mutation, the mutant with the C to U change in the alternate slippery site, but not that containing the wild-type sequence, stimulates frameshifting in in vitro translation assays. In cell culture, no frameshifting was detected from the secondary site using HIV-1 sequences shorter than the 140-nt domain described here. 40 However, the construct used could not form flanking structures such as the anchoring helix and the adjacent 3-bp helix predicted by SHAPE-directed folding. We therefore revisited frameshifting from this alternate slippery sequence in the context of the complete frameshift domain. We inactivated the standard slippery sequence by sitedirected mutagenesis (Figure 6 , Δss); this reduced frameshifting efficiency by 5-fold in the luciferase reporter assay. The reporter containing the C1680U mutation in the alternate slippery sequence in this Δss background ( Figure 6, mutant 6) showed a 3-fold increase in frameshifting efficiency relative to the Δss construct. We then disrupted the anchoring helix ( Figure 6, mutant 7 ) and the adjacent 3-bp helix (mutant 8) in the Δss background. Disruption of the anchoring helix had no effect on frameshift efficiency, but disruption of the 3-nt helix reduced frameshifting to levels similar to those of the Δss construct. We conclude that the C1680U mutation creates a second functional slippery sequence and that frameshifting from the secondary site requires both a slippery sequence and a downstream base-paired structure.
