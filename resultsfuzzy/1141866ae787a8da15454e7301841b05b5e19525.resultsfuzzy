The disease prioritization discussion was a half-day meeting hosted by MOL on 13 November 2015 and involved two representatives from each the MOH, MOL and MOE. The meeting resulted in a list of six priority diseases: rabies, brucellosis, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF), anthrax, and trypanosomiasis ( Table 1 ). The group reached consensus without major disagreements, although there was substantial discussion over the categorization of VHF, and specifically if Ebola virus disease should be considered separately. In the end, it was included within the broader VHF grouping; other diseases specifically mentioned as important to be considered within that group included Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever (RVF), and yellow fever (YF). Figs. 2, 3 and 4 display the systems maps for rabies, brucellosis and HPAI, respectively. The systems maps for anthrax and trypanosomiasis are available as supplemental files (Figs. S1 and S2, respectively), in the interest of space, as they provided no substantial additional observations, gaps, or challenges.
