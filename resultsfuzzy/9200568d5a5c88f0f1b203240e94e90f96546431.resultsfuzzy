The phylogenetic tree based on the H9 HA gene, including the 21 H9 AIV examined in this study and 44 representative H9 AIV from the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ and GISAID databases, is shown in Figure 1 . The detection limit of the H9 rRT-PCR assay was determined by testing six replicates each of 10-fold serial dilutions of 5.0 × 10 7 copies/reaction of in vitro-transcribed full-length H9 HA RNA derived from isolate A/Hunan/44558/2015 (H9N2) of the Y280 lineage and isolate A/chicken/Egypt/F12173D/2016 (H9N2) of the G1 lineage ( Figure 1 ). An amplification plot for A/Hunan/44558/ 2015 (H9N2) obtained as raw data is shown in Figure S1 . Probit regression analysis of the data from the two viruses tested showed detection limits of 3.1 and 1.8 copies/reaction, respectively. The efficiency of the assay for the two viruses tested was 96.3% and 93.8%, respectively; the R 2 value was 0.99 for each virus, and the slope of the standard curve was −3.41 and −3.48 in the range between 5.0 and 5.0 × 10 7 copies/reaction, respectively ( Figure 2) . The H9 AIV examined in this study were classified into four lineages (Figure 1 ). The AIV of 11 belonged to Y280, five AIV belonged to G1, four AIV belonged to the Korean lineage and one AIV belonged to the North American lineage; all were detected by the H9 rRT-PCR assay (Table 2) Table 2 and data not shown). For these AIV, the H9 rRT-PCR assay exhibited amplification plots similar to the type A rRT-PCR assay ( Figure S2a) . A/duck/Hokkaido/31/97 (Korean lineage) and A/turkey/Wisconsin/1/66 (North American lineage), which were isolated over 20 years ago, could also be detected using the H9 rRT-PCR assay at RNA concentrations corresponding to a minimum of 500 and 50 copies/reaction of M gene RNA in viral extracted RNA, respectively (Table 2 ). However, both viruses could be detected at 5, 50 and 500 copies of M gene RNA per reaction using the type A rRT-PCR assay, suggesting that the H9 rRT-PCR assay is less sensitive against these past prevalent viruses ( Figure S2b) . The cross-reactivity of the H9 rRT-PCR assay was evaluated against other HA subtypes, H1 through H15 (except for H9) influenza A viruses, influenza B viruses and 19 other respiratory viruses (Tables 3 and 4) . No cross-reactivity was observed against RNA derived from these isolates, and no non-specific reactions were observed (Tables 3 and 4) . To demonstrate the robustness of the H9 rRT-PCR assay, we evaluated artificially reconstituted clinical specimens with or without seasonal influenza viruses and spiked or not spiked with the H9N2 virus. The H9 rRT-PCR assays could detect the HA gene of the H9N2 virus from all 12 artificially reconstituted samples spiked with the H9N2 virus, and no non-specific reactions were observed in the 12 clinical samples not spiked with the H9N2 virus ( Table 5 ). The Cp values for all 12 artificially reconstituted samples in the H9 rRT-PCR assay were almost the same as the Cp value for PBS spiked with the same amount of the H9N2 virus. Evolutionary distances were computed using the Kimura two-parameter method. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) and values of more than 50% are shown next to the branches. The viruses used in this study are shown in bold. *Viruses for which in vitro-transcribed RNA was used for rRT-PCR
