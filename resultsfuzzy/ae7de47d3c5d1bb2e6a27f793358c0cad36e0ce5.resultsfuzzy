To verify the proteins identified by MS, western blotting was performed. Many cytoskeleton associated proteins play important roles in virus infection (Dohner and Sodeik, 2005) . Vimentin protein was identified not only in GST pull-down assay but also in Co-IP assay. Therefore, the identified protein vimentin was selected for western blot analysis. Cellular proteins immobilized on GST-agarose beads in GST pull-down assay were examined with specific antibodies to vimentin (Fig. 3) . Results validated the MALDI-TOF/TOF identification of cellular proteins.
