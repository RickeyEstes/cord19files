We assumed that we had estimated values of the initial rate of exponential increase of infection incidence, r , the mean latent period, T E , and the mean generation interval, T G . We then used Eqs. (4, and 7) to calculate model-based estimates of the basic reproduction number using the assumptions of a fixed or exponentially distributed infectious period, leading to R fix 0 and R is an increasing function of both m and n. Putting these results together we obtain the inequality where m and n are any finite positive integers. Table 1 was constructed to illustrate the results that may be obtained for some specific infections. Parameters were chosen from the literature to be representative of influenza [20] , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [19] , smallpox [1] and foot and mouth disease (FMD) [11] . For each infection a trapezium distribution was constructed for f (τ ), and used together with an estimate of R 0 to calculate an estimate of the initial exponential increase, r . The function f (τ ) was also used to calculate values for the mean generation interval T G , the mean latent period T E and the mean infectious period T I . If these values of r , T G and T E had been estimated from data, and then R 0 had been estimated by R − 0 , R + 0 , R fix 0 , R exp 0 or R trap 0 , the estimates presented in Table 1 would have resulted. By construction, the estimated value of R trap 0 then corresponds to the assumed value of R 0 . Hence Table 1 must be regarded as a comparison of estimates that may be made; the relative values are important rather than the absolute values. The initial rate of exponential increase (r day −1 ), mean generation interval (T G days), mean latent period (T E days) and mean infectious period (T I days) that could be observed for epidemics of influenza, SARS, smallpox; and for foot and mouth disease (FMD) spreading between farms; together with the corresponding estimates of the basic reproduction number made using the approximations R − 0 = 1+r T G and R + 0 = e r T G , or assuming a rectangular, exponential or trapeziodal distribution for the infectious period, leading to R fix 0 , R exp 0 and R trap 0 , respectively
