The RDT was started by loading 10 μL of blood specimen into the hole of the cassette device, and then loading three drops (approximately 100 μL) of 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.0) containing 0.1% casein and 1% Tween-20 onto the sample pad. Approximately 20 min after application of the buffer, the results were interpreted. The control line was expected to appear in all tests. If a red band appeared at the test line, the specimen contained FeLV antigen.
