There were 968 drinking water supply zones, supplying 50 or more users in Slovenia, providing 1 820 000 (89%) residents with public water in 2010 (Table 2) . These supply zones were regularly monitored. Therefore, microbiological (check monitoring) and chemical (audit monitoring) data on water quality was available. 68% of the population has been covered by 78 supply zones (8 % of the total), serving more than 5000 consumers. Almost 800 small water supply zones serve only a small proportion of the population (9%). The rest of the Slovenian population (app. 230 000 inhabitants, 11%) is served by an individual supply of drinking water. These individual supply systems each serve less than 50 individuals and are not covered by the water quality monitoring programme. We determined more than 10% of non-compliant samples containing E. coli as contaminated supply zones, whereas other supply zones are considered uncontaminated. The proportion of non-compliant samples signifi cantly decreased as the size of the water supply zone increased: the percentages of non-compliant samples due to the presence of E. coli in small, medium and large supply zones were 18.9%, 3,7% and 0.5%, respectively. Another fact is that the burden of coliform bacteria in small supply zones was above 1000/100 ml. The burden of coliform bacteria in larger supply zones was signifi cantly smaller, less than 10/100 ml (the data is not shown).
