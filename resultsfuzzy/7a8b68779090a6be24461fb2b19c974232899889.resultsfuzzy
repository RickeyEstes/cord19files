DALI [22] is a well-established method and tool for pairwise comparisons of protein structures. DALI searches for viral proteases were performed to identify the structurally most similar cellular structures (structures published before 29 April 2017). In addition, DALI searches on S1D subfamily proteases (structures published before 15 th of April 2018) were performed to validate the division of the S1D subfamily into two groups.
