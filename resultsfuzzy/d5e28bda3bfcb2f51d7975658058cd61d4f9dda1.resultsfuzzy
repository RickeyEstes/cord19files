We are in the process of collecting data from the genetic characterisation of protozoa such as Iodamoeba, Entamoeba coli, Entamoeba hartmanni and Entamoeba polecki-like organisms isolated from clinical samples. Knowing the amount of diversity displayed among clinical isolates of these (and other) parasites will help us generate specific and sensitive primers that can be used in cases where a definitive diagnosis cannot be established on the basis of microscopy. Preliminary results show that the genetic diversity within Entamoeba coli is extensive, and that no less than four genetic subtypes of uninucleate amoebic cysts can be isolated from human faeces. We have also obtained genetic data from protozoan genera that have not been sequenced before. Conclusion: If future platforms for the diagnosis of intestinal protists are to rely on PCR, comprehensive data from molecular characterisation of these organisms are needed to design, evaluate, validate and optimise PCR protocols. The chemistry in the 4 fluoro series provided the target compounds in higher overall yields. Initial testing on both series of analogues was carried out on a chloroquine sensitive (3D7) and resistant strains TM6, K1, TM4, V1S and J164 at the Liverpool School of Tropical. It is apparent that several analogues have potent antimalarial activity against sensitive 3D7 strain of the parasite. The data indicates that 6 h is superior to the pyrollidino analogue 6b against all of the strains examined. It is also clear that N-tert butyl analogue 6b is potent against chloroquine resistant strains, though it is not quite as active as amodiaquine (AQ) against both chloroquine senstitive and resistant parasites. Conclusion: In summary, work conducted in this study has identified several potent back-up compounds to the clinical candidate. It is clear that the 4 fluoro series has several members with potent activity compared to amodiaquine. It has been shown that (6 h) has is slightly less potent than amodiaquine, chloroquine and the clinical candidate (4b). Further studies on the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of 6 h are necessary. The absence of speB was detected in four isolates, one of which was also the only isolate negative for speF. The latter was an emm28/ST52 strain isolated from blood. Sequencing confirmed a deletion of 4933 bp by comparison with the published genome sequence of the emm28 strain MGAS6180, between nucleotides 2463 and 7395 (GenBank NC007296). The other speB-negative isolates belonged to emm types 4, 11, and 13, and were all isolated from pharyngitis cases. Western blot and fluorescence microscopy analyses of pIRES2EGFP-SporoSAG-Bcl-xL transfected BHK-21 cells showed SporoSAG and Bcl-xL expression. Casp3 analyses rationalized Bcl-xL expression that impedes apoptotic cell death. Analysis of sera obtained from vaccinated mice showed anti-SporoSAG antibody response compared to controls. Cellular immune response analyses showed increased CD8 and IFN-g response compared to controls indicative of protection against toxoplasmosis. O152 Assessment of a new DNA vaccine candidate against urinary tract infection J. Fallah Mehrabadi°, M. Hoseini Moghaddam, S. Najafi, N. Khoramabadi, M. Mahdavi (Tehran, Zanjan, IR) Objective: Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is one of the most common infectious diseases and the major agent of UTI is Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Most of the time, it has affinity to attached to the vaginal and urinary tract mucosa tissue. UPEC has intracellular propagation, when do invasion of bladder epithelial cells. Therefore, cellular immune response is so important in this case. In our research, a genetic construct for inducing of cellular immune system was designed and immune response of immunized mice was evaluated. Materials and Methods: Chromosomal DNA extracted from E. coli 35218 as a positive type I pili strain and fimH gene amplified by using this template in PCR. The PCR product inserted to pBluescript cloning vector and sequenced. Then, the fimH gene sub cloned to pVax eukaryotic expression vector. The recombinant vector sequenced again. COS7 cell line transfected with a complex of pVax/fimH and ExGen 500 poly cationic polymer. Three groups of BALB/c mice immunized with recombinant DNA construct. The first group injected intramuscularly (i.m) with two doses (100 mg for every injection during two weeks) of purified pVax/fimH. The second group injected with the same amount of pVax vector and the third group injected with PBS as negative control. All mice challenged, one week following the second injection, with uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain 35218. Moreover, lymphocytes isolated from spleen of immunized mice and cultured for cytokines assay. Results: The sequence of E. coli 35218 fimH gene in our research showed more than 97% identity to other fimH sequence reports in GenBank. Expression of fimH gene in transfected COS7 was confirmed by RT-PCR. The result of challenge showed 100 times reduction of E. coli colonization in bladder tissue of first group mice. Additionally, IFN-g titer got rise in first group on compression with others groups. Discussion: fimH gene has a little variation among type I pili positive strains but it has less variation on amino acid sequences. Hence, it was detected more than 97% identity of E. coli 35218 fimH sequence with others. Expression of fimH in pVax/fimH cassette was confirmed by RT-PCR. Consequently, induction of cellular immune response was showed by increasing of INF-g titration in immunized mice. So, DNA vaccination has a potential candidate for limiting recurrent urinary tract infection. In total 300 (150 pork and 150 beef) samples were analyzed. All samples were negative for Clostridium difficile both at the microbiological and PCR analysis. Search for Toxin A and B gave negative result as well. Conclusion: Although public health relevance of Clostridium difficile contaminated food is yet to be clarified, these preliminary results prompt to consider that ground beef and pork do not represent a risk factor for human infection in North-East of Italy. Our findings are supported by those of Von Abercron (2009), who found a low prevalence (2%) of Clostridium difficile contaminated ground meet in Sweden. Differently Rodriguez-Palacios (2007) and Weese (2009) in Canada, and Songer (2007) in United States reported 12−20% and 42%, respectively, prevalence of Clostridium difficile contaminated ground meat. These apparently conflicting results may be due to different prevalence of Clostridium difficile at fatted calf and swine primary production or to different hygiene both at slaughterhouse and at retail outlets. The hypothesis should be further investigated. In the overall logistic regression model, length of stay, transfer from another NHS hospital, number of different antibiotics, number of days of quinolone antibiotics, degree of comorbidity and number of days of nitroimidazole antibiotics were identified as risk factors (see figure) . Reduction in odds of CDI with H2-blocker therapy was an interesting finding. The northern part of Europe, the Arctic will have three times higher temperatures than the rest of the world due to climate change. We have a lot to learn from what is happening in the circumpolar area for adaptation strategies. Parasitic infections as Leishmania, Opistorchis, Echinococcosis multilocularis and alveolaris are expanding along with Giardia intestinalis as some examples. The impact will differ regionally. Conclusion: Given the dynamis and the complexity of climate/sensitive infectious disease, particularly those transmitted by mosquitos or rodents Europe needs to develop and sustain surveillance and early warning systems with a regional focus. The newly included MLPA-probes were very specific for the targeted SNPs, allowing the detection of prevalent second-line drug resistance mutations and a further delineation of MTB complex members. The genotyping abilities of the MLPA assay were additionally increased by the discovery of a new genotypic marker. There will be an explosion of SNP discovery in the next years as data from high throughput sequencing projects become available. Methods allowing informative SNPs to be rapidly detected will then become increasingly valuable. Furthermore, we feel that the new analysis method for MLPA will specifically be of added value in low-income countries with high endemicity of DR-TB. The liquid array allows multi-parameter testing and could provide a standard platform for several diagnostic and screening tests, which are traditionally performed by several different methods. Therefore, MLPA combined with this detection system can bring molecular typing of MTB clinical isolates closer to the patient than is currently feasible. O235 Application of the rapid detection system for M. tuberculosis complex and rifampicin resistance Xpert MTB/RIF in decontaminated respiratory specimens, non-respiratory specimens and cultures L. Deforges, J.M. Le Glaunec, N. Launay, R. Vergne, A. Minaret, M. Marzouk, M. Marmiesse°, N. Finnström, P. Legrand (Creteil, Maurens-Scopont, FR) Objectives: GeneXpert (Cepheid) is an automated real-time PCR system which is very easy to use and suitable for emergency use. The principle of the Xpert MTB/RIF test, running on GeneXpert, is to detect M. tuberculosis complex and mutations in the gene rpoB that cause resistance to rifampicin. This is done directly from at minimum of 500 ml of a respiratory sample. After 15 min treatment of the sample all stages of the sample preparation and PCR takes place within the instrument in 1 h30. Some restrictions of use led us to validate this system on various types of samples. Methods: Respiratory samples were decontaminated with NACl/NaOH and 500 ml of decontaminated product added to 1.5 ml of lysis buffer (provided with the Xpert product). For non-respiratory nondecontaminated samples (CSF, pleural liquid and biopsies) the sample volume was sometimes too low. In these cases distilled water was added up to 500 ml before addition of lysis buffer. For solid culture one colonie was resuspended in 500 ml of distilled water, for liquid culture 500 ml of medium were centrifuged prior to addition of lysis buffer. Fifteen decontaminated respiratory samples (PPD) and 24 nonpulmonary samples ( Objectives: Although leprosy is treated by multidrug therapy since 1982, resistance to the first-line drug (dapsone, rifampicin) is described for 30 years and resistance to second-line drug as fluoroquinolones is described since 1997. Since Mycobacterium leprae is not growing in vitro, its susceptibility testing (one year experiment in the mouse footpad) is rarely done. Molecular methods are thus necessary to detect antibiotic resistance in leprosy and are so far in house methods requiring sequencing. Our aim was to provide a commercially based molecular test able to detect for antibiotic resistance in leprosy. Methods: M. leprae strains contained in biopsy skin samples were studied for resistance to dapsone, rifampicin and ofloxacin by the reference drug susceptibility method (the mouse footpad method). DNA was extracted and regions involved in resistance to the three drugs (rpoB gene for rifampicin, gyrA gene for ofloxacin and folP1 gene for dapsone resistance) were amplified and sequenced. The new DNA strip test, GenoType ® LepraeDR, was applied blindly. Results were compared to those obtained by the genotypic method (PCR sequencing) and the phenotypic reference method (mouse footpad). Results: Among the 91 M. leprae strains, 14 were resistant to rifampicin, 18 were resistant to dapsone and 1 was resistant to ofloxacin. For the resistant isolates, PCR sequencing was 100% concordant with the mouse footpad test with mutation (numbering system of the M. leprae genome) in rpoB (10 S456L, 2 S456M, 1 Q438V, 1 G432S), in folP1 (5 P55L, 3 P55R, 7 T53I, 2 T53A, 1 T53V) and gyrA (1 A90V). Results obtained by the GenoType ® LepraeDR test were 100% concordant with the two reference methods. For the susceptible strains, there were two discordances between the mouse footpad testing and the PCR sequencing: PCR-sequencing showed in one strain a silent mutation at codon 427 in rpoB and in a second strain a serine to cysteine substitution at the same codon, which were both not associated to rifampicin resistance. GenoType ® Leprae DR showed a wild-type pattern for rpoB for these two isolates. Objectives: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is known as the etiological agent of paratuberculosis (Johne's disease) in ruminants. Crohn's disease is an inflammatory gastrointestinal tract disease in humans, presenting with similar symptoms and pathological changes in the gut as Johne's disease in cattle. Therefore, it was suggested that MAP could be one of the etiologic factors of the disease. The aim of the present study was to develop a MAP-specific real-time PCR assay providing the additional possibility of detecting viable MAP. Methods: A real-time PCR assay based on amplification of the specific Mptb52.16 target was designed including an internal amplification control to identify false negative results. The detection limit was established in artificially contaminated raw milk samples and the optimized assay applied to 96 naturally contaminated raw milk samples. The potential of the real-time PCR assay to detect viable MAP was explored by assessing expression of the Mptb52.16 target in raw milk samples and inoculated Dubos broth. The method showed 100% inclusivity and exclusivity when testing 11 MAP strains, 22 non-MAP mycobacteria, and 16 raw milk microflora strains. The detection limit in artificially contaminated raw milk was 2.42×10 1 MAP cells/ml milk. In a survey of naturally contaminated samples obtained from dairy herds with a known history of paratuberculosis, 47.8% pre-milk and 51.9% main milk samples tested positive. Real-time PCR-derived MAP-specific bacterial cell equivalents (BCE) ranged from 1×10 0 to 5.1×10 2 BCE/51.44 ml; the majority of samples had less than one BCE per ml milk. Expression of the chosen target was detected in artificially contaminated raw milk as well as inoculated Dubos broth, thus confirming the real-time PCR assay's potential to detect viable MAP cells. Objectives: The objective of this study is to determine whether the activation of a cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific T cell-mediated response during pre-emptive therapy controls further replication episodes without valganciclovir administration in solid organ transplant (SOT) patients at high risk for CMV infection. Methods: SOT recipients at high risk for CMV infection, those that are seronegative and receive a seropositive graft, were followed for 18 months after transplantation. CMV viral loads (VL) were determined by real-time PCR, and the CMV-specific immune response was characterized by flow cytometry by the detection of CD4+, CD8+ and CD3+ T cells expressing CD69 and secreting IFN-g and IL-2. Preemptive treatment was administered when VL reached 1,000 copies/ml. Once a CMV-specific immune response was detected no treatment was administered and patients were closely monitored. Results: Eleven patients with a median age of 53 years were included. Between 2 and 7 weeks after transplantation, all patients experienced CMV replication episodes that ranged from 787 to 1,432,217 copies/ml. All of them were resolved after administration of valganciclovir. Between weeks 10 and 20 post-transplantation a CMV-specific immune response was detected in all patients. After this, 33 replication episodes were detected, 32 of which (97%) were controled by the host immune system without the administration of treatment (VL ranging from 10 to 31,317 copies/ml). Furthermore, although the number of positive PCR results was similar before and after the acquisition of immunity, VL levels were significantly lower (p = 0.017) after immunity than before with median values of 1,696 copies/ml and 20,110 copies/ml, respectively. From week 39 to week 51 all replication episodes were 1,000 copies/ml and no new replication episodes were detected after week 51. In this study we demonstrate that delta lgt-LTA induced immune activation critically depends on the immobilization of LTA and the phagocytic activity of blood cells as well as the presence of human serum components, which was also observed for LTA of the respective wild type S. aureus (wt-LTA) albeit with a lower degree of significance. Under experimental conditions, conducive to optimal LTA stimulation, we found no differences between the immunostimulatory capacity of delta lgt LTA and wt-LTA arguing for a limited contribution of possible lipoprotein contaminants to wt-LTA mediated immune activation. Interestingly, we found that LTA specific IgG antibodies, here detected in human sera at varying levels, can bind to immobilized delta lgt-LTA and thereby strongly augment delta lgt-LTA mediated immune activation in human peripheral blood. Conclusion: Our results not only suggest a novel mechanism for delta lgt-LTA mediated immune activation in human blood cells that involves an opsonization-dependent uptake and recognition process of LTA but also provide a conclusive explanation for the controversial findings obtained in previous experiments comparing the immunostimulatory capacity of delta lgt-LTA and wt-LTA. The hBoV was detected in a range of 6% to 12.8% in different clinical presentations. Most hBoVs were detected in children less than 3 years of age and in cold seasons. Statistical differences were observed in age group and seasonal distribution of hBoV in asthma exacerbation cases (P = 0.031) and gastroenteritis (P = 0.024), respectively. However, there was high nucleotide identity (99.18%-100%) between all hBoV sequences, the phylogenetic analysis resulted in 3 genetic groups ( Figure 1 ). 14 of the 864 nucleotide positions were variable, when compared to Swedish reference strain (accession number NC_007455), with 10 transitions (71.4%) and 4 transversions (28.67%). At the amino acid level, there was 98.46-100% sequence identity among isolates and only two changes were found at codon 152 (S → T) and codon 207 (V → M). Figure 1 . The crystallographic structure of the CphA-10a and CphA-18 indicated that the sulphur atom of 10a and the phosphonato group of 18 interact with the zinc ion respectively. Molecular modelling on the VIM-4 (B1) and FEZ-1 (B3) enzymes with 10a and 18 also brought to light different binding modes depending on the enzyme and the inhibitor, consistent with the crystallographic structures. The deferred antagonism assay showed NI02 to have good activity against a range of Gram-positive pathogens including vancomycin resistant enterococci, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria sp., Bacillus subtillis and Bacillus cereus and Gram-negative isolate Moraxella catarrhalis. NI02 also showed good activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms as coating microtitre plate wells resulted in complete inhibition of biofilm development and treatment of mature biofilms resulted in a significant reduction in biofilm density (P 0.001). The outbreak was disclosed Jan 30th 2009 after identification of multiresistant K. pneumoniae in clinical samples from three patients. Subseqently, 58 children were found to be colonized with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae after screening all patients in the NICU (26/27 colonized) and children discharged from the NICU or maternity ward during Nov 2008 to Jan 2009 (28/500 colonized). After cohorting and strengthened infection control measures another four children (4/89) at the NICU were colonized during Feb to April. Only one patient had a severe clinical infection (septicaemia) and recovered successfully after treatment with meropenem. All isolates (n = 58) expressed resistance to aztreonam, 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins, clavulanic acid synergy as well as co-resistance to aminoglycocides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and nitrofurantoin. CTX-M-type (group1) was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. All isolates examined (n = 17) displayed an indistinguishable Xba1-PFGEpattern. 49 colonized children and 80 family members were included in the follow-up study. After nine months of follow-up, 45 children (92%) are still colonized. Transmission to 16 family members (20%) has been detected. Conclusions: This is the first major hospital outbreak caused by ESBLproducing Enterobacteriaceae in Norway. The outbreak onset was about two months before the ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae-strain was identified. A subclinical outbreak like this is difficult to detect unless patients are regularly screened. Long time carriage in newborns is a possible reservoar for the spread of ESBL-producing bacteria in hospitals and in the community. In 2008, 1139 pts had a positive culture with an isolate I/R to CEPH (ESBL confirmation test positive in 81% of pts). 926 pts had an ESBL positive follow-up culture. The median colonisation time was 192 days (95% CI 172-216), the first quartile 56 days (95% CI 41−69) and the third quartile 365 days (95% CI 334-391) (Figure) . For 575 pts the first positive isolate was cultured during admission. Of the 470 with a follow up culture the proportion of pts with a positive isolate after week 1 was 63% and after week 2 58%. Conclusions: At least 75% of pts remain ESBL positive for at least 2 months and 25% of the pts is still carrier after one year. This implicates that flagging should be continued until screening cultures at (re-) admission are shown to be negative. At least 60% of the patients remain ESBL positive during hospitalisation. Since the real percentage is likely higher due to interference of antimicrobial therapy with culture results, the advice to perform 2-weekly surveillance cultures should be reconsidered. In a point-prevalence study in post-acute-care facilities (PACFs), we previously identified type of ward, prolonged length of stay (LOS) and infection control policies as ecological factors associated with CRKP colonization. It is important to distinguish between ecological and individual-level risk factors in order to direct interventions appropriately. Here we extended our analysis to assess individual risk factors for colonization among residents without history of CRKP carriage. Methods: A point-prevalence study was conducted in 12 PACFs. Rectal swabs were obtained from residents without a history of CRKP carriage in 33 wards. Suspicious colonies growing on CHROMagar™ KPC plates were speciated and tested for carbapenem susceptibilities by VITEK ® 2, supplemented by Etest ® . We used a nested, matched case-control study design to assess individual risk factors for colonization. Cases were defined as patients with positive rectal screening. Controls were selected from patients with negative rectal screening, matched to cases by ward. Patient data collected from medical records included demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, presence of skin lesions, presence of invasive devices, antibiotic exposure, number of colonized roommates, and PACF LOS. Results: Of 1004 residents without history of CRKP, colonization was detected in 119 (12%). Covariates entered into the matched multivariable model included: Norton score, antibiotic exposure during the past 3 months, skin lesions, receipt of amoxicillin-clavulanate during the past month and colonization with other resistant pathogens. Independent risk factors for CRKP colonization were: antibiotic exposure during the past 3 months (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.03−2.6, p = 0.04) and colonization with other resistant pathogens (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.06−2.6, p = 0.03). Conclusion: This nested, matched case-control study identified an important modifiable risk factor for CRKP colonization not identified in the ecological analysis: antibiotic exposure. Antibiotic control programs may have an important role in decreasing the burden of CRKP in PACFs. The overall incidence of invasive candidaemia during the three years under study was 4.75% with a marked increase from 2007 to 2009 (3.85% to 7.5%). The species isolated were the following: C. albicans 37.6%, non-albicans species 62.4% (C. krusei 30.2%, C. glabrata 21.7%, C. parapsilosis 5.6%, C. tropicalis 3.8%, C. lusitaniae 1.1%). We observed that the detection of C. albicans raised from 7.1% in 2007 to 55.5% in 2009, whereas C. krusei, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis incidence decreased over the three year period. C. glabrata isolation was almost the same during the whole period (28.6% in 2007, 22.2% in 2009). As far as C. albicans is concerned, we noticed an increase of resistance to amphotericin B (from 0% in 2007 to 6.6% in 2009) and voriconazole (from 0% in 2007 to 13.4% in 2009). C. krusei showed a raising resistance to amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole (from 0% to 40%, from 25% to 80%, from 25% to 50%, from 0% to 20%, respectively). In C. glabrata a marked increased of resistance to all the antifungal agents was observed. All the isolates of C. parapsilosis were resistant to voriconazole; in contrast, C. tropicalis was susceptible to all antimycotic agents. Conclusions: Our study confirms the high incidence of candidaemia in the setting of critically ill patients. C. albicans resulted to be the most prevalent species. The overall rate of resistance increased over the study period in all the Candida strains under consideration. ; neonatology, 32.5%; major heart surgery, 21.3%; and paediatric, 5%. We selected only 1 isolate per episode (83 isolates; 3 patients were co-infected by 2 different species). Antifungal susceptibility to fluconazole and voriconazole was determined using the CLSI M27-A3 microdilution procedure. The 80 fungemia episodes were caused by C. albicans (n = 32; 40%), C. parapsilosis (n = 27; 33.8%), C. glabrata (n = 9; 11.2%), C. tropicalis (n = 6; 7.5%), C. albicans + C. parapsilosis (n = 3; 3.8%), Arxula adeninivorans (n = 1; 1.2%), Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (n = 1; 1.2%), and Trichosporon inkin (n = 1; 1.2% Results: A total of 198 patients were included into the study, 10 ICU patients (5%) developed invasive Candida infections. Age, gender, SAPS II and euroSCORE of patients, the type and duration of cardiothoracic procedures and parenteral nutrition were no significant risk factors in our study population. In all invasive Candida infection patients severe Candida colonization (p < 0.001), leukocytosis >14 G/l or leukopenia <4 G/l (p = 0.03) and a SOFA score >8 (p = 0.002) were found. The risk for invasive Candida infections in cardiothoracic ICU patients was calculated using the following determinants: severe Candida colonization, leukocytosis or leucopenia, highest SOFA score >8, redo surgical procedures >2 and additional GIT surgery. Conclusion: Cardiothoracic ICU patients are at risk for invasive Candida infections at the presence of severe Candida colonization, leukocytosis or leucopenia, a SOFA score >8, additional GIT surgery and when undergoing multiple cardiothoracic interventions >3. Objectives: Candida bloodstream infections cause significant morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. While clinical and microbiologic factors affecting prognosis have been identified, the impact of immune responses, mediated by cytokines, on outcomes of infection remains to be studied. The present study assessed the role of genetic variation in cytokine genes on susceptibility and/or clinical outcomes of candidaemia. Methods: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six cytokine genes (IFN-g, IL-10, IL-12B, IL-18, IL-1B, IL-8) and one cytokine receptor gene (IL-12RB) were genotyped and analyzed with logistic regression in 365 patients with candidaemia and 351 non-infected controls. In addition, the presence of these SNPs and measured concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines were further analyzed for association with persistent fungemia ( 5 days of positive blood cultures) in 325 Americans with candidaemia. Other variables were assessed including type of Candida spp. identified, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), dialysis dependence, malignancy, immunocompromised state, renal/liver failure. Variables with p < 0.10 on univariate analysis were further analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Results: None of the SNPs examined were associated with susceptibility to candidaemia. Mean age of candidaemia patients was 55 years (±21.3), with 44% female, 32% African American, 58% immunocompromised, 31% active malignancy, 10% neutropenic, 43% recent surgery, 21% receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), 12% dialysis, 25% liver disease, and 49% ICU residence. The following species were identified: C. albicans (43%), C. glabrata (27%), C. parapsilosis (17%), C. tropicalis (12%), C. krusei (3%), >1 Candida species (6% In addition, significantly lower pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations were measured in serum from patients with persistent fungemia. Conclusions: SNPs in IL-10 and IL12B were associated with persistent fungemia in candidaemia patients, which also associated with low serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This may provide insights for future targeted management strategies for patients with this high mortality condition. The overall results are shown in 1999 -2008  The median antibiotic consumption increased from 1,256 DDD1000 1999 to 1,434 DDD1000 2008 . Antibiotic consumption varied widely between different units during 2008, ranging between 696 and 2,722 DDD1000 with a median of 1,434 DDD1000. Trend analyses of usage of different classes of antibiotics were performed and showed increased carbapenem, triazole and piperacillintazobactam consumption (p < 0.001). There was no significant change in consumption of cephalosporins for the ten year period but a trend towards decreased consumption the last two years. No significant correlation between antibiotic consumption and standardised mortality rate was shown. Conclusion: The high antibiotic consumption concurs with figures from European and US ICUs in general, but like a few ICUs in our programme, relatively low antibiotic consumption has been reported from Switzerland. The lower antibiotic consumption suggests that it is possible to reduce antibiotic consumption in the critically ill, but it has to be accompanied with a quality control system to make sure that it does not compromise patient outcomes. O475 Developing a database to facilitate the assessment of antimicrobial consumption in an acute tertiary hospital L.W. Hoo°, T. Kyaw Tun, D. Solanki, S. Foley (Dublin, IE) Background: Monitoring antimicrobial consumption trends is part of an effective systematic surveillance programme to prevent and control healthcare-associated infection and antimicrobial resistance. Expressing antimicrobial consumption data in the World Health Organizationrecommended measurement unit − Defined Daily Dose (DDD) per 100 bed-days, is important for benchmarking purposes. This is also a partfulfilment of the national guidelines of antimicrobial stewardship for hospitals in Ireland. Objectives: To achieve this aim, the following have been carried out: (1) a national survey on the opinions of pharmacists on data collecting for antimicrobial consumption in hospitals, (2) development of an antimicrobial consumption database (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) , expressed in DDD/100 bed-days, for hospital-wide and individual group of speciality wards/units, (3) evaluation of the antimicrobial consumption trends obtained from the database. The survey found a variation in the method of data collecting for antimicrobial consumption among hospitals. The lack of an appropriate pharmacy information technology and inadequate education and training on antimicrobial consumption data collection and reporting are some of the main issues of concern. Results from the evaluation of the consumption trends demonstrate the need to monitor hospital-wide and individual speciality wards/units separately. Limitations of the ATC/DDD system have been identified and taken into consideration when interpreting the results. Conclusion: Variation exists in the methods of collecting and reporting for antimicrobial consumption. The study has shown that setting up of antimicrobial consumption databases expressed in DDD/100 beddays can be done at a local level. An antimicrobial consumption database should be available in all hospitals to facilitate the close monitoring of antimicrobial consumption, frequent feedback reporting to the prescribers and also to supplement the surveillance of microbial resistance. Results: Out of a total of 5,733 patients antibiotics were prescribed in 3,732 (66.3%). These prescriptions contained 1−3 antibiotics, with a mean of 1.28 antibiotics per prescription. Indications were respiratory tract infections (32.2%), vaginal discharge (26.3%), urinary tract infections (16.3%), skin and soft tissue infections (15%), diarrhoea (9.2%) and prophylaxis (1%). Quinolones were the commonest group prescribed. Antibiotic prescribing was 37% less in academic hospital (P < 0.001). Prescribing peaked in rainy season with 70% of patients prescribed antibiotics. The independent predictors of antibiotic prescribing were seasons (2nd winter > 1st winter), facility (for profit > academic), age groups (adults > children), education level (illiterate > more educated), productive cough at presentation, ear discharge, pneumonia and dysentery. The number of patients per diagnosis, prescription rate with commonest prescribed antibiotic group with DDDs/ TPD per group is shown in table. Conclusions: Statistically significant association between antibiotic prescribing and seasons, for profit hospital, age groups, education level, symptom of productive cough at presentation, ear discharge, pneumonia and dysentery was found. High use of quinolones is a cause of concern. The most frequent bacteria isolated were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (37%), and S. aureus (SA) (17%). Overall 153 operations with CoNS and 74 with SA were found. Among CoNS 53% of the bacteria were resistant to aminoglycosides. The proportion of resistance increased from 35% in 1993-1997 to 43% in 1998-2002, and to 55% in 2003-2007 (p = 0.1) . The overall resistance of CoNS to the meticillin-group (MRSE) was 62%. We found that 45% were MRSE in 1993 -1997 . The proportion increased to 50% in 1998 -2002 and to 76% in 2003 -2007 Objectives: Clostridium difficile infection is the leading cause of nosocomial diarrhea. The emergence and spread of resistance in C. difficile are complicating the treatment and prevention. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and resistance mechanisms of Chinese C. difficile strains. Methods: 110 toxigenic C. difficile isolates collected between December 2008 and May 2009 at Fudan University Hospital Huashan were analyzed for their antibiotic susceptibility patterns using the agar dilution method. The heteroresistance to metronidazole in fresh isolates were detected by disc diffusion and Etest methods. Resistance molecular basis was investigated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. Results: 16 different PCR ribotypes were identified with a dominant clone 017 accounting for 37.3% of the isolates, followed by 001 and H. Ribotype 027 was not found but one isolate belonged to ribotype 078. All the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. However, 18 of 78 (23.1%) isolates were found to be transient heteroresistant to metronidazole. Resistance to moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, rifampin, rifaximin and fusidic acid was found in 61.8%, 100%, 66.4%, 85.3%, 88.1%, 62.7%, 29.1%, 29.1% and 8.2% of the isolates, respectively. The isolates of common PCR ribotypes were more resistant than the uncommon ribotypes. The prevalence of resistance genes and mutations among the resistant isolates was as follows: ermB, 69.1%; tetM, 97.1%; gyrA mutation, 63.2%; gyrB mutation, 4.4%; gyrA and gyrB mutation, 32.4%, rpoB mutation, 100%, respectively. The fusA mutation was only found in one isolate with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4 mg/L. The genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae comprises about 70 different virus species, many of which are arthropod-borne and transmitted to their vertebrate hosts by mosquitoes or ticks. Among those, the most important human pathogens are yellow fever virus, dengue viruses types 1 to 4, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Depending on specific and different natural host systems, these viruses differ with respect to their areas of geographical distribution but − at least in some instances − have the potential to emerge as new pathogens in previously non-endemic regions. Flaviviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses that have a lipid envelope and only three structural proteins, designated C (capsid), M (membrane) and E (envelope). Non-infectious, immature particles − containing a precursor of the M protein (prM) − are formed intracellularly and the proteolytic cleavage of prM by the cellular protease furin generates mature and infectious virions shortly before their release from infected cells. With respect to their structure, flaviviruses are among the best-studied enveloped viruses. The atomic structures of E proteins of several flaviviruses have been determined using X-ray crystallography, and the architectures of both immature and mature virions are known from cryo-electron microscopic studies. Through the combination of structural and immunological investigations, we have gained a detailed understanding of the effects of antibody-binding to the virus and its different antigens. This includes the definition of virus neutralization and antibody-mediated enhancement (ADE) of infectivity at a molecular level. The latter phenomenon has been proposed to play an important role in the immunopathology of severe forms of dengue virus infections (hemorrhagic dengue fever and dengue shock syndrome) in the course of sequential infections with different dengue serotypes. All of these structural insights have also shed new light on the different degrees of cross-reactivity between flaviviruses, including the existence of cryptic epitopes that are recognized by broadly flavivirus cross-reactive Nocardia infections S109 antibodies without leading to neutralization. The current picture of antibody interactions with flaviviruses will be presented in the context of their biological significance. Treatment of invasive aspergillosis: pharmacokinetics vs. resistance S496 Clinical impact of azole resistance P. Verweij° (Nijmegen, NL) The class of the azoles have become the most prominent class of compounds for the management of invasive aspergillosis. The clinically licensed triazoles with activity against Aspergillus include itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole. The azoles are also the only drugs that can be administered orally. The azoles interact with the biosynthesis of ergosterol, which is an important component of the fungal cell membrane. Intrinsic resistance to azoles has been documented for A. calidoustus, but the vast majority of species are susceptible in vitro. Recently, Aspergillus species with acquired resistance to azoles have been reported, especially in A. fumigatus. It appears that resistance may develop during azole therapy, especially in patients with chronic therapy including patients with chronic infection and aspergilloma. Another route of resistance development may be exposure of Aspergillus to azole fungicides that are used in our environment. Patients would then inhale azole-resistant conidia and develop azole-resistant aspergillosis. The consequence of this route of transmission is that azole-resistant disease may occur in patients without previous exposure to azole compounds. Azole resistance is commonly due to mutations in the Cyp51A-gene and is associated with different phenotypes. Isolates may be resistant to a single azole compound, but more commonly a cross-resistant phenotype is observed. Several cases of azole-resistant aspergillosis have been reported and commonly these patients failed to respond to azole therapy. Azole-resistant A. fumigatus isolates remain virulent and are capable of causing invasive disease in patients at risk. The efficacy of azole compounds against azole-resistant isolates, with different resistance mechanisms, has been investigated in experimental models of invasive aspergillosis. These indicate that the minimal inhibitory concentration has major impact on the efficacy of the azole. Elevated MICs are associated with loss of efficacy of the azole compounds in vivo. The use of azoles should be avoided in patients with azole-resistant aspergillosis, if possible. Alternative agents such as lipid-formulations of amphotericin B or caspofungin appear to retain their efficacy against azole-resistant isolates. A significant problem is the early diagnosis of azole-resistance as in the majority of cases an isolate is not obtained and, if an isolate is cultured, in vitro susceptibility testing causes delay in treatment with effective agents. The table shows that while TOB and DOR were cidal in broth (Emax ≈ −3 log CFU), their intracellular maximal efficacy was markedly reduced (less negative Emax) towards intracell. Pa. LVX was also affected but to a lesser extent. CST, bacteriostatic against extracell. bacteria, also showed decreased intracellular efficacy. In addition, CST and TOB showed a 6 to 9 fold decrease of relative potency (higher Cstatic) when comparing intracell. and extracell. bacteria. Conclusions: The model shows that, as for other intracell. bacteria, antibiotics are considerably less active and, for 2 classes, less potent, against intracellular forms compared to bacteria in broth, irrespective of their mode of action. This may contribute to the difficulty of eradicating P. aeruginosa in vivo. Objectives: To develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for delafloxacin (DFX) and use that model to estimate pharmacokineticpharmacodynamic (PK-PD) indices in Phase 2 patients treated for complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI). Methods: Data from 3 Phase 1 studies (1 single dose, two multiple dose) and 1 Phase 2, cSSSI study were pooled to develop a population pharmacokinetic model. All doses were administered by IV infusion; doses ranged from 50 to 600 mg. The Phase 2 study employed doses of 300 or 450 mg BID. Intensive PK sampling was employed in all Phase 1 studies while Phase 2 patients contributed 4−5 samples at steady-state over one dosing interval. Population PK modeling was performed using Monte Carlo Parametric Expectation Maximization as implemented in S-ADAPT 1.5.6. Two and 3 compartment models were explored using linear and/or nonlinear elimination. Steady-state AUC and Cmax estimates were calculated using individual PK parameter estimates for Phase 2 patients and indexed to observed pathogen MICs to calculate PK-PD indices. Previous animal studies have indicated that free-drug AUC:MIC ratios (fAUC:MIC) of 9.3 and 14.3 are associated with net bacterial stasis and 1-log10 CFU reduction, respectively, for Staphylococcus aureus. Results: The final analysis dataset included 103 subjects (86 from Phase 1, 17 from Phase 2) and 2273 plasma concentrations. A 2 compartment model with a mix of linear and nonlinear elimination provided the most robust fit to the data (r 2 = 0.965, observed=1.02*fitted − 0.032). All parameters were estimated with excellent precision; interindividual variability in the parameters that define clearance (linear clearance, intrinsic clearance, and Michaelis-Menten constant) ranged from 24−70%. Twelve patients had requisite MIC data to calculate a PK-PD index, all fAUCss:MIC estimates were above 100 (range: 108-3754); all 12 patients were classified as clinical and microbiological cures. The median (min − max) fCmax:MIC ratio was 191 (18.8-565). Seven patients had MRSA as their primary pathogen; MIC values were universally low (0.004-0.06). Conclusions: Development of a population PK model allowed for the estimation of drug exposure in a Phase 2 cSSSI study using relatively sparse PK sampling. Based on PK-PD indices from the Phase 2 study, 300 and 450 mg (BID) clinical doses were appropriate for the treatment of cSSSI. Results also support coverage of MIC values up to 1.0 mcg/mL. O520 Pharmacokinetics and penetration of ciprofloxacin into bronchial secretions of critically ill patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease P. Kontou°, K. Chatzika, G. Pitsiou, A. Boutou, P. Argyropoulou, I. Kioumis (Thessaloniki, GR) Objective: Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is one of the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of severe exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Antibiotic penetration into the site of infection is critical for obtaining an optimal clinical outcome. Since in COPD patients the infection develops within the airway lumen, it is important to know the drug concentrations that are achieved in bronchial secretions (BS). The purpose of this study was to evaluate CIP's pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in plasma and penetration into BS of mechanically ventilated COPD patients, when administered at the currently recommended dose of 1200 mg per day. Methods: Ninenteen critically ill COPD patients received a 1-hour infusion of 400 mg CIP q8 h. They all had a respiratory infection as well as risk factors for Ps. aeruginosa and they were intubated. Serial blood and BS samples were obtained at steady state. Concentrations were determined by a validated HPLC assay. Penetration ratio was calculated by dividing the 24 h area under the curve (AUC 0−24 ) of BS by the AUC 0−24 of plasma. The pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters for CIP were also calculated. Results: Mean±SD values for volume of distribution, clearance, halflife and AUC 0→24 were 174.31±85.42 L, 27.32±9.53 L/h, 5.5±2.34 h and 47.58±18.07, respectively. The mean peak (C max ) and trough levels in plasma were 5.32±1.76 and 1.05±0.59 mg/L respectively. In BS, a mean C max of 3.11±1.27 mg/L was achieved in 3±1.03 hours and the penetration ratio was 1.17±0.61. Thirteen patients demonstrated penetration equal to or even more than 100%. The PD target of AUC 0→24 /MIC 125 in plasma, that has been shown to be predictive of efficacy for Gram-negative infections, was attained in all patients and in the majority of them (74%) at MICs of 0.125 and 0.25 mg/ml respectively but in only 3 patients and in none at higher MICs (0.5 and 1 mg/ml). Slightly better results were obtained for the PD threshold of C max /MIC 10. Conclusions: CIP exhibits excellent penetration into BS. There is wide interindividual variability in its PK parameters in critically ill COPD patients and inadequate PD exposure against bacteria with MICs 0.5 mg/ml. Our data confirm the need for combination therapy against pathogens with high MICs such as Ps. aeruginosa, as well as the institution of therapeutic drug monitoring for individualizing antimicrobial dosing in order to optimize the efficacy of antibiotic therapy in the ICU. So far, we have tested 115 positive BCs. Direct MALDI TOF analysis resulted in 76 (66%) species identifications showing no discrepant results when compared with identification of colonies grown from these BCs. In 9 BCs more than 1 isolate could be grown on plates. Thus, in 73% of monoinfectious BCs MALDI TOF can reveal the etiologic agent in less than 1 h. Conclusion: As compared to conventional procedures the combined use of MALDI-TOF MS and rapid AST may significantly reduce the TAT in diagnosis of blood stream infections.. We identified 29 adults with pneumococcal bacteraemia and obtained clinical details for 28. There were 18 patients for whom PPV is currently recommended. Of these seven (47%) had been immunized, of whom two (29%) died; eight had no history of immunization, of whom two (25%) died. For three cases immunization history was not obtained. The total mortality for this group of 18 was 28%. Pneumococcal serotype results were available for 23 patients. Of these, six patients had received PPV, of whom four (66%) acquired infections with serotypes covered by PPV. Of the ten patients who had not received PPV, nine had serotypes covered by PPV. In total, 5 isolates (22%) were not covered by PPV or PCV7, and 14 isolates (61%) were covered by PPV but not PCV7. The total number of isolates covered by PPV was 18 (78%) ( Table 1) .
