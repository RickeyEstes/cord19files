In this study, when the baggage was opened after interception, animal products were found in all of them, showing that the scanner operator identified animal products in the bags correctly. One hundred ninety-five (195) dairy (milk sweets, liquid milk, milk powder, condensed milk, yoghurt and cheese), 160 meats (ham, bologna, sausage, sausages in general) of cattle, buffalo, goat, chicken, llama, kudu, sheep, pig and unidentified species origins (usually packages in languages not identified by staff such as indigenous dialects), and other products such as honey, eggs and exotic pet products, which totaled 657.4 kg were seized from the passengers in the present study. Significant effects of month, origin, nationality, airport, provenance and age were seen between the two groups of passengers (passengers identified as carrying illegal animal products and control). There were no significant effects for sex. The highest frequencies of passengers bringing food of animal origin were in the months of June, July, August and September (Table 1) , the holiday season in many countries, leading to a greater movement in the airports. Brazilian Central Bank data showed that, in 2011, there was a net increase in international travel expenses of US $ 14.7 billion, generating a 29.5% increase in expenses incurred by Brazilians abroad that effectively reached US $ 21.3 billion. Expenditures made by credit card by Brazilian tourists abroad that reached US $ 12.7 billion (Banco Central do Brasil 2011). This further increases the entry of international products into the Brazilian market. One hundred forty-nine (149) passengers identified as carrying illegal animal products were found in Guarulhos and 111 in Galeão International Airport (p value of χ2 test was 0.0458). The frequency of passengers in this study was higher in Guarulhos, confirming Infraero statistics which recorded, from January to December 2010, a movement of 16,468,645 domestic and 10,380,540 international passengers in Guarulhos. In Galeão, in the same period, there were 9,210,885 domestic and 3,127,059 international passengers (Infraero Empresa Brasileira de Infraestrutura Aeroportuária 2012). The age group most frequently bringing animal products (Table 2 ) was between 35 and 55 (p = 0.0207). The odds ratio comparing this group with all others was 1.64 (Confidence limits 1.12-2.42). This can be attributed in part to financial factors and this age group encompasses those economically active passengers, i.e. that part of the population financially independent and seeks to invest in travel to meet their personal needs. The economically active population comprises skilled manpower from the productive sector. Of a total of 101,110 people interviewed for the Yearbook of the Public System, Work and Income, 58,446 were between 30 to 59 years -the EAP (Economically Active Population) age group (Ministério do Trabalho e Emprego 2012). Shih et al. (2005) studying the transport of products of animal origin evaluated the inspection of international air passengers arriving in Taiwan. Passengers that violated the regulations of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ) were seen to be mainly of Chinese and Southeastern Asian origin and male passengers represented a higher risk than female passengers. In the present study, there was a numerically higher frequency of male passengers in the group of passengers identified as carrying illegal animal products (141) vs 119 females (p-value of χ2 test was p = 0.44). The nationality of the passengers identified as carrying illegal animal products group included those from Brazil, Europe, America, Asia, South America and Africa (Table 3) . Looking at individual countries, the highest frequencies of passengers were from Brazil, China, Portugal, Italy and Argentina. There were significant differences between nationalities (P < 0.0001). There were a large number of different nationalities found in the study, so the observations were divided into regions or continents to facilitate understanding. The area under the ROC curve was 0.6624 for nationality. It was observed that the greatest probability of entry with animal products were primarily from Eastern Europe (Romania and Turkey), followed by Asia and Latin Europe. Brazilians were the largest group of passengers identified as carrying illegal animal products, followed by China, Canada, Italy and Argentina. This may reflect a lack of information about the entry ban into national territory of products from other countries of animal origin, as many people bring these products as a form of remembrance or as a present to loved ones. Probably, a lack of resources prohibits the interception all international flights and inspection all baggage by border staff. The second most frequent country was the China. Portugal and Italy also showed a large movement of people. Many Brazilian descendants of Portuguese origin still travel to Portugal and return to Brazil with, for example, Portuguese Bacalhau (dried salted cod) without a valid animal health certificate. This food, even if certified abroad, cannot enter Brazilian territory without approval of the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply. The point of departure (origin) of the passenger before arriving in Brazil was also important. The passengers identified as carrying illegal animal products group originated mainly in Latin Europe, followed by South America and Asia, (χ2 value 67.0484 and p = 0.0181). The area under the ROC curve was 0.6970, showing the importance of this factor. This large amount of passengers arriving from Latin Europe can be explained by the fact that countries making up this area (Spain, France, Italy, Portugal) have close historical links with Brazil and several countries in South America. This also includes passengers who begin a trip in Europe, but, after arriving in Brazil, they may travel on to other countries of South America, using Brazil as a stopover. There was a higher frequency of passengers identified as carrying illegal animal products from Latin Europe but analyzing countries individually, Argentina was the most frequent. The fact that most passengers identified as carrying illegal animal products took the plane to Brazil from Portugal and Argentina is understandable if one analyses Brazil's relationship with these countries. Portugal has a historical relationship with Brazil. Brazilians and Portuguese also have benefits and facilities in each other's country (in terms of travel permits, residence etc.), reflected by investments in these countries, a common language favoring cultural exchange and privileged access to airlines, including direct flights.
