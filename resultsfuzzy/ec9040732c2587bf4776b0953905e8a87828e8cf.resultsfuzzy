89 papers were short-listed for more comprehensive examination from the original list of 534 ( Figure   2 ) of which seven studies were critically appraised for methodological quality and subsequently included in the review (Table 13) . Reasons for exclusion are outlined in Appendix V and include papers which were: review articles which did not present any data on interventions, prevalence surveys, risk factor studies, and clinical and outbreak reports. Two studies were outbreak reports of the Malaysian outbreak epidemic 29, 30 and present an epidemic curve of the number of human cases by the date of onset of their illness. Four studies also discussed the National Swine Surveillance Program and subsequent control measures initiated by the Malaysian Government in response to the outbreak. 26, 36, 37, 40 In the final study, 25 authors discuss an active surveillance initiative for the detection of Nipah virus infected swine in Indonesia. The original searches retrieved 1302 potentially relevant articles. This included 15 systematic reviews which were identified during this stage and the reference lists for these were examined for additional references. From this list, 118 papers were short-listed for more comprehensive examination. 87 articles were rejected after perusal of the abstract and full text. Reasons for exclusion are outlined in Appendix V and include papers based on: cross-sectional surveys or reports of surveillance activity with no intervention, narrative reviews with no original data and model-based studies. Thirty-five papers were critically appraised for methodological quality and based on these, 31 papers were included in the review ( Figure 2 ). The studies were categorised by country, urban/rural setting and type of intervention to facilitate analysis. Characteristics of the included studies are detailed in Appendix IV (Table 17 to Table 20) . Six studies evaluated the effectiveness of community-based surveillance programs for dengue. These studies came from different countries (Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Malaysia). 28, 31, 32, 38, 39, 41 Two studies evaluated established national level systems, 28, 32 whilst the remaining four were evaluations of novel or improved systems undertaken at a more local/regional level. 31, 38, 39, 41 Twenty-six studies report on 28 evaluations of dengue prevention and control activities. Much of the evidence for community based dengue interventions comes from studies undertaken in Thailand 47, 49, 58, 64-66, 71, 72, 74, 76, 79 (n=11) and Viet Nam 38, 52, 53, [55] [56] [57] 61, 62 (n=8) . Within these countries, studies have been undertaken in a wide range of regions so evidence is available from northern, central and southern provinces. The remaining studies were undertaken in Singapore 44 (n=1), Malaysia 48 (n=1), Myanmar 76 (n=1), Cambodia 69 (n=1), the Philippines 59, 76 (n=2) and Indonesia 45, 70, 77 (n=3) . Three studies evaluated community dengue health education and disease awareness campaigns. 45, 64, 74 A further thirteen studies 44, 47, 49, 55-57, 61, 62, 66, 69-72 used educational components in conjunction with a combination of environmental, biological and occasionally chemical vector control. Five studies 48, 52, 70, 71, 77 evaluated environmental control strategies (including use of screens, covering of water containers, and community clean up to reduce larval breeding sites), the majority included an educational component. A further eleven studies 44, 49, 55-59, 61, 62, 66, 72 included environmental control activities alongside chemical or biological control interventions. Seven studies 55-58, 61, 62, 65 looked at biological vector control strategies (including introduction of either copepods or other biological control agents to water containers); in all studies this was in combination with dengue education and environmental control activities. Eleven studies 38, 44, 47, 49, 53, 59, 66, 69, 72, 76, 79 looked at chemical vector control strategies (including larvicide/insecticide distribution and fogging), either in isolation or occasionally combined with either dengue education or environmental control activities. The results of the meta-analysis showed that overall, the interventions included in this review were able to show a statistically significant impact on larval indices; including approximately an 80% reduction in the proportion of positive households, approximately a 60% reduction in the proportion of containers positive for Aedes aegypti larvae and approximately a 60% reduction in the Breteau index, when results are pooled across type of intervention. Although we anticipated being able to draw indirect comparisons of effectiveness between intervention types, the small number of studies for any one intervention type precluded formal sub-analyses to look at relative effectiveness. However, a narrative interpretation of the forest plots shows no trend in levels of effectiveness by type of intervention, country, urban versus rural context or study size. Two studies 48, 59 showed inconsistent results (an increase in larval indices as opposed to a decrease), but this difference does not appear related to the type of intervention. The study by Crabtree et al. 48 trialled an environmental cleanup intervention; it is a low quality study that is weakened by its inappropriate choice of control area (the mosquito vector was not present in the control area at baseline). The study by Madarieta et al. 59 was a small, short, low quality trial of insecticide impregnated bednets. A feature common to both studies that may partially explain their contradictory findings is that each reported problems with the sustainability of the intervention. After 6 months, 52% of nets were no longer in use and 60% of nets in use had been washed (reducing their insecticidal properties). At the end of the environmental cleanup study, the authors report ongoing waste management issues, and a failure to alter ingrained attitudes that the government should address these issues, rather than seeing them as a community responsibility. The search strategy identified 854 potentially relevant titles, of which 110 were shortlisted (Figure 2 ), based on details in the title and abstract. 96 original references were excluded (reasons are given) in Appendix V and papers which were outbreak reports with no data included on interventions, narrative reviews with no original data, cross-sectional KAP surveys and model-based studies. Nine systematic reviews that were identified were also excluded, as these focused on either a geographical region outside of the scope of this review(either China, Hong Kong and/or North America) , the use of pharmaceutical or clinical interventions (vaccines and lab assays for clinical diagnosis), or the prevention of nosocomial (as opposed to community) transmission. Full text of twenty studies was retrieved, of which five studies were critically appraised and subsequently included in the review (Table ) . Four of the five were from Singapore 34, 51, 63, 73 with the remaining study originating from Viet Nam 75 . Unlike Nipah virus infection, where, to date, the outbreak in 1999 has been an isolated event in SE Asian countries, several outbreaks of avian influenza have been recorded in a number of SE Asian countries from 2004 to 2008. In line with our inclusion criteria, outbreak control measures for each country-specific outbreak were included as long as they had a significant component of community involvement and engagement, even if in concert with -top-downâ€– government-driven initiatives. The search identified 737 potentially relevant titles, of which 107 papers were short-listed for comprehensive examination ( Figure 2 ). Of these, eleven studies were critically appraised and nine studies were subsequently included in the review (Table32). Reasons for exclusion are outlined in Appendix V, and include papers based on: outbreak reports with no data on interventions, narrative reviews with no original data, risk factor analyses, model-based studies and cross-sectional KAP and prevalence surveys.
