Our laboratory policy as well as recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization for a positive test result include the following: for a positive RT-PCR result, repeat the test using a second aliquot of the original specimen, and if positive, confirm the result by sending the specimen to a reference laboratory; or test the positive specimen by a second RT-PCR test targeting a different part of the genome, and if positive, confirm by a reference laboratory (www.cdc. gov/ncidod/sars/guidance/f/pdf/app2.pdf). False-positive specimens can occur with poorly designed primers or, alternatively, with specimens collected from a low prevalence population (specificity decreases as prevalence of infection decreases) or if laboratory testing is performed improperly. A negative RT-PCR test on an NP specimen from a suspected SARS patient does not rule out SARS because SARS-CoV is present in low levels in the upper respiratory tract in the first week of infection. A negative result from an infected patient could be due to the presence of PCR inhibitors that co-purify with RNA, a poor quality specimen, or a specimen lacking virus. Because the level of viral RNA in the NP and stool rises in the second week of illness, a follow-up NP and/or fecal specimen should be collected and tested by PCR. Negative PCR results for specimens from the upper respiratory tract could trigger sampling from the lower respiratory tract where the titers of virus are higher, although collection of these invasive specimens are associated with an increased risk of medical staff infection. Detection of SARS-CoV in plasma or peripheral leukocytes should be considered because this approach provides sensitivities of Ï³80% during the first week of illness. The use of multiple, serial respiratory tract and fecal specimens will improve the sensitivity of PCR diagnostic testing especially when a larger volume of the sample is extracted and a larger proportion of the sample RNA is used for amplification. 20, 32 The first generation of commercially available PCR assays for SARS may have suboptimal sensitivity and should not be used alone without sending parallel specimens to an experienced reference laboratory for testing. Recognizing that the first human infections were caused by a zoonotic virus that adapted to its new human host and that mankind faces the continuing possibility for the introduction of new variants of animal SARS-associated viruses, greater vigilance will be required to make a diagnosis of infection if new animal CoVs are introduced into the human population. The use of RT-PCR assays using consensus primers and sequencing that can detect all known CoVs would be recommended in this scenario.
