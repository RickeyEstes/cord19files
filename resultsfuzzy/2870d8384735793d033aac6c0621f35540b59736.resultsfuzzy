The study investigated the gastrointestinal virome of the bat genus Neoromicia, as viruses excreted in fecal material or present in these tissues (rectum and intestine) pose a greater risk of coming into contact with other animals. Neoromicia species do not roost in caves where they can be readily caught and sampled [21] . Instead, most individuals were caught in flight away from their roosts, and therefore fewer individuals were available to investigate. The samples utilized in this study were processed with methods similar to those that have proven to be successful in bat virome analyses-with enrichment methods for conserving viral particles and reducing sequencing of host and non-viral nucleic acids [11, 15, 17, 56] . Furthermore, an additional host ribosomal RNA depletion step was incorporated to simplify bioinformatics analysis. Prepared Illumina libraries were sequenced on the MiSeq platform as an initial examination, followed by sequencing on the NextSeq500. Combined data outputs produced 37 million reads of which 34.8 million remained after quality and adaptor trimming with an inhouse developed workflow in CLC Genomics Workbench ( Fig 2B) . As no Neoromicia host genomes are available for sequence removal, the genome of Myotis brandtii, another species within the family Vespertilionidae, was utilized. Despite enrichment efforts, application of strict mapping parameters within the CLC workflow removed nearly 40% of reads as host ( Fig 2B) . Before assembly into contigs, reads data were analysed for sequence similarity by BLASTn against the nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Of the remaining 21.2 million reads, 14% were attributed to cellular organisms (host and nonviral microbial reads), with less than 1% designated as viral in origin; which is comparable to other virome studies [15, 18] . As with most metagenomic studies performed to date, the largest portion of reads (85%) were assigned as 'non-hits' by BLASTn analyses, as they did not match any available sequence data in the NCBI database [11, 56] . Reads were assembled into contigs using CLC Genomics Workbench and Velvet assembler, and combined for the best results; often producing overlapping contigs. Depending on specific inputs (e.g. varying kmer lengths), the number of contigs ranged from 222,343 to 566,951. Superior contig lengths were more frequently found from CLC assemblies than those from multiple Velvet configurations with different kmer lengths. Again, less than 1% of all contigs were assigned as viral with BLASTn analyses. Contigs and unassembled reads assigned to specific virus families from BLAST outputs were inspected manually before being considered as valid ( Fig 2C) . Many of the assignments were deemed as false positives due to poor e-values, low complexity sequences (such as repeat runs of nucleotides) or having greater similarity matches to host/mammalian sequences [57] . Reads and contigs (e.g rhabdoviruses, orthomyxoviruses and caliciviruses) identified as such were discarded from further analyses ( Fig  2C) . Despite a low percentage of viral reads, sequence data from eight mammalian-infecting virus families were detected, including the Adenoviridae, Circoviridae, Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae, Parvoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Picornaviridae and Phenuiviridae. In agreement with other virome investigations, many of detected sequences shared low genetic similarities to known viruses due to a lack of available sequence diversity for comparison [11, 14] . This lack of available sequence data may only be overcome by further reports documenting the viral diversity of bats as well as other hosts. Though non-mammalian infecting viruses (phages and insect viruses) were identified, they were outside the scope of the study and not investigated any further.
