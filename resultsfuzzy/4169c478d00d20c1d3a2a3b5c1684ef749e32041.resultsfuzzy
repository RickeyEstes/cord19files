All validation and verification studies of the new FI-nvCT assay were conducted according to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standard protocols used for in vitro diagnostic assay validation [6] . The cut-off value of the test (100,000 RLU) was initially established by testing 454 de-identified remnant clinical specimens obtained from a large reference laboratory in the US. The collection consisted of 266 specimens (endocervical and vaginal swabs, male and female urine, PreservCyt ThinPrep liquid cytology) positive for C. trachomatis by the AC2 assay, and 188 specimens (mixed types) that were AC2-negative ( Figure 1 ). Signal-to-cut-off (S/CO) ratio values for all clinical specimens tested ranged from 0 to 0.45. Mean S/CO ratio values ranged from 0.02 to 0.071 for C. trachomatis C1515-positive (wild type) specimens, and equalled 0.046 for specimens negative for C. trachomatis. Negative controls included in this analysis (n = 6), consisting of 10,000 copies/mL of wild type (C1515) C. trachomatis RNA, yielded S/CO ratio values ranging from 0.016 to 0.112 (mean: 0.044); positive controls (n = 6) consisting of 1,000 copies/mL of IVT RNA corresponding to FI-nvCT (C1515T) rRNA yielded S/ CO ratio values ranging from 3.60 to 9.02 (mean: 6.38) (data not shown). The analytical sensitivity of the new Aptima-format FI-nvCT surveillance assay for detecting in vitro transcript (IVT) RNA containing the C. trachomatis 23S rRNA C1515T mutation using the 100,000 RLU cut-off was established by Probit analysis of a panel of six positive and one negative FI-nvCT RNA samples (n = 20 replicates each panel member) ( Figure 2 ). This analysis established the 95% limit of detection (LOD) for the assay is 231 copies/mL in Aptima sample transport medium and 210 copies/mL in urine sample matrix, equivalent to ca 0.072 infectious units per mL (IFU/mL) and 0.065 IFU/mL, respectively (copies to IFU conversion data not shown). Analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) and interference (spike and recovery) of the assay against nontarget organisms potentially encountered in urogenital or extra-genital specimens was assessed by testing a minimum of ten replicates of each of 22 pools consisting of 3 to 4 organisms per pool, encompassing 59 bacterial, 2 yeast, 4 protozoal and 19 viral species at high titre ( Table 1 ). All non-target organisms tested yielded negative results in the assay. To assess nontarget organism interference, 23S rRNA C1515T IVT RNA was spiked to a concentration of three times the assay 95% LOD (660 copies/mL) and tested in the presence of the same high titre pools. All results were positive for the 23S rRNA C1515T-spiked specimens (Table 1) except for Panel 20, which was 95% positive. In addition, culture isolates of C. trachomatis serotypes A, B, Ba, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L1, L2 and L3 (all containing the wild type base C1515 in the 23S rRNA) were tested at 1x10 5 IFU/mL each (except serotype G, which was tested at 3x10 4 IFU/mL). All serotypes tested (n = 5 replicates each) yielded negative results in the assay with S/CO ratio values ranging from 0.129 to 0.248 (data not shown).
