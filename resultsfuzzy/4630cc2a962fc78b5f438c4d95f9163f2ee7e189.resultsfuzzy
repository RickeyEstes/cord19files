cDNA library construction and screening Screening of 1536 different samples led to 192 clones being sequenced due to their fluorescence intensity. Within this group nine genes encoding proteins with immunogenic potential were revealed. In spite of that, numerous sequenced clones displayed only gene fragments ranging from 45 to 444 bp resulting in poor and ambiguous identification after BLAST analysis. This might have been caused by the excessive degradation of RNA prior to cDNA synthesis as attributed by a RNA integrity number (RIN) of 2.6. Although comparative studies have shown the RNA isolation method used to be reliable [20] , it may have been a source for degradation. Still, this has been a proven method in revealing immunogenic proteins from pathogens and extracting RNA with high quality [11] . Although, cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification may have assisted in creating short fragments, the approach presented herein was specifically selected due to its ability to generate full-length [21] and high quality cDNA [22] . Nevertheless, normalization of cDNA prior to cloning was successful. Duplex-specific nuclease digests solely double-stranded DNA and has been used for normalization of cDNA prior to RNAseq [23] . This is a mandatory step to reduce the highly abundant rRNA, which encompasses more than 95 % of a total RNA extraction. As no distinct band of 3,000 bp, representing cDNA derived from 23S rRNA, is visible after gel electrophoresis, the cDNA was effectively normalized. Rather, a homogeneous smear, representing cDNA molecules of different sizes, was detected. Contrary to eukaryotic mRNA harboring a poly(A) tail, prokaryotic mRNA lacks this feature and thus cannot be directly reverse transcribed using oligo(dT) primers. However, as the applied cDNA synthesis demanded the presence of a poly(A) tail, the total RNA had to be polyadenylated prior to first-strand synthesis. After normalization, cloning commenced by introducing the inserts into linearized vector using ligation-independent-cloning (LIC) [24] . The LIC is a powerful tool in contrast to original cloning methods based upon ligase and restriction endonucleases, which often suffer from low efficiencies [25] caused mainly by short overhangs leading to nonspecific interactions and advocating religation of the vector. In contrast, LIC guarantees directional cloning at any desired site with high efficiency. Furthermore, the proteins of interest were expressed as fusion constructs harboring an N-terminal HaloTag®. This enabled covalent, irreversible binding to the microarray surface in a highly specific manner. Thus, purification was obsolete and cross-reactivity reduced to a minimum [14] . Commonly, microarray-based immunoscreenings offer high throughput of samples as Zhu, et al., 2006 [26] have shown. However, most methods incorporate time-consuming and costly purification steps prior to spotting purified target protein to nitrocellulose microarrays. The combination of highthroughput microarray-based immunoscreenings and the easy handling of the HaloTag® system warrants a fast identification of immunogenic proteins [14] . Consequently, the immunoscreenings of 1536 proteins are completed within a few hours. Table 1 summarizes the nine protein candidates identified via microarray screening. The proteins encompass a highly conserved DNA primase that shows homology in all bacteria. Moreover, two hypothetical proteins (SEN1186 and SEN2464) were detected with no known function rendering these candidates highly attractive for further investigations. SEN2464 is additionally described as a methionine tRNA cytidine acetyltransferase providing precise recognition of the AUG codon for elongation-specific methionine tRNA [27] . For SEN4030, a large repetitive protein with 5559 amino acid residues, no function is known; however, it shows high similarity to SiiE of S. Typhimurium. SiiE is a giant nonfimbrial adhesin that facilitates initial interaction to the intestinal epithelium [28] . SEN4030 and the putative isomerase (SEN1504) are conserved in Salmonella [27] . Membraneassociation is another intriguing feature as it enhances the protein's accessibility in a diagnostic assay. This is true for the ais protein (SEN2278), the multidrug resistance protein A (SEN2659) and the membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase A precursor (SEN2832). The ais protein is a lipopolysaccharide core heptose(II)-phosphate phosphatase catalyzing the dephosphorylation of heptose(II) of the outer membrane lipopolysaccharide core. On top of that, it has just recently been identified as a virulence factor contributing to enteric infection [29] . Last but not least, SEN1186 is a DNA mismatch endonuclease located in the cytoplasm.
