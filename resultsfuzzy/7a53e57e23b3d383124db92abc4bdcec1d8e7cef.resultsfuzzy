The PLW fields around the three building models; S1, S2, and S3, under the influence of the two twisted wind flows (TWP13 and TWP22) are simulated using OpenFOAM and FLUENT. In addition, a conventional wind profile, which is hereafter referred to as CWP, is adopted to conduct the CFD simulation as the control case. The CWP profile has similar wind speeds and turbulence intensities as the profiles of TWP13 Fig. 7(a) . The heights of cells close to the ground, on the other hand, are reduced (shown in Fig. 7(b) ) to ensure that there are more than 5 layers of cells within pedestrian level [45] , which is 0.01m for the simulations reported in the present study. The height of cells increases along the height of the building model and reduces when approaching the building top. The height of cells near the ground and close to the building top is around mm 0.1 , which makes the total number of cells exceeding 0.9 million for both OpenFOAM and FLUENT simulations. The boundary conditions used to run the simulations are identical to the cases with the empty domain, which have been summarized in Table 1 . The QUICK scheme [46] is used to discretize the momentum equation in both OpenFOAM and FLUENT simulation, and the SIMPLE algorithm [47] is employed to solve the governing equations. The simulations are kept for 12000 iterations to ensure that the converged results are obtained. The simulated wind velocity at the pedestrian level along the lines laterally penetrating the computational domain ( = âˆ’ X m m 225 and = X m m 225 ) are monitored through the simulation process, and the fluctuations in the simulated wind velocities on the monitor during the last 2000 iterations for the OpenFOAM and FLUENT simulations are under the levels of 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively, which substantiated that the converged results are obtained.
