Healthy controls had serum neutralizing antibody GMT of 173.5 for RSV/A and171.7 for RSV/B, while the GMTs for women with PCR-confirmed RSV were 245.1 and 234.8, respectively. The two women with PCR-confirmed RSV who were enrolled on days 9 and 25 (Table 4) The geometric mean of PLA concentration of healthy controls (6.4 mg/mL) was similar to that of women with PCR-confirmed RSV (5.8 mg/mL). However, those two individuals with PCRconfirmed RSV infection who were enrolled later in their illness (days 9 and 25) had comparatively greater levels of PLA, 25.3 lg/mL and 10.5 lg/mL respectively.
