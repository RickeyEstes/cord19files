Except for cat #9QJ, five of six rHuG-CSF-treated cats had a significant increase in the average WBC counts during treatment compared to the baseline ( Fig. 2A) . These cats exhibited elevated WBC counts of at least 10,000 neutrophils/ml increase over baseline values that peaked on treatment days 4, 11, 14, and 18. Moreover, the WBC counts in the six rHuG-CSFtreated cats were statistically higher than those in the placebo group on treatment days 4, 11, 14, and 18 ( Fig. 2A and B ). In addition, the rHuG-CSF-treated group had significantly higher average WBC counts on treatment days 11-18 than the average baseline (day 0) WBC counts. The neutrophil counts of the rHuG-CSF-treated group showed a similar trend as that observed with the WBC counts over the course of study (Figs. 2C  and 3) . The five rHuG-CSF-treated cats, which had statistically significant increase in WBC counts, Fig. 2 . WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and monocyte counts of FIV-infected cats undergoing rHuG-CSF treatment. The arrow bar represents time of treatment in days. Statistically significant differences demonstrated between rHuG-CSF treatment group and placebo group from the same time point are shown as (*) and between post-treatment and pre-treatment values of the rHuG-CSF treatment group are shown as ( ** ). Statistically significant differences established by both comparisons (treated group vs. placebo group; post-treatment vs. pre-treatment) are shown as ( ). also had significant increases in neutrophil counts (i.e., at least 10,000 neutrophils/ml increase). Statistically significant increases in the average neutrophil counts of the rHuG-CSF-treated versus placebo groups were observed on treatment days 4, 11, and 18 ( Fig. 2C and D) . Similar to the WBC counts, the average neutrophil counts were significantly higher in the rHuG-CSF-treated group on treatment days 4, 11, 14, and 18 when compared to the average baseline (day 0) counts. In contrast, WBC and neutrophil counts remained relatively stable in the placebo group, with the exception of cat #9QI in part 1 on treatment day 7 ( Fig. 2B and D) . As described before, cat #9QI received prednisolone throughout part 1, except for placebo treatment days 1, and 4-6, which coincides with the increases in both WBC and neutrophil counts on treatment day 7. However, in part 2, the increases in WBC counts in this cat during the rHuG-CSF treatment were not affected by the prednisolone given to the cat throughout this study. No statistically significant increases in the lymphocyte counts were observed in rHuG-CSFtreated cats when compared to the placebo controls and when compared to the baseline pre-treatment values on day 0 ( Fig. 2E and F) . Eosinophil counts were highly variable in both treatment groups, although not significantly different when compared to either their baseline pre-treatment values on day 0 or to the placebo groups, except on treatment day 18 ( Fig. 2G and H) . Although monocyte counts were highly variable between cats, there appeared to be more pronounced elevation of monocyte counts in the rHuG-CSF-treated cats compared to placebo controls ( Fig. 2I and J) . However, no statistically significant increases in monocyte counts were observed in the rHuG-CSF-treated group when compared to either the placebo controls or their baseline values on day 0. Furthermore, the monocyte counts of the placebo-treated group had no significant increases throughout the study. Other hematological parameters, such as RBC, hemoglobin, platelet, and hematocrit were not affected by rHuG-CSF treatment (data not shown).
