The top 70 of the 2189 BBE cell responses to co-exposure with BHV-1 and M. haemolytica (Fig. 1) are indicated in Supplemental Table 3 . Co-exposure to BHV-1 and M. haemolytica induced substantial changes (p < 0.05) in expression of NOS2A (120-fold), IL6 (>100-fold), IL1A (>90fold), and CXCL2 (>40-fold); 30-fold or greater increases in CSF3, IL8, CCL5, and SERPINB2; and >20-fold increases in CXCL1, PTGS2, and SELE. Functional analysis of these top 70 genes in the DAVID bioinformatics tool revealed 53 annotated bovine IDs. Gene profiling of the 53 annotated DAVID IDs shows significant enrichment of genes involved in cytokine activity (10/53), glycoproteins (21/53), secreted proteins (18/53), disulfide bonds (22/53), signal transduction (20/53), and inflammatory response (6/53). Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j. vetimm.2013.06.012. Analysis of gene expression profiles (by multivariate pairwise correlation analysis) indicated a strong correlation between genes expressed in BBE cells treated with M. haemolytica alone and cells co-infected with M. haemolytica and BHV-1. A weak correlation was shown between BBE cells treated with BHV-1 alone and those co-infected with BHV-1 and M. haemolytica (Fig. 2) . Overall analysis of genes indicated significantly increased gene expression in the BHV-1 and M. haemolytica co-infected group, suggesting some synergism between BHV-1 and M. haemolytica (Fig. 3) . Scatter plot matrix analysis of a selected group of highly expressed genes, however, failed to demonstrate a clear synergism for BBE Fig. 3 . One-way analysis of BBE cell gene responses elicited by BHV-1, MH or BHV-1 + MH. Total significant bovine genes responding to BHV-1, MH or BHV-1 + MH were analyzed and presented as a mean log ratio of test/control. The mean log ratio for (BHV-1 + MH), 0.023227 is greater than the sum of individual log mean ratios for MH and BHV-1, (0.009041 + 0.011703). As a result these data suggest a synergistic effect of BHV-1 and MH. cells co-infected with BHV-1 and M. haemolytica versus either pathogen alone (Fig. 4) .
