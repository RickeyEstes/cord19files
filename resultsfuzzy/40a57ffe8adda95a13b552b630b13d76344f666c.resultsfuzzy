Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has had devastating impacts to the swine industry as it spread throughout the U.S. Identification of feed related vectors for transmission has led to increased research to identify methods of PEDV-mitigation in finished feeds and feed ingredients. However, monitoring and elimination of PEDV within animal feed manufacturing facilities has received little attention from researchers. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the presence of PEDV within an animal feed manufacturing facility during the manufacture of a swine diet artificially inoculated with PEDV and the subsequent decontamination of the facility. Prior to the beginning of each replicate, subsamples of the feed to be used were evaluated for PEDV RNA. As expected all feed was negative, with no detectable PEDV RNA found via RT-qPCR analysis. In addition, all baseline swabs collected during each replication were negative for PEDV. After the introduction of PEDV-inoculum to the feed in each replicate run, three subsamples of inoculated feed were collected and evaluated for PEDV RNA by RT-qPCR. The PEDV cell culture had Ct values of 16.7, 15.9, and 16.2 for replicates 1, 2, and 3, respectively. While the PEDV-inoculated feed contained average Ct values of 32.6, 31.4, and 32.2 for replicates 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This is consistent with previously observed PEDV contaminated feed [13] . Infectivity of the feed was further confirmed by bioassay in 10 d old pigs. As previously mentioned, all collected environmental swabs were categorized by decontamination step, surface collected from (concrete, metal, plastic, or rubber), surface type (equipment or structural) and zone (1, 2, or 3), with results reported as number of positive samples out of total samples collected ( Table 2 ). As previously described by Huss et al. [10] , zones were categorized based on proximity to feed contact surfaces, with zone 1 including direct feed contact surfaces; zone 2 included surfaces immediately adjacent to direct contact surfaces (exteriors of equipment, conveyor housing, etc.); zone 3 included non-feed contact surfaces outside of zone 1 and 2 but within the FSRC (floors, walls, drains, etc.). The main effects of decontamination step, surface (concrete, metal, plastic, or rubber), type (equipment or structural), and zone (1, 2, or 3) are shown in Table 3 . All main effects and interactions were found to be significant (P < 0.05). The percent contamination of PEDV after each step of the decontamination protocol are shown in Fig 1, and illustrates the increase in PEDV genetic material found throughout the facility after production of contaminated feed. All baseline samples collected contained no detectable PEDV, which increased to 192 of 198 (97.0%) samples positive for PEDV RNA after production of the contaminated feed (Fig 1) . Following cleaning with the ammonium-glutaraldehyde blend 36 of 150 (24.0%) of the collected samples were positive for PEDV RNA (Fig 1) . This was further reduced to 14 of 150 collected samples positive after sanitization with the sodium hypochlorite solution (Fig 1) . Following facility heat-up to 60˚C for 48 hours, 6 of 157 (3.8%) of the collected samples were positive for PEDV RNA (Fig 1) . It is important to note that all 6 of the positive samples found after heat-up were from replication 2. Due to these results, the decontamination process was repeated (cleaning with the ammonium-glutaraldehyde blend, followed by sanitization with a sodium hypochlorite solution and facility heat-up to 60˚C for 48 hours) and the collection of additional swabs. All swabs collected after the repeat decontamination were negative for PEDV RNA. Overall the efficacy of the chemical disinfection and heat to decontaminate the facility were consistent with previous research done for decontamination of animal transport vehicles [14] . Main effect of decontamination step on incidence of sample contamination with PEDV (P < 0.0001; SEM = ±1.21). The 5 evaluated decontamination steps were: 1) baseline prior to inoculation, 2) after feed production, 3) chemical cleaning with a quaternary ammonium-glutaraldehyde blend, 4) chemical cleaning with sodium hypochlorite, and 5) facility heat-up to 60˚C 48 hours. Note: Positive swabs were obtained after decontamination during replication 2, therefore decontamination was repeated with subsequent swabs collected and found negative. The percent contamination of PEDV on each surface type (concrete, metal, plastic, or rubber) from baseline to the final decontamination step is shown in Fig 2. As stated previously, the surface main effect was significant (P = 0.0018; Table 3 ). Plastic and rubber surfaces were not significantly different from each other, but were both significantly different from concrete and metal surfaces. Additionally, concrete and metal surfaces were not significantly different from each other. The differences between the plastic and rubber vs concrete and metal surfaces could be attributed the specific characteristics of each surface type. Specifically, the plastic and rubber surfaces were smoother compared to the concrete and metal surfaces. Both the concrete and metal surfaces were rough, with concrete also being porous and metal being pitted from use. The smooth attributes of the plastic and rubber surfaces are conducive to decontamination. Interactive effect of decontamination step × surface (concrete, metal, plastic, and rubber) on incidence of sample contamination with PEDV (P < 0.0018; SEM for concrete, metal, plastic and rubber = ±2.05, ±1.14, ±2.91, and ±2.39, respectively). The 5 evaluated decontamination steps were: 1) baseline prior to inoculation, 2) after feed production, 3) chemical cleaning with a quaternary ammonium-glutaraldehyde blend, 4) chemical cleaning with sodium hypochlorite, and 5) facility heat-up to 60˚C 48 hours. Note: Positive swabs were obtained after Compared sampled collected at each of the 5 decontamination steps, including: 1) baseline measurements prior to inoculation, 2) immediately after feed manufacturing production, 3) chemical cleaning using a quaternary ammonium-glutaraldehyde blend, 4) chemical cleaning using sodium hypochlorite, and 5) facility heat-up to 60˚C for 48 hours. b Compared samples collected on concrete, metal, plastic, or rubber. c Compared samples collected on surfaces that were from equipment or structural. decontamination during replication 2, therefore decontamination was repeated with subsequent swabs collected and found negative. The same trend of high contamination after production and subsequent reduction during decontamination was observed in samples collected from the two different surface types (equipment or structural), as shown in Fig 3. All swabs collected from equipment surfaces contained PEDV RNA after processing of the contaminated feed. The quantity of viral RNA between the equipment and structural swabs was statistically different, with greater contamination found in equipment swabs (P < 0.05). This was expected due to the equipment being in direct contact with the contaminated feed. The majority of collected structural swabs were also positive, but remained less than those collected from equipment throughout the experiment. This was also as expected as structural swabs did not have direct contact with the contaminated feed. It is important to note the extent of contamination of structural surfaces, thus emphasizing the important role dust particles may play in the spread of biological hazards throughout a feed manufacturing facility. These results are congruent with previous research implementing dust in the spread of bacterial biological hazards within a feed manufacturing facility [8, 10] . To our knowledge this is the first report to describe the spread of a viral pathogen through the environment of a feed production facility. Interactive effect of decontamination step × type (equipment or structural) on incidence of sample contamination with PEDV (P < 0.001; SEM for equipment and structural = ±1.12 and ±1.50, respectively). The 5 evaluated decontamination steps were: 1) baseline prior to inoculation, 2) after feed production, 3) chemical cleaning with a quaternary ammonium-glutaraldehyde blend, 4) chemical cleaning with sodium hypochlorite, and 5) facility heat-up to 60˚C 48 hours. Note: Positive swabs were obtained after decontamination during replication 2, therefore decontamination was repeated with subsequent swabs collected and found negative. Again, the same overall trend was observed when looking at swabs collected from the different zones (1, 2, or 3), as shown in Fig 4. Zones 1 and 2 had the highest amount of contamination compared to zone 3, as they were in direct or adjacent contact with the contaminated feed. Significantly less contamination was seen in zone 3 (vs zones 1 and 2; P < 0.05), as expected due to the proximity to the contaminated feed. However, as seen with the facility swabs, dust generated during processing of contaminated feed can lead to contamination of previously uncontaminated surfaces. This is consistent with data indicating that aerosolized dust can be a transmission vector [15] . This previous work indicates that the PEDV particles can be attached to dust. Based on our results this suggests that contaminated dust may be circulated throughout the manufacturing facility. Interactive effect of decontamination step × zone (1, 2, and 3) on incidence of sample contamination with PEDV (P < 0.0001; SEM for zone 1, 2 and 3 = ±1.20, ±2.99, and ±1.38, respectively). The 5 evaluated decontamination steps were: 1) baseline prior to inoculation, 2) after feed production, 3) chemical cleaning with a quaternary ammonium-glutaraldehyde blend, 4) chemical cleaning with sodium hypochlorite, and 5) facility heat-up to 60˚C 48 hours. Note: Positive swabs were obtained after decontamination during replication 2, therefore decontamination was repeated with subsequent swabs collected and found negative. These findings are important to illustrate that wet chemical cleaning greatly reduced the sample positive rates then followed by facility heating were effective measures to reduce PEDV in feed manufacturing facilities and equipment. These are consistent with protocols to document disinfection of pig transport vehicles [14] . Although effective, the wet chemical cleaning and facility heating are impractical on a large-scale basis for feed manufacturing facilities. These findings may provide solutions for biological hazard reduction on specific equipment or problem areas. It is also important to note the importance of equipment cleaning, as positive swabs were found after the final decontamination step (during replication 2, as stated previously).
