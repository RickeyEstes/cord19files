Detailed results from the simulations are provided in the supplement and are displayed in S1 and S2 Fig. and S1 -S12 Tables in S2 Appendix, and in S1 Appendix. In general, our simulations show that our approach provides good estimation ofR 0 andm when we include contact tracing data that is in agreement with the outbreak data, regardless of the outbreak size. However, the estimates for the reproductive number were affected by the number of observed generations of transmission. When outbreak sizes were small and reproductive numbers were large we observed short epidemic lengths, such as when N = 50 and R 0 = 6 we only observe epidemic lengths of four to five days for an SI with maximum length five. We see for some scenarios with R 0 = 6, thatR 0 is slightly underestimated, which is likely due to the limited number of observed generations of transmission and limited total outbreak lengths (see Table 2 ). There were inconsistent results when using a misspecified prior based on biased contact tracing data. When informing the prior with a contact tracing sample that had a total number of observed SIs equaling more than 4% of the total outbreak size, the estimates were biased (i.e. simulations with N = 50 and N = 200). Because we will never know if the contact tracing data is in agreement with the epidemic curve, it is important to not weight the SI prior to be more than 4% of the total outbreak size. In general, if enough generations of transmission are observed, the prior weight has less impact; however, if the total epidemic length is relatively short and few generations of transmission have been observed, then a smaller weight of 1-2% may be more appropriate. The comparison of the models with varying values of k, using uniform SI priors, shows that the DIC selects the model with k = 5 most often. To summarize the simulations with the DIC, the minimum DIC was calculated across models and then the frequency that each model was selected is depicted in Fig. 3 . Models with larger ks were sometimes selected; however, the differences between the DICs were small in these instances. The ranges of epidemic curve lengths for the two scenarios that were considered are 25-123 days (N = 500) and 21-96 days (N = 200). Some outbreak lengths are small relative to the largest maximum SI length (k = 20) that was considered, which could affect the estimates. However, we did observe that the DIC is a useful model selection tool. Simulation Conclusions. When contact tracing samples are available this data should be used to inform the SI prior distribution. Careful thought should be given to the size of the prior relative to the total outbreak size and length. For smaller outbreaks it is especially important to make sure that the contact tracing sample size is not too large, which could potentially bias the estimates. If enough generations of transmission have been observed to properly estimate a SI of a given maximum length k, then the SI prior should be weighted to be no more 4% of the total outbreak size; however, a range of weights could be considered to examine the robustness of the results. When total outbreak lengths are limited, weighting the SI prior to be 1-2% of the total outbreak size may be more appropriate. If contact tracing data is not available then a range of possible models with reasonable choices of k should be considered. The choice of k can be determined by prior knowledge of similar outbreaks or general knowledge about the pathogen. Each model can be analyzed using a uniform prior distribution for the SI and the models can be compared using the DIC (or other model assessment tool). Smallest DICs indicate best fit, which can be used to narrow down the best model and value for k. These estimates can also be updated and confirmed as the outbreak continues and more cases are observed. Table 3 . Five separate MCMC analyses were conducted, each with a different SI prior distribution, as well as two additional analyses using the White and Pagano method. The first three MCMC analyses were performed using the informative priors shown in Fig. 2 , and are composed of the actual number of observed serial intervals from the contact tracing samples, which corresponds to 0.8-1.5% of the total outbreak size. The confirmed influenza-like illness cases have a maximum SI length of five days, while the probable cases have a maximum length of six days. Two uniform prior distributions were included, with five and six day maximum SI lengths, chosen to match the lengths of contact tracing samples. To assess if these models (choices of k) are appropriate, additional models with varying values of k, using uniform priors, were also included. Values of k that were considered ranged from k = 5 to 20, with model comparison done via the DIC (Table 4) . R 0 was estimated between 1.36-1.46 for when using the priors based on observed SIs from contact tracing, which is consistent with other estimates from South Africa [27, 31] . The estimates for the average serial interval range from 2.00-2.66 days. Slightly larger posterior estimates for Î¼ and R 0 are observed for the analyses with a six-day maximum SI length, but overall the results are similar between approaches. The results from the White and Pagano maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method are consistent with those from the Bayesian models. The MLEs for the five-day SI and six-day SI areR 0 = 1.36 and 1.47, andm = 2.07 and 2.70, respectively. The confidence intervals for White and Pagano are wider than the credible intervals obtained from the Bayesian approach, but otherwise they are similar. The DIC assessment compared 16 possible models with differing values of k, each with a uniform prior. We observe the smallest DIC for models with k = 6 or k = 7, which supports our findings above and our choice of k. Additional exploratory analyses are included in S3 Appendix, which examine the results when using a weighted contact tracing sample. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Singapore and Hong Kong SARS data are analyzed separately for each location and the results are shown in Table 5 . For each location, two analyses are conducted: the first using a contact tracing informed prior distribution for the SI, and the second using a uniform prior distribution, both with a maximum length of 20 days. . The Hong Kong results are slightly different than those from Singapore, but a similar trend is seen when including contact tracing data. Our estimates for R 0 (2.02 for the informative prior; 2.78 for the uniform prior) are smaller than what Wallinga and Teunis calculated (R t = 3.6, 95% CI: 3.1, 4.2). The estimates from White and Pagano are substantially larger, especially for Singapore, which is likely to be due to the small sample size and large number of parameters. The 95% confidence intervals estimates are also wide. The results from the analysis of the Singapore data should be interpreted with caution given the limited outbreak size and short total epidemic length. The Hong Kong outbreak was larger than Singapore, but was still limited in terms of total length and was not substantially larger than the contact tracing sample size; the contact tracing sample size was 27% of the total outbreak size. We would recommend down weighting the contact tracing sample in the prior in this instance, but due to the large k this may not be feasible. The simplest prior we consider is the uniform prior and with k = 20 this is already equivalent to 3% of the total outbreak size, implying that any informative prior would be weighted to be at least 3% of the total outbreak size. Because of this, the uniform prior may be most appropriate for this analysis. The SARS outbreak in Hong Kong was analyzed using three models with varying lengths of k (k = 10, 15, and 20) and a uniform prior for the SI; Singapore was not included due to the short total outbreak length and larger values for k were not considered due to a limited epidemic curve length of 39 days in Hong Kong. The models were compared via the DIC and showed that the model with k = 20 was a better fit than k = 10 or k = 15. For k = 10, the DIC = 323.9, withR 0 = 1.45 andm = 3.40; for k = 15, the DIC = 289.6, withR 0 = 2.02 andm = 8.12; for k = 20, the DIC = 282.2, withR 0 = 2.78 andm = 11.33. Modeling the SI with maximum length 20, we see that estimates for R 0 = 2-3 and the mean SI = 8-11 days.
