To confirm the results of the microarray analysis at different time points after REV infection, total RNA was extracted from CEFs and analysed using real-time RT-PCR. As shown in Table 5 , we selected 11 genes including STAT1, ISG12-2, TLR-3, IL-6, and SOCS1 and quantified their expression by qRT-PCR. The overall results generally matched the microarray data, indicating the reliability of the microarray analysis. Although variations were observed between -03 TNFRSF6B, LOC422316, IL1R2, IL22RA1, OSMR, TNFSF15, KITLG, TNFRSF8, CX3CL1,  CCL5, CXCL12, IFNA3, TNFRSF11B, CXCR4, IL10RA, TNFRSF19, CSF3R, IL2RG, GHR,  CSF1R, IL6, TNFSF4, FLT1, TNFRSF13B, LIFR, HGF, IL6RA, TNFSF10 Table. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0126992.g004 these two analyses, these were most likely due to differences in intrinsic features between the techniques and procedures. Thus, the qRT-PCR results showed the same relative regulation of expression patterns as those observed by the microarray analysis, and the microarray data were dependable indicators of variations in gene expression.
