Fig 1 shows the study selection flowchart. Data from all eligible studies were obtained frompublished manuscripts. A systematic review showed that 610 patients (42.8%) with NCP were female. Fever (89.2%) and cough (67.2%) were the most common symptoms, followed by fatigue (43.6%), phlegm (28.6%), shortness of breath/difficulty(21.7%), and the less common symptoms were dizziness, hemoptysis, abdominalpain, conjunctivalcongestion/conjunctivitis.1,377 cases were divided into severe group (1, 110) and non-severe group (267), Stratified chi-square test showed that there was nosignificant difference in gender between the two groups(P>0.05), and the median age in the non-severe group (967 fever,88.31%) were used to meta analysis for fever; Three studies were considered to be homogeneous, and fixed effect model(Chi 2 =0.88, P=0.64, I 2 =0%). The pooled effect was 1.70 (95%CI, 1.01-2.87) indicating fever patients had a 1.70 times higher incidence of severe risk than non-fever. On symptoms of polypnea/dyspnea, 262 cases in the severe group(112 polypnea/dyspnea,42.75%) and 1095 cases in the non-severe group(179polypnea/dyspnea,68.32%). Test showed that 3 literatures have certain heterogeneity(Chi2=5.26,P=0.07, I2=62%), so the random effect model was adopted; The individual OR effect showed differently, but combined OR effect was 3.53 (95%CI, 1.95-6.38), indicating the incidence of severe risk of the patients with polypnea/dyspnea was 3.53 times higher than those none. On symptoms of diarrhea, 266 cases in the severe group (25 diarrhea,9.40%) and 1,110 cases in the non-severe group (48diarrhea,4.32%). Test showed homogeneity (Chi 2 =0.32, P=0.85,I 2 = 0%) and fixed effect model was used, The combined OR value was 1.80 (95%CI, 1.06-3.03), indicating the incidence of diarrhea in the severe group .

(See Fig 4) The graphs in funnel plots of fever, polypnea/dyspnea and diarrhea are basically symmetrical, which looks like no significant publication deviation. (See fig 5)
