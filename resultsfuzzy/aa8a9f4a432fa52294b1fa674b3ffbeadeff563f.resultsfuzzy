The hCoV-NL63 genome contains an open reading frame (ORF 3) situated between the S and E genes (Figure 1A) . Nucleic acid sequence alignments with homologous genes of other CoV from groups alpha, beta and gamma yield nucleotide identities between 30,3% and 51,9% (Table within Figure 1A ). Amino acid alignments showed highest levels of similarity (62%) and identity (43%) between hCoV-NL63 ORF 3 protein and the homologous protein of hCoV-229E [48] . A constant level of similarity was observed across the whole protein. In-silico analysis of potential glycosylation sites and membrane topology suggest properties similar to SARS-CoV ORF 3a protein ( Figure 1B and Table 1 ). HCoV-NL63 encodes a 225 aa protein (approximately 26 kDa) with three putative transmembrane domains at aa positions 39-61, 70-92 and 97-116, respectively (TMHMM analysis). It has three potential N-glycosylation sites (NXS/T) at aa positions 16, 119 and 126, of which probably only the first is used because the sites at positions 119 and 126 are located inside the predicted transmembrane domains. No O-glycosylation sites are predicted. Nearly half of the protein (108 of 225 aa) forms a hydrophilic C-terminus. These findings are in concordance with earlier data comparing SARS-CoV 3a-like CoV proteins [35] .
