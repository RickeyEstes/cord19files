We fit the transmission dynamics of Ebola in Guinea in Fig. 2 , with initially 21 infectious cases, and 1 recovered case. Note that the transmission dynamics is not affected by the treatment, but the case fatality will be subject to the treatment-donationstockpile dynamics. All simulations are performed under the assumption that the use and collection of convalescent blood starts at the beginning of the outbreak. Convalescent whole blood or plasma: Fig. 3 compares the blood collection and storage in two different forms: convalescent whole blood (CWB) and convalescent plasma (CP), as suggested in WHO (2014b). We set the donor recovery period for CWB as 56 daysthe shortest recommended period for whole blood donors, and for CP as 14 days; the blood collection expiration period is 35 days for CWB and 40 days for CP. The simulation clearly shows substantial advantage of convalescent plasma treatment in terms of reducing the CFR (Fig. 3c) and increasing the blood bank stockpile (Fig. 3d) . Logistic consideration of different therapies will need a further cost-benefit study based on our model formulation. Note that a significant difference in the amount of expired stockpiles (Fig. 3f) is mainly caused by the higher amount of blood donation in the form of CP (Fig. 3d ) since there will be more recovered patients and donors from the CP therapy. Initial stockpile and blood stockpile usage strategy: Fig. 4 examines the impact on CFR and implication for the need of capacity of the public health system to implement different stockpile usage strategies by varying K, where larger K corresponds to more conservative use of stockpiles. This simulation is based on convalescent plasma therapy and the assumption that a blood stockpile of 100 units is available at the beginning of the outbreak. Aggressive use of blood storage indeed leads to lower CFR throughout the outbreak (Fig. 4c) , but also results in low blood storage level for a long time (Fig. 4d) . Conservative use of stockpile maintains higher blood bank levels for most of the time, but leads to large amount of donation waste (Fig. 4f) . So in either case, it might be also necessary to utilize and process the expiring donations into HIG blood product for use during emergency events. In Fig. 5 , we illustrate the impact of initial stockpiles Bð0Þ. The simulation is based on convalescent plasma therapy and on the assumption that a stockpile preservation policy with threshold of 200 stockpiles under which half of the patients will switch to blood transfusion. In a large-scale convalescent therapy program, the availability of more stockpiles at the beginning leads to lower CFR during the early stage of the outbreak, but the overall CFR is not affected much. However, impact of insufficient initial stockpile Bð0Þ could be different from outbreaks in a small population, to address this small-scale outbreak requires agent-based simulations in a future study. In Fig. 6 , we consider the impact on CFR when the values K and Bð0Þ are changed. We note that the final CFR over the entire period of the outbreak is not considerably affected by either of the two aspects, and the minimal stockpile number is small in all cases. The above results suggest us to investigate the impacts of the blood collection parameters on reducing CFRs and maintaining blood bank levels. Management of blood collection services: We vary the parameter values relevant to blood donation policy and service in Fig. 7 one (1) the donor recovery period is 56 days for CWB donors and 14 days for CP donors; and (2) the blood collection expiration period is 35 days for CWB and 40 days for CP. The simulation clearly shows substantial advantage of convalescent plasma treatment in terms of reducing the CFR (Fig. 3c) and increasing the blood bank stockpile (Fig. 3d) Recall that a large K value means more conservative usage of the stockpile. This simulation is based on convalescent plasma therapy and the assumption that a blood stockpile of 100 units is available at the beginning of the outbreak. Fig. 4c shows that more conservative use of blood storage leads to higher CFR in the early stage of the outbreak, and the CFR decreases faster later on due to more stockpiles become available. by one, while keeping all other parameters fixed as in Table 1 and consider the treatment and collection in the form of plasma. Parameters suggested in the WHO guideline are marked in the figures. Efficient reduction of the CFR depends significantly on the following aspects: enhancing the policy and service on donation, encouraging and recruiting donors, keeping good track of donor contacts, frequently updating stockpile information and rapid delivery, shortening the donor recovery period, and reducing the transition duration from discharge to first donation. We note that the outcomes are very sensitive to the parameter α, ξ, and ϵ. Hence in real applications of this model, these parameters should be carefully estimated from local blood donation data. However, similar to the results in Fig. 6b , the lowest blood bank levels are not essentially affected by the blood collection parameters and always stay at a low level. Therefore, following our simulation results, to save a sufficient amount of stockpiles for other control priorities, one needs to either hold the stockpiles at a certain threshold level until additional donations are made by recovered patients, or make use of the expiring blood donations.
