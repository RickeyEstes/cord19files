During NIV via a helmet with the simulator programmed in mild lung injury, exhaled air leaked through the neck-helmet interface with a radial distance of 150 to 230 mm when inspiratory positive airway pressure was increased from 12 to 20 cm H 2 O, respectively, while keeping the expiratory pressure at 10 cm H 2 O. During NIV via a helmet with air cushion around the neck, there was negligible air leakage. During NIV via a total facemask for mild lung injury, air leaked through the exhalation port to 618 and 812 mm when inspiratory pressure was increased from 10 to 18 cm H 2 O, respectively, with the expiratory pressure at 5 cm H 2 O. CONCLUSIONS: A helmet with a good seal around the neck is needed to prevent nosocomial infection during NIV for patients with respiratory infections. 6, 7 Patients may progress rapidly to ARDS and multiorgan failure, requiring intensive care support. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) may play a supportive role in patients with early ARDS or acute lung injury due to SARI as a bridge to invasive mechanical ventilation. [8] [9] [10] However, a systematic review has shown that mask ventilation, tracheal intubation, tracheotomy, and NIV may increase the risk of nosocomial transmission of respiratory infections to health-care workers (HCWs). 11 Following the outbreak of SARS and emergence of the A(H1N1) infection, it has been recommended that when NIV is required for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to SARI, infection control measures such as the use of helmets or full facemasks, double circuit tubes, and addition of viral-bacterial fi lters be considered. 10, 12 However, whether these infection control measures are eff ective in minimizing exhaled air leakage has not been objectively evaluated. Th is study aimed to examine the dispersion of exhaled air during application of NIV via helmets and total facemask. Knowledge about the extent of exhaled air leakage from diff erent masks will facilitate the development of preventive measures to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission during application of NIV to high-risk patients hospitalized with SARI.
