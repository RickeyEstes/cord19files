Free-flying condors, eagles, and turkey vultures. Exposure to several different potential pathogens was found in all three scavenging bird species (Fig 2) . Seroprevalence varied both by location and species, depending on the particular pathogen. Overall, free-flying condors had a seroprevalence of 32% (29/92) for avian adenovirus, 9% (7/81) for IBV-Ark, 45% (38/85) for IBV-Conn, 32% (26/82) for IBV-Mass, 1% (1/92) for M. gallisepticum, 26% (22/86) for AVPM-2, and 3% (3/92) for T. gondii. The seroprevalence of WNV was 61% (55/90) in freeflying condors, and the majority of these individuals were previously vaccinated. All free-flying condors were seronegative for C. psittaci, M. synoviae, AVPM-1, AVPM-3, and avian reovirus ( Table 1) . Seroprevalence in golden eagles was 76% (19/25) for avian adenovirus, 17% (4/24) for C. psittaci, and 15% (4/26) for T. gondii. All eagles were seronegative for IBV, M. gallisepticum, M. synoviae, APMV-1, 2, and 3, avian reovirus, and WNV. Turkey vultures had a seroprevalence of 42% (26/62) for avian adenovirus, 9% (4/43) for C. psittaci, 2% (1/46) for AVPM-1, 11% (7/66) for T. gondii, and 9% (6/66) for WNV. All turkey vultures were seronegative for IBV, M. gallisepticum, M. synoviae, AVPM-2, AVPM-3 and avian reovirus ( Table 2) . Seroprevalence for each pathogen was similar among turkey vultures by site; therefore data were combined for analysis. Age and sex distributions did not differ among the three free-flying condor release locations and the vulture and eagle populations. Seroprevalence to IBV (Conn and Mass strains) differed among the three free-flying condor release locations. Southern California condors had a significantly higher seroprevalence of IBV-Conn (66%, 25/38) than either the Pinnacles condors (27%, 4/15, P = 0.015) or the Big Sur condors (28%, 9/32, P = 0.002). The condors released in southern California also had a higher seroprevalence of IBV-Mass (51%, 18/35), compared to those released in Pinnacles National Park (0%, 0/16, P < 0.001) and those released in Big Sur (26%, 8/31, P = 0.045). The seroprevalence to IBV-Mass was significantly higher in condors from Big Sur compared to Pinnacles National Park (P = 0.038). With the exception of higher avian adenovirus seroprevalence in golden eagles compared to turkey vultures (P = 0.005), seroprevalence of other pathogens was not significantly different between golden eagles and turkey vultures ( Table 2) . Free-flying California condors had higher seroprevalence of IBV-Conn and IBV-Mass compared to turkey vultures (P < 0.001 for both strains) and golden eagles (P < 0.001 for both strains), as well as a higher seroprevalence of IBV-Ark compared to turkey vultures (P = 0.021). Free-flying condors also showed a significantly higher seroprevalence of APMV-2 than turkey vultures (P < 0.001) and golden eagles (P = 0.003). Conversely, a higher seroprevalence of C. psittaci was found in both golden eagles (P = 0.001) and turkey vultures (P = 0.009) relative to free-flying condors, and golden eagles had a significantly higher avian adenovirus seroprevalence than free-flying California condors (P < 0.001). Captive condors. The condors housed at the SDZSP had a seroprevalence of 7% (2/28) for avian adenovirus, 14% (4/28) for IBV-Ark, 54% (15/28) for IBV-Mass, 57% (16/28) for M. gallisepticum, and 59% (16/27) for AVPM-2. Captive condors from SDZSP were seronegative for C. psittaci, IBV-Conn, M. synoviae, AVPM-1, AVPM-3, avian reovirus and T. gondii. Condors housed at the LAZ had a seroprevalence of 14% (2/13) for C. psittaci and were seronegative for all other pathogens. T. gondii serostatus was not determined for LAZ condors. The seroprevalence of avian adenovirus in both populations of captive condors was significantly lower than in free-flying condors (P = 0.018 for LAZ, P = 0.012 for SDZSP), as was the seroprevalence of IBV-Conn (P = 0.001 for LAZ, P < 0.001 for SDZSP), while the seroprevalence of IBV-Mass was significantly higher in SDZSP condors than in free-flying condors (P = 0.045). The SDZSP condors also had a higher seroprevalence of AVPM-2 and M. gallisepticum compared to freeflying condors (P = 0.005 and P < 0.001, respectively). The seroprevalence of C. psittaci was significantly higher in LAZ condors than in free-flying condors (P = 0.014). The seroprevalences of IBV-Mass, M. gallisepticum and AVPM-2 was significantly lower in LAZ condors compared to condors housed at SDZSP (P = 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). All condor tissue samples were negative by PCR for adenovirus, coronavirus, paramyxovirus and Mycoplasma spp. In addition, the serum and blood samples from the free-flying condors were negative for WNV by PCR.
