Cloning, expression and purification of the active Zika NS2B-NS3pro. Based on the sequence alignment with NS2B and NS3pro of the Dengue serotype 2 we previously studied (12) , the corresponding Zika sequences were identified for the NS2B and NS3pro of the Asian Zika virus. From synthetic genes with E. coli preferred codons, we amplified and subsequently cloned the DNA fragments into His-tagged expression vectors. The recombinant proteins were expressed in BL 21 cells and then purified by Ni 2+ -affinity chromatography, followed by further purification with FPLC gel-filtration chromatography. Recombinant protease samples were checked by SDS-PAGE, molecular weights verification with ESI-MS and protein sequencing with time-of-flight-mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Protein concentration was determined by the UV spectroscopic method with 8 M urea (19) . All enzymatic/inhibitory experiments were performed in 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.5, with a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer in triplicate and data are presented as mean Â± SD. The Zika NS2B-NS3pro we obtained is fully active as judged from its enzymatic activity on a fluorescent substrate Bz-nKRR-AMC (12) .
