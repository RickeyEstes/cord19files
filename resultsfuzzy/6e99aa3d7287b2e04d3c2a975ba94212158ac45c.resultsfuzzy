Boag, Craig Breheny, Adam Gow. Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, Edinburgh, UK Standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been established for in-clinic laboratory tests, such as the World Health Organisation guidelines for packed cell volume. No independent evidence based guidelines exist for dipstick urinalysis, however manufacturer's instructions state to dip the stick into urine. In veterinary medicine, occasionally urine samples of such small volume are obtained that this is impractical and dripping urine on the stick from a pipette or syringe is performed. This also has the advantage of conserving the sample for additional tests. The hypothesis of this study was that the method of drip or drip would have no effect on the test results. Siemens Multistix 10SG strips were used. To standardise the method of strip analysis, a Siemens Clinitek Status+ analyser was used to read the strips; controlling time of reading the results and user variability in interpretation of colourimetric changes. Three individuals tested 25 aliquots of urine from dogs with a range of disease processes by both the dip and drip method. Results were compared for each variable between drip and dip using Wilcoxon-signed rank test. Across the nine variables assessed (SG was not), a significant difference between methods was found for one variable, bilirubin (P = 0.046). This difference was accounted for by one dog who tested negative for bilirubin for all three users using a dip method and had a trace value for all three users using a drip methodology. No other significant differences were found between variables. This study demonstrated a significant difference between dipping and dripping for bilirubin, caused by one dog with the same level of variability for all three users. This difference is, in the authors' opinion, clinically insignificant. This study therefore supports the use of either a dipping or dripping approach to urinalysis. Further studies are required to more fully assess the role of individual variation when performing the test including level of experience.
