In spleen and blood, the 81-cell fraction supported the original IFN production (Table 3 ) , regardless of the types of inducer viruses (Table 4) . However, IFN production by 81-spleen cells was slightly enhanced as compared to the original population, 26 000 and 18 800 I.U./ml (P < 0.05), respectively. In contrast, 81+ cells exhibited a very low level of IFN production, corresponding on a per cell basis, as a dilution of 81 -cells, to a factor of 16. Table 5 show that each subset, as estimated by surface receptors, was present in the plastic-non-adherent 81 + and 81 -cell fractions, whether in spleen or blood. Comparison of the RFC distribution between the 81 -cell fraction and the original population did not reveal any significant difference in the spleen (Table 5A ); in contrast, blood lymphocytes showed (Table 5B ) a lower proportion of T cells in the 81 -cell fraction by comparison with the original population. There was also a concomittant increase in the proportion of null cells. Comparing 81+ and 81-cell fractions in the spleen, there was a higher proportion of FcR+ in the 81-cell fraction than in the 81 + cell fraction, either in the absence (33% compared to 12%; P<0.05) or in the presence of dextran (42% compared to 23%; P<0.05). No significant difference was de- 1Mean percentage + s.e.m, of four spleen and three blood preparations.

In the blood, a significantly higher proportion of T cells was found among the 81 + than 81 -cells, 74% as compared to 38% (P< 0.01 ). Conversely, there was a lower proportion of null cells in 81+ (24%) than in 81-cells (56%) (P < 0.02 ). No significant change was seen in other subsets although there was a trend towards a higher proportion of EA-RFC in the 81 -cell fraction (2%) than in the 81 + cell fraction (4%). 


Section:incubation with the 81b antibody did not result in any modification of nk activity (data not shown). in addition, there was no correlation between the level of nk activity and ifn production, as tested in each organ. removal of 81+ cells from plastic-non-adherent cells did not impair the original nk activity (table 3 ). nk activity of 81 + cells in spleen and blood was lower (p< 0.05) than that of plastic-non-adherent cells. only in spleen was the nk activity of 81 + cells significantly lower than that of 81-cells (p < 0.05). it can be seen in
