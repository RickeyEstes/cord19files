Glycan microarrays are mostly used to study glycan−protein interactions with the goal of understanding the nature of the multivalent interactions between the cell-surface glycans and the proteins they interact with. Therefore, an ideal glycan array is one that best mimics the glycans that are found on living cell surfaces. For example, the density and spatial distribution of Globo-H on malignant cells and their stem cells of breast cancer patients progressively increase. To identify the patients who would benefit from vaccination with the Globo-H vaccine, 39 to study the disease progression, and to monitor the antibody response to the vaccine in vitro, it would be useful if the glycan arrays were able to mimic the changes on the cell surface at different stages of the disease. However, there is no such glycan array available to date as the cell surface is a dynamic and heterogeneous system with variations in substrates on the surface, and as such the development of a glycan array to mimic the real cell surface remains a major challenge. Nevertheless, the preparation of a surface for glycan array in a controllable and reproducible manner with regard to the distribution, density, and spatial orientation of glycans is important to address some fundamental questions such as the avidity of weak binding and multivalent heteroligand interaction. The glycan array on ACG slides has been shown to meet these needs. Surface anodization of aluminum has been used in numerous industrial applications mostly in the electrical oxidation of objects for pore size creation, color-filling, pore-sealing and pore-polishing. The surface anodization requires the use of Mannose with α-5-pentylphosphonic acid was covalently bound to the ACG slide surface. Fluorescence-tagged concanavalin A (ConA-A488) was then bound to mannose specifically. Con A is a lectin tetramer with subunit dimension of 42 × 40 × 39 Å 3 . Each subunit has a mannose binding site. Geometrically, only two binding sites per molecule are available for mannose binding. The most effective mannose/ConA-A488 binding should give the strongest fluorescence intensity, and this model system has been used to optimize the AAO surface for the glycan microarray.
