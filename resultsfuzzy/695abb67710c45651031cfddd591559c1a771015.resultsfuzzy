During the infectious period, people with symptoms can choose to go to the hospital, stay at home, or take no action. The proportion of people who adopt these different paths affects how the disease is transmitted. Education and publicity by governments, and people's personal characteristics will influence an infected person's decisions. Fig. 6 shows the effects of different personal decisions on infectious disease transmission. The green line shows the results of the hospital group, and the purple line shows the results when all of the infected people stay home. (We assumed that infected people make a random decision during the infectious period.) The number of infected people is much lower in the scenario where most of the infected people decide to go to hospital. In the case of all infected people staying home (purple line), the infection spreads very quickly because many people have already spread the disease before they decide to stay home. In other words, the efficiency of transmission prevention is low if infected patients stay home, and no other measures such as work stoppages and school closures are taken during the early stage of the outbreak. The red line (case 6) shows the results when 90% of the infected patients stay home and the other 10% take no measures. The percentage of infected people increases to 57% of the population after 115 days if there are no other controls. Comparing the black and purple lines, we can see that staying home is more helpful in controlling disease transmission than taking no measures. If all infected people go to hospital, the hospitals will run out of beds. Therefore, governments should attempt to strengthen hospital loads during the key periods of an infectious disease outbreak.
