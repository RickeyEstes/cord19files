Heat Production and Temperature in the NINA Heater Ten replicate runs of the optimized prototype displayed minimal variation in temperature from run to run within the reaction tubes ( Figure 1 ). The heater reached the optimal incubation temperature in 15 minutes, and maintained the target temperature with minimal drift over 60 minutes. (Drift from minimum to maximum temperature within run, mean over all runs = 2uC.) Comparison of the temperature plots for the CaO, EPCM, and reaction tubes in Figure 1 to Figure 1B in Hatano et al. [27] illustrates the beneficial effect of having the EPCM component in the heater. The CaO temperature traces show rapid and poorly controlled heat generation, with maximum temperatures exceeding 100uC. The traces of the EPCM at the interface with the CaO have a pattern similar to the CaO, but the initial temperature excursions are reduced in magnitude, and the plots are far more repeatable. Finally, the reaction tubes display only a uniform ramping to the target temperature followed by a prolonged stable isothermal phase. The temperature in the NINA reaction appears more uniform than that shown by Hatano et al. [27] for their hand-warmer device. These results evince the potential of EPCM in an optimized design for controlling exothermic reactions in a simple NINA. This level of temperature control is important to enable conformance to the ''sensitive'', ''specific'', and ''robust'' aspects of the ASSURED guidelines. Once the abundant heat from the CaO reaction begins to melt the EPCM, the additional heat produced by the exothermic reaction is converted into the latent heat of fusion of the EPCM. Thus, the temperature in the EPCM remains constant at the selected melting temperature until the solid to liquid transition is complete (provided heat transfer within the EPCM is rapid). Once the CaO reaction has reached equilibrium, the energy stored as latent heat keeps the two-phase EPCM at the target temperature until complete solidification. In our optimization work we observed that the purity of the CaO need not be high, although it should be consistent to yield consistent heat profiles (data not shown). The ability to use less pure CaO is important for minimizing the cost per amplification, addressing the ''affordable'' aspect of the ASSURED guidelines. Other key physicochemical parameters of raw CaO (particle size, particle porosity, presence of unoxidized calcium carbonate ''grit'', etc.) that result from variation in kiln calcination of limestone [29] (the industrial manufacturing process) also must be kept consistent for consistent heat profiles. However, we were able to produce precise heat profiles in our prototypes with commodity grades of CaO. This makes the only disposable materials (CaO, water, and PCR tubes) in the device very inexpensive. The reaction of CaO and water can be tuned somewhat to control the steepness of the temperature ramp and the maximum temperature for a given reaction chamber, although flexibility and precision is greatly improved by including the EPCM. The EPCM used here is tunable for many of its important characteristics (melting temperature range, specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity, etc.) making this device a flexible incubation platform potentially applicable to a number of isothermal amplification techniques. When evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry, the EPCM melts over a range of temperatures around the target (62uC), and displays some hysteresis in the phase change, presumably due to polydispersity in polymer chain length and supercooling of the EPCM (personal communication from Renewable Alternatives). It is unclear at this time how this behavior contributes to variation seen in the results of the LAMP assay; however, the manufacturer of the EPCM is confident that further development of the EPCM for this application will mitigate this behavior. The EPCM is a fully hydrogenated fat product, so it is resistant to environmental oxidation and should be very stable. While the EPCM is not currently as readily available as CaO, and is not a commodity product like CaO, similar materials have been used in consumer products in the US. These EPCMs are made mainly from bio-based fats -namely beef tallow, palm oil, coconut oil and soybean oil -so local, low-cost production of the EPCM in the developing world should be feasible. Portable energy for heat production could, of course, be supplied with conventional batteries, so a comparison seems appropriate. A cost analysis indicates that on a per calorie per test basis, using CaO as a thermal battery is several times less expensive than mass-produced, disposable, dry-cell batteries. Costs are scaled by the projected number of analytical runs possible and include both energy source and control hardware. CaO disposables are single use, while dry cells are expected to last five runs based on their energy density (four D-cells would be required). Two grades of CaO (reagent grade and soap grade), with an EPCM are compared to three possible dry-cell implementations (with an EPCM, with microprocessor closedloop control, with thermostat closed-loop control). With a projected cost per run of US$0.56, the soap-grade CaO/EPCM combination is clearly the least-expensive alternative (compared to $1.40, $1.17, $1.21, and $1.16 for reagent-grade CaO/EPCM, Dcell/EPCM, D-cell/microprocessor, and D-cell/thermostat, respectively.) Costs were estimated from MSRP. Increased value of CaO over the alternatives could be realized at increased production volumes. Any special disposal or recycling required does not seem any more onerous than what is required for common batteries. The data shown here were not gathered under any stringent external environmental control; therefore, given that testing was performed in an air-conditioned laboratory, it is likely that the system was not challenged in the same way as it would be at its intended point of use. The wide external temperature ranges found in LRS could significantly change the ramp time and/or duration at the desired temperature of the heater, possibly significantly, but the characteristics of the EPCM will ensure that the desired temperature is held for some period of time, regardless without calibration to the ambient conditions or closed-loop control. First principles of heat transfer dictate that the effects of ambient on ramp time and/or duration should be greatest when the desired temperature is furthest from ambient. Thus, the problem should be appropriately non-dimensionalized to identify states of similitude. We plan to explore these phenomena and to evaluate their effects once we have improved our understanding of the intrinsic variation in the assay chemistry sufficiently to evaluate those effects. This evaluation will include trials under actual field conditions.
