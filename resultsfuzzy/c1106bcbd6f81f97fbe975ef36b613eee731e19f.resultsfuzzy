To investigate the importance of Trp-rich region in SARS-CoV viral entry, S proteins with mutations in Trp-rich region were prepared. All clones containing different mutated S genes were selected and confirmed by sequencing. The expression of S protein mutants in 293T cells was detected by rabbit anti-S protein antibody. The results showed that mutants W1194A, W1199A, W2A-4/6, W2A-4/9, WY4A, and WYF5A (see Table 2 for abbreviations) were expressed at high level, whereas others, such as the expression of Y1197A and W3A were detected at low level. No protein expression was detected under our experimental condition for W1196A, F1202A, and W2A-6/9 (Fig. 3) . SARS-CoV pseudotyped with S protein and its mutants was used to determine S protein-mediated infectivity. Pseudotyped retroviruses containing S protein mutants were first generated using a global site-directed mutagenesis and then Ala-scan of aromatic amino acids in the Trp-rich region to determine the positional importance of each Trp, Phe or Tyr. To restore the aromaticity of Ala-mutants, we performed rescue experiments using a Phe-scan. The results show that global substituted mutants, tri-, tetra-and penta-substitution with Ala (WYF5A, WY4A, and W3A) completely abrogate infectivity, while single-and double-substitution with Ala (W2A-4/6, W2A-4/9, W2A-6/9, W1194A, W1196A, Y1197A, W1199A, and F1202A) substantially decrease infectivity by >90% (Table 3) . On the other hand, Phe-substituted mutants are able to restore 10-25% infectivity comparing to the wild-type (Table 4 ). These results suggest that the aromatic residues of the Trp-rich region of S protein are essential for SARS-CoV infectivity. Coronavirus entry is mediated by type I viral envelope S protein. S protein of SARS-CoV is responsible for receptor-binding and membrane fusion. S protein contains several functional domains (Fig. 1) to support its correct folding and conformation which are crucial for its function. The Trp-rich region is absolutely conserved in members of coronaviruses (Fig. 2) and highly conserved in other RNA viruses such as HIV, FIV, and EboV.

It may play important roles during the whole fusion process. Many laboratories have shown that the Trp-rich region plays an important role in HIV infection [11, 12, 19] . More importantly, this exposed region contains epitopes to which broadly neutralizing antibodies could be raised [11] [12] [13] . Indeed, Sainz et al. [4] found that the Trp-rich region of coronavirus type I viral fusion protein induces membrane permeabilization to facilitate the viral entry. Epand et al. [20] claimed that the Trp-rich region of HIV gp41 could promote the formation of cholesterol-rich domains which could facilitate membrane fusion. Results obtained from our former work [21] show that cholesterol-enriched microdomains, known as lipid rafts, are required for SARS-CoV entry. The cryoEM structures of HIV and SIV reveal that the Trp-rich region forms the ''feet" of a tripodlike structure of the spike proteins [22] , anchoring the legs (HR1 and HR2 regions) firmly on the lipid rafts of viral surface. In the post-fusion state, the two heptad-repeat regions (HR1 and HR2) form a 6-helix bundle, positioning the fusion peptide closely to the Trp-rich region to drive apposition and subsequent fusion of viral and cell membranes. Because of their similarity in fusion mechanism of SARS-CoV and HIV, we hypothesized that the highly conserved Trp-rich region in SARS-CoV S protein plays a similar role in viral entry as in HIV by anchoring the tripodlike structure of S protein on a lipid rafts-like environment on the viral surface. Such a mechanism of anchoring S protein promotes clustering of S proteins, an effect which facilitates docking of host receptors, and subsequently membrane fusion by merging the cholesterol-enriched microdomains of both virus and host membranes. the infectivity of each SARS-CoV pseudotyped with S protein mutants was compared with wild-type pseudovirus.
