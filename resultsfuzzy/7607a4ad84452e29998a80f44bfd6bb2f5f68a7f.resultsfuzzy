A 62-year-old male was admitted to our hospital on 15 January, 2020 with pneumonia, and was further diagnosed as COVID-19. An epidemiological investigation also confirmed a Wuhan travel history between 1 January and 14 January of this patient, and the symptoms started on 11 January, 2020, including fever and cough. Lymphopenia, elevated CRP and IL-6 were found upon admission (Table S1 ). CT scans showed multiple ground-glass opacities and in bilateral lungs at the early stage, and lung consolidation occurred during hospitalization ( Figure S1 ). The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) sample was collected and subjected to nextgeneration sequencing and virus isolation was performed in the BSL-3 (Biosafety level 3) laboratory. Typical cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed at 4 days post inoculation (dpi) in Vero cell, including cell rounding, shrinkage, lysis, and detachment throughout the cell monolayers ( Figure 1A ). Viral RNAs could be detected in the cell culture supernatant using a CFDA approved commercial kit with low Ct values ( Figure 1B ). The purified SARS-CoV-2 particles showed specific reaction activity to convalescent plasmas from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients ( Figure 1C ) and the specific human monoclonal antibodies against the RBD of the S protein using ELISA assay ( Figure   1D ). Meanwhile, the virus could also be detected by immunofluorescence using the patient's plasma ( Figure 1E ). The genome sequence of this virus has been submitted to the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Flu Data (GISAID) with an access number of EPI_ISL_406594, and designated as "BetaCoV/Shenzhen/SZTH-003/2020". Phylogenetic analyses showed that the viruses possessed high homology with the other isolates, and two closest isolates are BetaCoV/Wuhan/IPBCAMS-WH-04/2019 from Wuhan and SARS-CoV-2/NTU01/2020/TWN from Taiwan ( Figure 1F ). In Figure 2 and Figure The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.972927 doi: bioRxiv preprint 6 roughly spherical or moderately pleiomorphic, with diameters range from 80nm-160nm. For majority of the virions, the periphery is well defined and enveloped by lipid bilayer, which could be clearly seen in cryo-EM image. Tightly underneath the lipid bilayer is the condensed density formed by nucleic acid and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. Though lots of the particles lost spike during purification or deactivation, 20%-30% percent virions still have spikes around the envelope. Different with spikes reported in previous study [5] , spikes in our images are much thinner both in negative staining image ( Figure 2 ) or cryo-EM image ( Figure 3 ). Spikes here have nail-like shape with a long body embedded in the envelope. Width of spike's head is around 7 nm. The length of whole spike is around 23nm. S protein of coronavirus consisted of S1 and S2 subunits. When S1 subunit is disassociated, S2 undergoes a conformation change, extending itself from compressed form to a nail-like shape, termed as post-fusion state. The nail-like shape was also observed by other researchers [13] [14] [15] . Work done by Song et al. [15] gave a detailed structure analysis of S2 protein using recombinant protein. Not only they reported the morphology of S2 protein at post-fusion state, they also reconstructed a 3D map. The 2D average image ( Figure 2E ) and 3D map ( Figure 2D ) reported in their paper [15] , have a consistent result with our observation both in negative staining or Cryo-EM images (shown in Figure 2C and Figure 3E ,3F).
