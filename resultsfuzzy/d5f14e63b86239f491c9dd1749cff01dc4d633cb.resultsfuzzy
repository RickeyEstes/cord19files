Information-theoretic analysis Figure 3 shows the graphs for the information token entropy and information token Informationtheoretic assessment. Both entropy and evenness graphs feature wave-like patterns, indicating that the set of observed unique codon identifiers grows with increasing progression stages while the distribution of all observed unique codon identifiers remains rather even. evenness. As one can see, these feature the aforementioned wave-like patterns, which means the system can be regarded open in the sense that over time the number of unique codon identifiers grows. It is important to note that the evenness of the distribution of codon identifiers is relatively high, converging around a value of 0.95. This means that those codon identifiers that have been observed are quite evenly distributed. These results allow the interpretation that (a) there is evolving variation in the genomic sequences we studied, but (b) there is no indication for the dominance of a particular variance.
