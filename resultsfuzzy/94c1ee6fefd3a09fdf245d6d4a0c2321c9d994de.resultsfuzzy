Human and mouse genes (HostDB) have extensive alternative transcripts and there is increasing evidence that many eukaryotic pathogen genes have more than one transcript. EuPathDB infrastructure was updated to better represent transcript information. Transcripts are graphically represented on gene pages and listed in gene page tables when data can be unambiguously assigned to a transcript (Figure 4D ). All gene search results now include a Transcript ID column ( Figure 3C ). The results of searches that query transcript-specific data (e.g. Predicted Signal Peptide) contain an Explore Tool (see Tools section of this manuscript) for investigating transcript subsets ( Figure 3B ). Filtering samples based on metadata. Sequences from pathogen isolates and data from host clinical blood samples are often accompanied by rich metadata-sample characteristics including host, age, geographic location, disease status and parasitemia. EuPathDB's new filter parameter ( Figure  5 ) increases the user's power to mine data via display of sample characteristics (metadata) on the interface for selection of samples while configuring a search or multiple sequence alignment. For example, the filter parameter makes it possible to compare the antigenicity of parasite genes between infected children and uninfected children within the same dataset. The filter parameter is available for searches and sequence alignments that access SNP, ChIP-seq and hostresponse data. RNA-sequence analysis workflow updated. Our pipeline for analyzing and loading RNA-sequence data was updated to use standard tools and to accommodate data sets with biological replicates. The new workflow aligns reads with GSNAP and calculates FPKM/RPKM with HT-Seq (33, 34) . DESeq2 is used to determine differential expression for experiments that have appropriate biological replicates (35) .
