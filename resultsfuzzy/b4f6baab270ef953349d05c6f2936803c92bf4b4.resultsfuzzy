Two faecal samples from capybaras were collected in urban areas from Distrito Federal, Brazil and using HTS technologies, 201 CRESS DNA viruses were identified. Of these, 164 span four known viral families (Genomoviridae, Circoviridae, Smacoviridae, and Microviridae), and 37 are part of the unclassified CRESS DNA virus group ( Figure 1 ; Supplementary Table S1 ). The group of CRESS DNA viruses has increased drastically in recent years due to the broad application of metagenomics approaches. However, most of the CRESS DNA viruses' genomes remain unclassified due to their high diversity and lack of host information.
