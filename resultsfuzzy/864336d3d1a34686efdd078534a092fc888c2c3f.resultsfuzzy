As we discussed in section Materials and methods, we supposed that the appearing of a relapse and the presence of new unrecoverable neural damage are correlated [16] . In this paper we present the results obtained using 8 genetically predisposed randomly chosen individuals. We reproduced both the absence and presence of malfunctions of the Teff-Treg cross-balancing mechanisms at a local level. For simulating the absence of a local malfunction we supposed that both Teff and Treg populations had similar maximum duplication rates. In other words we set the maximum duplication rate of Teff eff_dup and the duplication rate of Treg p t to the same value, so both the cells populations have the same maximum duplication rates. We further supposed that the breakdown of the cross regulation mechanism is due to a lower duplication rate p t of Treg. In Table 1 we reassumed the most important parameters used for the simulations. We also tested the model by simulating 100 randomly chosen virtual patients (data not shown) in both the hill and the healthy scenarios by setting [eff_dup = 0.1; p t = 0.025] and [eff_dup = 0.1; p t = 0.1], respectively. We took, as outcome of the experiments, the total damage at the end of the simulations for both the scenarios. Median values of the final total damage were 77268 for the hill sample and 5357 for the healty sample. Non parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov two samples goodness-of-fit test gave as result a maximum difference between the cumulative distributions D = 0.7500 with a corresponding p-value of: 0.000, thus suggesting that the two samples are unlikely to be drawn from the same distribution (i.e., they are statistically different). In Figure 2 the behavior of Teff, Treg and viruses vs time for all the presented individuals in absence of malfunctions of the Teff-Treg cross-balancing mechanisms is showed. The number of Teff (in red) has some spikes at different time intervals in all plots. This indicates that in some cases, due to the stochasticity in the introduction of newborn cells, self-reactive Teff may initially escape from Treg control (blue lines) and can be activated due to mimicry, duplicate and try to attack myelin. However activated Treg are able to counterbalance Teff actions maintaining immune homeostasis. This is visible in Figure 4 where we show the levels of damage (recoverable, unrecoverable and total) for all the simulations. In this figure it is possible to see the presence of some spikes in the recoverable damage plots (blue lines) that obviously correspond to the spikes seen in Figure 2 . However such damage is usually recovered and at the end of the simulation almost no unrecoverable damage (red lines) arises. Figure 6 presents the spatial plots at the end of every simulation (after 5 years) in healthy patients. The plots confirm the observations that came from Figure 2 , as almost no black patches (which indicate the presence of some scarring or lesions) are present. In Figure 3 we show the behavior of Teff, Treg and viruses vs time for all the individuals in the case of malfunctions of the Teff-Treg cross-balancing mechanisms. Similarly to what has been observed in Figure 2 , all plots show some spikes in the Teff behaviors (red lines). However in this case the spikes are more numerous and reach higher values thus suggesting that, due the malfunction in the regulatory mechanisms, Teff can be easily activated and cause brain damage. In this case Treg are not always able to contrast Teff actions and maintain homeostasis, and this is visible in Figure 5 where the levels of damage are shown for all the simulations. In this case the spikes in the reversible damage plots (blue lines) are higher and bigger in number. It is also possible to observe the appearing of unrecoverable damage that indicates the appearing MS plaques and to see how the sum of both (total damage, black plots) mimics the typical relapsingremmiting dynamics observed in MS. Presence of scarring can be also seen in Figure 7 where the spatial plots for all individuals are presented at the end of 5 years. In all plots it is possible to see many black areas that indicate unrecoverable damage and thus the presence of lesions and scarring that may be correlated with relapses and appearing of inability. We also observed that (data not shown), in some cases (for some seeds) a decrease in the Teff or an increase Treg proliferation does not always entitle less severe relapses and, as a matter of fact, it could produce more severe relapses. This is mainly due to the stochasticity of the model. It may happen that the stochastic injection of new resting Teff may be not shortly followed by an equivalent injection of Treg, thus creating a temporary disequilibrium between the two populations which would entitle some neural damage even in potential healthy patients. Results presented here suggest that presence of a genetic predisposition is not always a sufficient condition for developing the disease. Other conditions such as a breakdown of the mechanisms that regulate and allow peripheral tolerance should be involved. This has also been observed in [13] . In our case we supposed that a malfunctioning of self-reactive regulatory T cells caused by lower duplication rates was the cause. Of course other conditions may be the cause of such a malfunctioning. Moreover we observed that in the simulations of hill patients relapses mainly occur in the first half of the simulation rather than in the second half (see, for example, Figure 5 , plots (a),(c),(d) and (e)). This could be in line with clinical observations which showed that the relapse rate tends to decrease as the disease progression [14, 15] .
