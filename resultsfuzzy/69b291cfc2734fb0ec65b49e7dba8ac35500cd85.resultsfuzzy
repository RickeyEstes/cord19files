CEK cells and TOCs were infected with IBV strains 885, QX, M41 or mock infected, cell metabolic activity and percentage of apoptotic cells were evaluated at 24 and 48 hpi by MTT assay and Annexin V binding assay, respectively. A significant (po0.05) reduction in cell metabolic activity was found in IBV infected CEK cells, compared with mock infected cells, both at 24 and 48 hpi ( Fig. 2A) . A significantly (po0.05) greater level of apoptosis was also found in IBV infected CEK cells at 24 and 48 h after virus infection (Fig. 2B) . Total apoptotic cells in IBV or mock infected TOCs were evaluated by TUNEL assay (Fig. 3) . It was found that IBV infection resulted in significant increase in total apoptotic cells in TOCs when compared with mock infected controls at 24 and 48 hpi (Fig. 3C) . Notably, infection of CEK cells with IBV strains 885 and QX resulted in significantly (po0.05) greater level of cell death, as shown by reduced metabolic activity ( Fig. 2A ) and increased apoptosis (Fig. 2B ) when compared to M41 infected cells both at 24 and 48 hpi. In contrast, significantly higher levels of apoptosis were observed in M41 infected TOCs compared with those infected with 885 or QX (Fig. 2C) . Infection with IBV strains 885 or QX resulted in significantly (po0.05) lower infectious virus production from CEK cells at 24 and 48 hpi when compared with M41 infected cells (Fig. 2D ). In sharp contrast, significantly (po0.05) lower infectious virus production was observed from M41 infected TOCs compared with 885 or QX infected TOCs (Fig. 2E ). CEK cells were infected with IBV strains 885, QX, M41 or mock infected at a MOI of 1.0, and expression of LGP2, MDA, TLR1, TLR2, TLR3 and TLR7 were analysed at 9 and 24 hpi. It was observed that expression of LGP2 (Fig. 4A ) and MDA5 (Fig. 4B ) was significantly upregulated at 9 hpi but down-regulated at 24 hpi in IBV infected CEK cells compared with mock infected cells (po0.05). However, at 9 hpi, infection with IBV strains 885 and QX resulted in significantly (po0.05) greater MDA5 expression than M41 in CEK cells (Fig. 4B ). There was no significant change in expression level of TLR1 (Fig. 4C ). TLR2 (Fig. 4D ) was observed at 9 hpi (po0.05), but the expression of these genes was significantly (po0.05) down-regulated at 24 hpi in IBV infected CEK cells, compared to mock infected cells ( Fig. 4C and D) . A significant (po0.05) up-regulation of TLR3 expression was detected at 9 hpi but compared with mock infected cells, was either unchanged or significantly (po0.05) down-regulated at 24 hpi in IBV infected CEK cells (Fig. 4E) . Interestingly, IBV strains 885 and QX infection resulted in significantly greater TLR3 expression than M41 infection in CEK cells at 9 hpi (Fig. 4E ). In summary, infection of CEK cells with IBV strains 885 and QX, compared with M41, resulted in significantly greater TLR3 and MDA5 expression in the early stage of infection (9 hpi).
