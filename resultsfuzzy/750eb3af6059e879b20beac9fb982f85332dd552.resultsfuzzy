The research outline of the study is described in Fig. 1A . Our analysis was based on the genome (mainly the coding sequences) of the E. coli host (A), the genome of bacteriophage lambda (B) and the ribo-seq measurements of these two (C). To assess the statistical significance of the signals found in the analysed viral genes and to exclude the possibility that these signals are un-direct consequences of other genomic properties, we compared them to signals expected by chance in the corresponding randomized variants (D); two different randomization models were employed: one that maintains the encoded proteins and the frequencies of pairs of adjacent nucleotides (dinucleotides), and the other that maintains the encoded proteins and the frequencies of synonymous codons (codon usage bias). Basing on the ribo-seq data, the expression levels of each gene at each time point (E), the relative decoding rate of each codon (F), and the classification of the bacteriophage genes to early and late (with respect to the beginning of the lytic phase) (G) were derived. On the basis of A, B, D, G, we performed synonymous codons usage analysis of coding regions in viral and E. coli genes (H) using the RSCF (I) and tRNA adaptation indexes (tAI) (J). On the basis of E, F, G, we analysed codons decoding rates for early/late genes at different stages of the viral development (L) on gene/genomic (M) and per-codon (N) levels. In addition, based on A, B, D, G, we studied the local and global signals of evolutionary selection for strong/weak mRNA folding (K) and for higher order synonymous information encoded in repetitive sequence motifs that are longer/more complex than single codons in the coding regions of the bacteriophage genes (O). The major aim of this study is to compare the properties of coding regions of bacteriophage early and late genes; thus, we start with a brief description of the expression pattern of these two gene groups. The analysis of ribo-seq read count per nucleotide for early and late groups of bacteriophage genes appears in Fig. 1B . As can be seen, at the first time point the read count of both groups is very low. Afterwards the expression levels of both gene groups increase; whilst the expression of the early gene group is dominant during minutes 1-10, the expression levels of the late group become dominant towards the 20th minute. Specifically, 32 of the bacteriophage genes are defined as early genes as their expression levels increase from 5 to 10 min, and then decrease by minute 20 after the beginning of the lytic process 9 ; the rest of the genes (34 genes) are define as late genes as their expression levels become significant only at minute 10 from the beginning of the lytic process, and then increase considerably by minute 20 (Fig. 1B and 9 ).
