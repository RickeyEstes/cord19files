A high prevalence of RVA associated with calf diarrhoea was observed in both groups: they were similarly (P = 0.495) detected in 21/38 (55.3%) and 28/43 (65.1%) diarrhoeic faecal samples from vaccinated and non-vaccinated herds, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the prevalence of rotaviruses in diarrhoeic calves from vaccinated and non-vaccinated herds. A large number of international studies have reported the prevalence of rotaviruses in diarrhoeic calves, but the use of vaccines against rotavirus is rarely documented, and we can assume that the majority of these studies certainly included calves from both vaccinated and non-vaccinated herds. Nevertheless, some of these studies aimed to determine the prevalence of rotaviruses in diarrhoeic calves from vaccinated or non-vaccinated herds. For example, studies from Italy [26] and Japan [27] reported different prevalences in non-vaccinated herds of 9.6% and 37%, respectively, which is lower than the prevalence of 65.1% reported here. Similarly, a slightly lower prevalence of rotavirus (45.1% vs. 55.3%) compared with the present study was reported in a previous study conducted during the late 90 s in the same region of France [28] in which more than 80% of the herds included were vaccinated. The high prevalence of RVA observed in the vaccinated herds was hardly surprising. Indeed, rotavirus vaccination of pregnant cows was not developed to completely prevent infection by these viruses but ideally to supply calves with anti-rotavirus specific antibodies to allow them to withstand the infectious pressure without developing clinical signs. Thus RVA could infect calves even in vaccinated herds and we can thus assume that diarrhoea in these calves involves other factors or pathogens. To identify these other pathogens, samples were screened for the presence of genogroup III noroviruses and neboviruses, which are rarely investigated routinely in neonatal calf diarrhoea. With detection rates of 36.8% (14/38) and 34.9% (15/43), the overall prevalence of these bovine caliciviruses was not significantly different (P = 1.000) in diarrhoeic calves from vaccinated and nonvaccinated herds, respectively. NoVsGIII were the most frequently detected bovine caliciviruses in this study, and were detected at similar rates (P = 1.000) of 31.6% (12/38) and 30.2% (13/43) in faecal samples from vaccinated and non-vaccinated herds, respectively. Moreover, sequence analyses revealed that genotype 2 NoVsGIII were more frequently detected than genotype 1 NoVsGIII in both groups (data not shown). Of note, the predominance of the genotype 2 NoVsGIII among bovine caliciviruses in French diarrhoeic calves has already been reported [15] but the vaccine status of the herds studied was unknown. Similar to NoVsGIII, nebovirus detection rates were similar (P = 1.000) in samples from vaccinated and non-vaccinated herds, with 5/38 (13.2%) and 5/43 (11.6%) positive samples, respectively. Sequence analyses showed that all the nebovirus strains from this study were closely related to the Nebraska/80/US reference strain (data not shown). Finally, the present study indicated that neboviruses and NoVsGIII, which are among the numerous pathogens responsible for calf diarrhoea, were not promoted in diarrhoeic calves from herds where the rotavirus vaccine was used. Nevertheless, other pathogens, notably bacteria and protozoa, should be investigated in order to better understand the aetiology of diarrhoea in calves from vaccinated dams. Genotyping of all the RVA positive samples showed that the G6 genotype clearly predominated in both groups with a prevalence of 90.5% in vaccinated herds and 89.3% in non-vaccinated herds ( Table 1 ). The G10 genotype co-circulated at low frequencies of 9.5% and 7.1% in vaccinated and non-vaccinated herds, respectively. Of note, the G genotype of one sample from a nonvaccinated herd could not be determined. Regarding VP4 protein, the most frequently detected genotype in the vaccinated and non-vaccinated herds was P [5] (76.2% and 89.3%, respectively), followed by P [11] (4.8% and 7.1%, respectively). The P genotype could not be assigned for four samples from vaccinated herds and one sample from non-vaccinated herds. Rotavirus strains G6P [5] noticeably predominated in the two groups of diarrhoeic calves studied, reaching a prevalence of 76.2% in vaccinated herds and 85.7% in non-vaccinated herds. Strains of genotypes G10P [11] were also detected but at low rates (4.8% and 7.1% in vaccinated and non-vaccinated herds, respectively). Only partial genotyping was achieved for four (19%) strains from vaccinated herds (3 G6 strains and 1 G10 strain) and for two (7.1%) strains from nonvaccinated herds (1 G6 strain and 1 P[5] strain). Of note, no rotavirus co-infection was observed in any group. These rotavirus genotyping results are in accordance with previous studies conducted in diarrhoeic calves in the same region during 2005-2007 [29] and thereafter (unpublished data). In these previous studies, although the rotavirus vaccine status of herds where samples were collected was not known, G6P [5] followed by G10P [11] strains also predominated, indicating the relative stability of rotavirus genotypes over time. Of note, the predominance of G6P [5] strains was also observed during the last decade in several parts of the world, notably in Australia [30] , Ireland [31] and Argentina [32] , highlighting the fact that G6P [5] are one of the most common rotavirus strains in cattle. In the present study, statistical analyses showed that there were no significant differences regarding G (P = 0.778), P (P = 0.275) or G/P (P = 0.457) genotype distribution between the two groups. These results suggested that in spite of the immune pressure due to long-term vaccination on farms using the selected vaccine, there was no selection of RVA genotypes. To the best of our knowledge, only one previous study compared RVA strains in diarrhoeic calves born to vaccinated and non-vaccinated dams [33] . In this study, conducted in Brazil in 2000-2001, the authors reported a different RVA strain distribution in calves from vaccinated and nonvaccinated herds. Notably, the P[1] genotype was not observed in calves from herds vaccinated with a commercially available G6P [1] (strain NCDV) vaccine whereas it was the most frequent genotype detected in non-vaccinated herds. These discrepant results may be partly explained by the different rotavirus vaccines used (strain UK-Compton G6P [5] in our study and strain NCDV G6P [1] in Brazil) and suggest that the impact on rotavirus genotypes circulating under immune pressure may be vaccine-dependent. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the partial VP7 and VP4 gene segments revealed that G6P [5] strains from this study did not segregate on separated branches according to their origin (i.e. from vaccinated/non-vaccinated herds). Considering that nucleotide and amino-acid phylogenetic analyses were in agreement and that the amino-acid analysis is more informative than the nucleotide analysis according to the purpose of this study (by indicating the existence of potential antigenic variants due to the use of vaccine), only the amino-acid analyses were presented ( Figs. 1 and 2) . Analysis of the partial VP7 gene segment indicated that all these G6P [5] strains were closely related to each other (Table 2) , with nucleotide and amino-acid identities between the two groups ranging from 94.3% to 100% and 95.8% to 100%, respectively. Furthermore, they were all closely related to the selected G6 lineage IV reference strain RVA/Cow-tc/GBR/UK/1973/G6P [5] , with high identities ranging from 93.5% to 95.3% (nucleotides) and 96.7% to 97.5% (amino-acids) for strains from vaccinated herds and from 93.6% to 95.4% (nucleotides) and 95.8% to 97.5% (amino-acids) for strains from non-vaccinated herds. Partial VP4 gene segment analysis confirmed the close relationship between G6P [5] strains from vaccinated and non-vaccinated herds (nucleotide identity: 91.8% to 100%, amino-acid identity: 95.4% to 100%), and also confirmed that they were closely related to the selected rotavirus reference strain RVA/Cow-tc/GBR/UK/1973/G6P [5] , with identities ranging from 88.6% to 90.5% (nucleotides) and 92.0% to 93.7% (aminoacids) for strains from vaccinated herds and from 88.4% to 90.7% (nucleotides) and 92.0% to 94.3% (amino-acids) for strains from non-vaccinated herds. Alignment and comparison of the deduced amino-acid sequences of the partial VP7 and VP4 coding genes from Table 1 Genotype distribution of rotavirus strains circulating in diarrhoeic calves from vaccinated and non-vaccinated herds. Specific amplification of genotypes G5, G6, G8, G10 and G11 and genotypes P [1] , P [5] -P [7] and P [11] was performed. Of note, genotypes G5, G8, G11, P [1] , P [6] and P [7] were not detected. G6P [5] strains did not reveal any major differences between strains from vaccinated and non-vaccinated herds (Figs. 3 and 4) . Actually, G6P [5] strains from this study showed several mutations mainly in the variable and major antigenic regions when compared with the RVA/Cow-tc/GBR/UK/1973/G6P [5] reference strain, but the large majority of these mutations was shared by strains from both vaccinated and non-vaccinated herds. Only three mutations involving three strains (one mutation per strain) from vaccinated herds and four mutations involving three strains (two strains with one mutation and one strain with three mutations) from non-vaccinated herds were not shared by the two groups based on the partial VP7 deduced amino-acid sequences (Fig. 3) . Regarding the partial VP4 deduced amino-acid sequences, only two mutations were exclusively observed in four strains (three strains with one identical mutation and one strain with another mutation) from vaccinated herds and four mutations were exclusively observed in two strains (two mutations per strain) from non-vaccinated herds (Fig. 4) . Finally, these further analyses performed on the G6P [5] strains from our study did not allow us to distinguish them according to their origin (i.e. from vaccinated/non-vaccinated herds). This suggested that in addition to not promoting selection of RVA genotypes, the studied G6P [5] vaccine did not promote the emergence of G6P [5] variants on the farms where vaccination was used. Nevertheless, the complete genome analysis of these strains should be undertaken in order to better assess the impact of the vaccine on rotavirus circulating strains. Interestingly, coinfections by caliciviruses and rotaviruses occurred and were similarly observed in both groups (P = 0.788), with an occurrence of 21.1% (8/38) in samples from vaccinated herds and 18.6% (8/43) in samples from non-vaccinated herds. This fairly high prevalence of coinfections by these viruses observed in our study illustrated the fact that calf diarrhoea is a disease involving several infectious agents in co-circulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to describe both RVA and bovine calicivirus prevalence in faecal samples from diarrhoeic calves. Although the prevalence of bovine caliciviruses was lower than that of RVA, it was significant, raising the hypothesis that these viruses could be included in vaccines in order to prevent calf diarrhoea as efficiently as possible.
