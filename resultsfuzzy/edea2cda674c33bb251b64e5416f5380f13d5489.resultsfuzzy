We focused our validation efforts on Trim55, the single HrS1 candidate and a member of the TRIM protein superfamily which has not previously been associated with any infectious disease phenotype. Although many TRIM proteins function in innate immunity and inflammation, Trim55 (also known as muscle-specific RING finger 2 or Murf2) has only been studied in the context of muscle development and cardiac function [40, 41] . Trim55 is expressed in smooth muscle surrounding blood vessels [42] , an appropriate location to influence perivascular cuffing phenotypes. Knockout mice on a C57BL/6J background have previously been reported [43] and were kindly made available to our laboratory. Groups of age matched Trim55 -/and C57BL/6J control mice were infected with 10 5 PFU of MA15 for four days and monitored daily for weight loss and signs of disease. Trim55 -/and C57BL/6J animals had similar weight loss profiles as well as similar viral loads in the lung at day four post infection (Fig 5A and 5B ) and no differences in mortality. Hematoxylin and eosin stained lung sections showed significantly reduced vascular cuffing in the lungs of Trim55 -/-(mean score of 0.69) compared to control animals (mean score of 1.15) (p < 0.05 by students t test, Fig 5C) , confirming the role of Trim55 in contributing to SARS-CoV-induced vascular cuffing. Additional mice were infected for flow cytometric analysis of inflammatory cell populations in the lung after MA15 infection. While we observed a general trend towards increased numbers of T cells, B cells and macrophages in the lungs of C57BL/6J control mice compared to the Trim55 -/mice, only monocyte numbers were significantly different between the two groups. Total monocytes, as well as the subset of Ly6C positive monocytes, were present in significantly higher numbers in the lungs of infected control mice compared to Trim55 -/mice ( Fig 5D) . RNA was isolated from the lungs of mock and infected control and Trim55 -/mice at two and days four post infection. 168 genes were identified as differentially expressed (DE, log2 fold change >2 relative to mock) between the two strains, predominantly at day two post infection (GEO accession GSE64660). We then used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software to identify functionally enriched gene categories. This analysis identified the granulocyte and agranulocyte diapedesis gene ontology categories as among the most significantly enriched (first and third respectively) from genes with DE between Trim55 -/and B6 controls (Fig 6A) . Diapedesis, or extravasation, is the process by which inflammatory monocytes and leukocytes bind to endothelial cells and migrate from the blood stream into surrounding injured tissues. The transcriptional analysis indicates decreased expression of tight junction genes and increased chemokine expression in C57BL/6J mice compared to that observed in Trim55 -/mice. Relative expression of genes involved in granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis at days two and four post infection is shown in Fig 6B and 6C .
