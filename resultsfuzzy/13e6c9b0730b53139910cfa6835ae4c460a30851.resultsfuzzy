Foxp3 gfp mice were infected with rJ2.2 and examined for the presence of Foxp3 + T reg cells. The frequency of Foxp3 + T reg cells was 20-30% at 3 and 5 d after infection, decreasing to <10% of total CD4 T cells in the brain and spinal cord by 7 d after infection (Fig. 1 A) . The decrease in frequency by day 7 did not reflect a lower rate of proliferation because similar fractions of T reg cells and non-T reg CD4 T cells incorporated BrdU at 6 d after infection (Fig. 1 B) . Rather, it likely reflects recruitment of virus-nonspecific T reg cells into the CNS at early stages of the infection. We previously showed that virus-specific effector CD4 and CD8 T cells were detected in the infected brain at 6-7 d after infection (Haring et al., 2001) . MHC class II/peptide tetramers are available for detecting epitope M133-specific CD4 T cells, and using these tetramers, we also detected M133-specific T reg cells in the brain and spinal cord at 7 d after infection (Fig. 1 , C and E). Furthermore, M133-specific T reg cells were present in the infected CNS until at least 49 d after infection. M133-specific T reg cells were not routinely detected above background in draining cervical LNs (CLNs) or spleen (unpublished data). Staining with M133 tetramer was specific because no positive cells were detected in mice infected with an rJ2.2 variant in which the epitope was mutated, abrogating recognition (rJ.2.2.M Y135Q ; Fig. 1 D; Anghelina et al., 2006) .
