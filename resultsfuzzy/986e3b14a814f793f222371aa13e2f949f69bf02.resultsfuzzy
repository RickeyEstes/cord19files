After having established that OSBP and, possibly, ORP4 are novel targets of ITZ, we wanted to study how ITZ targets these proteins. Because of available tools, we focused on OSBP for the remainder of this study. In line with published data (Burgett et al., 2011) , OSW-1 caused a massive recruitment of overexpressed GFP-OSBP to the Golgi apparatus (as marked by staining endogenous PI4KIIIb) ( Figure 4A) . A similar relocalization was observed for endogenous OSBP ( Figure 4B ). ITZ and posaconazole, but not the azoles that lacked antiviral activity, redistributed OSBP in a manner that is similar to OSW-1. Live-cell imaging was performed to study the dynamics of GFP-OSBP relocalization by the compounds. Before addition of the compounds, GFP-OSBP primarily localized in the cytosol with a Golgi pattern faintly visible. A few minutes after the addition of the compounds, (C) HAP1 cells were treated for 6 hr with 10 nM OSW-1 or 10 mM ITZ, fixed, and stained with filipin. (D) HeLa R19 cells were transfected with constructs encoding OSBP or EGFP (negative control) for 24 hr, infected with RLuc-CVB3 at MOI 0.25 or EV71 at MOI 1, and treated with 10 mM (CVB3) or 3 mM (EV71) ITZ, 3 nM OSW-1, or DMSO. Renilla luciferase levels were determined at 7 hr p.i. (CVB3) or virus titers at 10 hr p.i. were determined by endpoint titration (EV71). (E) HeLa R19 cells were transfected with siRNAs against OSBP, PI4KIIIb (positive control), or a scrambled siRNA for 2 days and infected with CVB3, EV71, or HRV2 at MOI 1. Virus titers at 10 hr p.i. were determined by endpoint titration. Knockdown efficiency was determined by quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence ( Figure S5 ), and an MTS assay was used to test for effects on cell viability. (C) HeLa R19 cells were transfected with GFP-OSBP and treated with DMSO, 10 mM of ITZ, or 10 nM OSW-1, and the relocalization of OSBP was imaged by livecell confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cells were imaged overnight. During the first 30 min, images were taken as fast as possible (1.5 min intervals), then intervals were stepwise increased to 30 min from 3.5 hr onward. Representative groups of cells are shown. The images are frames from Movie S1. (D) Quantification of the relative GFP-OSBP signal at the Golgi apparatus in five cells for each condition from (C). Error bars indicate SEM. Scale bar corresponds to 10 mm. See also Movie S1. (legend on next page) GFP-OSBP fluorescence at the Golgi was clearly increased in cells treated with either ITZ or OSW-1 and continued to increase at the expense of the cytoplasmic signal ( Figures 4C and 4D ; Movie S1). OSW-1 was previously reported to disrupt the structure of the Golgi apparatus (Burgett et al., 2011) , which we also observed from 30 to 60 min onward as GFP-positive punctae that became more numerous over time ( Figure 4C ). In ITZtreated cells, the Golgi pattern became affected only hours later and appeared less dispersed than that in OSW-1 treated cells.
