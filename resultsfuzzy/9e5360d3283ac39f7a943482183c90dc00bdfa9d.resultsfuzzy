Combination experiments were performed in HuH6 replicon-containing cells in which replicon replication is largely independent of cell proliferation. This is important since the reference drugs 2 0 -C-MeCyt and ribavirin, at the concentrations used, inhibit host cell proliferation. GS-327073 was combined (in checkerboard format) with either IFNa 2b, VX-950, ribavirin or 2 0 -C-MeCyt, and data were analyzed using the method of Prichard and Shipman [59] . Each combination resulted overall in an additive antiviral activity (Fig. 3) . A slight synergistic effect was observed when GS-327073 was combined with low concentrations of IFNa 2b.
