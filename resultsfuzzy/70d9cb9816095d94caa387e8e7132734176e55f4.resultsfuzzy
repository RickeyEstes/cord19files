Antibacterial capacity of anatase-TiO 2 photocatalyst nanoparticles and defective TiOx photocatalyst thin film To determine the antibacterial capacity of the defective TiO x photocatalyst thin film (glass substrate) we used anatase-TiO 2 nanoparticles with 40 mm diameter as a reference. Both samples were illuminated by four 15-W UV lamps. The results are shown in Figure 5 . The survival rate of and the ABI of the samples can be obtained from Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. The survival rate of E. coli on defective photocatalyst thin film was 49.3% (ABI of 1.3) after being exposed for 1 hour; that is, only 50.7% of E. coli would be restrained. The survival rate of E. coli on anatase-TiO 2 nanoparticles was 57% (ABI of 1.7). That is to say, the antibacterial performance rate of defective TiO x thin film is about 1.17-fold that of the anatase-TiO 2 nanoparticle after 1 hour. However, 3 hours later both samples reached the same survival rate of 3%. After 5 hours the value was below 0.01%; thus the antibacterial performance rate was above 99.99% for both samples. In contrast, the survival rate of bacteria in the dark field was 92%, for both samples at any time. Thus we proved that the defective photocatalyst thin film has the same antibacterial ability as the anatase-TiO 2 nanoparticle.
