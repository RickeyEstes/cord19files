Using the estimated parameter values and the number of cumulative cases T (t), the effective daily reproduction ratio R e (t) can be calculated ( Figure 5 ). The result demonstrates that R e (t) has dropped sharply from 3.34 (R e (1) = 3.34) on January 20th to 0.89 (R e (12) = 0.89, less than 1) on January 31st, 2020, which implies that the integrated control strategies implemented in mainland China excluding Hubei has successfully reduced transmission intensity and prevented the epidemic growth in a short time frame. ⟨ Figure 4 is near here ⟩ Under the current rigorous integrated control and self-protection measures, the time series of T (t) depicted in Figure 4 (a) shows that the cumulative number of confirmed cases will continue growing slowly for some duration and tend to its predicted maximum, which is 13155. Besides, although the number of hospitalized individuals has peaked on around February 12th, 2020, but it will not shrink to zero in the near future (Figure 4 (c) ). Obviously, new infections would occur as long as the infectious individuals who have not been detected exist once people start relieve self-isolation and protection. It is the number of undetected infectious individuals that determines when people's lives are able to return back to normal. Hence we should closely follow the total number of I(t) and R(t). Figure 4 (d) displays that the number of infectious individuals has been decreasing gradually since the end of January. However, it will not descent down to 1 until late March, which infers that people should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep personal protect before April. ⟨ Figure 5 is near here ⟩ Using the estimated parameter values and the expression of the effective reproduction ratio R e (t), the threshold value of the intervention coefficient with respect to contact, q 1 , can be calculated, which is 0.3. This implies that in order to block the continuous spread of the virus, the value of q 1 must be less than 0.3 to guarantee R e (t) is below 1. In other words, the contact rate should be kept below 30% of the normal level. To examine the impact of partial lifting control measures on disease transmission, we plot the predicted time series of the number of cumulative confirmed cases, T (t), and the number of the infectious individuals, I(t)+A(t), with different contact rates ( Figure 6 ). Assuming that the adjusting time is from March 5th, 2020, Figure 6 (a) and (b) illustrate that contact rate with 20% of the initial value c 0 will not cause the disease re-bounce. However, the epidemic period will be extended for about 40 days until early May and the cumulative number of confirmed cases will increase by around 0.5% to 13227. While if the starting time of the adjusting is postponed to March 20th, the epidemic time of disease will be extended for about one week and the cumulative number of confirmed cases will increase by only around 0.05% to 13161, compared with the scenario of no changes. Nevertheless, if the contact rate is half of the initial value, i.e. q 1 = 0.5 and R e (t) = 1.68, COVID-19 will re-bounce All rights reserved.
