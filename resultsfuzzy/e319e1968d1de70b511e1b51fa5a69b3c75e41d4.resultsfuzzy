The infiltration of blood leukocytes into the CNS of CCR2 -/-, CCR2 -/-!WT, WT!CCR2 -/and WT mice was evaluated by flow cytometry analyses prior to (day 0) and on days 4, 6, 8 and 10 following infection with HSV-1. In our study, the expression levels of CD45 and CD11b were used to distinguish «CD45 low /CD11b + » from «CD45 hi /CD11b + » cells which were attributed to resident microglia and infiltrating leukocytes, respectively (Fig 6A) . Infiltrating monocytes were further differentiated according to Ly6C expression level into «Ly6C hi » inflammatory and «Ly6C low » patrolling monocytes, respectively. Fig 6B shows that in the WT group, 11.3%±0.9 of all brain leukocytes (i.e., CD45 + ) expressed the «CD45 hi » marker on day 0 and were attributed to infiltrating immune cells. This percentage significantly increased on days 6 (38.0%±4.3; P<0.001 (not indicated)) and 8 (28.2%±4.5; P<0.001 (not indicated)) and then almost returned to the baseline on day 10 (16.7%±4.2) p.i. In WT!CCR2 -/mice, the infiltration kinetic of blood leukocytes was almost similar to that of WT on days 4 and 6 but continued to increase on day 8 (44.9%±6.2; P<0.001 (not indicated)) and then decreased on day 10 p.i. (25.5%±7.5; P<0.05 (not indicated)) compared to their counterparts sacrificed on day 0. This increase was also significant compared to WT group on day 8 p.i. (P<0.01, Fig 6B) . Levels of «CD45 hi » cells were increased on day 6 p.i. in CCR2 -/group (from 8.9%±1.4 on day 0 to 24.5%±4.6; P<0.001 (not indicated)) and CCR2 -/-!WT mice (from 12.6%±1.6 to 31.8%±8.3; P<0.001 (not indicated)). Levels decreased on day 8 for both CCR2 -/-(21.5%±2.0; P<0.001 (not indicated)) and CCR2 -/-!WT (24.1%±3.4; P<0.001 (not indicated)) to reach baseline levels on day 10 p.i. Importantly, these levels were significantly lower than that of WT group on day 6 (P<0.01 for CCR2 -/and P<0.01 for CCR2 -/-!WT) and then decreased to similar levels as WT on days 8 and 10 p.i. Overall, our results indicate that the lack of CCR2 signaling pathway throughout the body and more specifically in the hematopoietic compartment alters the infiltration of blood leukocytes into the CNS during HSE. Fig 6C shows that levels of «Ly6C hi » inflammatory monocytes in WT mice were slightly increased on day 4 (from 1.3%±0.1 on day 0 to 1.7%±0.4) and were significantly higher on days 6 (11.5%±2.2; P<0.001 (not indicated)) and 8 (6.8%±0.9; P<0.01 (not indicated)) following infection. Their amount then decreased on day 10 p.i. to reach baseline level (1.7%±0.2). The infiltration kinetic of «Ly6C hi » monocytes in WT!CCR2 -/mice was similar to that of WT but levels were slightly higher than WT on day 6 without reaching statistical significance. Levels of «Ly6C hi » monocytes also increased on day 6 p.i. in CCR2 -/-(from 1.0%±0.1 prior to infection to 5.9%±1.7; P<0.001 (not indicated)) and CCR2 -/-!WT (from 1.3%±0.5 to 3.8% ±1.0; P<0.05 (not indicated)). Their amounts then decreased on days 8 and 10 following infection to reach baseline levels. Importantly, the amounts of inflammatory monocytes were significantly lower in CCR2 -/-(P<0.01) and CCR2 -/-!WT (P<0.001) animals on day 6 and in CCR2 -/-!WT (P<0.01) on day 8 p.i. than those of WT group. Globally, these data suggest that a complete CCR2 deficiency, and particularly that in the hematopoietic compartment, results in a lack of inflammatory monocytes infiltration, which could alter the immune response to HSV-1 infection. Fig 6D shows that in WT mice, «Ly6C low » patrolling monocytes invaded the CNS on day 6 p.i. (from 2.3%±0.2 on day 0 to 3.5%±0.3; P<0.05 (not indicated)) and reached a peak level on day 8 (5.1%±0.7; P<0.001 (not indicated)) to finally decrease on day 10 (1.7%±0.5) p.i. This infiltration pattern is in line with previous studies from our laboratory showing the delayed infiltration of this monocyte subset during HSE [26] . Earlier (day 6) and higher levels of patrolling monocytes were observed in the CNS of CCR2 -/-(4.7%±0.4; P<0.05) and CCR2 -/-!WT (5.2%±0.5; P<0.01) mice compared to WT. On day 8 following infection, levels decreased significantly in these groups (P<0.01 for CCR2 -/and P<0.001 for CCR2 -/-!WT) compared to WT mice to reach baseline amounts on day 10. Levels of patrolling monocytes in WT!CCR2 -/mice were slightly higher than those of WT on day 8 p.i. but the difference did not reach statistical significance. These data suggest that patrolling monocytes trafficking appears to be influenced by CCR2 deficiency localized in the hematopoietic system.
