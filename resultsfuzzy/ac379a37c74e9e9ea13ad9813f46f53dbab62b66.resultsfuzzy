Estimates from the initial set of models, described below, indicated multiple possible thresholds for population density. The point estimate of the threshold in model (1), described in the methods section below, was 19,067 PPSM (people per square mile), for which only one district, Calcutta, lay above the threshold (see the table in the Appendix). The results from this model suggest that Calcutta, the most densely populated district in British India, with a population density of 35,025 PPSM, is an outlier. Therefore, Calcutta was removed from the dataset and the subsequent analyses were conducted The results for datasets containing the Calcutta outlier in the Appendix are broadly consistent with the results presented in the paper. Table 2 contains the parameter estimates for the models without the Calcutta outlier. These models indicated the presence of two discrete intervals of possible threshold values. Therefore, we present two models (columns 1 and 2) corresponding to the threshold value of population density that minimized the threshold test statistic in each interval (Figure 1 ). Figure 1 and Column 1 in Table 2 shows the results of the threshold estimation procedure from model (1) . The point estimate of the threshold value of population density was 175 PPSM. At the 5% level of significance, a discontinuous set of threshold values that could not be rejected was obtained, corresponding to the intervals 148-209 and 381-464 PPSM (see Figure 1 ). These ranges are analogous to a 95% confidence interval. The alternate threshold estimates, presented in Column 2 in Table 2 , represent values of the threshold that (a) cannot be rejected at the 5% level of significance and (b) yield the minimum threshold test statistic over the alternate range of contiguous possible (in the sense that they cannot be rejected) threshold values within which they occur. In this case, the point estimate is 435 PPSM, which produced the lowest test statistic for the 381-464 PPSM interval (see Figure 1 ). An important characteristic of the threshold estimation procedure is the ability to simultaneously test for differences in population loss between below-threshold and above-threshold districts. Interestingly, the difference between low-density and high-density districts is large. For the 175 PPSM threshold, below-threshold districts experienced a population growth rate of −3.72% between 1918 and 1919, while above-threshold districts experienced a growth rate of −4.69%, for a net difference of 0.97%. This difference is, moreover, statistically significant, as denoted by the significance of the parameter estimate for β 30. For the 435 PPSM threshold, the corresponding figures are −3.51%, −5.85%, and 2.31% respectively. In the above models, district-specific intercepts and coefficients on the time trend were also estimated. The intercepts correspond to the logarithm of district-specific population in 1891 and the coefficients on the time trend correspond to the annual rate of population growth. Because of the large number of estimates (198 each), these are not reported in Table 2 . Figures 2 and 3 are a spatial illustration of the relationship between population density and influenzaattributable population loss. Figure 2 is a map of India that contrasts the districts that are above and below the estimated population density threshold. Figure 3 is a map of the districts arranged by quintile of population loss using estimates computed in Chandra et al. [7] . In general, the coastal areas and Gangetic plain of India show coinciding areas of above-threshold population density and high rates of population loss.
