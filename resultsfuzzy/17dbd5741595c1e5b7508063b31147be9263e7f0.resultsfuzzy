The observation that amino acid substitutions in nsp6 confer K22 resistance strongly suggests a mode-of-action based on interference with host cell membranes required for coronavirus replication. Nsp6 is expressed as a membrane-spanning integral component of the viral replication complex, and is, together with nsp3 and nsp4, implicated in anchoring the coronavirus replicase complex to DMVs or related membrane structures [9] , [36] , [37] , [39] , [43] . Indeed, there is genetic and experimental evidence concerning nsp4-mediated alterations of coronavirus DMVs [44] , [45] , and that ectopic expression of nsp6 results in the formation of ER-derived vesicles [46] . We therefore assessed if K22 may impact the formation of coronavirus-induced DMV by electron microscopy ( Figure 4 ). As expected, perinuclear DMV clusters as well as viral particles were readily detectable in wt HCoV-229E-infected cells ( Figure 4A ). In sharp contrast, no DMV clusters or viral particles were detectable in wt HCoV-229E-infected and K22treated (4 mM) cells ( Figure 4A ). Since double-stranded (ds) RNA is indicative of coronavirus replication and has been shown to reside predominantly within the inner lumen of coronavirus-induced DMVs [32] we also performed immunofluorescence analysis and stained HCoV-229E-infected cells for viral replicase complex (nsp8) and dsRNA. Strikingly, the characteristic perinuclear immunofluorescence staining pattern for viral replicase complexes and dsRNA visible in wt HCoV-229E-infected cells was completely absent under K22 treatment ( Figure 5 ), confirming the remarkable efficacy of K22-mediated inhibition of viral replication and supporting the notion that K22 blocks the formation of DMVs. In contrast to parental wt HCoV-229E and irrespectively whether K22 was applied, recombinant K22 escape mutants were still capable of inducing the formation of DMVs ( Figure 4B ) and displayed the characteristic staining pattern for replicase complexes and dsRNA ( Figure 5 ). Likewise, compound J15 efficiently blocked replication ( Figure S1B ) and DMV formation of wt HCoV-229E but not K22 resistant nsp6 recombinant HCoV-229E M159V ( Figure S3 ) suggesting that J15 may have the same target and mode-of-action. Notably, in cells infected with K22 escape mutants the overall number of DMVs per cell was reduced (30.3629.7 in HCoV-229E M159V versus 65650.1 in wt HCoV-229E infected cells; P,0.05; n = 20), similar as previously described for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp4 mutants [44] , [45] , while the number of intracellular viral particles that were often packed in tubular vesicle-like structures ( Figures 4A-B ) was comparable to that of wt virus (471.86212.6 in HCoV-229E M159V versus 438.3696.8 in wt virus infected cells; n = 10). We could also frequently detect DMVs displaying partially collapsed inner membranes in cells infected with K22 escape mutants (irrespectively whether or not K22 was applied; Figure 4B ), again similarly as reported for MHV nsp4 mutants [45] , suggesting that nsp6, like nsp4, has a pivotal role in coronavirus DMV formation. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the antiviral activity of K22 (and that of the structurally similar compound J15) results in complete loss of DMVs. This efficient block in replication can be overcome by resistance
