GQDs used in this study had a diameter of 2-8 nm 15 and carried nine carboxyl edge-groups on average. (Figure S1 ) To investigate how GQDs affect amyloid-rich biofilms, S. aureus biofilms were grown in peptone-NaCl-glucose (PNG) media for four days in flow cells. 32 S. aureus biofilms were also grown in tryptic soy broth supplemented with glucose (TSBG) media that inhibits amyloid synthesis as a negative control. Confocal images showed that S. aureus formed biofilm covering the entire surface of the flow cell in both TSBG and PNG without GQDs (Figure 1a, d) . In the presence of 50 μg/mL GQDs, the biofilm grown on PNG was largely dispersed whereas the biofilm on TSBG retained its structure (Figure 1b, e) . A further dispersion of biofilm structure occurred in the presence of 500 μg/mL GQDs in PNG condition, while TSBG biofilm remaining fully present (Figure 1c, f) . According to quantitative image analysis, porosity of the PNG biofilm ( Figure 1g ) increased from 29.4 ± 8.8% to 50.7 ± 6.9% when cultured with 50 μg/mL GQDs; the porosity further increased to 63.4 ± 5.0% for 500 μg/mL GQDs. The thickness of the PNG biofilm ( Figure 1h ) decreased from 21.9 ± 2.5 μm to 16.9 ± 3.4 μm when cultured with 50 μg/mL GQDs; the thickness further decreased to 12.7 ± 3.4 μm with 500 μg/mL GQDs. The thickness for biofilms grown in TSBG media showed limited change with addition of any dose of GQDs ( Figure S2 ). All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Here the change in porosity of the PNG biofilm is even more distinct than that in confocal microscopy, which increased to 71.2 ± 6.6 % (Figure 1k) . This is likely a result of dehydration process required for SEM sample preparation, which washed off weakly attached bacterial cells and loose ECM content. The phenomenon not only confirmed the increase of biofilm porosity after GQD treatment but also indicated reduced integrity of remaining biomass. Of note, the growth rate of planktonic S. aureus did not differ significantly with or without GQDs up to 200 μg/mL ( Figure S3 ). This observation indicates that the GQDs are not toxic to the individual bacteria cells per se, and thus the biofilm dispersal is associated with change in ECM integrity only. Furthermore, the specificity for the GQD effect on PNG grown biofilm versus the TSBG biofilm suggests that amyloid is the unique target of GQDs among other components of the ECM. All rights reserved.
