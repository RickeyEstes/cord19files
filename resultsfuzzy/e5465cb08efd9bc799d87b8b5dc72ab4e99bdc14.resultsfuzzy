changes in the mechanical properties of the lungs, which may affect both the tidal and maximal flowvolume curves. 86 5. Evaluation of expiratory flow limitation has also been studied by comparison of tidal flow-volume curves with partial flow-volume curves, thereby keeping the previous volume history constant. Although theoretically appealing, this approach often neglects the effect of the previous time history (which affects both partial and maximal forced flow-volume curves) 89,92 and is not practical in most patients with COPD at rest, let alone during exercise. Thus it appears that study of expiratory flow limitation on the basis of comparison of tidal with maximal flowvolume curves can be problematic. An alternative approach, called the negative expiratory pressure method, has been developed by Koulouris and associates 93 (eFig. . This method does not require flow-volume maneuvers by the subject, nor must it be performed in a body plethysmograph. A negative pressure is applied at the mouth during a tidal expiration, and the ensuing expiratory flow-volume curve is compared with that of the previous control tidal expiration. With this method the volume and time history of the control and test breath are the same. The negative expiratory pressure method has been validated in mechanically ventilated patients by direct comparison with isovolume pressure-flow curves. 94 It has also been used to study stable COPD patients at rest and during exercise. 95, 96 Ninane and associates 97 have offered another approach to the technical issues associated with comparing tidal breathing with maximal flow curves. They described a method to detect expiratory flow limitation by manual compression of the abdominal wall. In healthy subjects, abdominal compression causes decreased abdominal diameter, increased gastric and pleural pressures, and increased expiratory flow. This method has been used successfully to study expiratory flow limitation in neonates, but in adults with COPD abdominal compression fails to increase expiratory flow despite increased gastric and pleural pressures. 97 Protocol. The single-breath nitrogen washout test (sometimes called the single-breath oxygen test) is designed to assess the uniformity of gas distribution in the lungs and the behavior of the dependent airways. 101 At present the most clinically useful aspect of the test is the measurement of the slope of phase III (alveolar gas plateau) to determine the uniformity of gas distribution. The subject inspires a single breath of pure oxygen from RV to TLC (inspiratory VC maneuver); nitrogen concentration at the mouth during exhalation is measured with a nitrogen analyzer or mass spectrometer. At end-inspiration, the dead space is filled with oxygen that has just been inspired (see eFig. . At the beginning of the subsequent expiratory VC maneuver, the nitrogen meter continues to record 0% nitrogen, because the first gas to leave the lungs is from conducting airways-the so-called anatomic dead space (phase I) (see eFig. . Subsequently, the nitrogen concentration increases in a sigmoid curve upward and reflects mixing of gas from dead space and alveoli (phase II). The slightly sloping plateau in phase III reflects the almost constant nitrogen concentration in alveolar gas. If inspired oxygen is distributed evenly to all alveoli so each has the same nitrogen concentration, then phase III of the nitrogen tracing is almost horizontal (alveolar plateau). However, if inspired oxygen is distributed unevenly (as happens to a small extent even in healthy subjects), then the end-inspiratory nitrogen concentrations are not equal throughout the lung. The concentrations of exhaled nitrogen from different alveoli are not recorded as a horizontal line; the first portion of phase III usually contains a lower nitrogen concentration than the last portion. The analysis of these curves is not entirely objective. When the same observer reads such curves twice under "blind" conditions, agreement between the two measurements is poor. This variability appears to be due to differences between individual lungs; when a subject generates such a curve, usually all curves produced by that subject are difficult to analyze. On the other hand, if a subject generates a curve that is easy to analyze, most curves produced by that subject are reproducible. Obviously, analysis of these curves requires good judgment; some curves, although conforming to the criteria of acceptability, are unreadable and therefore should be ignored. It appears difficult, if not impossible, at present to establish a uniform set of criteria for this analysis. 102 Normal Values. The slope of phase III (percentage of nitrogen per liter) is determined as the line of best fit (by least-squares linear regression) between 70% of VC and the onset of phase IV. In most cases, the range about the mean of three measurements of the slope of phase III should not be greater than ±0.5% N 2 /L. 103 The variations appear to be independent of the time of day at which the test is performed, but the slope of phase III does depend on inspiratory flow. 104 The TLC measured by the single-breath nitrogen test correlates well with that measured by helium dilution in a population of men and women free from abnormalities of gas distribution, for both smokers and nonsmokers with and without symptoms. 103 As expected, the measurement of TLC underestimates lung volume in patients with airway obstruction. 6, 103 Other Tests The methods just described use the resident-gas technique. Similar measurements made by bolus techniques and resident-gas techniques have been compared, and they show either close similarities in results or a systematic tendency for measurements of phase IV determined by the resident-gas technique to be slightly lower than those determined by the bolus technique. 105 Other methods used to assess uniformity of distribution of ventilation include measurement of residual nitrogen following multiple-breath, open-circuit nitrogen washout 106 and determination of helium mixing time during closedcircuit equilibration. In the multiple-breath nitrogen washout, for example, continuous breath-by-breath measurement of nitrogen concentration at the mouth during tidal breathing of pure oxygen is performed until end-tidal nitrogen concentration falls to less than 1%. The fall in endtidal nitrogen concentration on a breath-by-breath basis is related to the cumulative volume of ventilation or breath number. By extending the nitrogen washout time to 30 minutes or more in subjects with severe chronic airway obstruction, estimates of lung volume may be obtained that compare favorably with those calculated by plethysmographic or radiographic methods. 107 Exponential analysis of the end-tidal nitrogen concentration with time, cumulative ventilation, or breath number reveals that in normal subjects nitrogen concentration decreases in a single exponential curve. In the presence of uneven distribution of ventilation, the curve can be described by two or more exponentials. This analysis can be extended to estimate the size of poorly ventilated regions of the lung, but these multiple-breath tests are cumbersome and time-consuming, may have no anatomic correlates, and cannot be repeated rapidly (i.e., until all the added oxygen is washed out). With the advent of rapidly acting infrared analyzers in commercial pulmonary function equipment, in which various filters are used in conjunction with an infrared analyzer to analyze methane, carbon monoxide, and acetylene to measure diffusing capacity and pulmonary blood flow, the opportunity has developed to assess distribution of ventilation using added inert gases, such as methane. The principle is the same as that for resident gases, but the modeling and mathematics are slightly altered. Reference equations have been published for values expected in healthy normal subjects. 108, 109 all practical purposes (unless the test is repeated frequently over a short time). Molecules of carbon monoxide diffuse across the membrane, dissolve in the plasma, and then combine with hemoglobin. Carbon monoxide has a high affinity for hemoglobin, 210 times that of oxygen; thus carbon monoxide in the vicinity of a hemoglobin molecule binds avidly to it, and the partial pressure of dissolved carbon monoxide remains very low. Except in a patient with severe anemia, the available binding sites for carbon monoxide are so numerous that they cannot be saturated by the number of carbon monoxide molecules that diffuse from the air spaces to the capillary blood at the low concentrations of carbon monoxide used in the test. Therefore carbon monoxide transfer is not limited by pulmonary blood flow; instead, it is limited primarily by the alveolar-capillary diffusion rate and, to a lesser extent, by the red blood cell membrane diffusion rate and the chemical reaction rate between hemoglobin and carbon monoxide. The carbon monoxide transfer therefore can be considered a measure of the capillary surface area available for gas exchange. In contrast, gases such as Freon, nitrous oxide, and acetylene are equally soluble in lung tissues and blood because they do not combine chemically with blood components. These gases diffuse across the alveolar-capillary membranes and quickly saturate the plasma; further diffusion is prevented until fresh blood enters the pulmonary capillaries. Thus these gases can be used to estimate pulmonary capillary blood flow to ventilated lung units. There are some important differences in the transfer of carbon monoxide and oxygen. Both plasma and hemoglobin contain oxygen (but not carbon monoxide) when mixed venous blood enters the pulmonary capillaries. The rate of oxygen diffusion into blood depends on the alveolarcapillary PO 2 difference. As oxygen crosses the alveolarcapillary membranes, capillary PO 2 increases, narrows the alveolar-capillary PO 2 difference, and slows diffusion. Thus, before calculating a diffusing capacity for oxygen, blood PO 2 must be known at every point along the capillary and can be obtained by a combination of certain measurements and mathematical computations. 115 Carbon Monoxide Methods for Clinical Measurement of Pulmonary Diffusing Capacity. The DL CO is calculated as follows: To determine the amount of carbon monoxide transferred from alveolar gas to blood per minute, it is necessary to measure the mean alveolar carbon monoxide pressure and the mean pulmonary capillary carbon monoxide pressure. There are several tests available. The standard single-breath DL CO test is probably the most widely used and the best standardized of the various methods described. It has been used in the largest number of normal subjects and has been corrected for the effects of age, body size, sex, ethnic background, cigarette smoking, and physiologic factors. The intrabreath method requires a special, very rapid infrared analyzer, but this is also commercially available. Because this method does not require a breath-hold and DL CO transferred from alveolar gas to blood (mL/min) Mea CO = n n alveolar CO pressure Mean capillary CO pressure (mm Hg) −
