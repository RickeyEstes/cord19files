We assume that a small number of infected individuals travelled from Hubei to each of the other affected provinces before traffic restrictions were effective but at a time when containment measures were just being implemented. Fig. 2 illustrates the degree to which the case count for Hubei province and the aggregated case count for all other provinces is captured by the SIR-X model as defined by Eqs. (1)-(3). We find that for a wide range of model parameters, the case count is well reproduced by the model. The model reproduces the scaling law t µ as observed in the data for a significant period of time before saturating to a finite level. Remarkably, the model is able to reproduce both growth behaviors observed in the data: The model predicts the expected initial growth of case numbers in Hubei Province followed by an algebraic growth episode for ≈ 11 days until the saturation sets in, a consequence of the decay of unidentified infected individuals after a peak time around Feb. 7th (see Fig. 2A) . Furthermore, the model also captures the immediate sub-exponential growth observed in the remaining most affected provinces (Fig. 2B-C) . Again, saturation is induced by a decay of unidentified infecteds after peaks that occur several days before peak time Province N/10 6 Q P I 0 /X 0 R 0,eff in Hubei, ranging from Jan. 31st to Feb. 5th. For all provinces, following their respective peaks the number of unidentified infecteds I(t) decays over a time period that is longer than the reported estimation of maximum incubation period of 14 days [7, 13] . It is important to note that due to the uncertainty in the population size, the numerical value of unidentified infecteds is sensitive to parameter variations-the general shape of I(t), however, is robust for a wide choice of parameters, as discussed in App. A. Parameter choices for best fits were a fixed basic reproduction number of R 0,free = 6.2 (note that this reproduction number corresponds to an unconstrained epidemic) and a fixed mean infection duration of T I = 8 d consistent with previous reports concerning the incubation period of COVID-19 [7, 13] . The remaining fit parameters are shown in Tab. I. For these values, the effective basic reproduction number is found to range between 1.7 ≤ R 0,eff ≤ 3.3 for the discussed provinces, consistent with estimates found in previous early assessment studies [6, 7, 18, 19] . A detailed analysis of the obtained values for quarantine probability Q and public containment leverage P indicates that a wide range of these parameters can account for similar shapes of the respective case counts. Consequently, the model is structurally stable with respect to these parameters and the numerical value is of less importance than the quality of the mechanism they control (see App. A). For the remaining 20 provinces, we find growth behaviors similar to the ones discussed before. Some follow a functional form comparable to the case counts in Hubei, others display a stronger agreement with pure algebraic growth, as can be seen in Fig. 3 . Generally, a stronger agreement with algebraic growth can be associated with stronger public containment leverages. In order to stress the general importance of public containment measures and to clarify to what extent quarantine is connected to case confirmation we also analyzed a model variant where (i) the general public and infecteds are removed from .

Note that the effective, observed basic reproduction number R 0,eff has lower values and varies for each of the affected provinces as discussed in Sec. IV and shown in Tab. I. A: In Hubei, the model captures both, the initial rise of confirmed cases as well as the subsequent algebraic growth. The confirmed cases are predicted to saturate at C = 51, 000. The model also predicts the time-course of the number of unidentified infectious individuals I(t) which peaks on Feb. 7th and declines exponentially afterwards. While the order of I(t) is associated with rather large fluctuations depending on the fitting procedure, the predicted peak time is robust, consistently around Feb. 7th. B: Model prediction for case numbers aggregated over all affected provinces other than Hubei. The case numbers' algebraic growth is well reflected and predicted to saturate at C = 12, 600. In contrast to Hubei, the fraction of unidentified infecteds peaks around Feb. 1st, approximately a week earlier. The insets in A and B depict both data and fits on a log-log scale. C: Fits for confirmed cases as a function of time for the remaining 8 most affected provinces in China. All curves are well captured by the model fits that predict similar values for the peak time of unidentified infecteds. the transmission process in the same way and (ii) case counting is decoupled from the quarantine process (see App. C). We find that these model variants describe the real case count data reasonably well for the majority of provinces, further evidence of the importance of containment policies that target the susceptible population. In App. B we present further analytical evidence for this conclusion. Note that the described saturation behavior of confirmed cases requires that eventually all susceptibles will effectively be removed from the transmission process. In reality, not every susceptible person can be isolated for such an extended period of time as the model suggests. One might expect instead that the number of infecteds will decay more slowly and saturate to a small, yet non-zero level. At this point it would be crucial to identify unquarantined infecteds more efficiently in order to completely shut down the transmission process. Due to potential difficulties in upholding the containment policies for such an extended period of time, we expect that our predictions will underestimate the final total amount of confirmed cases. .
