The initial waste (SBE 0 ) had the form of a loose, grease mass of yellow colour with acid reaction (pH 3.85), characteristic oily odour and a fat content of 28.27 % w/w. After 3 years of storage, its physicochemical and organoleptic characteristics underwent distinct alterations. The stored SBE (SBE 3 ) had the form of a loose grey-brown mass with pH 4.2, with a characteristic odour of rancid fat and lower fat content (24.6 % w/w). Clearly, lower contents of the extractable forms of metals (Fe, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr and Mn) were observed in SBE 3 , within a range from 25 to 75 % (Table 1) , and twofold lower contents of sulphates and total phosphorus ( Table 2 ). The content of total nitrogen drastically increased, that of chlorides increased almost twofold (Table 2) , whereas the lead content increased sixfold when compared to SBE 0 (Table 1) . Also, the content of cadmium increased, while cobalt content has not clearly changed. Changes observed in both, the physical characteristics of the waste material and the content of respective inorganic components, suggest the chemical transformation leading to the conversion of the bond forms of elements during ageing waste. It resulted in an apparent increase or decrease in the content of chemical elements. Results of the instrumental analyses (IR, GC/MS) of fatty extracts from the waste materials being examined also point to the process of chemical transformations during the fat ageing. Based on the IR spectra, it was found that the chemical composition of fatty extracts was diversified (Fig. 1) , while the identifiable components of the waste samples under analysis were carboxylic acids, aldehydes, mono-cyclic hydrocarbons, esters and other aliphatic and aromatic compounds containing characteristic atom formations being specified in Table 3 . The chromatographic analysis by the GC/MS method showed, much like the IR spectroscopy, quantitative and qualitative differentiation of components in fatty extracts from SBE 0 and SBE 3 samples (Fig. 2) . Its quantitative results are presented in Table 4 . The identification of components was made based on the similarity of mass spectra. In the fatty acid of the initial waste (SBE 0 ), mainly oleic acid (C18:1 ω9) was identified, and small quantities of cyclopentaundecanoic acid. On the other hand, in the stored waste (SBE 3 ), saturated fatty acids, such as hexadecanoic acid ( C 1 6 : 0 ) , o c t a d e c a n o i c a c i d ( C 1 8 : 0 ) a n d cyclopentaundecanoic acid (C16:0), were found. They could arise in the process of oxidation; the result of which was complete disappearance of oleic acid. But the appearance of cyclic compounds, such as cyclopentaundecanoic acid, triterpenes and cholesterol (Table 4) , may be the result of stereomutation with oxidation and formation of cyclic compounds, such as cyclopentaundecanoic acid, triterpenes and cholesterol (Table 4) . The changes observed in the qualitative and quantitative composition of bleaching earth as a consequence of ageing could be both the result of chemical and biochemical transformations of the components being adsorbed on bleaching earth and, at least in part, the result of transformations occurring in the matrix, in this case in spent bleaching earth, leading to the release of chemical elements and organic compounds being the pollutants of bleached oil, strongly adsorbed during that process. In this way, substances previously immobilized on the matrix become available and detectable by using standard analytical procedures. The resulting intermediate products of decomposition of fat, such as free fatty acids, aldehydes, triterpenes, as well as changes in the concentration of metal forms and other elements available on the biological transformation can determine the quantitative and qualitative changes in the microbial population. The microbial consortium inhabiting spent bleached earth, the fresh one and that after ageing, was comprised of both bacteria, yeast and fungi not displaying lipolytic activities as well as the microorganisms showing lipolytic activity. In SBE 0 , no yeasts were found; the reason of which could be a high concentration of oleic acid (Smith and Alford 1966) . During the storage of the waste, a new microbial system was developed as a result of succession. The bacterial count decreased hundredfold, as well as that of the microorganisms displaying lipolytic activity decreased tenfold, whereas the number of filamentous fungi increased tenfold (Fig. 3) . Microorganisms displaying amylolytic and proteolytic disappeared totally; however, the amount of yeast increased (100 cfu g −1 ) (Fig. 3) . Higher biodiversity of the microorganisms not displaying lipolytic activity was found in SBE 0 30 species (12 bacteria species and 18 filamentous fungi species), comparing to SBE 3, where 17 species (nine bacteria species, four yeast species and four filamentous fungi species) were found (Table 5) . Higher diversity was also characteristic for the microorganisms displaying lipolytic activity in SBE 0 (32 species-of which 12 bacteria species) than in SBE 3 (23 species-of which 11 bacteria species) ( Table 6 ). It is characteristic ( Table 6 ) that yeast species displaying lipolytic activity, such as Sporobolomyces salmonicolor, Rhodotorula glutinis, Candida colliculosa (syn. Torulaspora delbrueckii) and Candida sp., were identified only in SBE 3 .
