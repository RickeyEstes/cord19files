Model result evaluation Fig. 4 displays the simulated weekly number of newly infected individuals, compared to the actual number of weekly labconfirmed cases during the 2004e2005 influenza season. The shape and peak time of the predicted curve correspond well with those of the reported epidemic, although the magnitude of simulated cases is much larger than the reported data. The first possible reason is that many sick people may choose self-care instead of seeing a doctor, and thus cannot be reported. Second, for those who seek healthcare, only a small portion of their specimens were submitted for laboratory testing. Therefore, the number of influenza cases is often highly under-reported, and a complete data is rather difficult to collect. The laboratory data, so far, is the best available touchstone for model validation. In this sense, the model performs well in predicting the trend, and at least allows the estimate of a worse case result. Fig. 5 compares the simulated weekly number of newly informed people to the excessive weekly Google Flu search statistics that indicate the amount of online searching behavior relevant to influenza epidemic during the 2004e2005 flu season. The excessive weekly search statistic (the left Y axis) is the difference between the observed statistics and its long-term average (1296), which removes searches of influenza in a normal day but not caused by the epidemic. The temporal course of the information diffusion is well predicted. Since the two measurements are not in a same unit (primary and secondary axis in Fig. 5 ), their magnitudes are not comparable but are highly correlated. To my knowledge, both comparisons show a level of consistency that has rarely been achieved by other epidemic models (Ferguson et al., 2006; Funk et al., 2009; Kiss et al., 2010; Vardavas et al., 2007) . A majority of previous models cannot validate themselves by observed facts, particularly for the information diffusion. The triple-diffusion model, thus, could provide a reliable foundation to devise much-needed control and intervention strategies for infectious diseases, such as behavior promotion strategies and massmedia campaigns. Fig. 6 shows how the diffusion of influenza motivates people to adopt preventive behavior. The two diffusion processes take a similar shape, but there is a time lag about 1 week between their peak times. As the number of influenza cases rises, individuals perceive increasing risks, which motivate them to adopt preventive behavior. Their adoptive behavior further influences surrounding individuals to adopt. The time lag between the epidemic and adoption curves is possibly the time individuals need to be informed and take preventive actions. Fig. 6 also suggests that monitoring the real-time flu prophylaxis sales could detect the epidemic peak about 1 week ahead of the traditional disease surveillance networks, such as the CDC sentinel network, which take up to 2 weeks to collect, process, and report disease cases registered at health centers.
