During a previous study, we identified genomic fragments belonging to potentially novel RNA viruses [13] . Using a genome-walking technique, we obtained the complete coding sequence of a novel metapneumovirus (gull metapneumovirus or GuMPV, strain B29) and a novel calicivirus (duck calicivirus 2 or DuCV-2, strain B6), and obtained approximately 10 Kb of a genomic sequence of a potentially novel coronavirus (gull coronavirus or GuCoV, strain B29). These are each discussed in more detail below.
