The arylphosphoramidate ProTide technology as a monophosphate prodrug approach has proven to be a powerful tool in terms of enhancing the biological activity, by-passing certain mechanisms of resistance, as well as extending the biological profile of several NAs. Moreover, the increased lipophilicity of these prodrugs may also lead to a better delivery inside the cells by passive diffusion, thus favoring a greater uptake of the drug. For instance, it has been reported how the application of the ProTide approach greatly enhanced the antiviral activity of the antihepatitis C virus (HCV) agent 2-amino-6-methoxy-9-(2-C-methylb-D-ribofuranosyl) purine, [11] overcame the mechanisms of resistance for 5-fluoro-2 0 -deoxyuridine [18] and extended the biological profile of BVdU and ACV from antiherpetic to anticancer and anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) agents, respectively [19, 20] . In a similar context, the phosphorodiamidates reported here were tested versus different cancer cell lines as well as versus a range of viruses with the aim to investigate the full potential of this phosphate prodrug moiety. To probe the delivery of the monophosphate inside the cells, thus by-passing the first step of phosphorylation, thymidine kinase-deficient (TK À ) mutant cancer cells and herpes virus strains were also used. Table 1 reports the anticancer activity for d4T (2), ddA (3), 3TC (5), N-acetyl-3TC (6), ABC (11) , AICA (13) and their respective phosphorodiamidates versus mouse lymphocytic leukemia cells (L1210), human T-lymphocyte cells (CEM), human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa), for which TK À mutant strains were also included (L1210-TK À , CEM-TK À , and HeLa-TK À ), colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2) and human colon carcinoma cells (Colo-320). As expected, d4T itself did not show any antiproliferative activity versus all the human cancer cell lines considered in this study. In the case of murine L1210, d4T showed cytostatic activity at w9 mM, while it was found ineffective (!250 mM) versus L1210/TK À , which confirms its expected dependence on TK for phosphorylation for eventual biological activity. To the contrary, its phosphorodiamidates 16e18 showed antiproliferative activity versus all the cancer cell lines in a range between 8.9 and 47 mM for L1210, 73e 96 mM for CEM, 96e116 mM for HeLa, 30e133 mM for Colo-320, while being poorly effective versus Caco-2 cell (135e241 mM). More importantly, all the compounds showed retention of activity against all the TK À strains in a range between 7.4 and 25 mM versus L1210-TK À , 37e54 mM vs CEM-TK À , and 29e53 mM vs HeLa/TK À strains. These results are strongly suggestive for the successful delivery of d4T monophosphate inside the cells, thus heading to their independence from TK activation. As an alternative hypothesis, it could have been assumed that the similar antiproliferative activity observed for the d4T prodrugs against the L1210 TK À cells versus wild-type L1210 cells could have been due to a direct effect of the prodrug or prodrug moieties such as the released benzyl part of the molecule. However, this is highly unlikely because in such a case, these prodrugs would have expected to display similar toxicities for the different prodrug molecules (i.e. 16, 22, 24, 25) and this had not been the case.
