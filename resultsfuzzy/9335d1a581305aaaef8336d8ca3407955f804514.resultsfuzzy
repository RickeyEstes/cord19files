Five members, whose registered IDs are dong, fan, gao, long, and Tang, participated GAE-supported online discussion. Because of better preparation, each participant submitted many personal views at the beginning. Figure 1(a) , (b), and (c) are three snapshots captured from the common viewer of GAE-BAR, which shows the correspondence between ideas (keywords) and the participants during various times all through the whole discussion process. Figure 1(d) is the final map regarding all 69 utterances. These snap-shots show the dynamic evolution of the participants' thinking about the theme. GAE-BAR provides functions to allow users save their interested visual correspondence maps shown in common viewer or personal viewer of GAE-BAR for a discussion editing and summarizing. The rectangular icon refers to the user ID of participants in the discussion process, and the oval icon refers to keyword (idea). If the mouse locates at a rectangular, then all utterances given by the corresponding participant are popped up as shown in Figure 2 . Users can make full use of these functions provided by GAE-BAR to observe his or others' contributed viewpoints, to sense the common grounds of group thinking along procedural evolution, and then to explore different facets about the whole discussion. Figure 3 shows different analysis of this experiment. Figure 3(a) is the visualized correspondence between ideas and each utterance captured at the personal viewer of GAE-BAR. Both common viewer and personal viewer exhibit the correspondence between ideas and people during group-divergent thinking. Subsequently, some salient functions are introduced.
