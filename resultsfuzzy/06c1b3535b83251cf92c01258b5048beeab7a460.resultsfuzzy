The network approach naturally accounts for heterogeneity, meaning that some individuals will cause more infections than others. The network approach also accounts for stochasticity explicitly: Even with R 0 > 1, there is a probability 1 − R(∞) that patient zero lies outside of the giant outbreak and therefore only leads to a small outbreak that does not invade the population. However, the analysis in terms of PGFs is obviously more involved than simply assuming mass-action mixing and solving Eq. (1). In fact, the PGF G 0 (x) requires a full distribution of secondary cases per primary case, which will in practice involve a polynomial of high order. To clarify and potentially simplify the approach, we propose to reformulate the classic network model in terms of the cumulant generating function (CGF) of secondary cases. The CGF K(y) of a random variable X can be written as K(y) = κ n y n /n! where κ n are the cumulants of the distribution of secondary infections. These are useful because the cumulants are easier to interpret, i.e., κ 1 is simply the average number of secondary cases R 0 , κ 2 is the underlying variance, κ 3 is related to the skewness and κ 4 to the kurtosis of the full distribution. By definition, a PGF G(x) of a random variable is linked to K(y) through G(x) = exp [K (ln x)]. Therefore, we can replace the PGF G 1 (x) for the distribution of secondary infections by a function in terms of the cumulants of that distribution. .

FIG. 1. Illustration of the absence of a direct relationship between R 0 and the final outbreak size, R(∞), using three different distributions for the number of secondary infections per infected individual. All three distributions are negative binomials [13] with distinct average, R 0 , and variance, σ 2 . R(∞) is computed by solving Eqs. (4) and (5).
