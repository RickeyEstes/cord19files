When FA RP results were in agreement with the initial NxTAG RPP no further testing was done. When FA RP and initial NxTAG RPP results were discordant, a repeat NxTAG RPP test was done. Discordant M. pneumoniae results were re-tested by the LD PCR for M. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila and C. pneumoniae described above. Consensus was defined as a minimum of 2 out of 3 results being in agreement (FA RP, initial NxTAG RPP and repeat NxTAG RPP/LD PCR).
