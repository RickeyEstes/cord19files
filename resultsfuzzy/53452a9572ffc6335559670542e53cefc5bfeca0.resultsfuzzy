Simulation results were presented in two parts. First, the coupled-diffusion process under various transmission probabilities was analyzed, and compared to an influenza-only process that is Fig. 3.

The influenza-only process was simulated with the same parameters in the coupled-diffusion process except that individual preventive behavior was not considered. For the ease of comparison, a typical "small-world" network (p ¼ 0.05), was chosen for both infection and communication networks, assuming the two are overlapping. The second part examined the dynamics of coupled-diffusion under various structures of infection and communication networks, i.e., the 36 pairs of network parameters <p, p>, <g, g>, <p, g> and <g, p> while fixing the influenza transmission probability to 0.05 (resultant basic reproductive number R 0 ¼ 1e1.3). Fig. 5a indicates that the diffusion of influenza with and without the preventive behavior differs significantly, particularly for medium transmission probabilities (0.04e0.06). For the influenzaonly process (the black curve with triangles), the disease attack rate rises dramatically as the transmission probability exceeds 0.03, and reaches a plateau of 50% when the probability increases to 0.07. The coupled-diffusion process (the black curve with squares) produces lower attack rates, which slowly incline to the maximum of 45%. This is because individuals gradually adopt preventive behavior, thereby inhibiting disease transmission from infectious individuals to the susceptible. Meanwhile, the adoption rate (the gray curve with squares) also increases with the transmission probability, and can achieve a 65% of the population as the maximum. This is not surprising because the more individuals get infected, the greater risks and pressure other individuals may perceive, motivating them to adopt preventive behavior. Individuals who have not adopted eventually may have extremely high-threshold of adoption (see Fig. 4 ), and thus resist adopting preventive behavior. Fig. 5b displays an example of the coupled-diffusion process (transmission probability ¼ 0.05), ending up with nearly 2000 symptomatic cases and approximately 3000 adopters of flu antiviral drugs. Despite differences in magnitude, the two diffusion curves exhibit a similar trend that follows the 5-phase S-shaped curve of innovation diffusion (Rogers, 1995) . The 'innovation' phase occurs from the beginning to Day 30, followed by the 'early acceptance' phase (Day31e50), 'early majority' (Day 51e70), 'late majority' (Day 71e90) and 'laggards' (after Day 90). This simulated similarity in temporal trend is consistent with many empirical studies regarding flu infection and flu drug usage. For example, Das et al. (2005) and Magruder (2003) had compared the temporal variation of both influenza incidence and over-the-counter flu drug sales in the New York City and the Washington DC metropolitan area, respectively. Both studies reported a high correlation between over-the-counter drug sales and cases of diagnosed influenza, and thus suggested that over-the-counter drug sales could be a possible early detector of disease outbreaks. The consistency with the observed facts, to some extent, reflects the validity of the proposed model. In addition to the transmission probability, the coupled-diffusion process is also sensitive to various combinations of network structures, i.e., 36 pairs of network parameters <p, p>, <g, g>, <p, g> and <g, p> (Fig. 6) . The Z axis represents either the epidemic or adoption slope, and a greater value indicates a faster diffusion process. In general, both epidemic and adoption slopes change dramatically with the structure of infection network, while they are less sensitive to the variation of communication networks. Given the small-world infection network ( Fig. 6aeb and e-f), the epidemic and adoption slopes increase quickly as the rewiring probability p rises from 0.005 to 0.5. When p ¼ 0.005 (a regular network), almost all individuals are linked to their nearest neighbors, and influenza transmission between two distant individuals needs to go through a large number of intermediate individuals. The slow spread of influenza induces a low perception of infection risks among individuals, thereby decelerating the dissemination of preventive Fig. 6 .

Each combination is displayed in one row from top to bottom. The SW and SF denote the network structure, while the subscripts indicate the network function. Parameter p is the rewiring probability of a SW network, taking values (0.005, 0.05, 0.5), while parameter g is the exponent of a SF network, taking values (3, 5, 7). The Z axis denotes epidemic slopes (the left column) and adoption slopes (the right column) as a result of a network structure. A greater Z value indicates a faster diffusion process. behavior. As p increases to 0.5 (a random network), a large number of shortcuts exist in the network, and the transmission of influenza is greatly speeded by shortcuts. As a result, the diffusion of preventive behavior is also accelerated, because individuals may perceive more risks of infection and take actions quickly. Likewise, given a scale-free infection network ( Fig. 6ced and g-h) , both influenza and preventive behavior diffuse much faster in a highly heterogeneous network (g ¼ 3) than in a relatively homogeneous network (g ¼ 7) . This is because a highly heterogeneous network has a few super-spreaders who have numerous direct contacts. Super-spreaders act as hubs directly distributing the influenza virus to a large number of susceptible individuals, thus speeding the disease diffusion. As individuals perceived more risks of infection in their surroundings, they will adopt preventive behavior faster.
