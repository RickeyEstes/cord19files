In order for the synthetic simplicity, we assumed that the benzyl group as the P1 site can mimic the Gln residue of the substrate. Scheme 1 shows the four-step synthesis of various N-protected trifluoromethyl ketones. The preparation of nitro alcohols 3 was carried out by C-C bond formation between nitroalkanes 2 and trifluoroacetaldehyde ethyl hemiacetal under the basic condition of catalytic potassium carbonate. The choice of nitroalkanes defines the P 1 group of the final inhibitor. For instance, 1-nitro-2-phenylethane 2a introduces a benzyl group at the P1 site. Subsequent reduction to amine alcohols was performed either by PtO 2 -or Raney nickel-catalyzed hydrogenation. The use of PtO 2 was avoided in the reduction of 3a because undesired saturation of the phenyl ring was observed. At this stage, the trifluoroamine alcohols were coupled with N-protected amino acids or long-chain acids by using HBTU and DIEA (or Et 3 N) to afford 4a-g. Final oxidation using Dess-Martin reagent generated the desired trifluoromethyl ketones 5a-h. TFMKs 5a-h were evaluated to interfere with SARS-CoV 3CL protease activity according to the reported procedure 21 (Table 1 ). The activity of 5a, 5b, 5f, 5g, and 5h, having benzyl group as the side chain at the P1 site, supports the idea that the P2-P4 sites still have a significant contribution to the binding affinity though they are far from the active site. The best inhibitor 5h, containing the same residues as the reported substrate sequence at the P2, P3, and P4 sites, displayed a compet- 5a R = Bn, X = Cbz-Leu (86%) 5b R = Bn, X = Cbz-Phe (87%) 5c R = Me, X = Boc-Leu (86%) 5d R = H, X = Boc-γGlu(OtBu)-Ala (14%) 5e R = H, X = γGlu-Ala 5f R = Bn, X = CH 3 (CH 2 ) 8 CO-Leu (85%) 5g R = Bn, X = CH 3 (CH 2 ) 7 CO-Leu (70%) 5h R = Bn, X = Cbz-Ala-Val-Leu (67%) Bn CH 3 (CH 2 ) 8 CO-Leu 50 5g Bn CH 3 (CH 2 ) 7 CO-Leu >50 5h Bn Cbz-Ala-Val-Leu 10 itive inhibition against 3CL protease ( Fig. 1) . Moreover, in consistence with the previous reports of cathepsin B and human leukocyte elastase, 18b,19 prolonged incubation of 3CL protease with 5h exhibited a time-dependent decrease in enzyme activity as a function of the inhibitor concentration. The inhibitor was found to produce progressive tightening of inhibition, as shown by a 30-fold decrease in the K i value (from 8.8 to 0.3 lM) in 4 hr ( Table 2 and Fig. 2 ). As indicated by the NMR studies, the trifluoromethyl ketone moiety exists as an equilibrium mixture of ketone and hydrate forms. The timedependent tightening of inhibition is likely due to the slow formation of a covalent adduct through the nucleophilic attack of the thiol group on the carbonyl carbon. Compound 5h and 3CL protease complex have been crystallized in our laboratory, but the X-ray crystallography experiments were nevertheless unsuccessful in structural refinement due to fragmented electron density maps. Alternatively, computational molecular modeling was used to construct a model for the acyl-enzyme complex. On the basis of the crystal structure of 3CL protease with a chloromethyl ketone (CMK) inhibitor, the analog of trifluoromethyl ketone, determined by Yang et al., 7 we first constructed the models for the four possible stereoisomers of the covalent adducts between the protein and compound 5h. All the models were constrained with a covalent link between the thiol group of Cys-145 and compound 5h, in consistent with the analog experimental complex structure by Yang et al. 7 In comparison with the analog experimental structure, only the (S,S,S,S) isomer of compound 5h with the R configuration of carbonyl carbon adjacent to CF 3 group agreed with the binding mode of the CMK inhibitor, in particular all four amino acid side chains of compound 5h fitted into the bind pockets of the 3CL protease active site. All the other three stereoisomers were ruled out because all these molecules were unable to bind to the active site under the covalent constraint. The computational model of the (S,S,S,S) isomer is different from the binding mode of the CMK-3CL protease complex structure in that the P1, P2, P4 side chains in compound 5h occupied S2, S1, and S4 sites, respectively, in 3CL protease (Fig. 3) . The binding mode discrepancies were expected consequences due to the difference between the amino acid side chains of the two inhibitor analogs. The proposed detailed covalent attacking mechanism was shown in Figure 4 . into a mixture of substrate (6 lM) and inhibitor 5h. Over the entire 120 min time window, the uninhibited enzyme displayed a linear progress curve, whereas the inhibited enzyme with a different concentration of inhibitor showed a time-dependent reduction of activity.
