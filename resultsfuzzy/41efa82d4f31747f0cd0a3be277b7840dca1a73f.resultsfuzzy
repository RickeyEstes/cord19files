Of all 521 patients tested for BNI and BNR 361 patients (361/521, 69%) were hospitalized. Hospitalization rates were 16/24 (67%) and 115/162 (71%) for true-positive BNI and BNR cases respectively. False-negative test results did not seem to have a major impact on hospitalization with hospitalization rates of 7/11 (64% vs 69%, p = 1) and 25/42 (60% vs 71%, p = 0.1912) for BNI and BNR test results respectively ( Table 2) . Comparing the Ct-values of the respective categories, BNI and BNR cases that were false-negative displayed overall higher Ct-values (p = 0.012 vs p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1A and B) . However, no differences were found in Ct-values of hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients within the respective case groups (p > 0.5 for both BNI and BNR) ( Fig. 2A and B) . The BNI test result did not differentiate for severe disease with three of the false-negative cases admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), but also three
