3.1. CD46 co-stimulation induces cytokine secretion in CD8 + T cells CD46 is expressed on the surface of all nucleated human cells [15, 16] . Using flow cytometry analysis of isolated PBMCs from healthy blood donors, we determined a similar expression level of CD46 on the surface of CD8 + and CD4 + T cells with moderate interpersonal variance (Fig. 1A) . Activation of CD46 on CD4 + T cells has previously been demonstrated to cause a rapid down-modulation of CD46 from the cell surface [8, 17] . We therefore examined whether stimulation of isolated CD8 + T cells in vitro with αCD3/αCD46 resulted in a similar downmodulation of CD46 from the cell surface. This demonstrated that 2 h of activation caused a rapid down-modulation of CD46 from the surface of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells (Fig. 1B) . To investigate whether CD46 co-stimulation further supported differentiation into effector CD8 + T cells, we analyzed the cytokine production in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells respectively, following in vitro activation using plate-bound αCD3/αCD28 or αCD3/αCD46. Upon activation both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells secreted IFN-γ and IL-10, which accumulated in the supernatant as measured by ELISA. As expected, we were able to confirm a significant increase in the level of IL-10 in supernatants from CD46-co-stimulated CD4 + T cells ( Fig. 2A) . Although CD46 co-stimulation also induced the secretion of IL-10 in CD8 + T cells, the average level in the supernatant was less than 3% of that seen for CD4 + T cells (Fig. 2B) . This is in accordance with an observation by Kemper et al. that CD46 was unable to induce IL-10 production in several distinct immune cell subsets, including CD8 + T cells [7] . In contrast, CD46 co-stimulation induced higher levels of IFN-γ in CD8 + T cells when compared with CD4 + T cells. These data suggest that costimulation of CD46 together with CD3 increases the amount of secreted IFN-γ from both CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell cultures, whereas it induces IL-10 secretion mainly from CD4 + T cells. The CD46-induced IFN-γ production in CD8 + T cells was dependent on IL-2, since no or little IFN-γ levels could be detected in the absence of exogenous IL-2 (Fig. 2C ). This suggests a cross talk between CD46 and IL-2R signaling, as has also been suggested for CD4 + T cells [4] . Next, we addressed whether CD46 co-stimulation resulted in increased transcription from the IFN-γ and IL-10 genes. CD46 co-stimulation induced similar or less IFN-γ mRNA in CD8 + T cells measured by real-time PCR (Fig. 2D) indicating that the increased secretion of IFN-γ was not caused by increased production of IFN-γ mRNA. Furthermore, CD46 co-stimulation had no detectable effect on the transcription of IL-10 mRNA in CD8 + T cells as opposed to CD4 + T cells (Fig. 2D) . The serine-threonine kinase SPAK, which interacts with CD46 to mediate IL-10 induction, is ubiquitously present. Nevertheless, it has been reported that γδ T cells are unable to switch into IL-10 production following CD46 stimulation presumably due to expression of an alternative isoform of CD46 [4] . CD46 is alternatively spliced and expressed in predominantly four isoforms. Notably, these isoforms express one of two possible intracytoplasmic tails, known as CYT-1 and CYT-2, which are thought to transmit different signals within the CD4 + T cell. CYT-1 isoforms may promote CD4 + T-cell activation, whereas CYT-2 isoforms may be involved in the contraction of the response [4, 6, 8] . We have previously characterized CD46 isoform expression on subsets of immune cells including CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and demonstrated interindividual differences, but intraindividual similarities [18] . Thus, based on their total CD46 expression (Fig. 1A) and isoform expression pattern, it is not predicted that CD46 co-stimulation should differ between CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Thus, the lack of a CD46-promoted IL-10 switch in CD8 + T cells is unlikely to be caused by expression of an alternative CD46 isoform but may be caused by other inherent differences in the induction of the IL-10 promoter between the two subsets of T cells.
