The attributable fraction analysis performed made no adjustments for sensitivity (thus implicitly assuming 100% sensitivity). The mean (with 95% confidence interval) and selected quantiles from the distribution of the 500 etiologic fraction attributable fraction results for all 5 pathogen groups are shown in the white box plots of Figure 3B and in Supplementary  Table 1 . Under conditions when true sensitivity and specificity are both high (eg, 100% and 85%, respectively, for pathogen A), attributable fraction approximates the true pathogen prevalence but is biased because the sensitivity for some pathogens is misspecified (ie, assumes 100%). This inherent bias with attributable fraction is caused by the negative correlation between test results for different pathogens that are competing with one another to predict case status [7] . If odds ratios are estimated without adjusting for the results of the other pathogens, the resulting attributable fraction estimates are unbiased when sensitivity is 100% (blue box plots in Supplementary  Figure 1 ). However, estimating single causes in the absence of data on other causes does not reflect the situation in pneumonia etiology studies. Regardless of whether we are estimating etiology for a single or multiple pathogens, when sensitivity is <100% (pathogens C and D), the attributable fraction method underestimates etiology, and the magnitude of both the bias and variance increases as specificity decreases (ie, as the odds ratio approaches 1.0 as for pathogen D; white boxes in Figure 3B ). The etiologic fractions of the pathogens are not constrained to sum to 100%, so the distribution will incorrectly sum to <100% when â‰¥1 pathogens have <100% sensitivity. Often the resulting underestimated etiologies will be misattributed to pathogens not tested for (NoA white boxes in Figure 3B ), thus overestimating their true fraction. To account for sensitivity, the etiologic fractions could be expanded either by normalizing so that all pathogen-specific slices sum to 100%, which assumes the same sensitivity across all pathogens, or by dividing individual pathogens by their sensitivity. However, such adjustments are typically not done and there is not a natural, principled way to incorporate the uncertainty around the sensitivity estimates. The sensitivity priors for the PERCH integrated analysis were first set to be consistent with the truth to demonstrate how the PERCH integrated analysis performs under this ideal, but unrealistic, condition and then compared with more realistic, wider sensitivity prior ranges. Because the PERCH integrated analysis adjusted for imperfect sensitivity, the PERCH integrated analysis results were less biased than for attributable fraction for all combinations of sensitivity and specificity (ie, for all pathogens A-D; gray boxes in Figure 3B ; Supplementary Table 1) . As a result, the percentage attributed to NoA was also less biased when compared with attributable fraction and more frequently produced estimates that were closer to the true etiologic fraction (ie, narrower box plot). When the PERCH integrated analysis was performed using more realistic priors to reflect greater uncertainty in the sensitivity of the measurements (ie, wider ranges), the results were similar (Supplementary Figure 3) . Sensitivity priors with wider ranges are also illustrated in the next simulation analysis involving multiple specimens. The mean and selected quantiles (boxplot) of the distribution of the resulting 500 etiologic fraction estimates for each pathogen are shown in Figure 4A . In the ideal case with known sensitivities, the PERCH integrated analysis produced close to unbiased estimates for all pathogens, regardless of the type of data available or the magnitude of sensitivity and specificity of the measurements. Results for pathogens that had both bronze-and silver-standard measurements (B1, C1, and D1) were more frequently close to the true value compared with pathogens with only 1 measurement (B2-B3, C2-C3, and D2-D3), demonstrating value in combining evidence from multiple measurements, even when their individual results are similar. For example, B1 had both specimens available and the bias and standard deviation of the estimate was less than that observed when only bronze-(B2) or silver-standard (B3) data were available (Supplementary Table 2 ). When the bronze-standard data were uninformative (ie, OR, 1.0) as with pathogen B4, results were similar to cases with silver-standard data only (B3), thus showing no benefit of including these data but little harm either. The mean sensitivity for the silver-standard sensitivity prior . Etiologic fraction estimates using PERCH integrated analysis: distribution of results from analysis of 500 simulated datasets containing cases with known etiology (A) and results from 1 randomly selected dataset (B). A, Pathogens A through D represent true pneumonia-causing pathogens that were tested for, pathogen E represents a pathogen that was tested for but does not cause pneumonia, and NoA represents pathogens that cause pneumonia but were not tested for. Slashes in table indicate not applicable for the pathogen. Description of boxplots: Bold black line, mean of the true value across the 500 datasets; Boxplots display the distribution of etiologic fraction point estimates from 500 simulated datasets: Diamond, average etiologic estimate across the 500 datasets; Vertical line through diamond, confidence interval around the average etiologic estimate; Numbers above boxplots indicate the numeric value of the diamond; whiskers denote the 5th and 95th percentiles of the etiologic fraction point estimates. B, Bubble plot presenting the PERCH integrated analysis results from 1 randomly selected dataset. The area of the bubble is proportional to the estimated etiologic fraction (number above the bubbles) divided by its standard error (ie, the larger the bubble, the greater the degree of confidence in the estimate). Abbreviations: BrS, bronze-standard data (imperfect sensitivity and imperfect specificity; eg, nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction); NoA, none-of-the-above pathogens; PIA, PERCH integrated analysis; SS, silver-standard data (imperfect sensitivity and perfect specificity; eg, blood culture). range of 5%-25% is slightly lower than the true sensitivity of 15%, resulting in a minor overestimation for pathogens with silver-standard data only (B3, C3, and D3) or with uninformative bronze-standard data (B4). Note that pathogen E, a noncausative organism, received a low (<1%) but nonzero estimate as expected because all pathogens analyzed will have nonzero estimates. Figure 4B displays results from 1 of the simulated datasets that contributed to the distribution in Figure 4A in the form of a bubble plot. Pathogen A had the largest bubble as expected given it had the highest odds ratio. For each of the pathogens, the 95% CI of the etiology fraction estimate (denoted by whiskers) covered the true value.
