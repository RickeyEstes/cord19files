Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, which is estimated to infect 390 million people globally, with 25% of these infections exhibiting disease symptoms each year 1 . Dengue disease manifests wide spectrum of symptoms, from mild dengue fever to severe hemorrhagic form known as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/ dengue shock syndrome (DSS). In addition to antivirals targeting viral proteins directly, identifying host factors required for the virus life cycle provides additional targets for drug development and is an alternate plausible approach to counteract viral infections [2] [3] [4] . DENV is a single, positive strand, 11 kb, RNA virus, encoding a single polyprotein that undergoes cleavage by host and viral proteases to form three structural proteins-capsid (C), precursor-membrane/membrane (prM/M) and envelope (E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5). The structural proteins constitute the virus particle while the NS proteins are involved in viral RNA replication, virus assembly and modulation of host cell responses 5 . Tyrosine kinases (TK), comprising of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) and cytosolic tyrosine kinases regulate a diverse range of cellular processes from cell division to apoptosis. The human genome encodes 88 TKs and most of the RTKs act as growth factor receptors while cytosolic TKs participate in intracellular signaling by binding to other proteins in response to both extrinsic and intrinsic signals. The structure and function of many of the TKs are well conserved across different species, therefore, many pathogens have evolved to utilize the function of host TKs at various stages of infections thus providing an opportunity to use host TKs as antiviral targets. Drugs targeting host TKs have been in commercial use for conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia, non-small-cell lung cancer, ovarian and other cancers [6] [7] [8] . TKs have been shown to be involved at various stages of viral life-cycle. For example, Axl, a receptor tyrosine kinase, was shown to mediate entry of filoviruses 9 . Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and EphA2 were shown to mediate Hepatitis C virus entry by regulating receptor-co-receptor interactions 10 . siRNA screens and inhibitor studies have identified receptor tyrosine kinases in Influenza virus entry and replication 11, 12 . In this study we screened a siRNA library targeting human tyrosine kinases to identify TKs that are necessary for infection of DENV in Huh-7 cells. We identified TKs that either inhibited or enhanced DENV infection in vitro. We further characterized one of the inhibitors, Csk (c-terminal Src kinase), and show that Csk activity is required for DENV replication and this effect is mediated via regulation of Src family kinases 


Section:we screened a sirna library targeting human tyrosine kinases in huh-7 cells and identified c-terminal src kinase (csk) as one of the kinases involved in dengue virus replication. knock-down of csk expression by sirnas or inhibition of csk by an inhibitor reduced dengue virus rna levels but did not affect viral entry. csk partially colocalized with viral replication compartments. dengue infection was drastically reduced in cells lacking the three ubiquitous src family kinases, src, fyn and yes. csk knock-down in these cells failed to block dengue virus replication suggesting that the effect of csk is via regulation of src family kinases. csk was found to be hyper-phosphorylated during dengue infection and inhibition of protein kinase a led to a block in csk phosphorylation and dengue virus replication. overexpression studies suggest an important role for the kinase and sh3 domains in this process. our results identified a novel role for csk as a host tyrosine kinase involved in dengue virus replication and provide further insights into the role of host factors in dengue replication.
