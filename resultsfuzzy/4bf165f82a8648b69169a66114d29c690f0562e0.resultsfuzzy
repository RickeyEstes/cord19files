The LEFS is composed of 20 items each scored on a 5 point adjectival scale with '0' extreme difficulty or unable to perform the activity and '4' no difficulty. 12 The items are summed to produce a total LEFS score, which can vary from 0 to 80. The LEFS has the opposite orientation to the WOMAC with higher total LEFS' scores signifying better lower extremity functional status.
