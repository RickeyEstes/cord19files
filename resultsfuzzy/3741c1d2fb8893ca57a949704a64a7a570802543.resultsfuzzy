The interaction between VP40 and RNA taken from PDBsum [38] is shown in (Figure 1) , about 4Ã… encircled around the ligand (RNA) was considered for screening. The RNA interaction stabilizes the octameric structure, RNA acts solely as an adaptor in order to generate a confirmation of VP40 suitable to interact with an unknown regulatory protein, active in the virus life cycle. The octameric structure of VP40 provides the frame work for a precise functional analysis, additionally RNA presence of octameric structure VP40 infecting cells of RNA binding pocket is a new target for antiviral drug development. It has been learnt that there are three residues which are essential for RNA binding namely; Thr123, Phe125, Arg134. Three different levels of docking and scoring processes were used for this study starting with HTVS, followed by SP and finally with XP. VP40 protein target was docked with ASINEX and TCM database using Glide. HTVS selected 16,747 compounds based on Glide score. SP docking filtered by another Glide score criteria value (Glide score < -4.0 Kcal/mol) which led to 249 ligands. The final docking with XP ranked the 249 best-scored compounds and ten compounds were selected based on the Glide score. The ID's and H-Bond interactions of the top ten scored compounds are shown in (Figure 2) . Docking results showed that ASN03576800, ASN06396768, ASN05439185, ASN08735135, ASN08745583 from ASINEX database and 693, 234 from TCM database ligands occupy the RNA binding region of VP40 with the almost similar conformation with a glide score of -7.66, -7.46, -7.39, -7.11, -6.95, -6.07 and -5.30 Kcal/mol. Maestro Ligand interaction 2-D diagram was used to understand the in-depth interaction pattern to the ligands and VP40.
