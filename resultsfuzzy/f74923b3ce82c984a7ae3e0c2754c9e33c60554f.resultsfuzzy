Nucleic acid amplification has rapidly become a standard laboratory method to confirm the diagnosis of many diseases by demonstrating directly the presence of an infectious organism in patient tissues. Such methods have become indispensable during the SARS outbreak as their specificity and sensitivity enable confirmation of infection rapidly and allow the effects of anti-viral therapy to be monitored. Several PCR-based diagnostic assays for the SARS coronavirus have been described [1] . Other SARS diagnostic assays that rely upon demonstrating the presence of host antibodies to SARS-CoV have also been developed, e.g., ELISA and immunofluorescence [7] . However, such tests often lack the sensitivity of nucleic acid methods and cannot detect newly infected patients, as 7-21 days are required for antibodies to reach a detectable level [7] . Conventional PCR methods using a variety of primers against specific regions of the SARS-CoV genome were highly variable in their ability to produce an amplicon of the expected size from the patient samples although positive control material consistently yielded the expected product (Table 2 ). This failure may be due to inefficient hybridization of the amplification primers and/or probes to the target sequence, insufficient target nucleic acid in the patient sample, the sample was obtained when the virus was not excreted at a high concentration, the patient was not infected with the SARS-CoV, inefficient extraction of the nucleic acid from the sample, inhibitory substances in the PCR mixture, or the viral load was below the detection limit of the assay. It should be noted that our experience with some of the SARS-CoV specific primers varies from that described by other laboratories. For example, other workers have described a 70% success rate in amplifying SARS-CoV target sequences from patient samples using the COR-1/COR-2 primers [11] . Given that the viral load in patients may vary at sampling locations, the sensitivity of the detection method is a critical factor in the rapid identification of infected patients in order to implement prompt treatment and limit the spread of the virus.
