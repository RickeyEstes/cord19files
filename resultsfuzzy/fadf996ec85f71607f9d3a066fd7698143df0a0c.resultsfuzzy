Diarrheic animals (n = 140) and non-diarrheic (n = 88) penmates were sampled in 19 farms. RVA was the only pathogen statistically associated with the cases of diarrhea [61.4% vs 31.8%, p < 0.001] (Table 4 ). Regarding bacterial pathogens no statistical differences were found when comparing diseased versus non-diseased pen-mates although prevalence of C. difficile TcdA and E. coli F41 or STa toxigenic strains were slightly higher in the diseased animals (Table 4 ). There were 6/19 farms in which RVA could not have a prominent role in the diarrhea outbreak, either because of the absence of RVA positive animals in the farm or because the RVA prevalence was higher A. Vidal, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 237 (2019) 108419 in healthy animals than in diseased cases. In those particular cases, other bacterial agents such as toxigenic C. difficile (TcdA / TcdB) or pathogenic E. coli (mainly ETEC or VTEC), or other viruses, such as RVB, could be identified in a larger proportion of diseased pigs compared to the healthy pen-mates (Fig. 2) .
