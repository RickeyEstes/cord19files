Most Nucleoside Modifications Abrogate Activation of PKR by tRNA In order to assess the effect of nucleoside modifications on PKR activation by tRNA, we chose to examine the commercially available phenylalanine-specific tRNA from yeast (tRNA Phe ) as an RNA substrate (Fig. 1A) . At first we compared activation (i.e. phosphorylation) of PKR by the T7 transcript of tRNA Phe and the natively isolated tRNA Phe (Fig. 1B, row 1 , compare the two lane sets). (In an innate immune response, PKR autophosphorylates, which allows it to phosphorylate eIF2a which inhibits translation initiation.) The T7 transcript contains a 59-triphosphate and unmodified bases, whereas the native tRNA has a 59-monophosphate and modified bases. The T7 transcript activated PKR to almost the same levels as the perfectly double stranded, dsRNA-79, whereas native tRNA Phe did not activate PKR above background at any of the RNA concentrations tested (Fig. 1B) . The abrogation of PKR activation by native tRNA Phe may be due to the internal modifications or to lack of a 59-triphosphate, given that some RNAs require a 59-triphosphate to activate PKR [27] . To test the role of the 59-triphosphate, we tested PKR activation by calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP)-treated T7-tRNA Phe . Activation of PKR was completely retained by CIP-treated T7-tRNA Phe (Fig. 1B , row 2, compare '59-ppp' and '59-OH' lanes), indicating that the 59-triphosphate is not a factor for PKR activation by T7-tRNA Phe . The unimportance of a 59-triphosphate for tRNA-PKR function is similar to that found for dsRNA and PKR [27] . Overall, these findings suggest that nucleoside modifications may play a key role in abrogating PKR activation by native tRNA Phe . In order to better understand the role of nucleoside modifications in native tRNA-PKR interactions, we tested PKR activation by a series of modified T7-tRNA Phe transcripts. We fully substituted uridines in tRNA Phe with either 2thiouridine (s2U) or pseudouridine (y); cytidine with either 5methylcytidine (m5C), 29-O-methylcytidine (Cm), or 29-fluorocytidine (29-FC); and adenosine with N1-methyladenosine (m1A) (Fig. 1B) . These modified nucleosides are commercially available as triphosphates, which are amenable for use in in vitro transcription. Transfer RNAs containing the majority of these modifications (s2U, y, m5C, Cm, and m1A) revealed significant reduction in PKR activation, the exception being 29-FC, which showed an enhancement in PKR activation. These results indicate that modifications generally abrogate activation of PKR by tRNA, just as observed previously in model RNAs [30] . Moreover, retention of PKR activation by tRNAs containing 29-FC, which can accept a hydrogen bond, supports the importance of minor groove hydrogen bonding between the dsRBD and tRNA, as previously reported in unmodified dsRNAs [5, 6] . In considering these data, it is important to keep in mind that full substitution of a natural base with a modified one will affect the folding of the tRNA; as such, changes in PKR activation will be due to a combination of direct effects of the modification and indirect effects of the RNA folding. Overall, these findings suggest that tRNA has the potential to activate PKR and thus lead to an innate immune response.
