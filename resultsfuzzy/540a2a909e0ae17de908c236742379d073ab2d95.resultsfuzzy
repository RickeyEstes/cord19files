When all 2 or 3 of the automated nucleic acid extraction systems yielded the same results, they were considered as a true positive and we considered it as a true negative when all 3 of the automated nucleic acid extraction systems yielded "not detected. " In case of positive results from only 1 of the three automated nucleic acid extraction systems, the confirmatory test performed with the Seeplex RV15 ACE Detection kit (Seegene). When the confirmatory test also yielded negative result, it was considered as a false positive [16] . Among these positive results from only 1 of the three automated nucleic acid extraction systems, three pathogens (FluB, HRV, and HBoV) were detected when repeated with the Seeplex RV15 ACE Detection kit (Seegene). These discordant results were also confirmed by PCR and sequencing. The following primers were used for the sequencing analysis  Nucleic Acid Extraction Systems. The numbers of positives for respiratory viruses ranged from 54 to 59. The nucleic acids extracted by EZ1 Advanced XL showed higher positive rates for virus detection than the others. Among the discrepant results, three positive nucleic acid extracts, which were obtained by only one of the three automated nucleic acid extraction systems, were confirmed by sequencing. Two positive nucleic acid extracts including RV ( = 1) and BoV ( = 1) were obtained by the QIAcube system, while one FluB positive nucleic acid extract was obtained with EZ1 Advanced XL (Table 2) . On the basis of Section 2.5, sensitivity, specificity, concordance rate, and kappa coefficient for the 3 automated nucleic acid extraction systems are shown in Table 3 . The percent sensitivity and specificity of the 3 systems ranged from 87.2% to 93.3% and from 82.9% to 94.6%, respectively. The concordance rates between the true results and the 3 systems ranged from 88.3% to 94.2%. The kappa coefficients ranged from 0.76 to 0.88 ( < 0.001 for all values). The QIAcube system yielded the best percent sensitivity and concordance rate, while the MICROLAB Nimbus IVD system demonstrated the lowest sensitivity and the highest specificity. Sensitivity and specificity of the 3 systems were also evaluated for the most commonly detected 5 viral pathogens. The QIAcube system showed the highest sensitivity for the RNA viruses (RV, MPV, PIV3, and RSV-A), while the EZ1 Advanced XL system demonstrated the best percent sensitivity for the ADV. One of two BoVs was not detected by the EZ1 Advanced XL system, while all three were detected by the QIAcube system (Table 2) . For DNA viruses, including ADV and BoV, the QIAcube system and the EZ1 Advanced XL system demonstrated equal sensitivity of 85.7%. Total  57  59  54  68 a Virus detected by only 1 of the three automated nucleic acid extraction systems, and we confirmed this result by sequencing analysis and confirmed it as "true positive. " b Virus detected by only 1 of the three automated nucleic acid extraction systems, but they were not detected by repeated test with the Seeplex RV15 ACE Detection kit (Seegene).
