Outside of phylogenetic analysis, direct comparison of genetic sequences is challenging, due to the high dimensionality of the datasets, typically consisting of dozens of sequences containing thousands of nucleotides. However, the relationship between a set of viral sequences can be represented through dimensional reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) [58] . Here we use PCA simply as a tool to graphically represent the variance in our datasets and to highlight the relationships between the viral samples collected in different host species, similar to past studies [59] . Selecting the two dominant principal components (which in our study always explained more than 40% of the variance) allows for a straightforward interpretation of differences between any set of sequences through a two dimensional plot, with the scores for the two principal components serving as the coordinates. We can then assess how well feature selection clusters RNA viruses by phenotype class (here host reservoir) by applying PCA to both the original dataset and to the dataset consisting exclusively of sites selected by feature selection.
