Section:our results show that cells infected with baculovirus fuse together when exposed to low ph, as measured by lipid mixing, increase of surface area, and formation of multinucleate syncytia. probably a baculovirus-encoded, ph-dependent fusion protein is expressed in the plasma membrane of infected cells, to be incorporated in the viral envelope after capsid budding for subsequent viral infectivity. volkman and colleagues have implicated a 64k envelope glycoprotein as fusion protein, and the shift in baculoviral life cycle from budding to polyhedra is accompanied by a loss of a 64k glycoprotein from the viral envelope [8]. different stage of viral life cycle, cell density, or innoculum may explain the lack of cell-cell fusion seen in other reports
