Previous studies suggest that PRRSV does not induce, or actively suppresses type I IFN induction (Beura et al., 2010; Miller et al., 2004) . We did not find significant IFN-␤ expression in virus infected cells throughout the infection period, which was in sharp contrast with marked increase of IFN-␤ transcription in poly (I:C) stimulated cells (Fig. 1) , suggesting that PRRSV did not seem to initiate PRR signaling in MARC-145 cells. The virus also did not activate IFN-␤ promoter activity as revealed by the dual luciferase assay (Promega) (data not shown). The 5 end of the PRRSV genome is reported to be methyl-capped (Sagripanti et al., 1986; Yoo et al., 2004) . Similar to coronavirus (Zust et al., 2011) or dengue virus (Rodriguez-Madoz et al., 2010) , PRRSV might hide or modify their 5 -RNA structures to escape from innate immune recognition such as by RNA capping. Another possibility could be that PRRSV might be able to induce IFN-I signaling in infected cells via its dsRNA replication intermediate, but could be inhibited by its nonstructural or structural proteins produced during infection. This has been seen with hepatitis C virus (Cheng et al., 2006) . However, the mechanisms by which PRRSV deploys for evasion, though extensively studied in recently years, remain to be determined. We used poly (I:C) as an inducer of type I IFN transcription in MARC-145 cells and analyzed the IFN-␤ expression patterns during PRRSV infection. We found that even high MOI up to 4.0 did not stimulate IFN-␤ expression, while MOI as low as 0.1 suppressed poly (I:C)-induced IFN-␤ gene transcription ( Fig. 2A) . Such inhibition was time-dependent, being markedly significant with PRRSV infection from 12 to 60 h post-infection (hpi) (Fig. 2B) . To further investigate this inhibitory mechanism, we analyzed IFN-␤ gene transcription and IRF3 phosphorylation in response to poly(I:C) stimulation over an extended period of time from 12 to 60 hpi, instead of examining activation of the type I IFN signaling pathway between 30 and 40 h (Kim et al., 2010; Luo et al., 2008) . IRF3 was examined because it is a key cellular transcription factor in the type I IFN pathway (Iwamura et al., 2001) . IRF3 usually retains in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. Upon stimulation of the cells, such as infection by viruses, it is phosphorylated (Panne et al., 2007b; Yoneyama et al., 2004) , dimerized and translocates to the nuclei where it forms complex with CBP/p300 (Panne et al., 2007a; Fig. 1 . PRRSV infection did not activate IFN-␤ gene transcription. Quantification of cellular IFN-␤ transcription by RT-qPCR presented as fold induction relative to the basal level in mock-infected cells (MOI = 0.1). Data represent mean ± SD of three replicates of a typical experiment from four repeated experiments. Wathelet et al., 1998) . Such nuclear recruitment promotes histone acetylation and changes chromatin architecture that are permissive to transcriptional activation (Sharma and Nyborg, 2008) . Although our results were in general agreement with several previous reports that PRRSV was inhibitory to poly(I:C)-induced IFN-I signaling (Kim et al., 2010; Luo et al., 2008) , we found that PRRSV exhibited different patterns of inhibition: significant inhibition of IFN-␤ gene transcription seen as early as 12 hpi, marked down-regulation of IRF3 phosphorylation from 48 hpi. Such inhibition became more pronounced with the progression of viral infection up to 60 h ( Fig. 3A and B) . Moreover, suppression of IRF3 phosphorylation or its nuclear translocation was still partial at 60 hpi ( Fig. 3C-E) . The different patterns of inhibition for IFN-␤ transcription and IRF3 phosphorylation have important implications as to the mechanism(s) by which PRRSV suppresses the type I IFN signaling at early stage of infection (e.g. within 24 h). There should be mechanism(s) other than effecting on IRF3 or molecules upstream. It may do so either through degradation of CBP (Han et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2010) , or by decreased IRF3 nuclear translocation (Beura et al., 2010) , or possibly by direct blocking of IRF3 binding to the IFN-␤ promoter region within the nucleus which is yet to be studied in the future. In summary, PRRSV could abrogate INF-␤ transcription in MARC-145 cells stimulated by poly(I:C). The different profiles for IFN-␤, its promoter/enhancer activity, and IRF3 phosphorylation indicate complexity of the host-virus interactions. Further research should focus on the mechanisms of lack of type I IFN responses to PRRSV infection as well as the signaling pathways other than IRF3 that suppress IFN-␤ expression to poly(I:C) induction at early stages of infection in different host cell types where PRRSV is persistent.
