The luminex assay was acquired on a luminex-200â„¢ instrument using Exponent software (Invitrogen, Paisley, England). An acquisition gate of between 8000 and 13,500 was set to discriminate against any doublet events and ensure that only single microbeads were measured. 100 events per region were collected and median fluorescence intensity (MFI) measured. MFI were converted to concentrations using results from a standard cytokine preparation. The cytokine standard was diluted 1:4 with a starting concentration of 10,000 pg/ml, giving a lower limit of detection of 3.2 pg/ml.
