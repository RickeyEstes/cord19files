3.1. Interactions between HuNoV (GII.4) and Con A Interactions between Con A and the purified P-domain of HuNoV (GII.4) were characterized by HDX studies in order to identify putative interaction regions ( Fig. 1A and Supporting Figs. 1e3), since the GII.4 strain of HuNoV is a major cause of viral infections. Time-dependent HDX showed that the metal coordinated region (MCR), including Ile17, Gly18, and Asp19 of Con A ( Fig. 1B and C) , interacts with the P-domain of HuNoV (GII.4) as indicated by significant deuterium exchange alterations in this region from the Con A only and Con A-P-domain conjugated experiment. The structural analysis based on preliminary reports proposed that MCR is positioned on the outer region of Con A, and that it coordinated with metal ions including Mn 2þ and Ca 2þ . The HDX results from Con A alone support that amino acids from Thr15 to Asp16 show high deuterium exchange rates, and Ile17 and Gly18 show to be rapidly changed starting from 5 s exposure ( Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3) . These results suggested that MCR may generate a complex between HuNoV (GII.4) and Con A. Con A have shown that hetero-metal ions are essential for the proper orientation of the key residues that mediate the carbohydrate specific interactions with hydrogen bonds, but coordination is required to control the directions of the side and main chains in Con A. Our mutational studies of MCR and CBR confirmed that metal coordination is crucial for HuNoV (GII.4) interactions (shown below). In addition to these amino acid regions, the dimerization region (DR), which is involved in dimer formation in Con A, is slow to deuterium exchange as shown in Fig. 1D [33] . The results from time-dependent HDX suggested that Con A interacts with the Pdomain of HuNoV (GII.4) primarily through the MCR, because the carbohydrate binding region (CBR) of Con A, including L99, Y100, does not show significant changes in deuterium exchange rate. The HDX results provide valuable information for the understanding of interactions between Con A and HuNoV (GII.4). To provide further evidence of the interaction between Con A and HuNoV (GII.4) observed by HDX-MS, the circular dichroism (CD) spectra of Con A and HuNoV (GII.4) were measured in the UV range (200e260 nm, Supporting Fig. 4 ). When Con A interacts with the P-domain of HuNoV (GII.4), the signal around 222 nm becomes more negative compared to that of GII.4 alone. This is because the CD spectra analysis enables the evaluation of changes in secondary structure including a-helices and b-sheets of proteins.
