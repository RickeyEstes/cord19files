Conclusions Our preliminary data show high rates of oxygen extraction rates in coronary circulation and suggest apparent lactate consumption by heart and lactate production by the lung, during experimental sepsis. of the present study is to clarify whether metformin can increase cellular lactate production by inhibiting mitochondrial function in tissues other than the liver. Methods Platelet-rich-plasma (PRP) from healthy volunteers was incubated for 72 hours with diff erent doses of metformin. The plasma lactate concentration was then measured. The proportion of normally polarized vs abnormally depolarized platelet mitochondria (FL2/FL1) was assessed by fl ow cytometry after staining with JC-1. Platelet respiratory chain complex I activity and citrate synthase (CS) activity, a marker of mitochondrial content, were measured by spectrophotometry. Data are presented as means Â± SD. Analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA.
