The raw data from the inclined screen test (Figure 2e) , suggest an extreme effect of haloperidol. For pre-treatment and placebo-treated mice the series cluster around zero; these mice move almost immediately after being placed on the inclined screen. Conversely, the distribution for the haloperidol treated mice is bimodal, exhibiting an extremely fat right tail, enriched with a noticeable proportion of animals who are unable to move their four paws at all within the 60-second experiment.
