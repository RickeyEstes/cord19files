Eight cats met the inclusion criteria. The population comprised 6 purebred cats; Siamese (n = 2), British Shorthair (n = 2), Bengal (n = 1), Norwegian Forest (n = 1), as well as 2 Domestic Shorthair cats. There were an equal number of male and female cats, all of which were entire aside from 1 male and 1 female which were neutered. Age of the cats at the time of presentation varied from 1 to 11 years (median age of 6 years). Duration of clinical signs before presentation ranged from 3 days to 11 months, and their evolution included deterioration, waxing and waning, plateauing, but also improvement. Reasons for referral included tetraparesis (n = 4), a plantigrade stance (n = 3), paraparesis (n = 2), reluctance to walk (n = 2), cervical ventroflexion (n = 2), appendicular skeletal muscle tremors (n = 2), inability to jump (n = 1), generalized skeletal muscle atrophy (n = 1), dysphagia (n = 1), and lethargy (n = 1). General examination did not reveal any abnormality in any of the cats. Neurological examination abnormalities included a decreased withdrawal reflex in all limbs (n = 5), a plantigrade stance (n = 5), paraparesis (n = 4), a decreased hopping response in all limbs (n = 4), appendicular skeletal muscle tremors (n = 3), a decreased extensor postural thrust (n = 3), tetraparesis (n = 2), a decreased hopping response restricted to the pelvic limbs (n = 2), cervical ventroflexion (n = 2), bilateral weakness and fatigability of the facial skeletal muscles involved in the menace response and palpebral reflex (n = 2), generalized skeletal muscle atrophy (n = 1), and a decreased withdrawal reflex restricted to the pelvic limbs (n = 1). The WEST was performed on 6 cats, 5 of which demonstrated skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability, progressing to exhaustion within 1 minute of this activity (Video S1) and were not able to resume normal ambulation until a short period of rest. The neurological examination did not reveal any abnormality in 1 cat. Serum biochemistry and CBC did not reveal any abnormality aside from serum CK which was increased in 2 cats (295 and 1201 U/L). Electromyography was performed in 5 cats, 2 of which had prolonged insertional activity as well as fibrillation potentials in multiple skeletal muscles across all limbs. Electromyography did not reveal any abnormality in the remaining 3 cats, including the 2 cats with an increased serum CK. Gastrocnemius (n = 2), cranial tibial (n = 1), and bicep femoris (n = 1) muscle biopsies were collected from the 2 cats in which EMG was abnormal. Muscle biopsies did not reveal any abnormality in either cat. A tibial nerve biopsy was obtained from 1 cat, which did not reveal any abnormality.
