The additional targets detected only by the two-tube assay were confirmed by independent PCR and sequencing.  All of the 40 additional targets detected only by the two-tube assay were confirmed by sequencing as true positives. For those specimens with discordant results by the two-tube and RVP assays, the Seeplex RV15 ACE detection kit was used to resolve the discrepancy ( Table 3) . The confirmed results were defined as the results detected by at least two of the three PCR assays [22, 23] , or the results of sequencing. The sensitivity, specificity, negative prediction value (NPV), positive prediction value (PPV), the accordance rate, and the kappa value of each virus for the two-tube assay, when compared to the confirmed results as a reference, are shown in Table 4 .
