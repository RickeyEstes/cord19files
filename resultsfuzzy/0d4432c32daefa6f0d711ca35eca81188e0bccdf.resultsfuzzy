Comparative structural analyses of the two -1 PRF signals. The core of the SARS-CoV -1 PRF signal begins with the U UUA AAC slippery site. This is followed by a 6 nt spacer region, which is then followed by the three- revealed that the sequence of the attenuator hairpin was less well conserved than the frameshift-stimulating pseudoknot (Fig. 1B) . The structure of the SARS-CoV -1 PRF signal was previously determined to include a threestemmed mRNA pseudoknot (11) . Using this as a guide, the single C to A base difference between the core SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF signals maps to a loop that is not predicted to alter the structure of the -1 PRF stimulating element (7) (Fig. 1C) . In contrast, the attenuator hairpin contains six differences in the nucleotide sequence between the two viruses, and the SARS-CoV-2 element is predicted to be less stable than its SARS-CoV counterpart (Fig. 1D) . This suggests that the attenuation activity of this element is not as important as the ability to direct -1 PRF per se. Comparative functional analyses of the two -1 PRF signals. Standard dual-luciferase assays were used to monitor -1 PRF activities of the two -1 PRF signals (15, 16) in HEK and HeLa cells. For both of the elements, -1 PRF activity was ~20% in HEK ( Fig. 2A) and ~30% in HeLa (Fig. 2B) . Amino acid sequence silent coding mutation of the U UUA AAC slippery sites to C CUC AAC (the incoming 0-frame codons are indicated by spaces) ablated -1 PRF activity in both cases, to less than 1% (Fig. 2) . These findings support the hypothesis that structure and function of the -1 PRF signals has been conserved between the two viruses. Unfortunately, the dual luciferase reporter pJD2359 which was used to generate the other reporters used in this study does not contain the attenuator sequence. Thus, differences in this element were not able to be assayed.
