Growth inhibition of SARS-CoV ORF7a of transfected cells SARS-CoV ORF7a (ZJ01, AY297028) was cloned into pCMV-myc, pEGFP-N1 and pEGFP-C1 vectors separately and expressed in HEK 293 cells. Western blotting assay with anti-myc antibody demonstrated the expression of myc-7a protein in the transfected cells, which migrated at the expected molecular mass of approximately 19.5 kDa. In GFP-7a expressed cells, the expected band at 48.5 kDa was detected with anti-GFP antibody. However, two bands of 48.5 kDa and 46 kDa were observed in 7a-GFP transfected cells (Fig. 1A) . Published data showed that about 50% of the precursor form of 7a (¨17.5 kDa) was cleaved from the signal peptide at the N terminus, yielding a product of¨15 kDa protein in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells (Fielding et al., 2004) . The reason for only emergence of unprocessed forms of myc-7a and GFP-7a may be that the tag at N terminus of 7a affects the cleavage of the signal peptide. We have observed that HEK 293 cells transfected with 7a/ pCMV-myc grow slower than pCMV-myc transfected cells. We thus speculated that expression of 7a protein may inhibit cell proliferation. The numbers of both pCMV-myc and 7a/ pCMV-myc transfected HEK 293 cells, as quantitated with trypan blue dye exclusion assay, increased significantly from 0 to 24 h post-transfection. But from 24 to 48 h posttransfection, the myc-7a expressed cells grew much slower than the cells expressing myc only, but no 7a protein (P < 0.05) (Fig. 1B) . Similar growth inhibition of 7a/pEGFP-N1 transfected cells was observed when compared with pEGFP-N1 transfected cells (P < 0.05). These results indicate that expression of 7a is associated with inhibition of cell growth. The above experiments were repeated with MTT assay, a more sensitive colorimetric test to monitor the cell proliferation. As shown in Fig. 1C , the growth inhibition of 7a/pCMV-myc transfected HEK 293 cells was significantly dependent on the dose of plasmid used for transfection, whereas the growth of 7a/pCMV-myc transfected HEK 293 cells was marginally inhibited at the highest dose of plasmid (1.25 Ag/ml). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the transfection efficiencies of 7a/pCMV-myc were significantly raised from 10% to 45% with the increase of plasmid doses from 0.25 to 1.25 Ag/ml. Similar results were obtained in 7a/pEGFP-N1 and pEGFP-N1 transfected HEK 293 cells (data not shown). These data further suggest that the cell growth inhibition level is correlated with the amounts of 7a expressed in the transfected cells. To address the mechanism of 7a on cell growth inhibition, cell DNA synthesis was further measured by 5-Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation. As shown in Fig. 1D , about 75% of 7a-GFP negative cells had BrdUrd incorporation, while most 7a-GFP positive cells partly or completely lacked BrdUrd incorporation in 7a/pEGFP-N1 transfected COS-7 and Vero cells. As a control, both pEGFP-N1 positive and negative cells had similar rates of BrdUrd incorporation. These data indicate that 7a expression inhibits cells growth and prevented cell cycle entry into S phase.
