Consequently, early recognition and treatment of HT are crucial. This prospective, multicentre, placebo controlled, blinded study evaluated telmisartan in hypertensive cats diagnosed with systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥160 mmHg on two days. HT causes were classified as chronic kidney disease (CKD), controlled hyperthyroidism, both combined and idiopathic. Cats with SBP>200 mmHg, evidence of TOD or pre-treated with vasoactive substances were excluded. Cats were randomized (2:1 ratio) to either receive 2 mg/ kg telmisartan oral solution, or placebo q24 h. The study consisted of a 28 day efficacy phase and a 120 day extended use phase. Efficacy of telmisartan was defined a priori as significant mean SBPreduction on day 14 compared to placebo and >20 mmHg SBP population mean reduction on day 28 compared to baseline. Pre-defined post inclusion removal criteria were adverse events, withdrawal of owner consent, owner non-compliance, TOD and SBP>200 mmHg. Missing SBP data were imputed in the database using the last observation carried forward method, if removal reasons had been TOD or SBP>200 mmHg. Data are presented as mean AE 1SD. The efficacy population included 174 telmisartan and 88 placebo cats. Age, body weight, breed distribution, HT causes, and baseline SBP were similar in both groups (baseline SBP: telmisartangroup: 179 ( AE 9.9) mmHg; placebo-group: 177 ( AE 10.1) mmHg). Telmisartan treatment gave rise to a significantly larger reduction in mean SBP (relative to baseline) when compared to placebo on day 14 (À19 AE 22.0 mmHg, n = 174 vs À9 AE 17.7 mmHg, n = 88; P < 0.0001). At day 28, the data from 9 and 1 cats were excluded and that of two and two cats were imputed giving reduction in SBP relative to baseline of À25 AE 22.8 mmHg, (n = 165) and À11 AE 16.4 mmHg, (n = 87) for the telmisartan and placebo groups respectively. The proportion of cats with SBP reduction >20 mmHg between baseline and day 28 was 27.6% in the placebo group and 54.6% in the telmisartan group. The mean SBP decrease in the telmisartan group on day 120 was 28 AE 26.9 mmHg relative to baseline (n = 144). Adverse events were evenly distributed in both groups during the efficacy phase and were as would be expected for elderly cats suffering from CKD and other diseases of aging in the extended use phase. In conclusion, telmisartan oral solution was safe and significantly reduced SBP by a clinically relevant magnitude in hypertensive cats for the four-month study period.

Gastroduodenal ulceration is a recognized complication of NSAID or corticosteroid therapy, liver disease, sepsis, and neoplasia. Retrospective studies indicate that male, middle-aged and large breed dogs are most commonly affected. Rottweilers were affected at younger ages. Helicobacter has been associated with chronic gastritis; its effect on gastric mucosal barrier function (GMBF) is unknown. Previous Using chamber ex vivo injury models have examined changes in GMBF that relate to ulcer injury in vivo. Identification of factors associated with GMBF, as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), could identify risk factors for gastroduodenal ulceration in vivo. In this prospective study, TER was measured in control and acid-injured canine tissue to determine factors associated with changes in GMBF. These included: age, sex, neuter status, breed (large/small), and presence/ degree of Helicobacter infection.
