in Accumulation of ERAD Tuning Substrates in the Virus-Induced DMVs As mentioned above, despite their ER origin (Knoops et al., 2008; Zuber et al., 2007) , CoV-induced DMVs and EDEMosomes do not contain conventional ER chaperones or protein markers of the early compartments of the secretory pathway (Calì et al., 2008a; Oostra et al., 2007; Snijder et al., 2006; Stertz et al., 2007; Verheije et al., 2008) . By IF analysis of MHV-infected wild-type and Atg7 À/À knockout cells, we systematically assessed the presence in DMVs of several conventional protein markers of the early compartment of the secretory pathway, essentially confirming that none of them were in the virusinduced DMVs ( Figure S3A and data not shown). Only two antibodies stained the virus-induced dsRNA-or nsp2/nsp3-positive compartments, namely those recognizing EDEM1 and OS-9 (F) HeLa-CEACAM1a cells were infected with MHV-nsp2GFP for 7 hr before fractionating a cell extract on a continuous Optiprep gradient. Ten fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of the gradient and probed with antibodies against EDEM1, GFP, and LC3. The fractionation profile was confirmed by performing this experiment three times. (G) HeLa-CEACAM1a cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing C-terminally HA-tagged, nonlipidable LC3 before being infected with MHV. Cells were fixed at 7 hr p.i. and processed for IF. DMVs and LC3-HA were detected with antibodies against nps2/nsp3 and HA, respectively. See also Figure S1 . Figures 3E and 3F) . The presence of EDEM1 during the entire course of the infection (Figures S3B and S3C ) confirmed our working model postulating that CoV hijack the ERAD tuning pathway to promote formation of their DMVs. Our model was further corroborated by the observation that cell infection with MHV substantially interfered with ERAD tuning, thus causing intracellular accumulation of EDEM1 and OS-9 ( Figure 3H ) due to the relocalization and confinement of these chaperones into the lasting MHV-induced DMVs ( Figures 2F, 3E , 3F, S3B, and S3C). In noninfected cells, EDEM1 has a half-life of about 60 min (Figures 3B and 3D ; Calì et al., 2008a) . Because MHV infection induces a host translational shutoff (Raaben et al., 2007) , the persistence of EDEM1 (and OS-9) for several hours confirms the defective clearance of this protein in infected cells ( Figures 3H, S3B, and S3C ). Entrapping of a fraction of cellular OS-9 in the DMVs was unexpected but significant. Like EDEM1, OS-9 is a regulator of protein disposal from the ER and it is expressed in two splice variants, OS-9.1 and OS-9.2 (Bernasconi et al., 2008; Christianson et al., 2008) . Immunodetection of OS-9 in the MHV-induced DMVs ( Figures 3F and 3G ) led us to verify by subcellular fractionation whether OS-9 localizes to the same LC3-I-positive vesicular structures containing EDEM1 in noninfected cells (Calì et al., 2008a) . Our analysis showed that, at steady state, about 20% of OS-9.1 and a smaller amount of OS-9.2 were indeed found in LC3-I-positive EDEMosomes, which sedimented in fractions 7-9 of a continuous Optiprep gradient, whereas other conventional ER chaperones were fully excluded from these fractions ( Figure S3D ; Calì et al., 2008a) .
