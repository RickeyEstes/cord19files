This is the first report, to our knowledge, of a turkey astrovirus specific RT-PCR test. Little is known about the prevalence of astrovirus in turkeys, or the frequency of TAstV disease. There are few published reports of astrovirus disease in turkeys (McNulty et al., 1980; Reynolds and Saif, 1986; Thouvenelle et al., 1995a,b) . However, this turkey flocks which where suffering from an enteric disease. There was no 849 bp PCR amplification product in the control SPF embryo and uninfected turkey poult reactions. The sequence of the field products were determined to be 85% similar to the amplicon from experimentally infected poults and SPF embryos (data not shown). Because of possible immune pressures on the capsid gene, which could lead to multiple serotypes, primers were also designed to the viral polymerase gene. This gene is highly conserved (relative to the capsid gene) (Poch et al., 1989) . Primer set MKPOL10 and MKPOL11 produced may be a function of the tools currently available for the diagnosis of astrovirus infections. The virus we have sequenced was isolated from turkey poults suffering from PEMS (Koci et al., 2000) . PEMS has caused severe problems in turkey flocks throughout the southeastern United States (Barnes and Guy, 1997) . Currently we have detected TAstV in PEMS affected commercial turkey flocks from several states within the Southeast. Additionally, we have detected TAstV in commercial turkey flocks throughout the United States that suffer from enteritis and mortality, but are currently not defined as 'PEMS-affected flocks'. We are presently using these protocols to survey healthy and diseased turkey flocks to understand the distribution of astroviruses, its importance in poultry diseases, and its role in PEMS.
