Throughout the experiments, the following parameters are used: For AMK Type I and II, the number of codewords is fixed to K = 1024. By default, Ï‡ 2 similarity measure is used for AMK Type I; Meanwhile AMK Type II employs histogram intersection, together with a hierarchical codewords of 4 levels. These two different similarity measures are utilized here to showcase the flexibility of incorporating various similarity measures into the proposed AMKs. LibSVM [33] is used with the trade-off parameter C = 10. To verify that the proposed AMKs are able to accommodate different local features, two publicly available local feature detectors & descriptors are considered, namely HOGHOF (also called Space Time Interest Point) [22] , and cuboid [23] . Accuracy measures For KTH we use the standard accuracy measure by averaging the diagonal values from the row-normalized confusion matrix. For binary classification, this becomes TP+TN ALL b , which however is problematic for datasets with imbalanced class distributions such as Sneeze-Cough: As 3/4 of the Sneeze-Cough examples belongs to background actions category, and using the standard accuracy measure, a rate of 75% is reached when a classifier is biased towards blindly assigning every example to background actions. This leads to the utilization of precision and recall, which are computed by TP TP+FP and TP TP+FN , respectively. We thus adopt a different accuracy measure of TP TP+FP+FN for this binary classification task, which can be regarded as a lower-bounding summary of the (precision, recall) pair. KTH The KTH dataset [22] contains 2391 video shots from 25 actors repeatedly performing 6 different action types under 4 different background contexts. The actions include boxing, handclapping, handwaving, jogging, running, and walking. To facilitate direct comparison, the same split scheme of [22] is adopted in our experiments, http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/300
