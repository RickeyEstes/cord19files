It is crystal clear that the quaternary olefinic carbon is linked to an olefinic methylene group and therefore, the 1 H-NMR signal for this methylene group has appeared as a doublet in the downfield region (δ H 4.88, J = 1.2 Hz and 4.93, J = 1.2 Hz). A triplet peak at δ H 4.02 (J = 6.4 Hz) with the integration equals to one hydrogen, demonstrated neighboring oxygenated methine to an aliphatic CH 2 in one side and quaternary carbon in another side. A singlet at δ H 1.72 cleared that one of methyl groups is connected to quaternary carbon while another methyl linked to a methine because of its doublet multiplicity (δ H 0.88, J = 5.6). Finally, considering these data and literature (8) compound 1a was determined as (24R)-cycloart-25-ene-3β,24-diol which was mixed with its C-24 epimer compound 1b; (24S)-cycloart-25-ene-3β,24-diol. Cycloartane skeleton of compound 2 was confirmed by a pair of doublets in the up-field area (δ H 0.26, J = 4.0 Hz and 0.49, J = 4.0 Hz) and comparison of 13 C-NMR spectrum between compound 2 and 1a. In addition to the carbons which are involved in cycloartane skeleton, 13 C-NMR (BB and DEPT) showed three methyl groups, a methylene group and three methine group that two of them are olefinic (δ C 124. Broadband decoupled 13 C-NMR and DEPT spectra, showed the presence of an aliphatic backbone which has a double bond consisting of a methine group and a quaternary carbon (δ C 122.6 and 143.6 respectively). Furthermore, a carbonyl group (δ C 183.2) was identified that along with the loss of m/z = 45 at EI-MS indicated the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The presence of a carboxylic group and a double bond, taking together with seven degrees of unsaturation, supported pentacyclic structure of compound 4. Olefinic proton was clear with a triplet (δ H 5.28, J = 3.4 Hz) and seven angular methyl singlets at δ H 0.75, 0.77, 0.90, 0.91, 0.93, 0.99 and 1.13 were also detected. In addition, two signals at δ H 3.22 (1H, dd, J = 11.0, 4.6 Hz) and 2.82 (1H, dd, J = 13.8, 4.2 Hz) represented an oxygenated and allylic protons, respectively. These data suggested oleanene skeleton in agreement with EI-MS m/z 248 and 207, which are diagnostically important peaks of an olean-12-ene structure that has a carboxylic functional group at C-17, as a result of retro Diels-Alder cleavage of ring C (11). According to the previously reports for oleanolic acid (12, 13), the hydroxyl group on position 3 has a beta configuration and therefore the carbinolic hydrogen (H-3) has an alpha configuration. The 1 H-NMR signal for this hydrogen has appeared as a doublet of doublets (1H, J = 11.0, 4.6 Hz) at δ H 3.22. Eventually, the foregoing characteristics as well as published papers (12, 13), determined that compound 4 is oleanolic acid.
