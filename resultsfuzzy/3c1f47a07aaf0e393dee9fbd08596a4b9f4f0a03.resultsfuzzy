The web-based interface and the Bionumerics scripts allow for the calculation of several measures: Simpson's index of diversity with confidence intervals for accessing the diversity of typing results for different methods; Adjusted Rand and Wallace coefficients for bidirectional and unidirectional (respectively) comparison between the results of two typing methods results. Based on these measures the users can quantitatively evaluate the discriminatory power of the typing methodologies used and their concordance. The time-kill experiments show DAP to be rapidly bactericidal at 32 mg/L. DAP at 4 mg/L shows a bacteriostatic effect for the first 60 min and then becomes slowly bactericidal. There is evidence for dosedependent leakage of ATP and b-gal from cells treated with DAP, but this leakage occurs at very different rates. After 30 min of treatment with DAP at 32 mg/L, 90% of the total ATP has been released but only a negligible amount of b-gal. The percentage of b-gal released increases steadily over a period of hours, reaching 40% after 6 h and 90% after 24 h. After 30 min of treatment with DAP at 4 mg/L, 50% of the total ATP has been released and this amount continues to increase steadily. The leakage of b-gal is less apparent and after 24 h the cells have released less than 30%. The EM images show some cellular disruption in the first hour after DAP treatment, with this damage becoming more apparent and widespread over the following hours. The images clearly show that the rate and extent of cellular lysis is dose-dependent. Conclusion: Our findings support the Silverman model for the mode of action of DAP and the hypothesis that it can cause rapid cell death without whole cell lysis. We have, however, shown that cell lysis does occur over time, through both EM images and the leakage of large amounts of b-gal. Our findings, while upholding the Silverman model, suggest that it is too simple to conclude that cell death is due only to loss of K + and membrane de-energisation. The rapid loss of ATP would be an equally likely cause of cell death. 1. Enriched culture gave an overall (vaginal and/or rectal) colonisation rate of 21% compared to 10% with standard culture. 2. 32% of women studied had at least one risk factor, most commonly prolonged rupture of membranes (49%). 3. 50% of women with any risk factor did not receive IAP (Table 1) . 4. Only 21% of GBS carriers received IAP, whilst 67% of women who received IAP were GBS-negative (Table 2 ). 5. The baby colonisation rate was 8% (90/1125). Positive vaginal culture identified 78% of the positive babies; positive rectal culture 89% and both rectal and vaginal positive culture combined 93%. Objectives: Staphylococcus aureus remains the prevalent bacterium causing acute osteomyelitis in children. The involvement of methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA) as a cause of acute childhood osteomyelitis was investigated. Methods: Included in the study were all children treated for acute osteomyelitis due to S. aureus in Western Greece from January 2005 until August 2006. Bone scan, MRI and X-rays were performed in order to ascertain the diagnosis and to assess the severity of the disease. S. aureus was isolated from blood and/or bone tissue when surgical drainage was necessary. The Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome (SCCmec) type and Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes (lukS-PV and lukF-PV) were detected by PCRs. MRSA clones were defined by PFGE of SmaI DNA digests. Signs, symptoms and laboratory findings were prospectively registered and statistically evaluated (Mann-Whitney-U test) in all patients until cessation of activity of the disease. Results: Nineteen patients, 12 males and 7 females, median age 11 years, range 2−13 years, were diagnosed as having acute staphylococcal osteomyelitis. Three children had a suspected site of bacterial entrance (injury, burn, insect bite). S. aureus was isolated from the blood of nine patients, from the tissue of nine more patients and from both clinical specimens in one patient. In five children community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) carrying SCCmec type IV and PVL was identified. Among the 14 MSSA isolated from the remaining patients, two were PVLpositive. The maximal ESR and CRP values as well as the time necessary for normalisation of ESR and CRP differed statistically significantly in patients with PVL positive stains (MRSA and MSSA) compared to PVLnegative MSSA (p < 0.05). Surgical drainage was more often necessary among patients with PVL-positive stains. Conclusions: PVL-positive CA-MRSA are recovered not only from patients with superficial but also with invasive musculoskeletal infections. The production of PVL seems to be the main factor that contributes to the course of acute osteomyelitis. Here, we describe the first report of family transmission of C-MRSA PVL-, tsst1+, in a patient (pt) with osteomyelitis. Case report: In October 2006, a 29-year-old alcoholic man with no medical history was admitted in our department of infectious diseases for acromioclavicular osteoarthritis. He was married and had two children (6 and 8 year-old). In 2005 he had a traumatic dislocation of the right acromioclavicular joint and was operated one year later for tendons refection using homogenic graft. Two weeks after surgery, a purulent discharge from the post-operative wound was noted, and MRSA was cultured from swabs. The strain was resistant to oxacillin, kanamycin, tobramycin, and susceptible to ofloxacin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, pristinamycin, clindamycin, vancomycin, and was intermediate to fusidic acid. He was given oral pristinamycin (1 g tid for 8 weeks). One week after the end of treatment, in October 2006, he was admitted for a right acromioclavicular osteoarthritis which required surgical debridement and intravenous vancomycin treatment. A C-MRSA strain PVL− tsst1+ grew from intra-operative samples. The family carriage screening (including the pt) showed that the pt's children were colonised with the same MRSA strain according to the antibiotic susceptibility profile (PVL and tsst 1 detection still in process). The members of the pt's family had no healthcare associated risk factors for C-MRSA. Vancomycin was switched to oral trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole and rifampicin combination for 3 months. Discussion: In 2002, a new type of MRSA producing tsst1 has been described in France and Switzerland. To the best of our knowledge, family transmission of C-MRSA PVL-, tsst1+ strain has never been reported. In the present case report, a cross contamination between the pt and his family is highly suspected. Conclusion: the present case shows that C-MRSA PVL-, tsst 1 might be associated with family transmission.  The 43-kDa ChoP containing protein was shown to be the elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). The expression of the ChoP epitope at 37ºC was significantly more frequent in P. aeruginosa strains isolated from chronic infections (70%) than from acute infections (28%). The ChoP epitope was shown to be expressed on the outer surface of the bacterial cell and bacterial invasion was significantly inhibited by treatment with the PAFr antagonist compared to controls. The results showed that P. aeruginosa PA103 induced necrosis and apoptosis to kill A. castellanii by the effects of TTSS proteins ExoU, ExoS, ExoT, and ExoY. In comparison, growth of Acanthamoeba cultured alone and co-cultured with TTSS mutant strain was not affected. The Public Health Laboratory Haarlem, The Netherlands, services an area with 440,000 inhabitants including nursing homes and three hospitals (A, B and C). Monthly admission rates of the latter are 1,050, 1,300 and 1,600, respectively; overall admission rate 47,000 yearly. Retrospective evaluation of laboratory data showed short episodes of CDAD outbreaks in hospital A in October 2002 (incidence 62/10,000 admissions) and June 2003 (121/10,000); in hospital C in December 2003 (50/10,000) and April 2004 (44/10,000). The highest CDAD increase was found in hospital B in August 2004 (>130/10,000). The latter episode was found to be the start of a long-term increase of CDAD with incidence peaks of >100/10,000 admissions per month in all hospitals as well as one nursing home to which hospital patients were transferred. In the 3rd quarter of 2005, 67% of 30 CD strains from hospitalised patients belonged to the hypervirulent ribotype 027. Specific measures against CDAD were introduced in all hospitals and nursing homes: strict barrier precautions as private room, glove use, gowns and hand washing, environmental cleaning with bleach and restrictive use of fluoroquinolones. Also a laboratory algorithm was introduced to investigate all faecal samples from hospitalised patients with diarrhoea. Subsequently, during the 4th part of 2005 until the 3rd part of 2006, CDAD incidence decreased to a mean of 21/10,000 (range 30−13/ /10,000) admissions, corresponding with the national incidence. The percentage type 027 strains decreased from 67% to 36% and 8% in the 3rd 05, 1st 06 and 3rd 06 period, respectively. Conclusion: Specific hygienic measures in combination with restrictions of antibiotic prescriptions and intensified laboratory surveillance are successful to overcome CD 027 outbreaks. Our data indicate that vaccination may boost cross-subtype cellular and/or humoral immunity against H5N1 influenza. Specifically, H5N1-specific CD4 T-cell frequency was significantly higher in plurivaccinated versus first flu-vaccinated donors. The main target for cross-reactivity between H5N1 and H3N2/H1N1 strains was N1. No correlation between influenza-specific CD4 T-cells and humoral response was observed, suggesting that this response was mainly CD4 T-cellindependent. Differently, CD4 T-cells may help for anti-influenza CD8 T-cell response. Furthermore, human sera from the same donors, tested for their HA-inhibition activity against vaccine preparation, showed a significant rise (73.7%) after vaccination. The same sera were tested for their H5N1 neutralisation activity and 34.2% of subjects was able to show anti-H5N1 antibody rise after seasonal influenza vaccination, showing the existence of an antibody-dependent cross-type immunity. No correlation between influenza specific CD4 T-cells and humoral responses were observed, suggesting that this type of antibody response was mainly CD4 T-cell independent. The data from the 2005 survey confirmed the high resistance rates for AMP (96% vs. 95%), SXT (94% vs. 94%), TET (93% vs. 93%) and CHL (69% vs. 70%) observed in the baseline study, and showed a remarkably increase in the resistance rates to quinolones (57% vs. 35% for NAL and 33% vs. 18% for CIP) and CRO (1.7% vs. 0.1%). A significant increasing trend was also observed for STR and GEN (92% vs. 82% and 27% vs. 21%, respectively).
