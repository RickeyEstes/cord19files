Results may be entered for any specimen stored in the 'main' tables. The relevant patient record is retrieved from the 'main' tables using one of the query functions (see below). The format for results entry is 'test, virus, result'. Once a result has been inserted an individualised memorandum may be attached to it. Identical results for a series of specimens with consecutive laboratory numbers can be entered without the need to retrieve all the patient records, and the same result can also be attached to other specimens identified on the basis of a laboratory number even if the result is additional to another result already recorded for that specimen. If, during the entry of a batch of results, a patient record is being altered or having a result attached by another user, the result and the specimen number will be displayed on the screen at the end of the procedure. When a malfunction occurs in a batch results entry procedure, the exercise is abandoned but the operator can begin again from the point where the programme was blocked. Results can be printed in several report styles, including 'virus, test, and result', messages in words (e.g., 'insufficient specimen', 'possible virus isolated'), or reports of tests on multiple specimens (for examples, see Fig.  3 ). Each report is printed in duplicate, validated by a senior technician, and then handwritten interpretative comments are added by a senior medical or scientific member of staff prior to issue. One copy is sent to the clinician, and one copy is attached to the specimen request card to provide a hard copy for storage. The results for a batch of specimens may be printed immediately after insertion into the 'main' tables using the batch entry method described above. If a problem with the printer arises during a batch print procedure, printing of the results can be reinstated without needing to repeat the results insertion process.
