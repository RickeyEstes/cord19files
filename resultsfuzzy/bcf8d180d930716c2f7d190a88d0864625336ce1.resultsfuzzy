HemAssist-Baxter-HemAssist is a human hemoglobin tetramer stabilized by a di-aspirin linkage [5] . It was in Phase III clinical trials in trauma, surgery and acute ischemic stroke when in 1998 the company halted further development. In both the stroke [6] and the trauma trial [7] excess mortality was observed among the patients receiving HemAssist compared to those receiving banked red blood cells. However, mortality was equivalent among patients receiving HemAssist or banked red blood cells in a trial in cardiac surgery [8] . A post-hoc analysis of the trauma trial failed to identify the reason for the unexpected high mortality rate in the HemAssist treated patients [9] . Subsequently, however, a study was published comparing resuscitation with normal saline or the same di-aspirin cross-linked hemoglobin tetramer as HemAssist in an animal model of traumatic brain injury [10] . The mean arterial pressure was higher and the cardiac output was lower in the hemoglobin-resuscitated animals. In addition, the cerebral O 2 saturation was lower suggesting that O 2 delivery was impaired, perhaps the result of a vasoconstrictive response to the HBOC. Hemolink-Hemosol-This product consists of human hemoglobin polymerized using an oxidized trisaccharide, O-raffinose, followed by a reduction step [11] . It was studied in Phase II clinical trials in dialysis and as an oxygen carrying replacement fluid in acute normovolemic hemodilution where it was noted to have a mild systemic pressor effect [12] . In Phases II and III studies in cardiac surgery, patients receiving up to 4 units of Hemolink required fewer transfusions of banked red blood cells up to 5 days after surgery compared to controls receiving pentastarch [13, 14] . However, the company announced that there were safety concerns in the Phase III study and has since not initiated any new trials with this product [15] . Hemopure-Biopure-Hemopure, and the veterinary formulation, Oxyglobin, consists of bovine hemoglobin which has been polymerized with glutaraldehyde and purified to reduce residual hemoglobin tetramers (< 3%). It has been studied principally for perioperative use as a 'bridge', deferring the need for banked red blood cells [16] [17] [18] [19] . It has also been noted to have a pressor effect which correlates with increased systemic vascular resistance and decreased cardiac index. In a study of patients undergoing infrarenal aortic aneurysm resection, 27% of patients randomized to receive Hemopure intraoperatively avoided allogeneic transfusion compared to none of the patients receiving banked red blood cells, although the median number of allogeneic units used was not different [17] . Biopure also completed a Phase III study in non-cardiac surgery and submitted the data to the FDA, which requested additional data. Biopure has since proposed a Phase IIb/III clinical trial in trauma, although the study design has not yet been approved by the FDA [20] . Meanwhile, they have begun to explore an- other use for Hemopure as a cardioprotective agent in patients undergoing coronary artery angioplasty or stent placement and have completed enrollment in a clinical trial in Europe. PolyHeme-Northfield-This preparation consists of human hemoglobin, which has been pyridoxilated to increase the P 50 , polymerized with glutaraldehyde, and purified to remove residual tetramers [21] . It is being developed as an alternative to banked red blood cells in surgery and trauma [22] [23] [24] . Northfield submitted data from its Phase III trial in trauma to the FDA. They subsequently initiated a new Phase III trial of PolyHeme in pre-hospital trauma resuscitation and have enrolled more than 400 patients out of a planned 720 [25] . Hemospan-Sangart-The newest HBOC in clinical trials is prepared by conjugating polyethylene glycol (PEG) to human hemoglobin [26] . This product has been designed with a low P 50 , a large molecular diameter, and a high viscosity [27] . Phase I and II trials have been completed in Europe [28] and another Phase II trial has been initiated in the United States [29].
