We have obtained the following statistical results with regard to the total number of CC and CM pairs contained in the Swiss-Prot database: (i) The total number of these proteins satisfying N s ðCCÞX1 is 14,801, and 2280 of these are found in humans. (ii) The total number of human proteins in O that satisfy N s ðCCÞX6 is 32. (iii) The total number of the proteins in O that satisfy N s ðCMÞX1 is 12,438, 1596 of these are found in humans. (iv) The total number of human proteins in O that satisfy N s ðCMÞX4 is only 13. The genome of the SARS-associated Coronavirus contains a total of 11 open reading frames, which code for six characterized and five uncharacterized proteins [12] . After examining the complete proteome the SARSassociated Coronavirus we observed a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the CC and CM pairs in the SARS-associated Coronavirus' genome. Of the 11 putative proteins, four contain either CC or CM pairs. Two large poly-proteins, GI:29836505 and GI:29836495 contain 12 CC and 4 CM pairs, as well as 6 CC and 4 CM pairs, respectively. The putative spike glycoprotein, GI: 29836496 contains 3 CC and 1 CM, while the small envelope protein, GI: 29836499, contains only 1 CC pair. The remaining 6 proteins, of which two have been identified as a nucleocapsid and matrix protein, contain no CC or CM pairs. When compared to the occurrence of CC and CM pairs within all human proteins found in the Swiss-Prot database, it becomes clear that there is an increased occurrence of these pairs within the SARS-associated Coronavirus proteome. It is clear that the frequency of CC and CM pairs is significantly higher in the SARS genome than it is in the human genome. It is our hope that these unique two residue motifs could be used as a means of identifying a virus such as SARS. While currently impossible to determine, one can see a possible clinical use for determining the frequency of CC or CM pairs in an individual. If a person has been infected by SARS, we would expect the numbers of CC and CM pairs to be much higher than in a healthy individual. If we were then able to develop a clinically feasible technique that could identify the CC or CM pair content in total cellular protein, without damaging the cell, it could be possible to implement a detection method simply by counting the numbers of CC or CM pairs in all proteins examined. If the presence of increased CC or CM pairs was indicative of infection by SARS we could develop new drugs to inhibit the translation of proteins that contain these pairs within infected cells. As a very specific example, this could be accomplished through the use of specific tRNA mimics that could block translating ribosome when these pairs appear at the P and A site simultaneously [24, 25] . While tRNA mimics could normally be seen as non-specific protein synthesis inhibitors, the lower frequency of the CC or CM motifs in host proteins as compared to the relatively high occurrence in viral protein provide a starting point for the analysis of treatments using methods such as these.
