In all of our flow cytometric analyses of infected cells at 4 days after infection, only single cells were analyzed. Multinucleated giant cells were not usually found at this time point, but if present, they did not survive cell preparation for FACS analysis. Fig. 9 shows a 90 Â° vs. forward angle light scatter profile of uninfected (panel A) and infected (panel B) cells to indicate the cell populations analyzed.  


Section:level of expression of these markers. h-2k d is ordinarily expressed at relatively high levels on balb/c endothelial cells (table 1), when compared to h-2k s on sjl and b10.s brain endothelial cells (tables 2 and 3). therefore, we addressed this issue by upregulating h-2k s on sjl and b10.s brain endothelial cells, by exposing them to gamma interferon, and then determining their response to mhv-4 infection (table 5). our results indicate that virus infection is followed by an increase in h-2k s expression, albeit slight, sug-
