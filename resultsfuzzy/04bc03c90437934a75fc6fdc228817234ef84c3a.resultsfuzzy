To study the effects of emodin on allograft rejection, C57BL/6 mice received a skin graft from a donor Balb/C mouse and were then treated with emodin and/or CsA. As shown in Figure 1 , we found that emodin significantly prolonged skin allograft survival compared to the control [median survival time (MST) = 24 vs. 13 days, P < 0.05] while allograft survival time of the recipient mice treated with CsA was also longer than that of control group (MST = 25 vs. 13 days, P < 0.05). More importantly, combined treatments with emodin and CsA further extended skin allograft survival compared to the treatment with either CsA or emodin alone (MST = 36 vs. 25 or 24 days, both P < 0.05). Since emodin suppressed allograft rejection, we asked whether emodin would reduce cellular infiltration in an allo graft. Graft-infiltrating cells were analyzed by H&E and immunohistochemical staining 10 days after transplantation. H&E staining showed obvious cellular infiltration in a skin allograft of the recipients without any treatment while much less cellular infiltration was observed in the recipients treated with emodin, CsA or both of them (Figures 2A,C) . Similarly, immunohistochemistry revealed an obvious decrease in CD3 + T cell infiltration in a skin allograft of the recipients treated with emodin and/or CsA compared to that of control recipients (Figures 2B,D) . These data suggest that emodin indeed suppresses allograft rejection and ameliorates alloreactive CD3 + T cell infiltration in the skin allografts.
