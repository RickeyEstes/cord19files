Nitric oxide levels were determined on the basis of a sodium nitrite standard curve (y = 0.0102x + 0.0139, R[2] = 0.9877; Fig. 1 ) using Griess reagent. Nitric oxide levels, expressed as micromolar equivalents of sodium nitrite, at different time intervals are shown in Fig. 2 . MCW extract, alone or with the virus, caused a rapid and significant (p < 0.01) increase in NO levels within 2 h of extract supplementation. The increased levels of NO declined significantly faster in the uninfected CEF than in the virus-infected CEF. CEF infected with the virus and left untreated showed a more gradual but persisting increase in NO levels. These findings suggest that MCW extract causes a rapid rise in NO levels in CEF that is inhibitory to the virus. Our findings are supported by previous findings of Jena [17] , where it has been shown that NO is inhibitory to IBDV in vitro. It has been stated that IBDV infection alone is insufficient to induce NO production in CEF in vitro; cytokines or chemical donors are essentially required to achieve NO production in CEF [17] . Our results establish that IBDV infection induces production of NO by CEF. Moreover, WS can induce NO in CEF irrespective of IBDV infection. Control CEF also showed a late rise in NO levels; this may possibly have been due to senescence-associated changes. Studies involving aminoguanidine (AMG), a known inhibitor of NO induction, were undertaken to further elucidate the interplay of NO, MCW extract, and IBDV. The non-cytotoxic dose of AMG was determined at 118 μg/mL whereas the LD 50 was determined at about 11.88 mg/mL (Fig. 3) . For the ease of dilution and dispensing, AMG was supplemented at a concentration of 100 μg/mL that was well within the range of concentrations known to inhibit inducible NO [21] . IBDVinduced cytopathy increased significantly with the delay in MCW supplementation (Fig. 4) . The presence of AMG significantly attenuated the virus-inhibitory activity of MCW. These findings of AMG supplementation studies suggest that anti-IBDV activity of MCW extract involves NO production, which gets diminished in the presence of AMG. Nonetheless, MCW extract must be capable of inhibiting IBDV in vitro through additional mechanisms, not necessarily involving induction of NO, as some inhibition of the virus by MCW extract occurred even in the presence of AMG. It could be seen that presence of AMG early during infection itself was inhibitory to the virus, suggesting that either AMG is capable of exerting direct effects on the virion or that NO is needed early during infection for the pathogenesis of IBDV in vitro. Indeed, NO is required early during infection by IBDV. NO plays a dual role in the pathogenesis of IBD. Infection by IBDV causes the host to produce NO, which initially helps the virus but later turns detrimental to it. Khatri et al. [19] reported that bursal macrophages were susceptible to IBDV infection and macrophage infection was associated with induction of iNOS. Macrophages from the infected chicken also showed up-regulated cytokine gene expression and increased production of NO. Such activated macrophages inhibit the proliferation of splenocytes in response to mitogenic stimulation. Inhibition of the mitogenic response is likely mediated by NO and this Tcell suppressive activity helps in virus survival. NO attracts and enhances infiltration of inflammatory cells in the bursa, promoting local tissue damage, which initially helps in the spreading of the virus and later helps in clearing the pathogen [18] . In vivo, the infection with virulent IBDV can result in detectable NO levels in serum and the immunosuppressed chicken that fail to induce NO have more severe disease and a higher degree of virus replication [4] . In conclusion, we show that Withania somnifera root extract induces early production of nitric oxide in chicken embryo fibroblasts, which reduces IBDVinduced cytopathy. However, induction of nitric oxide is not the sole mechanism of inhibition of IBDV-induced cytopathy by Withania somnifera. Although nitric oxide production by Withania somnifera inhibits cytopathy, the inhibition of nitric oxide production, by aminoguanidine, early during infection also inhibits IBDV-induced cytopathy showing the paradoxical essentiality of nitric oxide in the pathogenesis of IBDV.
