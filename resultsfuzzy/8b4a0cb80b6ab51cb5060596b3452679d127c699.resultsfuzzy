The studies presented in this paper are based on the project of relocating Sha Tin sewage treatment works to a cavern. The prospective sewage odor impact to the surrounding areas, as well as the air ventilation performance in the potential developing area (PDA), were experimentally evaluated through wind tunnel tests. This investigation aims to give a predictive assessment of the proposed project in terms of environmental sustainability.
