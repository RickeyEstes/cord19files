The current study was designed to assess the clinical and microbiological characteristics of RSV infection in patients with hematological malignancies. Adult in-and out-patients with hematologic malignancy, including HSCT recipients, were included in the study if they had signs and symptoms of an upper or lower respiratory tract infection. A total of 251 nasopharyngeal aspirates and 19 bronchoalveolar lavages were collected during 256 episodes of respiratory infection in 198 patients from October 1999 to June 2002. One or multiple respiratory viruses, were identified in 122 episodes (48%). Influenza A virus was found in 67 cases, followed by respiratory syncytial virus in 24, enteroviruses in 12, adenoviruses in 12, influenza B virus in 8, parainfluenza viruses in 10 (5 PIV 1 and 5 PIV 3) and two rhinoviruses. In eight cases, a mixed viral infection was diagnosed. Among the 24 episodes of RSV infection, RSV was detected alone in 18, while eight patients also had infections with influenza A and in one with CMV. Most (88%) of the patients cleared the infection during the first 2 weeks, while one patient each had detectable virus until day 18 and week 5. Thirty-eight percent of the patients acquired their RSV infection in the hospital after a median of 15 days (range: 5-26 days). Upper respiratory tract infection was diagnosed in 17 patients, LRI in 7, and only one patient with upper respiratory tract infection at presentation progressed to LRI. Six patients received inhaled ribavirin and only one of the treated patients died. This study prospectively confirmed that RSV occurs typically in the winter months, can be nosocomially transmitted, and can frequently progress to involve the lower airways. Most patients clear the infection during the first 2 weeks after infection. RSV infection was associated with a low mortality in this heterogeneous population, despite 33% having lower respiratory tract symptoms. (Tuomas Jartti, University of Turku, Turku, Finland) Up to 20-25% of all children have at least one episode of wheezing, and most cases of asthma exacerbations are the result of viral respiratory infections (Glezen et al., 2000; Habbick et al., 1999; Hesselmar et al., 2000; Johnston et al., 1995; Martinez et al., 1995; McIntosh, 1976; Mertsola et al., 1991; Rakes et al., 1999) . A prospective study was conducted to determine which respiratory viruses are isolated from children in Finland who are hospitalized for acute expiratory wheezing. A total of 293 hospitalized children (median age: 1.6 years, range: 3 months to 15 years) were recruited from September 2000 until May 2002 in Turku, Finland. Patients with chronic lung disease, heart disease, and chronic steroid use were excluded from the study. In addition to serologies, nasal aspirates were tested by PCR for rhino-, entero-, corona-and metapneumo-virus (hMPV), antigen detection and culture for influenza A and B, parainfluenza type 1, 2 and 3, adenovirus and RSV, and culture for rhino-and enterovirus. A potential causative viral agent was found in 88.7% of cases: RSV 27%, entero-25%, rhino-22%, nontypable picorna-16.4%, adenovirus 5%, hMPV 4%, parainfluenza type 1/3 5%, influenza A and B both 1% and coronavirus 1%. Eighteen percent of patients had multiple viruses detected. Patients with rhino-and entroviruses were slightly older (median: 2.2 years) than patients with RSV and hMPV infection (median: 0.9 years). Patients with RSV and hMPV typically had longer durations of hospitalization than patients with other viral pathogens detected. RVIs were associated with almost all episodes of wheezing leading to hospitalization in this study. This study was also one of the first to demonstrate the contribution of hMPV, particularly during winter epidemics, and its correlation with wheezing (Jartti et al., 2002b; van den Hoogen et al., 2001) . The prevalence of enterovirus was higher in this study than previously reported, and the results confirm the large contribution of picornaviruses, particularly rhinoviruses, to wheezing episodes in children. Subbarao, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD) One of the many key components to pandemic preparedness is the development of pandemic vaccines before the pandemic arrives. Live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) are particularly appealing as they are typically easier to deliver than injectable vaccines. Unfortunately, there are several issues that currently limit the development of these vaccines including the need to generate candidate vaccines in a BSL3+ facility, the wide range of avian viruses, the choice of vaccine development strategy (reverse genetics or reassortment), choice of donor virus (PR8 or LAIV), and the need to do extensive safety and immunogenicity testing of candidate in animals and humans. An additional issue is selection of the optimal serologic assay (HAI, Nt, SRH) for determining immunogenicity and defining an appropriately protective titer.
