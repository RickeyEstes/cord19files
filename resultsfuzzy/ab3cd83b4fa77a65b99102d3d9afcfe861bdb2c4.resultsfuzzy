Results are summarized in Table 2 and available from https://sourceforge.net/projects/simulatepcr/files/. For HIV1, the 14 degenerate primers are predicted to amplify all targets in the original FASTA file with various combinations of forward and reverse primer pairings. Simulate_PCR predicted over 12,000 unique sequences amplified from nt from the combined set of primers and probes. All of the database sequences amplified are HIV except some synthetic constructs and vectors and 3 SIV sequences: gi|402243571 isolate LB715, gi|387119180 clone SIVcpzMB897.c2, and gi| 387119170 clone SIVcpzEK505.c2. Each of these SIV sequences had mismatches to the probe, so should not be detected by a TaqMan reaction with stringent conditions that exclude hybridization with mismatches. Two of the SIV sequences had human-specific adaptations in gag [12] , so these signatures may be specific for HIV or human adapted SIV. The ranked list of triplets from the nt database shows that the combination 1|F, 2|R, 78|IO is predicted to detect 5939 unique database sequences with 0 mismatches between the triplet components and the sequence. In total, there are 258,604 predicted PCR products. There were~39,000 sequences with one primer match but no paired primer within the reportable length range. A single 18-24-mer with up to 3 mismatches is likely to match many sequences. The PCR specificity stems from the requirement for 2 matches within priming distance and orientation. However, one cannot always count on primer pairing specificity, making it essential to check for unanticipated primer pairing combinations in a multiplex that could amplify undesired non-target sequences. For Coronaviridae primers, one amplicon from a glaucous-winged gull was predicted if a single mismatch in the forward primer was allowed, although there were no matching probes. This was the only predicted amplicon from nt outside Coronaviridae, besides synthetic RNA transcription vectors derived from coronaviruses (feline coronavirus and murine hepatitis virus vectors pBRDI1 and pBRDI2). The run took just over a minute against the Coronaviridae genomes database, 4.5 hrs or 3.5 hrs against nt with or without amplicon extraction and gene annotation, respectively. There were 14 primers and 6 probes for the 9 antibiotic resistance genes. Simulate_PCR compared to the original target sequences finished in 8 seconds. Comparing to nt required 47 minutes or 55 minutes, excluding or including the steps to extract amplicons and annotate genes, respectively. Predictions indicate that the primers and probes should amplify 1573 sequences (Additional file 1: Table S1 ), including (in addition to those organisms in Table 1) , Achromobacter denitrificans, Enterobacter cloacae, Mycobacterium bovis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter freundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Shigella dysenteriae, Yersinia pestis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, various vectors, plasmids, and uncultured bacteria, and many others.
