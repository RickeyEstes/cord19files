Performance comparison results between MIM and Google Translation can be found in Table 4 . The second column of Table 4 lists the positive cases in each syndromic category. The third through the 7th columns list the performance in terms of PPV, sensitivity, specificity, F measure, and F2 measure. In most syndromic categories, the MIM method generates PPV, sensitivity, specificity, F measure and F2 measure higher than 0.9. Rash syndrome has the worst performance with F measure of 0.82. The fever syndrome has the best performance with F measure of 0.97. Compared to Google Translation, the MIM method has significantly higher PPV, sensitivity, and specificity in most syndromic categories. Given the significant differences in PPV and sensitivity, it is not surprising to find that the MIM method has significantly higher F measure and F2 measure than those of the Google Translation, as these two measures are the functions of PPV and sensitivity. It is interesting to note that MIM has significantly higher F measure and F2 measure in all syn- dromic categories except the fever syndrome. MIM and Google Translation have almost the same performance for the fever syndrome. A review of translation results in this syndromic category shows that one keyword ("fever") can cover more than 90% of all true positive cases. As a result, providing good translation for this category is relatively easier than that of other categories. Overall the experimental results indicate that the MIM method provides better syndrome classification performance comparing to processing Chinese CCs using the Google machine translation system. Table 5 summarizes performance comparison between MIM and Bilingual Dictionary. In general, MIM performs much better than Bilingual Dictionary in terms of PPV, sensitivity specificity, F and F2 measures. Most of the performance difference is significant at a 99% confidence level. Note that Bilingual Dictionary has zero sensitivity in fever syndrome. The reason behind the low performance is because fever was translated to "have a high temperature" by the definition of the bilingual dictionary. The BioPortal CC classifier failed to recognize the phrase as related to fever syndrome. A review of individual translated CC records indicated that there was a gap between the terms covered by the bilingual dictionary and the terms that were commonly seen in our Chinese CC dataset.
