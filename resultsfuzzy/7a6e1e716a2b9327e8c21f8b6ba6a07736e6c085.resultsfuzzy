3.1. Purification and sequencing of two new P-III SVMPs from N. atra Two SVMPs from N. atra acquired with gel filtration and subsequent heparin affinity chromatography were characterized as atragin (M W 49.7 kDa and theoretical pI 8.6) and K-like (M W 49.3 kDa and theoretical pI 6.7) (Fig. S1 ). The cDNA-deduced amino acid sequences of atragin and K-like were determined using a molecularcloning method (Fig. S2 ) and the protein sequences were validated with mass spectra (data not shown). The sequence search of the two proteins with NCBI-BLAST confirmed that both atragin and K-like belong to P-III SVMP containing the M, D, and C domains with 60% identities (Fig. S3 ). The signal peptides and prodomains of these two SVMPs are identical in the primary sequences (Fig. S2 ). The N-terminal sequencing shows that atragin beginning with amino acids TNTPEQ shares a sequence identity of 96% with cobrin (accession: AAF00693) from N. naja, whereas K-like beginning with QDRYLQ shares a sequence identity of 91% with kaouthiagin (accession: P82942) from Naja kaouthia. In total only six cysteine residues, but no seventh cysteine residue, were found in the M domain of both atragin and K-like SVMPs (Fig. S3) , confirming the previous observations that elapid SVMPs lack a seventh cysteine in the M domain (Fox and Solange, 2005; Ito et al., 2001) . Consistent with the seventh cysteine residue being correlated with the autolytic activity in SVMPs from the viper venom (Fox and Solange, 2005) , there was also no detectable autolytic activity in our two SVMP preparations. The sequence alignment of the two toxins shows a notable difference at the D domain region: atragin contains a.a. 442-458 with four cysteine residues whereas this segment is absent in K-like (Fig. S3) . Notably, K-like contains one RGD motif (a.a. 538-540 according to the sequence number of atragin) in the C domain that is similar to kaouthiagin (Fig. S3 ) (Fox and Bjarnason, 1995; Ito et al., 2001) , which is potentially involved in integrin-binding (Bridges and Bowditch, 2005; Xiong et al., 2002) , but such a motif was not found in atragin. Structurally, the relation between the RGD motif on the C domain of Klike and integrin molecules is worthy of address.
