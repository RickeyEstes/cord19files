General strategies for prevention of insulin fibrillation One of the early strategies was to increase the stability of insulin by suitable formulation for long-term storage [38] . Since the fibrillation proceeds via dissociation of insulin oligomers into the monomers, strategies for prevention of insulin fibrillation also included among other things promotion of self-association to prevent dissociation into monomer. This was the rationale behind the use of metal ions like Zn 2+ or Ca 2+ to stabilize the hexameric structure [39] [40] . Another approach to stabilize insulin was to promote the native hydrophobic interactions and/or to block unwanted interactions. Polyhydroxy compounds such as carbohydrates and glycerol prohibited water penetration into the hydrophobic core promoting native hydrophobic interactions [41] [42] . Amphiphilic block co-polymers of polyhydroxy compounds, cyclodextrin and lecithin reduced unwanted hydrophobic interactions by engaging the exposed hydrophobic groups and thus acted as amyloid inhibitors [43] [44] . Recent studies have explored small molecules such as benzofuranone derivatives and quercetin interfered with the dissociation of the oligomeric insulin to monomer and also destabilized preformed insulin fibril [45] [46] . Recent studies from our laboratory also showed that trifluoroethanol (TFE) on binding with insulin trimer prevented the appearance of soluble oligomers, believed to be the most toxic product of fibrillation [23] . Use of small peptides for delaying insulin fibrillation has also been reported recently, although molecular details of the interaction of the peptide with insulin remain elusive [47] . We have chosen this 9 residue peptide NK9, which also slows down the insulin fibrillation process. We made a detailed spectroscopic characterization of the fibrillation process of insulin as a function of time and also attempted to get molecular details of the interaction of the peptide with insulin to understand the mechanism of delaying the fibril formation.
