In this section, we perform an extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations to validate the theoretical predictions in Section 3. Here we first carry out simulations in a configuration network generated by an uncorrelated configuration model (UCM) [45] . The configuration network has V = 2000 nodes with the power-law degree distribution p(k) ∼ k −2.5 (2 ≤ k ≤ 42) and average degree ⟨k⟩ = 3.9. The dynamics proceeds in parallel and considers discrete time steps representing the unitary time scale τ of the process. The reaction and diffusion rates are therefore converted into probabilities at each time step and the system is updated according to the following rules [25] : in each node with degree k, each infected individual is cured and becomes susceptible again with probability µτ . At the same time, each susceptible individual becomes an infected individual with probability 1−(1−β k τ ) n I , where n I is the total number of the infected individuals in the node. After all nodes have been updated for the reaction, we simulate the diffusion process: each individual moves into a randomly chosen neighbor node with probabilities D S τ and D I τ for the susceptible and infected individuals, respectively. In our simulation, the dynamics parameters are µ = 0.05, β = 0.05 and τ = 1 if not otherwise specified. −1) is the same as that in the case of α = 0.5 (or α = 1). We also find that NIR and PIR infection regimes increase the values of the epidemic threshold ρ c by the same extent, and the larger the absolute value of α is, the larger the simulated epidemic threshold is. These simulation results match well the analytical prediction (see Eq. (14)). For the Case 2 mobility pattern (see Fig. 3(b) ), the curve with α = 0 separates the curves with α > 0 (PIR) from those with α < 0 (NIR). This validates that the PIR infection regime decreases the epidemic threshold and NIR increases it. Here for α equal to 0, 0. The simulation results (see Fig. 3 (a)) indicate that for the Case 1 mobility pattern and the same absolute value of α, PIR and NIR infection regimes have the same impact on the epidemic threshold as well as the stationary infected density. In the following, we want to know in such a case how these two infection regimes affect the temporal behavior of the prevalence above the epidemic threshold. To this aim, in Fig. 4 , we plot the time evolution of the normalized epidemic prevalence ρ I (t)/ρ and the corresponding spread speed v(t) (the inset) for different α values in the configuration network with the average population density ρ = 3, where v(t) is here defined as Refs. [46, 47] v(t) = ∂(ρ I (t)/ρ) ∂t ≈ ρ I (t)/ρ − ρ I (t − 1)/ρ. It can be seen from Fig. 4 that in PIR (α > 0) and NIR (α < 0) infection regimes the time evolution curves of the epidemic prevalence are different for the same |α| ( Fig. 4 (a) |α| = 0.5 and Fig. 4 (b) |α| = 1). More specifically, at the early time steps, the epidemic prevalence in the PIR infection regime grows faster than that in the NIR infection regime. However, as time goes on, it is just the opposite. As a result, after a long time, the two infection regimes make epidemic spreading reach a same equilibrium state. Similarly, in the NIR infection regime, epidemic has a faster speed at the early time steps and reaches the infection peak earlier than that in the NIR infection regime (see the inset of Fig. 4) . This rationale behind this finding is as follows. According to Eq. (2), in nodes with higher degree, the infection rates are larger in the PIR infection regime than those in the NIR infection regime. In nodes with lower degree, it is just the opposite. On the other hand, as a result of the stochastic migration process, most individuals will gather in nodes with higher degree, and this is convenient for epidemic invasion in those nodes. In such cases, epidemic speed in the PIR infection regime is larger than that in the NIR infection regime at early time steps due to the fact that infection mainly occurs in nodes with higher degree. As time goes on, the epidemic diffuses to nodes with lower degree. From this time, epidemic speed in the NIR infection regime begins to increase because of larger infection rates in those nodes with lower degree. In order to further confirm the validity of the theoretical results in a real-world setting, we perform simulations in the US air transportation network with 332 nodes and 2126 links [48, 49] . In the network, each node represents an airport and each link denotes a direct flight between two airports. The network link weight is ignored and the cumulative degree distribution is shown in Fig. 5 . The simulation results about the epidemic threshold and the temporal behavior of the prevalence above the epidemic threshold in the US air transportation network are shown in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. It can be seen from these two figures that the simulation results are also in accord with theoretical results obtained in Section 3. The theoretical and simulated results above are based on the two special mobility patterns. To understand how the heterogeneous infection rate affects the epidemic threshold in a more general mobility pattern, we give the simulation results about the epidemic threshold with D s = 0.5 and D I = 0.8 in the configuration network ( Fig. 8(a) ) and the US airport transportation network (Fig. 8(b) ). It can be seen from Fig. 8 that for a more general mobility pattern, the NIR infection regime increases the epidemic threshold and the PIR infection regime decreases it, which are similar to the results in the special case of D s = D I = 1.
