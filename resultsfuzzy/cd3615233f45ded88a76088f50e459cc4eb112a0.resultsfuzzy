Fold prediction by meta-server (3D Jury) revealed that top three significant hits (3D score . 50) for S1 protein are as below: 1loq_A (Orotidine monophosphate decarboxylase (lyase), 3D score 154, threading server PCONS2), 1ijq (lowdensity lipoprotein receptor (lipid transport), 3D score 125, threading server PCONS2) and 2bbk_H (Methylamine dehydrogenase (electron transport), 3D score 118, threading server PCONS2). Using them as templates the corresponding Fig. 1 . The sequence alignment between SARS-CoV S1 and template 1ijq with ClustalW. The secondary structure of S1 predicted by PsiPred is also included. 3D models of S1 were generated and the quality of protein model was evaluated by ProQ program. The results are as follows: So the 'correct' model (the cutoffs for 'correct model' are ProQ-LG . 1.5 or ProQ-MX . 0.1) for S1 protein is the model built on template1ijq. The sequence alignment between template 1ijq and S1 with ClustalW [15] and the secondary structures of S1 predicted by PsiPred v2.3 [16] are displayed in Fig. 1 . Thus, the 3D model of S1 is basically composed of one long a helix and six three-stranded b-sheets arranged in a propeller fashion (among them are a couple of small helices with 3 -5 residues only) (Fig. 2) , comparable to the structure of its template (low-density lipoprotein receptor): consisting of six fourstranded b-sheets arranged in a propeller fashion. It is not difficult to understand such a structure similarity in terms of their functions, the low-density lipoprotein receptor is responsible for the binding and entry into cells of lipoprotein ligands [17] , while SARS-CoV S1 is also responsible for receptor binding and SARS-CoV entry into cells [5] . The non-canonical interactions in S1 protein structure were identified by NCI program and the result shows that there are three pairs of main chain-side chain interactions: Trp 171 (donor) and Phe 179 (acceptor), Ala 210 (donor) and Phe 29 (acceptor), and Leu 209 (donor) and Trp 171 (acceptor). Among these interactions, Trp171 accept one N-H· · ·p bond from Leu209 and donates one N -H· · ·p bond to Phe179, which forms a sandwich-like interaction, as existed in human rac1 [18] and SARS-CoV main protease [4] . These noncanonical bindings fix the helix Trp171 locate to the two b-sheets Phe179 and Leu209 locate, hence stabilizes the structure of S1 protein, but probably reduces the active site cavity for ligand binding (Fig. 3) . Indeed, the non-canonical interactions have been shown to be important for the stability of protein structure [19 -21] and ligand recognition [22] . In order to extract more information from the predicted structure of S1 protein, we employed VAST, DALI and CE Fig. 5 . The structure alignment between S1 and its structure neighbors: 1INY (neuraminidase from influenza A virus) and 1B9T (neuraminidase from influenza B virus). The bold residues indicate conservative residues. The residues marked as '#' make contact with inhibitors. programs to search its structure neighbors and found two interesting neighbors: 1INY (neuraminidase from influenza A virus) and 1B9T (neuraminidase from influenza B virus). In fact, both type A and B neraminidases are composed of six four-stranded anti-parallel b-sheets arranged in a propeller fashion [23, 24] and resemble the structure of S1 stated above: basically composed of one long a helix and six threestranded b-sheets arranged in a propeller fashion. The common feature of these structures is that they share the same active center, as seen in their superpositions (Fig. 4) . The structure alignment between 1INY, 1B9T and S1 is shown in Fig. 5 . The result demonstrates that there are a number of similar structure patterns showing conservative residues (bold representation). Indeed, their functions are also similar: neuraminidase is an influenza virus glycoprotein embedded in the viral envelope, its function is to facilitate the release of progeny virions from infected cells to other cells [23, 24] , while SARS-CoV S1 is also responsible for the entry of SARS-CoV into cells, as stated above. Naturally, such a structure similarity between SARS-CoV S1 protein and influenza virus neuraminidase leads us to consider the possible application of neuraminidase inhibitors to SARS therapy. For example, Epana and RAI inhibitors have been shown to exhibit great potency for type A/B influenza viruses [23, 24] . Figs. 6 and 7 shows the structures of docking the two inhibitors from influenza virus Fig. 7 .

The sequence alignment between anti-SARS-CoV-S1 human monoclonal antibody 80R and influenza virus anti-neuraminidase antibodies Nc10/Nc41. to SARS-CoV S1 protein. It can be seen that these compounds can bind to the active center of S1 in the same way as they did in neuraminidase, the residues that make contact with the inhibitors (RMSD # 5) are marked as '#' in Fig. 5 and represented by blue ball-stick in Figs. 6 and 7, among them are 10 conservative residues. Furthermore, we also speculate that influenza virus antineuraminidase antibody could be applied to SARS-CoV S1 protein after appropriate modification, such as, Nc10 and Nc41 anti-influenza virus neuraminidase antibodies [25, 26] . Indeed, a very recent publication confirmed our speculation, Sui et al. [27] identified an anti-S1 human monoclonal antibody 80R, which potently neutralizes SARS-CoV infection and efficiently inhibits syncytia formation through blocking of S1 binding to its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells. The sequence alignments between Nc10/Nc41 and 80R show more than 50% identity (Fig. 8) . In summary, our modeling exercise on S1 protein find a structure similarity between SARS-CoV S1 protein and influenza virus neuraminidase. In fact, there are clinically similar symptoms for influenza virus and SARS-CoV, both can cause a fever, cough, pains, pneumonia and death [28] . Moreover, our study suggests that the influenza virus neuraminidase inhibitors and anti-neuraminidase antibody could be a starting point for screening anti-SARS drug, vaccine and antibody.
