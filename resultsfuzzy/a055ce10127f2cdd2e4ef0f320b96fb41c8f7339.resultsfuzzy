The reaction of 1-methoxy-1,3-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)-1,3-butadiene (1a), readily available from methyl acetoacetate, 25 with ptoluenesulfonyl cyanide (TsCN, 2a) afforded the 4-hydroxy-2tosylpyridine 3a in 43% yield (Scheme 1, Table 1 ). The best yields were obtained when a neat mixture of the starting materials was allowed to slowly warm from -78°C to ambient temperature. A complex mixture was obtained when the reaction was carried out at elevated temperatures or when a solvent was added. An aqueous work-up using NH 4 Cl or HCl was necessary. The formation of 3a can be explained by [4 + 2] cycloaddition to give intermediate A and subsequent acid-mediated cleavage of the silyloxy group and aromatization. The cyclization of 1,3-bis(silyloxy)-1,3-butadienes 1a-p with arylsulfonyl cyanides 2a,b afforded the 4-hydroxy-2-sulfonylpyridines 3a-v (Table 1 ). The reaction conditions were optimized. The reactions of dienes 1a,b,e,f, prepared from unsubstituted bketoesters, were carried out at 20°C (the starting materials were added at -78°C and the mixture was subsequently warmed to 20°C during 30 min. The reaction time was in the range of 24-28 h. A considerable extension of the reaction time was necessary for the less reactive dienes 1c and 1d derived from pentane-2,4dione and 1-methoxy-pentane-2,4-dione, respectively. In these cases, the starting materials were added at 0 rather than -78°C. The reactions were carried out at 20°C. An increase of the temper-ature resulted in partial decomposition. The reactions of dienes 1g-i and 1m-o were carried out at 45°C (48 h). The arylthiosubstituted dienes 1j-l,p solidify at 20°C. Since all reactions reported herein had to be carried out without solvent (neat) it proved to be advantageous to carry out the reactions of 1j-l,p at 60°C (96 h). Noteworthy, the yields of pyridines 3i-v were considerably higher than those of 3a-h. This can be explained by the cisoid conformation of 1,3-bis(silyloxy)-1,3-butadienes 1g-s, due to the presence of the substituent located at the central carbon atom. The reaction of 2a with 1,3-bis(silyloxy)-1,3-butadienes containing a substituent located at the terminal carbon atom proved to be unsuccessful, presumably due to steric reasons. The reaction of 1a with ethoxycarbonyl cyanide was also unsuccessful, due to the low reactivity of the latter compared to 2a. No conversion was observed when the reaction was carried out at 20 and 60°C. Forcing conditions (neat, 120°C) resulted in decomposition and 1,5 O ? C TMS shift of the 1,3-bis(silyl enol ether) to give a 3-silyloxy-4-silylcrotonate. 26 The structures of the products were elucidated by spectroscopic methods (2D NMR). The structures of 3l and 3r were independently confirmed by X-ray crystal structure analyses (Figs. 1 and 2). 27 All arylsulfonyl-pyridines were tested towards their antimicrobial activity. The agar diffusion test method was used to evaluate the influence on the growth of the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis as well as the Gram-negative Escherichia coli and the yeast Candida maltosa. The results of that screening are summarized in Table 2 . Some of the compounds showed considerable activities against S. aureus and B. subtilis. In this screening no activity against the Gram-negative E. coli was observed. Only 3o showed a weak activity against the yeast C. maltosa. Compound 3o is also among the most active derivatives in this study. To evaluate the antimicrobial potential of the most active compounds minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined. The results of these investigations are summarized in Table 3 . Derivatives 3i,j,o, containing a halogen atom located at the pyridine moiety, show the best activities. A good activity was also observed for derivative 3n containing a tolylthio moiety. The chloro derivatives 3i and 3o show a good antibiotic activity against the tested Gram-positive pathogenes. Interestingly, the R 2 thio-substituted sulfonyl-pyridines 3l-n and 3u-v are also active, but at a lower level in the agar diffusion assay. In contrast to this observation, the MIC of 3n, 3u and 3v are lower compared to the chlorinated compounds 3i and 3o. A possible explanation would be a better bioavailability in case of the non-chlorinated derivatives in the dilution assay. All compounds show much lower activity compared to Ampicillin in this study. In future studies, the influence of a halogenation at position R 2 or R 3 in the thioaryl derivatives could be of interest to get better insight into the structure-activity relationships.
