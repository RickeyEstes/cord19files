Pasteurella multocida was isolated in 54 calves (57%) from 10 herds. Mannheimia haemolytica was isolated in 17 calves (18%) from 5 herds. Histophilus somni was isolated in 12 calves (13%) from 3 different herds. More than 1 of these 3 bacteria were identified in 5 herds and in 15 calves. Pasteurella multocida was cultured in association with M. haemolytica and H. somni in 7 and 8 calves, respectively. Seventy-eight calves (82%) were positive for Mycoplasma species other than M. bovis. Mycoplasma spp. were cultured only from the NASA in 6 calves, only from NASO in 2 calves, and from both swabs in 70 calves. Mycoplasma spp. was cultured at least once in all herds. Nineteen calves (20%) were positive by culture, PCR, or both, of the NASA, NASO, or both swabs for M. bovis (Table 3) . Mycoplasma bovis was identified only by PCR testing in 4 calves, by culture from the NASA and NASO in 4 calves, by PCR testing and culture of the NASO in 1 calf, and by PCR testing and culture of the NASA and NASO in 10 calves. Mycoplasma bovis was identified with M. haemolytica in 4 calves, P. multocida in 5 calves, and P. multocida as well as H. somni in 3 calves. Bovine coronavirus and BRSV were the only viruses detected in the study. BRSV was detected in 1 calf in the only herd in which no vaccination program for BRD was carried out. BCV was detected in 38 calves (40%) from 7 different herds.
