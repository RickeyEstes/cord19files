Codon usage pattern belonging to compositional characteristics such as the T 3 , C 3 , A 3 , G 3 , GC 12 , and GC 3 and overall GC content of 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes from different area are calculated. The results show that the average value of overall GC content is 65.36%, average value of GC 3 is 79.18%, and the average T 3 (11.38%) and A 3 (9.43%) of 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes are fewer than GC 3 . Furthermore, the average ENC, FOP, CBI, and CAI are 41.25, 0.64, 0.39, and 0.45. ENC is an important index to measure the codon usage bias in a genome and play a major role in their codon usage profile. In order to investigate the synonymous codon usage pattern of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes, the ENC versus GC 3 is plotted and the result is shown in Figure 1 . Every point represents one coding gene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It can be seen that most dots are under the expected curve. Many scientists tended to think that the ENC value is belonging to a range of 21 to 61, but when the is calculated via ( ∑ ( / ) 2 − 1)/( − 1), all ENC values fell in the range from 20 to infinite; here, the value 20 denotes the codon usage bias using only one possible synonymous codon to correspond to an amino acid, and the larger value indicates that there is less bias of using all possible synonymous codons, and the frequency of using all possible synonymous codons may tend to be equal. The parity rule states that if there is no mutation in genes, or no bias on the codon selection effect, the base content should obey the laws A = T and G = C. This method is usually used to analyze the PR2 bias of the third place codon via comparing the A 3 /(A 3 + T 3 ) and the values of G 3 /(G 3 + C 3 ). The PR2 bias plot of 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes is shown in Figure 2 . The distance between dot and the center denotes the degree and direction of the PR2 bias. From Figure 2 , in most genes, A 3 are less than T 3 . Most C 3 content of the genes are more than the occurrence rate of T3 in these genes. Usually, the neutrality plot is used to analyze the directional mutation pressure versus natural selection of a certain genome, which could also reveal the relationship between the GC 12 and the GC 3 with the GC12 as the ordinate and the GC 3 as the abscissa. The neutrality plot of 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes is shown in Figure 3 . Each point shown in Figure 3 represents one separate gene for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The result shows that the distribution of most GC 12 rate is between 0.5 and 0.65 and most of the GC 3 rate is during 70%-90%. In addition, GC 3 is more than GC 12 in most of the genes. Meanwhile, the correlation analysis in Table 2 shows that there is a weak correlation with the value of −0.015. Form these data performance, it can be seen that the natural selection may be a greater impact factor on codon preference in Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes. RSCU value, which is an important parameter for evaluating the bias of the synonymous codon, represents the ratio between the occurrence frequency of one codon and the expected usage frequency in a gene sample. Codons whose RSCU values are more than 1.0 would be regarded as having positive codon usage bias. On the contrary, those RSCU values less than 1.0 are defined as the less-abundant codons. (Figure 4) , to a certain degree, can reflect the characteristics of codon usage, but when it comes to the codon usage of individual sequence for a particular genome, it can be seen that there is a great difference of RSCU values from different genes even of one genome. RSCU values of 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes are separately shown in Figure 5 . There is some difference between all genomes especially in the usage of CUU, GUG, ACC, GAU, CGG, GGC, and so on. The CBI value can more clearly describe the foreign gene expression in the host. The CBI values of 12 separated BioMed Research International   5   0  1  2  UUU  UUC  UUA  UUG  CUU  CUC  CUA  CUG  AUU  AUC  AUA  AUG  GUU  GUC  GUA  GUG  UCU  UCC  UCA  UCG  CCU  CCC  CCA  CCG  ACU  ACC  ACA  ACG  GCU  GCC  GCA  GCG  UAU  UAC  UAA  UAG  CAU  CAC  CAA  CAG  AAU  AAC  AAA  AAG  GAU  GAC  GAA  GAG  UGU  UGC  UGA  UGG  CGU  CGC  CGA  CGG  AGU  AGC  AGA  AGG  GGU  GGC Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes are calculated via (6) . Meanwhile, in order to explore the relationship between the CBI and the ENC, the ENC values are equalized to the range of the CBI via the following equation: Most previous researchers pointed out that the smaller ENC value may denote higher codon usage bias (CBI). The phenomenon is shown in Figure 6 , and here the negative relationship between them is digitized by the linear fitting results. The results show that the negative correlation coefficient is −0.78657. Proteins in Mycobacterium tuberculosis could be analyzed via many methods, mass spectrometry, codon usage, and so on [25, 26] . Codon usage is linked to nucleic acids and proteins, especially the GC content. In Figure 7 , relationship between protein length and GC content (GC 3 and GC 12 ) is described. Most proteins are concentrated within five hundred amino acids in length; it can also be seen from Figure 7 that when encoding the same length of protein, most of the GC 3 content is higher than the GC 12 content. As the length of the code increases, the GC content of either GC 12 or GC 3 tends to increase slightly. But within the lengths between 1000 and 2000 nucleotide residues, the GC-contents (GC 12 and GC 3 ) are not obviously varied with the gene length (Okazaki fragment in bacteria is between 1000 and 2000 nucleotide residues; its corresponding protein length is between 333 and 667 or so). Here, only proteins of less than 1500 amino acids in length are considered. Codon bias has a very broad significance for exploring a genome. From the molecular level, codon bias can also explain the basic phenomenon of evolutionary process in biology [27] . Sometimes, the differences between RSCU values of different genomes can be used to describe the evolutionary distance. Numerical closeness of RSCU values between coding sequences shows the closeness of relationship [28] . Genetic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from different area may have different frequency of ancestral strains [29] . Diversity and disease pathogenesis for Mycobacterium tuberculosis from different area may show difference too [30, 31] . When the evolutionary relationship of 12 separated Mycobacterium tuberculosis is concerned, samples from different countries have subtle differences. Genetic relationship of them is shown in Figure 8 . Mycobacterium tuberculosis exists in most countries and exploring its codon usage bias is useful for understanding genetic characteristics and geographical differences of whole genomes. Although many scientists endeavor to study the Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the genetic perspective [32, 33] for its very important for defending tuberculosis [34] , its codon usage bias is not very clear until now. In this study, not only are traditional methods, such as ENC-plot, PR2 analysis, RSCU values, and phylogenetic analysis of 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes, studied, but also some new methods, CBI versus ENC and protein length versus GC 3S /GC 12 , are all explored; the former relationship describing the relationship between CBI and ENC could reveal their negative correlation characteristics. Relationship between protein length and GC content (GC 3S and GC 12 ) can reflect the changes of GC content within different coding sequences during the evolutionary process. Previous studies indicated that genetic diversity exists in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from different tuberculosis [35] when the samples are from different areas. Many studies also revealed that the host is an important factor that can affect the codon usage characteristics [36] . Overall RSCU values of overall 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes ( Figure 4 ) and their separated genomes ( Figure 5 ) all reveal strong codon usage bias. All these results combined with the relationship between CBI and ENC, protein length, and GC content (GC 3 and GC 12 ) show that the natural selection pressure is a little more important than mutation pressure. There are only 12 genomes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis analyzed in this work; although Mycobacterium tuberculosis exists in almost all countries. We selected 12 geographically representative genomes in order to analyze their regional differences. Codon usage differences of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from broader range and even from one area are not mentioned in this work; it is necessary to expand the scope of the genomes in the further study.
