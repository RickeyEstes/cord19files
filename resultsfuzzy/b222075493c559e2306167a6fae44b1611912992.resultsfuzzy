DNA was successfully extracted from 90 of the 99 egg samples (91%). Of the 62 autoclaved eggs, only two failed to yield sufficient quantities of DNA for further analysis. Of the 37 eggs that were not autoclaved, seven extracts were found to contain an insufficient quantity of DNA to proceed with species identification. The autoclaving process deemed necessary by AQIS, while likely to cause DNA shearing was not identified as an impediment to DNA amplification, at least for mtDNA amplicons identified here. Of the 90 samples that underwent successful DNA extraction, we sequenced two mitochondrial genes (Cytb and 12S) that resulted in the identification of 47 (52%) of the samples to species level (as judged by our criteria). Of all of the samples identified to species level, one was a CITES appendix I, critically endangered Yellowcrested cockatoo (Cacatua sulphurea; Table 1 ). A total of 10 species were identified, with the majority of samples assigned to Blackcapped lory (Lorius lory) and Eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) ( Table 1 ) [27] [28] [29] [30] . All of our egg samples were identified to the Order Psittaciformes ('true' parrots, New Zealand parrots, and cockatoos). The family level identification comprised 12% of the successfully extracted samples to Psittacidae ('true' parrots), and Cacatuidae (cockatoos; Table 1 ). Approximately one third of egg samples (36%) could only be identified to genus level, and included the following genera: Aprosmictus, Lorius, Eos, Trichoglossus, Pyrrhura, Cacatua, and Psittaculirostris. Table 2 shows the result of a survey of the number of currently available reference sequences for Cytb, 12S, and COI mitochondrial genes that were found on GenBank at the time of this study, for selected Psittaciformes species. The percentages of the selected species that have reference sequences for these mtDNA genes on GenBank are listed. The species that were chosen in this survey are those that are popular in the international exotic pet trade [31] . The lories and lorikeets appeared to have the least coverage of available reference sequences, while the Neotropical parrots had the best sequence coverage. Of note is the fact that the COI gene, while already widely known as the 'DNA barcoding gene' [32] , is currently not well represented in GenBank (or The BOLD database) for many exotic parrot and cockatoo species, compared with other species that are often encountered in the wildlife trade. In this study we chose to employ the Cytb and 12S mtDNA genes for species identification over that of COI for three reasons. (1) Cytb has a long history of use in avian phylogenetics and as a result is one of the better represented genes for avian species on GenBank [33] (see Tables 1 and 2 ). (2) In a comprehensive analysis of 217 mammals using Kimura 2-parameter distances, Cytb was shown to provide a greater ability than COI for separating species based on sequence data [34] . (3) . The 12S and CytB amplicons (approximately 230 bp and 500 bp respectively) were deemed a better choice than COI (amplicon of 648 bp) for samples that may have been degraded during the autoclaving process. In light of the limited coverage of reference sequences for certain Psittaciformes species on GenBank, it was decided that using two mtDNA genes, instead of just one, was more beneficial for the purpose of species identification. The benefit of using two mtDNA genes in this study to adequately identify each sample was evident, as in some instances only one gene was able to provide species level identification that fit our criteria. Another advantage of using two mtDNA genes for species identification is that it is possible to encounter the problem of numts, in which case, the chances of correctly identifying the species of the sample are improved with the use of multiple genes [15, 35] . In fact we recently detected a nuclear copy in GenBank for the Palm Cockatoo [36] where the published version of the CytB gene [37] is completely inconsistent with our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis. The presence of numts is at times difficult to detect, but can be investigated by translation of the sequence to identify stop codons, indels in coding sequences and variation in 3rd codon positions [35] . In our opinion the use of multiple genes also provides additional confirmation of correct species identification free of numts as similar tree topologies should be observed when the DNA is modelled. In the field of wildlife forensics, species identifications of biological remains are one of the most commonly requested tests for DNA labs [38] , yet surprisingly, there are very few studies that systematically describe, and defend the criteria that were used to assign species. The recent publication by the International Society for Forensic Genetics (ISFG) presents a number of recommendations regarding DNA testing of non-human samples [38] . We would advocate that two further recommendations be added to this list: Firstly, that DNA quantification (qPCR) should be Table 1 Samples identified to species level, conservation status, and available reference sequences [7, 22, [27] [28] [29] . Cytb: cytochrome b gene; 12S: mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA gene; COI indicates the commonly used barcoding gene cytochrome oxidase 1 [30] ; BOLD, barcode of life database [30] .

Secondly, that more than one mtDNA gene should be sequenced to reduce the chance of incorrect assignments due to the presence of numts. Ultimately, the ability to make accurate species assignments based on mtDNA sequences is underpinned by the coverage and quality of DNA reference databases, together with the accuracy of the taxonomic framework. Without a comprehensive knowledge of intra-and inter-species variation for the mtDNA loci used for species identification, regardless of percentage sequence similarity, there still may be doubt as to the accuracy of taxonomic assignments [39] . Importantly, if mtDNA sequence data are to be used in a legal context it is vital that reference sequences are fit for purpose and have passed the scrutiny of peer review. The use of 'unpublished data', or sequences without taxonomic provenance could compromise the fidelity of DNA based species identifications. The peer-review process, while it may not always ensure data fidelity, is still widely regarded as the best available test of scientific rigour and has long been used to establish the credentials of expert witnesses. The alternative is to instigate an auditing procedure to verify both the specimen and the sequence data that it is derived from, in the same way that COI DNA sequence data is scrutinised prior to addition to BOLD [30] . This task does, however, require considerable resources. Clearly there is a need for a diverse and highly reliable DNA reference database to use in species identity testing for wildlife forensic casework. An ideal DNA reference database should contain reference sequences that have been identified based on a solid taxonomic framework, and not where doubt still surrounds a species identity with that of closely related taxa [40] . Such a database should have a large number of individuals for each species and be available for more than one mtDNA gene so that a true indication of intra-specific variation can be assessed. As clearly highlighted in Table 1 , there is an obvious deficiency of reference sequences in which all three mtDNA genes (12S, Cytb and COI) are present, both in GenBank and in BOLD for the highly sought after avian species involved in the illegal trade. This disconcerting lack of reference samples for many parrot and cockatoo species may be in part due to the fact that Psittaciformes comprise approximately 359 species [29] compared with other fauna of forensic importance, such as elephant (in regard to the ivory trade), of which there are only a small number of species [41, 42] . This in itself presents a challenging task of sourcing adequate reference material, with provenance, for each species to build a comprehensive and robust DNA database in which to facilitate the process of DNA species identification. Difficulties in sourcing new reference material can cause substantial delays to the development of reference sequence data as, somewhat ironically, our laboratory routinely struggles to obtain reference samples (e.g. feathers or DNA) from overseas as CITES legislation does not allow the movement of body parts or derivatives without extensive documentation. Nevertheless, the task of compiling a 'fit for purpose' database should be systematically approached where prioritising commonly poached and traded species should be the logical first step. Utilisation of pre-existing sequence data that has already been satisfactorily audited, as in BOLD, could be used in conjunction with new DNA sequence data that is yet to be generated, for other mitochondrial genes. Gaining information on which species are commonly targeted for the wildlife trade can, in some cases, be surveyed. Recently a study was undertaken to survey the bird markets of Indonesia over a 5-year period [31] . It was found that much of the trade was conducted illegally, yet was carried out in open markets with the perception that the risk of being charged was minimal, despite there being legislation in place that prohibits this trade. Interestingly, the list of surveyed parrot and cockatoo species seen in the market included many of the same species identified in this study (Table 1) , including the critically endangered Yellowcrested cockatoo [31] . With surveys such as this, information gained on which species are being targeted could be used to prioritise the acquisition of reference material for the development of a DNA database, which could be utilised by wildlife forensic and conservation biologists with the aim of conserving avian species and more effectively prosecuting individuals involved in illegal wildlife trafficking.
