alkalosis. ■ Hypokalaemia is responsible for most clinical findings including: • hypertension (usually without associated complications) • headache • muscular weakness and possibly paralysis ■ Alkalosis may produce tetany. Classification ■ In primary hyperaldosteronism there are increased plasma aldosterone and reduced plasma renin levels ■ Secondary hyperaldosteronism is a consequence of renin-angiotensin system activation, seen in renal, cardiac and hepatic failure. In these patients there is hypokalaemia but no hypertension. Diagnosis ■ Plasma potassium -reduced ■ Plasma sodium -often raised ■ Plasma aldosterone -raised ■ Plasma renin -reduced ■ CT/MRI. Treatment ■ Spironolactone ■ Surgery.
