3.1. IC 50 for the inhibition of proliferation by bestatin and actinonin (IC 50p ) IC 50p values for bestatin on U937 cells reported in the literature are 58 mM [3] , about 150 mM [6,12] and 8 mM [11] . Because of these large differences we determined IC 50p values for bestatin and actinonin in our experimental system. IC 50p values determined on the 3rd day of the experiment are listed in Table 1 . IC 50p for actinonin is similar to values determined for other leukemia cell lines [22] . IC 50p for bestatin on U937 cells is within the range of the values obtained previously, but that for bestatin on K562 cells is ten times higher than the value reported by Sekine and coworkers [11] .
