While carrying out phosphorylation experiments on brush border membranes from the small intestine of rabbits, and searching for optimal P K A phosphorylation sites in LPH, we observed that this large bifunctional enzyme contains only one canonical P K A site (Arg/Lys-Arg/Lys-X-Ser/Thr, [18] [19] [20] [21] ), residing in its carboxy-terminus tail (Scheme 1 ). Experiments with pure LPH and pure C showed that in vitro, LPH is indeed a substrate for this kinase (Fig. 1A) . This phosphorylation was found to take place only upon addition of C (Fig. 1B) , showing that it is not due to a kinase impurity in our LPH preparation. In addition, it was shown to be completely blocked by the specific P K A inhibitor, PKI (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) , confirming that all the phosphorylation seen is by P K A only. It should be noted that LPH prepared from human tissue did not undergo any phosphorylation whatsoever (Fig. 1C) . In view of the high homology between the amino acid sequences of rabbit and of human LPH (83% identity, [7] ), the lack of phosphorylation in the human enzyme (Fig. 1C) , and the fact that the human LPH is lacking the P K A phosphorylation site around Ser 1916, it seems reasonable to conclude that the P K A phosphorylation is targeted to the tail of LPH where the sequence homology is rather low (Scheme 1). Furthermore, upon phosphorylation of rabbit LPH with [y-32p]ATP and subsequent cleavage of the radiolabeled enzyme at Leulg73-Ser 1874 (with chymotrypsin, as previously described in [10] ), all the radiolabel is detached from the core protein (data not shown), indicating that the phosphorylation occurs at Ser 1916, the only Ser residue in that tail which is within any P K A consensus sequence [21] . Attempting to assess the physiological significance of this phosphorylation, we monitored its stoichiometry under a variety of conditions. An example for such a determination is given in the experiment depicted in Fig. 2 Scheme 1. Positioning of LPH in the small intestinal brush border membrane. LPH is oriented either in an Nout-Cin or an NoutCou t orientation in the membrane. The approximate position of the potential phosphorylation site by PKA in rabbit LPH is indicated by a filled circle. The sequence of the C-terminus tail containing the potential phosphorylation site is indicated. Note that only rabbit LPH contains a potential phosphorylation site for PKA. The hydrophobic stretch that serves as the membrane anchor is underlined, and the cleavage site by chymotrypsin in rabbit LPH is indicated. Sequence data were taken from Mantei et al. [7] . other, we were not able to reach values beyond 0.2 mol 32p per mol of protein, as is often the case for phosphorylations carried out in vitro with detergent-solubilized membrane proteins. With the particular membranes used here, this difficulty is somewhat accentuated, in view of the presence of several phosphatases and proteolytic enzymes which are not easy to either inhibit or to remove completely. We therefore assessed the potential physiological relevance of this phosphorylation by attempting to find out whether it occurs in intact cells under physiologically relevant conditions. In view of the fact that membranes of the small intestine constitute a target for cholera toxin (CT), the clinical importance of this interaction, and the fact that CT is known to elevate intracellular cyclic A M P [22] , we attempted to find out whether CT affects the level of phosphorylation of L P H in intact cells. As seen in Fig. 3 , when an organ culture of an explant from the medial rabbit small intestine is pre-fed with 32p i (to radiolabel the intracellular pool of ATP) and subsequently stimulated by Fig. 3 (medial small intestine) and from an identical experiment using a sample from proximal small intestine. tRadioactivity in the LPH bands was determined with the Phosphor-Imager, and the amount of protein was estimated by elution of Coomassie blue R250 [30] from the LPH bands. treatment with CT, we observed an increased labeling of LPH (Fig. 3) . A series of experiments were carried out with explants from either the proximal or the medial small intestine, and the effect of CT on the labeling of the mature or the pro LPH was measured. As seen in Table 1 , there is an increase of 30 to 50% in the specific labeling of the LPH bands in all cases. Our finding that in intact cells the phosphorylation of Ser 1916 occurs intracellularly is further supported by our earlier demonstration that the luminal side of similar brush border membranes does not contain an ecto PKA activity [23] and does contain a kinase splitting membranal proteinase (KSMP), which rapidly cleaves and selectively inactivates the catalytic subunit of P K A [ 24 26 ]. On the other hand, using right-sideout vesicles from such membranes, we have shown that they contain a PKA activity (inhibited by PKI) with a cytosolic orientation [23] , which could be involved in the phosphorylation of the tail of LPH in vivo. In conclusion, this communication provides evidence to show: (a) that rabbit LPH is phosphorylated in vitro with pure LPH and pure C; (b) that the phosphorylation of the rabbit enzyme is directed to Ser 1916 which is within a canonical PKA phosphorylation site [21] in the rabbit enzyme (the lack of phosphorylation in the homologous human enzyme supports the selective targeting of this phosphorylation, since the human enzyme lacks a P K A canonical site around the Ser residue which is equivalent to the rabbit Set 1916, Scheme 1); (c) that upon clipping off the carboxy-terminus tail of LPH with chymotrypsin, the radiolabel is removed from the core protein; (d) that CT, which elevates intracellular cyclic AMP, brings about a significant increase in radiolabeling of LPH in intact cells, actually in an organ culture of the small intestine. These findings establish unequivocally the cytosolic orientation of the carboxyterminus tail of LPH, i.e. its Nout-Cin orientation (Scheme 1), and that this tail, the sequence of which had been established so far by cDNA sequencing only, is not post-translationally clipped, and is kept intact at least down to Set/916. The phosphorylation of the cytosolic tail in rabbit LPH by P Keller et al,/FEBS Letters 368 (1995) [563] [564] [565] [566] [567] PKA which occurs in the brush border membranes with a cytosolic disposition [23] may well have an as yet unidentified role. Significantly, all the three genes of LPH which are expressed differently along the small intestine [27] do code for the P K A consensus sequence which we find to be phosphorylated, In this context it should be mentioned that other once-spanning, stalked proteins of the intestinal brush border membrane have been recently identified as receptors of a coronavirus (aminopeptidase N, in the pig [28]) or of Clostridium difficile toxin A (sucrase-isomaltase, in the rabbit [29] ). It will be interesting to find out whether the difference between the human and the rabbit LPH is related to some other function of LPH, which differs in different species.
