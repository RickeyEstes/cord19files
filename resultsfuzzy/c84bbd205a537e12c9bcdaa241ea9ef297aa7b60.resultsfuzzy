The prioritisation lists are shown as centipede plots (Figs. 3-7). The diseases are ranked according to their final mean score after aggregation of weights of importance for the criteria with criteria measurements for each disease; the higher the score, the higher the priority of the disease. Standard deviation is also shown, and represents the variation in stakeholder opinion regarding the importance of the criteria included in the centipede plots for each disease. Standard deviation is specific to each disease score because the amount of variation in stakeholder opinion is different for each criterion (Table 6) , and the values for each criterion vary between diseases. The vesicular diseases -foot and mouth disease (FMD), swine vesicular disease and vesicular stomatitis -were the highest priority diseases for the stakeholders concerned most for livestock and industry impacts. FMD was the highest priority disease when only considering pig farm impacts with clinical signs reflecting the disease picture without imposed control measures and market loss (Fig. 3) . When market losses and cost sharing agreements were considered, and pig farm impacts were altered to reflect the instigation of control policies such as on-farm slaughter, swine vesicular disease and vesicular stomatitis (if undifferentiated from FMD) had highest priority to this group of stakeholders (Fig. 4) . The priority of swine vesicular disease relative to FMD was increased further when potential zoonotic effects were added (Fig. 5) . When differentiated from FMD, the priority of both swine vesicular disease and vesicular stomatitis reduced relative to FMD; this was the case regardless of the potential zoonotic impact of swine vesicular disease (Fig. 5 ). African swine fever and classical swine fever (acute form) were prioritised after the vesicular diseases, followed by the highly pathogenic form of porcine reproductive and respiratory disease (China 06-07 strain). Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome was also included in a less severe form and appeared as a much lower priority in all three livestock prioritisation lists. The weights of importance indicated that the zoonotic effects of diseases were not as important as the livestock and trade effects to this group of stakeholders (Brookes et al., in preparation) and this is reflected in the aggregated results for this group; diseases such as Nipah virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and rabies were not a high priority even once the zoonotic effects were added in the full impacts list. The zoonotic disease prioritisation lists use the weights of importance from the stakeholders who had a preference for the importance of zoonotic diseases (Brookes et al., in preparation) . When considering zoonotic effects alone (criteria vii-ix), the highest priority diseases were rabies, Nipah virus, Eastern equine encephalitis then Japanese encephalitis (Fig. 6) . When all the criteria were taken into consideration, these four diseases were interspersed with the vesicular diseases based on their zoonotic impact and high case fatality rate in pigs (Fig. 7) . Rabies was still highest priority overall, and the relative order of the other three changed to Japanese encephalitis, Eastern equine encephalitis then Nipah virus. The swine fevers and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome were lower priority on this list than the lists for the stakeholder group concerned about livestock disease impacts. Attack rate in pigs had a negative mean weight for this group of stakeholders ( Fig. 3 ) which caused diseases with high attack rate in pigs but low measurements for other criteria to appear lower on this list than expected -for example, swine vesicular disease when undifferentiated from FMD. The reasons and implications of this are discussed in Section 4. The sensitivity of disease score to individual criterion measurements for the stakeholders prioritising livestock diseases showed that attack rate in pigs at its maximum value (100%) gave the largest score (Fig. 8) . This demonstrates that changes to the value of this criterion give a proportionally larger change to the overall score for a disease, compared to equivalent changes in other criteria. The overall disease score is therefore most sensitive to changes in this criterion. Standard deviation in score was smallest for this criterion. A change in measurement of the incidence in humans made least difference to overall score, but standard deviation in score was large for this criterion. For the stakeholders prioritising zoonotic diseases, the overall score was most sensitive to disability (Fig. 9) . The standard deviation in score was also the smallest for this criterion, increasing for case fatality rate in humans and incidence in humans.
