iap-like2 (Table S3 ) using the two most stable reference genes EF1 and LA17A in the S. exigua were shown in Fig. 5A ,B. Additionally, 28S and ACT2 predicted as the two least stable genes, were applied for normalization to further verify whether the use of unstable reference gene can lead to an inaccurate relative expression (Fig. 5C,D) . At the same time, the results of the relative expression analysis of iap-like1 and iap-like2 using the two most stable reference genes EF2, L17A and the two least stable reference genes 28S and ACT1 in the IOZCAS-Spex-II-A cell line were shown in Fig. 5E -H. In this two samples, the fold changes of the two iap-like genes normalized with stable reference gene showed consistent results.
