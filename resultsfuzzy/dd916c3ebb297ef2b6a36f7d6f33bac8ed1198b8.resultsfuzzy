We identified 46 guidelines from 11 different organisations using a shortened timeframe [6, 7, (Fig. 1 ). Of the 11 organisations, only three published more than five RGs during that time period -WHO (n = 8), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE; n = 9), and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; n = 17). The nomenclature related to RGs was not uniform across organisations ( Table 1) . Table 2 depicts the key characteristics of the RGs evaluated. WHO guidelines (n = 8) were related to chronic infectious diseases including HIV and emerging infections [7, 11, 15, 22, 25, 31, 39, 47] . The reasons provided for RG were the sudden increase in incidence along with high case-fatality rates of the disease (e.g. human cases of avian influenza), the emergence of new treatment modalities, new evidence on existing treatments or new diagnostic tests. For two guidelines, HIV and infant feeding and tuberculosis in children, the rationale was not described [10, 11] . The development timeframe varied from 5 to 12 months. NICE Short Clinical Guidelines (n = 9) focused primarily on the diagnosis or treatment of chronic diseases [6, 26, 33, 34, 36-38, 49, 52] . The reasons for conducting an RG were not always clear; however, some RGs reported rationale as uncertainty in disease management or in clinical practice. The timeframe from the decision to develop a guideline to publication varied from 15 to 26 months. Of the 35 methods manuals previously identified on guideline development, only WHO, NICE and CDC provided guidance on RG development (Table 4 ) [1, 54, 55] .
