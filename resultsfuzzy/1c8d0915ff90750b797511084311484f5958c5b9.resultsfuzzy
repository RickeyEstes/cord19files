3.1. Pressure coefficient distribution Fig. 4(a) gives the pressure coefficient value at each test position. According to Eq. (1), the pressure coefficient is a relative quantity. The positive and negative values have a relation with the original measured value and the reference static pressure. It is observed that the differences of value among points at a certain floor could be distinguished, while the differences among floors were small, especially on the leeward and sideward façades. To have a better understanding of these data, a contour map was generated for qualitatively visualized wind pressure coefficient distribution on each wall surface. As shown in Fig. 4(b) and (d), the pressure coefficient distribution reflected a good symmetric tendency on the windward and leeward façades because of the symmetric geometry feature of the building. The highest P c value was up to 0.8 around the window area of UM5th unit, forming the stagnation zone. The outflowing air from the stagnation area could spread to all around. Most P c values were positive on the windward wall surface, while several negative ones showed at the lower floors near the edge. The P c values on the leeward side varied in a small range. Fig. 4 (d) implied a slight flow tendency from the lower two-third part to upper in the vertical direction and a main tendency from middle units to lateral ones in the horizontal direction. As shown in Fig. 4(c) and (e), the pressure coefficient distributions had a slice of difference on two corridor façades, but the range and variation trend of pressure coefficient along the façade were the same. According to ASHRAE [44] , there is a fluctuating reattachment flow on the sideward for a solid rectangular bluff body under normal wind direction. Since during the test process the sideward windows were open, the unsteadiness of the airflow around the openings on the sideward of Model A could be more complicated. Overall, the negative P c values on the leeward façade were higher than that on the corridor façades, indicating a possible surface backflow direction from leeward façade to corridor façades. The mean pressure coefficient distributions along building façades for Model B were shown in Fig. 5 . It is similar with Model A that the P c values of different floors on the sideward and leeward sides were very close. But the contour map for each side differs from that in Model A. On the windward side, a stagnation zone also showed around the window of UM5th unit. The P c values at upper floors were higher than those at lower floors. This situation appears on the leeward side as well, resulting from the cross-building airflow. It is obvious that the values shown in the contour maps for sideward and leeward sides in Fig. 5 were higher than that in Fig. 4 . In other words, compared with Model A, the pressure coefficient value difference at each floor between windward façade and leeward façade in Model B was smaller, as well as the difference between windward façade and sideward façade. Fig. 6 gives the tracer gas normalized concentration of Model A when the source located at the units of UM column. The framework in the graph for each case could be considered as the stretch-out view of the building façades. The number in each grid box is the average normalized concentration value in the corresponding sample location of each room. Both the signal intensity and color grey scale were used to represent the concentration level. The signal was divided into five grades, as shown in the legend. On the whole, wherever the tracer gas was released, the concentrations varied with the locations of measuring points under prevailing wind direction. The source unit got the highest concentration value and a unique full signal. The concentrations at other flats universally decreased with the distance from the releasing flat along the vertical direction. In addition, the concentration distributions along the corresponding "R" and "L" columns in each case also had good symmetric features. Tracer gas generated quite high concentrations at the units horizontally closest to the source unit.
