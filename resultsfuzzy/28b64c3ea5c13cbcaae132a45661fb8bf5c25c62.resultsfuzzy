Sequence identity of the subunits in VNTR of CLEC4M Gene Work by our team and others showed that the VNTR in CLEC4M gene varied in size from 4 to 9 repeats [18] . In this study, we analyzed the sequence identity of each subunit among VNTR of 4 to 9 repeats alleles of 145 samples from different continental populations by clonal sequencing. Figure 1 shows the various haplotypes of each subunit and the prevalent subunit orientation in each VNTR alleles. Only eight different haplotypes account for all sequence variations of all subunits. H2 is the most parsimony one and thus used as the consensus sequence. According to the sequence identity in the 69-bp repeat unit, seven other haplotypes are identified (denoted as H1-H8) ( Figure 1 ). Different numbers of these subunits assemble to form the VNTR alleles of different length. The most prevalent subunit structures of each VNTR are described in Figure 2 . The detailed haplotype configurations in VNTR locus for all studied samples are found in Table S1 .
