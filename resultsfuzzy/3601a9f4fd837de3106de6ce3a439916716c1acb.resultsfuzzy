Assay principle and optimum conditions of the fluorogenic reaction A novel fluorogenic reaction [14] with catechol, borate, and NaIO 4 was used for the assay of HIV-PR activity in this study (Scheme 1). This reaction could provide fluorescent derivatives for synthetic peptides. However, N-terminal acetyl peptides did not form such a fluorescent peptide. Therefore, an N-terminal acetyl octapeptide, Ac-RKILFLDG, containing an HIV-PR cleavage site was employed as the substrate. It was not necessary to remove excess substrate and acetyl product (Ac-RKIL) from the reaction Scheme 1. Schematic protocol for the spectrofluorometric assay of HIV-PR activity. The N-terminal acetyl octapeptide as the substrate was hydrolyzed by HIV-PR in a lysate of cells. The generated peptide was selectively converted to the fluorescent compound by a novel fluorogenic reaction with catechol, NaIO 4 , and orate. mixture after the enzymatic hydrolysis because no FL signals from these peptides were produced by this reaction, whereas another product FLDG was selectively reacted. Therefore, the enzyme activity of HIV-PR could be readily assayed by measuring the FL intensity of the FLDG derivative. The fluorogenic reaction conditions were optimized by using the synthetic peptide, FLDG. The fluorogenic reaction was carried out for different reaction times (5-15 min) at 100°C and pH 7.0 (Fig. 1A) . The maximum yield of the fluorescent product was observed at 10 min. When the fluorogenic reaction was carried out for 10 min at pH 7.0 under the different temperatures of 80 to 120°C (Fig. 1B) , the fluorescent derivative was produced by the high temperatures of the reaction. However, the FL intensity was gradually decreased at a higher temperature than 100°C, probably due to instability of the fluorescent product at the higher temperatures. The FL production was also greatly affected by pH of sodium borate solution. For the pH examination, the fluorogenic reaction was carried out at 100°C for 10 min (Fig. 1C) . The signal could not be detected at a lower pH than pH 6.0; however, the maximum signal was obtained at approximately pH 7.0. The concentrations of catechol, NaIO 4 , and sodium borate at pH 7.0 were individually optimized, and then the maximum signal was obtained by the use of 0.83 mM catechol, 0.17 mM NaIO 4 , and 50 mM borate (pH 7.0) at 100°C for 10 min in the aqueous reaction mixture. Our previous article [14] using an amino acid amide, phenylalanine amide, reported a reaction mechanism for this fluorogenic reaction in which a high production yield of the fluorescent derivative of phenylalanine amide was obtained with the reaction time of 20 min at 120°C. When this fluorogenic reaction with the peptide (FLDG) was carried out at 120°C for 20 min, however, the production yield of the fluorescent derivative of the peptide was approximately 65% of that at 100°C for 10 min. The different conditions between the peptide and the amino acid amide might be caused by the stability of the fluorescent products given that the product of the amino acid amide was more stable than that of the peptide. The stability of the product of the peptide was investigated by measuring the FL intensity after the fluorogenic reaction. The product was stable at 0 to 4°C for at least 48 h, although the product was unstable at 100°C and slightly unstable at room temperature. Therefore, the reaction mixture was cooled in an icewater bath after the fluorogenic reaction until detection. A standard curve for the synthetic peptide of FLDG was made by this fluorogenic reaction with the peptide in the range from 0 to 30 lM in the enzymatic reaction mixture in the absence of the substrate and HIV-PR to determine the concentration of FLDG generated by the enzymatic hydrolysis with HIV-PR. As shown in Fig. 1D , a linear relationship was observed between the FL signal and the peptide concentration (y = 3.647x + 1.08, r 2 = 0.990, where x and y indicate the concentration of the peptide and FL intensity, respectively). Therefore, the close correlation between the FLDG concentration and the FL intensity makes it possible to carry out the quantitative assay of HIV-PR activity.
