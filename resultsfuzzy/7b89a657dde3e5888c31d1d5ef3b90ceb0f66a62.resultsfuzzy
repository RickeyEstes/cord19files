Co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b marks both IL-10-producing CD4 + and CD8 + T cells 189 LAG3 and CD49b co-expression was previously reported to be a cell surface signature for 190 both mouse and human IL-10-producing CD4 + T cells that lack the expression of Foxp3 (also 191 known as type 1 regulatory T cells, Tr1 cells) [15] . We and others have previously reported that both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells (Fig. 1A) . Surprisingly, the resultant IL-10-producing CD8 + T cells 197 induced in vitro through this protocol also exhibited high levels of LAG3/CD49b co-expression 198 ( Fig. 1A , last plot). In fact, IL-10-producing CD8 + T cells can express higher levels of LAG3 and 199 CD49b than their IL-10-producing CD4 + counterparts induced in the same cell culture (Fig. 1B) . determine whether co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b is exclusive to Foxp3 -Tr1 cell subset, we 210 infected IL-10 GFP /Foxp3 RFP dual reporter mice with Nb, and analyzed the IL-10-producing T cells. 211 We found that, as previously described, a large majority of the IL-10-producing T cells in the lungs 212 of Nb-infected mice express high levels of both LAG3 and CD49b (Fig. 2A&B) , and are 213 .

However interestingly, these IL-10-producing 214 LAG3 + CD49b + CD4 + T cells included both Foxp3 + and Foxp3 -CD4 + T cells subsets (Fig. 2C , last 215 plot; and Fig. 2D ). To further determine whether LAG3/CD49b co-expression is correlated with 216 IL-10 and/or Foxp3 expression in CD4 + T cells, we compared the percentage of LAG3/CD49b 217 double positive population in Foxp3 -IL-10 -, Foxp3 -IL-10 + , Foxp3 + IL-10and Foxp3 + IL-10 + CD4 + T 218 cells isolated from the lungs of Nb-infected mice. We found that regardless of expression of Foxp3, 219 Nb infection did not lead to significant up-regulation of LAG3/CD49b co-expression on IL-10 -CD4 + 220 T cells (Fig. 2E&F) . However, the percentage of the LAG3 + CD49b + population of IL-10 + CD4 + T 221 cells is significantly higher than their IL-10counterparts ( Fig. 2F) . Moreover, the levels of LAG3 222 and CD49b expression are similar between the Foxp3 + and Foxp3counterparts of IL-10 + CD4 + T 223 cells (Fig. 2G) . Therefore, IL-10-producing CD4 + T cells, regardless of Foxp3 expression, have a 224 high capacity of co-expressing LAG3 and CD49b. Together with the data shown in Fig. 1 , these 225 data suggest that co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b is a generic feature of IL-10-producing T 226 cells, including Foxp3 -Tr1 cells, Foxp3 + Treg cells and CD8 + T cells. 227
