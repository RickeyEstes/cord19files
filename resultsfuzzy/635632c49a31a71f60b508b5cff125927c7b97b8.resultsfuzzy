The system was tested in both cooling and heating modes under actual climatic conditions. Figs. 4 and 5 show the variations of voltage, current and solar radiation on the test day in cooling mode and heating mode, respectively. It can be seen that the voltage and current increase as solar irradiation increases. In cooling mode, the current is 1.9A and the voltage is 8 V when the solar radiation is 236 W/m 2 . When the solar radiation is increased to 1177 W/m 2 in cooling mode at 12:45, the current and voltage reach the maximum values of 6.31A and 28.1 V respectively. In heating mode, the maximum current and voltage of the SDEATHP system are 28.2 V and 6.14A respectively, and when the solar radiation is 878 W/m 2 at 12:25 on the test day, the current and voltage decrease with the decrease of solar radiation. Figs. 6 and 7 show the electrical power of the SDEATHP in relation to solar radiation on the test day in cooling and heating modes, respectively. It can be observed that increase in irradiation intensity leads to increase in the electric power of the SDEATHP system. The maximum electric power is about 177 W at the solar radiation value of 1176 W/m 2 in cooling mode, and in heating mode, the maximum electric power is about 173 W at the solar radiation value of 876 W/m 2 . It can also be seen from Figs. 6 and 7 that the electrical efficiency of the PV system is also affected by solar radiation because the thermoelectric cooling modules are directly connected to the PV system without maximum power point tracking. The maximum electrical efficiency is 13.7% when the solar radiation is 736 W/m 2 ; and the minimum electrical efficiency is only 1.1% when the solar radiation is 330 W/m 2 in heating mode. In cooling mode, the maximum electrical efficiency is 15% when the solar radiation is 640 W/m 2 and the minimum electrical efficiency is only 2.8% when the solar radiation is 111 W/ m 2 . Fig. 8 shows the variations of inlet fresh air temperature (T fin ), outlet fresh air temperature (T fout ) and indoor temperature (T in ) in cooling mode. It can be seen that the temperature of the outlet fresh air is maintained at 26.4 °C to 29.3 °C, which is 5.4-9.9 °C lower than the inlet fresh air temperature of 32.7 °C to 37.9 °C. During the test, the indoor air temperature is maintained at 23 °C to 26 °C, and the outlet fresh air temperature is only 0-6 °C higher than it. Fig. 9 shows the relative humidity of inlet fresh air and outlet fresh air in cooling mode. The relative humidity of outlet fresh air is between 77% −79% while the relative humidity of inlet fresh air is between 44% −61%. This is because the lower the fresh air temperature is, the lower the relative humidity is, and so the relative humidity of the outlet fresh air is greater than the relative humidity of the inlet fresh air. Fig. 10 shows the variations of inlet fresh air temperature, outlet fresh air temperature and indoor temperature in heating mode. It can be seen that fresh air supply temperature is lower than indoor temperature when the system starts to work, and as the solar irradiation increases, the temperature of outlet fresh air gradually increases from 13.8 °C to the maximum value of 31.8 °C at 12:05. Meanwhile, the fresh air supply temperature is about 12 °C higher than the indoor air temperature. After 2:30 pm, the fresh air supply temperature gradually decreases from 29.1 °C to 21.2 °C at 16:30. The maximum temperature difference of outlet fresh air and inlet fresh air is 14.7 °C when the solar radiation is 852 W/m 2 and the indoor temperature is controlled within 18-22 °C most of the time. Fig. 11 shows the variations of the cooling capacity, COP c and voltage of the SDEATHP system in cooling mode. Due to changes in solar irradiation, the cooling capacity of the system fluctuates greatly, with values between 52 W and 295 W. The cooling capacity reaches the maximum value of 295 W when the voltage is 26.2 V, but when the voltage reaches the maximum value of 27.6 V, the cooling capacity is just 216 W. This is because the cooling capacity of the SDEATHP system is affected by the voltage and other factors, such as inlet fresh air temperature and exhaust air temperature. As shown in Fig. 11 , the COP c of the SDEATHP system decreases as the operating voltage increases. The maximum COPc can reach 14.2 at 15:40, and the minimum COPc is only 0.51 at 13:10. This is because the larger the voltage is, the larger the temperature difference between the hot and cold sides of the thermoelectric modules is, resulting in lower COPc. Fig. 12 shows that the heating capacity, COP h and voltage of the SDEATHP system vary with time. It can be seen that after the system starts working, the heating capacity gradually increases from 38.7 W to 300.8 W at 11:40, and then gradually decreases because of solar radiation. It can be observed that the heating capacity drops rapidly after 12:05, but the voltage remains at around 28 V. This is because the temperature of the inlet fresh air increases and the indoor temperature decrease at the same time, and the sharp increase of the temperature difference between the cold and hot sides of the thermoelectric cooling system leads to sharp decrease of heating capacity. As shown in Fig. 12 , the COP h of SDEATHP sys- tem is affected by the voltage, and the larger the voltage is, the larger the COP h is. The system can obtain a larger heating factor before 10:00 and after 15:40 because the operating voltage is small. The maximum heating coefficient is 5.6 (9:10), and the minimum heating coefficient is 1.29 (10:00).
