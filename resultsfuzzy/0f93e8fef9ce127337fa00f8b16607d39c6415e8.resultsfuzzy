Considering that the intestinal tract is an important organ for lowering serum uric acid concentrations, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed and demonstrated marked alterations of the gut microbial communities in the Dis group. The rarefaction analysis curves for each group were near saturation, revealing that the sequencing data had a great quality and that certainly few new species were present ( Figure S2 ). NMDS (nonmetric multidimensional scaling, Figure 4a (Figure 4g,h) . LEfSe was performed to identify significant microbiota composition differences between the groups. Seven differentially represented core major groups were identified (Figure 4i,j) . Differentially abundant phylum detected showed that Proteobacteria (LDA = 4.7644853231) phylum was most dominantly present in Dis group. At the genus level, the microbiota of the Con group was enriched with Bacteroides (LDA = 4.80848153017) from the Bacteroidetes phylum and Lactobacillus (LDA = 4.22406025945) from the Firmicutes phylum. At the species level, the microbiota of the Con group was enriched with Bacteroides vulgatus (LDA = 4.79658975077) from the Bacteroidetes phylum.
