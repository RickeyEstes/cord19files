When the 42 dogs were classified according to their clinical signs, as described by Mancianti et al. (1998) , 13 (31%) were symptomatic, 22 (52%) oligosymptomatic and 7 (17%) asymptomatic. The most common clinical sign presented by the dogs was lymphadenopathy, mainly of the superficial cervical lymph nodes. Red blood cell counts revealed a high frequency of anaemia: 20/42 dogs (47%) presented with erythrocyte counts (mean value 5.09 · 10 6 /lL; standard error 1.09 · 10 6 /lL; reference range 5.5-8.5 · 10 6 / lL), haemoglobin concentrations (mean value 11.07 g/dL; standard error 2.59 g/dL; reference range 12-18 g/dL) and haematocrit (mean value 34-43%; standard error: 6.21%; reference range 37-55%) all below reference values. When these parameters were analysed on the basis of reticulocyte counts, the anaemia was shown to be normocytic, normochromic and non-regenerative. As it was considered to be a more reliable red blood cell index than total erythrocyte count or haemoglobin concentration (Willard et al., 1994) , only the haematocrit value was used to obtain correlations between anaemia and the clinical signs of each dog, as well as between anaemia and sandfly infection rates. Dogs with low haematocrit values infected more female sandflies than those presenting with normal values. On the other hand, no correlation was observed between haematocrit values and clinical signs presented by dogs. Twenty-nine dogs presented with normal leucocyte counts, while nine had leucocytosis (always with degenerative left shift) and four had leucopenia. No correlation was found between leucocyte count and clinical signs in these animals. This observation was also true for each leucocyte category, except for lymphocytes; asymptomatic dogs presented with the highest lymphocyte counts, followed by oligosymptomatic and symptomatic animals (P < 0.05). Significant correlations were found when the categories were compared (P < 0.05). Although no positive correlation could be elicited between clinical category and eosinophil counts, 5/9 dogs with exfoliative dermatitis had eosinophilia. Only 7/42 dogs had thrombocytopenia, but none of these presented with haemorrhage. One dog had epistaxis but a normal platelet count. No correlation was found between clinical category and platelet counts. The cut off point for total IgG ELISA was 0.05 and the absorbance values ranged from 0.069 to 0.559. To permit statistical analysis, absorbance values were approximately divided into three parts of the range values and then categorised as ''low'' (0.096-0.190), ''medium'' (0.191-0.380) and ''high'' (0.381-0.559). When the clinical category was compared with total IgG ELISA absorbance, no significant difference was found between absorbance values for symptomatic and oligosymptomatic dogs (P > 0.05), although asymptomatic dogs showed significantly lower absorbance values than the other two clinical categories (P < 0.05), as can be seen in Fig. 2 . All dogs presented positive results to IgG 1 and IgG 2 ELISA tests. The values for the second immunoglobulin subclass were significantly higher than those of the first (P < 0.0001). Absorbance values of the IgG subclasses were categorised as IgG T to permit further statistical analysis. Thus for IgG 1 , in which the cut-off point was 0.05, the optical density (OD) values were categorised as ''low'' (0.055-0.3), ''medium'' (0.301-0.6) or ''high'' (0.601-0.96) based on antibody levels. The cut-off point for IgG 2 was 0.084 and values for low, medium and high antibody levels were set at 0.092-0.320, 0.321-0.640 and 0.641-0.961, respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed when the clinical categories were compared with IgG 1 absorbance values. On the other hand, when this comparison was made for OD values of IgG 2 , significant differences were seen between dogs of different categories. The difference was more pronounced when asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic animals (P < 0.001) were compared than when the former were compared with symptomatic ones (P < 0.05). The variations for each category are shown in Fig. 3.
