Participants 147 In this prospective observational study, a total of 528 participants were enrolled. Figure 1  148 summarizes characteristics of the participants. The mean age was 46.7 ± 16.4 years. 69.4% (n 149 = 297) of participants were males, and 78.2% (n = 413) were patients (Table 1) Table 2 showed mean temperatures and Bland-Altman analysis among the participants 157 under different environment. Compared with tympanic temperature as golden standard, the 158 mean difference ranged from -1.72 to -0.56°C for the forehead measurement, and -0.96 to 159 -0.61°C for the wrist measurement. We observed a lower variation in wrist than forehead 160 temperature measurements. 161 Outdoor participants were divided into four types as walk, bicycle or electric vehicle, car, 162 and inside the car. For those who walked, the agreement limits for wrist and tympanic was 163 between -2.05 and 0.34°C; -4.07 and 0.64°C for forehead and tympanic (Figure 2A, B) . For 164 those who used bicycle or electric vehicle, the agreement limits for wrist and tympanic was 165 between -2.14 and 0.93°C; -3.82 and 0.84°C for forehead and tympanic ( Figure 2C, D) . For 166 those who were transported by car, the agreement limits for wrist and tympanic was between 167 -1.43 and -0.44°C; -1.47 and -0.36°C for forehead and tympanic ( Figure 2E, F) . For those 168 who were inside the car, the agreement limits for wrist and tympanic was between -1.54 and 169 -0.15°C; -2.41 and 0.16°C for forehead and tympanic ( Figure 2G, H) .

Wrist measurements had 171 the higher percentage of differences falling within ± 0.5°C than forehead measurements in 172 these four types. 173 For indoor patients, the agreement limits for wrist and tympanic was between -2.70 and 174 -0.77°C; -1.91 and 0.80°C for forehead and tympanic (Figure 3) . 57.1% of forehead values 175 were included within ± 0.5°C, followed by wrist values (41.4%). We also explore the 176 agreement of left and right wrists ( Figure S1 ). The mean bias is 0.00. The agreement limits 177 for wrist and tympanic was between -0.74 and 0.74°C. It showed good agreement between 178 right and left wrists. 179 180
