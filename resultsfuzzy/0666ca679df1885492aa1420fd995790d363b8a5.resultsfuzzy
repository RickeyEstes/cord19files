Cells stably expressing human CCR5 and human or primate CD4 (x-axis) were infected with Q23ΔEnv-GFP bearing (A) chronic Envelopes (Envs) [49], (B) early (newly infected; grey bars) and chronic (6 months post infection; black bars) Env pairs derived from the same patient [3, 14, 50, 51] , shown for one patient in each panel, or (C) Envs derived from maternal (chronic; black bars)/infant (newly infected; grey bars) transmission pairs [9] , with one mother-baby pair shown in each panel. The percent cells infected (GFP-positive) was measured by flow cytometry and normalized to the percent infected with human CD4. Error bars represent the mean + SEM from two independent experiments, each with two to three technical replicates. Data associated with this figure can be found in the supplemental data file (S2 Data). CCR5, C-C motif chemokine receptor 5; GFP, green fluorescent protein. receptors with early HIV-1 isolates representing each of the four major group M (pandemic) HIV-1 subtypes. These four Envs, isolated from patient blood shortly after initial infection [36, 52, 53] , were pseudotyped onto the Q23ΔEnv-GFP virus, as described before. While human CD4 supported entry of all of these viruses, primate CD4 orthologs supported levels of HIV-1 entry that ranged from 2-to 58-fold lower ( Fig 3A) . Collectively, our study has explored a breadth of HIV-1 isolates taken from patient blood, representing all of the major subtypes found globally, and has found that they can all be phenotypically described by their selective use of only certain primate CD4 receptors. Next, we wanted to understand more about why blood-derived HIV-1 Env isolates demonstrate this selective use of only some primate CD4 receptors. Thus far, all of the Envs that we have tested are from CCR5-tropic viruses isolated from the blood. There are three types of HIV-1 in the body of an infected person: CCR5 T cell-tropic (the most abundant form in the blood, utilizing the CCR5 coreceptor), CXCR4 T cell-tropic (in the blood but using an alternate coreceptor, C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 [CXCR4]), and CCR5 macrophage-tropic (rare in the blood, usually found in the central nervous system) [29,54-56]. Only the first of these transmits to new individuals, whereas the latter two types arise in special evolutionary niches within the human body during the course of chronic infection and rarely transmit [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] . In this study, we did not consider or test CXCR4-utilizing viruses. We next tested HIV-1 pseudotyped with Envs from four macrophage-tropic viruses [31, [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] for their ability to infect cells bearing primate CD4 receptors ( Fig 3B) . In stark contrast to the blood-derived isolates tested above (Figs 1, 2 and 3A), macrophage-tropic viruses were promiscuous in their use of all CD4 receptors tested. For each primate CD4 tested, the median relative infection for all early HIV-1 Envs (Fig 3A) was significantly lower than macrophage-tropic Envs (Fig 3B; P < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test). Macrophage-tropic HIV-1 Env is known to bind CD4 with higher affinity compared to other forms of HIV-1 Env [73] [74] [75] . This is a selected property that these virions possess because macrophages have lower densities of CD4 molecules on their surface [74] . Based on this, we hypothesized that weak CD4 binding affinity is what makes most blood-derived HIV-1 Envs sensitive to small sequence differences in CD4 receptors from different primates. To test this, we first purified a soluble version of the human CD4 receptor for use in neutralization assays (sCD4, consisting of the D1 and D2 domains of CD4) (S3 Fig) . When sCD4 is preincubated with HIV-1, it is known to competitively inhibit virus interaction with the CD4 expressed on the cell surface and block virus entry [76] . Our purified human sCD4 behaved identically to a commercially available version (S3 Fig). HIV-1 pseudotyped with early or macrophage-tropic Envs was preincubated with increasing concentrations of sCD4 and then used to infect TZM-bl indicator cells (HeLa CD4/CCR5 cells that express luciferase in response to HIV-1 tat expression). HIV-1 pseudotyped with either of two different early Envs (BG505 or AC10.0.29) was neutralized in a dose-dependent manner by human sCD4 (Fig 3C) . As expected, HIV-1 pseudotyped with either of two macrophage-tropic Envs (BaL or SF162) was neutralized by human sCD4 to an even greater extent, consistent with these viruses having a higher affinity for CD4 ( Fig 3D) . The IC 50 values are shown within each panel and are approximately 4-fold higher for early Envs than for macrophage-tropic Envs. In conclusion, the broadened ability to enter cells through the CD4 receptors encoded by all primates tested ( Fig  3A and 3B ) correlates with tighter CD4 binding (Fig 3C and 3D) . Macrophage-tropic HIV-1 isolates, which are known to bind human CD4 more tightly, are promiscuous in their use of primate CD4 receptors. (A, B) Cells stably expressing various primate CD4 receptors (x-axis), along with human CCR5, were infected with Q23ΔEnv-GFP pseudotyped with (A) early HIV-1 Envelopes (Envs) or (B) Envs from common macrophagetropic HIV-1 isolates. The percent cells infected (GFP-positive) was measured by flow cytometry and normalized to the percent infected with human CD4. Error bars represent the mean + SEM from two independent experiments, each with two to three technical replicates. Values above error bars represent fold decrease in viral entry relative to human CD4, only indicated for those samples that passed significance thresholds (one-way ANOVA for repeated measures effect, Dunnett's test; P < 0.05). (C and D) Infection of TZM-bl cells with Q23ΔEnv-GFP pseudotyped with early (C) or macrophage-tropic (D) Envs. Each virus was preincubated with increasing concentrations of human soluble CD4 (sCD4) as a competitive inhibitor. TZM-bl cells are HeLa CD4/CCR5 cells that express luciferase in response to HIV-1 tat expression, read in relative light units (RLUs). Error bars represent the mean + SD from one biological replicate (n = 3 to 4 technical replicates), representative of two independent experiments. Error bars are not plotted in instances in which the size of the error bar is less than the symbol size. IC 50 values from the soluble CD4 neutralization assays are shown within each panel, for which the mean and SD values reflect the variation of the IC 50 calculations from two independent experiments. (E and F) Same as C and D, only neutralization assays were performed with chimpanzee and rhesus macaque sCD4 instead of human sCD4. Data associated with this figure can be found in the supplemental data file (S3 Data). CCR5, C-C motif chemokine receptor 5; GFP, green fluorescent protein. We next wanted to confirm that weak binding to human CD4 receptors results in a loss of binding to primate CD4 receptors. We purified chimpanzee and rhesus macaque sCD4 (S3 Fig) and tested the ability of these proteins to neutralize different classes of HIV-1. Viruses bearing macrophage-tropic Envs (BaL or SF162) were neutralized by chimpanzee and macaque sCD4 (Fig 3F) , while viruses bearing Envs from early HIV-1 isolates (BG505 or AC10.0.29) were not neutralized to an appreciable degree ( Fig 3E) . Collectively, these data suggest that most early HIV-1 isolates from the blood, which have lower affinity for human CD4 compared to macrophage-tropic viruses, do not bind well to chimpanzee and macaque CD4. This shows that our entry assay for selective versus promiscuous use of primate CD4s is essentially a readout of CD4 binding affinity. To further test this premise, we next created a panel of Envs engineered to have high, medium, or low binding affinity for CD4. BG505 Env, the prototypic early Env discussed above, was engineered to have two different point mutations, one at position 281 and the other at position 375. These mutations in Env have been previously shown to increase binding affinity to CD4, although only one of them has been characterized within the BG505 Env background [77, 78] . Consistent with these previous reports, the A281V mutation subtly increased binding to human sCD4 relative to wild type (demonstrated by increased neutralization by sCD4), while the S375Y mutation resulted in a more substantial increase ( Fig 4A) . While both of these mutations were originally characterized because they increase entry via macaque CD4 [77, 78] , we found that both mutations also improve entry via all of the primate CD4 receptors tested, with increasing improvement as the binding affinity for CD4 increases (left to right in Fig 4B) . This pattern of increased binding affinity for human CD4 and increased ability to enter cells via primate CD4s also correlated to increased binding affinity for primate CD4 receptors, as read in a neutralization assay with purified chimpanzee and rhesus macaque sCD4 proteins (left to right in Fig 4C) . Finally, we engineered two additional mutations into HIV-1 BG505 Env that have been shown to increase CD4 binding and to increase entry via macaque CD4 [77] . These mutations also make Env able to more efficiently mediate entry via all primate CD4s tested, not just that of macaques ( Fig 4D) . These data support the general premise that promiscuous use of primate CD4s can be created by mutations in Env that increase CD4 binding affinity. Further, the promiscuous use of primate CD4 receptors is not just a property of macrophage-tropic viruses but instead may be a common property of viruses engineered or adapted to bind CD4 more tightly. The fact that virtually no blood-derived HIV-1 isolate that we have tested has this phenotype (promiscuous use of primate CD4 receptors) suggests that this phenotype is strongly selected against in the human body. The reasons for this are unknown. We then employed a virus-free approach to confirm that the mechanism of selective use of certain primate CD4 receptors stems from weak CD4 binding, as opposed to other interactions between HIV-1 and CD4 that may occur during the course of an infection. Cells expressing HIV-1 Env on their surface were mixed with cells expressing human CCR5 and various primate CD4 receptors ( Fig 5A) . Cellular fusion was assessed using a split luciferase reporter system in which, upon cell-cell fusion, the two halves of luciferase merge and produce a functional enzyme [79] . We used this assay to test the interactions between four different Envs and six different CD4 receptors, as shown in Fig 5B. In this system, the phenotypes seen in our previous infection assays were largely recapitulated despite the fact that this assay is virus-free and only requires three proteins (Env and CD4/CCR5). The early Envs mediated fusion most efficiently with cells expressing human CD4, while the macrophage-tropic Envs broadly engaged and fused with diverse primate CD4 receptors. This assay, when taken together with the experiments employing purified CD4 described above, reveal that weak binding to CD4 is An early Env engineered to have weak, medium, or tight binding to CD4 becomes progressively more promiscuous in its use of primate CD4 receptors. (A-C) Amino acid substitutions were introduced into the BG505 Envelope (Env) at position 281 and 375. The headers at the top describing these mutations pertain to panels A, B, and C. In each column, the indicted Env was pseudotyped onto Q23ΔEnv-GFP. (A) Each of the three viruses was preincubated with increasing concentrations of human soluble CD4 (sCD4) and then used to infect TZM-bl cells, which are HeLa CD4/CCR5 cells that express luciferase in response to HIV-1 infection and tat expression, read in relative light units (RLUs). Error bars represent the mean + SD from one biological replicate, representative of two independent experiments. Error bars are not plotted in instances in which the size of the error bar is less than the symbol size. IC 50 values are listed on each panel, for which the mean and SD values reflect the variation of the IC 50 calculations from two independent experiments. (B) Cells stably expressing the indicated CD4s (x-axis) and human CCR5 were infected with each virus. The percent cells infected (GFP-positive) was measured by flow cytometry and normalized to the percent infected with human CD4. Error bars represent the mean + SEM from two independent experiments, each with three technical replicates. Values above error bars represent fold decrease relative to human CD4 for those samples that passed significance thresholds (one-way ANOVA for repeated measures effect, Dunnett's test; P < 0.05). (C) Same as panel A but with chimpanzee and rhesus macaque sCD4 instead of human sCD4. (D) Two additional single point mutations were introduced into the BG505 Env, which have also been shown to increase binding affinity for CD4 [77] . These Envs were pseudotyped onto Q23ΔEnv-GFP and used to infect cells stably expressing the indicated CD4 (top of each graph) and human CCR5. The percent cells infected (GFP-positive) was measured by flow cytometry and normalized to the percent infected with human CD4. Error bars represent the mean + SEM from two independent experiments, each with two to three technical replicates. Values above error bars represent fold increase relative what makes most blood-derived HIV-1 isolates (i.e., those fueling the global pandemic) selective in their use of only certain primate CD4 receptors. 


Section:fig 2. selective use of primate cd4 receptors is not a result of the transmission bottleneck and instead is seen in many isolates of hiv-1 taken from human blood.
