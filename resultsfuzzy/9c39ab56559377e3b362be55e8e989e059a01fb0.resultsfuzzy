Spatiotemporal pattern of expression of the BRE-eGFP reporter during lung development Previous studies utilizing two independent canonical BMP pathway reporter mouse lines, one harboring a BRE-eGFP [33] and another harboring a BRE-lacZ allele [39] have demonstrated expression of the BRE-eGFP and BRE-lacZ reporters respectively in the epithelium of trachea and primary-bronchi already at around E10-E12.5. To extend these findings and map in detail the spatiotemporal pattern of canonical BMP signaling in the lungs, we collected lung tissues from the BRE-eGFP reporter mice at embryonic days E11, E12, E13.5, E14.5, E16, E17.5, E19.5 and postnatal days 1, 15 and 2 months and analyzed tissue sections for eGFP expression. Our analysis demonstrated that the BRE-eGFP reporter was active already at E11, reached maximal levels around birth, thereafter declining to minimal levels in the adult ( Figure 1 and Figure S1 ). Around E11, eGFP expression was confined to the endothelial cells of the large pulmonary vessels, and the developing vascular network in the parenchyma. A very small fraction of sub-epithelial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) expressed very low levels of eGFP at E12 ( Figure S1 ). However, from E13.5 onwards robust eGFP expression was detected in sub-epithelial SMCs located at the proximal regions of the developing airways (Figures 1 and Figures  S1 and S2) . From E16 onwards, expression of eGFP was detected in both proximal and distal epithelial compartments.In the proximal epithelium (i.e. the developing airways) eGFP expression exhibited a proximal-distal axis pattern, with high eGFP expression in bronchi and large airways and surprisingly no expression at the distal portion of the growing airway tree. Interestingly, isolated clusters of eGFP pos cells were observed at the tips of airway branch-points. In the distal lung compartment, eGFP expression was detected in cuboidal epithelial cells of the developing saccules ( Figure 1B ). As lung morphogenesis approached completion, the eGFP signal was reduced and in adult mice,(,2 months old), few eGFP pos cells were detected scattered in the epithelium of bronchi and large airways, in the alveolar compartment and in a subpopulation of cardiac cells in the outer layer of the tunica media of the pulmonary veins ( Figure 1B ) [40] .
