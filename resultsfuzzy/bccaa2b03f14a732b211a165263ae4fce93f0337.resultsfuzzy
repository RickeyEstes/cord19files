The WEKA platform [11] was used in our experiment. It is a well-known data mining software that supports a wide range of data mining algorithms with a friendly user graphical user interface. All models were built using 10-fold cross validation. Here, we discuss the obtained prediction models. In the J48 decision tree recovery model, shown in Fig. 2 , the attribute healthcare personnel appears as the first splitting attribute. This indicates the importance of this information. The model can be interpreted as follows: if the patient is a healthcare personnel, the model predicts recovery. However, if the patient is not a healthcare personnel then the model examines whether he has any pre-existing disease. If the patient suffers from other diseases, the model predicts death, otherwise recovery is predicted. According to this model, healthcare personnel are more likely to survive MERS-CoV infections. This could be due to the vaccinations that healthcare workers are required to get on regular basis. Fig. 3 shows the stability model using J48 decision tree algorithm. This model shows that the two important attributes for predicting stability are symptomatic and age. The model first checks symptoms, if symptoms exist, then the age of the patient is examined. The status of patients between the ages of 66-87 are predicted as critical. From this model, we conclude that old patients are at high risk of developing MERS-CoV complications.
