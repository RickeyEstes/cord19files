It is generally accepted that research complications due to overt infectious diseases are significant and that clinically ill animals should not be used for scientific experiments. The effect of clinically silent infections, however, may be devastating, because they often remain undetected. Scientists in general are not well informed of such influences on their research. Only a small percentage of detected complications has been I10 published. The literature is scattered across diverse scientific journals, and many articles are difficult to locate. To address this problem, conferences have been held on viral complications on research, and the knowledge available summarized in conference proceedings (Bhatt et al., 1986a; Hamm, 1986) . The problem has been reviewed by Lussier (1988) , the National Research Council (1991) and Hansen (1994) . Research complications may occur in various ways. Although acute clinical signs may not be observed, infected animals may show altered behaviour, suppressed body weight, or reduced life-expectancy, which may, for example, influence the tumour rate. Micro-organisms present in an animal may lead to contamination of samples and tissue specimens such as cells, tumours, sera and monoclonal antibodies. This may interfere with experiments performed with cells or isolated organs. The experiment itself may be a stress factor and increase the sensitivity to an agent, and thus induce clinical disease or death. Environmental factors, such as increased temperature or relative humidity (for example, in metabolic cages), may induce stress which activates latent infections resulting in lung complications caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus or Pneurnocystis carinii, especially in immunodeficient animals. Naturally, various microorganisms can interact and lead to clinical disease or research complications, which are dependent on the combination of micro-organisms. The disease rate is not only dependent on the host, but also on specific properties of the infectious agents. There are different strains of many viruses, with different organotropism (e.g. hepatotropic, enterotropic and neurotropic strains of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)). This influences the disease rate and the mortality, as well as the type and severity of pathological changes. For example, the immunosuppressive variant of the minute virus of mice (MVMi) replicates in lymphocytes, whereas the prototype strain (MVMp) replicates in fibroblasts, thus resulting in different effects on animals or experiments. Both variants usually do not induce clinical disease, but may affect various parameters such as wound healing, immunological reactivity, tumour growth and development, embryonic development and birth rate. Various effects are possible on the function or the morphology of organs or cell systems. Histopathological changes that resemble adenomas have been observed in the trachea or bronchioles during the regenerative phase after a Sendai virus infection. When pathogens infect laboratory animals, the immune system is activated regardless of the level of pathogenicity. Many micro-organisms have the potential to induce functional suppression or stimulation of the immune system. Sometimes, only T cells, B cells or specific subpopulations are influenced. Therefore, most virus infections and infections with bacteria or parasites are detrimental to immunological research and must be avoided. Some micro-organisms have a specific effect on enzymatic or haematological parameters. Lactate dehydrogenase virus (LDV) can induce an up to 100-fold increase in the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and other enzymes in the plasma. Numerous reports exist in the literature about modulation of oncogenesis. Infectious agents may induce cancer, enhance chemical or viral carcinogenesis, or reduce the incidence of cancer. Some organisms even influence the growth rate of transplantable tumours. Immunosuppressed animals are usually more sensitive to infections than are immunocompetent animals. Infections in immunodeficient animals frequently result in increased mortality due to a reduced or absent resistance to low pathogenic or even commensal micro-organisms. It is important for various reasons that animals used for infection studies are free from adventitious infections. The infection in question might be influenced by an adventitious organism by means of immunomodulation and, therefore, result in increased or reduced resistance to experimental infection. Micro-organisms resulting from a natural infection might contaminate viruses, bacteria or parasites that are passaged in laboratory animals. Spontaneous infections may lead to false conclusions. For example, the first isolations of Sendai virus were made from mice that had been inoculated with diagnostic materials from humans and swine. In subsequent years, evidence accumulated to show that an indigenous virus of mice had been isolated (National Research Council, 1991) . Some examples of virus interference with research are given in Table 1 for a mouse virus (MHV) and in Table 2 for a rat virus (Kilham rat virus (KRV) ). Guberski et al. (1991) , Darrigrand et al.
