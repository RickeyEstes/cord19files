Seropositivity of BTV was detected in the two groups (4.6% in the group of Medenine vs. 9.7% in the group of Kebili). This study confirms the circulation of serotype 1 in Tunisia that was detected for the last time in 2011 (Sghaier et al. 2014) . For BTV, Tunisia has adopted a vaccination strategy in sheep using a bivalent vaccine (BTV1 and BTV4), but dromedaries are not vaccinated. Three species of Culicoïdes were predominantly detected in the south of Tunisia (Gabes governorate): Culicoïdes jumineri, Culicoïdes sahariensis and Culicoïdes submarimitimus although Culicoïdes imicola is considered the main vector of BTV (Mellor 1996; Sghaier et al. 2009 ). According to Batten et al. 2011 , dromedaries seem to act as reservoirs, possibly playing a role in the spread of the disease by helping the virus to get through the geographic barrier which is represented by the Sahara desert. This desert stands between the tropics and subtropics, where BTV is endemic, and North Africa, where it periodically causes epizootics. However, there is scarce information about the clinical manifestations of BT in dromedaries. South American camels are susceptible to BTV infection, but they develop only a mild form of the disease (Schulz et al. 2012) . For WNV, this study revealed that 25.8% of the dromedaries, which live in oases, were seropositive. This result is consistent with the findings reported by Ben Hassine et al. , where a high seropositivity in horses was found in the oases of Kebili that were identified as high-risk areas for WNV circulation in Tunisia. Moreover, the presence of Culex pipiens in the south of Tunisia and isolation of WN virus from C. pipiens in central Tunisia (lineage 1) confirms this finding (Wasfi et al. 2016) . Recent studies in http://www.ojvr.org Open Access North Africa reported WNV seropositivity rates in dromedaries ranging from 13% (Touil et al. 2012) to 29% (El-Harrak et al. 2011 ). Similar to human and horse populations, in which less than 1% of WNV-infected individuals become severely ill, it appears that the majority of camels infected with WNV are asymptomatic and recover uneventfully. No evidence for the circulation of RVF and EHD viruses are revealed in this study. Serologic evidence of RVF in dromedaries is frequently reported (Swai & Sindato 2015) , yet the description of clinical signs is rare. Subclinical, mild forms and healthy carriers of the virus (Paweska 2015; Swanepoel & Coetzer 2004 ) have been reported. The presence of the RVF competent vector C. pipiens and Aedes caspius in oases make this ecosystem favourable for RVF transmission in Tunisia where Aedes could be responsible for the initiation of an outbreak and Culex maintains the virus activity (Soti et al. 2012) . For EHDV, dromedaries seem not to be involved in the disease transmission. The study conducted by Wernery et al. (2013) using ELISA test showed that 29% of dromedaries from the United Arab Emirates have antibodies to EHDV.
