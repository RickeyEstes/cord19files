For easier comparison with other previous studies the normalized results (with respect to swept volume of the hinged door) are shown in the last column of Table 1 . The normalized air exchange seems to vary between 58e81% for hinged door and between 13e42% for sliding door depending on the tested scenario. The hinged door results agree reasonably well with findings reported in previous studies. For instance, Eames et al. [29] reported the exchange volume to be comparable to but less than swept volume of the hinged door. On the other hand, Kiel and Wilson [54] found out the typical exchange volume (for hinged door) to be only around 50% of the swept volume. Kalliomâ‚¬ aki et al. [20] measured the exchange volume (for hinged door) to be 59e124% and Hathway et al. [22] measured it to be 67e98% of the swept volume of the hinged door. However, one should note that most of the above mentioned studies were carried out in scale models with different door cycle times and/or without ventilation. So, one should be cautious while directly comparing the results. Comparison of sliding door results is more challenging since there are no other normalized (experimental) results readily available.
