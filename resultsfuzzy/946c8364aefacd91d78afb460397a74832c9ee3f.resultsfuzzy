Syncytin and HIV-1 gp160 shared similar structural profiling By sequence analysis and alignment, we found that syncytin and HIV-1 gp160 shared similar structural profiling, especially in the core structure, which was crucial for membrane fusion. Alignments of the sequences of NHR and CHR in syncytin and those in HIV-1 gp160 revealed that they have high sequence similarities (44% and 62%, respectively, Fig. 1A) . The fusion peptide (FP) was located at the N-terminus of syncytin TM subunit and consisted of hydrophobic, glycine-rich residues, which was essential for the initial penetration of the target cell membrane in many enveloped viruses, e.g., HIV-1 [23, 24] . The hydrophobic 4-3 heptad repeat (HR) regions located adjacently to the N-and C-terminal portions of syncytin TM subunit were named as NHR and CHR, respectively (Figs. 1B and C). In HIV-1 gp41, these two regions form a stable, a-helical trimer of antiparallel dimers (trimer-of-hairpins), also called six-helix bundle, which represents the fusion-active core structure [25, 26] . We built a single chain NHR + CHR construct (named 2-helix protein) to test whether the 2-helix protein can represent the fusion-active core structure of syncytin.
