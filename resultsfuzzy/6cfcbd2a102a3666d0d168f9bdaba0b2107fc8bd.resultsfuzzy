The following observations have been made in the qualitative analysis of the responses: • The concept of epidemiological confirmation was not well understood. For example travel in endemic countries was equivocally seen as an epidemiological confirmation (e.g. haemorrhagic fever and travel to Egypt). Re-evaluation of the case definitions showed that in fact there was only a vague definition of the epidemiological confirmation. • Participants appeared to have difficulties in deciding whether all clinical signs and symptoms mentioned in the case definition had to be existent in a case, or whether they were only listed as descriptive examples. • Case examples of diarrheal disease without any evidence of a specific pathogen, were frequently classified as salmonellosis. • Laboratory findings with only one elevated antibody value in serum were repeatedly classified as laboratory detection although the case definition required a rise in antibody level. • In some case definitions detection of the pathogen is only accepted if the detection was done in specific materials (normally sterile material such as blood for detecting N. meningitidis). This limitation was frequently neglected. • Some of the information in the case definition intended to serve as additional background information was mistakenly used as selection criteria (e.g. statement that clinician described rash as "very typical" for measles, but fever was missing). When asked about the availability of the case definitions, 395 (99%) of 398 local health departments responded that the case definition were accessible at the work place. The case definitions were seen as useful by 377 (95%) of 397 health departments who answered this question and not useful by 20 (5%). The clarity of the individual sections of the case definitions was rated differently: The section on the clinical picture of the case definitions was seen as unambiguous in all case definitions by 72 respondents (18%), in the majority of case definitions by 305 (76%), in the minority by 20 (5%), and in none of the case definitions by one (0.3%) of the respondents (n = 398 respondents). The section on the laboratory confirmation of the case definitions was seen as unambiguous in all case definitions by 137 respondents (34%), in the majority of case definitions by 248 (62%), and in the minority by 11 (3%) (n = 396). Three-hundred and three (87%) of 347 health departments stated that case classifications were done exclusively or primarily by public health nurses. With respect to the case examples presented to the participants, 220 (55%) of 396 respondents (from the local health departments) stated that the case examples were realistic.
