The result of discriminant analysis shows that the overall model is acceptable (Wilks' lambda = 0.673, p = 0.022 b 0.05, see Table 3 ). In other words, the aforementioned factors in the analytic model can be used to distinguish the adopters and non-adopters of esignature. For synchronic discriminant, two important indexes, which explain discriminant analysis results, are discriminant loading and standardized discriminant coefficient [13] . Using discriminant loading can avoid the collinear problem and is relatively stable when analyzing small samples. The standardized discriminant coefficient is used to compare the relative importance of predicting variables [7] . In general, discriminant loading has to be greater than 0.3 to be significant. Among the eight variables, the "hospital size", "government policy", "adequate resources", and "vendor support" have discriminant loading greater than 0.3 and therefore contribute significant influence in discriminating the two groups. In other words, these variables have a significant effect on whether or not a hospital decides to adopt e-signature. Both adopters and non-adopters of e-signature consider indifferently in "system complexity" (with means of 3.6316 and 3.7193), "internal need of a hospital" (with means of 3.5789 and 3.9912), "user involvement" (with means of 3.8229 and 3.4792), and "security protection" (with means of 3.3828 and 4.0260). In other words, the above four factors do not influence the willingness of adopting e-signature with insignificant discriminant loadings as −0.235, 0.216, 0.183, and −0.039, respectively.
