Using the experimental conditions described in the 'Methods' section, we tested the Poxviridae 16-plex (Table 4 ) against vaccinia virus, Lister strain DNA. As assessed by agarose gel analysis, we achieved specific amplification of the predicted 617-bp amplicon for the target vaccinia genome (lane 3, Figure 7 ). The band does not appear in the no template control shown in lane 4 ( Figure 7 ). To confirm that the amplicon observed in gel analysis was a specifically amplified product from vaccinia virus, Lister strain, we sequenced the product according to the procedures described above. An analysis of the high-quality sequence read data taken from the electropherogram yielded a 95% identity (maximum) to vaccinia virus, Lister strain (AY678276.1) with a query The forward and reverse primers (FP, RP) in bold are predicted to amplify vaccinia Lister with the indicated product length (617-bp amplicon size). coverage of 99% and an e-score of 0 (no data shown). These values indicate that the sequenced product was vaccinia DNA and not amplification from an exogenous nucleic acid source, e.g. host cell. Notably, our multiplex reaction did not produce a smear (lane 3, Figure 7 ) that would be indicative of nonspecific priming of either the target or exogenous host cellular nucleic acids. While the exact manufacturer's extraction protocol is proprietary, it is generally known that a standard sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation step is used to enrich for the viral capsids prior to viral nucleic acid extraction. However, to the best of our knowledge, no nuclease digestions are performed prior to viral capsid lysis. Furthermore, while the viral 'extract' contains a mixture of both viral DNA and cellular nucleic acids, the exact proportions of host cell and viral nucleic acids cannot be determined. Thus, our results indicate that a multiplex of 16 primers of 10 nt each amplifies only the specific predicted band from vaccinia. In some applications, such as clinical or biodetection applications, the exogenous nucleic acids from other eukaryotic sources, notably human sources, may be present in varying and unknown concentrations. To test the effects of background human genomic DNA on the performance (amplification specificity) of the Poxviridae 16-plex primer set, we conducted PCR reactions across a series of mass ratios of vaccinia Lister DNA:human genomic DNA at 1 : 1, 10 : 1, 100 : 1, 1000 : 1 and 10000 : 1. These correspond to approximate copy number ratios of vaccinia : human genomes of 1.3 Â 10 4 : 0.82, 1.3 Â 10 4 : 0.082, 1.3 Â 10 4 : 0.0082, 1.3 Â 10 4 : 0.00082 and 1.3 Â 10 4 : 0.000082, using genome sizes of 1.9 Â 10 5 bp and 3 Â 10 9 bp for vaccinia and human DNA, respectively. For context, there are 6.58 pg or two copies of the genome in one human cell. Our algorithm predicted 233 amplicons between 50 and 1000 bp from the human genome. In experiments, this would appear as a 'smear' on the agarose gel, which indeed was observed for the mass ratios of 1 : 1 and 10 : 1 (Figure 7 , lanes 6 and 7, respectively). However, even at a ratio of 10 : 1 vaccinia:human DNA (lane 7), the 617-bp vaccinia amplicon is clearly visible on the gel, despite the numerous nonspecific amplicons. At ratios of 100 : 1, 1000 : 1 and 10000 : 1 (lanes 8, 9 and 10, respectively, Figure 7) , the smear is drastically reduced to nonexistent (at the resolution of the agarose gel), and the vaccinia amplicon is readily visible. For comparison, we tested the 16-plex primers against the same mass of human DNA in the absence of vaccinia DNA at 2.7 pg (the 1 : 1 ratio mass), 0.027 pg (100 : 1 mass) and 2.7 Â 10 À4 pg (10000 : 1 mass) (lanes 12, 13, and 14, respectively, Figure 7) . The data show a similar smear at 2.7 pg as was observed when vaccinia DNA was present (lane 6). However, the low-intensity 617-bp amplicon from vaccinia is visible in lane 6 (with vaccinia) while a similar amplicon is not present in lane 12 (without vaccina). These results provide evidence that amplification with these family level primer sets will depend on viral titers in the actual sample, and that there are cases where amplification will either not be possible or require additional sample purification steps. However, as discussed further in the next section, specific amplification with a short-primer multiplex could be used for selective enrichment of viral targets by generating amplicons with known sequence, which may be feasible for viral detection if combined with a probebased amplicon detection method such as TaqMan Õ or Luminex bead based suspension arrays (http://www .luminexcorp.com/). We compared recently published conserved Orthopoxvirus primers (36) to the 148 Poxviridae genomes, and computational predictions suggest that 67 of the available genomes might not be amplified by the two primers they designed for the Orthopox genus. These included a number of monkeypox, ectromelia, several vaccinia and a couple of variola strains. However, in permissive hybridization conditions it is possible that primers would anneal despite mismatches to target, allowing more of the targets to be amplified. Four conserved Orthopoxvirus primers from an earlier publication (37) , before many of the Poxviridae genomes were available, do not match 53 genomes, including a number of monkeypox, ectromelia, camelpox and one variola minor genome. The primers in (37) included inosine bases, which we replaced with each possible A, T, G and C base in all possible combinations for our primer-target comparison. Thus, published Orthopoxvirus primers may fail to amplify many desired targets.
