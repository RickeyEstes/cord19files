The number of PD patients who had a cold with high fever requiring bed rest prior to the onset of PD was slightly less than that in the other groups, but the differences were not statistically significant (Table 3) . After the onset of PD, significant differences in the frequency of such flu-like illness appeared between the PD and the normal control groups (p Ͻ 0.001), and between the PD and CVD groups (p Ͻ 0.005), but no significant difference was found between the two control groups ( Table 4 ). Many of the PD patients never caught cold and only 4 PD patients (2.9%) suffered cold with a high fever requiring bed rest; this was markedly different from the controls. No subject reported that they caught cold more frequently or with more severe symptoms after the onset of PD. The results of more detailed statistical analysis regarding pre-and post-onset changes using x 2 test are shown in Table  5 . Forty-three of the 139 PD patients (30.9%) showed a decreased frequency of colds or flu-like illnesses postonset as compared with pre-onset (responses 4,5,6). This compared with 3 of 67 of their spouses (4.5%) and one of 37 CVD patients (2.7%) reporting a similar change in susceptibility (p Ͻ 0.001). Only 1.4% of the PD patients reported flu-like episodes (response 3), a significantly lower percentage than in the controls. The PD group was further analyzed to determine whether taking amantadine hydrochloride or levodopa affected the frequency of colds. No differences were found in the frequency of colds in PD patients taking different antiparkinsonian medication (detailed data not shown). Nor did the severity or duration of PD have any apparent effect on the susceptibility to colds.
