The early warnings of the outbreak As early as Dec 31 st , 2019, most of the cities (326 out of 346) have exhibited at least some awareness of the emerging Wuhan outbreak (Fig. 2B) . However, awareness then decreased until Jan 19 th , 2020, one day before the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed human-to-human transmissions of the novel coronavirus. Since Jan 20 th , 2020, overall awareness has increased by a magnitude of at least five, demonstrating significant awareness across all cities (Fig. 2B ). Awareness remained low as the epidemic spread, falling close to its lowest point on the starting day of Chunyun (Jan 10 th , 2020). Considering cities that showed initial novel coronavirus awareness levels at least 1.5 times that of the search term "common cold", we found a total of 166 alert cities as early as Dec 31 st , 2019 (48 cities at a tighter threshold of = 3.0 times, illustrated in Fig. 2A) . However, awareness decreased significantly during Chunyun. The evolution of public awareness over time followed an unusual pattern. In a typical UAU process, people are unaware of emerging catastrophic events until they are told by their social contacts. They remain aware during the event, and awareness then fades subsequently 2, 26 . However, during the Wuhan outbreak, the public experienced a process as aware-unaware-aware, with public awareness declining during the early phase of the outbreak. Dividing cities into two groups of equal size according to the numbers of reported SARS cases, we found the cities that had been struck by SARS to be more alert ( p < 0.05 ) during onset (2B). Therefore, we believe the SARS memory still conditions public awareness. We provide evidence of its effects at the end of this section.
