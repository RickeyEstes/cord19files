The LSDV GPCR gene plasmid standard was used to determine the analytical sensitivity of the assay using a dilution range between 10 7 -10 1 /Î¼l (Fig. 2) . The LSDV RPA assay was performed eight times on the molecular standard, in which 10 7 -10 3 DNA molecules were detected in 8/8 runs, 10 2 , 7/8 and 10 1 , 2/8 (Fig. 3a , Additional file 2: Table S2 ). Due to the inconsistency in the results, a probit regression analysis was applied, in which the sensitivity in 95 % of cases was determined at 179 DNA molecules/ reaction (Fig. 3b) . While the real-time PCR analytical sensitivity was 37 DNA copies/reaction [16] . The LSDV RPA assay showed no cross detection with orf virus, bovine papular stomatitis virus, cowpoxvirus, Peste des petits ruminants and Blue tongue virus (serotypes 1, 6 and 8) genome. SPV and GPV, however, were detected by the LSDV RPA assay as well. The LSDV RPA assay was validated using 12 negative skin samples and 22 LSDV positive skin nodule samples. In comparison to real-time PCR, clinical sensitivity and specificity of the LSDV RPA assay was 100 % (Additional file 1: Table S1 ).
