Prevalence of SIVs with truncated or full-length PA-X. To explore the relationship between truncation of PA-X and viral adaptation in swine, we analyzed the frequency of the PA-X truncations in SIV by year based on all SIV sequences available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Influenza Viruses Resource, regardless of subtype and lineage. As shown in Fig. 1 , the PA-X proteins in all SIV cases were full-length before 1985, following which the number of SIVs containing truncated PA-X gradually increased. By 2015, more than 90% SIVs possessed truncated forms of PA-X. These data suggested that the truncation of PA-X protein may play an important role in the adaptation of SIV in pigs.
