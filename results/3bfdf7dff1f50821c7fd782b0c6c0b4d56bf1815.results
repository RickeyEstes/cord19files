The role of PHLP in emergency response PHLP plays an important role in the overall functioning of the health system during emergencies (7, 8) . Providing legal assistance in the midst of a disaster is central to any response plan (9, 10). Adini et al. (11) found that following standard operating procedures in an emergency is crucial for assuring preparedness. Other aspects of legal preparedness relate to the status of volunteers and their ability to provide humanitarian aid after a disaster (12) . Orenstein (13) asserts that some laws, though appropriate for routine health activities, may hinder operations during emergencies. While declaring a state of emergency may facilitate waiving laws, the implications of such waivers must be carefully evaluated. During emergencies, as maintained by Courtney et al. (14) , healthcare providers operate under challenging conditions that may require deviation from existing treatment protocols, necessitating the development of strategies to protect against legal liabilities. Similarly, Chan (15) argues in favour of granting legal immunity to private physicians to protect them against damage claims. Conversely, it is important to protect the vulnerable population from uncertified personnel performing beyond their capacity. According to Wang (4) , this issue manifests itself more intensely in situations of cross-national mutual aid that are regarded as reciprocal gestures of goodwill, where programmes cross boundaries and achieve their expected goals quickly. Thus, it is important to define obligations and rights and to establish roles, items, and standards. Other researchers (5, 6) perceived the competency of health workers as one of the core elements of PHLP.
