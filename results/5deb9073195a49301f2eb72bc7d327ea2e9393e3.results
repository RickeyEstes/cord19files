Induction of DUSP1 during SeV and RSV infection. To first assess a potential function of DUSP1, we analyzed DUSP1 expression during the course of SeV and RSV infection in A549 cells by immunoblot. DUSP1 was induced by about 4 fold at 6 h of RSV infection and was returned to basal levels at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 1A) . DUSP1 steady state levels remained unchanged during SeV infection (Fig. 1A) . Because DUSP1 turnover was previously reported to be affected by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway 35 , we further analyzed DUSP1 levels during SeV and RSV infection in the presence of the 26 S proteasome inhibitor MG132. In the presence of MG132, induction of DUSP1 is detectable in both infections and the overall DUSP1 levels were markedly increased compared to control cells (Fig. 1B) . These results imply that DUSP1 protein levels are induced in response to SeV and RSV infection and that DUSP1 is subjected to proteasome-mediated degradation. DUSP1 does not affect SeV and RSV replication. Next, we sought to determine whether DUSP1 belongs to the numerous negative regulators of the antiviral response induced in response to virus infections 9, 36 . First, because of their importance in the control of the IFN-mediated antiviral defense, we evaluated whether DUSP1 has an impact on the signaling cascades leading to NF-κB and IRF3 activation. Considering previous characterization of NF-κB activation in the context of RSV infection 37 , IκBα-S32 and p65-S536 phosphorylation were analyzed. Activation of IRF3 was monitored through detection of IRF3-S396 phosphorylation 38 . Ectopic expression of DUSP1 in A549 cells did not alter IκBα, p65 or IRF3 phosphorylation profiles observed during the course of SeV ( Fig. 2A,B ) or RSV infection (Fig. 2C) , showing that DUSP1 does not play a role in the regulation of these defense pathways. Additionally, ectopic expression of DUSP1 in A549 cells neither significantly altered SeV N mRNA levels measured by qRT-PCR ( Fig. 2D top panel) nor the de novo production of RSV virions quantified by plaque assay (Fig. 2D bottom panel) . Consistently, RNAi-mediated silencing of DUSP1 did not alter the capacity of RSV to replicate in A549 cells (Fig. 2E ). Together these data indicate that DUSP1 does not negatively regulate the capacity of the cell to mount an antiviral response to restrict RSV or SeV replication.
