Samples are routinely submitted to the UMVDL to detect the causative agents of clinical disease. Between March and September 2014, 102 veterinarians submitted 10,127 individual samples, which corresponded to 2723 case IDs from 382 different swine companies. Out of the 102 submitting veterinarians, 31 veterinarians submitted case IDs that were positive for PDCoV. Veterinarians submitted case IDs from both negative and positive swine companies (Fig. 1) . The samples were submitted from Canada, Chile, Mexico, and US (Table 1) . While all case IDs from Canada and Chile were negative for PDCoV, only one case ID submitted from Mexico was positive for PDCoV. The 6.9% of case IDs submitted from the US were positive for PDCoV. Twelve of the 25 states represented in this sample set were positive for PDCoV while North Carolina, Indiana, Ohio, and Iowa had the highest percentage of positive case IDs (>10%) (Fig 2) . The majority specimens were intestines (n = 854), feces (n = 619), fecal swabs (n = 358), and oral fluids (n = 602). To estimate the relationship between the positive case IDs and specimen, specimens were grouped by case ID into 8 different categories and the odds were estimated using feces as a reference (Tables 2). Oral fluids contained the highest percentage of positive case IDs (12.1%) and had 1.89 times higher odds (95% CI: 1.28-2.82) to test positive for PDCoV than feces. Interestingly, the odds of PDCoV detection in fecal swabs and intestines were lower compared to feces, OR = 0.45 (95% CI: 0.22-0.85) and OR = 0.62 (95% CI:0.40-0.98), respectively. Samples were further categorized into age groups to investigate the association between age and PDCoV detection. A majority of the case IDs were from suckling piglets (n = 397) while 1554 case IDs lacked age demographics (Table 3) . Pigs in the 43-56 day age group had the highest percentage of PDCoV positive case IDs (8.4%) while pigs in the >147 age group had the lowest percentage of positive case IDs (3.6%). There were no statistical differences (p > 0.01) in the OR of being PDCoV positive between the different age groups. While there was no statistical difference for detecting PDCoV by age group, we wanted to investigate the association between specimen and age group, which was possible since there was no interaction between age and specimen (Table 4 ). Environmental and miscellaneous categories were removed from the analysis since these specimens are not associated with an age group. In the >147 day age group, PDCoV detection had 59% lower odds than suckling pigs (OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.17-0.90). Oral fluids had 2.05 times higher odds (95% CI: 1.40-3.05) of PDCoV compared to feces while intestines and fecal swabs had lower odds of PDCoV detection compared to feces, OR = 0.51 (95% CI: 0.31-0.83) and OR = 0.44 (95% CI: 0.22-0.82), respectively. The age and specimen were further adjusted by state to investigate the association with state, and the odds were similar to Table 4 (not shown); however, the AIC value was lower, indicating state should be included in analysis with this data set (Table 5) . We further investigated the seasonal component of PDCoV detection in diagnostic samples. The percentage of positive PDCoV was <13% between March and September 2014 (Fig 3) . In July 2014, the occurrence decreased to <4% while in September, the occurrence was <1%. While there was no evidence of a direct seasonal relationship within our data set, there was a strong trend, indicating a decrease of PDCoV in diagnostic samples during the summer. The 19 new PDCoV sequences were aligned with the 23 available PDCoV sequences from GenBank China (n = 3), Hong Kong (n = 2), South Korea (n = 1), and US (n = 17). The complete PDCoV genome sequences from the US and South Korea shared a 99.7-100% nucleotide identity while sharing a 98.9-99.3% nucleotide identity with the strains from China and Hong Kong. A time-scaled maximum clade credibility (MCC) phylogeny was inferred for the concatenated open reading frames (24,507 nt). In the phylogenetic tree, the 36 US and single Korean strains group together in a clade (posterior probability = 1.0) (Fig 4) . Viruses from different states are mixed within the tree, evidencing of extensive spatial dispersal of the virus and multiple viral introductions into states such as Minnesota, Michigan, Indiana, and Illinois. The diversity of US PDCoV strains traces back to a common ancestor that is estimated to be between August 2010 and September 2012, indicating that PDCoV has recently emerged in the US swine population. The viruses from Asia are not closely related, and inferring the origin country of PDCoV is difficult. The phylogeny is consistent with dispersal of PDCoV from the US to South Korea, although the lack of PDCoV genetic data from other countries makes this inference tenuous. The evolutionary rate of the PDCoV genome is estimated to be 3.8 × 10 −4 substitutions/site/year (2.3 × 10 −4 -5.4 × 10 −4 , 95% HPD). The evolutionary rate of the Spike gene (3483 nt) is estimated to be 2.0 × 10 −3 substitutions/site/year (8.2 × 10 −4 -3.4 × 10 −3 , 95% HPD).
