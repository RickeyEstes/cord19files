Demographic characteristics. Between January 2011 and December 2013, 1,126 SARI cases aged 15 years and older were enrolled ( Table 1 ). The median age was 33 years (interquartile range 26-42 years) and 489 (43.4%) were male. Of 1,109 patients with available HIV status (98.5%), 558 (50.3%) were HIV infected. Thirteen individuals reported receipt of influenza vaccination in the previous year. Viruses detected among SARI patients. One or more respiratory viruses were identified in 533 (47.3%) enrolled SARI cases (Table 1) . Influenza viruses were detected in 163 (14.5%) SARI cases. When tested for the extended panel of respiratory viruses (N = 1,123) (Figure 1 ), rhinovirus was detected in 149 (13.3%), coronavirus OC43 in 49 (4.4%), RSV in 48 (4.2%), and adenovirus in 47 (4.2%). Influenza A and B were detected more frequently in HIV-uninfected than in HIV-infected SARI cases (influenza A, 12.0% versus 8.2%; influenza B 6.0% versus 3.1%; Supplemental Table 1 ), whereas the prevalence of other respiratory viruses did not differ by HIV status. A single virus was isolated in 253 (22.5%) patients, whereas 154 (13.7%) individuals had two or more viruses detected. The highest proportion of viral co-detection was observed for bocavirus (21/24, 87 .5%) and enterovirus (27/32; 84 .4%), whereas the lowest proportion was observed in influenza A (26/108; 24.1%). Seasonality of influenza virus and malaria. Among the 163 influenza-positive SARI cases, 61 (37.2%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 47 (28.7%) were influenza A(H3N2), and 59 (30.5%) were influenza B. Three cases had influenza A and B coinfection and one influenza A sample was unsubtyped. Figure 2 illustrates the temporal distribution of influenza types and subtypes, as well as malaria RDT positivity. There were annual cycles of influenza activity, but timing of peak detection varied year to year. In 2011, influenza activity had a bimodal peak-in April and July. In 2012, influenza was detected between March and June only. By contrast, influenza was detected throughout 2013 but peaked in January and February. Peaks in influenza activity coincided with months with high relative humidity, but there was no correlation with rainfall or temperature (Supplemental Figure 1A Of 911 SARI cases with available malaria RDT result, 28 (3.1%) were positive. There was no correlation between influenza and malaria activity ( Figure 2 ). None of the cases with malaria were positive for influenza. Incidence estimates for hospital-attended influenzapositive SARIs. The mean annual incidence of hospital- Factors associated with influenza positivity in SARI patients. Compared with influenza-negative patients, a higher proportion of influenza-positive SARI patients reported headache (90.1 versus 83.6%, OR: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.02-3.13, P = 0.04). No other clinical feature differences by etiology were found (see Supplemental Table 2 ). In the multivariable analysis (Table 2) , female gender was associated with increased odds of influenza positivity compared with male gender (adjusted OR [aOR]: 1.57 (95% CI: 1.10-2.26). Greater influenza activity was observed in the hot, rainy season (17.5%; aOR: 2.82, 95% CI: 1.57-5.06) and the cold, dry season (16.5%; aOR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1. 35-4.15 ), compared with the hot, dry season (6.7%). Furthermore, influenza positivity was inversely associated with HIV infection (aOR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.36-0.76, P < 0.001) and codetection with another respiratory virus (aOR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.31-0.70, P < 0.001). Small numbers prohibited the evaluation of specific viral co-detection combinations with influenza. Factors associated with clinical severity. We found that 238 of 1,126 patients with SARI (21.1%) had clinically severe disease (MEWS > 4). In multivariable analysis ( Table 3 ).
