Virus isolation and identification. Cytopathic BRVs were isolated from fecal samples obtained from calves with diarrhea on both ranches. Presence of BRV was confirmed based on the ultrastructural appearance of the virus particles and positive fluorescence by direct fluorescent antibody staining. SDS-PAGE indicated that strains NS-1 and NS-2 had identical RNA electropherotypes consisting of a 4-2-3-2 RNA migration pattern characteristic of group A rotaviruses (Fig. 1) . Comparison of electropherotypes with reference BRV strains revealed that gene segment 4 of strain NCDV-Lincoln had a lower molecular weight than other BRVs and gene segment 10 of strain B223 moved slower than other BRVs (Fig. 1) . By co-electrophoresis gene segments 2, 3, 4, 7, and 10 of strain NS-1 migrated similarly to strain B641, whereas gene segments 5, 6, and 11 had migration patterns identical to strain B223 (Fig. 2) . In contrast, gene segments 1 and 9 of strain NS-1 migrated differently from either reference strain B641 and B223, and gene segment 8 could not be resolved. Serological characterization offieldBRV. Results of FFN assays of the field and reference BRV strains are summarized in Table 1 . Strain NS-1 was neutralized by the mAb 143/36 and the GPHS raised against BRV strain B641, but not by the mAb B223-N7 or the GPHS raised against BRV strain B223. Northern blot with whole genomic RNA probes. Northern blot studies with whole genomic RNA probes indicated that each virus probe hybridized to all gene segments of its homologous virus (Fig. 3) . Additionally, strain NS-2 hybridized at all gene segments with the NS-1 whole genomic RNA probe. Although, the field and reference strains of BRV had a high degree of homology at gene segments 1,2,3,6,10 and 11, gene segment 4 of strain NS-1 hybridized only with gene segment 4 of strain B641, but not with strains NCDV-Lincoln and B223. Additionally, gene segment 5 of strain NS-1 hybridized with strain B223, but not with strains NCDV-Lincoln and B641. Gene segments 7, 8 and 9 migrated in close proximity, making it impossible to determine their origin. G-type classification offield BRV. The PCR products obtained from BRV strains NS-1, B641, NCDV-Lincoln, and B223 consisted of a cDNA fragment of approximately 340 nucleotides (Fig. 4) . Cross-hybridization experiments using ot-a2p-dCTP labelled G-spe-1234 A B Fig. 5 . Southern blot hybridization between reference and field BRV strains using G-type specific cDNA probes from strains NS-1 (A) and B223 (B). Lanes: 1, NS-I; 2, B641; 3, NCDV-Lincoln; 4, B223. cific cDNA probes showed that the G-specific cDNA probe made from strain NS-1 hybridized with G6 strains B641 and NCDV-Lincoln, but not with G10 strain B223. Conversely, the G10-specific probe made from strain B223 hybridized only to itself, and not to strains NS-1, B641 and NCDV-Lincoln (Fig. 5) .
