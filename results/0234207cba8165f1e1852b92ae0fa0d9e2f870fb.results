Disease spread over a contact network. We develop an individual based game-theoretic model that captures the interests of healthy and sick individuals during an epidemic. Full details appear in the Methods section. At any point in time, the population consists of sick and healthy individuals. Healthy individuals are susceptible to contract the disease in the next time step if in contact with an infected individual. Disease contraction from a sick contact depends on the inherent infectivity of the disease denoted by β. Inherent infectivity level of a disease is reduced by the combined measures taken by the two individuals in contact. Protective measures taken by a healthy individual i, denoted by a i , ranges from 0 -self-isolate-to 1 -resuming normal activity. Similarly, preemptive measures taken by a sick individual j, denoted by a j , ranges from 0 -self-isolate-to 1 -resuming normal activity. Individual i contracts the disease from a sick individual j with probability βa i a j . That is, infection can only occur if neither the healthy nor the sick individual decides to self-isolate, i.e., a i > 0 and a j > 0. The set of contacts of each individual defines a contact network. Accordingly, we refer to the set of contacts of an individual as their neighbors. A healthy individual remains healthy in the next time step if the individual does not contract the disease from any of their sick neighbors. That is, disease transmission from one sick neighbor is enough to infect the individual. A sick individual heals with probability δ and becomes susceptible again. See Fig. 1 for an example of a contact network and one step propagation of the SIS Markov chain model. Individuals determine their actions at each time with respect to whether they are healthy or sick, and the states (healthy or sick) and actions of their neighbors. On the one hand, a healthy individual would like to avoid taking costly protective measures while minimizing their risk of infection. On the other hand, a sick individual would like to avoid taking costly preemptive measures while minimizing the chance of transmitting the disease to their healthy neighbors. We represent the tradeoffs of an individual by a payoff function which is a weighted combination of these preferences (see Equation (9) in the Methods). We represent the cost of measures by a socialization term that an individual maximizes when resuming normal activity. We weight this socialization term by a positive socialization constant c 0 . The risk of infection of a healthy individual, weighted by a positive risk averseness constant c 1 , increases with the number of sick neighbors that do not take any preemptive measures. The concern for disease transmission, weighted by a positive empathy constant c 2 , increases with the number of healthy neighbors who do not take any protective measures. Given the payoffs described above with fixed weight constants, c 0 , c 1 , and c 2 , individuals make decisions based on observations of the current state of the disease. In addition to the state of contact neighbors, a healthy individual's risk of infection or a sick individual's chance of disease transmission, and therefore, individual's payoff, depends on the actions of contact neighbors. For instance, a healthy individual is safe from the disease regardless of their own action if all of their sick neighbors self-isolate. That is, a healthy individual can avoid the disutility of protective measures by resuming normal activity if the individual knows their infected neighbors are taking preemptive measures to avoid disease spread. However, their sick neighbors also would like to avoid the disutility of these preemptive measures. Hence, this is a game amongst healthy and sick individuals of the population. In this game, at each stage individuals have to reason about the actions of their neighbors to make their own decisions. Deriving optimal strategic behavior in a disease network game. The disease dynamics described above and depicted in Fig. 1 are a stochastic game 32 . Given a state of the disease at time t individuals in the population make decisions regarding their payoffs, which then determine the disease contraction probabilities βa i a j of healthy individuals. These transition probabilities along with the state of the disease at time t determine the state of the disease at time t + 1. In general, stochastic games denotes a class of games where the current state determines the payoffs of players, and the actions taken in the current time step affect the probabilistic transition to the state in the following time. A rational model of decision-making in a stochastic game is the Markov perfect equilibrium solution concept [ref. 33, Ch.5.5] . A Markov strategy is where individuals' actions depend only on the payoff relevant state of the disease. In addition, we assume individuals take actions considering their current payoffs only. This equilibrium concept, we term the myopic Markov perfect equilibrium (MMPE), is formally defined in the Methods section. An MMPE strategy profile at time t is such that no individual has a preferable unilateral deviation to another action that strictly increases the individual's current payoff. The assumption of myopic strategies implies that individuals do not weigh their future risks of infection or infecting other individuals in their current decision-making. This is a reasonable assumption considering the computational complexity of accounting for future states of the disease during an epidemic. We exemplify different equilibrium actions that arise from differing payoff constants (c 0 , c 1 and c 2 ) on a n = 4 individual star network given the state of the disease, where the center individual is sick and other individuals are healthy in Fig. 2(a-d) . We observe that in cases (a-c) the equilibrium action is unique. When individuals have strong risk aversion and strong empathy in comparison to the socialization constant in (d), there are two alternative stage equilibria: 1) All healthy individuals resume normal activity and the sick individual self-isolates, and 2) the sick individual resumes normal activity and healthy individuals self-isolate. Both equilibrium strategies yield the same outcome of disease eradication-each individual continues to take the same action until the center individual heals. However, the first equilibrium action profile yields an aggregate utility-sum of individual payoffs-of 3 while the second equilibrium action yields an aggregate utility of 1 yielding a ratio of 1/3. The ratio of the worst aggregate utility value attained by an equilibrium action profile to the optimal action profile that maximizes the aggregate utility is referred to as the price of anarchy in game theory 34 . In Supplementary Section B, we prove a lower bound for the price of anarchy that shows it can scale with 1/n. The set of utility constants in (d) shows that the bound is tight because the price of anarchy equals 1/(n − 1) = 1/3. A disease is eradicated when all individuals are healthy. Starting at the state in Fig. 2 for utility constant values given by (b-d), there is no chance of disease spread at an MMPE strategy profile. Therefore, the disease is eradicated when the center individual heals in continuation of the disease dynamics. However, if constant values are as given by Fig. 2(a) , there is no guarantee that the disease is eradicated when the center individual heals. We show the continuation of the disease dynamics starting from the cases of (a) weak empathy & weak averseness and (b) strong empathy & weak averseness in Fig. 3 . In case (a), the disease takes off after the first time step in the network before eradication at time t = 14. When empathy is strong in (b), disease is eradicated when the center node heals. We also observe that the larger aggregate utility does not always lead to a reduction in disease spread. For instance at time t = 2 in Fig. 3 (bottom) , the aggregate utility is higher in the weak empathy case than in the strong empathy case. At the following time t = 3 the number of infected increases to 3 individuals for the weak empathy case. At time t = 3, the aggregate payoff remains higher than the strong empathy case with single infected individual. That is, a larger epidemic size can lead to a better aggregate utility when the empathy constant is different. In the example given in Fig. 3 , the MMPE strategy profiles for different utility constants lead to qualitatively different outcomes. This means that rational behavior response can eradicate the disease rapidly depending on the sensitivity of individuals to risk of infection and concern for spreading the disease. In the following sections, we explore the effects of these constants on disease spread. Limits of disease spread from a single sick individual. The basic reproduction number R 0 measures the spread of an infectious disease from an initial sick individual in an otherwise susceptible host population. In the homogeneously mixed SIS model, the basic reproduction number is equal to R 0 = βn/δ [ref. 35, Ch. 2] . In this model, the disease becomes endemic if R 0 > 1. In contact network disease models, R 0 > 1 is not necessarily the outbreak threshold. Rather, it is an indicator that the disease is likely to persist when there are relatively low number of infected individuals 13 . Here, we compute an upper bound of the R 0 value for the disease network game to relate the likelihood of disease persistence to network and utility constants. Consider a network with degree distribution P(k) where P(k) denotes the probability that a selected individual has ∈ … − k n {1, 2, , 1} neighbors. We assume the initial infected individual is chosen from the population uniformly at random. When individuals act according to an MMPE strategy profile, we have the following bound on R 0 (Supplementary Section C), When the empathy term nc 2 is smaller than c 0 , i.e., K = n, we recover the bound for contact network models without behavior response. The reasoning is as follows. An initial infected individual will choose to resume normal activity (a i = 1) even given n − 1 susceptible neighbors, and no matter how these neighbors act because of weak empathy. When the empathy term is larger than the socialization constant, i.e., c 2 > c 0 , the initial infected individual will self-isolate (a i = 0) even given a single social neighbor. Therefore, the bound above is most interesting when the empathy term is such that c 0 /n < c 2 < c 0 . In this case, only the infected individuals with connections smaller than ⌊ ⌋ c c / 0 2 can spread the disease to their neighbors initially. The degree distribution P(·) determines the frequency of individuals with number of neighbors less than ⌊ ⌋ c c / 0 2 . We note that all the susceptible individuals will socialize at normal levels initially if c 0 > c 1 . Still, if the disease spreads to their neighbors, their rational actions can include self-isolation. In the derivation of the upper bound, we assume all susceptible neighbors of the initial infected individual resume normal activities. Hence the risk averseness constant c 1 does not appear in the bound above. It is natural to think that high risk aversion may help reduce initial spread. Contrary to this intuition, when we explore the effects of c 1 in the following sections, we find that the risk averseness cannot stop the initial spread without a critical level of the empathy constant. We consider random scale-free networks to illustrate the conjoint effects of network structure and the empathy constant. In a scale-free network degree connectivity distribution follows power law, i.e., P(k) ~ k −γ , where 2 ≤ γ ≤ 3. When γ = 2, we obtain the following upper bound for R 0 using (1) (Supplementary Section D), Figure 2 . MMPE equilibrium strategy actions with respect to utility constants. There are n = 4 individuals forming a star network. In cases (a-c) the stage equilibrium action is unique. In case (d) there two stage equilibria. When risk averseness is weak, i.e., c 0 > c 1 , all healthy individuals take action a i = 1 regardless of the action of the center individual. When empathy is weak, i.e., c 0 > 3c 2 , the sick individual at the center takes action a i = 1 regardless of i's neighbors' actions by the same reasoning. Based on these responses we can solve for stage equilibrium in (a-c). In (a) (c 0 > c 1 and c 0 > 3c 2 ), all individuals take action 1. In (b), because all healthy individuals take action 1 due to weak averseness, the sick individual takes action 0 considering the strong empathy (c 0 < 3c 2 ). In (c), because the sick individual takes action 1 due to weak empathy, all healthy individuals take action 0 considering their strong averseness (c 0 < c 1 ). In (d), if healthy individuals take action 1 then it is in the interest of the strongly empathetic sick individual to take action 0. However, if healthy individuals take action 0 then the sick individual receives a positive payoff from taking action 1. In both cases no individual has an incentive to deviate to another action. Scientific RepoRts | 7:44122 | DOI: 10.1038/srep44122 We observe how network and behavior response comes at play in the bound above. In particular, if the empathy constant is negligible, i.e., c 0 /c 2 > n, then the bound increases logarithmically with the size of the population, i.e., R 0 ≤ β log(n)/δ. This value is the reproduction number for the contact network SIS model with no individual behavior response to disease prevalence [ref. 36, Ch. 17] . We observe the effect of individual behavior on R 0 as the empathy constant c 2 is increased. The power law degree distribution of the scale-free network results in a logarithmic decrease in the bound with respect to increasing empathy constant c 2 . From (2) we have R 0 < 1 for We measure the accuracy of the critical c 2 value above that makes R 0 < 1 by comparing it to simulated R 0 values in Fig. 4 . Figure 4 shows the simulated R 0 values and the upper bound in (2) with respect to the c 2 value on the x-axis for a given β value. We see that for all β values when the upper bound is less than one, the R 0 value obtained from simulation is also less than 1. That is, the disease is not likely to persist when the empathy constant of individuals is above the critical level in (3).
