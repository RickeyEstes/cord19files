Flexible bronchoscopy with BAL was performed on 217 immunocompromised patients between January 2012 to December 2016. One hundred fifty-two patents (70.1%) were male and the mean age was 51.7 ± 14.6 years. Fifty-nine patients ( Fever was the most common presenting symptom (67.3%, 146/217) followed by cough (53.5%, 116/217) and dyspnea (36.4%, 79/217). Median duration of symptoms was 14 days (IQR 8-22.5). Most patients (88.5%, 192/217) received empiric antibiotics prior to bronchoscopy for a median duration of 5 days (IQR 2-10). CT chest scan was obtained in 83.4% (181/217) of patients, with consolidation being the most common finding (66.9%, 121/181) followed by ground glass opacities (51.3%, 93/181). CT scans were performed with a median of 3 days (IQR 2, 5) prior to BAL procedure. Patient characteristics are presented in Table 2 . Median duration of bronchoscopy was 10 min (IQR 10-15) and the following sedation was used: median midazolam 2.50 mg (IQR 2.00-3.50) and fentanyl 50 microgram (IQR 25-50). The median volume of BAL fluid instilled was 120 mL (IQR 100-140) and > 30% of instilled volume was retrieved in 91% of cases (152/167). Overall diagnostic yield for this study was 60.8% (132/ 217). Post-procedure treatment modification based on BAL results was 63.3% (84/132). Majority of positive BAL yielded infectious agents (97.0%, 128/132) with 37 cases of Pneumocystis jirovecii, 13 Mycobacteria tuberculosis and 12 rhinovirus. Cytomegalovirus was found in 16 cases but no inclusion bodies were identified on cytology. Table 3 shows all BAL microbiological results. Galactomannan testing was also positive in 31 cases, with ≥0.5 antigen index considered positive. Non-infectious causes of pulmonary infiltrates was found in 4 cases based on cytology and clinical/radiological presentation: eosinophilic pneumonia, squamous cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma and drug-induced pneumonitis. Differences in characteristics of patients with positive and negative BAL are outlined in Table 4 . In multivariable logistic regression analysis, factors significantly associated with higher diagnostic yield included HIV infection ( Overall complication rate for this study was 14.7% (32/ 217) with 94% (30/32) attributable to self-limiting hypoxemia that required supplemental oxygen therapy temporarily (CTCAE 2). The remaining two cases were of endobronchial bleeding that did not require further endoscopic intervention (CTCAE 1). Both patients were thrombocytopenic with platelet counts of 27,000 per microliter and 126,000 per microliter. No patients required intubation or escalation of care. Post-procedure 30-day and 90-day mortality was 10.6% (23/217) and 17.5% (38/217) respectively. Patients who suffered complications had significantly higher median Charlson comorbidity index (median 5, IQR 3-7) compared to those who did not suffer complications (median 4, IQR 3-6; p = 0.011) [7] . Univariate logistic regression analysis for complication rate found dyspnea during disease presentation to be significantly associated with increased complications (unadjusted OR 2.508, 95% CI 1.169-5.382, p = 0.018). Multivariable logistic regression analysis found no factors significantly associated with complication rate (See supplementary material in Appendix 2). In non-HIV, hematologic malignancy patients diagnostic yield was 51.1% (47/92) and of these 70.2% (33/47) of cases impacted patient management with treatment modification. Isolated pathogens included 8 cases of parainfluenza virus, 5 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 rhinovirus, 4 respiratory syncytial virus, 3 Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 3 Klebsiella species and 3 coronavirus. Complication rate was 10.9% (10/92), while post-procedure 30-day and 90-day mortality was 17.4% (16/92) and 28.3% (26/92) respectively. Mortality rate was significantly higher for non-HIV, hematologic malignancy patients than for HIV and for non-HIV, non-hematologic malignancy groups.
