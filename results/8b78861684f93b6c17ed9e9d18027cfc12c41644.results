We included 25,421 cirrhosis patients and 114,052 reference individuals. Their median age was 57 years and 65% were male. 45 cirrhosis patients and 44 reference individuals underwent total hip arthroplasty for AVN. Diabetes and COPD were the most prevalent confounders, and the majority of confounders were more prevalent in cirrhosis patients than in reference individuals (Table 1) . Cirrhosis patients' adjusted HR for a total hip arthroplasty for AVN was 10 (95% CI: 6-17). Both cirrhosis patients' and reference individuals' 5-year risk of a total hip arthroplasty for AVN was very low, but it was markedly higher in cirrhosis patients: 0.16% (95% CI: 0.12-0.23) vs. 0.02% (95% CI: 0.01-0.03). Cirrhosis patients' HR for a total hip arthroplasty for AVN was essentially unaltered in our supplementary analysis, restricted to patients without alcoholic cirrhosis (Table 2 ).
