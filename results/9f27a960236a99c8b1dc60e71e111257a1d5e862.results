This study included a total of 444 NPC patients and 464 control subjects. The characteristics of study subjects are summarised in Table 1 . The mean age (± standard deviation) of the patients was 41.7 ± 9.6 y and 61.0% of the cases were male. For controls, the age was 41.3 ± 10.6 y and 60.1% of subjects were male. There was no statistically significant difference between cases and controls with respect to the frequency distributions of age and the sex distribution was unbiased (all P-values > 0.05). There was significant association between the level of education and NPC susceptibility. In current study, 21.7% of the case patients versus 8.0% of control subjects were illiterate or had an education of primary school (P < 0.001). Direct sequencing of the promoter region of DC-SIGN revealed the occurrence of six variants: -939 G/A, -871 A/G, -336 A/G, -190 A/G, -139 A/G and -116 G/T. Table 2 presents detailed information on these six variants. The minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of all SNPs evaluated in the DC-SIGN promoter were >0.05 except for -190 A/G (MAF = 0.003) and -116 G/T (MAF = 0.006), and all loci fit Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations (P-values > 0.05). Table 3 presents the genotypic and allelic frequencies of these six variants among Cantonese population. For DC-SIGN -139 A/G, subjects carrying mutant genotype -139 AG, which means a SNP -139 A/G in heterozygous alleles and -139 GG, which means a SNP -139 A/G in both G alleles, had 1.42-fold (95% CI = 1.07-1.86) and 1.99-fold (95% CI = 1.20-3.30) increased risks of developing NPC, respectively, when compared with those carrying wild genotype -139 AA. After adjusting for age, sex and the level of education, genotype -139 AG and -139 GG had 1.41-fold (95% CI = 1.05-1.88) and 2.10fold (95% CI = 1.23-3.59) increased risks of developing NPC, respectively, when compared with those carrying wild genotype -139 AA (P trend = 0.005). Furthermore, subjects carrying the risk allele -139 G had 1.42-fold (95% CI = 1.15-1.74) increased risks of developing NPC when compared with those carrying allele -139 A (P = 0.001). In addition, subjects possessing mutant genotype -871 AG and GG had higher risks of developing NPC (OR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.06-1.93 and OR = 2.34; 95% CI = 0.99-5.54, respectively) when compared with those carrying wild genotype -871 AA and those carrying the risk allele -871 G had 1.47-fold (95% CI = 1.14-1.90) increased risks of developing NPC when compared with those carrying allele -871 A (P = 0.003). After adjusting for age, sex and the level of education, there was no significant association between -871 GG genotype and NPC susceptibility (P = 0.14), which maybe mainly due to the small sample size. However, the association between -871 AG genotype and NPC susceptibility was still significant (P = 0.03). For DC-SIGN -939 G/A, subjects carrying mutant genotype -939 AA had a 2.56-fold increased risk of developing NPC (OR = 2.56; 95% CI = 1.36-4.83; P = 0.003) compared to those carrying wildtype genotype -939 GG and the association is still significant after adjusting for age, sex and the level of education (OR = 2.52; 95% CI = 1.29-4.93; P = 0.007). Furthermore, the association between the risk allele -939 A and NPC susceptibility was statistically significant (OR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.15-1.79; P = 0.002). However, for the other three SNPs, there were no significant differences between cases and controls. For power calculation, the powers for all of the three significant SNPs, DC-SIGN-139, -871 and -939, were 0.92, 0.87 and 0.90, respectively. Moreover, we performed the analyses at the haplotype level and found that there was significant linkage disequilibrium among DC-SIGN -139 A/G, -336 A/G, -871 A/G and -939 G/A, and a block was constructed by these four SNPs (Figure 1 ). Table 4 shows the results of haplotype analysis and reveals that h1 'AAAG', representing wild-type for all four common SNPs (-139 A, -336 A, -871 A and -939 G) and accounting for 68.4% of all haplotypes, was associated with protection against NPC (OR = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.57-0.84; P = 2.0 × 10 -4 ). Further, using 1000 permutation test runs, we also detected a significant association (P = 0.001) between this haplotype and NPC phenotype. In addition, h2 'GAGA', which accounts for 14.1% of all haplotypes, was associated with NPC risk (OR = 1.34; 95% CI = 1.03-
