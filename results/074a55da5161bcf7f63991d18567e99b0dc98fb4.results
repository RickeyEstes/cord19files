We enrolled 80 participants of 154 screened in VRC 319, from Aug 2, 2016, to Sept 29, 2016 , and 45 of 105 in VRC 320, from Dec 12, 2016, to April 19, 2017 (figure 1). One participant from VRC 319 and two from VRC 320 withdrew after one dose of vaccine due to time commitments, precluding further trial participation, but were included in the safety analyses. Follow-up continues, and is expected to close in August, 2018, for VRC 319 and in February, 2019, for VRC 320. In VRC 319, the groups varied by sex and race, but age, body-mass index, and ethnicity were similar, whereas in VRC 320, only race varied notably (table 1) . Vaccinations were safe and well tolerated in both trials, with local and systemic reactogenic events for VRC5288 and VRC5283 being mild to moderate (appendix). In both studies, pain and tenderness at the injection site was the most frequent local event ( , respectively, in VRC 320; table 2) One serious adverse event was reported, which was appendicitis 8 months after vaccination with VRC5288, but was deemed not to be related to vaccination. The GMTs after vaccination with VRC5288 in VRC 319 were greater after three doses of vaccine than after two doses (table 3, appendix). Positive antibody responses ranged from 60% to 89% 4 weeks after final vaccination (figure 2). The highest GMT and the greatest antibody response and antibody titres were seen in group 4 participants after three doses of vaccine with an extended time between the second and third doses (table 3) . After the third dose, the GMT was boosted to greater than the GMTs after the second dose in both three-dose groups (p=0·0048 for group 3 and p<0·0001 for group 4, figure 3 ). The GMT achieved with VRC5283 in VRC 320 was substantially higher with needle-free injection in group 3 than with needle and syringe administration in groups 1 and 2 (table 3) . Positive antibody response increased from single-dose needle and syringe administration (77%) to split-dose needle and syringe administration (93%) to split-dose needle-free syringe administration (100%; figure 2 ). The GMT of 304 in VRC 320 group 3 was the greatest across all groups in both studies (p<0·0001 vs groups 1-3 and p=0·0028 vs group 4 in VRC 319; p=0·0015 Figure 2 : Neutralising activity 4 weeks after last vaccination, measured by reporter virus particle assay In the VRC 319 study, samples were collected in week 12 for groups 1 and 3, week 16 for group 2, and week 24 for group 4. In the VRC 320 study, all samples were collected at week 12. Data are geometric mean titres and SDs derived from two to four independent assays per sample. The dotted line represents the limit of detection of the assay (dilution 1:30). Negative samples were reported as half the limit of detection (dilution 1:15).

Split-dose administration of vaccine with needle and syringe also improved GMT compared with single-dose administration via the same method (appendix). In the two groups receiving VRC5283 by needle and syringe, the antibody levels were higher after splitting the dose (p=0·0015 for group 2). Boosting with the third dose only significantly increased the GMT to greater than that after the second dose in group 1 (p=0·0016). EC 80 results are shown in the appendix. 4 weeks after last vaccination with VRC5288 in VRC 319, in group 4, T-cell responses to pooled peptides were significantly increased (CD4 p=0·0108 and CD8 cells p=0·0039) compared with baseline (table 3, figure 4) . Group 3 showed increased CD8 (p=0·0304) responses to pooled peptides. The greatest T-cell responses overall were seen 4 weeks after needle-free administration of VRC5283 in VRC 320 (table 3, figure 4 ). CD8 cell counts in participants who received VRC5283 via needle-free injection had increased total cytokine responses compared with baseline for pooled peptides (p=0·0166) and specifically for E-protein peptides (p=0·0004, appendix). CD4 cell counts from this group were also increased with pooled peptides (p=0·0004), again specifically for E-protein peptides (p=0·0001, appendix). VRC5283 given in split doses via needle and syringe also produced a significant CD4 response to pooled peptides (p=0·0353), but not a significant CD8 response. There were no significant responses to small envelope protein M or pr peptide.
