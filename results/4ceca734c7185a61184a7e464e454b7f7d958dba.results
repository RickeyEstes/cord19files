Fifty-five children, representing 74% of the radiological severe pneumonias and 26% of all clinical severe pneumonia cases identified in the study period, underwent lung aspiration (n = 47) or pleural fluid aspiration (n = 9); 1 participant underwent 2 aspirates at different time points (Supplementary Appendix 4). HIV testing was done in 33 of 55 (60%) participants, 2 of whom were positive for HIV type 1. The characteristics of those who underwent lung or pleural aspiration were similar to the radiological pneumonia group from which they were drawn (Supplementary Appendix 5). Pathogens were identified to genus or species level in 53 of 56 (95%) samples by 1 or more laboratory methods (Table 1 ). An organism was cultured from 21 of 56 (38%) specimens: S. pneumoniae in 14 (25%), H. influenzae (all non-type b on latex agglutination) in 3 (5%), and Staphylococcus aureus in 3 (5%). Ziehl-Neelsen staining was done in 37 of 56 (66%) lung aspirate samples (all negative); 35 of 37 (95%) underwent culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and all were negative. Streptococcus pneumoniae was detected by 1 or more molecular assays (Supplementary Appendix 6) in 48 of 53 (91%) samples and in 2 or more assays in 36 of 53 (68%) samples. Molecular pneumococcal serotyping (40 serotypes; Supplementary Appendix 7) showed the following prevalences: serotype 1, 22%; serotype 4, 18%; serotype 14, 18%; serotype 5, 16%; serotype 6A/B/C, 4%; and serotype 9V/A, 2%. Ten-and 13-valent PCVs both include serotypes that account for 76%-80% of serotypes identified in the samples in this study. Haemophilus influenzae was detected in 12 of 53 (23%) samples. Four of the 12 had sufficient deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for full MLST typing, 3 being nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHi), whereas 1 in a child with HIV infection had a serotype b infection. Two of the 12 had sufficient loads for 5 or 6 of the standard 7 alleles of MLST to be defined, and these were suggestive of NTHi, 1 being in a culture-positive case confirmed as being non-type b by latex agglutination assay. Staphylococcus aureus was detected in 3 of 53 (6%) samples, all of which were pleural fluid specimens. One or more other bacteria were identified to genus or species level in 8 of 53 (15%) samples. Viruses, led by respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and bocavirus, were detected by 1 or more methods in 10 of 53 (19%) samples. Half (28/53 [53%]) of samples had >1 organism detected to genus or species level, predominantly 2 or more bacterial species. Codetection of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae occurred in 11 of 53 (21%) samples, H. influenzae having the higher bacterial load in 4 of 11 samples. In the 3 specimens positive for S. aureus, low loads of S. pneumoniae were detected in 2 and of H. influenzae in the other.
