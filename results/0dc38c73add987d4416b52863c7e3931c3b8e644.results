Acute phase. Eight infected pigs were studied during the acute phase of the disease; they were compared with 10 matched-fed litter mates. Mean weight of all pigs at the start of the experiment was 4.78 â€¢ 0.86 Kg. After 42 hours the infected pigs had lost 20 per cent of their body weight; weight of control pigs remained unchanged (Table I) stools contained no measurable reducing substances. Except for a decrease in calcium, serum electrolytes were unchanged in the infected pigs. Serum sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, total protein, and protein patterns remained the same (Table III) . However, pH fell from 7.36 to 7.30, and carbon dioxide tension and bicarbonate were significantly lowered in the infected group. Infected pigs did not differ from control pigs with respect to villous dimensions, epithelial cell structure, or round cell infiltration. There was no difference between groups with respect to weight of mucosa or mucosal protein content per 20 cm. segment. Results of enzyme determinations of mucosal homogenates from small and large intestine are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 . The only difference in Na-K-ATPase activity was in the proximal jejunum where it was decreased in infected pigs. In this area Mg-ATPase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactase were also decreased. In the mid jejunum, Iactase, sucrase, and alkaline phosphatase were decreased. In the ileum, lactase and sucrase were decreased. In none of these enzymes was the activity changed in the proximal or distal colon. Convalescent phase. Ten infected piglets were compared to five icontrol piglets one week after inoculation. Specific enzyme ac- tivities were determined at those intestinal sites where enzyme activities had been lowered in infected piglets in the acute phase, and except for decreased Na-K-ATPase activity in the proximal jejunum (Fig. 3) found they were not different from the same activities in control piglets. By chance, there were no male plgs in the infected group so stools could not be collected for analysis. The infected pigs weighed 97 per cent of their original weight which was not statistically different from the control pigs who weighed 104 per cent, suggesting that rehydration had taken place. Recovered phase. Six recovered pigs were compared to three control pigs two weeks post inoculation. No significant differences in intestinal enzyme activities or in serum pH, electrolytes, and protein existed between the two groups. Stool weights, fat, and electrolytes obtained on three male piglets and three control piglets were similar.
