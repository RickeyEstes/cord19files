The mean IPSS and mean age for the 923 males was 13.45±8.24 and 75.03±6.20 years, respectively. The mean OABSS and mean age for the 1.563 females was 4.41±3.10 and 73.74±6.03 years, respectively (Table-1 ). Daily average temperature ranged from-3.4 o C to 28.3 o C, with the daily temperature difference ranging from 2.2 o C to 16.9o C (Table-2) . One-way ANOVA analysis was conducted to determine the age-related risk of BPH, OAB, and QoL. The risk of BPH significantly increased with age (12.65±7.96 for those aged 60-69 years and 15.21±8.86 for those over 80 years; P=0.002). The risk of OAB significantly increased with age (3.93±2.82 and 4.90±3.467 for the respective age groups; P<0.001). The risk of QoL increased significantly with age (2.83±1.75 and 3.21±1.53 for the respective age groups; P=0.001) ( Table-3 ). To evaluate the influence of topographical characteristics, there was no difference of IPSS, QoL, and OABSS between coastal and inland area (Table-4 ). And also there was no statistical significance for identifying which individual item of IPSS and OABSS was related to the daily average temperature except for QoL item (Table-5 ). Figure-3 displays values with 95% confidence intervals after adjustment of age concerning the relationship between temperature factors and IPSS/OABSS. There was a weak negative correlation between IPSS and daily temperature difference. To examine this correlation in more detail, a multiple linear
