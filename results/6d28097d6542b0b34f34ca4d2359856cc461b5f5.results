Nasal/throat swabs were collected for 88.8% (556/626) moderateto-severe ILI episodes reported during the first surveillance year of the INFLUENCE65 study ( Figure 1 ). ILI episodes and swab collection peaked in January 2009 (Supplementary Figure 1 ). The ISS questionnaire was completed by approximately 70% of subjects reporting any ILI episode (81%, 47/58 of moderate-to-severe ILI episodes with missing ISS scores were hospitalized). We tested samples from 553 subjects with 556 episodes of moderate-to-severe ILI: 64 (11.7%) were hospitalized episodes and 28 (5.0%) were pneumonia cases. Of 490 (94.0%) episodes with a maximum ISS score >2, 480 (86.3%) were nonhospitalized, nonpneumonia cases, including 9 with unknown hospitalization status ( Figure 1 ). No deaths occurred in association with the 556 moderate-to-severe ILI episodes included in the analysis. The study population was representative of the INFLUENCE65 cohort [11] . There were more women than men, and the mean age of subjects was 72.8 years (standard deviation 5.5 years, Figure 1 . Flow diagram. Table 1 ). Most subjects were white (88.6%), most lived independently (91.7%), 6.0% were in active employment, and 9.6% were current smokers. The most common preexisting medical conditions were hypertension (65.7% of subjects), other cardiopulmonary diseases (52.5%), noninflammatory cerebrovascular/ neurological disorders (30.9%), coronary artery disease (28.6%), and autoimmune/inflammatory disease (24.2%).
