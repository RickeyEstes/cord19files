Morphological changes of the cultured pulmonary epithelial cells after exposure to the recombinant HA of AIV H5N1 The cultured human pulmonary epithelial A549 cells were challenged with recombinant HA at 40 mg/ml. After 12 h of stimulation, the cells became swollen, rounded and irregular in size and shape with the appearance of intracellular vacuoles (Figure 1Bb ) whereas the control cells did not (Figure 1Ba ).
