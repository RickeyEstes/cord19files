Nucleolin redistributes with IAV ribonucleoprotein complexes to the nuclear periphery of infected cells. Considering the strongly altered host nucleolar ultrastructure and composition during IAV infection, we analyzed the subcellular localization of three major constitutive nucleolar proteins, nucleolin, B23 and fibrillarin, during the time course of influenza infection. We used immuno-fluorescence confocal microscopy in human lung epithelial A549 cells, mock-infected or infected by influenza A/Moscow/10/99 (H3N2) virus, at 7 and 10 hours post infection (hpi). In addition to nucleolin, B23 or fibrillarin immunostaining, we also used NP as an indicator of viral cycle advancement, as previously carried out 3, [17] [18] [19] [20] . As expected in mock-infected cells, the three nucleolar proteins mainly localized in nucleoli (Fig. 1 , panels a to h and Supplementary Figure 1B,C) . During infection, localization patterns of B23 and fibrillarin remained unmodified up to 7 hpi (data not shown) compared to mock-infected cells, as previously reported 7, 27 . In contrast, when NS1 is notably accumulated within nucleolus at this time (Supplementary Figure 1A) , nucleolin no longer preferentially localized in the subnuclear compartment and instead displayed a broad relocalization throughout the nucleus (Fig. 1 , panels i to p; and Supplementary Figure 1A ), in accordance with previous study 28 . Later in infection (10 hpi), as illustrated by the mainly cytoplasmic localization of NP, nucleolin mostly redistributed at the nuclear periphery of more than 95% of the infected cells (Fig. 1 , panels q to x). At this time most of the fibrillarin accumulated in a large nuclear spot (Supplementary Figure 1B) , probably linked to the ultrastructural remodeling of the nucleolar compartment 3,17-20 , whereas B23 remained associated (Supplementary Figure 1C) . Altogether, these results reveal the differential modification of the subnuclear localization of the three abundant constitutive nucleolar proteins by H3N2 infection, and suggest a specific, earlier and dynamic redistribution of nucleolin during the time course of infection. We then investigated the impact of infection on nucleolin localization by a different human (H1N1 pdm2009) and several avian (H5N1, H5N2 and H7N7) IAV strains. Despite their specific host-range restriction 56 , all viruses efficiently infected A549 cells with comparable kinetics, as we previously reported 3, 17 . We performed immunolabeling at 24 hpi, a time corresponding to late stage of infection for all these viruses (Supplementary Figure 2A) . As observed for H3N2, each infection led to a similar redistribution of endogenous nucleolin towards the nuclear periphery of infected cells (Supplementary Figure 2A) . Interestingly, the observed subnuclear localization pattern of nucleolin in IAV infected cells clearly evoked the previously described polarized distribution of trafficking vRNPs that formed a cap at the apex of the nuclear envelope prior to their export towards the cytoplasm 57,58 . To Immunofluorescence staining of nucleolin (green) and B23 (red) in mock-infected cells (panels a to h) or NP (red) in A549 cells infected with H3N2 virus at a MOI of 1 (panels i to x) was performed at different times, as indicated. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue, panels c,g,k,o,s,w). Merged fluorescent signals are presented in panels d,h,i,p,t and x. Cell details are enlarged (inset). Scale bar = 10 Î¼ m. note, similar NP-nucleolin colocalization and subnuclear localization patterns were also observed using another specific monoclonal antibody raised against NP (MAb 3/1, kind gift of Dr Webster) that was reported to recognize IAV vRNP complexes 59 (Supplementary Figure 2B) . To further investigate these correlated observations, we studied the localization of endogenous nucleolin by 3D reconstruction of confocal images. Our observations confirmed an asymmetric localization pattern of endogenous nucleolin within H3N2 infected cells (10 hpi) (Fig. 2) . Single optical sections through the nucleus (Fig. 2 , panels A1 to A3) and Z-axis reconstruction revealed a polarized co-localization of nucleolin with NP towards the nuclear apex, as revealed by the asymmetric merged fluorescence staining in the z1-z2-axis plane (Fig. 2) . Altogether, these results suggest a putative involvement of nucleolin in the nuclear trafficking of vRNPs during IAV infection.
