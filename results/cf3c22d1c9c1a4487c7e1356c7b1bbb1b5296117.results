Selection of SARS-CoV ORF6-interacting host facts using phage display library SARS-CoV ORF6, cloned into the pTriEx-4 vector, was synthesized as a 17.5-kDa fusion protein with an N-terminal His-Tag in E. coli that was purified using immobilized-metal affinity chromatography (Figure 1 ). The recombinant ORF6 protein was used for the selection of its interacting cellular factors with phage-displayed human lung cDNA library. After the fifth round of biopanning, ORF6-specific binding phage clones eluted were selected from single phage plaques, amplified in E. coli for determining relative ORF6-binding affinities. Each phage clone was performed by direct binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay inORF6coated wells (Figure 2 ). Phage clone numbers 16, 26, and 40 with higher binding affinity to ORF6 were quantitated using plaque assays (p < 0.01), and we subsequently measured the binding specificity ( Figure 3 ). Phage clones numbers. dose-dependent manner. Among the three phage clones, clone number 40 at a titer of 10 7 phages showed the highest affinity to ORF6 protein (p < 0.001). ORF6-interacting protein-encoding sequences fused in-frame with protein III gene of phage clone numbers 16, 26, and 40 were sequenced. A BLAST alignment search of the nucleotide sequences indicated that ORF6-interacting protein display phage clone numbers 16, 26, and 40 were identified as CCNL1 (cyclin L1), RBMXL2 (RNA binding motif protein, Xlinked-like 2), and NPIPB3 (nuclear pore complex interacting protein family, member B3), respectively. Because NPIPB3 displayed on phage clone 40 had the highest binding affinity to ORF6 protein (Figure 3 ), the interaction between ORF6 and NPIPB3 was further evaluated.
