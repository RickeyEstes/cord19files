The Golgi Complex Remains Morphologically Intact in PtKI Cells Exposed to BFA Several markers were used to examine the morphological response of the PtK~ Golgi complex to various concentrations of BFA. CV-1 cells, which display a rapid and complete sensitivity to BFA, were used as a positive control for these experiments. Fig. 1 presents micrographs of PtK1 and CV-1 cells that were cultured in the presence or absence of BFA, and labeled for immunofluorescence with mAbs directed against two proteins associated with the Golgi apparatus. One of these is a 58 kD, cytoplasmicaUy oriented, peripheral membrane component of the Golgi apparatus. This protein, known as "58K" binds directly to microtubules and has been proposed to be involved in anchoring the Golgi apparatus to microtubules in vivo (Bloom and Brashear, 1989) . The other protein, a ll0-kD species (Alan and Kreis, 1986), was recently shown to dissociate from the Golgi apparatus in cultured cells within 30 s of BFA exposure (Donaldson et al., 1990) , and to bear significant homology to the clathrinassociated protein, 5-adaptin (Duden et al., 1991) . Now called "/3-COP" this 110-kD protein is a major subunit of the nonclathrin coat which envelopes intra-Golgi transport vesicles (Duden et al., 1991; Serafini et al., 1991) . In the absence of BFA, the Golgi apparatus was clearly labeled in both PtK~ and CV-1 cells with anti-/~-COP and anti-58K ( Fig. 1 , A, C, E, and G). Faint, diffuse cytoplasmic staining was also evident occasionally with both antibodies, and probably represented soluble pools of 58K and/~-COP. After CV-1 cells were exposed for 30 min to 1.8/~M (0.5 /zg/ml) BFA, the localization of/~-COP and 58K was altered, as both proteins appeared to be dispersely distributed throughout the cytoplasm (B and D). Recent evidence suggests that BFA exerts distinct effects on these two proteins, causing a redistribution of 58K into the ER and solubilization of/~-COP (Donaldson et al., 1990) . Neither of these effects were observed in BFA-treated PtK~ cells. The Golgi apparatus in this cell line was prominently labeled by both anti-58K and anti-/3-COP after BFA incubations as extreme as 71 /~M (20 #g/ml) for 3 h (F and H) or 178 mM (50/~g/ml) for 1 h (not shown). To determine whether the redistribution of 58K and E-COP that was induced in CV-1 cells by BFA was also accompanied by dispersal of nonproteinaceous components of the Golgi complex, living cells were stained with C6-NBD-ceramide. This fluorescent sphingolipid is initially incorporated in the plasma membrane, mitochondria and ER, after which fluorescent metabolites of the compound accumulate predominantly in trans-Golgi stacks (Lipsky and Pagano, 1985; Pagano et al., 1989) . PtK~ or CV-1 cells that had been la- beled with C6-NBD-ceramide were incubated for 30 min in the presence or absence of 36 #M (10/zg/ml) BFA. Then, the unfixed cells were examined and photographed using a light microscope and epifluorescence illumination. The resuits obtained using this approach were comparable to those acquired by immunofluorescence: the CV-1 Golgi complex nearly disappeared when BFA was present, whereas staining of the PtK~ Golgi complex remained unaffected by the drug (Fig. 2) .
