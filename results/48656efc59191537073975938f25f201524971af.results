Of the 61 patients with 2019-nCoV infection included in this study, 44 were diagnosed as mild (mild group) and 17 as moderate or severe (severe group) on admission. The median age of the two groups was statistically different, the mild group was 41 years old and the severe group was 56 years old. None of the 61 patients had a history of Huanan seafood market exposure in Wuhan, 17 of them (27.9%) had not left Beijing recently, but had a close exposure history with 2019-nCoV pneumonia patients, and the other 44 (72.1%) patients were Wuhan citizens or visited Wuhan recently. There was no significant difference of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease between the two groups, but the patients with hypertension in the severe group were more than those in the mild group (p = 0.056) ( Table 1) . Among 61 cases, 60 (98.4%) cases had fever, 5 (8.2%) cases had high fever ( > 39 ℃), 3 (4.9%) cases had dyspnea. 7 (11.5%) cases had mild shortness of breath. Most of the patients in the severe group had cough, sputum production, and fatigue. 11 (18.0%) cases had gastrointestinal symptoms. Blood neutrophil count in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the mild group, blood lymphocyte count, serum sodium and chlorine levels were significantly lower, and the rate of bacterial infection was significantly increased (Table 1 ). the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is The median days from illness onset to admission were 4 days in both groups. All patients were isolated after admission, 34 (55.7%) patients received antiviral treatment, of which 8 patients received oseltamivir (75 mg every 12 h, orally), 26 patients received lopinavir and ritonavir tablets (200 mg twice daily, orally). Nearly half of the patients received antibiotic therapy (42.6%), and 84.2% of the patients in the severe group received antibiotic therapy. One patient was received methylprednisolone for 3 days before admission and stopped after admission, and another patient took methylprednisolone 8 mg every other day for ten months for optic neuromyelitis and continued taking it after admission. Most of the patients in the severe group received oxygen support and nebulization inhalation therapy, of which 3 patients received noninvasive ventilation and 2 received invasive mechanical ventilation. Nebulization inhalation drugs included recombinant human interferon α2b and acetylcysteine. By the end of Jan 31, no patients died, 3 patients were discharged, and the remaining patients were in hospital, of which 8 patients progressed to severe illness and still in the ICU (Table 1 ).
