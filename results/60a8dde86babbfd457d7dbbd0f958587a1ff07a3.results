Health status of the cats in the cattery, haematology, antibody titres and FCoV excretion Cats from group 1 never showed clinical signs or haematological abnormalities attributable to FIP or to any other infectious disease during the sampling period. Nevertheless, 12 days after sampling 3 and 30 days after sampling 5, two episodes of FIP occurred in the cattery where they were living. Specifically, these episodes lead to the death of two kittens and one cat, respectively. Antibody titres and the amount of faecal excretion of FCoVs were also variable among the different cats and samplings (Table 3) . No statistically significant correlations between antibody titres and haematological parameters were found. Post-mortem examinations revealed that cat E was affected by a dry form of FIP, with severe neurological and renal lesions, while cats F and G had the typical abdominal effusive form. Haemograms revealed that cats with FIP were anaemic and had lymphocytosis (cat E) or lymphopenia (cats F and G). Antibody titres of cats with FIP were 1:800, 1:400 and 1:200, respectively. The healthy non-FCoV infected SPF cats showed no clinical signs or haematological change when sampled and they had no circulating anti-FCoV antibodies or FCoVs in faeces.
