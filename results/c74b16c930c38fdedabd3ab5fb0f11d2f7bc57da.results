Since only pneumonic patients who were suspected of having influenza A/H1N1 were hospitalized during the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 season in 2009 and 2010, we only included 21 adult patients with severe influenza A/H1N1 virus infection in the analysis, but no mildly or moderately ill patients were available for analysis. Of them, 9 were male and 12 were female. The average age was 38.4 years old (17-81 years). All 21 patients were confirmed to have pneumonia by computerized tomography (CT) or X-ray chest radiograph. The general characteristics and dynamic changes of white blood cell counts during the clinical course are presented in Table 1 . All patients had pneumonia, with 17 (81.0%) in both lungs and only 4 (19.0%) other in either of left or right lung. Of the 21 patients, 19 (90.5%) showed normal or relatively lower white blood cell counts, and two other patients were confirmed to be co-infected with bacteria, patient no. 1 with Staphylococcus aureus and patient no. 12 with methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Of all 21 participants, 20 recovered after antiviral therapy (oseltamivir) and systemic supportive treatments, and patient no. 12 died on day 46 after the illness onset because of complicated multiple organ failures. Table 1 shows that, of the 21 patients with severe influenza A/H1N1 virus infection, 17 (81.0%) showed reduced proportion of lymphocytes (defined by lymphocytes <20% of total white blood cells) and absolute lymphopenia (defined by lymphocytes <0.8 × 10 9 /L), with the lowest absolute lymphocyte count of 0.1 × 10 9 /L. Of the four other patients (patient 5, 11, 20, and 21) who did not present lymphopenia, patient no. 21 was admitted on day 21 after the illness onset; the possibility of lymphopenia occurred in the early stage of the illness in this patient could not be excluded. Of the 17 patients with marked lymphopenia, 16 had at least two lymphocyte counts. Table 1 shows that the lymphocyte counts were gradually increasing as the patients' conditions were improved, and most patients had normal lymphocyte counts within 2-3 weeks after the illness onset, demonstrating the agreement of normalization of lymphocyte counts and the improvement of the illness. Fig. 1a shows the chest X-ray radiograph on the 4th day after the onset in patient no. 6, who had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for more than 20 years (Table 1) . Confluent alveolar opacities in both lungs were easily noted, particularly in the left lung. The patient had severe respiratory failure and the peripheral lymphocyte count was only 0.3 × 10 9 /L ( Table 1) . After comprehensive treatment, the patient recovered. Fig. 1b shows the chest X-ray radiograph on the 17th day after the onset; the peripheral lymphocyte count had increased to 1.32 × 10 9 /L (Table 1) . Additionally, we performed the cytological examination of pleural fluid in a patient (patient 14, Table 1 ) who developed hydrothorax. While his peripheral lymphocyte count was only 0.30 × 10 9 /L, lymphocytes were accounted for vast majority (78.2%) of the cells in his pleural fluid.
