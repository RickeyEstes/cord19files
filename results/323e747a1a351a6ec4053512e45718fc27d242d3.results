Using the analysis of a linear regression model based on pre-SARS observations, Table 3 summarizes the univariate statistics of predicted errors of monthly county mortality rates. We applied the standard error of an individual predicted value to obtain standardized predicted errors. The mean of standardized predicted errors of 22 counties during the SARS epidemic period (i.e., May-August 2003) is -0.10 (95% confidence interval: -0.34-0.14), which indicates that the predicted values are insignificantly different from the observed values during the SARS period. This result demonstrates that, despite an increased use of local community hospitals, neonatal mortality during the SARS epidemic was lower, even though the difference was insignificant. We formed a sub-sample containing 12 counties where there were hospitals with more than 1,000 beds. The impact of shifting services would be greater in these areas because switching from one hospital level to another tends to occur more often there. The sub-sample presents a significantly negative mean of standardized predicted errors, (-0.42, CI (-0.74 --0.11)) during the SARS period. This evidence indicates that the neonatal mortality rate in areas with large hospitals was significantly lower than predicted, despite the shift of childbirth services to local community hospitals during the SARS epidemic. With the aggregation of the county data from Year 1998 to Year 2002, we recalculated total neonatal mortality rates of the pooled data and estimated a linear regression model with "month" and "trend" variables. Table 4 presents the observed monthly mortality rates and predicted mortality rates of Year 2003, which provides the comparison of the predicted errors of four months before the SAS, of the SARS period and of four months after the SARS period. Similar to the results of monthly county mortality rates, the analysis of the aggregated data shows negative predicated errors during the SARS period of May 2003-August 2003. The aggregated data of counties with large hospitals demonstrates a significant predicted error in July 2003, which indicates that in counties with advanced hospitals of more than 1,000 beds, neonatal mortality was significantly reduced in July 2003, despite an increased use of childbirth services in local community hospitals.
