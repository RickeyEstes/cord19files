The total number of respondents was 173, consisting of 27 specialists (16%), 22 EIS officers (13%), 82 KCDC employees (47%), and 42 local municipal health department officials. There were more females (n = 96, 56%) than males (n = 77, 44%) among the respondents, while < 39 years old was the most common age group (n = 99, 57%) followed by 40-49 years (n = 46, 27%) and ≥ 50 years (n = 28, 16%). With respect to education level, bachelor's degree was the most common response (n = 59, 34%) followed by mas-tious diseases. Subsequent to the MERS epidemic, amendments to the regulations regarding prevention and management of infectious diseases established the legal basis for assigning 30 government EIS officers in the Ministry of Health and Welfare and 36 officers in local municipal, including city and provincial, government agencies, and, as such, a fundamental transformation is needed from the perspective of selecting and nurturing human resources to strengthen the epidemiological investigation competency of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). EIS officers play a central role in the Korean epidemic defense system against various infectious diseases, and, from its initial pilot program in 1999 to 2015, most EIS officers have comprised public health physicians who have completed the basic training for becoming an EIS officer to serve their military duty as a medical officer. However, because of the nature of public health physicians, it was difficult to select physicians who specialized in infectious diseases, and EIS officers could function in that capacity for a limited time of only 2 years or so after training and assignment. After working in that capacity, most public health physicians who served as EIS officers went to work in their own field of specialty and the private sector, unrelated to public health, as soon as they were relieved of their duties as EIS officers. These physicians were assigned to EIS officer position for their 3 years mandatory military service. Therefore, the existing EIS officer system showed organizational issues such as failure in both accumulation of human resources with experience and strengthening of the competency to respond against infectious diseases based on such experience. A lack of EIS officers with specialized expertise was pointed out as one of the causes of the 2015 MERS epidemic, and, as a result, a decision was made to add a significant number of EIS officers as an important part of improving the national epidemic defense system. Consequently, the legal basis was established for assigning 30 government EIS officers in the KCDC and 36 local health department officials [2] . With the change of the existing system of EIS officers from being based on public health physicians to comprising professional government employees, the need for fundamental transformation of EIS officer training to strengthen the epidemiological investigation competency has been heightened from the perspective of selecting and nurturing human resources. In keeping with the change in those who will participate as EIS officers, a revision of the direction of education training courses for EIS officers is urgently required [3] . Accordingly, there is a need to establish base data on systematic improvement in nurturing epidemiological investigation specialists among infectious disease response staff at central (KCDC) and local municipal government levels. At the same time, there is also a need for curriculum reform and content development to strengthen the epidemiological investigation competency in KCDC staff and to address the change in those who will participate as EIS officers. Accordingly, the present study aimed to conduct a questionnaire survey on these topics, analyze the results, and introduce a summary of such findings. Moreover, the study also aimed to ex- (7) EIS, Epidemic Intelligence Service; KCDC, Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ter's (n = 57, 33%) and doctorate (n = 57, 33%) degrees. With respect to affiliation, the responses appeared in the order of KCDC (n = 89, 51%), metropolitan city/provincial government (n = 55, 32%), university (n = 23, 13%), hospital (n = 4, 2%), and Incheon International Airport Quarantine Station (n = 2, 1%). Work period of less than 9 years (n = 105, 61%) was the most common response followed by 20-29 years (n = 30, 17%), 10-19 years (n = 30, 17%), and ≥ 30 years (n = 8, 5%), while type of work appeared in the order of healthcare (n = 60, 66%), nursing (n = 13, 14%), and administrative (n = 12, 13%) ( Table 1 ). In the survey on the need for specialized education training on epidemiological investigation for KCDC employees and local municipal health department officials, 83% of all respondents (93% of specialists, 83% of KCDC employees, and 67% of EIS officers) responded "yes, " indicating a need for such training for KCDC employees, while 91% of all respondents (95% of local municipal health department officials, 89% of EIS officers, and 85% of specialists) responded "yes" in case of local municipal health department officials (Figure 1 ). In the survey on educational operation when planning epidemiological investigation specialist nurturing, different responses were given depending on the target of educational training, as shown in Table 2 . For educational training targeting KCDC employees, the mean number of hours per training session was 53.4 while the mean number of annual training sessions was 6.4. For interval between training sessions, 3 months was the most common response (n = 52, 41%) while the combination of lectures and practical exercises (n = 121, 95%) was the most frequent response given as the most appropriate training method. The most common responses to the number of participants per training session and the department in charge of training were 10-19 participants (n = 83, 65%) and self-operation by KCDC (n = 57, 45%), respectively. With respect to the need for training before assigning tasks to new employees, 97% (n= 124) responded "yes" with 2 weeks being the most common response for the length of training prior to assigning tasks to new employees (n = 49, 40%). For educational training targeting local municipal health department officials, the mean number of hours per training session was 44.1 while the mean number of annual training sessions was 6.8. For interval between training sessions, 3 months was the most common response (n= 46, 53%) while the combination of lectures and practical exercises (n= 75, 86%) was the most frequent response given as the most appropriate training method. The most common responses to the number of participants per training session and the department in charge of training were 10-19 participants (n = 41, 47%) and self-operation by KCDC (n = 48, 55%), respectively. With respect to the need for training before assigning tasks to new employees, 93% (n= 82) responded "yes" with within 1 week being the most common response for the length of training prior to assigning tasks to new employees (n = 32, 39%). The results from the survey on assessment of the impact of education training on epidemiological investigation competency and the required training curriculum, graded on a maximum of 5.0 points, are shown in Table 3 . In the survey on assessment of the impact of education training on epidemiological investigation competency conducted among KCDC employees, the highest scores were found in the items "water-borne and food-borne infectious diseases, " "infectious diseases targeted for vaccination, " and "chronic infectious diseases" with 3.0 points each. Within the category of infectious disease epidemiology, the highest scores were found in "understanding the concept and processes of epidemiological studies" and "use of personal protective equipment" with 3.0 points each. In the category of data collection and analysis, the highest score of 3.1 points was found in "understanding the scale of data and inputting data. " For sample collection and laboratory testing, "collection, packaging, and transportation of samples" and "understanding and interpreting the test results" showed the highest scores of 2.9 points each while, for other capabilities, "creating documents" had the highest score of all with 3.5 points. In the survey on the need for training program conducted on KC DC employees, "emerging infectious disease" had the highest score of 4.4 points in the category of understanding of infectious diseases while "understanding the concept and processes of epidemiological studies" had the highest score of 4.5 points in the category of infectious disease epidemiology. In the category of data collection and analysis, "descriptive analysis of epidemiological studies" had the highest score of 4.1 points while, in the category of sample collection and laboratory testing, "collection, packaging, and transportation of samples" and "understanding and interpreting the test results" showed the same scores of 3.8 points. Meanwhile, among other capabilities, the highest score of 4.0 points was found in "presentation of epidemiological studies data and results to decision-makers and stakeholders. " In the survey on assessment of the impact of education training on epidemiological investigation competency conducted for local municipal health department officials, "infectious diseases targeted for vaccination" had the highest score of 2.8 points in the category of understanding of infectious diseases while "use of personal protective equipment" had the highest score of 2.8 points in the category of infectious disease epidemiology.
