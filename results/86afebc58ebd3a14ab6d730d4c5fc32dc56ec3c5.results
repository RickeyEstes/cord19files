Rapid S. pneumoniae replication, pronounced immunopathology, and deleterious clinical outcomes in control animals Before (0 hour) or upon pulmonary S. pneumoniae infection, the control mice that received an empty control Ad vector before infection (Addl group; Figure 1a ) were found to have minimally detectable levels of type 1 IFN-α in the lung (Figure 1b) . These mice suffered progressively deteriorating body weight losses (Figure 1c ), which were associated with heightened immunopathology including intrabronchial hemorrhage in the lung ( Figure 1d ) and 85% death by 7 days postinfection ( Figure 1c ). On examination of bacterial burden, high levels of S. pneumoniae counts were found at 48 and 72 hours both in the lung and spleen (Figure 1e , black bars). These data suggest that the control animals have difficulty to effectively control S. pneumoniae infection, systemic dissemination, and associated tissue inflammation in the lung. IFN-α gene transfer controls S. pneumoniae replication and immunopathology and improves clinical outcomes Given that there were only minimal levels of IFN-α detected in the lung of S. pneumoniae infected control (Addl) mice (Figure 1b) , we set out to determine the role of raised lung levels of IFN-α in host defense against S. pneumoniae infection. To this end, we used a transient transgenic approach for expression of IFN-α in the lung by i.n. delivering a recombinant replication-defective Ad5 gene transfer vector encoding mIFN-α (AdIFN-α) before S. pneumoniae infection. Thus, in contrast to minimal levels of IFN-α in the lung of the mice receiving the empty vector (Addl) before and after S. pneumoniae infection (Figure 1b) , the mice receiving AdIFN-α had significantly raised levels of IFN-α in the lung before S. pneumoniae infection (0 hour) (Figure 1b ). There were also elevated circulating levels of IFN-α in these mice (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Compared with Addl controls, levels of IFN-α remained raised in the lung at 20, 48, and 72 hours after S. pneumoniae infection (Figure 1b) . We found that elevated IFN-α levels significantly reduced body weight loss in these mice, which was monitored as a measure of overall illness ( Figure 1c) . Thus, there was only a small and transient body weight loss (4.4%) at 48 hours post-Strep infection in these mice, in sharp contrast to 8.2 and 14.0% body weight losses at 48 and 72 hours, respectively, in the control mice ( Figure 1c ). In addition, although 85% of control mice reached end point by 7 days postinfection, only 15% death was observed in the IFN-α-expressing group (Figure 1c) . Consistent with improved survival, immunopathology and tissue injury were much reduced in the lung of IFN-α-expressing mice ( Figure 1d) . Furthermore, the bacterial load both in the lungs and in the spleens of these mice was dramatically (multiple logs) lower, compared with that in the control counterparts ( Figure 1e ). These findings suggest that transgenically raised IFN-α levels are immune protective from acute pneumococcal pneumonia, capable of effectively controlling S. pneumoniae replication and improving lung immunopathology and clinical outcome. IFN-α gene transfer leads to rapid induction of innate immune cellular infiltration and cytokine responses in the lung upon S. pneumoniae infection To begin investigating the mechanisms of improved bacterial control and clinical outcome mediated by IFN-α gene transfer to the lung, we first analyzed the innate cellular responses in the lung at 20 hours post-Strep using flow cytometry. Total inflammatory infiltrate numbers were almost threefold higher in the respiratory tract (bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)) of IFN-α-expressing mice compared with the controls (Table 1) . This was accounted for primarily by markedly increased neutrophil influx in the BAL (Figure 2a,b) . Higher cell numbers and neutrophil influx were also observed at 48 hours in these mice (Table 1 and data not shown). In comparison, neutrophil numbers in the lung parenchyma were similar between the two groups, as were macrophages in the BAL and lung parenchyma ( Figure 2a ). In addition to neutrophils, there appeared to be moderately increased natural killer (NK) cells and T cells in the lung parenchyma of IFN-α-expressing mice (Supplementary Figure S2) . These data suggest that some of such altered innate immune cellular responses might be involved in enhanced immune protection by IFN-α gene transfer. 10, 22 Given the increased neutrophilic responses in the BAL by IFNα gene transfer, we next assessed cytokine and chemokine levels in the BAL at 20 hours following S. pneumoniae infection. Indeed, compared with the control animals, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β were increased in the IFN-α-expressing mice (Figure 2c ). Associated with increased proinflammatory cytokines were higher levels of chemokines including the neutrophil chemoattractants macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2) and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) (Figure 2c ). These results together show that raised IFNα levels enhance host defense against S. pneumoniae infection via rapid induction of cytokine responses and innate cellular responses in the lung at early time points postinfection, thus leading to better control of bacterial replication and immunopathology. Rapidly diminishing tissue inflammatory responses induced by IFN-α gene transfer in the latter stages of S. pneumoniae infection To further investigate the potential mechanisms for improved clinical outcome by IFN-α gene transfer, we examined the innate cellular and cytokine responses at the later time point of 72 hours after S. pneumoniae infection, when the control mice were approaching end point ( Figure 1c ) and had uncontrolled lung inflammation ( Figure 1d ) and bacterial outgrowth (Figure 1e ). By this time, IFN-α-expressing mice had remarkably diminished numbers of neutrophils both in the BAL and in the lung parenchyma compared with the control mice ( Figure  3a ). The number of macrophages also markedly decreased in the BAL of IFN-α-expressing mice (Figure 3a) . The rapid clearance of cellular infiltrates from the lung of these mice was associated with a sharp decline in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Figure 3b ), contrary to higher levels of these cytokines at 20 hours post-Strep infection (Figure 2b ). On the other hand, by 72 hours, the control mice had excessive influx of neutrophils and macrophages in the BAL and lung (Figure 3a ), corresponding to 12-fold more total inflammatory cells in the airway (Table 1) . Heightened inflammatory cellular responses in the control animals were associated with sustained proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, and remarkably increased levels (up to 3,900 pg/ml) of chemokines Figure 3b ). These data suggest that earlier increased innate immune responses induced by IFN-α gene transfer lead to rapid control of bacterial infection and help the lung to return to homeostasis. On the other hand, the control animals have markedly heightened inflammatory responses due to uncontrolled bacterial infection. Enhanced neutrophil responses contribute to improved bacterial clearance by IFN-α gene transfer To further assess the mechanisms of increased bacterial control by raised IFN-α levels, we measured reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) (hydrogen peroxide, peroxyl radical, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite anion) in lung homogenates collected at various time points post-Strep infection, given their critical antibacterial activities and association with activated neutrophils and macrophages. Significantly increased levels of ROS/RNS were induced by IFN-α at 8, 20, and 48 hours with equalized levels with the control mice at 72-hour postinfection ( Figure 4 ). The largest difference in ROS/RNS between the two groups was seen at 20-hour postinfection (Figure 4 ), corresponding with high neutrophil influx in the lung of the mice with raised IFN-α levels at this time point (Figure 2a) . Based on the ROS/RNS data, we further investigated the role of increased neutrophils in improved bacterial control by IFN-α. To this end, we undertook a strategy that allowed only partial neutrophil depletion from the lungs of IFN-α-expressing mice prior to S. pneumoniae infection. Thus, the mice received the IFN-α gene transfer vector as depicted in Figure 1a and were then treated i.n. once with a neutrophil-depleting antibody (α-Ly6G) at 4 hours before S. pneumoniae infection. The control IFN-α-expressing mice received only the control immunoglobulin G. By flow cytometry, this protocol was found to render ~57% reduction in neutrophils in S. pneumoniaeinfected mice by 20-hour postinfection and 30% reduction by 72 hours as neutrophil influx continued into the lung (Supplementary Figure S3 ). We found that such partial neutrophil depletion led to significantly greater weight loss (Figure 5a ), worsened bacterial control both in the lung and in the spleen (Figure 5b) , and markedly reduced measurable ROS/RNS in the lung (Figure 5c ). Nevertheless, notably the extent of body weight loss and increased bacterial load in partially neutrophil-depleted IFN-α-expressing animals did not reach that previously seen in the Addl control group (Figure 1c,e) . These data together suggest that enhanced neutrophil responses induced by IFN-α gene transfer contribute to improved bacterial clearance and clinical outcome. Improved macrophage phagocytic killing of S. pneumoniae by IFN-α transgene expression The observation that neutrophil depletion in IFN-α-expressing mice resulted in only a significantly reduced, but not completely eliminated, IFN-α-mediated enhancement in protection ( Figure 5 ) suggested additional mechanisms at play. Although IFN-α expression did not increase the number of macrophages in the lung (Figure 2a) , it is possible that the antibacterial property of these innate immune cells was altered by IFN-α. To examine this possibility, freshly isolated naive alveolar macrophages (AMs) and purified lung macrophages (MOs) were transduced in vitro to express IFN-α by AdIFN-α or treated with the control vector Addl, and then viable streptococci were added to these macrophages. AdIFN-α-transduced, but not the control AMs and lung MOs produced significant levels of IFN-α as measured in the culture media (Supplementary Figure S4) . IFN-α-producing AMs and lung MOs also produced much higher levels of antibacterial ROS/RNS upon bacterial phagocytosis than their control counterparts (Figure 6a) . Importantly, IFN-α-producing AMs were three times more effective at bacterial killing than the non-IFN-α producers (Figure 6b ). In comparison, although killing efficiency was similar at 1 hour, IFN-α-producing lung MOs were significantly more effective at bacterial killing by 2 hours compared with the non-IFN-α producers, which ceased to kill any more streptococci by this time (Figure 6b ). These data indicate that besides neutrophils, activation of alveolar and lung macrophages by IFNα expression represents an additional mechanism for enhanced immune protection and improved bacterial control. Therapeutic IFN-α gene transfer rendered after S. pneumoniae infection controls bacterial replication and improves clinical outcomes To determine the therapeutic potential of IFN-α for pneumococcal infections, mice were infected with S. pneumoniae, and 12 hours later, they were inoculated i.n. with AdIFN-α or Addl control vector ( Figure 7a ). While body weight losses were similar between the two groups for the initial course of infection, IFN-α-expressing mice experienced stalled body weight loss at 48 hours and began to recover by 68 hours, leading to 50% death in the group by 7 days postinfection (Figure 7c ). This was in sharp contrast to the control mice that exhibited progressively deteriorating clinical conditions, with most approaching the end point soon after 68 hours, with 100% death in the group by 7 days postinfection (Figure 7c ). Consistent with improved clinical outcomes induced by IFN-α, the lung of IFN-α-expressing mice had markedly reduced immunopathology with inflammation primarily limited to the peribronchial and perivascular regions (Figure 7b ). In contrast, the control lungs had severe and diffuse tissue immunopathology and inflammation (Figure 7b ). Also consistent with improved clinical outcome and immunopathology induced by therapeutic IFN-α gene transfer, these mice had significantly lower bacterial loads both in the lung and in the spleen compared with the control mice (Figure 7d ). The almost one-log difference in colony-forming unit (cfu) in the lungs (Figure 7d) is correlated with significant improvement in lung pathology (Figure 7b ), weight loss, and survival (Figure 7c ). These findings together support the therapeutic potential of raised IFN-α in the lung by using a gene transfer strategy in effectively controlling S. pneumoniae infection and its associated detrimental clinical outcomes.
