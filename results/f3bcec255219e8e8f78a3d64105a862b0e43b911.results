A total of 204 nursing students participated in the study. They ranged from 18 to 23 years, and 21.6% of them were males (N ¼ 44) . The results of user-seal-check against that of the gold standard QNFT for each type of respirator (3M 1860S and 3M 1862) are presented in Table II Table III presents the detailed results. Of the participants, 37.3% (N ¼ 76) passed the QNFT for both respirators, and only 18.6% (N ¼ 38) of the participants failed the QNFT for both respirators (data not shown). Therefore >80% of the participants passed QNFT with one or other respirator. There was no association between the passing QNFT for the 3M 1860S respirator and that of 3M 1862 respirator (c 2 ¼ 1.57, P ¼ 0.134). The user-sealcheck was no more accurate among females compared with males with regard to accuracy (ACC), i.e. 57.5% vs 70.5% for the 3M 1860S respirator, and 59.4% vs 68.2% for the 3M 1862S respirator. There was no association between sex and QNFT results for the 3M 1860S respirators (c 2 ¼ 3.10, P ¼ 0.055), whereas there was a difference between sexes for the 3M 1862 respirators (c 2 ¼ 5.42, P ¼ 0.014). The male participants had higher pass rates than the female participants for both the 3M 1860S respirator (72.7% vs 58.1%) and 3M 1862 respirator (72.7% vs 53.1%).
