Design of PCLSR. The PCLSR method relies on isothermal amplification of targeted DNA using DNA polymerase showing strand displacement features. The primer design was similar to those applied in other isothermal methods but included 2 outer-spiral primers with 5′ terminal ExF and ExR sequences reverse complementary to DNA of black widow (Latrodectus hesperus) alpha-latrotoxin (position 180-199) (Genbank accession: KF751511.1). The 3′ sequence of outer-spiral primers (IntF and IntR) were complementary to the p72 gene sequence (positions 104980-104999 and 105116-105135) of Georgia 2007/1 strain (Genbank accession: FR682468.1). The cross-linking primer AB (comprising of Link A and Link B) was complementary exclusively to p72 gene sequence of ASFV and included DraI restricition site for further confirmation of results specificity (positions 105014-105034 and 105054-105072). The primer location and sequence has been shown in Fig. 1 .
