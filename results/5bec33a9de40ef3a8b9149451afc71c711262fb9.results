The study included 66 infants (all but one born preterm), six of which (9%) were withdrawn from the study by their parents during followup. We analysed the data for a total of 60 infants: 33 (55%) were female; 30 (50%) had a gestational age below 32 weeks; and 36 (60%) weighed less than 1500 g. Mechanical ventilation was required by 41.7% of the patients (mean duration ± SD, 2.31 ± 1.73 days) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) by 31.7% (mean duration ± SD, 2.45 ± 1.74 h). A total of 256 NPA samples were collected, and 24 tested positive (9.3%); none of the positive specimens had been collected in the first day of life. The virus identified most frequently was RV, detected in 19 (79%) of the positive samples, followed by adenovirus (2 cases), CoV (3 cases) and hMPV (1 case). One patient had a RV and CoV coinfection. There were no cases of RSV or influenza. The positive NPA specimens were obtained at a mean of 35 ± 21 days (range, 8---68; median, 30). We observed a higher frequency of samples positive for respiratory viruses in patients younger than 32 weeks and with weights below 1500 g (P = .05 and P < .001, respectively). The 24 positive samples corresponded to 13 infants (21.6% of the patients), of which 9 (69%) developed symptoms, with a total 11 infectious episodes (2 patients had 2 separate episodes with a negative test result in between). Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of the episodes of respiratory infection. The symptoms found most frequently were the presence or greater number of apnoeic episodes (75%) and the need for oxygen therapy. None of the patients required mechanical ventilation, and only one patient received noninvasive ventilation. Fever occurred in 45% of the infectious episodes. Laboratory analyses were performed in 7 (64%) of the 11 infectious episodes; only one patient had leukocytosis (32,000/mL). Blood cultures were performed in 4 (36%) cases, and the results were negative for all. Antibiotic therapy was initiated in one patient for suspected sepsis. Five infants underwent chest radiographs, and atelectasis was found in one. All patients recovered. Four of the children with positive samples did not develop clinical symptoms (three had RV 3 and one CoV OC43). One of the symptomatic infants had prolonged shedding of RV for 8 weeks. No tests were performed on the healthcare staff or the parents. Table 1 compares the clinical data of the patients, (symptomatic and asymptomatic), with obtaining a positive result in the viral assays. Of the 13 infants that had a positive viral isolate, 5 (38%) developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia. One of them had an asymptomatic infection by CoV OC43 and the other 4 symptomatic infections by RV or adenovirus. Of the children that did not have a positive viral isolate, 3 (6.4%) were diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (P = .009).
