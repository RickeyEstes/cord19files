Out of almost 11 000 children seen in the emergency department of HER during the 13-month study period, 700 under the age of five were recruited into the study. Six hundred and eighty-nine (98.4%) of these children had all the necessary outcome data for inclusion in this specific risk factor analysis ( Figure 1 ). There were 28 deaths among these 689 patients (4.0%), and 55 children (8.0%) required transfer to the ICU. The mean RISC score for the overall study population was 1.36 (SD 1.34). With regard to the two established risk groups, 502 (72.8%) children were assigned to the good prognosis group and 187 (27.2%) to the poor prognosis group (Figure 1) . The socio-demographic characteristics and health history factors of the patients according to the prognosis group are shown in Table 1 . Patients with a worse outcome were significantly younger; no difference was found regarding gender. No significant differences were seen in terms of any seasonality of admission in relation to outcome (data not shown). A history of having been born prematurely, having received antibiotics preceding admission, or having an already known co-morbidity had a significant association with a poorer outcome, while a history of previous admission for LRTI or wheezing was strongly associated with a good prognosis. Finally, being exposed to tobacco smoking at home was also significantly associated with a worse outcome. In terms of the current admission history and other clinical indicators, patients with a worse outcome were clearly more severely ill on admission (including a significantly higher mean temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate, and a lower oxygen saturation) and had a significantly longer history of symptoms ( Table 2 ). They were also significantly more likely to have required antibiotics during hospitalization (OR 8.75, p < 0.001). Their nutritional status was also significantly poorer, with up to 16.5% (30/182) being severely malnourished. In terms of respiratory signs, only wheezing was significantly more common among children with a good prognosis. Radiologically confirmed pneumonia was again much more frequent (32.9% vs. 14.5%, p = 0.001) amongst children with a poorer outcome, and hospitalizations were significantly more prolonged in this group (9.96 days vs. 4.31 days, p = 0.001). Laboratory and microbiology findings also showed important differences between the two groups, with children with a worse outcome being significantly more anaemic and more frequently demonstrating elevated biomarkers of infection (PCT and CRP). Importantly, no differences were seen according to the outcome group in the mean white blood cell count or in the prevalence of leukopenia or leukocytosis ( Table 3) . As expected, cases of bacteraemia were significantly more frequent among the group with a poor outcome, and so were infections with hMPV. In contrast, infections with RV appeared to be associated with a good outcome (p = 0.001). The multivariate analysis of factors associated with the prognosis ( .02) were all independent risk factors for an adverse outcome, whereas a history of asthma (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25-0.84) was the only independent risk factor for a positive outcome.
