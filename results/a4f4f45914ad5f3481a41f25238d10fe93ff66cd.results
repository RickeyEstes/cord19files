Fecal samples from healthy straw-colored fruit bats (E. helvum) were pooled and sequenced by Illumina next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Ten out of the twenty-four pools contained papillomavirus reads, ranging from 0.01-13.3% of viral reads (Supplementary data S3). NGS alone was insufficient to produce contigs representing a complete PV genome. Therefore, from each pool, individual sample(s) containing the PV were identified on which subsequent experiments were carried out. For pool three (P3) rolling-circle amplification (RCA) and the Expand Long Template PCR system allowed us to amplify two complete PV genomes (EhPV2 and EhPV3). Subsequently, primer walking (and resequencing with designed primers at different regions for validation) was used to get the complete sequence of the genomes. Several attempts to amplify the other three PVs either by RCA and/or Expand Long Template PCR system failed. Therefore, only partial genomes (covered by 50-100 reads) from pools P5 (BATPV61, KX276955) and P25 (BATPV890a, KX276954 and BATPV890b, KX276953) are presented here. Only very few reads in pools 2, 4, 10, 14, and 17 were classified as PVs, indicating low viral load and so no further attempts were made to amplify their full genomes. EhPV1 and EhPV2 have a length of 7958 and 7991 base pair (bp) with a GC content of 51% and 50%, respectively. Like all PVs that have been characterized so far these PVs have all their ORFs on the same coding strand and in the same orientation of their dsDNA genome. They both contain the typical early proteins E6, E7, E1, and E2, the late proteins L2 and L1 and the non-coding regulatory region (NCR) between E6 and L1 of 741 and 860 bp, respectively (Fig. 1) . The nt and amino acids (aa) locations of various predicted features (motifs) of EhPV2 and EhPV3 are shown in Table 1 . The E6 ORFs of EhPV2 and EhPV3 are composed of 179 and 174 amino acids (aa), respectively, with both containing two zinc-binding domains with the sequence C-X-X-C-X 29 -C-X-X-C and C-X-X-C-X 30 -C-X-X-C separated by 36 aa. The E7 protein of both viruses also contain a zinc binding domain (CX 2 CX 29 CX 2 C) and a pRb binding motif (L-X-C-X-E), with sizes of 179 and 174 aa, respectively. The E1 ORFs encode the largest protein, 644 and 680 aa in EhPV2 and EhPV3, respectively and the ATP-binding site of the ATP- dependent helicase (GPPNTGKS) is conserved in the C-terminal part of both E1 proteins. A leucine zipper domain (LX 6 LX 6 LX 6 L), a major characteristic of E2, was not present in the carboxyl-terminal part of both E2 proteins. A distinct E4 could not be identified, but there is however a proline rich portion within the E2 ORFs (proline content of 11% and 13.5% respectively). The late regions of the genomes contained the major (L1) and minor (L2) capsid protein genes and both contained a series of arginine and lysine residues (RKRRKRKR and KRKRR; RKKRKRK and KRRRR, respectively) at their 3′ end, which functions as a nuclear localization signal. On the nucleotide level, EhPV3 contains the polyadenylation signals (AATAAA) for the early and late transcripts at the beginning of the L2 gene and in the NCR (nt position 4026-4031 and 7612-7617), respectively, whereas in the EhPV2 genome it is located in the E1 and NCR (nt position 1459-1464 and 7683-7688), respectively. In the EhPV3 sequences, two TATA boxes (TATAAA) of the E6 promoter were located close to the 3′ end of the NCR (nt positions 25-30 and 7733-7738, respectively) and two others were located on E1 and E2 (nt position 2379-2384 and 3248-3253, respectively). No TATA box was present in the genome of EhPV2. Phylogenetic analysis was based on the complete L1 sequences of EhPV2 and EhPV3, nearly complete L1 of the 3 partial bat PVs (1053, 1306 and 1260 nt in length for BAT61, BAT890a and BAT890b, respectively), and 97 other animal and human PVs (Fig. 2) . Both EhPV2 and EhPV3 L1 clustered distantly together with the Rousettus aegyptiacus papillomavirus type 1 (RaPV1), classified in the genus Psipapillomavirus. The other bat PVs in this study clustered at different positions of the tree. BATPV61 clustered distantly with the PVs of the genera Dyodeltapapillomavirus (represented by SsPV1, isolated from domestic pig), Omegapapillomavirus (containing UmPV1, isolated from polar bear), an unclassified genus (containing MrPV1 from rickett's bigfooted bat) and Dyopipapillomavirus (containing PphPV4, isolated from harbour porpoise). Furthermore, BATPV890a and BATPV890b clustered distantly with the unclassified Eidolon helvum papillomavirus type 1 (EhPV1) isolated from the hair follicle of straw-colored fruit bat from Germany. The L1 sequences of EhPV2 and EhPV3 share nucleotide similarities ranging from 60 to 64% with RaPV1. According to the recent classification criteria, PV types belong to different PV genera when they share less than 60% nucleotide sequence identity across the entire L1 ORF and species within a genus, 60-70% nucleotide identity (10), therefore these 3 isolates may represent distinct species in the genus Psipapillomavirus. Other PVs identified in this study had a similarity between 55 and 64% with the closest mammalian PVs. However, since we were unable to retrieve their complete L1 sequences, the classification of these partially sequenced PVs remains preliminary.
