We collected and tested respiratory swabs from 104 patients hospitalized with respiratory illness: 50 SARI cases from adult medicine wards and 54 severe pneumonia cases from paediatric medicine wards. The median age of patients in the adult wards was 32 years (IQR 25-48) and in paediatric wards three months (IQR 2-6). The male-to-female ratio was 2.6:1 (Table 1) . Of the 104 patients, 79 (75%) had detectable viral and/or bacterial nucleic acid in their respiratory swabs. Paediatric patients more frequently had one or more detectable pathogen in their respiratory swabs than adult patients (91% versus 60%, p = 0.001). Bacterial pathogens were identified in 76% of adult respiratory swabs. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and
