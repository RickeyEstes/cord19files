Eight of the nine United States healthcare facilities in which SARS-CoV-infected patients were evaluated participated in the investigation. Six of the eight SARS-CoV-positive patients visited or were hospitalized at these eight facilities. A total of 110 healthcare workers (range 4-36 healthcare workers per healthcare facility) participated in this follow-up investigation (Table 1 ). This total represented approximately 85% of healthcare workers who were identified as being at high risk for infection. Healthcare workers were exposed to these patients from March 15 to June 23, 2003. The median age of healthcare workers was 41 years (range 23-61), 75% were females, and 74% were Caucasian ( Table 2 ). The most common occupation was nursing staff (48%), and the most common work site was the medical ward (38%), followed by the emergency department (24%) ( Table 2 ). Preexisting medical conditions in the healthcare workers were infrequent (data not shown). Each healthcare worker was exposed over a median of 2.0 days (range 1-14), during which a median of 3.0 interactions (range 1-50) with the SARS patient occurred. Of the 102 healthcare workers from whom complete data were available, 45 (44%) reported exposure without any type of mask; 72 (70%) had exposure without eye protection (Table 3) . Sixty-six healthcare workers (65%) reported that the patient was coughing during one or more patient-worker interactions. Of these, 40% had at least one exposure without a respirator and 52% had at least one without gown, gloves, and eye protection. Eleven (11%) reported interaction with a patient who had active diarrhea, and 1 (1%) reported exposure during patient vomiting (Table 4) . Healthcare procedures with high potential to generate droplets and aerosols were infrequent: 5 healthcare workers (5%) reported manipulating an airway, (i.e., performing endotracheal intubation or suctioning), and 4 (4%) reported being present during administration of aerosolized medications (Table 4) . Three healthcare facilities instituted full infectioncontrol precautions (i.e., full use of personal protective equipment and placement in an isolation room) on the first day the patient was seen. Healthcare workers in these facilities reported significantly fewer unprotected exposures, in comparison to facilities where full SARS precautions were not instituted on the first day (62% vs. 87%, p < 0.05). To assess adherence to infection-control practices, we identified healthcare workers who had all of their exposures only after full SARS precautions were started. We identified 43 such workers, representing all of the healthcare facilities that instituted precautions. In these workers, lapses in infection control still occurred, with nearly half reporting unprotected exposures, including many with no eye protection (Table 5) . Clinical signs or symptoms developed in 17 healthcare workers (15%) after exposure to one of the laboratory-confirmed SARS patients, most commonly cough (Table 6) . Convalescent-phase serum samples were available for 103 (94%) healthcare workers; none (0%) tested positive for SARS-CoV. During the outbreak, CDC recommended furlough for any exposed healthcare worker in whom symptoms developed within 10 days of last exposure. Fifteen healthcare workers in this review (14%) were excluded from all or selected duties as a result of SARS exposure. Of these, seven reported symptoms (fever, respiratory symptoms, or radiographically confirmed pneumonia), and eight were asymptomatic. However, 10 symptomatic healthcare workers were not excluded from duty, including four nurses or nurses' aides and one physician.
