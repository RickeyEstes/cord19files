Intranasal Vaccination with VRP-SARS-N Results in CD4 + T Cell-Dependent Protection against SARS-CoV Previously, we identified a dominant CD4 + T cell epitope in the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV (N353) recognized in BALB/c (H-2 d ) mice; no CD8 + T cell epitopes are present in this protein (Zhao et al., 2010) . This region of N is also targeted by CD4 + T cells from SARS convalescent patients (Oh et al., 2011; Peng et al., 2006) . We initially evaluated whether intranasal (i.n.) immunization, which generates local CD4 + T cell responses, or footpad vaccination, which generates a systemic T cell response, resulted in differences in protection against challenge with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (Roberts et al., 2007) . For this purpose, we vaccinated BALB/c mice twice at 6-7 week intervals with VRP-SARS-N or a control VRP expressing green fluorescent protein (VRP-GFP) i.n. or subcutaneously (s.c.) prior to challenge. VRPs are non-replicating vaccine vectors that preferentially infect human and mouse dendritic cells and serve as selfadjuvants (Moran et al., 2005; Tonkin et al., 2012) . Only i.n. inoculation with VRP-SARS-N induced an N-specific CD4 + T cell response in the lungs and airways, which was increased by i.n. VRP-SARS-N boosting ( Figure 1A ). In contrast, s.c. inoculation resulted in a CD4 + T cell response primarily in the spleen with virtually no N-specific T cells identified in the lungs or airway. Subcutaneous boosting increased the numbers of virus-specific cells in the spleen but not in respiratory tissue. As expected, VRP-SARS-N administration resulted in accumulation of N-expressing DCs and, consequently, more N-specific CD4 + T cells in the draining mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs; i.n. immunization) and popliteal lymph nodes (PLNs; s.c. immunization) ( Figure S1 ). Protection from lethal disease was nearly complete after i.n. but not s.c. administration of VRP-SARS-N, demonstrating the importance of the route of vaccination ( Figure 1B) . Protection was observed against challenge with doses ranging from 100 to 10,000 PFUs of SARS-CoV ( Figure 1C ). By days 4-6 after challenge, SARS-CoV-infected VRP-GFP-immunized mice develop severe edema with a relative paucity of infiltrating cells whereas intranasal VRP-SARS-N-immunized mice displayed prominent peribronchiolar and perivascular infiltration and minimal amounts of edema in the lungs. Subcutaneous immunization with VRP-SARS-N did not protect against edema formation ( Figure 1D ). Consistent with these results, intranasal VRP-SARS-N immunization enhanced the kinetics of virus clear-ance ( Figure 1E ). Next we assessed the role of memory CD4 + T cells in protection by depleting them systemically 2 days prior to challenge. This abrogated protection ( Figures 1F and S2A ), indicating that memory CD4 + T cells might be important for protection. In a subsequent set of experiments, to confirm the importance of memory CD4 + T cells, vaccinated mice were treated with CD4 + T-cell-depleting antibody 98 days prior to challenge to allow CD4 + T cell recovery ( Figure S2B ). These mice were not protected against SARS-CoV challenge ( Figure 1F ) and developed histological changes similar to those observed in VRP-GFP-immunized mice ( Figure 1G ). N-specific CD4 + T cell numbers gradually decreased after vaccination ( Figure 1H ) but still mediated partial protection after challenge at 41 weeks after boosting ( Figure 1I ). CD4 + T cells provide helper function for antibody production, but unlike sera from VRP-SARS-S, which induced neutralizing antibody, sera from VRP-SARS-N-immunized mice were not protective upon transfer to naive mice prior to challenge ( Figure 1J ). Protection was also observed in mice immunized with another vaccine, recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the N protein (rVV-SARS-N) ( Figure 1K ). Because the CD4 + T cell response was more robust in VRP-compared to rVV-immunized mice (data not shown), we used VRP-SARS-N for the remainder of the subsequent experiments. 12-monthold mice are very susceptible to SARS-CoV ; however, VRP-SARS-N vaccination at 12 months and analysis at 15 months of age resulted in protection against challenge, demonstrating efficacy even in this highly vulnerable population ( Figure 1L ). Together, these results indicate that intranasal but not subcutaneous immunization induced a protective CD4 + T cell immune response.
