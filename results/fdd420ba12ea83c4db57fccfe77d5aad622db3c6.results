The scatter plots show the expression profile of 84 genes of taiep rat in comparison with the control profile of SD rats (Figure 1 ). No upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines was determined at any age and group studied. In contrast, downregulation was established for IL-1 (−3. Comparisons between results from 6-month-old versus 1month-old rats in the same group show no significant changes in gene expression in SD rats, except for two downregulated chemokines, CXCL9 (−3.9, < 0.05) and TGFB1 (−3.6, < 0.05), while, in taiep rats, gene expression was downregulated for 5 chemokines: CCR8 (−5.2, = 0.05), CCR9 (−7.7, < 0.05), CXCL5 (−2.2, < 0.05), MAPK1 (−15.3, < 0.05), and TGFB1 (−3.5, < 0.05) (Figure 3) . Comparison of protein levels between taiep rats and SD rats showed changes in chemokine receptors and growth factors at both ages. At 1 month of age, receptors that increased were CCR2 (43.5 ± 5.1%), CCR8 (111.3 ± 12.4%), CXCR4 (115.8 ± 18.1%), and FGF2 (27.6% ± 4.1). In contrast, CCR5 (−19.8 ± 5.1) and CXCL1 (−82.2 ± 1.6%) were decreased (Figure 4 ). In the brainstem of 6-month-old rats, protein levels were decreased for CCL2 (−39.0% ± 5.5%), CXCL1 (−80.9% ± 3.6%), CCR1 (−14.4% ± 7.9%), CCR2 (−41.2% ± 1.4%), CCR5 (−21.8% ± 5.8%), CCR8 (−34.6% ± 5.8%), CXCR4 (−54.4% ± 3.7%), and, the growth factor, FGF2 (−42.7% ± 2.7%). In contrast, VEGFA (125.5% ± 29.7%) levels increased (Figure 4) . Immunofluorescence studies showed decreased intensity against CCR5 and CXCR4 in the brainstem of 6-month-old taiep rats in comparison with SD rats. CCR5 immunostaining was evident in glial cells located in the white matter of both SD and taiep rats. CCR2 and CXCR2 were found in glial cells and neurons, but CXCR4 was observed in glial cells ( Figure 5 ). CXCR2 immunofluorescence intensity in taiep rats was not different from that in SD rats ( Figure 5 ).
