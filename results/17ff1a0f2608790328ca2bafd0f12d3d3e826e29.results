The number of emergency department visits during the pre-SARS, SARS and post-SARS periods were 49,462, 34,844 and 83,596, respectively (Table 1) . There was a significant increase in the proportion of resuscitation cases managed during the SARS period compared to the pre-SARS period (OR 1.434, CI 1.357, 1.514) but no difference between those of the pre-and post-SARS periods. There were 162, 162 and 209 emergency airway interventions during these three periods resulting in the airway intervention rates as 3.3, 4.6 and 2.5 per 1000 emergency department visits respectively. There was a significant increase in the airway intervention rate in the SARS period compared to the pre-SARS period (OR 1.421, CI 1.143, 1.768). There was no difference in the airway intervention rate between the post-and pre-SARS period. There was no change in patient demographics during the three periods (Table 1 ). There were also no differences in the presenting diagnoses of the patients during the three periods (Table 2) . Oral tracheal intubation without medication was the most common method of intubation followed by intubation with induction and neuromuscular blocking agents during all three periods (Table 3) . There was no significant difference in the method of intubation among the three periods. Attending emergency physicians attempted 53.7% of intubations during the pre-SARS period. This increased to 56.2% during SARS and 81.3% in the post-SARS period (Table 4 ). There was no significant increase in the number of intubations attempted by emergency physicians during the SARS period compared with the pre-SARS period; however there was a significant increase in the were no significant differences in the success rates for all personnel comparing the SARS and post-SARS periods with the pre-SARS period (Table 5) . Overall, 93.2%, 97.5% and 95.7% of intubations were successful after two attempts for all cases (Table 6 ) during the pre-SARS, SARS and post-SARS periods, respectively. With the exclusion of cardiac arrests, the success rates after the second attempt were 93.1%, 96.6% and 96.2%, respectively. Complications related to airway management during all the periods included cardiac arrest, hypotension, mainstem bronchus intubation discovered on chest radiographs, oesophaegal intubation, multiple attempts at intubation, aspiration, dysrrhythmias, equipment failure (e.g. tracheal tube cuff leak), oropharygeal and dental trauma, medication error and failed intubation. There were no significant differences in the overall complication rate among the three periods (10.5% pre-SARS, 10.5% during SARS and 9.6% post-SARS). There were no deaths resulting from a failed airway. However, there was a significant increase in the number of patients who died from their medical condition during the SARS period compared to the pre-SARS period (OR 1.618, CI 1.039, 2.521) ( Table 1 ).
