Shared and differentially expressed genes in wild type and Sphk2 −/− mouse lungs with or without PA exposure Analysis of gene expression showed that 375 genes were differentially regulated by PA infection of mouse lungs compared to the corresponding uninfected control mice. Venn diagram showing the number of genes differentially regulated in the WT and Sphk2 −/− mice exposed to PA based on two-way ANOVA analysis is shown in Fig. 1 . under three different categories viz.:  . "Pathway Maps" ontology was used to analyze differentially expressed genes. 50 most enriched pathways (PW) were identified, and nodal PWs were clustered based on their gene content with stress on reduced duplication. Initially, a complete linkage hierarchical clustering on the Jaccard distance between the complete set of genes in each PW was done. This was followed by identification of closely related individual entities. Using a dissimilarity cut off of 0.6, each cluster of closely related PWs was taken as one mega pathway. Heatmaps were created by combing the associated differential genes in order to analyze gene interactions. Details of clustering pathways has been shown in Table 1 . The color key shows the z-scored normalized expression level ranging from dark blue to dark red. The corresponding degree of differential regulation ranges from − 2 of down regulation or more to + 2 of upregulation or more 1. Sphk2 gene knockout, 2. Exposure of the mouse to PA, and 3. Interaction of Sphk2 gene knock out and PA. The intersecting areas show the number of genes affected by the corresponding condition. The advantage with two-way ANOVA is that the third variable of interaction between the two factors is purely dependent on interaction, thus independent of the direct effect of the other two variables. Only 2 of the 375 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) could be strictly characterized as those affected solely due to the impact of genetic deletion of Sphk2 (Fig. 1) . It is also interesting to note that 1496 genes were affected by the interaction between deletion of Sphk2 and PA infection of the mouse lung. Genes differentially regulated in the immune response following PA infection (cluster 1) and NF-κB. This heat map shows the biological nodal pathway related to immune response showing differential regulation of genes among the 4 different groups as described. Key genes seen in the heat map are described here. A significant upregulation of genes such as Rela, Tlr4, Traf6, Nfkbib, Nfkb2, Relb, Nfkb1, Rel was observed
