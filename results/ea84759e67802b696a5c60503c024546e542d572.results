We first sought to characterize the organization and dynamics of proteins in the viral membrane. By labeling HA and NA, along with the viral nucleoprotein, NP, we are able to measure features of virus organization on intact, infectious particles that corroborate and extend previous observations made using electron microscopy (Calder et al., 2010; Chlanda et al., 2015; Harris et 35 al., 2006; Leser and Lamb, 2017) . Images of viruses with labeled nucleoprotein (NP, the most abundant protein in vRNP complexes and a proxy for the virus genome) reveal individual foci of NP that localize to one of the virus's poles, which we use as a fiducial mark for comparing HA and NA localization along the viral envelope. Out of 1136 filamentous viruses longer than 4.5µm, 540 contained an NP focus at one of the viral poles. We find that NA is enriched ~2x at this pole 40 relative to the middle region of the virus and the opposite pole (Fig. 1A) . This protein distribution is stable, since photobleached portions of unfixed filamentous particles do not recover fluorescence in either HA or NA over tens of minutes (Fig. 1B) . To investigate finer details of protein organization and to determine if NA in fluorescent viruses is clustered, as suggested by electron microscopy (Calder et al., 2010; Harris et al., 2006) , we use two-color stochastic optical 45 reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to reconstruct images of HA and NA with resolution ~10X better than the diffraction limit (~30 nm compared to ~300 nm; Fig. 1 -figure supplement 1) . At this resolution, we find that the tendency of NA to concentrate at one of the viral poles is pronounced even in particles smaller than 300nm in length (Fig. 1C) . We also find that the NA seen at low levels along the length of filamentous viruses without super-resolution imaging is actually organized into small NA clusters that appear to largely exclude HA (Fig. 1D) . Collectively, these measurements present a picture of a variegated IAV envelope whose spatial organization is stable and coupled to the presence and location of the viral genome, with 70% of NP-containing viruses having NA biased to the proximal pole. 5 We next investigated whether spatial organization of the IAV envelope could have functional significance for virus binding and detachment. As a first test of this idea, we compared the spatial organization of viruses that were released from the cell surface with those that remained attached after challenging the virus with the neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) oseltamivir carboxylate (He et al., 1999) (Materials and Methods) . Interestingly, viruses that escaped the cell surface under NAI 10 challenge showed significantly higher HA-NA polarity (defined as the separation between the center of masses for HA and NA divided by the virus length) than viruses released in the absence of NAI challenge (Fig. 1E) . These results suggest that viruses with NA concentrated at one of the viral poles may be more effective at navigating environments rich in sialic acid. To directly test how NA polarization might affect virus motion, we characterized interactions 15 between fluorescently-labeled viruses and sialic acid coated coverslips, where the well-defined geometry and density of sialic acid allow straightforward analysis of virus diffusion (Materials and Methods) ( Fig. 2A ). Because our approach to fluorescently labeling NA preserves its activity (Fig. 2 -figure supplement 1) and viruses harboring fluorophores on both HA and NA preserve ~85% of their infectivity (Vahey and Fletcher, 2018) , we could carry out functional assays with the virus 20 and at the same time visualize HA and NA distributions on the viral membrane. Surprisingly, the motion we observed did not resemble randomly-oriented diffusion of the viral particle, but rather persistent, Brownian ratchet-like diffusion, in which filamentous particles with polarized distributions of NA exhibited directed mobility away from their NA-rich pole (Fig. 2B , Supplementary Video 1). Labeling coverslips with Erythrina Cristagalli Lectin (ECL), which binds 25 specifically to the terminal galactose exposed following sialic acid cleavage (Iglesias et al., 1982) , revealed the history of virus trajectories and confirmed that virus motion is accompanied by receptor destruction (Fig. 2B ). Aligning the trajectories of mobile particles to the orientation of their HA-NA axis reveals that directional mobility can persist for several microns, many times the length of the particle itself (Fig. 2C ). By comparing measured trajectories (from Figure 2C ) to 30 simulated random walks in which the number of steps and the size of each step matches the observed data but the direction of each step is uncorrelated with previous steps, we estimate that the diffusion coefficient of a polarized virus is enhanced approximately five-fold as a result of directional correlations (Fig. 2D) . Consistent with the observation that polarized distributions of HA and NA serve as a determinant for persistent motion and enhanced diffusion, we find that 35 immobile viruses have, on average, less polarized distributions of HA and NA than mobile ones (Fig. 2E ). To determine if polarized distributions of NA were necessary for persistent directional mobility, we disrupted the spatial organization of viral surface proteins by removing the cytoplasmic tail of NA (residues 2-6; Fig. 3 -figure supplement 1A) and rescuing a tagged variant of the virus (NAΔCT).
