We observed healthcare activities for 52 patients with viral respiratory infections who were under isolation: 30 were in droplet and contact isolation, 21 were in droplet isolation, and 1 was in contact isolation. Fomite contact and self-contact patterns were observed for 107 HCWs, with 23 HCWs participating more than once for a total of 166 observations. Two HCW observations were excluded from data analysis because we were not able to record their contacts. In addition, we recorded fomite contacts by patients during 155 encounters. No statistically significant difference in the total number of fomite contacts (KW P = .21) or self-contacts (KW P = .10) by HCWs was identified among the 3 different observers. In 90% of visits, HCWs contacted the patient with a median of 2 contacts and 11.1 contacts per hour (Table 1 ). Fomites contacted frequently by HCWs included the tray table (48% of encounters), bed surface (41%), bed rail (41%), computer station (37%), and IV pole (32%) ( Table 1) . Fomites in the near-patient zone were contacted in 79% of encounters, with a median of 2 contacts and 13.8 contacts per hour. Fomites in the far-patient zone were contacted in 85% of encounters, with a median of 4 contacts and 23.1 contacts per hour ( Table 1 ). The contact rate on fomites in the near-patient zone was significantly lower than the rate in the far-patient zone (W pairwise, P < .05). When probability distributions could be fitted to the contact numbers, the negative binomial distribution was the best-fit distribution ( Table 1) . HCWs made self-contact in 63% of the encounters, with a median of 1 contact and 5 contacts per hour. The frequency of HCW contacts with specific body parts is summarized in Table  2 . The best-fit distributions for the number of self-contacts to the torso, lower body, hands, mask, and the total self-contact were negative binomial ( Table 2) . Self-contact differed significantly among HCWs with different job roles: Providers and respiratory therapists contacted themselves significantly more times than nurses and nurse technicians (KW, P < .05; Table 3 ). There were statistically significant differences in the grand total of fomite contacts among hospital units and HCW job roles ( Table 3 ). The median number of fomite contacts in the CDU, non-ICU, and ICU units were 10, 8, and 6, respectively; and were not statistically significantly different in pairwise tests with adjusted P values ( Figure 1 ). The median of total fomite contacts made by providers was 3, and was significantly lower than those made by nurses and nurse technicians, with median of 9 and 10 contacts, respectively (W pairwise, P < .05; Figure  2 ). In the far-patient zone, providers made significantly fewer fomite contacts than HCWs in all other job roles (W pairwise, P < .05). No differences were observed in the grand total number of fomite contacts by patient isolation category (Table 3) . Fit testing was not statistically significant for Poisson, negative binomial, or log-normal distribution, so no distribution is reported. During 22% of observed encounters, the HCW performed >1 healthcare activity (Table 4 ). Care activities observed when a single care activity was performed are listed in Table 5 , and when HCWs performed >1 care activity, they often performed 1 or more of the activities listed in Table 5 . The number of healthcare activities performed was not associated with the duration of the visit, but was positively associated with the total number of fomite contacts in the near-patient and far-patient zones (KW, P < .05). The number of fomite contacts when only 1 activity was performed was significantly less than the contacts when 2 or 3 activities happened (W pairwise, P < .05). The median visit duration was 13 minutes. When HCWs performed only 1 activity, there were significant differences in the number of patient contacts and self-contacts made during different care activities (KW, P < .05) ( Table 5 ). Pairwise comparisons indicated that during cleaning, HCWs had significantly fewer patient contacts than HCWs performing other activities, including vital signs, IV medication, oral medication, and physical examination (W pairwise, P < .05). The number of HCW self-contacts made during physical examination was significantly higher than other procedures, including vital signs, IV medication, and oral medication (W pairwise, P < .05; Table 5 ). The probability distributions of patient contacts with fomites could not be described by the negative binomial, Poisson, and log-normal distributions. The most frequently touched fomites by patients were bed surface (92% of the visits), tray table (26%), bed rail (20%), and chair (16%). In 16 of 155 patient observations (10%), the patient was walking in the patient room; otherwise, patients were in bed (Supplementary Materials 1).
