A DiUb Lys48 Activity-Based Probe Preferentially Labels SARS PLpro SARS PLpro and MERS PLpro are efficient deubiquitinating enzymes, on par with other human DUBs (Bá ez-Santos et al., 2014; Bé ké s et al., 2015; Ratia et al., 2014) ; however, SARS PLpro rapidly removes Lys48-linked Ub chains from conjugated substrates, including polyubiquitinated IkBa stabilized by tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a)/MG132 treatment ( Figure 1A ), and is unique in its recognition and release of diUb Lys48 units from chains of three or more Ubs (Bé ké s et al., 2015) . This unique activity is striking when compared to the related MERS PLpro, since they are structurally similar and share 52% amino acid sequence homology (Bá ez-Santos et al., 2014) . While SARS PLpro efficiently cleaves higher-molecular-weight (HMW) polyUb Lys48 conjugates, it exhibits poor activity in cleavage assays using free diUb chains or mono-or di-ubiquitinated substrates, such as IkBa ( Figure 1A) . These data supported a model whereby SARS PLpro uses distal Ub binding site (S2) to recognize diUb Lys48 across S2-S1 ( Figure 1B ), rather than across S1-S1 0 , as is typical for most DUBs. To provide evidence for this model, a singly N-terminal biotintagged triUb Lys48 chain ( Figure 1C ) was generated (Figures S1A-S1G) and cleaved using SARS PLpro. Analysis of cleavage intermediates shows that the N-terminal biotin-label is retained on the diUb product ( Figure 1D , right), suggesting that tri-ubiquitin (triUb) recognition requires binding via S2-S1, in a distal-to-proximal direction ( Figure 1C , top schematics). In contrast, cleavage intermediates produced by other USP-family DUBs contain mixtures of mono-and diUb products bearing the biotin tag (Figure S2A) . USP21 CD and USP2 CD show little preference, while MERS PLpro displays a slight preference. We next took advantage of linkage-specific diUb activitybased probes that place warheads at the isopeptide linkage (Figure 1E, ''in-between''; Mulder et al., 2014) or proximal end (Figure 1E, ''distal diUb Lys48 ,'' green, right cartoon; Flierman et al., 2016) . The distal diUb-ABP bears an isosteric non-hydrolyzable triazole linker in lieu of the native isopeptide linkage ( Figure S2B ). In labeling assays with SARS PLpro (Figure 1E ), the distal diUb Lys48 -ABP (green) reacted well, monoUb-ABP (orange) reacted slowly, and the in-between diUb Lys48 -ABP (red) reacted poorly, and quantification shows distal diUb Lys48 -ABP adduct forms most efficiently in comparison to other probes (Figures 1F and S2C) . The observation that SARS PLpro formed adducts least efficiently with the in-between diUb Lys48 -ABP probe (compare to monoUb-ABP), suggests that it might bind the inbetween diUb Lys48 -ABP via S2-S1, preventing it from binding and reacting via S1-S1 0 interactions ( Figure S2D ). Importantly, the in-between diUb Lys48 -ABP efficiently labels other DUBs that do not exhibit diUb preferences ( Figures S2E and S2F ). With the ideal reagent in hand, we set out to determine the structural basis for diUb Lys48 recognition by SARS PLpro. Crystal Structure of SARS PLpro Bound to a DiUb Lys48 -ABP SARS PLpro was cross-linked to the distal diUb Lys48 -ABP, purified and crystallized. Crystals diffracted to 2.85 Å , and a structure of SARS PLpro-diUb Lys48 -ABP ( Figure 2A ) was determined by molecular replacement (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Two SARS PLpro-diUb Lys48 -ABP complexes occupy the asymmetric unit. The model was refined to an R work /R free of 23.2/26.4 with good stereochemistry (Table 1) . One of the two complexes exhibits continuous electron density, while the other is less ordered with some discontinuity. Electron density is evident for the propargyl warhead of diUb Lys48 -ABP and active site Cys112 of SARS PLpro in both complexes ( Figure S3A ), but the diUb Lys48 isopeptide-mimic triazole linkage is weaker in one complex ( Figure S3B ). The diUb Lys48 -ABP-bound SARS PLpro structure reveals the basis for SARS PLpro catalytic domain recognition of proximal ( S1 Ub) and distal ( S2 Ub) Ub molecules within the context of a di-Ub Lys48 unit. The SARS PLpro catalytic domain includes an N-terminal Ub-like (Ubl) domain that is dispensable for SARS PLpro activity (Bé ké s et al., 2015; Mielech et al., 2014) , followed by classical palm and finger DUB domains, as described for SARS PLpro (Ratia et al., 2006) and other USP-family member DUBs . The DUB catalytic module superposes well between diUb Lys48 -ABP-bound SARS PLpro and structures of apo (PDB: 2FE8) or monoUb-bound SARS PLpro (PDB: 4MM3; Figures S3C and S3D), with root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) values of 0.56 Å and 0.44 Å over 255 amino acids (Ser61-Ile315), respectively. The orientation of diUb Lys48 bound to SARS PLpro is different from prior structures of Lys48-linked Ub chains, whether bound or unbound; this is most apparent when our structure is compared to the ''closed'' conformation of diUb Lys48 (PDB: 1AAR; Cook et al., 1992;  Figure 2B ). It appears that SARS PLpro stabilizes Lys48-linked Ub chains in an extended conformation, akin to conformations of Lys63-or Met1-linked diUb (Komander et al., 2009 ), yet distinct from those as well. Although SARS PLpro contacts S2 Ub and S1 Ub, it makes few contacts to the interface between S2 Ub and S1 Ub or the isopeptide analog ( Figure 2C ). The position of S1 Ub within SARS PLpro-diUb Lys48 -ABP is similar to the monoUb-SARS PLpro structure (Ratia et al., 2014) , including contacts to the S1 Ub C terminus; the S1 Ub-Ile44 patch via Met209 of SARS, and polar contacts to S1 Ub-Gln49 and S1 Ub-Arg42 by the SARS PLpro palm domain via Arg167 and Asp168, respectively ( Figure 2D ). The related viral DUB, MERS PLpro, recognizes S1 Ub in a similar manner, yet specific contacts to the S1 Ub-Ile44 patch are not identical (Bailey-Elkin et al., 2014a) . Additionally, SARS PLpro cradles S1 Ub with its fingers domain, with S1 Ub interaction surfaces comprising the largest buried interaction surface area ($890 Å 2 ). In comparison to apo SARS, both structures with monoUb and diUb bound reveal similar displacements of the BL2-loop ( Figure S3E ) that accommodates the Ub C-terminal tail in the active site (Ratia et al., 2014) . When compared to the monoUb-bound SARS PLpro complex, a small conformational change is observed in S1 Ub with respect to displacement of a loop between Ub amino acids 51-57 that is next to Lys48 and the triazole linkage ( Figures S3F and S3G ). To query if displacement could be due to the triazole linkage, our diUb structure was compared to Lys48-linked diUb (PDB 1AAR) revealing that amino acids 51-57 adopt a similar conformation to that observed proximal Ub distal Ub S1 S2 S1' S1 S1 BIOTIN + + S2-S1 / S1' recognition / cleavage S2 /S1-S1' BIOTIN BIOTIN cleavage direction S1 S2 + S2 /S1-S1' BIOTIN S1' Ub-Lys48 and S2 Ub-Gly75 indicating minimal contacts to SARS PLpro.
