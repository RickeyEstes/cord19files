Each country had case-reporting policies and procedures that changed over time. During the observational period, mobile teams investigated 22 reports of SARS cases in 20 hospitals (1, 5, and 14 hospitals in Lao PDR, Taiwan, and Thailand, respectively). These 20 hospitals identified 27% of the total patients reported and represented 14% of the total hospitals reporting SARS cases to the 3 national health departments during the observational period. Ninety percent of the hospitals visited were located in urban areas. Mobile teams found that hospital staff and administrators generally appreciated the opportunity to review SARS safety practices with an expert team and welcomed suggestions on how to improve the protection of hospital staff. Of the 22 reported patients, 10 (45%) subsequently met the WHO case definition of probable SARS, 15 and 12 (55%) were found to have a diagnosis other than SARS. Selected infection control practices observed by mobile team visits are summarized in Table 2 .
