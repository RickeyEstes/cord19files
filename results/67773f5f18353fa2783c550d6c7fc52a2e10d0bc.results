To test the effectiveness of our new method, we employ it to different datasets, which include mammalian mitochondrial genomes, virus, and bacteria genomes. Some datasets are small sized and others are medium sized. The length of sequences ranges from ten thousands to several millions base pairs. For each dataset, using our method the multiple encoding vectors of its genetic sequences are calculated. To verify the efficiency of our algorithms, the FFP method is used to compare. We use MEGA to draw the phylogeny of datasets for the two methods. Unlike FFP which applies Jensen-Shannon Divergence to compute the pairwise distance between any two vectors, our new method use Euclidean distance. In the process of using FFP method, we choose k to be the minimum integer of log 4 (n), i.e. k = floor(log 4 (n)) (n is the minimum length of sequences studied). From the results we can see the efficiency of our new method is better than FFP on these datasets. Phylogeny of mammals. The first benchmark dataset contains 41 mammalian complete mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) with about 16500 base pairs. In these mammals, the structure of mtDNA is circular and double-stranded. One strand of each mtDNA has rich guanine referred to as the heavy strand and the other strand includes rich cytosine referred to as the light strand. In our study, the heavy strands of mtDNA are chosen. These sequences are not highly conserved and have a fast mutation rate 22 . Using our proposed method along with UPGMA algorithm, the phylogenetic tree of 41 mitochondrial genomes is constructed. As displayed in Fig. 1 , the 41 species are correctly grouped into 8 clusters: Primates (red), Cetacea (green), Artiodactyla (pink), Perissodactyla (light green), Rodentia (black), Lagomorpha (dark red), Carnivore (blue), and Erinaceomorpha (grey). According to the FFP method, length of substrings is chosen to be 7 and thus the phylogeny of the 41 species is obtained. The phylogenetic tree is provided in the supplementary file. As displayed in Fig. S1 , the 8 clusters are not classified well. The four species in Perissodactyla are improperly clustered into two clades. Indus River Dolphin from Cetacea is separated from other species from Cetacea. The Carnivore, Primates and Artiodactyla clades are all mistakenly divided into more than one group. Obviously, for this dataset our new method gets a greater result. 23 . Influenza A viruses are single-stranded, negative-sense, segmented RNA viruses. The genome of flu virus contains around 13500 nucleotides and is divided into 8 segments. The subtypes of Influenza A viruses are classified according to an H number for the type of hemagglutinin (H) and an N number for the type of neuraminidase (N) in viral surfaces 24 . The viruses have 18 different H serotypes (H1-H18) and 11 different N (N1-N11) serotypes. For instance, the recently appearing H7N3 is an Influenza A strain with a type 7 hemagglutinin (H) and a type 3 neuraminidase (N). The several subtypes of Influenza A viruses are able to infect many species including wild birds, swines, dogs, horses, and even humans. It is known that H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 subtypes can circulate among humans. In this study, we utilize Segment 6 gene encoding N (neuraminidase) of Influenza A virus to perform phylogenetic analysis. Using our method, the 38 flu viruses are correctly clustered into five groups as show in Fig. 2 . Our result is consistent with previous study 25 . According to the FFP method, the choice for length of k-mer of these viruses is 5 and their phylogenetic tree is constructed. As shown in Fig. S2 (in the supplementary file), however, some of the H1N1 viruses and some H5N1 viruses are placed together. Therefor, on this dataset our method is also superior than FFP.
