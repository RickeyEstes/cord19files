Global host cellular protein responses to SFTSV infection revealed by quantitative proteomic analysis. Before quantitative proteomic analysis, the growth kinetics of SFTSV in HEK 293 cells was monitored by measuring viral titer. Briefly, HEK 293 cells were infected with SFTSV at a multiplicity of infectivity (MOI) of 5, and the viral titers were measured with endpoint dilution assays (EPDAs). As shown in Fig. 1A , the replication rate of SFTSV increased over the time from 6 to 48 h postinfection (p.i.), while after 48 h p.i., the replication of SFTSV entered into stationary phase. The highest virus titer could reach ϳ1 ϫ 10 8 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID 50 )/cell at 48 h p.i., which is consistent with a recent report (7) . An MTT [3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] assay showed that SFTSV had no significant effect on cell viability before 48 h p.i. (Fig. 1B) . Therefore, samples collected at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h p.i. were used for iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis. As illustrated in Fig. 1C , the extracted proteins from SFTSV-infected or mock-infected cells were subjected to trypsin digestion and further labeled with different iTRAQ reagents. The peptides were then mixed at a ratio of 1 and subjected to strong cation exchange chromatography fractionation and liquid chromatography MS/MS (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Three independent biological replicates were performed at all four time points. As a result, a total of 5,606 host proteins were quantified (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). The ratio distributions of all quantified proteins were profiled (Fig. 1D ). Among the identified host proteins, 25 were upregulated and 33 were downregulated at 6 h p.i., 23 were upregulated and 34 were downregulated at 12 h p.i., 26 were upregulated and 37 were downregulated at 24 h p.i., and 282 were upregulated and 19 were downregulated at 48 h p.i. Differentially expressed proteins were significantly enriched at 48 h p.i., suggesting that SFTSV replication had a profound impact on host cells at this time point. Further examination of these proteins indicated that 26 host proteins were differentially regulated at two time points. Seven host proteins were differentially regulated at three time points, including cytochrome c oxidase assembly protein COX16 homolog (COX16), FUN14 domain-containing protein 1 (FUNDC1), E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM21 (TRIM21), vacuolar protein sortingassociated protein 13D (VPS13D), endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP (GRP78), basement membrane-specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan core protein (HSPG2), and zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 7A (ZBTB7A), while fibronectin (FN1) was upregulated at all four time points (Table S2 ). To find out the possible relationship between virus infection with host cellular responses, we further determined virus infection ratio and the expression patterns of the major viral proteins (the nucleocapsid protein [NP] and the glycoprotein [GP]). Approximately 49.98, 94.37, 99.96, and 100% cells were infected (Fig. 1E , gray columns), and approximately 3-, 7-, 8-, and 10-fold increases occurred in the NP and GP protein levels (Fig. 1E , blue and red lines) at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h p.i., respectively. Therefore, compared to the kinetics of virus infection and viral protein expression, the host protein changes to SFTSV infection seemed to be delayed and modest. To validate our MS data, quantitative real-time-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis to determine the transcription levels of eight randomly selected host proteins was performed. Although the fold changes quantified by quantitative RT-PCR and MS were not identical, their change tendencies were similar. As shown in Fig. 1F , quantitative RT-PCR data indicated that genes encoding FN1, Golgi integral membrane protein 4 (GOLIM), transcription factor AP-1 (JUN), E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF25 (RNF25), transcriptional enhancer factor TEF-1 (TEAD1), TSC22 domain family protein 4 (TSC22D4), and vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein A (VAPA) were upregulated, whereas the gene encoding serine/threonine-protein kinase RIO2 (RIOK2) was first downregulated and then recovered as a result of SFTSV infection, which was consistent with our MS data (Table S1) . To determine which biological processes were regulated during the SFTSV infection process, gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 2 , at 6 h p.i., only the process "response to wounding" was overrepresented ( Fig. 2A) , while at 12 h p.i., "positive regulation of fibroblast proliferation," "protein retention in Golgi apparatus," and "innate immune response" were overrepresented (Fig. 2B ). At 24 h p.i., five biological processes were found to be upregulated and two of them ("ATF6-mediated unfold protein response" and "positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress") belong to ER stress response (Fig. 2C ). More biological processes were overrepresented at 48 h p.i., and again the "response to endoplasmic reticulum stress" was upregulated and six hits from the category were significantly enriched (Fig. 2D) . These data revealed a prominent cluster of upregulated host genes linked to ER stress and highlighted that ER stress response was triggered by SFTSV infection. Since the role of the UPR in bunyavirus life cycle has not been thoroughly depicted, we therefore decided to perform an in-depth analysis on this biological process. UPR is activated by SFTSV infection. One consequence of activating ER stress is the upregulation of genes involved in protein folding, such as ER chaperones, as represented by GRP78 and glucose related protein 94 (GRP94), and isomerases, including protein disulfide isomerase A3 and A4 (PDIA3 and PDIA4). Therefore, Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR analyses were performed to determine whether these ER chaperones were regulated during SFTSV infection. As shown in Fig. 3A , intracellular protein levels of GRP78 were upregulated at 12, 24, and 48 h p.i., while as a control the intracellular protein levels of a cytosolic chaperone, HSP90AB1, was not upregulated. We further found that mRNA levels of GRP78/GRP94, as well as PDIA3/PDIA4, increased after SFTSV infection (Fig. 3B ), confirming that ER stress was activated by SFTSV infection in HEK 293 cells. To better reflect the situation of virus infection in vivo, mouse peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were infected with SFTSV at an MOI of 5 and subjected to quantitative RT-PCR analysis. We found that the intracellular mRNA levels of GRP78, GRP94, PDIA3, and PDIA4 were elevated significantly in SFTSV-infected PBMCs, indicating that the ER stress response was activated as a result of SFTSV infection in PBMCs (Fig. 3B ). UPR is a cellular adaptive response for restoring ER homeostasis in response to ER stress (11) . Here, we detected the effects of SFTSV infection on three branches of the UPR, including the PERK, ATF6, and IRE1 pathways. PERK is an ER-localized kinase whose lumenal domain senses an excess of unfolded proteins that enter the ER (26). Here, The relative mRNA levels of the indicated proteins were measured using quantitative RT-PCR. GAPDH, tubulin, and actin were chosen as internal controls. Intracellular RNA levels at each time point of SFTSV infection were normalized to those in the mock-infected cells. All experiments were performed at least three times, and values represent means Ϯ the SDs from three replicates. *, P Ͻ 0.05; **, P Ͻ 0.01 (Student t test). (C) SFTSV-infected HEK 293 cells were collected at the indicated time intervals, and total proteins were extracted and subjected to Western blot analysis for ATF6 p90, phos-eIF2␣ (Ser51), total eIF2␣, PERK, Gn, and the internal control actin. Red arrow, phosphorylated PERK; purple arrow, PERK. (D) RNA samples were also analyzed for spliced XBP1 mRNA by using reverse transcription-PCR. The intensity of protein band was measured by ImageJ_v1.8.0. For each time point, the protein intensity was first normalized to actin and then normalized to the corresponding mock group. Western blot analysis of HEK 293 cell extracts indicated PERK was phosphorylated at 48 h p.i. in SFTSV-infected cells (Fig. 3C) , suggesting that PERK was activated. Activated PERK will further phosphorylate the ␣ subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2␣) and thus attenuate global protein synthesis. We therefore investigated the phosphorylation state of eIF2␣ during SFTSV infection over a 48-h time course and found a significant increase in the levels of phosphorylated eIF2␣, but not of the total eIF2␣ proteins, at 48 h p.i. in SFTSV-infected cells compared to the mock-infected group (Fig.  3C) , suggesting that the PERK pathway is activated upon SFTSV infection. Next, the activation of the ATF6 signaling pathway during SFTSV infection was examined. ATF6 is constitutively expressed as a 90-kDa protein (namely, ATF6 p90), and upon ER stress the ATF6 is cleaved to an N-terminal 50-kDa protein (namely, ATF6 p50). Western blot analysis showed that ATF6 was decreased at 48 h p.i. (Fig. 3C) , suggesting that the ATF6 signaling pathway was activated at the late phase of SFTSV infection. Viral GP was used to indicate successful infection (Fig. 3C) . Finally, the activation of the IRE1-XBP1 pathway was examined. Activation of IRE1 causes posttranscriptional cleavage of the XBP1 mRNA (unspliced XBP1) that produces the spliced form of XBP1 mRNA, which encodes the transcriptionally active form of the XBP1 gene. Similarly, HEK 293 cells were mock treated or infected with SFTSV over a 48-h time course. Both unspliced XBP1 and spliced XBP1 were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR. As shown in Fig. 3D , spliced XBP1 was detected at 24 and 48 h p.i. in SFTSV-infected cells but not in mock-infected cells, suggesting that the IRE1 pathway was also activated by SFTSV at these time points. These results demonstrated that SFTSV infection could activate all three classical branches of the UPR. PERK and ATF6 signaling pathways play critical roles in SFTSV infection processes. The upregulation of the UPR in SFTSV-infected cells implied that the UPR might play a role in viral replication. Thus, we explored the roles of three branches of the UPR in the SFTSV replication process by RNA interference (RNAi). Briefly, HEK 293 cells were transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting PERK, ATF6, and XBP1, or scrambled siRNA, and the knockdown efficiency was detected at 24 h posttransfection (p.t.) by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 4A ). All siRNAs used could reduce intracellular mRNA levels of XBP1, ATF6, and PERK significantly without cytopathic effects (CPE) (Fig. 4A and B). At 24 h after siRNA transfection, the cells were infected with SFTSV at an MOI of 1 and were also collected at 48 h p.i. Quantitative RT-PCR results showed that the intracellular levels of viral RNA (L and M segment) were lower in ATF6 or PERK knockdown cells but not in XBP1 knockdown cells (Fig. 4C) , indicating that depletion of ATF6 or PERK inhibited SFTSV replication. The supernatant was also collected at 48 h p.i., and viral titers were determined. As shown in Fig. 4D , SFTSV titers were significantly decreased in ATF6 or PERK knockdown cells but not in XBP-1 silenced cells, a finding similar to the result of Fig. 4C . These results indicated that two of the three main branches of the UPR, the ATF6 and PERK pathways, facilitated SFTSV infection process. Expression of SFTSV GP upregulates the UPR. To explore how SFTSV triggers the UPR, the effect of expression of individual SFTSV proteins on the UPR was examined. HEK 293 cells were transfected with empty vector, or vectors expressing different SFTSV proteins or GFP as a control. At 48 h p.t., the expression of viral proteins and GFP in HEK 293 cells was confirmed by Western blot analyses (Fig. 5A) . Then, the intracellular protein levels of GRP78 and GRP94 were further determined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5A , GRP78 and GRP94 increased only in cells expressing GP (the full-length glycoprotein, containing both Gn and Gc) or cells treated with tunicamycin (Tm), a reported inducer of the UPR, but not in cells expressing other viral proteins, including NP, NSs, and RdRP, or the control GFP. We also detected intracellular mRNA levels of GRP78 and GRP94 in HEK 293 cells by quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 5B , the intracellular mRNA levels of GRP78 and GRP94 were significantly elevated in GP-expressing cells. We further found that compared to other viral proteins or empty vector control, GP could activate the expression of GRP78 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C) . These results suggested that the SFTSV GP alone can activate the UPR. PERK and ATF6 signaling pathways are important for maintaining intracellular levels of GP. We further investigated the roles of the three major UPR signaling pathways in determining the expression levels of individual viral proteins. In the case of SFTSV infection, intracellular expression levels of NP, NSs, RdRP, and GP were lower in PERK or ATF6 knockdown cells but not in XBP1 knockdown cells (Fig. 6A) , which was in accordance with the above results that knockdown of ATF6 or PERK led to reduced virus replication and production ( Fig. 4C and D) . Moreover, the intracellular protein levels of GP decreased much more significantly than those of other viral proteins when the ATF6 or PERK signaling pathways were impaired (Fig. 6A) , suggesting that GP was specifically downregulated. To further investigate the impact of the ATF6 and PERK pathways on GP expression, HEK 293 cells were first transfected with target siRNAs or scrambled siRNA and then transfected with plasmids expressing GP or NSs as a control at 24 h post-siRNA transfection. At 48 h post-plasmid transfection, HEK 293 cells were collected, and the intracellular levels of the two viral proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 6B , knockdown of ATF6 or PERK resulted in decreased protein levels of intracellular GP but not of NSs. In contrast, neither GP nor NSs expression was influenced by the knockdown of XBP1. This result further confirmed that the proper expression of GP either with or without SFTSV infection is dependent on the ATF6 and PERK pathways. UPR signaling is also activated by infection with other closely related phleboviruses. We next explored whether activation of the UPR is a unique feature for SFTSV infection or a common mechanism shared by some genetically closely related phlebo- viruses. As mentioned earlier, HRTV and GTV are two newly identified tickborne phleboviruses and are phylogenetically closely related to SFTSV (5, 7) . We investigated the UPR responses in HEK 293 cells, which are also permissive to both HRTV and GTV infection (Fig. 7A) (7) . The infection rates represented by the expression of NP (Fig. 7A ) and the virus titers at different time points (Fig. 7B) showed that among the three viruses, the infectivity of GTV is the highest, while the infectivity of HRTV is the lowest in HEK 293 cells (P Ͻ 0.001). In GTV-infected HEK 293 cells, GRP78 was upregulated, suggesting that the UPR was activated (Fig. 7C) . We found that decrease of ATF6 p90 protein (Fig. 7C) and splicing of XBP1 mRNA began at 12 h p.i. (Fig. 7E) , while the phosphorylation level of eIF2␣ protein increased obviously at 48 h p.i. (Fig. 7C) , indicating that GTV can activate all three branches of the UPR. Similarly, in HRTVinfected HEK 293 cells, an increase in phosphorylation level of eIF2a protein began to be detected at 48 h p.i., while a decrease in ATF6 p90 protein began to be detected at 24 h p.i. (Fig. 7D) , and a weak increase in the spliced XBP1 mRNA was detected at 12 h p.i. (Fig. 7F) , suggesting that infection of HRTV could also activate the three branches of the UPR. These data suggest that activation of the UPR may represent a common feature for phleboviruses, at least for SFTSV-related virus groups.
