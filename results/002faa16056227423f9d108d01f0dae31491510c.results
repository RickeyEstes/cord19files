In 2005, the influenza vaccination rate for all employees was 66.4% (versus 56.8% in 2004, odds ratio (OR) 1.50 with 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-1.62), the highest reported influenza vaccination rate to date for employees of a tertiary hospital in Singapore. The mobile vaccination team reached out to 3 distantly located departments. The same-service area vaccination arrangements were organized for 4 service areas in the hospital: the main radiology area, operating theatres, specialist outpatient clinics, and the emergency department area. Overall, on-site arrangements were available to approximately 1 in 4 (or 23.9%) employees in 2005. In 2005, the reporting rate of all employees at onsite arrangements was 86.9% (versus 70.4% at vaccination booths, OR 2.77 with 95% CI 2.29-3.37). Among the employees who reported for vaccination, influenza vaccination rate was significantly higher (97.0%) at on-site arrangements than at the vaccination booths (61.2%) (P , .001). Employees who attended on-site arrangements were approximately 20 times more likely to be vaccinated than employees who attended the vaccination booths (Table 1) .
