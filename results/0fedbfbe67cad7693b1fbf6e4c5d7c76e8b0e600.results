During admission, 30 clinical specimens (seven oropharyngeal swabs, 11 nasal swabs, and 12 serum samples) were collected from 13 patients with pneumonia and risk factors associated with MERS-CoV infection, including history of travel to the Middle East <14 days before illness. There was no history of contact with animals or sick people during their visit. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are presented in Table 1 . The numbers of male and female patients were similar (male-tofemale ratio, 7:6), and the median age of all patients was 61 years. All patients were diagnosed with pneumonia, confirmed by chest X-ray and categorized in the low-severity pneumonia risk group based on the British Thoracic Society guidelines (NICE, 2019). The duration of hospital stay varied between 2 and 10 days, with an average duration of 5.8 days. The patients were placed in isolation rooms dedicated for airborne infectious diseases. All patients recovered fully. A total of 18 respiratory clinical specimens that tested negative for MERS-CoV (by the Indonesian Ministry of Health) were retrospectively tested for 12 respiratory panels. In addition, 12 serum samples were tested for alphavirus and flavivirus to exclude the possibility of endemic viral infection. The coronavirus panel did not detect any MERS-CoV in any of the respiratory specimens, confirming the Indonesian Ministry of Health results. In this study, sequences of nine viral pathogens were detected in seven patients: four with single infections and three with multiple infections (Table 2 ). In patient ID MER004 072015, a co-infection of enterovirus and flavivirus was detected from nasal swab and serum, respectively. Nucleotide comparison of 357 nucleotides of the polyprotein gene using BLAST showed 99% similarity with enterovirus D68; for the flavivirus, 274 bases of the NS5 gene showed 98% similarity with dengue virus type 3. In patient ID MER002 092016, both herpesvirus and coronavirus were detected Serum À À À À À À À À À À À À À
