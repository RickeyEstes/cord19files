Proteins of 27.7 and 20 kDa are synthesized in vitro from transcripts of gene 3b The predicted 244-aa polypeptide product of gene 3b from TGEV, Purdue strain, is largely hydrophobic (114 aa are hydrophobic) and has an acidic C-terminus (8 of 16 aa are aspartic or glutamic acid) and potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites at aa 17, 22, and 132 (Figs. 2, A and B) . A Kyte and Doolittle (1982) hydropathy analysis using a window of 20 aa shows a clustering of hydrophobic aa at positions 1-20, yielding properties of a potential signal sequence for membrane insertion, and at positions 75-100, yielding properties of a potential transmembrane domain (Engelman et al., 1986; von Heijne, 1983) (Figs. 2, A and B) . To examine the properties of the protein, gene 3b was subcloned into a pGEM-4z vector under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and synthetic transcripts from pORF2 DNA linearized at the EcoRI site (Fig. 3) were translated in vitro. A major protein product of 27.7 kDa and a minor product of 20 kDa were routinely observed when transcripts were translated in either wheat germ lysate (Fig. 4A , lane 2) or rabbit reticulocyte lysate (data not shown). At no time were products of the size expected from gene 4 (9.2 kDa; Godet et al., 1992) or from the truncated M gene (11 kDa; Kapke et al., 1988b) observed. The 27.7-kDa protein is the presumed fulllength product of gene 3b. The 20-kDa protein was concluded on the basis of the following observations to be an N-terminally truncated product of gene 3b resulting from either initiation of translation at methionine position 80, 86, or 92 or a proteolytic cleavage at a site downstream of aa 75: (1) the 20-kDa protein was synthesized from transcripts of plasmid pORF2 linearized with NsiI or AvrII, which cut close to the 3Ј end of gene 3b, but not with BsrGI or NdeI, which cut within gene 3b ( Fig. 3 and data not shown). (2) The 27.7-kDa protein, but not the 20-kDa protein, was radiolabeled with 35 S-cysteine, which occurs only at position 75 (Fig. 2B) . (3) The 20-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated with 27.7-kDa proteinspecific antiserum (described below). No differences in the migration rates of either the 27.7-or 20-kDa species were observed when electrophoresis was carried out in the absence of ␤-mercaptoethanol, indicating that neither species contained intramolecular disulfide linkages or were themselves disulfide-linked multimeric forms (data not shown).
