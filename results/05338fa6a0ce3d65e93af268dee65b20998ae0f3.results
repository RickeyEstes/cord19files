All the 20 faecal samples characterised previously as FCoV-like CCoVs were recognised by the primer pair UCD1F Á/UCD1R, yielding an amplicon of the expected size of 502 bp. About 80% (3347 nucleotides) of the ORF encoding for the S protein of strain Elmo/02 was determined. Using the ORF2 of strain UCD1 as a reference sequence, the fragment sequences between nt 868 and 4205 and between aa 300 and 1401 may be approximately localised. The highest nucleotide identity was to FCoV type I strains KU-2, UCD1 and Black (Â/77%), whereas identity to FCoVs type II and CCoVs was about 61%. Comparison of the inferred amino acid sequences revealed 80.81 Á/81.76% identity to FCoVs type I, 53.88 Á/54.31% to FCoVs type II and 54.31% to reference CCoV strains (Table 2 ). In accordance with previous observations, the sequence of the S protein was much more conserved at the C-terminus rather than at the Nterminus. For instance, amino acid identity to the bestmatching sequence (strain KU-2) ranged from 73.39 to 88.4% and to strain Insavc-1 from 41.4 to 65.51% in the N-and C-terminus, respectively. The inferred amino acid sequence of the S protein of strain Elmo/02 is shown in Fig. 2 . Similar to other coronaviruses, there were several potential N-glycosilation sites, Asn Á/X Á/Ser (NXS) or Asn Á/X Á/Thr (NXT). Most of the glycosilation sites were conserved between strain Elmo/02 and feline/CCoVs, in particular with respect to the most closely related FCoVs type I. Interestingly, a potential cleavage site, the stretch of basic amino acids, Arg Á/Arg Á/Ala Á/Arg Á/Arg (RRARR), was found. The basic stretch is about at the same position as in the S protein of group II and group III coronaviruses, but it is absent in the S protein of all the other group I coronaviruses. Parsimony analysis on the S protein of group I coronaviruses revealed that strain Elmo/02 is much more related to FCoVs type I rather than to typical CCoVs. Conversely, typical CCoVs tightly segregate with FCoVs type II and the porcine coronaviruses TGEV and PRCoV (Fig. 3) . The new pair of primers, V3F Á/V3R, specific for strain Elmo/02, successfully amplified all the 20 samples tested, yielding an expected PCR product of 744 bp. The sequence of the V3F Á/V3R amplicon of four strains representative of different geographical areas was determined, revealing a nucleotide variability of 4Á/8%.
