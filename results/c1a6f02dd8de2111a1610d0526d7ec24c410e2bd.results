250/300 Patients suspected clinically of DENV infection, were confirmed as acute DENV infection by detection of the NS1 Ag, anti-IgM, conventional RT-PCR, and the real-time RT-PCR either alone or in combinations. 138/250 Patients were positive by NS1 Ag alone. 92 out of the remaining 112 patients were positive only for anti-Dengue IgM and IgG antibodies. NS1 serotype specific RT-PCR assay was positive in 140/250 patients, NS1 serotype specific RT-PCR assay detected 2 patients that were negative for NS1 Ag by ELISA test. RT-LAMP assay detected 8 additional patients that were negative for NS1 Ag by ELISA and NS1 RT-PCR assay. 10/250 patients were identified as past DENV infection as dengue IgG antibodies alone were tested positive among them (Table 2) .
