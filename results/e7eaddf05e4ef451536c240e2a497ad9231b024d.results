In total, 309 randomly selected dairy farmers were approached by telephone. Of these, 38 were not interested and 9 could not be contacted despite several attempts. Another 142 herds had none or only one calf aged between 1 and 21 days and therefore were excluded. In 12 herds, the criteria for age or minimum number of two calves per herd at the time of actual visiting were not met. Thus, 424 calves investigated in 108 herds were used for the analyses with 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 calves tested in 21, 21, 28, 21 and 17 herds, respectively. There were 173 (41%) calves tested in their first week of age, 153 (36%) in their second week and 98 (23%) in their third week of age. Herd size and regional distribution of the non-participating herds were not statistically different from the participating herds. One of the included herds had an organic management while all other herds were managed conventionally.
