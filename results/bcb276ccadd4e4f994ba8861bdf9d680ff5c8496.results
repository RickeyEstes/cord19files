All animals survived the experimental protocol. In GM group, biochemical profiles showed a remarkable increase in blood uric acid, urea, and creatinine levels. In addition, histopathologic studies revealed severe ATN, congestion, and hyaline casts, verifying GM-induced nephrotoxicity. Renal functions such as blood uric acid, urea, and creatinine concentrations of rats subjected to licorice treatment after GM showed a marked recovery as compared with the GM-treated rats (P , .001 for all). Blood uric acid, urea, and creatinine concentrations were also significantly decreased in licorice 1 GM treatment group as compared with the GM-treated rats (P ,.001 for all). Renal functional parameters are shown in Table 1 . TAC and GSH levels in renal tissue and plasma were lower in GM treatment group than those in control-and licorice-treated GM groups, and these were statistically significant (P , .001 for all). TAC and GSH levels in plasma were significantly higher in the licorice-treated GM group (P ,.001 for both) and also licorice 1 GM treatment group than those in the GM-treated group (P , .001 and P , .01, respectively). TPO and LPO levels of plasma and renal tissue were significantly higher in the GM-treated group than those in the licorice-treated GM group (P , .001 and P , .01, respectively). TPO and LPO levels of plasma and renal tissue were also significantly higher in the GM-treated group than those in the licorice 1 GM group ( P , .05 and P , .01; P , .05 and P , .001, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences between the licorice treatment group and control group with regard to the TPO and LPO levels (P . .05). The results are summarized in Tables 2 and 3 and shown in Figs. 1 and 2. In groups 1 and 2, the results of the histopathological examinations of the renal tissues were normal (Fig. 3) . Histopathological examination of the tissues in group 3 revealed severe lesions (fourth degree of necrosis) such as tubular necrosis, proximal tubular epithelium necrosis (no nuclei, intense eosinophilic homogeneous cytoplasm, but preserved shape), and damage characterized by a loss of brush border, no nuclei, intense eosinophilic homogeneous cytoplasm, lumen dilatation or collapse, and cellular detachment from tubular basement membranes observed in the kidney of the rats (Fig. 4) . Co-treatment of licorice with GM (group 4) considerably decreased these signs of ATN compared with only GM-treated group (group 3) (Fig. 5) . Also, treatment of the GMtreated group with licorice (group 5) reduced the morphological alterations associated with nephrotoxicity of GM significantly to the normal (Fig. 3 ).
