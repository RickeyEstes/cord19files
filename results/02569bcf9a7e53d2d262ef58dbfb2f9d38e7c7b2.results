Isolation and characterization of recombinants containing sequences derived from the3' end of the FIPV genome The preparation of a cDNA library of FIPV genomic RNA in pUC9 was described previously (de Groot etaL, 1987b) . Recombinants containing sequences derived from the 3' end of the FIPV genome were isolated by colony hybridization with an RNA fraction enriched for RNA 6 (fraction 28, de Groot et aL, 1987a) . The plasmids pB12, pC 12, and pE7 were selected for sequence analysis. In Fig. 1 the sequence strategy is outlined. Three major ORFs were identified (Fig. 1) . The 5'-most ORF could be identified as the 3' end of the FIPV nucleocapsid gene, the sequence of which was 64% identical to the corresponding TGEV sequence (not shown). Figure 2 shows the nucleotide sequence and the predicted amino acid sequences of the region downstream of the N gene. As shown in Fig. 1 , this sequence was determined on both strands and on two independent cDNA clones, except for the 3'-most 68 nucleotides. ORF-1 (positions 49 to 375) predicts a protein of 108 residues. In the genomic sequence this ORF overlaps with the N gene. The first AUG codon (position 49) is followed by the sequence AACTAAAC; a second AUG codon is present at position 70 (Fig. 2 ). ORF-2 (positions 380 to 1000) could encode a polypeptide of 206 residues. Comparison with the 3' end of the TGEV genome Figure 3a shows a dot matrix comparison of the 3' end of the FIPV and TGEV genomes (Kapke and Brian, 1986) . The highest sequence similarity (98.5%) was found in the 3' noncoding regions. ORF-1 is 78% identical to the TGEV ORF-X3 but contains 69 nucleotides in addition (indicated by a dashed line in Fig. 2 ). The AUG start codon of ORF-X3 corresponds to the second AUG codon of ORF-1. A 624-nucleotide segment positions 376-1000)immediately downstream of ORF-1 is absent in the TGEV sequence. Strikingly, this segment corresponds exactly to ORF-2. A schematic alignment of the TGEV and FIPV sequences is shown in Fig. 3b . None of the recombinants isolated from our cDNA library contained the poly(A) tail, probably because the cDNA synthesis was randomly primed by calf thymus DNA pentamers (de Groot et aL, 1987b) . If aligned to the TGEV sequence, the most 3' located clone, E7, ends just one nucleotide upstream of the poly(A) tail. Localization of the 5' end of the presumptive RNA body of RNA 6 To determine the 5' end of RNA 6, we used S1 nuclease analysis. An M13-recombinant phage containing the virus-sense strand of the 950:bp PstI-Taql fragment ( Fig. 1) served as a template to prepare a uniformly labeled probe. This probe was hybridized to sucrose-gradient purifie d RNA 6, followed by Sl nuclease digestion. A fragment of 514 nucleotides was protected (Fig. 4a ). The precise length was determined in a sequencing gel (Fig. 4b ). This indicates that the 5' end of the RNA 6 body maps at position 60, immediately upstream of the AACTAAAC box. Consequently, the AUG codon at position 49 is not present in RNA 6. Furthermore, these results suggest that the body of RNA 6 has a length of 1212 nucleotides, provided that there are no additional insertions. Assuming an RNA leader sequence of 60-70 nucleotides (Spaan et al., 1983; Lai eta/., 1984; Brown eta/., 1984) and a poly(A) tail of about 100 nucleotides we arrive at a predicted length of approximately 1400 nucleotides. Previously, RNA 6 was estimated to be 1600 nucleotides (de Groot et aL, 1987a) . By using gels with a better resolution in this MW range, we have now measured a length of about 1450 nucle0tides (not shown). Since the AACTAAAC box preceding ORF-1 apparently is used as/a signal for initiation of transcription, we expected th,ls also to be the case for the AAC-TAAAC sequence preceding the TGEV ORF-X3. Figure  5 shows that in a Northern blot of oligo (dT)-selected RNAs of TGEV-infected cells, an RNA of about 700 nu- cleotides can be detected by cross-hybridization with the 1600-bp Pstl fragment of clone B12.
