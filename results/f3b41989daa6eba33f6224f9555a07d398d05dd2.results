Potential interaction partners of the cytoplasmic domain of TGEV-S were identified using a screening method involving a GFP Trap pull down assay followed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. In addition to the GFP fusion protein three clear bands were visible. These detected bands were identified by mass spectrometry. The first band at around 70 kDa contained fragments that matched to heat shock 70 kDa protein 1A and 8. Fragments of the second band at around 55 kDa referred to the pro-alpha chain of collagen type I, although this size did not fit to the expected one for COL1A1. A band at around 50 kDa matched to the group of tubulin beta chains (TUBB1, TUBB2A, TUBB2B, TUBB3, TUBB4A, TUBB4B, TUBB5, TUBB6 and TUBB8). As representatives of tubulin beta chains the three genes TUBB2A, TUBB4A, and TUBB6 were chosen for further analysis. For comparison one gene encoding a tubulin alpha chain, TUBA4A, was enclosed in the study. The ORF's of the chosen genes were cloned and tagged with HA.
