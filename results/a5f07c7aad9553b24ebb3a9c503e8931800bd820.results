The patients characteristics revealed that, no significant difference was detected between group 1 (culture negative group) and group 2 patients (culture positive group) as regards age, sex, symptoms, signs, body temperature and final diagnosis ( Table 1) . Table 2 shows a significant increase in CRP levels and a highly significant increase in PCT levels in group 2 as compared to group 1 at initial diagnosis. No significant difference as regards white blood cell counts or blood gases was detected. Also no significant difference was detected as regards number of admitted patients, intensive care unit admission or admitted days between group 1 and group 2 patients as shown in Table 3 . Table 4 shows the number and the percentage of bacterial organisms that had been isolated from group 2 patients. In 11 patients with pneumonia, the Streptococcus pneumoniae, Morexella catarrhalis and Pseudomonas spp. were isolated. These bacteria were isolated from sputum of 5 cases (45.4%), from blood of 4 cases (36.4%) and from both of 2 cases (18.1%). In 10 patients with COPD, S. pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenza, Staphylococcus aureus and P. spp. were isolated. These bacteria were isolated from sputum of 4 cases (40%), from blood of 3 cases (30%) and from both of 3 cases (30%) while, S. pneumoiae, S. aureus, Pseudomonas spp. and M. catarrhalis were isolated from the 13 patients with bronchitis. These bacteria were isolated from sputum of 8 cases (61.5%), from blood of 4 cases (30.7%) and from both of one case (7.6%). Both blood and sputum cultures were negative in all cases that had acute exacerbation of asthma. Table 5 demonstrates the value of PCT and CRP in diagnosis of the lower respiratory tract bacterial infection, at a cutoff value >0.5 ng/ml, PCT gave a sensitivity of 94.1%, specificity of 88.4%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 91.4%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 92% and diagnostic efficiency of Table 6 shows a highly significant decrease in PCT and CRP levels in group 2 patients after antibiotic therapy. Also the white blood cell counts were significantly decreased as compared to pretreatment levels.
