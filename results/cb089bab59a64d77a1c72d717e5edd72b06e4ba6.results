Fifty-nine children were enrolled in the study ranging in age between one year and 16 years with a mean of 6.2 years. There were 35 females (59.3%). The BMI ranged from 12.9 to 49.4 kg/square meter with a mean of 17.4; 14 (23.7%) children were classified as either obese (eight) or overweight (six). Thirty-eight (62.7%) children underwent surgery for sleep disordered breathing (SDB), seven of whom developed complications of recurrent or chronic (ROC) otitis media and one with ROC tonsillitis. Twelve children underwent surgery for ROC tonsillitis alone. Four children underwent surgery for ROC adenoiditis with tonsillitis or ROC otitis media. A single patient underwent surgery for chronic adenoiditis. A total of 59 tonsils and 57 adenoids were excised. The mean weights of tonsils and adenoids were 6.7 and 2.0 g, respectively. Fifty-five tonsils and 57 adenoids were available for nucleic acid extraction. Viruses were detected in 39 of 55 tonsils (70.9%) compared to 54 of 57 (94.7%) adenoids, p < 0.001. Multiple viruses were detected in nine of 55 tonsils (16.3%) and 41 of 57 (71.9%) adenoids (p < 0.001). The number of detectable viruses in adenoids tended to decrease patient age increased (p ¼ 0.07, r ¼ -0.24) although a similar trend was not observed for tonsils (r ¼ 0.016, p ¼ 0.9). Table 1 lists the frequency of detection of each type of virus. Adenovirus was the most common overall, detected in 56 specimens, followed by EBV in 43, RV in 38, PIV in 22 and CoV in 14. AdV was also most commonly detected in adenoids at 71.4%, while EBV was the virus most often detected in tonsils at 40.0%. Coronavirus, InfV and hMPV were not detected in tonsils, whereas EV was not detected in adenoids. In four cases, it was not possible to distinguish EV from RV. Each virus identified in the present study was detected more often in the adenoid than tonsil with the exception of EBV; however, the differences were only statistically significant for adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus and coronavirus (Table 1) . Coronavirus, InfV, hMPV and PIV were only detected in adenoids and never in tonsils. When adenoviruses, coronaviruses and parainfluenza viruses were typed, some interesting distributions were observed. Among typable adenoviruses, twenty-eight (82.3%) were either type 1 or 2 ( Table 2) with similar frequency and distribution in obese and nonobese subjects. A recombinant adenovirus with a type 15/29 hexon gene and a type 9 fiber gene was identified in a 14 year old obese female. Interestingly, two other recombinant adenoviruses were detected in this population, as well as five samples for which the type could only be determined in either the hexon or fiber gene (but not both), making the definitive designation of type or recombinant not possible. Among the four types of coronavirus tested, OC43 accounted for 90%. Among the four types of parainfluenza virus tested, types 2e4 were detected equally while type 1 was undetected. The relationships between specific virus type or the number of different viruses and the degree of airway obstruction were also assessed. Brodsky scores and virus types are depicted in Table 3 . Sixteen of 22 (72.7%) EBV infected tonsils had scores of 3 or 4, p ¼ 0.03. While scores of 3 or 4 occurred with other virus groups, their numbers were relatively low in comparison to EBV, with the exception of adenovirus. The proportion of Brodsky scores of 3 or 4 were not statistically different than the proportion with scores of 1 or 2 for any virus group other than EBV. The number of virus types varied from 0 in 19 tonsils to 4 in 1 tonsil with a mode 1 for the entire group. The number of virus groups in tonsils was not significantly associated with the Brodsky score (p ¼ 0.49). The impact of viral infections on airway obstruction in adenoids was very different than that observed in tonsils. Four virus types, PIV, CoV, AdV and EBV were significantly associated with airway obstruction exceeding 50% ( Table 4 ). The proportion of airway scores greater than 50% varied from 80.9% for EBV, p < 0.001e94.4% for PIV, p < 0.001. The number of virus types varied from 0 in 3 adenoids to 7 in 1 adenoid with a mode of 2 for the entire group. As with tonsils, the number of virus types was not significantly associated with the percent of airway obstruction (p ¼ 0.22).
