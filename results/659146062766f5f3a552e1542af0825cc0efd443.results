Epidemiologic data and respiratory specimens were collected from 125 subjects (Table 1 ) with a median age of 51.5 years (range 25-86). Common underlying medical conditions reported included hypertension (22%), diabetes (14%), and heart disease (8%); 22% of those responding reported current smoking. Onset of symptoms ranged from September 20 to October 20, occurring prior to departure to KSA in five subjects. Most participants (89%) reported at least one of the following symptoms captured by the questionnaire: cough, sore throat, fever, nasal discharge, or difficulty breathing. Of those subjects responding, 31 (26% of 119) reported a history of contact with an ill person during the Hajj, and 36 (36% of 99) reported visiting a healthcare facility prior to enrollment, including 13 who reported having visited a healthcare facility in KSA. NP/OP swabs were obtained from 99 (79%) subjects; 26 (21%) subjects refused NP swabs and provided only OP swab specimens. Considering all specimen types, at least one virus was detected in 73 (58%) specimens, with 59 (47%) testing positive for rhino/enterovirus ( Table 2) . Rhino/enterovirus-positive subjects were more likely to present with difficulty breathing than subjects that tested negative for rhino/enterovirus (24% vs. 9%; p = 0.0258) ( Table 3) . Other viruses detected included common human coronavirus species (n = 16; 13%), influenza A (n = 4, all H3N2; 3%) or B (n = 2; 2%), parainfluenza viruses types 3 (n = 2; 2%) and 1 (n = 1; 1%), RSV (n = 1; 1%), and adenovirus (n = 1; 1%) ( Table 2) . MERS-CoV was not detected in any subject, and none of the bacterial pathogens tested (Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila) were detected. Viral co-detections were observed in 13 (10%) of participants, all of which were rhino/enterovirus-positive. Except for one specimen in which parainfluenza type 1 was identified, panviral family/genus PCR did not add additional clinically relevant results beyond what was already detected by multi-pathogen array cards. There were no significant differences in detection of any single pathogen between NP/OP and OP-only specimens (data not shown). Among the 28 (22%) participants enrolled at hospitals, three were admitted, one requiring ICU admission. The subject that required ICU admission was positive for rhino/enterovirus and parainfluenza type 3; the other two admitted cases were rhino/enterovirus-positive and influenza A/H3N2-positive, respectively. No deaths were reported.
