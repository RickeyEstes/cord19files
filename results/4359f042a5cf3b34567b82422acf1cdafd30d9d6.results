Cloning of ferret IFN-c cDNA and the expression of His 6 -,V5-tagged recombinant IFN-c in COS-7 transfectant cells A cDNA encoding ferret IFN-g was cloned from isolated total RNA derived from mitogen-stimulated ferret PBMCs as described in the materials and methods. The cDNA sequence and predicted amino acid sequence for ferret IFN-g are depicted in Figure 1A . Amino acid sequence homology to the predicted ferret IFN-g was highest in the Eurasian badger (Meles meles) (97%), followed by the canine (86%) and feline (83%) sequences ( Figure 1B) . The homology of ferret IFN-g to human and mouse IFN-g was 63% and 48%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis using BLAST (see Figure 1C ) indicates that closest orthologue of ferret IFN-g is that of the badger. The ferret IFN-g cDNA was subcloned into the His 6 -,V5-fusion protein expression vector and subsequently transfected into COS-7 cells to produce recombinant IFN-g protein. Ferret IFN-g protein was secreted from the COS-7 transfectants (fIFNg-COS-7) and migrated as a 35-45 kDa band when subjected to immunoblotting experiments using a V5-specific antibody (Figure 2 ). Since the estimated molecular weight of ferret IFN-g is 17 kDa as the monomer, the band detected in Coomassie blue staining and immunoblotting is consistent with the dimerized form of IFN-g.
