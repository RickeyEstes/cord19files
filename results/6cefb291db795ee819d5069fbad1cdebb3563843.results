We followed 119 children from 1 February 2006 to 28 April 2008 for a total of 115.3 child years. On a monthly basis, the percentage of children enrolled averaged 56% (range 35-71%). Children were followed for an average of 12 months (range 11 days to 2.2 years). The mean age at enrollment was 10.4 months (range 1.6-24.9 months), with 56 (47%) females. Racial background included 57 (48%) Caucasians, 38 (32%) African Americans, and 4 (4%) Asians. Siblings were present in 67 (56%) households. Single parents headed 32 (27%) of households. Children spent a mean of 44 h/week (range 20-60) in daycare. We evaluated 318 RTIs, for a mean annualized incidence of 2.8 per child (95%C.I. 2.3, 3.3); children had RTI symptoms an average of 11% of the time. The incidence of infection was lower after a year in daycare, with a mean annual incidence of 4.2 RTI/child (95%C.I. 3.6, 5.0) in the first year of study participation and 1.2 RTI/child (95%C.I. 0.9, 1.6) after one year (p < 0.001). On univariate hazard analysis, enrollment at under 12 months of age (Table 1) and Hispanic descent were the only demographic factors significantly associated with RTI (HR 1.7, p = 0.001 and HR 1.4, p = 0.03, respectively). Male sex was significantly associated with RhV infections (HR 1.8, p = 0.01), and this association was not dependent on age.We detected viruses in 213/318 (67%) RTIs (Fig. 1) . Table 2 displays clinical characteristics associated with identified pathogens. RhV was detected more than any other virus (111/318, 35%, p < .01). Only 7 Flu A and 1 Flu B infections were identified. HMPV was also detected infrequently (4% of RTIs). The viruses with the overall largest impacts on our cohort were RSV, RhV and AdV. These 3 viruses accounted for 215 (67%) of single viral infections. Seasonal distribution of detected viruses is displayed in Fig. 2 . Viruses were most often detected in the winter months. Influenza (winter), RSV (fall/winter) and HMPV (winter/spring) had clear seasonal patterns with some overlap. HCoV and ADV were detected less frequently in the summer months. The other viruses did not have a seasonal pattern of detection. Single viral infections due to RSV were more likely to include fever (p = .002) than single viral illnesses without RSV, and the rate of fever (80%) in RTIs with RSV as the only identified virus was higher than the rate of fever in RTIs with all other viruses except influenza A. Wheezing was also more likely to be noted with single RSV infections (p = .01). Of all the study viruses, RSV was the only single infection significantly associated with a visit to the health care provider (p = .001). AdV had the longest mean duration of symptoms of any single viral infection (9.1 days). Even though the relative severity of RhV infection was not significant, RhV caused the largest burden of disease compared to the other viruses. RhV was the virus detected in the highest total number of both febrile and wheezing episodes, caused the highest total number of infections, and the highest total number of visits to a health care provider. Unlike RSV, RhV was detectable year round. Co-infections with multiple respiratory viruses were common, occurring in 87/318 (27%) RTIs, with RhV, CoV and AdV being the most common co-pathogens. Co-infections with RhV, CoV, RSV and HMPV each resulted in significantly longer duration of illness than RTI's with other pathogens ( Table 2 ). Severity of illness was not worse with co-infections. However, co-infections with PIV or RSV both resulted in a significantly higher number of visits to health care providers than PIV-or RSV-negative illnesses, respectively. Of 37 parainfluenza virus infections, 8 (22%) were due to PIV4, 25 (67.6%) were due to PIV3, 3 (0.1%) to PIV1, and 1 (0.03%) to PIV2. When compared to the other PIV subtypes, PIV4 infections had the following characteristics: mean duration of symptoms lasted 8.8 days versus 8.2 days; percentage with fever was 50% versus 41%; the mean number of days missed from daycare was 1.5 versus 1.1; and the percent of infections requiring a visit to a health care provider was 88% versus 62%. Only one of the PIV4 infections was associated with croup. Forty-five children were asymptomatic on enrollment, with viruses identified in 19 (42%). The most commonly isolated viruses were RhV (n = 11; 24%), AdV (n = 5; 11%) and CoV (n = 3; 7%). Neither RSV nor HMPV was identified. Twenty-five children with asymptomatic enrollment swabs had subsequent illness swabs available for comparison at a median of 24 days after asymptomatic Table 3 Case crossover analysis of asymptomatic viral detection compared to the first subsequent illness in the same subject.
