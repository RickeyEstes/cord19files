Fever was the most common symptom in FLU positive patients. In patients with FLUB a fever <38°C (range: 37-37.9°C) was significantly more frequent than FLUA (p = 0.019) and patients affected by FLUA had a significantly higher frequency of respiratory simptoms (p = 0.034) than patients with FLUB. Apnea was equally distributed in FLUA and FLUB patients. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of laryngitis, pharyngitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, bronchopneumonia, pneumonia, or pertussis. Twenty five patients presented with neoplasia/hematological malignancies or a severe underlying disease, such as chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems, metabolic diseases, and neurological disorders, that were clustered in congenital and genetic disorders ( Table 1 ). In patients suffering from underlying diseases, FLUA infection was more prevalent than FLUB (p = 0.044). The normal concentration of CRP in healthy human serum ranges from 0 to 0.50 mg/dL. In the FLU patients, the mean CRP value was 1.71 ± 2.54 for FLUA patients and 1.14 ± 1.72 for FLUB patients. A value ≥ 0.50 was obtained in 45 % of FLUA cases and in 46 % of FLUB. Information related to the department where patients were admitted is shown in Table 1 . Patients accessed the hospital through the emergency unit in 33.7 % of FLUA and 66.3 % of FLUB cases (p = 0.017). The median of length of stay was 5 days (range: 0-59) for FLUA and 3 days (range: 0-116) for FLUB. Community acquired influenza infections were equally distributed between the FLUA and FLUB patients, while among nosocomial infections FLUB was responsible for 90.9 % versus 9.1 % of FLUA (p = 0.039). There were no significant differences observed in the frequency of co-infections between the different types of FLU. Among the 62 patients infected with FLUA, 18 (29.03 %) co-infections with other respiratory pathogens were detected, 13 of which were co-infections with respiratory viruses and 5 were with bacteria. In 71 patients infected with Influenza B, 11 (15.5 %) co-infections were detected, 7 of which were co-infections with viruses and 4 were with bacteria. There were no co-infections detected in patients with the B/Victoria/02/87 lineage. The respiratory pathogens responsible for the co-infections are listed in Table 2 . The distribution of influenza cases during the 2012-2013 season is shown in Fig. 2 . The peak incidence of positive cases was between the 5th and 11th week of 2013. The highest incidence occurred for FLUA and B in the 7th and 8th week, respectively, corresponding to the middle of February (Fig. 3) . The first FLUA case was detected at the end of November 2012 and started circulating earlier than FLUB, which was first detected at the end of December 2012.
