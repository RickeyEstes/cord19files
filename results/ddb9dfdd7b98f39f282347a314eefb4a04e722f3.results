There was no significant difference in the distribution of age, sex, and school type between the intervention and control group (Table 2) . There was no significant difference between two groups in total score and sectional scores (patient satisfaction, history taking, physical exam, clinical courtesy, patient education, and patient-physician interaction) on the CPX conducted in February 2015 (Table 3) . All scores, except for physical exam, increased in both the intervention group and control group on the CPX conducted in July. In particu- Values are presented as meanÂ±standard error or number (%). *Obtained using a Student t-test for age; the c 2 test was used for sex and type of school. We may interpret it as the educational module being the focus on history taking with case specificity. Other educational interventions, such as a general hands-on skill course for comprehensive physical exam skills, were ineffective enough to affect the area score. There was no significant correlation between school achievement, history taking, and physical exam scores of students; 9) history taking and physical exam, sections that require frequent contact with patients, were regarded by students to be the most difficult on the first CPX held in Korea. 10) This means that it is difficult to significantly increase scores on history taking and physical exam through ordinary curriculum. In this study, activities of students to prepare checklist for role play, feedback weak points during role play using the checklist, and repeatedly learn about the checklists of history taking section are believed to have directly and indirectly increased scores on history taking section. In a study by Han et al., 14) physician-patient interaction (PPI) score had high correlation with history taking. Smith 15) defined history taking as "a communication in which a patient can speak freely and a physician plays the role of an attentive listener to understand and ap- modules in the case of cough, and GERD is a key diagnosis to implicate the digestive system, unlike other cough problems (respiratory system). Therefore, this result suggests that scores may not increase unless role play practice is done on a wide variety of diseases for each item. However, this case specificity alone would not fully explain how the CPX results of the group, which underwent a preparation course, were higher than those of the group that did not undergo a preparation course. Training experiences would have led to acquiring relevant working knowledge and subsequent improvements in clinical competency in general. The limitations of this study are as follows. First, the scope of this study is limited to activities conducted within a single medical school, and thus carries inevitable restrictions when its findings are presented to a broader scope. Second, the long-term effects of CPX preparation education on the performance at the national examination could not be examined, as only the short-term effects were observed and exam-
