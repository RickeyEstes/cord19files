Overall structure of the F26G19 Fab-RBD complex With the exception of the Fab elbow angles (169.9°a nd 186.0°), the two F26G19 Fab-RBD complexes in the asymmetric unit are found to be essentially identical. The two RBDs, the two variable light (V L )/ variable heavy (V H ) domains, and the two constant light (C L )/constant heavy (C H ) domains superimpose with r.m.s.ds of 0.36, 0.40, and 0.49 Å, respectively. The nearly linear elbow angle is not uncommon for an IgG2a/kappa antibody, 27 and with the exception of the highly variable H3 complementarity determining region (CDR), the CDRs are found to adopt canonical conformations. 28 The 12-residue CDR H3 consists of two consecutive turns at approximate right angles to one another. 96 GIPQ 99 compose the i to i + 3 residues of a cisproline type VIb turn that is found to interact extensively with RBD residue Ile489, while residues 99 QLLR 100B adopt a type I-like turn that predominately interacts with the Fab V L domain. Formation of the F26G19 Fab-RBD complex ( Fig. 1) does not induce significant conformational changes in the RBD, as shown by a comparison with the free RBD 25 and the RBD-ACE2 10 complex. The RBD is composed of a five-stranded antiparallel βsheet core and the RBM, the extended ACE2-binding loop that includes a small two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and three short α-helices. As in the RBD-ACE2 complex, RBD residues 318-322 and 502-510 are disordered and are not observed in the electron density maps. The RBD contains three disulfidebonded pairs of cysteine residues: Cys323/Cys348, Cys366/Cys419, and Cys467/Cys474. Notably, the RBD fragment used in determining the X-ray crystal structure of the Fab m396-RBD complex 22 was composed of residues 317-518 and that structure shows that Cys511, a residue not included in the 318-510 fragment used here, forms a disulfide bond with Cys378. The additional disulfide bond serves to immobilize the C-terminus of the RBD, resulting in the completion of a short three-stranded β-sheet, and electron density for residues 502-512 is observed in the Fab m396-RBD complex. The 318-510 fragment was also used in determining the structure of the free RBD; in that structure the RBD was found to form a dimer in the crystal lattice. 25 However, it should be noted that the native Cys378/Cys511 disulfide bond and the associated formation of the short threestranded β-sheet is not structurally compatible with the observed dimer. We see no propensity for the 318-510 fragment to form dimers as determined by gel-filtration chromatography analysis at ∼ 10-100 μM concentration. The F26G19 Fab-RBD interface buries a total surface area of approximately 1400 Å 2 and is found to exhibit a high degree of electrostatic and shape complementarity 29 (S c = 0.70). On the RBD, four discrete segments of polypeptide are buried in the interface. The four segments, residues 359-362, 391-392, 424-427, and 486-492, contribute 21%, 10%, 23%, and 46% to the total RBD surface buried, respectively. In addition, the buried RBD surface is flanked on one side by two N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn330 and Asn357). Both asparagine side chains point away from the RBD-Fab interface (see Fig. 3 ), and we have shown that carbohydrate does not interfere with binding; the affinity of the F26G19 Fab for the glycosylated (K d = 2.6 × 10 − 8 M) and the deglycosylated RBD (K d = 1.2 × 10 − 8 M) is very similar, as measured by BIAcore analysis (data not shown). Nearly all of the F26G19 Fab residues in the interface are contributed by the CDRs, with 76% of the surface area buried coming from the heavychain CDRs. The dominant role played by heavychain CDRs has also been observed in other Fabantigen complexes. 30
