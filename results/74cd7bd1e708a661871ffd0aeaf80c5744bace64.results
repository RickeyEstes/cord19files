The SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein, classified as a Class I viral fusion protein, consists of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain (Fig. 1) . It is also known that several regions of viral fusion proteins bind and interact with membranes, experience conformational changes and interact between each other, which make possible the fusion of the viral and cell membranes [55, 56] . From our previous work, we have selected three specific sequences from the SARS-CoV S2 sequence, i.e., SARS FP , SARS IFP and SARS PTM (S2 regions comprising residues from 770 to 788, from 873 to 888, and from 1185 to 1202, see Fig. 1 ) to explore the interaction of these peptides, either alone or in combination, with monolayers or LUV S having different lipid compositions.
