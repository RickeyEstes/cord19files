Expression and purification of SARS main protease SARS protease encoding gene was amplified using PCR method and inserted into commercial vector pET-32Xa/LIC for expression of the enzyme with thioredoxin, hexa-His tag, and FXa protease cleavage site on the N-terminus. The engineered plasmid in E. coli BL21 host cell under the control T7 promoter yielded large quantity of recombinant His-tagged SARS prote-ase. The Ni-NTA column was employed for the Histagged protease purification. After the tag cleavage by FXa protease, the mixture was loaded onto another Ni-NTA. The flowthrough thus contained highly pure untagged protease as shown by reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) . Unlike the previously prepared SARS protease, which contains the C-terminal hexa-His tag, our SARS protease is intact without any tag. The final recovery yield for purified protein was approximately 50 mg/L culture, which is about 3-to 5-fold higher than 10 or 15 mg/L obtained by using the pET21a or PQE30 vector as described previously [15, 18] .
