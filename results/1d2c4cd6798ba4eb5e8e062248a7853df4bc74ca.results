The sequencing of the 19 airplane sewage samples produced an average of 19.4 million 100 bp single-end reads per sample. Around 50% of the reads did not map to any of the databases used in this study, which is in line with previous studies [27, 35, 36] , whilst the majority of assigned reads mapped to bacterial databases (S1 Fig). Only an average of 0.24% of the reads mapped to viruses, and 0.01% to human viruses despite the use of the viral capture probes. The viral reads mapped to 287 different viral strains from the viral databases, but due to the high chance of misclassification using read aligners we conservatively agglomerated all reads on the species level. This resulted in a total of 104 viral species, from 31 different viral families (Fig 2) . Of these species 37 had a confirmed or suspected human host, 6 were parasite or animal viruses, 12 were plant viruses and 49 were bacteriophages.
