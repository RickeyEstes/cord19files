Between 2009 and 2018, there were 51,504 published documents related to the microbiome, including 1713 articles related to the MGBA: 829 (48.4%) original articles, 658(38.4%) reviews, and 226 (13.2%) other articles such as notes, editorials or letters. English was the most frequently used language (n = 1648), followed by French (n = 16), and Chinese (n = 19), with these accounting for 98.2% of publications related to MGBA. Publications related to MGBA and the microbiome are represented in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. Time trend analyses show rising numbers of publications related to MGBA between 2009 and 2018 (r = 0.950; P value< 0.001), and a correlation between overall numbers of microbiome and MGBA publications (r = 0.991, p < 0.001) during the study period. The term analyses maps are presented in Fig. 2 : the larger circles representing frequently occurring abstract and title terms. Colors used to differentiate between 4 main topic clusters: 1. "modeling MGBA in animal systems (red cluster)", 2. "interplay between the gut microbiota and the immune system (green cluster)", 3. "irritable bowel syndrome related to gut microbiota (blue cluster)", and 4. "neurodegenerative diseases related to gut microbiota (yellow cluster)". Table 1 presents the 10 most prolific countries related to MGBA publications, with the top 4 being the USA (n = 385), Ireland (n = 161), China (n = 155), and Canada (n = 144). The overall citation h-index was 106, and the countries with the highest h-index values were the USA (69), Ireland (58) , and Canada (43) . There is a positive modest correlation between h-index and number of published articles (r = 0.817, P-value = 0.004). Figure 3 shows the network visualization map for country collaborations, showing 35 out of a total 86 countries that had more than ten publications; the size of frame represents the number of publications, the thickness of lines signifies the extent of collaboration between the countries. Co-authorship in the field of MGBA is shown in Fig. 4 , with 5 clusters identified; the size of frame represents the number of publications by an author, and the thickness of lines signifies the extent of collaboration between authors. Of the 6054 authors, 25 Research topics clustered by mapping of co-occurrences of terms in title/abstract for publications related to microbiome-gut-brain axis (MGBA). Of the 30,250 terms, 179 terms occurred at least 50 times. For each of the 179 terms, a relevance score was calculated and used to select the 60% most relevant terms. In Fig. 2 , the size of the circles represents the occurrences of terms in title/abstract. The largest set of connected terms consists of 107 terms in four clusters. The four clusters can be broadly interpreted as "modeling MGBA in animal systems (red cluster)", "interplay between the gut microbiota and the immune system (green cluster)", "irritable bowel syndrome related to gut microbiota (blue cluster)", and "neurodegenerative diseases related to gut microbiota (yellow cluster)" had at least ten publications including the most active author Cryan, J.F. with 120 (7.0%) publications. The 10 most influential journals covering the MGBA research with their IFs are shown in Table 2 . The three most influential journals from the top 10 influential journals are Brain Behavior and Immunity (49 articles), Plos One (34 articles), and Scientific Reports (33 articles).
