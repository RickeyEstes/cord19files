Patients could be categorized into 1 of 5 recognized ultrastructural defects. 3, 4, 19 This formed the following groups: isolated outer dynein arm defects, a combined defect of both outer and inner dynein arms, isolated inner dynein arm defects, radial spoke defect with an associated inner dynein arm defect (radial spoke defect), and transposition defect. The clinical pictures of patients with PCD caused by different ultrastructural defects are shown (Table I ). The mean age at diagnosis was 4.7 years (range, 0.1-14 years). More than 98% of patients had chronic chest symptoms, and 90% had chronic nasal symptoms. Ear symptoms were reported in half the subjects. Situs inversus was found in 41% of patients. None of the 8 (100%) patients with a transposition defect had situs inversus. Nearly two thirds of the patients had either a combined inner and outer dynein arm defect (36%) or an isolated outer dynein arm defect (29%). The remaining ultrastructural defects were less common, with an isolated inner dynein arm defect responsible for 14%, a transposition defect 14%, and radial spoke defect 7%. Each patient had an average of 15 ciliated cells (range, 5-36) and 310 individual cilia (range, 28-1067) examined by TEM. Detailed ciliary ultrastructural evaluation for each defect is shown (Tables II and III ). In patients with isolated outer dynein arm defects, a combined defect of both outer and inner dynein arms, or an isolated inner Inner and outer dynein arm defect 20 ( Asthma, rhinitis, other respiratory diseases dynein arm defect, less than 5% of cilia had microtubular abnormalities; 25% of cilia with a radial spoke defect exhibited peripheral microtubular defects. Patients with ciliary transposition defect had a similar percentage of cilia with microtubular defects, but this predominantly involved the central microtubular pair. It is of interest that in all patients except those with an isolated outer dynein arm defect, ciliary orientation is markedly increased compared with the normal range 20 of <11°. In patients with the following abnormalities: isolated outer dynein arm defect, combined defect of both outer and inner dynein arms, isolated inner dynein arm defect, and radial spoke defect with an associated inner dynein arm defect, 95% of cilia were found to exhibit the defect (Table III) . Although referred to as absence of dynein arms, it was possible to identify at least 1 dynein arm. The dynein arms that were identified appeared abnormal (Table III) . Approximately 5% of cilia exhibited defects of both inner and outer dynein arms in the following ultrastructural groups: isolated outer dynein arm defect, isolated inner dynein arm defects, and radial spoke defect. Less than 1% of cilia with a transposition defect had associated defects of the outer and inner dynein arms (Table III) . No patients with PCD had cilia with a normal beat pattern (Fig 1, A; Table IV) . 20 It was possible to categorize the patients into 3 groups on the basis of distinct dyskinetic beat patterns observed (Table IV) . Virtually immotile cilia (Fig 1, b, Table IV) Cilia with either a combined inner and outer dynein arm defect or an isolated outer dynein arm defect were observed to have large areas of immotile cilia. Ciliary movement, when present, was restricted to a slow, short, stiff flickering motion (Fig 1, B) . In the combined inner and outer dynein arm defect group, an average of 80% of cilia were immotile. The mean (± SD) CBF was 0.8 (± 1.7) Hz. In the outer dynein arm defect group, an average 55% of cilia were immotile. Cilia that were moving had a stiff flickering motion with a mean (± SD) beat frequency of 2.3 (± 2.6) Hz. Stiff ciliary beat pattern (Fig 1, c, Table IV) Cilia with an isolated inner dynein arm defect or a radial spoke with an isolated inner dynein arm defect were observed to have a very abnormal stiff forward power stroke with a markedly reduced amplitude. Cilia failed to bend along their axoneme (Fig 1, C) . Ten percent of the cilia in patients with an isolated inner dynein arm defect were immotile. The remainder had a mean (± SD) CBF of 9.3 (± 4.0) Hz. Cilia with a radial spoke defect associated with an inner dynein arm defect were found to beat in a similar manner to cilia from patients with an isolated inner dynein arm defect. Thirty percent of the cilia were immotile, and the remainder beat at a lower mean (± SD) CBF of 6.0 (± 3.3) Hz.
