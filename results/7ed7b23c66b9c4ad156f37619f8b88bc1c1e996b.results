The IfitmDel animals demonstrate enhanced adiposity The IfitmDel strain possesses a defined and engineered (via Cre-Lox) chromosomal deletion of all five of the Ifitm genes on a mouse genetic background of C57BL/6 [16] . No coding sequences or regulatory sequences other than those associated with the Ifitm genes are known to be lost in this deletion. Mice lacking these Ifitm genes are fertile and thrive in colonies except for the welldescribed sensitivity to viral infections. In maintaining such mice in our colony we noted that the older IfitmDel animals were generally larger than their WT (C57BL/6) age and sex matched counterparts. To quantify these differences, body weights were taken from male mice maintained in the colony on regular mouse chow. Fig 1A, shows the slow but significant enhanced weight gain associated with the IfitmDel animals compared to WT. This body weight increase corresponded with an increased total fat mass as the animals aged ( Fig 1B) . Measurement of 3 day food intake averages for a period of 21 days shows that the IfitmDel mice consume more chow than the WT age-matched controls ( Fig 1C) . Also increased levels of epididymal fat deposits were present in these ( Fig 1D) . Histological examination suggested the adipocyte size was increased compared to WT adipose tissue ( Fig 1E) and this was confirmed by quantitation as shown in Fig 1F. The same trends were observed for female mice (not shown).
