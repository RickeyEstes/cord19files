From December 2016 to April 2017, 251 asymptomatic patients were screened. 66 (26%) of these patients were aged 18 or younger and were screened on the pediatric ward. Of the remaining 185 adult patients, 11 (5.9%) received swabs on the emergency ward, whereas 174 patients were screened exclusively on the adult hematooncological ward. Overall, 665 screening samples were obtained, 23% of which (n=152) were from pediatric patients and 77% from adults (n=513). The mean screening sample number per patient was 2.3 for pediatric patients and 2.8 for adults. The majority (98%) of the screening samples were nasopharyngeal swabs (n=654). 11 samples were pharyngeal washes and were exclusively obtained from adult patients. Altogether, 23 asymptomatic patients tested positive either for influenza or RSV in a screening sample, i.e., a combined detection rate of 9%. 11 patients (10 adults and one child) tested positive for influenza type A. 12 patients (5 adults and 7 children) were tested positive for RSV. Co-infections with influenza virus and RSV were not detected. An overview is shown in Table 1 . Interestingly, in 6 patients (5 influenza virus patients and 1 RSV patient), a significant increase of the viral load in samples was observed following the positive screening specimen ( Table 2) . Course of viral load in 6 patients who showed an increase in viral load (presumed detection during the incubation period). The 6 patients showed an increase in viral load during their clinical course and were therefore presumably detected during the incubation period. 13 of the 23 (57%) asymptomatic patients were in twoand four-bed rooms at the time the screening test was reported positive (4 positive for RSV, 9 positive for influenza virus). 6 of these patients in shared rooms were immediately moved to separate single rooms, following the infection control recommendations. 2 patients with influenza were kept together, as they occupied the same 2-bed room when they simultaneously tested positive. 2 patients with RSV and 1 patient with influenza stayed in the shared rooms, and 2 patients had already been discharged when the test result became available. 10 of the 23 asymptomatic patients were already located in single (one-bed) rooms (for reasons other than infection control) and remained in this room after virus detection. For all patients identified (whether located in private or shared rooms after positive test results were available), barrier precautions (droplet and contact) were implemented as described above (see "Materials and methods" section). On both wards, all patients presenting with symptoms of acute respiratory infections were routinely tested with a broad panel for respiratory viruses (including RSV and influenza). In these patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection, we found 1 influenza case and 1 RSV case on the pediatric ward and 1 influenza case and 3 RSV cases on the adult ward from December 2016 to April 2017. Prevalence of other respiratory viruses was low in this season on these two wards. 1 parainfluenza case, 6 human metapneumovirus cases and 4 rhinovirus cases were found on the pediatric ward. On the adult ward 1 parainfluenza case was detected. Clusters of nosocomial transmission of RSV or influenza were not observed during the screening program period.
