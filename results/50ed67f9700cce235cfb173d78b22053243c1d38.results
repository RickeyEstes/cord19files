The results of the HSV-1 BLASTS, sized according to the number of viral hits per protein, using the filter "Alzheimer," are shown in Table 2 . Over a hundred human gene products, including all of the major Alzheimer's disease susceptibility gene products (APOE4, clusterin, complement receptor 1, and PICALM) and most of many other diverse genes that have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease in genetic association studies contain intraprotein sequences that are identical to those within herpes simplex viral proteins. The alignment with complement receptor 1 (CR1) has functional consequences, as glycoprotein C of the virus acts as a CR1 mimic, binding to other complement components (C3 and its derivatives) blocking the complement cascades and preventing formation of the membrane attack complex [12, 13] . This nicely illustrates one of the functional consequences of this type of mimicry. The type of viral homology for various different protein classes is shown in Table 3 . These classes include products involved in APP signalling and processing (BACE1 and 2 and gamma-secretase components), cholesterol and lipoprotein function, tau function, inflammation, and oxidative stress, all of which are key processes disrupted in the Alzheimer's disease brain. Using the filter "cholesterol," a number of cholesterol and lipoprotein-related proteins again contain numerous sequences corresponding to those found in herpes viral proteins. This group of proteins play an important role in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology [14] [15] [16] [17] . The unfiltered BLAST returns the human proteins with the greatest homology to viral proteins and showed that herpes simplex viral proteins are highly homologous to a series of family members of diverse protein kinases. Several of these are known to phosphorylate the microtubule protein tau, an effect that is observed following HSV-1 infection [5] . The homology is such as to suggest that such phosphorylation may be accomplished by the viral proteins themselves, as well as by human protein kinases (Table 4) . This type of mimicry is by no means restricted to the herpes simplex virus as APOE4, clusterin, complement receptor 1, and PICALM are homologous to proteins from a diverse array of phages and viruses including phages that affect commensal bacteria, the influenza virus, and the HHV-6 virus which has a seroprevalence approaching 100% [18] ( Table 5 ). Because of the universality of the phenomenon of viral matches within the human proteome, most proteins will be homologous to proteins from specific subsets of viruses. Viruses and other pathogens expressing proteins with homology to key susceptibility gene products might however be considered as important potential environmental risk factors. For the major Alzheimer's disease gene candidates, several herpes species other than HSV-1 (HSV-2, 3, 6, 6B, and 8) fall into this category ( Table 5) . The tables in supplementary data on the website http:// www.polygenicpathways.co.uk/alzheimer.htm show that numerous Alzheimer's disease susceptibility gene products are also homologous to proteins expressed by other pathogen risk factors in Alzheimer's disease, including Chlamydia pneumonia, which has recently been detected in the Alzheimer's disease brain [19] . Cryptococcus neoformans, Helicobacter pylori, Porphyromonas gingivalis (one cause of the gum disease that is a risk factor in Alzheimer's disease [20] ), Borrelia Burgdorferi, Table 2 : Human proteins with homology to HSV-1 proteins: The size of symbol (HUGO Nomenclature approved gene symbols) is proportional to the number of viral proteins displaying homology to the gene product. Filter "Alzheimer": all of the genes encoding for these proteins with the exception of those with the strikethrough have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease in genetic association studies. Filter "cholesterol": genes encoding for proteins products in dashed boxes have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease in genetic association studies. No Filter: HSV-1 proteins are most homologous to diverse families of kinases: Those boxed have been shown to phosphorylate the microtubule protein tau (Data from Kinasource and from NCBI Interactions section for the MAPT gene (tau)).
