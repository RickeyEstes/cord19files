Thirty three patients (17 male) with a median age 56 years (range 27-74) completed the study. These patients had mean PEF percentage of predicted of 62% (range 20-103%). Twenty-one patients (64%) required regular treatment with inhaled B,-adrenoceptor stimulants and 30 patients (91%) used inhaled steroids regularly; eight patients (24%) also took oral steroids. Eleven patients (33%) had received influenza vaccine previously. The differences between mean pre-and postvaccination PEFs percentage of predicted were not statistically significant for the whole study period (pre=61.9%; post=61.6%; 95% C.I. -2.3-1.7%; P=O.76), or the 2 days before and after vaccination (pre=62.1%; post=61.3%; 95% C.I. -3.2-1.5%; P=O.49). The difference between mean pre-and postvaccination asthma symptom scores was not significant for the whole study period (pre=0.62; post=0.51; 95% CI -0.15-0.03; P=O.17), or the 2 days before and after vaccination (pre=0.59; post=0.46; 95% C.I. -0.17-0.04; P=O.17). The difference between mean daily dose of asthma medication was not significant for the whole study period (pre=3.15; post=3.27; 95% C.I. -0.12-0.26; P=O.58), or the 2 days before and after vacciantion (pre=3.36; post=3.23; 95% C.I. 0.17-0.00; P=O.16). One patient reported systemic and upper respiratory tract symptoms, accompanied by 42% drop in PEF, 1 day after vaccination which lasted for 1 day. She first contacted the research team on day 7 after vaccination when she again documented upper respiratory symptoms, accompanied by 35% drop in PEF, that lasted for 4 days. Specimens for diagnostic virology, obtained on day 7, failed to detect any respiratory pathogens.
