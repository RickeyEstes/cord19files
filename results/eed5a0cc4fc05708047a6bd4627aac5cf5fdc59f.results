Affymetrix array analysis of the expression profile of interferon related genes and other cytokine/chemokine genes in IBV-infected Vero cells Determination of the global gene expression profiles in mock-treated and IBV-infected Vero cells at 24 h post-infection by Affymetrix array revealed a 12.25-to 36-fold induction of 57 interferon-related genes and other cytokine/chemokine genes at the transcriptional level (Table 1) . Among them, a 6.25-and a 5.76-fold induction of IL-6 and IL-8, respectively, at the transcriptional level, was detected (Table 1) . A 4-fold up-regulation of IRF1 was also observed in the same study. Analysis of IBV-infected Vero cells harvested at 24 h post-infection by realtime RT-PCR showed a 4.5-, 3.8-and 3.2-fold induction of IL-6, IL-8 and IRF1, respectively, compared to mock-treated cells. Up-regulation of IL-6 and IL-8 at the protein level in IBV-infected cells, although to a lesser extent, was also observed in a previous report (Xiao et al., 2008) . Affymetrix array analysis of the global gene expression profiles in mock-treated and IBV-infected Vero cells at 24 h post-infection also revealed a 4-fold induction of DUSP1 at the transcriptional level in the infected Vero cells (Table 1) . Northern blot analysis of the induction of IL-6, IL-8, IRF1 and DUSP1 at the mRNA level in IBV-infected Vero cells To further confirm the induction of IL-6, IL-8 and IRF1 and to study the induction kinetics in IBV-infected cells, Northern blot analysis of IL-6, IL-8 and IRF1 at the mRNA level was carried out in IBV-infected Vero cells in a time-course experiment. Vero cells were infected with IBV at an MOI of approximately 1 and harvested at 0, 8, 16, and 24 h post-infection. Total RNAs were extracted and subjected to Northern blot analysis with DIG-labeled DNA probes for IL-6, IL-8, and IRF1, respectively. IBV RNAs were also detected to indicate the efficiency of viral infection, and GAPDH as a loading control for normalization. As shown in Fig. 1A , IL-6, IL-8 and IRF1 mRNAs were gradually increased after 8 h post-infection, and peaked at 24 h post-infection. Quantification of the corresponding bands by densitometry showed that IL-6 mRNA was induced 17-fold at 8 h post-infection and continued to increase to 109-fold at 24 h post-infection, IL-8 mRNA was induced 3fold at 8 h post-infection and continued to increase to 57-fold at 24 h post-infection, and IRF1 was induced 2-fold at 8 h post-infection and continued to increase to 8-fold at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 1A) . It was noted that the folds of IL-6 and IL-8 induction obtained by this approach were much higher than those obtained by Affymetrix and real-time RT-PCR assays. Nevertheless, these results clearly demonstrate that IL-6, IL-8, and IRF1 are induced at the mRNA level in Vero cells infected with IBV. The induction of DUSP1 in IBV-infected Vero cells was also examined by Northern blot analysis in a time-course experiment (Fig. 1B) , showing gradual induction of DUSP1 mRNA from 12 h to 24 h postinfection. Quantification by densitometry showed a 7.4-to 18-fold induction from 12 to 24 h post-infection (Fig. 1B) . The same membranes were stripped and re-probed for IBV RNA, showing gradually increased accumulation of IBV mRNA from 12 h post-infection, indicating active replication of IBV in the infected cells (Fig. 1B) . Analysis of the induction kinetics of IL-6, IL-8 and IRF1 in IBV-infected Vero, H1299 and Huh7 cells To investigate if the induction of cytokines by IBV infection is restricted to specific cell type, the induction kinetics of IL-6, IL-8 and IRF-1 were further analyzed in IBV-infected Vero, H1299 and Huh7 cells by semi-quantitative RT-PCR in detailed time-course experiments. Vero, H1299 and Huh7 cells were individually infected with IBV and harvested at 0, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h post-infection, respectively. Mock-infected cells harvested at 24 h post-infection were used as negative controls for each cell line. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of IL-6, IL-8 and IRF1 showed that all three factors were induced with various efficiencies at the transcriptional level in all the three cell lines. Quantification of the PCR bands showed that IL-6 was induced 4-to 5-fold, IL-8 was induced 2-to 12-fold, and IRF1 was induced 4-to 10-fold over the time-course in IBV-infected H1299 cells (Fig. 2) . In IBV-infected Huh7 cells, IL-6 was induced 2to 7-fold, IL-8 was induced 11-to 13-fold, and IRF1 was induced 3to 5-fold (Fig. 2) . In IBV-infected Vero cells, IL-6 was induced 2-to 6-fold, IL-8 was induced 3-to 7-fold, and IRF1 was induced 5-to 31-fold (Fig. 2) . It was noted that minor induction of these cytokines was also observed in mock-treated cells which might be due to the serum starvation or cell overgrowth (Fig. 2 ). After normalization, the relative induction folds of IL-6 and IL-8 in IBV-infected Vero cells at 24 h post-infection determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR were roughly comparable to those obtained by Affymetrix and realtime RT-PCR assays. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was therefore used to quantify the induction folds of these factors in most experiments described in the subsequent sections. IBV gRNA(+) was detected for indication of efficient viral replication, showing gradually increased accumulation of the viral gRNA(+) over time (Fig. 2) . These observations further confirm that IBV infection of cultured cells from different origins induces the transcription of IL-6, IL-8 and IRF1.
