Synthetic reconstruction of BtCoV HKU5. We have previously described the synthetic reconstruction of a noncultivatable virus, BtCoV HKU3 (16) . As phylogenetic studies indicate that BtCoV HKU5 is most closely related to MERS-CoV, we used published sequence information to synthesize an infectious molecular clone for BtCoV HKU5 (icBtCoV HKU5) (16, 17) . The genome of the virus was synthesized as six contiguous cDNA fragments, as shown in Fig. 1A , and each subclone was flanked by class II restriction endonucleases that allow for directed assembly of a fulllength cDNA genome, which encodes a T7 start at the 5= end and a poly(T) tract at the 3= end. Full-length RNAs were generated using in vitro transcription of ligated cDNAs (16, 18) . Upon electroporation of Vero cells with the full-length RNA, no infectious virus was recoverable, despite robust expression of BtCoV HKU5 N subgenomic mRNAs through 4 days postelectroporation (see Fig. S1B in the supplemental material). Passage of cell culture supernatants resulted in diminished viral subgenomic N mRNA expression over time, and eventually, the recombinant virus went extinct in culture (Fig. S1C) . Recovery of an icBtCoV HKU5 variant expressing the ectodomain of the SARS-CoV S protein. Previous studies from our group and others demonstrated that substitution of the receptor binding domain (RBD) from the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein enabled efficient in vivo replication of BtCoV HKU3 (16, 19) . To enable the recovery of BtCoV HKU5 in cell culture, we adopted a similar strategy and assembled a recombinant chimeric BtCoV HKU5 that encoded the S glycoprotein ectodomain (BtCoV HKU5-SE) ( Fig. 1A ; yellow) from SARS-CoV (16, 19) . A Y436H substitution (change of Tyr to His at position 436) ( Fig. 1A ; asterisk), previously shown to enhance replication in mice (20) , was also included in the spike gene. BtCoV HKU5-SE chimeric virus was recovered after electroporation of full-length transcripts into Vero cells. Molecular characterization of BtCoV HKU5-SE. In Vero cells, BtCoV HKU5-SE replicated with kinetics similar to those of MERS-CoV (MERS-CoV SA1, the Saudi Arabian isolate) and SARS-CoV at earlier time points and achieved peak titers at 24 h p.i. (Fig. 1B and C) . Cytopathology was characterized by fusion of cells starting at 18 h p.i., and cell death was noted at~36 h p.i. BtCoV HKU5-SE was stable in cell culture, as indicated by realtime PCR analysis of ORF1 and ORF8 expression through passage six (see Fig. S1D in the supplemental material). BtCoV HKU5-SE replicated with kinetics similar to those of the MERS-CoV England isolate (MERS-CoV Eng 1) (Fig. S2A ). Interestingly, there was a marked difference in virus replication (Fig. S2B ) in highlevel-ACE2-expressing H2B Calu-3 cells (a lung epithelial cell line), where BtCoV HKU5-SE replicated to lower titers than either MERS-CoV isolates or SARS-CoV. Although speculative, this growth difference is supported by low-level expression of N protein ( Fig. S2C ) at later time points and could reflect different sensitivities to interferon in Calu-3 cells. Efficient CoV replication and transcription involves the production of a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs (2) . Northern blot analysis from Vero cells infected with BtCoV HKU5-SE revealed eight subgenomic mRNAs ( Fig. 2A) . The predicted open reading frames encoded by each of the mRNAs are indicated in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Next, we characterized the expression of structural proteins in cells infected with BtCoV HKU5-SE. Using antisera from mice vaccinated with VRPs expressing BtCoV HKU5 N protein, we demonstrated that BtCoV HKU5 infection of Vero cells produced a discrete N protein band at the predicted molecular mass of 50 kDa in cell lysates (Fig. 2B) . Polyclonal serum specific for SARS-CoV S identified a 180-kDa S glycoprotein, along with a smaller S1 subunit (90 kDa, faster migrating band), in lysates from infected Vero cells (Fig. 2C) , consistent with the expression of the SARS-CoV S ectodomain by the recombinant BtCoV HKU5-SE. In contrast, the polyclonal serum raised against BtCoV HKU5 S did not recognize the S protein (data not shown), supporting our earlier observations that the major antibody epitopes for S proteins are likely concentrated in the N terminus (21) . The N protein of BtCoV HKU5 shares~68% sequence identity with MERS-CoV and BtCoV HKU4 N proteins (7) . To identify any possible crossreactivity with BtCoV HKU5-SE, we generated mouse polyclonal sera using VRPs expressing the N proteins from BtCoV HKU4.2 and the MERS-CoV SA1 isolate and then demonstrated that these sera recognized the BtCoV HKU5-SE N protein ( Fig. S2D and E) . Taken together, these results demonstrate the presence of conserved polyclonal antibody epitopes in subgroup 2c CoV N proteins. Protease inhibitors targeting MERS-CoV 3CLpro inhibit Bt-CoV HKU5-SE in vitro. Small molecule inhibitors targeting 3CLpro efficiently block SARS-CoV replication (22, 23) . With the 82% sequence similarity between the nsp5 proteins of MERS-CoV and BtCoV HKU5-SE, we are well positioned to identify broadly reactive group 2c protease inhibitors, which is important because there are significant functional and regulatory differences in the nsp5 proteins of different subgroups (2a, 2b, and 2c) but strong conservation of determinants within subgroups (14) . Therefore, we analyzed whether the small molecule inhibitor GRL-001 could inhibit the replication of BtCoV HKU5-SE and MERS-CoV in cell culture (23, 24) . The enzyme was purified using published methods (detailed in Methods in Text S1 in the supplemental material), resulting in high yield (28 mg/ liter) and purity, and inhibition assays were conducted using a fluorimetric substrate as described previously (22, 23) . GRL-001 was very potent in inhibiting BtCoV HKU5 3CLpro activity, with an inhibition constant (K i ) of 5.9 Ϯ 0. BtCoV HKU5-SE replication in vivo. To examine whether BtCoV HKU5-SE replicates and causes disease in mice, we intranasally infected young (~10-weekold) and old (1-year-old) BALB/c mice with 1 ϫ 10 5 PFU of virus. BtCoV HKU5-SE did not cause weight loss in young animals, but aged BALB/c mice ex-perienced~10% weight loss by 4 days p.i. (Fig. 3A ). In the aged-mouse model, clinical signs of disease included lethargy, ruffling of fur, and mildly labored breathing patterns. More importantly, in both young and aged mice, the virus replicated to 10 6 and Ͼ10 4 PFU/g in the lungs at 2 and 4 days p.i. (Fig. 3B ). Weight loss and pathology changes were not noted in mock-infected young and aged animals (data not shown). Because the Y436H substitution in the SARS-CoV S ectodomain enhances binding to the mouse ACE2 receptor (20), we infected 1-yearold ACE2 Ϫ/Ϫ mice with BtCoV HKU5-SE to assess whether ACE2 was required for virus entry and disease. No weight loss or virus replication was observed in ACE2 Ϫ/Ϫ mice ( Fig. 3A and B) , clearly identifying the requirement of mouse ACE2 in BtCoV HKU5-SE entry, replication, and disease. Although little if any pathology was noted in young infected animals, aged mice developed more-severe airway disease, perivascular and peribronchial cuffing, and pneumonia by 4 days p.i. The airway disease ( Fig. 3C and D, bottom) included denuded regions of the airway epithelium, debris in the lumen of small airways, and peribronchial cuffing with increased numbers of neutrophils and monocytes. Perivascular cuffing was also evident, with large numbers of infiltrating neutrophils and monocytes. A few animals developed focal regions of severe pneumonia with accompanying edema-filled alveoli, consistent with early acute DAD (Fig. 3D , bottom). To identify cellular targets, immunohistochemistry with polyclonal serum to HKU5 N protein was performed in lung sections of young and aged mice. As seen with SARS-CoV (25), BtCoV HKU5-SE antigens were abundant in airway epithelial cells and in epithelial cells with features characteristic of type II pneumocytes in the alveoli (Fig. 4) . No staining was noted in mockinfected lungs (Fig. 4 , top and bottom, far right).
