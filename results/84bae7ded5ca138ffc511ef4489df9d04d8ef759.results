CVLP were only detected in 5 stool samples (8%) of 5 patients (14,3%) ( Table 1 ). The positive specimens came from three hemophiliacs and two homosexuals. Only one of the patients suffered from diarrhoea when the stool sample was taken. Virus shed- ding obviously did not persist, as reexamination of faecal excretions from the enteritic and one other patient two days and four weeks later respectively did not yield CVLP. Two of the CVLP-shedding HIV patients died very soon (i.e. 5 and 18 days after we had received the first stool specimens). CVLP were detected only in patients at an advanced stage of HIV infection: Two patients were at stage 2b, three patients at stage 3. In the control group CVLP were detected in 79 of 860 cases (9.2%).
