We evaluated the performance of our supervised toponym detection technique using precision, recall and F-score. As is common in named entity recognition tasks, we evaluated performance via strict and overlapping matching [33] . For strict matching, each token is treated separately and the classifier is deemed to be correct when the actual and predicted tag for a token match exactly. For overlapping matching, any overlap between an actual toponym and a predicted toponym is considered to be a match and fully rewarded. Because the data set is heavily imbalanced and most of the tokens belong to the O class, we assess the performance of the classifier for the positive classes only (e.g., B and I). In Table 1 , we present the evaluation of our system on the test corpus. We show the performance obtained by each of the three feature categories, along with the performance of the benchmark system for this task. The table illustrates the strength of our supervised CRF classifier, showing that it improves upon our past, rule-based system [13] by approximately 10 points in terms of F-score. The best score is obtained by combining all the three feature sets. In terms of the performances of the individual feature sets, lexical features perform significantly better than others by obtaining significantly high F-scores. Combining lexical features with the other two feature sets enables our system to significantly improve precision over the state-of-the-art knowledge-based system [13] , with relatively low loss in recall. Overlapping evaluation considers partial overlap to be correct, while strict evaluation evaluates each token separately. CRF with all the features outperforms other variants, including the state-of-the-art knowledge-based toponym detector. Note that these scores are based on the positive classes (i.e., B and I) only.
