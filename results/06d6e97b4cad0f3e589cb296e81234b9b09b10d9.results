We tested the area-constrained segmentation method for the segmentation of synaptic vesicles and for double membrane vesicles in epithelial cells infected with SARS-coronavirus (Knoops et al., 2008) . All images are slices of electron tomography images. Images for the epithelial cells were obtained from the cell centered database (CCDB) of the National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research (NCMIR -http://ccdb.ucsd.edu). The images for the synaptic vesicles were approximately at a resolution of (1.0 nm by 1.0 nm)/pixel and for the SARS-coronavirus at (1.2 nm by 1.2 nm)/pixel. These examples were chosen to demonstrate the properties of our developed area-constrained segmentation method, because segmentations for these electron tomography images are known to be challenging. For example, for the synaptic vesicle segmentation task the vesicle wall is not directly visible in the electron tomography image. Instead it needs to be inferred from the location of proteins (which appear dark) penetrating the vesicle wall which results in a ''noisy'' appearance of the vesicle wall. Further, a large number of vesicles can be found in one image. Vesicles are closely packed in some areas, which even experts can have difficulty outlining precisely. In our experiments a user was asked to place individual seed points at the center of the objects to be segmented. The selection areas were obtained by eroding a quick-shift segmentation of the complete image. The selection region closest to the user-placed seed point was set as a foreground seed, and the selection areas at the boundaries of a 100 Ã‚ 100 pixel box centered at the seed point were set as background seeds. This box size was chosen to be sufficiently large to guarantee that the desired objects are contained within it. We used image intensities as edge terms (c st ) and set q = 0. We set c = 1 for all ADMM experiments. Setting the selection areas at the boundaries as background seeds is meaningful for our experiment because the object will be, by construction, at the center of the image. However, this is not essential. The boundaries could be included into the optimization, albeit at the price of higher computational cost. Given the selected segmentation area and the selection regions we compared the following methods for the vesicle datasets: (1) UC: Area-constrained segmentation with a lower bound of 0. This unconstrained case corresponds to a classical graph-cut segmentation with seed points. (2) LB/UB/LBUB: Area-constrained segmentation enforcing upper and lower bounds on the segmentation area separately and jointly. (3) BNC: Biased normalized cut (Maji et al., 2011) using foreground seeds. (4) NC: Normalized cut (Shi and Malik, 2000) . No seed regions are supported by this algorithm and hence none were used. (5) WS: Seeded watershed segmentation (Vincent and Soille, 1991) using foreground and background seeds. (6) RW: Random walker segmentation using foreground and background seeds. To allow comparisons between the algorithms (i) we used the same seed regions for all algorithms, (ii) we used the same edge weights g for all algorithms except for the random walker algorithm, and (iii) determined the best possible thresholds for NC and BNC by searching which threshold results in the best value for the normalized cut. For the random walker segmentation algorithm, we used two sets of edge weights, g, because this is a segmentation model which will not exhibit discontinuities at the putative segmentation boundary and hence treats edge-weights differently than all the other tested models. We report randomwalker results using the same edge-weights as the other algorithms (RW) as well as using the more appropriate default settings for random walker segmentation (d-RW).
