RNase L activity is the major pathway leading to dsRNA-induced cell death Before assessing the role of ADAR in regulating the RNase L pathway we compared the roles of MAVS, RNase L and PKR in mediating dsRNA induced cell death in A549 cells. Thus we used lentivirus delivered CRISPR/Cas9 and single-guide (sg)RNA (Table 1) Table 2 ). The various A549 mutant cell lines were characterized for their sensitivity or resistance to exogenous dsRNA by poly(rI):poly(rC) (pIC) transfection as compared to wild type (WT) A549 ( Figure 3) . We initially transfected WT A549 and KO with a range of concentrations of pIC and Figure 1 . DsRNA induced antiviral pathways. DsRNA can be destabilized by ADAR1 activity. In the absence of ADAR1 dsRNA can be recognized by (1) MDA5 leading to IFN production; (2) OAS leading to activation of RNase L and eventually translational inhibition and apoptosis and (3) PKR leading to inhibition of translation. DOI: 10.7554/eLife.25687.002 at 48 hr post treatment cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet. Cells lacking RNase L expression were resistant to cell death at treatment with up to 5 mg/ml of pIC while treatment of WT A549 as well as PKR KO or MAVS KO cells with 0.5 mg/ml of pIC promoted cell death ( Figure 3a) . To obtain a more quantitative measure of cell death as well as to assess the effects of ADAR1 ablation on cell death, we compared the kinetics of pIC-induced cell death with the same set of cells in real time with an IncuCyte Live Cell Imaging System and software ( Figure 3b ). We also observed markers of apoptosis (caspase 3/7 activity) in real time ( Figure 3c ). While cells expressing RNase L died by 24-30 hr post treatment, cells ablated for RNase L expression (RNASEL KO and RNASEL-MAVS DKO) were resistant to pIC induced cell death (Figure 3b&c) . Similarly, RNASEL KO or RNASEL-MAVS DKO showed accelerated wound healing in monolayer scratch assays compared with MAVS KO and WT cells, all of which retained RNase L ( Figure 3d ). RNase L was previously reported to impair cell migration in these assays Rath et al., 2015) as well as to promote apoptosis (Zhou et al., 1997) . Finally, the protective effect of RNASEL KO was not restricted to A549 cells as human mammary epithelial (HME) cells were also protected from pIC-induced cell death by ablation of RNase L expression ( Figure 3e ).
