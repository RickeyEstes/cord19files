Crystal structure of MERS-CoV RBD in complex with Fab m336. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of MERS-CoV neutralization by m336 and identify possible templates for development of vaccine immunogens, we determined the crystal structure of its complex with the virus RBD. We robotically screened crystallization conditions for an endoglycosidase H-treated MERS-CoV RBD complexed with the Fab m336. Crystals of diffraction quality were obtained from a condition containing 20% mono-Methyl polyethylene glycol 2000 (PEG2000 MME). A 2.65-Å resolution data set in space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 was collected at 22-ID beamline at the Advanced Photon Source with 20% glycerol as cryoprotectant, and structure solution by molecular replacement with the DDP4-bound MERS-CoV RBD and Fab revealed two Fab m336-MERS-CoV RBD complexes occupying an asymmetric unit. Iterative refinement and model building resulted in a structure with R work /R free of 19.7%/25.1% (Table 1 ; Supplementary Fig. 1a ). Fab m336 targets the MERS-CoV RBS. Fab m336 interacts with the RBS on the MERS-CoV RBD (Fig. 1a) . The interaction surface buries a total area of about 1,700 Å 2 , with 860 Å 2 contributed by m336 and 820 Å 2 by MERS-CoV RBD. Even though both the heavy-chain variable domain (V H ) and the light-chain variable domain (V L ) of m336 are involved in the interaction, the V H provides 485% binding surface. Within the V H , HCDR1, HCDR2 and framework region 3 (FR3) provide B58% of the total MERS-CoV RBD-binding surface while HCDR3 (of the V(D)J recombination product) provides B29% ( Fig. 1b and HCDR1 and HCDR2 on the other side, the antigen-binding region of m336 forms a claw-shaped surface. The claw grips the RBS with HCDR1 and HCDR2 penetrating into the concave surface formed by b5-b8 and HCDR3 and LCDR3 interacting with the outer edge of b7 and its entrance loop (Fig. 1c) . It is of note that a non-canonical disulphide bond forms between Cys98 and Cys100c (the Kabat numbering definition) to stabilize the HCDR3 into a 'twisted' loop conformation (Fig. 1d ). Similar to the receptor DPP4, m336 interacts with both patches 1 and 2 of the RBS (Fig. 1d) . Similarity in the RBD recognition by m336 and DPP4. The m336 epitope is composed of residues from the MERS-CoV RBD RBS, including strands b5-b8 and the loop leading to b7 (Fig. 2a) , which overlaps extensively with the DPP4-binding site. Pairwise comparison of ligand-binding surface areas of RBS residues either in the m336 epitope or in the DDP4-binding site 30,31 showed significant correlation (P ¼ 0.025), indicating shared usage of residues for binding m336 and receptor DPP4. For RBS residues that interact with both m336 and DPP4, their pairwise surface areas buried by m336 and DPP4 showed even stronger correlation (P ¼ 0.016; Fig. 2b ). Indeed, B90% of the m336 epitope surface overlaps with the DPP4-binding site on RBS ( Fig. 2c ; Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Interestingly, Trp535 RBD , which interacts with glycans in DPP4, was engaged by m336 HCDR3 residue Thr100a and LCDR3 residues Asn92 and Ser93. Importantly, in addition to precise targeting of the RBS, critical chemical interactions such as the salt bridges between Asp539 RBD and Lys267 DPP4 were mimicked by HCDR3 Arg100e of m336 ( Fig. 1d ; Supplementary Table 2 ). The RBD-binding surfaces on both m336 and DPP4 showed basic electrostatic potentials (Fig. 2d) . Superposition of the RBD in its m336-bound form with that in the DPP4-bound form 30 resulted in Ca root mean squared deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.82 Å, indicating that binding of m336 did not induce significant conformational changes in MERS-CoV RBD. It is interesting to note that the similarity in conformation at the antibody epitope was even higher than the rest of the MERS-CoV RBD (Ca r.m.s.d. ¼ 0.50 Å). Such superposition of the MERS-CoV RBD also brought m336 and DPP4 into overlapping positions, with 450% of the Fab m336 encompassed by the volume of DPP4 ( Fig. 2e; Supplementary Fig. 2) , indicating Immunogenetic analysis of m336. We performed immunogenetic analysis of m336 using the IMGT tool 32 to determine the closest V H and V L germline genes and junctional amino acids of V H (Fig. 3a) . We found that the m336 V H gene is derived from the IGHV1-69*06 and that the V L gene is from IGKV1-17. Remarkably, the V H gene was almost germline except for a point mutation (one non-silent nucleotide mutation) leading to a change from asparagine (Asn) to serine (Ser) at position 58. m336 was found to be derived from *06 allele that has Phe54 in HCDR2 and Lys73 in FR3. These phenylalanine (Phe) and lysine (Lys) residues are naturally encoded in most IGHV1-69 alleles, which were either found together or alone in alleles *01, *02, *03, *04, *05, *06, *07, *08, *09, *10, *12, *13 and *14. Interestingly, the IGHV1-69 gene was dominantly used in a number of anti-viral antibodies including those targeting HIV-1 gp120 CD4i epitope 33 , influenza HA 4,13,34 , SARS-CoV RBD and henipaviruses 35 . For m336, both allele-specific residues, Phe54 and Lys73, of the IGHV1-69*06, HCDR3 comprising IGHD2-2*03 and IGHJ3*02, and germline HCDR2 contributed to the paratope of V H (Fig. 1b,d) . Importantly, genetic and structural analyses further showed that the m336 V H has specific junctional residues at positions 95, 100d, 100e and 100f, which were encoded as amino acids valine (Val), Asn, arginine (Arg) and glycine (Gly), respectively (Fig. 3a) and play a dominant role in HCDR3 as elucidated in the crystal structure (Fig. 3b) .

In contrast, m336 V L , composed of IGKV1-17*01 and IGKJ4*01, was found to have five amino acid residue changes (five non-silent and three silent nucleotide mutations) resulting from mutations in the IGKV gene ( Fig. 3a ; Supplementary  Table 4 ). However, none of the V L somatic mutations was found to be directly involved in binding to RBD, but it is possible that they could influence V H -V L interactions or result in other allosteric effects. Further, the detailed structural analysis of m336 complex structure revealed that the CDRH3 residues, particularly, the junctional residues Asn100d and Arg100e, are involved in hydrogen bonding with Gly538 and Asp539 of RBD, respectively, which mimicked the conserved DPP4 interactions Gln286 and Lys267 (Fig. 2a,b ; Supplementary Table 2) . Also, the junctional residue Arg100e formed a salt bridge with Asp539, which resembled the conserved slat bridge involving Lys267 of DPP4 (Fig. 1d ,b; Supplementary Table 2 ). In summary, we show that the germline-encoded residues, Phe54 in HCDR2 and Lys73 in FR3, which are conserved in many IGHV1-69 alleles, and, importantly, junctional residues of HCDR3 that make conserved interactions that of DPP4, could play critical roles in the m336 paratope interactions. These findings suggest that the selection of specific junctional amino acids with certain V(D)J recombination and allele-specific amino acids in the heavy chain, and subsequent somatic mutations in the light chain could lead to the high affinity of m336 for its target RBD.

To further investigate potential immunogenetic mechanisms such as IGHV1-69 recombination frequency with specific IGHD and IGHJ genes among other germlines and conserved amino acid residues at allelic and junctional positions, we analysed in detail the deep sequencing data of our antibodyome studies from 69 healthy human donors 35 . Our analysis revealed that a significant (12.7%) proportion of expressed V H genes were productively recombined from the IGHV1-69 gene ( Supplementary Fig. 3) . Among a total of 9,454 sequences of IGHV1-69 germline origin, 6,512 sequences had the germlineencoded Phe54 and 3,057 sequences had the germline-encoded Lys73 natural allelic residues in the population of 69 individuals, while 1,452 sequences (15.4%) had both residues, Phe54 and Lys73, such as found in m336. This suggests a potential mechanism contributing to individually variable but effective elicitation of m336-like neutralizing antibodies in response to MERS-CoV infection. We further explored the V H sequences from our 454 antibody sequencing database to find V H -related m336-like antibodies. We found nine m336-related V H sequences from 69 volunteers that shared the same IGHV1-69 germline family with a characteristic disulphide bond at the middle of HCDR3 (Fig. 3c) . The commonalities among the HCDR3s included the similar HCDR3 length of 18 amino acids and the usage of D2-2 segment. Notably, m336 had a unique junctional motif as compared with those nine V H sequences as well as to those two anti-MERS-CoV antibodies (3B11 and 3B12) recently reported 28 (Fig. 3c) . A disulphide bond characterized by the IGHD2-2*03 gene was conserved in all the HCDR3s, implying the same IGHD reading frame usage in all those nine V H sequences. The disulphide-bonded cysteine residues in the HCDR3 of m336 involved in the direct binding to MERS-CoV RBD (Fig. 1b,d) suggested a possible functional role of this HCDR3 disulphide motif. Compared with the other anti-MERS-CoV antibodies, 3B11 and 3B12, m336 used a different V L derived from IGK1-17, whereas 3B11 and 3B12 used IGKV3-20 and IGKV4-1, respectively for their V L sequences. Although antibody phage display technique has proved to be an effective method for generating mAbs, the mAbs so obtained from random combinations of V H and V L may not reflect the natural V H /V L pairing as found in immune repertoire. To assess the potential compatibility of V H /V L pairing in m336, we searched through the IMGT/3Dstructure-DB. We found that the same m336-specific V H /V L pairing, IGHV1-69/IGK1-17, exists in the dengue cross-reactive hybridoma-derived mAb 2H12 and anti-Homo sapiens epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody, imgatuzumab, indicating the immunologically relevant cognate V H /V L pairing type for m336. To examine the role of IGKV1-17 usage in m336 V L , we further analysed the IGKV1-17 lineage sequences retrieved from naive IgM repertoires of 69 healthy human subjects as well as in neonatal IgM repertoires of two newborn babies 37 . We found 40 unique m336 V L -like sequences with the IGKV1-17 lineage that shared some pre-existing amino acid mutations with m336 V L (Supplementary Fig. 4) . Phylogenetic tree analysis of the m336 V L -like sequences revealed a highly germline-related nature of the m336 V L (Fig. 3d) . We previously found that B70% of the heavy and light chains had one to five amino acid changes as naturally occurring somatic hypermutation in the cord blood IgM repertoire 37 . An interesting aspect of our study is that most of the m336 V L mutations are also found as pre-existing mutations associated with certain IGKV1-17 lineage sequences in those IgM repertoires (Supplementary Fig. 4) . Further, we identified an anti-rabies virus antibody SC4098 by BLAST search against the GenBank database, whose V L chain has all the four mutations identical to those in m336 V L as compared with the IGKV1-17 germline 38 . This implies a possible functional role of these V L mutations. Accordingly, these V L mutations, although in a lesser extent, along with the unique junctional residues and allele encoding residues of V H , might have played a role in the high-affinity binding to MERS-CoV. Taken together, these results suggest that m336 V H uses the key immunogenetic elements including naturally occurring Phe54 and Lys73-encoded allelic-specific amino acids and specific junctional amino acid residues while m336 V L relies on somatic mutations for deriving its high affinity in an unprecedented manner. Binding and neutralization activity of germline precursors. It was surprising that m336 as an exceptionally potent MERS-CoV neutralizer had only six amino acid changes from its inferred germline precursor. To determine whether these mutations are essential for the potency of m336, we reverted the residue(s) in the heavy chain (m336-gH), light chain (m336-gL) or light-chain framework region (m336-gL-FR) to their germline counterparts, respectively (Fig. 4) . The binding of m336 and the germline predecessors to the recombinant MERS-CoV S1 protein was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Fig. 4b ,d) and Biacore ( Supplementary Fig. 5) , and their neutralization activity against MERS-CoV S1-pseudotyped viruses in Huh-7 cells was determined using methods previously described 26 (Fig. 4c,d) . The reversion of the only mutation in the heavy chain (S59N) did not have any effect on the MERS-CoVbinding affinity and neutralizing activity of m336. The m336-gH exhibited potent neutralizing activity with an IC 50 of 0.002 mg ml À 1 , which is very similar to that of m336 measured here (0.003 mg ml À 1 ) or described previously (0.005 mg ml À 1 ). The m336 light chain contains three somatic mutations in the framework region (Leu4, Leu46 and Asp70) and two in the LCDR3 region (Gln89 and Leu91). None of these residues makes direct contact with the MERS-CoV RBD. Interestingly, reversion of the three framework somatic mutations of m336 to their germline counterparts (m336-gL-FR) not only decreased the binding to MERS-CoV RBD (Fig. 4b) but also markedly reduced the neutralization potency (Fig. 4c) . The neutralization activity of m336-gL-FR (IC 50 ¼ 0.47 mg ml À 1 ) was two orders of magnitude lower than that of m336 (IC 50 ¼ 0.003 mg ml À 1 ). Complete reversion of somatic mutations in the m336 V L further decreased RBD-binding activity and MERS-CoV-neutralizing activity. Interestingly, the dissociation rate constants of the four antibodies are similar but the association rate constants of m336 and m336-gH are much higher than that of m336-gL and m336-gL-FR ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). The IC 50 value of m336-gL was 1.33 mg ml À 1 , threefold higher than that of m336-gL-FR. Consistent with the immunogenetic analysis, these results support the importance of naturally occurring V L mutations, and demonstrate that non-contact residues in the m336 light chain are essential for its binding and potency. Binding activity of junctional and allele-specific mutants. To further demonstrate the importance of junctional and allelespecific residues in the binding of m336 to RBD, we generated a series of m336 mutations and measured their binding to MERS-CoV S1 protein by ELISA (Fig. 4e,f) . m336 was derived from IGHV1-69*06 allele that has Phe54 in HCDR2 and Lys73 in FR3. In the 14 IGHV1-69 alleles, eight of them have a phenylalanine at position 54 while the other six alleles (*02, *04, *08, *09, *10 and *11) have a leucine. Interestingly, the m336 F54L mutant was found to have greatly reduced binding affinity to MERS-CoV S1 protein with at least 1,000-fold reduced EC50 as compared with the wild-type m336 (Fig. 4e) . Similarly, half of the 14 alleles have a lysine at position 73 while the other 7 alleles (*01, *03, *05, *07, *11, *12 and *13) have a glutamic acid, and the m336 K73E mutant was found to have at least 10-fold reduced MERS-CoV S1 binding affinity as compared with m336. The alanine mutations of the four junctional amino acids (V95A, N100dA, R100eA and G100fA) also showed severely reduced binding to MERS-CoV S1 as compared with the wild-type m336 (Fig. 4f) . These results, along with the structural analysis, confirmed that the junctional and allele-specific amino acids in m336 are critical for its MERS-CoV RBD binding and virus neutralization.
