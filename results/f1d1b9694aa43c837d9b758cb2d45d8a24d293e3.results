A total of 22 genomes are screened for atypical regions (Table 1 and Supplementary Material 1). On the average, the 6-cluster scheme offers the best partition. However, in a single case (Aeropyrum pernix), nine clusters are required. In general, a single cluster is devoted to rRNA. The mean distance of windows to host varies over species from 121 to 145 (mean = 132, coefficient of variation = 3%). It is tightly correlated (P-value for the Pearson correlation coefficient <10 Ã€4 ) with the cut-off distance that varies from 178 to 289 (mean = 234, coefficient of variation = 14%). Such large variations can hardly be explained on the mere basis of statistical fluctuations. As already observed (31, 45, 46) , variation of oligonucleotides usage along genome depends on species and can consequently be considered as a species property. Segmentation quality of atypical regions can be tested using rRNA genes. About 94% of rRNA is detected as atypical ( Table 1) . Borders of rRNA genes are accurate to within 130 nt (0.5 kb window and 50 bp step, threshold 99%). Meanwhile, adjacent tRNAs are identified as well. As a general rule, it can be concluded that rRNA has a specific signature that is consistently at variance with the host signature. In this context, it is worth noticing that rRNA and the remaining outliers lie at comparable distances from the species they belong to, but they are clearly different from one another, rRNAs being consistently found in their own cluster. The percentage of RNA-free outliers (at the nucleotide level) varies from 1.3 to 13% as a function of species (threshold 99%, Table 1 ). B.subtilis shows the highest percentage of atypical regions, whereas Pyrococcus abyssi has the lowest. Percentages among species are found correlated with the cut-off distance: the higher the cut-off distance, the lower the percentage of outliers (P = 0.007). In fact, a high cutoff distance takes place in species that display a high intragenomic variability, also expressed by a high mean distance to the host (Table 1) . Whether the actual percentage of atypical DNA is an intrinsic property of the species or a mere consequence of the resolution power of nucleotide biases-based methods remains consequently an open question. In addition, as already observed (13, 14) , the percentage of outliers is significantly higher for longer genomes (P = 0.004), whereas the cut-off distance is not related to the length of the genome (P = 0.69). The mean cut-off distance for the 22 species is 234 (Table 1) . This value is chosen to select credible donors. About 50% of atypical regions are subsequently given credible donors (Supplementary Material 1). Each species has it own set of (Table 1) . Many plasmids and viruses are also found in agreement with the known molecular mechanisms of horizontal transfer (Table 1 and Supplementary Material 1).
