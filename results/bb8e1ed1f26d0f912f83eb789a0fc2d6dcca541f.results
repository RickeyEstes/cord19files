Development of attenuated CDV as a live vaccine delivery vector requires study in a permissive animal host to assess important characteristics of infection like the extent of replication and dissemination in the animal host, and genetic stability of the foreign gene. In addition, monitoring infection after vaccine vector administration requires sensitive and specific assays that perform reliably when used to assess tissue specimens. To this end, three assays were developed to: (1) monitor vector replication and tissue distribution by quantifying gRNA; (2) evaluate gene expression by detecting vector-encoded mRNAs; and (3) monitor SIV gag insert stability during replication in vivo. 3.1. Development of 2-step singleplex RT-qPCR assays to detect the CDV N or SIV gag gene in vector gRNA CDV is a paramyxovirus, and like all members of this virus family, it has a negative-sense, single-stranded, nonsegmented RNA genome (Fig. 1A) . To study replication and gene expression by rCDV and the rCDV-SIV gag vector, primers and probes sets were designed to detect target sequences in CDV N, which is an essential CDV gene, and the SIV gag insert. Specifically, forward primers were designed to hybridize to the negative-sense gRNA in the RT step and to distinguish gRNA from other RNA species such as mRNA expressed by the CDV vector. The individual N and gag 2-step singleplex RT-qPCR reaction conditions were studied to achieve optimal linearity and sensitivity using purified oligoribonucleotide templates that were equivalent to the negative-sense genome strand. Assays were conducted with 10-fold serial dilutions of template ranging from 1 × 10 8 to 1 × 10 1 copies and the data was plotted as genome copies (log 10 ) versus C T . The results showed that both the N and gag singleplex assays were linear over this range of oligoribonucleotide template copies and that the slopes of the curves indicated that the PCR efficiencies were 97% and 92%, respectively (Supplemental Fig. 1A and B). The lower limit of detection for the synthetic RNA oligonucleotides templates was 10 copies of RNA template per reaction. The specificity of each of singleplex reaction was confirmed by switching target templates (1 × 10 8 copies) to observe whether cross priming amplification would occur, and in both singleplex assays, the primer-probe set detected only its specific target (data not shown). To evaluate the reproducibility of the individual CDV N and SIV gag 2-step singleplex RT-qPCR assays, 10-fold serial dilutions of each oligoribonucleotide template ranging from 1 × 10 8 to 1 × 10 1 copies was tested repeatedly. Intra-assay variation was assessed using four replicates of each template dilution, and inter-assay variation was evaluated by testing each template dilution in four separate runs. For each oligoribonucleotide standard dilution, the mean, standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated based on their C T values. The CV for the intra-assay and the inter-assay variability for the CDV N singleplex RT-qPCR assay ranged between 0.22% to 1.56% and 0.93% to 1.92%, respectively (Supplemental Table 1 ). For the SIV gag 2-step singleplex RT-qPCR assay, the CV for the intra-assay and the inter-assay variability ranged from 0.64% to 2.88% and 0.45% to 2.19%, respectively (Supplemental Table 2 ). Taken together, this indicated that both assays were accurate and were capable of generating reproducible results.
