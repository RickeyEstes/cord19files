In SÃ£o Paulo, in 2009, 51 pregnant women with confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection notified in SINAN eventually died. A total of 204 controls were randomly selected among the 525 pregnant women hospitalized with confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection notified in SINAN who recovered. The investigation was conducted in 126 hospitals where all cases and controls were hospitalized. With regard to the 51 cases and 204 controls initially identified in SINAN for the study, 22 files were missing or did not meet the case or control requirements, resulting in 48 cases and 185 controls reviewed. Two pregnant women who died were identified in another study [13] , and included in the present. The home interviews were performed for 42 cases (87.5%) and 165 controls (89.2%), as shown in Fig 1 . Table 1 presents the socio-demographic characteristics of the pregnant women. There were no significant differences in socio-demographic distribution between cases and controls, and median age, family income, education level, smoking history, occupational risk for influenza infection, previous pregnancy and existence of private health insurance were not associated with death. Table 2 shows the distribution of cases and controls according to clinical variables and visits to a healthcare provider. A total of 92.7% of cases sought medical care for the influenza episode prior to hospitalization. This proportion was higher than that of the controls. When evaluating the preconditions for admission, the presence of other risk conditions for developing complications related to influenza did not differ in cases and controls. Asthma and obesity were the most common conditions, among cases (8.3% each) and controls (8.9% vs. 3.2%, respectively). The use of an antiviral during hospitalization was an important protective factor against death, with proportions of treatment at 77.1% and 91.4% in cases and controls, respectively. The proportions of women who received antiviral within the first 48 hours of symptoms were 27% and 63.4% in cases and controls, respectively. The protective effect was also observed for treatment starting within 48 to 72 hours (5.4% and 13% in cases and controls, respectively). The initiation of treatment with an antiviral more than 72 hours after the onset of symptoms did not present significant protection. The median number of days between the date of the first symptoms and hospitalization was four for the cases and two for the controls (p = 0.003). Treatment with antibiotics was used in 100% of cases and 64.9% of controls. The average number of antibiotics used was 3.9 for cases and 1.1 for controls. Among the cases, there was a higher proportion of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (95.8% vs. 16.2%), and a higher proportion of cases underwent mechanical ventilation compared to controls (100% vs. 13%). The cases exhibited higher rates of complications than the controls (100% vs. 10.3%), predominantly: respiratory distress syndrome (72.9% vs. 4.9%), shock (75.0% vs. 0.5%), sepsis (64.6% vs. 3.2%), infections (35.4% vs. 3.8%) and renal alterations (35.4% vs. 2.7%). There were three episodes of pre-eclampsia, which evolved to death (cases) and one in the control group. None of them fulfilled the definition of HELLP syndrome, named for three features of the disease (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelet levels). All cases that evolve to death had influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 as the main cause in the death certificate. Co-infection with other infectious agents occurred in 20.4% of cases and 1.6% of controls, with the following pathogens found: Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2), Enterococcus spp. (n = 2), Candida spp (n = 2), Candida albicans (n = 1), Klebsiella spp. (n = 1) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1). The results of chest radiology were assessed in 93.8% of cases and in 80% of controls. Among the cases, 91.6% presented with alterations, with a consolidation pattern evident in 50% of cases. Among the controls, 59.5% presented alterations, with a consolidation pattern evident in 14.4% of cases. Table 3 shows the findings from the laboratory examinations at the time of hospital admission. The cases presented lower median platelet, hemoglobin and hematocrit counts and Severe influenza A(H1N1) in pregnant women higher median levels of creatine phosphokinase-CPK, lactate dehydrogenase-LDH, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase-GOT, urea and creatinine, with statistical significance. Table 4 presents the variables in the final multiple logistic regression model. Having had a previous health visit to a healthcare provider for the influenza episode before hospitalization was a risk factor for death, OR 7.93 (95% CI 2.19-28.69). Antiviral treatment was a protective Severe influenza A(H1N1) in pregnant women factor for death when administered within the first 48 hours after the onset of symptoms, OR 0.16 (95% CI 0.05-0.50), and when administered 48 to 72 hours after the onset of symptoms, OR 0.09 (95% CI 0.01-0.87). The third trimester of gestation, which was a significant risk factor in univariate analysis, lost significance in the multiple analysis, OR 2.13 (95% CI 0.91-5.00), when antiviral treatment was included in the model. The proportion of women who did not receive any antiviral treatment was similar in the three trimesters of gestation (11.1, 11.1 and 12% respectively) and the proportion of those who received the treatment after 72 hours was higher in the 3 rd trimester (14.8%, 25.9% and 32%, respectively for the 1 st , 2 nd and 3 rd trimester of gestation. As shown in Table 5 , among the cases, 45.8% of pregnant women had live births, with one twin birth, and 54.1% of the women experienced fetal deaths, of which fetal deaths later (! 23 weeks) represented 65.4% of the total number of deaths. Among the controls, 13.5% delivered during hospitalization, with one twin birth. Regarding the neonatal outcome in this group, there were 7.7% fetal deaths and 92.3% live births. Considering the live births that occurred during hospitalization, in 100% of cases and in 75.0% of controls a cesarean delivery was performed. The distribution of gestational outcomes shows a concentration of miscarriages and premature births among cases compared to controls who delivered during hospitalization: 82.6% and 45.8%, respectively (p = 0.001). Among the 144 controls who were discharged before delivery and who completed a home interview, 100% had live births, 62.5% by cesarean delivery and 86.8% at term. Regarding the live births, among the cases, there was predominance of gestational age at birth between the 32 nd and 36 th weeks of pregnancy (65.2%), and among the controls who delivered during hospitalization, 54.2% occurred at 37 weeks and over (p = 0.003). Among the controls that gave birth after hospital discharge, 86.8% of births were full term (!37 th week). Analyzing the weight of live births, there was a higher proportion of low birthweight (<2,500 g) among cases (73.9%) than among controls who gave birth during hospitalization (37.5%), p = 0.011. Considering control women who delivered after discharge, low birthweight occurred in only 6.3% of the births. During hospitalization, 8.7% (2 in 23; 28 and 38 days after birth) of the live births of cases and 4.2% (1 in 24; 12 days after birth) of live births of controls evolved to death after giving birth. None of the live births of control women who delivered after discharge evolved to death. The median gestational age, birth weight and Apgar score in the 1 st minute were significantly lower among cases than among controls who delivered during hospitalization. Among the cases, 73.7% of the newborns were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), contrasting to only 35.0% of newborns from controls who delivered during the hospitalization. When the weight of the newborns was compared with the gestational age, 27.3% of newborns from cases were classified as small for the gestational age, and 12.5% and 7.5% of those from controls who gave birth during and after hospitalization, respectively, as shown in Table 6 .
