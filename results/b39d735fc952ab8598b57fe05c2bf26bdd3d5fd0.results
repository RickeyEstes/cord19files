One hundred twenty-nine students responded (67 men and 62 women). The proportions of participants from each college were as follows: Medicine, 58.1% (n = 75); Dentistry, 14% (n = 18); Applied Medical Sciences, 13.2% (n = 17); Nursing, 10.9% (n = 14); and Pharmacy, 3.9% (n = 5). The sources of information on IC and SPs reported by the students comprised: self-directed learning, 48.8% (n = 63); informal practical learning in the ward (e.g., at bedside), 58.9% (n = 76); formal curricular teaching, 66.7% (n = 86); and IC courses, 58.9% (n = 76). For this question, participants could choose more than one source. The percentage of respondents with sufficient knowledge on IC and SPs was 73.6% (n = 95): 67.2% (n = 45) of men and 80.6% (n = 50) of women. There was no significant difference between the sexes in knowledge of SPs and IC (p = 0.082). The correct response rates for each question are provided in Table 1 . Differences between the sexes in the correct response rates for each domain are shown in Table 2 . General concepts of SPs were answered correctly 81.6% of the time, followed by hand hygiene (68.2%), PPE (66.5%), disposal of and injuries from sharp objects (54.5%), and health-care providers' care (53.05%). Students' knowledge of SPs and IC at each college is shown in Table 3 . Students' knowledge of SPs and IC at each college was as fol- Table 1 The five domains of questions and their correct response rates.
