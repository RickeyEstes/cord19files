In total 42351 patients with SARIs were included in this study which 3840 were returning Iranian pilgrims from Mecca and Karbala and 38511 were patients with SARI who admitted to local hospitals. Iranian pilgrims had symptoms upon arrival or a week later, thereby indicating that the respiratory infections were acquired during the pilgrimage. Of 3840 pilgrims, 499 (13%) were positive for influenza viruses. During the years of study in all patients, circulating influenza strains differed but the pattern was similar in both pilgrims and general population. In In 2016 just in non-pilgrim patients three dual infections of influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses were detected in November. During the years of this study from 3840 Iranian pilgrims, 46.1% (1773/3840) returned from Karbala, 35.2% (1355/3840) came from Umrah and 18.7% arrived from Hajj. We did not have any pilgrims returning from Mecca in 2016 but just 4.8% (185/3840) came from Karbala. More information about the prevalence of different influenza strains in Hajj, Umrah, Karbala and general population are shown in Table 1 .
