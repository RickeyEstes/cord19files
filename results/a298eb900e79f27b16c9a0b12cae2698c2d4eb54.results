Respiratory specimens were collected from 497 LTCF residents during the 3-year study. Characteristics of the sample are provided in Table 1 . The mean age of participants was 83.7 (median 86.0) years with 70.3% of the sample being female ( Figure 1A) . Specimens tended to be collected early in the illness, occurring an average of 1.97 (median 2.0) days after the onset of symptoms ( Figure 1B) . Depending on facility, 81%-99% of residents received seasonal influenza vaccination. Numbers of specimens collected varied by year (Table 1) . During the first 2 years, 9 of 10 sites contributed specimens, with 8 sites contributing specimens in year 3. The percentage of specimens for which RIDT was performed that were shipped to WSLH for RT-PCR and RPPda proxy measure of protocol compliancedexperienced a nonsignificant decline following the first year (c 2 ¼ 5.09; P ¼ .079) and was 86.3% overall. Time from specimen collection to testing at the WSLH averaged 3.03 (median 2.0) days. The rate of virus detection was 54.8% overall, with higher rates during 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 than in 2018-2019. This decline, however, was not significant (c 2 ¼ 5.70; P ¼ .058). The rate of virus detection from specimens was not related to the age of the resident (c 2 ¼ 0.917; P ¼ .821) across 4 age groups (Figure 2A) , nor was it dependent on the time between symptom onset and specimen collection (c 2 ¼ 1.557; P ¼ .821; Figure 2B) . A wide variety of viruses was detected from the LTCF residents. Influenza viruses were most frequently detected from LTCF residents (31.8%), followed by hMPV (20.9%). Together, FluA, FluB, hMPV, and RSV comprised 69% of all detections (Figure 3) , and CoV was frequently (17.2%) detected. R/E and PIV were detected at lower levels ( Table 2 ). Across years, there were significant differences in the composition of viruses detected in LTCF residents (c 2 ¼ 71.663; df ¼ 12; P < .001). For example, hMPV varied between 0% (2016-2017) and 37.8% (2018-2019) of annual detections.
