Among 137 specimens from patients with clinical suspected SARS in epidemic period (Table 1) , 101 were collected from patients confirmed to have SARS CoV infections on the basis of sero-conversion. None of the common viral pathogens including influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1,2, and 3 RSV, and adenovirus was detected among 64 respiratory specimens. Using seroconversion as the gold standard for SARS diagnosis, the WHO first generation RT-PCR assay (WHO-HKU) exhibited a sensitivity of 72% (respiratory specimens), 72% (stool), and 59% (urine) with a 100% specificity for all specimens. Sensitivities of Artus and Roche real-time PCR assays were found to be 87% and 85% for respiratory specimens, 91% and 88% for stool, and 82% for urine. A specificity of 100% was exhibited by both real-time PCR assays except Artus attained only a 92% specificity for stool. For real-time PCR assays, viral RNA detected in clinical samples ranged from 0.13 to 10 6 copies for Artus and 0.44 to 10 8 copies for Roche assays. In Fig. 1 , high concordance of results was exhibited by both real-time PCR assays for 134 specimens ( ). Artus detected SARS CoV RNA in two specimens ( ) of SARS-confirmed patients at 1.8 and 0.13 copies whereas Roche PCR assay was negative for these two specimens. In another stool specimen (á­¹), Artus and Roche detected SARS CoV RNA at 1.3 and 0 copies; however, the patient was subsequently confirmed SARS negative by seroconversion and clinical presentation. Except for this false positive result exhibited by Artus PCR assay, none of the other sero-negative patient samples and human coronavirus isolates (OC43 and 229E) gave a positive PCR result. After the last reported case of confirmed SARS in early June, the 56 respiratory specimens tested during post-epidemic period were negative by all PCR assays. Based on the internal controls incorporated in each reaction, PCR inhibitors were (Chan et al., 2002) . d Samples positive for other viral pathogens included 8 flu A, 1 adenovirus, and 23 RSV by immunofluorescence (Chan et al., 2002) . detected at 8% and 7% by Artus and Roche real-time PCR assays.
