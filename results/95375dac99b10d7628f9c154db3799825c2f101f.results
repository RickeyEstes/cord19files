We have previously reported that crosslinking of CD13 by certain CD13-specific mAbs induces homotypic aggregation (HA) of U-937 human monocytic cells [17] . The HA is an active phenomenon and not a simple aggregation induced by binding of bivalent mAb 452 molecules to CD13 on different cells, as it does not take place at 4 ∘ C, and is inhibited by pharmacological inhibitors of tyrosine-and mitogenactivated protein kinases and by the glycolysis inhibitor 2deoxyglucose. This phenomenon seems to depend on the epitope recognized by the specific mAb and reflects a change in the adhesive properties of the cell. To study the key players of this process, we generated monoclonal antibodies able to inhibit HA of U-937 cells. We immunized BALB/c mice with U-937 cells previously treated with the HA-inducing anti-CD13 mAb 452. Spleen cells from these mice were fused with Ag-8 myeloma cells, and the resulting hybridomas were selected on the basis of the ability of the secreted mAbs to inhibit HA induced by mAb 452. For the screening, the supernatants of the hybridomas were incubated with U-937 cells in 96-well plates (10 5 cells/well), for 60 min before addition of the HAinducing mAb 452. After 2 h of incubation at 37 ∘ C, the degree U-937 cells were incubated for 2 hrs at 37 ∘ C with anti-CD13 mAb 452 to induce aggregation. Then, inhibitory mAbs C or E or control IgG were added (time = 0), and incubation was continued for 24 h at 37 ∘ C. Percent aggregation was determined after 2, 16, and 24 h, as described above. The graphs represent the arithmetic mean ± SD of five (b) or three (c) independent experiments. * < 0.05; * * * < 0.0001. of aggregation in each individual well was assessed under the microscope. We selected two hybridomas, which produce the antibodies named mAb C (IgG1) and mAb E (IgG2b) that are able to inhibit HA induced by mAb 452 (Figure 1(a) ), for characterization of the effects of the monoclonal antibodies produced.
