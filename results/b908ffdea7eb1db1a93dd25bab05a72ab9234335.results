(A) From statistical and epidemiological analyses in weekly data of active dynamic surveillance of ILI in Shizuoka Prefecture and all Japan for the last 17 years (1986 -2003), differences were found in geographical (prefectural), annual and seasonal (winter and others) and age (generation) distributions [1 -3] . During the past 17 years, with the exception of a few seasons, the influenza pandemics usually started at about week 50 every year, showing the incidences over 1.0 patient per clinical institution, reached the peak at about week 5 of the next year, and ended over 10-15th week in Shizuoka Prefecture as well as all Japan [1] [2] [3] . Two biggest pandemics due to A/H3N2 subtype were seen in the 1989/1990 and 1997/1998 seasons, showing over 1 million (10Â10 5 ) patients with ILI in all Japan. Three bigger pandemics of A/H3N2 subtype were also seen in the 1992/1993, 1994/ 1995 and 1998/1999 seasons, showing over 8Â10 5 patients [1 -3] . (B) The following results [1] [2] [3] were clarified from viral and serological analyses of influenza pandemics in Japan: (1) By viral and genetic analyses of pandemic subtypes of influenza in Shizuoka Prefecture and all Japan in three recent years (1998 -2000) , A/H3N2 and B subtype strains were isolated as one peak with shoulder in 1998/1999 season, however A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 subtype strains were isolated at the same time as a single peak, namely without viral interference, in 1999/2000 season [1 -3] .
