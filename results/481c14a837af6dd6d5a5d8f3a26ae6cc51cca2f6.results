Using viral RNA of A/equine/Kildare/2/2010, the detection limits of the molecular tests, that is conventional RT-PCR, rRT-PCR and RT-LAMP, for EIV were 10 2Á8 EID 50 /ml, 10 2Á1 EID 50 /ml and 10 2Á8 EID 50 /ml, respectively. virus. The detection limit of the other twelve tests was 10 5Á6 EID 50 /ml. The four most sensitive RAD tests and Prorast Flu as an example of a less-sensitive RAD were evaluated in an EI experimental infection study, and their diagnostic sensitivity was compared to those of VI and molecular diagnostic assays. The results obtained by the different assays for the sequential samples collected from the horses experimentally infected with A/equine/Kildare/2/2010 are summarized in Table 2 . The average detection periods for the assays are illustrated in Figure 1 . The mean duration (days) of positive rRT-PCR results was significantly longer than those of all the RAD tests (P < 0Á001 to =0Á034). The mean duration of RT-LAMPpositive results was significantly longer than those of the RAD tests (P < 0Á001 to =0Á011), except for ImmunoAce Flu (P = 0Á05) and Quick chaser Flu A, B (P = 0Á073). The mean duration of conventional RT-PCR-positive results was significantly longer than those of the RAD tests (P < 0Á001 to =0Á025), except for ImmunoAce Flu (P = 0Á087) and Quick chaser Flu A, B (P = 0Á143). The mean duration of positive Prorast Flu results was significantly shorter than those of all the other tests in this study (P < 0Á001 or 0Á011). There was no significant difference in the mean durations of positive results obtained with the molecular assays (P = 0Á502-0Á575). The evaluation of the performances of the most sensitive RAD tests to diagnose EI in field samples is summarized in Table 3 . All rRT-PCR-negative nasopharyngeal samples were negative by the RAD tests. Of the 30 rRT-PCR-positive samples, BD Flu examan detected 22 (73%) and Quick chaser Flu A, B and ImmunoAce Flu detected 20 (67%) as positive. ESPLINE Influenza A&B-N was less sensitive and detected only eight positive samples (27%). Kappa coefficient values indicated a substantial agreement between BD Flu examan, Quick chaser Flu A, B and ImmunoAce Flu and rRT-PCR but only a fair agreement between ESPLINE Influenza A&B-N and rRT-PCR.
