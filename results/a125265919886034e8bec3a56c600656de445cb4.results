After the third round of Delphi panel assessment in September 2007, there was a . 90% agreement on all statements and terminal objectives, and at least 2 of the 3 individuals representing each discipline, and at least 3 of the 4 nurses, were in agreement. This iteration provided the final version of the competencies and terminal objectives, as shown in Table 1 . After discipline-specific feedback was incorporated, a final matrix resulted that listed the competency statements and terminal objectives with notation from each discipline as to whether each statement and/or objective was pertinent to that discipline. This matrix is shown in Table 2 . These results affirm the investigators' working hypothesis that the elements of an infection prevention and control competency training program likely would be consistent across health care worker disciplines. The content for practical application would require specific modifications to address disciplinespecific needs, however.
