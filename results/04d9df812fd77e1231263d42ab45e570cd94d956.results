The literature search identified a total of 1,862 publications. Of those citations, 1,776 were excluded after screening of titles and abstracts, and 86 were retrieved for full-text screening. Ten publications were included in this report, and the remaining 76 articles were excluded ( Figure S1 ). The reasons for exclusion were an inappropriate study design, intervention, comparator, or outcome, and inappropriate patient population. Ten non-randomized studies were identified, including five relevant case-control studies [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] and five retrospective cohort studies [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . One study [22] was published in Chinese language and was translated by a CADTH researcher. No relevant systematic reviews, meta-analyses, or randomized controlled trials were identified.
