EA.hy926 is a promising target to screen autoantigens. Six cell lines were cultured, developed as a cell-chip and used to prescreen the patients' sera to select a good candidate cell line for the identification of a membrane antigen. HUVEC showed positive binding signals to patient sera, which confirmed the presence of AECAs in BD patients. However, other cells also had abundant fluorescence signals, suggesting that these cells may be new autoantibody targets (Fig. 1a, b) . Fluorescent differences and the fluorescence staining result without nucleus among the six cell lines were quantified using Image J software (Fig. 1c) . The intense membrane staining of the EA.hy926 makes this cell line a good candidate for the identification of a membrane antigen. Identification of new autoantigens. ELISAs of EA.hy926 membrane antigens with serum samples from 90 BD patients were investigated to select subjects containing large number of AECAs. Five subjects from all the BD patients that presented relatively higher optical density values were selected for further analysis (Fig. 2a) . Then protein immunoblot was performed to display the putative binding target. Detection of autoantibodies binding to EA.hy926 antigens was observed and IgG autoantibodies to a 36-kDa cell antigen were detected in 3 of 5 BD patients, but no binding signal was detected for the healthy controls (Fig. 2b) . The newly identified 36-kDa autoantigen was cut from a polyacrylamide gel and digested with trypsin. The peptide fragments were identified using LC-MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometry and then analyzed using the Mascot bioinformatics database to obtain the amino acid sequence of all the detective proteins. It was shown that the target protein shared the most significant sequence homology with annexin A2 (estimated molecular weight/pI, 38780/7.57; NCBI accession number, gij18645167; Mascot score, 606; matched unique peptides, 19) , which was accurately determined with over 95% confidence interval (.95 C.I.%) indicating credible results (Fig. 2c) . Annexin A2 protein is a new autoantigen of BD. The selected target protein was obtained by recombinant DNA technology, and sequenced by mass spectrometry. Then using Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and competitive immunofluorescence to confirm the protein is a real autoantigen of BD in succession. First, expression and purification of the recombinant human annexin A2 protein were performed (Fig. 3a, b) ; the purified annexin A2 protein was confirmed using mass spectrometry (Fig. 3c ) and Western blotting with purified mouse anti-human annexin A2 monoclonal antibodies in succession (data not shown). Second, immunoprecipitation was performed to determine whether the detected antigen was a real autoantigen of BD. As shown in Fig. 3d -f, the band for the annexin A2 was clearly present in the immunoprecipitates, indicating that annexin A2 was indeed an autoantigen of BD that is present in patients' blood circulation. Furthermore, competitive immunofluorescence assays were also used to analyze the inhibitory activity of the annexin A2 protein ( Fig. 3 g-i) . It was shown that the recombinant human annexin A2 protein could significantly reduce the binding activity of BD patient sera in vitro, which further proved that the anti-annexin A2 antibodies were found in the blood circulation of BD patients. The prevalence of anti-annexin A2 autoantibodies. To further investigate the role of annexin A2, the correspondence anti-annexin A2 ELISA was developed using the purified recombinant antigen. The anti-annexin A2 antibodies were detected in 31 of 90 BD patients (34%), 6 of 92 SLE patients (7%), 7 of 90 SS patients (8%), and 1 of 111 HC (,1%). The reactivity of sera IgG against human recombinant annexin A2 in BD patients was higher than that in SLE, SS and apparently healthy individuals (P,0.0001) (Fig. 4a) . The correlation analysis of annexin A2 and HSP60 antibodies. The possible molecular interactions with annexin A2 during the process of BD were analyzed by ELISAs for the correlationship between annexin A2 and HSP60 (Fig. 4b) . The optical densities obtained from sera against recombinant human annexin A2 were correlated with those against recombinant human HSP60 in BD patients (R 2 50.3493, P,0.0001) and in SLE patients (R 2 50.0320, P50.0814). Expression and localization of annexin A2 in human tissues. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the differences in protein expression in human umbilical vein/artery, squamous cell lung cancer, and kidney cancer tissue samples. The results showed that annexin A2 was specifically expressed in human umbilical vein/ artery vascular endothelial cells and not in other cells of the vessel (Fig. 5a, b) . High expression of annexin A2 was clearly observed in human squamous cell lung cancer and kidney cancer tissue (Fig. 5c , d). These results are consistent with the data of Western blotting analysis, which also showed that the expression of annexin A2 in EA.hy926 cells was the highest among all the cells tested, followed by A549 cells and HUVEC (data not shown). The staining with commercial annexin A2 monoclonal antibodies in human umbilical vein/artery tissues ( Fig. 6 ) was consistent with the antiannexin A2 antibody-positive BD patients' sera. Put together, these results further show the annexin A2 as a real AECA autoantigen of BD. Clinical significance in BD patients. The correlationship between annexin A2 and clinical symptoms which involvement in BD patients was analyzed. Among the 90 BD patients, 31 subjects showed a positive reaction with the recombinant human annexin A2 protein. By comparing the clinical information between the 31 anti-annexin A2 antibody-positive and other 59 -negative subjects, vascular involvement was approximately four times higher in the anti-annexin A2 antibody-positive group. For all other clinical symptoms, no significant differences were observed. The detailed clinical information of all BD patients was analyzed and summarized in Fig. 7 .
