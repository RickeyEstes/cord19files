The PACA particles exert differential cytotoxicity and induction of heat shock proteins PACA particles with only minor differences in their cyanoacrylate side chains ( Figure 1B) were produced by in situ polymerization of the alkylcyanoacrylate monomers butyl-(PBCA), ethylbutyl-(PEBCA), or octyl-cyanoacrylate (POCA) as previously described [11, 12] . The resulting particles exhibited similar mean sizes, in the range of 133-153 nm, with a relatively narrow size distribution. All three NPs were slightly negatively charged with a zeta-potential of approximately -3 mV ( Figure 1B ). When particle cytotoxicity was compared across a panel of cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, SW480, Huh7, HCT116, MCF7, and HeLa) the POCA particles consistently exerted the highest cytotoxicity, whereas PEBCA particles were the least toxic ( Figure 1C ). This is in agreement with our previous screening study with a set of 12 other cancer cell lines [11] . Importantly, we have found that this pattern of cytotoxicity is not caused by gross differences in cellular uptake of the particles [11, 18] . To assess whether the differential PACA cytotoxicity is caused by particle-specific induction of cellular stress responses, we focused on the triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 that displayed the largest diversity in particle cytotoxicity ( Figure 1C ). We first assessed whether the PACA particles would induce accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, a hallmark of altered cellular homeostasis [7] . When cells were treated with 25 Âµg/ml (an intermediary concentration with respect to cytotoxicity at 24 hours) of each variant of PACA NPs, a buildup of ubiquitinated proteins was observed within the first 4 hours of treatment in all cell lines tested ( Figure 1D Figure 1B) . The PACA particles also induced increased expression of a wide author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Overall, the PBCA and POCA particles exerted the most potent effect.
