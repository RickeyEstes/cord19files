The binding (Fig. 1 ) of 42 MAbs specific for the Purdue strain of TGE virus (PUR46-CC120-MAD) (Jimenez et a/., 1986; Correa et al., 1988) to 26 strains of coronaviruses (Table 1) indicated that PRCV, FIPV, FECV, and CCV have conserved determinants in the three major structural proteins (S, M, and N). These viruses, isolated from three continents and collected, at least, throughout 42 years have conserved, in the peplomer protein, the antigenic subsite AC, an inducer of TGEV neutralizing antibodies . In contrast, the antigenic sites B, C, and D, which showed a high variability, particularly sites B and C, which are in general present in TGEV isolates, are completely absent in PRCV isolates and in the other coronaviruses analyzed (Fig. 1 ). By neutralization (Table 2) five MAbs (three specific for subsite AC, and the other two of an unknown subsite) neutralized TGEV, PRCV (not shown), FIPV, FECV, and CCV. In contrast, none of the 42 MAbs bound to the other two porcine coronaviruses, PEDV and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), nor to the HCV 229E or the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Fig. 1) . In agreement with these results, none of the 42 MAbs, including those which recognized the epitopes conserved in TGEV, PRCV, FIPV, FECV, and CCV, neutralized the HCV-229E (Table 2) . On the basis of the percentage of antigenic homology of each particular virus isolate, relative to the reference virus (PUR46-CC120-MAD), ( Fig. 1 and Materials and Methods), the coronaviruses studied ( Fig. 1 ) could be classified into four different clusters, with homology percentages between 93 and 100% 69 and 83% 26 and 3096, and 00/o, which include the TGEVs, the PRCVs, the canine and feline isolates, and the other viruses, respectively. While the members of the three first clusters are closely related to one another, an antigenie relationship among the members of the fourth cluster has not been described. These results ( Fig. 1 and Table 2 ) permitted us to define (i) type specific epitopes, which were common to enteric TGEV isolates-e.g., those recognized by MAbs 1 D.Bl2 and 8F.B3; (ii) group specific epitopes, which were common to enteric TGEV and respiratory PRCV isolates-e.g., those defined by MAbs lD.E8, 1 D.E7, and 1 H.D2; and, (iii) interspecies specific epiropes, which were the ones shared by TGEV, PRCV, and coronavirus antigenically related to TGEV from other species (feline and canine)-e.g., MAbs 1 B.B5, lA.FlO, 6A.C3, and 8B.E3. As no TGEV-specific MAb recognized the HCV 229E, it was studied (Fig. 2) (100). The characteristics of the viruses used are summarized in Table 1 . The specificity of the MAbs is named according to Correa et al. (1988) . Symbols: Cl. 0 to 30; q 31 to 50; n . 51 to 100. The antigenic homology of each virus isolate relative to the reference virus PUR46-CC120-MAD (see Materials and Methods) was expressed in percentage. The anti-virus sera were TGEV specific in the case of TGEV, PRCV, FIPV, FECV, and CCV, and specific for the homologous virus, in the case of PEDV, HEV, HCV 229E, and MHV. sera, specific for the structural proteins of each virus, bound to both virions. In addition, the recognition of the serologically unrelated MHV by these antisera was determined. The TGEV-specific antiserum strongly bound to the homologous virus but it did not recognize, or recognized weakly, the HCV 229E and the MHV, respectively (Figs. 2A, 2B, and 2C). The HCV 229E specific antiserum recognized with high and low titer the homologous and the murine virus, respectively, and, to a minor extent, the TGEV (Fig. 2D) . By preadsorbing the serum with ST cells, or with these cells and the HELF cells (Figs. 2E and 2F, respectively), the recognition of TGEV was extensively diminished and the binding to the MHV decreased, while the homologous reactivity was conserved. In agreement with the binding studies, the unadsorbed or the preadsorbed antisera specific for TGEV and HCV 229E neutralized the homologous virus more than 1 03-fold, while the heterologous virus was neutralized less than 3-fold (results not shown). As TGEV showed antigenic variability in viva, it was determined if a virus variant could become predominant in the virus population by passage in cells in culture. Three clones of TGE virus (PUR46-CC 120-MAD, PUR46-CC120-PLO, and SHl56-CC83)were passaged Designation8 Origin (Year of isolation) (1946) Purdue University (1946) Purdue University (1946) Minnesota (1949) USA (1965 or early) USA (unknown) Japan (1956) Japan (1956) Japan (1956) France (1979) Spain (1988) England (1986) England (1986) The Netherlands (1987) Belgium (1985) Belgium (1987) Belgium (1987) Belgium (1987) Belgium (1987) Belgium (1987) Iowa ( "The first three letters of the virus nomenclature generally indicate the geographical origin or have been taken from its widely accepted name.

In order to differentiate sera from animals infected with TGEV or PRCV, two type specific MAbs, 1 D.612 and 8F.B3, could be used in a competitive RIA, as these MAbs bound to all strains of TGEV tested but not to the PRCV isolates (Fig. 1) . Sera from animals infected with any of these two viruses inhibited the binding (Fig. 3A ) of a '251-labeled MAb (6A.C3), directed to an interspecies specific epitope (Fig. l) , while only the sera from animals infected with TGEV inhibited the binding of the TGEV specific MAb 1 D.Bl2 (Fig. 3A) . When 93 field sera samples were studied, all were positive for PRCV virus in the RIA (titers between 3 X lo* and 104) and by neutralization (decreased 1O2.8 to >l 05-fold virus infectivity), and also were positive against TGEV, both by RIA (titers between 3 X 10' and 9 x 1 03) and by neutralization (decreased 1 03.3-to > 1 06-fold virus infectivity) (results not shown). In contrast, only the field sera from TGEV positive farms inhibited both the site-A and -B specific MAbs (Fig. 3B) , confirming that MAb 1 D.Bl2 could be used to distinguish TGEV and PRCV isolates.
