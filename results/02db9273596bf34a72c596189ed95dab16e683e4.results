Of 3,345 eligible patients, we enrolled a total of 2,873 (85. Correlations of ITDS and oral temperatures were similar for OptoTherm (ρ = 0.43) and FLIR (ρ = 0.42) but signifi cantly lower for Wahl (ρ = 0.14; p<0.001). The areas under the ROC curves (AUC) for OptoTherm (96.0%) and FLIR (92.0%) were not signifi cantly different but were signifi cantly greater than the AUC of Wahl (78.2%; p<0.001; Figure 1 ). At their respective optimal threshold temperatures, sensitivities of fever detection of the 3 ITDS were not signifi cantly different from each other, but specifi cities and PPVs of OptoTherm and FLIR were signifi cantly higher than those of Wahl (Table 1 ; p<0.001). At fi xed specifi cities, the sensitivities of each ITDS varied ( Figure 2 ). Compared with oral thermometry, sensitivity for selfreported fever was 75%, specifi city was 84.7%, and PPV was 10.1%. Sensitivities of the 3 ITDS at their respective optimal thresholds did not differ signifi cantly from that of self-reported fever (Table 1) . However, specifi cities and PPVs of OptoTherm and FLIR at optimal thresholds were signifi cantly greater than those of self-reported fever (p<0.001 for both comparisons), and specifi city and PPV of Wahl were signifi cantly lower than those of self-reported fever (p<0.001). The addition of self-report decreased the accuracy of fever detection at optimal thresholds for FLIR and OptoTherm (increase in sensitivity was less than decrease in specifi city) but improved accuracy for Wahl with a greater increase in sensitivity than the decrease in specifi city (Table 1) . Conversely, adding OptoTherm or FLIR temperature measurements to self-reported fever increased accuracy, but adding Wahl temperature measurements decreased accuracy (Table 1) . Bivariate analyses revealed higher oral and ITDS temperatures among younger patients and later in the day ( Table 2 ). Oral temperatures were higher in women, and ITDS temperature measurements were higher in men. ITDS temperature measurements increased with increasing room temperatures. Temperatures detected by oral thermometers, OptoTherm, and FLIR were higher in patients who reported recent antipyretic or analgesic drug use. When we controlled for study site, multivariate analyses showed that 2 variables (sex and room temperature) were most strongly (p<0.001) associated with the size of the gap between oral and ITDS temperature measurements (Table 3 ). Smaller differences between ITDS and oral temperatures were found among men than among women. Differences between ITDS and oral temperatures became smaller with increasing room temperatures and as the day progressed (with the exception of FLIR). Site-specifi c effects indicated that, on average, differences between ITDS and oral temperatures were smaller among participants from Albuquerque and Atlanta than among those from Chicago. With the exception of Wahl measurements, the difference between ITDS and oral temperatures was greater in older patients. Differences between oral and OptoTherm temperatures tended to be smaller for those reporting antipyretic drug use.
