A total of 3693 pregnant women were enrolled in the study from April 2011 to April 2013. Altogether, 3505 of the 3646 live-born infants were followed up for 1157.9 PY. A total of 4223 ARI episodes were detected in these infants, of which HCoV was detected in 296 swabs from 282 (8%) infants. These 296 HCoVpositive swabs included 103 swabs positive for HCoV-OC43, 78 positive for HCoV-HKU1, 70 for HCoV-NL63, and 19 for HCoV-229E. Species could not be determined for 26 HCoVpositive swabs. Fourteen repeat HCoV infections were also observed. Among these, 2 infants had 3 HCoV infections each in the course of the study. Median follow-up time overall was 175 days (interquartile range, 167-179 days) for an infant, and 53% of infants were followed through 180 days. Characteristics of the infants by HCoV and ARI status are shown in Tables 1 and  2 . Overall HCoV incidence among infants was 255.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 227.3-286.5) per 1000 PY. The incidence per 1000 PY of the HCoV species was as follows: HCoV-NL63: 59.6 (95% CI, 46.4-75.4), HCoV-OC43: 87.2 (95% CI, 71.1-106.0), HCoV-HKU1: 65.6 (95% CI, 51.7-82.2), and HCoV-229E: 16.4 (95% CI, 9.9-25.6). Seasonal variation of HCoV infections was observed, with the overall incidence peaking in 2 winters and 1 autumn. The highest incidence was observed in the autumn of 2011 at around 750 per 1000 PY (Supplementary Figure 1) . Seasonality also varied among the HCoV species. HCoV-NL63 circulated every year of the study period and peaked around the autumn months. In contrast, HCoV-OC43 circulated in 2012 and 2013, and peaked around spring and late winter, respectively. Additionally, HCoV-HKU1 showed peak activity during winter of 2012, whereas HCoV-229E mainly occurred in early and late 2012 ( Figure 1 ). Cough, fever, and wheeze were the most common clinical symptoms ( Figure 2 ). Crowding in a household (number of children <5 years of age per room) was also associated with an increased risk of HCoV infection (IRR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.28). In addition, poorer households were seen to be at increased risk compared to wealthier households. An increased risk was observed among infants who were SGA and preterm compared to those who were AGA and at term, but this was not statistically significant. Being born in the monsoon season or infected between June and August lowered the risk of HCoV compared to other times of the year. No association was seen between HCoV incidence and LBW, maternal age, literacy, smoking status, caste, and the indoor pollution score. In a multivariate model comparing HCoV-positive cases with HCoV-negative individuals (model 1), the risk factors that were significant included infant age, the number of children <5 years of age per room, and birth outside the summer-monsoon season (Table 3 ). In the model comparing HCoV positive cases with other ARI cases that were HCoV negative, the factors that were significant were infant age and monsoon season birth. As season of birth and season of infection were highly correlated, season of birth was selected for inclusion in the multivariate models. Coinfections with at least 1 other respiratory virus in the swab was seen in 137 of 296 HCoV infections (46%
