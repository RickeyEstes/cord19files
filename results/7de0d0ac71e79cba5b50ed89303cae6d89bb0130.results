Data collection, preprocessing, and the twelve judges In this study, we analyzed the RNA expression levels of 88 genes in spleen, mesenteric lymph node and PBMCs of macaques acutely infected with SIV. mRNA levels were quantified using Nanostring, a probe-based technique, and values were normalized by the geometric mean of four housekeeping genes (see S1 Method). The final counts were preprocessed as described next (and in more detail in S2 Method), and the preprocessed data were analyzed using PCA or PLS (more detail in S3 Method and S4 Method). Preprocessing the data had two steps: transformation and normalization. Transformation of raw data can be advantageous when some of the variables in the dataset have extreme measurements (outliers), resulting in a non-normal distribution for these variables. The outliers may exert a large impact on the model and overshadow other measurements. For datasets with non-zero values, one method to alleviate the non-normality of the data is to perform logtransformation [26] . In this manuscript, we either use the original raw data (Orig) or perform log 2 -transformation on the data (Log2). Normalization of the data is common because the typical amount and the range of expression for each gene in the datasets can vary substantially. This can significantly affect analyses attempting to identify which genes are key during the acute SIV infection. The type of normalization used alters the type of gene expression changes that are assumed to be significant, which in turn is related to how these gene expression changes can affect the immune response. In this work, we use three preprocessing methods: (1) Mean-centering (MC) subtracts the average value from each measurement to set the mean of the data to zero (Fig 1B) . The MC normalization method emphasizes the genes with the highest absolute variations in mRNA measurements across animals; (2) Unit-variance scaling (UV) divides the mean-centered variables by their standard deviation, resulting in unit variance variables (Fig 1B) . The UV normalization method is a popular method that gives equal weight to each variable in the dataset; (3) Coefficient of variation scaling (CV) divides each variable by its mean and subtracts one (Fig 1B) . This gives each variable the same mean, but a variance equal to the square of the coefficient of variation of the original variable. This method emphasizes the genes with the highest relative changes in mRNA measurements. For a worked example illustrating the difference between the types of gene changes to which each normalization method is responsive, see S2 Method. Each of our 12 judges is a combination of a preprocessing method (transformation and normalization) and a multivariate analysis technique, i.e. a judge can be represented by an ordered triple (x, y, z) where x takes its value from {Orig, Log2}, y takes its value from {MC, UV, CV}, and z takes its value from {PCA, PLS} ( Fig 1A) . Therefore, there are 12 distinct judges in our analysis. We use Ã to denote all the possible options for a particular triple element; for example, (Log2, Ã , PCA) defines all the judges that use log 2 -transformation and the PCA analysis method. In this work, the dataset for each tissue (spleen, MLN, PBMC) was analyzed by all 12 judges, forming the Multiplexed Component Analysis algorithm.
