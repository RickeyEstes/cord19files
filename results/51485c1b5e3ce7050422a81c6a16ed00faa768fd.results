The study population consisted of 54 children, 0.20-12.0 years old (mean ± SE: 4.67 ±0.39 years). There were 32 males (59.25%) and 22 females (40.75%). The duration of their hospitalization was 2.0-15.0 days (mean ± SE: 5.42 ±0.42 days). The majority of them presented cough (44/54, 81.50%), and fever (53/54, 98.15%). Admission body temperature was variable, ranging between 36.2°C and 41.0°C (mean ± SE: 37.96 ±0.17°C). Fever was present for 0-15 days (4.24 ±0.43 days) before entrance to the hospital, and lasted for 0.0-11.0 days (2.75 ±0.27 days) after admission day. Moreover, cough was present 0.0-10.0 days before hospitalization (mean ± SE: 4.10 ±0.43 days) in children with pneumonia. Nasal congestion and abdominal pain were described in about one third of them (16/54, 29.60% and 17/54, 31.50% respectively). Thoracic pain and vomiting were recorded only in 9/54 (16.70%) and 5/54 (9.25%) of them respectively. One third of the children with pneumonia had previously received antibiotics (18/54, 33.33%). Seven children developed pleural effusion. The outcome of all patients was favourable. Laboratory values of both sexes are presented in Table I. There were no statistically significant differences between age of hospitalized children with pneumonia and their sex (p = 0.25) or the presence of abdominal pain (p = 0.27). However, older children (mean age ± SE: 6.93 ±1.11 years) more often (p = 0.01) present thoracic pain compared with younger ones (mean age ± SE: 4.22 ±0.38 years). Moreover, there was no statistically significant difference between the duration of hospitalization and the presence of thoracic (r = -0.96, p = 0.33) or abdominal pain (z = -1.04, p = 0.29). A correlation was found between the duration of hospitalization: a) and the duration of fever after admission (p = 0.004), and b) the value of CRP at admission (p = 0.00). There was also a correlation between the value of serum sodium at admission and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p = 0.02). Furthermore, CRP value and leukocyte count were correlated with admission value of sodium in serum (p = 0.00 and p = 0.006 respectively). Finally, there was a negative association between the degree of hyponatraemia and the length of hospitalization (z = -3.39, p = 0.001). Correlations were also performed between the two sexes concerning their age, days of hospitalization, body temperature at admission (°C), duration of fever before and after admission, duration of cough, respiratory and heart rate at admission, SatO 2 (%) and the value of serum sodium at admission. No statistically significant differences between the two groups were found (Table II) .
