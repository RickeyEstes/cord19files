A total of 12 samples (11 fecal samples and one respiratory specimen) out of 595 taken from 58 French counties, mainly in March/April, was positive for ECoV ( Fig. 1) . Two of the 12 ECoV positive samples were coinfected with cryptosporidium spp.; no other pathogen was associated with ECoV in these samples. The only positive respiratory sample (FRA_2011/2) was collected 3-4 days following the clinical signs from a 9-month-old foal suffering from respiratory infection. This is the first time that the detection of ECoV from a respiratory sample has been described; however, this aspect requires more examination since an etiological role of the agent was not conclusive. All other specimens were associated with enteric diseases in young foals. Four fecal samples were positive in the same county and were all related to an ECoV occurrence. The identification of the index case resulted in the collection of a number of samples in this area. During this occurrence, two ECoV positive fecal samples were collected at a five-week interval from the same adult horse who died subsequently with severe diarrhea. No other pathogen was detected in these samples. Sensitivity of the two qRT-PCRs was evaluated on serial dilution of the extracted RNA from cell culture supernatant of the NC99 strain and with the RNA transcript. The comparison of the two ''M and N qRT-PCRs'' revealed a higher sensitivity of the ''M qRT-PCR''. Of the 12 ECoV positive samples detected by qRT-PCR, 12 were detected with the ''M qRT-PCR'' and 8 with the ''N qRT-PCR''. The ''M qRT-PCR'' produced a linear quantitative detection range of 9 logs with the correlation coefficient R 2 = 0.999 and a slope value of À3.822 (efficiency = 83%), with the lower limit of ECoV detection (RNA transcript) of 3 Â 10 5 copies/ ml. Ct values ranged from 20.1 to 39.6 cycles from fecal samples and had a Ct value of 35.4 cycles in the respiratory specimen. The ''N qRT-PCR'' had a dynamic range of 7 logs with a sensitivity of 3 Â 10 7 copies/ml of RNA transcript, a correlation coefficient (R 2 ) of 0.983, and a slope value of À4.209 (efficiency = 73%). Sequences of partial M and S1 genes were obtained for 5 out of the 12 ECoV positive samples (GenBank accession numbers KC178696-KC178705). Analysis of the partial S1 sequence revealed that nucleotide identities of the French strains ranged from 98.7% to 99.6% compared to the ECoV-NC99 sequence and from 97.2% to 98.1% compared to the Tokachi09 sequence. Phylogenetic trees constructed from partial M and S1 sequences showed that French molecular isolates are phylogenetically closely related to the ECoV-NC99 strain (Fig. 2) . The molecular analysis revealed that none of the French strains had the 185-nucleotide deletion inside the S gene observed in the Tokachi09 strain (7).
