To examine the performance of BBAP and the proposed hybrid assembly strategy, we acquired 12 NGS data sets of HBV viral quasispecies from 7 HBV patient samples [24] . The 12 data sets used for assembly consisted of an average of 21,494,295 101-bp raw reads (RRs), 14,388,844 high quality reads (HQRs, quality score ≧ 20 for all bases; i.e., sequencing error rate = 1%), and 60,228 HRURs (high redundancy unique representative reads; unique representative reads with redundancy ≧ 5, Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S1 ). The optimized parameters for BBAP assembly are listed in Additional file 1: Table S2 . The same parameters were used for all BBAP assemblies in this study unless mentioned otherwise. BBAP de novo assembly of full and partial data sets The de novo assembly of the full data sets (FD) resulted in an average of 46.0 contigs (minimum length of 150 bp) for each library with an average contig length of 321 bp, suggesting that the assembly results were fragmentized (Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S3 ). For de novo assembly of partial data sets (PD) of each data set, five partial data sets were initially randomly generated and assembled independently. Because the PD assembly results of the partial data sets from each library were highly similar (data not shown), a single partial data set and its assembly results were used for representation of the sample in further analyses. The PD assembly yielded fewer number of contigs and longer average maximum contig lengths, indicating the PD assembly results were not as fragmentized as FD assembly. Furthermore, PD assembly required fewer contigs than the FD assembly to span the full genome to recover the full length HBV genome (Fig. 1a , Additional file 2: Figure S1 ). PD assembly also yielded a higher proportion of mapped HRURs (95.9% vs 70.3%) and RiHRURs (reads included in high redundancy unique representative reads, 80.4% vs. 68.7%) than FD, further demonstrating its better assembly efficiency. Fragmentation is possibly due to high polymorphic reads from the same genomic regions recognized by BBAP as different haplotypes and subsequently assembled into separate clusters. The proportion of polymorphic sites in overlapping contig regions of D2_1 FD assembly was 10 times higher than that in non-overlapping regions (0.238 vs. 0.022; p < 10 −10 ). A similar trend was also found in D2_1 PD assembly (Additional file 1: Table S4 ). The shorter FD assembled contigs (<300 bp) had a significantly higher proportion of polymorphic sites than the longer FD assembled contigs (Additional file 2: Figure S2 , Student's t-test, p < 0.05). HRURs that were included or excluded in the partial data sets (for PD assembly) had average redundancies of 1,808X (n = 75,173) and 38X (n = 647,561), respectively, within the full data set. Additionally, the redundancies of the included HRURs in the full and partial data sets were highly correlated (R 2 = 0.9997). This suggests the random selection partial data sets was unbiased and effectively excluded HRURs of low redundancies, resulting in lower polymorphism levels and, in turn, less fragmented assembly results.
