A total of 14,157 patients were screened for study eligibility in the 5 participating clinics. Of the 7269 eligible subjects, a total of 2517 (35%) agreed to participate with 1251 in the intervention group and 1266 in the control group. In the intervention group, 730 (58%) of the subjects had received both the brief telephone intervention and the on-site face-to-face intervention (full compliance), while 521 (42%) received the brief telephone intervention about PPV only (partial compliance). However, an on-site nurse reported that 11 subjects in the control group also had also received the intervention but they remained in the control group by the intention-to-treat principle. A total of 1137 subjects (91%) in the intervention group and 1154 (91%) in the control group were successfully followed up at 1-week (follow up rate of 91%); and 1165 (93%) in the intervention group and 1175 (93%) in the control group at 3-month follow up (follow up rate of 93%) (Fig. 2) . The 3-month follow up was completed in June 2008. The baseline variables between the intervention and control groups were similar (Table 1) . By May 30, 2008, a total of 1325 (53%) subjects received the PPV injection during the study period as recorded in the CMS, with 716 (57%) subjects in the intervention group and 609 (48%) in the control group. The ICC of the CMSrecorded PPV uptake in the study by randomizing the study time in the participating clinics was 0.051. When adjusted for clustering effects using GEE, the adjusted relative risk (ARR) for CMS-recorded PPV uptake associated with the intervention was 1.20 (95% CI = 1.06-1.37). The intervention effect remained significant (ARR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.09-1.45) after treating the 11 patients in the control Telephone briefing one week before the scheduled medical consultation 1. Pneumococcal vaccine is now available free-of-charge at the selected SOPCs/GOPCs 2. You are encouraged to take this vaccination in the upcoming medical consultation at these SOPCs/GOPCs 3. The benefits of taking this vacc ination and possible side effects 4. We will meet you at the scheduled consultation session for further discussion
