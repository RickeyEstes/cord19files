Information from a total of 286,150 samples was analyzed from microbiological testing at the UW Laboratory Medicine Department from 2010 to 2017. Of these, 14,381 samples (5.0%) were removed due to staff testing, computer records testing, and conflicting admission/discharge/collection dates as described above in the Methods. Across all samples for which data were kept, 68.8% of samples had a collection date that was identical to the patient's admission date (Fig. 1A ) . Furthermore, 78.8% of samples were collected within 1 day of the admission date. Of all samples analyzed, only 20 samples (0.01%) were collected more than 1 year from the patient's admission date, 279 (0.1%) more than 180 days from the In order to understand the degree to which additional pieces of sample metadata can affect the ability to more confidently impute patient admission date from sample collection date, we performed additional subgroup analyses based on availability of sample metadata. Viral testing collection dates were more strongly correlated with admission dates than for positive bacterial or fungal culture samples (P-value < 2.2e-16). Across all locations, collection dates were identical to patient admission dates for 79.2% of viral tests, while they were identical for 65.0% of positive bacterial and fungal cultures. Virology test coding did not permit ready identification of only positive test results. To check the impact of examining all virus testing versus only viral positives, we extracted 16,434 unique samples for which the test results field either contained 'positive' or a quantity. In this subset, 14,133 (86.0%) of samples were collected on the same day as the admission date and 14,994 (91.2%) of the samples were collected within 1 day of admission. The distribution of this subset of viral positives was significantly different compared with all virus testing (D ¼ 0.373, P ¼ 4.86e-11). A likely explanation for this phenomena is the increased prevalence of positive samples being collected in the outpatient setting (83.5%) as compared with in the larger dataset (53.1%). These discrepancies can likely be explained by continued monitoring and sampling of patients with chronic viral infections. For example, outpatient clinics may perform routine viral load monitoring in the setting of chronic viral infection. Thus, by examining all viral tests and not just positives we are likely biased toward larger discrepancies between collection date and admission date. We next separated bacterial/fungal and virology testing by the type of patient encounter: inpatient, outpatient, and ED ( Fig. 1B-D) . Unsurprisingly, almost all of the differences between collection date and admission date were due to inpatient testing. Across all inpatient testing, the patient admission date was identical to sample collection date for 22.0% of bacterial samples and 15.4% of viral testing samples. However, sample collection dates were within 30 days of inpatient admission dates for 91.5% of bacterial/fungal samples and 93.0% of viral samples. Presumably, most of the microbiological testing for inpatients in which admission date and collection date matched was ordered from the ED. Across both bacterial and viral samples, 99.7% of outpatient samples and 99.5% of ED samples were collected within 1 day of admission date. For outpatient testing, sample collection dates and patient admission dates were identical for 96.0% of positive bacterial tests and 97.4% of virology tests (Fig. 1C) . Because the majority of discrepancies in collection and admission dates occurred for inpatient testing, we further subdivided inpatient results based on the type of ward from which the sample was collected: intensive care unit (ICU); medicine and medical subspecialities; obstetrics/gynecology (OB/Gyn); or surgery and surgical subspecialities ( Fig. 2A-D) . We were able to classify 90,961 (95.6%) of all 95,188 inpatient samples. Obstetrics and gynecology had the highest percentage of samples collected within 1 day of the admission date at 65.1%, next highest was surgery at 49.0%, followed by medicine at 41.0%, and ICU at 36.3%. Pairwise two-sample KS tests were performed for all combinations of locations. The only significant difference in distributions was between OB/Gyn and all other categories-ICU (D ¼ 0.31, P ¼ 0.002), medicine (D ¼ 0.039, P ¼ 3.619e-05), and surgery (D ¼ 0.317, P ¼ 0.002). All other pairwise comparisons of distributions resulted in P-values > 0.002. We next examined differences between collection and admission dates by patient gender and across time (Fig. 3) . Samples from women were significantly more likely to be collected on the exact admission date (73.7% versus 63.9%, P ¼ 2.2e-16) and closer to the admission date (D ¼ 0.089916, P ¼ 0.0137) than those from men. All-by-all pairwise two-sample KS testing for cumulative distribution by year was also performed and Bonferroni corrected for 15 total tests. The lowest Bonferroni-corrected P-value obtained was 0.105 indicating that distributions were not significantly different year-by-year.
