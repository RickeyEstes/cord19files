Distribution of α2,3 and α2,6 Linked Sialic Acids in MOC-Du, MOC-Ch, and MOC-Tu Overall, the mucosal surface of the magnum was dominated by α2,3 linked sialic acids in all investigated species (Figure 1) . α2,3 linked sialic acids were evenly distributed on the magnum epithelial surface of MOC-Du, MOC-Ch, and MOC-Tu in a comparable manner, although assessment was made only visually. Differences were observed in the expression pattern of α2,6 linked sialic acids between the MOC of the different species. MOC-Du showed the most abundant expression of α2,6 linked sialic acids followed by MOC-Tu and MOC-Ch (Figure 1) . MOC-Tu showed faint but reproducible staining of only a few cells, which was different to the staining pattern of α2,3 linked sialic acids and was not located on the epithelial surface but more basolateral, the precise location cannot be determined with this staining procedure.
