Studies investigating the selection of reference genes for normalizing qRT-PCR experiments in AcMNPV-infected Sf21 cells are limited. To evaluate the potential of seven candidate reference genes, RNA levels of these genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR in two technical replicates of each of four biological replicates in mock-and AcMNPV-infected Sf21 cells over time.
