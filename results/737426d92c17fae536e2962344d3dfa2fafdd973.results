Weekly incidence rates of CRD, diarrhoea and other infectious disease (all recorded cases), and weekly proportions of S-Hp samples taken from 1 to 8 weeks of age are shown in Fig. 1 . Among all 833 calves, S-Hp ranged from 0.05 to 2.25 (median: 0.07) g/L. Calves with CRD within 14 days prior to sampling (n = 153) had a median of 0.09 (80% central range: 0.04-0.69) g/L, calves with diarrhoea within 10 days prior to sampling (n = 57) a median of 0.07 (80% central range: 0.04-0.63) g/L, calves with other infectious disease within 10 days prior to sampling (n = 12) a median of 0.09 (80% central range, 0.05-0.48) g/L, and calves without CRD within 14 days before sampling or diarrhoea or other infectious disease within 10 days before sampling (n = 630) a median of 0.06 (80% central range: 0.04-0.23). One hundred and fifty-three calves (18.4%) had CRD within 14 days before sampling, 57 (6.84%) had diarrhoea within 10 days before sampling, and 12 (1.44%) other infectious disease within 10 days before sampling. The herdlevel incidence of CRD within 14 days before sampling ranged from 2.9% to 31% (median 17%), diarrhoea within 10 days before sampling from 0.97% to 12% (median: 6.7%) and other infectious disease within 10 days before sampling from 0% to 3.2% (median: 0.97%). Heifer calves (n = 391) had a median S-Hp of 0.07 (80% central range: 0.04-0.39) g/L and 16% of them had CRD test . In bull calves (n = 442), median S-Hp was 0.06 (80% central range: 0.04-0.26) g/L and 20% had CRD test . Calves with a normal rectal temperature (639.5°C; n = 664) had a median S-Hp of 0.06 (80% central range: 0.04-0.13) g/L and 13% had CRD test . In calves with fever (>39.5°C; n = 165), median S-Hp was 0.12 (80% central range: 0.04-0.88) g/L and 42% had CRD test . (HP(T+); Fig. 2b ) than in those with normal rectal temperature (HP(TÀ); Fig. 2a) . Also, sensitivities were generally somewhat higher and specificities generally lower in bull calves than in heifers (not shown). Test optima were obtained at S-Hp cut-off values between 0.06 and 0.15 g/ L for the HP test (Se: 0.54-0.69; Sp: 0.59-0.71; Fig. 2a and b), between 0.08 and 0.15 g/L for the HP/TEMP test (Se: 0.65-0.72; Sp: 0.69-0.73; Fig. 2c ) and at 0.05 g/L for the HP+TEMP test (Se: 0.42-0.57; Sp: 0.84-0.91; Fig. 2d ). For the TEMP test, Se was 0.49-0.60 and Sp 0.78-0.84. Fig. 3 shows an example of a ROC curve, based on the HP/ TEMP test, which performed best with sensitivities >0.48 and specificities >0.35 throughout the studied S-Hp cutoff range. Table 1 summarises the discriminative ability of the different tests, showing the AUC and minimum distances from the ROC curve to the upper left corner of the diagram for different sexes and rectal temperatures. At the observed overall CRD test prevalence of 18%, the predictive value (at the optimum cut-off) was 0.35 for a positive HP/ TEMP test and 0.90 (bulls) to 0.92 (heifers) for a negative test. Assuming the CRD test prevalence to change from 10% to 50%, the predictive value (at the optimum cut-off) increased by 49-50% units for a positive and dropped by 25-27% units for a negative test. In models of herd prevalence, the association between the proportion of CRD test -positives and the proportion of test-positives was substantially stronger in heifers than in bull calves. The herd-level r was 0.40 and 0.68 for the HP test, 0.41 and 0.81 for the HP/TEMP test, 0.44 and 0.95 for the HP+TEMP test, and 0.33 and 0.77 for the TEMP test, for bulls and heifers respectively. Fig. 4 shows the relationship between the proportion of calves with CRD test (on the logit scale) and the proportion of HP/ TEMP test positive bull and heifer calves, respectively (cut-off at 0.08 g/L in bulls and 0.15 g/L in heifers). In this case, the model predicted a 1.3-fold increase in the odds of a bull calf having CRD test and a 1.9-fold increase of a heifer for every increase by 10% units of test-positive calves in the herd.
