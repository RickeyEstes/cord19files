HRSV infection can result in a severe infection in children requiring hospitalization. To investigate the effects of HRSV infection in this patient group, nasopharyngeal aspirates that had been taken for routine diagnostic purposes, were analyzed using quantitative proteomics and RNAseq. These data were also compared to the same analysis on nasopharyngeal aspirates taken from a control group of children, who were negative (at the time of sampling) for HRSV. For the children infected with HRSV, samples were analyzed from children with different viral loads at the time of sampling, and these were then grouped into three arbitrary categories; low viral load (Ct > 25) (n = 7), medium viral load (Ct = 20-25) (n = 3), and high viral load (Ct < 20) (n = 2).
