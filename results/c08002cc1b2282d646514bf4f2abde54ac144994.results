Expression of EBOV GP does not increase the pathogenicity of the NDV vector in poultry or mice Recombinant NDV expressing the Zaire EBOV GP (rLa-EBOVGP) was generated by inserting the EBOV GP gene between the P and M genes in the genomic cDNA of the NDV LaSota strain (rLa) ( Figure 1A) . Expression of the GP gene was confirmed by indirect confocal immunofluorescent staining of rLa-EBOVGP-infected BHK-21 cells. rLa-EBOVGP-infected BHK-21 cells were stained with mouse anti-EBOV GP antiserum, whereas rLa-infected BHK-21 cells were not stained with the antiserum ( Figure 1B) . NDV antigens and EBOV GP protein colocalized on the surfaces of the BHK-21 cells, confirming the surface expression of the EBOV GP protein in the rLa-EBOVGP-infected BHK-21 cells ( Figure 1B ). rLa-EBOVGP showed similar growth properties to those of rLa, with a maximum titer of 10 9.6 Ã— 50% embryo infectious doses (EID 50 ) at 72 h after inoculation in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken eggs. rLa-EBOVGP retained its low pathogenicity, as a lentogenic strain, in eggs and chickens [44] , with a mean death time (MDT) > 140 h, an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) of 0, and an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of 0. During the three-week observation period after the mice were inoculated either intramuscularly (i.m.) or intranasally (i.n.) with a high dose of rLa-EBOVGP, they showed no signs of sickness or death, and did not differ in weight gain from the mice inoculated with rLa. These results suggest that the expression of EBOV GP does not increase the pathogenicity of the NDV vector in poultry or mice.
