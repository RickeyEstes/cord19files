cDNA cloning and sequencing of DlssE RNA To understand the primary structure of DlssE RNA, DlssE-specific cDNA clones were generated according to the general method of Gubler and Hoffman (1983) using oligo(dT) as a primer and gel-purified DlssE RNA. Since previous oligonucleotide fingerprinting analysis suggested that DlssE RNA contains the leader sequence and the 5' end region of genomic sequence (Makino et al., 1985) cDNA clones were screened by colony hybridization using 5' end-labeled, leader-specific 72-mer, and two cDNA clones F82 and C96, which correspond to the 5' end of genomic RNA of MHV-JHM . Several large cDNA clones were isolated and their structure was further analyzed. A diagram representing the structure of the DlssE genome and that of MHV-JHM genomic RNA and the strategy used for sequencing the cDNA clones are shown in Fig. 2 . The DlssE sequence obtained is shown in Fig. 3 . Sequence analysis of DlssE cDNA clones revealed that DlssE RNA consists of three different regions of MHV-JHM genomic RNA. The first region represents 864 nucleotides from the 5' end of the genomic RNA. The second region, 748 nucleotides in length, is a region within the polymerase gene that corresponds to the region at 3.3 to 4 kb from the 5' end of genomic RNA (Shieh, unpublished observation) , and the third region contains a sequence of 601 nucleotides derived from the extreme 3'end of the genomic RNA. The entire sequence of DlssE RNA is identical to that of the corresponding regions of MHV genomic RNA Shieh et a/., unpublished data) , with some exceptions in the leader sequence region (see below). The cDNA clones obtained does not appear to have a complete sequence at its extreme 5' end. To understand the complete 5' end sequence of DlssE, we performed primer-extension studies on DlssE RNA using a specific primer (5'~AATGTCAGCACTATGACA-3') complementary to nucleotides 123-140 from the 5' end of the genome of MHV-JHM . The Ei'end-labeled primer was hybridized to gel-purified DlssE RNA and extended with reverse transcriptase. Primer extension products were then analyzed by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 M urea. As shown in Fig. 4A , two cDNA products of 136 and 131 nucleotides were obtained, indicating heterogeneity at the 5'end sequence of DlssE. These primerextended products were sequenced by the Maxam-Gilbert method. The sequences of both cDNA products were identical except that the faster migrating cDNA products contained three UCUAA repeats at the 3'end of the leader sequence, while the slower migrating species contained four UCUAA repeats (Fig. 4B ). In addition, the 5'end sequences of DlssE and MHV-JHM genomic RNA showed several differences. Within the leader sequence, 3 bases were substituted in DlssE RNA (Fig. 4B , asterisks) and nine nucleotides (UUUAU-AAAC) were deleted in DlssE at the junction between the leader RNA and the remaining genomic sequences. The significance of the heterogeneity in the number of UCUAA repeats and of the nine-nucleotide deletion will be discussed below.
