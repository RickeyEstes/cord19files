The relationship of raw output value to PPV is shown for each of the four methods in Figure 2 . The point at which PPV is very close to 1 (where 95% of results are true positives) is ~41,000 reads for Kraken, ~2,800 reads for LMAT, ~38% abundance for MetaPhlAn, and 0.21 for SIANN. For SIANN this means that having 38% of the species-unique genome covered by reads resulted in the vast majority of calls being accurate. .

For example, while each read that is assigned by LMAT and Kraken fall above a certain cutoff for speciesspecificity, some individual reads may be much more specific than others. One could identify a read that aligns to a single species of bacteria with 100% accuracy over its 300bp length, with the next closest match being only 90% similar. It is extremely unlikely that a 300bp exact match would arise due to random chance, and so the user could say with confidence that the organism of interest is found within the sequence data (not considering contamination, horizontal gene transfer, etc). However, such an approach is not currently implemented in an automated method, and many of the steps needed to make that assertion are performed manually by a domain expert, including alignment to near neighbors and ensuring that the read does not fall within a transposon, plasmid, etc. Therefore, while one could say that a single read is all that is needed to state with high PPV that an organism is present, the amount of reads assigned in an automated manner needed to achieve that level of PPV will number in the thousands (Fig 2) . Table 2 ), and each program (boxes at top), across a maximum of 50 replicates (indicated by the size of each point). Note that the reference database for MetaPhlAn does not include viruses, and the reference database for Kraken does not include RNA viruses (e.g., Hanta virus). .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/001727 doi: bioRxiv preprint The next phase of benchmarking was to determine how many raw input reads were needed to achieve the threshold for high PPV. To demonstrate this we plotted the known abundance of each spike organism against the PPV value generated by each method (Figure 3 ). Each point (an organism at a known level of abundance) is comprised of a maximum of 50 replicates, where the diameter of each point increases with an increasing number of replicates. For demonstration purposes we are showing two pairs of bacteria and three viruses. Recall that for each of the pairs of bacteria (and the two poxviruses) any sample containing one did not contain the other (as shown in Table 1 ). The empty boxes result from the organisms not being called at any abundance. For MetaPhlAn, that is a result of no viruses being included in the version of the reference database available for this analysis. Kraken assigned no reads to Hanta virus because viral RNA genomes were not included in this version of the reference database (personal communication with D. Wood). This emphasizes the point that a) the ability to create custom databases targeting organisms of interest can be valuable, and b) the performance of any method must be benchmarked against each potential target of interest. All methods were able identify the bulk of organisms in their databases at high abundances (75% and 18%, Figure 3 ), however performance varied considerably at lower abundances and depended on the particular organism and method used. SIANN detected each organism at high confidence, even at levels as low as 0.3% and 0.07% of the total.
