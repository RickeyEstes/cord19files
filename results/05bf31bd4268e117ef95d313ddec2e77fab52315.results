During the RAT and mPCR periods, 1132 and 149 patients were analyzed. The backgrounds of the two groups are presented in Table 1 . During the mPCR period, 210 mPCR tests were performed. Among these 210 patients, 21 cases were discharged upon receipt of the mPCR results. Among the 189 hospitalized patients, the primary diagnoses of 38 cases were not respiratory infections, and 2 patients had prophylactic antimicrobials for other reasons. Therefore, 149 patients were finally analyzed in the mPCR group (Fig. 1) . The primary and secondary outcomes are shown in Table 2 . The DOT/case was 12.82 vs 8.56 (p < 0.001), and the LOS was 8.18 vs 6.83 days (p ¼ 0.032) in the RAT and mPCR groups. The total costs during admissions in the RAT and mPCR groups were \258,824 ($2331.7) and \243,841 ($2196.8)/case, respectively. The hospitalization costs were \157,776 ($1421.4) and \142,811 ($1286.6). The social costs were \96,683 ($871.0) and \80,708 ($727.1). The test costs were \4365 ($39.3) and \20,323 ($183.1)/case, respectively. Microbiological detection rates were 30.2% vs 87.2% (p < 0.001). More than one pathogen was detected in 27 patients (18.1%) in the mPCR group. The detected pathogens are presented in Fig. 2 . The values are shown as the average value ± standard deviation. CRP; C-reactive protein, URI; upper respiratory tract infection (including tonsillitis and sinusitis), WBC; white blood cell. Treatment failure rates were not significantly different between the two groups (2.6% vs 2.1%, p ¼ 0.661). The DOT per category of antimicrobial between the two groups is presented in Fig. 3 . DOT reductions in cephalosporins (5.35 ± 4.47 vs 4.24 ± 2.44; p < 0.001), macrolides (6.43 ± 6.81 vs 3.42 ± 4.73; p < 0.001), and tetracyclines (0.52 ± 2.00 vs 0.11 ± 0.75; p < 0.001) were observed in the mPCR group compared to the RAT group, the DOT of penicillins was slightly increased (0.31 ± 1.64 vs 0.77 ± 1.82; p < 0.001).
