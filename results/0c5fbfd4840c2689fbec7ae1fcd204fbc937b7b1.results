A new genotype (genotype 3) detected in healthy P. monodon broodstock and postlarvae In an initial study, a semi-nested RT-PCR targeting a 279 nt ORF1b sequence located just downstream of helicase domain motif VI was used to detect YHV-related viruses in 38 apparently healthy P. monodon broodstock sampled from commercial hatcheries in Central Thailand in March 2000. PCR products were amplified from 25 (66%) of the broodstock (Fig. 1A) . Nucleotide sequences were determined for six of these in addition to PCR products amplified from juvenile shrimp from YHD outbreaks in Thailand and Taiwan and healthy broodstock and postlarvae from hatcheries in Australia, Vietnam and Sarawak in Malaysia (Table 1) . Using 25 sequences, ClustalX was used to align the 231 nt segment bounded by the nested PCR primers (equivalent to the sequence A 17492 to A 17722 in the GAV reference strain; GenBank AF227196). An unrooted neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree generated from this alignment segregated the sequences into three clusters (Fig. 1B) . One cluster (genotype 1) included the YHV reference strain (GenBank AY052786) and all eight viruses from juvenile shrimp from YHD outbreaks. Whilst slight nucleotide variation occurred between some of these viruses, the sequences of one Thai (THA-00-D11) and three of the four Taiwanese viruses (TWN-00-D1, TWN-00-D2, TWN-00-D3) were identical. The second cluster (genotype 2) included the GAV reference strain, the two other Australian viruses from either healthy or MCMS-affected shrimp, and one of the five Vietnamese viruses from healthy postlarvae (VNM-01-H65). The third phylogenetic cluster (genotype 3), which has not been described previously, comprised all viruses from healthy broodstock from Thailand and Sarawak and the other four Vietnamese viruses detected in healthy postlarvae. The Vietnamese viruses appeared to form a sub-group within genotype 3. Other genotypes detected in P. monodon from various Indo-Pacific regions A more extensive study was conducted using a larger set of P. monodon sampled over a wider geographic range. A new RT-nested PCR designed to amplify a 722 nt ORF1b gene segment encompassing the semi-nested RT-PCR sequence was used in initial analyses. This test was further modified to utilize degenerate primer pairs YH30-F2/ R2 and YHV31-F2/R2 to better accommodate sequence variations among the known genotypes and was applied to ∼ 200 P. monodon sampled between 1997 and 2004 from Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, India, Sri Lanka, Mozambique and Australia (Table 1) . Samples included whole postlarvae as well as gill, lymphoid organ, hepatopancreas or whole head tissues of juvenile farmed shrimp or adult broodstock from hatcheries. Most samples were from healthy shrimp but some originated from shrimp either displaying typical signs of YHD or that were moribund and collected from MCMS-affected ponds in Australia. In total, 57 of the ∼ 200 samples generated nested PCR amplicon yields suitable for sequencing. Sequences of these 57 viruses, together with YHV and GAV reference strain sequences, were aligned using ClustalX. An unrooted neighbour-joining tree generated from the alignment of the 688-671 nt segment (equivalent to the GAV reference strain sequence G 17259 to A 17929 ) segregated the viruses into six major clusters well supported by bootstrap values (N70%) (Fig. 2) . The clustering of viruses in genotypes 1, 2 and 3 substantiated initial findings with the 231 nt sequence in that all 13 viruses clustering with YHV (genotype 1) originated from juvenile YHDaffected shrimp and all seven viruses from healthy and diseased Australian shrimp clustered with GAV (genotype 2). Ten Thai and Vietnamese viruses from healthy shrimp also clustered with GAV. The 17 genotype 3 viruses displayed the widest geographic distribution, being identified in healthy broodstock and postlarvae from hatcheries in Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Mozambique. The three viruses from Malaysian shrimp also appeared to form a subcluster in genotype 3. In addition to these genotypes, the tree delineated three new clusters. One lineage (genotype 4) was clearly separated from all other genotypes and comprised viruses detected in three healthy postlarvae batches sampled from hatcheries in Nellore, India. Another lineage (genotype 6) was most closely related to genotype 2 (GAV) and comprised viruses detected in five of the six broodstock from Mozambique. The other Mozambique virus clustered in genotype 3. However, as Mozambique shrimp were supplied from a commercial breeding facility in Malaysia, it is possible this sample was mislabeled. Another lineage (genotype 5) comprised viruses derived from a healthy sub-adult from Malaysia (MYS-03-H4), a sub-adult from Thailand displaying slower than normal growth (THA-03-SG21), and a batch of healthy postlarvae sampled from the Philippines (PHL-03-H8). The relationships among the three genotype 5 viruses were more disparate than viruses clustering within the other lineages. Pair-wise alignments indicated that THA-03-SG21 and MYS-03-H4 share 97.3% sequence identity and that the levels of identity of these two viruses to PHL-03-H8 (92.8% and 93.4%) was less than that distinguishing viruses clustered in genotypes 2 and 6 (∼ 96.5%) and comparable to that distinguishing viruses clustered in genotypes 2 and 3 (∼ 93.3%). PHL-03-H8 was the only YH-related virus detected among 18 P. monodon sampled from the Philippines and it is likely that genotype 5 will resolve into a two separate lineages once more viruses are analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis using the maximum parsimony method clustered the viruses similarly into six genotypes (data not shown). Translation of the 57 amplified ORF1b gene fragments revealed 35 unique 223 aa sequences that extended from the start of the pp1ab helicase domain motif V to a locus 173 aa downstream of motif VI (Cowley et al., 2000b; Sittidilokratna et al., 2002 ). An unrooted phylogenetic tree was generated from a ClustalX alignment of the sequences using the neighbour-joining distance matrix. The viruses clustered into the same phylogenetic lineages as defined by the nucleotide sequences, except that the three genotype 6 viruses merged with viruses clustering in genotype 2 (data not shown).
