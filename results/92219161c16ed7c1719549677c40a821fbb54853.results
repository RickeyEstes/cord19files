A total of 660 MERS-CoV infections in confirmed cases was reported by the Saudi Ministry of Health between December 2, 2014 and November 12, 2016. Of these, 39.2% were elderly (aged ≥60 years). The sample was relatively old, with a mean age of 53.9 (±SD 17.9) and with ages ranging between 2 and 109 years. More than two-thirds (68.6%) of the sample were males, 15.9% were healthcare workers, 68.6% had pre-existing illnesses, and 41.9% had severe illness conditions. Camel exposure was found in 41.6% of the cases. The majority (64.4%) of the cases were reported in the Central region of Saudi Arabia. Refer to Table 1 for the sample characteristics. The subgroup analyses are shown in Table 2 . Of the cases studied, 197 died with an overall mortality rate of 29.8% and a 95% confidence interval between 21.77%-28.53%. No significant difference in the overall mortality rate was noted between males and females (31.2% vs. 27.1%; p = 0.281). However, there was a significantly higher mortality rate in elderly patients (≥ 60 years) compared with patients aged <60 years (45.2% vs. 20.0%; p = 0.001). A higher mortality rate was found in those of the Saudi nationality (35.8% vs. 15.5% non-Saudi nationality; p = 0.001), those with preexisting illness (60.6% vs. 15.7% non-preexisting illness; p = 0.001), and the severity of illness (50.0% vs. 14.9% stable condition; p = 0.001). It was found that healthcare workers had a significantly lower mortality rate (1% vs. 29.6% nonhealthcare workers; p = 0.001). A high risk of mortality was noted in patients with unknown (39.5%) sources of infections as compared to 4.5% household contact, 25.2% camels, 27.4% healthcare acquired; p = 0.001. The West/North region reported the lowest mortality rate (22.1%) as compared to 29.2% South, 31.7% East, 31.1% Central; p = 0.026. The multivariate risk factors are shown in Table 2 . During the 3 days of follow-up, 91 (13.8%) MERS-CoV patients died. Cox proportional hazard multivariate analysis identified several independent predictors of 3-day mortality in MERS-CoV patients. Elderly, non-healthcare worker, severity of illness, and hospital-acquired infections (
