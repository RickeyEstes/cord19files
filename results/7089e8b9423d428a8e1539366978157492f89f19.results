Probing analysis of DENV-MINI RNA verifies the 5 0 -3 0 -UTRs long-range interactions and suggests a TL1/ PK2 pseudoknot SHAPE has been developed to study RNA secondary structure by examining backbone flexibility (directly related to the base pairing) at each nucleotide position via reactivity with a specific electrophilic reagent (21) . We applied this technique to the in vitro-synthesized 719-nt subgenomic 'minigenome' RNA (DENV-MINI) template, which contains the 5 0 -terminal 226 nt, 42 nt from the C-terminal coding region of NS5, including the UAG termination codon, and the 451-nt 3 0 terminus (18) . Previous studies showed that this RNA molecule harbored essential cis-acting elements for efficient translation (25, 26) , as well as (À) strand RNA synthesis in vitro by either DENV2-infected cell lysates or purified RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) (27, 28) . DENV-MINI RNA was also used for secondary structure prediction analysis using the MPGAfold algorithm (29) to infer the structure-function role of the TLs and PKs regions in DENV replication and translation (8) . Reactivity of NMIA at each nucleotide position of DENV-MINI RNA is shown on Figure 1A and B and Supplementary Figure S1 . The most reactive and thus least conformationally constrained residues have a reactivity >0.8 U and are depicted in red. Nucleotide positions with reactivity <0.2 U, indicative of fully base paired residues, are in black, whereas residues of intermediate reactivity are color-coded according to the key. Data shown are an average of at least three experiments. Minimal free-energy modeling using SHAPE data as pseudo free-energy constraints is consistent with proposed 5 0 -UTR motifs in the context of DENV-MINI RNA ( Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1 ) (6, 17, 30) . Two regions that exhibit high sensitivity to NMIA modifications were located within the 5 0 stem-loop A (SLA), A31-U34 and U48-A50, which corresponded to the TL and the side stem-loop (SSL), respectively. Three helical regions of 5 0 SLA, U3-G9:C64-G70, C11-G15:A56-G61 and C24-A29:U35-G40, were insensitive to NMIA. The remainder of the reactive nucleotides were situated within the U62-U63 bulge and internal loops G17-A19 and G22-A23. Downstream of SLA, the oligoU tract spanning nt U71-U80 was predicted to be singlestranded. This region was followed by the unreactive double-stranded upstream of AUG region (dsUAR), formed via a long-range interaction between the 5 0 -and 3 0 -UTRs (nt A81-G96 and nt C638-U654). Here, the only reactive residues occupied the vicinity of bulge (C646), mismatch (G84) and the closing base pair of the helix. The internal loop enclosing the first AUG codon (nt A97-A104 and G631-C637) was predicted to be singlestranded followed by the double-stranded 6-nt long downstream of UAR region (DAR) containing reactive residues within the mismatch (A108) and the closing pairs of the helices. The capsid hairpin (cHP, A115-U133) (12), displayed an unreactive stem followed by a 7-nt reactive apical loop. As suggested by previous chemical probing studies, the 5 0 -3 0 terminal interactions were mediated by base pairing between the 5 0 and 3 0 cyclization sequences, which formed 11-nt double-stranded cyclization region (CS) (U134-G144 and C614-A624) (12) . Subsequently, two short hairpins that formed downstream of the 5 0 -3 0 CS were found within the sequence of the 5 0 -end of the capsid protein gene. One contains a purine-rich and moderately reactive apical loop (A152-U159) and the other with a reactive 3-nt loop and A-C mismatch (G165-C185). Both hairpins were followed by 5-nt helical region (A190-U194 and A444-U448), which provided additional linkage between the 5 0 and 3 0 termini. With regard to the 3 0 -UTR, SHAPE provided information on the 3 0 SL structure, obscured only at the extreme 3 0 terminus because of the presence of hybridized primer ( Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1 ). The 3 0 SL displayed NMIA sensitivity at the apical loop (A674-C680) and insensitivity at its leftmost side. The fact that this large 79-nt stem-loop was followed with reactive stretch of 3 nt (C655-U657) and unreactive dsUAR region (nucleotides A81-G96 and nucleotides C638-U654), enforced the proposed conformation. Previous phylogenetic comparative studies suggested that the 3 0 -UTR enclosed two almost identical DBs that might assume a pseudoknot conformation with their downstream complementary regions (13, 16) . SHAPE data confirmed the presence of both, and in addition provided detailed insight into their secondary structure. The 3 0 DB contained a 6-bp unreactive stem (U536-G541 and C598-A603) and two hairpins on opposing ends (G547-U571 and G584-C597). The apical loop of the leftmost hairpin incorporated the highly reactive TL2 sequence (G558-U562). The reactivity of TL2, combined with the fact that its downstream complementary partner PK1 (A613-C617) was involved in formation of 5 0 -3 0 CS region, would likely prevent the previously suggested TL2/PK1 pseudoknot interaction (13, 16) . Regarding the 5 0 DB, it likewise contained an unreactive stem (G449-G454 and C511-C516) and two hairpins on opposing ends (C462-G482 and G497-C510). Here, however, the apical loop of the leftmost hairpin incorporating the TL1 sequence (G467-G477), although predicted to be single-stranded, harbored mainly unreactive nucleotides. The fact that its complementary partner PK2 was likewise unreactive and enclosed within single-stranded loop (G526-C530) was strongly suggestive of a TL1/ PK2 base pairing interaction ( Figure 2 ) (13, 16) . In addition, both DBs comprised reactive bulges (A491-C496 and A578-A583) and moderately NMIA-sensitive purine-rich internal loops. One of the internal loops of the 3 0 DB (G572-A575) was insensitive to modification as it contained a -GGAA-motif. Such -GNRA-tetraloops represent a unique fold, which include a trans sugar edge/ Hoogsteen edge G · A pair between the first and the last residues, a hydrogen bond between the 2 0 -OH of G and the N7 of A and 3 0 stacking of all tetraloop bases except the G. This architecture would account for lack of reactivity towards NMIA (31) . The region upstream of the DBs is often referred to as the variable region (VR), as its sequence differs between DENV serotypes ( Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure  S1 ) (33) . Our probing analysis indicated its propensity to form long single-stranded stretches (A274-A291, U364-A376, G418-C424 and U439-A443). One of the loops (U439-A443), composed almost exclusively of adenine residues, was mainly NMIA unreactive. It was shown previously that consecutive adenine bases in single-stranded regions are often involved in stacking interactions, which would account for their inaccessibility towards NMIA modification (34, 35) . The 3 0 -UTR region also contained two stable tetraloops (C352-G363 and C425-G438). As expected, the -GNRA-tetraloop (C425-G438), restricted by extensive stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions, was NMIA-insensitive (31) . On the other hand, the -CAAG-tetraloop (C352-G363) behaved differently. Here, only its GC residues showed little reactivity, which could be interpreted as formation of an intraloop G · C base pair, whereas its AA residues were reactive. The apical loops of two other hairpins (G377-C392 and G396-C412) showed strong NMIA reactivity. Also, an extended hairpin containing internal asymmetric loop (A296-U301 and U345-G346), a bulge (C307-A313) and A-rich, moderately reactive apical loop (A323-A331) was predicted to form between nucleotides G292-C350. Another long hairpin (U206-A267) with a reactive apical loop (A233-A241) and two reactive internal loops (G218-A222 and C252-A256; A227-A229 and G245-A247) enclosed a linker sequence that stretched from A227-G268. Our secondary structure determination of DENV-MINI RNA was furthermore validated by single-strandspecific Pb 2+ ion-induced hydrolysis (23) (Supplementary Figure S2) . The observed cleavage pattern correlated with SHAPE-predicted single-stranded regions. The 5 0 -UTR regions highly sensitive to Pb 2+ cleavage included the vicinity of SLA internal loop (C14-G15), SLA SSL (U48-A49) and the polyU tract (U71-U80). The SLA TL (C30-U34), as well as the apical loop of cHP (A121-A127), was hydrolyzed weakly, agreeing with previous studies showing that in most cases, bulges and internal loops were more readily cleaved with Pb 2+ ions than apical loops (23) . The 5 0 -3 0 CS (U134-G144) and dsUAR (A88-G96) were resistant to cleavage, as they were predicted to be double-stranded. In addition, the two hairpins formed within the sequence of the 5 0 -end of the capsid protein gene (A152-G153 and A174-C175) were moderately sensitive to hydrolysis, whereas the following single-stranded region was hydrolyzed readily (C199-A205). Pb 2+ ions moderately cleaved some of single-stranded stretches of the 3 0 -UTR (A277-C289), whereas others, particularly the A-rich ones, had isolated cleavage points (A369 and C375) or were resistant to hydrolysis (U439-A443) (Supplementary Figure S2) . The two tetraloops of the 3 0 -UTR (C352-G363 and C425-G438) were resistant to hydrolysis, consistent with previous studies, indicating that tetraloops showed little or no Pb 2+ -induced hydrolysis because of extensive stacking interactions (36) . The apices of other hairpins (G325-A327, A384-C385 and G402-U408) were moderately reactive. The most pronounced Pb 2+ -induced hydrolysis occurred within the apex of the 3 0 SL (C673-C675), the internal loops of DBs (A491-G495 and C579-G582) and the loops of their rightmost hairpins (U500-G505 and A588-G592). Lack of Pb 2+ cleavage within TL1 and its putative complementary partner PK2 was again suggestive of their base pairing interaction ( Figure 1B insert and Supplementary Figure  S2 ). In contrast, TL2 (G555-U562) was hydrolyzed readily, whereas its PK1 partner, predicted to be involved in the double-stranded 5 0 -3 0 CS interaction, was resistant to cleavage.
