In Taiwan, there were 1800 -3000 newly diagnosed cases of invasive cervical cancer cases, and 700 -4000 newly diagnosed cases of carcinoma in situ in each year during the period from 1991 to 2007. The annual, triennial, and 5-year cervical cancer screening participation in Taiwan from 1995 to 2007 are shown in Figure 1 . The annual participation gradually increased from 9.4% in 1995 to 27.5% in 2007, triennial participation increased from 33.9% in 1997 to 51.0% in 2007, and 5-year participation increased from 53.6% in 1999 to 63.5% in 2007. After the implementation of the screening programme in 1995, around 75% eligible women in Taiwan had participated in the programme for at least once by 2007. The secular trends of age-standardised cervical cancer incidence for women aged 30 years or more in Taiwan are shown in Figure 2 . Age-adjusted incidence of carcinoma in situ per 100 000 women increased from 15.8 in 1991 to 23.9 in 1995. Age-adjusted incidence of invasive cancer increased in the first year after the implementation of screening programme, and then decreased from 57.8 in 1996 to 26.2 in 2006 (54.7% reduction). Age-adjusted incidence of carcinoma in situ per 100 000 women increased from 23.9 in 1995 to 69.2 in 1999, and then decreased from 69.2 to 52.4 (24.3% reduction). The age-adjusted incidence of invasive cancer and carcinoma in situ rapidly reduced in 2003 and rebounded in 2004 might be due to reduction in screening and confirmatory diagnosis of cervical cancers because of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 in Taiwan. The incidence of invasive cervical cancer did not decrease significantly in age groups of 30 -69 years until 1997 and in age group of 70 þ years until 1999. The reduction percentage of incidence of invasive cervical cancer from 1995 to 2006 was 47.5% (from 20.0 to 10.5), 41.9% (from 43.2 to 25.1), 54.8% (from 67.7 to 30.6), 55.5% (from 83.1 to 37.0), and 32.3% (from 77.1 to 52.2), respectively, for age group of 30 -39, 40 -49, 50 -59, 60 -69 , and 70 þ years. The incidence of carcinoma in situ increased rapidly after 1995, picked at 1999, and then reduced in most age groups except the age group of 30 -39 years. The main morphological type of invasive cervical cancer in Taiwan was squamous cell carcinoma, but the proportion of adenocarcinoma increased from 5.5% in 1991 to 13.7% in 2006. The incidence of invasive cervical squamous cell carcinoma decreased from 1995 to 2006 showing a reduction percentage of 55.6% (from 16.0 to 7.1), 48.1% (from 34.1 to 17.7), 58.5% (from 56.2 to 23.3), 53.7% (from 67.2 to 31.1), and 31.0% (from 64.2 to 44.3 per 100 000), respectively, for age groups of 30 -39, 40 -49, 50 -59, 60 -69 , and 70 þ years. The incidence of invasive cervical adenocarcinoma decreased from 2000 to 2006 showing a reduction percentage of 15.4% (from 2.6 to 2.2), 31.3% (from 6.4 to 4.4), 21.0% (from 6.2 to 4.9), 31.9% (from 4.7 to 3.2), and 7.9% (from 3.8 to 3.5 per 100 000), respectively, for age groups of 30 -39, 40 -49, 50 -59, 60 -69, and 70 þ years.
