A total of 1,042 out of 2,231 inpatient nurses responded to the survey. There were 268 nurses with incomplete data who were excluded from analysis, resulting in a total of 774 subjects in the study. Half (51.7%) of the nurses had received influenza vaccination in the previous season (year 2011). Approximately 71% of the participants intended to receive influenza vaccine in the next influenza season (Table 1) . Principal component analysis revealed 8 latent factors on influenza vaccine, including (1) perceived benefits of and motivations for influenza vaccination, (2) global threat of emerging infectious diseases, (3) effectiveness of hospital's influenza vaccination promotional efforts, (4) personal nonsusceptibility to influenza and preference for alternatives to influenza vaccination, (5) local threat of emerging infectious diseases, (6) reinforcement and cues to action, (7) fear of adverse effects, and (8) accessibility. The Cronbach α coefficient ranged from 0.36 to 0.87 (Table A1 ). One item was removed from factor 7 (fear of adverse effects), and the Cronbach α improved to 0.64. A composite score for the remaining items for factor 7 was calculated. For factors 6 (reinforcement and cues to action) and 8 (accessibility), with poor internal consistency, individual items were included in the final multiple logistic regression model, along with the composite score for factor 7 and the 5 factors with good internal consistency. On univariate analysis, age, ethnicity, workplace, job title, past vaccination uptake, and 6 psychosocial factors were significantly associated with future vaccination intention. In the multivariate model, the strongest predictor for vaccination intention was perceived benefits of and motivations for vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.55-4.27) ( Table 2 ). This was followed by awareness of easy access to influenza vaccination at the occupational health clinic (aOR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.32-2.45), knowledge that vaccination was provided free-of-charge, (aOR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.23-2.61), the perceived effectiveness of the hospital's influenza vaccination promotional efforts (aOR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.37-2.33), and the perceived global threat of emerging infectious diseases (aOR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.39-2.31). Perceived local threat of emerging infectious diseases was also associated with vaccination intention (aOR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.01-1.64). Nurses who perceived themselves to be nonsusceptible to influenza and who preferred alternatives to vaccination (aOR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.20-0.34), and those who feared the adverse effects of vaccination (aOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72-0.99), were 74% and 16% less likely to express the intention for future influenza vaccination (Table 2) .
