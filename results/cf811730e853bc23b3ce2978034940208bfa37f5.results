The most remarkable gross autopsy findings were bilateral pulmonary consolidation, acute tracheobronchitis, hepatomegaly with cholestasis, deep mucosal ulcerations throughout the small bowel, and prominent generalized lymphadenopathy. The most notable pathologic finding was heavy hemorrhagic foci in the lungs. Microscopic examination of the lungs confirmed the presence of interstitial emphysema with profound hemorrhage in the right upper, right middle, left upper, and left lower lobes. Multiple smudge cells and cells with Cowdry type A nuclear inclusions were identified inside reactive bronchial epithelium from both lungs. Similar inclusions were seen in epithelium of the trachea, bile duct, renal tubules, and urinary bladder. Small bowel mucosa revealed multifocal ulcerations and scattered inclusion-bearing cells in the epithelium. Findings after immunoperoxidase staining were negative for cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, influenza virus, human papillomavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and simian virus 40, and in situ hybridization was negative for Epstein-Barr virus. Attempts to culture virus from the lung, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and lymph node tissues were unsuccessful. Gram-stained sections of lung, liver, and lymph node showed >25 neutrophils per lowpower field without presence of organisms. Coagulasenegative Staphylococcus spp. grew from a blood culture (<30 CFU/mL) and culture of the gastrointestinal tract. No strictly anaerobic growth was observed. Electron micrographs of the lungs showed viral particles in the nuclei, many in para-crystalline arrays (Figure 1) . The particles were 30.4-34.7 nm (mean 32.1 nm) in diameter. The diameter was less than the conventional diameter for polyomaviruses (45 nm), but the size of viral particles can vary according to the method of fixation and embedding (14) . In addition, previously published electron microscopy findings for BKPyV particles indicated measurements of 30-50 nm (15) . Despite the presence of viral particles indicative of polyomavirus, IHC on lung tissue with a primary antibody against simian virus 40, which is known to cross-react with BK and JC polyomaviruses, was negative. IHC for adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus was also negative. Although electron microscopy indicated a probable viral infection in the patient's lungs, because of the negative IHC results, no further testing was performed at that time. Table 2 ). The entire WUPyV genome (designated Rochester-7029, GenBank accession no. FJ794068) was subsequently sequenced from lung tissue to 4× coverage (each base sequenced independently 4 times) by using multiple primer sets and found to be 5,306 bp. Compared with 79 complete WUPyV genome sequences available in GenBank, nucleotide identity scores for Rochester-7029 ranged from 0.970 to 0.985. Compared with the reference sequence, Rochester-7029 had 8 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, 5 of which were in coding regions. Two of these 5 were synonymous mutations. We predicted an amino acid change in VP2 and VP3 from glutamic acid to glutamine at positions 250 and 107, respectively. We also predicted amino acid changes in large T-antigen: glutamine to glutamic acid at position 134 and isoleucine to leucine at position 594. Of note, the Rochester-7029 genome contained a 77-bp terminal duplication in the large T-antigen as compared with the reference WUPyV genome, which was not predicted to have any effect on the size or sequence of the translated protein because it was located 3′ to the T-antigen stop codon. After detection of WUPyV in the patient's tissues by real-time qPCR, WUPyV-specific IHC with a previously described assay (11) was performed on available tissues (lung, liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract) to determine whether WU-VP1 antigen was also present (Figure 2) . Liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tissues were all negative (Table 2) . Staining was observed in the lung (Figure 2 , panels A, C) and the trachea (Figure 2 , panel E), but no staining was observed in serial sections stained with an isotype control antibody (Figure 2 , panels B, D, F). Serial sections stained with no primary or secondary antibodies were also negative (not shown). Overall, we saw 3 patterns of staining in the lung. In some cells, WU-VP1 staining was primarily in the nucleus. In others, the perimeter of the nucleus was strongly positive. And in others, the staining was diffuse, making it difficult to discern its position within cells. Of note, the tracheal staining was within a submucosal gland, where WUPyV tropism has not been previously described.
