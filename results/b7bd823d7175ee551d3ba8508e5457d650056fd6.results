Cell-cell fusion activity of S proteins cloned from EP3 and CK-adapted Beaudette strain of IBV Acquisition of the cell-cell fusion activity is essential for selection and adaptation of coronavirus IBV from chicken embryo to cultured cells [10] . Sequence comparison of two S protein constructs, S(EP3) and S(CK), cloned from EP3 and CK-adapted IBV strains, respectively, showed amino acid substitutions at 31 positions (Fig. 1a) . The cell-cell fusion activity of these two S constructs was analyzed by transfection into Vero cells using the vaccinia/T7 recombinant virus system. Western blot analysis showed the presence of major forms of S protein, including the 180-kDa glycosylated (S*) and 130-kDa unglycosylated full-length S (S) and the cleaved S1 and S2 species (S1/S2) in cells expressing the two constructs (Fig. 2a, lanes 2 and 3) . It was noted that the expression level of S(CK) was higher than S(EP3) (Fig. 2a) . As a negative control, cells transfected with IBV N protein were included, and the expressed N protein was detected by Western blot with anti-N antibodies (Fig. 2a, lane 1) . Immunofluorescent staining of Vero cells expressing S(CK) clearly showed syncytia formation at 12 hours post-transfection (Fig. 2b , panel S(CK)). However, in Vero cells expressing S(EP3), no obvious syncytia was observed (Fig. 2b , panel S(EP3)). In the negative control cells, no fusion of the transfected cells was detected (Fig. 2b, panel N) . To investigate the possibility that intrinsic differences in cell surface translocation of the two S constructs may affect their cellcell fusion activity, cell surface expression of the two proteins was analysed by flow cytometry after immunofluorescent staining with anti-S antiserum. As shown in Fig. 2c Acquisition of the cell-cell fusion activity by mutation of a conserved leucine residue to phenylalanine (L857-F) in the heptad repeat 1 region of S protein To map the amino acid mutation(s) responsible for acquisition of the cell-cell fusion activity of S(CK), three chimeric constructs were first made. Construct EP3-CK(1) was made by replacing the C-terminal 412 amino acid region of S(EP3) with the corresponding region from S(CK), EP3-CK(2) was made by replacing the Cterminal 280 amino acid region of S(EP3) with the corresponding region from S(CK), and CK-EP3 was made by replacing the Nterminal 882 amino acid region of S(EP3) with the corresponding region from S(CK) (Fig. 3a) . Western blot analysis of cells expressing these constructs detected the S1 and S2 species as well as the glycosylated and unglycosylated forms of the full-length S protein (Fig. 3b , lanes [3] [4] [5] . Immunofluorescent staining showed cell-cell fusion and syncytia formation in cells expressing both EP3-CK(1) and CK-EP3 (Fig. 3c , panels EP3-CK(1) and CK-EP3), but not EP3-CK(2) (Fig. 3c , panel EP3-CK (2)). The relative cell-cell fusion activities of these S constructs were semiquantitatively defined by comparing the average size of syncytia induced by different S constructs with the average size (considered as 1) of cells expressing S(EP3), and are listed in the order from high to low as follows: CK-EP3.CK = EP3-CK(1)&EP3 = EP3-CK(2) (.indicates the relative activity is within 1 fold higher, and &indicates more than 1 fold higher). These results demonstrate that the region between amino acids 750 and 882 may determine the fusogenic difference between S(EP3) and S(CK). Examination of this region showed two amino acid substitutions from S(EP3) to S(CK), i.e. N826 to S and L857 to F (Fig. 1b) . To determine which amino acid substitution dictates the fusogenic change, three mutant constructs were made. Constructs CK3(S826-N) and CK(F857-L) were made by mutation of the S826 and F857 residues in S(CK) to N and L, respectively (Fig. 3a) . Construct EP3(L857-F) was made by mutation of the L857 residue in S(EP3) to F (Fig. 3a) . Western blot analysis of cells expressing these constructs detected the S1 and S2 species as well as the fulllength forms (Fig. 3b , lanes 6-8). Immunofluorescent staining showed formation of syncytia in cells expressing CK(S826-N) (Fig. 3c , panel CK(S826-N), suggesting that mutation of S836 to N did not affect the cell-cell activity of S(CK). Cell-cell fusion and syncytia formation were also observed in cells expressing EP3(L857-F) but not CK(F857-L) (Fig. 3c , panels EP3(L857-F) and CK(F857-L)), demonstrating that the L857-F mutation introduced into S(EP3) renders the protein fusogenic in cultured cells. On the other hand, mutation of the F857 residue to L totally abolishes the fusion activity of S(CK) (Fig. 3c , panel CK(F867-L). The relative cell-cell fusion activities of these S constructs are CK(S826-N).EP3(L857-F)&EP3 = CK(F857-L). These results confirm that S(CK) gains the cell-cell fusion activity by L857-F mutation in the heptad repeat 1 region of the protein. The F857-L substitution was then introduced into the S constructs cloned from Vero-adapted IBV (p7) and (p65), respectively, generating S(p7) and S(p65) (Fig. 3a) . Expression of these constructs showed cell-cell fusion and syncytia formation in cell expressing wild type S(p7) and S(p65), but not the mutant S proteins (Fig. 3c , panel p7, p7(F857-L), p65 and p65(F857-L)). The expression levels of both F857-L mutants were lower than the wild type constructs, but no significant difference in the S1/S2 cleavage was observed (Fig. 3b, lane 9-12 ). The relative cell-cell fusion activities of these S constructs are p65.p7&EP3 = p7(F857-L) = p65(F857-L). These data indicate that S protein acquires its cell-cell fusion activity by the L857-F mutation during adaptation to both CK and Vero cells. Further mutations of the L857 residue to other amino acids based on S(EP3) were made. As shown in Fig. 3a , the L857 was mutated to Y, S, E, I and K, respectively. Expression of these mutant constructs showed that mutations of L857 to Y and S exhibited similar effect on cell-cell fusion as the L857-F mutant. Cell-cell fusion and syncytia formation were observed in cells expressing these two mutants (Fig. 3c) . However, much less cell-cell fusion and smallersized syncytia were observed in cells expressing L857-E, L857-K and L857-I mutant constructs (Fig. 3c) . The relative cell-cell fusion activities of these S constructs are EP3(L857-Y).EP3(L857-S).EP3(L857-E).EP3(L857-I) = EP3(L857-K).EP3. Introduction of the F857-L substitution back to the genome of Vero-adapted IBV and analysis of its effect on viral infectivity in cultured cells The F857-L mutation was then introduced back to the genome of Vero-adapted IBV by using an infectious clone system based on p65 [16, 17] to test its influence on viral recovery and infectivity. In vitro synthesized full-length transcripts derived from wild type (rIBV) and mutant (FL) clones were introduced into Vero cells by electroporation. At 3 days post-electroporation, syncytia formation The recombinant wild type and mutant viruses (p0) were recovered from the culture media at 3 and 6 days post-electroporation, respectively, and further propagated on Vero cells for 5 passages. Total RNA was extracted from the culture media of cells infected with each passage of the mutant virus and RT-PCR was carried out to amplify the S gene. The RT-PCR products were cloned, 10 bacterial clones were randomly chosen from p0, and the complete nucleotide sequence of the S gene was determined to confirm if the recovered virus maintains the F857-L substitution. As shown in table 1, L857 was found in all 10 clones. However, only five clones had an identical sequence with the original mutant S gene (type FL), and additional mutations at other positions were found in the other five clones (Table 1) . Among them, two clones contain a T773-S substitution (FLv1), one contains an I769-V substitution (FLv2), and two contain Q523-L and I769-V substitutions (FLv3) ( Table 1 ). These results demonstrate that the recovered FL mutant virus from p0 contains a mixed population of quasispecies. To investigate which quasispecies would become dominant in the subsequent passages, sequencing analysis of bacterial clones containing the PCR fragments from p1, p3 and p5 was performed. In the four clones chosen from p1, a homogenous S gene with both Q523-L and I769-V (FLv3) mutations was found (Table 1) . Subsequent sequencing of clones derived from p3 and p5 each showed that six out of 10 clones from p3 and two out of 10 clones from p5 are FLv3 (Table 1 ). The dominant clones contain an additional proline to serine substitution at amino acid position 327 (FLv4) ( Table 1) . The recovered viruses were then plaque-purified. Compared to wild type IBV, rIBV showed similar growth kinetics in Vero cells (Fig. 4b) , but formed slighlty smaller plaques (Fig. 4a) with lower expression level of S protein (Fig. 4c) . A total of 20 mutant viruses was plaque-purified from passages 3 and 5, and the S gene of all purified viruses was shown to share the same sequence as FLv4 ( Table 1 ). The FLv4 mutant virus formed similar-sized plaques as rIBV (Fig. 4a) with slightly lower expression of S protein (Fig. 4c) . Interestingly, the mutant virus produced up to 10-fold higher titers of virus, compared to rIBV (Fig. 4b) . Restoration of the cell-cell fusion activity of S(p65) protein carrying the F875-L mutation by compensatory mutations in the S1 region The cell-cell fusion activity of S proteins cloned from the mutant IBV construct FL and the four variants (FLv1, FLv2, FLv3 and FLv4) was analyzed by expression in Vero cells. Once again, expression of these constructs led to the detection of S1 and S2 species as well as the full-length forms (Fig. 5a) . Higher levels of S protein were detected in cells expressing S(FLv3) and S(FLv4), comparing to cells expressing the other two S constructs (Fig. 5a) . Immunofluorescent staining showed the formation of giant syncytia in cells expressing S(FLv3) and S(FLv4) (Fig. 5b , panels S(FLv3) and S(FLv4)), but much smaller syncytia were observed in cells expressing S(FLv2) (Fig. 5b, panel S(FLv2) ). No obvious cell-cell fusion was observed in cells expressing S(FL) and S(FLv1) (Fig. 5b , panels S(FL) and S(FLv1)). The relative cell-cell fusion activities of these S constructs are FLv4.FLv3.FLv2&EP3 = FL = FLv1. These results confirm that acquisition of the cell-cell fusion activity is an important step for adaptation of IBV in cultured cells. Since amino acid difference between S(FLv2) and S(FLv3) was only at the 523 th residue, the S(FL(Q523-L)) construct was also created and expressed. The results showed that it displayed a similar cell-cell fusion activity as FLv2 ( = FL(I769-V)) ( Fig. 5a Further enhancement of the cell-cell fusion activity of S protein and adaptation of IBV to cell culture by G405-D substitution Vero-adapted IBV gradually increased its infectivity in Vero cells by serial passages and a significant difference between p7 and p65 was observed [10] . Comparison of amino acid sequences between S(p7) and S(p65) revealed a single mutation at the amino acid position 405 (G405-D) in S(p65) (Fig. 1a) . To analyze the possibility that the enhanced infectivity of p65 virus is due to the enhanced cell-cell fusion activity of the corresponding S protein, S(p7) and S(p65) constructs were created and expressed in Vero cells. Efficient induction of cell-cell fusion was observed in cells transfected with both constructs (Fig. 6a, panels S(p7) and S(p65) and 6b, lanes 3 and  4) . Comparatively, significantly larger syncytia was observed in cells expressing S(p65) construct than in cells expressing S(p7) (Fig. 6a) , demonstrating that the additional G405-D mutation in S(p65) may enhance its cell-cell fusion activity. The G405-D mutation was then introduced into S(EP3) and S(CK) and expressed (Fig. 6a) , showing that introduction of G405-D mutation into S(CK) drastically enhanced its cell-cell fusion activity (Fig. 6b) . Interestingly, introduction of the mutation into S(EP3) and expression of the construct in Vero cells showed formation of small syncytial cells (Fig. 6b) . The relative cell-cell fusion activities of these S constructs are CK(G405-D).p65.CK&p7.EP3(G405-D).EP3.
