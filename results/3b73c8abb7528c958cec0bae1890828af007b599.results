We initially present results for immotile, non-proliferative agents on a growing domain, in which domain growth is exponential. We simulate the scenario in which all lattice sites are occupied by an agent in the IBM on a lattice of size 100 by 100 sites. This means the initial conditions for Eqs. (16) and (19)- (21) are and ρ Nx×Ny 2 13 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

However, as results from the IBM are ensemble averages we substitute N x and N y for their continuum analogues L x (t) and L y (t), respectively. For exponential domain growth L x (t) evolves according to The evolution of L y (t) is equivalent. This substitution of N x (t) and N y (t) with L x (t) and L y (t) avoids jump discontinuities in the numerical solutions of Eqs. (16) and (19)- (21), which are not present in the averaged IBM results. To solve our equations numerically we use MATLAB's ode15s.
