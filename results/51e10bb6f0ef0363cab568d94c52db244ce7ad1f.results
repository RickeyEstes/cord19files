From 2004 to 2013, there were 77.76 thousand newly notified pulmonary TB cases in Wuhan, China (Table 1 ). Figure 1 showed the original time series of pulmonary TB cases from 2004 January to 2013 December. Wuhan city is located in Hubei Province which is in the middle of China. Wuhan has a subtropical wet monsoon climate. Based on the temperature data and climatic seasonal division method, seasons in Wuhan were defined as spring (March-May), summer (June-September), autumn (October-November), and winter (December-February) [18] . There were a dominant spring peak (March) and a second summer peak (September), along with the trough (December). Table 2 illustrated spring seasonal amplitudes for subgroups of each group and the comparisons of spring seasonal amplitudes. An annual mean of 56.81% (95% CI, 41.93%-71.69%) more pulmonary TB cases were notified in the spring peak month (March) compared with the trough month (December) from 2004 to 2013. The spring seasonal amplitude in 2004-2008(73.17%) was higher than that of 2009-2013(40.45%), and the difference between them was significant (P,0.05). There were no statistical differences in spring seasonal amplitude between males and females, age groups, center and far district, smear positive and smear negative pulmonary TB (P.0.05). There were significant differences in spring seasonal amplitude by occupation, with amplitude ranging from 59.37% to 113.22% (P,0.05). The most common of spring peak month was March, the others were April and May. The trough month for all groups and subgroups was December. Table 3 summarized summer seasonal amplitudes for subgroups of each group and the comparisons of summer seasonal amplitudes. An annual mean of 43.40% (95% CI, 28.88%-57.92%) more pulmonary TB cases were notified in the summer peak month (September) compared with the trough month (December) from 2004 to 2013. The summer seasonal amplitude in 2004-2008(60.11%) was higher than that of 2009-2013(26.68%), and the difference between them was significant (P,0.05). There was no statistical difference in summer seasonal amplitude between males and females, center and far district, smear positive and smear negative pulmonary TB (P.0.05). There were significant differences in summer seasonal amplitude by age, with amplitude ranging from 36.05% to 100.09% (P,0.05). There were significant differences in summer seasonal amplitude by occupation, with amplitude ranging from 43.40% to 109.88% (P, 0.05). The most common of summer peak month was September, others were July and August. The trough month for all groups and subgroups was December. Table 4 displayed the median, the lower and upper quartile of spring and summer seasonal amplitude difference in Wuhan from 2004 to 2013. The median of 0-14 years old group and student were negative which showed that the summer seasonal amplitude was higher than the spring seasonal amplitude.
