The icMERS-0 virus originates from the EMC 2012 genomic sequence and contains an additional insertion of three amino acids followed by a single amino acid change (S885L) in the S2 region of the spike gene, which augment replication 2 . The icMERS-0 virus was evaluated in six rhesus macaques that were survivors from a prior Ebola countermeasure efficacy experiment (Supplemental Fig. 1 for individual information). All six rhesus monkeys were infected with a target dose of 5 Ã— 10 6 PFU of icMERS-0 by intratracheal inoculation, with the entire dose of 6.62log 10 PFU/mL placed at the carina. Rhesus monkeys were randomly assigned to two separate groups: an early time point group (day 5 post-infection) to examine pathology at peak disease (NHP3, NHP5, & NHP6) and a late time point group (day 30 post-infection) to monitor disease progression (NHP1, NHP2, & NHP4). All clinical signs (O 2 saturation and temperature) remained within normal range throughout the entire experiment ( Fig. 1 ). In accordance with clinical signs, complete blood counts with differential and serum chemistry analytes did not exhibit clinically significant changes from animal baselines (data not shown). Computed Tomography indicates that MERS-0 elicits mild respiratory disease. Computed tomography (CT) imaging is a highly sensitive technique for evaluating tissues for pathological alterations. Pulmonary pathological changes can be quantified by measuring the intensity of hyperdense voxels in the total lung volume over the course of disease, also referred to as percent change in lung hyperdensity (PCLH) 18 . Areas of hyperdensity represent changes in lung tissue associated with lung pathology. NHP1 exhibited obvious increases in PCLH at days 3, with gradual resolution through day 30 post-infection (Fig. 2a) . With the exception of NHP5, increases in PCLH were readily detectable over baseline in all NHPs over the course of disease (Fig. 2b) . NHP5 exhibited no change in PCLH through the course of the experiment. NHP1, NHP3, NHP4, and NHP6 experienced increases that were above what was observed in prior NHP infections with wild-type MERS-CoV strains. It must be noted that improper endotracheal tube placement in NHP6 artificially exaggerated lung disease during the day 5 imaging session. Quantitative measurement of hyperdense regions indicate a peak at day 3 post-infection (p.i.) for NHPs that developed multifocal lung pathology which gradually resolved through day 30 p.i. (Fig. 2b) . Nevertheless, CT demonstrates that icMERS-0 exposure resulted in quantifiable increases in lung pathology that were more severe than that previously observed with wild-type human strains 10, 11 . Notably, disease in rhesus monkeys constitutes a mild respiratory infection compared to PCLH recalculated from data obtained from a previous study following infection with EMC 2012 11 (Supplemental Fig. 2 ). Scientific RepoRTs | (2018) 8:10727 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-28900-1 Transient, mild pulmonary pathology in rhesus monkeys after MERS-0 inoculation. Grossly, all 3 animals (NHP3, 5 and 6) euthanized at day 5 post-inoculation (pi) had diffuse, mild pulmonary congestion (Fig. 3a) . Histologically, these 3 animals had focal-to-diffuse, minimal-to-mild interstitial pneumonia. The alveoli were lined by hyperplastic type II pneumocytes and filled with fibrin, edema, red blood cells, and macrophages. The septa were minimally-to-mildly expanded by fibrin, proteinaceous fluid, and mononuclear cells (Fig. 3b) . Multifocally, other alveoli were often expanded and filled with eosinophilic, fibrillar material. The septa showed minimal to mild smooth muscle cell hyperplasia, fibrosis and vascular congestion (Fig. 3c ). The three animals (NHP1, 2, and 4) necropsied on day 30 p.i. showed no significant lung lesions (Fig. 3d) . Quantitation of microscopic findings in the lung are commensurate with histopathological findings (Supplemental Table 1 ), while extrapulmonary tissues exhibited Incidental histological changes (Supplemental Tables 2 and 3 ). Lung consolidation depicted as the percentage of the volume of hyperdense voxels in the total lung volume for each icMERS virus exposed animal. * Day 5 for NHP6 was omitted due to improper endotracheal tube intubation for the imaging breadth hold. Solid and dotted black lines indicate the baseline mean and 3 SD range of the hyperdense volume from ic-MERS-0 exposed animals included in this study. Dotted red lines indicate the upper and lower method range limits of MERS exposed rhesus monkeys (n = 33). were negative at 30 days post-infection (Fig. 4d,e) . Relatively, alveolar macrophages were more prominent on day 5 pi than at day 30 pi. In contrast, epithelial cells of submucosal glands had more icMERS-0 antigen positive cells in 30 dpi group than the 5 dpi group. The small number of antigen positive cells increases the opportunity for error during lower lung aspirate sampling for RNA analysis, and may account for our inability to detect MERS viral RNA by qRT-PCR in lung aspirates (Supplemental Table 4 ). By focusing the RNA isolation on samples previously identified to be positive by IHC, icMERS-0 was detected in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung tissues ( Table 1 ). The leader-ORF1 primer set detects full-length genomic and subgenomic RNAs, whereas the leader-ORFN combination detects subgenomic, replicating RNAs in infected cells. Subgenomic RNAs were detected in the 5 dpi group, but not in the 30 dpi group, indicative of higher levels of infection at 5 dpi (Table 1) . Nonetheless, detection of icMERS-0 RNA in the 30 dpi group may be indicative of a viral adaptation and possible replication, but further studies would be required to confirm this hypothesis.
