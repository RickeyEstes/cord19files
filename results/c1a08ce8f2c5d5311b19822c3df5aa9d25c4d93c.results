The 213 patients were aged 2-88 years old with 51.1% of the sample being men. The median age of the patients was 48 years( IQR, 35-58.5, figure 1 ) . Including 33 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), the median age of the patients was 66 years(IQR, 57-76), ranging from 33-82 years old, with 22 (66.7%) being men and 19 (57.5%) patients having chronic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, stroke, and renal insufficiency. By the end of January 14, seven (3.27%) patients had died (four patients with renal failure and three had been on dialysis for years), and five of them were men. The average age of the patients who died was 60, with a range from 45-73 years old. The COVID-19 patients were divided into three groups: 1. Wuhan group (88 cases): Patients with a history of exposure to Wuhan. Sixty-one worked or lived in Wuhan, 22 had short-term exposure by staying in Wuhan for about two days, and five patients only visited a Wuhan railway station or airport for about two hours. These people were free to move around until January 23, and many subsequent cases of infection were caused by the Wuhan group. 2. Family group (56 cases): Patients who had not been to Wuhan within 20 days since the illness started and were infected by acquaintances, mainly family members and other relatives, friends, and colleagues. Some of them only had brief contact with infected people, such as talking or eating together. 3. Stranger group (69 cases): Patients who had not been to Wuhan within 20 days since the illness started and had been infected by strangers. The first patient was a bus driver, infected from his passengers, who began to cough and have a fever on January 4. One female patient, who had never been to Wuhan, was a sales clerk in a shopping center. Twenty-three patients were infected in hospital; twelve had uremia and were on dialysis in two hospitals. Eight medical staff in the non-infected ward were infected by confirmed patients. These staff worked in the gastroenterology department, intensive care unit, emergency department, joint surgery All rights reserved.

Seven of them became ill between January 21 and 25, one became ill on January 29. The number of confirmed patients was analyzed according to the date of symptom onset, asymptomatic patients used the date of admission instead (Figure 2 ) . The number peaked on January 21 followed by a gradual decline, most patients had a history of exposure to Wuhan before January 25, the number of locally infected cases peaked on January 26. The last patient from Wuhan began to have symptoms of coughing and fever on February 8, subsequent to having left Wuhan on January 22. The incubation period is more than 17 days. Most of the patients after February 8, 2020 were family members of confirmed patients. All admitted patients after February 9, 2020 were family members of confirmed patients.
