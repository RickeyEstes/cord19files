Identification and masking of a nonneutralizing epitope on ZIKV EDIII. To identify potentially immunodominant nonneutralizing epitopes on ZIKV EDIII, we analyzed the crystal structure of ZIKV E protein dimer (PDB identifier [ID] 5LBV) (30). We found a patch of surface area on EDIII that is buried in the full-length E protein dimer but becomes exposed in recombinant EDIII. Met375 is located in the center of this patch and protrudes from a bent ␤-strand ( Fig. 1A and B) . Hence, we engineered a glycan probe onto the epitope surrounding residue 375 (i.e., epitope 375) (Fig. 1C) . To this end, we introduced double mutations M375N/E377T to EDIII, which changed residue 375 to an N-linked glycosylation site. We expressed and purified the mutant EDIII, along with wild-type EDIII, in mammalian 293T cells. Both proteins contain a C-terminal Fc tag and were purified to homogeneity. The results from Western blotting showed that both proteins ran as dimers without boiling (due to the Fc dimeric tag and incomplete denaturing) and as monomers after boiling (due to complete denaturing). The mutant EDIII ran slower and with a slightly larger molecular weight than wild-type EDIII ( Fig. 2A) , indicating that the mutant EDIII was glycosylated after addition of a glycan probe at residue 375. To characterize the conformation of the mutant ZIKV EDIII, we investigated the binding interactions between ZIKV EDIII (wild type or mutant) and EDIII-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Among the MAbs used in this study, it has been shown previously that ZV-54, ZV-67, ZKA64-LALA, Z004, and SMZAb5 can potently neutralize ZIKV infections in mice and/or in vitro, whereas ZV-2 has no neutralizing activity in vitro (in vitro activities were characterized using a plaque-based neutralization assay) (Fig. 2B) (10, 23, 31, 32) . Our results showed that the mutant EDIII bound to ZV-54, ZV-67, ZKA64-LALA, Z004, and SMZAb5 but did not bind to ZV-2. In comparison, wild-type EDIII bound to all of the six MAbs (Fig. 2C) . The crystal structures of ZIKV E protein complexed with several of the MAbs have been determined previously by other groups (10, 31) . Based on these previously determined structures, we analyzed the binding sites of these MAbs on EDIII. The crystal structures of ZIKV E protein complexed with ZV-67 and of ZIKV EDIII complexed with ZV-2 revealed that ZV-67 binds to an area that is exposed on the E protein dimer and a likely receptor-binding site, whereas ZV-2 binds to an area centering epitope 375 that is buried on the E protein dimer but becomes artificially exposed on the recombinant EDIII ( Fig. 1B) (10) . Structural analysis of EDIII complexed with Z004 identified the lateral ridge (away from epitope 375) of EDIII as its recognizing epitope (31) . The structural bases for the binding of ZV-54, ZKA64-LALA, and SMZAb5 are not known, but these MAbs may also bind to functionally important regions on EDIII and away from epitope 375. Overall, these data further confirm that the mutant EDIII has successfully incorporated a glycan at residue 375, which blocked the binding of a nonneutralizing MAb ZV-2; they also reveal that despite the introduced glycan, the mutant EDIII retains its native structural conformation and antigenicity by binding to five different neutralizing MAbs. Measurement of neutralizing immunogenicity index of EDIII epitope 375. We previously defined the neutralizing immunogenicity index (NII) of an epitope as the contribution of the epitope to the overall neutralizing immunogenicity of the vaccine (29) . For epitope 375 on ZIKV EDIII, the NII can be calculated as the difference between the neutralizing immunogenicity of wild-type EDIII and that of the mutant EDIII, divided by the neutralizing immunogenicity of wild-type EDIII. To measure the NII of epitope 375 on ZIKV EDIII, we immunized mice with wild-type EDIII and mutant EDIII individually and measured the neutralizing antibody titers of the induced sera. The immunized mice included immunocompetent BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice as well as immunocompromised interferon-␣/␤ receptor (IFNAR)-deficient (Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ ) mice (C57BL/6 background). The results showed that compared to the wild-type EDIII, the mutant EDIII induced significantly higher titers of anti-ZIKV neutralizing antibodies ( Fig. 3A to C) but similar titers of ZIKV EDIII-specific IgG antibodies in all of the three types of immunized mice ( Fig. 3D to F). These data suggest that epitope 375 makes a negative contribution to the overall neutralizing immunogenicity of EDIII; furthermore, masking epitope 375 does not affect the total IgG antibody production but instead increases the overall neutralizing immunogenicity of the vaccine. We also calculated the NII of epitope 375. The values of NII varied slightly in different mice: Ϫ0.50 in BALB/c, Ϫ0.76 in C57BL/6, and Ϫ0.34 in Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ mice (Fig. 3G ). The negative NII confirms the negative contribution of epitope 375 to the overall neutralizing immunogenicity of the vaccine. The values for NII suggest that masking epitope 375 increases the overall neutralizing immunogenicity of the vaccine by 50%, 76%, and 34% [calculated using formula (PRNT 50-WT -PRNT 50-mutant )/PRNT 50-WT ϫ 100, where PRNT 50-WT is 50% plaque reduction neutralization titer for the wild type], respectively, in BALB/c, C57BL/6, and Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ mice. Therefore, these data reveal that epitope 375 is an immunodominant nonneutralizing epitope and that masking it can significantly improve the neutralizing immunogenicity of the EDIII vaccine. To investigate how different antigen doses affect the neutralizing immunogenicity of the mutant ZIKV EDIII vaccine, BALB/c mice were divided into six groups and each group was immunized with one of three doses (2, 10, and 20 g/mouse) of either the wild-type or mutant vaccine. The induced IgG and neutralizing antibodies were then compared. The results showed that for each of the doses tested, the wild-type and mutant EDIII vaccines induced the same amount of IgG antibody titers (Fig. 3H) , while the mutant EDIII elicited significantly higher titers of anti-ZIKV neutralizing antibodies than wild-type EDIII did (Fig. 3I ). In addition, vaccine doses were positively associated Ϫ/Ϫ mice were immunized with the wild-type (WT) and mutant (M375N/E377T) ZIKV EDIII vaccines. Sera were collected on day 10 post-2nd immunization for detection of neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV strain R103451 using the plaque reduction neutralization test (A to C) or IgG antibodies (D to F). PBS was included as a control. Neutralizing activity is expressed as 50% plaque reduction neutralizing antibody titer (PRNT 50 ). The data are presented as mean PRNT 50 Ϯ SEM of quadruplicate wells of 2-fold serially diluted sera (pooled from 6 mice in each group). Significant differences between the WT and mutant EDIII proteins are shown (*, P Ͻ 0.05; **, P Ͻ 0.01). The IgG antibody titers are expressed as the endpoint dilutions that remain positively detectable. (G) Measured neutralizing immunogenicity index (NII) for mutant EDIII protein using serum neutralizing antibody titers (PRNT 50 ) from BALB/c, C57BL/6, and Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ mice described above. The NII value was calculated based on the formula (PRNT 50-WT -PRNT 50-mutant )/PRNT 50-WT , where PRNT 50-WT and PRNT 50-mutant represent PRNT 50 neutralizing antibody titers for the wild-type and mutant EDIII proteins, respectively. In a separate experiment, BALB/c mice were further immunized with different doses of above WT and mutant ZIKV EDIII proteins. Sera were collected on day 10 post-2nd immunization for detection of IgG (H) and neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV strain R103451 (I) as described above. The IgG antibody titers are expressed as the endpoint dilutions that remain positively detectable. Neutralizing antibody titers are expressed as PRNT 50 . The data are presented as means Ϯ SEM of quadruplicate wells of 2-fold serially diluted sera (pooled from 5 mice in each group). The experiments were repeated three times, and similar results were obtained. with the induced neutralizing antibody titers (Fig. 3I ). These data suggest that immunization with increased doses of epitope 375-masked EDIII potentially improves the overall neutralizing immunogenicity of the vaccine. To identify the predominant IgG subtypes and also to investigate whether epitope masking affects subtype production, sera of BALB/c, C57BL/6, and Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ mice immunized with the wild-type and mutant EDIII proteins were evaluated for their IgG subtype contents. The results showed that IgG1 was the predominant subtype induced by both vaccines in all mouse strains (Fig. 4A ). On the other hand, no or low titers of IgG2a were detected in Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ and C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 4B) , a low titer of IgG2b was detected in Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ mice (Fig. 4C) , a low titer of IgG2c was detected in BALB/c mice ( Fig. 4D) , and a low titer of IgG3 was detected in all mouse strains tested (Fig. 4E) . Overall, compared to the wild-type EDIII, the mutant EDIII induced more IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and/or IgG2c subtypes in these mouse strains. These results demonstrate that although total IgG titers were similar in mice immunized by the wild-type and mutant EDIII vaccines, the associated IgG subtypes varied depending on the mouse strains tested. Enhanced efficacy of the mutant EDIII vaccine in protecting mice and their fetuses. We investigated the efficacy of the mutant ZIKV EDIII vaccine in protecting immunocompetent pregnant mice and their fetuses from ZIKV infection (immunocompetent adult mice, such as BALB/c, are nonlethal models for ZIKV infection). To this end, we immunized BALB/c mice with either the wild-type or mutant EDIII vaccine and challenged the pregnant mice with ZIKV. We then collected placenta and fetal brain 6 days postchallenge and measured the titers and RNA copies of ZIKV in these samples, respectively, using plaque and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays. Embryos were also collected for comparison of fetal status. The results showed that in contrast to the wild-type-EDIII-treated group, the mutant-EDIII-immunized pregnant mice had undetectable viral titers and RNA copies in their placentas and fetal brain ( Fig.  5A and B). Negative-control pregnant mice, treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), contained significantly higher viral titers and RNA copies in their tissues ( Fig. 5A FIG 4 IgG subtype antibodies induced by the wild-type and mutant ZIKV EDIII vaccines. BALB/c, C57BL/6, and Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ mice were immunized with the wild-type and mutant (M375N/E377T) EDIII protein vaccines. Sera were collected on day 10 post-2nd immunization for detection of IgG subtype antibodies (A to E) that specifically targeted ZIKV EDIII protein. PBS was included as a control. The antibody titers are expressed in the form of the endpoint titers calculated as the reciprocal of the highest detectable dilution. The data are presented as mean Ϯ SEM of mice in each group (n ϭ 6). The experiments were repeated three times, and similar results were obtained. *, P Ͻ 0.05 between the wild-type and mutant EDIII vaccines. and B). In addition, there were no significant morphological changes in the uteri of the wild-type-and mutant-EDIII-immunized pregnant mice, and the embryos from these mice were in good condition. In contrast, the PBS-treated mice showed severe resorption in their uteri and the embryos from these mice were invisible (Fig. 5C ). Collectively, compared to the wild-type EDIII vaccine, the mutant EDIII vaccine provides enhanced efficacy in protection of immunocompetent pregnant mice from ZIKV infection as evidenced by undetectable viral titers and RNA copies, although both the wild-type and mutant EDIII vaccines protect the fetuses of immunocompetent pregnant mice from ZIKV infection. We also evaluated the efficacy of the mutant ZIKV EDIII vaccine in protecting immunocompromised mice and their fetuses from ZIKV infection (immunocompromised mice are lethal models for ZIKV infection). To this end, we immunized female and male Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ mice with either the wild-type or mutant ZIKV EDIII vaccine. We then treated female and male mice differently. First, we challenged immunized female Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ pregnant mice with ZIKV, collected their tissues (including placenta and fetal brain) 6 days postchallenge, and measured the ZIKV titers in these tissues using the plaque assay. We also examined the embryos and uteri 6 days postchallenge. The results showed that compared to the wild-type-EDIII-treated group, the mutant-EDIIIimmunized female Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ pregnant mice had significantly lower viral titers in their lung, liver, heart, muscle (Fig. 6A) , and placenta and undetectable viral titers in fetal brain (Fig. 6B ). There were no significant morphological changes in the uteri. Moreover, all embryos were in good condition in the wild-type-and mutant-EDIII-treated mice (Fig. 6C ). In the negative-control group (i.e., PBS-treated female Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ pregnant mice), the viral titers were high in all the tested tissues and fetal brain, and there were significant morphological changes in the uteri, with severe fetal resorption or fetal death (Fig. 6) . Second, we challenged adult male Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ mice with low-dose (10 3 PFU) and high-dose (5 ϫ 10 4 PFU) ZIKV sequentially and observed them for survival and weight changes. The results showed that the male Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ mice, which were immunized with either the wild-type or mutant EDIII vaccine and then challenged with low-dose ZIKV, all survived 14 days post-1st challenge (Fig. 7A) ; their weight decreased slightly during days 4 to 7 postinfection but kept increasing steadily afterwards (Fig. 7B ). In contrast, in the negative-control group (i.e., PBS-treated mice), all mice had The pregnant mice (E10-E13) were challenged with ZIKV stain R103451 (2 ϫ 10 5 PFU) and detected for viral titers and viral RNAs in placenta and fetal brain using plaque (A) and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) (B) assays 6 days after challenge. Error bars indicate SEM (n ϭ 6). ***, P Ͻ 0.001. The detection limit for plaque assay was 20 PFU/g, and for qRT-PCR was 2.5 ϫ 10 2 RNA copies/g, of tissue. (C) Morphology of uteri and embryos in immunized pregnant BALB/c mice 6 days after ZIKV challenge. at least 25% weight loss and were humanely euthanized 10 days postinfection ( Fig. 7A and B). Moreover, the mutant-EDIII-immunized mice all survived the second, high-dose ZIKV challenge (100% survival) with no obvious weight loss. In contrast, only 67% of the wild-type-EDIII-immunized mice survived the second, high-dose ZIKV challenge, with considerable weight loss during days 7 to 12 postchallenge ( Fig. 7C and D) . Furthermore, neutralizing antibody titers in the mutant-EDIII-immunized mice were significantly higher than in the wild-type-EDIII-immunized mice before both the 1st and 2nd challenges, particularly after the 2nd challenge (Fig. 7E) . Therefore, the enhanced protective efficacy of the mutant EDIII vaccine against the high-dose ZIKV challenge was likely due to the higher serum neutralizing antibody titers that it induced. Overall, the above data reveal that the mutant EDIII vaccine protects immunocompromised female pregnant mice and their fetuses from ZIKV infection more effectively than the wild-type EDIII vaccine (as evidenced by undetectable or significantly reduced viral titers), and it also protects immunocompromised adult male mice from high-dose ZIKV infection more effectively (as evidenced by improved survival rate and steadily maintained weight). Enhanced passive protection efficacy of the mutant-ZIKV-EDIII-induced mouse sera. To understand the association between the enhanced protective efficacy of the mutant EDIII vaccine and the increased neutralizing antibody titers that it induced, passive protection experiments were performed using the wild-type or mutant-EDIIIinduced mouse sera. To this end, sera were pooled from each group and normalized for equal EDIII-specific IgG titers. Adult Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ mice were passively transferred with the pooled sera (either undiluted or after 1:5 dilution). The mice were then challenged with ZIKV and their viremia, survival rate, and weight changes were subsequently monitored. The results showed that viremia was significantly lower in the mice passively transferred with the mutant-EDIII-induced sera than in those transferred with the wild-type-EDIIIinduced sera (Fig. 8A ). In addition, while 77% of the mice transferred with the diluted mutant-EDIII-induced sera survived the ZIKV challenge, mice transferred with undiluted sera all survived the ZIKV challenge (100% survival), both of which only showed slight The pregnant mice (E10-E13) were challenged with ZIKV strain R103451 (10 3 PFU) and tested for viral titers using plaque assay in different tissues (including lung, liver, heart, and muscle [A] and placenta and fetal brain [B]) 6 days postchallenge. Error bars indicate SEM (n ϭ 6). *, **, and ***, P Ͻ 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001, respectively. The detection limit for lung and heart was 25 PFU/g, and for liver, muscle, placenta, and fetal brain was 20 PFU/g, of tissue.

In comparison, for mice transferred with diluted or undiluted wild-type-induced sera, the survival rates were significantly lower or lower than for those with diluted or undiluted mutant-EDIII-induced sera, only about 31% and 80%, respectively; the former group also had significant weight loss during days 8 to 10 postchallenge ( Fig. 8B and C) . Moreover, the mutant-EDIII-induced sera had significantly higher anti-ZIKV neutralizing antibody titers than the wild-type-EDIII-induced sera (Fig.  8D ). Negative-control mice transferred with the PBS-induced sera had a 0% survival rate at day 10 postchallenge; they also had the highest viral titers and most weight loss (Fig. 6) . The surviving Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ mice in the WT and mutant M375N/E377T groups were further challenged with ZIKV (R103451; 5 ϫ 10 4 PFU) and observed for survival (C) and weight (D) as described above (n ϭ 6).
