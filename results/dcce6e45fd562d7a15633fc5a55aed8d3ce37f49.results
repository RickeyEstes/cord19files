Toll-like receptor pathways are key regulators of SARS-CoV pathogenesis. Using a network integration approach to identify key regulators of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, a previous study that assayed host mRNA responses in C57BL/6J mice infected with 10 2 , 10 3 , 10 4 , or 10 5 PFU doses of SARS-CoV yielded a highly prioritized list of candidate genes involved in the host response to SARS-CoV (38, 39) . From these microarray data derived from the host mRNAs in the lung, network analyses identified host pathways regulating SARS-CoV pathogenesis that were previously uncharacterized (wound repair pathways [38] ) as well as pathways that have a well-established foothold in the literature in respect to SARS-CoV pathogenesis (innate immune pathways) (39) . Tolllike receptors (TLRs) play a critical role in the recognition of pathogens and induction of the innate immune response to many viruses, but TLR recognition of SARS-CoV is not well characterized. Two TLR-related genes that were highly ranked on the prioritized list are differentially expressed in response to SARS-CoV infection compared to expression in mock-inoculated mice: MyD88 and TLR3 ( Fig. 1A and B) .
