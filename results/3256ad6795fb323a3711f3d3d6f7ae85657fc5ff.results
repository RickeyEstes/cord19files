Residues 30-53 in H5N1-NS1 are sufficient for its interaction with mAb 2H6. As described previously 28 , the deletion of residues 42-53 of NS1 abolished its interaction with mAb 2H6. These residues lie in the helix α 2 (residues 30-53) of H5N1-NS1(RBD) and are well conserved between H5N1, H1N1 and H3N2 viruses (Fig. 1A) . This is consistent with the ability of mAb 2H6 to bind to both avian H5N1 and seasonal IAVs 28 . In order to determine if the helix α 2 of H5N1-NS1(RBD) is sufficient for the interaction with mAb 2H6, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed by using a synthetic peptide H5N1-NS1-24mer corresponding to helix α 2. As shown in Fig. 1B , mAb 2H6 bound to H5N1-NS1-24mer in a dose dependent manner, indicating that the helix α 2 of NS1(RBD) is sufficient for its interaction with mAb 2H6. In contrast, there was no binding between mAb 2H6 and an irrelevant control peptide of similar molecular weight. Within helix α 2, there is only one amino acid difference between H5N1 and H1N1-PR8, namely N48 in H5N1-NS1 and S48 in H1N1-PR8-NS1 (Fig. 1A) . To determine if residue 48 in NS1 is involved in its interaction with mAb 2H6, recombinant H5N1-NS1(RBD) and H1N1-PR8-NS1(RBD) proteins were bacterially expressed and purified for ELISA. The ELISA readings were similar for H5N1-NS1(RBD) and H1N1-PR8-NS1(RBD) when high concentrations of proteins were coated on the plate (Fig. 1C) . However, the readings were significantly higher for H5N1-NS1(RBD) at lower protein concentrations, indicating that that the single amino acid difference between helix α 2 of H5N1-NS1(RBD) and H1N1-PR8-NS1(RBD) affects their interactions with mAb 2H6 (Fig. 1C ). Residue 48 in NS1 is critical for its interaction with mAb 2H6. To further define the contribution of residue 48 in H5N1-NS1 to the interaction with mAb 2H6, two mutant proteins in which N was mutated to A and S respectively, were generated. Comparative ELISA showed that mAb 2H6 bound to NS1(RBD)-wild-type (WT) stronger than NS1(RBD)-N48S when different amounts of protein were coated on the plate and analyzed with 5 μ g/ml of mAb 2H6 ( Fig. 2A) . Similarly, when a fixed amount of protein (125 μ g/ml) was coated on the plate and analyzed with different concentrations of mAb 2H6, the binding to NS1(RBD)-N48S was significantly lower than NS1(RBD)-WT (Fig. 2B ). Furthermore, when N was substituted with A at residue 48, the interaction between mAb 2H6 and NS1(RBD) was totally abolished in all the conditions tested ( Fig. 2A,B) . This result suggests that the difference at residue 48 is the main reason for the stronger binding of mAb 2H6 to H5N1-NS1(RBD) when compared to H1N1-PR8-NS1(RBD) (Fig. 1 ). Since both N48 and S48 are polar amino acids while A48 has no side chain, it is probable that the formation of hydrogen bonds is important for the interaction between mAb 2H6 and NS1. MAb 2H6 binds differently to H1N1-PR8 virus when compared with mutant viruses carrying substitution at residue 48 in NS1. Since mAb 2H6 binds to bacterially-expressed NS1 protein of H5N1 and H1N1-PR8 with different affinities, it is important to investigate whether this holds true for NS1 expressed in infected cells. Thus, recombinant PR8 (rgPR8) viruses expressing the NS1 protein containing a single amino acid substitution at residue 48 (rgPR8-NS1-S48A and rgPR8-NS1-S48N) were generated using a reverse genetics system. Subsequently, A549 cells were infected with each virus at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 respectively and plaque assay was used to determine the amount of virus secreted at different time points post-infection. As shown in Fig. 3A , although the viral titer was slightly lower in the case of rgPR8-NS1-S48N infection, the overall growth rates of WT and mutant viruses were similar from 12 to 60 hours post-infection (h.p.i.). This is consistent with a previous report showing that substitution of residue 48 in NS1 does not affect viral replication in vitro 30 . Next, 293T cells were infected with 2 MOI of viruses and cell lysates were collected at 12 and 24 h.p.i. to determine the rate of viral protein synthesis. Consistent with the virus growth kinetics, the expressions of structural proteins NP and M1 were similar for all 3 viruses at both time-points (Fig. 3B ). The level of NS1, as determined by using a rabbit anti-NS1 polyclonal antibody, was also comparable for all 3 viruses. However, mAb 2H6 bound to rgPR8-NS1-S48N virus significantly stronger than rgPR8-NS1-WT virus containing S48 residue in Mismatches are shown in white letters. NS1(RBD) is composed of 3 α -helices as shown above the sequence. The region corresponding to helix α 2 (residues 30-53) is boxed. (B) Peptide ELISA was performed to determine the region of NS1 sufficient for binding to mAb 2H6.

(C) Comparative ELISA was performed to determine the ability of NS1(RBD) of H1N1-PR8 and H5N1 to bind to mAb 2H6. Wells were coated with serially diluted proteins and probed with 5 μ g/ml mAb 2H6.

As expected, mAb 2H6 did not bind to rgPR8-NS1-S48A virus.
