Additional Figure 1 presents the results of applying a Bayesian outbreak detection algorithm (BODA) [1] to the number of fevers measured in the ED per thermometer. The light blue and dark blue areas show the weekly and daily rates of fevers, respectively. For example, data from the first week of August 2011 show that around 5 fevers were measured per thermometer. The outbreak detection algorithm produces an epidemic threshold (red lines) that is used to judge whether an outbreak is detected. When the observed fever rates exceed this threshold, an alarm is declared (red triangles). Using fever rates from the Boston ED, the algorithm successfully detected both the autumn-winter wave of the 2009-2010 swine flu pandemic and the seasonal flu epidemic of 2011. Outbreak detection was successful for both the weekly data and the daily data, even though the daily data appear quite noisy to the eye. False alarms are an important concern in outbreak detection, since they lead to wasted effort and potential "boy who cried wolf" situations. Here, we defined a false alarm as any alarm issued outside of the epidemic periods shown in the figure (see the Methods section for more details). A key advantage of the Bayesian outbreak detection algorithm is that it allows the expected number of false alarms to be established prospectively. In the figure, we arbitrarily employed the criterion that an average of ≤3 false alarms should be issued per year. Both the weekly and daily analyses satisfied this criterion (weekly, 0 false alarms; daily, 2 apparent false alarms in 2 years). In additional analyses, we employed false alarm criteria ranging from ≤1 to ≤5 per year. While the weekly outbreak detection analysis showed diminishing ability to detect the outbreaks for low false alarm criteria, the daily analysis detected both outbreaks for all of the false alarm criteria, suggesting that daily fever data provided robust evidence of these outbreaks (Additional Table 1 ). To examine the timeliness that could be offered by using real-time data instead of weekly data, we compared the dates at which the algorithm was able to detect periods of elevated febrile activity based on daily and weekly rates of fever. As compared with the weekly data, the daily data provided 18 days of advanced notice for the H1N1 pandemic and 5 days of advanced notice for the seasonal flu outbreak with ≤3 false alarms per year. These indications are promising, especially because weekly CDC surveillance on influenza-like illness and laboratory-confirmed influenza is usually subject to several additional days of delay in practice, as the data are compiled. However, our analysis was importantly limited by the fact that our analysis only investigated two epidemic periods, both of which were of influenza.
