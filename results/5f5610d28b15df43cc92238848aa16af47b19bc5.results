A total of 123 questionnaires were distributed and 56 responses were received, giving a response rate of 46%. Five responses had to be excluded due to lack of data leaving 51 questionnaires eligible for analysis. Nine participants were senior nursing staff (nursing officer or above). Twenty-six participants (more than half) had more than 10 years clinical experience and the majority of them (45) had received relevant training in IFT. Thirty-three participants had experience of using their escort kits in the past but 19 participants indicated that the escort kit had too much equipment. Thirty nurses had encountered en route adverse events during IFT and the most common physiologic deterioration was systolic hypotension (n = 14), followed by oxygen desaturation (n = 10) and neurological deterioration (n = 9). Thirty-one participants had encountered equipment mishaps during transport (Fig. 1) . Most participants were familiar with the monitoring devices available in ambulances but they were less familiar with the availability of the various airway devices. There was poor knowledge of the availability of resuscitation agents in the ambulance, specifically the drug adrenaline. A summary of participants' knowledge of items available on ambulances is shown in Tables 1 and 2. Overall, participants' total scores ranged from 24 to 37 (out of 40) with a mean of 30.6 (95% confidence interval 29.7-31.5). Neither higher job ranking nor relevant training were associated with better participant scores. The only factor that gave rise to a statistically significant difference (median difference = 1.98; 95% confidence interval 0.33-3.62) in scores was clinical experience of more than ten years (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test, Fig. 2 ).
