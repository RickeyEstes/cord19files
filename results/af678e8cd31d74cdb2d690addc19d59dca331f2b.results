First, we estimated two distributions from existing datasets in humans, i.e. the incubation period and the time from illness onset to death. We used a published dataset from a nosocomial outbreak in Jos, Nigeria, in 1970 [19] , to determine the best-fit gamma distributions to be a mean of 12.8 days (95% credible interval (CrI): 10.7-15.0) and a standard deviation of 4.6 days (CrI: 2.8-6.6) for the incubation period, and a mean of 13.8 days (CrI: 10.8-17.0) and a standard deviation of 7.6 days (CrI: 5.0-10.6) for the time from illness onset to death (electronic supplementary material, appendix A and figure S1). By incorporating these estimates into our analysis of the incidence data (Material and methods section), weekly exposure rates of humans to LF were estimated. We used a model that rests on the renewal process of the viral exposure in humans, accounting for the time delay due to the incubation period and the time from illness onset to death. The formulation resulted in two Poisson-and binomially distributed likelihood functions for describing the LF incidence and mortality, respectively (electronic supplementary material, appendix B). We identified two distinct periods of a year which were separately analysed owing to considerably different levels of observed transmission activity: (i) a low-risk period with a weekly exposure rate of 6.4 (CrI: 0-32.5; maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE): 9.6) lasting from week 9 (26 February to 4 March in 2018, CrI: 5 -13) to week 50 (10 December to 16 December in 2018; CrI: 47 -52), and (ii) the rest of the year, characterized by a higher risk of contracting the virus, with the average weekly exposure rate reaching 24.7 (CrI: 0-111.7; MLE: 38.1), which exceeded the low-risk period by approximately four times. The CFR was estimated at 4.9% (CrI: 0-54.4; MLE: 8.9%). If we assume the unbiased value of the CFR at 2%, the reporting coverage can be estimated to be as low as 40%. The overlaid incidence data and variations in the parameter estimates are shown in figure 1. For comparison, an analogous model with a single (constant) exposure rate yielded a less plausible fit to the data (Akaike information criterion (AIC) values: 3679.2 for a single-and 2877.2 for a two-period model). Subsequently, we assessed whether a seasonal increase in the number of infected rodents can solely explain the increase in the incidence of LF infections in humans in the high-risk period. Using the dynamic transmission model for LF infection in rodents (Material and methods section; electronic supplementary material, figure S2 ), the number of infected animals was predicted to reach its maximal level in the middle of May, while the minimal level was observed in December (electronic supplementary material, figure S3 ). The LF incidence in humans which is thought to correlate royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstb Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 374: 20180268 with the LF level of infection in rodents controversially peaks in the first two to three months of the year. During that period, the number of infected rodents was smaller than for the rest of the year. We therefore propose that a factor other than seasonal fluctuations in the number of infected rodents may play a role in driving LF seasonal epidemics. To search for such a factor, we analysed the correlative power of the LF incidence rates and climatological variables, such as rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, specific humidity and precipitable water. We found that only the rainfall seasonal pattern was significantly correlated with the seasonal incidence of LF in humans ( p , 0.01, figure 2 ). This was also confirmed by the start and end times of the high/low exposure periods, which approximately coincide with the start and the end of the rainy season (cf. figure 1b; electronic supplementary material, figure S4 ). Therefore, an event associated with rainfall patterns contributes to the incidence of LF in humans, e.g. this could be the change in seasons and seasonal migration or a change in the behaviour of the rodents. Last, we calculated the relative frequency of contact of humans with infected rodents using the ratio of the estimated weekly exposure rate to the density of infected rodents predicted by our transmission model (figure 3). After assigning the average frequency of contact in the low-risk exposure period as 1, we determined that the relative risk of human exposure was 5.3 times higher on average during the highrisk exposure period. The maximal value of 6.7 was identified in the first week of the year.
