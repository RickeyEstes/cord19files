Overall, I. suis infection was found in 217 litters of suckling piglets (27.8%) derived from 70 farms (66.7%). The coccidia of Eimeria genus (E. debliecki, E. polita, E. suis) were detected in only 20 litters (2.6%) from 12 farms (11.5%). E. polita oocysts were detected in 15 litters (1.9%), E. debliecki in 11 litters (1.4%) and E. suis in 3 litters (0.4%), respectively. More than one Eimeria species occurred in 7 litters (0.9%). In five litters (0.6%) I. suis and E. polita occurred simultaneously. The mean OPG values in litters of piglets were: 5748.5 (7-150000) for I. suis and 3219.4 (7-43600) for Eimeria spp. oocysts. There were not significant differences between the OPG values (I. suis and Eimeria spp.) obtained in piglets from different types of farms. As shown in Table 1 , on the large farms I. suis infection was detected the most often (31.7% of litters), whereas on the small farms frequency of this infection was found to be twice as rare. The situation with Eimeria spp. was just the opposite: for the large and medium sized farms Eimeria spp. oocysts were very uncommon and detected only in some individual litters, while on the small farms these infections were found in as many as 28.9% litters. The prevalence of I. suis in piglets was significantly higher in large farms, however; the prevalence of Eimeria spp. was significantly higher in small farms. The examination of faecal samples collected from sows (mothers of examined piglets), yielded the following results: I. suis oocysts were found in 18 sows (6.7%) and Eimeria spp. (E. debliecki. E. polita, E. perminuta, E. suis, E. scabra) in 16 sows (6%). E. debliecki oocysts were detected in 11 sows (4.1%), E. polita in 10 sows (3.7%), E. perminuta in 4 sows (1.5%), E. suis in 3 sows (1.1%) and E. scabra in 2 sows (0.7%). More than one Eimeria species occurred in 10 sows (3.7%). In only two sows (0.8%) I. suis and Eimeria oocysts (E. debliecki and E. polita) occurred simultaneously. The prevalence of Eimeria spp. in sows was significantly higher in small farms. There were not significant differences between the prevalence of I. suis in different types of farms. The mean OPG values in sows were: 111.3 (7-500) for I. suis and 299.5 (7-3000) for Eimeria spp. oocysts. There were not significant differences between the OPG values (I. suis and Eimeria spp.) obtained in sows from different types of farms. From 72 sows delivering I. suis infected piglets just in 12 sows (16.7%) I. suis oocysts and in as little as 4 (5.6%) Eimeria spp. oocysts were found. In the remaining 56 sows (77.8%) no cases of coccidian infections were detected.
