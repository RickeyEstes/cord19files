Viruses were detected in 40 subjects during acute exacerbations. These viruses included the following: RV, 30 subjects (75%); EV, 17 subjects (42.5%); influenza virus type A, 4 subjects (10%); influenza virus type B, 1 subject (2.5%); and RSV, 1 subject (2.5%). Eleven subjects had dual viruses, and 1 subject tested positive for three viruses. Following the acute exacerbation, persistent-airway-obstruction was observed in 10 subjects (25%) and airway recovery was observed in 30 subjects (75%). Characteristics of these groups are described in Table 1 . There was no significant difference in atopy between groups. However, the persistent-airway-obstruction group used a significantly higher maintenance dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) preexacerbation and had a longer duration of asthma. Details of the acute asthma episode for the persistent-airway-obstruction group compared with those for the airway-recovery group are described in Table 2 . On examination in the emergency depart- Fig 1) . In the airway-recovery group, there was a highly significant ‚å¨%FEV 1 , resulting in values at recovery that were similar to those for stable subjects with asthma. In the persistent-airway-obstruction group, however, FEV 1 percent predicted did not improve. In the airway-recovery group, both the CCQ and the ACQ scores showed highly significant improvements, with visit 2 values similar to those for stable subjects with asthma. For the persistent-airway-obstruction group, there was improvement in the CCQ and the ACQ scores; however, asthma continued to be uncontrolled postexacerbation. At visit 1, subjects in the persistent-airway-obstruction group had a similar inflammatory cell profile to that in stable subjects with asthma. In contrast, the airway-recovery group had an increase in total cell count (Fig 2, top, A) and neutrophil count (Fig 2, bottom, B ) compared to those in stable subjects with asthma. On recovery, neutrophil counts in the airway-recovery group decreased significantly (Table 4 ). In contrast, subjects in the persistentairway-obstruction group showed no significant decreases in inflammatory cell counts postexacerbation.
