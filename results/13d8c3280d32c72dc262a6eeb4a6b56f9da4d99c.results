The temperature of the sows remained within normal physiological range throughout the experiment, except for control sow 761 which reached 40 8C on day 2 PF (see below). None of the sows required obstetrical assistance. Gestation lengths did not differ significantly between principal sows (range 113-117 days) and control sows (range 114-115 days). Control sow 761 which had delivered nine live and one stillborn pig developed a severe metritis/mastitis on day 2 PF. Therefore, this sow and her litter were excluded from the experiment and euthanised. The remaining three control sows delivered a total of 39 live piglets ( Table 1) . Five of these were small and had birth weights lower than 900 g. However, the average birth weight for the control piglets was still 1297 g (sd 286 g). Neither stillborn pigs, mummified foetuses nor weakborn piglets were seen in the three control litters. However, six control piglets died between day 2 and 13 after birth ( Table 1 ). The finding of traumatic lesions in the head and/or body together with milk-filled stomachs, indicated these piglets to be crushed to death by the dams. In fact, no other explanations of death could be found for these piglets. The remaining control piglets survived with no other clinical signs than occasional slight diarrhoea. Clinically, the principal sows did not appear to be affected by the PRRSV infection, except for sow 882 which had decreased milk production. Therefore, the litter of this sow was supplied with milk replacer from day 2 after birth. In total, the six principal sows delivered 66 liveborn pigs and 20 deadborn pigs, an average of 3.3 or 25% deadborn pigs per principal sow (Table 1 ). The level of delivered deadborn pigs was significantly higher ðp < 0:05Þ for the principal sows than for the three control sows which did not deliver any deadborn pigs (Table 1 ). There was no significant difference between principal and control sows in the level of total pigs born. The deadborn principal pigs comprised two stillborn pigs, and 18 dead foetuses with varying degrees of autolysis and mummification. Ten liveborn principal pigs had birth weights lower than 900 g, and the average birth weight of liveborn principal pigs was 1225 g (sd 283 g). Eight piglets appeared weak at birth, and one of these with a birth weight just below 400 g was euthanised immediately after blood sampling. In general, neonatal pigs in the control group appeared considerably more vigorous and thrifty compared to those in the principal group. During the observation period, another 13 principal piglets died ( Table 1) . None of these deaths could be attributed to crushing by the sows. Furthermore, the health status of the surviving principals varied considerably. Varying degrees of unthriftiness were seen between as well as within the principal litters. Neither coughing nor other clear signs of respiratory disease were observed in any of the principal piglets, and as time progressed, the general health improved for the majority of the principal piglets. At the end of the observation period, however, only the surviving piglets from sows 641 and 721 appeared to have fully recovered.
