NPCs express the MHV receptor CEACAM1a and are infected by JHMV JHMV is a neurotropic coronavirus with relatively restricted tropism for glial cells through recognition and binding to the receptor carcinoembryonic antigen-cell adhesion molecule 1a (CEACAM1a) (Hirai et al., 2010; Thorp and Gallagher, 2004) . CEACAM1a expression in mouse tissues is widespread and can be detected on the surface of a variety of epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and reproductive tracts, as well as on small vascular endothelia and hematopoietic cells (Hemmila et al., 2004) . However, CEACAM1a expression is not ubiquitous, and although it is known to be located at the surface of resident cells of the CNS including glia, expression by neural stem or progenitor cells has not been evaluated. To determine if NPCs derived from C57BL/6 transgenic mice engineered to express GFP (GFP-NPCs) express CEACAM1a, mRNA was isolated from cultured NPCs and receptor expression was evaluated by PCR. Using CEACAM1a-specific primers, PCR amplicons were detected in NPCs, as well as mixed splenocytes from C57BL/6 mice acting as controls (Fig. 1A) , and nucleotide sequencing confirmed homology with the specified region of the gene (data not shown). Furthermore, cell surface expression of CEACAM1a was confirmed with more than 90% of NPCs expressing the receptor as determined via flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 1B) . We next infected Sox2 þ GFP-expressing NPCs with JHMV to assess susceptibility to infection. Infected NPC cultures were fixed 72 h post-infection (p.i.) and stained with an antibody specific for the carboxyl terminus of the JHMV nucleocapsid (N) protein and subsequently imaged using fluorescence microscopy. Compared to non-infected NPCs that form a confluent monolayer when grown in tissue culture-treated, matrigel-coated vessels, Sox2þ NPCs infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.1 displayed JHMV-specific syncytia formation by 72 h post-infection ( Fig. 2A) . Correspondingly, increasing viral titers were detected when plaque forming unit (PFU) assays were performed on supernatants harvested from JHMV-infected NPC cultures at 24, 48, and 72 h p.i. (Fig. 2B) . Furthermore, determination of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released into the supernatants of infected cultures at defined time p.i. revealed increased NPC death over time, ranging from 10.1 71.5% at 24 h p.i., increasing to 29.7 73.7% at 48 h p.i., and peaking at 35.4 7 3.6% by 72 h (Fig. 2C ). As JHMV replication has been reported to occur via CEACAM1a-dependent and independent mechanisms (Nakagaki and Taguchi, 2005) , we performed a monoclonal antibody blockade to determine the role of CEACAM1a in the spread of JHMV infection in cultured NPCs (Fig. 2D ). By 72 h p.i., significant (p o0.05) inhibition of viral replication was observed in anti-CEACAM1a-treated cells (4.4 Â 10 3 7 1.4 Â 10 3 PFU/mL, n¼ 3) when compared to non-treated, JHMVinfected NPCs (2.6 Â 10 5 75.4 Â 10 4 PFU/mL).
