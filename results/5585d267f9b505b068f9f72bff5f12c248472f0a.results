Totally 1,916 people have been evacuated from Wuhan, among them 17 have been confirmed 2019-nCov infected. Based on the data above, the infection rate was calculated to be 1.1% (95% CI 0.4%-3.1%) using one group meta-analysis method with random effect model (Figure 1 ). According to the mayor of Wuhan, who introduced the progression of epidemic prevention and control of NCP, there are still more than 9 million people staying in Wuhan at that time. We estimated that there are 10 million people in Wuhan, considered the infection rate calculated above, it is estimated that almost 110,000 (95% CI: 40,000-310,000) people were infected with 2019-nCov in Wuhan around Feb 2, 2020, with an assumption that the risk of infection of evacuees is similar to Chinese in Wuhan.
