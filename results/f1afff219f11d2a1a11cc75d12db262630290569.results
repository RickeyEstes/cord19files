Collected samples were tested for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3, and 4, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus 229E, NL63 and OC43, and enterovirus, using the AnyplexTM II RV16 detection kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea). A total of 409 samples negative for 16 respiratory viruses were examined for detection of influenza C virus. Five samples were positive for influenza C virus, including four samples from 2015 and one sample from 2016 (Table 1) . Unfortunately, we only isolated C/Seoul/APD462/2015 virus. Sequence of viral genes showed only the C/Seoul/APD462/2015 virus was fully sequenced for seven segments. The phylogenetic analysis of individual genes was performed using the reference sequences from the influenza research database (IRD). As shown in the HE phylogenetic tree, C/Seoul/APD401/2015, C/Seoul/APD462/2015 and C/Cheongju/GPD805/2015 fell into the C/ Sao Paulo lineage (Fig. 1) . Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses of individual genes revealed a close proximity of C/Seoul/APD462/2015 to C/Tokyo/4/2014 and C/Victoria/2/2012 strains. The sequence identity score for each pair was calculated by the Sequence Demarcation Tool (SDTv1.2) program. All encoded protein sequence identity of C/Seoul/APD462/2015 strain with C/Tokyo/4/ 2014 or C/Victoria/2/2012 strains showed high identity of 99.6% (Fig. 2) . Comparison of the amino acid sequences of each segment of C/ Seoul/APD462/2015 with C/Victoria/2/2012 revealed several changes in amino acids ( Table 2
