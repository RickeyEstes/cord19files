Optimization of primer combinations. The optimization of amplification involved primer combinations with a high sensitivity and no false positive. A set of primers suitable for CPA detection of PEDV were designated by CPR-2, DF5B1, DF5F-12, F3-1, and B3-1 (Table 1) . DF5F-12 and DF5B1 were labeled with FAM and biotin, respectively. Primer combination, CPR-2, DF5B1, DF5F-12, F3-1, and B3-1 gave a high sensitivity with no false positive (Fig. 1a up) . Gel electrophoresis results below the strip graph confirmed the CPA reaction corresponding to the results on the strip (Fig. 1a down) . Optimization of CPA assay. Optimization of CPA assay included concentration optimizations of external primers, probe and cross primer. Using concentrations ranging from 0.1 μL to 0.6 μL, the optimal concentrations of external primers were determined to be 0.1 μL of 20 μM F3-1 and 0.2 μL of 20 μM B3-1 (Fig. 1b) . Probes were optimized by testing concentrations (from 0.2 μL to 0.8 μL) of one probe against a fixed concentration of another probe. The optimal concentrations were 0.3 μL and 0.6μL for 20 μM DF5F-12 and 20 μM DF5B1, respectively (Fig. 1c) . The optimal concentration of the cross primer was 0.4 μL of 20 μM CPR-2 after testing with concentrations ranging from 0.1 μL to 1 μL. (Fig. 1d ). Other reagents for the assay including MgSO 4 , betaine, deoxy-ribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), and Bst DNA polymerase were also optimized. The final volumes of dNTP (10 mM), MgSO 4 (50 mM), betaine (5 M), and Bst DNA polymerase (10 U/μL) were 0.8, 0.4, 6, and 1 μL, respectively ( Fig. 1e-h) . A reaction temperature of 63 °C was selected for the CPA assays, similar to previous report 8 . The reaction time was extended by 15 and 30 min on the basis of the optimum experimental conditions to determine the relationship between reaction time and sensitivity. Our results indicated that, when CPA reactions were incubated for 90 min, favorable results were obtained without nonspecific amplification (Fig. 1k) . The sensitivity of CPA was higher than that under 60 min (Fig. 1i) and 75 min (Fig. 1j ). In addition, amplification results from the optimized CPA assay correlated 100% with those based on gel electrophoresis. Finally, the total volume for the CAP amplification was 20 μL. The optimal concentration of each reagent was as follows: CPR-2, 0. Sensitivity and specificity of reverse transcription cross-priming amplification and nucleic acid test strip (RT CPA-NATS) system. Ten times dilution series of plasmid was tested using CPA-NATS to determine its sensitivity. At the same time, reverse transcription PCR(RT-PCR) was used to confirm the CPA-NATS results. The results showed that 10 −6 diluted plasmid could be detected consistently by CPA-NATS. However, results with 10 −7 diluted plasmid were inconsistent (Fig. 2a) . Thus, 10 −6 was considered the detection limit of CPA-NATS, which had a similar sensitivity compared to that of RT-PCR (Fig. 2c) . The specificity of the RT CPA-NATS method for detecting PEDV was evaluated by testing other common pathogenic viruses of swine, including porcine circovirus virus (PCV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), and porcine pseudorabies virus (PRV). Data showed 100% specificity against these viruses (Fig. 2b,d) , comparable to RT-PCR. Fig. 3b-d) . The test results of the clinical specimens by RT CPA-NATS and RT-PCR were also summarized in Table 2 . The number of PEDV-positive samples detected by RT CPA-NATS was 2 of 20 in Chengdu, 3 of 11 in Harbin, and 5 of 10 in Jinan (Table 3) . However, two samples (one from Chengdu and one from Jinan) were detected positive by RT CPA-NATS but negative by RT-PCR. Another sample from Harbin was detected positive by RT-PCR but negative by RT CPA-NATS. Additionally, the system was validated by technicians with limited laboratory trainings on a pig farm. Six fecal swab specimens from sick piglets showing disease symptoms Suspected infected by PEDV were collected and tested for PEDV. Two of the six specimens (2# and 3#) were tested positive (Fig. 4a) , which was in agreement with the results of RT-PCR (Fig. 4b) .
