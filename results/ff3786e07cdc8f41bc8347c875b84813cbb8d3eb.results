The final study included 207 patients, and the clinical underlying diseases are summarized in Table 2 . Of the 207 patients, 139 patients (67%) eventually proved to have infection, 12 patients (6%) had noninfectious causes, 36 patients (17%) had no remarkable chest CT, and the remaining 20 patients (10%) had extrathoracic infectious focus. Of 139 patients with infectious pneumonia, more than two pathogens were identified in 11 patients (8%). Therefore, a total of 150 pathogens were identified (139+11 pathogens). Bacterial, fungal, viral, and Pneumocystis jiroveci organisms accounted for 48 (35%), 55 (40%), 42 (30%), and four (2.9%) of 150 pathogens, respectively. In 12 patients with noninfectious cause for lung abnormalities, final diagnoses were reached by biopsy (graft-versus-host disease, relapsing leukemia, and all-trans-retinoic acid syndrome), observing the clinical course (overhydration in four patients, drug toxicity in two patients improved after drug off), and BAL (diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in three patients). In 36 patients with no remarkable chest CT, the absence of lung abnormality was confirmed by the absence of lung lesions on both clinico-laboratory data and follow-up chest radiographs for two weeks after the no remarkable chest CT. Final diagnoses in 20 patients of the extrathoracic fever focus group were eight urinary tract infections, ten catheter-related infections, and two pseudomembranous colitis.
