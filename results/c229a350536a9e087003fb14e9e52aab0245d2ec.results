Differential inhibition of FMDV RNA infectivity by 29Omethyl-antisense oligonucleotides targeting AUG1 and AUG2 in tissue culture cells FMDV RNA translation initiation is peculiar in that protein synthesis can be initiated at two start codons, AUG1 and AUG2 (Fig. 1A) . While both AUGs are fully conserved in field isolates, AUG2 is used more efficiently than AUG1 in infected cells [11, 39] . Earlier works have addressed the study of AUG codon usage driven by the FMDV IRES using reporter genes [11, 12, 40, 41] . However, little information was available concerning the influence of the complete viral RNA sequence on the accessibility of the translation start region to small molecules. To fill this gap, we made use of an infectious cDNA clone [42] to study the capacity of 29OMe AONs to inhibit FMDV RNA translation in BHK-21 cells. To ascertain the optimum inhibitory conditions, a concentration range (1-20 nM) of three oligonucleotides, AUG1, AUG2 and SCR (harboring a scrambled sequence, Table 1 ) were annealed to FMDV RNA for 20 min at 37uC prior to transfection of BHK-21 cells. Virus yield was determined 24 hpt relative to a parallel assay conducted without AONs (Fig. S1 ). Inhibition of FMDV titer was dose-dependent and sequencespecific, being 10 or 20 nM equally efficient in inhibiting the viral titer. Thus, 10 nM was used in all subsequent assays. Furthermore, no effect on the transfection efficiency of the FMDV RNA was observed in the presence of increasing amounts of SCR AON relative to the FMDV RNA alone (Fig. S1 ); in addition no toxicity was observed when cells were incubated with any of these AONs during 48 hr by cell staining. FMDV multiplication was inhibited in the presence of both, AUG1 and AUG2 AONs (Fig. 1B) . Differences in FMDV yield inhibition induced by AONs were analyzed by a paired two-sided Student t-test; differences were considered significant when P,0.05. Overall, in agreement with the P values obtained in the t-test, 60% was the threshold separating inhibitor from noninhibitor molecules. The oligonucleotide SCR had no effect on FMDV RNA infectivity (Fig. 1B) , demonstrating that the impact of AUG1 and AUG2 AONs on viral gene expression was sequence specific. Moreover, the decrease of virus yield induced by AUG2 (22% relative to the control assay) was 3-fold higher than that of AUG1 (60% of the control RNA), indicating that the best target for inhibition of viral replication is by blocking the AUG2 region. To confirm the inhibition of viral protein synthesis by AUG1 and AUG2 AONs, a western blot against the VP1 structural protein present in cytoplasmic extracts of BHK-21 transfected cells prepared prior to cell detachment was performed (Fig. 1C) . In comparison to cells transfected with FMDV RNA incubated with the SCR AON, or the control without any AON, the intensity of VP1 confirmed that there was a strong inhibition of intracellular viral protein synthesized and accumulated 24 hpt in the presence of AUG2.
