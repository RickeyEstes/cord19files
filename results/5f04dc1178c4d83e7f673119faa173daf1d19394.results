Mapping the 3 0 boundary of the Edr frameshift signal The 5 0 and 3 0 boundaries of the Edr frameshift signal were not characterized in the previous study (20) , but we began our analysis with the assumption that the 5 0 boundary is the GGGAAAC heptamer located within the RF1/RF2 overlap region. A 1230 bp portion of the Edr gene containing this slippery sequence and flanked by substantial lengths of open reading frame was cloned by PCR into the expression vector pKT0 (28) (see Materials and Methods) to generate pKT0/Edr ( Figure 1 ). This plasmid contains a bacteriophage SP6 (and T7) promoter for the generation of in vitro transcripts and provides an optimized (Kozak) initiation codon for the translation of the cloned Edr segment. The cloned PCR product was sequenced to confirm that no errors had been introduced into the Edr sequence. To assess crudely the extent to which 3 0 sequences were required for frameshifting, a series of run-off transcripts containing varying lengths of Edr sequence were prepared following digestion of the plasmid with NdeI, AvrII, HindIII or BamHI and transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase ( Figure 1 ). The mRNAs were translated in the RRL in vitro translation system and the products analysed by SDS/PAGE ( Figure 2 ). Frameshifting was observed in all cases with each mRNA showing an efficiency of $30% (hereafter the 'wild-type' efficiency) in good agreement with the value obtained by Shigemoto et al. (20) . The sizes of the non-frameshifted and frameshifted species were consistent with those expected following frameshifting at the RF1/RF2 overlap region (see legend to Figure 2 ). As the mRNA from the NdeI-digested plasmid (linearized 105 bp downstream of the slippery sequence) stimulated wild-type levels of frameshifting, subsequent investigations focussed on regions upstream of this restriction site. To further delineate the essential sequences, in-frame deletions of 24, 63 or 90 nt were introduced into pKT0/Edr in the region between the GGGAAAC motif and the NdeI site ( Figure 3A ). The plasmids were linearized with HindIII before in vitro transcription and translation. As shown in Figure 3B , efficient frameshifting was observed only with pKT0/Edr/ D24nt, hence the stimulatory RNA is in fact longer than that proposed in the original study (20) (Figure 3A , emboldened bases), with a 3 0 boundary located between the 5 0 edge of the deletions of pKT0/Edr/D63 and D24. In addition to the non-frameshifted and frameshifted species, an additional longer product was seen in these translation reactions ( Figure 3B , asterisk) and in fact, in all translations of pKT0/ Edr to a greater or lesser extent. The identity of this product is uncertain. It is unlikely to be an alternative frameshift product, since its size was unaffected by changes in the length of the mRNA downstream of the frameshift site. However, given that its intensity paralleled that of the non-frameshifted product and its size was roughly double that of the nonframeshifted product, it may represent a stable dimer.
