Identification of host cell factors required for the antiviral activity of MxA. To identify factors required for the antiviral activity of MxA, we developed a genome-wide siRNA screening assay on a well-established A549 human lung epithelial cell line stably over-expressing human MxA (A549-MxA) 16 . To easily monitor virus replication a reporter virus was generated based on the highly MxA-sensitive influenza A/ Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) virus 17 by incorporating a Renilla (RL) luciferase reporter construct into the NS segment (H5N1-RL) as previously described by Reuther and colleagues (Supplementary Figure S1a) 23 . Furthermore, to allow utilization of this highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions several positively charged amino acids were removed from the hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site to render it monobasic, and thus classifying the virus as a low pathogenic avian virus (Supplementary Figure S1b) 24, 25 . In the presence of MxA, virus replication is inhibited resulting in low levels of RL activity, but upon transfection of an siRNA targeting MxA (silencing the MxA-encoding gene MX1), virus replication is restored and an increase in RL activity is observed (Supplementary Figure S2a) . The goal of the siRNA screen was to identify siRNAs that restore virus replication in the presence of MxA, so siMX1 served as the positive control and a non-targeting (NT) siRNA as the negative control. The assay was miniaturized to 384-well format and the quality was assessed by measuring the strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) 26 , which accounts for the assay window and variability. The SSMD was calculated as 9.4, confirming a high quality assay suitable for high-throughput screening (Supplementary Figure S2a ). An arrayed genome-wide siRNA library of siRNA pools (4 siRNAs per gene) targeting a total of 18119 human genes was transfected into A549-MxA cells in triplicate. 72 hours post transfection cells were infected with the H5N1-RL reporter virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 8, and 24 h later luciferase activity was determined utilizing Renilla-Glo (Promega) substrate (Fig. 1a) . The SSMD was used to validate the quality of each plate (SSMD > 3) 26 and hits were selected based on an average Z-score >2 across triplicates (Supplementary Figure S2b,c) . This resulted in the identification of 276 primary hits (Supplementary Table S1 off-target effects those hits were further validated in a secondary siRNA screen by individually transfecting the 4 siRNAs from each pool (Supplementary Figure S2b) . The SSMD was used to validate each plate and the results were analyzed using Redundant siRNA Activity (RSA) statistical analysis 27 which assigns a p-value to each gene based on the effect of its four siRNAs. Hits were selected based on a p-value < 0.05. Using these methods, we identified 41 genes, including the MxA-encoding gene MX1, whose knockdown led to a significant (p-value < 0.05) increase in virus growth in A549-MxA cells (Supplementary Table S2 ). Identification of host cell factors physically associated with MxA. In parallel with the RNAi-mediated approach of identifying host factors required for MxA activity we employed a second strategy aimed at identifying host cell factors that interact with MxA. Experimental conditions were largely maintained to allow a combined bioinformatic analysis of siRNA screening and proteomic screening data at a later step. The antiviral activity of Mx proteins is not affected by the addition of amino-terminal tags 28, 29 . Therefore A549 cells expressing amino-terminally streptavidin-tagged MxA (Strep-MxA) under control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter were generated alongside control cells expressing Strep-GFP. Strep-MxA and Strep-GFP were induced with doxycycline for 24 hours and the cells were then either infected with H5N1-RL or mock infected in triplicate. 24 hours post infection, cells were lysed and the Strep-tagged proteins precipitated by affinity purification with Strep-Tactin sepharose beads. Precipitated proteins were digested and identified by mass (Fig. 1b, Supplementary  Figure S3 ). Mass spectrometry files were searched using MAXQuant and statistical analysis performed using MSStats 30, 31 . None of the factors were virus-encoded. 15 host cell factors qualified as high-confidence hits based on enrichment with the MxA bait vs. the GFP bait during H5N1-RL infection (Log2FC > 2; p-value < 0.05 under statistical conditions to minimize false negatives or Log2FC > 2; p-value < 0.1 under statistical conditions to minimize false positives) (Supplementary Table S3 ). Bioinformatic analysis of the combined RNAi and proteomic datasets. In the genomic and proteomic screens, we identified 41 and 15 host cell factors, respectively. Although comparison of the resulting hits shows no direct overlap, using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA ® , Qiagen) we were able to identify a network of 13 host cell factors (Supplementary Table S4 ), including MxA, that are significantly enriched amongst the dataset when analyzed for representation in canonical pathways, upstream regulators and protein-protein interaction networks (p-value < 0.05, Fig. 1c ,d, Supplementary Figure S4a ). Within this network of 13 factors, 7 (including MxA) were identified in the siRNA screen and 6 in the proteomic screen. To validate the requirement of these 13 factors for MxA antiviral activity, we transfected A549-MxA cells with siRNAs targeting the respective gene (4 siRNAs per gene). Following infection with H5N1-RL, luciferase activity was measured to assess the antiviral effect. We considered a factor to be validated if at least 2 out of 4 siRNAs significantly increased virus replication by 90% (Log2FC ≥ 0.93, p-value < 0.05) compared to a non-targeting (NT) control siRNA (Supplementary Figure S4b) . Those criteria were only met by SMARCA2, ZC3HAV1 (also known as ZAP) and CASP9. As these data were generated in the presence of MxA they suggest that SMARCA2, ZC3HAV1 and CASP9 are required for efficient MxA restriction of H5N1, however, they may also have an antiviral effect independent of MxA. SMARCA2 and CASP9 have an antiviral role only in the presence of MxA. ZC3HAV1 is a restriction factor with a broad antiviral spectrum. However, its activity against IAV is only modest 32, 33 and there is no information about its relevance to MxA restriction. Similarly, for CASP9, an initiator caspase required for the apoptotic pathway, neither association with MxA nor IAV has been shown. SMARCA2 is an ATPase subunit of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex, a complex required for the induction of many genes, including interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) with anti-IAV activity 34 . To verify that SMARCA2, ZC3HAV1 and CASP9 are required for the antiviral activity of MxA, but do not act as MxA-independent restriction factors, we made use of A549 wild type cells (A549-wt) and the established cell line A549-shMxA which stably overexpresses a short hairpin RNA targeting MxA (shMxA) 16 . Due to the stable expression of shMxA even MxA induced by viral infection is expected to be immediately silenced. Upon infection with H5N1-RL or a Renilla-expressing reporter virus based on the MxA-sensitive IAV strain A/seal/Massachusetts/1/1980 10,11 (H7N7-RL), high reporter activity was observed in A549-wt and A549-shMxA cells but replication was considerably reduced in A549-MxA cells due to the presence of MxA (Supplementary Figure S5a ). siRNA knockdown of MxA (MX1), CASP9 and SMARCA2 increased reporter activity of both viruses by up to ~6-fold and at least 2-fold in A549-MxA cells (2 out of 4 siR-NAs increasing reporter activity) ( Fig. 1e and Supplementary Figure S5b ). On the other hand, in A549-shMxA and A549-wt cells such an increase was not observed upon RNAi-mediated depletion. These data suggest that MxA requires the presence of SMARCA2 and CASP9 to efficiently restrict influenza A viruses and in the absence of MxA, SMARCA2 and CASP9 do not display antiviral properties.
