Development of a novel bioinformatics pipeline to detect highconfidence SOX cleavage sites across the transcriptome following PARE Prior analyses of individual mRNAs indicated that the KSHV RNase SOX cuts at specific locations within the RNA, in a manner dependent on the sequence surrounding the cleavage site [5] . By performing 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5' RACE) on the GFP reporter mRNA, we found that the GFP mRNA was cleaved in the same location regardless of whether SOX was transiently expressed in 293T cells or expressed from the KSHV genome in lyticallyreactivated iSLK.219 cells (S1 Fig) . This is in agreement with the fact that SOX activity does not rely on any additional viral proteins, and that its cleavage activity can be studied in transfected cells [5, 7, 13] . To dissect the specificity of SOX cleavage across the mRNA transcriptome, we designed an approach to map SOX cleavage sites in endogenous mRNAs using PARE [23, 24] . PARE is an RNA-seq based methodology that allows mapping of the 5' ends of uncapped, phosphorylated RNA species, such as mRNA degradation fragments ( Fig 1A) . As we previously found that the SOX degradation intermediates are cleared by the host 5'-3' exonuclease Xrn1 [5] , we stabilized degradation intermediates in 293T cells expressing a GFP-SOX fusion [7] by knocking down Xrn1 (S2A Fig) . Cells expressing GFP alone were used as controls to filter out RNA fragments generated by cellular RNases or other processing events. This was important because multiple studies have shown that PARE and similar techniques detect a large number of RNA fragments in human cells, many of which are of unknown origin [25] [26] [27] . We prepared and sequenced PARE experimental procedure and peak finding analysis pipeline. A) Diagram of the PARE procedure. B) Schematic of PyDegradome analysis approach, which uses read counts in a control sample to generate a table of thresholds to compare test sample counts to. The table lists thresholds for a particular user-defined confidence level and for a range of ratios between control and test samples. The applicable ratio for each position is computed by multiplying a user-defined multiplicative factor by the ratio of total read counts for the exon in test vs. control samples, thus accounting for variation in RNA levels and total mapped reads. Read counts in test sample at each position must exceed the threshold to be identified as part of a peak. C) Example of plot of read counts (5' end only) for 200 nt surrounding a SOX cut site identified by PyDegradome within the 3'-most exon of the LIMD1 NM_014240 transcript in the four samples. Note that y-axis has a logarithmic scale. This example shows the expected distribution for a cut site followed by exonucleolytic degradation due PARE libraries from two replicates of SOX-expressing or GFP control cells and extracted the 5' end of each mapped read, which represents the cleavage site (S1 Table) . Conventional analysis of PARE and similar degradome datasets relies on detecting cut sites in each condition and then comparing conditions to each other a posteriori, but initial attempts at detecting and validating cut sites indicated that this approach did not provide sufficient discriminatory power to identify SOX-specific cleavage sites. In previous studies using PARE or similar approaches [26, 27] , additional information about the pathways, such as the miRNA sequences for miRNA cut site studies or the proximity of the site to a stop codon for studies of SMG6 and nonsense mediated decay, was used to further select "true" cut sites. However, such contextual information does not exist for SOX cleavage specificity. Therefore, we devised a Python-based analysis approach that would directly use our control dataset as a baseline, which we termed PyDegradome ( Fig 1B) . The analysis uses a Bayesian probability framework to determine whether the read counts at a given location differ significantly between control and test samples, taking into account random variations in the number of reads. Using Bayes' theorem, we determine for each location whether the underlying rate of fragment production in the test sample is a multiplicative factor larger than the control rate at a user-defined confidence level. The user also chooses the multiplicative factor. For a given control read count, we thus compute a threshold that the read counts in the test samples have to exceed to be considered part of a "peak" (Fig 1B) . To improve efficiency when testing thousands of locations, the software builds a reference table of the thresholds for the entire dataset. This approach allowed the identification of locations within the transcriptome where the read counts were statistically higher in the samples from SOX-expressing cells than in control samples (peaks). In order to correct for up-or down-regulation of the RNAs and for the total number of reads obtained for each sample, the ratio used to determine thresholds was computed from the user-defined multiplicative factor and the ratio of the total number of reads mapping to each exon in test vs. control samples (Fig 1B) . To prevent isolated high read counts from skewing our analysis, we integrated read counts within small windows (4 nt) rather than single nucleotides. Adjacent windows that passed the cutoff were then combined into a single peak. We optimized the userdefined confidence level and ratio by determining how many peaks were detected when comparing each SOX replicate sample to its GFP control to detect SOX-specific peaks, or performing the opposite comparison to detect GFP-specific peaks. In addition, we also ran the program to detect peaks specific to only one biological repeat, by comparing the two SOX or GFP replicates to each other, as these peaks may represent experimental noise. Although we consistently detected more SOX-specific peaks than GFP-specific peaks, varying the parameters improved discrimination of SOX-specific peaks (S2B Fig) and reduced detection of "noise" peaks specific to one repeat. Based on this optimization, we empirically set the final iteration of the program to detect 4 nt windows with read counts in the test samples that are four fold higher than read counts in the control samples within a confidence level of 99.99%. Because these parameters are conservative, we expect that the SOX cut sites we detected do not represent a comprehensive list of all SOX cut sites, but rather only the highest confidence sites. Within each peak, we also determined the position where the read count was highest, and we considered this position the location of putative cut site (with the cleavage occurring 5' of this position) (Fig 1B and  1C ). With similar optimization, this program could be used to identify the ends of degradation fragments in other degradome datasets that contain matching test and control samples. SOX cuts sites are abundant and not positioned relative to landmark features of mRNA Using the approach detailed above, we detected a higher number of peaks specific to SOX-containing samples relative to control samples, consistent with broad mRNA targeting by SOX (Fig 2A; S2 Table) . Even when varying the allowed distance between peaks from 0-15 nt in sample replicates, the SOX samples contained~3-5 times the number of reproducible ("shared") SOX-specific peaks (S2C Fig). Up to 20% of the SOX-specific peaks but fewer than 9% of the control GFP-specific peaks were shared between the replicates, indicating that many of the SOX cleavages reproducibly occur at a given site (Fig 2B) . The read counts at the putative cut site in the two SOX replicates were highly correlated ( Fig 2C, Spearman's œÅ = 0.892, p value < 0.0001), further demonstrating that these peaks correspond to specific SOX-mediated cleavages. For downstream analyses, we focused on cut sites that were detected in both the replicates using the 99.99% confidence level and were 0-5 nt apart (S3 Table) . Example plots of the read counts around identified cut sites are shown in Figs 1C and S3A-S3F. Several virally encoded host shutoff factors that trigger RNA degradation, including herpes simplex virus 1 vhs and SARS coronavirus nsp1, are thought to induce sequence-independent cuts near the 5' end of the message [20, 21] . To examine whether SOX cleavage sites in endogenous mRNAs are position-specific, we compared the location of the SOX-specific cut sites to those found only in control samples using the human transcript annotation from ENSEMBL GRch37. In both SOX and GFP control samples, more cut sites occur towards the ends of the transcripts, most frequently corresponding to the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of the mRNA (Fig 2D and 2E ). It remains unclear whether this non-specific end bias is due to a general preference for cleavage in non-translated regions or a consequence of the PARE approach. We also computed the position of the cuts relative to landmarks such as the transcript start site, start codon, stop codon or annotated 3' end. Only a fraction of the peaks was located within 50 nt of any of these landmarks in either case (Fig 2F) . Although a greater percentage of the SOX cut sites occurred within 50 nt of start codons, this still only accounted for 15% of the cut sites. Furthermore, the 15-20% of both SOX and GFP peaks near annotated transcription start sites may represent the beginning of full-length decapped mRNAs rather than endonuclease cleavage fragments. Collectively, these analyses indicate that SOX cut sites are not restricted to a particular region of the mRNA, although cleavage sites in both SOX and control GFP samples may be enriched in areas of the transcripts that are not covered by ribosomes. These findings are consistent with our previous reporter mRNA data [5] .
