Twenty-six individuals (13 patients and 13 contacts) underwent repeat respiratory sample testing until a negative test result was obtained. Table 1 shows the specimen type by category. Most samples from MERS-CoV cases were tracheal aspirate/sputum (p = 0.0006) and most samples from contacts were nose and throat swabs (p = 0.0002). The Kaplan-Meier curve showed that contacts cleared the virus at a much earlier time than patients ( Figure 1 ). On day 12, 30% of contacts and 76% of cases were still positive for MERS-CoV by PCR.
