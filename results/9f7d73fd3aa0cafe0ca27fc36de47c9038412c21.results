The stochastic SIRS dynamics are capable of exhibiting a diverse array of dynamical behaviors, determined by both the epidemic parameters b, g, d and the network short-cut parameter f. We choose the following three scenarios: Stable equilibrium: Infection levels in the population reach a stable equilibrium relatively rapidly after a short transient (Fig. 3A) . Noisy endemic state: Infection levels exhibit stochastic fluctuations around an endemic state following a long transient of decaying cycles (Fig. 3B ). Persistent cycles: Fluctuations with a well defined period and enhanced amplitude persist in the small-world region near f = 0.01 (Fig. 3B ). The reason for choosing these different temporal patterns is to test the HM model against a wider range of behaviors of the stochastic system. The oscillatory case has epidemiological significance because of the observed pervasiveness of cyclic disease patterns (Cliff and Haggett, 1984; Grenfell and Harwood, 1997; Pascual et al., 2000) . Fig. 3A presents simulation examples of the epidemic time series for three values of the short-cut parameter f, representing the regular grid (f = 0), the small-world network (f = 0.01) and the random network (f = 1). The transient pattern depends strongly on f: a high degree of local clustering in a regular grid slows the initial buildup of the epidemic, whereas in a random network with negligible clustering (Fig. 1D ) the disease grows relatively fast. The transient for the small-world network lies in between these two extremes. By contrast, the stable equilibrium level of the infection remains insensitive to f, implying that the equilibrium should be well predicted by the bilinear mean-field approximation (Eq. (4)) itself. Least-squared estimates of the two sets of heterogeneity parameters [k, p, q] and [k r = n 0 /N, p r , q r ], for the full and restricted versions of the HM model respectively, are obtained for a series of f values corresponding to different network configurations, as described in Section 3. The disease parameters b, g and d are kept fixed throughout, making the epidemic processes operate at the same rates across different networks, so that the effects of the network structure on the dynamics can be studied independently. transient patterns, however, presents a different picture. The mean-field trajectory deviates the most from the stochastic simulation for the regular grid (f = 0), and the least for the random network (f = 1). The full HM model with its three parameters k, p and q, on the other hand, demonstrates an excellent agreement with the stochastic transients for all values of f. By comparison, the transient patterns of the restricted HM model with only two fitting parameters p r and q r differ significantly for low values of f ( Fig. 4A and B) . The poor agreement of the restricted HM and the mean-field transients with the stochastic data for a clustered network (low f) is due to the failure of their respective incidence functions to fit the transmission rate of the stochastic system ( Fig. 2A) .
