Developmental expression of aand b-DG in liver tissue The availability of target receptors influences the efficiency of gene transfer in neonatal and adult tissues. We hypothesized that changes in the levels of α-DG or other viral receptors expressed in newborn versus adult liver would influence the gene transfer efficiency with LCMV pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. To test this hypothesis, we isolated WGA enriched glycoproteins from neonatal livers and compared the expression of αand β-DG by western blotting (Figure 1 ). The IIH6 antibody for α-DG recognizes the glycosylated form of α-DG that binds with high affinity to LCMV and laminin. Liver from E18 embryos and early postnatal liver showed high levels of IIH6 reactive α-DG, while in adult liver, IIH6 reactive α-DG was barely detected. In addition, β-DG levels were also high in late embryonic/ neonatal livers compared to adult animals. Interestingly, although the β-DG levels remained high in P0 and P2 embryos, the level of IIH6 reactive α-DG appeared to progressively decrease over this time window. This could either reflect a loss in the α-DG protein or a decrease in glycosylation efficiency with an overall effect of loss of functional α-DG on the cell surface.
