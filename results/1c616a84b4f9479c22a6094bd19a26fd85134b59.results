Correlations among the variables, descriptive statistics, and Cronbach's alpha coefficients are presented in Table 1 . Alpha coefficients derived from this study ranged between .60 (trust) and .96 (emotional exhaustion), most of which exceeded acceptable levels of internal consistency. As expected, emotional exhaustion was significantly and positively correlated to state anger, avoidance behavior, contact with SARS patients, and time spent in quarantine. Negative relationships were found between emotional exhaustion and vigor, organizational support, and trust in equipment/infection control initiatives. State anger was positively correlated to avoidance behavior, contact with SARS patients, and greater time in quarantine; and negatively related to vigor, organizational support, and trust in equipment/ infection control initiatives. Engaging in avoidance coping behaviors was positively correlated to time spent in quarantine and negatively related to vigor, organizational support, and trust in equipment/infection control initiatives. Importantly, avoidance behavior was only marginally correlated to contact with SARS patients (i.e., po:10). Thus, even when confronted with more contact with SARS patients and therefore, risk of infection, most nurses continued to implement disease control initiatives and kept working. Three linear multiple regression analyses were performed with the criterion measures, emotional exhaus-tion and state anger, as outcome variables, and avoidance behavior as a coping variable. Predictors were vigor, organizational support, and trust in equipment/infection control, contact with SARS patients, and time spent in quarantine. Given that three multiple regressions were performed, we adjusted our alpha level to p ¼ :017 using the Bonferroni correction to control for Type I error. Overall, the model accounted for 26% of the variance in avoidance behavior. Less time spent in quarantine predicted lower levels of avoidance behavior ðb ¼ :23; po:001Þ, whereas, higher levels of vigor ðb ¼ À:27; po:001Þ and organizational support ðb ¼ :26; po:001Þ predicted significantly less avoidance behavior (see Table 2 ). Note the variables trust and contact were not predictive of avoidance behavior. Although on their own, these variables were correlated to avoidance behavior at significant and marginally significant levels, as shown in the correlation matrix in Table 1 , the relationship between each of these variables and the criterion was washed out due to their relationships with the other predictor variables in the model. In other words, when levels of the other predictors in the model were kept constant, the efficacy of either trust or contact in predicting nurses' avoidance behavior was nullified.
