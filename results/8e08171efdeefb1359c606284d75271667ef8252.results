In a CRISPR-based RNA-guided activation system, the sgRNA targets, which are 20 nucleotides in addition to the PAM sequence (NGG), should be located within 200 base pairs of the transcription start sites of the promoter 36 , which are dispersed in the BST-2 promoter region 38 . We selected six different sgRNA targets against the BST-2 promoter (sgBST2#1-6) (Fig. 1A) . To identify the best sgRNA target sequences in the BST-2 promoter, we cloned its promoter into a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and cotransfected HeLa cells with this promoter-indicator plasmid together with plasmids expressing sgRNA appended to the phage MS2 RNA stem loop (sgRNA-MS2 loop), as well as dCas9 fused to the herpes simplex virus transcription factor VP16 minimal activation domain termed VP64 (dCas9-VP64), and the transcription factor fusion protein that is the NF-kB trans-activating subunit p65 with the activation domain from the human heat-shock factor 1 fused to the phage MS2 coat protein (MS2-p65-HSF1), and then we performed luciferase assays. The BST-2 promoter was activated by the CRISPR-dCas9 system using all six sgRNA targets, among which sgBST2#1 and #2 revealed a 30 to 40-fold activation (Fig. 1B) . We therefore selected these two sgRNA target sequences for further experiments. To examine whether these sgRNAs are indeed able to activate the endogenous expression of BST-2, we employed lentiviral vector systems for transduction. We first produced lentiviruses expressing dCas9-VP64 fusion proteins in HEK293T cells, next infected BST-2-negative HOS cells with the lentiviruses, and then selected the transduced cells with blasticidin whose resistance gene was expressed using the dCas9-VP64 vector. Next, we produced another lentivirus expressing the MS2-p65-HSF1 transcription factor fusion protein, transduced the blasticidin-selected cells with the viral vector, and selected the cells using hygromycin. Lastly, we generated a lentivirus expressing sgBST2#1 and/or sgBST2#2, and transduced the dually selected HOS cells with the viral vector and selected the cells with zeocin. By performing Western analysis, we successfully confirmed the activated expression of endogenous BST-2 protein in a polyclonal population of CRISPR-transduced HOS cells, although additive effect of two sgRNAs was not observed ( Fig. 2A) . Then, we cloned the transduced cells using limiting dilution and subjected the resultant single cell clone to real-time RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence. Real-time RT-PCR showed that endogenous expression of BST-2 mRNA was drastically activated in all single cell clones (Fig. 2B) . Cell-surface BST-2 expression analyzed by flow cytometry was robustly increased in the cloned cells (Fig. 2C) . Additionally, immunofluorescence revealed a high level of intracellular expression of BST-2 in the same cells (Fig. 2D) . We conclude that this CRISPR-based system effectively activates BST-2 expression. We next performed infection-based virus production assays. HeLa cells or CRISPR-modified HOS cells, as well as BST-2(âˆ’) control HOS cells, were infected with either Vpu-intact or deficient VSV-G-pseudotyped viruses prepared from HEK293T cells transfected with the corresponding plasmids, and viruses produced from the infected HeLa or HOS cells were subjected to HIV-1 p24 ELISA to determine the levels of virus production www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ ( Fig. 3A) . Production of not only Vpu mutant viruses but also Vpu-intact viruses were effectively inhibited in all single clone cells (Fig. 3B) . Importantly, electron microscopic analyses showed that Vpu-intact viruses were indeed accumulated at the surface of BST-2 positive HOS cells (Fig. 3C) . Finally, we transduced the CD4-positive T-cell line H9, which exhibit an intermediate level of expression of BST-2, using the lentiviral CRISPR system to enhance endogenous expression of this protein. Real-time RT PCR showed that CRISPR-transduced H9 clonal cells indeed expressed high levels of BST-2 mRNA (Fig. 4A ) without affecting cell proliferation (Fig. 4B) . We then performed viral replication assays using either wild-type HIV or Vpu-defective viruses. Consistent with the results obtained in the production assays, replication of not only the Vpu mutant but also the wild-type viruses were markedly decreased in BST-2 positive H9 cells (Fig. 4C) . We therefore conclude that enhancement of endogenous BST-2 expression leads to inhibition of HIV-1 production as well as multiple-round replication, even in the presence of the BST-2 antagonist Vpu.
