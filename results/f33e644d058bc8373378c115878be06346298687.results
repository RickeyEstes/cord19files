Docetaxel affects the number of follicles that reach the primary stage Newborn mouse ovaries were randomly allocated to one the following experimental groups: CONTROL (n ¼ 7), LOW-DOC (n ¼ 7), MID-DOC (n ¼ 8) or HIGH-DOC (n ¼ 7). Exposure of ovaries to DOC led to a specific reduction in the number of primary follicles (Fig. 1A ) without a change in the overall follicle number. The number of primary follicles was significantly reduced when ovaries were exposed to DOC in a dose-dependent fashion ( Fig. 1A -iv). The total follicles number per ovary did not vary at LOW-DOC and MID-DOC, while a marked decrease was observed at HIGH-DOC compared with the number of follicles in the CONTROL group, but this was not statistically significant (P ¼ 0.07; Fig. 1A -i). Similarly, the number of primordial and transitional follicles did not decrease significantly when exposed to DOC (Fig. 1A -ii and -iii).
