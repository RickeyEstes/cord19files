Phylogenetic analyses and comparison of S1 protein gene The published nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the S1 subunit of the eight IB vaccine strains and of 20 field strains obtained from GenBank were compared. The eight vaccine strains were widely used in China for preventing IB. Of the 20 IBV reference field strains in this study, two were from Australia (N5-90 and Vic S), one from New Zealand (A), one from Taiwan (2992/02), and the remaining 16 were all from China and represented different genotypes (Liu et al., 2006b) . When phylogenetic analysis was performed based on the entire S1 subunit of the spike gene, the 28 IBV strains were grouped into seven clusters (Fig. 1) . As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1 , viruses in cluster I, LX4-type and CK/CH/LHLJ/04V viruses, shared 75.5% and 75.7% nucleotide and amino acid similarities, respectively, with strain CK/CH/LDL/97I. Cluster II contained tl/CH/LDT3/03-type viruses and the nucleotide and amino acid homology between strains tl/ CH/LDT3/03 and CK/CH/LDL/97I was 76.2% and 73%, respectively. Six IBV vaccine strains were placed into cluster III and viruses in this cluster were all mass-type strains and they shared 76.5% and approximately 74% S1 gene nucleotide and amino acid similarities, respectively, with strain CK/CH/LDL/97I. Among the IBV strains compared, vaccine strains in cluster IV (JAAS) and VI (J9, which is an Australian associated IBV strain) had more S1 nucleotide and amino acid homology (more than 78.3% and 81.4% nucleotide and amino acid similarities, respectively) with CK/CH/LDL/97I than any other reference strain examined. IB vaccine strain Jilin in cluster V shared approximately 76% S1 gene nucleotide and amino acid similarities to that of CK/CH/LDL/97I (Table 1 ). In addition, the genetic relationships of S1 genes among vaccine strains and tl/CH/LDT3/03 and tl/CH/LHLJ/04V are summarised in Table 1 .
