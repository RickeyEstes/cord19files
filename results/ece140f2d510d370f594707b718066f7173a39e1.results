We generated recombinant E1/E3-deleted adenovirus serotype 5based vectors that encode for the human secretory signal peptide hidden Markov model (SP-HMM) followed by the codon-optimized extracellular portion of the ZIKV BeH815744 E gene fused to the T4 fibritin foldon trimerization domain (ZIKV-Efl). Moreover, the ZIKV-Efl antigen was engineered with a polyhistidine-tag and a Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease cleavage sequence to facilitate downstream purification (Fig. 1) . The replication-defective adenovirus 5, designated as Ad5.ZIKV-Efl, was generated by loxP homologous recombination as previously described (Kim et al., 2014; Hardy et al., 1997) . Recombinant ZIKV-rEfl protein was purified from the supernatant of a Ad5.ZIKV-Eflinfected HEK 293 cell line using His60 Ni Superflow Resin under native conditions and packaged as a subunit vaccine in an MNA (MNA-ZIKV-Efl). We then tested the ability of Ad5.ZIKV-Efl and MNA-ZIKV-rEfl to elicit a specific anti-ZIKV immune response in vivo. C57BL/6 mice were inoculated s.c. with 10 11 vp of Ad5.ZIKV-Efl or i.d. with 20 μg of MNA-ZIKV-rEfl, or with PBS on day 0 followed by booster immunization on day 14 with the same dose i.n. or i.d., respectively (Fig. 2a) . At 0, 2, 4, and 6 weeks post prime immunization, sera were obtained from all mice and screened for the presence of ZIKV-specific antibodies using ELISA analysis. ZIKV-specific antibodies were detected as soon as two weeks after the first immunization in the sera of mice vaccinated with Ad5.ZIKV-Efl (P = 0.0002), while mice immunized MNA-ZIKV-rEfl showed significant titers at four weeks after the booster immunization (P b 0.05) when compared with the sera of mice immunized with PBS (Fig. 2b) . Furthermore, qualitative neutralizing activity of ZIKV antibodies was tested in a PRNT 50% assay. The presence of ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies was shown in both Ad5.ZIKV-Efl and MNA-ZIKV-rEfl, although the response in the mice immunized with MNA-ZIKV-rEfl was four-to 16fold lower than the response achieved in the mice immunized with Ad5.ZIKV-Efl. As expected, no neutralizing antibody responses were observed in the control animal group (Fig. 2c) . These findings support our premise that Ad5.ZIKV-Efl-and MNA-ZIKV-rEfl-based ZIKV E antigen vaccines are able to induce neutralizing ZIKV-specific immunity. To further understand how the vaccine induced ZIKV E-specific immunity, neutralizing the ZIKV in vivo and protecting the animal from its pathogenic effects, we developed a passive protection suckling mouse model. Building upon the knowledge (Dick et al., 1952 ) that day 7-(but not day 14-) old suckling mice are susceptible to ZIKV infection via the i.p. route showing neurological signs, pups were obtained by mating immunized female with nonimmunized male mice at week 3 after booster immunization. Pups were challenged i.p. at seven days after birth with 10 5 pfu of ZIKV DAKAR41542, monitored daily for mortality, and weighed for 15 days. The mean time to disease onset (10% weight loss) was slightly earlier in the pups from PBS-immunized mice than in those from MNA-ZIKV-rEfl-immunized mice, although the difference was not significant (7.75 vs. 8.25 days, P = 0.1598) ( Table 1 ). All pups born to PBS-immunized mice showed more than a 20% body weight loss in the 10 days postinfection. However, weight loss in the MNA-ZIKV-rEfl pups was reduced and a significant difference was found from day 12 (P b 0.01; P b 0.001, day 13-day 15) after challenge when compared to the PBS pups. No weight loss was observed in the pups born to the dams immunized with Ad5.ZIKV-Efl vaccine and no significant difference was measured between the pups of Ad5.ZIKV-Efl-immunized mice and the unchallenged control pups for the entire period. The significant difference started at day 8 (P b 0.01; P b 0.001, day 9-day 15) after challenge when compared to the PBS pups. (Fig. 3a) . The survival rates of pups from two animals in each group were also monitored after challenge with ZIKV DAKAR41542. Survival rates of 100% (10/10) and 50% (3/6) were observed in the pups from Ad5.ZIKV-Efl-and MNA-ZIKV-rEfl-immunized dams, respectively, whereas a 12.5% (1/8) survival rate was seen in pups from PBS-immunized dams (Fig. 3b) . The differences between the pups from Ad5.ZIKV-Efl-and those from PBS-immunized dams and between the pups from Ad5.ZIKV-Efl-and those from MNA-ZIKV-immunized dams were statistically significant (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0136, respectively). When the pups from MNA-ZIKV-rEfl-and PBS-immunized dams were compared, no significant difference in survival rate was observed (P = 0.1493), indicating that the Ad5.ZIKV-Efl vaccine candidates were efficient in passively protecting neonatal mice against lethal ZIKV challenge. As expected, all pups of PBS-immunized dams showed neurological signs including loss of balance, paresis, and hindlimb paralysis, with 4.62 ± 1.30 of neurological score. However, five out of six pups of MNA-ZIKV-rEfl-immunized dams exhibited neurological illness (no significant difference from the percentage of PBS group; P = 0.2482), although the neurological severity score was significantly lower than that of pups from PBS-immunized mice (P b 0.05). In contrast, the pups from Ad5.ZIKV-Efl-immunized mice showed mild symptoms at one time point or no signs of neurological illness (Table 1) .
