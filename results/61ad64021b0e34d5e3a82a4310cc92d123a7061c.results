Patients and sample history. The transmission chain of MERS-CoV and the timeline of potential viral exposure, symptom onset, and date of genome collection from the patients admitted to Chungnam National University Hospital are presented in Fig. 1 . This patient pool includes a secondary infection case (patient E) who had close contact with the index case (patient A) in hospital P. Eleven cases (patients F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, and P) of the third wave of infection or generation and two cases (patients R and S) of the fourth generation are also included in this study. Two (patients F and G) of 11 tertiary cases visited hospital S, where at least 81 infections occurred, infected by patient D, while the remaining 9 tertiary cases (patients H to P) were patients or care givers at hospitals D and G where 23 cases were generated by patient E. Clinical characteristics of the patients, including incubation period, fever duration, and the presence of pneumonia, are summarized in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Among the 14 cases, 9 patients completely recovered and 5 patients expired. Fatal cases include an 82-year-old female and four patients who had comorbid diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or liver cirrhosis (Table S1) . Characterization of genomic mutations. We isolated and sequenced the whole viral genomes from respiratory secretions from the 13 patients (Fig. 1 ). Genome sequences from South Korean patients B and C that were recently reported by the Republic of Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Korean CDC) (GenBank accession number KT029139) (14) and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Chinese CDC) (GenBank accession numbers KT006149 and KT036372) (15), respectively, were also analyzed together with the new viral genomes. When we compared the viral genomes isolated from the 13 South Korean patients with all the MERS-CoV genomes available in GenBank as of 20 September 2015 (99 genomes with more than 90% coverage), 26 mutations were found only in the South Korean isolates ( Fig. 2 ; see Table S2 in the supplemental material). Fourteen of these mutations are nonsynonymous mutations that result in changes of amino acids in ORF1a, S, and ORF4b. Six mutations were observed in ORF1a, seven mutations were observed in the S protein, and there was one deletion mutation in ORF4b that causes a frameshift and fusion of ORF4b and ORF5. Four mutations (D977G and G6896S in ORF1a and I529T and V718I in S) were detected in more than one isolate. We observed no change at position R1020 of the S protein, which is the only codon predicted to be under positive selection in the viral genome (16) . It is worth noting that the D510G and I529T mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein (17) result in a change in amino acid properties: acidic aspartate (D) to hydrophobic glycine (G) and hydrophobic isoleucine (I) to polar threonine (T), respectively. Moreover, the mutations in RBD, especially I529T, emerged in patients of the second generation (patient E) and spread to the third and fourth generations of patients within a month (Fig. 1) . Structural prediction of S RBD mutations. We thus assessed whether nonsynonymous mutations in the RBD of the S protein affect interactions with the cognate human receptor, CD26, by structural analysis. Both mutations (D510G and I529T) are located on the interfacial region of the S protein (Fig. 3A) . We found that both mutations introduced energetically unfavorable interactions to the S-protein/CD26 interface. Specifically, D510 of the S protein is located on the interfacial loop and interacts directly with CD26 residues (Fig. 3B ; see Table S3 in the supplemental material). The D510G mutation disrupts the ionic interaction with R317 of CD26. Moreover, I529 is located on the backside of the S-protein/CD26 interface ( Fig. 3C ; Table S4 ). The I529T mutation introduces a polar side chain to a hydrophobic residue cluster (L506, L554, and A556) and therefore potentially affects the energetic stability of the interfacial beta sheets of RBD. Effects of RBD mutation on CD26 binding and viral entry. In order to quantify the binding affinity of the mutant RBDs (D510G and I529T) to CD26, we performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments with purified RBD proteins (Fig. 3D ). In our studies, wild-type RBD binds to CD26 with a dissociation con-stant (K d ) of 64.5 nM (K on , 1.45 ϫ 10 4 M Ϫ1 s Ϫ1 ; K off , 9.36 ϫ 10 Ϫ4 s Ϫ1 ), which is slightly lower but comparable to the 16.7 nM measured in previous studies (17) . The difference might be due to having fixed CD26 on the chip for the SPR assay, whereas RBD was fixed in the previous experiment (17) . The I529T mutant RBD binds to CD26 with a K d of 293 nM (K on , 4.03 ϫ 10 3 M Ϫ1 s Ϫ1 ; K off , 1.18 ϫ 10 Ϫ3 s Ϫ1 ), which is almost 4.5 times lower than wild-type RBD. In the case of D510G RBD, it binds to CD26 with a K d of 316 nM (K on , 5.02 ϫ 10 3 M Ϫ1 s Ϫ1 ; K off , 1.59 ϫ 10 Ϫ3 s Ϫ1 ), which is almost 4.9 times lower than wild-type RBD and as expected by structural prediction. To further confirm the reduced affinity, purified RBD mutants were analyzed for CD26 binding in 293T cells stably expressing CD26 (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material) by flow cytometry assay. As shown in Fig. 4A , mutated RBDs bind to 293T cells overexpressing CD26 with different efficacies. The D510G substitution increased the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) by twofold (EC 50 ϭ 0.24 g/ml), whereas the EC 50 of the I529T RBD mutant was almost 20 times higher (EC 50 ϭ 2.37 g/ml) than that of wild-type RBD (EC 50 ϭ 0.12 g/ml). In addition, the maxi- Table S2 mum binding of the two mutant RBDs was saturated at approximately 80% of wild-type RBD. Finally, we investigated the biological relevance of the I529T mutation in S protein by using a pseudotyped lentivirus bearing the mutant S protein (Fig. 4B) . The I529T mutation in S protein significantly lowered (~25%) the efficiency of viral entry into 293T cells overexpressing CD26 compared to that of virus bearing wild-type S protein. The basal level of viral entry in the control cells (293T-vector) was not changed, and the infectivity of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped virus was not significantly affected by the expression of CD26 in the host cells, suggesting that the reduction in viral entry by the I529T mutation is specifically dependent on its interaction with CD26.
