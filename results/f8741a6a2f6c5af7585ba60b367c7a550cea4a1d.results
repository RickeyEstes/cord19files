The 3 0 end triplets were obtained from 2137 virusspecific PCR primers registered in the VirOligo database. Overall, the average frequencies of triplets in the four base composition classes W 3 , W 2 S, WS 2 and S 3 were, respectively, 0.91, 1.50, 1.93, and 1.30%. The frequencies of the 64 triplets were not uniformly distributed ( Fig. 1 ; completely random distribution rejected by chi-square test, P!0.001). The mean and standard deviation (s.d.) of the distribution were 1.56 and 0.63%, respectively. The most popular triplet, AGG (3.27%), was 7.8 times more frequently used than the least popular triplet, TTA (0.42%). Most frequently reported triplets (frequencies greater than mean plus s.d.) were of eleven types, AGG (3.27%), TGG (2.95%), CTG (2.85%), TCC (2.76%), ACC (2.76%), CAG (2.71%), AGC (2.57%), TTC (2.48%), GTG (2.48%), CAC (2.38%), and TGC (2.34%). All but one of the eleven triplets (TTC) had two S and one W. Six of these 11 triplets were WSS sequences. However, two of eight WSS triplets, ACG (1.31%) and TCG (1.08%), were two to three times less frequently reported in the VirOligo database than other combinations of WSS. WGC was popular and in the top 11 combinations, but the proportion of WCG was less than the average. Four of the top 11 triplets were SWS triplets. All top 16 reported triplets had an S at their 3 0 ends. TTS was also frequently reported, and the two TTS triplets were among the top 14. The least frequently reported triplets (less than mean minus s.d.) were of six types, TTA (0.42%), TAA (0.61%), CGA (0.65%), ATT (0.75%), CGT (0.75%), and GGG (0.84%). Two of the lowest six types contained CGW. As mentioned above, WCG was less frequently reported compared to other combinations of WSS. Three out of the lowest six types were triplets devoid of G or C, WWW. Even the most frequently reported types in WWW combinations, AAA and AAT, were distributed less frequently than average (1.45 and 1.22%, respectively). We considered the possibility that the distribution of primer 3 0 triplet frequencies represents the distribution of triplets in the target viral genome sequences rather than any PCR-driven preference. Since the primer sequence data set contained 134 BHV-1, 237 BVDV and 121 FMV primers, these viruses were used to test whether genome compositions determined the 3 0 end triplet frequencies. Thus, triplet frequencies of the BHV-1 genome (135,382 overlapping triplets) were subtracted from frequencies of 3 0 end triplets in BHV specific primers (Fig. 2) to yield differential frequencies. The same calculation was performed for BVDV and FMV (12,274 and 7794 overlapping triplets, respectively). In this analysis, a differential frequency of zero would indicate that a primer's triplet frequency is expected from its representation in the genome sequence. Negative values indicate that those triplets were used less frequently in primers than in genome sequences, while positive values indicate more frequent use. Differential frequencies for the 10 most and least frequently used 3 0 end triplets from Fig. 1 are shown in Fig. 2 for BHV-1, BVDV and FMV, along with the differences of the triplet frequencies for all primers analyzed from the mean frequencies for those primers. Among the 30 comparisons, 22 of the 10 most frequently used 3 0 end triplets were over-represented compared to the genome sequences ( Fig. 2A) . For the 10 least frequently used 3 0 end triplets, 26 of 30 comparisons revealed under-representation (Fig. 2B ). Means of differential frequencies between top ten and least ten 3 0 end triplets were significantly different for all three viruses tested (t test, pZ0.011 for BHV; pZ0.008 for BVDV; pZ0.047 for FMV). Since the number of primer sequences for the individual viruses were only two to four times the number of possible triplets, individual differential frequency values cannot be compared statistically. Nevertheless, the difference between the means suggests that the trends in 3 0 end triplet frequencies (Fig. 1) were not due to genome compositions.
