Significant positive associations (P , .05) were obtained for the number of SARS cases in Beijing and wind velocity (r 2 5 0.617), barometric pressure (r 2 5 0.210), and temperature range (r 2 5 0.337). By comparison, relative humidity (r 2 5 20.784), temperature (r 2 5 20.718), cloudiness (r 2 5 20.569), and precipitation (r 2 5 20.379) showed negative associations. The peak spread of SARS occurred at a mean temperature of 16.9°C (95% CI, 10.7°C to 23.1°C), with a mean relative humidity of 52.2% (95% CI, 33.0% to 71.4%) and wind speed of 2.8 ms 21 (95% CI, 2.0 to 3.6 ms 21 ). These weather conditions indicate that in northern China the SARS epidemic was most likely to occur in the spring. To determine the optimal climatic conditions for the 2003 SARS epidemic in Beijing, a regression equation was derived using the most strongly correlated factors: Y 5 218:692 2 0:698X t 2 2:043X h 1 2:282X w in which Y is the estimated number of SARS cases, and X t , X h , and X w are the mean temperature, humidity, and wind velocity, respectively, on the selected day or a selected period during the SARS epidemic. The regression model was tested against rigorous case report data from the Beijing epidemic and found to fit well with the reported daily number of new SARS cases (r 2 5 0.847, mean 5 58.5, SD 5 40.4; Table 1 ). The strongest associations were identified for the mean temperature and humidity recorded 13 to 17 days before the confirmation of SARS, and the mean wind speed 9 to 13 days before a clinical diagnosis of the disease.
