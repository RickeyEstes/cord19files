We approached 1200 households but residents could not be reached at 33 (3%) locations after three visits, and in 36 (3%), the household head declined to participate. We interviewed residents from 1131 (94%) households and gathered information on a total of 5449 persons of which 2806 (52%) were female and 586 (12%) were children <5 years old (Table 1) . We found 323 persons (6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6-7%) who met the pneumonia case definition in the previous year. Almost all (87%) met the case definition with self-reported cough and difficulty breathing for at least two days; 2% reported only a physician's diagnosis of pneumonia; and 12% reported both. There were 60 cases (11%, 95% CI 9-13%) of pneumonia reported among children <5 years old, and 263 cases (6%, 95% CI 5-6%) among persons aged five years or older. Among the children <5 years old, 31 (6%, 95% CI 5-7%) met the case definition for severe pneumonia. The proportion of pneumonia cases reported by month increased from October 2005 through September 2006 (Figure 1 .) More than half of the pneumonia cases were reported from the last five months prior to the survey. There were 628 (13%, 95% CI 12-14%) persons who reported ILI in the previous month. A case of ILI was reported by 106 (19%, 95% CI 17-20%) children <5 years old and 522 (12%, 95 CI 11-13%) persons aged five years or older.
