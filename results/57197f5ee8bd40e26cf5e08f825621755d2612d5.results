Lesions and coronaviral protein expression in the gastrointestinal tract of diseased guinea fowls between 2014 and 2016. Fulminating disease (peracute enteritis) in guinea flocks continued to be reported after the initial outbreak of GfCoV infection in 2011 (6) . Between February 2014 and November 2016, duodena from 29 diseased guinea fowls were collected and analyzed for lesions and coronaviral protein expression. Histological analysis of tissues by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed lesions in all duodena, with clear infiltration of inflammatory cells in remnants of the villi (Fig. 1, black arrowheads) . For seven animals, the entire gastrointestinal tract was available for histological analysis, showing lesions across the entire length of the intestinal tract, including the colon (Fig. 1, black arrowheads) . Viral protein expression using antibodies against the M protein of avian coronaviruses was observed in all duodena and in four out of the seven lower intestinal tracts by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Fig. 1, white arrowheads) . In the colons devoid of expression of viral proteins, the infiltration of inflammatory cells was noted, suggestive of a previous exposure to a virologic agent. In contrast to what we observed, virus replication of GfCoV/2011 appeared to be restricted to the duodenum (6). Unfortunately, we were unable to confirm the lack of infection of lower gastrointestinal tract samples in the previous outbreak due to unavailability of samples. Nevertheless, we here hypothesize that genetically divergent GfCoVs might have caused phenotypic differences in guinea fowls over the years. Circulation of genetically diverse GfCoV. Gastrointestinal content collected from 20 affected animals between February 2014 and November 2016 was analyzed for the presence of gammacoronavirus genetic material by one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using pan-gammacoronavirus primers (13) . For all samples, threshold cycle (C T ) values obtained were below 35 (data not shown), confirming the presence of coronaviral RNA in all tested samples (Table 1) . Next, overlapping conventional PCRs were performed with primers based on the spike gene of the GfCoV/2011 virus (sequences available upon request). Partial S1 sequences could be obtained from 10 of 20 RT-PCR-positive samples (893 to 1,841 nucleotides [nt]; 3,624 nt in the complete S sequence) ( Table 1 ); the quality and/or quantity of the remaining 10 samples was too low to generate PCR products. Sanger sequencing of the obtained fragments confirmed the presence of GfCoV in the intestinal content of all 10 birds, confirming continuous GfCoV circulation in France. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to investigate the genetic diversity of the obtained partial S1 sequences using maximum likelihood analyses (Fig. 2) . The results showed that the 2014 -2016 sequences clearly clustered with the S1 reference gene from GfCoV/2011 (GenBank accession number HF544506) supported by a bootstrap value of 100, while they were genetically more distantly related to TCoV. Each of the GfCoV 2014 -2016 partial S1 sequences shared 85% to 88% nucleotide identity with the GfCoV/2011 S1 sequence, and between the 2014 and 2016 partial S1 sequences, the variation was 0.1 to 8.0%. Only from one sample could a full spike sequence be obtained (␥CoV/AvCoV/guinea fowl/France/14032/2014) while for the other samples the amount and/or quality of the viral RNA samples was too low for further analyses. Comparison of the S1 gene of GfCoV/2014 with that of GfCoV/2011 using the Kimura two-parameter distance model indicated that the genes had an 85% nucleotide and an 89% amino acid sequence identity. Alignment of the amino acid sequences did not indicate clear mutation hot spots (data not shown), and the huge sequence diversity with the S1 of IBV strain M41 (the only avian coronavirus for which a cryo-electron microscopy [cryo-EM] structure has been elucidated [14] ) precluded further suggestions on the implications of each of the mutations. GfCoV/2014 S1 recognizes the enteric coronavirus diLacNAc glycan receptor with higher affinity than GfCoV/2011 S1. Using the glycan array of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics, we previously determined that S1 from GfCoV/2011 specifically binds to the diLacNAc glycan receptors (Gal␤1,4GlcNAc␤1,3Gal␤1,4GlcNAc) (4). To study whether the observed changes in the spike of GfCoV/2014 resulted in differences in recognition of this glycan receptor, we recombinantly produced GfCoV/2014 S1 and GfCoV/2011 S1 and applied both proteins to diLacNAc-polyacrylic acid (PAA) conjugates in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as previously described (4). At similar protein concentrations, GfCoV/2014 S1 showed improved binding to this receptor ( Fig. 3) , indicating that the mutations in S1 did not affect the specificity but resulted in significantly higher affinity for this particular receptor. The genetic differences between GfCoV/2014 and GfCoV/2011 did not alter glycan specificity. Next, we investigated whether the mutations in S1 resulted in recognition of additional N-linked glycans. To this end, both S1 proteins were applied to a novel glycan array containing N-glycan structures with their linear counterparts, either with terminal galactose or two differently linked sialic acid moieties (F. Broszeit and R. P. de Vries, submitted for publication). Schematic representations of each of the glycans are given in Fig. 4A . The data revealed that both GfCoV S1 proteins bind to longer biantennary LacNAc structures (Fig. 4B , structures 3 and 4), including the diLacNAc structure used in the ELISA (Fig. 3) . Furthermore, both GfCoV S1 proteins bound to longer linear LacNAc repeats (Fig. 4B , structure 1), which were not included in the previous array (4). Finally, both GfCoV S1 proteins bound longer linear and biantennary LacNAc repeats with terminal alpha-2,6 sialic acid (Fig. 4B , structures 9 to 12) but not those capped with alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids (Fig. 4B , structures 5 to 8). Erythrina crista-galli lectin (ECA), Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA), and Maackia Amurensis lectin I (MAL1) were used as controls. We observed, as expected, specific binding to galactose and alpha-2,6-linked and alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid terminal glycans, respectively (Fig. 4C ). In conclusion, both GfCoV S1 proteins show specificity for the same glycans, ending with either galactose or alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids on the glycan array. However, the relative fluorescence observed for GfCoV/2014 S1 was consistently higher than that for GfCoV/2011 S1, which is suggestive of differences in their affinities for glycan receptors, as observed for diLacNAcs in the data shown in Fig. 3 . GfCoV/2014 S1 has higher affinity for glycan receptors than GfCoV/2011 S1. To allow comparison of the binding affinities of the two proteins for each glycan, we applied 5-fold serial S1 protein dilutions onto the glycan array and compared binding intensities at various scan powers. At each concentration, for all glycans shown in Fig.  4A , binding signals of GfCoV/2014 S1 (Fig. 5A) were consistently higher than those of GfCoV/2011 S1 (Fig. 5B) . Detection of linear glycan binding (glycans 1 and 9) required higher concentrations and scan powers than the detection of biantennary LacNAc structures (glycans 3 and 4 and glycans 11 and 12) for both proteins.
