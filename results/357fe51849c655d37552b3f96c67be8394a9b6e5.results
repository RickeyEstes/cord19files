The LODs for upE varied from 21.88 to 263.03 copies/reaction, and those of ORF1a varied from 6.92 to 128.82 copies/reaction (Fig. 1) . According to the probit regression analysis, the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for upE and ORF1a were found to overlap among the tested kits, with the exception of ORF1a by the PowerChek kit (Fig. 2) . The LODs for upE using both the single and multiple gene-targeting formats of the 2-step kits were 1.64 and 1.45 log copies/reaction for the PowerChek kit and 1.76 and 1.61 log copies/reaction for the DiaPlexQ kit (Fig.  2 ). The LOD for upE was 1.34 log copies/reaction for the Any-plex kit, but no CI value could be calculated because there were no positive reactions at 1.0 log copy/reaction, while all 16 replicate specimens were positive at 1.5 log copies/reaction. In contrast, although the LODs for upE and ORF1a using the LightMix kit were 2.11 log copies/reaction and 1.78 log copies/reaction, respectively, trailing of positives was observed at much lower concentrations than these LODs (Fig. 1) . The LODs for upE of three different 1-step kits, the AccuPower, Light Mix, and Ultrafast kits, were > 2.0 log copies/reaction, which was less sensitive than those of three different 2-step kits; however, this difference was not significant (Fig. 2) . The LODs for ORF1a varied less-i.e., from 1.78 to 2.11 log copies/reaction-with the exception of the PowerChek kit, which was considerably lower at 0.84 log copies/reaction (Fig. 2) . None of the kits tested in this study showed cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses. Based on validation tests including 28 specificity panel and nine clinical specimens, the clinical sensitivities of detecting upE and ORF1a were 100% (95% CI, 0.60-1.00) for all study kits. Specificity was 100% (95% CI, 0.79-1.00). The positive samples showed a wide range of Ct values, with values between 7.6 and 11.6 resulting from all kits ( Table 2 ). The Ct values of the internal control varied most with PowerChek, from 22.7-32.1, while those of DiaPlexQ, Anyplex, AccuPower, LightMix, and UltraFast all varied by < 1.0 (Table 2 ). ORF1b, tested by the DiaPlexQ kit, was detected in only five positive specimens (62.5%). The upE results of the UltraFast kit were not available for three positive specimens because one of the capillary PCR chambers holding these specimens leaked. The effect of PCR inhibition determined by testing the nine high inhibition specimens revealed that 3-5 of the six known positive specimens were found negative or invalid by each kit ( Table 3 ). The Ct values of the internal controls from all specimens were high or extended beyond the total amplification cycles, and, therefore, false negative results were eliminated owing to internal control failure, except for those of the PowerChek and AccuPower kits. With the AccuPower kit, the mean internal control Ct value for the high inhibition specimens was considerably prolonged to 30.1 ± 0.69 compared with 25.7 ± 0.31 for the sensitivity test specimens; however, there was no established cut-off point, indicating that PCR inhibition was not acceptable in the PCR reaction. On the other hand, Ct values for the sensitivity test specimens and the high inhibition specimens using the PowerChek kit were not significantly different at 25.3 ± 3.2 and 27.0 ± 3.1, respectively. The LightMix kit produced two uncertain results with known positive specimens and one uncertain result with a known negative specimen (Table 3) . There were no positive results detected by any of the kits among the four negative specimens included in the sensitivity test and high inhibition panels (Tables 2 and 3) .
