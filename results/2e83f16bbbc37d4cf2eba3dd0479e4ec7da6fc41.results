LBSapSal elicited lasting production of anti-L. infantum immunoglobulin isotypes (IgG, IgG1, and IgG2) after L. infantum experimental challenge observed in the LBSapSal group compared with the C, Sal, and LBSal groups ( Figure 1A) . Also, the LBSapSal group elicited higher levels (p < 0.05) of IgG1 at Tbc and 274, 541, and 885 dac compared with the other groups (C, Sal, and LBSal). Moreover, the LBSapSal group showed higher levels (p < 0.05) of IgG1 at 20 and 90 dac compared with C and Sal groups ( Figure 1B) . Higher levels (p < 0.05) of anti-Leishmania IgG2 were observed in the LBSapSal group at Tbc and 20, 90, 274, and 885 dac compared with other groups (C, Sal, and LBSal) ( Figure 1C ). Further analysis demonstrated that the IgG2/IgG1 ratio was lower (p < 0.05) in the LBSapSal group compared with C (Tbc and 20, 90, 435, 541, and 885 dac), Sal (Tbc and 20, 90, 435, 541, and 885 dac), and LBSal (Tbc) groups ( Figure 1D ).
