Primer design and specificity assessment of RT-LAMP for DENV1-4 The success of the RT-LAMP assay relies on the specificities of the primer sets that are used. A set of primers based on the optimal regions revealed by multiple sequence alignments (Fig. 1 ) was designed and used to evaluate the specificity of the DENV RT-LAMP assay; the primers are listed in Table 1. DENV1-4 was amplified successfully by the RT-LAMP method and its amplicons were observed as ladder-like patterns on agarose gels. The sizes of the resultant digested products were in agreement with the sizes predicted for DENV1-4 (Fig. 2) . DNA sequencing of the digested products confirmed the specificity of the amplification (data not shown). With the exception of the DENV1-4-positive RNA samples, Japanese encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus, herpes simplex virus, and Epstein-Barr virus were all used as negative controls. Each of the samples used in this study were tested ten times and the results were recorded. The DENV1-4 RT-LAMP primers showed high specificity by only amplifying their respective targets (Figs. 3, 4, 5 and 6). No cross-reactions and falsepositive or false-negative results were obtained. Similarly, the F3 and B3 primers used by RT-PCR shown high specificity (Fig. 7) .
