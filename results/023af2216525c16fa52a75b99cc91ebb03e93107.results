Overall structure of MERS-CoV RBD bound to MERS-27 Fab. We generated the RBD of the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein (residues 367-588) by baculovirus expression in insect cells ( Figure S1 ). This fragment was previously utilized as an antigen bait to isolate the human neutralizing antibodies MERS-4 and MERS-27 from a yeast-displayed single-chain variable region (scFv) fragment library 27 . Recombinant IgG MERS-27 was expressed in HEK293T cells, and the Fab was generated by endoproteinase Lys-c digestion and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography ( Figure S1 ). The MERS-CoV RBD and MERS-27 Fab were mixed in vitro to allow the formation of the complex ( Figure S1 ). The complex structure was determined by molecular replacement to a resolution of 3.20 Å (Table 1 ). In the crystallographic asymmetric unit, the RBD and Fab form two 1:1 binding complexes that are structurally similar with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 1.17 Å for all 638 Cα pairs ( Figure S2 ). The model consists of residues Val381 to Lys587 of MERS-CoV RBD, Ala1 to Arg210 (light chain) and Val2 to Lys222 (heavy chain) of MERS-27 Fab, and two N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NAG) molecules attached to Asn410 and Asn487 of RBD, respectively (Fig. 1A ). It has been previously shown that the MERS-CoV RBD comprises the core subdomain and receptor-binding subdomain (Fig. 1A) 25 . Both the heavy and light chain of MERS-27 interacts with the receptor-binding subdomain in the complex (Fig. 1A) . The RBD core subdomain comprises a five-stranded anti-parallel sheet (β 1, β 2, β 3, β 4, and β 9) in the center, with five short helices (α 1, α 2, α 3, α 4, and α 5) decorating the central β -sheet on both sides (Fig. 1B) . The fold is maintained by three disulfide bonds that connect C383 to C407, C425 to C478, and C437 to C585 in the core subdomain (Fig. 1B) . The RBD receptor-binding subdomain is a four-stranded anti-parallel sheet (β 5, β 6, β 7, and β 8) located between β 4 and β 9 of the core-subdomain (Fig. 1B) . A long loop containing a short helix (α 6) connects β 6 to β 7 in the receptor-binding subdomain (Fig. 1B) . The loop crosses the β -sheet perpendicularly on one side, and a disulfide bond between C503 and C526 further links strand β 5 to helix α 6 (Fig. 1B) . The other side of the β -sheet lacks this structural decoration, leaving a relatively flat surface in the receptor-binding subdomain, thereby facilitating interaction with human receptor DPP4. The MERS-CoV RBD structure was previously determined alone and in complex with receptor DPP4 25, 26, 31 . The RBD structure was shown to be maintained in the unbound, DPP4-bound, and MERS-27-bound states with three pairwise structural superimpositions showing RMSD for Cα atoms of 0.74, 0.90, and 1.05 Å ( Figure S3 ). Four disulfide bonds maintain the fold in the RBD structure (Fig. 1B) . The α 1-β 1 loop and the α 5 helix in the core subdomain can be seen interacting with the β -sheet and the N-terminal segment of the linking loop in the receptor-binding subdomain (Fig. 1B) . These features, especially the rigid orientation between the two subdomains, may account for the structural conservation of RBD observed in the different states ( Figure S3 ).
