Between 1 January and 30 September, 2010, there were 1110 reports submitted to Disease Watchdog, representing 1376 disease cases. Only one case of FIP, and two cases each of CDV and CHV, were reported. A total of 65 and 115 cases of FCV and FHV were reported, respectively. Tick paralysis was added to Disease WatchDog in September, and 138 cases were reported during this month. All reports contained valid data for diagnosis and postcode. During the study period, 1043 cases of CPV were reported from New South Wales (552 cases/407 reports), Queensland (223/183). Victoria (119/90), Western Australia (87/76), the Northern Territory (18/18), South Australia (10/10) and Tasmania (4/1). In New South Wales, most CPV reports (353; 87%) consisted of only one case. Reports with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9 cases were made on 18, 18, 4, 6, 3 and 5 occasions. Most of the cases were male (229; 56%). A total of 56 breeds were reported to be affected. The following 7 breeds accounted for >50% of cases: Australian Cattle Dog (60; 15%), Staffordshire Terrier (47; 12%), Jack Russell Terrier (24; 6%), Bull Terrier (22; 5%), Mastiff (20; 5%), Maltese (19; 5%) and Fox Terrier (18; 4%). The mean (95% confidence interval) and median (interquartile range) ages were 29 (24-33) and 16 (8-24) months, respectively. The minimum age of cases was 5 months. The most common methods of diagnosing CPV were the ELISA Snap (260; 64%) and clinical signs (90; 22%). Immunofluorescence and PCR were rarely used (4 and 2, respectively). Outcome was reported for 355 cases, with treatment ongoing at the time of reporting for a further 51 cases. Of those 355 cases with a final outcome reported, 79 (22%) died, 77 (22%) were euthanized, and 199 (56%) recovered. Vaccination status was reported for 323 cases, of which 87 (27%) cases were vaccinated. No significant association was found between survival status (recovered versus died or euthanized) and gender (male versus female, odds ratio (OR) 1.22; P = 0.35), method of diagnosis (clinical versus test, OR 1.19; P = 0.53) or vaccination status (unvaccinated versus vaccinated, OR 1.55; P = 0.12 and unknown versus vaccinated, OR 1.39; P = 0.34). Dogs that survived were older (34 weeks) than those that died (28 weeks), P = 0.18. The greatest number of cases of CPV were reported in the months of February and April (19% each). Half of all cases were reported between 7 March and 18 June. The data entry screen in Disease WatchDog (www.diseasewatchdog.org) is shown in Fig. 1 . Examples of the reports that can be generated and viewed on the Disease Watchdog website are shown in Fig. 2 . Reports include histograms showing the frequencies of diseases reported during a given period, and maps of the distribution of cases. An example of the spatial search capacity of Disease WatchDog is shown in Fig. 3 . CPV cases were reported from 89 postcodes. Only one case was reported from 46 postcodes; 10 or more cases were reported from the following 9 postcodes: 2400, 2770, 2810, 2793, 2794, 2340, 2560, 2830, 2390 (Fig. 4) . Only 2 of these (2560 and 2770) were in areas of substantial human population. Regardless of the size of the scanning window used (all combinations of 1, 5, 10 and 20 km and 7, 14, 21 and 28 days), the most likely cluster was identified in western Sydney, in which 2 clinics reported 36 cases of CPV on 16 February (observed Ä expected 13.4). Depending on the scanning window used, between 18 and 23 significant (P < 0.01) additional clusters were detected. At larger spatial scanning windows, fewer clusters were detected. The size of the temporal scanning window had little influence on the number of clusters detected. Clusters were detected in every month except March. The most clusters were identified in April. Twelve of these clusters were only of one day duration; the other 12 clusters lasted from 2 to 16 days (median 7 days). The clusters (Fig. 5) were distributed throughout most of the state, excluding the southeast and the far west. All but two of these clusters were located outside the metropolitan area of Sydney. Using reports of CPV in which the affected dogs had been vaccinated as cases and controls as those dogs diagnosed with CPV that reportedly had not been vaccinated, the same location in western Sydney was identified as the primary cluster, although the observed Ä expected ratio was less (3.2). In contrast, in this analysis no significant (P < 0.01) secondary clusters were detected.
