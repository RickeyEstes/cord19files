The effects of treatments with CsA or CY on antibody response to SRBC and lymphocyte proliferation response of whole blood cells to Con A in 10-day-old turkey poults prior to infection with TCV are shown in Table 2 . Turkeys treated with CY had signi®cantly lower p , 0:05 antibody response to SRBC than untreated controls in both trials. The differences in antibody response to SRBC between turkeys treated with CsA and untreated controls are not statistically signi®cant in both trials. There were considerable variations in the lymphocyte proliferation responses. Nevertheless, the lymphocyte proliferation responses of turkeys treated with CsA were signi®cantly lower p , 0:1 than that of untreated controls in both trials. The lymphocyte proliferation responses of turkeys treated with CY were signi®cantly lower p , 0:1 than that of untreated controls in trial 1 but not in trial 2. Effects of CsA-or CY-induced immunosuppression on body weight gains of turkeys experimentally infected with TCV at 10-day-old are shown in Table 3 . The body weight gains of all treated or untreated groups were signi®cantly decreased p , 0:05 after infection with TCV as compared with that of turkeys neither treated with any immunosuppressant nor infected with TCV. The body weight gain of turkeys treated with CY was signi®cantly lower p , 0:05 than that of untreated controls after experimental infection with TCV in both trials. The differences in body weight gain after experimental infection with TCV between turkeys treated with CsA and untreated controls were not statistically signi®cant in both trials. Effects of CsA-or CY-induced immunosuppression on the severity of TCV infection in the intestine of turkey poults are shown in Table 4 . At 10 h PI, the scores on IFA staining for TCV antigen were below 3.2 in all infected groups and the differences among groups treated or untreated with immunosuppressant were not signi®cant. At 3 days PI, the scores on IFA staining for TCV antigen were above 5.6 in all infected groups and the differences among groups treated or untreated with immunosuppressant were not signi®cant. At 9 (trial 1) and 14 (trial 2) days PI, turkeys treated with CY had signi®cantly higher p , 0:05 scores on IFA staining for TCV antigen than untreated turkeys and the differences of scores between turkeys treated with CsA and untreated controls were not statistically signi®cant. Non-infected control turkeys remained negative for TCV antigen in intestines by IFA throughout the entire experimental period.
