A total of 1437 of the 1441 students provided written informed consent and were randomly assigned to a test group (Fig 1) . Among these students, 16 children reported a history of alcohol hand gel allergy. These children remained in their classrooms but did not use alcohol hand gel. No students were lost to follow-up or discontinued the intervention during the study period. Baseline characteristics of all participants after randomization were similar across the intervention groups (Table 2 ). More than half of the children were aged <4 years, and most had been breast-fed and adequately immunized. The number of days missed because of ILI ranged from 0 to 13 days per illness episode. Children who missed more than 1 day accounted for one-fourth of all absences (Fig 2) . Compared with the control group, the intervention groups also had fewer doctor visits during the study period (Fig 3) . The rates of absenteeism due to confirmed ILI (sick days/present days) were 0.017 in the q 60 group, 0.025 in the q 120 group, and 0.026 in q lunch group. The absenteeism rate due to confirmed ILI was significantly higher in the control group compared with the q 60 group (rate difference, 0.0096; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.004-0.016; P ¼ .002) and also in the q 120 group compared with the q 60 group (rate difference, 0.009; 95% CI, 0.002-0.015; P ¼ .008). No significant difference was found between the q 120 group and the control group (rate difference, 0.001; 95% CI, 0.005-0.007; P ¼ 0.743). The rates of absenteeism from ILI both with and without a doctor's confirmation were 0.069 in the q 60 group, 0.065 in the q 120 group, and 0.070 in q lunch groups. No significant effect was found across rates. On multivariate analysis, only intervention group and patient age were found to be significant risk factors for ILI (P ¼ .012 and .000, respectively). No significant effect was detected for other variables, including sex, breast-feeding history, presence of underlying disease, immunization history, frequency of visits to public places (eg, malls), and presence of a smoker in the household.
