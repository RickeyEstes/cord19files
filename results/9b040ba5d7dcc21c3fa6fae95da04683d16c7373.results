A total of 192 NPAs, 160 (83.3%) from pediatric and 32 (16.7%) from adult patients, were analyzed. Pediatric individuals were aged between 0 and 13 years old (mean ± SD = 2 ± 2; median = 1). Patients over 14 years old were aged between 15 and 86 years old (mean ± SD = 49 ± 18; median = 44). S. pneumoniae was detected by mariPOC in 62% and 15.6% of samples from children and adults, respectively. At least 1 respiratory virus was detected in 67% and 66.7% of the S. pneumoniae-positive and S. pneumoniae-negative samples, respectively. The mariPOC manufacturer does not recommend reporting this result in patients younger than 7 years in whom a high percentage of colonization by this microorganism could be expected. In our study, 83.3% of the samples were from pediatric patients, most of them younger than 3 years old. Thus, S. pneumoniae was not included in data analysis. The prospective study was carried out in 108 (56.25%) fresh samples from 87 (80.6%) children and 21 (19.4%) adults. The retrospective study included 84 (43.75%) NPAs from 73 (86.9%) children and 11 (13.1%) adults. Overall, 122 viruses from 115 samples were detected by mariPOC. Two viruses were detected in 7 samples. From the remaining 77 (40.1%) mariPOC-negative specimens, NAATs yielded 59 (76.6%) negative results to viruses included in mariPOC from which 42 were negative and 17 were positive to other viruses not included in the mariPOC panel (RhV/EV, CoV, and BoV). Luminex and Simplexa were carried out in a subset of 74 and 118 samples, respectively. The results from both methods were considered together as NAATs results for comparison with mariPOC. Overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of mariPOC were 85.4%, 99.2%, 95.9%, and 97%, respectively (Table 1) . The mariPOC assay failed to detect 20 viruses: Flu A (n = 2), Flu B (n = 5), RSV (n = 7), ADV (n = 1), hMPV (n = 2), and PIV 1-3 (n = 3). Indeed, false-positive results (ADV [n = 1], PIV 1 [n = 3], and RSV [n = 1]) were detected by mariPOC in 5 samples. In 3 of these samples, 2 viruses were codetected by mariPOC. and only 1 of the 2 viruses was identified by the reference method (Flu B [n = 2], PIV 3 [n = 1]). No false-positive results were reported preliminarily, and 99 out of the 117 (84.6%) true-positive results were available in 20 min. Codetections of 2 viruses (of those included in the mariPOC panel) was observed in 6 samples by reference methods. In 2 of these samples, the mariPOC panel detected only 1 of the 2 viruses. The lowest sensitivity of mariPOC was obtained for hMPV, ADV, and PIV 1-3. RDTs for Flu and RSV were performed on 122 and 131 samples, respectively (Table 2) . Discordant results between mariPOC and RDTs were resolved by NAATs that showed 6 and 4 false-negative results with mariPOC and RDTs, respectively. The mariPOC assay failed in detecting 2 Flu A and 4 RSV, whereas RDTs did not detect 3 Flu B and 1 RSV. Excellent agreements of mariPOC were obtained when compared with RDTs (k index: 0.924 [95% CI: 0.88-0.968]) and NAATs (k index: 0.885 [95% CI: 0.84-0.929]). The lowest LoD of mariPOC was obtained for hMPV, followed by ADV and PIV-1, Flu B and RSV, and Flu A and PIV-3, which yielded the highest LoD as assessed by TCID 50 (Table 3) .
