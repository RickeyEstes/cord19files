To estimate the efficiency of the enrichment procedures and the different library building techniques used for HTS, we created seven different samples consisting of human PBMCs spiked with different viruses. To mimic some of the viral diversity, the sample material contained viral genomes integrated into the human genome, intact non-enveloped virions from both DNA and RNA viruses, a DNA plasmid carrying a viral genome and aRNA particles containing a small RNA fragment originating from an enterovirus. The concentration of each virus was determined by qPCR (Table 1) . Shotgun sequencing is a simple and useful technique, but often a very expensive method when searching for low titres of viruses, as viral nucleic acids often only constitute a minute fraction compared to the host genetic material. To determine the sensitivity of DNA shotgun sequencing for viral detection, DNA shotgun libraries were prepared for all seven samples, and the individually indexed libraries were sequenced on separate lanes, producing between 143 and 191 million reads per sample (average 174 million reads). Deep sequencing was performed to ensure that viral reads were obtained from the samples containing even the lowest concentrations of viruses, making it possible to assess the level of enrichment at all concentrations. Considering the total number of produced sequencing reads, viral genome size and quantity, the expected proportion of viral reads was calculated for the individual viruses in all samples. Table 3 lists the expected and the observed proportion of reads in each sample based on the total DNA/RNA extractions. For DNA shotgun sequencing there was generally good agreement between the observed and the expected proportion of reads. All DNA targets were detected in samples in which the expected quantity was >0, except for one of the samples with the lowest concentration of MeV plasmid (7 copies/μl). The two samples with the highest concentrations of HAdV (2,500 and 250 copies/μl, respectively), yielded sufficient reads to completely cover the HAdV reference genome. For the lower concentrations, the genome was only partially covered. Rarefaction analysis was employed for analysing species richness by assessing the number of new sequences found in a set interval of sequences. Results showed that the coverage approached saturation in the rarefaction analysis, hence deeper sequencing would predictably result in little additional unique viral reads (Fig 2A) . HPV-18 genomes were present in the form of HeLa cells containing 10-50 HPV-18 copies/ cell of integrated HPV-18 genome [29, 30] . The two samples with the highest concentration of HeLa cells (4,000 and 400 cells/μl) resulted in >95% coverage of the integrated HPV-18 sequence ( Fig 2B) . The samples with lower concentrations showed that the coverage approached saturation at levels between 5% and 40% of the genome, and deeper sequencing was thus unlikely to result in additional viral reads. Only in the three samples with the highest concentration of HIV-1 proviral DNA (4,000, 400 and 40 copies/μl) we observed HIV-1 specific reads (Table 3) , and the coverage of the HIV-1 genome was saturated only for the most concentrated sample (Fig 2C) . The genome sizes for HIV-1 and HPV-18 are of comparable length, but with fewer copies of HIV-1 than HPV-18 present per cell in the sample material it was expected to find a proportionally lower number of sequences for the proviral HIV-1. The coverage of the MeV-plasmid reached saturation at only 26% and 8% for the two samples with the highest concentration (700 copies/μl for both samples). For samples containing 70 or 7 copies/μl (samples 3 to 5), the coverage remained constant around 1% whereas for sample 6, having the same concentration as sample 5 (7 copies/μl), no MeV-plasmid reads were detected ( Fig 2D) . For the shotgun DNA libraries, the samples were sequenced on individual lanes. Four indexes were used per sample in order to gain a higher complexity on the lane. For all other library types we used one index per sample, and the samples were sequenced in pools of three to seven samples per lane. In datasets from libraries sharing lanes, rare false positive reads were detected mapping to EV, HPV-18, HIV-1 or HAdV at frequencies ranging from 5×10 -5 to 5×10 -7 (see further discussion below). The libraries producing false positive reads were tested by specific qPCRs, and were in all cases found qPCR-negative. RNA shotgun libraries were sequenced with three or four samples per lane, producing between 32 and 70 million reads per sample (53 millions on average). As the host RNA was not quantifiable, the proportion of expected viral reads could not be predicted. Under the assumption that the amount of total RNA was equal for all samples, the expected proportion of viral reads was instead calculated relative to the observed number of viral reads for the sample with the highest concentration of the given virus and normalised to the total number of reads. Table 4 lists the expected and the observed proportion of reads for each virus for each sample. In most cases the observed proportion of viral reads exceeded the predicted proportion. As for the DNA shotgun sequencing, all viral targets could be detected when the sequencing depth and virus concentrations yielded a prediction of more than zero reads. However, we found a small fraction of reads mapping to HIV-1 or HPV-18, in our virus-negative controls, indicating misinterpretation of reads during parallel sequencing of multiple samples (see discussion below). HIV-1 reads exceeded the level of contaminating reads from the HIV-1 negative sample for samples containing 4 copies/μl. Similarly for HPV-18, RNA exceeded the background signal for concentrations 40 copies/μl. Coverage of the EV, aRNA, HPV-18, and HIV-1 RNA genomes was investigated. The sample with the highest concentration of EV (12,500 copies/μl) yielded sufficient reads to completely cover the EV reference genome. For the remaining samples the genome was partially covered. Results showed that the coverage approached saturation for all samples, and deeper sequencing was unlikely to result in additional unique viral reads at any of the concentrations (Fig 3) . The aRNA particles, containing a short RNA molecule, were added in equal concentrations to all samples to monitor inter-sample variation but could not be detected in any of the samples. Expression of viral RNA was expected in the HPV-18 and HIV-1 material. RNA shotgun sequencing yielded coverage of the HPV-18 genome similar to DNA shotgun sequencing despite that five times less sample material was used. In contrast, all HIV-1-positive fractions used for RNA shotgun sequencing showed a higher coverage of the HIV-1 genome than was the case for DNA shotgun sequencing. For RNA shotgun sequencing the lowest concentrations yielded a coverage that approached saturation at >60%, compared to less than 5% for the DNA shotgun sequencing. These results indicate that, if replicating, integrated DNA viruses or proviral retrovirus may be detected more sensitively by RNA sequencing. We compared the sensitivity of shotgun sequencing to that of specific qPCR assays. In general, a higher input amount was required for detection by shotgun sequencing than by qPCR detection. However, in some cases a few viral reads were detected for concentrations below the detection limit of qPCR (e.g. HPV-18). Altogether the results from shotgun sequencing suggest that there may be important differences in obtained results, influenced by the type, size and location of the viral target. As the viral nucleic acids make up only a small proportion of the total nucleic acids in most biological samples, we conducted virion enrichment on the test samples. To evaluate the effectiveness of such methods, selective removal of host genetic material by filtration and nuclease treatment was followed by extraction of DNA and RNA from remaining intact virions. To estimate the depletion of host nucleic acids fluorometric quantification of the DNA concentration was performed for the extractions. For the DNA extracts from samples not exposed to enrichment, the DNA concentration ranged from 4.3 to 10.5 ng/μl, whereas the DNA concentration of the extracts from the samples subjected to enrichment was below 10 pg/μl. The substantially decreased DNA concentration indicates that depletion of non-virion associated genetic material was efficient. The enrichment process targeted primarily HAdV and EV virions. However, libraries prepared from extracts of the virion-enriched samples were investigated for all the viral targets. DNA sequencing produced between 19 and 41 million reads per sample (31 million reads in average) ( Table 5 ). The proportion of HAdV reads was increased for all enriched samples compared to shotgun sequencing. The virion enrichment procedure typically resulted in a 900-fold increase in the proportion of viral reads (Fig 4) . For the two samples with the lowest concentration, the increase was 10,480 or 925 fold. For the sample with the highest concentration an increase of only a 161-fold was observed, suggesting that virion enrichment may be more effective at low concentrations. For all DNA virion-enriched samples the coverage of the HAdV genome approached 100%, which was only the case for the two most concentrated samples when using DNA shotgun sequencing. Furthermore, the total amount of reads required to reach full genome coverage was lower. The increase in observed coverage was best illustrated by comparing the number of reads required to reach 50% coverage of the genome (Table 6) . Even for the lowest concentrations of 2.5 copies/μl as little as 1.3 and 2.3 million reads resulted in 50% coverage of the 36 kb genome, suggesting that an even lower concentration of HAdV could have been detected by virion enrichment. As expected, the ratio of human reads decreased in enriched libraries (28% on average) compared to shotgun libraries (88% on average). Furthermore, the number of reads and genome coverage was drastically reduced for HIV-1 and HPV-18 DNA in libraries from virionenriched fractions. Likewise generally only a few MeV plasmid reads were obtained in these datasets. This was the case for all samples except for sample 1, which had an input of 700 copies/μl, and yielded a higher proportion of MeV plasmid reads for enriched DNA libraries compared to DNA shotgun libraries, something we currently cant explain. Libraries prepared from the virion-enriched RNA yielded between 14.5 and 44.6 million reads (26.3 million on average). EV was the only virus for which enrichment could be expected after this treatment, and to some extent HIV-1, as the 8E5 cell line is capable of producing immature viral particles. Again, the proportion of EV viral reads was increased for the enriched samples compared to the shotgun samples. A 2 to 13 fold enrichment was observed in the proportion of EV sequences between shotgun and virion-enriched RNA libraries. The fold change fluctuated and no clear trend was observed between the different viral concentrations. (Table 5 , Fig 4B) . As for the DNA virion enrichment, an increase in genome coverage was observed by RNA virion enrichment. At a concentration of 125 copies/μl between 0.9 and 3 million reads were required to reach a coverage of 50% of the genome ( Table 6 ). As for the DNA libraries, the ratio of HPV-18 reads was lower for virion-enriched samples than for shotgun samples. Furthermore the amount of human reads decreased from an average of 92% in shotgun libraries to an average of 69% in virion-enriched libraries. The aRNA could not be detected in the samples from either shotgun RNA or virion enriched RNA libraries. We have confirmed that shotgun sequencing produces the expected number of reads for low concentrations of virus, but that the type of virus may affect the detection limit, which is important for virus discovery. Our results show that virion enrichment may provide approximately one or three orders of magnitude for varying dilutions of viral target RNA or DNA, respectively. Importantly, our results were inconclusive with regards to detection level, supporting neither enrichment nor shotgun as the most sensitive approach. The enrichment procedure offers a more cost-effective sequencing, which also requires more handling of the individual sample.
