Most participants were nurses (6/8) and most were women (7/ 8). One participant in each PPE ensemble arm had evidence of contamination under black light examination (Figs. 3 and 4) . The participant contaminated in the standard arm felt the exposure occurred because of a splash under her hood during HVE. The trainer felt she may have inadvertently touched a contaminated portion of her leggings and subsequently touched her neck during PPE removal. The participant contaminated in the alternate group likely had a gap appear between her front and back gowns while placing a blood pressure cuff. This event was not noted at occurrence, but was noticed under black light examination.
