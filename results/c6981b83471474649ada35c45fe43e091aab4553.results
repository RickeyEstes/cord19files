AUC values are calculated for EWS using snapshots data (Fig 4) and case reports data (Figs 5 and 6). When calculated from snapshots data (the data type used in theoretical predictions), most EWS easily identify emergence (|AUC − 0.5| % 0.5), with only small variation in performance with infectious period. The coefficient of variation, skewness and kurtosis are the exceptions. If the data are monthly snapshots (Fig 4, left column) they perform poorly (|AUC − 0.5| close to 0). If the data are weekly snapshots, then the skewness and kurtosis still perform poorly, however the coefficient of variation performs well. This improvement is particularly pronounced if the mean infectious period is 1 month (Fig 4, top right) . Fig 5 shows AUC values for each EWS when calculated using case report data. Each pixel in the heat maps corresponds to a distinct EWS and parameter combination. Based on the relationship between AUC value and reporting process parameters, we identify four groups of EWS. Additional figures (S1- S4 Figs) show results for variations in experimental design. Qualitative findings were found to be robust to changes in: bandwidth b, initial R 0 and emergence
