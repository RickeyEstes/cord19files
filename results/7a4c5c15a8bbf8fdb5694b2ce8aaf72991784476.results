The first model treating index cases as the unit of analysis (Approach B in Table 2 ) yields an estimate of SCCR of 0.316 indicating less than one third the number of secondary cases for quarantined versus non-quarantined index cases. Approach C provides the estimated SCCD obtained using an additive Poisson regression model (Poisson error term and identity link function). The average difference in secondary SARS cases in moving from non-quarantine to quarantine status is estimated at 0.133 secondary cases per index case. The final estimate in Table  2 is NNQ suggesting 7.51 SARS index cases be placed under quarantine to reduce the number of secondary cases by one. When variance estimates and confidence intervals are estimated using a large-sample assumption (asymptotic variance) all Poisson regression models presented were statistically significant. When negative binomial regression was used to estimate SCCR, this became non-significant (p = 0.057). When using bootstrap variance methods, confidence intervals for all estimates became very wide and none of these estimates were significantly different from the null value. Table 3 presents supplemental analyses of the degree to which the effect of quarantine is explained by reduction in the number of contacts. Adjustment of the effect of quarantine only for the total number of contacts had little impact on the point estimate for SCCR (0.35245 versus 0.31598; data not shown), nor its significance (when compared to Table 2 ). However, when quarantine status was also adjusted (see Table 3 ) for the number of close contacts (level 1; see Table 1 ), the SCCR attributable to quarantine was reduced by 3.6% and it's asymptotic level of significance went from p = 0.026 to p = 0.046. This change falls just short of satisfying criteria for significant mediation using the Baron and Kenny method [31] . A bootstrapped test for reduction of effect [29] was not significant (p > 0.999). The adjusted models in Table 3 also show that the number of close contacts was a significant predictor of the number of secondary cases, even when adjusting for total number of contacts. This remained statistically significant even in the bootstrapped model. Finally, the SCCD and NNQ estimates ( Table 2) were rerun including 140 additional quarantined false-positive SARS cases with no secondary cases. In this analysis, the NNQ estimate drops from 7.51 to 5.74, giving the appearance of a still greater benefit (data not shown; again, statistically significant under the large sample assumption, and not when using bootstrap methods). For all Poisson-based analyses, model diagnostics did not indicate significant over-dispersion (p-value > 0.99 in all † Also considered, in sensitivity analyses only, were an additional 140 individuals who were potential SARS cases at some point during the outbreak and had at least one community contact, but subsequently did not meet criteria for probable or suspect SARS. ‡ Includes 8,498 community contacts with contact to one SARS case and not a second SARS case within 10 days of exposure to the first within any single 10 day period of exposure. § Level of contact: 1 = contact for at least 30 minutes within 1 metre; 2A = same room for ≥ 30 minutes; 2B = same room for <30 minutes or same floor, regardless of duration; level 3 = distant contact only -was in same building or large social network. cases). Using negative binomial models to account for over-dispersion did not affect point estimates, but resulted in slightly wider asymptotic confidence limits ( Table 2 ).
