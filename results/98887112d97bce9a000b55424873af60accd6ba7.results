103 eligible patients had available paired nasopharyngeal aspirate and pulmonary samples and were included in the study. Eighty-one patients were hospitalised for CAP and 22 for exacerbation of COPD. The primary clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1 . Pulmonary samples consisted of 37 induced sputum, 59 endotracheal aspirates, and seven BALs analysed together and grouped under the denomination LRT for "lower respiratory tract samples". The median time between NPA and LRT sample collection was 0.5 days (range, 0-3 days where 0 indicates that the two samples were collected on the same day). We obtained concordant results for 81 (79%) of the 103 pairs of samples, consisting of 42 positive and 39 negative results ( Table 2 ). The results differed for 22 paired samples. Discordance is defined by the identification of a given respiratory pathogen in one paired sample, but not the other. In the presence of a co-infection with two pathogens, discordance indicates that one of the two pathogens, or even both, was (were) not identified in one of the two samples. In 14 of the 22 discordant results, more pathogens were evidenced in the LRT samples (Table A1) . We identified at least one respiratory pathogen in 64 of the 103 patients (62.1%): 50 single infections and 14 dual infections for a total of 78 pathogens. There was no difference in the prevalence of respiratory pathogens between patients with an underlying chronic respiratory disease and those without. We detected no Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, or parainfluenza virus 2 or 4 among the 18 viruses and 4 bacteria investigated by the assay. Among the NPAs, 57 (55.3%) were positive: 50 for one pathogen, and 7 for two. Among the LRT samples, 59 (57.2%) were positive: 49 for one pathogen and 10 for two. We identified 55 of the 78 detected pathogens (70.5%) in both types of samples, nine (11.5%) only in NPAs, and 14 (18%) only in LRT samples, corresponding to the 22 discordant paired samples ( Table 3 ). The percentage of positive samples in NPAs and LRT were comparable: 82% and 88.5%, respectively (p = 0.36). We identified metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus in both NPAs and LRT samples for all positive cases. Three of six (50%) parainfluenza virus infections and three of five (60%) bocavirus type 1 were only positive in NPAs. In contrast, two of 29 influenza virus infections were detected only in LRT samples. There were no significant differences between detection rates of NPAs and LRT samples for any respiratory viruses. In contrast, we detected only one of the six Legionella pneumophila infections of our study in NPAs (16%), whereas they were all detected in LRT samples. No of samples (%) instance, there are no specific recommendations pertaining to the type of samples to be used with such assays, although it appears that upper and lower respiratory tract samples perform differently for some pathogens. In the same way that we have highlighted the superiority of pulmonary samples for the detection of L. pneumophila, comparable studies are needed to define the optimal sample and the detection limits for each respiratory pathogen of interest in LRTI. This should help to refine existing panels of respiratory pathogens, based on the type of patients and samples, and improve etiologic diagnosis.
