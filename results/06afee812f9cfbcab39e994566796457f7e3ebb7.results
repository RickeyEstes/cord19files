All birds exhibited typical signs of infectious bronchitis. From day 3 onwards, the birds had ruffled feathers and were depressed. These signs were most severe between days 7 to 10 and some birds passed very fluid droppings. At day 8, the kidneys were swollen and pale, and urates were observed in the ureters. The disease produced was "mild" in character (Siller and Cumming, 1974) and no natural deaths occurred. Examination by light microscopy revealed a predominantly mononuclear inflammatory response. Quantitative morphological data for cellular components at the low magnification are given in Tables 1 to 3. Volume densities of the nucleus, microvillus and extracellular space relative to the total cell volume are given in Table 1 . Compared with the normal "control" group, the nucleus volume density tended to be reduced but this was not significant. The microvillus volume density was reduced at days 4, 8 and 12 and showed a linear regression; the extracellular space volume density was reduced at days 4 and 8 and returned to normal at day 12 with a quadratic regression. The values calculated for the absolute volume of these structures, shown in Table 2 , followed this same pattern. The reduction of microvillus volume was due to shortening and focal loss of microvilli. Estimators of cell and nucleus shapes are listed in Table 3 . There was an increase in cell formfactor at day 4 and an increase in cell maximal diameter at day 8, indicating that initially the cells became rounder and then decreased in size and became more elongated, returning to normal dimensions at day 12. The nuclear diameter remained relatively constant but there was an increase in formfactor at day 8. This rounding-up of the nucleus occurred later than similar changes in the cell. The surface density or surface area per unit volume of membrane structures is presented in Table 4 . There was a marked reduction in apical tubular membrane at day 4. This returned to normal at day 8, giving a significant quadratic regression against the shorter time interval. The relative density of microvillus membrane remained constant but the surface density per cell was reduced as the microvillus volume density decreased. Similarly, the slight increase in relative density of the basolateral membrane was overshadowed by a decrease in extracellular space, so that there was an overall decrease in the absolute surface areas of transport membranes per cell. Table 5 lists the volume densities of cytoplasmic components. After an initial reduction, there was an increase in apical vacuoles at day 8 and a progressive increase in lysosomes in the apical cytoplasm over the course of the experiment. However, these values were not significant in the statistical tests applied due to large variations between animals. A large increase in lipid droplets was observed in the base of the cells at day 4 but they were normal by day 8. There was a marked change in the distribution and shape of mitochondria. In the apical cytoplasm, there was an increase of mitochondria volume density at day 4, a decrease at day 8 and normal values at day 12. In the base of the cell, there was a decrease in mitochondria volume density which was most severe at day 8. These changes in volume density reflect changes in size and shape of individual mitochondrial profiles observed (Table 6 ). In the apical cytoplasm, with increase in volume density at day 4, the mitochondria had larger profiles which were longer and had more distorted or less rounded shapes. The subsequent decrease in volume density was accompanied by shorter, more rounded and smaller profiles towards day 12. In the basal cytoplasm, the decrease in volume density was mirrored by a decrease in size of individual profiles. The mitochondria became shorter and rounder towards day 12. The measurements related to shape were the same for apical and basal profiles at day 12. The inner mitochondrial membrane plus the cristal membrane had constant surface density per unit volume of mitochondria, but since there was a decrease in mitochondrial volume density there was a related decrease in mitochondrial membrane per cell. Figure 1 shows a typical epithelial cell from a normal chicken taken at low magnification. At day 4 (Fig. 2) , the cells tended to be more rounded. There was a decrease in apical tubular membrane and an increase in apical mitochondrial volume density. Lipid droplets were prominent at the base of the cell. Virus particles could be found in cells at day 4 (Fig. 3) . They were enclosed within irregular spaces adjacent to the nucleus by a membrane from which virus particles were budding. Figure 4 shows an epithelial cell at day 8 with focal loss of microvilli. There was also a reduction in apical mitochondria. At day 12 (Figs 7 and 8 ), mitochondria were dark and cristae were dilated. Figure 7 shows a cell with marked loss of microvilli. Vesicular spaces were prominent between cells (Fig,  8) . These spaces or "holes" in the cells were obvious in scanning electron micrographs (Figs 9 and IO) . Cytoplasmic inclusions into nuclei were observed at days 4,8 and 12 (Fig. 5) . Figure 6 shows a leucocyte migrating through the basement membrane and between two epithelial cells. This was common at days 8 and 12. Figures 11 and  12 show the basal part of the cell at the high magnification from a normal chicken and from a chicken at 12 days after infection, respectively. At 12 days, the mitochondria were smaller and more rounded, the mitochondrial matrix was condensed and the cristae were dilated. The endoplasmic reticulum was dilated.
