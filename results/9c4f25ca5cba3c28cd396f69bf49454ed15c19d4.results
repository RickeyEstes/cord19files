Lb pro Substrate Specificity and Cleavage. We used ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like model substrates (17) to characterize Lb pro DUB activity in vitro (Fig. S1A ) and surprisingly found that while the enzyme lacked robust DUB activity, it targeted ISG15 with high activity and specificity (Fig. 1A) . Ubiquitin cleavage required 1,000fold higher enzyme concentration (Fig. S1B ). Kinetic analysis revealed deISGylase activity comparable with previously studied viral (18, 19) and human enzymes (20) (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1C ). However, a number of standard measurements for deISGylation activity were negative. ISG15-derived suicide probes that covalently modify ISG15-reactive Cys proteases (21, 22) were unable to modify Lb pro ( Fig. 1C and Fig. S1D ). Hydrolysis of ISG15 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) by deISGylases, such as the viral ovarian tumor (vOTU) domain of CCHFV, leads to fluorescence, yet Lb pro did not generate a fluorescent signal in this assay ( Fig. S1 E and F) . In contrast, slightly extended precursor forms of full-length proISG15 (amino acids 1-165; featuring an additional eight residues at the C terminus) or proISG15 CTD (amino acids 79-165) were rapidly hydrolyzed by Lb pro (Fig. 1D) . Strikingly, mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of Lb pro -treated mature ISG15 CTD (amino acids 79-157) revealed a truncated ISG15 molecule; Lb pro had cleaved ISG15 between Arg155 and the C-terminal Gly156-Gly157 sequence ( Fig. 1 E and F) . This surprising result was corroborated in additional experiments. We compared the cleavage rates of pro-, mature-, and substrate-bound forms of ISG15 by intact MS analysis, revealing similar activity of Lb pro against pro-and mature ISG15 and slightly higher activity toward ISG15 linked to 5-tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)-labeled Lys-Gly dipeptide via an isopeptide bond (Fig. S1G ). This showed that Lb pro can process all forms of ISG15 present in cells. The cleavage site of Lb pro contrasts all known deISGylases, which cleave ISG15 from substrates, such that both proteins are recycled to the same state as they were before modification (18, 19) . In hindsight, these findings explain the inability of Lb pro to react with the ISG15 suicide probe (in which the reactive warhead would extend beyond the active site) or generate a signal in the ISG15-AMC assay. AMC only fluoresces in the unmodified form, whereas Lb pro cleavage produces a nonfluorescent GlyGlymodified AMC reagent ( Fig. S2A ). At higher enzyme concentrations, ubiquitin and NEDD8 were also cleaved at an identical site between Arg74 and the C-terminal GlyGly motif, whereas SUMO1 was not cleaved ( Lys residue and renders the ubiquitin/ubiquitin-like protein incompetent toward additional rounds of conjugation. Structure of Lb pro Bound to ISG15. To decipher the mechanism of this unprecedented activity, we designed an ISG15 suicide probe specific for Lb pro . As mentioned, the WT ISG15 suicide probe modified several viral proteases but was too long to modify Lb pro (Fig. S2E ). Removing the GlyGly motif from ISG15 CTD and replacing Arg155 with a Gly-like C-terminal propargyl warhead ( Fig. 2A ) generated an ISG15 CTD -ΔC probe that efficiently modified Lb pro (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2E ). This enabled purification, crystallization, and structure determination of a covalent Lb pro ∼ISG15 CTD -ΔC complex at 1.5-Å resolution (Fig. 2 C and D, Fig. S3 , and Table S1 ). As anticipated, the ISG15 CTD -ΔC probe had covalently modified the catalytic Cys51 of Lb pro (Fig. S3) . Individually, the Lb pro protease and ISG15 domains were similar to previously determined structures (18, 23) (Cα rmsds of 0.609 and 0.274 Å, respectively). The structure revealed how proteolytic cleavage of ISG15 is achieved ( Fig. 2E and Fig. S3 ). Key interactions are formed via the ISG15 C terminus and also, via a hydrophobic surface centered on ISG15 Trp123 (Fig. S3) . The positively charged residues of the ISG15 C terminus, Arg153 and Arg155 (the latter mutated to Gly in the ISG15 CTD -ΔC probe), are cradled by an acidic groove that consists of Asp49, Glu96, and Glu147 on Lb pro (Fig.  S3G) . Furthermore, ISG15 Leu154 occupies a hydrophobic pocket commonly found in papain-like enzymes. Mutation of either Leu154 or Arg155 to Ala in proISG15 strongly reduced cleavage by Lb pro (Fig. S3H) . However, these C-terminal mutations do not prevent ISG15 binding, since the ISG15 CTD -ΔC suicide probe that lacks Arg155 was able to modify Lb pro (Fig. 2  B and C) . The importance of the C terminus explains, at least in part, the observed weak cross-reactivity with ubiquitin and NEDD8, which feature identical or similar C-terminal sequences, respectively, and also, the inability of Lb pro to target other modifiers, such as SUMO1, which feature more divergent C-terminal sequences (24) (Fig. S3F) . The observed interactions closely mimic those seen in the previously determined structure of Lb pro carrying out self-processing of its own C terminus (23) (Fig. 2E and Fig. S3F ). Analysis of ISG15 Specificity. Another interaction site between ISG15 and Lb pro centers on the conserved Trp123 of ISG15 ( Fig.  3A and Fig. S4A ), the main hydrophobic ISG15 surface used in other deISGylases (Fig. S4B) (18, 19, 22, 25) . Lb pro utilizes a corresponding hydrophobic ISG15 binding surface formed by Leu92, Pro99 in the α3/α4 loop, and residues, including Leu102 on the α4 helix to shape the overall structure of the binding site ( Fig. 3A and Fig. S3C ); mutations in these residues decrease Lb pro activity toward ISG15 (Fig. 3B and Fig. S4C ). Importantly, this loop is not involved in interactions used during self-processing (Fig. 2E) , and consequently and consistently, mutants in the ISG15 binding site are neither affected in their ability to self-process nor affected in their ability to cleave eIF4G (Fig. S5) . Hence, substrate and ISG15 binding sites are spatially separated. In ISG15, mutation of Trp123 to Ala leads to a significant reduction of cleavage by Lb pro (Fig. 3C) . Trp123 is also a major difference between ISG15 and ubiquitin, where the structurally equivalent residue is Arg42 (Fig. 3D) . Mutation of ubiquitin Arg42 to Trp in the context of an Met1-linked ubiquitin chain significantly reduced cleavage of this chain type by the Met1 linkage-specific DUB OTULIN (26) (Fig. S4D ) but enhanced ubiquitin chain cleavage by Lb pro (Fig. 3E and Fig. S4E ). This reveals one component of how Lb pro distinguishes modifiers. Substrate Cleavage in Cells. Given the high level of Lb pro activity against ISG15 in vitro ( Fig. 1 A and B) , we were curious whether this activity and noncanonical cleavage were detectable in a biological context. Transfection of FLAG-tagged ISG15 and the ISG15 assembly machinery (UBE1L, UBE2L6, and HERC5) led to robust ISGylation in HeLa cells. Treatment of these cell lysates with Lb pro collapsed the ISGylated proteins, while free ISG15 remained seemingly unchanged ( Fig. 4A and Fig. S6C ). Serendipitously, we observed that ISG15 cross-reacted with a polyclonal antiubiquitin antibody (Fig. S6 A and B) . Treatment with Lb pro specifically removed this cross-reaction, indicating that a fraction of the polyclonal antibody detects an epitope spanning the identical C terminus of both modifiers (Fig. S6 A  and B) . Antibody cross-reactivity provided us with a tool to monitor ISG15 cleavage by Lb pro in cell extracts. Indeed, when transfection cell lysates were probed with the polyclonal antiubiquitin antibody, the ISG15 cross-reactive band was no longer detected after Lb pro treatment, indicating that Lb pro had hydrolyzed the ISG15 C terminus (Fig. 4A, red box) . The antiubiquitin blot also showed that ubiquitin modifications in Lb pro -treated samples were only partially processed, confirming ISG15 preference in complex samples (Fig. 4A) . This was in stark contrast to the CCHFV vOTU domain, which cleaves ubiquitin and ISG15 similarly (18, 19) and collapsed both types of signals to the same extent (Fig. 4A) . To further visualize Lb pro activity, we exploited a previously developed antibody that recognizes GlyGly-modified Lys residues (27, 28) . This anti-GlyGly antibody has so far only been used to enrich ubiquitinated tryptic peptides in MS applications (27, 28) . Rewardingly, probing these same reactions with the anti-GlyGly antibody produced a smear of strong signals across a wide range of molecular weights in the Lb pro -treated sample (Fig.  4A ). These signals correspond to the Lb pro -produced GlyGlymodified proteome. Revealing Lb pro Activity During Viral Infection. To assess the impact of Lb pro activity during viral infection, we first exploited a chimera viral infection model (29) . A mengovirus (a strain of encephalomyocarditis, a picornavirus that is closely related to FMDV) system was engineered, in which the Leader protein was inactivated by mutations and functionally replaced by WT Lb pro or catalytically inactive Lb pro Cys51Ala as a leader protease. We monitored Lb pro activity in a time course with anti-ISG15, antiubiquitin, and anti-GlyGly antibodies (Fig. 4B and Fig. S6D ). With inactive Lb pro , ISG15 modifications were visibly increased 6-8 h postinfection, whereas no visible changes to total ubiquitin and no signal in the anti-GlyGly Western blot were apparent. In contrast, mengovirus with active Lb pro resulted in a decrease in ISG15 signals, a slight decrease in ubiquitin signals, and importantly, the appearance of GlyGly-modified proteins at 6 and especially, 8 h postinfection (Fig.  4B and Fig. S6D ). This indicates that, indeed, production of active Lb pro by the virus leads to incomplete hydrolysis of ISG15 and ubiquitin from substrates, which can be visualized using available ubiquitin proteomics antibodies. Importantly, Lb pro activity can also be visualized during FMDV infection [e.g., using baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells transfected with FLAG-tagged ISG15 and the ISG15 conjugation system]. Before infection, transfection leads to robust FLAG signals, whereas anti-GlyGly signals are absent. FMDV infection induces collapsing of FLAG signals coinciding with the appearance of GlyGly-modified proteins. Within 4 h of FMDV infection, the anti-GlyGly antibody labels hundreds of proteins across a broad molecular weight range (Fig. 4C) . We are not aware of a similar host cell-derived viralinduced epitope that is detectable with such relative ease. Importantly, this epitope originates from host proteins and cannot acquire mutations due to viral evolution.
