To evaluate whether DC-SIGN recognizes M. leprae, we performed cold binding assays using fluorescently labeled bacilli and DC-SIGN-expressing recombinant HeLa cells as previously described [5, 11] . Green fluorescent protein-expressing M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis were included as controls because it has been previously shown that DC-SIGN preferentially binds to species of the M. tuberculosis complex, such as M. tuberculosis, as compared to other mycobacterial species including fast-growers such as M. smegmatis [11, 12] . Such preferential recognition may rely on the differential presence of mannose capping residues on the cell surfaceexposed lipoarabinomannan among the different mycobacterial species [12] and on the presence of DC-SIGNspecific ligands within the cell wall of species of the M. tuberculosis complex [11] . Binding of M. leprae to DC-SIGN-expressing cells was 8.0(Ϯ3.7)-fold higher than that in control HeLa cells. As expected, binding of M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis to DC-SIGN-expressing cells was 8.3(Ϯ4.1)-and 1.8(Ϯ0.2)-fold higher than that in control HeLa cells, respectively (Figure 1 ). In light of the observed recognition of M. leprae by DC-SIGN, we subsequently explored the relationship between DC-SIGN polymorphisms with susceptibility to leprosy per se and disease outcome in a cohort of Pakistani origin. To uncover polymorphic positions in our study population, we first adopted a sequencing strategy of the ϳ5.5-kb DC-SIGN genomic region, including the seven coding exons, all introns, and ϳ1000 bp situated 5= of the start codon, in 30 randomly chosen individuals (60 chromosomes). This initial resequencing step revealed 21 polymorphisms. Using polymorphisms with a minimum allele frequency of 0.05, we reconstructed haplotypes over the entire gene region and defined the minimum number of SNPs explaining most haplotype diversity (haplotype-tagging SNPs: htSNPS). Seven htSNPS were then selected and genotyped in the entire panel of 272 individuals. All these htSNPs were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Table 1 reports the al- lelic frequencies of the seven htSNPs in the different study groups and the comparisons between leprosy patients and controls and between patients presenting the two polarities of the disease (i.e., BT ϩ TT versus BL ϩ LL). Although some variation in allelic frequencies was observed, no significant differences either between patients and controls or between the two groups of leprosy patients were detected. Likewise, when performing the analysis at the haplotype level (results not shown), a 2 test revealed no statistical differences in the global distribution of haplotype frequencies in any of the groups' comparisons (all p values being Ͼ0.60).
