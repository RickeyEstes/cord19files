A total of 278 nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested in this study. Among the 278 nasopharyngeal aspirates, 7 (2.5%) were infected with human bocavirus (Lin et al., 2007) , nasopharyngeal aspirates were positive for WUPyV in one child (0.4%) no other virus including KI virus were found. The age of WUPyV-infected child was 3 years, who was female. Furthermore the clinical symptoms were consistent with acute lower respiratory tract infection. Two sequences corresponding to WUPyV VP2 and LTAg gene were aligned with many sequences (GenBank accession numbers: EU041608, EF639288, EF639282, AM778548, AM778540, AM778536, NC009539, EF444590, EF444554, EF444550, and EF444549) downloaded from GenBank using Clustal W, respectively. The results showed that the sequences obtained from this study were identical to above reference sequences (Figs. 1 and 2). Our VP2 and LTAg sequence shared 100% nucleotide and amino acid identity with the WUPyV prototype strains B0, S1 and S2. Furthermore, the VP2 gene of WUPyV was deposited in Gen-Bank with Sequin, named WU polyomavirus-CLFF-VP2. The GenBank accession number was EU277015. Furthermore, the genome of WUPyV had been deposited in GenBank with Sequin under accession number EU296475, named WU polyomavirus-CLFF. When we aligned the sequence of CLFF with WUPyV prototype strains B0, S1 and S2, the results illustrated that CLFF shared 99.9% nucleotide and amino acid identity with prototype strains. The above result showed that the sequence of WU polyomavirus-CLFF was identical to above reference sequences of prototype strains (Fig. 3) . The above results showed that a total of 1 (0.4%) of 278 specimens tested were positive for WUPyV. This study was limited by small population size and short study period. So in a future study, we should collected more specimens for further prospective researching epidemiological regularity, season distribution in China, coinfection with other respiratory viruses, clinical specific symptom about WUPyV.
