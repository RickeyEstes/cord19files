The Table shows the result of our baseline calculations. For the 30% non-ILI acute-care patients, we attributed 24.8 (SD 9.9) mean NEMS points; for the ILI patients, we attributed 28.6 (SD 9.8) mean NEMS points. We assume that an ICU nurse can deliver 46.3 NEMS points in 24 hours. Because HCWs will become ill as the population does, the number of NEMS points available will be reduced as the pandemic period progresses; the lowest number will occur at 28 days, when the pandemic period is assumed to be at its highest point (online Appendix Table 1 , available from www. cdc.gov/EID/content/14/10/1518-appT1.htm). The lowest number of NEMS points will occur at day 43, when AVM is available for the population (online Appendix Table 2 , available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/14/10/1518-appT2.htm). As can be seen from both online Appendix Tables, HCW shortage will occur if the ICU admission rate increases to 50% (mean length of stay 8 days or 15 days without AVM). However, if AVM is available, no HCW shortage will occur, under the premises that all general medicine and surgery have been temporarily stopped.
