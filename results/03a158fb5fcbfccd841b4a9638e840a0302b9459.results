Generation of L1 homology models representing the Alpha-9 genotypes. The crystal structure of the HPV16 L1 capsomer (Protein Data Bank [PDB] Code: 2R5H) was used as the template to which the L1 amino acid sequences representing the Alpha-9 PsV were modelled. Three amino acid residues differ between the L1 sequences of the HPV16 crystal and PsV: two positons in the EF loop (Q177N and Q181N) and one position in the FG loop (A266T). These sequence differences did not appear to adversely impact upon the quality of the HPV16 L1 homology model which had a Global Model Quality Estimation (GMQE) score of 1.00. The L1 homology models representing the remaining Alpha-9 genotypes produced GMQE scores of 0.99 (HPV31 and HPV35) and 0.98 (HPV33, HPV52 and HPV58). The crystal structure of the HPV35 L1 capsomer (PDB Code: 2R5J) was used as a control to evaluate the structural accuracy of the HPV35 PsV L1 homology model based upon the HPV16 crystal structure. The pairwise comparison of the homology model on the HPV35 crystal structure by superimposition demonstrated a root mean square (RMS) deviation of 0.68 Å. Prediction of L1 loop structural differences. Pairwise model comparisons were carried out between the HPV16 PsV L1 homology model and the L1 homology models of each individual non-vaccine Alpha-9 PsV. The L1 loops (Fig. 1a) were analysed for any predicted changes between the two models ( Fig. 1b-f ) with the distance between altered loop structures summarised (Fig. 1g) . The superimposition of the non-vaccine Alpha-9 homology models onto the HPV16 homology model generated the following RMS deviations: HPV31 0.26 Å; HPV33 0.47 Å; HPV35 0.47 Å; HPV52 0.49 Å and HPV58 0.41 Å. The estimated loop distance between homology models was considered significant if the distance measured between HPV16 and a non-vaccine genotype for an individual loop was greater than the RMS value generated by the pairwise comparison of the homology models. Structural changes in the BC loop were predicted for all non-vaccine genotypes except HPV35 (Fig. 1b) , with the shifts in the BC loop compared to HPV16 ranging from a mean 1.83 ± (s.d.) 0.83 Å for HPV58 to 4.45 ± 0.18 Å for HPV31 (Fig. 1g) . These predicted structural changes appeared to be attributable to the insertion of additional amino acid residues into the BC loops of HPV31 (Pro 58 ), HPV33 (Ala 58 ), HPV52 (Ser 57 , Gly 58 and Gly 60 ) and HPV58 (Asn 58 ) in comparison to HPV16. No structural changes in the DE loop were predicted between the L1 homology models representing the non-vaccine Alpha-9 genotypes compared to HPV16 (Fig. 1c) . The DE encircles the lumen of the capsomer (Fig. 1a) and it is the only L1 loop which does not contain any insertions or deletions within the amino acid sequences of the non-vaccine genotypes relative to HPV16. All the non-vaccine Alpha-9 homology models were predicted to have structural changes in the EF loop compared to the HPV16 model (Fig. 1d) . Genotypes HPV33 and HPV58 had single amino acid residue deletions within the EF loop that correspond to Gly 183 within the EF loop of HPV16, which may contribute towards the mean EF loop shifts of 4.11 ± 0.43 Å for HPV33 and 1.17 ± 0.14 Å for HPV58 compared to HPV16 (Fig. 1g ). In contrast, the predicted structural changes in the EF loops of HPV31, HPV35 and HPV52 were not underpinned by amino acid residue insertions or deletions in comparison with HPV16. Scientific RepoRts | 6:39730 | DOI: 10.1038/srep39730 Structural changes in the FG loop were predicted for HPV35 and HPV52 (Fig. 1e ) with a mean FG loop shift compared to HPV16 of 2.65 ± 0.06 Å and 3.31 ± 0.19 Å, respectively (Fig. 1g ). Both these genotypes have FG loop amino acid residue deletions (HPV35: Corresponding to Ser 280 and Gly 281 of HPV16) or insertions (HPV52: Asn 284 and Ser 285 ) in comparison with HPV16 which appeared to influence these predicted structural changes. The FG amino acid sequence of HPV31, HPV33 and HPV58 contained no residue deletions or insertions in comparison with HPV16, and no structural changes in the FG loop were predicted for these non-vaccine genotypes compared to HPV16. The HI loops of HPV33, HPV52 and HPV58 have an amino acid residue deletion and HI (f) with loops colour-coded by genotype.

Key indicates Å distance from HPV16 with (-) indicating that it was not possible to resolve any potential differences between loops. which corresponds to Thr 350 within the HI loop of HPV16. The three L1 homology models representing these non-vaccine genotypes were predicted to have structural changes compared to HPV16 homology model within the HI loop, in comparison to HPV31 and HPV35 for which no structural changes were predicted (Fig. 1f ). Design and generation of chimeric PsV. The predicted structural differences between the L1 loops of the non-vaccine Alpha-9 PsV compared to the HPV16 PsV were used to inform the design of chimeric PsV with inter-genotype loop swaps. It was reasoned that the L1 loops of the non-vaccine genotypes which presented a similar topography to the corresponding L1 loop of HPV16, were more likely to be recognised by vaccine-induced cross-neutralising antibodies. Based upon this rationale, the DE loop was considered to be a candidate for further investigation based upon the predicted structural similarity between the DE loops of all the non-vaccine Alpha-9 genotypes compared to HPV16 (Fig. 1c) . In contrast, the frequency of predicted structural divergence observed between the BC and EF loops (Fig. 1b,d) of the non-vaccine genotypes and HPV16 negated any further investigation of these two loops. Both the FG and HI loops (Fig. 1e ,f) were chosen for further investigation based upon their predicted structural similarity between HPV16 and the non-vaccine Alpha-9 genotype HPV31 which is frequently recognised by cross-neutralising antibodies 23, 33 . A panel of chimeric L1L2 PsV with inter-genotype DE, FG and HI loop swaps in isolation or combination were designed and generated. The loop swaps were made between HPV31, a genotype recognised by cross-neutralising antibodies and HPV35, which was chosen as the background control since cross-neutralising antibodies demonstrate minimal recognition of this genotype. The number of amino acid residues which were substituted between HPV31 and HPV35 differed between the three loops. The DE, which is the longest L1 loop, only had five positions where the residues varied between HPV31 and HPV35. The thirty residue long FG loop had eleven variable positions whilst the HI, which is the shortest L1 loop, varied at nine of its sixteen amino acid positions. The L1L2 PsV with either a HPV31 or HPV35 backbone and single (DE, FG & HI), double (DEFG, DEHI & FGHI) or triple (DEFGHI) loop swaps (Fig. 2a) generated similarly-sized particles and particle-to-infectivity (PI) ratios. For example, the PsV with a HPV31 backbone produced a median PI ratio of 350 (IQR, 173 to 1,259) compared to a PI ratio of 392 (IQR, 284 to 1,669) produced by the PsV with a HPV35 backbone (Fig. 2b ). Cross-neutralising antibody recognition of specific L1 domains. Thirty-six HPV vaccinee sera (Cervarix ® n = 19; Gardasil ® n = 17) were tested against the chimeric L1L2 PsV. The cross-neutralising titres generated against the chimeric L1L2 PsV with a HPV31 backbone were compared against the HPV31 PsV whilst the titres generated against the chimeric L1L2 PsV with a HPV35 backbone were compared against the HPV35 PsV (Fig. 3) . It was reasoned that the introduction of HPV35 loops into a HPV31 backbone would result in the reduction of cross-neutralising antibody recognition of HPV31. The incorporation of the HPV35 HI loop alone did not result in a reduction in cross-neutralising antibody recognition; however, the incorporation of the HPV35 DE loop (Fig. 3 ) reduced cross-neutralising antibody recognition of HPV31 by a median 4.0-fold (IQR, 2.0 to 6.5-fold; Wilcoxon paired signed-rank test, p < 0.001). The largest impact of any single or combination loop swap was observed with the HPV35 FG loop alone which resulted in a median decrease in cross-neutralising antibody recognition of 19.0-fold (IQR, 8.3 to 41.4-fold; p < 0.001) compared to the HPV31 PsV. The transfer of cross-neutralising antibody recognition to HPV35 was not supported by either the introduction of the HPV31 DE or HI loop into the HPV35 backbone, both of which had no significant effect on cross-neutralising antibody recognition of HPV35 producing geometric mean titres (GMT) of 25 (95% CI, 21 to 31; p = 0.637) and 22 (95% CI, 18 to 28; p = 0.322), respectively, compared to the HPV35 PsV titre of 22 (95% CI, 18 to 25) (Fig. 3) . Conversely, the introduction of the HPV31 FG loop into the HPV35 L1 backbone significantly Fine-mapping of cross-neutralising antibody epitope footprint. In order to predict the residues within the DE and FG loops which may be involved in the epitope footprint(s) recognised by vaccine-induced cross-neutralising antibodies, the DE and FG loop amino acid sequences of HPV16, HPV31 and HPV35 were aligned (Fig. 4a) . Amino acid positions for which HPV16 (vaccine type) and HPV31 (cross-neutralising antibody target) shared the same residue but HPV35 (background control) did not, were identified in the DE (Ala 137 ) and FG loops (Ser 281 , Gly 282 , Ser 283 , Ala 285 , Ala 288 and Ser 290 ). These residues were selected to undergo site-directed mutagenesis to determine their contribution to the epitope footprint recognised by cross-neutralising antibodies, alongside additional sites where the residue differed between HPV31 and HPV35 (DE: Phe 127 , Gly 139 and Pro 140 ; FG: Ser 271 and Thr 274 ) (Fig. 4b) . A panel of seven chimeric L1L2 PsV with a HPV35 backbone and HPV31 DE and FG loop swaps were generated. These chimeric PsV harboured single or double amino acid residue switches incorporated in either the DE or FG loop whereby the amino acids present in HPV31 were swapped for the amino acids present at those positions in HPV35 (Fig. 4c) . The PsV particles generated were of a similar size and had similar PI ratios. A subset of twenty-four HPV vaccinee sera (Cervarix ® n = 12; Gardasil ® n = 12), from the original panel of thirty-six, were tested against the seven new chimeric L1L2 PsV and the cross-neutralising titres generated were compared against the chimeric L1L2 PsV with a HPV35 backbone and HPV31 DE and FG loops (Fig. 5a) . Within the DE loop of HPV31, amino acid switches F127L and A137V did not result in a significant reduction in cross-neutralising antibody recognition; however, the dual amino switches of G139N and P140S reduced cross-neutralising antibody recognition by a median 1.6-fold (IQR, 1.2 to 2.0-fold; Wilcoxon paired signed-rank test, p < 0.001). The amino acid switches within the FG were separated into the early region (HPV16 numbering: Ala 264 to Lys 278 ) and the late region (Gly 279 to Ser 288 ) of the loop. The dual amino acid switches within the late region (S283T and A285G; A288P and S290T) resulted in a significant reduction in cross-neutralising antibody recognition; however, the most dramatic impact was observed by the dual amino acid deletion at positions S281Del and G282Del which produced a cross-neutralising titre [GMT of 17 (95% CI, 13 to 27; p < 0.001)] lower than the titre observed against the HPV35 PsV [40 (95% CI, 33 to 47)] (Fig. 5a) . In contrast, the dual amino acid switch at positions S271T and T274A within the early region did not result in a reduction in cross-neutralising antibody recognition. Mapping of the mutagenised residues within the DE and FG loops on to the HPV31 L1 homology model demonstrated that these positions are all surface-exposed on the capsid (Fig. 5b) and that the amino acid positions within the late region of the FG which had the biggest impact upon cross-neutralising antibody recognition (S281Del and G282Del; S283T and A285G) are clustered together at the intersection between the FG and DE loops.
