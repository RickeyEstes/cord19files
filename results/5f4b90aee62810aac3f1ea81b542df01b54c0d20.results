As shown (Fig. 1) , CCV1 and CCV2 primers specific for the target sequence of M gene generated, as expected, a 409 bp amplified product with the following viral strains: CCV USDA, CCV 45/93, FIPV and TGEV, but not with BCV and IBV. CCV2 and CCV3 primers used for n-PCR generated a 230 bp amplicon in the same coronavirus strains amplified by the first PCR, with the exception of FIPV (Fig. 2) . The CCV infectious titer in A-72 cells was 10 5.75 TCID 50 , whereas the detection limit by PCR was the 10 − 4 dilution (Fig. 3) . Using the same virus dilutions, the genomic RNA was detected by n-PCR up to the 10 − 6 dilution (Fig. 4) . The PCR carried out on fecal samples gave positive results for three of the six diarroheic specimens. Two of three samples PCR-positive, previously resulted positive in EM examinations. The fecal samples from normal dogs consistently gave negative results. The n-PCR gave positive results for four of the six diarroheic fecal samples, whereas the samples from normal dogs gave negative results. 3 . Sensitivity of PCR on log 10 dilutions of CCV: amplified products of 409 bp using CCV1 and CCV2 primers. Lane 1, marker (Gene Ruler TM 100 bp DNA Ladder Plus, Fermentas); lanes 2 -9, undiluted, 10 − 1 , 10 − 2 , 10 − 3 , 10 − 4 , 10 − 5 , 10 − 6 , 10 − 7 . Fig. 4 . Sensitivity of n-PCR on log 10 dilutions of CCV: amplified products of 230 bp using CCV2 and CCV3 primers. Lane 1, marker (Gene Ruler TM 100 bp DNA Ladder Plus, Fermentas); lanes 2 -9, undiluted, 10 − 1 , 10 − 2 , 10 − 3 , 10 − 4 , 10 − 5 , 10 − 6 , 10 − 7 . CCV, FIPV and TGEV by PCR; CCV and TGEV by n-PCR. However, this limit does not restrict the use of either method in routine laboratory diagnostic tests. Our principal interest was to develop both PCR and n-PCR as methods to rapidly differentiate CCV infections from other canine enteric pathogens which cause similar clinical illness. The diagnosis of CCV enteritis would be more rapid with the PCR assay than with virus isolation in cell cultures, and would obviate the need for EM, which may provide spurious results. Moreover, the PCR test allows the detection of denatured CCV in fecal samples.
