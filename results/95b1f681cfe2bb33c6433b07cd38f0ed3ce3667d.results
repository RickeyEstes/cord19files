Homology modelling and topology of CASD1. Human CASD1 encodes a multimembrane spanning protein of 797 amino acids. For residues 83-290, homology modelling predicted a GDSL/SGNH-like a/b-fold that forms the scaffold for a catalytic triad composed of S94, D270 and H273, with S94 as part of a conserved GDS sequence motif (Fig. 1a) . The acronyms of the family name GDSL/SGNH reflect the presence of four invariant residues, namely S in a GDS(L) motif, G located after strand S2, N placed in a GxND motif after strand S3 and H found in a DxxH motif N-terminal to the last helix 38 . However, the N-terminal domain of CASD1 differs from the canonical GDSL/SGNH fold by lacking the conserved residues G and N, and is therefore grouped into pfam family PF13839 (GDSL/SGNH-like acylesterase family found in Pmr5 and Cas1p) 39 . To analyse the subcellular localization and topology of CASD1, a full-length variant, containing an N-terminal V5 and a C-terminal Myc epitope, was expressed in the murine fibroblast cell line LM-TK À . The orientation of the epitope tags was determined by selective membrane permeabilization and immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 1b,c) . Under conditions that allowed antibody access to all cellular compartments (0.2% Triton X-100), both tags were detectable and showed co-localization with the Golgi marker a-mannosidase II (a-Man II). Selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane with low concentrations of digitonin (5 mg ml À 1 ) allowed visualization of the N-terminal V5-tag, but not the C-terminal Myc-tag, demonstrating cytosolic and luminal orientation of N-and C-terminus, respectively. The integrity of the Golgi membrane was demonstrated by parallel staining with an antibody specific for the luminal domain of a-Man II 40 . Staining was observed exclusively in Triton X-100, but not in digitonin-permeabilized cells. Identical results were obtained on staining with an antibody against the SGNH-like domain of CASD1 (pAb 500), demonstrating that this domain faces the Golgi lumen (Fig. 1c) . On the basis of these results and on our predictions for the CASD1 transmembrane domains ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ), we propose a topology model encompassing a luminal catalytic domain flanked by one N-terminal and 12 C-terminal transmembrane domains (Fig. 1a) . CASD1 forms a covalent acetyl-enzyme intermediate. To analyse the enzymatic activity of CASD1 in vitro, we generated a construct that allowed the expression of a soluble secreted form of CASD1 (termed sCASD1), which encompassed the SGNH-like luminal domain and a C-terminal Myc-His 6 -tag (Fig. 2a-c) . This form was produced in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells, either as wild-type variant (sCASD1-wt) or as active site serine mutant (sCASD1-S94A). Affinity purified proteins were then used as an enzyme source for in vitro assays. First, we analysed whether sCASD1 possesses esterase activity, since the GDSL/SGNH fold is usually found among hydrolytic enzymes 38 , including the sialate 9-O-acetylesterase of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and the sialate 9-O-acetylesterase domains of the haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) proteins of influenza C and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) [41] [42] [43] . However, under conditions that displayed high O-acetyltransferase activity for BCoV-HE, no activity was observed for sCASD1-wt, neither towards the synthetic acetylesterase substrate para-nitrophenylacetate (pNP-acetate; Fig. 2d ) nor towards natural O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates (not shown). Thus, while the N-terminal luminal domain of CASD1 displays the characteristic fold of an esterase 39 , it does not appear to function as such. We therefore tested whether sCASD1 might catalyse the reverse reaction and act as a SOAT. Indeed, in the presence of [ 3 H]acetyl-CoA, sCASD1-wt showed acetyltransferase activity, resulting in the formation of radiolabelled protein, even in the absence of acceptor substrates (Fig. 2e) . No radioactive incorporation was seen in parallel experiments with the mutant sCASD1-S94A, demonstrating that the observed acetyl transfer was enzyme catalysed. SOAT activity of sCASD1 towards its own N-glycans was improbable. Although sCASD1 is N-glycosylated (Fig. 2c) , glycoproteins that are produced in Sf9 cells typically bear pauci mannosidic N-glycans lacking penultimate galactose and terminal Sia residues 44 . Consequently, we asked whether sCASD1 can catalyse the formation of a covalent acetyl-enzyme intermediate that could be trapped in the absence of acceptor substrate. Therefore, purified sCASD1 was incubated in the presence or absence of acetyl-CoA, digested with trypsin and analysed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). After incubation of sCASD1-wt with acetyl-CoA, the peptide containing the active site residue S94 (87-HIAFIGDSR-95) occurred as a mixed population of unmodified and modified peptide with a mass shift of 42 Da (shift by m/z ¼ 21 for the doubly charged ion), consistent with the formation of an acetyl adduct ( Fig. 2f ; note that the sequence of the peptides was confirmed by tandem MS/MS; see Supplementary Fig. 2) . Analysis of the peak areas in the extracted ion chromatograms revealed that about 19% of the peptide population was acetylated ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). In parallel experiments with sCASD1-S94A, only the respective unmodified peptide (87-HIAFIGDAR-95) was found ( Fig. 2f ; To test SOAT activity, purified sCASD1 was incubated with acetyl-CoA and Sia-containing acceptor substrates. After the reaction, Sia was released by acidic hydrolysis to allow derivatization with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxy-benzene (DMB) at the free reducing end. The obtained fluorescent Sia derivatives were analysed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Fig. 3a -e). SOAT activity was clearly detected towards CMP-Neu5Ac (as indicated by an additional peak in the HPLC profile, which eluted at the same retention time as DMBderivatized 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac (Neu5,9Ac 2 ) of the reference panel; see Fig. 3a ,c). The additional peak was not detected in samples obtained from parallel reactions without enzyme (Fig. 3b ) or from reactions with sCASD1-S94A (Fig. 3d) . Compared with free Neu5Ac or sialoglycoconjugates, CMP-Neu5Ac was by far the best acceptor substrate (Fig. 3e) . The identity of the product peak obtained with CMP-Neu5Ac was confirmed by LC-ESI-MS/MS, which showed the expected parent ion mass of DMB-labelled mono-O-acetylated Neu5Ac and a fragmentation pattern characteristic for DMB-Neu5,9Ac 2 (ref. 45 ; Fig. 3f ,g). Together, these data demonstrate that the isolated SGNH-like domain of CASD1 displays SOAT activity in vitro and transfers acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA to CMP-Neu5Ac, resulting in the formation of CMP-Neu5,9Ac 2 . CASD1 mediates 9-O-acetylation of cellular sialoglycans. To study the enzymatic function of CASD1 in a cellular context, we first screened for a mammalian cell line that lacks O-acetylated sialoglycans. As a detection tool, we made use of the haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein of BCoV. BCoV uses 9-Oacetylated sialoglycans as host cell receptors and the HE contains Importantly, all cell lines that were positive for 9-O-acetylation were also positive for CASD1 transcripts ( Supplementary Fig. 4b ). In fact, we found only a single cell line, the murine fibroblast cell line LM-TK À , that was devoid of both ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Transfection of this naturally occurring O-Ac-negative cell line with CASD1 complementary DNA (cDNA), but not empty vector, led to the formation of Golgi-resident 9-O-acetylated In all profiles, the retention time corresponding to DMB-Neu5,9Ac 2 of the reference panel is highlighted by a grey box. (e) SOAT activity of sCASD1 towards different acceptor substrates. Purified sCASD1wt and sCASD1-S94A were incubated with acetyl-CoA and the indicated acceptor substrates. Product analysis was performed by DMB-HPLC analysis and the amount of DMB-Neu5,9Ac 2 was quantified by integrating the corresponding peak areas. Parallel HPLC runs of reactions without CASD1 were used to measure the background, and data are presented as background subtracted data with the values obtained for CMP-Neu5Ac in the presence of sCASD1-wt and acetyl-CoA set to 100% (mean ± s.d., n (Fig. 4a) . De-Oacetylation, by either alkali treatment or the sialate 9-Oacetylesterase activity of BCoV-HE, completely abolished the virolectin signals and was used as specificity control (Fig. 4a) . After stable expression of wild-type CASD1, 9-O-acetylated sialoglycotopes were detected in all cells and co-localized with the Golgi marker a-Man II and Golgi-localized V5-tagged CASD1 (Fig. 4b) . Introduction of the S94A exchange into full-length CASD1 (CASD1-S94A) resulted in a loss of function. Although the mutant protein was expressed and localized to the Golgi, virolectin staining was seen only in o1% of the cells (Fig. 4c) . Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that CASD1 mediates sialate 9-O-acetylation in LM-TK À cells and that this function is impaired by alanine exchange of S94. CASD1 knockout abolishes Sia O-acetylation in HAP1 cells. To confirm that CASD1 plays a crucial role in the formation of 9-Oacetylated sialoglycans, we generated a CASD1 knockout in the near-haploid human cell line HAP1 using the CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/ CRISPR-associated 9) system 48 . The obtained knockout cell line (HAP1 DCASD1 ) harbours a 16-bp frame shift mutation in exon 3 of CASD1, allowing only the production of a truncated polypeptide that already lacks S94, the most N-terminally located residue of the catalytic triad ( Fig. 5a-c) . Whereas parental HAP1 cells expressed 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans in the Golgi apparatus, 9-O-acetylation was completely lost in HAP1 DCASD1 cells (Fig. 5d) . This was further confirmed by DMB-HPLC analysis revealing the presence of DMB-derivatized Neu5,9Ac 2 in parental but not in HAP1 DCASD1 cells ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Transfection with CASD1 cDNA, but not empty vector, resulted in successful complementation of the loss-of-function defect and restored 9-O-acetylation of Golgi-localized sialoglycotopes (Fig. 5e) . Of note, a genetic knockout carried out in parallel in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells showed the same outcome ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ) and thus provided independent evidence for the essential role of CASD1 in Sia 9-O-acetylation. CASD1 mediates 9-O-acetylation of gangliosides. On the basis of HAP1 and HAP1 DCASD1 cells, we next explored the role of CASD1 in the 9-O-acetylation of gangliosides such as GD3. To do so, we made use of a set of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that distinguish between GD3 (CD60a) and 9-O-acetylated GD3 (CD60b). HAP1 cells lack GD3 but can generate the disialo ganglioside after expression of the sialyltransferase ST8Sia I (Fig. 6a; mAb R24 ). ST8Sia I converts GM3 to GD3 by adding an a2,8-linked Sia residue, which in turn can carry an O-acetyl group in C9 position (Fig. 6c) 49 . In HAP1 wild-type cells, expression of ST8Sia I resulted in the formation of both CD60a and CD60b antigens, as shown by additional staining with mAb UM4D4 (Fig. 6a) . As described for other anti-CD60b antibodies, UM4D4 recognizes 9-O-acetylated GD3 and similar gangliosides possessing a terminal 9-O-acetylated disialo group such as 9-Oacetylated disialo neolactotetraosylceramide and 9-O-acetylated disialo neolactohexaosylceramide (see Supplementary Fig. 8c for details on ganglioside structures) 50 . However, binding of mAb UM4D4 strictly relies on the O-acetylation of the carbohydrate epitope and no cross-reactivity towards the unmodified epitope is seen (see refs 50,51 and Supplementary Fig. 8b ). Newly synthesized CD60a and CD60b epitopes were both detected at the cell surface, as demonstrated by respective signals on nonpermeabilized cells. In HAP1 DCASD1 cells, expression of ST8Sia I alone led to the formation of GD3 ( Fig. 6b ; mAb R24) but not 9-O-Ac-GD3 or other 9-O-acetylated gangliosides of the neolacto series ( Fig. 6b; mAb UM4D4) . Ganglioside modification was only detected after co-expression of ST8Sia I with CASD1, demonstrating that CASD1 is crucial for the formation of 9-Oacetylated CD60b epitopes ( Fig. 6b; middle images) . Again, alanine exchange of the active site residue S94 drastically impaired CASD1 function ( Fig. 6b; right images) . The critical role of CASD1 for the formation of 9-O-acetylated CD60b epitopes was further confirmed in HEK293T wt and HEK293T DCASD1 cells by immunofluorescence and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis, whereas no indication for the presence of 7-O-acetylated disialo gangliosides was found ( Supplementary Fig. 8a,b) .
