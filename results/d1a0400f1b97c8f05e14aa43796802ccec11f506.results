The time duration for which reliable measurements could be made using this shadowgraph imaging system (i.e. before the warmer exhaled air had cooled to the same temperature as the ambient laboratory air) was approximately 0.5-2.5 s, depending on the airflow velocities being observed and measured. Within this period, the maximum visible distance over which the sneeze plumes (or puffs) travelled was 0.6 m ( Figure 3A) , with a maximum derived velocity from this measured distance of 4.5 m/s. The maximum 2-D area of the sneeze plumes ( Figure 3B For the re-analysed cough images, the maximum visible distance over which the cough travelled was 0.7 m, with a maximum (i.e. not the purely horizontal, x-component) derived velocity of 5 m/s (with one outlier of approximately 14 m/s), ( Figure 6A ). The maximum 2-D area for coughing was 0.2 m 2 , with the corresponding derived parameter, the maximum 2-D area expansion rate equal to 1.5 m 2 /s ( Figure 6B ). The graphs in Figure 6 showing the maximum values of these parameters appear very similar to those shown in Tang et al. [15] (in Figure 3 in [15] -representing the horizontally-resolved, x-component of these parameters) because many of the volunteers' coughs were in an approximately horizontal direction. Example video images of all of these respiratory activities (sneezing, breathing and coughing) using this shadowgraph technique have been previously published [17] , and readers are referred to this publication for a visual impression of these activities. In particular, for nasal breathing the exhalation plumes for all of the volunteers travelled in a downwards direction, at an angle of 45-60u away from the vertical, whereas for mouth breathing, the exhalation plumes were mainly directed horizontally. From these example video images, surprisingly, neither the nasal nor mouth breathing plumes appeared to be affected by any thermal plume or buoyancy effects within their visible trajectory -indeed, their flows appeared to be driven almost entirely by the exhalation flows from the nose or mouth, with very undisturbed, unidirectional paths.
