NP of IAV interacts with human API5. A human lung cDNA library was screened using NP of IAV (A/chicken/Hatay/2004; H5N1) as bait, in a lexA-(Hybrid Hunter, Invitrogen, CA, USA) based yeast two-hybrid system. 32 The screen led to the identification of API5 as an interactor of NP, confirmed using BLAST analysis (Supplementary Figure S1 ). The interaction between full-length API5 and NP was validated in yeast two-hybrid system, by cloning full-length human cDNA of API5 in frame with activation domain vector pYESTrp2, followed by co-transformation with pHybLex/Zeo-NP in L40 strain of yeast cells. The co-transformants tested positive for histidine prototrophy and β-galactosidase activity (Supplementary Figure S1 ), confirming that IAV NP interacted with full-length human API5 protein. The NP-API5 interaction was further ascertained by performing a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay in mammalian cells. To this end, A549 cells were infected with A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus (H1N1; PR8) and A/Aichi/2/1968 (X31) at an multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. At 16 h post infection (p.i.), cells were collected and lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using antibodies specific for NP and API5. NP of PR8 and X31 virus co-precipitated with API5 ( Figure 1a NP of IAV colocalizes with API5 in the nucleus. Next, we sought to determine the intracellular site of interaction between NP and API5 in mammalian cells using two approaches. According to the first approach, A549 cells Figure 1 Influenza A virus nucleoprotein interacts with API5 in IAV-infected A549 cells. (a) Lung epithelial A549 cells were infected with PR8 at an MOI of 1. At 16 h post infection, cells were collected and lysed for co-immunoprecipitation assays. Panels 1 and 2 show immunoprecipitation of NP by α-NP followed by western blotting with α-API5 antibody and vice versa. Panels 3 and 4 show immunoprecipitation and western blotting with α-NP and α-API5 antibodies, respectively. Panels 5, 6, 9, and 11 show western blotting with α-NP, α-API5, α-NS1, and α-β-actin antibodies. Panels 7 and 8 show immunoprecipitation with α-NS1 (another IAV protein) followed by western blotting with α-API5 and α-NS1 antibody, respectively. Panel 10 shows the isotype control. (b) Lung epithelial A549 cells were infected with X31 at an MOI of 1. At 24 h post infection, cells were collected and lysed for co-immunoprecipitation assays. Panels 2 and 3 show immunoprecipitation of NP by α-NP followed by western blotting with α-API5 antibody and vice versa. Panels 1 and 4 show immunoprecipitation and western blotting with α-API5 and α-NP antibodies, respectively. Panels 5, 6, and 7 show western blotting with α-NP, α-API5, and α-GAPDH antibodies transfected with either control (pcDNA3.1-myc/His) or GFP-tagged NP (pEGFP-NP; Figures 2a and b) were fixed 16 h post transfection and subjected to immunofluorescence assay. In the second approach, A549 cells were infected with PR8 at an MOI of 1, and cells were fixed at 5 and 16 h p.i. followed by immunofluorescence (Figures 2c-e) . As shown in the Figure 2b , NP of IAV colocalizes with API5 in the nucleus. Similar observations were also made in cells infected with PR8 strain of IAV (Figures 2d and e) . It is interesting to note that API5 is a nuclear protein containing an NLS at its C terminus. 30 Further, strong evidence suggests that API5 is a negative regulator of apoptosis induced by E2F1 (a nuclear protein). 31 In light of these reports, nuclear colocalization of API5 with NP of IAV raises an interesting possibility that NP exploits E2F1-mediated apoptotic pathway via its interaction with API5. NP of IAV downregulates API5 expression. Next, we were interested in assessing the cellular status of API5 both in presence of NP and the whole virus. To this end, we examined the effect of transiently transfected NP on API5 transcript, and increasing dosage of transiently transfected NP on API5 protein. As evident from Figures 3a and b , API5 mRNA expression is suppressed by NP, and also API5 Figure 2 NP of IAV colocalizes with cellular API5. (a and b) A549 cells were transfected with either control (pcDNA3.1-myc/His) or NP-GFP (pEGFP-NP) plasmids. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde 16 h post transfection (P.T.), followed by immunostaining using rabbit α-API5 primary antibody and Alexa594-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (red). NP is shown in green and nuclei are stained blue with DAPI. A549 cells were infected with either mock or PR8 at an MOI of 1 and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde 5 h post infection (P.I.) (d) and 16 h post infection (e). API5 was stained using rabbit α-API5 as primary antibody and anti-rabbit conjugated with Alexa594 as secondary antibody (red). NP was stained with mouse α-NP as primary antibody and anti-mouse conjugated with Alexa488 as secondary antibody (green). Nuclei are stained blue with DAPI. (a-c) have a scale of 20 μm and (d and e) have a scale of 10 μm protein levels are negatively correlated to cellular NP levels when compared with control. As a further test of impact of NP on API5 levels, we investigated the effect of virus dose and duration of infection on API5. As shown in Figures 3c and d, significant and progressive decrease in the levels of API5 mRNA and protein was observed upon infecting A549 cells with PR8 virus at increasing MOI when compared with uninfected A549 cells. Further substantiating our observations, a time-dependent decrease in relative levels of API5 mRNA and protein was recorded upon infecting A549 cells with PR8 (Figures 3e and  f) . Collectively, these results indicate a negative impact of IAV infection as well as NP on expression of API5. Thus, there is a high possibility that function of API5 as a suppressor of E2F1-dependent apoptosis may also suffer a setback under these conditions. Induction of APAF1-dependent apoptotic pathway by NP of IAV. Previous studies have shown that E2F1-mediated apoptosis involves APAF1-dependent induction of both initiator and effector caspases. 33 In order to study the effect of NP-API5 association on E2F1-dependent apoptosis, we monitored time-dependent cellular status of APAF1 and initiator and effector caspases in IAV-infected A549 cells. Influenza virus is known to induce apoptosis during later stages of infection in order to facilitate effective viral propaga-tion and dissemination. 34 Concurrent with these findings, we observed a time-dependent increase in APAF1 protein levels, cleaved forms of both caspases 9 and 3 in infected cells (Figure 4a ), indicative of progressive apoptosis. PARP cleavage was used as a marker of caspase activity. In addition, the relative levels of APAF1 mRNA were elevated significantly (~2-fold) in infected cells ( Figure 4b ). Interestingly, overexpression of NP in A549 cells mirrored the effect of IAV infection on cellular apoptosis. As observed during IAV infection, NP overexpression (pcDNA3.1-myc/His-NP) too was marked by elevated levels of cleaved caspases and PARP, underscoring role of NP in IAV-induced apoptosis ( Figure 4c ). Importantly, APAF1 mRNA levels were also increased ( Figure 4d ) indicating involvement of E2F1dependent apoptosis in IAV infection via cross talk with API5. API5 inhibits apoptosis in infected cells. Our observations that IAV stimulates E2F1-dependent apoptosis and that it also directs transcriptional downregulation of antiapoptotic factor API5, prompted us to assess the impact of altering cellular status of API5 on IAV-induced apoptotic signaling. We thus analyzed the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of API5 on E2F1-mediated apoptosis. To this end, A549 cells depleted of API5 were infected with PR8 at an MOI of 1. As depicted in Figure 5a , there is a significant decrease in the levels of procaspases 3 and 9, and concomitant increase in the levels of their cleaved products along with increased PARP cleavage in infected cells treated with API5-specific siRNA when compared with scrambled siRNA. Moreover, relative levels of APAF1 mRNA as well as protein increased markedly upon knockdown of API5 in infected cells (Figures 5a and b) . On the contrary, API5 overexpression in infected cells led to the transcriptional suppression of APAF1 ( Figure 5c ). These observations strongly indicate a negative regulatory role of API5 in IAV-induced apoptosis, which is countered by NP-mediated repression of API5. API5 impairs recruitment of E2F1 on APAF1 promoter in infected cells. It is well established that E2F1-dependent apoptosis involves transcriptional activation of target genes such as APAF1 by E2F1 transcription factor, which further entails physical binding of E2F1 to target gene promoters. 35 In order to delineate mechanistic details of antiapoptotic effects of API5 on E2F1-triggered apoptotic response in IAV-infected cells, we performed ChIP assay to investigate the status of E2F1 recruitment to APAF1 promoter under conditions of API5 depletion and overexpression in infected cells. As shown in Figure 6a , siRNA-mediated knockdown of API5 expression facilitated increased recruitment of E2F1 to APAF1 promoter. By contrast, enforced expression of API5 in infected cells led to abrogation of E2F1 occupancy on APAF1 promoter (Figure 6b ). On the basis of these observations, we conclude that API5, in order to obstruct the proapoptotic pathway, interferes with recruitment of E2F1 transcription factor to target gene promoters such as APAF1. Hence, it is of paramount importance for IAV to direct downregulation of this antiapoptotic factor, in order to ensure successful viral infection and spread. API5 overexpression suppresses apoptosis in IAVinfected as well as NP-transfected cells. Having assessed the effect of API5 on E2F1-dependent transactivation of proapoptotic genes under conditions of infection, we next set out to investigate its impact on the process of apoptosis itself. First, cells were transfected with either control, NP (NP-myc) alone, API5 (API5-Flag) alone or both constructs. Second, cells transfected with either control or API5 (API5-Flag) expression construct followed by infection with PR8 strain. In both cases cells were subjected to analysis for apoptosis using annexin V (an early apoptotic marker) and 7AAD (a late apoptotic marker) staining. As evident in Figures 7a  and b , NP of IAV possesses a proapoptotic function, which is in agreement with previous reports. 21 NP induces~2-fold increase in 7AAD positive and~2.5-fold increase in annexin V positive cells, when compared with control. Interestingly, API5 overexpression mitigates the proapoptotic effect of NP and significantly decreases the percentage of annexin V and 7AAD stained cells. Further substantiating these observations, cells stained positive for annexin V and 7AAD under conditions of IAV infection decreased markedly upon overexpression of API5 (Figures 7c and d) . In all, these observations clearly demonstrate that NP and IAV induce apoptosis in cells, which is significantly attenuated by overexpression of API5. API5 suppresses viral replication. Our findings thus far have highlighted an inhibitory role of API5 in IAV-infected cells, which is exercised via regulation of the E2F1-APAF1 apoptotic pathway. Further, our results also indicate that suppression of API5 by NP is instrumental in ensuring IAV-induced apoptosis. In this regard it is worthy to note that IAV-mediated apoptosis of infected cells favors viral replication and propagation. 36, 37 Considering that API5 plays a critical role in IAV-induced apoptosis, it was imperative for us to evaluate the significance of API5 in IAV replication. For this purpose, we quantified the levels of NP mRNA in IAV-infected cells under conditions of API5 depletion and overexpression. Upon knockdown of API5 expression in A549-infected cells there was a significant upregulation of relative mRNA levels of NP when compared with control ( Figure 8b) . Conversely, enforced expression of API5 led to the downregulation of relative mRNA levels of NP (Figure 8f ). In addition, NP protein levels were in agreement with mRNA levels under conditions of API5 depletion and overexpression in infected cells (Figures 8a and e) . Importantly, API5 depletion in infected cells led to~5-fold increase in the viral titers as determined by plaque assay when compared with control ( Figure 8c) . Conversely, API5 overexpression severely attenuated viral titers (~6-folds) (Figure 8g) . These results were further confirmed using a replicase assay, wherein A549 cells were antibody. The genomic DNA bound to E2F1 antibody was isolated and analyzed by quantitative PCR using APAF1 primers. The data are shown as mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. # and * indicate statistically significant difference at Po0.05 and Po0.01, respectively treated with either non-targeting siRNA or API5-specific siRNA followed by co-transfection with plasmids encoding PR8 polymerase complex genes PB2, PB1, PA, and NP in conjunction with a reporter plasmid containing the UTR of the NS1 segment upstream of the luciferase gene driven by the human RNA pol I promoter. Strengthening our previous observations, replicase assay results showed sixfold elevation in replicase activity upon depletion of API5 (Figure 8d ). Upregulation of NP mRNA, protein levels, polymerase activity as well as viral titers in API5-depleted cells are clear indicators that viral replication is inhibited by the host factor API5. NP interacts and downregulates API5 to relieve suppression of the E2F1-APAF1 apoptotic pathway. Taken together, our findings argue in favor of a critical role of antiapoptotic protein API5 in IAV-induced apoptosis and virus replication. NP-API5 association has a negative bearing on cellular levels of API5, which mitigates API5-induced suppression of E2F1-APAF1-dependent apoptotic signaling thus favoring virus propagation.
