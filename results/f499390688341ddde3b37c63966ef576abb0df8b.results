We calculate the finite population reproductive number for each of the four types of heterogeneity and for heterogeneity in intrinsic mixing. We find: Heterogeneity in intrinsic mixing, R m ðNÞ We solve R m ðNÞ numerically, once for each of two distributions of mixing rates, gamma distributed heterogeneity in mixing (Fig. 2) and log-normally distributed heterogeneity in mixing (Fig.  B3) ; we compare the results of the two distributions for a fixed coefficient of variation (Fig. 3) . Heterogeneity in transmission mixing R tm ðNÞ We solve R tm ðNÞ numerically, once for each of the two distributions of transmission mixing rates, gamma distributed heterogeneity in transmission mixing (Fig. 4) and log-normally distributed heterogeneity in transmission mixing (Fig. B2) ; we compare the results of the two distributions for a fixed coefficient of variation (Fig. 5) . Heterogeneity in transmission probability R tp ðNÞ We solve for R tp ðNÞ numerically, once for each of the two distributions of mixing rates, beta-distributed heterogeneity (Fig. 6) and logit-normally distributed heterogeneity (Fig. B2) ; we 9 . The finite-population reproductive numbers, Rs m ðNÞ, versus the basic reproductive number, R 0 for gamma distributed (light green) and log-normally distributed (forest green) heterogeneity for CV ¼2. The population size is N ¼ 500, R 0 is the solid black line, the homogeneous finite-population reproductive number, RðNÞ, is the dotted black line, and the dot-dashed lines represent heterogeneous finite-population reproductive numbers with different coefficients of variation.

Heterogeneity in susceptible mixing, R sm ðNÞ We solve for R sm ðNÞ numerically, once for each of the two distributions of mixing rates, gamma-distributed heterogeneity (Fig. 8) and log-normally distributed heterogeneity (Fig. B2) ; we compare the results of the two distributions for a fixed coefficient of variation (Fig. 9) . Heterogeneity in susceptibility probability R sp ðNÞ We solve for R sp ðNÞ numerically, once for each of the two distributions of mixing rates, beta-distributed heterogeneity (Fig. 10) and logit-normally distributed heterogeneity (Fig. B2) ; we compare the results of the two distributions for a fixed coefficient of variation (Fig. 11) . Figs. 2 (a), 4(a), 6(a), 8(a), 10(a) and B1(a), B2(a), B2(c), B2(e), B2 (g) show how the finite-population reproductive numbers change as R 0 changes for a fixed population size. Since the finitepopulation reproductive numbers are limited by the size of the population whereas the infinite reproductive numbers are not, the finite-population reproductive numbers diverge from their corresponding infinite population reproductive number as R 0 approaches the size of the population. Where they diverge depends on both the distribution and the coefficient of variation of that distribution; although where the finite-population reproductive numbers depend on these factors, the finite-population reproductive number with CV ¼3 diverges around 1/5 N whereas the homogeneous finite-population reproductive number diverges around 1/2 N. Further, for heterogeneity in intrinsic mixing, the heterogeneous finite-population reproductive numbers are larger than the homogeneous finite-population reproductive number when R 0 is small relative to the size of the population and the heterogeneous finite-population reproductive numbers are smaller than the homogeneous finite-population reproductive number when R 0 is large relative to the size of the population. For gamma distributed heterogeneity, this occurs between 1/3 N and 3/4 N ( Fig. 2(a) ) and at around N for log-normally distributed heterogeneity (Fig. B3) . For the other four types of heterogeneity, the homogeneous finite-population reproductive number is always larger than the heterogeneous finite-population reproductive numbers (Fig. 12) . 11 . The finite-population reproductive numbers, Rt p ðNÞ, versus the basic reproductive number, R 0 for beta distributed (light green) and log-normally distributed (forest green) heterogeneity for CV¼ 2. The population size is N ¼500, R 0 is the solid black line, the homogeneous finite-population reproductive number, RðNÞ, is the dotted black line, and the dot-dashed lines represent heterogeneous finite-population reproductive numbers with different coefficients of variation. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure caption, the reader is referred to the web version of this paper.) Although the results are fairly robust to the distribution, the finitepopulation reproductive numbers with log-normally and logitnormally distributed heterogeneity are larger than the finitepopulation reproductive numbers with gamma and beta distributed heterogeneity, respectively, for the biologically relevant parameter range.
