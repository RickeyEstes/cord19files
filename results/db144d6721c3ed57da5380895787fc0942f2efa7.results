This section contains the major results of our investigation of the structural features of the inter-organizational networks. To form our desired skeletal network, we extracted pairs of academically close institutes based on portfolio similarities among their participants using the construction algorithm of the Maximum Spanning Tree (MST). The results obtained from the backbone networks are related to structural controllability. In order to address the evolution of inter-organizational research, we assessed the structural features of temporal MSTs. Figs. 2-4 show tree-like structures of institutions over time. Each node represents a sub-organization, and its size is proportional to the total number of documents published. The colors filling the nodes were determined by the discipline in which the institute was found to be most productive. The portfolio similarities between pairs of linked institutes represented the weight on the network, and these weights affected the width of links as well. The descriptive statistics of portfolio similarity summarize and describe the distribution of the skeletal relationships between subordinates, as listed in Table 1 . For all institutions, we found that the distributions were biased toward high similarities between research portfolios. For the NLs networks in the US, the overall greater averages and smaller standard deviations of portfolio similarities than the other two institutions indicated that most research units were seen as connected, with the smallest difference in their research areas. On the other hand, in case of the GRIs, the lowest values of average similarity signified that each unit had a distinct research portfolio. The largest standard deviation and the low values of kurtosis for most time periods also showed that their research similarities were the most widely distributed. In order to represent the dynamic characteristics of MSTs, their structural properties are listed in Table 2 . The number of nodes N increased and, accordingly, the number of links increased to N âˆ’ 1 following the definition of an MST in the context of a connected network. In spite of sparsity of the network, nodes having a relatively large number of links could be found in some institutions, in particular the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) within the NLs, which was connected to approximately a quarter of the other organizations for four time periods, and the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) and the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), which appeared as a maximally connected node in each half of the dataset. However, there was stiff competition among institutes with the maximum number of connections in the MPG. We noted that network density (2/N) could be obtained from the number of nodes, and the transitivity always reduced to zero because MST rules out cycles. We calculated a periodical change of structural efficiency, and then examined the relations between network efficiency and structural properties. Following this, we investigated the features of estimated driver nodes in terms of degree and period of appearance. Note that although the number of driver nodes is theoretically fixed in a network, there can be multiple sets of drivers (Jia and Barabasi, 2013) . We randomly selected a set where multiple driver sets existed. As an indicator of network efficiency obtained from structural controllability, Fig. 5 denotes the share of driver nodes over time. According to the graph in the figure, the proportion of drivers varied, but institutions did not have to consider all their agencies for network-wide transformation. Less than 30% of nodes were selected as suitable points at which to inject external information in all three institutions because the maximum value of structural efficiency in the entire datasets was about 30% at the second period (1998) (1999) (2000) in the GRIs. In particular, the NLs could be influenced with a relatively small share of drivers among the institutions at all times, which the exception of the period 2004-2006, whereas in the GRIs, the largest portion of nodes mostly needed to initiate changes. The efficiency fluctuation of the MPG was more stable than other two institutions over time periods. An understating of drivers enables administrators to take preemptive action to prevent information isolation, like the knowledge of the relation between the share of drivers and network efficiency can help plan structural development. The total number of driver appearances for the entire period corresponded to 13, 25, and 53 for the NLs, the GRIs, and MPG, respectively but 6, 15, and 31 agencies were selected as drivers. This was an evidence for the existence of memory in the drivers. Moreover, Figs. 6 and 7 capture some features of the drivers. Fig. 6 compares the average number of links between drivers and the entire nodes over different periods. Despite the common knowledge that nodes possessing large connectivity are influential, our results showed that drivers with low connectivity tended to determine collective agreement on the network. Fig. 7 shows the average durations of appearance by institutional drivers. We see that the driver nodes were the ones newly entered to the network based on the average durations. Of the institutions, the research units of the NLs showed a wide difference between drivers and non-drivers.
