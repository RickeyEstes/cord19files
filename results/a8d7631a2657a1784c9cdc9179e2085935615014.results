In the present study, total 372 pig serum samples collected from 9 provinces/municipalities of China were tested for T. gondii, PRRSV, CSFV and PCV-2, respectively. The total seropositive rate of T. gondii was found in 34 (9.14%) out of 372 samples (Table 1) . A total of 186 samples were positive for PRSSV and the positive rate was 50.00%. The positive rates of CSFV and PCV-2 were 37.10% (138/372) and 3.23% (12/372), respectively (Table 1) . Among the 34 T. gondii sero-positive samples, 8 samples were infected with T. gondii alone, while the remaining 26 samples were simultaneously infected with T. gondii and one of the PRSSV, CSFV and PCV-2, or the combination of 3 viruses ( Table 2 ). The co-infection rate of T. gondii with PRSSV, T. gondii with PRSSV and CSFV, T. gondii with PRSSV and PCV-2, T. gondii with CSFV and PCV-2, T. gondii with PRSSV, CSFV and PCV-2 was 1.61% (6/372), 4.03% (15/372), 0.27% (1/372), 0.27% (1/372) and 0.80% (3/372), respectively. Detail results were shown in Table 2 .
