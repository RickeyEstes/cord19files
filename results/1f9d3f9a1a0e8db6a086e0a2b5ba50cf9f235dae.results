The literature search described in Materials and Methods (see also Supplementary Material) resulted in the 8 data sets in Table 1 , each of which provides measures of fitness based on individual growth or paired growth (Sanjuan, et al. 2004; Carrasco, et al. 2007; Domingo-Calap, et al. 2009; Peris, et al. 2010; Jacquier, et al. 2013; Rihn, et al. 2013; Rihn, et al. 2015) . We will refer to these 8 data sets as 8 studies, although they correspond to 7 publications, one of which (Domingo-Calap, et al. 2009 ) reports separate mutant fitness distributions for 2 different phages. Because measures of growth from different studies are not scaled in the same way, we convert fitnesses to within-study quantiles, e.g., the median fitness in a study is assigned a quantile of 0.5, and the fitness at the 95 th percentile is assigned a quantile of 0.95.
