The global electric two-wheeler market To put the emergence of electric two-wheelers into context, we first focus on the market for conventional two-wheelers. By 2012, one billion bicycles (WOM, 2013) and 320 million conventionally-powered two-wheelers were in use worldwide (IEA, 2010) ; the yearly global production has reached 100 million bicycles and 60 million conventionally-powered twowheelers, respectively (Fig. 2) . Asia accounts for 95% of the global powered two-wheeler production and also harbors the largest fleet of two-wheel vehicles (IEA, 2010) . Small two-and three-wheelers with engine displacements of 6125 ccm represent more than 50% of motorized road vehicles in India, China, Thailand, and Vietnam (estimate based on Meszler, 2007; Kamakaté and Gordon, 2009) . Fuelled by economic growth and rising household income, sales of conventionally-powered two-wheelers have been growing in many Asian countries by more than 10% annually in recent decades (Kamakaté and Gordon, 2009 ). In the European Union (EU), 200-250 million bicycles (estimate based on Colibi and Coliped, 2014; Dekker, 2013) and 33 million conventionally-powered two-wheelers were in use by 2011; the yearly sales reached 20 million bicycles (11 million of which were produced domestically; van Schaik, 2013) and 1.5 million conventionally-powered two-wheelers (ACEM, 2013a). Only 1% and 2% of all passenger kilometers are travelled on bicycles and powered two-wheelers (EC, 1999 (EC, , 2012 EU, 2012) , compared to 73% and 15% travelled in cars and by public transport, respectively (EU, 2012). Electric two-wheelers first emerged in China, where yearly production of e-bikes (comprising small bicycle-style e-bikes, as well as larger pedal-equipped e-scooters), reached 10,000-20,000 units in the early 1980s. Low battery performance and high prices initially limited the market penetration at a large scale (Weinert et al., 2007a) . Mid-size e-scooters received subsidies in Taiwan (Weinert et al., 2007a (Weinert et al., , 2007c ) but only reached a 1.3% share in the Taiwanese scooter market by the end of the 1990s (Tso and Chang, 2003; Cherry, 2007) . In China, sales of e-bikes began to grow exponentially in the late 1990s, reaching annual growth rates of 86% (Ji et al., 2012) . By 2005, the Chinese e-bike fleet counted 120 million and outnumbered by far the fleet of 80 million conventionally-powered scooters (Weinert et al., 2007c) . With e-bike sales reaching 28 million units in 2012 (estimate based on Bento, 2012) , China comprises 90% of both, the 31 million e-bikes yearly sold and the 150 million e-bikes used worldwide (Jamerson and Benjamin, 2013) . Factors driving the market penetration of e-bikes in China include (Weinert, 2007; Weinert et al., 2007a Weinert et al., , 2007c Weinert et al., , 2008 Cherry, 2010) : Legislative support: gasoline-powered two-wheelers were banned in 148 Chinese cities in 2006 following air quality concerns; policy intervention made bicycle-style and scooter-style e-bikes compete mostly against public transportation or bicycles; the introduction of performance standards that classify e-bikes as bicycles if these weigh less than 40 kg and have a maximum speed of 20 km h À1 allowed consumers to use e-bikes without a driver's licence and vehicle registration on a designated bicycle infrastructure; performance standards and vehicle legislation were loosely enforced on larger electric two-wheelers. Technological improvement: Between 1990 and 2006, the introduction of valve-regulated lead-acid batteries increased the energy density by 30% and the battery life time by 160%, resulting in larger drive ranges and lower maintenance costs; the introduction of brushless motors and neodymium magnets increased the lifetime, power output, and efficiency of electric motors. Price reduction: E-bike prices declined by one third between 1999 and 2006 (Bento, 2012) driven by technological learning, innovation, economies of scale, and enhancing market competition. Favorable transportation infrastructure: Public transportation appeared often inconvenient, while individual transportation suffered from road congestions. At the same time, a dedicated bicycle infrastructure was available in many cities. Favorable socio-economic and cultural conditions: Decreasing electricity prices and increasing gasoline prices have been accompanied by rising household income and an increasing need for mobility. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 accelerated the mode shift from public transportation to e-bikes, supported by a wide-spread cycling culture.
