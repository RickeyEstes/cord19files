MERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 colocalize in the perinuclear region of the cell. To study whether the transmembrane nsp's of MERS-CoV are able to induce DMV formation, we expressed nsp3 and nsp4 from a CAG promoter (43) either by cotransfection of cells with plasmids encoding individual proteins or by transfection with a single plasmid encoding a self-cleaving nsp3-4 polyprotein fragment ( Fig. 1A ; Table S1 ). Constructs were codon optimized for expression in human cells, potential splice sites were eliminated, and the encoded proteins were equipped with hemagglutinin (HA), myc, or V5 tags at their termini. The constructs were transfected into 293T cells to verify protein expression and processing (Fig. 1B) . The wild-type nsp3-4 polyprotein was fully cleaved into mature nsp3 and nsp4, as was previously described (44) . As a control, a mutant in which the nsp3/nsp4 cleavage site was inactivated (G2739A/G2740A; GGϾAA) (45) was included to generate the noncleaved precursor. Interactions between nsp3 and nsp4 were previously shown to occur for MHV and SARS-CoV (46, 47) , and we assessed whether this was also the case for the corresponding MERS-CoV proteins. To this end, 293T cells were transfected with a construct expressing HA-nsp3-myc or nsp4-V5 or cotransfected with both constructs. Expression products were labeled metabolically with [ 35 S]methionine and [ 35 S]cysteine and subsequently immunoprecipitated with either HA-or V5-specific antibodies (Fig. 1C ). Upon immunoprecipitation with the HA-specific antiserum, nsp4-V5 was brought down when HA-nsp3 was present (left panel). Conversely, when using the V5-specific antibody, HA-nsp3 was coimmunoprecipitated when nsp4-V5 was present (right panel). These findings demonstrated that these two MERS-CoV proteins interact and further supported the notion that this is a common feature of coronaviruses. When using immunofluorescence microscopy, separate expression of nsp3 or nsp4 in HuH-7 cells yielded a reticular labeling pattern, with some more-intense foci in the perinuclear region of the cell, suggesting that-in the absence of the other-either protein localized at least partially to the ER (Fig. 1D ). This reticular pattern (but without the foci) has been described previously upon transient expression of MHV and SARS-CoV nsp4 (34, 48) , whereas full-length SARS-CoV nsp3 was reported to localize to foci similar to those that we observed (42) . When coexpressing MERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 or when expressing the self-cleaving nsp3-4 polyprotein, the reticular pattern was much less pronounced and the two proteins mainly colocalized in foci in the perinuclear region (Fig. 1D , lower panels). This was in agreement with the finding that MERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 interact and suggested that this interaction strongly promotes their recruitment to the foci in the perinuclear region. MERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 are required and sufficient to induce DMV formation. The next step was to determine whether nsp3 and nsp4 could induce the formation of double-membrane structures similar to those observed during infection. As a reference, MERS-CoV-infected HuH-7 cells were analyzed by EM. The membrane structures that were previously described in high-pressure frozen and freeze-substituted Vero cells infected with MERS-CoV (21) were readily apparent at 10 h postinfection (p.i.) in chemically fixed HuH-7 cells ( Fig. 2A) . Numerous DMVs were found (red asterisks), often adjacent to areas containing CM. The DMV interior appeared electron translucent, a difference from cryofixed samples (21) that can likely be attributed to the different sample preparation method, as the contents of CoV-induced DMVs are easily lost upon chemical fixation (22, 24, 28) . Occasionally some smaller circular profiles were observed that seemed similar in size to the spherules recently described for the gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (red arrows) (28) . None of these structures was found in mock-infected control samples (Fig. 2B) . When HuH-7 cells expressed either nsp3 or nsp4, areas containing modified membranes were observed, which likely corresponded to the foci observed in fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1D) . In nsp3-expressing cells (Fig. 2C) , we detected large regions, usually several micrometers in diameter, of disordered membrane bodies (DMBs), which were similar to those previously observed after SARS-CoV nsp3 expression (42) . The membrane structures clustering in these DMBs were reminiscent of the surrounding ER cisternae, with which they were frequently connected, suggesting that DMBs consisted of clustered ER-derived membranes. Upon expression of MERS-CoV nsp4, large clusters of modified single membranes (MSM) were observed (Fig. 2D ), but these structures seemed more irregular than those induced by nsp3 (Fig. 2C) . The expression of SARS-CoV nsp4 did not result in changes in intracellular membrane morphology (42) , in contrast with our present observations following MERS-CoV nsp4 expression. Whether this reflects differences between the experimental setups used or an actual difference between these viral proteins remains to be determined. When MERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 were expressed in the same cell, either by cotransfection or by expression of the self-cleaving nsp3-4 polyprotein, a remarkably different set of membrane structures was observed ( Fig. 2E and F) . A combination of circular double-membrane profiles (red asterisks) and paired membranes (red arrows) was present in both cases, suggesting that the combined expression of MERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 is sufficient to induce DMV formation. There was no apparent difference between the structures resulting from coexpression of nsp3 and nsp4 and those resulting from expression of the self-cleaving nsp3-4 polyprotein ( Fig. 2E and F), but in both cases the circular profiles were significantly smaller than the ones observed in MERS-CoV-infected cells (average diameters of 146 and 148 nm, respectively, versus 252 nm in infection) (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). These membrane modifications were frequently found in all the samples analyzed. In order to further investigate how the frequency of EM-positive cells compared to the transfection efficiency, a quantitative analysis was carried out on samples of cells expressing MERS-CoV nsp3-4. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that approximately 40% of the transfected cells were positive for expression of MERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 (n ϭ 174), while around 19% of the cell sections (n ϭ 288) contained doublemembrane structures. Both DMVs and zippered ER clustered together in all the EM positive cell sections, although at slightly different ratios (see Fig. S2 for a gallery). As the EM analysis was based on one random section per cell (~100 nm thick) that may not always capture the region with membrane modifications, it was not surprising that the fraction of positive cells observed in EM was smaller than that observed in whole cells using light microscopy. The numbers above in fact strongly suggest that the formation of DMVs and zippered ER is induced in most, if not all, cells expressing MERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4. While the circular profiles observed were suggestive of double-membrane vesicle formation, they could also correspond to cross sections of double-membrane tubular structures. To resolve this issue, we obtained 3D reconstructions of these membrane structures using ET ( Fig. 3 ; Movies S1 and S2), which confirmed that genuine DMVs were indeed formed upon expression of either nsp3 plus nsp4 or nsp3-4 of MERS-CoV. The distinctive feature that unambiguously identifies a vesicle in a tomogram is a circular profile that is largest at the vesicle's equator and decreases in diameter when moving up or down from that plane through successive tomographic slices until, if the vesicle is fully contained in the section, it disappears. Indeed, many profiles like this were observed in the tomograms (Fig. 3A , red asterisks; Movies S1 and S2, green dots). We found no openings connecting the DMV interior and the cytosol, similar to what was observed previously upon tomographic analysis of coronavirus-infected cells (19, 28) . The tomograms corroborated the structural similarity between the membrane structures induced by cotransfection with nsp3 and nsp4 constructs and by expression of the self-cleaving nsp3-4 polyprotein. The electron density of the DMV interior seemed similar to that of the surrounding cytoplasm, and in this sense, it was different from that of DMVs in MERS-CoV-infected cells (compare to Fig. 3A ), which is likely due to the absence of other viral proteins and double-stranded RNA. In some cases, DMVs appeared to be contained in a larger double-membrane structure (Fig. 3B , red asterisks). Such structures have not been observed in coronavirus-infected cells. The paired membranes were often continuous with ER cisternae (Fig. 3B ) and resembled the so-called zippered ER that has also been observed in IBV-infected cells (28) , although they have not been documented so far for betacoronavirus-infected cells. These paired membranes may represent an intermediate of DMV biogenesis. Further supporting this explanation, structures in which the zippered ER seemed to transform into a nascent DMV could readily be observed in the tomograms (Fig. 3B , red arrows). We also observed DMV-DMV, DMV-zippered ER, and DMV-ER connections (Fig. 3C , red arrows), whereas completely isolated DMVs were in fact rare. In summary, while the described differences between nsp3-4-expressing and MERS-CoV-infected cells suggest that other viral components may modulate the process of DMV formation and would be required to form the full array of membrane structures observed during infection, our results establish that MERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 are sufficient to trigger all the membrane-remodeling steps required for inducing DMV formation, likely through the transformation of ER membranes into an RVN consisting of DMVs and modified ER. MERS-CoV nsp6 does not alter DMV morphology. The DMVs induced by expression of MERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 largely mimicked those observed during infection.

MERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 Suffice To Induce DMV Formation ® However, the additional RVN elements that have been observed in this and previous studies of coronavirus-infected cells (CM and spherules) were not detected. To investigate whether nsp6, the third transmembrane subunit of the coronavirus replicase, plays a role in their formation or affects DMV formation, we aimed to extend the expressed polyprotein fragment to include nsp5 and nsp6. In addition to PL pro cleaving the nsp3/nsp4 site, this should lead to processing of the nsp4/nsp5 and nsp5/nsp6 junctions by the nsp5-based M pro , an assumption based on sequence conservation and studies performed with other coronaviruses (3), as the kinetics of MERS-CoV polyprotein processing in cell-based assays have not been documented in any detail. Remarkably, however, when the "regular" nsp3-6 polyprotein was expressed, efficient processing of the nsp3/4 site was achieved, but nsp's located downstream of this junction were retained in processing intermediates due to poor cleavage of the nsp4/5 and nsp5/6 junctions, as observed by immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis ( Fig. 4A and B) . This prompted us to design a set of alternative polyprotein constructs to investigate and optimize the proteolytic autoprocessing of the nsp3-6 region (see Table S1 ). Efficient cleavage at all sites was observed only for an engineered polyprotein (nsp3-5-GFP-6) in which green fluorescent protein (GFP) had been inserted between two copies of the nsp5/6 cleavage site (Fig. 4A ). Immunoprecipitation analysis established that this nsp3-5-GFP-6 polyprotein was processed into four separate nsp's and GFP (Fig. 4B) . Consequently, this construct could be used to evaluate the effect of expressing nsp6 in addition to nsp3 and nsp4. When HuH-7 cells expressed the "regular" nsp3-6 polyprotein, which was barely cleaved at the nsp5/6 junction (Fig. 4B) , we no longer detected the DMVs previously observed upon nsp3-4 expression. Instead, large areas of highly organized and curved membrane structures were seen (Fig. 4C) , which were connected to surrounding ER cisternae (Fig. 4C, red arrows) . In contrast to the large single-membrane clusters observed in nsp3-or nsp4-expressing cells (Fig. 2C and D) , they consisted of double membranes (Fig. 4C , black arrow in the inset). The geometric pattern in these large areas containing double-membrane structures is typical of cubic membranes (49) , which can result from overexpression and/or misfolding of ER proteins, leading to protein and membrane aggregation. In contrast, when HuH-7 cells expressed the engineered nsp3-5-GFP-6 polyprotein, which was almost fully processed (see above), cubic membranes were not observed and we found instead putative DMVs together with zippered ER (Fig. 4D) , structures very similar to the ones found in cells expressing just nsp3 and nsp4 (compare with Fig. 2E and F) . Also, the average size of these DMVs (146 nm) was comparable to that of DMVs induced by nsp3-4 expression (148 nm) (Fig. S1 ). Circular profiles (putative DMVs) were detected in 33 out of 642 cell sections analyzed; however, none of these regions contained CM or spherules. This suggests that, while nsp3 and nsp4 are necessary and sufficient to induce the rearrangement of intracellular membranes into DMVs, the presence of (cleaved) nsp6 does not suffice to trigger the formation of the additional membrane structures typical of MERS-CoV infection. Other viral components that are present during MERS-CoV replication, such as viral RNA or other viral proteins, might thus be required for the formation of convoluted membranes and spherules. Cleavage of the MERS-CoV nsp3/nsp4 junction is essential for DMV formation. To gain more insight into the biogenesis of coronavirus DMVs, we set out to determine the role of the nsp3/nsp4 cleavage event. We surmised that the membrane modifications induced by an uncleaved nsp3-4 polyprotein could differ from those triggered by the (cleaved or coexpressed) nsp3 and nsp4 subunits. We transfected HuH-7 cells with plasmids encoding nsp3-4 carrying either a mutated nsp3/nsp4 cleavage site (GGϾAA) or a catalytic site mutation in the nsp3 PL pro domain (C1592A) that inactivates the protease (50) . In both cases, only the uncleaved nsp3-4 precursor was observed (Fig. 5A) . Interestingly, DMVs were no longer found and instead we detected concentric structures consisting of zippered ER that mostly lacked the pronounced curvature present in DMVs ( Fig. 5B and C) . Cotransfection of the cells with a plasmid encoding the active PL pro domain restored the nsp3/nsp4 cleavage in the nsp3-4 C1592A mutant polyprotein but not in the nsp3-4 polyprotein with the mutated cleavage site (Fig. 5A) . Accordingly, expression of PL pro together with the nsp3-4 cleavage site mutant (Fig. 5D ) did not alter the structures observed. In contrast, when transcleavage of the nsp3/nsp4 site, by coexpression of PL pro with the nsp3-4 C1592A polyprotein, was achieved, DMV formation was at least partially restored and resulted in a mixture of abundant DMV and zippered ER profiles (Fig. 5E ), as observed before (Fig. 2E and F) . Expression of PL pro by itself did not have a membrane-remodeling effect. These results clearly showed that the nsp3-4 precursor is able to induce the membrane pairing required to form zippered ER but that cleavage of the nsp3/nsp4 junction is essential for the formation of DMVs. SARS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 are also sufficient to induce DMV formation. Recently, Angelini et al. reported that, in the case of SARS-CoV, nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 are all required for the formation of DMVs when these proteins are transiently expressed as individual subunits (42) . In their two-dimensional (2D) imaging study, coexpression of SARS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4, in the absence of nsp6, led to the formation of so-called maze-like bodies (MLBs), large clusters of double-membrane structures that were interpreted as closely packed double-membrane tubules, not vesicles. Since our MERS-CoV tomography data (Fig. 3) established that DMV formation can be triggered just by coexpression of nsp3 and nsp4, the interpretation of Angelini et al. suggested that these subunits of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV differ in their ability to induce DMV formation in the absence of nsp6. To address this issue, we coexpressed nsp3 and nsp4 of either virus, using the same experimental setup previously used for SARS-CoV by Angelini et al. (293T cells trans-fected using lipofection), and employed ET for a comparative analysis in 3D. Coexpression of SARS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 led to the formation of MLBs very similar to those observed by Angelini et al. (42) , with areas of zippered ER, often clustered as regularly spaced profiles, and circular double-membrane profiles ( Fig. 6A and B) . The latter were postulated to be cross sections of double-walled tubules, of which the regularly spaced zippered ER profiles would then represent longitudinal sections (42) . The fact that the spacing between clustered zippered ER profiles roughly coincided with the diameter of the circular profiles supported this interpretation; however, Angelini et al. also acknowledged that ET would be required for its validation. To determine whether the circular profiles in the MLBs represented tubular or vesicular structures, we now used ET to analyze several MLBs, two of which are shown in Fig. 6A and B. In one of those images, zippered ER is the dominant structure ( Fig. 6A; Movie S3) , whereas the other mainly contained circular double-membrane profiles ( Fig. 6B; Movie S4) . In both tomograms, we could detect multiple double-membrane profiles that increase and decrease in diameter when progressing through the tomogram and ultimately disappear (marked with green dots in the tomogram movies), indicating that they represent vesicles rather than tubules. In fact, no tubular structures were observed in the tomograms. The presumed longitudinal views of tubular structures turned out to consist of zippered ER winding through the MLB. For MERS-CoV, coexpression of nsp3 and nsp4 in 293T cells led to the formation of numerous circular double-membrane profiles together with some zippered ER (Fig. 6C  and D) , which strongly resembled what we had observed in HuH-7 cells previously. Taken together, our ET results make it clear that, in the case of SARS-CoV as well, coexpression of nsp3 and nsp4 suffices for the induction of DMV formation and strongly suggest that this is a common feature among betacoronaviruses.
