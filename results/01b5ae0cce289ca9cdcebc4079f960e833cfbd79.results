In our study, a total of 81 full-length genomic RNA sequences of animal viruses were analyzed for the presence of potential H-type pseudoknots. To facilitate the analysis of such a large number of full-length sequences, in house-developed computer program is used, which is capable of identifying H-type pseudoknots efficiently and reliably. In brief, the program identifies pseudoknots by scanning through the input RNA sequence and testing every possible combination of stem and loop (S1, S2, L1, L2, and L3) lengths within the predefined ranges to see whether two helical stems can form simultaneously in a linear sequential topology as shown in Figure 1 (a). This approach ensures that no potential pseudoknots with stem and loop lengths that fall within the predefined ranges would escape from being detected. In our pseudoknot search, we set the default ranges for stem and loop lengths as follows: stem1 (S1) and stem2 (S2) both have from 5 to 20 base pairs, loop1 (L1) has from 1 to 10 nucleotides, loop2 (L2) has from 3 to 50 nucleotides, and loop3 (L3) has from 0 (L3 is absent) to 10 nucleotides. These default ranges are very generous because most established Htype pseudoknots have stem and loop lengths that fall within these ranges. To evaluate the relative strength of the identified pseudoknots in a given viral genomic RNA sequence, the free energy of the two stems for each of the identified pseudoknots was calculated, based on the Turner's nearest-neighbor parameters. The pseudoknots were ranked according to the calculated free energies. For a bioinformatic investigation, this calculated free energy represents the best way to evaluate the relative stabilities of the putative H-type pseudoknots within a given viral genome. The free energy value is also used as a criterion for the search; only those pseudoknots with a free energy value lower than −18 kcal/mol are kept for further analysis. In a typical search, tens of potential pseudoknots were identified within the full-lengths genomic viral mRNAs. For example, in the full-length genomic RNA of simian retroviruses type-1 (SRV-1, accession number M11841) that has 8173 nucleotides, 50 potential pseudoknots were identified using the default stem and loop ranges for pseudoknot formation. Some of these potential pseudoknots have overlapped pseudoknot-forming sequences; that is, two or more potential pseudoknots are mutually excluded and cannot exit at the same time. After eliminating overlapped pseudoknots with higher free energy, the number of potential pseudoknots in the SRV-1 genomic mRNA decreases to 31. Of course, it is possible that some of the detected pseudoknots may not really exist. Among the 31 detected pseudoknots, the established −1 frameshift stimulating pseudoknot at the gag-pro junction [25, 43] is identified as the most stable pseudoknot as BioMed Research International 5 judged by the lowest calculated free energy of −33.7 kcal/mol (Table 1) . While pseudoknots were detected shortly downstream from the frame-shift or read-through sites in most of the viral sequences using the default ranges of stem and loop lengths, the default search did miss some known cases, such as the frameshift stimulator pseudoknot in human coronavirus 229E that has a 164 nt L2. For such cases, the ranges of stem and loop lengths were increased accordingly for another round of search. At the end, possible pseudoknots were identified shortly downstream from the frame-shift or read-through sites in 69 full-length viral genomic mRNA sequences (85% of the 81 sequences). Table 1 lists information related to the detected frameshift-or readthroughstimulating pseudoknots. This table does not include those viral mRNAs in which no pseudoknot was identified downstream from the slippery sequence. In Table 1 , the viruses are grouped into different families and listed in the particular orders as in the ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) 2011 Master Species List (MSL) version 2. As documented in Recode V2.0: database of translational recoding events [42] , a large number of viruses are known or expected to use a pseudoknot as the stimulator RNA structure for −1 frameshifting or readthrough. All but one (human astrovirus) of these documented pseudoknots are identified by our pseudoknot searching program. The putative frameshift stimulator pseudoknot in human astrovirus as shown in the Recode database has three mismatched pairs in a row within a five-basepair stem2, which explains why it is not detected by our program. Interestingly, the program identifies many potential frameshift stimulating pseudoknots in viruses whose frameshift stimulators are indicated as simple stem-loop structure (or absence of structure) in the Recode database. Below, we briefly describe the results. The Arteriviridae Family. −1 frameshift stimulating pseudoknots identified in this family of viruses are pretty much identical to those shown in the Recode database (see Table 1 for summarized information of the pseudoknots and Figure 2 for schematic drawings of representative pseudoknots from various virus families). The involvement of the LV and LDV pseudoknots in efficient frameshifting was established [44, 45] . The pseudoknots in EAV, LV, LDV, and PRRSV are comparable to each other in terms of the lengths of the spacer region, S1, S2, L1, and L3, and the calculated stem free energies. The lengths of L2 are more varied. The length of L2 in EAV (68 nt) is substantially longer than those in other viruses of this family. Interestingly, we find that this L2 sequence harbours a potential pseudoknot with 31 nt (Figure 2 ). This pseudoknot seems very credible because it is very similar to the structurally well characterized T2 bacteriophage gene 32 mRNA autoregulatory pseudoknot [46] and the SRV-1 gagpro frameshift stimulating pseudoknot [24, 25] . Moreover, this potential pseudoknot, when placed in an "up-side-down" orientation, stacks just right on top of the stem1 of the frameshifting pseudoknot. Stacking of the four stem regions of the two pseudoknots creates a quasi-continuous double helix of 28 basepairs in length. The slippery sequence in EAV (G UUA AAC) is somewhat deviated from the consensus slippery sequence of X XXY YYZ found in most other viruses. Whether the elaborate arrangement of pseudoknots in EAV plays any role in regulating frameshifting efficiency, and if it does, whether it is related to the "atypical" slippery sequence, await further investigations. All of the frameshift stimulating pseudoknots in EAV, LV, LDV, and PRRSV rank first among all of the potential pseudoknots identified within the fulllength genomic RNAs. The other virus of the Arteriviridae family, simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), also has a potential frameshift stimulating pseudoknot, which seems to be different from those pseudoknots in EAV, LV, LDV, and PRRSV. The potential frameshift stimulating pseudoknot in SHFV ranks 78th among all of the potential pseudoknots identified within the full-length genomic RNAs. The first ranked potential pseudoknot has a calculated stem free energy of −31.7 kcal/mol. The Coronaviridae Family. PRF stimulating pseudoknots identified in this family of viruses at the ORF1a and ORF1b overlapping region are basically the same as those shown in the Recode database and a number of previous studies [18, 22, [47] [48] [49] [50] . Most of these pseudoknots have comparable stems and loops (see Figure 2 for the IBV pseudoknot as a representative). All but one of these pseudoknots rank first in terms of calculated stem free energy among all of the potential pseudoknots identified within the full-length genomic RNAs. The HCV229E frameshifting pseudoknot has a long (164 nt) L2. It was found that a short stretch of nucleotides at the 3 -end of L2 participated in the formation of an extra helical stem required for efficient frameshifting in HCV229E [49] . The extra stem has the potential to stack on stem S2 of the pseudoknot. The established frameshift stimulator pseudoknot in SARS also has an elaborated three stemmed structure [17, 18] . The 5 -end sequence of L2 has the potential to form a stem-loop structure. The extra stem has the potential to stack on stem S1 of the pseudoknot. The frameshift stimulator pseudoknot in PEDV is different from those pseudoknots in other viruses of this family. Most noticeably, the length of S1 is much shorter (5 bp versus 11-14 bp). Correspondingly, the pseudoknots are less stable. It ranks beyond 100th among all the potential pseudoknots within the gemones. The 1st ranked putative pseudoknot in this virus has a calculated free energy of −38.7 kcal/mol. The Astroviridae Family. There are five astroviruses (human, ovine, mink, turkey and chicken astroviruses) in the Recode database. All viruses use the same slippery sequence A AAA AAC. According to the Recode database, human astrovirus and chicken astrovirus use a pseudoknot and a stem-loop as the frameshift stimulator, respectively, while there is no information on the other three viruses. However, we detected potential pseudoknots 6-8 nt downstream from the slippery sequences in ovine, turkey and chicken astroviruses. The detected pseudoknots have comparable stem and loop lengths, as well as stem free energies. They rank 2nd, 10th, SS or RT: slippery sequence or readthrough of stop codon; sp: length of the spacer sequence between the slippery sequence/stop codon and the downstream pseudoknot; S1, S2, L1, L2, and L3: lengths of the sequence elements of the pseudoknot, stem1, stem2, loop1, loop2, and loop3. See Figure 1 for the sequence elements of a typical pseudoknot. Calculated free energy of the stem regions of the pseudoknot is listed in the column "Δ " in minus kcal/mol. "Rank" indicates the relative ranking (according to the calculated free energy of the stems) of the frameshift/readthrough stimulating pseudoknots among all possible pseudoknots detected within the full-length genomic RNAs. "CPK1" indicates whether the pseudoknot belongs to the CPK1 family. and 16th among all the potential pseudoknots within the gemones. The Flaviviridae Family. Pseudoknots detected in this family are identical to those documented in the Recode database. Two slippery sequences are used by these viruses: C CCU UUU and U CCU UUU. The pseudoknots are very similar to each other in terms of the lengths of the stems & loops and stability. In all but one of the viruses, the putative frameshift stimulating pseudoknot rank 1st among all potential pseudoknots within the genome. The frameshift stimulating pseudoknot in Murray Valley encephalitis virus ranks 2nd. The 1st ranked pseudoknot has a calculated stem free energy of −38.9 kcal/mol, which is slightly lower than the frameshift stimulating pseudoknot. The Retroviridae Family. Viruses in the retroviridae family belong to several genera: alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-, or epsilon-retroviruses and lentivirus. These retroviruses utilize three different mechanisms to express their gag, pro and pol genes from a single gag-pro-pol translational unit: (1) inframe readthrough of the gag termination codon (gammaand epsilon-retroviruses); (2) single frameshift event at the gag-pol junction to express the pol gene (alpharetrovirus and lentivirus); (3) double frameshift events at the gag-pro and pro-pol junctions to express the pro and pol genes (beta-and delta-retroviruses). The two alpharetroviruses Avian leukosis virus (ALV) and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) have very similar sequences at the gag-pol frameshift junction and both have a pseudoknot. The pseudoknot in RSV as a frameshift stimulator has been established [51] . The ALV and RSV pseudoknots contain a very long L3 (52 nt) which is much longer than those in most other known frameshift stimulator pseudoknots. Due to the unusual length of L3 (not within the default range), the ALV and RSV frameshift stimulator pseudoknots initially were not detected. They were detected after we increased the upper limit for L3 to 60 nt. Both pseudoknots ranked 1st among all possible pseudoknots within the viral genomes. The RSV and ALV pseudoknots as shown in Table 1 leave only one nucleotide in the spacer, which is too short to position the slippery sequence at the active site of the ribosome while leaving the pseudoknot at the entrance of the mRNA tunnel based on model building studies [13, 52] . However, this problem can be solved easily by breaking an appropriate number of base-pairs within stem1 adjacent to the spacer. Many betaretroviruses were investigated (JSRV to mIAP in Table 1 ). All of the viruses in this group rely on double frameshifting mechanism to express their pro and pol genes.  HTLV-I (gag-pro) Table 1 shows the detected pseudoknots associated with gagpro frameshifting (potential pro-pol frameshift stimulator pseudoknots are not listed in Table 1 ). Most of these pseudoknots are identical to those previously reported and shown in the Recode database. These pseudoknots are comparable to each other in terms of the lengths of the stems and loops. They are all very compact pseudoknots with less than 35 nt. L3 is absent in all but one (MMTV) of the pseudoknots. All pseudoknots ranked 1st among all possible pseudoknots within the viral genomes (using the default ranges of stem and loop lengths in the search).
