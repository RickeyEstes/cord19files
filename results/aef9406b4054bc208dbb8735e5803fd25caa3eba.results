The study data was comprised of 10 hospitalized patients diagnosed with pneumococcal meningitis, 53 hospitalized patients diagnosed with pneumonia, 67 patients diagnosed with AOM treated in an outpatient setting, 2 patients who received ventilation tube insertion, and 1 patient who developed hearing loss due to AOM. Of the patients diagnosed with pneumococcal meningitis, 60% were boys and the median (Q1-Q3) age was 28.87 months (7. For two cases who received ventilation tube insertion due to AOM, costs were calculated separately. Accordingly, the median (Q1-Q3) values for direct and indirect costs were €351.33 (€197.24-€505.41) and €441.31 (€406.89-€475.73), respectively and the median (Q1-Q3) value of the total cost was €792.63 (€672.97-€912.30). For one patient who developed hearing loss as a complication of AOM, the direct and indirect costs were €32.41 and €310,411.89, respectively and the total cost was €310,444.30. The resulting national economic burden is approximately 1 million Euros (direct cost: approximately 0.8 million Euros) for pneumococcal meningitis, approximately 209 million Euros (direct cost: approximately 120 million Euros) for pneumonia, and approximately 293 million Euros (direct cost: Comparison between age groups revealed that medication cost (p D 0.047), indirect cost (p D 0.032), and total cost (p D 0.011) were significantly higher in pneumonia patients aged 36 months than those aged <36 months (Table 2 ). Direct cost of AOM was significantly higher in the patients aged <36 months than those aged 36 months (p D 0.049). On the other hand, comparison of costs between genders revealed no difference between the groups (Table 3 ).
