Two sets of reverse transcription and PCR primers were selected from all available RSVA and RSVB genomic sequence data based on frequency, location, and predicted PCR function (see Table 1 for further details). The general pattern of primer sites and the locations of primer targets in RSVA and RSVB genomes are shown in Fig. 1A . Actual PCR results are shown in Fig. 1B for RSVA and RSVB samples, with PCR products of the expected size obtained for all 6 amplicons. These primers were used as part of a deepsequencing process for RSV combining the full cDNA preparation and genome amplification, deep sequencing with Illumina MiSeq, and de novo assembly (Fig. 1C ) to generate 27 complete or nearly complete genomes (11 group A and 16 group B; median length, 14,990 nt; range, 14,666 to 15,232 nt). An additional number of samples yielded RSV contigs of Ï¾5,000 nt in length, and these were also retained for further analysis. A summary of the genomic sequences in this study is provided in Table 2 . RSV global phylogenetic clustering and placement of Kilifi genomes. The 27 Kilifi genomes were combined with RSVA and RSVB genomes from 16 countries from specimens collected between the years 1981 and 2013 (see Materials and Methods). The phylogenetic clustering is shown in Fig. 2A (RSVA) and B (RSVB). RSVA forms 3 major clades: GA1 (including strains only from the United States), GA5 (with U.S. and global strains), and a clade with both GA2 and the ON1 viruses with a 72-nucleotide duplication in the G ORF (33) , which included nearly all of the new Kilifi RSVA genomes (GA2_ON1). Multiple subclusters showing temporal clustering were detected within each of these clades. Four clades were designated for the RSVB genomes, with BA containing the majority of the Kilifi sequences (Fig. 2B ). Clade Comparison of genomes of viruses with identical G protein ORFs. One motivation for developing full-genome methods was to increase the sensitivity for tracking RSV across short-term transmission chains. We asked if viruses identical in their G gene regions had differences elsewhere in their genomes. All RSV genomes (both GenBank or in the new data presented here) with identical G regions were identified, and the number of changes outside the G region were determined. Of 7 sets of viruses with identical G regions, all showed at least 1 but up to 9 nucleotide differences across the full genome (Fig. 3) . This increased resolu- (Fig. 5) . d Samples yielding sufficient sequence for F region analysis (Fig. 5 ). e The final genome data were deposited in GenBank with the indicated accession numbers. f Short-read data available at European Nucleotide Archive (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena). tion will be important in future studies examining RSV household transmission patterns to identify who acquires infection from whom. Estimation of RSV tMRCA and evolutionary rates. Previous data on RSV evolution are largely derived from the G protein coding region. The full genomes generated in this study were combined with the GenBank reference data set, and these allowed an estimation of the global nucleotide substitution rates and the time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) for all the recently sequenced RSVA and RSVB viruses. These estimates were calcu- lated for the different ORFs and the whole-genome sequences (Fig. 4) . The whole genomes provided more precise estimates of the MRCA, as observed from the interval of lower and upper 95% highest posterior density (HPD) compared to individual ORF data for the same set of viruses (Fig. 4B) . The G protein ORF showed the highest nucleotide substitution rates for both RSVA and RSVB (Fig. 4A) . Elevated changes in G and M2-2 were observed previously using RSV full genomes from U.S. and European cohort data (21) . Similar to the MRCA estimates, the whole-genome estimates for the evolutionary rates showed narrower confidence intervals than those from the individual ORFs. The two regions considered for vaccine targets, G and F, show a strikingly wide difference in rate, and this may be important for selecting conserved vaccine targets. Changes in G and F coding regions, comparing local and global viruses. An important consideration for vaccine development is how representative a vaccine strain is for locally circulating viruses. The transmission patterns of a virus, the evolutionary rate of the virus, and patterns of human movement can strongly influence how quickly global strains reach a rural location. To address this important issue, the amino acid changes encoded by the RSV coding sequences observed in Kilifi were compared to the amino acid changes observed for all known RSV genomes from other parts of the world (Fig. 5; Table 3) . A large percentage of the changes observed in the RSVA G protein were also observed globally, with 88% of the changes seen in Kilifi RSVA G also observed in other parts of the world ( Table  3 ). The Kilifi RSVB viruses appeared to have more local evolution, with only 60% of the observed changes in G shared with global viruses. With reference to the F protein, for Kilifi RSVA viruses, 80% of the observed changes were also found globally, while the Kilifi RSVB viruses showed a higher degree of local evolution, with only 20% of the observed changes specific to Kilifi viruses seen in other locations. To determine if this local evolution of RSVB was observed at other sites, the sequence data were stratified to other locations (the United States, Argentina, and Peru), but no significant local patterns were observed. This suggests that the isolation of the Kilifi site was more pronounced than for other sites. Alternatively, this may reflect more intense sampling of RSVB within a limited area. The RSV envelope proteins are heavily glycosylated. More than 50% of the G protein mass can be carbohydrate (37) , and the potential O-linked glycosylation sites (serine or threonine) comprise up to 30% of the G protein amino acid sequence (38) . Changes toward or away from asparagine can be associated with a change in the overall glycosylation of the protein and could be associated with adaptive change to local immune responses. The G protein is subject to heavy O-linked glycosylation in the variable regions, with modification frequently on serine or threonine residues in the vicinity of a proline residue (Fig. 5A) . Nearly half of the observed changes in the in G protein affect S, T, or P residues (RSVA GA2 37/81 and RSVB 100/241). This is apparent when potential N-and O-linked glycosylation sites are marked on the G protein region (Fig. 5 ) and is also facilitated by the single nucleotide changes that distinguish codons for these three amino acids. In the RSVA G proteins, an N237D polymorphism observed in many of the viruses is within the site NTT and would remove a predicted N-linked glycosylation site. Tan et al. (22) also noted that the RSVA-GA2 group showed a frequent change in two predicted glycosylation sites (N237D and S242N) . Within the RSVB viruses, 3 of 15 amino acid changes involve asparagine, but none of these changes are predicted N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr). Changes in N-linked glycosylation areas are known to effect binding of human convalescent-phase sera to peptides (39) . The RSV F protein contains only 10 to 20% of its mass as carbohydrate, and this is attached exclusively via N-glycosidic bonds (37) . For the RSVA viruses, 5 of the protein changes are to or away from asparagine. In RSVB, 3 changes involve asparagine; however, none of these are within predicted glycosylation sites. Many polymorphisms were observed in the F protein p27 domain (Fig. 5B ). This peptide is likely to serve as a spacer that is freed by cleavage during F maturation and is not found in the mature protein. The large number of changes may simply reflect the disposable nature of this sequence (40) . The NS2 protein may be important in modulating host innate immune responses (41) (42) (43) and may influence movement of infected cells (44) . The NS2 showed an elevated level of evolutionary rate (Fig. 4) , consistent with a protein interacting with polymorphic host target proteins. Monitoring the local versus global protein changes in NS2 revealed multiple changes occurring in the amino-terminal domain and a portion of the domain important for TRAF3 interactions (43) . The majority of changes in the Kilifi RSVA NS2 proteins were also observed in other parts of the world; however, the RSVB NS2 protein showed a significantly high degree of variation only observed in the Kilifi viruses (Fig. 5C ).
