A total of 325 laboratory-confirmed SARS cases were analyzed. Of these, 301 (92.6%) had anti-SARS-CoV IgG detected in sera at the time of sampling (of which 211 cases had convalescent-phase sera collected). Most of the remaining cases had only one serum sample collected within the first few days of illness; 21 had their diagnoses confirmed by RT-PCR of SARS-CoV, and three were confirmed at postmortem. A total of 93 patients had positive RT-PCR results (respiratory specimens: 82.8%, fecal specimens: 17.2%). The median age of the cohort was 37 years (20-96 years), with a male-to-female ratio of 1.4-1. A total of 63 (19.4%) patients had been admitted to the ICU [median age 45 (23-82) years] and 41 (12.6%) patients died (with or without ICU care) [median age 73 (44-96) years]; 239 (73.5%) patients recovered without ICU care. The proportion of patients aged ≥65 years was 19% and 17% in the ICU-admitted patients and those without ICU-admission, respectively. The crude death rates were 3.7% and 54.4% in patients aged <65 and ≥65 years, respectively. Significant co-morbid illnesses (see Table 1 foot notes) were present in 6.3% and 35.1% of cases aged <65 and ≥ 65 years, respectively. A total of 163 (50.2%) patients had required supplemental oxygen at some stage of their illness. High-dose corticosteroid 'rescue' therapy was given to 246 (75.7%) cases, at a mean of 8.6 (95% C.I. 4.8-12.4 days) days from fever onset. The anti-SARS-CoV IgG response profile in our cohort has been reported previously (Chan et al., 2004a) . IgG was first detected on day 4; seroconversion occurred at a median of 16 days (range 4-35 days), and IgG peak levels were reached in the early fourth week of illness. The lowest and highest IgG titres were 40 and 5120, respectively. So far 15 patients' late serum samples collected ≥15 months postinfection all showed positive IgG results [median titre = 320, range 80-640]; and the longest interval observed was 542 days (18 months). Characteristics of patients who seroconverted "early" (day 4-15) were compared to those patients who remained seronegative during the same period, and the results are shown in Table 1 . "Early" seroconversion was observed more frequently among patients who required ICU-admission (χ 2 ; p = 0.011). Although not reaching statistical significance, there was a trend towards a lower proportion of older patients (≥65 years of age) observed to seroconvert early (p = 0.078). Results from logistic regression analysis indicated that ICUadmission was the only factor associated with early seroconversion (p = 0.015). No significant difference in mortality was observed between the early seroconverters and those who remained sero-negative at day 15. The median anti-SARS-CoV IgG levels in convalescentphase sera collected within 30 days were compared among patients with different disease severities and laboratory profiles, and the results are shown in Table 2 . The IgG profiles for patients who had/had not received supplemental oxygen therapy and patients who had/had not been admitted to ICU were illustrated in Fig. 1a and b. Higher IgG levels were detected in patients who had required supplemental oxygen (p = 0.002), ICU-admission (p = 0.001), and had negative pre-discharge fecal RT-PCR results (p = 0.004). Although not reaching statistical significance, there was a trend towards a lower IgG levels detected in cases that were not given high-dose corticosteroid therapy (because of non-progressive/mild diseases). But when the sub-group of patients who received high-dose corticosteroid treatment was analyzed (76% of all cases), higher IgG levels were again detected in patients with more severe diseases (Table 2) . By multivariate analysis, higher IgG level was again shown to be associated with ICU-admission (p = 0.006) or supplemental oxygen therapy (p = 0.008), but not age or corticosteroid treatment (p > 0.05). In the corticosteroid-treated sub-group, absolute lymphopenia <1.0 × 10 9 /L at presentation was also noted to associate with higher IgG titres (p = 0.028). Too few death cases had convalescent sera collected to allow a separate analysis. We further examined the correlation between anti-SARS-CoV IgG titres and LDH levels or lymphocyte counts within the first 30 days of illness. A positive correlation between peak LDH levels and peak IgG titres (Spearman's r = +0.360; p < 0.001), and a negative correlation between initial lymphocyte counts and peak IgG titres (Spearman's r = −0.205; p = 0.004) were noted among survivors without ICU-admission. No correlation was found between IgG titre and nadir lymphocyte counts. ICU: intensive care unit; O 2 -therpay: oxygen supplement required to maintain oxygen saturation >95%; CS: intravenous high-dose corticosteroid (methylprednisolone). a "all": on respiratory and fecal specimens; "fecal": on fecal specimens collected upon discharge at ≥21 days; included only respiratory specimen RT-PCR negative cases. * Statistically significant.
