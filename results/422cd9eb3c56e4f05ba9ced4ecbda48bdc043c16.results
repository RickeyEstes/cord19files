Time-temperature trial qRT-PCR PEDV RNA was detectable at all time and temperature combinations tested, except for two of three samples on day 14 at 70°C. Viral RNA reduction kinetics varied greatly among temperature treatments; however, the rate of reduction peaked after the initial days of temperature treatments above 37°C and then slowed (Table 1 ). This is reflected by the increase in mean quantification cycle (Cq) of the qRT-PCR over time, which corresponds with a reduction in RNA targets in the sample (Fig. 1 ). At 37°C, viral RNA steadily degraded at an average rate of 0.29 log per day throughout the temperature treatment. The amount of viral RNA detected from day 1 to 7 at 37°C was significantly different from all other temperature treatments on those days. At 45°C, viral RNA reduction was more rapid from days 0 to 4 (average 1 log reduction per day) with no mean log change thereafter. The 50°C treatment yielded a mean rate of RNA reduction from days 0 to 2 of 1.87 log of RNA per day, but the remainder of time treatment (2 to 14 days) did not reveal further significant decrease of viral RNA. At 55°C, RNA decreased by 2.91 log during the first day of treatment, 0.68 log during the second day, and remained generally stable from days 2 through 14 with no further significant decrease in RNA. For 60, 65, and 70°C treatments, viral RNA reduction was greatestbetween 3.72 and 3.9 login the first day with no difference (p < .05) among the temperatures. From 1 to 14 days, viral RNA decreased a total of 0.28, 1.42, and 2.44 log at 60, 65, and 70°C, respectively. Despite the similar rapid decrease at day 1, the quantity of viral RNA remaining at day 14 was significantly different among all of these high treatment temperatures.
