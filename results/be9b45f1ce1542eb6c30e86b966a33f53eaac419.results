We first study the model in square lattices with von Neumann neighborhood and periodic boundary conditions. Figure 1 (a) presents the effect of the successful rate of self-protection, d (see Methods section for the description of the model and parameters), on the decision makings of individuals and the epidemic size. Clearly, as the increasing of d, the condition gets better and better (the efficiency of selfprotection gets improved as the increase of d). A counter-intuitive phenomenon is observed when d lies in the middle range (,[0.3, 0.4]), during which a better condition leads to a larger epidemic size. One may think that though the epidemic size becomes larger, the system payoff (the sum payoff of all individuals) could still get higher since individuals pay less in choosing self-protection than vaccination. However, as shown in Fig. 1 (b) and Fig. 1 (c), the system payoff is strongly negatively correlated with the epidemic size. That is to say, a better condition (i.e., a larger d) could result in worse performance in view of both the larger epidemic size and the less system payoff (In Fig. S1 , we report the epidemic size as a function of d in square lattices with different sizes, the simulation results indicate that our main results are insensitive to the network sizes). This is very similar to the so-called Braess's Paradox, which states that adding extra capacity to a network when the moving entities selfishly choose their route, can in some cases reduce overall performance [20] [21] [22] . Figure 2 shows the strategy distribution patterns of four representative cases. When d is small, it is unwise to take self-protection because of its low efficiency, and people prefer to take vaccination or laissez faire. As shown in Fig. 2(b) , there are only two strategies, vaccination and laissez faire, and thus d has no effect on the epidemic size. Meanwhile, one can find that the infected laissez-faire individuals (dark red) and uninfected laissez-faire individuals (light red) are isolated by the vaccinated individuals and form respective percolating clusters. That is to say, the vaccinated individuals play the role of firewall in preventing the contagion of disease to the whole system. Of course, this kind of partial separation can only be possible when the number of vaccinated individuals is considerable, otherwise, the number of vaccinated individuals is insufficient to cut off the spreading paths of the disease. When d gets larger (,[0.3, 0.4]), the advantage of self-protection starts to appear, so more individuals will take self-protection and fewer individuals take vaccination or laissez faire. However, low efficiency of self-protection (i.e., small d) cannot offset the losses coming from the reduced vaccinated individuals, which leads to the increase of the epidemic size (see the dark red points in Fig. 2 (c)) as well as the decrease of the system payoff. Also as shown in Fig. 2(c) , the light-red percolating cluster (i.e., uninfected laissez-faire individuals) is fragmented into pieces due to the decrease of irrelevant individuals (the irrelevant individuals include both vaccinated and successful self-protective individuals, see Methods for the definition), which is also a reason of the decrease of the fraction of laissez-faire individuals: being laissez-faire becomes more risky now. When d is large, the superiority of self-protection becomes more striking and no one takes vaccination, then the epidemic size decreases as d increases. As shown in Fig. 2(d) , only selfprotective and laissez-faire individuals coexist in the lattice. With further increase the value of d, though the self-protection strategy is more efficient, the laissez-faire strategy is more attractive since successful self-protective individuals becomes more and thus for susceptible individuals, the risk of being infected becomes smaller. This is the reason why the fraction of laissez-faire individuals become larger as d goes approaching to 1. In fact, when d is very large, the uninfected laissez-faire individuals again form a percolating cluster since the externality effect from the successful self-protective individuals makes laissez-faire individuals to be free-riders. Please see Previous studies have shown that the contact patterns can dramatically impact the disease dynamics and the individual's decision makings 16, 17 , so it is necessary to further check our results on other types of networks. To this end, we implement the model on disparate networks including the Erdös-Rényi (ER) networks 23 , the Barabási-Albert (BA) networks 24 and the well-mixed networks (also called fully connected networks or complete networks). Figure 3 demonstrates that, in despite of the quantitative difference, the counterintuitive phenomenon can be observed for all kinds of networks. Figures S2-S5 present systematical simulation results about the effects of different parameters for different kinds of networks and one can always observe the counter-intuitive phenomenon when the condition 0 , b , c , 1 is hold. Although the phenomenon is qualitatively universal for different kinds of networks, as shown in Fig. 3 , there are quantitative differences between square lattices and other kinds of networks: (i) in ER, BA and well-mixed networks, the self-protection strategy are further promoted and could become the sole strategy in a certain range of d (Take the case of BA network in Fig. 3 (c) as an example, the selfprotection strategy prevails on the whole network when d lies in the interval , [0.3, 0.7]); (ii) the epidemic size in ER, BA and well-mixed networks is smaller than that in square lattices. In square lattices, laissez-faire individuals could form clusters that are guarded by the surrounding irrelevant individuals (i.e., vaccinated and successful self-protective individuals). Then they paid nothing but can escape from the infection. On the contrary, ER, BA and well-mixed networks do not display localized property and thus to choose laissezfaire strategy is of high risk. Therefore, with delocalization, the laissez-faire strategy is depressed while the self-protection strategy gets promoted and less individuals will get infected. To verify the above inference, we remove a number of edges in the square lattice and randomly add the same number of edges. During this randomizing process, the network connectivity is always guaranteed and the self-connections and multi-connections are not allowed. The number of removed edges, A, can be used to quantify the strength of delocalization. As shown in Fig. 4 , with the increasing of A, the self-protection strategy gets promoted and the clusters of uninfected laissez-faire individuals are fragmented into small pieces. When A gets larger and larger, the strategy distribution pattern becomes closer and closer to that of ER, BA and well-mixed networks. The gradually changing process in Fig. 4 clearly demonstrates that the main reason resulting in the quantitative differences is the structural localization effects. In a word, the ER, BA and well-mixed display essentially the same results since they do not have many localized clusters. Figures 5 and 6 report the degree and width of the Braess's paradox for well-mixed networks 25 (Figures S6, S7 and S8 present the degree and width of the Braess's paradox for the other three kinds of networks under investigation). The degree of the Braess's paradox is defined as D R 5 R max 2 R initial , where R max is the maximal value of epidemic size and R initial is the value of epidemic size when the Braess's paradox starts to happen. Fig. 5(a) presents an illustration about the definition of D R , and Fig. 5(b) plots the value of D R for different parameters. Each subpanel in Fig. 5(b) is associated with a given (l, m) pair with b and c being two variables. Analogously, the width of the Braess's paradox is defined as D d 5 d end 2 d start , where d start is the starting point corresponding to R initial and d end is the right point when the Braess's paradox disappears. Fig. 6(a) present an illustration about the definition of D d . Figure 6 (b) plots the value of D d in the similar way to Fig. 5(b) . The simulation results indicate that when l is very small (e.g., l 5 0.2 in the top panels of Fig. 5(b) and Fig. 6(b) ), the Braess's paradox disappears, and with the increasing of the value of l, the Braess's paradox becomes more obvious. The parameters b and c also affect the existence of Braess's paradox, for instance, when b and c are all close to 1, the Braess's paradox Lastly, we present an approximation analysis based on the meanfield theory for well-mixed networks (see analysis in the Methods section), which could reproduce the counter-intuitive phenomenon. Figure 7 compares the analytical prediction with simulation, indicating a good accordance.
