During the first co-cultivation, PO and PBM cells were observed without any mutual interference. However, already after two subcultures, lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells could no longer be seen microscopically. The newly established cell line PO714 started to show small syncytia typical for BLV replication in the 13th passage. In the 14th passage, cell culture supernatant was investigated for BLV by cELISA. The amount of gp51 and p24 was about 20-30% compared to FLK/BLV. Higher passages (20th-40th passage) showed a higher BLV antigen expression, which was nearly comparable with that of FLK/BLV under the same conditions. As shown in Table 1 , the p24 content in the supernatant was relatively stable for 3 days after passaging for at least 10 subcultivation steps. In addition, Western blot analysis of cell lysates from FLK/BLV and PO714 showed that both cell lines express similar amounts of gp51, p24 and different precursor proteins. Cells of the 20th subculture were shown to express BLV by IFT and EM. Particles with typical retrovirus morphology were detectable in ultrathin sections. Cells and cell culture supernatant of the 63rd and 65th subculture revealed positive PCR results (earlier passages were not tested by PCR assay). The RFLPA products from env amplicons showed a high homology with the Belgian subtype (Fig. 1) . Fur- Fig. 2 . Phylogenetic tree based on env fragment (374 bp) sequence analysis. PO714 derived BLV (accession number AY062265) was compared to sequences from BLV of different geographical origin (Japanese: Sagata et al., 1985; Australian: Coulston et al., 1990; Belgian: Rice et al., 1984 ; FLK/BLV and a cow from Germany of Belgian provirus type: Fechner et al., 1997). thermore, the sequence of the env PCR product (GenBank accession number: AY062265) exhibited a 99.1% homology with the Belgian subtype over the analysed 400 bp (Fig. 2) . All tests for foreign viruses and mycoplasma were negative. An important result of the investigations regarding antigen production was the fact that from one culture, up to four virus harvests were possible without loss of antigen content. In addition, the amount of p24 antigen clearly increased within that time. The content of gp51 antigen did not increase as strongly as that of p24 but showed the same tendency. Furthermore, it is possible to use a wide range of passages of cell line PO714 for BLV antigen production: there were no Table 2 Analysis of BLV antigen prepared from cell line PO714 after the 23rd and 69th subculture by means of AGID using gp51-and p24-specific reference sera  Antigens presented in the table were prepared after the second (23rd subculture) and fourth (69th subculture) harvest of cell culture supernatant, respectively. Serial lg2-dilutions of the antigens were prepared with Tris-NaCl buffer (pH 7.2), and the intensity of the precipitation bands in the agar gel was evaluated using a classification from ++ (strong) to (+) (weak). a Does not contain p24. significant differences between the antigen yields of the 23rd and the 69th subculture (Table 2) . This is valid for p24 as well as for gp51. Comparable results were obtained using maintenance medium with 10 and 5% FCS, respectively. The cell line is stable and produces BLV, so far up to the 100th subculture. AGID antigen prepared from cell line PO714 was compared to antigen from a commercial AGID test kit ( Table 2 ). The precipitation lines of the PO714 antigens were confluent with those of the control antigen showing homology between both preparations. The lines were long, clear and distinct and, thus, offer the same quality as the commercial antigen. On an average, the final titres were slightly lower, which, however, had no influence on the test results. Twenty-seven standard and reference sera were investigated in a first AGID test. They included 11 highly positive, 8 weakly positive and 7 negative sera and the EU standard serum "E4" (1:10). All highly and weakly positive sera were detected in this test, and no false positive results occurred. In the following, 79 sera from field and laboratory animals infected with BLV of different provirus subtypes were tested in parallel with a commercially available test kit and PO714 antigen. The sera had been characterised using up to five commercial ELISA systems and full blood was tested by env nested PCR. Out of these sera, 20 were positive (9 strongly and 11 weakly positive sera), 57 were negative and 2 were doubtful. Both AGID test systems revealed the same results. Furthermore, these serum samples were investigated in gp51-and p24-cELISA tests using cell culture supernatant of FLK/BLV as well as of PO714. Fig. 3 shows representative results of the gp51-cELISA. The sera reacted in the same manner when testing by the p24-assay. Thus, both cell lines are suitable antigen sources for cELISA tests. Most of the sera reacted similarly with both antigens. In a few cases, differences occurred in the strength of the reactions: some sera reacted better with FLK/BLV antigen, but others showed a stronger reaction with PO714 antigen. This should not be important for clearly negative or strongly positive sera, but in particular cases (see sample 2468 in Fig. 3 and Table 3 ), it may result in differences in the positive/negative-grading of the sample. This means that weakly positive sera might be detected by only one of the antigens and, thus, might be missed if tested using only one system. Different reactivities were also seen between FLK/BLV and PO714 antigen in p24 cELISA (data not shown).
