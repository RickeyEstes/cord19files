In a first experiment, a dilution series of a batch of Poulvac ® IB primer was prepared according to routine production QC procedures. The dilution series ranged from 10 −4 to 10 −9 . All dilutions were tested for presence of IB H120 and IB D274 by reverse transciptase PCR. None of the dilutions was positive for IB by PCR, see Table 2 . Apparently, the quantities of virus in the dilutions series were below the detection level. The dilution series was inoculated in embryonated SPF chicken eggs, 6 eggs per dilution. After the routine incubation period samples of the allantoic fluids were tested also by PCR. It now appeared that after the egg passage dilutions up to 10 −6 were positive by PCR for IB D274 and dilutions up to 10 −7 were positive by PCR for IB H120, see Table 2 . The embryos were also examined visually, and the results show that at a dilution of 10 −6 all (5 of 5) embryos were affected by the virus. At a dilution of 10 −7 one of 5 embryos was affected. The only possible explanation for the presence of IB H120 and IB D274 in the allantoic fluids was that the viruses had been able to cause a productive infection in the eggs. It is concluded that in this test live virus titres were determined. In a second experiment a routine titration on Poulvac ® IB primer was performed. This titration was performed in triplicate. After the incubation period the eggs were opened and the embryos were examined visually. Of each triplicate a titre per vial was calculated (see bottom Table 3 under Visual) and from the 3 scores obtained, i.e. 6.83, 6.37 and 6.80 10 log EID 50 respectively, an average titre per vial was calculated, i.e. 6.67 10 log EID 50 or 10 6.67 EID 50 . Analysis of allantoic fluids demonstrated for both strains there were clear endpoints in each triplicate so that a titre could be determined in a correct manner. The average titres determined for both strains were 10 6.31 EID 50 per vial for IB H120 and 10 6.59 EID 50 for IB D274. If the sum of these 2 values is determined the titre is 10 6.77 EID 50 Table 2 Titration of Poulvac IB primer vaccine using strain specific PCR for detection of IB H120 or IB D174.
