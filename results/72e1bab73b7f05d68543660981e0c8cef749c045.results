During our 2-year prospective study, 125 CAP patients with paired sera meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled. There were 66 males (52.8%) and 59 females (47.2%), and the patients' ages ranged from 14 to 85 years (median 47 years) (see Table 1 ). Overall, acute M. pneumoniae infection was diagnosed in 27/125 (21.6%) patients showing a fourfold or greater increase in IgG antibody titer of paired sera. Twenty-three patients had causative pathogens other than M. pneumoniae. Among these patients, one was positive for PIV types 1 and 2, and IFVA; one was positive for IFVA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; one was positive for IFVA and Klebsiella pneumoniae; nine were positive for IFVA; three were positive for adenovirus; three were positive for PIV type 1; one was positive for hMPV; one was positive for HRV; one was positive for PIV type 2; and one was positive for PIV type 3. Patients positive for M. pneumoniae had a median age of 34 years (range 16-77 years), which was significantly younger than M. pneumoniae-negative patients (54.5; range 14-85) years, p = 0.002). M. pneumoniae infections were less likely to have comorbidities (p = 0.039). There was no difference in smoking status between the two groups. A similar distribution of most symptoms were found in both groups on admission, with the exception that the duration of fever before admission was longer in the group with M. pneumoniae infection than in the group without (p = 0.013). The group with M. pneumoniae infection had a higher mean heart rate (p < 0.001). The two groups had a similar pattern of biochemical and haematological findings. There was no difference in use of antibiotics, treatment status or days after onset of the IgM testing between the two groups. The results of IgM testing, FQ-PCR and culture were compared (see Table 2 ). M. pneumoniae positive rates evaluated by IgM antibody testing in acute stage serum (5.6%), FQ-PCR (17.6%) and culture (16%) were lower than the result of paired sera (21.6%). Among the 27 patients positive for M. pneumoniae, only two (7.4%) were found to be positive by IgM antibody testing, 11 by FQ-PCR (40.7%) and 15 by culture (55.6%). For all of the 103 non-M. pneumoniae infections tested by FQ-PCR, hRNP gene had been successfully amplified (data not shown). Among the discordant results, eight patients showed a fourfold or greater increase in IgG titers, but had negative results in all three methods. Fifteen patients were negative by paired sera, while positive by other methods. Among them, four were positive by both FQ-PCR and culture, one was positive by FQ-PCR and IgM test, one was positive by culture and IgM test, six were positive by FQ-PCR, and three were positive by IgM test. When evaluated by the Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS) scoring system [14] , 17 patients positive by paired sera and 40 patients negative by paired sera scored â‰¥ 4. By using paired sera showing a fourfold or greater increase in IgG antibody titer as the "gold standard", diagnostic parameters of the three methods have been evaluated (see Table 3 ), including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV respectively) and positive likelihood ratio (PLR). Specificity and NPV of all three methods were high, around 90% in specificity and around 80% in NPV. A similarly increasing trend of sensitivity, PPV and PLR was lowest in IgM antibody testing (7.4%, 28.6% and 1.45, respectively), intermediate in FQ-PCR (40.7%, 50% and 3.63, respectively), and highest in culture (55.6%, 75% and 10.9, respectively).
