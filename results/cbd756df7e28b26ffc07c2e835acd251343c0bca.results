The results of our analysis are summarized in Fig. 6 ; numerical estimates are presented in the Appendix. Overall, we find that providing information about the municipal government's efforts to combat disease has no effect on intended vote for the incumbent mayor, regardless of whether the municipality had an above-or below-median score on our measure of performance. Our estimates are insignificant, and the point estimates are very close to zero. Among respondents who have a child under 9 months or are planning to have one in the next several years, we find similarly null results, despite this group's greater self-interest in disease prevention. However, among respondents who know someone in the community with a child affected by microcephaly or Zika, we find that negative information about combatting mosquito-borne illnesses has a large, negative, and statistically significant effect on intended vote for the incumbent (Ã€37.7 percentage points). For this group, as with the others, positive information about government performance has no significant effect on intended vote for the mayor. We also examined whether the significant treatment effect among those with a personal connection to microcephaly is replicated more broadly in municipalities with a high incidence of congenital Zika syndrome, even among those who do not personally know someone affected by the disease. For example, local media coverage might highlight cases of microcephaly in a particular town, boosting the salience of the disease and perception of risk for all residents. To test this hypothesis, we obtained data from Brazil's Ministry of Health on the number of cases of congenital Zika syndrome in each municipality of Pernambuco from the start of the outbreak through July 1, 2016, when our survey went to the field. As shown in the Appendix, when we subset on poor performing municipalities and interact our treatment indicator with the logged incidence of congenital Zika syndrome, estimated conditional effects are in the expected direction but insignificant. These findings suggest that only a personal connection to microcephaly can prompt voters to sanction politicians for sub-par effort in combatting mosquito-borne illnesses.
