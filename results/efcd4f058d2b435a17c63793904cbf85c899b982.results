Data were collected from 149 outbreaks in five hospitals between November 2007 and November 2011. These outbreaks affected 1694 patients and 456 staff. The average duration of the outbreaks, determined as the first date of onset to the last date of onset, was 8.9 days (median 8; range 1-40 days). Outbreaks affected an average of 11.4 patients (median 11; range 1-30) and an average of 3.2 staff (median 2; range 0-20). Data from these outbreaks gave a mean serial interval of 1.86 days. Figure 1 shows the distribution of serial intervals from the observed data and the nearest fitting γ distribution. The spatial modelling analysis used data from 65 outbreaks where all data (for both onset dates and position in ward when taken ill) were complete. The outbreak characteristics were similar in these 65 outbreaks compared to the full dataset. The corresponding figures for these outbreaks were: average length of outbreak 9.5 days (median 8 days) average number of patients 11.9 (median 11) average number of affected staff 3.4 (median 2). The outbreaks affected various ward types, with most occurring in general medical wards (34%) and care of the elderly wards (28%). Other specialties were respiratory medicine (12%), stroke/neurology wards (11%), coronary care wards (9%) and orthopaedic/trauma wards (6%). Figure 2 shows the observed proximity metric and the distribution of proximity metrics obtained under the assumption that proximity was not associated with transmission (from the simulated permutations). This shows how the proximity metrics observed relate to the distribution of proximity metrics if proximity was not important. The dashed line indicates the observed proximity metric (P) and the bars indicate the distribution of proximity metrics from the simulated permutations. For the model using the serial interval taken from the observed onset dates, the observed metric is outside of the range of the simulated distributions and is highly statistically significant ( p=153.34, p<0.001). With serial intervals of less than 2 days proximity is either outside or at the extreme right of the simulated proximity metrics and the p values ranged from <0.001 for serial intervals of 0.5 days to 0.01 at a serial interval of 2 days. If we increase the assumed serial interval, the proximity metric moves to within the range expected from the simulated values, and at 3 days the p value was 0.2 (figure 2). Using the γ probability distribution derived from a community outbreak by Heijne et al 13 (mean serial interval 3.06 days), the proportion of observed proximity values fell within the range that would be expected if proximity were not important.
