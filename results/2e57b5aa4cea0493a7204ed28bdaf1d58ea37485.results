A core group was identified from the Emergency Department, Primary Care, the dedicated Isolation Unit, and the Hemodialysis Unit. The education program consisted of four skill-days consisting of one hour rolling sessions. The program was then extended to other wards and units who may admit or take care of MERS-CoV patients. Nurses were assigned a pre-course work from Mosby's Nursing Skills, an online skill module, donning and doffing of PPE, and the process for obtaining a nasopharyngeal swab. The skill lab incorporated multiple methods such as demonstration, group discussion, watching an on-line video obtained from the New England Journal of Medicine [18] , and a simulated demonstration and practice on a mannequin (Table 1) . Nurses were re-orientated to the correct process of donning and doffing PPE including N95 mask through a demonstration process. The nurses were then shown a video developed by the New England Journal of Medicine entitled: Procedure âˆ’ Collection of Nasopharyngeal Specimens with the Swab Technique [18] . Each nurse joined a skills table where a nurse educator simulated the procedure, using a mannequin, to obtain a nasopharyngeal swab (Fig. 1) . Special consideration was given to the position of the patient, the depth the swab was to be placed and the length of time the swab was to be in contact with the mucosal surface. The procedure was practiced until all nurses were comfortable with the process. The skills lab also addressed specific requirements outlined by the Prevention and Control of Infection Committee, the hospital Laboratory and the Ministry of Health including the necessary forms (Fig. 2) , transportation of the specimens to the Laboratory and the notification requirements. The reporting forms were revised by the educators to ensure all required components were documented. The process for notifying the hospital Epidemiology and the Ministry of Health was updated Competency assessment continued in the clinical care area over the following weeks where the nurse educators observed nurses in practice, and provided ongoing support and guidance when required. Competent nurses were then in a position to advise other healthcare providers on the PPE standards that are necessary when caring for patients suspected or confirmed to have MERS CoV. Over 450 nurses attended the Nasopharyngeal Skill Day. Twenty five nurse educators provided individual training for nurses who were unable to attend. In total over 1000 nurses received training and continue to receive support and guidance to ensure safe and effective practice is maintained. Donning and doffing PPE and N95 mask fit testing has also become an annual mandatory competency requirement for staff in nursing and other clinical services to maintain standards and contribute towards staff safety in the management of patients with actual or suspected MERS CoV.
