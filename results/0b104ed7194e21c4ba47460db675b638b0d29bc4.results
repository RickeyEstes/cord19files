Precision and accuracy of the extraction and quantification method. An 8-point calibration line was generated for [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 in human plasma (r 2 = 0.99, data not shown), with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 1 ng/ml. The relative errors (% RE) for all calibration standards were less than 20% at the LLOQ and below 15% at other levels, conforming with typical bioanalytical method validation guidelines 29 . The precision and accuracy of the QC samples showed that the method was robust and accurate. The LLOQ samples returned a coefficient of variation (%CV) of 8.0 and %RE of 15.5, whilst the other QC levels had %CV's below 6.1 and %RE's below 8.4. Representative chromatograms obtained from calibration standards 1 and 8 are shown in Fig. 1 . obtained before infusion of [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13, no chromatographic peak was observed for the peptide ( Fig. 2A,B) . Samples obtained at the end of the infusion (t = 120 minutes) showed strong peaks at 3.68 minutes corresponding to [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (Fig. 2C,D) . The measured concentration of [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 in these samples after 120 minutes was 58.3 Â± 10.5 ng/ml. Additionally, data from the six donor control samples that did not receive [Pyr 1 ] apelin infusion showed that the endogenous levels of [Pyr 1 ]apelin in these samples were below the LLOQ (see Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The peak height obtained from the chromatogram of these donor samples had a maximum height that was 19.8% of that seen in the LLOQ and so was considered as blank for quantitative purposes based on the FDA method validation guidelines for demonstrating selectivity of an LC-MS methodology 30 . Identification of potential C-terminal metabolites of [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13. In order to identify potential metabolites of [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 generated during the 120 minutes infusion period, samples were re-analysed using a high resolution mass spectrometer. Full scan LC-MS data were interrogated for potential [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 derived metabolites by comparing extracted ion chromatograms for each analyte in the 0 and 120 minute samples in the Qualbrowser software package (Thermofisher). Peptides that were identified in the 120 minute samples were mainly generated by the loss of C-terminal amino acids (Fig. 3A) . Their relative abundance in the samples are displayed in Fig. 3B . Notably, the most abundant fragments were [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (known to be biologically active 24 ), [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) and [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Other metabolites identified, although at lower levels (<10% of parent [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13) included [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) , [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) and [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) that are likely to be biologically inactive. The chromatographic spectra corresponding to each of these metabolites are shown in Fig. 4A -G. In addition to [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) , the most abundant metabolite identified, [Pyr 1 ] apelin-13 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (Fig. 5) and [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (Fig. 6 ) were present at a sufficient level to generate suitable product ion spectra allowing experimentally acquired fragments to be matched against theoretical fragments from the peptide sequence. The relative mass accuracy of all potential metabolites were generated and the experimental values were all within 1 ppm of expected values, whilst the mass accuracy of the parent peptide had the highest value of 1.3 ppm. Oxidation of the methionine residue in [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 was identified, however since this modification was also observed in the extracted standards, it could not be ascertained if they occurred in vivo or as an artefact of the extraction process. Identification of potential N-terminal metabolites of [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13. Using the same approach described above, several N-terminal metabolites of [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 were identified (Fig. 7 ). Of note, the peak areas of these fragments were lower compared to those observed for the C-terminal fragments. The most abundant N-terminal fragments observed were [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) , [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (11) (12) (13) , [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) and [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (10) (11) (12) (13) (Fig. 7A ,B). Other fragments present but low in abundance include [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) , [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) and [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . The mass accuracy of the experimentally acquired monoisotopic m/z for these metabolites are shown in Fig. 8 , and were all within 0.9 ppm of expected values.
