N-terminal hydrophobic pocket of gp41 NHR. It is known that, in an HIV-1 6-HB, each CHR helix is half buried in the hydrophobic groove between two adjacent helices of NHR homotrimer, assembling the so-called fusion core. After careful examination of previously reported crystal structures, we noticed that, outside the NHR hydrophobic groove, a solvent exposed hydrophobic pocket is located around the N-terminus of NHR (close to the binding site of CHR Gln653, Fig. S1A ). Since this N-terminal hydrophobic pocket (NTHP) does not lie in the hydrophobic groove, it cannot be covered by canonical CHRs or CHR-derived peptides (Fig. S1A) . The NTHP is majorly composed of four hydrophobic residues, including Leu544 and Ile548 from one NHR helix, and Leu545 and Val549 from an adjacent NHR helix (Fig. S1B ). Amino acid sequence alignment showed that those residues are highly conserved among different HIV-1 strains (Fig. S1C) , implying that this previously undescribed pocket could be a potential target for enhancing the inhibitory potency of CP peptide. with N-terminal hydrophobic pocket (NTHP), we truncated the CHR-derived peptide as Trp628 ~ Gln653, resulting in CP (Fig. 1A) . Then a number of two-or three-residue tails incorporating hydrophobic side chains were rationally designed to fit the shape of NTHP, including Ile-Asp-Leu, Ser-Met and Ser-Trp, leading to peptidic inhibitors CP-IDL, CP-SM and CP-SW, respectively. Subsequently, the four peptides (with or without designed tails), together with T20, were artificially synthesized and subjected to the assessment of their antiviral activities (Fig. 1B,C) . The original CP peptide has low inhibitory activities against HIV-1 clinical strains, 92TH009 (subtype A/E, R5) and 92UG024 (subtype D, X4), with IC 50 of 281.25 nM and 207.79 nM, respectively. As expected, at the presence of artificial C-terminal tails, the inhibitory activities of elongated CPs were raised to different extends, where CP-IDL showed the highest potency with increase of 109-and 55-fold for 92TH009 and 92UG024, respectively. Moreover, the enhanced activities of CP-IDL were stronger than that of T20 by 24-and 12-fold for the two strains. Then we compared the inhibitory activities of CP, CP-IDL and T20 against more HIV-1 isolates, including tire1, 2 and 3 viruses (Table 1) . It showed that CP-IDL could inhibit infection of all those different types of HIV-1 pseudovirus with IC 50 values between 1.21 nM and 74.49 nM, which were much more potent than CP peptide (3.1 fold to 52 fold) or T20 (2.8 fold to 21.6 fold). Then we tested the inhibitory activities of CP, CP-IDL and T20 against T2635 or T20 resistant strains ( Table 2 ). It showed that CP-IDL could inhibit infection of all these resistant strains, which are much more potent than CP or T20. The fact that the anti-HIV-1 potency of CP inhibitor could be remarkably improved by a C-terminal IDL tail implied that this three-residue tail binds to NHR in a novel interaction pattern other than the classical helix-groove one. Alternative conformations of CP-IDL peptide. To explore the exact binding mode of the artificial IDL tail, we first determined the crystal structure of a fusion peptide N36-L6-CP-IDL, where N36 is a NHR peptide widely employed in the structural studies of HIV-1 fusion core. Unexpectedly, well-defined electron density (Fig. S2A) shows that the whole CP-IDL folds into a continuous α -helix ( Fig. 2A) , which can be perfectly superimposed to the C34 peptide in 6-HB structure (Fig. 2B) , despite the significant difference between their tail sequences (the counterpart of Ile-Asp-Leu in C34 is Glu-Lys-Asn, Fig. 1A ). By forming almost one turn of the helix, the isoleucine and aspartic acid residues of IDL are located at the outer side and hence have no interactions with N36, while the leucine residue participates in hydrophobic interactions with Ile548 and Val549 from two adjacent NHR helices, respectively (Fig. 3A) . The interface area between one CP-IDL and trimeric NHR is 1098~1218 Å 2 , where IDL tails contribute 66~124 Å 2 (approximately 10%). In addition, we noticed that, "below" the N-terminus of Table 2 . Inhibitory activities of CP, CP-IDL and T20 against T2635 or T20 resistant strains. The samples were tested in triplicate and the experiment was repeated twice. The data are presented as mean ± SD. N36, there are plenty of space allowing more residues from NHR to interact with IDL tail, of which the structural features cannot be unveiled by the structure of N36-L6-CP-IDL. IDL was designed to target N-terminal hydrophobic pocket (NTHP), which is mainly composed of Leu544, Leu545, Ile548 and Val549. But N36 (Ser546~Leu581) trimer does not contain the intact NTHP target. Therefore, we further determined the crystal structure of N43-L6-CP-IDL, where N43 (Val539~Leu581) is 7-residue longer at N-terminus than N36, and contains whole target of NTHP (Fig. 1A) . In the final model, although the CP portion still folds into an α -helix, the IDL tail adopts a totally different conformation, forming a hook-like structure packing against the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket (NTHP) ( Fig. 2A) , just as we designed it to. The side chain orientations of both the isoleucine and leucine residues in IDL tail are toward the NHR trimer, possessing hydrophobic interactions with conserved hydrophobic residues in NTHP, including Leu545 and Val549 from the NHR helix within the same fusion peptide, and Leu544 and Ile548 from an adjacent NHR helix. The hydrophilic aspartic acid residue in IDL tail also forms an interaction with NHR by contributing its side chain oxygen atom to form a salt bridge (3.2 Å) with the side chain nitrogen atom of Asn553 (Fig. 3B ). Besides the three tail residues themselves, their conformational changes also influence the side chain orientation of Gln653, the very residue prior to the IDL tail, resulting in a hydrogen bond (3.1 Å) with the main chain oxygen atom of Gln649, further stabilizing the hook-like IDL tail. As a consequence, in the structure of N43-L6-CP-IDL, binding of one CP-IDL leads to a buried surface area of 1115~1159 Å 2 , where IDL hook-like tail contributes 158~165 Å 2 (approximately 13.9~14.4%), larger than the contribution of helical IDL tails in the structure of N36-L6-CP-IDL. Compared to the helical form, the hook-like IDL exhibited more extensive interactions with NHR and, hence, is more likely to represent the natural conformation when CP-IDL binds to homotrimeric NHR. It is worth noting that both the structures of N36-and N43-L6-CP-IDL contain 6 chains of fusion peptides within one asymmetric unit, forming two 6-HBs. For each structure, the 6 chains are generally identical (r.m.s. deviations of 0.38~0.88 Å and 0.12~0.30 Å for N36-and N43-L6-CP-IDL, respectively, Table S1 ), but with conformational differences that cannot be ignored. When solving the structure of N43-L6-CP-IDL, the space group was assigned as P6 3 at first, but resulting in unacceptable refinement statistics (R free > 0.30). Then, reassigning the space group as P1 solved the problem. In the final model, six IDL tails in one asymmetric unit adopted similar hook-like conformations with different B-factors (Table S2) , indicating its flexibility when binding to NHR trimer. As for N36-L6-CP-IDL, even one of the six helical IDL tails is missing in the final model. Considering that, in both structures, all of the 6HBs are compactly packed against one another, leading to direct interactions between most IDL tails and their adjacent 6HBs (Fig. S3A,B) , it is necessary to investigate whether the IDL structures we observed are artificial states resulted from crystal packing.
