shRNA lentivirus-mediated knockdown of Nrf2 mRNA and Nrf2 protein expression in NEC Nrf2 is the master transcriptional regulator of the phase II antioxidant pathways during oxidative stress. To determine the role Nrf2 plays in susceptibility to influenza, we utilized a lentiviral vector that expressed Nrf2-specific shRNA (LV-Nrf2) to effectively decrease both Nrf2 mRNA and Nrf2 protein expression in transduced human differentiated NECs from healthy volunteers, while a separate vector expressing a scrambled nonspecific sequence was used as a negative control. To determine the ability of the lentivirus to transduce differentiated NECs, we infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and analyzed the cells for the presence of GFP expression (encoded by the same transcript as the shRNA) 48 h postinfection (Fig. 1A) . Efficiency of the lentivirus to knock down Nrf2 gene expression was measured by isolating total RNA from transduced cells and utilizing real-time RT-PCR to quantitate Nrf2 mRNA transcripts normalized to cellular Î²-actin expression. Nrf2 mRNA expression was significantly knocked down by lentivirus LV-Nrf2 as compared to the control lentivirus (LV-scramble) (Fig. 1B) . Western blot analysis further confirmed that the expression of Nrf2 protein as well as HO-1, an Nrf2-dependent gene, was reduced, which correlated with the Nrf2 mRNA suppression (Fig. 1C) .
