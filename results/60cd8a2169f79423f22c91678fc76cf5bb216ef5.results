To determine the effects of Oct1 in T cells on the pathogenesis of a neuroautoimmune disease, we used Oct1 T cell conditional mice (CD4-Cre;Oct1 fl/fl [4] and control mice (Oct1 fl/fl ) in conjunction with a MOG-EAE model of MS. Following inoculation with peptide corresponding to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG 35-55 , see methods) and with Freund's complete adjuvant, pertussis toxin was injected into mice to increase bloodbrain barrier permeability. Disease severity was determined by evaluating the clinical score. C57BL/6 mice develop clinical symptoms 9-14 days after MOG injection [22] . As shown in Fig. 1a , CD4-Cre;Oct1 fl/fl mice were significantly protected, with clinical scores less than 1, while the control Oct1 fl/fl mice exhibited much higher clinical involvement at the peak point of disease (day 20, Fig. 1a) . Additionally, we collected spinal cords for histopathological scoring 21 days after EAE induction. The degree of demyelination in control mice was doubled to that of the CD4-Cre;Oct1 fl/fl group (Fig. 1b, c) . These results reveal that Oct1 deletion in T cells strongly protects mice from clinical symptoms in a MOG-EAE model of MS. T cells are indispensable for the pathogenesis of EAE and MS [23] . IFNγ and IL-17 expression in CNSinfiltrating Th1 and Th17 CD4 + T cells in EAE correlates with clinical severity [23] [24] [25] . Both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells contribute to clinical and histologic disease. CD8 + T cells are recruited to lesions and mediate the destruction of oligodendrocytes and axons [26, 27] . Therefore, we screened T cell populations in the draining cervical lymph nodes (CLNs) and in the spinal cords of Oct1 conditional and control mice at the peak of disease progression to determine if T cells lacking Oct1 have reduced autoimmune activity in the CNS and CLNs. Although the percentages of CLN CD4 + and CD8 + were similar between the groups (Fig. 1d , e left panel), fewer (p < 0.01) total CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were detected in the CD4-Cre;Oct1 fl/fl group compared to control Oct1 fl/fl mice (Fig. 1e, right panel) . This result is suggestive of reduced lymph node cellularity in the EAE model. Because CD4 + T cells are the primary inducers in EAE models [23] , we also profiled cytokine production in these cells. Both frequencies and total numbers of IL-17-and IFNγ-producing CD4 + T cells were reduced in the CLNs of CD4-Cre;Oct1 fl/fl mice compared to Oct1 fl/fl controls (Fig. 1f, g) . As with CLNs, frequencies of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were similar in the spinal cords of CD4-Cre;Oct1 fl/fl and Oct1 fl/fl mice (Fig. 1h) . Total numbers of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were also similar between CD4-Cre;Oct1 fl/fl and Oct1 fl/fl mice (not shown). However, as in the CLNs, proinflammatory cytokine production was strongly reduced in the infiltrating T cells in the spinal cords of CD4-Cre;Oct1 fl/fl mice compared to controls (Fig. 1i) . These data indicate that loss of Oct1 in T cells strongly protects animals from clinical symptoms of EAE and that this protection is associated with decreased CNS T cell proinflammatory cytokine expression. T cell anergy is a peripheral tolerance mechanism induced by TCR stimulation in the absence of costimulatory signals, in which T cells become poorly reactive, protecting animals from potential autoreactivity [28] [29] [30] [31] . Oct1 loss results in decreased expression of target genes such as Ifng, selectively in the context of repeated T cell stimulation [8] . Gene expression profiling using CD4 + T cells deficient in the Oct1 cofactor OCA-B reveals not only that these genes are downregulated, but also identifies increases in the expression of genes associated with anergy, e.g., Ctla4 [4] . Anergic responses can be modeled in vitro by providing T cells with primary TCR simulation (via immobilized anti-CD3ε monoclonal antibodies) in the absence of co-stimulation [31] . To determine the effect of Oct1 loss on anergic responses, we harvested CD4 + CD44 + T cells (consisting mostly of pre-activated resting cells) from the spleens of CD4-Cre;Oct1 fl/fl and control Oct1 fl/fl animals, restimulated them for 24 h ex vivo using anti-CD3 antibodies with or without CD28 co-stimulation, and profiled the expression of proteins associated with activation and anergy. ICOS (inducible T cell costimulator) has an important but complex role in the induction of T cell anergy in vitro and the development of autoimmunity in vivo [32] [33] [34] . Analyzing ICOS expression by flow cytometry, we found that baseline ICOS levels were~2-fold higher in naïve Oct1-deficient cells but that no differences were apparent in fully stimulated cells receiving anti-CD3/28 (Fig. 2a, b) . Interestingly, stimulating Oct1-deficient cells with anti-CD3 alone resulted in significantly reduced ICOS expression in Oct1-deficient cells compared to the control group (Fig. 2a, b) . Both the increased baseline ICOS expression in resting cells and decreased expression upon anergic stimulation are consistent with the observed protection in an EAE model, as ICOS blockade during antigen priming (days 1-10) increases brain inflammation and promotes EAE, whereas blockade later in EAE pathogenesis (days 9-20) decreases CNS leukocyte infiltration and is protective [33, 35] . Additionally, the expression of CD25, the high-affinity IL-2 receptor induced upon CD4 + T cell activation [36] , was decreased in Oct1-deficient cells specifically in anergic conditions lacking co-stimulation. T regulatory cells (Tregs) express CD25 and also produce IL-10; however, IL-10 production in these cells was similar to control CD4+ T cells (Additional file 1), indicating that these in vitro differences are associated with effector T cells. In contrast to CD25, CD44 expression levels were similar between the groups (Fig. 2c, d) . These results show that ICOS and CD25 levels are altered in Oct1-deficient cells in a manner consistent with observed protection in the EAE model. We also analyzed the expression of inhibitory molecules correlated with anergic responses. The expression of CTLA4, a checkpoint inhibitor and an anergy marker (See figure on previous page.)

Similarly, FR4/CD73 double-positive cell frequencies were increased in Oct1-deficient cells compared to control cells in all conditions (Fig. 2g, h) . CD4 + CD44 + FR4 hi CD73 hi cells are associated with anergy [30, 38] .

No differences were observed after 5 days of stimulation with MOG 35-55 peptide (data not shown). Thus, in vitro stimulation of T cells lacking Oct1 results in decreased expression of surface proteins associated with activation and increased expression of proteins associated with anergy. The above findings suggest that targeting Oct1 could be a viable therapeutic strategy for MS. Prior findings using acute infection with the model pathogen LCMV indicate that Oct1 in T cells is dispensable for pathogen response and clearance, but necessary for robust memory recall responses [4] . However, the role of Oct1 in neuroinflammation caused by neurotropic viruses has not been tested. Significantly increased pathology in the case of JHMV would suggest that targeting Oct1 directly as a treatment for autoimmunity will result in unwanted side effects. To determine whether Oct1 mediates disease severity in viral-induced encephalomyelitis, we studied responses to JHMV. JHMV is a glial-tropic coronavirus and well-accepted model of viral-induced encephalomyelitis and immune-mediated demyelination [39] [40] [41] . Intracranial inoculation of C57BL/6 mice with JHMV typically results in acute encephalomyelitis, immune-mediated demyelination, and hind limb paralysis. T cell responses are critical for controlling JHMV replication within the CNS [42] . Age-matched Oct1 fl/fl and CD4-Cre;Oct1 fl/fl mice were intracranially (i.c.) inoculated with JHMV (200 PFU), and the severity of clinical disease and survival were monitored. JHMV-infected CD4-Cre;Oct1 fl/fl mice demonstrated no differences in clinical disease severity out to 21 days (Fig. 3a) . Viral titers in the brains of JHMV-infected CD4-Cre;Oct1 fl/fl compared to control mice were studied at defined times p.i. Although viral titers were elevated in the CNS at day 7 p.i. in CD4-Cre;Oct1 fl/fl mice compared to control animals, by day 21, p.i. viral titers were below the level of detection (~100 PFU/g tissue) in both groups (Fig. 3b) . This result indicates that viral clearance is intact in Oct1 T cell-deficient mice. Supporting these findings, we observed similar degrees of demyelination at peak disease (day 12 p.i.) and endpoint (day 21 p.i., Fig. 3c, d) . Numbers of infiltrating CD4 + (Fig. 4a, b) or CD8 + T cells (Fig. 4c, d) in CD4-Cre;Oct1 fl/fl mice compared to control mice were similar. Furthermore, using tetramer staining [19] [20] [21] , we observed no significant differences in virus-specific CD4 + T cells (Fig. 4e, f ) or CD8 + T cells (Fig. 4g, h) . There was also no difference in the percentage of CD25 + cells or macrophage accumulation within the CNS of JHMV-infected mice at any time point (data not shown). We studied proinflammatory cytokine expression in CNS T cells from animals euthanized 21 days p.i. We did not observe significant levels of IL-17 expression (not shown), consistent with prior findings that Th17 cells do not play a prominent role in this model [43, 44] . IFNγ-expressing cells were present; however, we observed no significant differences in either percentage or numbers, or the degree of IFNγ production ( Fig. 4i, j) . Together, these data suggest that Oct1 loss in T cells does not impact neurologic disease or immunemediated demyelination or T cell functionality in response to JHMV infection of the CNS.
