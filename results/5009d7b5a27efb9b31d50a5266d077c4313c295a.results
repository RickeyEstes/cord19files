Strategy for the generation of ROSA26 knock-in ferrets. The goal of this study was to develop an efficient method for creating a knock-in at the ROSA26 locus in ferrets, while also generating a generally useful transgenic ferret model for Cre-mediated lineage tracing and stem cell transplantation studies. To identify the ferret ROSA26 locus, we aligned the ferret shotgun contig library (NCBI, NW_004569143) with the murine Rosa26 exon 1 sequence and identified the ferret ROSA26 exon 1 sequence. The ferret ROSA26 exon 1 and promoter region was compared to those previously identified in the rat 40 and pig 41 and we selected a region within the ferret ROSA26 intron 1 (ENSEMBL genomic location GL896899 32472545-32472606) for targeting of the transgene. By combining the CRISPR ribonucleoprotein (RNP) technique 37 with an NHEJ-based insertion strategy for gene editing 38 , we designed a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated, homology-independent, genome-editing strategy that utilized zygote co-injection of a donor plasmid and an RNP complex of Cas9/ROSA26-sgRNA (Fig. 1) . We first designed sgRNAs targeting intron 1 of the ferret ROSA26 locus, selecting guides with high in vitro cleavage efficiency and low off-target scores (data not shown). These guides cut both the endogenous ROSA26 genomic locus and both sides of the 8 kb transgene cassette of the donor plasmid (Fig. 1) . The transgene cassette contained a CAG promoter with an intron driving expression of a LoxP tdTomato StopLoxP EGFP reporter gene. PhiC31 and a Bxb1 attP integrase sites were introduced into the flanking sequences of the reporter transgene for their potential use in DICE-mediated transgenesis 39 CRISPR/Cas9 mediates highly efficient homology-independent targeted insertion at the ROSA26 locus in ferret zygotes. The Cas9 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes was pre-complexed with the ROSA26-sgRNA to generate the RNP complex. Ferret zygotes were generated from Sable coat-color ferret crosses as previously described 42 and co-injected with the RNP complex and donor plasmid. This approach of using Cas9/ROSA26-sgRNA RNP to synchronously cleave the ROSA26 genomic locus and the donor plasmid DNA led to highly efficient NHEJ-mediated targeted integration of the transgene cassette (Table 1 ). In total, 151 out of 179 injected zygotes (84%) developed to the 2-cell stage and were transplanted into five pseudopregnant jills (Table 1) . Twenty-three kits were born from the these transferred embryos (15.23%), and six of the twenty-three kits (26%) showed expression of the tdTomato transgene, as assessed by an en face body scan (Fig. 2) . Two of the six transgenic kits (A3 and E1) did not survive (Table 1) . However, the survival rate between transgenic kits and non-transgenic kits was not significantly different (data not shown). To confirm NHEJ-mediated targeted insertion and the orientation of the transgene at the ROSA26 locus, genomic DNA from the four surviving ferrets (A1, B2, B5 and D1) and two non-surviving kits (A3 and E1) were analyzed by PCR using primers that flanked the two potential outcomes of the insertion (forward and reverse) ( Fig. 1 and Table 2 ). Of note, this approach utilized self-inactivating gRNA target sites that theoretically should direct insertion of the transgene cassette in the reverse, but not forward, direction at the ROSA26 gene. This PCR analysis demonstrated that five (A1, A3, B2, B5 and D1) out of the six tdTomato-expressing transgenic ferret kits had targeted insertions at the ROSA26 locus (Fig. 3) . However, no PCR product was amplified from genomic DNA of the sixth kit (E1) when using standard primers that flanked the insertion site (data not shown). We hypothesized that a large deletion may have occurred in both flanking region for the E1 insertion and thus walked primers up to 1 kb away from the targeting site and still could not amplify a PCR product. Thus, we assume that the E1 transgenic animal randomly integrated the transgene. Of the five-targeted knock-in kits, three demonstrated a forward orientation of the transgene and two demonstrated a reverse orientation of the transgene at the ROSA26 locus (Fig. 3 , Table 1 ). Of note, all examined transgenic founders were heterozygotes for the transgene insertion at the ROSA26 locus, and three of these founders (B2, B5 and E1) contained random transgene integration events of which a subset appeared to be mosaic based on the intensity of Southern blot banding patterns presented below (Table 1) . To further validate the integrity of the insertion site in the five transgenic animals, the PCR products that were amplified from both sides of the transgene insertion were purified for sequencing analysis. Results from this analysis demonstrated variable-sized indels at the insertion site (Fig. 4) . Furthermore, the transgenic founders A1 and A3 contained the transgene together with the plasmid backbone inserted at the ROSA26 locus. All of the five founders with the targeted transgene integration contained indels of smaller size at the non-targeted ROSA26 allele. These findings demonstrate that Cas9/sgRNA cleavage at the ROSA26 locus was highly efficient in the zygotes that contained targeted insertions. Targeting insertions of the transgene were also confirmed by a Southern blotting assay using probes that specifically detected part of the transgene (EGFP) and external 3′-and 5′-regions adjacent to the ROSA26 targeting site (Fig. 5A) . As expected, a 6.4-kb band corresponding to the endogenous ROSA26 locus was detected in all ferret genomic DNA samples using intronic probes, confirming the presence of a non-transgenic allele in all examined ferrets (Fig. 5B) . Of importance, a specific band with a predicted size of 9.6 kb for a forward insertion of the transgene cassette was observed in A1, B5 and D1 animals using the 5′-intron and the internal EGFP probes (Fig. 5B ). Equally noteworthy, results of Southern blotting for the A1, B5, D1 transgenic animals also showed different sized unpredicted bands (4.8 kb; 2.8 kb; 2.3 kb) with the 3′-intron probe, suggesting that large indels likely occurred at the 3′ junctional integration site of the ROSA26 locus (Fig. 5B,C) . Additionally, the B5 transgenic ferret also exhibited an additional band that hybridized to all three tested probes (a ~8 kb band using the 5′-intron probe, a ~6 kb and an over 12 kb band using the EGFP probe, and a ~8 kb band using 3′-intron probe), suggesting an additional random integration event. A specific banding pattern with expected sizes for a reverse orientation insertion (9.0 kb, 3.9 kb and 9.0 kb) of the transgene was observed in the genomic DNA of the B2 ferret using the internal EGFP, 5′-intron, and 3′-intron probes, respectively. This animal also has an unexpected 12 kb band detected by the EGFP probe, suggesting the occurrence of another random integration event (Fig. 5B,C) . Ubiquitous expression of tdTomato in F1 transgenic ferrets harboring the ROSA26-targeted transgene cassette. To ensure that the ROSA26 integration site enables global expression of its CAG promoter-driven transgene in all tissues, a F1 transgenic ferret from founder A1 was euthanized and dissected to assess tdTomato (mT) fluorescence in various organs. En face fluorescent images of brain, intestine, heart, kidney, Table 2 for primer descriptions). The predicted sizes of PCR products varied among distinct TG ferret founders due to different sized indels generated from error-prone NHEJ-mediated integration. The sizes of these indels were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the PCR products (Fig. 4) liver, lung, trachea, eye, spleen and rib showed ubiquitous expression of mT in F1 offspring (Fig. 6A) . Fluorescent images of sectioned organs further demonstrated broad expression of membrane-bound mT in brain cortex, cardiac muscle, liver hepatocytes, skeletal muscle and spleen (Fig. 6B ). Ubiquitous expression of mT fluorescent protein was also observed in epithelial tissues, including tracheal epithelium and cartilage, distal lung alveoli, kidney epithelium, retinal epithelium and intestinal epithelium, but not in non-transgenic animals (Fig. 7) . These results demonstrate that ferrets harboring a tdTomato-containing transgene cassette at the ROSA26 locus exhibit a similar pattern of global expression as that observed in Rosa26 knock-in mice harboring the identical transgene cassette 43 . Functional demonstration of Cre reporter activity of the LoxP tdTomato StopLoxP EGFP cassette in transgenic ferret fibroblasts. We next sought to confirm the functionality of the Cre reporter within transgenic primary fibroblasts. Primary fibroblasts were derived from ear biopsies of transgenic ferrets and infected with a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing LacZ (Ad.LacZ; negative control) or Cre recombinase (Ad.Cre). As expected, there was efficient conversion of mT to membrane-bound EGFP (mG) following Ad.Cre infection in all the primary fibroblasts evaluated from live founders (Fig. 8A -C and data not shown). By contrast, uninfected fibroblasts (Fig. 8A) and Ad.LacZ-infected fibroblasts (Fig. 8B ) retained the expression of mT with no conversion to mG. However, the B5 founder had a subset of mT negative cells in both the Ad.Cre and Ad.LacZ infected fibroblasts (Fig. 8G,H) , suggesting that this founder was likely a chimera with most, but not all, fibroblasts containing the integrated ROSA26 transgene. This B5 founder was the only transgenic founder that produced fibroblasts lacking mT expression. Southern blotting of genomic DNA from these fibroblasts using an EGFP probe further confirmed Cre-mediated excision of dtTomato as indicated by a reduction in the size of the transgene cassette following Ad.Cre infection as compared to non-infected fibroblasts (Fig. 8D ). FACS analysis of Ad.Cre-mediated recombination in fibroblasts from the four surviving transgenic ferret founders demonstrated highly efficient conversion of mT to mG (89.2% for A1, 96.1% for B2, 58.9% for B5, 93.5% for D1) (Fig. 8E -H, and data not shown). These results further support the fidelity of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated transgene integration events.
