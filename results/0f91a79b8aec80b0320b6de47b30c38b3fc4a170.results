To investigate the effect of temperature on virus host shifts we quantified viral load in 12,827 flies over 396 biological replicates, from 45 species of Drosophilidae at three temperatures ( Fig  1) . DCV replicated in all host species, but viral load differed between species and temperatures (Fig 1) . Species with similar viral loads cluster together on the phylogeny (Fig 2) . Measurements were highly repeatable (Table 1) , with a large proportion of the variance being explained by the inter-specific phylogenetic component (v p ), with little within species or measurement . We also calculated the proportion of between species variance that can be explained by the phylogeny as v p /(v p + v s ) [71] , which is equivalent to Pagel's lambda or phylogenetic heritability [69, 72] . We found the host phylogeny explains a large proportion of the inter-specific variation in viral load across all three temperatures, although these estimates have broad confidence intervals due to the model struggling to separate the phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic components (Low = 0.77, 95% CI: 0. 28 To examine if species responded in the same or different way to changes in temperature we examined the relationships between susceptibilities across the different temperatures. We found strong positive phylogenetic correlations between viral loads across the three temperatures (Table 2 ). Our models showed that the variance in viral load increased with temperature, however the mean viral load showed no such upward trend (Table 1 ). This suggests that the changes in variance are not simply occurring due to an increase in the means, that is then driving an increase in variance. The high correlations suggest the rank order of susceptibility of the species is not changing with increasing temperature. However, the change in variance suggests that although the Intercepts are the temperature-specific intercepts when the other covariates (e.g. wing size) are set to their temperature specific means. They can be interpreted as the expected viral loads at the root of the phylogeny at each temperature. v p is the variance in between-species effects, which are structured by the phylogeny, and v r is the variance in within species effects attributable to between individual differences and measurement error. reaction norms are not crossing they are diverging from each other as temperature increases i.e. the most susceptible species are becoming more susceptible with increasing temperature, and the least susceptible less so [73] . For example, D. obscura and D. affinis are the most susceptible species at all three temperatures. The responses of individual species show that some species have increasing viral load as temperature increases (Fig 1, e.g. Z. taronus, D. lummei) , while others decease (e.g. D. littoralis, D. novamexicana). The changes we observe could be explained by the increase in temperature effectively increasing the rate at which successful infection is progressing (i.e. altering where in the course of infection we have sampled). However, this seems unlikely as at 2 days post infection at the medium temperature (22˚C), viral load peaks and then plateaus [41] . Therefore, in those species where viral load increases at higher temperatures the peak viral load itself must be increasing, rather than us effectively sampling the same growth curve but at a later time point. Likewise, in those species where viral load decreased at higher temperatures, viral load would need to first increase and then decrease, which we do not observe in a time course at 22˚C [41] . To check whether this also holds at higher temperatures we carried out a time course of infection in a subset of six of the 45 original experimental species at 27˚C, where we would expect the fastest transition between the rapid viral growth and the plateau phase of infection to occur (Fig B in S1 Text) . This allowed us to confirm that the decreasing viral loads observed in some species at higher temperatures are not due to general trend for viral loads to decline over longer periods of (metabolic) time. We quantified the lower and upper thermal tolerances (CT min and CT max ) across all 45 species with 3 replicates per species. Neither CT max nor CT min were found to be significant predictors of viral load (CT min -0.21, 95% CI: -0.79, 0.93, pMCMC = 0.95 and CT max 0.31, 95% CI: -0.11, 0.74, pMCMC = 0.152). When treated as a response in models we found the host phylogeny explained a large proportion of the variation in thermal maximum (CT max : 0.95, 95% CI: 0.84, 1) and thermal minima (CT min : 0.98, 95% CI: 0.92, 0.99, see S1 Text Fig C) . We also measured the basal metabolic rate of 1320 flies from 44 species, across the three experimental temperatures, to examine how cellular function changes with temperature. BMR was not found to be a significant predictor of viral load when included as a fixed effect in our model (slope = 9.09, 95% CI = -10.13, 20.2689, pMCMC = 0.548). BMR increased with temperature across all species (mean BMR and SE: Low 0.64 ± 0.02, Medium 1.00 ± 0.04, High 1.2 ± 0.04 CO 2 ml/min -1 , see S1 Text Fig D) . When BMR was analysed as the response in models, the phylogeny explained a small amount of the between species variation (Low 0.19, 95% CI: 2 × 10 −8 , 0.55, Medium 0.10, 95% CI: 5 × 10 −7 , 0.27, High 0.03, 95% CI: 8 × 10−9-0.13, S1 Text Fig E) indicating high within species variation or large measurement error. Consequently the mean BMRs for each species, at each temperature, were used in the analysis of viral load will be poorly estimated and so the effects of BMR will be underestimated with too narrow credible intervals. To rectify this we ran a series of measurement error models, the most conservative of which gave a slope of -9.8 but with very wide credible intervals (-62.5, 42.6) . Full details of these models are given in the Supporting Information (S1 Text).
