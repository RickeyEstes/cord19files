During the period from May 2011 and July 2013, 33 patients with laboratory-confirmed SFTSV infection were admitted to Jiangsu People's Hospital, Nanjing, China. These patients share the similar clinic manifestations of SFTS, including acute fever (.38uC), weakness, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, as well as disturbance of consciousness, ecchymosis, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage for those in critical condition (Table 1) , as well as the hallmark thrombocytopenia (platelet count ,4610 9 /L). At admission, all patients enrolled in this study had confirmed positive SFTSV in blood samples determined by reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with designated primers for SFTSV L, M, S genes. During hospitalization, all patients received similar treatment based on guidelines from the Chinese Ministry of Health [15] . Four died within 1-3 days after admission (7-9 days after onset of fever) and 29 patients recovered from the illness. The length between symptom onset to admission did not contribute to the mortality as those deceased were admitted on Day 7 of symptom onset while the median time of admission for those who survived was 6 days (range 3-10 days) ( Table 1 ). There was no gender bias for the deceased (2 males/2 females) and survivors (14 males/16 females) patients. On the other hand, the median age of the deceased patients (70 years) was notably older than the median age of survivors (59 years), but not statistically significant due to a small sample size (Table 1) . While all patients had easily detectable SFTSV in their blood, SFTSV viral load among survivors peaked shortly after admission (within 7-11 days of symptom onset) and then dropped rapidly during the remaining period of the study (Fig. 1A) . In contrast, three out of four deceased patients who were admitted on Day 7 of disease onset died within three days of admission with much higher levels of viral load while one of the deceased patients had similar levels of viral load to those who survived (Fig. 1A) . When the viral loads on Day 9 for both groups were compared, the mean log viral load for the deceased patients (8.85, range 6.67-9.76) was about 1000 fold higher than the mean log viral load in the survivors (5.92, range 2.66-7.94) (p,0.0001) (Fig. 1B) . As indicated by the namesake of this disease, platelet (PLT) counts in all SFTSV-infected patients were low when the diagnosis was made, as evidenced by levels half of the normal range (100-300610 9 /L). The level of drop in PTL was similar between deceased patients and survivors ( Fig. 2A) . After patients were admitted to hospital, their PLT levels improved steadily, partially due to treatment. PLT levels returned to a normal range on Day 13 among the survivors while those who died did so before Day 9 of disease onset with low PLT levels. Parallel to PLT, white blood cell (WBC) counts were also below the normal range (4.0-9.0610 9 /L) between 5-6 days after onset of fever but returned to normal around Day 9, earlier than PLT (Fig. 2B) . Interestingly, those who died had WBC counts within normal range, albeit at the lower end of the normal range. It is likely that these patients were admitted on Day 7, slightly later than many of the other patients, and their WBC went up further after admission. SFTSV-infected patients had acute tissue damage as indicated by multiple elevated key serum enzymes (Fig. 2C-F) . ALT, AST, CK, and LDH were all highly elevated in both deceased patients and survivors; levels in the deceased patients were significantly higher than those in the survivors (Fig. 2C-F, Table 2 ). Our analysis further demonstrated that peak elevations were at the time of admission, about 5 days after the onset of symptoms. AST, CK, and LDH levels gradually declined among the survivors while ALT levels remained elevated for a longer time. All four patients died before Day 9 from symptom onset while all these biomarkers were highly elevated. Because it is suspected that virus-induced immunopathology may be involved in the tissue damage observed in both clinical presentation and abnormal lab tests, changes in important T cell subsets in SFTSV-infected patients were measured. Both CD8+/ CD69+ and CD4+/CD69+ T cells were significantly elevated early in infection (Fig. 3A and 3B ). At Day 9 after disease onset, mean percentages of CD4+/CD69+ T cells were 3.62% in survivors and 10.52% in later deceased patients while the normal control group was 1.12%. CD8+/CD69+ T cells were 3.02% in survivors and 11.15% in later deceased patients while the normal control group was 0.51%. Elevations in these T cells in later deceased patients were significantly higher than the elevation observed in survivors (p = 0.045 for CD4+/CD69+ T cells and p = 0.009 for CD8+/CD69+ T cells). These T cells gradually returned to normal levels in survivors around 2 weeks after disease onset. HLA-DR+ T cells were also measured ( Fig. 3C and 3D ). The deceased patients had an early elevation of CD8+/HLA-DR+ T cells while these cells went up later among survivors, reaching peak levels at Day 13 after disease onset before coming down, although remaining higher than the normal control group (p,0.001). In contrast, CD4+/HLA-DR+ CD4 T cells went up at the same time for both survivors and deceased patients, and the levels continued to go up through the entire study period for survivors and were also much higher than observed for the normal control group (p = 0.039). CTLA4+ T cells showed a different pattern. Both CD8+/ CTLA4+ and CD4+/CTLA4+T cells went up around Day 11-13 from disease onset ( Fig. 3E and 3F ) and continued to go higher than observed in the normal control group during the remaining study period (p,0.001). For deceased patients, they died around Day 9 so CTLA4+ T cell levels were not significantly elevated. CD28+ T cells were also measured but no significant differences were observed between SFTSV-infected patients and healthy donors (data not shown). Specific cytokines were measured further to identify those that may be involved in the pathogenesis of SFTS. Among the seven cytokines measured in this study, there were no significant differences for IL-2, IL-4, TNF-a, or IL-17A in serum samples between SFTSV-infected patients (both deceased and survivors) and the normal control group (Fig. 4A) . However, significant elevations of serum IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-c were discovered in deceased patients, not only compared to the normal control group but also to survivors (Fig. 4B) . For survivors, both IL-6 and IL-10 were elevated but significantly only compared to the normal control group for IL-10 ( Fig. 4B, Table 2 ). IFN-c was actually lower in the survivors compared to the normal control group (Fig. 4B) . When the kinetics of these three elevated cytokines were monitored, IL-6 and IL-10 levels showed an upward trend for the deceased patients; however, in survivors, levels slowly returned to normal levels (Fig. 5) . IFN-c went down for both deceased patients and survivors.
