The CFD simulation results are shown in Table I : (i) for the isolation room; (ii) for the makeshift set-up with two changes of air-conditioned fresh air. Figure 3 shows the CFD 'FloVent' simulation results with associated airflow profiles for the makeshift set-up. There is no absolute value or target for LMAA and CRE because no research has been carried out in this respect. LMAA and CRE values for the makeshift set-up can only be compared with those for the isolation ward. Table I shows that the CRE value in the isolation room was 0.9568. The LMAA values in the vicinity of both patients and HCWs were in the region of 100, which is nine times better than those in the normal general wards and similar to those found in a similar study. 14 Makeshift set-up with simple exhaust fan installation As shown in Table I , the CRE of the makeshift set-up (2.1890) was better than that of the standard isolation room (0.9568). The relatively low LMAA value in the makeshift set-up (88.4 s for patients, 55.48 s for HCWs) was also better than that in the isolation ward (99.893 s for patients, 100.41 s for HCWs).
