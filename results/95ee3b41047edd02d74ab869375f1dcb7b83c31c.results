Plasmid design for RNA-protein co-expression using the 'tRNA scaffold' In our previous 'tRNA scaffold' strategy, the tRNA-RNA fusion (19) was cloned into a high-copy vector derived from the pBluescript KS+ one named pBSTNAV (23) . This vector was originally used to produce tRNAs in E. coli (23, 25, 26) and harbors a ColE1 origin of replication. High-copy plasmids bring significant advantages in terms of RNA production yields (11) . We thus decided to keep high-copy vectors for the design of new plasmids dedicated to RNA-protein co-expression. Moreover, in pBSTNAV, the lpp promoter upstream of the gene, one of the strongest natural E. coli promoters that controls the transcription of the mRNA of the lipoprotein (32), allows production of high levels of recombinant transcripts. Accumulation of stable recombinant RNA throughout the transcription phase can be achieved by the combined use of a strong promoter and a multicopy plasmid. Yields reach a maximum within the first few hours of the stationary phase. Although all E. coli strains can be used to express RNA, optimum yields were obtained in recA and endA E.coli strains, such as DH5 , XL1 or JM101. However, as these strains also do not produce the T7 RNA polymerase, they are not compatible with pET vectors (Novagen), which are often used to express recombinant proteins in E. coli. With the purpose of co-expressing a protein together with a tRNA-RNA fusion in E. coli, we first designed a new plasmid compatible with pBSTNAV and dedicated to protein production. In a two-plasmid system, the origins of replications determine the compatibility of plasmids, i.e. their abilities to replicate in conjunction with each other within the same bacterial cell. Plasmids that use the same replication system cannot co-exist in the same bacterial cell. We thus chose to subclone the different protein-coding genes in a pACYC-type vector, its P15A origin of replication being compatible with the pBSTNAV ColE1 origin (33, 34) . We started with the pACYCDuet-1 vector (Novagen) designed for the co-expression of two target protein genes. This vector contains two multiple cloning sites, each of which is preceded by a T7 promoter/lac operator and a ribosome binding site. The recombinant protein was cloned downstream of the second T7 promoter. The pBSTNAV and the pACYDuet-1 vectors contain, respectively, the ampicillin and chloramphenicol resistance genes, allowing selection of bacteria only co-transformed by the two plasmids. The induction of the protein expression is under the control of the lac operator and is thus triggered by the addition of IPTG. Although pBSTNAV and pACYCDuet-1 are compatible, our first attempts to obtain co-expression of, respectively, the RNA and the protein in E. coli [BL21 (DE3) strain] were unsuccessful. It was impossible to obtain simultaneous expression of both RNA and protein. The protein alone was recovered after 3 h of induction followed by cell lysis, whereas after one night of induction, only the overexpressed RNA was detected. To synchronize the RNA and the protein production, we substituted the second T7 promoter in the pACYCDuet-1 vector by the bacterial tac promoter (35) . The resulting vector was called pACYCT2 (Figure 1 ). The protein-coding gene was then inserted downstream of the tac promoter. This new plasmid allows successful co-expression of both the RNA and the protein. We subsequently validated the two-plasmid co-expression strategy with three examples of RNA-protein co-expression assays in E. coli (Figure 1 ). A small RNA of Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage phi29 was shown to have an essential role in viral DNA packaging in vitro (36) . The phi29 pRNA was cloned into the pBSTNAV vector, whereas the gp10 protein that selectively binds to it (37) was cloned into the pACYCT2 vector. As shown in Figure 1 , good levels of expression of both pRNA and gp10 were obtained 3 h after addition of 1 mM IPTG in exponential phase of cell growth. The remaining two examples deal with the co-expression of the MS2 coat protein with, respectively, the AtRNA-mala, a tRNA-RNA fusion of 127 nt, and the AtmRNA (Supplementary Figure S2) . High levels of expressions of both RNA and protein were observed. Therefore, these three examples validate the feasibility of co-expressing RNA and protein in E. coli using two plasmids. Thereafter, we aimed to design a single plasmid that could simultaneously express an RNA and a protein. Such a plasmid would simplify cloning procedures and would reduce the pressure of selection by the use of only one antibiotic. Moreover, it would allow concomitant use of compatible commercial plasmids such as those coding for rare codons (pRARE) commonly used for the production of heterologous proteins in E. coli. Two new plasmids, pProRNA and p44K, were thus designed ( Figure 1 ). Plasmid pProRNA was built from the fusion of pACYCT2 and pBSTNAV (see Materials and Methods). It contains the gene encoding for ampicillin resistance. Overexpression of the recombinant RNA is under the control of the constitutive lpp promoter, whereas that of the protein is under the control of the inducible tac promoter. Co-expression assays of the AtRNA with the MS2 coat protein, and of the E. coli tmRNA with its partner protein SmpB, using this plasmid are shown in Figure 1 . Plasmid p44K is a derivative of the high-copy pUC18 vector. We have replaced the original lacZ gene with a bicistronic cassette, which contains the lac promoter under the control of the lac operator and the rrnC terminator (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Plasmid p44K carries the ampicillin resistance gene. Although it does not contain the lacI gene, the coexpression of the protein and the RNA before IPTG addition is locked in E. coli LaqIq strains like JM101 or DH5 turbo. Figure 1 shows the co-overexpression of the A. aeolicus AtmRNA/MS2 coat protein couple. The tmRNA is similarly produced in both plasmids. As a result, we have designed and constructed three plasmids that allow co-expression of RNA-protein partners in E. coli (secondary structures of co-expressed RNA are drawn in Supplementary Figure S2 ). In our hand, there is no difference in the yield of RNA or protein production according to the plasmids used to achieve the co-production ( Figure 1 ). The applications of such tools are explored in the next paragraphs.
