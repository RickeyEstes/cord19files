ZIKV infection results in damage to the testis. As a model of ZIKV replication and associated pathogenicity, 10 week-old Ifnar1 À / À mice were challenged with 1 Â 10 6 plaque-forming units (p.f.u.) of ZIKV PRVABC59 strain by a s.c. route leading to significant damage to the testes, epididymis and sperm, consistent with recently published findings 17, 18 . To investigate vaccinemediated protection against testicular damages, prime-boost immunizations of Ifnar1 À / À mice consisting of intra muscular (i.m.) injection followed by electroporation-mediated delivery of a prME DNA vaccine at 2-week intervals were performed prior to a ZIKV challenge with 1 Â 10 6 p.f.u. at 10 weeks of age. Following exposure of unvaccinated Ifnar1 À / À mice to ZIKV, B40% lethality was observed by 8 days post-infection (d.p.i.) with weight loss, neurological signs and activation of ZIKVspecific T-cells consistent with previous studies (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). High viral RNA loads (3 Â 10 7 to 1 Â 10 12 genome equivalents per gram) were detected in the testes at 7 d.p.i. and persisted at day 21 d.p.i. (Fig. 1a) . Infectious virus (up to 3.2 Â 10 8 TCID 50 per g) were identified in the majority of mice testes at 21 d.p.i by standard infectious assay ( Supplementary Fig. 2a ). No ZIKV RNA or infectious virus were detected in uninfected control animals at any point throughout the study. At day 14 post-infection, a decrease in testicle size ( Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2b ) and weight (Fig. 1c) were observed in several of the infected mice, which became more pronounced at day 21 with means that were significantly different (two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) Po0.0001). Microscopic evidence of damage to the seminiferous epithelium was evident at 7 d.p.i. which may include degeneration of the spermatogenic lineage (Fig. 1d, upper panel) . Viral antigen was observed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) multifocally throughout the seminiferous epithelium which includes all layers of maturing spermatogenic cells and Sertoli cells (Fig. 1d, middle panel) . In the testis at 14 d.p.i. there were large areas where the normal architecture of the seminiferous tubule was completely replaced by necrotic debris and inflammatory cells, primarily neutrophils (Fig. 1d, upper panel) . The connective tissue areas surrounding the tubules were expanded by an infiltrate of mixed inflammatory cells including macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes (Fig. 1d, upper panel) . Abundant viral antigen was observed in affected seminiferous tubules (Fig. 1d, middle panel) . At 21 days the normal architecture was completely effaced with massive loss of seminiferous tubules and replacement by fibrous tissue and inflammatory cells (Fig. 1d, upper panel) , and lymphocyte infiltration, including macrophages, was observed ( Supplementary Fig. 2c,d) . Abundant viral antigen was observed within remaining affected seminiferous tubules (Fig. 1d , middle panel). Through 7, 14 and 21 d.p.i. there was increasing evidence of cell death via the mechanism of apoptosis as assessed by TUNEL staining (Fig. 1d , lower panels). Scattered necrosis of epithelial cells was noted in the epididymis at 7 d.p.i. with abundant necrotic sloughed epithelial cells and degenerating spermatozoa present in the lumens (Fig. 1e, upper panel) . Abundant viral antigen staining was observed by IHC in the epididymal lumens (Fig. 1e, lower panel) . In the epididymis at 14 d.p.i., the lining cells were low cuboidal with increased basophilia, reflecting loss of cells and attempted regeneration. The lumens contained numerous sloughed necrotic epithelial cells, degenerating spermatozoa and a small number of normal appearing spermatozoa (Fig. 1e, upper panel) . Only scattered, infected lining epithelial cells were observed at day 14 but viral antigen was observed within the lumens affecting the sloughed cells and spermatozoa (Fig. 1e , lower panel). At 21 d.p.i, the epididymal lumens contained primarily necrotic debris and degenerated cells (Fig. 1e, upper panel) . Abundant viral antigen staining was also observed within the epididymal lumens (Fig. 1e , lower panel).
