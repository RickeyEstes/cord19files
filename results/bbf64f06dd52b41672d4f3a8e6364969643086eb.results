Our approach to study the formation of immature secretory granules and constitutive secretory vesicles was based on the following strategy. First, we decided to use markers for the constitutive and regulated pathway that are subject to Vans-Golgi-specific posttranslational mod- (C) Sgll is released via the regulated pathway. PC12 cells were labeled overnight with [%]sulfate and chased for 30 min in medium containing either 55 mM K+(lane 1) or 5 mM K+ (lane 2) which was collected. In (A)-(C), cells and media were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. The positions of molecular weight markers (in kd), the hsPG (long bracket), and Sgll are indicated. The short bracket in (C) indicates Sgl, which is also secreted upon depolarization (Rosa et al., 1965b) but was not analyzed as a marker for the regulated pathway because of its overlapping migration with some of the constitutively secreted hsPG. ifications. This provided a means of selectively labeling only those marker molecules present in the trans-Golgi and monitoring their exit from the TGN, since marker molecules in pre-trans-Golgi and post-Golgi compartments were not labeled. Second, the formation of postTGN vesicles containing the labeled markers was monitored by physically separating these vesicles from the donor compartment, the TGN. Sulfated Marker Proteins of the Constitutive and Regulated Secretory Pathways Sulfation of proteins on tyrosine is an established trans-Golgi-specific posttranslational modification (Baeuerle and Huttner, 1987) . Cells of the neuroendocrine line PC12 contain two major tyrosine-sulfated proteins, secretogranins I and II (Sgl and Sgll), that are very efficiently (m95%) targeted to secretory granules (Lee and Huttner, 1983; Rosa et al., 1985b Rosa et al., , 1989 Gerdes et al., 1989; S. A. Tooze and W. 6. Huttner, unpublished data) and thus are ideal markers to follow the transport of regulated secretory proteins from the TGN to secretory granules. PC12 cells also contain sulfated proteoglycans (Schubert et al., 1988; Gowda et al., 1989) and the sulfation of the carbohydrate chains of proteoglycans, too, is a transQolgi-specific event (Kimura et al., 1984) . Figure 1 shows that in PC12 cells, sulfated proteoglycans are excluded from secretory granules and can be used as markers for the constitutive pathway of secretion. Incubation of PC12 cells for 10 min with [35S)sulfate resulted in the labeling of both Sgl and Sgll as well as a component with diffuse electrophoretic mobility between the top of the gel and the Sgl region ( Figure 1A ); this component proved to be sensitive to heparinase II (data not shown) and thus was a heparan sulfate proteoglycan (hsPG), consistent with previous studies showing the presence of one major hsPG in PC12 cells (Schubert et al., 1988; Gowda et al., 1989) . Sulfate-labeled hsPG was secreted within 40 min of chase while virtually no Sgll appeared in the medium (Figure lA, lanes 4-6). (The "Sgl region" of the gel could not be interpreted with respect to regulated vs. constitutive secretion; this region contained not only sulfate-labeled Sgl but also some of the sulfatelabeled hsPG, as shown by the analysis of sulfate linkage and two-dimensional PAGE.) To define more precisely the pathways of secretion of the hsPG and Sgll, two criteria were applied: the inhibition of constitutive secretion at 20% and the stimulation of regulated secretion from PC12 cells by K+ depolarization. Viral membrane proteins that reach the cell surface via the constitutive pathway are arrested in the TGN when the temperature is lowered to 20% (Matlin and Simons, 1983) . We tested whether this temperature block also inhibited the intracellular transport and secretion of the hsPG (Figure 1B) . When PC12 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]sulfate for 10 min at 20% and then chased at 20°C, the secretion of the hsPG into the medium was inhibited over a 60 min chase period (Figure lB, lanes 3 and 4) . However, when the temperature was then raised for 30 min from 20°C to 37%, the hsPG was rapidly secreted (Figure 16 , lane 5). Sgll was not secreted during the chase at either 20% or 37% ( Figure 1B ). Sgl and Sgll are stored in secretory granules in a wide variety of neuroendocrine cells (Rosa et al., 1985a (Rosa et al., , 1985b . In PC12 cells, the fusion of secretory granules with the plasma membrane can be induced by depolarization of the cells with high K+ in the presence of external Ca2+. Consistent with previous observations (Rosa et al., 1985b) , stimulation of sulfate-labeled PC12 cells with 55 mM K+ resulted in the release of Sgl and Sgll into the medium (Figure lC, lane l), which was Ca2+-dependent (data not shown). In contrast, the hsPG was not secreted upon stimulation, showing that it was not accumulated in secretory granules. Thus, in PC12 cells, Sgll and the hsPG are specific Separation of the TGN and Post-TGN Secretory Vesicles From morphological data, the formation of secretory granules typically begins in the TGN by membrane envelopment of an aggregate of regulated secretory proteins and budding to yield an immature secretory granule (for re-view, see Farquhar and Palade, 1981) . Similarly, the vesicles that transport secretory proteins via the constitutive pathway to the cell surface are thought to form from the TGN (for review, see Griffiths and Simons, 1986) . To identify biochemically the immature secretory granules and constitutive secretory vesicles and to separate them from the putative donor compartment, the TGN, the following protocol was employed. PC12 cells were pulselabeled for 5 min with [%]sulfate, with or without a subsequent chase in vivo, and then homogenized. Because sulfate uptake, sulfate activation, and translocation of activated sulfate are known to take ~2 min (Baeuerle and Huttner, 1987) , the effective labeling time was ~3 min. Organelles in the postnuclear supernatant (PNS) were then fractionated on a velocity-controlled continuous sucrose gradient designed to separate the TGN from post-TGN secretory vesicles. After a 5 min pulse, a single peak of labeled proteins was detected in the bottom half of the gradient (peak in fractions 9 and lo), which contained both Sgll and the hsPG ( Figure 2A ). This peak coincided with that of the TGN marker enzyme sialyltransferase (Roth et al., 1985;  see Figure 3D below), confirming that these proteins were present in the TGN at the end of the 5 min pulse. After a 15 min chase, most of the labeled Sgll and the hsPG was found in the top half of the gradient (fractions 1-5, Figure 2B ), suggesting that the labeled proteins had left the TGN during this time period and were now present in post-EN vesicles. (The finding that the [%]Sgllcontaining post-TGN vesicles sedimented more slowly than the TGN in these velocity-controlled gradients, although they would be expected to be at least as dense, probably reflected the smaller size of these vesicles compared with the TGN [see Figure 6 , below].) Thus, pulsechase labeling of Sgll and the hsPG in PC12 cells with [35S]sulfate followed by velocity gradient centrifugation of the PNS is a means of biochemically identifying, and separating from one another, the TGN and post-TGN vesicles. The formation of the [35S]Sgll-containing post-TGN vesicles from the TGN was very rapid: within 5 min after a 5 min pulse, more than half of the labeled Sgll had left the TGN ( Figure 2C ). In fact, the kinetics of Sgll exit from the TGN were as rapid as that of the constitutive marker, the hsPG ( Figure 2C ).
