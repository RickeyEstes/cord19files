Pretest and posttest Figure 4A shows the small patches of fluorescent stain on the front of the cloth for the pretest and posttest. There were significantly fewer small patches in the posttest than in the pretest (P , .05), suggesting that the CDC glove removal procedure reduced the number of small patches. No significant differences were noted in other contamination stains of different sizes and at different sites. Table 2 shows the level of contamination at 2 feet and 3 feet from the rubbish bin. There were significantly fewer small patches on the front of the cloth and on the cover of the rubbish bin at 3 feet than at 2 feet (F 5 12.8, P , .001 and F 5 19.6, P , .001, respectively), averaging 11.8 and 7.8, respectively, for the pretest and 3 and 2.9 for the posttest. Similarly, there were significantly fewer large patches on the front of the cloth and the cover of rubbish bin at 3 feet than at 2 feet (F 5 11.3, P 5 .001 and F 5 3.9, P , .05, respectively), averaging 0.2 and 0.1 for the pretest, and 0.16 and 0.2 for the posttest. As shown in Table 2 , the small patches were more common than the large patches. Figure 4B shows HCW rankings for the small patches on the front of the gown at pretest and posttest. Significant differences among HCW rankings can be seen in the pretest (F 5 4.08, P 5 .01). HCAs had significantly higher levels of contamination compared with RNs, ENs, and TUNSs. However, there was a significant improvement in the rate of contamination after the CDC glove removal demonstration, with no significant differences among different types of staff seen in the posttest.
