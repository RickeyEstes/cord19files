Totally, 5775 personal (46%) and 4369 indoor environment questionnaires (49%) were returned. 73 subjects did not fill the question of their gender, and 49 subjects did not fill the question of their of age. Analysis of non-responders was performed by SCB Sweden. SCB Sweden analyzed differences between participants and non-participants based on background factors available from other population registers linked to the census [54] . For privacy reasons we did not have access to all these variables. The participation rate was higher among older persons, especially those older than 60 years. Married persons had a higher participation rate, as compared to those not being married. Moreover, the participation rate was related to degree of urbanization, with a slightly lower participation rate in larger cities and suburban municipalities. The participation rate was slightly lower in older buildings. There was no major difference in participation rate between different municipalities. The differences in participation rate between those being born in Sweden as compared to those foreign-born persons and between those having or not having Swedish citizenship were very small. All of the differences in participation rate were small, except for age and civil status. The prevalence of smoking, allergy, rhinitis, asthma and respiratory infection symptoms in relation to gender and different age groups are shown in Table 1 . In total 56.5% were female, 63.5% were 18 to 65 years old, and 36.5% were more than 65 years old; 12.0% were current smokers; 51.0% had current rhinitis; 17.7% wheeze; 11.7% day time breathlessness; 6.0% night time breathlessness; 11.5% doctor diagnosed asthma; 7.7% current asthma; 46.4% respiratory infections and 11.9% antibiotic medication for respiratory infections. The prevalence of current smoking, pollen allergy, furry pet allergy, current rhinitis, asthma attack, respiratory infections were lower among elderly. Wheeze, day time breathlessness, night time breathlessness were higher among elderly. Descriptive data on home environment factors are shown in Table 2 . Totally, 40.9% were living alone; 50.7% were living in rented apartments; 19.0% had window pane condensation; 14.7% had any dampness in the last 12 months and 19.3% in the last 5 years. Females were more living in rented apartments and more often in certain building years. Compared with subjects #65 years old, there were more elderly were living alone. The elderly had less cats, and less contact with horses, less exposure to ETS, less renovation (painting, new floors) and less dampness, visible molds and odors. The associations between current rhinitis and home environment factors are shown in Table 3 (mutual adjustment). Current rhinitis was more common in those living in buildings constructed during 1976-1985, as compared to older buildings constructed before 1961 (reference category). Moreover, living in densely populated areas, living alone and living in rented apartments were associated with current rhinitis. When dividing type of rhinitis into three groups (infectionallergic-and non-allergic rhinitis), infection rhinitis was more common among those living in buildings constructed during 1976-1985, as compared with older buildings constructed before 1961 and other buildings constructed after 1985. Moreover, it was more common in densely populated areas, among those living alone, those in rented apartments and in homes with window condensation in winter time. Living alone and window pane condensation were risk factors for allergic rhinitis. Non-allergic rhinitis was more reported among those living in rented apartments (Tables 4). The associations between wheeze, day time breathlessness, night time breathlessness and home environment factors are shown in Table 5 (mutual adjustment). Wheeze was more common among those living in colder climate zones, in rented apartments and in homes with dampness problems (dampness index). Day time attacks of breathlessness was associated with living in buildings constructed during 1961-1975, in rented apartments, in homes with dampness problems, and in apartments with more windowopening (high window-opening index). The association between day time breathlessness and dampness close to significance for dampness index = 1 (p = 0.05). Night time breathlessness was more reported in colder climate zones and in apartments with more window-opening time. The associations between doctor-diagnosed asthma, current asthma and home environment factors are shown in Table 6 (mutual adjustment). Doctor-diagnosed asthma was associated with living in homes with odor, other than moldy odor. Current asthma was more common in homes with ETS and in homes with odor, other than moldy odor. The associations between respiratory infections, used antibiotic medication for respiratory infections and home environment factors are shown in Table 7 (mutual adjustment). Respiratory infections were associated with living in buildings constructed during 1976-1985, as compared with older buildings constructed before 1960, and in densely populated areas and in rented apartments. Antibiotic medication for respiratory infections was more common in homes with window pane condensation. Among elderly, current rhinitis was less common among those in homes with dampness problems. Wheeze was more common in rented apartments. Day time attacks of breathlessness was associated with living in homes without mechanical ventilation and more common in homes with high window-opening index. Night time attacks of breathlessness was more reported among those living in colder climate zones. Doctor-diagnosed asthma was more common among those living in rented apartments. Respiratory infections was associated with living in buildings constructed during 1976-1985 and 1996-2005 , as compared to older buildings constructed before 1961, and it was more commonly reported in less populated areas. Generally, for these associations OR were numerically higher among elderly as compared to subjects #65 years old. Finally, statistical interaction was tested, comparing elderly with subjects #65 years old. There was an age interaction for the association between dampness index and the following health variables: current rhinitis (for interaction, p = 0.001), wheeze (for interaction, p = 0.001), day time attacks of breathlessness (for interaction, p = 0.002), night time attacks of breathlessness (for interaction, p = 0.004), doctor-diagnosed asthma (for interaction, p = 0.024), current asthma (for interaction, p = 0.021) and antibiotic medication for respiratory infections (for interaction, p = 0.015). There was a trend for age interaction between apartment ownership and doctor-diagnosed asthma (for interaction, p = 0.056). Moreover, there was an age interaction for the association between ownership and antibiotic medication for respiratory infections (for interaction, p = 0.015).
