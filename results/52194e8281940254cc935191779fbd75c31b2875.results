We estimated that R t varied during January, 2020, with median values ranging from 1·6 to 2·6 between Jan 1, 2020, and the introduction of travel restrictions on Jan 23, 2020 (figure 2). We estimated a decline in R t in late January, from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15-4·77) on January 16, 1 week before the restrictions, to 1·05 (0·41-2·39) on January 31. The model reproduced the observed temporal trend of cases within Wuhan and cases exported internationally. The model captured the exponential growth in case onsets in early January, the rising number of exported case onsets between Jan 15, and Jan 23, 2020, and the prevalence of infection measured on ten evacuation flights from Wuhan to seven countries. We estimated that 94·8% (95% CI 93·1-96·1%) of the Wuhan population were still susceptible on Jan 31, 2020 (figure 2). Our results suggested there were around ten times more symptomatic cases in Wuhan in late January than were reported as confirmed cases (figure 2), but the model did not predict the slowdown in cases that was observed in early February. The model could also reproduce the pattern of confirmed exported cases from Wuhan, which was not explicitly used in the model fitting (figure 2). We found that confirmed and estimated exported cases among the 20 countries most connected to China generally corresponded with each other, with the USA and Australia as notable outliers, having had more confirmed cases reported with a travel history to Wuhan than would be expected in the model (figure 2). There was evidence that the majority of cases were symptomatic. We estimated that 100% (95% CI 51-100) of cases would eventually have detectable symptoms, implying that most infections that were exported internationally from Wuhan in late January were in theory eventually detectable. As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the analysis with a large number of initial cases, different mobility data, and the assumption that presymptomatic cases could transmit. In these analyses, we observed the same result of a decline in R t from more than 2 to almost 1 in the last 2 weeks of January, 2020 (appendix pp [10] [11] [12] [13] . To examine the potential for new outbreaks to establish in locations outside Wuhan, we used our estimates of the R t to simulate new outbreaks with potential individual-level variation in transmission (ie, so called superspreading events). [17] [18] [19] Such variation increases the fragility of transmission chains, making it The population is divided into the following four classes: susceptible, exposed (and not yet symptomatic), infectious (and symptomatic), and removed (ie, isolated, recovered, or otherwise non-infectious). A fraction of exposed individuals subsequently travel and are eventually detected in their destination country.
