No signi®cant differences were observed in the growth or growth rates observed in the exposed and control animals ( Fig. 1) . At time of DMBA administration (52 days of age), the LL group average weight was slightly higher than the LD group (187 vs. 178 g; SD 17 g). Weekly palpation of rats identi®ed the ®rst tumors at 5 weeks post DMBA administration in the LD animals. Palpable masses were ®rst observed in the LL animals at 7 weeks post DMBA and from that point there was an increase in proportion of tumor bearing rats in both groups. There was a clear difference between the groups in the number of animals developing tumors as the study progressed, with a much higher proportion of the LD animals having tumors (Fig. 2 ). In addition, the total number of tumors was markedly increased in LD animals (Fig.  3) . Analysis of variance showed a signi®cant difference in the palpation curves between LD and LL groups for tumor incidence (% rats with tumors) (P , 0:05) and for total tumors (P , 0:01). The number of rats with palpable mammary tumors in the LL group was signi®cantly less than that of the LD group at weeks 12 and 13 (P , 0:05). Total mammary tumors of the LL group were also signi®cantly less compared with LD animals at weeks 11 (P , 0:05), 12 and 13 (P , 0:01). Upon terminal sacri®ce, at 141 days of age (13 weeks post-DMBA), gross inspection of mammary tissue in each rat revealed tumors in eight rats in the LL group and tumors in 19 rats in the LD group (nine and 49 tumors, respectively). The number of tumors per tumor-bearing animal was 1.1 in the LL group and 2.6 in the LD group. These differences in number of animals with tumors (P , 0:05), in tumors per animal (P , 0:05), and in total tumor yield (P , 0:01) are all statistically signi®cant. In addition, there was clear evidence of lactation nodules (milk sacs) in 29 of the LL rats and none of the LD rats ( Table 1) . Examination of the anatomical location of tumors revealed that 63% of LD rats with tumors had tumors located in the abdominal or inguinal regions (Table 1) , and only 13% of LL rats with tumors had tumors located in comparable sites, suggesting that the abdominal and inguinal regions were less susceptible to tumor formation in the LL group. In addition, four rats in the LL group had a lobular cyst while none of LD rats had evidence of lobular cysts.
