Genetic Susceptibility to MHV-4 Among Various Inbred Mouse Strains. 11 inbred strains of mice were tested for susceptibility to acute fatal encephalomyelitis after intracerebral inoculation of MHV, as shown in Table I . The mean lethal doses (LD~0) for A/J, A.SW, BALB/c, BALB/WEHI, B10.D2 new, B10.D2 old, C3H/HeJ, C3H/St, C57BL/6J, and SWR/J mice were _<5 plaque-forming units needed to kill 50% of animals (LDs0) in each group. Death occurred as early as the second day after inoculation with the majority of animals dying by day 5. Male and female mice were equally susceptible (data not shown) to a MHV-4 infection. In contrast to these strains, SJL/J mice were resistant to the lethal effect of virus; 30-to 75-fold more virus was needed to reach the equivalent LDs0 end point. Some SJL/J mice died at 5 d but most died 8-14 d after viral inoculation. Death from MHV-4 was not linked to the major histocompatibility locus inasmuch as A.SW mice, which are histocompatible with SJL/J mice (H-2SS), were susceptible. The C3H/HeJ, C3H/St, and BALB/WEHI strains of mice, which are ordinarily susceptible to MHV-4 administered by the intracerebral route, were all relatively resistant to challenge by intraperitoneal route. Death occurred in some of these mice, especially BALB/WEHI, but only those receiving large doses of virus. After intraperitoneal inoculation, the LDs0 for C3H/St and C3H/HeJ mice was reached with > 104 PFU/ml and for BALB/WEHI mice with 10 -z2 dilution of stock virus titering 5 Ã— 105 PFU/ml.
