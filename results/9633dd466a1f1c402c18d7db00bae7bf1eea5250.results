In 2011, of the 3,719 febrile passengers from dengue-endemic countries, 74 (2.0%) had laboratory-confirmed dengue infection. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that those who were aged �60 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 8.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6-29.6) and had self-reported fever (aOR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-4.1), skin rashes (aOR, 11.0; 95% CI, 3.4-35.1), or a tympanic temperature �39˚C (aOR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.7-4.9) were significantly more likely to have dengue (all p values < 0.05). Compared with travelers who stayed in dengue-endemic countries for �7 days, those who traveled 8-14, 15-21, 22-28 , and �29 days were also more likely to be infected (aORs of 10  During 2007-2012, quarantine officers identified and tested approximately 30,000 symptomatic passengers for dengue infection. Of these, 583 (1.9%) were positive (Fig 1) . Meanwhile, a total of 1,280 imported dengue cases were reported in the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. In other words, 46% of the imported dengue cases in Taiwan were recognized at the airport border. In 2011, there were 11,663,768 inbound passengers at TPE, and 11,324 (0.1%) of them were identified as febrile by quarantine officers. After initial evaluation, 3,719 were tested for dengue infection, and 74 (2%) were positive. The proportion of dengue-positive cases among tested passengers largely varied by month, ranging between 0 and 4.7%, and peaked in October (Fig 2) . Among the 74 inbound passengers with laboratory-diagnosed dengue infections, 38 (51%) were positive by NS1 antigen rapid test and PCR; 5 (7%) were positive by NS1 but negative by PCR; and 23 (31%) were negative by NS1 but positive by PCR (Table 1) . Of the 18 (24%) patients who were positive for recent dengue infection by ELISA, only one patient was diagnosed by a fourfold increase in IgG. The median age of patients was 32.5 years (range, 1-72 years), and 44 (59%) of the patients were male. Among the 74 patients, 21 (28%) went to visit family and relatives, 12 (16%) were on business, 11 (15%) were independent travelers, and 2 (3%) were group travelers. For the departure country, 16 patients (22%) reported traveling from Philippines, 14 (19%) from Indonesia, 10 (14%) from Thailand, 8 (11%) from Malaysia, and 6 (8%) from Vietnam. The majority of dengue patients had stayed in dengue-endemic countries for �29 days (58%), followed by 8-14 days (14%), 22-28 days (11%), �7 days (9%), and 15-21 days (7%). The most commonly reported symptoms among dengue patients were fever/chills (35 patients, 47%), followed by headache (10 patients, 14%), myalgia/bone pain (7 patients, 9%), skin rashes (5 patients, 7%), and fatigue (3 patients, 4%). (Table 1) . Results of univariate analysis revealed statistically significant association of dengue virus infection with passenger age, purpose of travel, length of stay in dengue-endemic countries, and self-reported fever, fatigue, skin rashes, and tympanic temperature �39.0˚C (Table 2) . Stepwise logistic regression analysis indicated that older age was more associated with dengue virus infection than was younger age. The odds of being dengue-positive for those aged 20-39, 40-59, and �60 years were 3.2, 5.4, and 8.7-fold higher than those aged 0-19 years, respectively. 2), and tympanic temperature �39˚C (aOR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.7-4.9) were significantly more likely to have dengue, whereas those with respiratory tract symptoms were not (aOR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1-1.0). Longer length of stay in dengue-endemic countries was associated with increased likelihood of testing positive for dengue infection. Compared with those who traveled for �7 days, those who traveled 8-14, 15-21, 22-28, and �29 days were more likely to be infected (aORs of 10.2, 14.9, 39.0 and 12.0, respectively). The proportion of the variance explained by the multivariable logistic regression model was 0.2086.
