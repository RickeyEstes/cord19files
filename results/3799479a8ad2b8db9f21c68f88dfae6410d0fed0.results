To benchmark the 13 SP prediction tools (Additional file 1), we employ our previously developed pipeline [33] to generate 2 datasets that are further curated. An additional dataset containing experimentally verified SPs from Zhang and Henzel [20] is also added to this study. The contents of the datasets are tabulated in Table 1 (the original sequences used to benchmark the tools are provided in Additional file 2). Each dataset is maintained in equal number between the positive and negative instances to ensure that there is no bias in the assessment of the tools. Figures 1, 2 , 3, 4 and Table 2 show the results from the three experiments carried out, using the datasets in Table 1 (detailed prediction results for each tool are available from Additional file 3). Figure 1 depicts the overall accuracy values for all the methods across the three experiments. Experiment 2 and 3 provide values for all three organism groups while Experiment 1 essentially measures the accuracy for Euk alone.
