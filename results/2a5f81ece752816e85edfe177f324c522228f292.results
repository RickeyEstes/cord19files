Over the study period, nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 279 children seen at the pediatric emergency room with ALRI. Thestudy population comprised 236 patients who had at least one respiratory virus detected in respiratory specimens. All patients were hospitalized. Twenty-five percent of patients (n = 60) had comorbidities. The most common underlying diseases were neurological impairment (n = 17), congenital anomalies (n = 13) and chronic lung disease (n = 11). Forty-seven patients (19.9%) were admitted to the PICU; 25 of them (53.2%) received invasive mechanical ventilation for a median time of 7 days (range 1 to 99 days). Length of PICU stay ranged from 1 to 254 days (median 9.5 days). Demographic data were not significantly different between patients admitted to the PICU compared with those who did not need PICU admission. However, use of systemic antibiotics and the presence of underlying diseases and congenital heart disease were more frequent in patients admitted to the PICU, and they also had a longer hospital length of stay, Table 1 . The most frequently detected virus was RV (85.6%), followed by RSV (59.8%), HBoV (23.7%), HMPV (17.8%), HCoV (11.4%), HAdV (10.6%), PIV (10.2%) and FLU (8.5%). Codetections were found in 182 (78%) patients, S1 Table. The results of multiple log-binomial regression analyses showed thatthe detection of HCoV alone (adjusted relative risk (RR) 2.18; 95% CI 1. 15-4.15) or in co-infection with RV-C (adjusted RR 2.37; 95% CI 1.23-4.58) was independently associated with PICU admission, S2 Table. Eight patients (3.4%) died. Their median age was 3.5 months (range 2.3-9.3 months); six (75%) were female. Six patients (75%) who died had comorbidities:hydrocephalus (n = 3), Pompe disease (n = 1), Down syndrome (n = 1) and pulmonary hypoplasia (n = 1). Three patients had a single virus type detected in their respiratory samples (RV-C in two patients, and RV-A in one patient), two patients had dual viral co-detection (RV-C + RSV-B and RV-C + HCoV OC43), and three patients had triple viral co-detection (RSV-A + FLU-A + HBoV; RV-C + RSV-A + HMPV-A; and RV-C + HMPV-A + FLU-B). The causes of death were respiratory insufficiency (n = 4), cardiogenic shock (n = 2) and septic shock (n = 2).Of note, the patient who had the longest hospital stay (254 days) and also the longest duration of mechanical ventilation (99 days) had pulmonary hypoplasia, a severe underlying condition, and he ultimately died of sepsis.
