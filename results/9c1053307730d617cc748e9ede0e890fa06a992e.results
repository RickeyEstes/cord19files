A total of 712 MERS-CoV cases were included in the analysis (mean age 54.2 ± 9.9 years), and 404 (56.1%) MERS-CoV cases were diagnosed during a five-month period from April to August over the study period. Table 1 summarizes the climate factors and distribution of MERS-CoV cases. The median number of MERS-CoV cases was 4 (IQR ranges from 3 to 9) per month. The median values of monthly average temperature, relative humidity, ultraviolet index, cloud, and wind speed were 27 • C, 22%, 7, 7, and 13.2, respectively. Table 3 demonstrates the effects of climate factors on the incidence of the MERS-CoV cases. With the exception of cloud, four climate factors were found to be statistically correlated with a reduction or increase in the incidence of the MERS-CoV cases. High temperature (IRR = 1.054, 95% CI: 1.043-1.065) and a high ultraviolet index (IRR = 1.401, 95% CI: 1.331-1.475) were correlated with a higher incidence of the MERS-CoV cases. However, low humidity (IRR = 0.956, 95% CI: 0.948-0.964) and low wind speed (IRR = 0.945, 95% CI: 0.912-0.979) were correlated with a lower incidence of the MERS-CoV cases. Figs. 2-6 support the analysis in Table 3 , whereas MERS-CoV detection was high with high temperatures and ultraviolet index values and low MERS-CoV detection, with increased relative humidity and wind speed values.
