FTY720 treatment of JHMV-infected mice increases clinical disease severity and impairs control of viral replication S1P1 eGFP knock-in mice C57BL/6 mice [36] were infected i.c. with JHMV (150 PFU) and subsequently treated with increasing concentrations (1, 3 or 10 mg/kg) of FTY720 via i.p. injection administered daily starting at day 5 p.i. Mice were scored daily until day 21 p.i. FTY720 treatment resulted in increased severity of clinical disease with the greatest effects occurring at 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses (P < 0.05) compared to vehicle-treated mice ( Figure 1A ). In accordance with clinical data, FTY720-treated mice exhibited increased mortality in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1B ). By day 21 p.i., <30% of mice treated with 10 mg/kg FTY720 survived while mice treated with either 3 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg exhibited 40% and approximately 60% survival, respectively ( Figure 1B) . Based on the morbidity and mortality data, 3 mg/kg FTY720 was used for subsequent in vivo studies. FTY720 treatment resulted in increased viral burden within the brain and spinal cord as determined by plaque titer at days 7 and 14 p.i.(P ≤ 0.05) compared to vehicle-treated control mice ( Figure 1C,D) . However, at later times p.i. the majority of mice treated with FTY720 had reduced viral titers below the level of detection (approximately 100 PFU/g) within the brain and spinal cord ( Figure 1C,D) . These findings indicated that the increase in mortality following administration of FTY720 correlated with impaired ability to control viral replication within the CNS and argues that either trafficking of virus-specific lymphocytes is impaired and/or anti-viral effector functions are negatively affected. T cell anti-viral effector function and FTY720 treatment T cell responses, including proliferation, secretion of IFN-γ and CTL activity, are critical in controlling JHMV replication within the CNS [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . FTY720P treatment (100 nM) had no appreciable effect on dampening proliferation of either CD8+ T cells specific for the immunodominant epitope for the spike (S) glycoprotein spanning amino acid residues 510-518 (S510-518) [42] or CD4+ T cells recognizing the matrix (M) glycoprotein peptide 133-147 (M133-147) [43] (Figure 2A,B) . Lymphocytes were isolated from spleens of JHMV-DM infected mice day 8 p.i., pulsed with either M133-147 or S510-518 peptides and treated with FTY720P (100 nM) to determine if cytokine secretion was affected. FTY720 treatment did not affect secretion of either IFN-γ or TNF-α compared to vehicletreated cultures ( Figure 2C ). Finally, FTY720 treatment of CD8+ T cells did not affect lytic activity compared to controls ( Figure 2D ). These findings argue that FTY720 treatment does not dampen anti-viral T cell effector functions.
