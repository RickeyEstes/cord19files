Litter size is affected by housing facility but not season We bred litters in an 8·8 inbred diallel of the CC founder strains, and generated all eight inbreds and 54 of 56 possible reciprocal F1 hybrids (Figure 1 , Figure S1 -S3). The eight inbred strains, displayed across the diagonal, were mated at higher frequencies both for maintenance of inbred strains and propagation of the diallel. For all 62 genetic inbred and hybrid crosses, we recorded the following information: mated pairs, wean dates, litter size at weaning, including total and sex-specific counts (File S1). This diallel cross was originally designed and maintained for the generation of F1 mice for several experimental projects (Koturbash et al. 2011; Aylor et al. 2011; Mathes et al. 2011; Kelada et al. 2012; Didion et al. 2012; Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012; Calaway et al. 2013; Crowley et al. 2014; Phillippi et al. 2014; Odet et al. 2015; Crowley et al. 2015; Morgan et al. 2016; Percival et al. 2016; Shorter et al. 2017; Oreper et al. 2017; Maurizio et al. 2018) . As a result, certain reproductive measurements such as time between litters and maximum number of offspring per cross were necessarily biased by experimental breeding requirements. Average weaned litter size, however, is a reproductive trait that should be well-estimated independently of these factors. We measured litter size and report the mean number of weaned pups per litter for the 62 viable crosses in the diallel (Figure 1) . A wide distribution of litter sizes was observed, ranging from an average of 3.6 weaned pups for WSB·WSB crosses, to an average of 9.1 weaned pups for NOD·PWK crosses, with an overall mean of 5.5 weaned pups per litter. Examining average litter sizes of the inbred strains across all 4 years, we found neglible evidence of consistent seasonal effects (F 11;2283 ¼ 1:272 P = 0.23) ( Figure S4 ) but positive evidence of non-seasonal patterns: a modeled 'year.month' covariate significantly affected litter size (F 47;2247 ¼ 2:44 P , 0.0001; see also Figure S5 ). The non-seasonal effect could be driven by the relocation of mice between vivariums, which occurred in February 2010. The housing facility may have an impact on litter size as well. To test this, we measured average litter size differences between the two housing facilities and found that two founder strains, 129S1 and WSB, had significantly larger average litter sizes at the Hillsborough facility than at UNC GMB with a difference of 5.87 to 4.42 weaned pups per litter (P , 0.0001) for 129S1, and 3.84 to 3.42 weaned pups per litter (P = 0.029) for WSB. The six other founder strains did not significantly differ in their average litter sizes between the two facilities, but tended to have smaller weaned litters at UNC GMB (see Discussion). For average litter size across the diallel, we tested for an effect of litter number (birth parity number, for a given mating pair) on the number of pups weaned in each litter. Previous research suggests that the first litter can be significantly smaller than subsequent litters due to various biological factors (De la Fuente and San Primitivo 1985) . This effect was consistent in the diallel: we observed that there was significant reduction in litter size in the first litter (P , 0.0001) compared to the overall linear effect that parity has on reducing litter size ( Figure S5 ). Litter size is moderately heritable, and maternal effects account for the majority of explained variation To estimate founder strain effects on litter size, we used a Bayesian regression model that decomposes the phenotypic variation in the diallel into genetic and parent-of-origin contributions (Lenarcic et al. 2012 ). Using this model, the percentage of the variance in litter size explained by diallel effects was 17.73%, with additive effects explaining 9.18% (VarP[additive]; this GCA-like measure being related to narrow sense heritability), parent-of-origin effects (VarP[parental.sex]) accounting for 5.77%, the fact of being inbred (VarP[inbred.overall]) at 1.43%, and strain-by-strain interactions (VarP[epistatic.symmetric] + VarP[asymmetric.epistatic]) at 3.40% (Figure 2A) . In more detail, we present estimates for all modeled diallel effects as posterior means and highest posterior density (HPD) intervals ( Figure  2B ). Parameters are divided into two groups: general effects and strain pair-specific effects. General effects comprise strain-specific additive effects (additive), strain-specific and overall inbred (inbred), and strain-specific parent-of-origin (parental sex) effects. Strain pair-specific (epistatic) effects are the effects that arise specifically in crosses of two heterologous strains, with 'v' referring to symmetric epistatic and 'w' referring to asymmetric epistatic effects (pairwise parent-of-origin effects). Under the general effects, we see significant positive additive effects on average litter size from B6, NOD, and NZO and significant negative additive effects on litter size from CAST, PWK, and WSB strain dosages. A similar pattern is seen in the parental sex effects, where B6 and NOD dosages have a significant positive effect on average litter size, whereas CAST, PWK, and WSB have significant negative effects. The overall "inbred" effect is negative, indicating that inbred status decreases Figure 1 Diallel crossing scheme and weaned pup distribution. The number of litters observed per cross is given by the integers, with the largest sample sizes, along the diagonal, corresponding to the production of inbred parental strains. Column and row sums are given along the bottom row and rightmost column, respectively. A total of 4,448 litters were evaluated for this analysis, resulting in a total of 24,782 weaned pups. The shading within each box corresponds to the average number of weaned pups per litter in each cross, with averages ranging from 3.6 to 9.1 pups per litter. Litters for which no pups survived until weaning were not included in our analysis. The symbol "·" is used to indicate incompatible crosses that do not produce any litters. average litter size, regardless of parental strain. Each strain also has an individual inbred effect in addition to the overall inbred effect. When the individual inbred effects are taken into account with the overall "inbred" effect, inbred litters are on average slightly smaller than their heterozygous counterparts. For strain pair-specific epistatic effects, there are a few marginally noteworthy effects, with the most prominent being a negative asymmetric epistatic effect for PWK·NOD. To more clearly differentiate the contributions of the mother vs. the father strain, we reparameterized the BayesDiallel model to capture effects specific to dam.strain and sire.strain (Figure 3 ). B6 and NOD dams increase litter sizes by more than 1.26 fold, by an average of 1.66 and 1.79 pups, respectively, regardless of sire. CAST, PWK, and WSB dams tend to decrease average litter size by 0.90, 0.81, and 1.51 pups. The sire effect is similar, with NOD and NZO sires having larger litters and CAST sires producing smaller litters. As expected, we see that the dam.strain has a much larger influence on the variation of litter size compared with the sire.strain (13.15% vs. 1.81%).
