The baseline characteristics of the enrolled patients during their hospital admission for SARS are shown in Table 1 . Forty-seven of the 94 patients (50%) were health-care workers. The mean (Ϯ SD) of the percentage of lung involvement based on the worst chest radiograph appearance during the acute illness using a scoring system similar to that of Wong et al 20 was 40.6 Ϯ 29.9%. Eleven patients (12%) required admission to the ICU, and the mean Pao 2 / fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio 2 ) ratio among these patients in the ICU was 95.5 Ϯ 65.6. Seven of these patients required mechanical ventilation. All seven of the patients had a Pao 2 /Fio 2 ratio of Յ 200 while receiving mechanical ventilation with a positive endexpiratory pressure of Ն 5 cm H 2 O and evidence of airspace changes in all four of the quadrants on chest radiography. Overall, seven patients (7%) had a history of cigarette smoking. Nineteen patients (20%) had significant preexisting medical conditions. The four most common preexisting illnesses were hypertension (six patients), bronchial asthma (five patients), treated pulmonary tuberculosis (three patients), and diabetes mellitus (two patients). Comparing the SARS survivors who were enrolled in this study with those who were not included, there was no significant difference with regard to age, gender, steroid exposure, or severity of the acute illness as indicated by the length of hospitalization, the requirement for intensive care or mechanical ventilation, and the highest recorded serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (Table 2 ). Of the seven enrolled patients who had required mechanical ventilation, the mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 15 days compared with 11 days for the five patients who required mechanical ventilation among the 80 survivors who were not included in this study. The difference in the mean duration of mechanical ventilation between these two subsets of patients was not statistically significant (p ϭ 0.443). At 1 year after hospital discharge, with regard to respiratory symptoms that were present at least a few days a month over the preceding year, 28 patients (30%) had cough, 19 (20%) had increased sputum production, 28 (30%) had shortness of breath, and 7 (7%) had occasional wheezing. The mean body mass index of the group at this time was 23.4 Ϯ 4.5. The pulmonary function test results of the 94 patients are shown in Table 3 . The group means of forced expiratory volumes, static lung volumes, and diffusion capacity were all within normal limits (ie, Ͼ 80% predicted). However, several cases of abnormalities in FVC, FEV 1 , FEV 1 /FVC ratio, and Dlco were detected. According to the ATS recommendations 19 for evaluating respiratory impairment, 11 patients (12%) had mild impairment of FVC, 20 (21%) had mild impairment of FEV 1 , 5 (5%) had mild impairment of FEV 1 /FVC ratio, and 17 (18%) had mild impairment of Dlco. There was one patient (1%) with moderate impairment of FVC, one patient (1%) with moderate impairment of FEV 1 / FVC ratio, and three patients (3%) with moderate impairment of Dlco. Because there were cases of patients with impairment in more than one of the four variables, the number of patients with mild and moderate impairment according to the ATS recommendations was 30 (32%) and 5 (5%), respectively. Table 4 shows the pulmonary function data of these 35 patients who had respiratory impairment. The majority of the impairment in FEV 1 and FVC suggests a restrictive abnormality, but in only eight patients was the total lung capacity (TLC) Ͻ 80% predicted. Two patients had obstructive abnormality with an FEV 1 /FVC ratio Ͻ 70% predicted, and one of them (patient No. 17 in Table 4 ) had a history of poorly controlled bronchial asthma. The other patient (patient No. 12 in Table 4 ) had a significant history of cigarette smoking. None of the other patients who had respiratory impairment were current or ex-smokers. The preexisting medical conditions that may affect pulmonary function in the patients with pulmonary function abnormalities are as shown in Table 4 . Table 5 shows the serial pulmonary function data of 17 patients in the present study who were detected to have abnormalities from among a group of patients who had been evaluated at 3 months after hospital discharge in an earlier study. 9 The mean Dlco improved significantly by 8.3% (p ϭ 0.047) at 1 year, but no significant changes were detected in the other pulmonary function variables of these 17 patients. Comparing the pulmonary function of patients who required ICU care and mechanical ventilation during hospitalization for SARS with those who did not, there was no significant difference in FVC, FEV 1 , FEV 1 /FVC ratio, or Dlco between the two groups. Using multivariate analysis to analyze the association between known prognostic indicators of SARS, 2 namely, age, gender, comorbidity, serum LDH level, ribavarin level, and steroid use, and the 1-year pulmonary function outcomes, we found that only age was significantly associated with the FVC percent predicted (every year increase, Ϫ0.34; 95% confidence interval, Ϫ0.6 to Ϫ0.08; p ϭ 0.01) and with the FEV 1 percent predicted (every year increase, Ϫ0.26; 95% confidence interval, Ϫ0.5 to Ϫ0.01; p ϭ 0.04), but none of the prognostic factors were significantly associated with the Dlco percent predicted. Among patients who required intensive care and mechanical ventilation during the acute illness, there was no significant association among the duration of mechanical ventilation, the Pao 2 / Fio 2 ratio on admission to the ICU, steroid usage, and the pulmonary function parameters at 1 year after hospital discharge. All 94 of the patients completed the SGRQ. Domain scores other than the symptoms domain of the SGRQ were significantly higher (ie, worse) than the population norms (Table 6 ).
