A total of 345 respiratory outbreaks in CSDs, LTCFs, and other facilities (hospitals, correctional facilities, and unknown) were reported to and tested at PHO. Molecular testing was performed on 1117 samples from different outbreak settings. The number of samples submitted per outbreak is shown in Figure 1 . Of the average of four samples (range 1-14) tested per outbreak, the median number of positive samples per outbreak was 2 (range 1-8). Outbreak samples mostly originated from LTCFs (76AE8%) and CSDs (13AE9%). Hospitals and correctional facilities comprised 17(4AE9%) and 1 (0AE3%) of remaining outbreaks, respectively. Facility type was unknown for 4AE1% outbreaks tested. Mean and median ages of all persons tested were 72AE1 and 83 years, respectively (range 1-106 years). Mean and median ages of LTCF outbreak cases were 80AE9 and 85 years, respectively; CSDs had a much younger population with mean and median ages of 13AE4 and 12 years, respectively. At least one viral agent was identified in 278 (78AE5%) of the outbreaks tested. Of these, 84 (30AE2%) outbreaks had only one sample with a virus identified, and the remaining 194 (69AE8%) had the same virus identified in two or more samples (range 2-8). ENT ⁄ HRV and A(H1N1)pdm09 were the most common viruses detected in 214 (62%) and 71 (20AE6%) outbreaks, respectively. Of the 71 outbreaks in which A(H1N1)pdm09 was detected, 39 (54AE9%) occurred in CSDs, 21 (29AE6%) in LTCFs, and 11 (15AE5%) in other facilities. Of the 214 outbreaks in which ENT ⁄ HRV was identified, 179 (83AE7%) occurred in LTCFs, 17 (8%) in CSDs, and 18 (8%) in other facilities ( Figure 2 ). Both viruses were identified throughout the entire study period, reaching a peak during October of wave II (Figure 2 ). Two hundred and forty outbreaks (69AE6%) were caused by a single virus, the most common being ENT ⁄ HRV (75%) or A(H1N1)pdm09 (17AE9%). One hundred and ninety of these single virus outbreaks occurred in LTCFs and 34 in CSDs. More than one etiological agent was identified in 38 (11%) of the outbreaks, of which 19 (50%) had two or more viruses detected within the same sample (coinfection). The most common coinfection was A(H1N1)pdm09 ⁄ ENT ⁄ HRV, detected in 11 (58%) of the 19 outbreaks with coinfections. In the three outbreaks where two or more samples had viral coinfection (range 2-5 samples with coinfection), the same two viruses were found in all coinfection samples. There was an increased likelihood of identifying multiple viruses if 5 or more samples were tested (P < 0AE05; Figure 1 ). Nineteen outbreaks with multiple viruses detected were reported in LTCFs and 12 in CSDs. ENT ⁄ HRV and A(H1N1)pdm09 were the most common co-circulating viruses reported in all outbreaks with multiple viruses detected, found in 7 of the 19 multiple virus outbreaks reported by LTCFs and 10 of the 12 multiple virus outbreaks reported by CSDs (Table 1) . was detected in the majority of respiratory outbreaks in LTCFs, where the vast majority of residents were elderly. Recently published reports 7-9 have already highlighted these findings. However, this study provides a larger sample size and is unique in that both institutional (predominantly elderly) and community outbreak (predominantly children) settings are described. We also found an increased likelihood of detecting viruses causing outbreaks as the number of specimens tested increased. Viruses causing coinfections may be co-transmitted between patients as part of the same outbreak, rather than circulating independently of each other. Additional bacterial analysis would be required to conclude that HRV is the sole etiology of individual outbreaks. In contrast, the pandemic virus was detected in almost all CSD outbreaks, which mostly involved children and younger adults as recently highlighted in the literature. 10, 11 Possible reasons for a lower prevalence of A(H1N1)pdm09 in LTCFs outbreaks include cross-protective antibodies from previous exposure to influenza A (H1N1) strains among elderly or minimal exposure to individuals more likely to be infected by the pandemic strain, such as children. 10, 11 From June 11 to November 30, 2009, we found that ENT ⁄ HRV was frequently identified in LTCF outbreaks involving elderly residents, whereas in outbreak settings involving children and younger adults, A(H1N1)pdm09 was primarily detected. Younger children were not well represented in the CSD group, which had a median age of 13AE4 years. This likely reflects the age distribution of children that attend sleep away summer camps in Ontario. Limitations of our study include its observational design, which limits establishment of causality and also limits our ability to exclude the effect of measured or unmeasured confounders in our analysis. A distinction between upper and lower respiratory tract infections, the role of asymptomatic shedding, and comparison of severity of outbreaks could not be performed as clinical data were missing. In Ontario, the local medical officer of health or designate determines whether an institutional outbreak meets the provincial case definition. PHO laboratories do not receive sufficient outbreak information to make this determination. In this context, this study highlights the importance of submitting more than one sample to properly investigate an outbreak. Other bacterial agents like Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydophila pneumonia could not be ruled out as the cause of outbreaks as samples were not routinely tested for them. A distinction could not be made between staff and resident cases in this study as staff information was not systematically reported. This highlights a current deficiency in the investigation and reporting of staff illness in LTCFs. 9 An increased rate of ENT ⁄ HRV outbreaks may have been observed during the pandemic because of increased vigilance by individuals to report symptoms to their healthcare providers, who in turn had a lower threshold to report outbreaks to the public health units who coordinate laboratory investigations. Therefore, we might have seen increased specimen collection and testing that may have influenced our findings. Identification of specific non-influenza organisms associated with outbreaks can assist with outbreak management as the period of patient isolation and when to declare an outbreak over are dependent on the incubation period and period of communicability, which varies by organism. Documentation of HRV as a cause of LTCF outbreaks is important, as recent studies suggest that HRV outbreaks can cause severe and fatal disease in LTCFs, especially among the elderly. 1 A study comparing viral outbreaks in different community ⁄ facility settings with prospective gathering of detailed clinical and epidemiological information, supported by comprehensive microbiological analysis, will help further understand the role of different respiratory viruses as etiologic agents.
