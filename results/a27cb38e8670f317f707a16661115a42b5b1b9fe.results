PSD spectra of SPITC derivatized peptides improve protein identification efficiency Improved protein identification by combined Mascot search of PMF and PSD spectra is shown exemplarily in Figure 1 for the spot C-5, human prohibitin (PHB). Database search of the underivatised PMF has not led to unambiguous protein identification. The best hits held protein scores between 55 and 57 at a threshold value for significance of 64. Among these, prohibitin is ranked third with a score of 56. After SPITC derivatization, the ten most intensive m/z values of the derivatised PMF were selected by an ion gate for PSD fragmentation. The amino acid sequence of selected peptides can be distinguished considering the series of y-fragments. For the peptide of m/z 1365.0 the sequence FDAGELITQR (Figure 1c ), for the peptide of m/z 1401.1 the sequence DLQNVNITLR (data not shown) and for the peptide of m/z 1160.3 the sequence IFTSI[GE]DYDER (data not shown) was confirmed. Sequencing enables the mapping of a peptide to a certain protein within the confidence interval of its m/z value and increases its Mascot score. If the sequenced peptides do not represent homologue sections in the human proteome even one peptide sequence can be significant. In case of prohibitin each of the three peptides alone was sufficient for unambiguous protein identification. The combined search of PMF and PSD spectra of SPITC-derivatised peptides identifies spot C-5 as being human PHB with a Mascot Ion Score of 237 at a threshold for significance of 34.
