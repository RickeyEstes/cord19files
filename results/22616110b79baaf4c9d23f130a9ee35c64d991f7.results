: Of the 100 samples tested, 49 were found positive (49%) for RSV with either IF and/or VC. The sensitivity and specificity of the Clearview and the BinaxNOW assay were 77.1% and 92.5%, 87.8% and 98.0% respectively (table 1) . There was no significant difference in sensitivity (P = 0.3) and specificity (P = 0.3) between the two assays. Conclusion: These easy to perform RSV antigen tests, which have a comparable performance, facilitate urgent testing outside batched runs or outside normal laboratory working hours. In order to increase sensitivity, negative results should be confirmed by IF. Objectives: The diagnosis of infection with human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2 (HIV-1, HIV-2) is based on the detection of antibodies (Ab) to HIV-1/-2, and, during the stage of primary infection, the detection of p24 antigen or HIV-1 viral RNA. The objectives were to assess the performance of the Access HIV combo assay (Bio-Rad) on Access 2 system (Beckman Coulter) in terms of specificity and sensitivity on serum and plasma samples. This study was performed in three laboratories: Virology Department from Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, laboratory "CQFD" from the EFS Nord de France (EFS-1) and laboratory "Non-Thérapeutique" from the EFS Normandie (EFS-2 The clinical evaluation of Access HIV combo on Access 2 system showed an excellent specificity for HIV testing for blood donors and hospital patients. All patients infected by HIV-1 or -2, at the chronic stage of the infection, were also identified as positive. These performance are fully suitable for HIV screening in private or hospital laboratory. : All E-test results were within acceptable ranges and the intra and inter day variability was 1 dilution step. Zone diameter mean and range are shown in Table 1 (n = 12). The maximum difference between two means was 2.9 mm and the maximum range was 5.5 mm. Overall, growth was better and zones smaller at 37ºC than at 35ºC. Conclusion: Only a small intra and inter day variability was observed with disk diffusion on BBA with the tested antimicrobial agents. Whether this small variability can be reproduced with clinical isolates and whether resistant isolates can be separated from wild type zone diameter distributions of the Bacteroides fragilis group remains to be investigated. Also the impact of different temperatures needs to be evaluated further. T. Büyükgüçlü, H. Iakar, N. Balaban, D.Çaliskan, B. Yalcin, U. Cinar, E. Guner, M. Eksioglu, N. Atakan, B. Esen (Kirsehir, Ankara, Mersin, Karabuk, TR) Objectives: The heterogenous expression of methicillin resistance in S. aureus make the phenotypic testing difficult and slow. The aim of this study was to compare the results of phenotypic and genotypic methods used for methicillin resistance, determine susceptibilities to antibiotics used for skin and soft tissue infections. Methods: 92 outpatient and 150 inpatient S. aureus strains isolated from skin and soft tissue infection included in the study. The patients were classified as community acquired and hospital acquired by CDC criteria. Methicillin resistance was determined by oxacillin and cefoxitin disk diffusion (DD), then confirmed with oxacillin salt screen agar test, and mecA PCR. Susceptibility test to antimicrobials including clindamycin (CLI), erythromycin (ERY), gentamicin (GEN), penicillin (PEN), mupirocin (MUP), rifampin (RIF), tetracycline (TET), trimethoprimsulphametoxasole (SXT), teicoplanin (TEC) were determined. Data were compared by the chi-square or Fisher's exact test, using SPSS 15.0. Results: mecA was detected in 11 outpatient, 66 inpatient. HA strains showed higher positivity than CA-strains (44%, 12%) (5.79; 2. 85-11.74, p = 0.001 The most ideal spreading pattern to create evenly spread growth and uniform circular inhibition zones was pattern 5 with 1 mm distance between the laps and a full length primary streak. 50 mL of the McF 0,5 suspensions were sufficient for all species except Enterococcus spp which required an inoculum volume of 75 mL. Less inoculum than 50 mL increased the diameter of the inhibition zones. Inoculums with a density of McF < 0,1 yielded larger inhibition zones than inoculums of McF 0,5 density. This had an effect on the SIR-interpretation for some antibioticbacteria combinations.
