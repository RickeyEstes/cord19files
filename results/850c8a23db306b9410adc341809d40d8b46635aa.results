Sensitivity and specificity of the real-time LAMP assay for rapid detection of PCV3 Ten-fold serial dilutions of plasmid DNA were used as templates in the assay. The detection limit of the assay was 1 × 10 1 copies/μL per reaction (Fig. 1) . These results indicated the real-time LAMP assay could be used as a sensitive diagnostic test for PCV3. The specificity of the reactions was identified using DNA templates of PCV2, PCV3, PRV and other swine viral cDNA samples including those of CSFV, FMDV, PEDV, and PRRSV. The experiment was performed in duplicate. All reactions containing PCV3 were positive in the real-time LAMP assay. The other viral samples mentioned above were negative, indicating that the assay was highly specific for PCV3 (Fig. 2) .
