Design of peptides used for biophysical analyses Viral FPs typically have low sequence conservation among different viral groupings. However, they are very well conserved within a given virus family. We have previously demonstrated that the SARS-CoV S region immediately downstream of the S2′ cleavage site (SFIEDLLFNKVTLADAGF, referred to as FP1 here) was highly conserved among CoVs [14] . Furthermore, we have also shown that a pair of highly conserved cysteines (C822-C833) found downstream of FP1 is essential for the membrane fusion function along with core-associated residues D830 and L831 (the region downstream of FP1 and containing these residues is referred to as FP2 here) [5] . To validate these findings with more recent sequence information, we first performed a comprehensive protein sequence alignment analysis (Fig. 1a ) of the extended region corresponding to the FP1_2 fusion domain of SARS-CoV. These results are summarized in the Weblogo generated using the sequence alignment data (Fig. 1b) . The location of the FP1_2 segment in the context of a model structure of the SARS-CoV S protein monomer, which is based on MHV S structure, is highlighted in Fig. 1c . The analysis confirms and extends our earlier findings to all four characterized CoV genera with six invariant and eight highly conserved sites. Among the highly conserved and invariant sites is the LLF motif and the conserved cysteine pair previously found to be critical for membrane fusion by site-directed mutagenesis and functional assays [5, 14] . Next, to perform biophysical analyses, peptides corresponding to the SARS-CoV amino acid regions 798-818 (FP1) and 816-835 (FP2) were synthesized, along with an extended FP corresponding to the 798-835 region (FP1_2) (Fig. 1d) . Alanine substitutions in the LLF motif of FP1 were shown to be fusion defective in our previous study, and so a LLF➔AAA modified peptide was also generated [14] . Other peptides previously proposed to be CoV FPs were synthesized, including an "N-terminal FP" that is immediately downstream of the SARS-CoV S1/S2 cleavage site (770-788, AltFP-A) and an internal FP (873-888, IFP or AltFP-B), as well as a negative control peptide that corresponds to the region downstream of IFP within the HR1 region (887-904, HRP). The synthesized FPs contain a C-terminal GGGKKKK hydrophilic tag sequence except HRP and FP1_2. The GGGKKKK tag sequence is used to increase the solubility of the peptides. This approach has been applied to other FPs previously and has been shown to have no effect on the function of FPs [24, 27, 28] . Here, in order to further demonstrate that it does not interfere with our ESR measurements on FP1, we synthesized a variant FP1 (pFP1) devoid of the C-terminal GGGKKKK tag. We also synthesized randomized sequence variants of FP1 and FP2 (rFP1 and rFP2, respectively), which have the same amino acid composition as FP1 and FP2 but with a shuffled arrangement of residues. We used 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC)/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (POPS)/cholesterol (Chol) = 3/1/1 as the model membrane system. PS is an anionic lipid that is found in the inner leaflet of the cytosolic membrane and to some extent in endosomal membranes [29] . It is critical for synaptic membrane fusion [30] [31] [32] , and it also promotes viral entry of various viruses [33, 34] . A recent study showed that PS is critical for HIV entry [35] . Moreover, PS has been widely used in FP research [36, 37] and is also consistent with the system that we have used previously [14] . We used multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) in our ESR study as they can be much more concentrated than small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) and greatly enhance the ESR signal. Furthermore, the use of MLVs is consistent with our previous studies [23] [24] [25] .
