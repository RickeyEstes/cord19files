Our analysis considered all 2223 cases of MERS-CoV reported to WHO up to 2 June 2018. Among these cases, 462 were primary cases, 989 secondary cases, 380 cases for which the information reported was insufficient to be able to determine whether it was a primary or secondary case, and 392 cases with missing case information. Among all cases, 790 (35.5%) deaths occurred. Of the 2223 cases, 415 were reported as healthcare workers. The mean age of healthcare workers was 39.3 (interquartile range 30.0-46.0) years and 54.9% were women. Five were primary cases, 338 were secondary cases, 54 cases had insufficient information to be able to determine whether it was a primary or secondary case and 18 cases had missing case information. Fig. 1 shows the epidemic curve of cases of MERS-CoV among healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers reported from 2012 to 2 June 2018. Table 1 provides further description of the 415 healthcare worker cases, as well as the 178 healthcare worker cases reported to WHO from 1 January 2015 to 2018. Table 2 compares all secondary healthcare worker cases and all secondary non-healthcare worker cases. Compared with secondary non-healthcare worker cases, secondary healthcare worker cases were younger (P < 0.001), had a higher proportion of women (P < 0.001), were non-national residents (P < 0.001), and had asymptomatic infection (P < 0.001), fewer comorbidities (P < 0.001) and higher survival (P < 0.001). Further comparison between laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases in healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers are shown in the Supplementary material. Tables 3a and 3b shows the survival outcomes of all infections by year of infection. Tables 3a shows outcomes of all infections by year of infection for healthcare workers, while Table 3b shows outcomes of all infections by year of infection for non-healthcare workers. There have been no fatal MERS infections among healthcare workers since 2015. Table 4 shows the regression coefficients and adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for the two variables retained in the final multivariable risk model for death in secondary cases among healthcare worker. Year of infection and having no comorbid conditions were found to be independent protective factors against death in healthcare workers with secondary MERS-CoV infection. Healthcare workers include, but are not restricted to: doctors, nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, radiologists, rehabilitation staff, infection prevention and control staff, intensive care staff, ambulance staff, respiratory therapists, auxiliary healthcare workers, attendants, laboratory, X-ray and ultrasound technicians, and healthcare administrators. A lack of consistency in reporting specific job titles prohibited subgroup analysis by different roles of healthcare worker.
