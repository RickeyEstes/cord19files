The median (interquartile range) filtration factor was significantly higher [193 (145-200) ] for N95 masks compared to Totobobo masks [135 (83-184)] (P < 0.05). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the proportion of subjects achieving a ratio of 100 between N95 (19/22) and Totobobo (16/22) masks. Of the 20 subjects who gave an opinion on comfort, 13 [65%, confidence interval (CI): 44-85%] found the Totobobo mask more comfortable.
