Construction of a food-grade host of L. casei by plasmid elimination L. casei ATCC 334 utilizes lactose via a plasmid-encoded phosphotransferase system, which is consistent with L. casei 6H (Alpert and Siebers 1997) . The lactose metabolism genes of lacE, lacG, and lacF in strain ATCC 334 are located on plasmid 1 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC 008502.1). For foodgrade cloning, a stable lactose-deficient mutant was created by elimination of plasmid 1. At 42 â€¢ C plasmid elimination, nine colonies were selected and designated as strains 1-9. None of the nine colonies resulted in the formation of a 1440 bp DNA band by colony PCR using primers yz1 and yz2. This result indicates that plasmid 1 in strains 1-9 may be eliminated. Strains 5 and 9 were randomly selected for further investigation. By using novobiocin for plasmid elimination, another nine colonies were selected and designated as strains A to I. A distinct 1440 bp DNA band was obtained using primers yz1 and yz2 in seven of the nine colonies, except for strains A and F. Strains 5, 9, A, and F were cultured in MRS broth for 24 h. Genomic DNAs were isolated and used as templates for PCR with primers yz3 and yz4. The results are shown in Fig. 1 . No DNA band was obtained in strain 5, and 600 bp DNA bands were obtained in strains 9, A, F, and L. casei ATCC 334 (control). These results indicate that strain 5 was most likely the plasmid-eliminated strain, thus it was used for further investigation. Strain 5 was cultured in MRS medium with lactose instead of glucose as the carbon source to test its lactose metabolism ability. L. casei ATCC 334 was used as control. After 48 h of cultivation, the OD values of L. casei ATCC 334 and strain 5 at 600 nm were 3.68 and 0.39, respectively ( Fig. 2A) . Strains ATCC 334 and 5 consumed 12.7 and 4.9 g/L of lactose, respectively (Fig. 2B ). Strains ATCC 334 and 5 produced 10.5 and 0.3 g/L of l-lactic acid, respectively (Fig. 2 C) . These data strongly suggest that strain 5 was the Lac-and plasmid 1-eliminated derivative of L. casei ATCC 334. To test the influence of plasmid elimination on glucose utilization, strain 5 and ATCC 334 were cultured in MRS medium with glucose as carbon source for 48 h. The OD value, glucose consumption, and L-lactic acid production of strain 5 were 4.0, 14.6 g/L, and 14.1 g/L, respectively. Similar results were obtained with strain ATCC 334, which were 4.2, 16.0 g/L, and 15.5 g/L, respectively. These data suggest that plasmid elimination did not affect the glucose utilization ability of strain 5. Fig. 3 . Detection of plasmid recovery of strain 5 after 20 passages. Lane M, marker DNAs; Lane 1, PCR using primers yz1, yz2 and L. casei ATCC 334; Lane 2, PCR using primers yz1, yz2 and strain 5; Lane 3, PCR using primers yz3, yz4 and L. casei ATCC 334; Lane 4, PCR using primers yz3, yz4 and strain 5. The stability of strain 5 was tested by detecting plasmid recovery using PCR. The results are shown in Fig. 3 . Using two pairs of primers yz1, yz2 and yz3, yz4, no DNA bands were detected in strain 5 after 20 passage times. The 1440 bp and 600 bp DNA bands could be found using the control strain L. casei ATCC 334. These results demonstrate that strain 5 was a stable plasmid-eliminated derivative of L. casei ATCC 334 and that no plasmid recovery occurred. Strain 5 was designated as L. casei Q-5 and was used for further investigation.
