Levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are greater in the rJ relative to the rJ.M Y135Q -infected CNS rJ-infected mice develop fatal acute encephalitis, whereas mice infected with rJ.M Y135Q develop a nonlethal mild encephalitis and these differences correlate with numbers of JHMV-specific CD4 T cells in the brain (Anghelina et al., 2006) . Since the host response to infection is determined by relative contributions of pro and anti-inflammatory factors, we reasoned that increased clinical disease in rJ-infected mice, when compared to those infected with rJ.M Y135Q , might result from not only an increased number of virus-specific CD4 Th1 cells, but also higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. To investigate this possibility, we measured protein levels of several molecules known to be upregulated in the brains of JHMV-infected mice (IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNFα, CCL2, CCL5) (Bergmann et al., 2006) at days 5 and 7 p.i. (Table 1) . Significantly higher levels of IL-6, CCL2, CCL5 and IFN-γ , but not IL-1β or TNF-α were measured in rJ compared to rJ.M Y135Q -infected mice at day 5 p.i. In general, levels of cytokines were lower at day 7 when compared to day 5, in agreement with previous studies (Rempel et al., 2004) , but levels of IL-6, CCL2 and CCL5 remained increased in rJ compared to rJ.M Y135Qinfected brains. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6 and TNF-α, have been associated with decreased Treg function (Korn et al., 2007) and autoimmunity is diminished in IL6 −/− mice, in part because Tregs are fully suppressive in the absence of this cytokine (Pasare and Medzhitov, 2003) . IL-6 was significantly lower and disease was milder in rJ.M Y135Q compared to rJ-infected mice, prompting us to assess levels and function of Tregs in infected mice.
