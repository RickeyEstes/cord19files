The introduction of H1N1 swine flu this year provided a real life challenge for the RVP assay. The RVP test results for 20 confirmed cases of H1N1 swine influenza in four Canadian cities in three provinces (Nova Scotia, Ontario and British Columbia) are shown in Table 1 . All 20 individuals who presented with ILI, had either recently returned from Mexico or had an epidemiologic link to travelers to Mexico, and were confirmed as positive for H1N1 A/Swine/California/04/2009 by either the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, the Ontario Agency for Health Prevention and Promotion in Toronto, or the BCCDC in Vancouver using a combination of real time matrix gene PCR, real time PCR targeting the A/Swine/California/04/2009 HA gene or by sequencing the HA gene. Matrix gene signals for all 20 patients were positive (mean signal Table 2 xTAG TM RVP results for the matrix and hemagglutinin gene targets for 17 influenza A isolates from human, avian, equine and swine a . was 6,970 MFI) while the H1 and H3 signals were negative indicating the presence of a non-seasonal, non-H1, non-H3 influenza A virus. To further validate the ability of the RVP test to identify non-H1, non-H3 influenza viruses we tested 17 influenza A viruses representing 11 of the 16 HA subtypes and four untyped isolates. The influenza subtypes tested included both high pathogenicity and low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses isolated from four bird species (turkey, quail, mallard, chicken) in five countries (Canada, Italy, England, U.S.A., and Vietnam), four swine and two equine viruses. The results show that all 17 viruses had a positive matrix signal (mean, 7,692) and negative signals for both H1 and H3 genes ( Table 2) . For comparison, one H1 and two H3 seasonal influenza specimens gave readings of 8,716, 1,566, and 3,255 for the H1 and H3 targets, respectively. The RVP test also correctly flagged two H5N1 isolates as H5 subtypes (using unmasked software). These results indicate that the RVP test can distinguish between seasonal H1, H3 influenza and non-H1, non-H3, non-seasonal avian or animal influenza.
