Resident repair cells of the lens direct wounded lens epithelial cells to migrate off their endogenous basement membrane and across an adjacent tissue culture substrate Our studies investigate how mesenchymal leader cells, whose normal role it is to direct regenerative repair of epithelia following wounding, can be induced to differentiate to myofibroblasts. They were conducted with the ex vivo MCS culture model we originally established to investigate mechanisms of wound repair (Walker et al., 2007 (Walker et al., , 2010 (Walker et al., , 2015 Menko et al., 2014a) . This wound model has clinical relevance to fibrosis, as cataract surgery often elicits a fibrotic response, resulting in the disease known as posterior capsule opacification (PCO) (Wormstone et al., 2009; Wormstone and Eldred, 2016; Nibourg et al., 2015) . We focus on the resident population of vimentin-rich, mesenchymal repair cells of the lens that, on MCS injury, are activated to migrate to and rapidly populate the wound edge of the lens epithelium ( Figure 1A , D1 postinjury, repair cells at the MCS wound edge colored purple, arrow) (Walker et al., 2010) . Here, functioning as classical leader cells, these cells direct regenerative repair of the injured epithelium, a task that is vimentin dependent (Menko et al., 2014a; Bleaken et al., 2016) . To create these cultures, the MCS-wounded lens is flattened on a tissue culture substrate by making cuts through the epithelium and its associated basement membrane, creating the star-shaped wounded-explant cultures. The cuts made to flatten the explants are additional injury sites that form the outside edge of the explant. These sites of injury are also rapidly populated by the wound-activated resident mesenchymal repair cells ( Figure 1A , repair cells at the cut edge colored purple, arrowheads). These mesenchymal cells lead the lens epithelial cells from their original position on their native lens basement membrane capsule onto and across the adjacent, rigid tissue culture substrate. We refer to the region on the tissue culture plastic that the cells occupy postwounding as the extracapsular zone (ECZ). Formation of the ECZ in response to injury is best observed by time-lapse microscopy (Supplemental Video 1, representative still images shown in Figure  1 , Bi-Biii). Live imaging revealed that the mesenchymal cells at the leading edge extend and retract lamellipodial protrusions along the substrate as they lead the forward movement of the wounded epithelium across the culture substrate. This behavior closely parallels the injury response we have observed for these resident repair cells previously, when they populate the leading edge of the MCS-wound and direct wound closure on the endogenous basement membrane substrate of the lens (Menko et al., 2014a; Bleaken et al., 2016) . We have shown previously that vimentin is a principal characteristic of the repair cells that direct wound closure at the MCS wound edge (Menko et al., 2014a) . Here we examined whether vimentin was also a defining feature of the repair cells in their function as leader cells of the ECZ. Following immunolabeling for vimentin at D2 postinjury, the MCS-wounded-explant cultures were imaged in regions of the ECZ typical of the boxed area in Figure 1Biii . The leading-edge cells of the ECZ expressed high levels of vimentin, prominently localized to the lamellipodial protrusions that extend along their substrate surface (Figure 1, C and D, arrows) . The organization of vimentin in these cells was examined in cultures fixed with either formaldehyde (Figure 1 , C and E) or methanol (Figure 1 , D and F), and the cells were imaged by both confocal (Figure 1 , C and D) and superresolution confocal (Figure 1 , E and F) microscopy. Methanol fixation, which extracts membrane lipids, highlighted the organized vimentin cytoskeleton in the leader cell population. Immunostaining of formaldehyde fixed cultures, permeabilized with Triton X-100 postfixation, revealed both a diffuse pattern of vimentin labeling and organized vimentin filaments. This suggests that formaldehyde fixation may enhance preservation of soluble vimentin populations. We have shown previously that another defining feature of the vimentin-rich, leader cell population activated in response to MCS wounding was its expression of CD44 (Bleaken et al., 2016) . While widely expressed, this cell-surface receptor for hyaluronic acid (HA) is characteristic of leukocytes and known for its role in cell adhesion and migration (McDonald and Kubes, 2015; Bano et al., 2016; Senbanjo and Chellaiah, 2017) . Immunolabeling of the woundedlens explant cultures with an antibody to the CD44 extracellular domain at D2 postinjury showed that, in the ECZ, CD44 is expressed exclusively by the repair cells at the leading edge ( Figure 1G , arrow). CD44 is enriched at the plasma membrane of these leader cells, especially along their cell borders (arrowhead), and was not expressed by the lens epithelial cells that migrate behind the CD44+/vimentin+ leader cell population of the ECZ. αSMA+ myofibroblasts appear at the leading edge of the ECZ, with their emergence linked to rigidity of the microenvironment Substrate rigidity is a known factor in inducing cells that mediate regenerative repair to become myofibroblasts (Arora et al., 1999; Li et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2010; O'Connor et al., 2015) . Reprogramming of cells to a myofibroblast phenotype is characterized by the induction of αSMA and its organization into stress fibers (Skalli et al., 1989; Schmitt-Graff et al., 1994) . Western blot analysis of protein extracts from cells isolated from the ECZ of MCS-woundedexplant cultures from D1 to D6 postinjury showed that αSMA was first expressed by ECZ cells at culture D3 and increased greatly by D6 ( Figure 2A ). Since the ECZ is composed of both lens epithelial cells and the lens-resident, vimentin-rich repair cells that populate the wound edge postinjury, we performed immunofluorescence analysis to determine where in the ECZ the αSMA-expressing cells were localized. Confocal image analysis at culture D3 revealed that αSMA stress-fiber-positive myofibroblasts emerged exclusively at the leading edge of the ECZ (Figure 2 , B and C), the area populated by the vimentin-rich FIGURE 2: Myofibroblasts emerge at the leading edge of the ECZ and their differentiation is influenced by the rigidity of the microenvironment. (A) Total cell lysates prepared from isolated ECZ regions at D1-D3, and D6 were immunoblotted for αSMA, with GAPDH as loading control. Results were quantified for three independent experiments and presented as a ratio of αSMA to GAPDH for each fraction. Results demonstrate that αSMA is first expressed on D3 and increases threefold by D6. (B-E, H) Ex vivo explant cultures were fixed D3 (B, C, H) and D6 (D, E) postinjury and labeled for αSMA (B-E, H). In C, E, and H αSMA is green and F-actin is red. Cultures were imaged by confocal microscopy in the ECZ (B-E) or on the native capsule (H). αSMA-positive myofibroblasts emerged at the leading edge of the ECZ at D3 (B, C, arrows) and by D6 myofibroblasts had expanded in number and formed extensive αSMA stress fibers (D, E). (F) To examine induction of myofibroblast differentiation in a physiological relevant profibrotic microenvironment, the ex vivo MCS-wounded explants were cultured for 3 d postinjury on 2.5 mg/ml collagen gels, corresponding to 25 kPa, and immunolabeled for αSMA. The result shows that leader cells are induced to acquire a myofibroblast phenotype in a microenvironment within the physiological range of fibrotic tissues. In contrast, few αSMA+ cells were observed on the native capsule at culture D3 (H), at which time wound healing was just completed (G, white box). Results show that the rigidity of the tissue culture substrate is a factor in the induction of myofibroblast differentiation. The results presented represent a minimum of three independent studies. Mag bar = 20 µm; images in B-E and G are presented as projections. Image in H is presented as single optical section. We also examined whether a substrate in the physiological range of a profibrotic tissue (Wells, 2013) induces repair-modulating cells to alter their fate to differentiate into a myofibroblast phenotype. The ex vivo, MCSwounded explants were placed on tissue culture dishes coated with collagen I gels of 2.5 mg/ml, corresponding to a Young's modulus of 25 kPa to examine whether rigidity of the microenvironment is a factor in inducing cells involved in repair of the wounded-lens epithelium to alter their fate and differentiate to myofibroblasts. The stiffness of the collagen gel is in range of the rigidity of fibrotic tissues (Wells, 2013) . Appearance of myofibroblasts in the ECZ of MCS-wounded explants cultured on the collagen I gel substrates was determined by confocal microscopy imaging following immunolabeling for αSMA. The results show that on collagen gels of 25 kPa, the leading-edge cells had differentiated to αSMA+ stress-fiber-containing myofibroblasts on D3 ( Figure 2F ). The ex vivo MCS-injury model provides a unique opportunity to follow, concurrently, the function of resident repair cells in regulating wound healing in their native microenvironment and how these same repair-modulating cells may be induced to differentiate to myofibroblasts in the controlled environment of the ECZ. Therefore, we examined whether myofibroblasts also appeared on the native lens basement membrane capsule undergoing regenerative repair post-MCS (Figure 2, G and H). In contrast to the induction of myofibroblasts on the ECZ substrates, very few αSMA+ cells were induced to form on the native substrate of the explant where the mesenchymal leader cells effectively direct closure of the lens epithelial wound by culture D3.
