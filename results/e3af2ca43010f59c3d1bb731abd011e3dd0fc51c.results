Of the 16 SARS coronavirus strains submitted to Genbank before June, 2003, 6 had accurate date of host death recorded. We chose these 6 to estimate the last common ancestor and the mutation rate of the SARS coronavirus (Table 1) . We performed the calculation, and the fitting result of the best division (See Table 2 ) is shown in Fig. 2 , including the differences between sequences D(S,S') versus the time factor (T + T'). The evolution rate K was estimated to be 0.16 base/day, which is similar to the reported evolution rate of HIV-1 virus [10] . The date of the last common ancestor T 0 was found to be about August or September, 2002, which is also in accordance with the epidemic investigations finding that the first verifiable SARS case was reported as early as on November 11, 2002. We validated our estimation of the evolutionary rate by grouping strains according to the estimated date of their Phylogenetic Tree Figure 1 Phylogenetic Tree a) For two strains; b) For several strains, these can be divided into two groups from the last common ancestor. pair wise last common ancestor. Applying the estimated K = 0.16, we can determine a date T 0 *(i, j) of the last common ancestor for each pair <S i , S j > by E(D(S,S)) = K(T i + T j -2T 0 *(i, j)) [ Table 2 ], and then divide the 6 into two groups, G 1 = {BJ01, BJ02, GZ01} and G 2 = {TOR2,SIN2500,US}. It is apparent that every two members in G 1 have a last common ancestor with a date T 0 *(i, j) > 0, while every two members in G 2 have corresponding T 0 *(i, j) < 0. This would imply that the strains in G 1 have a more recent last common ancestor than those in G 2 . This partition of strains was supported by Ruan et al [9] .
