Seventy-nine NSCLC patients were participating in our chemotherapy clinical trials between April 1 and July 15, 2003. Among them, five patients had been placed in our isolation unit to rule out SARS infection during this period, because they had exhibited clinical pictures similar to SARS infection or had a contact history with a SARS patient ( Table 1 ). All five patients had a negative coronavirus study. Of 373 scheduled chemotherapy injections for 79 patients, either in the outpatient clinic or under hospitalization, a delay in treatment occurred only 10 times. Three patients refused further chemotherapy because of a fear of getting SARS if they visited the hospital. Fifty-eight patients responded to our questionnaires. They all knew that a SARS outbreak had occurred in Taiwan, 63.8% of patients were afraid of visiting any hospital during this period, and 36.2% felt that the SARS infection was more severe and fatal than their lung cancer. The details are shown in Table 2 .
