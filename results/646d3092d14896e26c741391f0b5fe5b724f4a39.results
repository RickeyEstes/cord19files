GRFT is expressed in T1 transgenic rice endosperm and is correctly folded in planta Mature seed-derived rice embryos (15-20 days after pollination) were transformed by particle bombardment with a construct containing the GRFT coding sequence under the control of the maize zein promoter and a second construct containing the selectable marker hpt (Christou et al., 1991) . Embryo-derived callus was selected on hygromycin-supplemented medium and 13 independent transformants were regenerated and transferred to the greenhouse. We chose three independent lines (2, 6 and 10) that expressed OS GRFT at high levels in the endosperm (128, 301 and 104 lg/g dry seed weight, respectively). The yields were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to ensure that we detected only the correctly folded and soluble form of the protein. The remaining lines expressed OS GRFT at only low levels and thus were deemed unsuitable for further experiments. The best-performing line (line 6) was selected for further in-depth investigation (Figure 1a) . A one-step protocol allows the inexpensive purification of OS GRFT The OS GRFT protein was purified from crude extracts of T1 rice endosperm prepared from line 6 by capturing the protein on an immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) column and eluting it with buffer containing 250 mM imidazole. The final yield of OS GRFT after purification was 223 lg/g dry seed weight, which represents a recovery of 74%. The presence of OS GRFT in the crude extracts was confirmed by reducing sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, showing a visible band of~15 kDa, the anticipated molecular mass of His 6 -tagged GRFT (Figure 2a) . The presence of OS GRFT was confirmed by immunoblotting and detection using a primary rabbit anti-GRFT Figure 1 (a) GRFT accumulation in rice endosperm. An immunoglobulinspecific sandwich ELISA was used to screen the three best-performing independent events. The ELISA plate was coated with gp120, and GRFT protein assembly was confirmed using a primary rabbit anti-GRFT polyclonal antiserum and a secondary HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antiserum. Four serial dilutions per sample are shown (neat, 1/2, 1/4 and 1/ 8). WT, wild-type extracts; C Ã€ , negative control (PBS); C + , GRFT purified from E. coli (500 ng/mL) as a positive control. OD, optical density at 450 nm. (b) Transformation construct pgZ63-GRFT for the stable expression of GRFT in rice endosperm. The expression cassette comprised the endosperm-specific maize zein promoter, the rice a-amylase 3A signal peptide sequence (SP), a His 6 tag, the GRFT coding region (grft) and the nos terminator (t-nos). (Figure 2b ). This revealed an intense band at 14.6 kDa, the correct size for His 6 -tagged GRFT, and another at 16-17 kDa probably representing the incomplete removal of the rice a-amylase (RAmy3D) signal peptide which is 25 residues in length and has a predicted molecular mass of 2.6 kDa. Alternatively, the additional band may reflect O-linked glycosylation at one of the multiple serine or threonine residues of GRFT. No degradation products were present, suggesting the protein remained stable in the rice endosperm tissue (Figure 2b ). Crude rice endosperm extracts containing OS GRFT show gp120-binding activity comparable to pure EC GRFT The crude extracts from T1 seeds of transgenic lines 2, 6 and 10 were tested by ELISA for in vitro binding activity against HIV gp120, using EC GRFT as a positive control and wild-type rice endosperm as a negative control. Extracts from all three transgenic lines showed greater gp120-binding activity than the wildtype endosperm extracts as expected, which confirmed that the OS GRFT was functional and that endogenous plant lectins do not interfere with binding. Furthermore, crude endosperm extracts containing OS GRFT bound to gp120 in a concentration-dependent manner, with binding behaviour nearly identical to that of EC GRFT. The crude extracts containing OS GRFT therefore possessed essentially the same oligosaccharide-dependent binding properties as the same recombinant protein expressed in bacteria ( Figure 3 ).
