MERS and Bat (HKU4, HKU5) coronaviruses are found to be mostly conserved in case of envelope protein In case of envelope protein, MERS coronaviruses are found to be highly conserved with HKU4 and HKU5 bat coronaviruses (Figs. 1, 2 respectively) compared to the other proteins (data not shown). From the maximum parsimony phylogenetic analysis of MEGA 5.0, it is found that spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleo-capsid (N) protein MERS-CoV has relationship with Bat (HKU4 and HKU5) coronavirus (Additional file 2: Figure S1 , Additional file 3: Figure S2 , Additional file 4: Figure S3 and Additional file 5: Figure S4 respectively).
