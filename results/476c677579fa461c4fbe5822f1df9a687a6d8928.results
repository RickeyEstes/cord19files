We generate networks computationally with community structure by creating small subnetworks of locally dense communities, which are then randomly connected to one another. A particular feature of such networks is that the variance of their degree distribution is relatively low, and thus the spread of a disease is only marginally affected by it [34] . Running standard susceptible-infected-resistant (SIR) epidemic simulations (see Methods) on these networks, we find that the average epidemic size, epidemic duration and the peak prevalence of the epidemic are strongly affected by a change in community structure connectivity that is independent of the overall degree distribution of the full network ( Figure 1 ). Note that the value range of Q shown in Figure 1 is in agreement with the value range of Q found in the empirical networks used further below, and that lower values of Q do not affect the results qualitatively (see Suppl. Mat. Figure S1 ). Epidemics in populations with community structure show a distinct dynamical pattern depending on the extent of community structure. In networks with strong community structure, an infected individual is more likely to infect members of the same community than members outside of the community. Thus, in a network with strong community structure, local outbreaks may die out before spreading to other communities, or they may spread through various communities in an almost serial fashion, and large epidemics in populations with strong community structure may therefore last for a long time. Correspondingly, the incidence rate can be very low, and the number of generations of infection transmission can be very high, compared to the explosive epidemics in populations with less community structure (Figures 2a and 2b ). On average, epidemics in networks with strong community structure exhibit greater variance in final size (Figures 2c and 2d) , a greater number of small, local outbreaks that do not develop into a full epidemic, and a higher variance in the duration of an epidemic. In order to halt or mitigate an epidemic, targeted immunization interventions or social distancing interventions aim to change the structure of the network of susceptible individuals in such a way as to make it harder for a pathogen to spread [35] . In practice, the number of people to be removed from the susceptible class is often constrained for a number of reasons (e.g., due to limited vaccine supply or ethical concerns of social distancing measures). From a network perspective, targeted immunization methods translate into indentifying which nodes should be removed from a network, a problem that has caught considerable attention (see for example [36] and references therein). Targeting highly connected individuals for immunization has been shown to be an effective strategy for epidemic control [7, 14] . However, in networks with strong community structure, this strategy may not be the most effective: some individuals connect to multiple communities (so-called community bridges [37] ) and may thus be more important in spreading the disease than individuals with fewer inter-community connections, but this importance is not necessarily reflected in the degree. Identification of community bridges can be achieved using
