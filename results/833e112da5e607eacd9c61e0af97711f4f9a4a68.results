The 30 research articles were categorized by EIDs addressed, social media studied, and research approaches taken. In terms of the EIDs studied, H1N1 (or swine flu, n = 15) received the most attention from researchers, followed by Ebola virus (n = 10) and H7N9 (or avian flu/bird flu, n = 2). A number of other EIDs, including West Nile virus, measles, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, only appeared in 1 article. (See Table 1 for information about articles studying each EID.) In terms of the types of social media studied, Twitter was undoubtedly the most scrutinized social media platform and was studied in 16 articles. YouTube, Facebook, and blogs were each studied in 6 articles. Discussion forums were studied in 3 articles, and Flickr appeared in 2 articles. Finally, Instagram, Web site comments, Weibo (a Chinese microblogging platform), and Delicious were each studied in 1 article. (See Table 2 for information about articles studying each social media application.) To provide a systematic overview of these studies, we evaluated them in terms of the topic studied, theory used, method used, and major findings. We found that these studies typically take one of the following 3 approaches: (1) assessment of the public's interest in and responses to EIDs, (2) organizations' use of social media in EID communication, and (3) assessment of the accuracy of medical information about EIDs on social media. Only 1 article fell into 2 categories. 16 Studies belonging to each of these approaches are subsequently reviewed in depth.
