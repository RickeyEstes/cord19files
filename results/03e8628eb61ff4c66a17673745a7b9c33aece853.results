Overall, during the 2017-18 season, 29 patients admitted to UHU received a diagnosis of Influenza. The characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table II. The median age of the patients admitted was 48 years (range 0-87 years); there was an equal distribution of genders (51.7% men, 48.3% women). Two women were pregnant: one in the first trimester and one in the second. In 65.5% of cases, a B virus was isolated, in 24.1% an A/unsubtypized virus, in 6.9% an A H1N1 and in 3.4% another A virus subtype. The seasonal peak was reached in the first two months of 2018, with 68.9% of all severe cases notified between January and February. It was estimated that an antiviral treatment was administered (a neuroaminidase inhibitor, Oseltamivir) in 58% of cases. The median duration of antiviral therapy was 7 days. Overall, 65.5% of the subjects developed a complication (see Tab. I for details of the definition of "complication"). The majority of these had respiratory syndromes: 44.8% complicated with bacterial pneumonia, 17.2% developed a severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and 27.6% an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); 6.8 % developed myocarditis. A case of encephalitis was also observed in a patient with Influenza B/Yamagata strain isolated from a nasopharyngeal swab. The cases classified as "severe" accounted for 41.4% of those admitted to UHU (see Tab. I for details of the definition of "severe case"). The median age of this population was 59.5 years (range 0-84), and the gender distribution was almost equal (46.5% were males). The majority of patients (70%) had at least one comorbidity, with a predominance of cardiovascular diseases (48.3%). See Tab. II for details of "comorbidity" definition. All patients with severe forms were admitted to the ICU. Of this group, 27.6% required Orotracheal Intubation (OTI) and 10.3% needed to be placed on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). Seven patients (24.1%) died; 4 had Influenza B virus isolated from respiratory samples. Overall, 3 deaths were recorded in subjects younger than 50 years old. Of these, one presented with an influenza-related myocarditis and developed cardiogenic shock; in the other two cases, the final diagnosis was multi-organ failure. None of the 3 patients aged under 50 years had been vaccinated. Overall, 70% of the fatal cases developed pneumonia, ARDS was diagnosed in 4 cases, acute heart failure in 2 cases, and myocarditis in 1 case. Regarding vaccination coverage, only 9 (31%) of the UHU cohort had been vaccinated. Six vaccinated subjects were older than 65 years old, 5 of whom were males. All the vaccinated patients were pluricomorbid and two of them suffered from a type of immunodeficiency. Information on the type of influenza vaccine is not available. Details of the clinical presentation and vaccination status of patients admitted to UHU are summarized in Ta * Immunocompromised cases included: 1 patient affected by Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID), 1 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient, and 2 solid organ transplant recipients; Â° metabolic conditions included: obesity, malnutrition, chronic liver disease (including cirrhosis and alcoholic liver disease), alcoholism, dyslipidemia, and glucose intolerance selected. Oral antibiotics are the preferred choice; parenteral treatment should be selected in the case of severe pneumonia. The duration of the treatment should be decided according to clinical evolution. Generally, standard antibiotic duration for community-acquired pneumonia is adequate. Antibiotic escalation should be considered in the case of insufficient improvement within 72 hours. An algorithm to guide the management of Influenza cases is reported in Figure 1 .
