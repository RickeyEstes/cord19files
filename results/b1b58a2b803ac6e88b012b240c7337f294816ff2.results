Of 266 MERS-CoV patients analyzed, 71.8% were male, 94% were reported from Saudi Arabia, and 30.5% were directly exposed to camels. The median diagnostic delay was 5 days (interquartile [IQR] range: 3-8 days), median patient delay was 4 days (IQR range: 2-7 days), and median health-system delay was 2 days (IQR range: 1-2 days). The crude RR for various delays of MERS-CoV diagnosis is reported in Table 2 . Saudi Arabia as a reporting country was a significant predictor of shorter diagnostic delay, patient delay, and health-system delay. Patients who had exposure to MERS-CoV cases were associated with shorter diagnostic delay, patient delay, and health-system delay. Health-care workers were associated with shorter diagnostic delay and patient delay. Patients who had exposure to camels and those who consumed camel milk were associated with longer diagnostic delay and shorter health system delay. Older patients, males, those who had comorbidities, and those who had died were associated with longer health-system delay. The adjusted relative ratio (aRR) for various delays of MERS-CoV diagnosis is reported in Table 3 . Saudi Arabia as a reporting country was a significant predictor of shorter diagnostic delay (aRR, 0.549; 95% CI, 0.430âˆ’0.701), shorter patient delay (aRR, 0.688; 95% CI, Table 2 Bivariate analysis of factors associated with delays in MERS-CoV diagnosis, patient, and health system-related delays (N = 266).
