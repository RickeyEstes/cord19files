3.1. Expression of IL-10eGFP in NSV-infected mice occurs primarily in the brain, not the draining cervical lymph nodes IL-10 is an important immunoregulatory molecule during a variety of infections (Couper et al., 2008; Wack et al., 2011) . During virus infections of the CNS IL-10 plays an important role in limiting inflammation and protecting against death during acute infections and protecting against demyelination during chronic infections (Lin et al., 1998; Trandem et al., 2011a; Zhao et al., 2014) . Previously, we showed that IL-10 was an important cytokine for immune modulation and protection during NSV infection (Kulcsar et al., 2015; Kulcsar et al., 2014) . To determine the cell type(s) responsible for IL-10 production, we utilized VertX IL-10 mRNA reporter mice . VertX mice express eGFP under control of an internal ribosomal entry site placed immediately downstream of the stop codon and before the poly-A site for IL-10 and do not affect IL-10 protein production . The cervical lymph nodes (CLNs) and brains of VertX mice infected intranasally with 1 × 10 5 pfu NSV were evaluated for cells expressing IL-10eGFP. There were few IL-10eGFP + cells in the CLNs at any time after infection. Three days after infection, 0.44% of cells were IL-10eGFP + and this increased to only 1.41% at 5 d and 1.58% at 7 d after infection (Fig. 1A, B) . In the brain, the number and frequency of IL-10eGFP + cells increased substantially during the course of infection. Few IL-10eGFP + cells were present 3 d after infection (0.1%, 430 cells/ brain). However, by 5 d the number of IL-10eGFP + cells began to increase (0.61%, 8 × 10 3 cells) and the increase continued through 7 d with 8.5% of cells and approximately 4 × 10 5 IL-10eGFP + cells in the brain of each animal (Fig. 1A, C) . Therefore, IL-10-producing cells were found infrequently in the CLNs, but often in the brains of NSV-infected mice and were most abundant 7 d after infection, a time of peak inflammation.
