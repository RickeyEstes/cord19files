From Table  1 . Infections involved equal numbers of male and female travelers and occurred predominantly in young travelers (mean age 28.5 years; 70% were <30 and 7% were >50 years of age). Half of the travelers were Singaporeans returning from abroad, and the other half were travelers from other countries. As shown in Figure 1 , the regions where travelers were exposed to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus changed rapidly during the 5-week period of study. Most of the cases in epidemiologic weeks 21 and 22 (May 24 through June 6) were in patients who acquired their infection in the United States; however, within 2 weeks, this had changed dramatically, with a large proportion of cases coming from Australasia in epidemiologic week 23 (June 7-13). Within a week, this situation changed yet again; most infections originated from Southeast Asia by epidemiologic weeks 24-25 (June 14-27). The fi rst cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 detected among travelers arriving from the Philippines (week 22), Thailand (week 23), and Indonesia (week 25) indicated potential community transmission in those countries earlier than offi cial announcements. Infections from Southeast Asian countries accounted for 29% of imported cases dur-ing the containment phase; the Philippines were linked to 23% cases, mostly in weeks 24-25. Travel duration refl ects the distance between the regions of exposure and Singapore (Table 1) . Of the 116 case-patients, 19% had a short travel duration (<3 hours), and 20% had a long travel duration (>15 hours). Although most case-patients became ill after arrival at their destination, 25% were ill before travel and boarded their fl ight despite symptomatic illness, and 15% became ill while traveling. Doctors based at the airport referred 15 (12.9%) of the 116 patients to TTSH; thermal scanners used to screen arriving passengers had detected fever in 14 of these 15 patients. Of the remaining 101 patients, 51 (44%) self-reported to the screening center at TTSH and 50 (43%) were referred by doctors in the community. At the time of examination, 72% of case-patients had temperatures >37.5°C. However, only 61.2% had temperatures >37.8°C and 54% had temperatures >38°C, the temperature criteria used in the US CDC and WHO ILI case defi nitions, respectively. Considering the entire symptom complex, 51% of patients would have fulfi lled ILI criteria as defi ned by the US CDC, and 44% would have fulfi lled the WHO criteria (11, 12) . As the pandemic shifted toward Asian ports of embarkation, the number of case-patients with travel durations of <8 hours increased (Figure 2, panel A) . The time of symptom onset relative to arrival in Singapore is shown in Figure 2, panel B ; the fi gure does not include information for patients who were symptomatic before embarkation. Time of symptom onset was progressively closer to the time of arrival in Singapore for those arriving from longer distances (p = 0.001). Patients with longer travel durations were also more likely to have onset of symptoms before arrival (p = 0.04). Port of embarkation, clinical symptoms, and duration of travel did not predict delay to isolation ( Table 2) . However, case-patients referred to TTSS by airport doctors had a shorter time to isolation (0.76 days) than self-referred patients or those referred by other sources (1.6-1.9 days). The number of case-patients referred by airport doctors increased over the 5-week period, but they represent only 12% of all travel-associated cases ( Figure 3 ). Although the mean duration to isolation did not increase signifi cantly over the study period, total numbers of case-patients with delays to isolation increased as the volume of travel-associated cases rose.
