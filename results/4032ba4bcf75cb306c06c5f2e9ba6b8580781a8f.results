Derivation cohort. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics. The study included patients with ALI who had 1) predicted [iSN-aPTB]: (G1; n = 26) or 2) [non-aPTB-PD] (G2; n = 233) ( Table 1 ). The mean ages in the G1 and G2 groups were 71.38 and 70.22 years, respectively. Males comprised 53.8% and 67.3% of patients in the G1 and G2 groups, respectively. Clinical characteristics were similar between the G1 and G2 groups, including age, sex, previous TB, diabetes mellitus (DM), steroid use, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), liver cirrhosis, uremia, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, lymphopenia, neutropenia, levels of white blood cells, and other clinical signs and symptoms. The G1 group had a significantly higher percentage of COPD and hypoalbuminemia compared with the G2 group (both P < 0.05). Patients in the G1 group also had significantly higher ALI scores, APACHE 2 scores, ante-cibum (AC) sugar, aspartate transaminase (GOT), alanine transaminase (GPT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine, but had lower levels of hemoglobin, albumin, PaO 2 : F I O 2 , and sodium compared with the G2 group (all P < 0.05) ( Table 1) . Imaging results. CXR results indicated that the frequency of the consolidation/patch/nodules of the right/left upper lung field were higher in G1 patients than in G2 patients (73.1% vs. 38.6%, P value < 0.001; Figs 1 and 2). Cavitation of the right/left upper or lower lung field was also more prevalent in G1 patients than in G2 patients (upper: 23.1% vs. 1.3%, P < 0.001; lower: 26.9% vs. 2.6%, P < 0.001) ( Table 2) . Among the HRCT morphology findings, the frequency of consolidation in the superior segment (s6) of the right lower lobe/left lower lobe [RLL/LLL] was greater in G1 patients than in G2 patients (92.3% vs. 6.0%, P < 0.001) ( Table 2 ). The frequency of clusters of nodules/mass or cavitation in all regions of the lung analyzed was greater in G1 patients compared with G2 patients (all P â‰¤ 0.030). The frequency of military/reticular nodules (42.3% vs. 3.4%, P < 0.001) and pleural effusion was greater in G1 patients than in G2 patients (34.6% vs. 15.5%, P = 0.025) ( Table 2 ).
