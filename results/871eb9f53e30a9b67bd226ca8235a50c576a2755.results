sample selection and work outline. In the beginning of the winter season, the identity of the viruses causing ILS, other than RSV and influenza, was unknown ( Fig. 1) . Later in the winter two epidemic waves were noticed, RSV and then influenza. However, a higher percentage of patients still suffered from a respiratory infection of unknown etiology, with clinical symptoms compatible with viral infection (Fig. 1) . We therefore set out to develop a general and robust approach to identify the unknown viruses responsible for ILS. Three possibilities were considered: (1) The cause of the ILS is an unknown virus or a known virus not yet associated with respiratory illnesses; (2) the cause of the ILS is a virus not commonly tested in the laboratory; (3) the cause of the ILS is a known virus that causes respiratory infection that cannot be identified in the routine RT PCR tests due to variability. The workflow of the approach is shown in Fig. 2 . Initially, qRT-PCR for influenza and RSV was performed on 300 samples obtained from the beginning of the 2013-2014 winter season (Fig. 1) ; 12 samples were positive. The remaining 288 samples (Fig. 2) , were then assayed by qRT-PCR for: rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza 3, bocavirus and coronaviruses; 234 samples were found to be positive (Fig. 2) . In the next step, the (Fig. 2) . The samples were pooled and NGS was performed (Fig. 2 ). Next-generation sequencing of the pooled samples. The resulting NGS data consisted of ~9 M paired-end reads of 150 bp DNA fragments. Reads similar to human or known bacterial genomes were filtered out, and the remaining reads were tested for similarity to viruses from known databases, as previously done 11, 34 . Among the 9M reads, 27% found to be human genomic material, and ~61% mapped to bacterial genomes were filtered out, leaving ~1.1 million reads to be further analyzed. When applying Bowtie 2.0 to match the remaining reads to known viruses, approximately 34,000 mapped to known viruses, with 29,000 reads mapping to phi X 174 bacteriophage, which is a control sample of Illumina sequencing. The remaining ~1 million unmapped reads were assembled into larger segments (contigs). Assuming that reads from a pathogen will be abundant enough in the sample to create somewhat long contigs, 8387 contigs with more than 350 nucleotides were detected and used to query the non-redundant nucleotide and protein databases in NCBI. The vast majority of contigs mapped to a bacterial or a phage source. The remaining viral-mapped contigs were mapped to influenza B and Torque teno virus (TTV) and one contig mapped to human picobirnavirus. There was a small number of contigs that mapped to plant, fungi, animal and protists. Detection of known viruses. We next focused on the 5,000 reads that mapped to known viruses. Of these, ~2000 mapped to bacterial phages and ~3000 to other viruses. From the latter reads, three viruses (adenovirus, RSV and influenza B) that were included as positive samples in our pooled sample, were detected (Fig. 4) . Notably, the average coverage of the positive control viruses was quite low: sixteen reads per base for adenovirus and one read per base for RSV and influenza B. Additional viruses identified included parainfluenza virus 1, TTV, a virus which is frequently present in humans, and a cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV), present in vegetables like cucumber and watermelon and is not known to cause illness in humans ( Fig. 4 and Table 1 ). To validate that the newly identified viruses were indeed present in the tested samples and to determine precisely which sample was infected with each of these viruses, qRT-PCR was then performed on the individual samples. As can be seen in Fig. 5 , TTV was detected in 23 of 31 samples (20 unidentified samples and the 3 control samples). TTV titer was high in two unidentified samples and low in the rest of the samples detected. The control viruses that were included in the pooled assay sample were identified only in the control samples (Fig. 5) . One patient (number 10, Fig. 5 ) was infected with parainfluenza 1 virus and three patients with CGMMV, that is not known to cause illness in humans (Fig. 5) . Human picobirnavirus was detected in one of the contigs assembled. This virus causes gastroenteritis symptoms and is not associated with ILS 35 .
