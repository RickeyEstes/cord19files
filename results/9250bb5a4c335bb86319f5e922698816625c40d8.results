During the study, a total of 91 lung tissue samples and 96 nasal swabs were obtained from the 2 groups of camels (Table 1) (Table 1) . All animals from both groups appeared healthy on visual inspection except for 2. These 8-month-old dromedary camel calves, located outside of the Al Omran abattoir, exhibited purulent nasal and lachrymal discharge; MERS-CoV RNA was detected in nasal swab specimens from these 2 calves (Figure 1 ). MERS-CoV RNA was more often detected in the lung and nasal cavity of young camels than adult camels (Table 2)
