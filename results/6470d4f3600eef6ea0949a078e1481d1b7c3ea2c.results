The specificity of the SAFV RT-rtPCR was evaluated using clinical specimens previously tested, some of which were and found to be positive for each of the commonly considered respiratory viruses and it did not cross-react with any of these viruses. The assay's analytical sensitivity was between 40 and 100 RNA copies per 20 L reaction and the assay was linear across a 10 log 10 dynamic range (Fig. 3) . The RT-rtPCR identified 8 distinct cases of SAFV. Most cases had fever reported on presentation; one case (QPID11-0005) had coinciding sore throat, headache, neck stiffness, diarrhoea and vomiting. Five cases were able to be genotyped (four SAFV-2s and a SAFV-3; GenBank Accession numbers JQ820263-JQ820267) and three were not. The latter may have been related to mismatches we observed between the VP1 primers and some SAFV genotypes or lower viral loads (all T7 RNA polymerase promoter region-underlined; S/AS -sense/antisense primers; S1/AS1 -round 1 sense/antisense primer set; S2/AS2 -round 2 sense/antisense, nested primer set. typed specimens had C T values â‰¤33 while the three untypeable specimens had C T values >33). No SAFV detections were made from winter or spring (May-December; Fig. 2 ). Most (n = 6; 75%) of the SAFV-positive specimens were from children two years of age or younger; an age group that comprised 39.2% of the entire specimen population. Specimens from this age group were 3.9 times as likely as those from older patients to be positive for SAFV but the risk failed to attain statistical significance (1.2% vs 0.4%, RR 3.6, 95% CI 0.66-25.4, p = 0.152). Specimens from males were 1.5 times as likely as those from females to be positive for SAFV (0.9% vs 0.6%, RR 1.5, 95% CI 0.3-7.7, p = 0.73). Over half of SAFV detections (n = 5; 62.5%) were in the presence of another virus (0.8% vs 0.7%, RR 1.159, 95% CI 0.244-6.087, p = 1.00). Similar or greater numbers of SAFV detections were made than of influenza C virus (n = 1), HPIV-1 (n = 9), HPIV-2 (n = 4), coronavirus 229E/HKU1 (n = 0), NL63 (n = 3), or HPIV-4 (n = 9) detections were apparent.
