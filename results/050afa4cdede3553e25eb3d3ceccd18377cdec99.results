We identified 66 patients with influenza-associated hospitalization, and included 21 patients with influenza virus-induced LRI for analysis (Fig. 1) . Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients at the time of admission. Males predominated (n ¼ 15, 71%), and the median age was 7 years. Nine (42%) patients had a history of asthma and all patients with a neurologic disease (n ¼ 4, 19%) had cerebral palsy, two of whom had had a tracheostomy. Only four (19%) patients received the influenza vaccine during this season. Patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit, required mechanical ventilation, and required ECMO comprised 57%, 33%, and 14% of the study pool, respectively. Six patients received the diagnosis of PB and required mechanical ventilation, while among these three also required ECMO for pulmonary support. Table 2 shows the details of these cases. Major underlying conditions in the cases with PB were asthma (n ¼ 5, 83%) and food allergy (n ¼ 3, 50%). Among the patients with asthma, two had moderate persistent asthma and were using inhaled corticosteroid as a controller, and three patients had intermittent asthma which did not require a controller. The median of white blood cell count on admission was 15790/ml (range 9730/mle19050/ml), which were neutrophil predominant (median: 91%, range: 72%e96%) with eosinophils accounting for less than 2% (median: 0.6%, range 0.1%e1.9%). Eighteen (86%) cases were due to influenza type A infection, and three were due to type B infection. Specimens from the six patients with PB were analyzed by real-time qPCR and identified as H1N1pdm09 infections. Other pathogens were not detected by the FTDRP21 multiplex PCR assay. The results of the phylogenetic analysis of the HA and NA genes are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 . The genes from all of these cases belonged to subclades 6B1 and 6B.2, which were predominant in the 2015e2016 season. We also performed full genome sequencing for two specimens obtained from the patient 2 and 5 who required ECMO. The sequence data for the NA gene revealed that patient 2 was infected with the oseltamivirresistant H275Y mutant virus from the specimen taken before the treatment of neuraminidase inhibitor. Although patient 2 was treated with peramivir, the duration of intubation and hospitalization was similar to that in patients infected by the non-resistant strain. No other known relevant mutations were identified in the analysis in patient 2 and 5. We divided patients with influenza A into two groups, those with or without PB and compared their demographics to identify the risk factors for developing PB, which might be considered a more severe form of influenza-related LRI (Table 3) . Among the covariates, the presence of allergic diseases was more commonly observed in patients with PB [6/6 (100%) vs 3/12 (25%): p ¼ 0.009].
