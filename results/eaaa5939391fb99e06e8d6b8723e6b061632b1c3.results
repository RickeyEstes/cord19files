Step 1 -Literature search and selection of recommendations The Medline search for international literature regarding quality indicators and recommendations for good quality response to an infectious disease outbreak resulted in 151 unique publications (two identical publications were removed), see Figure 1 . Based on title and abstract, 106 of these international publications were excluded while applying exclusion criteria. The remaining 47 publications were read full text. From 11 [24, 26, 27, 33, 37, 38, 48, 51, 58, 60, 64] out of these 47 articles, we extracted 35 recommendations. The national specialists on infectious disease preparedness-and control plans provided 43 grey literature documents (see Additional file 1), from which we extracted 1057 recommendations. In total, we extracted 1092 recommendations from both the international and the grey literature. After removal of doubles and of recommendations that were not executed by ID-control professionals and disaster emergency responders, 656 recommendations remained of which 35 were extracted from the international literature. These recommendations were discussed with all researchers involved in this study to make the recommendations generic so that they apply to all outbreaks irrespective of the nature of the causative pathogen and removed doubles while applying the inclusion criteria. This resulted in 226 recommendations (155 for ID-control professionals and 71 for disaster emergency responders). Figure 2 displays the results from the consensus procedure. Step 2 -First questionnaire round Forty-four experts returned the first questionnaire (response rate 92%) containing the 226 recommendations resulting from step 1. After applying the RAND/University of California at Los Angeles agreement criteria, the first consensus round resulted in 138 "accepted" recommendations. Thirty-eight recommendations were found "not accepted", and therefore excluded. Thirty-one recommendations were marked as "to be further processed in the second questionnaire". Both the "accepted" recommendations and the "to be further processed in the second questionnaire" recommendations (N = 169) were subsequently included in the second questionnaire (discussed further in step 4). Nineteen recommendations were marked " to be discussed ", meaning that the experts did not reach consensus on the relevance or non-relevance of the items. These recommendations were further assessed in step 3. Step 3 -Consensus meeting In the third step, the expert panels could comment on recommendations with the label "to be discussed" in a consensus meeting. Fourteen ID-control professionals (14 out of 28) and 16 disaster emergency responders (16 out of 20) attended the consensus meeting. The IDcontrol professionals discussed nine recommendations, of which one was found not relevant, seven were found relevant after textual modification and one was found relevant without modification. The disaster emergency responders discussed ten recommendations of which two were found not relevant. Two recommendations were combined into one and as a result, seven recommendations were found relevant after textual modification. In total fifteen recommendations were accepted for further assessment. Step 4 -Second questionnaire round Recommendations were combined into one if the recommendations represented the same action but a different target group (for instance management of suspected case, case, confirmed case). This resulted in a reduction from 184 to 160 recommendations. The prioritization questionnaire consisted of 160 recommendations, of which 31 had to be appraised by both the disaster emergency responders and the ID-control professionals as in practice both could be made responsible for performing the recommended activity. Forty experts returned the second questionnaire (response rate 88.9%). As a result, the ID-control professionals selected 55 recommendations, the disaster emergency responders 21. In some cases both types of experts prioritized the same recommendation. Deleting those resulted in 69 unique recommendations from both expert groups. Step 5 -Second consensus meeting In the final consensus meeting, both expert panels were merged. Seventeen experts (17 out of 48) attended the consensus meeting. The group discussed the 69 recommendations resulting from step 4. Three recommendations were deleted, 1 newly added and 4 combined into 2. This resulted in 65 recommendations divided among 10 main domains ( Table 2)
