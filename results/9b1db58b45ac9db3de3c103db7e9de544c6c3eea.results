The three surveyed medical groups have some awareness of the attributes of general practice (e.g. comprehensiveness, first contact and coordination), but often misinterpret what being a GP entails. Five themes were identified through the FGDs and tested quantitatively for their prevalence with structured questionnaires. Firstly, the GPs' role as a comprehensive care provider was (mis)interpreted as an 'all-round doctor'. Secondly, the GP's responsibility as the first point of care was understood in two conflicting ways: private personal doctors of the rich and the powerful or village doctors for common people. Thirdly, referral was understood as simply guiding patients to appropriate departments within the hospital while the gatekeeping role was interpreted to involve GPs being peoples' health protectors rather than being also gatekeepers of specialty services. Traditional Chinese Medicine now further complicates the understanding of GPs. And lastly, the GPs' main responsibility was considered to be public health work.
