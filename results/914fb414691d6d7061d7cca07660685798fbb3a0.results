During phase I (April-May 2009), six focus groups were conducted with seven nurses from EHS and 29 staff from 16 RCHEs. The first focus group interview involved seven nurses from EHS. For the subsequent five focus groups, 29 HCWs from 16 RCHEs throughout the territory participated. The participating RCHEs had varying staff vaccination rates ranging from 36.7% to 92.3%. Among the 29 RCHE staff, six (20.6%) were persons in charge, 11 (38.0%) were nurses (registered nurses or enrolled nurses), six (20.7%) were HCWs, A five (17.3%) were care workers B and one (3.4%) was supporting staff not providing direct care to residents. The focus group data revealed that acceptance or refusal of influenza vaccination was determined by beliefs about efficacy and safety, as well as misconceptions about the vaccine. Lack of accessibility for night-shift staff was found to be an important obstacle for vaccine uptake. Selfprotection was more important than protection of residents in determining accepting attitudes toward vaccination. The data also revealed that the top three preferred vaccine programs were education talks, media publicity and information pamphlets/posters or reminders. These findings informed the development of the VPP in phase II. In phase III, 1419 staff from the intervention and control groups returned the questionnaire (pre-test), providing a response rate of 82.7%. For sample description, see Table 1 . Logistic regression showed that vaccine acceptance was significantly associated with beliefs about vaccine efficacy (P < 0.001), years of service in RCHE (more likely for those with >1-5 years, P = 0.001), staff position (more likely for those in charge, P < 0.001) and providing direct resident care (P < 0.001) (see Table 2 ). Among those who would receive vaccination, 95.1% believed in its effectiveness for self-protection while 47.3% believed in protection for others. Among those who declined vaccination, the common demotivators were fear of side effects (53.4%), beliefs that no Care worker provides personal care to residents such as bathing and feeding. Seasonal flu vaccine promotion Healthcare Infection self-protection was provided by influenza vaccination (29.1%), unfit physical condition (17.8%) and fear of injection (17.1%). Out of 683 staff in the intervention group who have been invited to participate in the interactive talk, 462 actually joined the talk and completed the questionnaire (post-test) with a response rate of 67.6%. Their knowledge and attitudes scores toward influenza vaccination improved significantly from 5.8 to 7.9 (P = 0.001). Compared with 2008/2009 data, the actual mean staff vaccination rates in 2009/2010 increased significantly in both the intervention (from 39.4% to 59.6%; P < 0.001) and control groups (from 36.3% to 47.6%; P = 0.008) while the overall staff vaccination rates in local RCHEs remained stable. Staff from RCHEs in the intervention group had a higher vaccination rate than the control group (59.6% versus 47.6%, P = 0.072) which was marginally statistically significant.
