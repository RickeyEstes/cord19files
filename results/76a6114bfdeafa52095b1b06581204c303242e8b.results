The percentage of samples positive for hMPV and other respiratory virus during the study period is shown in Fig. 1a . hMPV was detected in 206 (2.2%) samples, with a detection rate of 3.89% in patients <1 year of age, 2.19% in those 1-4 years old, and 0.7-1.1% in older age patients (Fig. 1b) . The majority of the respiratory samples positive for hMPV (n = 87; 44%) were in children <1 year of age. Thirty-three (0.6%) of 5500 respiratory samples from adults (>18 years old) were positive for hMPV. Within this group, eight (24%) had severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) and four (12%) were managed in an intensive therapy unit (ITU), two of whom died. Mixed infections involving hMPV were found in five samples, with corona virus being the major co-pathogen. of Crohn's disease (for which she received steroids and azathioprine), developed a severe lower respiratory tract infection when she was hospitalized for an exacerbation of Crohn's disease in mid-January 2006. The cough and difficulty in breathing, which was initially mild, gradually worsened; she then rapidly de-saturated and required supportive ventilation. Chest X-ray initially showed right middle lobe consolidation that progressed to involve both lung fields diffusely within 48 h. hMPV was strongly positive by RT-PCR on the broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL). She also had a low positive rhinovirus by RT-PCR in the same sample. She recovered completely after withdrawal of azathioprine and reduction in the dosage of steroids.
