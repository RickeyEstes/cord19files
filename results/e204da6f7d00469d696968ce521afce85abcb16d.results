Participants 1332 patients were screened in the AMU during the study period and 62 patients recruited; 9 additional patients were recruited via the microbiology laboratory with confirmed viral RTI during the expanded second phase of recruitment. A further 10 patients were approached but declined to be enrolled to the study. Fig 2 shows the flow of patients through the study. Table 2 shows the characteristics of the study participants. There are several statistically significant differences between the groups: an unequal sex distribution; a significantly higher respiratory rate, lower oxygen saturation, higher total white count and neutrophil count, and lower lymphocyte count in the bacterial group; and more benzylpenicillin therapy in the bacterial group.
