titration of Antigen Concentration. A monoplex assay for each hCoV recN conjugated bead set was developed and standardized to determine optimum antigen quantity per bead coupling reaction, optimum serum dilution and assay cut-off mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) values. Each bead set was conjugated with 1.0 µg, 2.5 µg, or 5.0 µg of antigen per 100 µl of conjugation reaction (1.25 × 10 6 beads). A checkerboard titration assay was carried out for each antigen against a series of 2-fold (1:100-1:800) positive and negative control sera. The optimum working antigen amounts were determined to be 1.0 µg for SARS-CoV recN, His-BoNT, NL63 recN; 2.5 µg for 229E recN, MERS-CoV recN, OC43 recN3; pET E. coli, and 5.0 µg for HKU1 recN per conjugation reaction (1.25 × 10 6 beads) (Fig. 1 ). Based on positive serum control titration results, optimum dilutions for each antigen were determined to be 1:400 for OC43, NL63, HKU1 and SARS-CoV; and 1:800 for 229E, and MERS-CoV (Fig. 1) . The optimum antigen quantities and positive control serum dilutions were selected based highest signal to background ratio, most reproducible results and economical usage of antigen stocks. Correlation between monoplex and multiplex assay. We compared the MFI values generated by monoplex assays with multiplex assay for each antigen to investigate possible loss of sensitivity due to drop in MFI values. Positive control serum pools for each hCoV were serially diluted in 2-fold dilutions (1:100-1:51200) and screened using monoplex and multiplex microsphere immunoassays. In each assay format, 200 beads (100 beads in duplicate) were counted for each recN conjugated bead set. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine correlation coefficient for each recN antigen. For all recN bead sets, statistically significant correlations were observed between the monoplex and multiplex formats with a correlation coefficient (R 2 ) ranging from 0.88 to 0.97 (Fig. 2) .
