Ectodomain shedding of ACE2 in mouse PT cells ACE2 is a type 1 integral membrane protein with a catalytically active ectodomain, which can be shed from the cell surface and retain its activity in the extracellular space [11] [12] [13] . In primary cultures of mouse PT cells, a time-dependent increase in ACE2 enzymatic activity was detected in the media, suggesting constitutive shedding ( Figure 1 ). As shown in Figure 2A , in lysates from primary cultures of mouse PT cells, ACE2 was detected as a protein of ,100 kDa by immunoblot, consistent with its size as detected in mouse kidney cortex [23] . However, in concentrated media from mouse PT cells, immunoblot analysis revealed 2 fragments for ACE2, at ,90 kDa and ,70 kDa. Further experiments determined if ACE2 fragments could be shed from PT cells derived from ACE2 gene KO mice, transfected with a plasmid expressing the human ACE2 cDNA. ACE2 was not detected by immunoblot in either cell lysates or media from untransfected PT cells derived from ACE2 KO mice. By contrast, transfection with the human ACE2 plasmid resulted in detection of the expected single band for human ACE2 at ,120 kDa in cell lysates [17] , while the cell media contained 2 bands at ,110 kDa and ,95 kDa ( Figure 2A ). Furthermore, while untransfected cells and cells transfected with an empty pcDNA3 plasmid demonstrated no measurable ACE2 activity in the media, cells transfected with the human ACE2 cDNA had significant levels of ACE2 activity in the media after 48 hrs ( Figure 2B ; P,0.001 vs untransfected control or empty pcDNA3 vector; n = 4).
