A total of 1743 MERS cases that had been recorded in the line list at the end of October, 2016, including 1393 from KSA, 80 from UAE, 186 from South Korea, and 84 from other 11 countries, were enrolled for analysis. The majority of patients in other countries had travelled to KSA and UAE prior to the onset MERS. Descriptive results on demographic characteristics, comorbidity, and contact patterns are provided in Table 1 . Fatal cases in patients with MERS were older (P < 0.001) and predominated in males (P < 0.001). Among the 1223 cases where comorbid conditions were reported, patients with comorbidity were at elevated risk for being dead compared with those without (11.1% vs 48.3%, P < 0.001). Note that cases with unknown comorbid conditions were similar to those without. When the history of contact patterns were categorized into camel contact, other animals, and presumed human, there was no statistical difference in outcome across these contact patterns (P = 0.476). The fatality rate was higher in the period before Mar. 20, 2014 , when compared to after (P = 0.004). The fatality rate was the highest in KSA (34.7%), followed by others (32.1%), South Korea (19.9%), and the lowest in UAE (15.0%), however, the difference in fatality rates across countries was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The results of univariate analysis are listed in the first column of Table 2 . The crude survival curves by countries and comorbidity status are presented in panel (a) and (b) in Fig. 1 , respectively. The survival curves for KSA, other countries, and South Korea were similar with each other, with the survival probabilities lower than UAE ( Fig. 1(a) ), corresponding to the higher HRs of these countries listed in the results of univariate analysis in the first column of Table 2 . The survival probability of subjects without comorbidity at 21 days was around 90%, as opposed to 50% for those with comorbidities ( Fig. 1(b) ). Although both models provided acceptable fits to the data (likelihood ratio test; P = 0.80 for the Weibull distribution and P = 0.76 for the exponential distribution, Fig. 2 ), model selection by DIC values (see Supplementary material G) suggests that the model based on the Weibull distribution was superior. The Weibull distribution was thus selected as the shape of the baseline mortality of the MERS cases for the evaluation of the fatality rate. The estimated results of the multivariate analysis using Weibull proportional hazards regression model analysis with fixed effect are listed in Table 2 . The shape parameter was greater than 1 (Shape (v): 1.38, 95% CI: 1.29, 1.47) indicating the daily risk of dying from MERS increased with time at a decreasing rate ( Fig. 3(a) ). Notably, the incremental change of daily death rate was most prominent during the first week since disease onset with an average of 13% and then stabilized for the remaining two weeks with an average of 3% ( Fig. 3(b) and Supplementary material H). Although male patients had a higher crude risk of dying from MERS, the effect of sex was not significant after taking into account the effect of comorbidity and age in the fixed effect model (adjusted HR (aHR):
