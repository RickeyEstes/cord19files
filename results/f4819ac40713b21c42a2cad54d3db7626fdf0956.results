We have isolated 12 phenanthrenes from the medicinal plant Bletilla striata. The structures and names of the phenanthrenes were listed (Table 1) ; the chromatogram ( Fig. 2) and spectra (Additional file 1), as well as the spectral data for all the compounds (Additional file 1) were also provided. The compounds 1, 9, 10 and 12 have been reported before, while the compounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 11 were new discoveries of our study.
