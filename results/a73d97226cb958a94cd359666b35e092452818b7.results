GBF1 but not BIG1/2 function is partially required for SM acquisition but dispensable for C. trachomatis replication In an RNA interference (RNAi) screen for host factors required for C. trachomatis L2 infection of Drosophila S2 cells, homologs of Arf1 and its associated GEFs, GBF1 (localized to the cis-Golgi) and BIG1 (localized to the trans-Golgi) were identified [53] . Since Chlamydia is thought to occupy a post Golgi compartment and Author Summary C. trachomatis is the leading cause of non-congenital blindness in developing countries and is the number one cause of sexually transmitted disease and non-congenital infertility in Western countries. The capacity of Chlamydia infections to lead to infertility and blindness, their association with chronic diseases, and the extraordinary prevalence and array of these infections make them public concerns of primary importance. This pathogen must establish a protective membrane-bound niche and acquire essential lipids from the host cell during infection in order to survive and replicate. This study identifies novel mechanisms by which C. trachomatis hijacks various lipid trafficking proteins for distinct roles during intracellular development. Disruption of these lipid trafficking pathways results in alterations in the growth and stability of its protective niche as well as a defect in replication. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of these hostpathogen interactions will lead to rational approaches for the development of novel therapeutics, diagnostics, and preventative strategies. since C. trachomatis induced Golgi fragmentation enhances replication [6, 21, 22] , we tested the hypothesis that spatiallylocalized Arf1 function within the Golgi might be important for SM acquisition and/or for C. trachomatis intracellular growth. We first examined the localization of Arf1-GFP, GBF1, and BIG1 during C. trachomatis infection of HeLa cells. We found that GBF1 and BIG1 were localized to the fragmented Golgi around the inclusion in C. trachomatis-infected cells and appeared to maintain their cis and trans polarity, as observed in uninfected cells ( Figure 1A ). GBF1 ( Figure 1B ) and BIG1 (data not shown) were primarily localized adjacent to but not on the inclusion membrane. Similar results were obtained in cells expressing GFP-tagged GBF1 (data not shown). In contrast, Arf1-GFP was found not only on Golgi vesicles adjacent to the inclusion but was also localized to the inclusion membrane, where it formed a thin rim of circumferential staining ( Figure 1B) , consistent with previously published results [40, 41] . We noted a striking concentration of Arf1-GFP at the region of two closely apposed inclusion membranes ( Figure 1B ). To evaluate whether GBF1 or BIG1/2 activity was required for Arf1-GFP recruitment to the inclusion membrane, we treated cells with BFA, which inhibits both GBF1 and BIGs, and examined the localization Arf1-GFP and GBF1. Exposure of the cells to BFA resulted in dispersion of GBF1 and Arf1-GFP throughout the cell and loss of the circumferential rim staining on the inclusion; however, BFA had no effect on Arf1-GFP localization at abutting inclusion membranes ( Figure 1B ). This finding suggests that GBF1 and/or BIG1/2 activities are required for Arf1 recruitment to the outer region of the inclusion but that they are not necessary for Arf1 maintenance at closely apposed inclusions. To determine the specific contribution of the cisversus trans-Golgi compartments to SM acquisition, HeLa cells were depleted of GBF1 or BIG1/2 by siRNA, infected with C. trachomatis, and then examined by live-cell microscopy for SM acquisition as described in the Materials and Methods. Protein depletion was assessed by western blot analysis ( Figure 1C ). As shown in Figure 1D , labeled lipids were readily visible inside bacterial inclusions in control siRNA-treated cells and in cells depleted of BIG1 and/or BIG2. In contrast, depletion of GBF1 resulted in ,60% reduction in SM acquisition by the inclusion (Figures 1D and S1A; p,0.001). SM acquisition was similarly reduced in cells treated with Golgicide A (GCA), a GBF1-specific inhibitor [37] and with BFA ( [17] and Figures 1E and S1B). As GCA targets GBF1 selectively and does not inhibit BIGS, these results suggest that the relevant target of BFA during C. trachomatis L2 infection is GBF1. We next tested whether GBF1 or BIG1/2 were required for intracellular growth. GBF1 depletion (Figure S1B) or inhibition with GCA or BFA ( Figure S2 ) resulted in inclusions that were smaller than those observed in control siRNA-or untreated cells. Quantitation of inclusion size, as described in Materials and Methods, revealed that the average inclusion size in GBF1depleted cells was decreased by 40% (p,0.001) compared to control siRNA-treated cells ( Figure S1D ). In contrast, depletion of BIG1 and/or BIG2 gave rise to inclusions that were slightly larger than those observed in control siRNA depleted cells (Figures S1C and S1D). Despite the changes in inclusion size, depletion of any of the Arf1 GEFS did not decrease production of progeny; in fact, a small increase in progeny was observed ( Figure 1F ). The reason for the increase in progeny is not currently known. Together, these results demonstrate that GBF1, but not BIG1/2 function, is required for vesicle-mediated SM acquisition and inclusion growth but is dispensable for bacterial replication. These findings indicate that the impact of disrupting GBF1 function on SM acquisition is not an indirect result of altering Arf1-dependent trafficking in the trans-Golgi, since depletion of BIG1 and/or BIG2 did not reduce SM acquisition or inclusion growth. We note that in Drosophila S2 cells, depletion of either GBF1 or the single BIG1 was sufficient to decrease inclusion formation [53] ; this finding may reflect differences in Golgi organization between Drosophila S2 and mammalian cells, and/or it may reflect the fact that these proteins may have additional roles beyond the secretory pathway in host cells.
