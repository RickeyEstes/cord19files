In total, 33 sequencing primers were designed and used to sequence approximately 90% of the spike genes of human coronavirus 229E isolates ATCC VR-74, LRI 281 and A162 (when compared to the published human coronavirus 229E 'LP' spike gene sequence Raabe et al., 1990) . Six of these 33 sequencing primers (i.e. JH1, JH2, JH3, JH4, JH5 and JH6) were also used in the initial human coronavirus 229E spike gene PCR protocol, whilst the remaining 27 primers were used as sequencing primers alone. Sequence data was collected from both the sense and antisense strands of human coronavirus 229E spike gene PCR products.
