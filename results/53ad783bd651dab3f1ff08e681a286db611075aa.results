3.1. The RNA adjuvant affects genes related to the innate immune responses, T cell activation, and chemotaxis similar to poly(I:C) in hPBMCs To investigate the adjuvant effect, we treated hPBMCs with the RNA adjuvant and used poly(I:C) as a positive control, finding that the RNA adjuvant induced Th1-and Th2-related cytokine release similar to poly(I:C) (Fig. 1A) . We then compared the transcriptome profiles of RNA adjuvant-and poly(I:C)-treated hPBMCs by RNA sequencing. Control, poly(I:C), and RNA adjuvant treatment formed a separate cluster without any bias (Fig. 1B) , with scatter plots of gene profiling confirming that changes in geneexpression between the RNA adjuvant and poly(I:C) groups were not greater than those between the control and RNA adjuvant groups at 6-and 24-h post-treatment (p 0.05; fold-change ! 2) (Fig. 1B) . To investigate the biological pathways associated with genes affected by the RNA adjuvant, we analyzed gene-expression patterns using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/mapper.html) (Fig. 1C ) and the network of genes involved in each pathway based on the STRING database (Fig. 1D) . After 6-h, similar biological pathways were affected by RNA adjuvant and poly(I:C) treatment (Supplementary Fig. 2) , and heat maps of innate-immune-related genes [type 1 and 2 IFNs and TLR-myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (Myd88)], as well as T cell activation and leukocyte chemotaxis, indicated similar expression patterns between the two groups (Fig. 1C) . TLR2, TLR3, TLR7, IRF7, and NF-jB among the TLR related genes were induced, and IL-6 and IL-15 among T cell activation related genes and STAT 1 and 3 among multiple transcriptional factors function as key players in the RNA adjuvant group (Fig. 1D) .
