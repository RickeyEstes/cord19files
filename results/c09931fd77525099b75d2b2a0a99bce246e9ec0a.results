The data of 45 patients were evaluated. Fifteen of those patients were admitted with H1N1 and 30 were admitted with CAP. The patients with H1N1 were younger (34.3±10.9 years versus 55.9±16.4 years in patients with CAP; p<0.001; Table 1 ). The proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (86.7% versus 13.3%; p<0.05) and the mortality rate were higher in the H1N1 group than in the CAP group (53% versus 20%, respectively; p=0.056). In patients with H1N1, the most frequent comorbidities were obesity, 53%; cardiovascular disease, 20%; and diabetes, 20%. In the CAP group, the most frequent comorbidities were cardiovascular diseases, 40%; tobacco smoking, 30%; and diabetes, 27% (Table 1) . Obesity was significantly more prevalent in the H1N1 group (53%) than in the CAP group (6.6%), with p=0.02 (Table 1) Table 2 ). The PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio was significantly lower during the first week for patients with H1N1 (Table 3) . Nonsurvivors had lower PaO 2 /FiO 2 values (Day 2: 54±43 versus 165±94) and higher plasma creatinine levels (Day 3: 1.72±0.59 versus 1.06±0.27 mg/dL; p<0.05) compared with survivors ( Table 3 ). The platelet count values are described in table 3. Figure 1 shows the mean CRP (mg/ dL) and PaO 2 /FiO 2 for the H1N1 and CAP groups.
