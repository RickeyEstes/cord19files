2.1. Growth curves 2.1.1. Susceptibility of cultured human and murine astrocytes to VEEV To evaluate the validity of in vitro studies of VEEV attenuation in selected CNS cell lines as a parallel model of human infection, we infected cultured normal human astrocytes with three strains of VEEV that exhibit differential virulence characteristics in the murine model. Human astrocytes were susceptible to infection with all the VEEV strains tested (Fig. 1A) . ZPC738, the virulent enzootic strain of VEEV, replicated to titers up to 7.5 log 10 PFU/ml after 48 h (1 moi). Similarly, TC83, the cell culture adapted derivative of the TRD strain of VEEV, replicated up to titers of 9 log 10 PFU/ml over the same period (0.1 moi). SIN/ZPC, a recombinant strain of VEEV that is highly attenuated in the murine model, replicated overall at a lower rate than the other two strains, with titers up to 5.6 log 10 maximally (0.1 moi). Levels for infection titers of 10 moi were similar for all strains except that maximal titers occurred earlier. To dissect the multitude of factors that may contribute to the attenuation of VEEV in the murine model, we cultivated three distinct mouse astrocyte cell lines that differ in morphology (mASTI, II and III) and examined VEEV growth and the cytokine and chemokine profiles they elicited in vitro. These established murine astrocyte cell lines (Fig. 1B) are highly susceptible to VEEV infection, and virus replicated to titers of 3-9 log 10 PFU/ml after 48 h period (0.1 moi).
