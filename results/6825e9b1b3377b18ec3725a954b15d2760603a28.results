MyD88 2/2 mice are highly susceptible to rMA15 infection Since previous studies suggested MyD88-dependent inflammatory signaling was important for protection from severe disease caused by VSV, LCMV, and RSV, we evaluated the importance of MyD88 signaling in SARS-CoV pathogenesis [16, 18, 19, 21] . To assess the contribution of innate and adaptive immune responses in SARS-CoV-induced disease, age matched C57BL/6 (WT) (n = 14), congenic RAG-1 2/2 (n = 21), and congenic MyD88 2/2 (n = 16) mice were infected intranasally with 10 5 pfu of recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) and monitored for virus-induced morbidity and mortality. Infection of WT, RAG-1 2/2 , or MyD88 2/2 mice resulted in weight loss beginning at day 2 post-infection (Fig. 1A) . Infected WT and RAG-1 2/2 mice lost 1464% and 964% of starting body weight by 3 dpi, respectively, and returned to starting body weights by 5-6 dpi, indicating that the mice had recovered from rMA15 induced disease. In contrast to WT and RAG-1 2/2 mice, which began to recover weight after 3 dpi, infected MyD88 2/2 mice continued to lose weight after 3 dpi creating a significant weight disparity between WT and MyD88 2/2 mice (WT vs. MyD88 percent weight p = ,0.05 at 4, 5, and 6 dpi). While 100% of WT and 86% of RAG-1 2/2 mice survived the infection, .90% of MyD88 2/2 mice (n = 16) succumbed to infection by 6 dpi (Fig. 1B ). MyD88 plays a critical role in proinflammatory signaling following stimulation of all known TLR's, except TLR3, as well as IL1R and IL18R. Interestingly, 100% of IL-1R1-or IL-18R1-deficient mice survived infection by rMA15 (data not shown) indicating that the genetic absence of either receptor did not recapitulate the lethal phenotype observed following infection of MyD88 2/2 mice. These findings indicate that i) adaptive immunity does not play a major role in protection from lethal SARS-CoV infection in mice, ii) the genetic absence of MyD88 significantly enhances SARS-CoV-induced morbidity and mortality , and iii) MyD88-dependent signaling through a receptor(s) other than IL-1R1 or IL-18R1 is responsible for protection from rMA15. Increased viral loads and viral spread in the lungs of MyD88 2/2 mice To determine if lethal infection of MyD88-deficient mice was due to enhanced and/or prolonged virus replication, a kinetic analysis of rMA15 viral loads within the lungs of WT, RAG-1 2/2 , and MyD88 2/2 mice was performed. Viral loads in lung tissue of rMA15-infected MyD88 2/2 mice were significantly higher than WT mice at 2, 3, 4, and 6 dpi and RAG-1 2/2 mice at both 2 and 4 dpi (Fig. 1C) . Interestingly, despite the absence of significant signs of disease at late time points, viral lung titers remained elevated in lung tissue of rMA15-infected RAG-1 2/2 mice at 7
