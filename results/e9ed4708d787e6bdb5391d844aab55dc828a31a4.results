We identified 15,745 references published in Annals of Emergency Medicine in 2000 Medicine in , 2003 Medicine in , and 2005 . References made to the medical/scientific journals and magazines composed 85% of the total references identified during the 3 years. The Internet reference category was the third largest group of references and contributed 4% of the total references ( Table 2) . The proportion of references that were Internet references increased throughout our 3 study years. Fifty-one of 5,276 total references (1%; 95% CI 0.7% to 1.3%) in 2000, 286 of 5,876 references (4.9%; 95% CI 4.3% to 5.4%) in 2003, and 249 of 4,593 (5.4%; 95% CI 4.8% to 6.1%) in 2005 were Internet references. When comparing the categories of Internet references, we found that the number of Internet references that no longer accessed the authors' intended information increased over time. Forty of the 51 Internet references in 2000 (78%; 95% CI 65% to 88%), 161 of the 286 Internet references in 2003 (56%; 95% CI 50% to 62%), and 111 of the 249 Internet references in 2005 (45%; 95% CI 39% to 51%) no longer allowed access to the authors' intended information. To better describe how the Internet references are inaccessible, we compared the 8 categories of Internet references that did not readily link to the authors' intended information. During the 3 years, 172 Internet references (55% of inaccessible Internet references; 95% CI 50% to 61%) could not locate a Web site. One hundred fifteen (37% of inaccessible Internet references; 95% CI 32% to 42%) of the inaccessible Internet references linked to a generic and related Web site, but the authors' intended information could not be identified (Table 3) . Of the 4 Internet references that gave a "temporarily unavailable" message initially (1% of total Internet references; 95% CI 0.3% to 1.7%), none of those Internet references became readily accessible during our study period and, therefore, remained in this category.
