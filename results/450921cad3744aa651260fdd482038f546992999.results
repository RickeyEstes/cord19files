In order to investigate differences between BVDV subgroups regarding virulence during persistent infection, clinical recordings and necropsy reports of PI animals infected with viruses of different BVDV-1 subgroups were analysed. We included patients from the clinic for ruminants of the Department of Farm Animals (University Zü rich) and additional necropsy reports of animals referred by private veterinarians directly to the Institute of Veterinary Pathology (University Zü rich) for postmortem analysis.
