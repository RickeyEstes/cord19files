Data from a total of 608 preweaned calves were included for this study (no missing data). Two hundred twenty (36.2%) calves showed evidence of lung consolidation (≥1 cm consolidation). The repartition of abnormal clinical signs conditional to ultrasound findings are presented in Fig. 2 . The prediction according to different clinical profiles provided by the 2 clinical experts are summarized in Table 1 . Convergence and good mixing were obtained rapidly for all the models. The regression parameters obtained from the different modeling strategies are summarized in Table 2 . The expected predicted probabilities for the 7 different clinical profiles are summarized in Fig. 3 . Briefly, the different priors had a relatively low impact on posterior densities of all tested models (Table 2, Supplemental file). The BRD probabilities and their 95% BCI are presented in Fig. 4 for all possible 64 clinical signs permutations using the posterior distributions of Model 1. The regression coefficients were obtained (using rounded value of 10*β (Moons et al., 2002) ) and the final weight attributed to every clinical sign is presented in Table 3 as well as comparison of the relative weight of each clinical sign when compared with the original BRD3 Californian score proposed by Love et al. (2014) and Aly et al. (2014) . The Se c and Sp c were then obtained for all possible scores obtained in the database (Table 4 ) and associated accuracy was recorded in Fig. 4 . The MCT analysis is presented in Fig. 5 using a BRD prevalence of 5, 20 and 40% respectively. In a high prevalence scenario (40% prevalence as in a clinical outbreak) or for r = 1:20, a very low score cut-off would be the optimal choice (eg treating all calves with one abnormal sign). For a low prevalence scenario and for r of 1:8 or less, a cut-off of 13 or 15 would minimize MCT. In average BRD prevalence situation (20%), a cut-off between 9 to 16 would minimize MCT depending on r values. The 2 experts were asked to give their best probability guess for the presence of an active infection of the lower respiratory tract in a calf i with different clinical profiles as well as the values they were 90% probability range (5th and 95th percentile). The mean guess and larger probability range value were used for generating beta distributions.
