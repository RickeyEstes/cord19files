In Taiwan (Table 2) . Furthermore, matches between circulating and vaccine influenza strains were analyzed based on HAI assays, and a range of 12-93% of influenza virus isolates were antigenically similar to influenza vaccine strains during 2004/2005 to 2008/2009 ( Figure 1 ). VE was estimated in a total of 4494 children aged 6-59 months for whom laboratory results and vaccination status were available for the five winter epidemics. Table 2 shows the demographic distribution of the cases and controls in each season. Categorized according to epidemic, the sex distribution was similar among case and control subjects; however, the proportion of subjects who tested positive was significantly higher in children aged 24-59 months (15.2%) than in those aged 6-23 months (6.1% Figure 2 ). By age category (6-23 months and 24-59 months), the VE estimates were 51% (95% CI 23-68%) and 75% (95% CI 60-84%) for those aged 6-23 months and 24-59 months, respectively. The I 2 value of 0% possibly indicates that statistical heterogeneity was not observed across the five winter epidemics, and across the age ranges of 6-23 months and 24-59 months (Figure 2 ). The VE estimates were higher among those aged 24-59 months than among those aged 6-23 months across the five seasons.
