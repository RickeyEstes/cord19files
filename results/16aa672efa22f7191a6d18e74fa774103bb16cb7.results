The relationship between prM processing and the fusion activity To understand the role of prM protein in virus maturation and its interaction with the E glycoprotein, we investigated the effect that ammonium chloride had on MVE viruses grown in C6/36 mosquito cells. Ammonium chloride has been shown to accumulate in the post-Golgi acidic vesicles and interrupt the processing of prM to M protein (Randolph eta/., 1990) . The unprocessed prM protein was incorporated into the released viruses grown in the presence of ammonium chloride at 6 days p.i. (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) . When ammonium chloride was removed, the cells partially recovered, and the normal processing of the prM to M resumed (Fig. lA,  lane 3) . Since some unprocessed prM proteins were also found in MVE-infected cells in the absence of ammonium chloride ( Fig. 1 A, lane l) , we attempted to quantify the amount of prM in each sample. This was achieved by scanning the stained viral proteins following separation by SDS-PAGE. By using nonradioactive viruses it was not always possible to clearly demonstrate the presence of the small M protein in minigels. The fact that the ratios of the viral structural proteins in the absence of ammonium chloride remain constant enabled us to evaluate the amount of prM processing indirectly by calculating its ratio to other structural proteins (E or C) which are more abundant in virions. The ratio of the area of each peak corresponding to C or prM proteins to E as well as prM to C protein was calculated. The ratio of C to E protein remained constant in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride (data not shown) whereas the ratio of prM to E protein was significantly increased in the presence of ammonium chloride (from 0.15 to 0.86) and reduced to 0.55 following removal of ammonium chloride (Fig. 1A) . Similar results were obtained when the ratio of prM to C was calculated (data not shown). These data confirm that partial recovery of prM processing has occurred once the ammonium chloride has been removed. To determine the fusion activity of the viruses obtained from the supernatants of virus-infected ammonium chloride-treated cells, the FFWO assay was performed using monolayers of C6/36 cells as described previously (Guirakhoo et a/., 199 1) . No polykaryocyte formation was observed (up to 200 pg/ml of purified virus) using viruses harvested in the presence of ammonium chloride at 6 days p.i.; however, when ammonium chloride was removed, the fusion activity of puri-fied viruses obtained on Day 9 was significantly restored ( Fig. 1 B) . These results are in agreement with our previous finding with TBE virus which demonstrated a direct relationship between processing of prM and fusion activity of E glycoprotein (Guirakhoo eta/., 1991) and further manifest that both phenomena are reversible. Epitope analysis of the E-proteins of prM-and Mcontaining viruses A capture ELISA was performed to analyze the effect that blocking the prM cleavage had on the expression of E glycoprotein epitopes in native virions. The reactivities of MAbs defining nine distinct epitopes on the MVE E glycoprotein were compared on M-and prMcontaining viruses using supernatants of ammonium chloride-treated or untreated virus-infected C6/36 cells. The antigenicity of the prM-and M-containing virus supernatants was equivalent in end-point ELISA antigen titration using a 1:500 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-MVE virus capture sera and anti-MVE virus mouse hyperimmune ascitic fluid (HIAF) as detector. Therefore, a 1:5 dilution of each supernatant was used in subsequent epitope mapping with MAbs. The equivalent antigenicity was confirmed by end-point ELISA titration of the MVE HIAF in the standardized capture assay (Fig. 2B) . Even though these virus supernatants had equal antigenicity, the prM-containing virus supernatant was 1 O-fold less infectious than the M-containing virus supernatant (3.9 X 1 O* vs 2.3 X 10' PFU/ml). The reactivities of three E glycoprotein epitopes were significantly reduced in prM-containing viruses (Fig.  2C) . Two of these epitopes were subcomplex-and complex-reactive (E-6 and E-8) and one was groupreactive (E-4b), being conserved in all flaviviruses (Hawkes et al., 1988) . The reactivities of other MVE virus-specific MAbs were identical with both viruses (Fig. 2A) . Structural properties of the epitopes corresponding to these MAbs were assessed by comparing the reactivities of MAbs after incubation of the purified viruses at low pH to those of untreated viruses (Fig. 3) . As can be seen, the antigenic reactivities of all MAbs and the HIAF were significantly reduced upon low pH treatment of the virus.
