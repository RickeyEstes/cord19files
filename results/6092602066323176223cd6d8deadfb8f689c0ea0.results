Adenovirus identification and genome annotation. All 11 specimens collected were amplified ''PCR-positive'' for adenovirus and identified as HAdV-7 by type-specific PCR analysis. Of these, two, isolated from hospitalized and presumably more severe cases, produced visible CPE upon culturing. They were archived as DG01_2011 and DG02_2011. Sequence analysis revealed identical hexons, which were identified as HAdV type 7 by BLASTn analysis. The genome from DG01_2011 was then sequenced, assembled, annotated, and analyzed. Figure 1 presents the genomic organization and transcription map of DG01_2011. This genome contains 35,240 bp with a GC content of 51.08%. A total of 39 coding sequences were identified. These genome data, noted formally as ''human adenovirus 7 strain CHN/DG01/2011/ 7[P7H7F7]'' and in this report as ''DG01_2011'', were deposited in GenBank (accession number KC440171). Genome type determination of HAdV-7 strains DG01_2011, 0901HZ/ShX/2009, and CQ1198_2010. The genome type of DG01_2011 was determined by comparing its in silico REA profiles with other HAdV-7 genome types reported in the literature 3, 7, 11, 15, 20 . Although seemingly antiquated in comparison to genome sequencing, REA profiles are still useful for comparisons with unsequenced but previously reported genome types and strains, and also as rapid and less-expensive alternatives for large-scale characterizations of viruses given a correct reference strain. Using the genome type denomination of Li, et al. 20 , DG01_2011 is identified as HAdV-7d, evidenced by the REA patterns and identical with the first reported HAdV-7d 25 , as shown in Figure 2 . The REA patterns generated from DG01_2011, 0901HZ/ShX/2009, which caused acute bronchitis and pneumonia in an ARD outbreak comprising 70 cases amongst young children in the Shaanxi Province in 2009, including one fatality 24 , and CQ1198_2010, which was associated with an epidemic in Chongqing, Southwestern China (Ni, K., et al., unpublished; JX625134), are identical to each other and also identical with those of HAdV-7d reported earlier in Israel (1998) and Japan (1999) 26, 27 . The REA patterns of CQ1198_2010 in this study provide evidence to amend the less-descriptive designation of ''mutant HAdV-7d2'' noted by Ni, K., et al. in the GenBank entry for CQ1198_2010 (JX625134). For reference, the in silico REA profile for the prototype Gomen HAdV-7 is provided; the REA patterns for these recent isolates differ clearly from the prototype, as shown in Figure 2 . HAdV-7 prototype is the correct reference genome as three REA profiles, BclI, SalI, and XhoI, showed identical patterns and complement the REA patterns that differ, along with sequence similarities across the genome. Phylogenetic analysis of hexon genes and whole genomes confirms the genome types. Phylogenetic analysis of 33 archived HAdV-7 hexon genes showed that DG01_2011 has an origin common to strains 0901HZ/ShX/2009, CQ1198_2010, Hebei_SJZ_2011, and TW_2011. These hexons form a subclade that is on the same branch with another subclade containing several non-China isolates, including HAdV-7d2 from the U.S., as shown in Figure 3A . The bootstrap value of 65 indicates the hexons from the China genomes are highly similar to each, but are separate from the U.S. HAdV-7d2 subclade (bootstrap value 82). Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis of 16 available HAdV-7 whole genomes revealed DG01_2011, 0901HZ/ShX/2009, and CQ1198_2010 forming a subclade comprising HAdV-7d, and confirming the close relationships with each other, reaffirming a common lineage ( Figure 3B ) that is distinct from the HAdV-7d2 strains of the U.S.A. (bootstrap value 100). All of the genome types form subclades that are separate from the clade containing the prototype 7 (Gomen; 1952), with HAdV-7h forming a separate subclade in the genome phylogenetic analysis in contrast to the hexon gene phylogenetic analysis. Comparative genomic analysis and single nucleotide differences of HAdV-7 strains causing ARD outbreaks in China. Comparative genomics analysis showed DG01_2011 has near genome identity with an earlier HAdV-7 isolate, 0901HZ/ShX/2009 (99.97%) and also with CQ1198_2010 (99.96%). Comparative genomics analysis documented seven single nucleotide substitution and one single base insertion differences between the DG01_2011 and 0901HZ/ShX/ 2009 genomes. Of these, two single nucleotide substitutions were localized in the ITRs and one non-synonymous substitution each was located in the DNA polymerase, penton base, and 34 kDa protein coding sequences (Table 1) . One synonymous nucleotide substitution each was present in the 100-kDa hexon assemblyassociated protein and Virus-Associated (VA) RNA II. The single nucleotide insertion was in a non-coding region of DG01_2011. There were three single nucleotide substitutions in coding sequences and seven base deletion differences in the ITRs between CQ1198_2010 and 0901HZ/ShX/2009 genomes. One synonymous substitution (C to T) was located in hexon assembly-associated protein (A254A) and the other two non-synonymous substitutions G to C and G to T were located in DNA polymerase (S55C) and 34 kDa protein (P87Q), respectively. The nucleotide deletions in ITRs of CQ1198_2010 may be sequencing errors given that the left ITR was not identical with the right ITR, or may represent recent mutations. If exclusive of ITR differences, there were only three single nucleotide substitutions between the CQ1198_2010 and 0901HZ/ShX/2009 genomes (99.99%). For strain DG01_2011, it had a higher genome identity with CQ1198_2010 (99.98%) than 0901HZ/ShX/2009 (99.97%) if exclusive of ITR difference. There were only four single nucleotide substitutions and one single nucleotide insertion in non-coding region between both genomes, which led to three non-synonymous substitutions in DNA polymerase (D1039E, S55C) and penton base gene (V239A), respectively. Nucleotide substitution rates and selection pressures for HAdV-7d strain DG01_2011 major capsid protein genes. The selective pressures at the protein level for the three HAdV-7 capsid protein genes, hexon, penton base and fiber, were examined by comparing synonymous and non-synonymous mutations. All three genes have Ka/Ks ratios of less than 1 ( Table 2 ). This is in accordance with the hypothesis that organismal evolution is dominated by negative selection, i.e., ones removing mutations harmful to fitness 28 . Specifically, both hexon and penton base genes have less non- synonymous substitutions per site, which leads to the low ratios of Ka/Ks. Although the non-synonymous substitutions and Ka/Ks ratio of the fiber gene is also low, it is relatively higher than for the hexon and penton base genes. This may indicate that the fiber gene has less negative selection pressures, likely due to tissue tropism being determined and constrained by the fiber gene. Overall, the majority of mutations are synonymous and do not affect the integrity of the hexon, penton base, and fiber proteins. Genome recombination analysis of HAdV-7d. Genome recombination analysis using Simplot software 29 reveals a lateral transfer of a small portion of the genome upstream of the penton base gene. This recombination contains the entire L1 52/55 kDa gene from HAdV-16 into HAdV-7d, as shown in Figure 4A . Its importance remains to be revealed. The gene transfer is also found in the genomes from the earlier strains CQ1198_2010 (Southwestern China; 2010; unpublished) and 0901HZ/ShX/2009 (Northwestern China; 2009) 24 , respectively, shown in Figure 4B , but not found in the prototype Gomen HAdV-7 genome, as displayed in Figure 4C .
