Cholesterol depletion had no effect on BRV binding In order to disrupt the lipid rafts, the cholesterol in cellular membranes was extracted by MβCD. MA-104 cells were treated with different concentrations of MβCD (0, 2.5, 5, 10 and 15 mM) for 30 min, then the cytotoxicity was measured by CCK-8 assay, the results showed that the cell survival rate ( Figure 1A ) did not differ significantly between treated and mock treated cells. The cholesterol contents of cellular membranes were measured by the Amplex Red cholesterol assay kit. Total cellular cholesterol levels of MβCD-treated MA-104 cells were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. As shown in Figure 1B , the amount of cholesterol following treatment with 2.5, 5, 10 or 15 mM MβCD was reduced by 15.4%, 24.9%, 60.7% or 70.7% compared with untreated cells, respectively. To test whether cholesterol depletion was able to inhibit virus attachment, virus binding assay was performed. MA-104 cells were pretreated with MβCD for 30 min, and then incubated with virus at 4°C for 1 h, virus can merely absorb to cells under this temperature. As shown in Figure 1C , no inhibitory effect was detected by virus titration assay. It indicated that cholesterol depletion had no effect on BRV attachment.
