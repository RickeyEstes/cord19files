Several studies have confirmed the validity and reliability of the NHI LHID from 1 million representative beneficiaries in clinical research [25] [26] [27] . A total of 1,892 ATs were performed between 1997 and 2010. The average annual incidence of AT was 14.7 per 100,000 individuals during the study period. The sample comprised 41.3% female patients, with a mean age of 24.0 ± 18.2 years. Patients aged <18 years formed 48.2% of the total AT population. Table 2 shows the number and percentage of patients who received tonsillectomy alone or tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy by age groups in this cohort. Tonsillectomy alone is more commonly performed in adults (920/1195, 76.9%). In contrast, tonsillectomy with an adenoidectomy is most often performed in patients of 5-11 y/o (415/697, 59.5%). Only two patients (2/1892, 0.1%) underwent AT on an outpatient basis. Mean hospital stay of AT patients was 3.7 ± 2.9 days (median, three days). were ICD-9-CM 146 (malignant neoplasm of oropharynx), 196 (secondary and unspecified malignant neoplasm of lymph nodes of head, face, and neck), and 210 (benign neoplasm of lip, oral cavity, and pharynx) at 32%, 18.0%, and 11.7%, respectively. The overall incidence of the Tumor category demonstrated a noticeable increasing trend. Among the total study population, RICI showed a decreasing trend (y = -0.6571x + 89.571, p = 0.462), whereas UAO and Tumor showed an increasing trend (y = 2.2044x + 23.824, p = 0.091 and y = 1.4769x -0.9341, p = 0.001, respectively). In the adult subgroup (Figs 2B and 3B) , the incidence and proportion of AT performed for RICI decreased from 46 (78%) in 1997 to 32 Table 3 indicates the number and percentage of the three categories of surgical indications according to sex, age groups, hospital level, and insured residence areas in the total study population. The male patients had a higher overall AT rate and were more likely to undergo AT with the indications of UAO and Tumor, whereas the female patients were more liable to undergo surgery with the indication of RICI. However, RICI remained the most prevalent indication for AT, followed by UAO and Tumor, in both the male and female patients. The distribution of the surgical indications across each age group differed significantly (p <0.0001). Adolescence aged 12-17 years were the most likely to undergo AT because of infectious indications, with 73.7% of these patients undergoing surgery for this reason. Another 24.3% of the patients in this age category underwent surgery due to UAOs. Only 2% of these patients received surgery because of a suspected or confirmed neoplasm. The pattern of the distribution of surgical indications remained similar in the <5 years and 5-11 years age groups. However, the proportion of infectious indications decreased in the adult subgroups. The percentage of UAO was relatively stable across all age groups. Notably, the proportion of Tumor indications increased dramatically in the >40 years age group (28.1%). Compared with the pediatric age groups and 18-40 years group, that of >40 years had more Tumor indications, which coincided with a decrease in the infectious indications. Most of the ATs were performed in the medical centers and regional hospitals (Table 3) . Infection was the most frequent cause of surgery at all hospital levels (61.1% in medical centers, 63.2% in regional hospitals, and 70.6% in local hospitals). The distribution of surgical indications across the hospital level was significantly different (p <0.0001). The distribution pattern of surgical indications was similar in medical centers and regional hospitals, those performed in local hospitals were more likely to have been caused by infection and less likely to have been caused by UAO or Tumor. The trend in the AT rate and the proportion of surgical indications by the calendar year according to sex, age groups, hospital level, and insured residence areas in the total study population are shown in the supplemental data (S1 File). We examined the incidence rate and distribution of the surgical indications for AT among the six distinct insured residence areas in Taiwan ( Table 3) . Most of the ATs were performed in the Taipei district (42.9%, 800/1863), followed by the Central (20.5%, 381/1863), South (12.7%, 237/1863), Northern (10.9%, 204/1863), Kaoping (10.4%, 193/1863), and Eastern districts (2.6%, 48/1863). The distribution of the surgical indications among the insured residence areas was significantly different (p <0.0001). We performed multinomial logistic regression to identify the possible factors associated with the different surgical indications after adjustment for age, sex, hospital level, and insured residence areas, in which UAO was the reference group. We compared RICI with UAO and Tumor with UAO in the same model (Table A in  S2 File) . After adjusted with other variables, RICI occurred more often in the younger and female patients compared with UAO. Tumor occurred more often in the older patients compared with UAO. In addition, we examined the related factors (sex, age groups, hospital level, and resident areas) with a time series (S1 File). The patients in the 5-11 years group had a higher proportion of AT due to UAO after 2006, whereas the proportion in the 18-40 and >40 years group declined after 2006. The patients in the 5-11 years of age had a higher incidence of AT because of RICI after 2000, whereas the incidence in the 18-40 years group decreased after 2000. Moreover, the incidence of patients with RICI for AT shifted from medical centers to regional hospitals during the study period, whereas the incidence of surgical indications for UAO and Tumor did not change significantly. Most patients with UAO and Tumor indications received AT surgery at medical centers. Tables 4 and 5 indicate the number and percentage of the three categories of surgical indications according to sex, age groups, hospital level, and insured residence areas in the adult and pediatric subgroups, respectively. In the adult subgroup, the distribution of the surgical indications in gender (p < 0.001), age (p < 0.0001), hospital level (p < 0.0001) and insured residence areas (p = 0.005) differed significantly. Multinomial logistic regression (Table B in S2 File) showed that age was the only significant factor associated with the different surgical indications in the adult subgroup. Compared with RICI, UAO occurred more frequently in the higher hospital level. The effect of sex, an insured residence area, and hospital level was not statistically significant in the Tumor group (vs. UAO) after all the variables were controlled. By contrast, the distribution of the surgical indications in the pediatric subgroup differed significantly in hospital level (p < 0.0001). Logistic regression (Table C in S2 File) showed that hospital level was the only significant factor associated with the different surgical indications in the pediatric subgroup.
