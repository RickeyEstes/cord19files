Two hundred fifty patients comprised the study population. One hundred fifty patients (60%) were enrolled into the study from the primary care setting and 100 others (40%) from the emergency room. In accordance with the classification described above 175 patients (70%) were diagnosed as LRTI and 75 (30%) as URTI. Table 1 presents a comparison of demographic data, smoking history and chronic co-morbidity between the two groups. All 250 patients, without exception, came to the follow-up appointment. A convalescence serum sample was drawn from all the patients at a mean interval of 26.2 Ϯ 7.1 days (range 19 -47 days) after the acute phase sample. The disease course in all 250 patients was benign and all recovered completely without significant complications or need for hospitalization. Table 2 shows a comparison of the clinical manifestations of acute respiratory tract infection in the two groups. No comparisons were done for the clinical parameters that served as diagnostic criteria for LRTI, as such a comparison would be meaningless. Table 3 presents the frequency distribution of the various infectious etiologies that were identified in each of the two groups, and a comparison between them. At least one infectious etiology was identified in 167 patients (67%), of whom 115 (66%) were in the LRTI group and 52 (69%) were in the URTI group. As can be seen in this table, the only statistically significant difference between the groups was for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The relatively low rate of C. pneumoniae infections stems from the diagnostic requirement of a fourfold increase in antibody titer between the acute and convalescence phase sera, that was also used for other pathogens. Had we related to a high antibody titer, without change between the paired sera, as evidence of acute infection with C. pneumoniae, we would have identified this pathogen in 28 patients (16%) in the LRTI group and in 14 patients (19%) in the URTI group. In 11 of the 12 patients in whom pneumococcal infection was diagnosed a significant change in the level of pneumococcal antibodies was detected, while in only one patient the diagnosis was based only on the presence of specific pneumococcal immune complexes in the two sera. The 28 patients in whom at least one of the Legionella spp. was identified as the etiology of RTI are a unique and interesting group. In light of this uniqueness it would be worthwhile to detail the specific Legionella spp. that were identified, the clinical manifestations of the infection, and the response to antibiotic therapy in these patients compared to the others. However, this degree of detail would be beyond the scope of the present paper that deals with all the infectious etiologies found in the study population. Thus, these patients were described and discussed in detail in a paper devoted specifically to this issue (Lieberman et al., 2001) . In 42 patients more than one etiology was identified. This represents 17% of the study population and 25% of the patients in whom at least one etiology was found. The distribution of etiologies per patient in the two groups, and the comparison between them, are shown in Table 4 . Despite the absence of a statistically significant difference in the rates of this parameter between the two groups, there is a clear trend to a higher rate of more than one etiology in the LRTI group compared to the URTI group. Among these 42 patients, 10 had a viral respiratory tract infection in addition to a bacterial agent, 23 patients had a viral respiratory tract infection together with an atypical bacterial agent, and four patients had a combined infection with a bacterial and an atypical bacterial agent. Three pathogens were identified in one patient, each agent belonging to one of the above groups. Four patients had infections with more than one agent from the same group of pathogens. Nineteen patients from the LRTI group (11%) were diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In 14 of these patients at least one infectious agent was identified. Two patients had a mixed etiology with a respiratory virus and an atypical bacteria, one patient had a combination of a viral agent, C. pneumoniae and S. pneumoniae and one patient had a mixed infection with a viral agent, C. burnetii and a positive throat culture for group A ␤-hemolytic streptococci.
