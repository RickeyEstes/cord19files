Effect of anti-MCP-1. The rabbit anti-MCP-1 preparation could block at least 40 ng/mL of MCP-1 and did not cross-react with IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-16, TNF, transforming growth factor-␣, or MIP-1␣. Treatment of mice with anti-MCP-1 did not change (t test) the extent of pulmonary histopathologic findings in response to 7.2 g/g intratracheally administered S rectivirgula (6.9 Ϯ 2.2, mean, sem) compared with that in animals treated with an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline solution (8.6 -3.4), nor did it change the number or characteristics of BALF cells (data not shown). CCR2 ؊/؊ animals. The extent of histologic abnormalities in both the CCR2 Ϫ/Ϫ and wild-type mice was dependent on the amount of S rectivirgula administered but not the type of animal (P Ͻ .05, CCR2 Ϫ/Ϫ vs wild-type; Fig 1, two-way ANOVA). We noted an increase in BALF cells in both wildtype and CCR2 Ϫ/Ϫ mice after administration of every dose of S rectivirgula (Table I ). The total numbers of macrophages and eosinophils were the same in the wild-type and CCR2 Ϫ/Ϫ animals. We found small differences in the total number of lymphocytes (CCR2 Ϫ/Ϫ Ͻ wild-type, multiple ANOVA). The numbers of cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils were related to the amount of S rectivirgula administered, and we found no differences among the strains (P Ͻ .05, multiple ANOVA). The amount of S rectivirgula administered was related to MCP-1, MIP-1␣, and IL-12p40 levels (P Ͻ .05, multiple ANOVA). We noted differences between the wild-type and CCR2 Ϫ/Ϫ mice with regard to MCP-1 and MIP-1␣ (CCR2 Ϫ/Ϫ Ͼ wild-type) and IL-12p40 (CCR2 Ϫ/Ϫ Ͻ wild-type) (Table II) . This increase in MCP-1 and MIP-1␣ and decrease in IL-12p40 in CCR2 Ϫ/Ϫ compared with those in wild-type mice is similar to results reported by others. [18] [19] [20] [21] Adoptive transfer of EHP. In both wild-type and CCR2 Ϫ/Ϫ animals, transfer of cultured spleen cells conferred the ability to respond with more extensive pulmonary histologic abnormalities (compared with animals administered medium) to an intratracheal challenge with S rectivirgula (Fig 2) . In both CCR2 Ϫ/Ϫ and wild-type mice, we found extensive infiltration of the perivascular and peribronchiolar areas with a mixture of lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells (Fig 3) , similar to findings in C3H/HeJ, C57Bl/6, A/J, and BALB/c mice. 10, 22 We found minor differences with regard to total BALF cell number (Fig 4) , with increased numbers of cells in wild-type animals that received transferred cells compared with those that received RPMI-1640. Both strains exhibited increased numbers of lymphocytes in cell recipients compared with RPMI recipients. CCR2 Ϫ/Ϫ animals that had received transferred cells had increased numbers of neutrophils. Two-way ANOVA with the factors of strain and treatment (RPMI or cells) demonstrated that treatment (ie, RPMI or cells) was related (P Ͻ .05) to the number of cells and neutrophils, with no difference between the strains. The total numbers of lymphocytes were different between the strains, as well as between treatments, with more lymphocytes in the wild-type than in the CCR2 Ϫ/Ϫ animals. We found few eosinophils, with no differences between groups. We found an increase of IL-12p40 in wild-type animals that received cells and RPMI, with a peak at 48 hours ( Fig 5; multiple ANOVA, P Ͻ .05). We also found an increase in IL-6 in wild-type animals that received cells compared with that in CCR2 Ϫ/Ϫ animals that received cells (Fig 6; multiple ANOVA, P Ͻ .05). We analyzed culture supernatants to determine the cytokine-secreting profiles of injected cells and found that the supernatants from the CCR2 Ϫ/Ϫ animals produced less IFN-␥ than those from the wild-type animals (Table III) . IL-12p40, IL-18, IL-6, and IL-1␣ were detected in the supernatants, with no difference between strains.
