A total of 39 519 patients who were discharged or passed away during the 1-year study period were included. The algorithm reduced the number of patients to screen manually by 93.7% (95% CI: 93.5e94.0%) to 2454 'at-risk' patients. Every patient 'at risk' had a mean of 2.3 radiological procedures to be evaluated. A total of 251 patients were identified as having nvHAP according to ECDC criteria. The number of EMRs needing to be screened to detect one nvHAP was 9.8 (95%CI: 8.7e11.4). On average 4.4 min were required to screen one EMR. This would translate to a calculated workload for nvHAP surveillance in our 950-bed tertiary care centre of approximately 40 min per workday when using the semiautomatic surveillance system. Table 1 shows the cross-tabulations of full manual surveillance against semi-automated surveillance for the three validation samples (VS1eVS3), and the respective analyses of sensitivity, negative predictive value, and accuracy. Four additional patients were identified to have nvHAP in VS2 (comprising only patients with ICD-10 HAP) that were not identified as 'at risk' by the algorithm and hence missed. Consequently, compared to full manual surveillance, sensitivity, negative predictive value, and accuracy of semi-automated surveillance were lowest in VS2 with 97.5% (CI: 93.7e99.3%), 99.2% (CI: 97.9e99.8%), and 99.4% (CI: 98.4e99.8%), respectively.
