Between March 2016 and September 2017, 2068 human, animal and environmental health professionals from 142 countries applied and trained in informal disease surveillance and the use of the EpiCore platform. The majority of EpiCore responders self-identified as having a professional background in human health (1039, 54%), followed by human and environmental health (329, 17%), animal health (215, 11%), human and animal health (142, 7%), human and animal and environmental health (127, 7%), environmental health (40, 2%) and animal and environmental health (35, 2%). About half of current EpiCore responders (1073, 52%) had more than 10 years of experience in their respective field of work. Another 530 (26%) had 5-10 years of experience, 298 (14%) had 3-5 years of experience and 167 (8%) had less than 3 years of experience. Most EpiCore responders (1259, 61%) worked in the government sector, 488 (24%) in NGOs or the non-profit sector and 320 (15%) in the private sector. From March 2016 to September 2017, requesters sent 759 requests for information concerning unverified outbreak alerts to EpiCore responders. Requests for information addressed events in over 100 countries (Fig. 1) , had 15 120 views by a member and elicited 1923 responder responses. Of the requests for information, 466 (61%) received at least one response ( Table 1) . The time from issuing the request to receiving the first response ranged from 1 minute to 62 days with a median of 6 hours. Of the 790 individual responses, 361 (45%) were considered to be useful by the requester and led to a ProMED post to subscribers. Examples of useful responses to requests for information received via EpiCore are shown in Box 1. EpiCore responses informed 194 ProMED posts to subscribers: 99 (51%) supported verification, 56 (29%) provided additional information, 23 (12%) refuted verification and 16 (8%) provided no new information.
