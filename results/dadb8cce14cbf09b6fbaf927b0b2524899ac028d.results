The 3-nt TRN mutant is attenuated for virulence. In a previous study in our laboratory, we demonstrated that the SARS-CoV TRN could be reprogrammed, provided the individual TRSs were replaced with matching sequences 13 . The rewired TRN replaced the conserved 6-nt TRS with a 6-nt cassette that is not used in any other characterized CoVs, encoding a net change of 3 nts (ACGAAC to CCGGAU). Our previous work showed that this rewired TRN was refractory to recombination with WT genomes 13 . Therefore, we tested its replication and pathogenesis in young and aged BALB/c mice. Consistent with earlier reports, WT SARS-CoV only caused weight loss in aged animals. In contrast, CRG3 replicated but caused no weight loss in young (10-week-old) mice (Fig. 2a) and minimal weight loss in aged (12month-old) BALB/c mice ( Fig. 2b ) (young mice: P = 0.25 for titer, Wilcoxon test, P = 0.37 for weight loss, Mann-Whitney test; old mice: P = 0.25 for titer, P < 0.001 for weight loss). Both WT and recombinant viruses replicated to high titers that were detectable on days 2 and 4 post-infection (p.i.) in both young and aged animals, with titers beginning to clear by day 7 p.i. (Fig. 2c,  d) , as is usually observed in mice infected with SARS-CoV 1 . Vaccination with CRG3 protects mice against challenge. The high replication titer and low or absent virulence in young and aged mouse models paired with the inherently recombinationrefractory genome suggested that the CRG3 virus would be an ideal vaccine candidate. To test CRG3's efficacy in protecting against homologous and heterologous challenge, the virus was administered to mice in a single-dose vaccination, alongside viral replicon particles (VRPs) expressing the viral Spike attachment protein (VRP-S) as a control 15 . On day 22 post-vaccination, mice were then challenged with either mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15-homologous challenge) or SARS-CoV expressing the Spike gene from the Himalayan palm civet (Paguma larvata) strain HCSZ6103 (heterologous challenge). Mice were then observed for morbidity and mortality, and surviving animals were euthanized on day 4 p.i. Upon homologous challenge, CRG vaccination was protective against weight loss and mortality in young and aged mice, with no detectable viral titer in the lungs at 4 days p.i., in contrast to PBS and VRP-S subcutaneous vaccination ( Fig. 3a-d, Supplementary Fig. 1A-B) . Importantly, against heterologous challenge, while both CRG3 and VRP-S vaccines CRG vaccination induced SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody titers approaching 4 log 10 in both young and aged mice, nearly 2-fold higher than the titers induced by VRP-S vaccination (P < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA) ( Supplementary Fig. 1E ). Moreover, CRG vaccination largely protected aged mice from the extensive inflammatory cell infiltration, tissue damage, perivascular cuffing, edema, and septal thickening observed in PBS-and VRP-Svaccinated mice ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). CRG3 reverts with pandemic-associated mutations. A liveattenuated vaccine candidate should demonstrate phenotypic stability in infected host populations. Therefore, to test its resistance to reversion to virulence, CRG3 was subjected to five independent serial passages in parallel with WT SARS-CoV in aged (14-month-old) BALB/c mice. Over the course of six 4-day passages, all CRG3 passaged viruses acquired a virulent phenotype, with weight losses and percent survival curves mirroring the kinetic rates of the emergence of virulence seen with WT passaged viruses ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). To attempt to identify the genotypic causes of this phenotypic reversion to virulence, the genomes of 5 independent plaque isolates of the passage 6 viruses (WT P6 and CRG3 P6) were submitted to Sanger sequencing. Surprisingly, and contrary to expectations, no mutations in either the Spike or the Membrane protein-both of which were targets for mutational selection in 3 separate adaptations of SARS-CoV Urbani to mice (Fig. 4a )-were identified in WT or CRG3 revertants. Instead, 4 of 5 CRG3 P6 isolates showed evidence of often large deletions in the accessory ORFs 7b, 8a, and 8b ( Fig. 4a, b) . These deletions, often in-frame, were reminiscent of several incidences of host range-associated deletions identified in human isolates from the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic, including a 29-nt deletion in ORF8 relative to the Himalayan palm civet strain 16 and 82-nt 17 and 386-nt 18 deletions in this same region. In contrast, deletions in accessory ORFs were rare in virulent WT revertants. Rather, scattered nonsynonymous mutations were identified in ORF1a, ORF3a, ORF8a, and ORF9. Notably, only 1 WT revertant exhibited a small deletion in ORF7b. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that this region of the SARS-CoV genome is inherently unstable when subjected to replication pressure, especially in aged animals, and indicated that a TRNrewired virus would require additional stabilizing mutations to be feasible as a vaccine candidate. An attenuated SARS-CoV mutant with a 7-nt TRN replacement. The demonstration of second-site reversion to virulence upon passage of CRG3 suggested that a more ideal TRN-rewired vaccine candidate would be one that would be less likely to phenotypically revert in vivo. CoV TRS networks are finely tuned and regulate the expression of both highly abundant and lowfrequency mRNA transcripts; thus, small changes in the TRS might subtly alter the regulation of subgenomic transcripts 13 . Moreover, the exact regulatory milieu around each TRS is uncertain beyond the recognition that both, up-and downstream sequences can influence mRNA expression efficiency, perhaps in a TRN sequence-specific manner 19, 20 . We hypothesized that more extensive remodeling of the TRS network may better disrupt the finely tuned network of abundant and low-frequency transcripts, altering the natural regulation of global gene expression, and thereby leading to decreased virulence. In addition, it was possible that the virulence observed in CRG3 P6 isolates was due, at least in part, to mouse adaptation during passage. Therefore, to evaluate the effects of more extensive TRN rewiring in a lethal pathogenic model and to further stabilize the TRN against recombination repair and mutation selection, a TRN mutant was constructed that featured the following: (1) the set of Fig. 1 ). These replacements yielded infectious CRG7-MA virus that was capable of replicating to titers equivalent to those of the mouse-adapted WT background virus, SARS-MA15, though with a pinpoint plaque phenotype that remained stable after tissue culture passage. CRG3-MA (9 CRG3 replacements in the virulent SARS-MA15 backbone) was also generated as a control TRN-rewired virus. northern blot analysis of CRG7-MA versus CRG3 and SARS-MA15 revealed that the virus produced the expected bands at similar proportions to WT virus, although some additional low-abundance transcripts were also noted in CRG7-MA ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . These viruses were then evaluated for replication and virulence in young (10-week-old) and aged (12-month-old) BALB/c mice in comparison with SARS-MA15. In young mice, CRG7-MA was attenuated compared with CRG3-MA and SARS-MA15, causing . 5d-f ). Infection of aged BALB/c mice with 2 log 10 , 3 log 10 , or 4 log 10 PFU of CRG7-MA or SARS-MA15 emphasized the attenuated virulence phenotype, with the 2-log 10 PFU infection of CRG7-MA causing almost no weight loss over the course of the infection, despite replicating to the same titers as the 3 log 10 and 4 log 10 PFU infections (Fig. 5g- between CRG7-MA and SARS-MA15 infections, with 100% of mice infected with 2 log 10 or 3 log 10 PFU and 60% of mice infected with 4 log 10 PFU surviving the course of CRG7-MA infection. In contrast, only 40% of mice infected with 2 log 10 PFU of SARS-MA15 survived infection; mice infected with 3 log 10 or 4 log 10 PFU survived only until days 6 or 3 p.i. maximum, respectively (P < 0.0001, log-rank test) (Fig. 5i) . When CRG7-MA was serially passaged in young (10-week-old) BALB/c mice, in contrast to the rapid phenotypic reversion observed with CRG3, CRG7-MA remained phenotypically stable with passage, with mice losing a minimal (~5%) amount of their starting weight over the 3-day infections throughout all 4 passages ( Supplementary  Fig. 5A ). Viral titer also remained stable over passage, with >5 log 10 PFU detectable at 3 days p.i. in each passage (Supplementary Fig. 5B) . Furthermore, when CRG7-MA was serially passaged independently three times for six passages in aged mice, replicating the passage conditions in which CRG3 reverted to virulence, CRG7-MA did not exhibit an increase in virulence, causing <20% weight loss in infected animals and~60% mortality upon infection of 12-month-old BALB/c mice with 10 5 PFU of CRG7-MA post-passage, essentially replicating the mortality shown in aged mice infected with non-passaged CRG7-MA virus and distinct from the 100% mortality caused by wild-type SARS-MA15 infection of aged mice (see Fig. 5i , Supplementary  Fig. 5C -D, and Supplementary Table 1) . Finally, CRG7-MA was evaluated for its capacity to protect against lethal SARS-MA15 challenge in aged (12-month-old) mice. Mice were vaccinated with 2.5 log 10 PFU of either CRG7-MA or ExoN-MA, which we previously demonstrated to be an effective vaccine in the SARS-MA15 backbone in the aged BALB/ c mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis 1 . On day 22 postvaccination, mice were then challenged with a lethal dose (5 log 10 PFU) of SARS-MA15 and evaluated for weight loss. Mice lost only minimal amounts (~5%) of their starting weights with both vaccines (P = 0.125 for both viruses versus PBS vaccination, Wilcoxon test), indicating that CRG7-MA and ExoN-MA were equally protective against lethal SARS-MA15 challenge (Fig. 6 ).
