In the period of study, a total of 209 samples from 163 patients were received for laboratory confirmation of respiratory viruses using in parallel both PCR-based methods. Samples from five patients were laboratory-confirmed for enterovirus using Cepheid SmartEV kit, but non-detected using Seegene Anyplex II RV16 Detection kit v1.1. In addition, samples from 50 patients were laboratory-confirmed for RV (38/50), hAdV (4/50), hCoV-229E (1/50), hBoV (2/50) and hPIV-4 (4/50). Phylogenetic analysis of partial VP1 sequences (Fig. 1) confirmed that all detected enteroviruses were D68 serotype, which belonged to the phylogenetic major group 3 among the three clades circulating worldwide, as previously described. 3, 4, 8 The VP1 nucleotide sequences were genetically close to the recent 2014 Dutch strains 4 and to the strains of the large 2014 USA outbreak. In the comparison of VP1 amino acid sequences of strains belonging to the different EV-D68 clades (Table 1) , the EV-D68 strains that fell into the major group 3 show some amino acid substitutions, including an amino acid deletion, with most of the differences located in the immunogenic BC-and DE-loops. 9 The nucleotide sequences of the present study were submitted to Gen-Bank Database with accession numbers KP090456-KP090459 and KP122208. These EV-D68 strains were found in nasopharyngeal aspirates from three female infants less than one year of age, and in bronchoalveolar lavage and tracheal aspirate from two adults. Clinical and demographic features of EV-D68 infected patients are summarised in Table 2 . All of them developed respiratory symptoms, but only one required Intensive Care Unit admission due to the severity of the infection. Coinfection was frequent, in three out of five patients. None of the patients described had symptoms of neurological disease or paralysis.
