GLTSCR2 for production of viral particles. To investigate whether GLTSCR2 might play any role in viral replication, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knock down GLTSCR2 in cells, followed by infection with Rhabdoviridae vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Paramyxoviridae Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and Coronaviridae infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). As shown in Fig. 1a , decreases of GLTSCR2 resulted in reduced production of viral particles of VSV, NDV, and IBV by ~60, ~120, and ~20 folds, respectively. GLTSCR2 reduction also resulted in decreased levels of viral proteins in cells, indicating an important role of GLTSCR2 for production of various viruses. To investigate if viral infection might modulate GLTSCR2 level in cells, we studied the timecourse of GLTSCR2 during VSV infection, and we detected that GLTSCR2 level was not significantly affected by viral infection (Fig. 1b) , indicating the endogenous level of GLTSCR2 was sufficient to support viral replication. Studies indicated that the C-terminal region ranging from residue 347 to 478 contains key nucleolar localization sequences 29, 30 . The C-terminal region of residues 330 to 478 plays a role in GLTSCR2 interaction with other cellular proteins, such as PTEN 33, 34 , p53 35, 36 , and merlin 37 . The region of residues 342 to 386 is also responsible for homo-dimerization or even homo-oligomerization 38 . To understand if these putative domains might be important in GLTSCR2-involved viral replication, we constructed plasmid expression vectors to carry gene fragments encoding G3 (residues 330-432) and G4 (residues 241-478). We transfected HEp-2 cells with these expression vectors individually and infected cells with VSV. We detected that ectopic expression of the full length, wild-type (wt) GLTSCR2 enhanced viral replication, indexed by viral proteins VSV-G and NDV-P (Fig. 1c) . Expression of G3 or G4 appeared to enhance viral replication to a comparable level as enhanced by wt GLTSCR2 (Fig. 1c) . These preliminary results indicated that the integrity of C-terminal region G3 (residues 330-432) was important for GLTSCR2 in support of viral replication. To further verify the function of these regions in viral replication, we ectopically expressed wt, G3, and G4 of GLTSCR2 and infected cells with NDV or IBV. As shown in Fig. 1d ,e, ectopic expression of wt and variants of GLTSCR2 was able to increase gene expression of viral NDV-N (Fig. 1d) and IBV-N (Fig. 1e) , especially in 24 hours after viral infection. Meanwhile, expression of wt GLTSCR2, but not G3 or G4, consistently resulted in upregulation of these viral genes in 6 hours after viral infection and supported viral replication to higher levels than G3 and G4 did throughout the entire infection course. The results lead us to suggest that GLTSCR2 played a supportive role in viral replication. Translocation of GLTSCR2 to cytoplasm for VSV replication. GLTSCR2 is a nuclear protein. It was reported that the translocation of GLTSCR2 from nucleus to cytoplasm was induced by infection with HSV-1 32 , however, it was not clear whether GLTSCR2 cytoplasmic translocation might be associated with viral replication. To verify the cytoplasmic translocation of GLTSCR2 in response to VSV replication, we ectopically expressed GFP-tagged GLTSCR2 in HeLa cells, followed by infection of cells with VSV. As shown in Fig. 2a , GFP-tagged GLTSCR2 was detectable in the nucleus (lane 1), and then was detected in the cytoplasm by 7 (lane 2) and 10 (lane 3) hours after viral infection. Cytoplasmic translocation of GFP-tagged GLTSCR2 was blocked by leptomycin B (LMB) (lane 4), which is able to inhibit broad range of nuclear protein export pathways mediated by CRM1/exportin 1 39 , indicating that the export of GLTSCR2 to cytoplasm was in a CRM1-dependent manner. In addition, GLTSCR2-∆ GLT variant, in which the nuclear export sequence (NES, residues 358 to 370) was deleted, failed to translocate into the cytoplasm after VSV infection (lane 5). Furthermore, the levels of viral production (Fig. 2b , left) and viral proteins (Fig. 2b , right) were greatly increased by ectopic expression of wt GLTSCR2. The ectopic expression of GLTSCR2-∆ GLT, however, resulted in slightly increased production of viral particles (Fig. 2b) . The results indicated that cytoplasmic translocation of GLTSCR2 played an important role in support of VSV replication.
