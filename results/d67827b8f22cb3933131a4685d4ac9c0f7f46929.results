Previously, we tested the mechanism of target cell replenishment in the basic coinfection model ( Pinky and Dobrovolny, 2016 ) and confirmed that addition of a renewable supply of cells was necessary for chronic infection. However, that model could not produce long-lasting infections with both viruses ( Pinky and Dobrovolny, 2017 ) . The basic coinfection model did not consider superinfection mechanism, so here we aim to determine whether allowing single cells to be infected by both viruses (superinfection) can lead to chronic coinfection.
