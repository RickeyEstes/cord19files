During the study period from January 2014 to December 2017, a total of 408 patients positive for MERS-CoV were treated at PMAH. We excluded 72 patients who had only 1 swab result available, because these patients were treated during the initial years of the disease. Of the remaining 336 patients, 300 (89%) had a positive result after 1 swab, 324 (96.5%) had a positive result after 2 consecutive swabs, and 328 (97.6%) had a positive result after 3 consecutive swabs (Fig 1) . The majority of samples (70%) were nasopharyngeal samples, but in critically ill and intubated patients, most samples were tracheal aspirates, with only a few sputum samples collected. A total of 1,745 tests were done for all the patients, of which 967 (55.4%) were positive, 662 (38%) were negative, and 116 (6.64%) were probable. Of the total patients, 46 (13.7%) had a positive MERS-CoV test results, then a negative test result, followed by positive test results (Fig 2) . Of those patients, 8 (19%) were health care workers, 17 (40.5%) were primary cases, and 10 (23%) died. All patients were symptomatic, and 72% had evidence of pneumonia on chest radiography. Seventeen patients (40.5%) did not receive steroid therapy, and 10 patients (23%) received ribavirin/interferon. Thus, it was not possible to correlate the effect of any medications with the intermittent positive samples.
