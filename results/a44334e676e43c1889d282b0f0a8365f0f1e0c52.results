We estimated that the daily reproduction number, R t , varied during January 2020, with median values ranging from 1.6-2.6 between 1st January 2020 and the introduction of travel restrictions on 23rd January (Figure 2A ). We estimated a decline in R t in late January, from 2.35 (95% CI: 1.15-4.77) on 16 th of January, one week before the restrictions, to 1.05 (95% CI: 0.413-2.39) on 31 st January. The model reproduced the observed temporal trend of cases within Wuhan and cases exported internationally, capturing all of the dynamics reflected by these different data streams ( Figure 2B -D). Our results suggested there were around tenfold more symptomatic cases in Wuhan in late January than were reported as confirmed cases ( Figure 2E ), but the model not predict the slowdown in cases that was observed in early February. The model could also reproduce the pattern of confirmed exported cases from Wuhan, which was not explicitly used in the model fitting ( Figure 2F ). We found that confirmed and estimated exported cases among the twenty countries most connected to China were generally in good correspondence, with the USA and Australia as notable outliers, having had more confirmed cases reported with a travel history to Wuhan than would be expected in the model ( Figure 2G ). We estimated that 100% (95% CI: 51-100%) of cases would be eventually had detectable symptoms, implying that most infections that were exported internationally from Wuhan in late January were eventually detected. To examine the potential for new outbreaks to establish in locations outside of Wuhan, we used our estimates of the reproduction number to simulate new outbreaks with potential individual-level variation in transmission (i.e. 'superspreading events') (13, 19, 20) . Such variation increases the fragility of transmission chains, making it less likely that an outbreak will take off following a single introduction; if transmission is more homogeneous, with all infectious individuals generating a similar number of secondary cases, it is more likely than an outbreak will establish (19) . Based on the median reproduction number estimated during January before travel restrictions were introduced, we estimated that a single introduction of 2019-nCoV with SARS-like or MERS-like individual-level variation in transmission would have a 20-28% probability of causing a large outbreak ( Figure 3A ). Assuming SARS-like variation and Wuhan-like transmission, we estimated that once four or more infections have been introduced into a new location, there is an over 50% chance that an outbreak will occur ( Figure 3B ). .
