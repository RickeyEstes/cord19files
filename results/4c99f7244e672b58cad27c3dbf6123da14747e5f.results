Among the 68 responding hospitals, 57 hospitals use EDI and the other 11 do not. Only the 57 hospitals using EDI are considered in the data analysis. The EDI users consist of 41 (71.9%) Level III hospitals, 12 (21.1%) Level II hospitals, and four (7.0%) Level I hospitals. In terms of ownership, 21 hospitals (36.8%) belong to the MOH, 22 hospitals (38.6%) belong to the government of Beijing, 11 hospitals (19.3%) belong to a district of the Beijing city, and the remaining includes a county hospital and two military hospitals. The average number of employees in the Level I, Level II, and Level III hospitals are 470, 757, and 1608, respectively. Respondents reported three types of EDI connections: internal EDI, regional EDI, and military EDI. As discussed earlier, the domain of EDI is restricted in this study as a result of Chinese IT managers' perceptions. Internal EDI is intra-organizational document exchange at the departmental level. Regional EDI refers to inter-organizational document exchange in the organizational level but restricted within a certain geographical area. In China, EDI services are provided by the government's EDI centers located in major cities at regional, national, or international level. Military EDI is separate from the commercial EDI systems in China. Due to security concerns, the authors could not obtain information about military EDI. Among our participating hospitals, 36 (63.2%) use internal EDI, 20 (35.1%) use regional EDI, and one uses military EDI.
