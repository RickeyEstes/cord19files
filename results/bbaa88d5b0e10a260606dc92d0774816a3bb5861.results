The Effect ofAge on the Induction of SGVHD Initial studies were undertaken to assess the effect of age on the induction of SGVHD in Lewis rats treated with C&A after syngeneic marrow transplants . Animals of 1, 3, or 6 mo of age were irradiated, reconstituted with marrow from similarly aged Marrow-derived T Lymphocytes in Syngeneic Graft-versus-Host Disease syngeneic donors, respectively, and treated with graded doses of CsA for 30 d. The results in Fig. 1 demonstrate a significant effect of age on the induction of SGVHD. 1-mo-old transplanted Lewis rats demonstrated a virtual 100% incidence of SGVHD when treated with 10 and 15 mg of CSA ; a 70% incidence was observed when the animals were treated with 5 mg/kg of this drug. In contrast, a moderate incidence (50%) of SGVHD was observed in animals that were transplanted at 3 mo of age, and only at the highest dose of CsA tested . A minimal incidence of SGVHD was observed in rats that were initially transplanted at 6 mo of age. A series of experiments was performed to further analyze the effect of age on the induction of SGVHD by separating marrow donors and recipients on the basis of age. The study was designed to assess whether donor and/or host age is a factor that influences the frequency of SGVHD induced with CsA . Lewis rats of either 1, 3, or 6 mo of age were used as donors of bone marrow for lethally irradiated 10-wk-old recipients . The reciprocal experiment was performed in which the 1-, 3-, and 6-mo-old Lewis rats served as recipients of bone marrow from 10-wk-old rats. The recipients were treated with graded doses of CsA for 30 d after irradiation and bone marrow reconstitution . Fig . 2 A illustrates that there was a significant (p < 2 x 10-4) correlation of the age of the marrow donor with the induction of SGVHD in 10-wk-old recipients . The greatest frequency of SGVHD was observed in animals grafted with marrow from rats 1 mo of age. Marrow derived from animals 3 or 6 mo of age resulted in a decreased incidence of SGVHD. Comparatively, the age of recipient also correlated (p < 10-3) with the ability of CsA to induce SGVHD. The youngest recipients had the greatest incidence of SGVHD. The effect of the dose of CsA was more intimately associated with donor age than with recipient age. However, lowering the doses of CsA administered in the recipient study (Fig . 2 B ) was reflected in a less dramatic decline in incidence. Additional studies summarized in Fig. 3 further assessed Figure 1 . The effect of age on the induction of SGVHD with graded doses of CSA. Lewis rats of 1, 3, and 6 mo of age were irradiated and grafted with marrow from similarly aged syngeneic rats, respectively. The recipients were treated with graded doses of C&A for 30 d, and the incidence of SGVHD was observed after discontinuation of CsA therapy. (n -8 per group) .
