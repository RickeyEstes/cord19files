Mutational analysis of the putative Q 1491(1b) -G 1492(1b) cleavage site We have previously reported the identification of a 100-kDa protein encoded by nucleotides 12,313 to 15, 131 in IBV-infected Vero cells using an ORF 1b-specific antiserum V58 (Liu et al., 1994; . Two Q-S dipeptide bonds (Q 3928 -S 3929 and Q 891(1b) -S 892(1b) ) encoded by nucleotides 12,310 to 12,315 and 15, 129 to 15, 134, respectively, were determined to be the N-and C-terminal cleavage sites of the 100-kDa protein. In addition to the Q 891(1b) -S 892(1b) dipeptide bond, three more potential cleavage sites of the 3C-like proteinase have been predicted to be located in the 1b polyprotein (Fig.  1 ). The first one is the Q 1491(1b) -G 1492(1b) dipeptide bond encoded by nucleotides 16,929 to 16,934 ( Fig. 1) . In order to test if this is a genuine scissile bond of the 3C-like proteinase, plasmid pIBV14⌬1Q 891(1b) -E (Fig. 2a) , which was constructed for studying the C-terminal cleavage site of the 100-kDa protein (see , was first expressed in Vero cells. As the Q 891(1b) -E mutation introduced in this construct significantly reduced the cleavage efficiency occurring at the Q 891(1b) -S 892(1b) dipeptide bond, it would allow us to use antiserum V58, which recognizes the 100-kDa protein only, to detect a fusion product containing the 100-kDa protein and products encoded by the downstream region (see Fig. 2a ). As expected, expression of pIBV14⌬1Q 891(1b) -E led to the detection of four polypeptides by immunoprecipitation with antiserum V58 (Fig. 2b, lane 6 ). In addition to the 100-kDa cleavage product and a 160-kDa protein representing the full-length product expressed from this construct, a 125-kDa protein and a product migrating slightly more slowly on SDS±PAGE than the 125-kDa product were observed (Fig. 2b, lane 6) . The estimated molecular weight of the latter species is approximately 130 kDa (Fig. 2b, lane 6) . The apparent molecular masses of these two products and their expression patterns suggest that the C-termini of the 125-and 130-kDa proteins may be derived, respectively, from cleavage occurring at the Q 1491(1b) -G 1492(1b) dipeptide bond and from termination of translation at a UAA termination codon 47 amino acid residues downstream of the G 1492(1b) residue (see Fig. 2a ). It is therefore likely that cleavage may occur at the Q 1491(1b) -G 1492(1b) dipeptide bond. To support this possibility further, plasmid pIBV21 was constructed and expressed. This plasmid was based on pIBV14⌬1Q 891(1b) -E, but the Q 1491(1b) residue was mutated to an M by PCR (Fig. 2a) . Meanwhile, the 3Ј end of the IBV sequence present in pIBV14⌬1Q 891(1b) -E was extended up to nucleotide 17,630 (Fig. 2a) . As can be seen, expression of pIBV21 resulted in the detection of three products (Fig. 2b , lane 5). In addition to the 100-kDa protein and the 180-kDa full-length product, a protein species migrating on SDS±PAGE much more slowly than the 125-kDa protein was observed (Fig. 2b , lane 5). Its apparent molecular weight of approximately 155 kDa suggested that it is a fusion protein comprising the 125-kDa protein and the product encoded by nucleotides 16,932 to 17,630 (Fig. 2a) . These results confirm that mutation of the Q 1491(1b) residue to an M completely blocked cleavage occurring at this position and suggest that the Q 1491(1b) -G 1492(1b) dipeptide bond is a cleavage site of the 3C-like proteinase. The IBV sequence used to raise antiserum V58 and the substitution mutations introduced are indicated. Also shown are the predicted cleavage products that could be detected by immunoprecipitation with antiserum V58 and a UAA termination codon located 47 amino acid residues downstream of the G 1492(1b) residue. (b) Analysis of transiently expressed products from transfection of plasmids pIBV14⌬1Q 891(1b) -E and pIBV21. Plasmid DNAs were expressed in Vero cells using the vaccinia virus-T7 expression system (Fuerst et al., 1986) . Semiconfluent monolayers of Vero cells were infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF7-3) and transfected with plasmid DNA using DOTAP according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). Cells were labeled with [ 35 S]methionine, lysates were prepared, and polypeptides were either analyzed directly (lanes 1±3) or immunoprecipitated with antiserum V58 (lanes 4±6). The radiolabeled polypeptides were separated on an SDS±12.5% polyacrylamide gel and detected by fluorography. Control DNA (lanes 1 and 4)-a plasmid contains the IBV sequence from nucleotides 8693 to 13,896. HMW, high molecular weight markers (numbers indicate kilodaltons). Proteolytic processing of products encoded by the 3Ј-terminal 3.5-kb region of ORF 1b We next set up to analyze if the two predicted cleavage sites (Q 2012(1b) -S 2013(1b) and Q 2350(1b) -S 2351(1b) ) encoded by nucleotides 18,492 to 18,497 and 19,506 to 19,511, respectively, are cleavage sites of the 3C-like proteinase (see Fig. 1 ). For this purpose, plasmid pIBV1b4, which covers the IBV sequence from nucleotides 16,932 to 20,490 ( Fig. 3a ) was expressed either on its own or together with pIBV3C, a plasmid which contains the IBV sequence coding for the 3C-like proteinase and has been shown to possess trans-cleavage activity (Liu et al., 1997) . As the results in Fig. 3b show, expression of pIBV1b4 in Vero cells led to the synthesis of a protein with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 132 kDa, representing the full-length product encoded by this construct; this product was immunoprecipitated by antiserum V17 (Fig. 3b, lane 1) . No processing of the 132-kDa protein to smaller products was observed (Fig. 3b , lane 1). Cotransfection of pIBV1b4 with pIBV3C, however, resulted in the detection of five protein species (Fig. 3b , lane 2). In addition to the 132-kDa full-length product, four other protein species with apparent molecular masses of approximately 97, 74, 39, and 35 kDa, respectively, were also detected (Fig. 3b, lane 2) . Among them, the 132-, 97-, 74-, and 39-kDa products were immunoprecipitated efficiently by antiserum V17; only trace amount of the 35-kDa protein, however, was detected from the same cell lysate (Fig. 3b, lane 2) . These results suggest that the four smaller products may represent mature and intermediate cleavage products of the 132-kDa polyprotein. Pulse±chase and time course experiments were then carried out to define further the processing pattern of the products expressed from cotransfection of pIBV1b4 and pIBV3C. For this purpose, Vero cells were cotransfected with pIBV1b4 and pIBV3C, labeled with [ 35 S]methionine for 4 h at 13 h posttransfection, and chased with a 10-fold excess of cold methionine up to 10 h. As shown in Fig.  3c , the 132-, 97-, and 74-kDa proteins were detected after labeling for 2 h and remained detectable after chase for 10 h. The 39-and 35-kDa proteins appeared after chase for 2 h and were increased gradually with time ( Fig. 3c ). Further analysis of the expression and processing of products encoded by the 3Ј-terminal region of ORF 1b As shown in Fig. 3a , the 132-kDa protein encoded by pIBV1b4 contains two putative Q-S cleavage sites (Q 2012(1b) -S 2013(1b) and Q 2350(1b) -S 2351 (1b) ). Cleavage at these two positions would result in the formation of three mature products with calculated molecular masses of 58, 38, and 34 kDa, respectively. The apparent molecular masses of 39 and 35 kDa of the two proteins detected from coexpression of pIBV1b4 and pIBV3C suggest that they may represent the two C-terminal cleavage products. To investigate this possibility, plasmid pIBV1b5 was constructed and expressed in Vero cells. This plasmid covers the IBV sequence from nucleotides 18,930 to 20,874 and has the potential to encode a product of 59 kDa (Fig. 4a) . Transfection of pIBV1b5 alone led to the synthesis of a polypeptide of approximately 59 kDa, consistent with the calculated full-length product of 59 kDa encoded by this construct (Fig. 4b, lane 1) . As expected, two additional products with apparent molecular masses of 24 and 35 kDa were produced from coexpression of pIBV1b5 and pIBV3C (Fig. 4b, lane 2) . The 35-kDa protein comigrates on SDS±PAGE with the 35-kDa protein produced from coexpression of pIBV1b4 and pIBV3C (Fig.  4b, lanes 2 and 4) , indicating that they are the same cleavage product from the C-terminal region of the 1b polyprotein. However, the detection of the 35-kDa protein from coexpression of pIBV1b5 and pIBV3C was disproportionately more efficient than that from coexpression of pIBV1b4 and pIBV3C (Fig. 4b, lanes 2 and 4) . The reason for this discrepancy is currently uncertain. Mutational analysis of the putative Q 2350(1b) -S 2351(1b) and Q 2012(1b) -S 2013(1b) cleavage sites The results presented above suggest that cleavage of the 1b polyprotein by the 3C-like proteinase may occur at the Q 2350(1b) -S 2351(1b) dipeptide bond, resulting in the release of a mature product of 35 kDa. To support further if cleavage did occur at this position, substitution of the Q 2350(1b) residue with an E was introduced by site- FIG. 2ÐContinued directed mutagenesis, giving a mutant construct pIBV1b4Q 2350(1b) -E. Expression of this plasmid in Vero cells resulted in the synthesis, once again, of the fulllength 132-kDa polyprotein (Fig. 5, lane 1) . Coexpression of pIBV1b4Q 2350(1b) -E with pIBV3C led to the detection of an additional protein of approximately 74 kDa (Fig. 5,  lanes 2 and 5) . This product comigrates on SDS±PAGE with the 74-kDa protein detected from cotransfection of pIBV1b4 and pIBV3C (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and 6) . No other cleavage products were detected (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 5) , (1b) ) dipeptide bonds and the predicted cleavage products that could be detected by immunoprecipitation with antiserum V17. (b) Analysis of transiently expressed products from transfection of pIBV1b4 and cotransfection of pIBV1b4 and pIBV3C. Cells were labeled with [ 35 S]methionine, lysates were prepared, and polypeptides were immunoprecipitated with antiserum V17. The radiolabeled polypeptides were separated on an SDS±12.5% polyacrylamide gel and detected by fluorography. Numbers indicate molecular mass in kilodaltons. (c) Pulse±chase analysis of the expression, processing, and accumulation of products from cotransfection of pIBV1b4 and pIBV3C. Cells were labeled with [ 35 S]methionine for 4 h at 13 h posttransfection, chased with a 10-fold excess of cold methionine, and harvested after chase for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h. Cell lysates were then prepared and were either analyzed directly or subjected to immunoprecipitation with antiserum V17. The radiolabeled polypeptides were separated on an SDS±12.5% polyacrylamide gel and detected by fluorography. HMW, high molecular weight markers (numbers indicate kilodaltons). suggesting that mutation of the Q 2350(1b) residue to an E did block the cleavage occurring at this position. This result indicates that the Q 2350(1b) -S 2351(1b) dipeptide bond may be the cleavage site responsible for releasing the N-terminus of the 35-kDa protein and the C-terminus of the 39-kDa protein from the 1b polyprotein. The 74-kDa protein detected from coexpression of pIBV1b4 and pIBV3C is therefore representing an intermediate cleavage product encoded by ORF 1b from nucleotides 18,495 to 20,414. Substitution of the Q 2012(1b) residue of the predicted Q 2012(1b) -S 2013(1b) cleavage site with an E was subsequently made by site-directed mutagenesis, giving a mutant construct pIBV1b4Q 2012(1b) -E. Coexpression of this plasmid with pIBV3C led to the synthesis of three protein species, the 132-kDa protein and two products comigrated, respectively, with the 97-and 35-kDa proteins detected from coexpression of pIBV1b4 and pIBV3C (Fig.  5, lanes 4 and 6) . No 39-and 74-kDa proteins were detected (Fig. 5, lane 4) , suggesting that mutation of the Q 2012(1b) residue to an E abolished cleavage occurring at the Q 2012(1b) -S 2013(1b) bond. This result indicates that the Q 2012(1b) -S 2013(1b) dipeptide bond is recognized and cleaved by the 3C-like proteinase to release the N-terminus of the 39-kDa protein and the C-terminus of a putative 58-kDa protein. The 97-kDa protein detected from coexpression of pIBV1b4 and pIBV3C is therefore an intermediate cleavage product containing the 39-and 58-kDa proteins.
