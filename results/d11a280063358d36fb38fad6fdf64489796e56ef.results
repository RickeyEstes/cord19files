The effects of UV 254 dose, temperature, and relative humidity on the concentration of PRRS virus (TCID 50 ) recovered in air samples were all statistically significant (p < 0.001), as were the interactions between UV 254 dose Â temperature (p = 0.0475), and UV 254 dose Â relative relative humidity (p = 0.0204). Inactivation constant estimates and UV 254 half-life dose estimates are given in Table  3 . Comparisons among the three temperature groups detected a significant difference in the UV 254 inactivation constant for PRRS virus at low vs. high temperatures (p = 0.0167), but not between low vs. medium (p = 0.1044) or medium vs. high temperatures (p = 0.4635). Comparisons among the three levels of relative humidity revealed a statistically significant difference in inactivation constants between medium vs. high relative humidity (p = 0.0060), but not between and low vs. medium (p = 0.0700) or low vs. high relative humidity (p = 0.3291).
