Purification and characterization of the NC fusion protein The RT-PCR product of the NC segment from Isolate BJ01 was cloned into pGEM-T vector. The recombinant pGEM-T was further PCR amplified with the yeast-cloning primer pair. After verification by DNA sequencing, the PCR product was co-transformed into yeast with the linearized pEGH vector, and the yeast transformants were selected on proper media. The resulting recombinant plasmids were rescued into bacteria, and named as pEGH-NC. The pEGH-NC constructs were restricted with EcoR I to determine whether their inserts were in the right sizes ( Figure  1A ). Confirmed plasmids were further analyzed with DNA sequencing to validate their identities and reading frames. The confirmed plasmids were re-introduced into yeast cells for the production of the GST-Hisx6-NC fusion protein. Probed with anti-Hisx6 antibodies in a Western analysis, the lysate of the induced yeast cells emerged a band with the expected molecular weight of the fusion protein, which is absent in the control carrying the empty vector, indicating that the NC fragment was specifically expressed in the proper yeast strains ( Figure 1B ). Using the GST affinity tag, the fusion protein was purified using glutathione agarose beads, and separated by SDS-PAGE (SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis). Coomassie Blue staining ( Figure 1C ) demonstrated that the fusion protein was purified with high quality and purity without any detectable contamination.
