Of the 486 local health offices of Japan, 451 (93%) responded. Table 1 shows the overview of the questionnaire survey. A total of 17 health offices reported that they took the lead in one or more of the contact investigations on 19 index TB patients who boarded airplanes between February 2012 and September 2015. The median duration between the dates of the air travel and the TB diagnosis of the patients was 1 month, ranging from 1 to 4 months. The total number of eligible contacts the initiator health offices reported, excluding those who had contact with the index cases outside of the airplanes, was 942, of whom 574 (61%) were screened for TB and 523 (56%) had IGRA test results available. Six eligible contacts declined TB screening. Thus, the response rate (the sum of those who were screened and who declined, divided by the number of eligible contacts) was 62%. An additional 70 health offices reported that they implemented the contact investigations for one or more of the contacts of 23 index TB patients (requested by foreign countries and the health offices that did not respond in our study) and provided IGRA test results on 128 contacts. Of the total 651 contacts, 25 (3.8%; 95% CI: 2.5-5.6) were positive for IGRA (Table 2) . Among 205 contacts aged 0-34 years, two (1.0%; 95% CI: 0.12-3.5) were positive for IGRA. All of the 651 contacts were resident in Japan, however, details on their nationality were not known. The Cochran-Armitage test revealed that there was a statistically significant increasing trend towards a correlation between age group and positivity of IGRA test results (p < 0.0094). For eight contacts with negative IGRA test results reported by the implementer health offices, the information on flight date, flight route or flight number was not available, and we were unable to cross-check this with the information from the initiator health offices. Thus, we excluded the eight contacts from the database. No contact developed TB disease after contact with a TB case on an airplane.
