Six cell cultures inoculated with samples collected on 4 different days displayed cytopathic effects within 3-11 days postinoculation. Viral genomic RNA extracted from virions in spent culture media was identified as that of CoV-229E by the GenMark multiplex PCR eSensor XT-8 Respiratory Viral Panel. Desktops and the doorknob were the most commonly contaminated surfaces ( Table 1 ). The complete genome sequence of Human coronavirus 229E/UF-1/2016 was determined from 1 isolate (GenBank: KY996417.1). After 7 days, there was an approximate reduction of the viable virus count of CoV-299E VR-740 by about 2.5 logs; however, a significant quantity of virus remained infectious (Fig 1) .
