Characterization of the Human AOs. Based on the recently reported protocol (14) , we established several lines of AOs from small pieces of normal lung tissue adjacent to the diseased tissue from patients undergoing surgical resection for clinical conditions. These AOs, 3D cysts lined by polarized epithelium, accommodated the four major types of airway epithelial cells, i.e., ciliated cells (ACCTUB + or FOXJ1 + ), goblet cells (MUC5AC + ), basal cells (P63 + ), and club cells (CC10 + ) (Fig. 1A) . Apical ACCTUB clearly indicated the orientation of polarization. Most organoids are orientated towards the lumen (Fig. 1A , ACCTUB Left), while a small proportion of the organoids are inverted (Fig. 1A , ACCTUB Right). Beating cilia were visible (Movie S1). No type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells were present. Thus, these organoids resembled the pseudostratified ciliated airway epithelium. The AOs were inoculated with human IAV H1N1pdm, the low-pathogenic avian virus H7N9/Ah, and the highly pathogenic avian virus H5N1. The intracellular (cell lysate) viral loads of all three virus strains increased over 2 log 10 units (Fig. 1B) . The extracellular (supernatant) viral loads, especially the viral titers, were elevated by 2-3 log 10 units. Ciliary beating plays an essential role in human airway biology and pathology, and 50-80% of airway epithelial cells are ciliated (17) . However, immunostaining (Fig. 1A ) and flow cytometry indicated that ciliated cells were apparently underrepresented in these AOs. Therefore, despite the discernible multilineage differentiation and the ability to support replication of IAVs, further improvements in morphology and differentiation appeared required. PD of the AOs. To improve proximal differentiation (PD), we tried various protocols and variations thereof and settled on a medium described by Konishi et al. (18) for inducing ciliary differentiation in human PSC-derived airway epithelial spheroids. The ASCderived organoids in the original AO medium gradually enlarged, while those in PD medium became more compact ( Fig. 2A) . After 16 d of culture, the organoids in AO medium grew approximately two times larger, while the organoids in PD medium remained basically unchanged in size (Fig. 2B) . From day 7, the number of ciliated cells increased markedly in PD medium. At day 16, beating cilia were observed in a minority (<10%) of the organoids in AO medium, while abundant beating cilia were present in every PD organoid ( Fig. 2C and Movies S2 and S3). The synchronously beating cilia drove the cell debris within the organoid lumens to swirl unidirectionally (Movie S3). The dramatically increased abundance of ciliated cells in the PD organoids was verified by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 2D) . Consistently, the transcriptional levels of the ciliated cell markers FOXJ1 and SNTN were strongly up-regulated in the PD organoids compared with the organoids in AO medium. The expression levels of the basal cell markers P63 and CK5 and the goblet cell marker MUC5AC also increased, whereas the levels of club cell markers CC10 and SCGB3A2 were substantially down-regulated in the PD organoids (Fig. 3A) . Importantly, we observed globally elevated expression of serine proteases including TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, TMPRSS11D (HAT), and matriptase, which are essential for the activation and propagation of human IAVs and low-pathogenic avian IAVs (8) . We also performed flow cytometry analysis to measure the percentages of the four cell types in the organoids cultured in two distinct media at day 16. It was shown that the percentage of ciliated cells increased remarkably, by about threefold, after PD, to over 40% in the PD organoids, while the ciliated cells invariably constituted a minority of the cells in the organoids in AO medium (Fig. 3 B and C). Goblet cells also increased marginally, while club cells consistently decreased after PD (Fig. 3 B and C) . Collectively, we successfully induced mucociliary differentiation and developed PD AOs which morphologically and functionally simulate human airway epithelium. PD AOs Can Identify Human-Infective Virus. One of the most important and challenging issues for influenza research is to predict which animal or emerging influenza virus can infect humans. As mentioned above, the novel reassortant avian H7N9 viruses have caused continuing poultry-to-human transmission since 2013. In fact, other subtypes of avian IAVs, including H7N2, H9N2, and H9N9, have been cocirculating with the H7N9 viruses in domestic poultry. These viruses are highly similar in internal genes but differ in neuraminidase (NA) or HA and NA (19) . However, very few human infections by H7N2, H9N2, and H9N9 virus have been reported in the same territory and time frame, although people were exposed equivalently to these viruses and the H7N9 viruses (20) ; these findings suggest that these viruses are less infective to humans than the H7N9 viruses. We isolated, plaque-purified, and genotyped these cocirculating viruses. We chose to compare the infectivity of H7N2 with that of H7N9/Ah in the PD organoids as a proof of concept, to verify that the differentiated AOs can indeed simulate human airway epithelium in the context of influenza virus infection. Fig.  4 shows that viral loads in the cell lysate and medium of H7N9/ Ah-infected organoids increased gradually after inoculation; the viral titer increased more than 3 log 10 units within 24 h, indicating a robust viral replication. The addition of the serine protease inhibitor AEBSF significantly restricted the active replication of H7N9/Ah virus, highlighting the importance of elevated serine proteases for viral replication. In contrast, H7N2 propagated modestly, with viral titer 2-3 log 10 units lower than H7N9/Ah. Thus, the distinct efficiencies of H7N9/Ah and H7N2 to infect and replicate in the PD AOs can recapitulate the infectivity of these viruses in humans. Establishing a 2D Airway Monolayer from AOs to Assess the Infectivity of IAVs. A limitation of 3D organoids for studying microbial infections is the inaccessibility of the apical surface to pathogens, since most organoids are orientated inwards, while receptors for most respiratory viruses are distributed in the apical surface. For virus inoculation, organoids must be sheared to enable sufficient apical exposure to virus inoculum (21) . As reported previously, primary bronchial epithelial cells cultured in Transwell inserts with the defined medium undergo mucociliary differentiation (22) . This prompted us to transform 3D AOs into a 2D monolayer using Transwell culture. To this end, 3D AOs were enzymatically dissociated into a single-cell suspension, seeded in Transwell inserts, and then cultured in PD medium. The transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in the 2D monolayers stabilized in the second week after seeding (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 ). In addition, the dextran penetration assay performed at day 12 indicated that an intact epithelial barrier was formed across the 2D monolayers (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 ). The intense signal of ACCTUB indicated that the 2D monolayers developed appreciable PD (Fig. 5A) . The productive infection of H7N9/Ah was clearly shown by the virus nucleoprotein-positive (NP + ) cells at 8 h post infection (hpi) in the 2D PD organoids (Fig. 5A) . To verify the ability of 2D PD organoids to assess the zoonotic potential of animal viruses and identify the human-infective virus, we compared the relative replication capacities of H7N9/Ah and H7N2 viruses and of another pair of viruses, the highly human-infective H1N1pdm and a swine H1N1 isolate (H1N1sw). The higher replicative capacity of H7N9/Ah over H7N2 virus was more pronounced in the 2D PD organoids than in the 3D PD organoids; the viral titer of H7N9/Ah in the apical medium was 3-4 log 10 units higher than that of the H7N2 virus (Fig. 5B) . Consistently, H1N1pdm replicated dramatically, with a viral titer in the apical medium 1-2 log 10 units higher than that of H1N1sw. Due to the epithelial barrier formed in the 2D monolayers and the preferential release of virus from the cell apical side, the viral titers in the basolateral medium were consistently lower than those in apical medium at the corresponding time points. Nevertheless, the differences in replicative capacity between H7N9/ Ah versus H7N2 and H1N1pdm versus H1N1sw were even more prominent in basal medium than in apical medium at most time points.
