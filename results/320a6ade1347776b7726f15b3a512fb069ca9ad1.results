A total of 13,878 isolation rooms were observed for 3,969 unique patients between January and November 2009. The total days of observation were 85 days for the PF and 123 days for the WBF, the total number of patient rooms observed were 5,207 for the PF and 8,671 for the WBF, the median number of rooms observed per day were 60 for the PF (PF range, 19-128) and 61 for the WBF (range, , and the average observation time per room was 149 seconds for the PF and 60 seconds for the WBF. Overall, the WBF provided a savings of observation and data entry time of 89 seconds per room, which for this project extrapolates to 412 hours per year-a 60% savings. Using a salary of $31/hour for an observer or $50/hour for a nurse, using the WBF for observations would provide an annual savings of $12,772 or $20,600, respectively.
