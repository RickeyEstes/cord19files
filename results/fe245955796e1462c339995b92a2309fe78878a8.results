MHV replicase precursor p150 and product nsp4 are modified by N-linked glycosylation Previous studies indicated that MHV nsp4 is a glycoprotein (Oostra et al., 2007) , but it was unclear if the p150 precursor was also modified. To determine if both the precursor p150 and the mature product nsp4 are modified by N-linked glycosylation, we analyzed these proteins for sensitivity to tunicamycin and endoglycosidase H (endo H). MHV-infected cells were radiolabeled with 35 S-trans-label and either mock-treated or treated with tunicamycin and lysates and were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-nsp4 and then treated with endo H. We found that both the precursor p150 and the mature product nsp4 were modified by N-linked glycosylation and that these modifications were sensitive to endo H, indicating that these proteins did not progress past the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Fig. 1B) . Bioinformatic analysis indicated that nsp4 residues N176 and N237 are consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation (consensus sequence: NXS/T). To determine if nsp4-N176 and nsp4-N237 are specifically modified by N-linked glycosylation, a cDNA clone [MHV-Cen-nsp4 (Kanjanahaluethai and Baker, 2000) ] expressing the entire nsp4 region and the cleavage site recognized by PLP2, was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to generate alanine substitutions at these sites, and the mobility of WT and mutant forms of nsp4 was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Cells were transfected with constructs expressing pPLP2 (proteinase) and either WT or mutant forms of pCen-nsp4 DNA (substrate) and newly synthesized proteins were radiolabeled with 35 S-trans-label. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with an Î±-nsp4 antibody to detect the mature form of nsp4 generated by cleavage of Cen-nsp4 by PLP2. The immunoprecipitated nsp4 was either mocktreated or endo H treated and electrophoretic mobility of protein was assessed. As seen in Fig. 1C , nsp4 encoding either the N176A or N237A substitutions exhibited faster migration as compared to WT nsp4. The nsp4-N176A/N237A double mutant migrated faster than either single mutant. For products treated with endo H, which cleaves N-linked oligosaccharides, the mobility of all four proteins was similar to that of the nsp4-N176A/N237A double mutant, as expected. These data indicate that nsp4-N176 and nsp4-N237 are in fact subjected to N-linked glycosylation. Recent studies have suggested that an asparagine residue in the luminal domain of nsp4 is important for MHV RNA synthesis. Sawicki et al. (2005) analyzed a series of MHV temperature sensitive mutants that do not make viral RNA at the non-permissive temperature. They identified one virus, designated as Alb ts6, with an asparagine to threonine substitution at nsp4 residue 258. This residue was implicated as the site responsible for temperature sensitive defect. However, the mechanism by which this substitution in nsp4 causes the defect in RNA synthesis in Alb ts6 is not known. A schematic diagram of nsp4 topology indicating the position of the two asparagine residues modified by N-linked glycosylation, and an asparagine to threonine change predicted to be responsible for the temperature sensitive phenotype are depicted in Fig. 1D .
