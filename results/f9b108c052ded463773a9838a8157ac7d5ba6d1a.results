Cloning, expression and purification of linked and unlinked Zika NS2B-NS3pro-Based on the sequence alignment with NS2B and NS3pro of the Dengue serotype 2 we previously characterized (12) , the corresponding Zika sequences were identified for the NS2B (Fig. 1A) and NS3pro (Fig. 1B) of the Asian Zika virus. From synthetic genes with E. coli preferred codons, we amplified and subsequently cloned the DNA fragments into His-tagged expression vectors, which encode the isolated NS2B (48-100) with the transmembrane regions deleted (Fig. 1A) ; as well as isolated NS3 (14-185) (Fig. 1B) . The expression level of the recombinant NS2B was extremely low, and consequently we needed to grow many liters of E. coli cells to obtain sufficient NS2B for refolding with NS3pro by the same protocol we previously utilized for the Dengue one (12) . The refolded NS2B-NS3pro with His-tag (column 2 of Fig. 1C ) was cleaved by thrombin covalently linked to beads to remove the His-tag, followed by binding to an excess amount of the Ni 2+ -beads to remove His-tag and uncleaved fusion protein, as well as final purification with FPLC gel-filtration chromatography to obtain unlinked NS2B-NS3pro without His-tag (column 3 of Fig. 1C ). We attempted to refold Zika NS3pro without NS2B and found that NS3pro completely precipitated during refolding, thus indicating that Zika NS3pro also absolutely requests its NS2B cofactor for the correct folding, as previously observed on other flavivirus NS3 proteases (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . We also constructed a Zika protease with NS2B and NS3pro linked by a (Gly)4-Ser-(Gly)4 sequence extensively used for functional and structural characterization of flavivirus NS2B-NS3pro complexes (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . No linked NS2B-NS3pro protein was detected in the supernatant, but we were able to purify a small amount from the inclusion body by the Ni 2+affinity chromatography under the denaturing condition, which was confirmed to be the linked NS2B-NS3pro by sequencing with mass spectrometry and western plot with the His-tag antibody. Linked NS2B-NS3pro was successfully refolded by dialysis without any author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Subsequently, linked NS2B-NS3pro without His-tag (column 3 of Fig. 1D ) was obtained by the cleavage with thrombin covalently linked to beads, followed by binding to Ni 2+ -beads and final purification with FPLC gel-filtration chromatography as described above. Biophysical characterization-We acquired 1 H NMR one-dimensional spectra for both linked and unlinked NS2B-NS3pro ( Fig. 2A) . Both spectra have similar up-field peaks manifested, suggesting that both of them are folded (12, 20, 23, 24) . However, it is interesting to note that the peaks of the linked complex are much more broad than those of the unlinked, implying that the linkage may introduce µs-ms conformational dynamics, as previously observed on the linked Dengue NS2B-NS3pro (12, 20, 23) . Indeed, we attempted to acquire 1 H-15 N NMR HSQC spectrum of the linked protease, but failed to detect any peaks due to significant peak broadening. By contrast, despite having almost the same sequences, 15 N-labeled Zika NS3pro in the unlinked complex has a well-dispersed HSQC spectrum, indicating that the NS3pro is well-folded, although many HSQC peaks were still too broad to be detectable (Fig. 2B ). Amazingly, 15 N-labeled Zika NS2B in the unlinked complex has a very narrowly-dispersed HSQC spectrum, in which HSQC peaks of 22 residues are too broad to be detected, and in particular only two out of four Gly residues have HSQC peaks detectable (Fig. 2C ). This is very different from what was previously observed on Dengue NS2B in the complex, which showed a well-dispersed HSQC spectrum with peaks of most residues detectable (12, 20, 23) . This implies that Zika NS2B is much more dynamic than Dengue one, in which a portion of residues undergoes µs-ms dynamics, thus becoming too broad to be detectable; while the rest is disordered and absent of tight packing, thus resulting in narrowly-dispersed HSQC peaks (12, 23, 24) . author/funder.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/078113 doi: bioRxiv preprint 7 We also collected spectra of the intrinsic UV fluorescence from Trp residues for both linked and unlinked NS2B-NS3pro complexes (Fig. 2D) , both of which have similar spectra with the emission maxima at ~344 nm, very similar to what were observed on the NS2B-NS3pro complexes of all four Dengue serotypes (348 nm) (16) . This suggests that in Zika NS2B-NS3pro, all 4 Trp residues are similarly buried as Dengue ones, as Trp residue in the unfolded proteins has an emission maximum wavelength > 352 nm (24) . Strikingly, however, both linked and unlinked Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes have far-UV CD spectra with the maximal negative signal at the wavelength of ~201 nm and is lacking of any positive signal below 200 nm, which is very different from that of unlinked Dengue one of the same length (12) , which has the maximal negative signal at 217 nm and large positive signal at 192 nm ( Fig.   2E ). This strongly suggests that Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes contain much more disordered regions than the Dengue, completely consistent with the NMR HSQC result of the 15 N-labeled NS2B (Fig. 2C) . Unfortunately, the low solubility and µs-ms conformational dynamics prevented us from conducting NMR assignments of Zika NS2B-NS3pro by triple-resonance NMR experiments. Characterization of the enzymatic catalysis-We subsequently characterized the enzymatic properties of both linked and unlinked Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes. First, we found that the activity of both complexes showed a very similar dependence on the pH values, with the optimal pH at ~9.5 (Fig. 3A) , very similar to other flavivirus NS2B-NS3pro linked by (Gly4)-Ser-(Gly4) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . Amazingly, this is very different from Dengue NS2B-NS3pro, for which the optimal pH significantly switched from basic pH to neutral pH upon separating NS2B from NS3pro (23) . Second, the catalytic activity reduced significantly upon increasing the concentrations of NaCl (Fig. 3B ). In the presence of 150 mM NaCl, the catalytic activity is author/funder.

Furthermore, to allow comparison with the kinetic results previously published on profiling the substrate specificity for the (Gly)4-Ser-(Gly)4 linked NS2B-NS3 proteases of all four Dengue serotypes (17) , here we selected the same three substrates, which were also extensively used for other flavivirus NS2B-NS3pro, namely Bz-nKRR-AMC; Boc-GRR-AMC and Boc-GKR-AMC. We also measured the proteolytic activities of our linked and unlinked Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes in the same buffer as previously published (17) . Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 3C , the Zika NS2B-NS3pro efficiently cleaved Bz-nKRR-AMC, but unexpectedly showed very weak activity on other two. This implies that in addition to requesting dibasic residues at the P1 and P2 sites characteristic of the flaviviral NS3 proteases, Zika NS2B-NS3pro appears to have the higher request of a basic residue at P3 site than the Dengue complexes (17) . However, as our current focus was not on profiling substrate specificity, in the present study, we did not test on more substrates but measured kinetic constants of linked and unlinked Zika complexes on Bz-nKRR-AMC. As shown in Table 1 , linked and unlinked Zika complexes only have slightly different kinetic constants. On the other hand, the linked Zika complex showed much larger differences from those of Dengue complexes (17) . For example, linked Zika complex has a Km of 43.38 µM, which is ~7 folds of the Dengue 1 (6.2 µM); ~3.6 folds of the Dengue 2 and Dengue 3 (12 µM); and ~6 folds of the Dengue 4 (7.3 µM) on the same substrate. This implies that the Zika complex has the lower affinity to this substrate than all four Dengue ones. However, the linked Zika NS2B-NS3pro has a kcat (48.89 S -1 ) much larger than those of all four Dengue (0.32, 1.4, 0.61 and 2.8 S -1 respectively). Consequently, the catalytic efficiency as reflected by kcat/Km (1,128,681 M -1 S -1 ) is ~3 folds of that of Dengue 4 (380,000 M -1 S -1 ), the largest among the four Dengue complexes (17) . author/funder.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/078113 doi: bioRxiv preprint 9 Interestingly, the kinetic constants were just published for a smaller Zika NS2B-NS3pro which was also linked by the same (Gly)4-Ser-(Gly)4 but had almost all disordered regions removed (25) . It has a Km of 18.3 µM and kcat of 44.6 S -1 respectively. While the kcat values are very similar, the Km value is ~2.4-fold less than our current one. This small difference is likely due to: 1) the difference of substrate as Bz-nKKR-AMC was used in the study (25) ; or/and 2) the presence of more unstructured regions in our construct, 3) or/and the difference of the buffers: our buffer is 50 mM Tris pH 8.5 while the buffer in the publication (25) is only 10 mM Tris pH 8.5. It is well-established that high salt concentrations reduced the activity of the flaviviral proteases (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . Indeed, we measured the activity of our linked Zika protease in 10 mM Tris pH 8.5, and the catalytic activity is 1.36-time higher. Characterization of the enzymatic inhibition-Previously, a small molecule p-Nitrophenyl-pguanidino benzoate (Fig. 3D ) has been identified to specifically bind to the active site of West Nile NS2B-NS3pro by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, followed by NMR binding confirmation (19) . Later, this molecule has been extensively demonstrated to bind Dengue (Table 1 ). Most strikingly, as clearly evidenced from Lineweaver-Burk plots for both linked (Fig. 3E ) and unlinked (Fig. 3G ) Zika complexes, the small molecule acts as a non-competitive inhibitor for both forms. We have searched all literatures citing the original paper (19) , but only found IC50 value of this inhibitor on West Nile NS2B-NS3pro complex (34.2 µM) in the original paper (19) . Therefore, this inhibitor could inhibit the enzymatic activity of Zika NS2B-NS3pro much more potently than that of author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

While it remains unclear whether this molecule inhibits other flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro complexes in a competitive or non-competitive manner, our present results clearly reveal that it inhibits Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes in a non-competitive manner, fundamentally different from a just reported peptidomimetic boronic acid inhibitor which competitively inhibited Zika NS2B-NS3pro (25). Our results thus decoded for the first time that Zika NS2B-NS3pro in fact has a pocket, to which small molecules can bind to trigger allosteric inhibition of the enzymatic activity.
