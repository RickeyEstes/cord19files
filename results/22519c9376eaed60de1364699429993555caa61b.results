We have prepared several structural types of PMEA prodrugs which are outlined in Section 1 (see Fig. 2 ). The prodrugs of 1 were prepared in doublets of corresponding mono and diesters with the exception of compound 15. The presented pro-moieties are 10-hydroxydecyl unit (compounds 3 and 5), 9,10-dihydroxydecyl unit (compounds 4 and 6), 2-[(10-hydroxydecyl)oxy]ethyl unit (compounds 7 and 9), 2-[(9,10-dihydroxydecyl)oxy]ethyl unit (compounds 8 and 10), hexaethyleneglycol units (compounds [11] [12] [13] [14] or (5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen-4-yl)methyl unit (compound 15). The length of the hydroxylated alkyl chain in compounds 3-10 was limited by the accessibility of the precursors (9-decen-1-ol, 10-undecen-1-ol). Hexaethyleneglycol pro-moiety was coupled also to Cidofovir (2), and thus prodrugs 16 and 17 were prepared.
