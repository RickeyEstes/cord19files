To assess the specificity of the technique, immunopurification of 35 S-labelled virions was carried out as described in the protocol. Previously, the infected-cell supernatant was analysed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography, containing virus and cellular proteins (Fig. 2B) . Three different antibodies were used in immunopurifications, MAb 25.22 specific for the M protein, MAb 3D.Cl0, specific for the N protein and an MAb specific for the GUS protein. A well without antibodies was left as a negative control. Immunopurified virions were analysed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. TGEV structural proteins S, N and M were detected when the M protein-specific MAb 25.22 was used (Fig. 2B) . In contrast, virus proteins were not detected using the N protein-specific MAb 3D.C10, confirming the integrity of TGEV virions, since the N protein is exclusively present inside the virus particle ( Figs. 1 and 2B) . As expected, no virion proteins were detected when the GUS-specific Ab was used, or in the absence of antibodies (Fig. 2B) . To confirm the specificity of the assay, genome RNA levels were quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Genome RNA was detected at high levels when the M-specific MAb was used (around 7 × 10 9 genome molecules per ELISA well), as expected, compared to those using the N-specific MAb or GUS antibody (about a 1000-fold less). To evaluate the purity degree of TGEV virus preparations, relative apparent encapsidation efficiencies were estimated for usual contaminating RNAs, virus mRNA-N and cellular ␤-actin mRNA. First, the source of TGEV virions used for immunopurifications (partially purified preparations or sucrose gradient purifications) was evaluated. In this example, the apparent mRNA-N encapsidation efficiencies were high, ranging from 20 to 30% compared to TGEV genome encapsidation in all cases (Table 1 ). The levels of cellular ␤-actin mRNA varied from 1 to 8%, indicating that even after sucrose density gradients, all the preparations were contaminated with cellular and viral mRNAs (Table 1 ). In contrast, after immunopurification very low levels of mRNA-N were detected and ␤-actin mRNA was not detected at all (Table 2) . TGEV virion preparations virtually free of mRNA-N and ␤-actin mRNA were obtained when sucrose-gradient-purified virions were used in immunopurifications (Table 2) . When partially purified virions recovered at 14 hpi were used for immunopurification, very low levels of contaminating virus mRNA-N (0.8%) were detected (Table 2 ). These results show that a combination of sucrose gradients and immunopurification provides a high degree of purity. Virus preparations with the highest purification degree are obtained using previously purified virions, or partially purified virions harvested early in infection.
