After excluding incomplete surveys, the final sample was 256. Demographic characteristics of the sample are presented in Table 1 ; women constituted a majority of participants (53.1%; n = 136). Few students (7.8%) had ever attended infection control courses outside the nursing curriculum. Table 2 shows that a majority of participants (57%) scored their pretest knowledge as inadequate, with about one-quarter (27.7%) rating their knowledge as moderate, and only one-sixth (15.2%) rating their knowledge as high. At posttest, almost one-half of subjects (45.7%) rated their knowledge as high, with nearly one-third (32%) rating their knowledge as moderate, and less than one-quarter (22.3%) rating their knowledge as inadequate. Table 2 shows that a majority reported poor pretest compliance (ie, low [39.5%] and very low [27%]). Just one-third had better pretest compliance scores; that is, average (14.1%) and high (19.5%) ratings. The posttest reports of compliance improved considerably, with high reaching 36.7%, average reaching 46.8%, low reaching 14.5%, and only 2% reporting very low compliance. Significant improvement in both knowledge and compliance scores was seen when comparing pretest versus posttest means (Table 3) . Table 4 A paired-samples t test indicated that the knowledge scores were significantly higher at posttest than at pretest. These results suggest a statistically significant improvement in the undergraduate nurses' knowledge following the educational intervention. The paired-samples t test indicated that posttest compliance scores were also significantly higher than pretest measures.
