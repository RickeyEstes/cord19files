Smooth induction of anaesthesia was achieved within 5 minutes. Sufentanil and midazolam doses were 0.5 lg kg À1 and 0.1 mg kg À1 , during induction and 3.9 lg kg À1 hour À1 and 0.8 mg kg À1 hour À1 during surgery, respectively. End-tidal sevoflurane concentration was 2.1% during surgery. Assisted ventilation was required in nine rabbits receiving sufentanil-midazolam and four receiving sevoflurane. There were no differences between groups in physiologic data other than arterial carbon dioxide. In rabbits receiving sevoflurane, mean arterial pressure decreased presurgical intervention, heart rate increased 25% during and after surgery and body weight decreased 4% post-operatively. Post-operative problems sometimes resulted from catheterization of the ear artery. Conclusion Sevoflurane and sufentanil-midazolam provided surgical anaesthesia of similar quality. Arterial blood pressure was sustained during sufentanil-midazolam anaesthesia and rabbits receiving sevoflurane lost body weight following ovariohysterectomy. Mechanical ventilation was required with both anaesthetic regimens. Clinical relevance Anaesthesia with sufentanilmidazolam in medetomidine premedicated healthy rabbits is useful in the clinical and the research setting, as an alternative to sevoflurane. There were no differences between groups in body weight before surgery (SUF-MID: 2.1 AE 0.1 kg, SEVO: 2.2 AE 0.1 kg) and none of the rabbits showed any clinical signs of disease. SED values of f R (88 AE 32 minutes À1 ), HR (159 AE 31 minutes À1 ) SpO 2 (94 AE 5%), PaO 2 , PaCO 2 and blood glucose (Table 1) were not different between groups. Induction was smooth and there were no differences in induction time (SUF-MID: 5 AE 1 minutes, SEVO: 5 AE 2 minutes), intubation time (SUF-MID: 6 AE 7 minutes, SEVO: 8 AE 6 minutes) or induction dose (0.5 AE 0.2 lg kg À1 sufentanil and 0.1 AE 0.05 mg kg À1 midazolam). The duration of surgery and the total duration of anaesthesia did not differ (SUF-MID: 63 AE 16 and 103 AE 15 minutes, SEVO: 55 AE 11 minutes and 112 AE 13 minutes, respectively). In group SUF-MID, the mean infusion dose was 1.6 lg kg À1 hour À1 sufentanil and 0.3 mg kg À1 hour À1 midazolam during PREP and 3.9 lg kg À1 hour À1 and 0.8 mg kg À1 hour À1 , respectively, during SUR. All rabbits in group SUF-MID required mechanical ventilation. The mean end-tidal SEVO concentration was 0.8 AE 0.2% during PREP and 2.1 AE 0.4% during surgery, with a range from 1.6% to 2.6% during SUR. Four SEVO rabbits required mechanical ventilation for 20-50 minutes, one during PREP only and three during SUR. There were no differences between groups in HR or MAP. In group SUF-MID, HR was higher POST Table 1 Heart rate (HR), arterial blood pressure (MAP), arterial blood gases, blood glucose and lactate levels (mean AE SD) in Himalayan rabbits undergoing ovariohysterectomy during sufentanil-midazolam (SUF-MID) or sevoflurane (SEVO) anaesthesia compared with SED values, whereas in group SEVO, HR was higher both during SUR and POST, compared with SED values (Table 1 ). In group SUF-MID, MAP did not change between sedation, preparation and surgery whereas in group SEVO, MAP was lower during preparation, compared with SED values (p = 0.05, power = 0.9, Table 1 , Fig. 1) . It was only possible to get a consistent reading from the pulse oximeter in five animals in group SUF-MID and three animals in group SEVO. In these animals, SpO 2 ranged between 86 and 100%. Arterial blood samples were obtained from all but one animal in group SUF-MID and mean PaO 2 did not differ between groups. It was higher during PREP and SUR compared to SED in group SEVO (Table 1) . PaCO 2 was higher in group SUF-MID than in group SEVO during PREP, and higher in group SEVO during PREP and SUR compared with SED (Table 1) . Glucose levels did not differ between groups but were lower POST compared to SED in group SEVO. Lactate levels were lower in group SEVO than SUF-MID during SUR and POST (Table 1) . Rectal temperature was lower in group SUF-MID during SUR and POST compared to SED (37.3 AE 0.8°C and 37.5 AE 0.7°C versus 38.4 AE 0.6°C). In group SEVO, RT was lower only during POST compared to SED (37.6 AE 0.6 versus 38.5 AE 0.6°C). There were no differences in RT between groups. Time to extubation did not differ between groups, being 20 (5-30) minutes for group SUF-MID and 6.5 (0-15) minutes for group SEVO [median (range)] in rabbits that did not receive a reversal agent. Time to recovery of the righting reflex was longer in group SUF-MID (62 AE 32 minutes) than in group SEVO (27 AE 22 minutes). Four rabbits in group SUF-MID received 0.06 mg kg À1 naloxone (Naloxon B Braun, B. Braun Medical AB, Sweden) IV; three rabbits due to respiratory depression at 9, 35 and 45 minutes after surgery respectively, and one rabbit that had not regained the righting reflex 60 minutes after surgery. One rabbit in group SEVO received 0.25 mg kg À1 atipamezole (Antisedan vet, 5 mg mL 1 , Orion Pharma Animal Health, Sweden) intramuscularly due to marked sedation 90 minutes after end of surgery. Body weight was stable in group SUF-MID whereas it decreased 4% during post-operative day 1-4 in group SEVO (p = 0.05, power = 1.0, Fig. 2) . However, there were no differences of body weight between the groups.
