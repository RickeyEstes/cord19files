To determine the amino acid pairs which have a greater chance of random collision with the anti-SARS drugs, we count the frequency of each amino acid pair in these pro- teins. Fig. 1 shows the number of amino acid pairs versus their frequency. For example, the bottom panel indicates that 105 amino acid pairs appear once, 46 pairs twice, 27 pairs three times, 14 pairs four times, seven pairs five times, two pairs six times and one pair eight times in the nucleocapsid protein. Clearly, the frequency of amino acid pairs is higher in the replicase protein than in the other four proteins. Although frequently appearing amino acid pairs have a greater chance of interaction with anti-SARS drugs, they are possibly not located at functional sites or well exposed to anti-SARS drugs. The differences between actual and predicted frequencies were calculated in order to determine the amino acid pairs with high probability at functional sites (Fig. 2) . Comparing the amino acid pairs in Figs. 1 and 2 , it can be found that the some of frequently appearing amino acid pairs are not the ones with large differences between actual and predicted frequencies. For example, the amino acid pair "LL" appears 65 times in the replicase protein, while there is only one difference between actual and predicted frequencies. This means that "LL" is unlikely to be located at the functional sites although its frequency is the highest in the protein. Although the amino acid pairs with a big difference between actual and predicted frequencies are more likely to be located at functional sites, they may be subject to the mutations. Our previous studies show that the amino acid pairs with a big difference between actual and predicted frequencies are more sensitive to new mutations, especially for the amino acid pairs whose actual frequency is larger than their predicted frequency [31] [32] [33] [34] . In this case the anti-SARS drugs would be ineffective if their targets undergo mutations. But the anti-SARS drugs will still have effects if the targets are the amino acid pairs formed through mutations. So, the amino acid pairs with smaller actual frequency than their predicted frequency is preferred, as they are more likely to be formed through mutations [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . In addition, this does not require knowledge of the possible outcome of a mutation. To find the amino acid pairs less sensitive to mutations, we calculate the first-order Markov transition probability (Fig. 3) . For instance, the amino acid pairs "AN" and "PL" have the same values of both actual frequency (AF = 31) and predicted frequency (PF = 26) in the replicase protein, but a difference can be found in their Markov transition probability, which is 0.061 for "AN" and 0.113 for "PL". Therefore, the amino acid pair "PL" rather than "AN" is preferable as the potential target for drugs, because the "PL" is more stable than the "AN". Taking the above three factors into account, we can theoretically define the possible targets for the development of anti-SARS drugs. Table 1 lists the amino acid pairs which can serve as the potential targets for anti-SARS drugs in case about 10% of amino acid pairs are chosen in each protein.
