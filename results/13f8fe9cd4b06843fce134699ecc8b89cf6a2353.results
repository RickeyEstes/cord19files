Sensitivity of R 0 to the variation in the serial interval is shown in Fig. 4 . We varied the CV of the serial interval distribution from 25% to 75%. When the CV was 25%, the median and mode of R 0 from LHS were 9.4 and 8.2, respectively. When the CV was 75%, the median and mode of R 0 were estimated to be 5.7 and 5.2, respectively. That is, as the variance increases, the estimate of R 0 decreases. However, the variation in R 0 induced by the CV was smaller than the uncertainty associated with the initially immune fraction.
