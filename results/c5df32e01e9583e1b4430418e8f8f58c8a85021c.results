Plasmid construction and identification. In this study, four plasmids were constructed by recombining the specific sequences of CYP2C19*2 G681G, CYP2C19*2 A681A, CYP2C19*3 G636G and CYP2C19*3 A636A. Using the primer pairs *2-seq-F/*2-seq-R and *3-seq-F/*3-seq-R, listed in Table 1 , 226-bp CYP2C19*2 and 450bp CYP2C19*3 fragments were amplified and sequenced by Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI; Beijing, China), indicating the successful incorporation of the four plasmids (data not shown).
