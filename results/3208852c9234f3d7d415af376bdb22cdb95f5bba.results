A total of 213 emergency departments were initially included in this study; 152 (71.4%) were private hospitals and 61 (28.6%) were public hospitals. One hundred emergency departments responded to the questionnaire (respondent rate = 46.9%). Among these, 15 emergency departments were medical centers (respondent rate = 65.2%, including 6 public and 9 private emergency departments), 28 emergency departments were regional hospitals (respondent rate = 38.9%, including 10 public and 18 private), and 57 emergency departments (respondent rate = 44.9%, including 14 public and 43 private) were local hospitals. The overall response rate was 46.0% in public hospitals and 49.1% in private hospitals. The emergency department volumes and assessment of the effects of the SARS outbreak on emergency department workers are shown in Table 1 . From March to May 2003, the average monthly volume of emergency department patients in level A hospitals was 6,200 (range 3,429-11,080) and 3,828 (range 1,864-5,770) in level B hospitals, both of which were significantly larger than the average number of patients in level C hospitals (average 2,246, range 729-3,236) (p = 0.001). No significant differences in emergency department volume were found between public (average 2,642, range 1,364-6,258) and private hospitals (average 3,398, range 729-11,080). The most frequent effect of the SARS outbreak on emergency department workers was "fever and needed to stay at home." Emergency department workers in level A and B hospitals had a higher probability of being affected during the SARS outbreak, regardless of job type. When the effects of the SARS outbreak on public and private hospitals were compared, significant differences were found between the type of quarantine at hospitals. PPE supplied by emergency departments is shown in Table 2 . The use of basic PPE did not differ significantly among emergency departments at different hospital levels. However, level A emergency departments used high grade PPE (P100/N100/FFP3 or powered air-purifying respirator) more often than emergency departments at level B and C hospitals. The implemented ICMs in different hospitals are shown in Table 3 . Most of the hospitals were able to follow the guidelines of the DOH. However, in terms of additional ICMs, emergency departments of level C hospitals used more restrictive measures when transferring patients in and out. The use of ICMs in public and private hospital was significantly different in patients who were transferred out. The timing of PPE usage or implementation of ICMs is shown in Table 4 . Eighty percent (80/100) of hospitals completely implemented use of PPE, and 66% (66/100) of hospitals implemented their ICMs at the late stage of the SARS outbreak. The instruction to use PPE originated from emergency department managers in 60% of level A, 46% of level B, and 23% of level C hospitals. The order to implement ICMs came from hospital managers in 33% of level A, 50% of level B, and 62% of level C hospitals. Table 5 shows the rating scales and correlations of difficulty and effectiveness of ICMs in emergency departments. Of the basic ICMs, instituting isolation at emergency departments was thought to be the most difficult (median = 3 score). Additional ICMs were more difficult to implement than basic ICMs. The effectiveness of additional ICMs was also thought to be less than that of basic ICMs. Closing emergency departments was thought to be less effective. Overall, the effectiveness of ICMs decreased as difficulty of implementation increased. Significant negative correlations were seen between perceived difficulty and effectiveness of implemented ICMs, except for body temperature at admission, institution of a fever screening station, and closure of the emergency department.
