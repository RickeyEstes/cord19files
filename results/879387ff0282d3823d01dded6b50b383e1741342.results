The final working database consisted of 1,806 bats sampled and checked for AdVs, belonging to 10 genera (Barbastella, Eptesicus, Hypsugo, Miniopterus, Myotis, Nyctalus, Pipistrellus, Plecotus, Rhinolophus, Vespertilio) and representing 33 of the 45 European bat species. The database of bats sampled in the Iberian region included a total of 1,466 bats belonging to 27 Iberian species surveyed for the study (Fig 2) . The inclusion in the analyses of the published results from Vidovszky et al. [26] and Sonntag et al. [25] for Germany and Hungary, allowed the addition of six European species (Eptesicus nilssonii, Myotis brandtii, M. dasycneme, M. nattereri, Pipistrellus nathusii and Vespertilio murinus), not found in Iberia and therefore not included in the Iberian database. Table 1 ). The species targeted for the individual-level analyses based on the highest prevalence of AdVs and large enough sample size were: Nyctalus lasiopterus (10.26% prevalence), Pipistrellus pygmaeus (10.07% prevalence) and Pipistrellus kuhlii (9.57% prevalence).
