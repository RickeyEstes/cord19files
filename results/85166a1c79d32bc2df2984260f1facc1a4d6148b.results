In the current research, 46 broiler flocks were selected for tracheal tissue sample collection. The results of real-time RT-PCR of this study showed that 34 (74.00 %) out of 46 infected flocks were positive to IBV (Fig. 1) . 35.00% of positive samples were from Basra, 35.00% of them were from Thi-Qar and 30.00% from Muthana governorates. Amplification of an expected DNA band of 295 bp, and 154bp from positive control, as well as, positive samples indicated that the nested PCR reaction has been performed correctly (Fig. 2) . The results of nested PCR revealed that (50.00%), (5.89%), and (44.11%) of these flocks have 793/B, Mass, and unknown strains, subsequently (as shown in Fig. 1 ). 793/B had the equal prevalence rate in each governorate, but Mass serotype was just detected in Basra governorate. The present study indicated a relatively high prevalence of 793/B IBV genotype in the south of Iraq. D274 genotype was not detected.
