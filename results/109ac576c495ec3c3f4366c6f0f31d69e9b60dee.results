Data analysis and interpretation. The information generated by the A&R System was analyzed and interpreted by the A&R coordinator to inform the public health interventions of the PAHO, MSPP, and partners. It was also used to update donors and other agencies on the evolution of the epidemic. The A&R System produced key qualitative information that was critical to qualify the epidemic and define vulnerable areas. From November 8, 2010 to November 6, 2011, 863 alerts on public health events were received by the PAHO/MSPP A&R System, with an average of 17 alerts per week, ranging from 2 (Epidemiological Week [EW] 31 of 2011) to 55 (EW 23 of 2011) alerts. There were no weeks without alerts (Figure 2 ). Alerts referred to unique events defined by a specific occurrence (as described above) in a set location and date; follow-up information of a specific event was not counted as a new alert. Alerts with information concerning a location previously reported in another alert but pertaining to a different timeframe were counted as new. (mainly NGOs) from the field, which may have affected the capacity of the system to detect and report alerts. Included in the alerts were three alerts that originated outside of Haiti (Canada, the Dominican Republic, and the United States) because of detection by partners while in the field but reported through the agency's offices outside of the country. One other alert affected several departments in Haiti. The departments reporting the highest numbers of alerts for the first year of functioning of the A&R System were Grande Anse (17.2%), Ouest (13.6%; metropolitan area excluded), and the metropolitan area (12.8%; Port-au-Prince) followed by Artibonite (10.6%) (Figure 3) . With the exception of Grande Anse, these departments also reported the highest number of cases (Figure 4 ). Because routine surveillance data for cholera was incomplete for Grande Anse, epidemic monitoring in this department was mainly done through the A&R System. This department is characterized by its lack of communications, difficult access, and paucity of partners. The majority of the alerts (89.6%) were related to cholera. Nevertheless, the system also detected 76 non-cholera alerts, including threats such as rabies (canine and human), acute flaccid paralysis, diphtheria, varicella, suspected cases of measles, anthrax, intoxications, and other hazards, like riots, strikes, and others. Cholera alerts described increases in cases, deaths, lack of supplies (medical and/or WASH), lack of human resources, and/or prevention activities. Alerts also reflected the phasing out of CTCs and CTUs and signaled calls for heightened attention from health authorities and partners at healthcare facilities and in communities. Over 95% of the alerts received had a documented response, and the remainder had no documented response, because either the information was not confirmed/verified or response was not needed or could not be effected. Verification of and response to the alerts in the field was conducted by the PAHO/WHO field teams in collaboration with several partners, mainly NGOs and the BMC as well as the MSPP. Actions that were taken in response to alerts included (1) field investigation of outbreaks and alerts; (2) rapid set-up of a CTC/CTU or ORP; (3) WASH response: chlorination of water, distribution of Aquatabs, access to latrines, waste management, dead body management, and household decontamination; (4) provision of supplies (medical and non-medical) and equipment; (5) provision of human resources for health facilities and community mobilization activities; (6) training on case management, cholera prevention, and control; and (7) training for community workers (brigadiers and health agents). The sensitivity of the system and its ability to react quickly was illustrated in early May of 2011. Starting between EW 17 and 18 of 2011 (first week of May), the A&R System detected an abnormal increase in the number of alerts coming from several communes in the Sud-Est Department ( Figure 5 ). This information was immediately disseminated networkwide (Health Cluster Bulletins #24 [May 3, 2011] and #25 [ May 27, 2011] posted at the cluster's web site: http://www .paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article& id=4404&Itemid=3487). A rapid risk assessment was done by the A&R national team, and as a result, the MSPP and partners were alerted of the high risk of further spread into the Ouest Department and specifically, to the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince, both of which had previously been defined as very vulnerable to cholera spread. This alert proved of vital importance given the fact that several partners were, at that time, scaling down cholera activities. Two weeks later, by May 21, a significant increase in cholera alerts was reported in the metropolitan area (EW 21 of 2011) (Figures 6 and 7) . Immediately, outbreak control measures were ready for implementation, and in that same week (EW 21), PAHO/ WHO was installing ORPs in Port-au-Prince, supporting medical response in CTCs and CTUs, supporting partners with material and supplies, and guiding WASH interventions in the metropolitan area and Ouest Department along with departmental authorities. As of May 31, through PAHO coordination as the health cluster leader, 1,779 beds in CTCs and CTUs had been set up, bringing the total number of bed capacity to approximately 2,388 in the metropolitan area and Ouest Department as reflected in PAHO/WHO's Situation Reports from May 27 to June 3, 2011 (http://www.paho.org/ hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4404& Itemid=3487). The national cholera surveillance system did not register an increase in cases until EWs 21-22 of 2011, and this information, aggregated by department, was not available until EWs 23-24, when the peak of cases had already been reached. Had the A&R System not existed, this new outbreak would not have been controlled as swiftly. Information on filtered alerts for each day was compiled on a daily alerts bulletin and disseminated by e-mail to the main actors involved in response at both the national and departmental levels. The guiding principle for sharing information was to help responders achieve the best use of their resources. Exit strategy. Since its implementation, the A&R System aimed at ensuring that the national surveillance system was strengthened through establishing the basis for an event-based component within the Haitian national surveillance system in the context of the IHR (2005) requirements. One of the main activities of the PAHO/WHO A&R national coordinators was to build local capacity for early detection, investigation, and rapid response. This building was done through both formal organized training and constant on-the-job training, with joint investigation of alerts as they came up. To facilitate the institutionalization of the A&R System, the IHR (2005) was used as an overarching framework for advocacy of such a system and to promote strengthening of core surveillance and response capacities. Initially, the MSPP had been concerned that the A&R System would duplicate the existing surveillance; however, the MSPP officials showed an increasing acceptance and support for the A&R System as time progressed. The acceptance and support came from witnessing how the information coming from the A&R System was near real time and allowed for close monitoring of the epidemic, consequently enabling the ability to define needs and set up a rapid response. Despite the support, the involvement of national officials in running the A&R System remained a challenge because of a lack of resources and the limited technical capacity available. To date, the system is still operating, with the MSPP staff supported by the epidemiologists of the PAHO/WHO Country Office. To ensure that reports on alerts reach both the MSPP epidemiologists on the field and departmental coordinators as well as the managers of the MSPP's CTCs and CTUs, the MSPP distributed cell phones to them and developed a system with PAHO for transmitting data through text messages. Training visits on entering data were conducted by PAHO in each department, and an MSPP statistician has been trained to analyze data from all departments.
