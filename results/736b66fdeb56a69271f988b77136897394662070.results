When these RNAs were denatured by heating with 10% formaldehyde for 20 min at 67째C [ 131, no difference in their migration on 2.2% polyacrylamide gels was observed. This shows that the coronavirus genomes are not composed of multiple subunits and contain little, if any, double strandedness. Some reports suggest that heating or denaturation can produce an alteration in the size or migration of the RNAs [5, 6, 8] . This may be due to contamination of the RNAs by an activated retrovirus or the presence of an internal ribonuclease [4] or the nicking of the large RNAs during isolation. The presence of poly(A) tracts in the coronavirus genomes was investigated by binding purified RNA species to oligo(dT)-cellulose columns [7] . As shown in table 1,30% of MI-IV 3 genome RNA, 29% of HCV 229E RNA and 27% of IBV Beau RNA bound to the columns. Under the same conditions of chromatography, poly(A) bound 100% and essentially no poly(U) or rRNA bound to the columns. These results indicate that -25-30% of coronavirus genomic RNAs contain covalently attached poly(A) sequences that are able to bind to oligo(dT)-cellulose columns. Substantially more of the genomic RNA may be polyadenylated, but may not be able to bind to oligo(dT)-cellulose columns. This may be because the genomic RNAs are very large and some of them take up conformations during chromatography that prevent them from binding to the oligo(dT)-cellulose, or because the poly(A) content of the molecules is very heterogeneous and many of the molecules have poly(A) tracts that are too short to readily bind to the columns. There was no evidence suggesting that the RNA species were degraded during chromatography as single peaks of activity were obtained on polyacrylamide gels of chromatographed RNAs. Labelled coronavirus RNA species that had bound to oligo(dT)cellulose columns were digested with a mixture of pancreatic ribonuclease A and Tr ribonuclease in order to obtain the poly(A) portions of the genomes and to size them. a Digestion was at 37째C for 30 mm in a solution containing 200 mM NaCI, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 pg/ml pancreatic ribonuclease A and 30 units/ml T, ribonuclease b Only RNA species binding to oligo(dT)tellulose were used. The initial cpm before nuclease digestion were 2 20 000 in all cases c Each experiment was an average of 3 determinations radioactivity, showing that the nuclease treatment had eliminated all the RNA sequences except the poly(A) tracts. The coronavirus genomes have been shown to have mol. wt -5.8 X 1 O6 which corresponds to -18 000 nucleotides. Assuming that 0.4% of the coronavirus genome is poly(A), then the poly(A) tract is about 70 nucleotides in length. [ 3H]Adenosinelabelled poly(A) sequences were run on 5% polyacrylamide gels with tRNA as marker in order to obtain a direct estimate of their size [lo] . However, no clear profile was obtained as the amount of label in the poly(A) was too low for such an analysis. Controlled digestion with the enzyme polynucleotide phosphorylase was used to digest coronavirus genomic RNAs from the 3'-termini, in order to determine whether the poly(A) segment was located at the 3'-end of the genome. Table 3 shows that controlled digestion of the three species of coronavirus RNAs, HCV 229E, IBV Beau and MHV 3, with polynucleotide phosphorylase at 3 7째C for 10 min, produced a much more rapid loss of poly(A) than RNA. These results are interpreted to mean that the three coronavirus RNAs studied have poly(A) segments at or near the 3'-termini of the molecules. a Samples were incubated at 37째C for 10 min in a solution containing 500 pg/ml polynucleotide phosphorylase in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 5 mM MgCl,, 10 mM sodium phosphate. Incubation without enzyme or sodium phosphate produced no digestion b Only RNA species binding to oligo(dT)-cellulose were used. The initial cpm before digestion were > 10 000 in all cases ' Each experiment was an average of 2 determinations. The amount of RNA remaining after digestion was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation d Each experiment was an average of 2 determinations. The amount of poly(A) remaining after digestion was determined by the ability of the RNA species to bind to oligo(dT)-cellulose columns
