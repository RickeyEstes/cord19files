Strain-specific differences in cell death induction correlate with caspase activation. Previous studies have suggested that blockade of the prosurvival function of NF-B by T3A but not T1L late following infection controls the differences in the capacity of these two strains to elicit apoptosis (34) . While following up on these studies, we investigated the extent to which T1L and T3D differ in their capacity to block activation of NF-B at late times following infection of L929 cells. We found that each strain inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-␣)-induced NF-B nuclear translocation to an equivalent extent (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). To determine if T3D and T1L continue to maintain a difference in their capacity to evoke cell death, we performed acridine orange, ethidium bromide (AOEB) staining on infected cells at 48 h after infection. Rather than subjective determination of the staining pattern of the nuclear material to distinguish between apoptotic and necrotic cells (35) , all cells that stained with EB were counted as dead cells. Evaluation by this method indicated that T3D induced significantly greater cell death than T1L (Fig. 1A) , consistent with previous results (30, 31) . Both T1L and T3D were capable of establishing efficient infection in these cells (Fig. S1B) . Thus, despite efficiently establishing infection and blocking NF-B activation late in infection to an equal extent, T3D induced cell death to a much greater extent in L929 cells than did T1L. These data suggest that unlike that reported for HEK293 cells (34) , differences in the capacity of T3D and T1L to evoke cell death in L929 cells are not related to inhibition of NF-B late in infection. To define how prodeath signaling following T3D and T1L differs, we compared the activations of initiator and executioner caspases following infection of L929 cells by these two strains. Measurement of the activity of the effector caspases, caspase-3 and -7, by chemiluminescent enzymatic assays 24 h after infection indicated that T3D activates these enzymes to a significantly greater extent than T1L (Fig. 1B) . Consistent with these results, we found that a greater amount of cleaved caspase-3 was detectable following infection with T3D (see Fig. S1C in the supplemental material). Bid cleavage, a marker for caspase-8 activation following reovirus infection (14) , also occurred more efficiently in T3Dinfected cells than T1L-infected cells (Fig. S1D) . Collectively, these data demonstrate that initiator and effector caspase activity fol- After incubation at 37°C for 24 h, caspase-3/7 activity in cell lysates was determined. Results are expressed as the mean ratios of caspase-3/7 activity from infected cell lysates to that from mock-infected cells for triplicate samples. Error bars indicate SD. *, P value of Ͻ0.05 as determined by Student's t test in comparison to cells infected with T3D. lowing infection of L929 cells with T3D is significantly higher than that following infection with T1L. Activation of NF-B is not required for reovirus-induced cell death. Previously, we have suggested that activation of NF-B early, 6 to 8 h after reovirus infection, is required for caspase-8mediated generation of tBid and attendant activation of effector caspases (14) . To determine if NF-B activation following infection of L929 cells with T1L and T3D differs, we measured the activation of NF-B by measuring the loss of IB␣ inhibitor from the cytoplasm and the consequent translocation of the NF-B RelA/p65 subunit to the nucleus (21, 36) . Immunoblot analysis of IB␣ levels 7.5 h after infection indicates a greater decrease in IB␣ levels following infection with T3D than following infection with T1L ( Fig. 2A) . Consistent with these data, we found a significantly greater level of RelA in the nuclear extracts of T3D-infected cells than in those of T1L-infected cells (Fig. 2B) . To test the idea that the enhanced death-inducing potential of T3D in L929 cells may be related to an increased capacity to activate NF-B, we determined if blockade of NF-B activation would diminish cell death following T3D infection. For these experiments, we assessed the capacity of T3D to promote cell death in cells treated with an IB␣ kinase (IKK) inhibitor, BAY- 65-1942 (21, 37) . We found that blockade of IKK activation had no effect on the induction of cell death by T3D (Fig. 2C ). Treatment of cells with TNF-␣ in the presence of the IKK inhibitor resulted in cell death, demonstrating that the IKK inhibitor is functional in L929 cells and can block TNF-␣-induced prosurvival NF-B signaling. To ensure that the IKK inhibitor also blocked the unusual IKK complex activated by reovirus (21) , we assessed the effect of IKK inhibition on effector caspase activation following reovirus infection. Consistent with the requirement of IKK activity in promoting proapoptotic signaling following reovirus infection (21) , we found that in comparison to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated cells, effector caspase activity following reovirus infection was significantly diminished following treatment of cells with the IKK inhibitor (Fig. 2D) . Thus, despite blocking proapoptotic signaling following reovirus infection, the IKK inhibitor failed to block reovirus-induced cell death. These studies reveal that T3D is capable of activating a cell death pathway that is not dependent on target gene transcription by NF-B. Though this observation matches that from primary cardiac myocytes, it is distinct from that reported for other cell types (20, 34, 38) . The unexpected dispensability of NF-B signaling for cell death in L929 cells prompted us to focus on defining the nature of this cell death pathway. Reovirus induces caspase-independent cell death. Our experiments using the IKK inhibitor suggested that reovirus may induce cell death even in the absence of active effector caspases. To directly test the idea that T3D can evoke cell death in a caspaseindependent manner, we assessed cell death 48 h after reovirus infection in the presence of inhibitors of caspase-8 (Z-IETD-FMK) or caspase-9 (Z-LEHD-FMK) or a broad-spectrum inhibitor of caspases [Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK]. Surprisingly, we found that T3D remained capable of inducing cell death in the presence of each of these inhibitors (Fig. 3A ). To ensure that the inhibitors were functional in L929 cells at the concentration used, we assessed their capacity to prevent effector caspase activation in T3Dinfected cells. For these experiments, caspase-3/7 activity in infected cells treated with each inhibitor was quantified 24 h after infection. We found that in comparison to mock-infected cells, there was an~10-fold increase in caspase-3/7 activity by infection with T3D in the presence of DMSO (Fig. 3B ). Inclusion of inhibitors of caspase-8 or caspase-9 or inclusion of a pan-caspase inhibitor completely blocked effector caspase activation. Thus, despite being capable of blocking the proapoptotic signaling pathway activated by reovirus, these inhibitors failed to prevent virally triggered cell death. These data indicate that reovirus T3D is capable of inducing a distinct cell death pathway in L929 cells that is independent of caspase activation. Reovirus induces RIP1-dependent necrosis. One such caspase-independent cell death pathway requires the kinase activity of RIP1 (39, 40) . To assess whether the caspase-independent cell death pathway activated by reovirus is dependent on the kinase activity of RIP1, we determined the capacity of reovirus to induce cell death following treatment of cells with necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), an inhibitor of RIP1 (41) . We found that reovirusinduced cell death was blocked by Nec-1 (Fig. 4A ). Simultaneous treatment of cells with Nec-1 and a pan-caspase inhibitor did not further diminish cell death, suggesting that a RIP1 kinasedependent form of cell death is the primary mechanism of cell death in these cells (Fig. 4A ). The effect of Nec-1 on reovirusinduced cell death was independent of its effect on the blockade of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an additional target of Nec-1 (42, 43) , since direct inhibition of IDO using 1-methyl-Ltryptophan did not prevent reovirus-induced cell death (see Fig. S2A in the supplemental material). The capacity of reovirus to establish infection and grow in Nec-1-treated cells was not affected ( Fig. S2B and C). Nec-1 also did not diminish caspase-3/7 activity in T3D-infected cells (Fig. S2D) . These data suggest that RIP1 kinase activity is required for reovirus-induced cell death. Cells undergoing all forms of necrosis, including necroptosis, are characterized by a depletion of cellular ATP levels (44, 45) . To determine whether ATP levels were affected in T3D-infected cells, we compared ATP levels over a time course of infection using a chemiluminescent assay. While an~35% to 40% reduction in ATP was observed at 24 h after infection with T3D,~75% and 95% of the ATP was lost in T3D-infected cells at 36 and 48 h after infection, respectively (Fig. 4B) . Moreover, the rate at which loss of ATP occurred in T3D-infected cells was diminished by treatment of cells with Nec-1 but not by treatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor. These data provide further support for the idea that T3D-infected L929 cells undergo necroptosis following reovirus infection. Necroptosis alters cellular architecture quite differently from apoptosis. In particular, necroptosis damages the integrity of the plasma membrane. To assess whether plasma membrane integrity was compromised following infection with T3D, we evaluated whether high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) was released into the medium of infected cells. This protein is not released from apoptotic cells undergoing secondary necrosis, and therefore, leakage of this chromatin-associated protein from cells is considered to be a marker for necrosis (46, 47) . We found that HMGB1 was released into the medium at 24 h following infection. A greater level of HMGB1 was detected in the medium at 36 and 48 h after infection with T3D (Fig. 4C) . Along with the capacity of EB to gain access and stain the nuclei of unfixed, reovirus-infected cells, a measurement equivalent to propidium iodide or sytox staining of necrotic cells (48) , the data presented here indicate that the L929 cell plasma membrane is leaky following infection with T3D. Based on the dispensability of caspases, the requirement for RIP1 kinase activity, the dramatic loss in cellular ATP levels, and the release of HMGB1 from infected cells, we conclude that reo-virus is capable of inducing an alternate cell death pathway, which has been described as necroptosis. To determine if infection with T1L also results in necroptosis, we assessed whether ATP is lost from T1L-infected cells. We found that~30% to 40% ATP was lost after T1L infection at 48 h (see Fig. S3A in the supplemental material). Thus, in comparison to T3D-infected cells (Fig. 4B) , ATP loss following infection with T1L is delayed. The loss of ATP in T1L-infected cells was able to be diminished by Nec-1 but not pan-caspase inhibitor treatment, suggesting that cell death following T1L infection also occurs via necroptosis. We also used AOEB staining to determine the kinetics and mechanisms of T1L-induced cell death. We found~10% and~30% cell death in cells infected with T1L at 48 and 72 h after infection, respectively (Fig. S3B ). Because cell death following T1L infection is sensitive to Nec-1 and is substantially lower than thẽ 60% cell death induced by T3D at 48 h after infection, our data indicate that T1L induces necroptosis in L929 cells with slower kinetics than T3D. Induction of necroptosis requires viral RNA or protein synthesis. To define the triggering event in viral infection that ultimately leads to necroptosis, we assessed the requirement for viral genomic RNA and viral replication for induction of necroptosis. To determine whether viral genomic RNA is required for induction of cell death, we infected cells with equivalent numbers of genome-deficient (or top-component) particles and infectious virions and assessed their capacity to elicit cell death. To rule out the effect of secondary rounds of infections from the contaminating infectious particles in the top-component particle fraction, we assessed the induction of cell death at 24 h after infection (19) . We found that~35% and~20% of the cells were dead following infection with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 17,700 particles/ cell (equivalent of 100 PFU/cell) or 5,840 particles/cell (equivalent of 33 PFU/cell), respectively, of infectious virus (Fig. 5A ). In contrast, infection of cells with an equivalent number of topcomponent particles killed a substantially smaller amount of cells, 10% and~5%, respectively. These data indicate that viral genomic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is required for induction of necroptosis. To determine if genomic dsRNA is sufficient to trigger necroptosis, we assessed the capacity of UV-inactivated virus to evoke cell death. UV-inactivated reovirus contains genomic dsRNA, but the RNA is not competent to serve as a template for viral mRNA synthesis. We observed that UV-treated reovirus particles had a significantly lower capacity for inducing cell death than an equivalent dose of infectious virus (Fig. 5B) . These findings indicate that genomic dsRNA within incoming virus particles is insufficient to evoke necroptosis in infected cells and suggest that de novo synthesis of viral RNA is required for induction of necroptosis following reovirus infection. Since viral genomic RNA and virus replication are dispensable for induction of apoptosis (19, 49) , these findings suggest that apoptosis and necroptosis following reovirus infection are initiated at different stages of viral infection.
