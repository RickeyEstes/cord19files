Tandem-affinity purification reveals interaction of TARG1 with RNA-binding proteins. To gain insight into TARG1's cellular functions, we identified the TARG1-associated cellular proteome using a tandem affinity purification (TAP) approach 19 . HEK293 cells stably and inducibly expressing TAP-tagged TARG1 or the TAP-tag alone were generated and TAP-containing protein complexes isolated (Fig. 1a) 20 . The TAP-tag consists of Protein A fused to a Calmodulin (CaM) binding peptide (CBP) via a Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease cleavage site (Fig. 1a) , allowing for sequential affinity purification of TAP-tag-containing complexes. Protein A is captured by an IgG matrix, complexes are eluted by TEV cleavage and CBP-tagged complexes are recovered by a CaM pulldown (Fig. 1a) . Co-purified proteins were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and relative enrichment of detected proteins in the TAP-TARG1 pulldown over the TAP-tag control was calculated by label-free quantitation ( Fig. 1b and c) 21, 22 . Because mechanical DNA shearing during cell lysis activates ARTD1/2 resulting in PAR formation, to which TARG1 can be recruited 9,23 , we assessed the role of PAR on the TARG1 interactome. Therefore, the experiments were performed with or without the ARTD1/2 inhibitor olaparib during cell lysis (Fig. 1a) . Experiments without inhibitor were performed in three, experiments with inhibitor in two biological replicates. The individual samples were measured in technical duplicates. Without inhibitor we identified 70 TARG1 interacting proteins with a fold enrichment ≥2 (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table S1 , Supplementary Dataset S1). ARTD1, the only described interaction partner of TARG1 so far 9 , was highly enriched ( Fig. 1c ; Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Dataset S1). In addition, components of protein complexes involved in base excision repair (BER; XRCC1 and LIG3), in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ; PRKDC, XRCC5 and XRCC6) and the FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex subunits SSRP1 and SUPT16H were associated with TARG1. All of these factors doxycycline induction were lysed in the presence or absence of olaparib to inhibit ARTD1/2 activation during cell lysis. TAP-tag containing complexes were purified in two sequential affinity purification steps. Co-purified proteins were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and relative enrichment of TAP-TARG1 over TAP-tag control was determined by labelfree quantitation (LFQ). Upper right panel: Domain structure of TAP-TARG1 and TAP constructs. Lower right panel: Fractions of the input lysate, the IgG and the CaM pulldown were analyzed for TARG1 by Western blot using mAb 3A5 (for characterization of TARG1 antibodies see Supplementary Fig. S3 ). (b) Venn diagrams depicting the overlap between proteins associated with TARG1 in proteomics screens conducted in the absence (three biological replicates, p ≤ 0.01) or presence (two biological replicates, p ≤ 0.01) of olaparib in the lysis buffer with a fold enrichment of ≥2 (upper diagram) or ≥10 (lower diagram) over TAP control. (c) Fold enrichment of all proteins identified as TARG1 interacting proteins (p ≤ 0.01, ≥2-fold enrichment over TAP control) both in the absence and presence of olaparib. Only a fraction of grouped bars is specified with the corresponding protein names on the x-axis for clarity reasons. For details on the identified proteins see Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Datasets S1 and S2. (d) HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding for FLAG-TARG1 wildtype (WT) or ADPr binding-deficient FLAG-TARG1-G123E (GE). Presence of SSRP1, XRCC1 and CHD1L in FLAG immunoprecipitates (IP) and whole cell lysates (WCL) was analyzed by Western blotting. (e) HEK293 cells transiently expressing FLAG-TARG1 were lysed in TAP lysis buffer ±10 µM olaparib. Presence of ARTD1, XRCC1, CHD1L, KU80 and TARG1 after IP of FLAG-TARG1 was analyzed by Western blotting. (f) HEK293T cells transiently expressing FLAG-TARG1 were lysed in the presence of 10 µM olaparib. Presence of ARTD1, NCL, RPL7A and USP10 after IP against FLAG-TARG1 was analyzed by Western blotting. CHD1L was detected to control for inhibition of lysis-induced PARylation. (d-f) Fulllength blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. S8 . SCIenTIFIC REpORtS | (2018) 8:6748 | DOI: 10 .1038/s41598-018-25137-w have been consistently found as proteins that are PARylated in response to DNA damage or are recruited to sites of DNA damage via PAR binding domains 23, 24 . To assess whether these interactions depend on PARylation, we generated different ADPr binding-deficient TARG1 mutants. Based on in silico mutational analyses of the ADPr binding pocket in TARG1, we mutated three residues located in the ADPr binding pocket, G43, I44 and G123, to glutamate ( Supplementary Fig. S1a -c, Supplementary Table S2 ). Mutation of G123 was previously shown to block ADPr binding 9 . Impact of the mutations on folding and ADPr binding was assessed in fluorescence-based thermal shift assays 25 . His-TARG1-G43E and -I44E were less, His-TARG1-G123E more stable than the wildtype protein ( Supplementary Fig. S1d ). While His-TARG1 was stabilized by ADPr, the mutants were not, indicative of loss of ADPr binding ( Supplementary  Fig. S1d) . Moreover, all three mutants were catalytically inactive towards auto-modified ARTD10 ( Supplementary  Fig. S1e ). Consistent with these findings and unlike the wildtype protein, TARG1-G123E did not interact with repair proteins in co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments (Fig. 1d) . In the presence of olaparib a strong shift was observed in TARG1 co-purified proteins (Fig. 1b) . The +olaparib dataset contained 192 proteins with a ≥2-fold enrichment with an overlap of 32 proteins to the -olaparib dataset (Fig. 1b) . The lost proteins with olaparib included those being either substrates of or recruited by DNA damage-induced PARylation ( Fig. 1c and e) . Increasing the stringency to a threshold of ≥10 resulted in an overlap of only one protein, RFC2 (replication factor C subunit 2), in addition to TARG1 itself (Fig. 1b) . In the presence of olaparib, we identified almost all proteins of the small and large ribosomal subunits and proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, RNA processing and translation such as nucleolin (NCL), hnRNPs and DDX proteins (Fig. 1c , Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Dataset S2). Among the ARTD family members, association of TARG1 with ARTD1 and the catalytically inactive ARTD13 was observed. However, while ARTD1 was highly enriched in the absence of olaparib treatment (385-fold), it was only weakly interacting (2.6-fold) with TARG1 with ARTD1/2 inhibition (Fig. 1c , Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Dataset S2). Independent co-IP experiments using FLAG-tagged TARG1 from cell lysates in the presence of olaparib confirmed binding to ARTD1, NCL, RPL7A, and USP10 (Fig. 1f) . CHD1L was not co-IPed, indicating that lysis-induced PAR formation was very low or did not occur in these experiments (Fig. 1f) . We were not able to IP endogenous TARG1 under co-IP conditions with any of our monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies despite their reactivity with endogenous TARG1 on Western blots and in high stringency IP buffers (for control Western blots see below). A possible explanation is that the epitopes of this small protein are covered by interacting factors under low stringency conditions. In summary, we observed a shift of proteins co-purifying with TARG1, depending on the addition of the PARP inhibitor olaparib to the lysis buffer ( Fig. 1b and c) . Gene ontology (GO) analyses revealed distinct biological and molecular functions associated with these proteins (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table S3 ). Under -olaparib conditions, chromatin-related processes such as DNA repair, chromatin organization and DNA binding were overrepresented, while with inhibition of ARTD1/2 RNA-related processes such as translation, rRNA metabolic process and RNA binding prevailed (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table S3 ).
