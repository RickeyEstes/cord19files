Serial passaging of A2MC2 in MARC-145 cells. PRRSV strain A2MC2 was subjected to serial passaging in MARC-145 cells to minimize previously observed moderate virulence 16 . The A2MC2 virus was passaged in MARC-145 cells for 90 consecutive passages. For each passage, the cells were frozen and thawed three times when cytopathic effect (CPE) occurred over 50% of the cells. Virus samples were collected for each passage. IFN bioassay results showed that treatment of Vero cells with the supernatnat of A2MC2 passage 90 (A2MC2-P90) even at a dilution of 1 to 16 inhibited the replication of NDV-GFP (Fig. 1A ). This suggested that A2MC2-P90 retains the capacity of IFN induction of the wild type A2MC2. To confirm IFN induction by strain A2MC2-P90, we performed immunoblotting detection of RIG-I, which is upregulated by type I IFNs 31 . Result showed that the RIG-I level increased in the Vero cells treated with culture supernatant from A2MC2-P90-infected MARC-145 cells, whereas no change in RIG-I level was observed in cells treated with supernatant from VR-2385-infected cells (Fig. 1B) . Compared with treatment of mock-infected cells, the treatment with supernatant from A2MC2-P90 infected cells led to 97.8 and 141.5-fold higher RIG-I and MDA5 transcript levels, respectively, whereas treatment with supernatant from VR-2385-infected cells had only 0.9 and 0.7-fold of RIG-I and MDA5 transcript levels, respectively (Fig. 1C ). Growth property determination and plaque assay. A2MC2-P90 was tested in MARC-145 cells for growth properties, including a multi-step growth curve and a plaque assay as described previously 15 . The virus yields reached its peak at 72 hours post inoculation (hpi) and were 7.7, 7.9 and 8.0 Log 10 /ml in TCID 50 for the cells with inoculum at an MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 0.01, 0.1 and 1, respectively ( Fig. 2A) . The virus yields for the cells inoculated with A2MC2-P90 at an MOI of 0.1 and harvested at 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hpi were 6.7, 7.3, 7.8, 7.6 and 7.2 Log 10 /ml, respectively, which were significantly higher than the yields from the cells inoculated with wild type A2MC2 at an MOI of 0.1: 5.0, 5.7, 5.5, 4.6 and 4.1, respectively. Similar trends and titers of virus yields were observed for the samples harvested from the cells with the three different amounts of A2MC2-P90 inoculation. A plaque assay was done for A2MC2-P90 and compared with wild type A2MC2. The plaque sizes of A2MC2-P90 were 8-10 mm in diameter, much bigger than the wild type A2MC2 palques, which were generally 3-4 mm in diameter (Fig. 2B) . The larger size of plaques produced by A2MC2-P90 is consistent with its higher yield compared to the wild type virus. Sequencing of cDNA of A2MC2-P90 genomic RNA. The virions of A2MC2-P90 were used for RNA isolation and RT-PCR. DNA sequencing of the PCR products was done and compared with sequences of wild type A2MC2 virus. Variations of nucleotides and derived amino acids in comparison with wild type A2MC2, VR-2332 and Ingelvac PRRS ® MLV were identified (Supplemental Table 1 ). The locations of the differences in genomic RNA are illustrated in Fig. 3 ORF1a in comparison with wild type A2MC2 virus, leading to a deletion of 181 amino acid residues in hypervariable region of nsp2. Moreover, compared to the wild type, the A2MC2-P90 has 35 nucleotide mutations, among which 26 are non-synonymous, leading to 26 amino acid changes (Table 1) . Interestingly, among the 15 unique nucleotides in A2MC2 genome compared with Ingelvac PRRS ® MLV and VR-2332 15 , 14 remained the same in the A2MC2-P90 genome (Fig. 3) . As a result, 5 of the 6 unique amino acid residues of A2MC2 compared to the MLV and VR-2332 remained the same in A2MC2-P90. The conserved five nucleotides leading to unique amino acids in A2MC2 are nt7621, 9655, 12012, 12972 and 12975 and the five unique residues are Ser20 in nsp8/9, Leu13 in nsp10, Gly135 in nsp12, and Val93 and Val94 in GP3. This result indicates that the 14 nucleotides in A2MC2 are highly conserved and sustained during the 90 serial passages. It also suggests that these 14 nucleotides or their related RNA structures might correlate with the feature of A2MC2 in IFN induction. The deletion in ORF1a occurs in passage 60 of A2MC2. Having noticed the deletion in nsp2 of A2MC2-P90, we wondered at which passage the deletion occurred. RT-PCR was conducted to amplify a fragment spanning the deletion area. The expected sizes of the PCR product are 719 bp for A2MC2-P90 and 1262 bp for wild type A2MC2. The PCR products for passage 30, 40 and 50 are the same size as wild type A2MC2, while the sizes of passage 70 and 80 are the same as A2MC2-P90 (Fig. 4A ). There were two main bands in PCR products of passage 60. Therefore, the deletion likely occurred around passage 60. PCR amplification of passage 60 through 63 showed that the size shift from 1262 bp to 719 bp likely occurred from passage 60 to 61 (Fig. 4B)
