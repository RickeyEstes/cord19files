Of 214 participants, 11 were excluded because of missing information on demographic questions. Thus, 203 medical students with a mean age of 21 ± 1.4 (mean ± SD) years participated. Of 203 medical students, 79 (38.9%) were male and 124 (61.1%) were female, 51 (25.1%) students were nursing majors, 61 (30.1%) were clinical majors, 36 (17.7%) were management majors, and 55 (27.1%) were public health majors. Table 1 shows the rate of correct answers, varying from 36.0% to 89.7%. Table 2 shows the difference in knowledge of MERS among the different majors of medical students (p < 0.05), e.g., management majors scored significantly higher than students of other majors (p < 0.05) (data not shown).
