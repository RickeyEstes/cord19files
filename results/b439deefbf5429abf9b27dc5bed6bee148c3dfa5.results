Here, we present the results of patients who met all inclusion criteria and whose samples were analysed by both methods proposed in this study. One hundred sixty-two outpatients (79 male and 83 female) were included. The study consisted of both adult (n = 46) and paediatric (n = 116) individuals. The paediatric age group consisted of individuals zero-19 years of age, including children and adolescents, according to the World Health Organization criteria. The median age of the entire cohort was seven years (range 1 month to 75 years). Children under nine years of age accounted for 66.7% (108/162) of the samples analysed. All patients had recent (â‰¤ 5 days) symptoms. IIF detected 33 positive specimens (20.4%). The influenza virus was the most common etiologic agent detected (23/33). Inf A and Inf B corresponded to 8% (13/162) and 6.2% (10/162) of the samples, respectively. The IIF technique detected only single infections. Eighty-eight (54.3%) specimens were positive for one or more respiratory viruses by multiplex real-time RT-PCR (Table I ). The influenza virus (15.4%), HRV (8%) and RSV (7.4%) were the viruses most frequently detected and accounted for one-third of the positive samples. Regarding the patient age groups, the influenza viruses were more frequently identified in young adults (20-39 years of age). All viruses were identified in infants (0-2 years old), with the exception of PIV 2, PIV 4 and EV. RSV and HRV were the most prevalent. Most of the samples positive for RSV (91.6%) and HRV (77%) were identified in infants. No virus was identified in subjects above 40 years old (Figure) . The following bacteria were detected: Streptococcus pneumoniae [n = 43 (26.3%)], Staphylococcus aureus [n = 20 (12.3%)] and Haemophilus influenzae [n = 2 (1.2%)]; Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae were not detected (Table I) . Six specimens (3.7%) were positive for two viruses. All co-detections occurred in children under two years of age and RSV accounted for half of those cases (Table  II) . No co-detections involved three or more respiratory viruses. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 27 codetection cases, with at least one infectious agent from the viral or bacterial pathogen groups (Table II) .
