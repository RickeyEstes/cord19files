A total of 63 children (33 patients with viral-induced asthma attack and 30 patients with controlled asthma) were enrolled. The mean age was 10.7 ± 3.1 years and 22 (34.9%) of the patients were female. The mean age of the asthma attack group was significantly lower than the controlled asthma group (p < 0.05). No difference was found between the two asthma groups in terms of gender, inhaled corticosteroid usage, BMI and markers of allergy (total IgE and serum eosinophils). Among the 33 samples from patients with acute asthma, parainfluenza virus was detected in 10 (30.3%), rhinovirus in six (18.2%), RSV in six (18.2%), adenovirus in five (15.1%), influenza virus in four (12.1%), and coronavirus in two (6%). The median serum IP-10 level was 54.8 pg/ml in the acute asthma group and 44.4 pg/ml in the controlled asthma group. The difference between groups was significant (p = 0.006). The mean log camp levels were also significantly higher in the acute asthma group than the controlled asthma group (p = 0.002). The median serum vit D level was 13 g/L in acute asthma group and 24.5 g/L in the controlled asthma group. The difference between the two groups was highly significant (p < 0.001). No difference was found between the groups in terms of TLR2 levels. Serum IL-4 and IL-13 levels were lower in the acute asthma group than the controlled asthma (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in terms of other cytokines and the number of Foxp3+ T reg cells (Table 1) . Serum IP-10 levels showed a significant negative correlation with age (Spearman correlation coefficient rho: −0.33, p = 0.009) and TLR2 levels (Spearman correlation coefficient rho: −0.25, p = 0.05) and a positive correlation with serum cathelicidin levels (Spearman correlation coefficient rho: 0.38, p = 0.002) (Fig. 2a) . A negative correlation was found between IP-10 and vit D on the border of significance (p = 0.06). No significant correlation was found between IP-10 levels and gender, BMI, ICS usage, total IgE, absolute eosinophil counts, Foxp3+ T reg cells and cytokines among all asthma patients in the univariate analysis (Table 2) . A significant negative correlation was found between serum IP-10 levels and the spirometric indices (FEV1 rho: ( Table 2) . No correlation was found between IP-10 and the need for systemic steroid and hospitalization. Serum cathelicidin levels showed a significant positive correlation with IL-6 (Spearman correlation coefficient rho: 0.34, p = 0.006) and a negative correlation with TLR2 (Spearman correlation coefficient rho: −0.32, p = 0.01), IL-4 (Spearman correlation coefficient rho: −0.3, p = 0.02) and IL-13 (Spearman correlation coefficient rho: −0.34, p = 0.006) levels. No significant correlation was found between cathelicidin and Foxp3+ T reg cells and other cytokines. Multiple linear regression analysis of possible factors that could influence serum IP-10 levels in the acute asthma group revealed that higher cathelicidin values showed a significant positive relation to IP-10 (beta coefficient: 33, p = 0.02) ( Table 3 ). In the roc analysis, serum IP-10 levels higher than 38.9 pg/ml were found to be significantly related to the risk of viral-induced asthma attacks (AUC: 0.701, p = 0.002, sensitivity: 85% and specificity: 47%) (Fig. 2b) . In order to evaluate the relation of IP-10 levels with viralinduced asthma attacks, the risk factors that could relate to acute asthma were included in the multiple analysis of all asthmatics. Serum IP-10 >38.9 pg/ml and vit D levels were found to be significantly related to the risk of viral asthma attacks in the logistic regression analysis (IP-10; aOR: 8.93, p = 0.03, vit D; aOR: 0.82, p = 0.001) independent of age, sex, use of inhaled steroids, BMI, and serum levels of cathelicidin (Table 4 ).
