There were 191 children in the palivizumab-treated group and 230 in the untreated group, among whom 154 were not hospitalized with RSV and 76 were hospitalized with RSV. Of the 27 centers that enrolled subjects, 13 had subjects discontinue on or before day 730 (2-year cutoff). Sixteen (8.4%) in the palivizumab-treated group versus 21 (9.1%) in the 230 children not receiving palivizumab were discontinued before day 730. This difference was not statistically significant (P 5 .864). Demographics and baseline characteristics of the groups stratified by absence or presence of family history of atopy or food allergies are presented in Tables I and II , respectively. There were 201 children with no family history of atopy or food allergies and 220 children with a family history of atopy or food allergies who were enrolled in the study. In the subjects with no family history of atopy or food allergies, both untreated groups had significantly more children who were from multiple births, and accordingly there were more siblings than in the palivizumab-treated group (Table I) . In those with family history of atopy or food allergies, there were more children in day care in the untreated groups compared to the treated group. In both of these subgroups, the untreated infants had greater mean gestational age and birth weight than the palivizumab-treated infants (Tables I and II ). This was expected because guidelines for palivizumab use favor treatment for smaller, more premature infants. The combined untreated group also had a statistically significantly lower proportion of infants with baseline RSV antibody less than 2log 2 compared to the treated group, within the subgroup of infants with no family history of atopy or food allergies. Other demographic factors were comparable between the treated and untreated groups. Significantly smaller proportions of palivizumab-treated children had physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing during the first 24 months of follow-up compared to the combined untreated groups in the subgroups of children with (1) no family history of asthma (P 5 .039) and (2) no family history of atopy or food allergies (P 5 .012). Similar differences between the palivizumab-treated group and the nonhospitalized untreated group were also seen; however, the difference within the subgroup with no family history of asthma was not statistically significant (P 5 .083; Fig 1) . The relative incidence rate reductions were not significant for the subgroups of infants with a family history of allergy or atopy/food allergy (Fig 1) . The potential influence of baseline characteristics on the incidence of respiratory outcomes was explored with multiple logistic regression (Table III) . Palivizumab treatment was associated with significant reductions in the risk of physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing in infants without familial atopy/allergy histories. The reduction in the odds of an event was 68% in those with no family history of asthma and 80% in those with no history of atopy or food allergies. In contrast, in those subgroups with a family history of atopy or food allergies, palivizumab treatment did not have a significant effect on the occurrence of physiciandiagnosed recurrent wheezing. Other significant factors in those with no family history of asthma or atopy/food allergies were birth weight and/or gestational age (with greater values reducing the risk of the event). In contrast, in children with a family history of asthma, being a member of a multiple birth and having more siblings in day care significantly increased the risk of physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing, whereas having more siblings in the home decreased the risk. When we examined the time to the third episode of physiciandiagnosed wheezing by using Kaplan-Meier methodology (Fig 2) , the palivizumab-treated group demonstrated significantly longer times to the third episode in subgroups of infants with no family history of asthma or atopy/food allergies. In contrast, in the subgroups of infants with family histories of asthma or atopy/food allergies, the differences in time to third episode between the treated and untreated groups were not statistically significant. The potential influence of baseline characteristics on time to the third episode of physician-diagnosed wheezing was explored by using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model. Palivizumab treatment remained associated with a significantly longer time to the third episode in both of the subgroups of infants with no family history of asthma and those with no family atopy/food allergy histories (Table IV) . Greater gestational age was also associated with a longer time to the third episode in these subgroups. In contrast, palivizumab did not appear to have a significant effect on those with family histories of asthma or atopy/food allergies. Interestingly, in the subgroup of infants with a family history of atopy or food allergy, a family history of asthma was the most significant risk factor for the time to the third episode of physician-diagnosed wheezing.
