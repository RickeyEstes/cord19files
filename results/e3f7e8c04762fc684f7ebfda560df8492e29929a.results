Out of the 594 cats included in this study, 138 (23.2%) were stray cats and 456 (76.8%) were client-owned cats. It was not possible to obtain epidemiological and/or clinical data from every cat involved in the study, especially in stray animals. Table 2 shows the information available from the whole sample of cats included in this study (stray and client-owned cats). Data gathered from the population of the client-owned cats are shown in Tables 3 and 4 . In addition, these tables show the prevalences for the different hemoplasma species and the results for the assessment of associations between positivity to the hemoplasma PCR and the rest of data. The overall prevalence of hemoplasma infection in cats from Madrid was 10.6% (63/594). The prevalences of CMhm, Mhf and CMt were 8.1% (48/594), 3.7% (22/594) and 0.5% (3/594), respectively. A total of seven cats (1.17%) were co-infected with CMhm and Mhf, two (0.33%) with CMhm and CMt and another one (0.17%) with Mhf and CMt. No single infection with CMt was detected. Attending to the different lifestyle groups, prevalence of hemoplasma infection in stray cats was 15.9% (22/ 138) and prevalence in client-owned cats was 9% (41/ 456), the lifestyle (stray) of the cat being statistically associated with hemoplasma infection (χ 2 = 5.40, df = 1, P = 0.020). The same was observed when attending to Mhf infection (χ 2 = 12.56, df = 1, P = 0.0004), with 8.7% (12/ 138) positive to Mhf in stray cats, and 2.2% (10/456) in client-owned cats, but not in the case of CMhm or CMt. Data related to prevalence in different lifestyle groups are shown in Table 2 . Considering any of the hemoplasma infections assessed in stray and client-owned cats of this study, the season of the sample collection was significantly associated with positivity by PCR. Specifically, 63.5% (40/63) of the positive samples for any of the hemoplasmas were collected during spring and summer (χ 2 = 6.21, df = 1, P = 0.013). When considering this association in the different species of the study separately, the same was observed for CMhm (χ 2 = 4.01, df = 1, P = 0.045), with 62.5% (30/48) samples drawn in spring or summer, while Mhf infection was detected more frequently specifically in the samples collected during summer months in comparison with the other seasons together (P = 0.032, OR = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.13-0.89). Within other epidemiological data available from stray and client-owned cats of the study, significant associations were detected between male gender and CMhm (χ 2 = 17.55, df = 1, P < 0.0001), Mhf (χ 2 = 7.48, df = 1, P = 0.006) and overall hemoplasma infection (χ 2 = 21.10, df = 1, P < 0.0001). When analyzing epidemiological information that was available from client-owned cats only, some additional statistically significant associations between these data and hemoplasma prevalence were detected. Clientowned cats older than one year of age showed a significantly greater risk for hemoplasma infection (χ 2 = 4.41, df = 1, P = 0.036). This finding was not found when considering CMhm (χ 2 = 3.40, df = 1, P = 0.065), or Mhf (P = 0.665, OR = 0.75; 95% CI:0.15-3.79) infection alone. Having an outdoor access was identified as an additional risk factor for any hemoplasma species in clientowned cats (χ 2 = 5.51, df = 1, P = 0.019). None of the other epidemiological data evaluated were associated with hemoplasma infection. Retroviral status was confirmed as a risk factor in stray and client-owned cats. Cats positive for FeLV were more likely to be infected with any hemoplasma (P = 0.011, OR = 8.04; 95% CI: 3. No statistically significant differences in hemoplasmas' prevalences were detected between symptomatic and asymptomatic client-owned cats (Table 4 ). However, when specific clinical signs were evaluated, muscle-skeletal (15.8%, 6/38) and renal (11.2%, 13/116) signs were associated with CMhm infection (P = 0.035, OR = 2.97; 95% CI: 1.13-7.82, and χ 2 = 4.82, df = 1, P = 0.028, respectively). Hemoplasma-infected cats showed some remarkable findings in the hematological analysis. Low red blood cell (RBC) count was associated with infection by any hemoplasma (P = 0.009, OR = 0.22; 95% CI: 0.07-0.62), and specifically with Mhf (P = 0.031, OR = 0.09; 95% CI: 0.01-0.56) and CMhm (P = 0.025, OR = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.08-0.78) infection. Low haemoglobin (HGB) concentration was significantly associated with any hemoplasma and CMhm infection (χ 2 = 9.21, df = 1, P = 0.002 and χ 2 = 8.86 df = 1, P = 0.003, respectively) and low haematocrit (HTC) was associated with any hemoplasma infection (P = 0.004, OR = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.13-0.91). These results are shown in Table 4 . Ten cats were seropositive to FIP (3.29%, 10/304), with also one of these animals co-infected with CMhm and Mhf (P = 0.582, OR = 1.25; 95% CI: 0.15-10.29), but PCR for FIP was not performed. This animal was a young non-neutered male client-owned cat that was attended at the VMTH with musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal signs. Data available for the two client-owned cats with CMt infection are also detailed in Tables 2, 3 and 4. One of them was co-infected with Mhf and the other with CMhm. The one co-infected with Mhf was a non-neutered adult male (3 years old), client-owned cat with outdoor access, living in a rural area and positive for FIV. It was found to have a slight monocytosis, without other abnormalities in blood analysis. No previous contact with ectoparasites was reported. Unfortunately, the data available for the client-owned cat co-infected with CMt and CMhm was very scarce. Finally, another coinfected cat with CMhm and CMt was a 15 year old Abbreviations: CMhm "Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum", Mhf Mycoplasma haemofelis, CMt "Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis", RBC red blood cell count, HGB haemoglobin concentration, MCV mean corpuscular haemoglobin, MCH mean corpuscular haemoglobin, MCHC mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration *Statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) male stray cat, negative for retrovirus and with a high total protein concentration (9.7 g/dl).
