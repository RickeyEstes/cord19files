The crude extract was fractionated on Affi-gel blue gel into a larger unadsorbed fraction (BG1) eluted by the starting buffer and a smaller adsorbed fraction (BG2) eluted by starting buffer containing 1 M NaCl (Fig. 1A) . Antifungal activity resided only in fraction BG2, which was then resolved on SP-Sepharose into an unadsorbed fraction and three adsorbed fractions (SP1, SP2 and SP3) of approximately equal size which were desorbed with 0.2 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaCl and 1 M NaCl, respectively (Fig. 1B) . Antifungal activity was concentrated in fraction SP2. Fraction SP2 was separated on Mono S into a tiny unadsorbed fraction (S1) and two adsorbed fractions (S2 and S3) (Fig. 1C) . Antifungal activity was detected in the sharp adsorbed fraction S2 eluted soon after application of the 0.3-0.6 M NaCl gradient. Final purification of S2 on Superdex Peptide resulted in a major and a tiny absorbance peak, the former representing purified antifungal peptide (Fig. 1D ) with a molecular weight of 5.9 kDa in SDS-PAGE ( Fig. 2A ). Its molecular weight as determined by mass spectrometry was 5907 Da (Fig. 2B) . The yields of the chromatographic fractions with antifungal activity from 500 g seeds are as follows: crude extract (13765 mg), fraction BG2 (6648 mg), fraction SP2 (1023 mg), fraction S2 (342 mg) and purified antifungal peptide (32 mg). It differed from known Brassica antifungal proteins, napins and trypsin inhibitors in N-terminal sequence (Table 1) (Fig. 3) . The antifungal activity of the peptide was retained after exposure to temperatures in the range 20-80 8C for 10 min (Fig. 4A) and to the pH ranges 2-3 and 10-11 for 30 min (Fig. 4B) . It inhibited proliferation of HepG2 cells (Fig. 5A ) and MCF7 cells (Fig. 5B) with an IC 50 of 2.7 mM and 3.4 mM, respectively, and reduced the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an IC 50 of 4.9 mM (Fig. 5C) . It was devoid of mitogenic activity, HIV-1 integrase inhibitory, and SARS proteinase inhibitory activities (data not shown).
