Significant cytopathic changes were observed neither during nor after five weekly blind passages of TCV in HRT-18 cells using conventional cultivation procedures. A few rounded, enlarged and refractile cells, that progressively tended to aggregate into small clumps, were the only features observed during the course of infection. The evidence of viral replication in these cells included the observation of typical coronavirus particles by EM, and the demonstration of a weak HA activity (titers ranging from 1/16 to 1/32 ) in the supernatant culture fluids from each of the first five passages. The HA activity could be inhibited by pre-incubation of the supernatants with the rabbit anti-TCV hyperimmune serum. An intense immunogold labelling of coronavirus particles, Fig 1.

By 10-12 h after infection, the viral antigens detected by the PAG complex tended also to cluster around empty vacuoles (arrowhead). The bar represents 2 lira Fig. 2 .

The bar represents 2 llm located in the cytoplasmic vesicles of infected cells, was observed by EM at 12 and 18 h after infection (Fig. 1 ) . Uninfected HRT-18 cells treated in the same way, with the same antiserum, as well as infected-cell cultures incubated with the pre-immune serum or buffer prior to the protein A-gold treatment, showed no significant labelling, thus confirming the specificity of the reaction. Differences in labelling densities among the intracellular compartments were observed at various times after inoculation. Immunodetection of the virus in these cells showed gold complexes largely dispersed in the cytosol, after 6-8 h of incubation. By 10-12 h after infection, the PAG-labelled antigens tended to accumulate in more specific regions of the cytosol, particularly around intracytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 1) . Budding of viral particles through intracytoplasmic membranes could be detected by immunolabelling as soon as 8 h after infection (Fig. 2 ) . This was followed rapidly by an accumulation of viral particles within intracellular vacuoles. The virions were also commonly seen in the lumen of the nuclear envelope ( Fig. 1 ), but at no time was labelling observed in the nuclear region. Occasionally, large numbers of labelled virions were found in the area immediately surrounding the nucleus, possibly corresponding to the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3a) . The intracellular virions appeared as spherical particles with electron-lucent or -dense centers, and as having spiky or bulbous peplomers in their envelope (Fig. 3b ) . By 18-24 h after infection, progeny particles could be detected at the outer surface of infected cells, but the virions did not seem to be released from the cell by budding since no gold labelling was observed on the plasma membrane itself {Fig. 4 ). Instead, the virions appeared to exit within vesicles that migrate to the cell membrane and fuse with it. Small vesicles containing labelled viral particles were commonly observed near the cell surface and, in a few instances, exocytotic vesicles were shown partly surrounding extracellular virions. Later, large aggregates of progeny viral particles were detected near the outer surface of infected cells (data not shown). During the course of TCV infection, only mild structural changes were induced in the infected cells and viral particles were only occasionally observed in the intercellular spaces. The extracellular viral particles were enveloped, moderately pleomorphic, but mostly spherical in shape, and averaged 120 nm in diameter (Fig. 5) . The peplomers formed a fringe radiating from the viral envelope and they appeared to be club-shaped, 15-20 nm in length. Additional small granular projections Fig 5 Immunogold labelhng of extracellular TCV particles: (a) An unlabelled viral particle, as observed following incubation with pre-immune serum, which shows a double fringe of surface projections; (b) immunogold labelhng of an individual viral particle after incubation with rabbit anti-TCV hyperlmmune serum; (c) two rows of gold granules were frequently demonstrated around extracellular vlrlons; (d) the gold granules were located near the tips of the surface peplomers. Note the absence of labelling around viral particles without surface projections (arrowheads}. The arrow indicates a viral particle that lost only the large peplomers, but still possesses the fringe of small granular projections The bars represent 100 nm located near the base of the peplomers were also observed on the viral particles following incubation with the rabbit pre-immune sera (Fig. 5a) . The fringe of small granular projections appeared to be masked, probably by immunoglobulins, following the incubation with the rabbit anti-TCV hyperimmune sera (Fig. 5b) . Two rows of gold granules were frequently present at the surface of immunolabelled viral particles (Fig. 5c) . The gold granules were generally located near the tip of both types of surface projections, whereas the interior of the virus was not labelled. Only a few gold granules were observed around viral particles that lost their surface projections (Fig. 5d ). This suggests that the polyclonal anti-TCV hyperimmune serum contained mainly antibodies to the antigenic determinants situated at the surface of the virions.
