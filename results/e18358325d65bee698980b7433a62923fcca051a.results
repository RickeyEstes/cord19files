Extracellular E rns R171 is a monomer. E rns was purified from the supernatant of transiently transfected HEK cells, and its purity was verified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining as described in the Methods section (Fig. 1a) . In order to verify that the soluble E rns -R171 thus prepared is indeed monomeric as described for the intracellular protein obtained from BHK-21 cell lysates 36 , we analysed E rns of the strain Ncp7 by SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of the disulfide reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). Under non-reducing conditions, E rns -C171 appeared predominantly as a dimer, whereas the R171 mutant appeared almost completely as a monomer (Fig. 1b) . By contrast, both forms of E rns , i.e., C171 and R171, migrated as a single band at 40-50 kDa in the presence of 2-ME, which indicates the presence of covalently-linked disulfides in E rns C171 (Fig. 1b) . Monomeric E rns cleaves ss-and dsRNA in vitro. Subsequently, we investigated whether this covalent dimerisation is required to degrade dsRNA. In an in vitro RNase assay, E rns Ncp7-C171 and Ncp7-R171 were incubated with a 30 bp dsRNA fragment. Each strand of the dsRNA fragment contained either a red (Dyomics 681) or a green (Dyomics 781) fluorescent dye at their 3′-and 5′-ends (Table 1) to visualize the RNA degradation (see Fig. 2a for a schematic representation). Due to the combination of red and green color, the dsRNA appears as a yellow band in the gel and is thus easily distinguishable from the individual positive-and negative-sense single strands by its color and its different electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 2b , 'ctrl' in lanes 1 to 3). Both, wt and monomeric mutant E rns dose-dependently degraded a 30 bp dsRNA fragment with similar efficiency, whereas incubation of the dsRNA with E rns H30F, an RNase inactive mutant, showed no degradation at all (Fig. 2b) . Nonetheless, the preference of E rns to degrade single-strand substrates 25, 46 could be confirmed as less E rns was required to completely cleave the corresponding plus- (Fig. 2c ) and minus-sense ssRNA (Fig. 2d ) from the 30 bp dsRNA fragment analysed. The appearance of small, slow migrating fragments, as e.g. seen in Fig. 2b , could regularly be observed in samples with pronounced RNase activity and might represent the free dye or dye bound to a mononucleotide lacking negatively charged phosphate groups. These slower migrating fragments were also visible upon digestion of ssRNA when overexposing the images. In order to confirm these data, we reassessed the experiment using subgenomic BVD viral dsRNA of 200-300 bp in length as was used in previous experiments 28, 47 . In addition to Strep-tag purified E rns of the strain Ncp7 ( Supplementary Fig. S1a ), we also included non-tagged E rns proteins from the BVDV-I type strain NADL ( Supplementary Fig. S1c ) in addition to Ncp7 (Supplementary Fig. S1b ). As before, dimeric (C171) and monomeric (R171) E rns of both strains equally degraded BVD viral subgenomic dsRNA, whereas the RNase-inactive mutant (H30F) did not cleave the double-stranded substrate ( Supplementary  Fig. S1 ). As non-tagged, unpurified E rns still contained unspecific serum RNases as also exemplified in the supernatant of the empty vector control (pCI-SN), RNasin was added that was able to reduce, but not completely eliminate, unspecific RNase activity in the samples as described 28 . Monomeric E rns cleaves dsRNA in vitro under denaturing conditions. As E rns enzymes lacking the cysteine at position 171 might still form homodimers by hydrophobic, non-covalent interactions, we investigated whether the RNase retains its capacity to cleave viral RNA under denaturating conditions. Therefore, unpurified E rns NADL-C171 and NADL-R171 (compare Supplementary Fig. S1 ) were incubated with the RNA substrates in the presence of 7.2 M urea as strong chaotropic agent to remove non-covalent interactions. Nevertheless, both, the monomeric and the covalently-linked dimeric, forms of E rns efficiently degraded a 300 bp fragment of the NS3 (Fig. 3 ) and the 5′-UTR region (not shown) of the BVD viral genome. As RNasin was not active under these buffer conditions, weak non-specific RNase activity could still be observed with the supernatant of the empty vector control (pCI-SN). Monomeric E rns inhibits dsRNA-induced IFN synthesis. Others and we previously showed that wt E rns is able to inhibit IFN synthesis induced by extracellularly added ss-and dsRNA of viral origin and by synthetic dsRNA such as poly(I:C) 24, [26] [27] [28] . In accordance with the in vitro results presented above, Strep-tagged wt dimeric (C171) and mutant monomeric (R171) E rns of the BVDV strain Ncp7 significantly inhibited poly(I:C)-induced Mx expression (Fig. 4) , a widely used marker for the presence of IFN 2 . Similarly, non-tagged E rns C171 and R171 from both the BVDV strains, Ncp7 and NADL, also displayed equal efficiency in inhibiting poly(I:C)-stimulated Mx expression ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ), further excluding a strain-specific effect. Extended E rns substrate specificity. E rns belongs to the T2 family of endoribonucleases that preferably degrade ssRNA 25 . It is also known that E rns preferably cleaves RNA prior to uridine residues 25, 46, 48 . However, poly(I:C)-induced IFN synthesis is clearly inhibited by RNase-active E rns24, 26, 27 , indicating that the substrate specificity is not absolute. Accordingly, the degradation of the positive (+) and negative-sense (−) ssRNA showed no clearly distinct degradation pattern (Fig. 2) , although the ssRNA of negative polarity contains only a single uridine base in contrast to 10 uridines present in ssRNA+ (Table 1) . Therefore, we further investigated the substrate specificity of E rns . Short RNA polymers of the nucleobases adenine, uridine, cysteine, and guanine (poly(A), poly(U), poly(C), and poly(G), respectively) containing either a red (Dyomics 681) or a green (Dyomics 781) fluorescent dye at their 3′-and 5′-ends were synthesized (Table 1) . While poly(A), poly(U) and poly(C) were cleaved by E rns , with poly(C) being cleaved less efficiently than poly(U) and poly(A), homopolymeric poly(G) was protected from degradation at up to 10 ng/µl (Fig. 5) . Nevertheless, at approx. one order of magnitude higher concentrations of Purified, soluble E rns C171 and R171 (2.5 µg each) of the BVDV strain Ncp7 were incubated with or without β-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) as indicated. Samples were analysed by Western blot using an anti-E rns antibody for the non-reducing condition (left panel) or an anti-Strep tag antibody for the reducing condition (right panel). PageRuler Plus pre-stained protein ladder was used for size determination. The signal was detected using a CCD camera with an exposure time of 10 s (left panel) or 5 s (right panel). One representative experiment out of three is shown. ScIentIfIc REPORTs | (2018) 8:8226 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-26557-4 E rns , cleavage of poly(G) could be observed (not shown). But on all accounts, the dimeric and the monomeric form of E rns degraded the homopolymeric substrates with similar efficiency (Fig. 5 ). E rns acts as a nicking endoribonuclease. According to a crystal structure analysis of the catalytic domain of E rns , a dsRNA substrate does not fit into one active site 49 . Nevertheless, we could show that the monomeric mutant of E rns containing just one active site was still able to degrade dsRNA (Fig. 2B) . Together with the fact that E rns is preferentially a single strand endoribonuclease, we postulated that E rns might cleave just one strand out of a dsRNA. Therefore, we incubated E rns together with a double-stranded substrate containing an RNA strand hybridized to a complementary strand that is resistant to RNase degradation, i.e., 2′-O-methylated RNA (metRNA) or DNA (see Fig. 6a for a schematic representation). Each strand was modified at its 3′-and 5′-ends with a red or green fluorescent dye to be able to differentiate the susceptible (red) from the protected strand (green). The latter was confirmed by the fact that single-stranded DNA and metRNA were resistant to degradation even at the highest concentration of E rns applied (Fig. 6b) . Both, dimeric E rns C171 and monomeric E rns R171, degraded the susceptible RNA strand in the RNA/DNA-as well as in the RNA/metRNA-hybrid with the DNA and metRNA strand being resistant to degradation (Fig. 6c,d) . Thus, the double-stranded hybrid appears in yellow in the analysis by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 6c,d) , which disappears by cleavage of the susceptible RNA (in red) by RNA-active E rns . Thereby, the resistant strand (green) is gradually released from the double strand and finally Table 1 . Sequences of all short nucleotide substrates and their 5′-and 3′-modification by either Dyomics 681 (red) or 781 (green) that were used in the RNase activity assays. Samples were separated by 14% PAGE and fluorescence was analysed with a Li-Cor Odyssey system. The identity of the red and green fragments with reduced electrophoretic mobility that appear only upon cleavage remain to be determined. Due to the known, defined length of the directly labeled fragments, no size ladder was applied. Non-cropped gels as representative experiment out of three is shown. displays the same electrophoretic mobility as displayed by its single stranded control (Fig. 6c,d) , including the probably higher order structured form of ssDNA displaying reduced electrophoretic mobility. In order to exclude a role of the buffer composition in the formation of dsRNA, we repeated the experiment in the buffer required for RNase III to exclusively degrade dsRNA ( Supplementary Fig. 3) . Thus, RNase III degraded dsRNA but none of the other substrates (ssRNA and methylated RNA/RNA hybrid), which confirms the double-stranded form of the corresponding substrates. Nevertheless, E rns was still able to cleave dsRNA and ssRNA either present alone or in the hybrid form. As expected, the RNase-inactive mutant of E rns , H30F, did not cleave any substrate, even though some non-specific degradation of the highly susceptible ssRNA by contaminating RNase was occasionally observed (see e.g., right panel in Supplementary Fig. 3 ).
