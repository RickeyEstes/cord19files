HBoV DNA was detected in samples of 12 children (3.3%), 6 of them males. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that HBoV sequences of 11 cases were identical to each other and to the Swedish strain st2 (NC007455), differing by 1 nucleotide from the 12 th case (GR186), which was identical to strain CHSD4 (DQ471814) from USA. All cases had clinical evidence of lower RTI (fever, tachypnoea, hypoxia, retractions, and abnormal auscultation findings). Four of the 12 cases were coinfections, 3 of them with influenza A virus and 1 with coronavirus OC43. Concerning the 8 patients in whom only HBoV was detected, they were 3 males and 5 girls, aged 2-33 months (mean age ± SD: 17 ±9 months), hospitalized with the clinical diagnosis of 2 each: laryngotracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and asthma exacerbation. Common symptoms of viral respiratory tract infection such as fever, cough, rhinorrhoea and pharyngitis were found in the majority of our patients (87.5-100%). Six patients (75%) presented with various degrees of respiratory distress. Those patients had tachypnoea (a respiratory rate of 45-90 breaths/min) and low haemoglobin oxygen saturation levels (SaO 2 ) in the range 90-94%. These children received oxygen supplementation until 1 day before discharge. Wheezing was the most common clinical finding (5 patients) while another 1 child presented with stridor. Hoarseness was noticed in 2 children. Difficulty in feeding was also a common complaint, reported by 5 patients. Other clinical findings included diarrhoea (2 patients, 25%), a symptom previously described in HBoV infections [11, 12] , and otitis media (1 patient, 12.5%). The major clinical and laboratory findings in the 8 patients in whom HBoV was the sole pathogen detected are presented in Table I . Chest X-rays were available for all 8 children. The most common finding, present in 6 patients, was bilateral interstitial infiltrates. Consolidation was detected in the other 2 children. Clinical expression was not different in children with HBoV co-infection. The child with coronavirus OC43 co-infection also presented with conjunctivitis, while respiratory distress was the main concern in a child with influenza-A virus co-infection. All children recovered uneventfully. The median hospitalization time was 5 days (range 4-9 days). For 1 patient a second throat swab sample, taken 20 days after the first one, was found negative for HBoV DNA.
