Eighty-eight individuals from community sites were enrolled in the study from nine sites in the Yunnan (n=36), Guangxi (n=25) and Guangdong (n=27) provinces from March to December 2015. All study sites were rural locations with permanent housing structures for family dwelling or community use. Family-owned cropland for small-scale vegetable, fruit and rice production was distributed around human dwellings, extending to nearby mountains. New buildings and roads were under construction and live animals were sold at local wet markets. Few wild animals were seen during our visits to all of the sites during the daytime. (Figure 2 ). I am on the way to interview a potential participant, currently going through a small local market, here they sell fresh vegetables, fruits, pork and live poultry on both sides of the street. Live chickens, ducks and geese are mixed and kept in cages, I can smell the faeces. A vendor (female) is slaughtering a chicken for her customer who just selected one from the cage, she seems very proficient, only wears an apron but no gloves, the ground is covered by blood and feathers. Not far away, there is a woman wearing an orange uniform who is cleaning the street.
