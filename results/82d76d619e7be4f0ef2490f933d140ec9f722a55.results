Relative effective population sizes of OC43 genotypes. To verify the epidemic history of OC43 genotypes over the study period, the relative effective viral population size over time was inferred by analyzing the genetic diversity of the S gene using the Bayesian skyline model. Only the strains obtained from clinical samples containing the full length S, RdRp, and N genes retrieved from PubMed (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) for the years 2003 to 2012 were used (see Supplementary Table S1 on line). A varying population size profile was observed (Fig. 1) . The overall plot of OC43 (including genotypes B, C, D and E) showed two large bottlenecks. The first was found between 2006 and 2007, showing a decrease in relative genetic diversity in 2006, followed by an increase in 2007. The second was found between 2008 and 2009, with a transient decrease before 2008, followed by an increase in relative genetic diversity coinciding with a temporal epidemic in population size. Genotype B exhibited a transient increase in 2004, then followed a steady but slowly increased relative genetic diversity, corresponding to global increases in its detection 17 . Genotype D showed a decreased genetic diversity before 2007, then an increase after 2009, consistent with its dominant epidemic from 2007 to 2012 17 . Genotype C and E both exhibited a short and steady relative genetic diversity during the study period. The history of the relative genetic diversity obtained here corresponds to global epidemic data, indicating that the relative genetic diversity measured by the S gene generally reflects the HCoV-OC43 dynamic in population size. The relative genetic diversity of genotype D corresponded to the two bottlenecks of OC43, indicating that genotype D accounts for much of the genetic diversity of OC43 and is the predominant genotype. Evolutionary rate of OC43 genotypes. To explore why genotype D became dominant after 2007, we calculated the evolutionary rate of OC43 genotypes. Using the constant population size under a relaxed-clock method, the mean evolutionary rate of the S gene was estimated to be 8.48 × 10 −4 substitutions/site/year for OC43, consistent with previous reports 8 . For genotypes B, C, D and E, the mean evolutionary rate of S gene was 9.85, 4.85, 8.83 and 6.01 × 10 −4 substitutions/site/year, respectively (Table 1) . Similar results were obtained using the exponential growth model ( Table 1) . The highest evolutionary rates were observed in genotype B and D, suggesting that the two genotypes evolved faster than others.
