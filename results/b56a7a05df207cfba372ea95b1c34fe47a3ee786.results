By using PCR to amplify the M gene, CCoV RNA was detected in 30 out of 250 sampled dogs. The majority of the positive samples (21/30) were from puppies under two months of age. For 27/30 strains, the sequences were of sufficient quality for analysis. Based on the AA changes found in residues 127, 173, 193, 200 and 201 of the M protein, eight strains were characterized as CCoV-I while another 19 as CCoV-II (Table 1) . Alignment of the deduced amino acid (AA) sequences to the sequence of strain Insavc (D13096) revealed 10 nonsynonymous substitutions. Among the 10 AA changes, five were found in all CCoV-I strains: 127 (Ile/Val ! Ala), 173 (Val ! Thr), 193 (Ile ! Met), 200 (Asp ! Glu) and 201 (Asn ! His). As shown in Table 1 , these AA changes were present in the strains from this study and in the reference strains. Moreover, six of the Brazilian strains analyzed contained non-synonymous substitutions not previously described. AA changes at residues 119 (Ile ! Thr) and 121 (Gly!Cys) were found in strain RJ1133/12. Another two strains (RJ915/08 and RJ916/08) contained a nonsynonymous substitution at residue 120 (Ala ! Thr), while RJ999/10 was substituted at residue 144 (Lys ! Arg). An AA change at residue 137 (Ile ! Phe) was found in two CCoV-II strains from 2011 (RJ1084/11 and RJ1091/11) (Table 1) . A RT-PCR typing approach for the S gene was utilized and 25/30 CCoV-positive strains showed amplification with one or two primer pairs (Table 2 ). In 17/25 samples, a single infection was detected: six samples with CCoV-I, nine with CCoV-IIa and two with CCoV-IIb. Eight samples were positive for more than one genotype/subtype: seven samples with CCoV-I/IIa and one with CCoV-I/IIb (Table 2) . Among five samples giving negative results for the S gene, two (RJ917/08 and 925/08) were PCR-positive for the M gene but could not be analyzed after sequencing. Another three samples (RJ900/08, RJ1084/11 and RJ1140/12) were characterized as CCoV-II. The results of CCoV typing (I and II) by M and S genes were concordant for 16/17 samples from puppies with single infections. Characterization of one sample (RJ1094/11) was not possible, as its S gene was amplified by RT-PCR with the CCoV-I-specific primers EL1F/EL1R, while it was typed as CCoV-II by sequence analysis of its M region. Among seven samples that were positive for more than one CCoV genotype/subtype by S gene, sequence analysis of the M gene allowed the characterization of only one genotype (Table 2) . Sequence analysis of the 11 Brazilian CCoV-I strains revealed that they shared 96.2-100% nt and 98.2-100% AA identity. These strains also shared 94.2-97.1% nt and 98.2-100% AA identity with either Elmo/02 (AY307020.1) or 23/ 03 (AY307021.1) prototypes. Amino acid changes were found at residue 1207 (Lys ! Arg) in one sample (891/08) and at 1264 (Thr ! Met) in another six samples (RJ861/07, RJ982/09, RJ999/10, RJ1006/10, RJ1007/10 and RJ1094/10). At the phylogenetic level, the sequenced strains were grouped in the same cluster with either Elmo/02 or 23/03 prototypes (Fig. 1a) .  Bold indicates amino acid changes of Brazilian strains. Sequence analysis of the eight Brazilian CCoV-IIa strains showed that they shared 90.0-99.7% nt and 93.0-100% AA identity. These strains also shared 88.4-96.1% nt and 94.3-99.1% aa identity with the CCoV-IIa reference strains Insavc (D13096), BGF-10 (AY342160.1) and CB/05 (DQ112226.1). Among the AA changes identified, six were found only in samples from this study (RJ905/08, RJ1042/11, RJ1093/11 and RJ1137/12). The sequence of the RJ1086/11 strain revealed eight AA changes encoded on the 694-bp fragment that have not been described for other CCoV-IIa strains (Table 3) . Upon phlylogenetic analysis this strain formed a cluster distinct from the other CCoV-IIa sequences (Fig. 1b) . Sequence analysis of the three Brazilian CCoV-IIb strains showed that they shared 95.3-98.2% nt and - IIb  3  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  13  14  15  18  24  25  32  38  45  49  50   TGEV  Lys  Phe  Val  Val  Leu  Val  Val  Met  Leu  Ile  Tyr  Asn  Leu  Thr  Gln  Thr  Ser  Pro  Asn  UCD-1  Leu  ------Leu  Ser  ---Phe  Leu  His  Asn  Ile  --04-0709  Phe  -Phe  -Leu  Ile  Val  -Val  -Glu  --His  --Ser  -174/06  Phe  -Phe  --Ile  Val  ---Asp  Phe  Leu  His  ----430/07  Phe  -Phe  --Ile  Val  ---Glu  Phe  Leu  His  ----66/09 Phe 91.2-96.4% AA identity. These strains also shared 79.1-84.3% nt and 84.2-91.2% AA identity with the CCoV-IIb reference strains UCD-1 (AF116248.1) and 430/07 (EU924790.1). The CCoV-IIb strains from this study exhibited an insertion of three nucleotides at the 5 0 end of the spike gene, resulting in the addition of an AA at residue five as in the UCD-1 strain. These samples also showed three non-synonymous substitutions when compared to other CCoV-IIb strains (Table 3) . According to the phylogenetic analysis result, the Brazilian CCoV-IIb strains formed a unique clade (Fig. 1c) . Mixed infections were detected in 14/25 (56%) puppies: 10 cases of CCoV/CPV, one of CCoV/RV-A, one of CCoV/CPV/ RV-A and two of CCoV/CPV/CaAstV. As characterization of the CCoV genotype/subtype by S gene RT-PCR was not possible for 5/30 samples, they were not included in this analysis (Table 2) . Based on clinical reports, three CCoV-I-positive puppies presented mild enteric signs (soft diarrhea), while four CCoV-IIa-positive puppies showed more severe clinical signs (vomiting, hemorrhagic diarrhea); one died during the hospitalization period. A partial sequence analysis of the S gene showed AA identities of 98.7% to the pantropic strains described in the literature (CB/05 and 450/07). In puppies with dual CCoV or mixed infections, the clinical signs varied from mild to fatally severe, as shown in Table 2 . Among 30 CCoV-positive puppies, 11 received either one (10 puppies) or three doses (1 puppy) of inactivated CCoV vaccine. Another 12 had not been vaccinated, and for the remaining seven, the vaccination data were not available.
