A total of 400 samples were collected from April to October, 2013. The numbers of samples obtained from Zhejiang University, Yu-Yao, and Hu-Zhou hospitals were 359, 26, and 15, respectively. There were 259 (65%) male and 141 (35%) female patients, and the median age was 57 years old. Further characteristics of the patients and C. difficile detection outcomes are listed in Table 1 . Among the 82 (20.5%) C. difficile-positive patients, they were all tcdA and tcdB positive strains (tcdA + and tcdB +) and no toxin gene-deleted strains (tcdA + and tcdB-, tcdAand tcdB+) were identified. All the 20 diarrheal patients were considered as mild diarrhea. No moderate or severe diarrhea was identified. The C. difficile-positive rates in the diarrhea and nondiarrhea patients were 35% and 19.7%, respectively (p = 0.09, as shown in Table 1 ). No association was found between the C. difficile-positive rate and clinical factors, including collection time, sex, diagnosis, PPI use, chemotherapy regimen and gastroenterological surgery within the last 3 months, and antibiotic drug use within the last 3 months.
