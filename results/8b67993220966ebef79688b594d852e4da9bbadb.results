Exposure to empty virus capsid from P22 bacteriophage induces timedependent kinetics of S. aureus bacterial clearance, similar to IAV. Building on previous results demonstrating either sHSP capsid-or IAV-induced clearance of subsequent S. aureus challenge, we examined another capsid, derived from the bacteriophage P22, and a natural mouse virus to ensure that this phenomenon was not capsid or virus specific. As with sHSP capsid, IAV and P22 capsids share no protein similarity, although they do share a similar spherical shape with a polyvalent protein surface (17) (Fig. 1A) . The ability of the host to clear secondary post-IAV S. aureus pneumonia changes over time (11, 14) , and we hypothesized that this time dependence and the associated immune responses may be utilized to characterize similarities in the recognition of the virus and the capsid. To test this initial hypothesis, wild-type (WT) mice were inoculated with either IAV or P22 capsid and then challenged with S. aureus 3, 7, or 14 days later (Fig. 1B) . As capsids are replication deficient, we inoculated mice with 3 consecutive daily doses, mimicking the replication of an infectious virus. Compared to mock-inoculated mice, mice inoculated with P22 capsid displayed a similar increase in clearance of S. aureus as did IAV-inoculated mice at day 3 postinoculation (p.i.) (Fig. 1C ). By day 7 p.i., both P22 capsid-and IAV-inoculated mice showed at least a 10-fold decrease in bacterial clearance (Fig. 1C ). At day 14 p.i., IAV-inoculated mice, which by this point would still have resulting immune effects from a productive viral infection (18, 19) , exhibited improved bacterial clearance, whereas bacterial clearance in P22 capsid-inoculated mice was similar to that of mockinoculated mice (Fig. 1C) . Inoculation of mice with pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), a cause of natural mouse viral infection that results in/induces pathology similar to that caused by human respiratory syncytial virus (20) , resulted in a similar time-dependent clearance of S. aureus challenge as found with P22 capsids or IAV (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). P22 capsid inoculation induces cytokine and cellular immune responses, similar to IAV, both before and after S. aureus challenge. To determine whether the similar patterns of bacterial clearance induced by IAV and by P22 capsid inoculation are also associated with a common cytokine response, we compared levels of interleukin-13 (IL-13), which contributes to clearance of S. aureus infection in the lung (11, 14) , and gamma interferon (IFN-␥), which both we and others have found to be disease enhancing (11, 14, 21) . Compared to mock-inoculated WT mice, both P22 capsid-and IAV-inoculated mice exhibited increased IL-13 production when challenged with S. aureus at day 3 p.i. (Fig. 1D) . However, when challenged at day 7 p.i. with S. aureus, both P22 capsid-and IAV-inoculated mice showed diminished IL-13 production. For IFN-␥ production, com-pared to mock-inoculated WT mice, both P22 capsid-and IAV-inoculated mice showed diminished production of this cytokine when challenged with S. aureus at day 3 p.i., but when challenged at day 7 p.i., both P22 capsid-and IAV-inoculated mice showed increased IFN-␥ production (Fig. 1D) . IFN-␥ can impair bacterial clearance by macrophages (21) , whereas IL-13 can be involved in neutrophil recruitment (22) . We previously reported that both CD11c ϩ (alveolar macrophages) and Ly6G ϩ cells (neutrophils) isolated from IAV-inoculated mice . (E and F) WT mice were inoculated as described for panel C, CD11c ϩ (E) or Ly6G ϩ (F) cells were purified from the lungs at day 3 or 7, and their ability to kill S. aureus following a 1.5-h (E) or 3-h (F) incubation ex vivo was determined. The experiment in panel C had a minimum of 5 animals per group, the ex vivo experiment in panel D had 5 biological and 3 technical replicates, and the ex vivo experiment in panels E and F had 3 combined biological with 5 technical replicates. Each was repeated three times. Data are represented as mean Ϯ SD. *, P Ͻ 0.05; **, P Ͻ 0.01; ***, P Ͻ 0.001.
