Systematic analysis of studies that described the epidemiological, demographic and clinical features of CHIKV cases and reported the prevalence of a number of chronic diseases in the infectious disease, has identified 11 reports (Arroyo-Avila et al., 2017; Economopoulou et al., 2009; Padmakumar et al., 2010; Jean-Baptiste et al., 2016; Sá deOliveira et al., 2017; Perti et al., 2016; Crosby et al., 2016; Chusri et al., 2014; Couturier et al., 2012; Tandale et al., 2009; Borgherini et al., 2007) with 2,773 patients (Table 1 ). This limited number of reports is the result of our strict search strategy and selection criteria and our focus only on the studies recording the prevalence of comorbidities in CHIKV. The majority of the cases were from South Asia, particularly India, followed by a significant number from South America. With the exception of a report from Brazil (Sá deOliveira et al., 2017), the number of cases in the selected studies varied by $25-fold and ranged from 45 (Chusri et al., 2014) to 1,111 (Padmakumar et al., 2010) cases. The 1,111 cases from India (Padmakumar et al., 2010) were not included in any meta-analysis since it was the only study referring to the prevalence of obesity in CHIKV. The sex ratio (male: female) was 0.83 with a weighted overall average age (AESD) of 42.9 AE 13.9 years (range: 21-70 years). Meta-analysis for the identified studies showed that the most prevalent clinical symptoms were pyrexia (90.7%; 95% CI: 86.6-93.6%) and arthralgia (85.2%; 95% CI: 70.2-93.4%) with cephalgia, myalgia, joint edema, dermatitis and malaise in $30-50% of the cases. There was a small heterogeneity (Cochran's Q) in the estimates of clinical symptoms among the identified studies with an I 2 index varied up to 56.8% (Table 1) . As shown in Figure 2 (panel A), hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity in CHIKV infection (31.3% of the cases; 95% CI: 17.9-48.8%) followed by diabetes (20.5%; 95% CI: 12.7-31.3%), cardiac diseases (14.8%; 95% CI: 8.1-25.5%) and asthma (only in 7.9% of the cases; 95% CI: 3.3-17.7). Prevalence of obesity was reported only in one of the identified studies (Padmakumar et al., 2010) . Characteristics of this study were mentioned in Table 1 but were excluded from any further meta-analysis given this limited data set. The prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, cardiac diseases and asthma varied by 25-, 5-, 28-and 50-fold among the identified studies, respectively. This wide among-studies variation in the proportion of comorbidities may have resulted in the heterogeneity (I 2 index) observed for the estimates of comorbidities that varied from 25.1% to 96.4% ( Figure  2) . However, the true heterogeneity estimated by between-study variance in the random-effect model (t 2 ) was varied between 0.029 to 0.074 for the examined comorbidities. As shown in Table 2 , the proportion of diabetes, hypertension and cardiac diseases was 4-to 5-fold higher (p < 0.05) in elder patients than their younger counterparts. We found a significant direct correlation between Figure 2 . Meta-analysis for the proportion of comorbidities in chikungunya cases. Weights are calculated from binary random-effects model analysis. Values represent proportions of diabetes, hypertension, cardiac diseases and asthma in all CHIKV cases (panel A) and severe cases (panel B) and 95% CI. Severity was defined as cases that underwent ICU, those with acute diseases, patients with complications and subjects with atypical CHIKV, joints involvement, hospitalization, and/or death. Analysis of heterogeneity is also presented as results of the Q test and the among-studies variation (I 2 index). Insert shows the odds ratio (OR and 95%CI) of developing severe CHIKV in patients with comorbidities. patients' age and the prevalence of diabetes (r = 0.65, p = 0.03), hypertension (r = 0.68, p = 0.033) and cardiac diseases (r = 0.65, p = 0.029) but inverse relationship (r = À0.88, p = 0.023) with asthma (data not shown). Severe CHIKV cases were defined as cases that underwent ICU, those with acute diseases (e.g., acute encephalitis) and subjects with atypical CHIKV (atypical clinical manifestations of CHIKV include vesiculobullous lesions, febrile seizures, and meningoencephalitis), joints involvement (e.g., inflammatory joint destruction), hospitalization, and/or death (see above). Cases with severe CHIKV had a significantly higher proportion of diabetes (22.9% vs. 20.5%, p < 0.05) (Figure 2; panel B ). Infected patients with diabetes (both types I and II, combined)but not those with hypertension or cardiac diseaseshad OR of 1.2 (95% CI: 1.05-1.48; p = 0.0135) for developing severe CHIKV outcome compared to those with no diabetes.
