To determine the potential antiviral effect of IFN-a2b and ribavirin on nCoV isolate hCoV-EMC/2012 replication, susceptible cells were infected with hCoV-EMC/2012. Following 1 h absorption, infected cells were treated with either IFN-a2b or ribavirin. In Vero cells, IFN-a2b reduced the cytopathogenic effect (CPE) starting at a concentration of 250 U/ml and completely eliminated CPE at 1000 U/ ml and above ( Figure 1A ). Ribavirin reduced CPE starting at a concentration of 100 mg/ml and completely eliminated CPE at 200 mg/ ml and above ( Figure 1A ). Viral protein levels, as measured by nucleocapsid protein expression in cell lysates, were also reduced in the presence of increasing levels of IFN-a2b, with a reduction starting at 250 U/ml ( Figure 1B) . In response to ribavirin treatment, a reduction in nucleocapsid protein expression was observed at 50 mg/ml, but did not appear to be dose dependent ( Figure 1B ). Supernatants were collected on days 1, 3 and 5 post-infection and subsequent analyses of viral loads (viral RNA) and titers were performed. Peak viral loads and infectious virus were recovered from day 3 samples; therefore, this time point was used for subsequent analysis. Supernatants collected on day 5 frequently had lower viral loads and titers than samples collected on day 3, likely due to extensive CPE. As such, day 5 samples were not included in the analyses. A dose dependent reduction in genome copies was observed for IFN-a2b treatment with a 0.53-log reduction in viral loads at 500 U/ml reaching a 1.84-log reduction at 5000 U/ml (Figure 2A) . A dose dependent reduction in viral loads was also observed for ribavirin treatment, with a 0.82-log reduction at 200 mg/ml reaching a 2.04-log reduction at 2000 mg/ml ( Figure 2B ). Importantly, a corresponding decrease in infectious virus was also observed as a result of IFN-a2b or ribavirin treatment. A 0.57-log reduction in virus titer occurred at 500 U/ml IFN-a2b, increasing to a 1.31-log reduction at 5000 U/ml IFN-a2b ( Figure 2C ). For ribavirin, a 1.24-log reduction in virus titer was observed at 100 mg/ml, reaching a 4.05-log reduction at 2000 mg/ ml ( Figure 2D ). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of IFN-a2b and ribavirin was subsequently determined to be 58.08 U/ml and 41.45 mg/ml, respectively ( Table 1 ). The IC 90 (1-log reduction) and IC 99 (2-log reduction) values were also calculated ( Table 1) . While this is a significant finding, the concentrations of IFN-a2b or ribavirin required to effectively inhibit hCoV-EMC/2012 replication are quite high and may therefore be of limited clinical application. Vero cells have been described as comparatively resistant to ribavirin, as they are inefficient at converting ribavirin into its mono-and tri-phosphate forms 19 . Therefore, we also assessed the sensitivity of hCoV-EMC/2012 to IFN-a2b and ribavirin in LLC-MK2 cells ( Figure 3A , B). Based on IC values, LLC-MK2 cells were more responsive to both IFN-a2b and ribavirin treatment (Table 1) . IFN-a2b, at the maximum concentration tested (2000 U/ml), reduced infectious titers by 3.97-log (2.01-log reduction in genome copies). Ribavirin treatment, at 200 mg/ml or higher, reduced infectious virus below the detection threshold of 13.7 TCID 50 /ml. Given their long history of combined use for treatment of hepatitis C 20,21 , we combined IFN-a2b and ribavirin treatment to determine whether one compound would augment the activity of the other. Combination treatment in Vero and LLC-MK2 cells lowered the threshold at which a decrease in CPE was noted. For Vero cells, this was reduced to 62 U/ml IFN-a2b and 12 mg/ml ribavirin with the absence of CPE at and above 125 U/ml IFN-a2b and 25 mg/ml ribavirin ( Figure 1A ). This represents an 8-and 16-fold decrease in the amount of IFN-a2b and ribavirin, respectively, which is required to achieve the same reduction as either treatment alone. Viral nucleocapsid protein expression was also reduced in a dose dependent manner starting at concentrations of IFN-a2b and ribavirin of 250 U/ml and 50 mg/ml, respectively ( Figure 1B) . The reduction in CPE and nucleocapsid protein expression also correlated with reduced virus genome copies and titers. When IFN-a2b was administered with ribavirin at 551 ratio, there was an additional reduction in the virus titer by 0.4-to 2.16-logs over that of IFN-a2b treatment alone ( Figure 4 ).
