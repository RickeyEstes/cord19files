Vsig4 −/− mice are more susceptible to HFD-induced obesity. Macrophages actively contribute to the pathogenesis of dietinduced obesity 5, 6 , making them seemingly a good model for examination of the biological functions of VSIG4. For this, agematched C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and Vsig4 −/− mice were fed a HFD. Interestingly, we found that Vsig4 −/− mice gained significantly more body masses than their WT controls after 5 weeks of HFD feeding (Fig. 1a) . However, no significant differences of body masses between the two groups fed a normal chow diet (NCD) (Supplementary Fig. 1a ). Analytical microCT (μCT) imaging revealed an increase in fat mass throughout the bodies of the Vsig4 −/− obese mice, with substantially more abundant visceral fat (Fig. 1b) . Vsig4 −/− obese mice also manifested with significant increases in abdominal wall fat and perirenal fat compared to the WT controls. In parallel, we also observed a substantial increase in the serum levels of triglyceride, cholesterol and free fatty acid, which correlated to increases in body fat in Vsig4 −/− obese mice (Fig. 1c) . Furthermore, Vsig4 −/− obese mice tended to develop with high liver triglyceride levels and steatosis (Fig. 1d) , as well as enlarge adipocytes (Fig. 1e) . These data imply that Vsig4 deficiency renders mice susceptible to HFD-induced obesity. Obesity is often associated with insulin resistance 5 , a fact that led us to postulate that Vsig4 −/− mice might have a disturbed glucose metabolism. We next examined the blood glucose levels of these obese mice. Vsig4 −/− obese mice exhibited statistically significant elevations in blood glucose relative to WT littermates after 15 h of fasting. Moreover, the 5-h-fasting insulin levels were also substantially elevated (Fig. 1f ). An oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) illustrated that Vsig4 −/− obese mice had significantly higher serum levels of glucose and insulin in response to the glucose load compared to their WT littermate controls, suggesting a severely impaired glucose metabolism (Fig. 1g) . Nevertheless, the blood glucose metabolism was similar between the two groups under NCD conditions ( Supplementary Fig. 1b, c) . The insulin tolerance test (ITT) also indicated the existence of a significantly more resistance in Vsig4 −/− obese mice compared to the WT controls (Fig. 1g) . Additionally, as compared to WT controls, western blot analyses revealed that Vsig4 −/− obese mice had diminished phosphorylation of IRS-1 (p-IRS-1) and phosphorylation of Akt (p-Akt ser473 ) in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT), muscle and liver tissues after administrated with insulin (Fig. 1h) . These data indicate that Vsig4 deficiency promotes obesityassociated insulin resistance. To better understand the mechanisms by which the VSIG4 pathway prevents weight gain during HFD consumption, we addressed the food intake of these mice. There were no obvious changes in food intake and stool output between the WT and Vsig4 −/− mice under HFD conditions ( Supplementary Fig. 2) , implying that the differences in weight gain are due to reasons other than food consumption. We therefore examined the status of the ATMs. Compared to WT littermates, flow cytometric assay showed that the ATMs from Vsig4 −/− obese mice expressed higher amounts of proinflammatory factors (like pro-IL-1β, IFNγ, and TNF), which have been described to actively participate into the pathogenesis of HFD-caused obesity and insulin resistance 26, 27 (Fig. 1i) . In parallel, dramatically higher levels of these cytokines were accumulated in the VAT of Vsig4 −/− mice, as detected by qRT-PCR (Fig. 1j ) and western blot (Fig. 1k) , respectively. These data suggest that Vsig4 deficiency initiates macrophage-mediated inflammation, which triggers HFDinduced obesity and insulin resistance. Vsig4 −/− mice exacerbate MHV-3-induced fulminant hepatitis. We further investigated the potential role of Vsig4 in viral fulminant hepatitis caused by MHV-3 infection, in which the virusinduced exaggerated inflammation causes severe pathogenesis largely due to the M1 macrophage-dependent "cytokine storm" 7 . Vsig4 −/− and congenic C57BL/6 WT littermates were infected with MHV-3 (100 PFU/mouse). Noticeably, Vsig4 −/− mice died rapidly following MHV-3 infection in contrast to WT littermates (log-rank test, p = 0.0339, Fig. 2a) . H&E staining showed that the infected Vsig4 −/− animals had more severe liver necrosis and hepatocyte apoptosis at 48 h and 72 h of infection (Fig. 2b) , along with significantly higher levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), the two liver damage indicating enzymes released into the blood compared with WT controls (Fig. 2c) . Plaque assay data also showed that Vsig4 deficiency promoted virus replication in liver tissues Weeks of HFD feeding Fig. 1 Vsig4 −/− mice are more susceptible to HFD-induced obesity with insulin resistance.

Data are representative of five (a) and three (c-i) independent experiments NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/s41467-017-01327-4 ARTICLE (Fig. 2d ). This suggests that VSIG4 is capable of attenuating MHV-3-induced pathogenesis. The macrophage-derived FGL2 and proinflammatory cytokines including TNF, IL-1 and IL-6, play essential roles in the pathogenesis of MHV-3-induced fulminant hepatitis [28] [29] [30] . We therefore examined the expression of these mediators in peritoneal exudate macrophages (PEMs) and liver tissues. Although Vsig4 deficiency did not seem to affect the basal expression level of these factors before viral infection (Supplementary Fig. 3 ), qRT-PCR data showed that MHV-3 infection super-induced Vsig4 −/− PEMs to express Fgl2, Tnf, Il-1β, and Il-6 ( Fig. 2e) . Flow cytometric data also confirmed at protein levels that inflammatory cytokines like pro-IL1-β, TNF, and IL-6, were dramatically increased in virus-infected Vsig4 −/− PEMs (Fig. 2f) , suggesting Vsig4 deficiency promotes macrophage-derived inflammation in vivo. Consistent with this, Vsig4 deficiency in liver Kupffer cells also resulted in higher levels of these factors deposited in the infected liver tissues, as detected by qRT-PCR ( Fig. 2e) , western blot (Fig. 2g) , and immunohistochemistry ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Therefore, dramatically higher levels of these proinflammatory cytokines were accumulated in the virusinfected Vsig4 −/− serum (Fig. 2h) . Finally, Vsig4 −/− mice responded with severe fibrinogen formation, leading to increased liver coagulation and necrosis post infection ( Supplementary  Fig. 4 ). VSIG4 has been described to be a negative regulator of Tcell activation 20 , nevertheless, the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF and IFN-γ), and the expression of activated markers (CD25 and CD69) from CD4 + as well as CD8 + T cells in 72 h of MHV-3-infected Vsig4 −/− livers was similar to their WT controls ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). These results clearly demonstrate that Vsig4 deficiency exacerbates macrophage-mediated inflammation, which deteriorates MHV-3 virus-induced FH. VSIG4 attenuates LPS-induced macrophage activation in vitro. Our above data from in vivo experiments demonstrated that Vsig4 deficiency promotes macrophage-derived inflammation, we then investigated the role of VSIG4 in regulating macrophage activation in response to LPS in vitro. PEMs that are isolated from Vsig4 −/− mice appeared to present with an abrupt surge of M1-like proinflammatory gene transcripts, such as Il-1β and Tnf, at the very early stage (1 h and 6 h) of LPS exposure (Fig. 3a) . This was validated by the existence of higher levels of IL-1β, TNF, and IL-6 protein in the supernatants of LPS-stimulated Vsig4 −/− PEM cultures compared to the WT counterparts (Fig. 3b ). Western blot also confirmed these results (Fig. 3c ). In addition, surface expression of M1 activation markers, including B7-H1, B7-DC, B7-H3, and CD40, was higher in LPS-treated Vsig4 −/− PEMs (Fig. 3d) . These results suggest that VSIG4 is important for controlling macrophage activation. To avoid the cellular heterogeneity of conventional PEMs, we next chose a macrophage line, RAW264.7 cells, as a homogeneous model to examine the functional specificity of VSIG4. RAW264.7 cells are lack of Vsig4 transcription, but they with lentiviralmediated restoration of Vsig4 expression (Len-Vsig4) exhibited a reduction in LPS-induced M1 gene (Il1b, Il6, and Tnf) transcripts compared to the control counterparts (Fig. 3e) . Similarly, ELISA data also showed that the levels of TNF, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-12p40 protein in the supernatants of the LPS-treated VSIG4 + RAW264.7 cultures were significantly lower than the controls (Fig. 3f ). These VSIG4 + RAW264.7 cells were also incapable of mounting LPSinduced CD40 upregulation (Fig. 3g ). These combined data imply that VSIG4 inhibits LPS-induced macrophage activation in vitro. Previous work has shown that the complement C3b is the natural ligand of VSIG4 21 . To address whether VSIG4 regulates macrophage activation is dependent on C3b, we used lentiviral vectors to overexpress VSIG4 in C3 −/− BMDMs and subjected these cells to LPS treatment (2 μg/ml). ELISA showed that the secretion of IL-6 and IL-1β was still dramatically downregulated in VSIG4 + C3 −/− BMDMs than their controls (Fig. 3h) . These combined data suggest that VSIG4-mediated cytokine production in macrophages is C3b independent. VSIG4 reprograms pyruvate metabolism and mtROS generation. To investigate the molecular mechanisms for VSIG4mediated macrophage activation, we constructed a platform using VSIG4 + RAW264.7 cells to test the dependence of macrophage activation on VSIG4. Inspired by recent studies showing that cell metabolism has an important function in supporting macrophage activation and polarization 31 , we measured cell metabolism thereafter. Figure 4a shows that VSIG4 did not affect LPSinduced glucose uptake. However, it inhibited lactate, pyruvate and acelyl-CoA accumulation after 6 h of LPS administration. The mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in the macrophages was then investigated, although VSIG4 did not affect oxygen consumption under normal conditions (Supplementary Fig. 6a , b), it appeared to drastically downregulate oxygen consumption after LPS exposure, both in basal and (h) maximal OCR (Fig. 4b, c) , implying that VSIG4 inhibits mitochondrial oxidation during macrophage activation. It is believed that glucose oxidation via the mitochondrial electron transport chain is a major source of mtROS upon cells undergoing aerobic metabolism 32 . The fact that VSIG4 inhibited mitochondrial oxidation led us to investigate the status of mtROS, which can induce macrophage M1 activation through activating NF-κB and stabilizing HIF-1α 17 . Compared to the controls, flow cytometry showed that VSIG4 + RAW264.7 cells had a significantly less mtROS secretion, especially in response to LPS stimulation (Fig. 4d) . Conversely, LPS exposure caused increased mtROS secretion in Vsig4 −/− PEMs in vitro (Fig. 4e) . Moreover, both ATMs from Vsig4 −/− obese mice and PEMs isolated from MHV-3-infected Vsig4 −/− mice had higher levels of mtROS than their WT littermates (Fig. 4f) . Inhibition of mtROS production by using diphenyliodonium chloride (DPI) can efficiently block LPSinduced IL-6 secretion from both RAW246.7 and VSIG4 + RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 4g ). This implies that VSIG4 inhibits macrophage M1 activation mainly by reducing pyruvate oxidation and mtROS generation. The other important consequence of LPS-induced metabolic reprogramming in macrophages is the accumulation of succinate, a substrate that in turn stimulates HIF-1α-dependent IL-1β expression 13 . Nevertheless, LPS-induced succinate accumulation and HIF-1α upregulation in macrophages appear to be unaffected by the presence of VSIG4 ( Supplementary Fig. 7) , suggesting VSIG4-mediated macrophage activation is HIF-1α independent. VSIG4 enhances PDK2 expression in macrophages. The observation of VSIG4 inhibiting mitochondrial oxidation and mtROS secretion led us to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Regulation of pyruvate metabolism largely relies on PDH, whose activity is inhibited by PDKs via phosphorylation 33 . In examination of the 4 Pdk isoform expressions in BMDMs and we found that the Pdk2 mRNA and protein levels were significantly lower in Vsig4 −/− macrophages than that in their WT counterparts (Fig. 5a, b) . This low level of PDK2 was responsible for the appreciable decreases in phosphorylation of PDH (p-PDH-E1α S300 and p-PDH-E1α S293 ), as detected by western blot and immunofluoresence staining (Fig. 5b, c) . The absence of Vsig4 in Kupffer cells also resulted in PDK2 reduction and lower p-PDH-E1α S300 /E1α S293 levels in the liver tissues, both in uninfected and at 48 h of MHV-3-infected conditions (Fig. 5d ).
