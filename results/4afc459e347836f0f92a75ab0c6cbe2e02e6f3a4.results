Assigning nucleotide divergence thresholds in the VP1 region of HRV-A, -B and -C In order to determine whether a distinct threshold that divided pairwise p-distance comparisons in the VP1 region into intra-and inter-type values existed within each HRV species, distributions of pairwise nucleotide p-distances were constructed from a total of 435 HRV-A, 133 HRV-B and 206 HRV-C VP1 sequences ( Fig. 1 ; sequences used for species C represent an expanded dataset from the one analysed previously; Simmonds et al., 2010) . These showed a maximum within-species nucleotide p-distance of 39.4, 33.9 and 42.9 % for species A, B and C, respectively, and minimum values of between 10 and 14 % divergence. Detailed inspection allowed identification of minimum values in the distribution and assignment of a nucleotide divergence threshold for each species (Fig. 1 , right-hand panels). A threshold of 13 % was identified for both HRV-A and -C sequences, whilst the less-divergent HRV-B isolates showed a minimum value that supported a 12 % threshold. The total datasets of available VP1 sequences contained unequal representations of different types within each species, ranging from one to a maximum of 13 for HRV-A (A49), 10 for HRV-B (B69) and 22 for HRV-C (C3). Particularly for pairwise distance comparisons, these may potentially distort the shape of the distribution of inter-type distances because comparisons with certain types are overrepresented in the distance totals. An additional analysis was therefore carried out with only single sequences from each type (grey shading superimposed in Fig. 1 , left graphs). For each, prototype strains of HRV-A and -B were those of the first full-genome sequence of a deposited ATCC isolate that was deposited in GenBank (highlighted in red in Table S1 in JGV Online). Prototype strains of HRV-C were those listed previously  Table S1 ). This closely reproduced the analysis of the whole VP1 dataset in the shape and range of the inter-type distribution of distances ( Fig. 1) . Whilst distance distributions between VP1 sequences of HRV-A and -C showed a single peak, those of HRV-B showed a bimodal distribution. The peak between p-distance values of 0.19 and 0.26 corresponded to comparisons between HRV-B types within each of the four basally branching phylogenetic clusters (indicated by grey-outlined boxes in Fig. 2 ). The larger peak thus corresponded to comparisons between variants in different clusters.
