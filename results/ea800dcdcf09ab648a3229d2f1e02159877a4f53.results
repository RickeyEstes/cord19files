Of the 20 FOSCC samples, 12 (60%) were from the gingiva, 5 (25%) were from the tongue and the location of 3 (15%) samples was unknown. Sequence data for the 37 samples were deposited into the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under BioProject PRJNA553834. 3.1. The virome of the oral mucosa of cats consisted of foamy virus, torque teno virus, alphaherpesvirus, feline papillomavirus, FeLV, FIV and EBV but these viruses were not associated consistently with FOSCC FcaPV was found in 1/20 and 0/9 (p = 1.00, Fisher's exact test, 2tailed), feline foamy virus in 7/20 and 2/9 (p = 0.67), feline torque teno virus in 2/20 and 0/9 (p = 1.00), alphaherpesvirus in 2/20 and 0/ 9 (p = 1.00), FIV in 0/20 and 2/9, exogenous FeLV (exFeLV) in 0/20 and 1/9, Epstein-Barr virus in 1/20 and 0/9 (p = 1.00) respectively in FOSCC and normal oral mucosa samples (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1) . Probability values were not evaluated for FIV and FeLV since these viruses can be higher in the group of cats in the normal mucosa group that consisted of largely unowned cats that were euthanized for various reasons.
