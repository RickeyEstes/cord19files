Description of the medieval network. The studied network included information on 2084 trade and pilgrimage connections between 1311 Old World cities (including North Africa, Europe and Asia), with 1013 cities being connected by trading routes and 403 cities connected by pilgrimage routes, with some cities appearing in both trade and pilgrimage routes ( Fig. 1 ; Supplementary Table S1 ). Network density, measured as the ratio of the number of connections and the number of possible connections between all cities in the network, was lower than 1% in the three studied networks (Supplementary Table S1 ). The degree distribution of the network was better fitted to an exponential (R 2 = 0.991) than to a power-law (R 2 = 0.88) function ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Network transitivity was around 10% for the overall and the trade networks and only 5% for the pilgrimage network. In all cases, network transitivity was significantly higher than expected in a random network (Supplementary Table S1 ). The values of local transitivity were very similar to the global values (Overall network = 0.098 ± 0.006; Trade network = 0.063 ± 0.020; Pilgrimage network = 0.018 ± 0.017). However, most cities had transitivity values equal to zero ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ), indicating that they did not form closed triples. As for centrality, the mean city degree was 3.18 ± 0.06 for the overall network, indicating that as an average a city was connected to other three cities. Nevertheless, degree ranged between 1 and 19, with most cities having a degree between 1 and 5 ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). Mean degree was 2.49 ± 0.06 for the trade network and 0.69 ± 0.03 for the pilgrimage network. Closeness centrality shared the same pattern; most cities had very low values whereas some cities had high values (Supplementary Figs S3-S5). There were significant correlations between both centrality metrics in the three types of networks (p < 0.0001 in all cases, N = 1311 cities; Pearson product-moment correlation; Supplementary Table S2) , and these correlations were higher than the correlation expected in a network with the same degree distribution but randomly (Table S2 ). Local transitivity was positively correlated with closeness in the overall network (Supplementary Table S3 ) and negatively correlated with degree ( Supplementary Fig. S6 ).
