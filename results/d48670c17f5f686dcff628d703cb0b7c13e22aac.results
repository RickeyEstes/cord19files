One hundred and seventy-seven faecal samples of dogs with diarrhoea were examined. Of these, 115 samples that had showed the conventional fragment (409 bp) of the typical CCoV strain, were not amplified with the primer pair CCoV1a/ CCoV2. Instead, FCoV-like CCoVs were found in 62 faecal samples, generating a 239 bp fragment. All 62 specimens had been collected from dogs in two separate kennels, where periodical outbreaks of CCoV enteritis had been observed. The specificity of the PCR typing assay was confirmed by sequence analysis of the PCR products. As expected, the FIPV, FCoV type II 79-1683 and TGEV Purdue strains were amplified by the primer pair CCoV1/CCoV2, but they were not amplified by the PCR typing test with the primer pair CCoV1a/CCoV2.
