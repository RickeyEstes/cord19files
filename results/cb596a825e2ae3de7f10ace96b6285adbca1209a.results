LT producing ETEC was the commonest pathogen isolated from both children (21 %) and adults (260/0) with Salmonella species ranking a close second in the case of children (19%). The rate of isolation of salmonellas from adults (60/0) was much lower than from children. The isolation rate of Shigella species, C. jejuni, A. hydro phyla HOSPITAL STUDY OF DIARRHEA IN SINGAPORE 49 and P 1. shigelloides was low in both children and adults. Vibrio species were not isolated at all in the period under study. Only one EPEC infection was detected in an infant. Cl. difficile toxin was detected in stools of both children (1.7%) and adults (2.9%), and 5 of 6 C. jejuni isolates were from children. Rotavirus by LA was detected in 6.4% of children. The proportion of rotavirus infections detected by EM was 3.5%. Of the 3 specimens positive for rotavirus by LA which were also tested by EM, 2 were positive. Coronaviruses, Astroviruses, Caliciviruses, Norwalk virus like agents and other small round viruses were not detected in any of the samples examined by EM. Cryptosporidium oocysts were not detected in a single stool. The incidence of helminthic infestation too was very low. Trichuris Trichiura and Ancylostoma duodenale were detected in one adult each. Between July and November 1991, B. hominis was not detected in a single specimen by examining direct mounts of fecal emulsions. However, between November 1992 and January 1993, 20 of 460 (4.3%) specimens of diarrheal stool were found to contain B. hominis when subjected to microscopy after simple sedimentation. With reference to Table 2 , yeasts were detected in smears of diarrheal stools of 33% children and 59% adults as well as in 50% of non-diarrheal stools of controls. A significantly higher proportion of children (9%) and adults (22%) with diarrhea had counts of over 25 yeast cells per field in comparison with controls (2.3%) (p<0.005; Chi 2 ). In 14 of 21 (66%) of diarrheal stools from children and 33 of 38 (86%) diarrheal stools of adults with counts of over 25 yeasts per field, no other diarrheal pathogen was detected. These 14 children and 33 adults constitute 6% and 19% respectively of children and adults with diarrhea in the study. Fifty-seven stools positive for yeasts by smear (16 from children with diarrhea; 38 from adults with diarrhea and 3 from controls) were cultured and speciated. Children and adults showed a similar trend. With reference to Table 3 the 4 most frequently isolated species were C. albicans C. tropicalis, T. glabrata and C. parapsilosis. The rank order varied marginally when considering all isolates (column 5); isolates where yeasts were the only pathogen detected (column 6); and stools which contained over 25 yeasts per high power field (column 7).
