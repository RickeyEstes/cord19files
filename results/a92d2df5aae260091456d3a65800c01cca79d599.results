Nineteen patients in 20 admission encounters met criteria for being at risk for having PARDS, and in all 20 patient encounters the patient's parent consented to study participation. One patient (number 6) was excluded as the primary team caring for this patient believed that his multiple congenital anomalies contributed to his decompensation and intubation during an imaging study rather than an infection; however, six weeks later this patient www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ (number 14) was readmitted and the parents again consented to the study. Table 1 Change in phenotype of neutrophils after airway migration from the circulation. Using flow cytometry, we compared the expression of critical surface markers between blood and airway neutrophils in children with acute lower airway infections within 24 hours of endotracheal intubation. Representative flow cytometry histograms showing the heterogeneity of surface marker expression in airway and blood neutrophils are shown in Fig. 1A -D. Both L-selectin (CD62L) and CD16, the low affinity Fc gamma receptor for immunoglobulin G (IgG), which can mediate degranulation, phagocytosis, and oxidative burst, were shed upon airway migration. Cell surface expression of CD63, a marker of primary granule exocytosis, and CD66b, a marker of secondary granule exocytosis, were increased in the airway compared with blood neutrophils. Granule release by airway neutrophils was confirmed by the presence of significant activity of human neutrophil elastase (HNE), a protease contained within primary granules, and matrix metalloprotein 9 (MMP-9) protein levels, a protease contained within secretory granules, in the cell-free airway fluid compared with platelet-free plasma (Fig. 1E,F) . We further characterized differences in surface expression of integrins responsible for adhesion and activation of the neutrophil respiratory burst, complement/antigen presentation, and IL8 chemotaxis receptors in airway vs. blood neutrophils (Fig. 2) . CD11b (integrin alpha M) and CD11c (integrin alpha X) were increased, while CD49d (VLA-4Î±) and CD54 (ICAM-1) were decreased on airway compared to blood neutrophils. The antigen presenting receptor HLA-DR (major histocompatibility class II) was also increased in airway compared with blood neutrophils. CD35 (complement receptor 1) was decreased in airway compared to blood neutrophils, while CD88 (complement receptor 5) and CD32 (medium affinity IgG receptor, which mediates phagocytosis, oxidative burst, platelet aggregation and immunomodulation) were unchanged. Finally, both CD181 (CXCR1 or IL8RA) and CD182 (CXCR2 or IL8RB) receptors were decreased in the airway neutrophils compared to blood neutrophils. Human neutrophil elastase activity is increased in the airway fluid of children with bacterial respiratory co-infections. Neutrophil degranulation is associated with increased severity of lung disease due to infection. HNE activity increased with versus without airway bacterial coinfection (Fig. 3) . In addition to activity of HNE (Fig. 3A) , MPO levels, but neither lactoferrin nor MMP-9, were higher in ASN from children with bacterial coinfection in the airways than those without (Fig. 3B-D) . In vitro modeling of airway neutrophil conditioning in PARDS patients. In order to further characterize differences in neutrophils recruited to the airways of children with or without bacterial coinfections www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ following lower airway viral infections, we used ASN from children with lower airway viral infection collected within 24 hours of endotracheal intubation to show that this pathological milieu induces transepithelial migration of blood neutrophils in this in vitro model. Similar modulation of CD66b, CD63, CD16, and CD181 were observed between primary airway neutrophils from patients and donor neutrophils transmigrated into patient ASN compared to blood neutrophils (pre-transmigration) (Fig. 4A-D) . Although patient ASN had intrinsic HNE activity, there was no evidence for surface recapture of HNE in transmigrated neutrophils (Fig. 4E) . Unlike the in vivo patient data, CD88 (complement receptor 5a) was decreased in neutrophils transmigrated to ASN (Fig. 4F) , and HLA-DR was not different in neutrophils transmigrated to ASN (Fig. 4G) compared with blood neutrophils. In vivo, CXCR4 is a surface marker expressed on human neutrophils that plays a role in tissue retention [25] [26] [27] . www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Upon neutrophil transmigration in vitro, CXCR4 was upregulated compared to blood neutrophils (Fig. 4H) . Exploration of the Arg1 and PD-L1 axis demonstrated that Arg1 expression was increased on the cell surface of neutrophils transmigrated to ASN (Fig. 4I) . Neutrophils transmigrated into pooled Day 1 ASN from all patients had decreased PD-L1 surface expression compared to blood neutrophils (Fig. 4J) . However, we did not detect significant differences in Arg1 and PD-L1 expression on blood and airway neutrophils in vivo (data not shown). Experimental controls using negatively selected neutrophils rather than whole blood neutrophils (Fig. E3) and direct incubation of neutrophils with ASN compared with transmigration (Fig. E4 ) did not show significantly
