In order to evaluate the contribution of adaptive multiresolution method to the reconstruction process, the evaluation results were compared with sMAPEM, and the conventional methods, WBP and SIRT [20] . sMAPEM reconstructions were performed using the recommended parameters. In WBP reconstructions, a ramp filter and a Hamming filter with cutoff frequency 0.5 cycles/pixel were used. 50 iterations were used for the SIRT reconstructions. Positivity constraint was applied for WBP and SIRT reconstructions. All the methods were implemented in MATLAB.
