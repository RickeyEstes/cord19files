Direct pyrosequencing of RNA extracted from a blood plasma sample of a wild adult male red colobus from Kibale National Park, Uganda, generated 77,891 reads of 280 bp average length, consisting of 19,285 host reads (24.8%) and 58,606 non-host reads (75.2%). De novo assembly of singleton non-host reads resulted in a 15.5 kb contiguous sequence (contig) that aligned to the SHFV type strain LVR 42-0/M6941 (GenBank accession number NC_003092.1). A reference assembly against the 15.5 kb contig yielded 35,120 sequence reads with full coverage across the entire contig. Two additional contigs with lengths of 13 kb and 1.9 kb also aligned to the SHFV genome but were highly divergent from the initial 15.5 kb contig. The positions of these additional aligned contigs relative to the SHFV genome suggested that the two fragments might belong to the same viral variant. Using one step RT-PCR and 39 RACE, respectively, we were able to fill the gap between these two contigs and extend the 39 end of the contig to complete the terminal open reading frame (ORF9), yielding a new complete contig of 15.2 kb. A reference assembly against this 15.2 kb contig yielded 1,068 sequence reads with full coverage across the entire contig. Initial alignments indicated that both contigs covered all ORFs of the SHFV type strain and extended partially into the 39 and 59 untranslated regions. The 15.5 kb and the 15.2 kb contigs were designated SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2, respectively, to indicate their origins in Kibale red colobus and to reflect nomenclature previously used to describe novel simian retroviruses in this same population of red colobus [20] . Because we generated near full-length viral genome sequences, we were able to reconstruct the genomic architecture of SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 (Figure 1 ). SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 both possess two large putative replicase-encoding ORFs and several smaller downstream ORFs, all comparable in size to the published ORFs of type strain LVR 42-0/M6941 but all highly divergent at the amino acid level from the type strain (Table 1 ). Consistent with previously described arteriviruses, the putative ORF1a and ORF1b coding regions in both new SHFV variants contain a canonical heptanucleotide ''slippery sequence'' (UUUAAAC) and predicted downstream pseudoknot structure [7] . Importantly, both new viral genomes contain homologs of the type strain SHFV ORFs 2a, 2b, and 3 in the same genomic positions, indicating conservation of the unusual 39 genomic architecture of SHFV even among highly divergent variants. Across the coding genome, the SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 showed only 51.9% nucleotide identity with each other and only 52.0% and 51.8% nucleotide identity, respectively, with type strain LVR 42-0/M6941, which is roughly equivalent to the nucleotide percent identity between the prototypical PRRSV and LDV strains (51.1%; Table 2 ). A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree constructed from concatenated nucleotide sequence alignments of homologous ORFs from representative arteriviruses is shown in Figure 2 . The tree is consistent with established phylogenetic relationships among the arteriviruses [21, 22] , supporting with high statistical confidence the close relationship between PRRSV and LDV relative to SHFV and EAV. Within the SHFV clade, SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 are highly divergent from each other and from the type strain SHFV LVR 42-0/ M6941. Although SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 cluster together, statistical support for this relationship is relatively weak even with near-complete genome sequences. Overall, the degree of phylogenetic diversity within SHFV is remarkably high and is approximately equal to that between PRRSV and LDV.
