From the 98 candidate, consecutive examined children, 93 were recruited: 4 were unable to perform a correct FENO maneuver, and 1 was unable to perform spirometry with an FET of greater than 0.5 seconds. The mean age at recruitment was 4.5 6 0.4 years. At this time point, there were no significant differences in age, sex, height, and all baseline measurements between atopic children, nonatopic children, and children completing the study without any wheezing episodes. Regular follow-up visits occurred every 40 6 4 days. Forty-three of 93 children had at least 1 wheezing episode 0.6 6 0.3 years after recruitment. The episodes were equally distributed among seasons, except summer, whereas the available baseline measurements at different seasons were not significantly different when assessed in an individualized manner (data not shown). The baseline characteristics were similar between atopic and nonatopic children (Table I) . After the initial assessment at the beginning of the episode (day 0), the children were re-evaluated 10 6 1 days (day 10) and 30 6 3 days (day 30) later. Compliance was high for electronic PEF recordings both on regular daily measurements and during the wheezing episode (85% 6 9% and 95% 6 3%, respectively), as assessed indirectly from the PiKo-1. None of the children reported wheezing unrelated to apparent upper respiratory tract infections or lower respiratory symptoms. Four children (3 atopic) had episodes of short-lasting, self-limited mild upper respiratory tract symptoms without lower respiratory tract symptoms or wheezing.
