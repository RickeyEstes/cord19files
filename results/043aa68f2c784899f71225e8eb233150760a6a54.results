A total of 121,805 cases of pandemic influenza (H1N1-2009), distributed in all 31 provinces in mainland China, were reported from May 9, 2009, to December 31, 2009. There was much variation in the numbers of confirmed cases in different provinces, ranging from 881 to 12,748, with a median of 2,958 cases, and in the incidence of confirmed cases in different provinces, ranging from 3.94 per 100,000 population to 71.72 per 100,000, with a median of 8.41 per 100,000. From the time profile, we found that the number of confirmed cases increased rapidly beginning at the end of August, when a new term began for school students, and peaked by the end of November. The first death caused by pandemic influenza was reported on October 4, 2009. The number of deaths eventually rose to 648 by the end of the year, and peaked in early December (Figure 1 ). The age-and sex-standardized incidence map shows that the epidemic spanned a large geographic area, and the most affected areas were in western China (see Web Figure 1 , which appears on the Journal's website (http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/)). Significant differences in incidence were found among age groups, with incidences peaking in school-age groups (Web Figure 1 ). Boys showed a higher incidence than girls (ages <20 years). Web Figure 2 shows the trend of the spatial spread of pandemic influenza over time in mainland China and indicates that the epidemic areas during the first 120 days after May 9, 2009, were limited to the circumferences of cities with international airports, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chengdu, and Changchun. Thereafter, it spread to the rest of mainland China, roughly from southeast to northwest. The largest-scale spread took place 150-180 days after the first case (Web Figure 2) . Figure 2 shows the large variation in the temporal patterns of pandemic influenza for the 5 selected cities/provinces, but there was a marked drop in incidence during the first week of October for all locations. Survival analysis of the duration of time to the first confirmed case in each county indicated that all 4 factors related to domestic travel or human mobility were significantly associated with the invasion of pandemic influenza in the Cox univariate analysis (Table 1) . Population density and the density of medical facilities also showed a significant association. The significant effect of being intersected by railways disappeared, and the density of medical facilities showed borderline significance after correction for other factors in multivariate analysis, whereas being intersected by national highways and freeways and proximity to airports and higher population den-sity remained as significant factors, all showing a positive association (Table 1) . Table 2 shows that all climatic factors (except precipitation), school summer vacation and public holidays, proportion of the school-age population, population density, and the density of medical facilities were significantly associated with the extent of local transmission in univariate multilevel Poisson regression. School summer vacation and public holidays showed a significant negative association with the incidence of pandemic influenza. The significant effect of the proportion of schoolage children disappeared after correction for other factors; thus, temperature, relative humidity, school summer vacation and public holidays, population density, and the density of medical facilities remained as significant factors in multivariate analysis. Temperature showed a peak pattern, with the highest incidences for the range from 0°C to 10°C, which was also reflected in the statistically significant quadratic term.
