Although only 5 sites were examined, the intensity of the sampling yielded a total of 5,057 individuals from 21 species, resulting in a thorough species inventory over a gradient of diversity in small mammal ecological communities. Deer mice averaged 62% of all captures (Table 2) and were the dominant species at all sites. Mammal species diversity differed significantly among sites (p<0.001; Table  2 ), except sites 3 and 4 (p = 0.1). Densities varied spatially and temporally; all parks exhibited the highest densities during year 2 (Table 3) . Interannual variances of densities were large due to seasonal differences in capture rates, such that no statistical differences in densities were found either within or among parks. Infection prevalence also varied, although it remained consistently low at 4 of the 5 sites. During year 1, infection prevalence was significantly higher at site 1 than at sites 2 and 3 (p<0.001) but not different than at sites 4 and 5 (p = 0.20 and 0.32, respectively). Site 1 was the only site where infection prevalence significantly increased between years 1 and 2 (p = 0.005); thus, infection prevalence at this site was significantly higher than at any of the other parks during year 2 (p<0.001). High infection prevalence was maintained at site 1 during year 3. Although the rate for site 2 increased significantly between years 2 and 3 (p = 0.035), prevalence remained significantly higher at site 1 than at any other park during year 3 (p<0.01). Using nonlinear regression, we found a significant negative relationship between infection prevalence and mammal species diversity. Infection prevalence increased as diversity decreased, up to an inflection point where the rate of infection increased exponentially (Figure) . No regression model was able to account for the association between infection prevalence and density of deer mice, either alone or with species diversity in the model. A pairwise analysis of similarity was used to compare sites floristically; all parks differed significantly from each other (p<0.001). Stepwise backward logistic regression with binomial errors found no association between infection prevalence and any vegetative factors alone or in combination with other vegetative factors.
