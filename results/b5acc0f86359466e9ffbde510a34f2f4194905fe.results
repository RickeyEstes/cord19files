One hundred-forty three samples were obtained from 120 immunocompromised patients who underwent respiratory pathogen testing for symptoms of upper or lower respiratory tract infection. Patient and sample characteristics are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Conventional testing identified 27 samples (18.9%) with one pathogen each among 143 samples. The TAC assay identified 77 samples with one or more viral respiratory pathogens (53.8%). Detailed results are shown in Fig. 2 Table 3 . Almost one fifth of all included samples were positive for IA virus. The positivity rate was higher for NTS samples (63.9%) than for BAL samples (45.7%), but the difference was not statistically significant. For NTS samples only, the viral distribution at genus level was as follows: IA (27.8%), CMV (8.3%), rhinovirus (6.5%), RSV and coronavirus (5.5%) the most frequently encountered, followed by IB and hMPV (3.7%). Adenovirus and parainfluenza viruses were detected in only a limited number of samples (â‰¤3.0%). For BAL samples, less IA (14.3%), RSV and coronavirus (2.8%) were found but more CMV (11.4%), rhinovirus (8.6%) and IB (5.7%). Human MPV, adenovirus and PIV were not detected in BAL samples. In addition to the viral pathogens, the TAC assay identified 13 samples with P. jirovecii, 2 samples with Aspergillus species and 1 sample each with B. parapertussis, M. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila. When viral and non-viral pathogens were considered, more than one pathogen was detected in 17 samples (11.9%). Table 4 shows the combinations of these pathogens and Ct-values identified by TAC. Those most frequently involved in co-infections were CMV (n = 8), P. jirovecii (n = 7), rhinovirus (n = 5) and influenza A virus (n = 5).
