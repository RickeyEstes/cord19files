Broad-spectrum antiviral effects of CHLA and PUG CHLA and PUG were evaluated for their antiviral effects against a panel of enveloped viruses whose entry involves cellular surface GAGs (Table 1) . Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and adenovirus type 5 (ADV-5) were included for comparison. The 50% indices of cytotoxicity (CC 50 ) and effective antiviral concentrations (EC 50 ), as well as the selective index (SI = CC 50 /EC 50 ), were determined for each virus infection host cell system and are listed in Table 2 . As shown in Figure 2 , CHLA and PUG displayed broad-spectrum antiviral effects in a dosedependent manner. Both compounds exhibited significant inhibitory effect on enveloped viruses known to engage GAGs for infection, including HCMV, HCV, DENV-2, MV, and RSV, with their EC 50 < 35 μM and SI > 10 ( Table 2 ). Both tannins were especially effective against RSV with their EC 50 values being < 1 μM. The two compounds, however, displayed only limited efficacy (SI < 10) against infections by VSV and ADV-5. This is consistent with the fact that these viruses have previously been shown not to require GAGs for entry. VSV can infect GAG-deficient cells [22, 23, 50] , whereas HS-mediated entry is only important for ADV-5 in the absence of its primary receptor CAR (coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor) and can only be inhibited to a maximum of 50% by soluble heparin [51, 52] . For the remainder of the studies, we focused on the effects of the tannins against HCMV, HCV, DENV-2, MV, and RSV.
