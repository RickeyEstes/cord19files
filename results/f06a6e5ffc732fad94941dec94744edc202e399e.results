During the 16-year study period, 11,535 cats of known breed were examined at the NCSU-CVM. Cats examined included mixed breed cats (9511 cats) and 36 different purebreed varieties (2024 cats). Sixty cats (0.52%) had a final diagnosis of FIP; breed was known for all affected cats. Sex and reproductive status information was avail-able for 57 of the 60 FIP cats and 11,303 of the 11,475 non-FIP cats. Age information was available for 58 of the 60 FIP cats. Cats diagnosed with FIP included mixed breed cats (33 cats) and 13 different purebreeds (27 cats). Prevalence of FIP in the mixed breed cat population was 0.35% versus 1.3% in the purebreed cat population (Fig 1) . Purebreed cats were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with FIP than were mixed breed cats (OR 4.5, CI 2.7e7.5; P ! 0.001). Breeds with a prevalence of FIP significantly greater than mixed breed cats included the Abyssinian, Bengal, Birman, Himalayan, Ragdoll, and Rex (including Cornish and Devon varieties) breeds (Table 1 , Fig 2) . The prevalence of FIP in Burmese, Exotic Shorthair, Manx, Persian, Russian Blue, and Siamese cats was not significantly different from mixed breed cats. The two Havana Brown cats evaluated at the NCSU-VTH during the study period were both diagnosed with FIP, but this small number precluded statistical analysis. Twenty-three cat breeds had an FIP prevalence of zero. These included the Angora (11 cats evaluated during study period), Balinese (25 cats), Belgian (two cats), Bombay (four cats), British Blue (two cats), British Shorthair (three cats), Chartreux (four cats), Colorpoint Shorthair (one cat), Egyptian Mau (one cat), Japanese Bobtail (six cats), Korat (five cats), Maine Coon (151 cats), Maltese (two cats), Norwegian Forest Cat (five cats), Ocicat (16 cats), Ragamuffin (one cat), Scottish Fold (15 cats), Siberian (one cat), Snowshoe (two cats), Somali (three cats), Sphinx (one cat), Tonkinese (18 cats), and Turkish Van (two cats) breeds. Unfortunately, the low prevalence of FIP in the mixed breed cat population prevented determination of significance or relative risk in these purebreed cat varieties. Cats with FIP were significantly more likely to be sexually intact when compared to the general cat population, regardless of whether the cats were male or female (intact male versus castrated male, P ! 0.001; intact female versus spayed female, P Z 0.002; all intact cats versus all altered cats, P ! 0.001; prevalence of intact cats in the general population was 15.8%, versus 45.6% in the FIP population). Although more cats with FIP were male than female, the difference in prevalence was not statistically significant (P Z 0.425; 53.6% of the total cat population was male, versus 59.6% of the FIP population). At the time of last evaluation the median age of cats with FIP was 0.96 years (25th percentile 0.5 years, 75th percentile 2.0 years). Sixty-seven percent of cats with FIP were less than 2 years of age.
