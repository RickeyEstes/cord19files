Coronaviruses detected from all respiratory specimens during the study period is summarized in Table 1 . Of these, 832 originated from adult patients (>18 years) with 35 (4.2%) screening positive for CoVs. Thirteen (1.6%) samples tested positive for CoV-HKU1 and represented 37% of all CoV species detected among adults. Median age of adult patients was 52 years (range, 23 to 79 years). Eleven CoV-HKU1-positive adults (85%) had an underlying respiratory comorbidity, predominantly history of smoking, with 6 (46%) being current smokers (Table 2) . Five patients (38%) reported use of inhaled corticosteroids. One patient was on systemic immunosuppression (prednisone, azathioprine). In addition, 2 patients had underlying gastrointestinal comorbid conditions. All adults with CoV-HKU1 infection had respiratory symptoms ( Table 3 ). Shortness of breath was the most common respiratory complaint (77%) followed by cough (62%) and rhinorrhea (54%). However, fever, wheezing, and chest pain were less common (38%, 23%, and 15%, respectively). Upper or lower gastrointestinal symptoms were reported in 5 (38%) adults. Other symptoms included myalgias (31%) and sore throat (23%). Seven patients (54%) required hospital admission, 5 (71%) of whom were diagnosed with pneumonia by the on-service team. Among hospitalized adults, 2 (29%) were admitted to the ICU. Both patients were male. Three patients (23%) were diagnosed with sepsis, 1 of whom developed septic shock and died. This individual had a history of smoking (64-pack years) and COPD. Another individual admitted to the ICU developed pancreatitis, pericarditis, peritonitis, and altered mental status during hospitalization and recovered. All blood, urine, and sputum cultures from these individuals were negative for other bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. Laboratory findings (Table 3) were obtained in 9 (69%) of the CoV-HKU1 adults. Of these, leukocytosis (white blood cell count [WBC] >11 000 cells/µL) was observed in 5 (56%), with an average of 29 600 cells/µL (range, 13 600-49 700 cells/µL). Of these, neutrophilic predominance (neutrophil count >8000 cells/µL) was seen in 4 (80%) and bandemia (>10% bands) was seen in 2 (40%). One (8%) adult had leukopenia (WBC of 3700 cells/µL). Twelve (92%) adults had chest radiography performed with 6 (50%) showing infiltrative disease. The chest imaging findings included prominence of interstitial markings with a reticulonodular pattern, ground-glass opacities, patchy consolidation, interlobular and intralobular septal thickening, basilar atelectasis, small pleural effusions, and hyperinflated lungs ( Figure 2 ). Eight (62%) received antibiotics, and 2 (15%) received oseltamivir, despite identification of CoV-HKU1 as the Table 1 Eighty-three percent of all CoV-HKU1-positive samples occurred within a 4-week period between February 7 and March 5 ( Figure 1 ). This period included 10 (67%) of the adult cases. Coronaviruses OC43 and NL63 had a more prolonged circulation but also predominated during these same 4 weeks.
