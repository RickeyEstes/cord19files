Bovine plasma used in the studies was negative for viral contamination or neutralizing antibodies against tested viruses (PRV, PRRSV, PEDV, CSFV, SIV, SVA, SVDV, PPV and PCV-2). In addition, porcine plasma was free from BVDV and BVDV antibodies. The results of UV-C viral inactivation are summarized in Table 2 and in Figs 1, 2 and 3. In general, all enveloped viruses tested were inactivated at <3000 J/L and showed non-linear inactivation kinetics, biphasic or Weibull distributions, with low RMSE values resulting in 4D values under 3000 J/L (Figs 1 and 2 and Table 2 ). The two best non-linear inactivation kinetics with the smallest RMSE are included in Table 2 . Greater ranges of stability were found for non-enveloped viruses. PPV was inactivated at <3000 J/L, but other non-enveloped viruses such as SVA, SVDV and PCV-2 required a greater UV-C dose to be inactivated ( Table 2 ; Fig 3) . For example, all three samples of SVDV at 6000 J/L were negative by the microtiter assay. However, the subsequent 3 blind passages performed for each 6000 J/L sample were positive. Afterwards, a titration of 25 mL was done by duplicate, obtaining one positive out of 960 wells, so, it was concluded that there were 0.02 particles/mL (0.014 TCID50%) in the 6000 J/L samples (1 particle/50 mL assayed volume). To further confirm the dose required to inactivate SVDV, three additional blind passages were performed for the three samples irradiated at 9000 J/L, and one was found positive. Titration of the original sample of 9000 J/L (25 mL) was done; one out of 480 inoculated wells was positive. It was calculated that 0.04 particles per milliliter (0.028 TCID50%) were still present in the only positive sample of 9000 J/L (1 particle / 25 mL assayed volume). The most resistant virus was PCV-2, since the total log10 reduction achieved was 2.71 log10 at 9000 J/L.
