The capacity of T-2-treated mice to modulate reovirus intestinal infection was initially assessed by plaque-forming assay. Mice that received vehicle alone and then infected with reovirus 2 h later contained approximately 10 4 PFU/intestine at 5 days with less than 10 1 PFU/intestine by 10 days (Fig. 1) . However, mice treated i.p. 2 h prior to infection with T-2 (1.75 mg/kg bw) contained 6-and 500-fold more reovirus per intestine at 5 and 10 days, respectively (P b 0.05). Virus was undetectable in spleens of untreated or T-2-treated reovirusinfected mice (data not shown). The results suggest that T-2 increased the intestinal reovirus burden and prevented its completed clearance during the interval studied; however, the toxin did not facilitate breaching of the virus into the systemic compartment. Reovirus is shed in feces during intestinal infection and thus can be continuously monitored by real-time PCR of the L2 gene . In control mice exposed to reovirus, approximately 100 to 200 copies of L2 RNA/g feces were detectable at 1 and 3 days (Fig. 2) . The marker was undetectable at 5 and 7 days which is consistent with its clearance from intestinal tissue by 10 days. However, in T-2-treated mice, fecal L2 RNA copy numbers at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days were approximately 10 2 -, 10 5 -, 10 3 -, and 10 1 -fold greater than control mice (P b 0.05). Thus, T-2 increased both the amount of fecal reovirus and duration of its shedding. The dose response effects of T-2 were assessed using fecal L2 RNA copy number at 4 days. T-2 potentiated L-2 expression in a dose-dependent manner with as low as 50 μg/kg of the toxin causing significant potentiation (P b 0.05) (Fig. 3) . L2 RNA copy number reached a plateau at 0.5 mg/kg T-2 and did not differ from 1 or 2 mg/kg (P N 0.05). Reovirus induces a specific mucosal IgA response which likely contributes to clearance of the virus from the gut (London et al., 1987; Silvey et al., 2001) . To assess mucosal IgA responses, reovirus-specific IgA in feces was compared over the 10 days course of infection in vehicle-and T-2-treated mice. Increased reovirus-specific IgA was detectable 6, 8, and 10 days after reovirus infection in vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 4) . Induction of reovirus-specific IgA was significantly suppressed at 6 and 8 days in feces from T-2-treated mice (P b 0.05). Impaired IgA responses corresponded to suppression of reovirus-specific IgA secretion in fragment cultures of LP (Fig. 5A) and PP (Fig. 5B ) obtained from T-2-treated mice 5 days after infection (P b 0.05). Fig. 5 . Ex vivo production of reovirus-specific IgA is suppressed in lamina propria (LP) and Peyer's patch (PP) cultures from T-2-treated mice. Mice were treated with 0 or 1.75 mg/kg of T-2 i.p. and then 2 h later infected with 3 × 10 7 PFU of reovirus. LP and PP fragment cultures were incubated for 5 days without additional stimulation. Reovirus-specific IgA in cultured supernatants was determined by ELISA. Data are means ± SEM (n = 9). Bars marked with asterisk are significantly different from corresponding reovirus-infected group treated with vehicle at same time point (P b 0.05). Fig. 6 . T-2 suppresses reovirus-specific IgA and IgG 2a response in serum. Mice were treated with 0 or 1.75 mg/kg of T-2 and then 2 h later orally infected with 3 × 10 7 PFU of reovirus. Five and ten days after infection, serum IgA and IgG 2a titers were determined by ELISA. Data are means ± SEM (n = 9). Bars marked with an asterisk are significantly different from corresponding reovirus-infected group treated with vehicle at same time point (P b 0.05). T-2 significantly attenuated induction of reovirus-specific IgA in serum after 5 days but not after 10 days (P b 0.05) (Fig.  6A ), suggesting that a corresponding and transient impact on the systemic humoral IgA response occurred. Similarly, the reovirus-specific IgG 2A titer in serum from infected T-2-treated mice was 100 times less than that of infected vehicle controls at 5 days (Fig. 6B) . IgG 2A responses were also inhibited in tissue fragment cultures of spleen and PP from infected, T-2treated mice at 5 days (P b 0.05) (Fig. 7) . Reovirus-specific IgG 2A was not detectable in fecal pellets and LP tissue cultures (data not shown). DON has been previously shown to skew the cytokine responses to reovirus infection in PP from Th1 to Th2 . The effects of T-2 and reovirus on expression of Th1 (IFN-γ and IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10) cytokine mRNAs in PP were therefore assessed over 7 days. Treatment with T-2 for 2 h without reovirus initially elevated IFN-γ ( Fig.  8A ) but suppressed IL-2 ( Fig. 8B ) mRNA levels. Reovirus markedly induced IFN-γ mRNA expression from 3 to 7 days but this was suppressed by T-2 (Fig. 8A) . Reovirus also caused decreases in IL-2 (Fig. 8B ) and IL-4 ( Fig. 9A ) mRNA which were not impacted by T-2. IL-6 mRNA was initially elevated by treatment with T-2 for 2 h without reovirus but did not differ from vehicle-treated controls during the course of reovirus infection (Fig. 9B) . Reovirus caused decreases in IL-10 mRNA but this effect was abrogated by T-2 treatment (Fig. 8C) . Thus, the primary effects of T-2 on cytokine gene expression in the PP were attenuation of reovirus-induced IFN-γ and interference with reovirus suppression of IL-10.
