Deduced amino acid sequence of the matrix protein Seven clones, C4, E2, F5, FT35, FT36, FT43, and FT44, mapping in the positions illustrated in Fig. 1 , were sequenced in part to extend the TGEV genomic sequence that was known from clones FG5 and 121 (Kapke and Brian, 1986) . Clone FG5 maps at the extreme 3' end of the genome and contains the sequence for the hypothetical hydrophobic protein gene, the N gene, and part of the M gene. Identification of the third open reading frame as the M gene sequence was based on regions of extensive amino acid homology with the M proteins of MHV (Armstrong et a/., 1984) and IBV (Boursnell et al., 1984) . The sequencing strategy we used is described in Fig. 1 . The molecular weight of the glycosylated M protein has been estimated from electrophoretic migration patterns to be approximately 28 to 30 kDa (Brian et a/., 1983; Garwes and Pocock, 1975; Wesley and Woods, 1986) . We therefore anticipated that we would be able to deduce from the gene sequence a molecular weight of 28 kDa or less for the unglycosylated protein. and Brian, 1986) yielded a protein of 289 amino acids (Armstrong et al., 1984; Tooze et al., 1984) and bovine having a molecular weight of greater than 32,000 (Fig. coronavirus (Lapps ef al., 1987) We hypothesized that this is unlikely, however, based on the documented evidence for leader-primed transcription in coronavirus replication (Makino et a/., 1986b), and on the existence of a primer binding-like intergenic sequence early in the open reading frame. The most probable site for initiation of transcription of the M message is suggested by the sequence CTAAAC beginning at base 128 in Fig. 2 , which is part of a conserved intergenic sequence in the TGEV genome. It is a sequence found in total and again in part between the M and N genes beginning at base 926 in Fig. 2 , and also between the N and hypothetical hydrophobic protein genes (Kapke and Brian, 1986). It is also part of the intergenic sequence found in the MHV genome (Budzilowicz et al., 1985) . If CTAAAC functions as part of an intergenic sequence that directs leader-primed synthesis and thereby defines the start of the M transcript for TGEV, then the M protein coding sequence could start with the first available methionine 3'-ward of the CTAAAC sequence, a codon that begins at base 137 in Fig. 2 . It could also start with the second, downstream, in-frame AUG codon beginning at base 200, but this is surrounded by a much less favorable Kozak consensus sequence (Kozak, 1983) . To test our hypothesis, we prepared transcripts identical to the postulated functional mRNA structure (transcripts from the reconstructed full-length M gene, construct pGEM-M-1, that would initiate translation at the first AUG downstream from the CTAAAC sequence) and compared sizes of the resulting translation products with those of mRNA isolated from infected cells. Figure 3A, lanes 2 and 5, M protein translated in vitro from cell-derived, poly(A)selected mRNA and immunoprecipitated with TGEVspecific antibody had an electrophoretically determined molecular weight of 25K and comigrated with protein translated from the reconstructed full-length M gene. Protein translated from the reconstructed fulllength M gene immunoprecipitated with the same antibody thus confirming its authenticity (Fig. 3A, lane 8) . Furthermore, truncated M protein (generated from construct pGEM-M-2), although also antigenically authentic, migrated distinctly faster than full-length M but with a migration rate much less than expected for a 2-kDa molecular weight difference (Fig. 3A, lanes 9  and 12) . The small difference in electrophoretic mobility between the two forms of M again is an ostensible function of the hydrophobic nature of the protein. The electrophoretically determined molecular weight of the truncated M polypeptide is 24.5K. Judging from the size of the various translation products, it is unlikely that initiation of translation in vivo starts at any place other than at the first AUG downstream from the CTAAAC intergenic sequence. When the first methionine codon downstream from the CTAAAC sequence is used as the initiation site for translation, the deduced M protein comprises 262 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 29,544. It is moderately hydrophobic with 44% of its amino acids being hydrophobic, and is basic since it carries a net charge of +7 at neutral pH. A potentially cleavable amino-terminal signal peptide is not an absolute requirement for membrane translocation and glycosylation A comparison of the amino acid sequence for the M proteins of TGEV, BCV, MHV, and IBV (Fig. 4) several features that are shared among all four viruses, but also one feature for TGEV that is strikingly contrasting. Regions of high sequence homology are found among the proteins. Most notable is a stretch of 8 amino acids beginning at position 132 on the TGEV sequence that is identical for all four viruses. By computer analysis using a protein alignment function, 34, 32, and 19% of the TGEV protein sequence is homologous with that of BCV, MHV, and IBV, respectively. Furthermore, a hydrophobicity plot of the TGEV M protein shows three internal hydrophobic domains that align with similar domains in BCV, MHV, and IBV ( Fig. 4 and data not shown; Rottier et al., 1984; 1986) , BCV (Lapps et al., 1987) and IBV (Boursnell et al,, 1984) . This suggests that the topology of the four proteins is similar; that is, from its entrance into the virion membrane and as it extends toward the carboxy terminus, the protein spans the membrane three times and has a relatively hydrophilic intravirion carboxy-terminal region (Rottier et al,, 1984 (Rottier et al,, , 1986 . The striking feature of the TGEV M protein is its much longer amino terminus that includes a sequence resembling a cleavable peptide for membrane insertion. Assuming a parallel structure for the M proteins of the four viruses and assuming the MHV M protein enters the virion envelope at position 26 (Rottier et a/., 1986) then the external amino-terminal portion is 28 amino acids for BCV, 21 for IBV, and 54 for TGEV. Within the first 54 amino acids there is one asparagine at position 32 that has the appropriate surrounding sequence required for N-linked glycosylation (Hubbard and Ivatt, 1981) the kind of glycosylation shown for the TGEV M protein (Jacobs et a/., 1986). Unlike the amino terminus of the MHV, BCV, and IBV proteins, the TGEV M protein is hydrophobic for the first 16 amino acids. Eleven of the sixteen terminal amino acids are hydrophobic, and amino acids at positions 2, 17, and 18 are charged (Fig. 4) . By inspection, this sequence has the properties of a cleavable amino-terminal signal peptide and from the "-3, -1" rule (von Heijne, 1986) peptidase cleavage would occur between amino acids 16 and 17. Since an amino-terminal peptide is not required for membrane translocation and glycosylation of the M proteins of BCV, MHV, and IBV, we examined what effect the peptide had on the translocation of the TGEV M protein. Both forms of the reconstructed M gene generate the asparagine glycosylation site when translated, pGEM-M-1 at amino acid position number 32 and pGEM-M-2 at amino acid position number 11 of their respective translation products (Fig. 4) . Both forms of transcripts were therefore translated in the presence of microsomes known to have glycosylating activity. Figures 3A, lanes 5, 6, 9, and 10, 3B, lanes 1,  2, 3, and 4, and 3C, lanes 1, 2, 3, and 4 , illustrate that, whereas the full-length reconstructed M gene (1 st AUG) yielded a 25-kDa protein that was mostly glycosylated, 65-880~ as determined from optical density tracings, the truncated M gene (2nd AUG) yielded a protein that was also glycosylated but to a far lesser extent, only lo-30%. The glycosylated products of both the 1st AUG and 2nd AUG transcripts were approximately 28 kDa (Fig. 3A, lanes 6 and 1 O) , the same size as the glycosylated product from viral mRNA translation (Fig 3A, lane 3) and glycosylated virion M (Fig. 3A, lanes 16 and 17) . Glycosylation was confirmed to have taken place since the products from in vitro translation migrated again with the unglycosylated polypeptides after they had been digested with AI-glycanase (Fig. 3A, lanes 7 and 11) or endoglycosidase H (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6) . These results demonstrate that although the asparagine glycosylation site of both the full-length and truncated forms of M protein became translocated to the lumenal side of the microsome, translocation with the amino-terminal peptide present was far more efficient. Furthermore, translocation of the amino terminus appeared to be specifically enhanced by the peptide since carbonate treatment showed both full-length and truncated forms of the protein as a whole to be equally membrane embedded (Fig. 3C, lanes 5, 6,7, and 8) presumably as a result of internal translocation signals of the kind described for the MHV and IBV M proteins (Rottier et al., 1985; Machamer and Rose, 1987) . Following carbonate treatment greater than 85% of both the full-length and truncated forms of the M protein remained membrane bound as determined by optical density tracing of the autoradiogram. Cleavage of the amino-terminal peptide did not appear to occur during in vitro translation To test for amino-terminal peptide cleavage, viral mRNA from infected cells and transcripts of the cloned M gene were translated in the presence of microsomes known to contain signal peptidase activity (Fig.  3D ). In initial experiments, a tripeptide serving as a competitive inhibitor of asparagine-linked glycosylation (Lau et a/., 1983) was incubated with the microsomal-translation mixture in order to inhibit concurrent glycosylation that would otherwise obscure the results of peptide cleavage. Although inhibition of glycosylation was never complete, at no time was there evidence of peptide cleavage (data not shown). To use a second approach, mRNA and transcripts were translated in the presence of microsomes and the products were deglycosylated with either /V-glycanase or endoglycosidase H, and sizes were compared by electrophoresis (Figs. 3A, lanes 4, 7, and 11, and 36, lanes 5 and 6) . Interestingly, the sizes of the deglycosylated products, as described above, appeared to be no smaller than the polypeptides synthesized without microsomes. There appeared, therefore, to be no amino-terminal peptide removal during in vitro translation in the presence of microsomes. Results of experiments to determine whether the N-terminal peptide is cleaved in vivo suggest that cleavage in vivo may be dependent upon the glycosylation of M or other glycoproteins. When infected cells were incubated in the presence of tunicamycin and radiolabeled M was immunoprecipitated from cell lysate using monoclonal antibody, only one major band was found and it migrated as an uncleaved protein of 25 kDa (Fig. 3A, lane 14) . Similar results were obtained when polyclonal hyperimmune TGEV serum was used (data not shown). On the other hand, in the absence of tunicamycin, two forms of M were precipitated. These were a 28-kDa species, the size of fully glycosylated M, and a 24.5-kDa species, the size of M from which the N-terminal signal had been removed (Fig. 3A , lane 13). Glycosylation in vivo may have important consequences on the exposure of the peptidase cleavage site because of interactions between M and other viral components in vivo. In light of a recent report demonstrating by aminoterminal amino acid sequencing that the virion form of TGEV M protein is indeed cleaved (Laude et a/,, 1987) we included deglycosylated, radiolabeled virion M in our electrophoretic analysis (Fig. 3A, lane 15) . The deglycosylated virion M did not migrate as a cleaved polypeptide but rather migrated with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 26 kDa suggesting that it had perhaps undergone a second as yet undetermined modification after becoming virion-associated.
