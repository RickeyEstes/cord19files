Thirty healthy individuals were enrolled between January 20, 2015 and March 11, 2015 with the last subject visit occurring on September 21, 2015 (Fig. 1) . Demographic characteristics were similar between groups (Supplemental Table 1 ). There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events and the vaccines were well tolerated. When present, reactogenicity was mild to moderate in severity (Supplemental Tables 2A and 2B) . All subjects had HAI titers<1:10 at baseline to two related antigenic strains of H7N9, A/Anhui/1/2013 and A/Shanghai/2/ 2013, consistent with an H7 naive population at baseline (Fig. S1 ). H7-specific antibody responses were assessed at week 18 (2 weeks following the 16 week H7N9 MIV boost). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc t-test indicated statistically significant differences in HAI titer across the three groups at week 18 (p = 0.03 for the Anhui antigen and p = 0.02 for the Shanghui antigen). The magnitude and frequency of HAI responses was greater in group 1 (DNA prime-MIV boost) and group 2 (DNA/MIV prime-MIV boost) than in group 3 (MIV prime-MIV boost), indicating H7 DNA primed for a better HAI response than H7N9 MIV (Fig. 2 , Table 1 ). Two weeks following the boost, peak GMT were higher in those receiving H7 DNA prime (groups 1 and 2) rather than H7N9 MIV prime alone (group 3), and this difference reached significance between groups 1 and 3 (33.8 vs. 8.3, p = 0.02) for the Anhui antigen and between groups 1 and 3 (24.6 vs. 5.8, p = .01) and groups 2 and 3 (14.7 vs. 5.8, p = 0.03) for the Shanghai antigen (Fig. 2) . While higher titers were observed in group 1 compared to group 2, this difference was not significant for either antigen. Five of 10 individuals in group 1 achieved a positive response titer of ≥1:40 to either the Anhui or Shanghai antigen at 2 weeks post-boost while 3 of 9 individuals in group 2 and 1 of 9 individuals in group 3 achieved a positive HAI response ≥1:40 (Table 1 ). In all groups, peak HAI GMT was detected 2 weeks post-boost (Fig. 2 , Table 1 ). In group 3 (MIV prime-MIV boost), peak HAI GMT was maintained until 12 weeks post-boost, although the titer was lower than both groups 1 and 2 ( Fig. S1 ). Neutralizing antibody responses 2 weeks post-boost (week 18) were significantly different across the three groups based on oneway ANOVA (p = 0.01). Although the responses were similar between groups 1 and 2 ( Fig. 3 , Table 2 ), peak GMT were significantly greater for groups receiving the DNA prime, group 1 (440.6, p < 0.05) and group 2 (331.0, p = 0.02) when compared with Group 3 (86.1). A positive neutralizing antibody response was defined as a fourfold increase from baseline. Two weeks following the boost 90% of group 1, 100% of group 2, and 78% of group 3 achieved a positive neutralizing antibody response (Table 2 ) by this definition. Two weeks following the boost, the highest neutralizing antibody responses were identified in subjects who also achieved HAI titers ≥40. In the above analyses on the magnitude of response, comparisons between two groups were based on two-sample ttests on the log transformed data.Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were also performed, and they led to the same conclusions.
