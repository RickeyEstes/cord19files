A Wealth of Data Related to Coronaviruses Is Available in the IEDB Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviradae, order Nidovirales, and can be further subdivided into four main genera (Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronaviruses). Several Alpha-and Betacoronaviruses cause mild respiratory infections and common cold symptoms in humans, whereas others are zoonotic and infect birds, pigs, bats, and other animals. In addition to SARS-CoV-2, two other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, caused large disease outbreaks that had high (10%-30%) lethality rates and widespread societal impact upon emergence (Figure 1 ) (de Wit et al., 2016; Song et al., 2019) . The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in humans awaits characterization, but human immune responses against other coronaviruses have been investigated. As of January 27, 2020, the IEDB has curated 581 linear, and 81 as discontinuous, B cell epitopes that have been reported in the peerreviewed literature. In addition, 320 peptides have been reported as T cell epitopes (Table 1 ). The vast majority of these epitopes are derived from Betacoronavirues, and more specifically from SARS-CoV, which alone accounts for over 60% of them. In terms of the host in which the various B and T cell epitopes were recognized (Table 2) , most epitopes (either B or T) were defined in humans or murine systems. Notably, all but 2 of the 417 B and T cell epitopes described in humans are from Betacoronaviruses, with 398 of them coming from SARS-CoV.
