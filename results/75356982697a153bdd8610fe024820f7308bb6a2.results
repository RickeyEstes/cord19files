Demographic characteristics of the participants. The cells are obtained from 64 participants, including 34 ESRD patients (14 men and 20 women; median age 59.7 years) and 30 healthy controls (12 men and 18 women; median age, 58.8 years). Among the ESRD affected participants, hypertension (61.7%) was the most common comorbidity, followed by type 2 diabetes mellitus (41.2%). None of the participants in control group have underlying medical condition. All participants tested negative for dengue virus-specific immunoglobulins IgM and IgG antibodies, as determined by dengue blot detection kit 22 . Immune profiles in overall ESRD affected participants and controls. Figure 1 Immune profiles in ESRD affected participants without diabetes. Beyond viral factor, the current evidence shown diabetes is a potentially important co-factor that affects the outcome of dengue infection 29 . To eliminate the impact of diabetes in production of immune mediators in ESRD patients, subgroup analysis was performed between ESRD participants without diabetes (n = 19) and control group (n = 30) (Fig. 2) . At 6 h post-infection, IL-2 and GM-CSF were detected at higher concentrations, but there was a significant reduction of stimulated mononuclear cell production of IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-α, MCP-1, and MIP-1b in ESRD without diabetes group than in control group. At 24 h, 48 h and 72 h post-infection, the levels of IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-α, MCP-1, and MIP-1b were still low in ESRD without diabetes group than in the control group. In addition, significantly lower concentration of VEGF was observed at 48 h post-infection in ESRD without diabetes group in comparison to controls.
