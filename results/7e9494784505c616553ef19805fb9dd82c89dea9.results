Additional file 1 shows patient characteristics by region and the associated crude CFRs. Patients in Hong Kong were on average older (mean = 43.5 years) than those in Beijing (34.7 years) but younger than those in Taiwan (47.2 years). Case fatality was consistently and strongly age-dependent. Approximately one-third of Taiwan SARS patients had pre-existing comorbid conditions, which was much greater than Hong Kong (20%) and Beijing (4%, based on available data), and in each region the CFRs were markedly elevated for those patients with comorbidities. Overall, the crude CFRs differed substantially across regions (Additional file 1). After standardizing for age and sex, the case fatality ratios converged somewhat, suggesting that some of the crude differences were due to the different patient demographic profiles particularly in patients' ages between the three regions. Additional file 1 also displays the adjusted odds ratios of death for each predictor based on data from each region. The adjusted results confirm that older age, non-HCWs, presence of pre-existing comorbid conditions and admission before symptom onset were strongly associated with mortality. In the combined model (Additional file 2), the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of case fatality for Beijing and Taiwan were 0.18 (0.11 to 0.29) and 1.64 (1.29 to 2.07) compared to Hong Kong. When the XTS Hospital patients were excluded, the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of case fatality for Beijing was 0.98 (0.46 to 2.09) compared to Hong Kong. We also fitted a logistic regression analysis to test for any differential effects of sex, age, health care worker status, pre-existing comorbid conditions and nosocomial acquisition between Hospital 302 and XTS Hospital. All the firstorder interaction effects were found to be insignificant. All main and interaction effects with residence in Amoy Garden were also found to be insignificant. Data on exposure and onset times were available for 168 patients in Hong Kong, 97 patients in Beijing and 210 patients in Taiwan. Fitted lognormal distributions showed good fit compared to non-parametric estimates of the incubation distribution ( Figure 1 ). Based on the lognormal distributions, the estimated means (standard deviations) of the incubation distributions were 4.4 days (4.6 days) in Hong Kong, 5.7 days (9.7 days) in Beijing and 6.9 (6.1 days) in Taiwan. The 25, 50, 75 and 95 th percentiles were 2, 3, 5 and 12 days in Hong Kong, 1, 3, 6 and 20 days in Beijing and 3, 5, 9 and 18 days in Taiwan. Figure 2A shows the epidemic curve in each region, supplemented with the overall epidemic curve in Beijing [15] . The epidemic in Hong Kong occurred mainly in late March and early April 2003, preceding the outbreaks in Beijing and Taiwan by approximately one month. Figure 2B , C and 2D show box plots of the time from onset to admission during different calendar time periods and the overall distributions of onset-to-admission intervals. Within each region, the onset-to-admission times decreased throughout the main part of all three epidemics, while onset-to-admission times appeared to increase towards the end of the Hong Kong epidemic. Excluding the patients admitted before symptom onset, the mean delay from onset to admission were 3.6, 2.7 and 2.8 days respectively for Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan. A relatively large proportion of patients were admitted to hospital within one day after symptom onset in both Beijing and Taiwan, and Taiwan had a higher proportion of patients admitted before symptom onset. In Hong Kong and Taiwan, patients admitted before symptom onset had a much higher CFR (53% and 70% respectively, see Additional files 3 and 4). Hong Kong and Taiwan showed a decreasing gradient with prolonged delay from first symptoms to hospitalization until about one week whereas the opposite appeared to be the case in Beijing. Within Beijing, there was a clear difference in both onset-to-admission distributions and CFRs among hospitals although the trends were mostly consistent (see Additional file 4). The median onset-to-death periods in Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan were 21, 24 and 10 days respectively, while the median onset-to-discharge periods were 23, 36 and 19 days respectively. We also examined factors affecting the length of these periods (see Additional file 5). Patients in the youngest age group and those who had acquired SARS nosocomially had significantly shorter onset-to-death periods, while non-health care workers and those with pre-existing comorbid conditions had marginally shorter onset-to-death periods. When comparing across the three regions, Hong Kong and Beijing patients had similar onset-to-death periods, but those of patients in Taiwan were significantly shorter. As a sensitivity analysis, we show the factors affecting onset-to-death and onset-to-discharge excluding data from XTS Hospital (see Additional file 6). Regarding the onset-to-discharge period, younger patients were found to have shorter lengths of stay in hospital on average. We found statistically significant interaction effects between HCW status and location and between pre-existing comorbid conditions and location, where HCWs in Taiwan had longer onset-to-discharge periods (acceleration factor = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.17, 1.55), while those with pre-existing comorbid conditions in Taiwan had shorter periods (acceleration factor = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.75, 1.02). After adjustment for the above factors, Beijing had a significantly longer onset-to-discharge period comparing with Hong Kong, while Taiwan had a significantly shorter period. Figure 3 summarizes symptoms at the time of presentation in Hong Kong, Beijing (Hospital 302 only) and Taiwan. While the prevalence of the different symptoms were similar in Beijing and Taiwan, the occurrence of most symptoms was typically higher in Hong Kong. Fever was the most common presenting symptom in all three regions. Dizziness, rigor, shortness of breath as well as gastro-intestinal symptoms including diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain were rarely reported in Beijing, on the other hand every patient in Beijing reported malaise.
