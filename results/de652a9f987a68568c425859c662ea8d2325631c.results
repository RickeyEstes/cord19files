Both samples were positive for PEDV RNA with a high load (C T -value, 22) in faeces, while they tested negative for Transmissible Gastroenteritis Coronavirus and Porcine Deltacoronavirus. Whole-genome sequence of strain 1842/2016 has been obtained and deposited in GenBank (accession number KY111278). By phylogenetic analysis of whole genomes, two distinct genogroups designated as genogroup 1 (G1) and genogroup 2 (G2) can be identified (Fig. 1) . In G2, high pathogenic and low pathogenic strains (so called S-INDEL PEDV) formed two separated groups as previously described (Vlasova et al. 2014; Lee 2015) . PEDV 1842/2016 clustered in G2 and grouped together with the S-INDEL PEDV strains recently reported in northern Europe (France 2014, KR11456; Germany 2014, LM645057-LM645058; Belgium 2015, KR003452; Slovenia 2015, KY019623-KU297956) , with whom it shared nearly the 100% of nucleotide identity across the whole genome. Interestingly, the Ukrainian strain (Ukraine/Poltava01/2014, KP403954) did not cluster together with other European S-INDEL PEDV but grouped with US and Asian high pathogenic strains, proving the presence in Europe of both high and low pathogenic PEDV strains. Moreover, the S protein of PEDV 1842/2016 showed three unique amino acid residues located at position 194, 206 and 674 with respect to extant publicly available PEDV sequences. As most of the Italian PEDV sequences available in GenBank are represented only by sequences of the hypervariable S1 region, we performed a further analysis, using a common sequence of 539 bp which includes this region. PEDV 1842/2016 showed 99% nucleotide identity with homologous regions of PEDV strains that have been circulating in Italy and Europe between 2014 and 2015 and 96-97% of nucleotide identity with Italian PEDV strains that circulated before 2014. Indeed, in the S1 tree (Fig. 2) , currently circulating PEDVs (2014-2016) grouped together and separated from the "old" (2007-2009) Italian and European strains, which are, on the other hand, more closely related to the prototype European strain CV777, isolated in the 70s. Remaining genes are highly conserved among PEDV 1842/2016 and global S-INDEL PEDV strains, sharing nearly the 100% of nucleotide identity (data not shown).
