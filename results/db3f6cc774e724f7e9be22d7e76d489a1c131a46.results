In the present study, 39 of 638 common marmosets (6.11 %) did not show any histological changes of the lungs. All spontaneous pulmonary lesions of the other animals are documented in Table 1 . The most commonly observed inflammatory lung condition was constituted by interstitial pneumonia, which was observed in 206 marmosets (32.29 %). The majority of cases with interstitial pneumonia revealed a subacute course of disease with predominance of plasma cells in the inflammatory cell infiltrate. Regarding severity and distributional pattern, mild multifocal or multifocal to coalescing forms predominated ( Fig. 1) , while severe and diffuse cases were very rare. In two marmosets (0.31 %), interstitial pneumonia was associated with acute to subacute alveolitis. There was no histological evidence of infectious agents in all cases of interstitial pneumonia, except for one male juvenile marmoset, which showed characteristic disseminated Grocott-positive blastospores and pseudohyphae in inflamed lung regions, indicating a mycotic etiology consistent with candidiasis. Bacterial culture, if available, was positive in the minority of marmosets affected by interstitial pneumonia. Bacterial isolates included Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Other forms of pneumonia were rare and included lobar pneumonia in nine marmosets (1.41 %), suppurative bronchopneumonia in six marmosets (0.94 %), and bronchointerstitial pneumonia in two marmosets (0.31 %). Lobar pneumonias were further subdi- vided into purulent or fibrinopurulent forms according to the inflammatory exudate (Fig. 2) . In two cases (0.31 %), there was fibrinopurulent pleuropneumonia. The majority of lobar pneumonias (eight of nine cases) and all suppurative bronchopneumonias were moderate to severe and acute to subacute, representing the main cause of disease or death in most cases. Bacterial culture of marmoset lungs affected by purulent bronchopneumonia yielded isolates of Streptococcus sp. and/or Bordetella bronchiseptica in all cases. Bordetella bronchiseptica was also isolated from the lungs of a juvenile female marmoset with fibrinopurulent pleuropneumonia. In three cases of lobar pneumonia, Streptococcus sp., Enterococcus sp., and/or Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. ozaenae could be isolated, while five cases of lobar pneumonia were negative for bacterial culture. Neoplastic conditions occurred in five marmoset lungs, including lymphoma in four adult animals (0.63 %) and fibrosarcoma in one juvenile animal (0.16 %). Regarding the age of animals with tumors, lymphomas affected three rather young adults (3.5 years (two cases) and 2.75 years old) and one older animal (7 years old). The fibrosarcoma occurred in a 1-year-old marmoset. In all cases, pulmonary tumors were regarded as secondary, resulting from metastatic neoplastic disease with presumptive primary tumors in the nodal or extranodal lymphatic system (lymphomas) and in the mammary gland (fibrosarcoma). Immunohistochemical examinations confirmed B cell origin of at least three lymphomas (Fig. 3) . One lymphoma has not been further characterized. Changes in air content were commonly observed, either in otherwise healthy lungs or as an additional finding to other histological diagnoses. There was evidence of atelectasis in 215 marmosets (33.7 %), of which the majority represented subtotal secondary (acquired) atelectasis (178 of 215 cases). Primary (fetal) atelectasis occurred in 37 newborn marmosets (5.8 %), of which 36 animals showed total fetal atelectasis that was regularly associated with lung immaturity. One juvenile marmoset revealed partial fetal atelectasis, also accompanied by discrete signs of lung immaturity. Alveolar emphysema of variable severity and extent was present in 154 animals (24.14 %), whereas interstitial emphysema could not be observed in this study. Circulatory disturbances in marmoset lungs included congestion, edema, hemorrhage, and hyaline membrane formation. Acute pulmonary congestion was a common finding (41.54 %), often regarded as agonal or euthanasia-induced due to the use of barbiturates. The same might be true for pulmonary edema, which was present in 131 marmosets (20.35 %) and occurred both as an additional finding and solitarily. The majority of pulmonary edema was represented by alveolar forms (120 of 131 cases), while involvement of the interstitium was only seen in 11 cases. Extravasation of erythrocytes (hemorrhage) into the interstitium or alveolar space could be seen in 39 marmosets (6.11 %) and, to some extent, was presumably also caused by euthanasia or agony. Hyaline membranes were observed in the lungs of three newborn marmosets (0.47 %) with concurrent atelectasis and evidence of lung immaturity. Mild to moderate deposition of coal dust in the pulmonary interstitium (anthracosis) was present in 52 mostly adult marmosets (8.15 %). In general, anthracosis was not associated with any tissue reaction (Fig. 4) . Hemosiderin-laden macrophages (hemosiderosis) were observed in the lungs of two juvenile and nine adult marmosets (1.72 %), which commonly showed co-existing hemosiderosis in other organs, especially in liver, spleen, and kidneys. There was no evidence of chronic heart failure in cases of pulmonary hemosiderosis. Within the group of miscellaneous lung findings, extramedullary hematopoiesis, mainly characterized by megakaryocytes within alveolar septa, was observed in 74 animals (11.6 %). This predominantly affected adult marmosets, which regularly showed concurrent foci of extramedullary hematopoiesis in multiple organs (liver, spleen, etc.). The second-most-common miscellaneous finding was multifocal interstitial or subpleural mineralization, being present in 70 juvenile and adult marmosets (10.97 %), followed by disseminated inflammatory cell foci observed in 66 marmosets (10.34 %). They mainly consisted of plasma cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes and were primarily located within alveolar septa, perivascular or peribronchial/peribronchiolar (Fig. 5) . Cuboidal alveolar epithelium and thick fibrotic interalveolar tissue of variable extent, indicative of pulmonary immaturity, were present in 62 newborn/stillborn marmosets and in 1 juvenile animal (9.72 %). In many cases, premature lungs also showed total atelectasis and represented a common cause of death in newborn marmosets. A few animals with immature lungs also revealed accumulations of intra-alveolar amniotic fluid (Fig. 6) . Focal or multifocal alveolar histiocytosis, found in 26 marmosets (4.08 %), was generally associated with inflammatory lung lesions. Multifocal interstitial and subpleural fibrosis was detected in juvenile and adult marmosets (3.61 %), occasionally accompanied by focal mineralization (Fig. 7) . Three adult marmosets (0.47 %) revealed pulmonary arteriopathy, characterized by hyperplasia and mineralization of the tunica media as well as edema and hypertrophy of the tunica intima. A focal foreign-body granuloma due to an aspirated hair fragment (Fig. 8) was observed in the lung of one adult female marmoset (0.16 %).
