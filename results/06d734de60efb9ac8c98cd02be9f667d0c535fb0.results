To assess the number of aerosols propagated during blowing the vuvuzela eight volunteers (4 male and 4 female) were each given an instrument and asked to blow enthusiastically, as if they were attending a football match. To enable comparison with other activities undertaken at sporting events each volunteer also shouted into a paper cone constructed to have the same 115 mm diameter exhale opening as the vuvuzela ( Figure 1 ). Particles exiting the vuvuzela or shouting cone were assessed using a laser particle counter and enumerated in six categories according to their diameter. The velocity of air as it exited the devices was measured with a hot-wire anemometer and peak airflows were recorded. The duration of playing was recorded with a stopwatch. Triplicate experiments were undertaken for each individual tested.
