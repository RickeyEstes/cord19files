We received 1440 completed surveys. Of the completed surveys, 137 (10%) were medical, 628 (43%) nursing and 352 (25%) clinical support staff (see Table 1 ). The mean age was 42 years (range 18Ã€73), 83% were female and 36% had dependent children at home. These compared with the overall population within our network where medical, nursing and clinical support staff comprise 15%, 48% and 16%, respectively; females account for 79% of the population, 46% of staff are aged less than 40 years and 5% are over 60 years of age. Responses to the 16 statements are presented in Table 2 . Overall, 74% of respondents strongly agreed or agreed that they needed more education on avian influenza (medical 66%, nursing 78%, P = 0.025), and 48% believed that a pandemic would occur in the next decade (medical 39%, nursing 52%, P = 0.025). Sixty-seven percent of all responders stated they would be available to work during a pandemic. Of the questions related to availability to work during a pandemic, 26% (18% medical, 27% nursing, P = 0.05) stated they would stay at home to care for their children, whereas 10% admitted they would stay away because of fear of catching influenza. The majority of employees expected to be provided with personal protective equipment, antivirals and vaccine (92%, 90% and 89%, respectively), although more nursing than medical staff believed this to be the case (96% v. 89%, P = 0.025 for personal protective equipment; 93% v. 85%, P = 0.05 for antivirals). Sixty-four percent believed that the hospital should also supply their families with antivirals, and 63% thought family members should be given vaccine. Twenty percent of employees believed they would require a place of residence while working during a pandemic (32% medical, 24% nursing, P = 0.05), 45% were prepared to be relocated to another site (58% medical, 40% nursing, P < 0.001), and 36% were prepared to change to another duty (30% medical, 39% nursing).
