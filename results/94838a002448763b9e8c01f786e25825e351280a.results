In a previous study, 47 randomly chosen recombinants were generated between Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV-Mld) and Tomato leaf curl Mayotte virus (ToLCKMV-[Dem]) designated Tyx and Tox respectively. The parental genomes could be differentiated by 534 loci (SNPs) disseminated along the genome and all the recombinants were assignable to one of the two parental genomes at each locus (see Additional file 1). The within-host accumulation of Tyx in tomato at 22 days post inoculation (dpi) was significantly higher than that of Tox genome ( Fig. 3 in (Vuillaume et al., 2011) ) and the distribution of the effect of recombination on virus accumulation was bimodal, with each mode centered on one parental phenotype ( Fig. 4 in (Vuillaume et al., 2011) ). Likewise, the percentage of PCR-positive plants at 15 dpi, a proxy of the speed at which viral DNA accumulates at the onset of the infection, was significantly higher for Tyx than for Tox ( Fig. 2A in (Vuillaume et al., 2011) ). Therefore, the data sets fulfilled the conditions required for the QTL and/or F ST approaches.
