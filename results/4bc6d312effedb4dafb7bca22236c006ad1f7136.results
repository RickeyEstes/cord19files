The contact information listed in Table 2 shows that there are 15 cases each of those has a unique likely infector. From these 15 infector-infectee pairs, the serial interval was estimate to have a mean of 23.9 days and standard deviation of 20.9 days and 95% of serial intervals were predicted to lie with the range 1.6 to 79.1 days (this assumes serial intervals come from a Gamma distribution). The same distribution was assumed for the generation time. The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) from the reconstruction of transmission trees has a mean of 14.4 days and standard deviation of 13.9 days with 95% confidence interval: [0.47, 51.3]. This is shorter than the above direct estimate. The shortness of MLE of serial interval is the consequence of many short pairs of infector-infectee reconstructed: One sample of the reconstructed transmission trees for the Hepatitis A outbreak is shown in the left panel of Fig 1. Within this sample tree, the reconstructed infector-infectee pairs have a mean of 7.7 days, which substantially reduces the overall pooled mean. In view of the large amount of infections being asymptomatic (see the transmission dynamics model below), the shortness of the serial interval of reconstructed infector-infectee pairs must have been due to the ignorance of contribution of asymptomatic infections. Hence we regard the direct estimate as the reasonable serial interval distribution and use it in other analyses. In order to estimate R 0 in the transmission tree method [9] , we sample 10,000 transmission trees from the maximum likelihood estimate of the contact probability p ij . The evolution of effective reproductive number R t along the course of outbreak is show in Fig 1 (right panel) . In view of the turning point of 26 May suggested from renewal equation (see below), we approximated the average reproductive number during the period from 10 March to 26 May 2011 as R 0 and it is 2.00 [1.80,2.20] . If the transmission trees are sampled from the contact probability p ij generated from Eq (1) using direct estimate of serial interval distribution, we obtained the fairly similar estimate: 2.10[1.9, 2.30] (see Table 1 ). The underlying reason for the similar results is that R 0 was calculated as the average reproductive number before 26 May 2011 while In right panel, the filled triangles represent mean and bars the lower and upper levels of 95% Confidence interval (CI). In the transmission tree which describes who acquired infection from whom among 32 cases, 15 cases (black circles except index case) know their unique infectors and the infectors of other 16 cases (red triangles) were reconstructed by the method of [9] . The dashed lines were used to enclose infectees of infector (if there is more than one infectee). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0204201.g001 before this date most infector-infectee pairs were fixed by data rather than being reconstructed by model (Fig 1) . With the fully reconstructed transmission tree, we know each case's position in the pedigree during the outbreak and thus we can easily calculate generation-based reproductive number R g . This is defined as the average number of infections in the next generation that were generated by the cases in current generation. From the sample tree listed in Fig 1, we found that R g reduced not quickly: from initially R g = 3 to R g = 2.33 with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.94 on the 2 nd generation, and R g = 1.29 with SD = 1.46 on the 3 rd generation. Only on the 4 th generation its mean became below the threshold level: R g = 0.55 with SD = 0.68. The slow reduction in R g over time indicates that there was little early intervention to control the spread of infection.
