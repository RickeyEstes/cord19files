Fifteen patients (11 women and 4 men) satisfying the criteria for clinically or laboratory-supported definite MS according to [29, 30] were retrospectively selected for the study. Of these, 13 were relapsing-remitting (RR), and 2 were primary progressive (PP) in agreement with the criteria of Lublin and Reingold [31] . Clinical course (RR and PP), clinical activity (relapse at time of sampling), and MRI activity (the presence of gadolinium enhancing lesions at MRI examination) were analyzed as described previously [32] . The characteristics of the MS patients are summarized in Table 1 . It was interesting to compare some different indexes for CSF and sera of MS patients. Therefore, first we measured a relative concentration of total protein in CSF and sera of MS patients ( Table 2 ). The relative concentrations of total protein of CSFs (range 0.26-0.66 mg/ml) and sera (47-74 mg/ml) of fifteen MS patients varied in different ranges. The average concentration of the total protein in the serum (62.566.7 mg/ml) was ,130-fold higher compared with CSF (0.4860.09 mg/ml) and these values did not demonstrate good correlation (coefficient correlation (CC) = 20.12), Table 2 ). The relative concentrations of total IgGs in the serum and CSF were first measured using an immunoblotting test system. The relative concentration of total IgGs in the serum (range 7.9-16.6 mg/ml; average value 11.761.8 mg/ml) was 167-fold higher than that for the CSF (range 0.02-0.19 mg/ ml; average value 0.0760.04 mg/ml) and there was not good correlation between these values, CC = +0.07. IgGs from the serum and CSF were purified by affinity chromatography on protein-G Sepharose and IgG-protein concentration was estimated in the peaks eluted from the sorbent by an acidic buffer (see below). The relative concentration of total IgGs determined by two different methods was the same within the experimental error. Interestingly, the concentration of total protein in CSF was 6.9-fold higher than total IgGs, while this difference in the case of the serum (5.4-fold) was by a factor of 1.3 lower. We estimated the relative concentration of anti-DNA antibodies in CSF and serum. The relative concentration of anti-DNA antibodies in the CSF of all patients was measured after dilution of CSFs 2-fold; the values for all CSFs were comparable (range 0.21-0.24 A 450 units counting on a cerebrospinal fluid without dilution; average value 0.2260.008 A 450 units), while in the case of the serum (dilution 1000-fold) it was significantly varied (range 110-2000 A 450 units counting on serum without dilution; average value 4376311 A 450 units). Since the relative concentration of anti-DNA antibodies in CSF was relatively low, we have removed all Abs from CSFs by passage through two columns: protein G-Sepharose and protein A-Sepharose. CSFs passed through the columns and controls containing only a standard buffer demonstrated the same A 450 values, which were #5% in comparison with those for untreated CSFs. Thus, we have shown that the relatively low A 450 values corresponding to untreated CSFs are caused by anti-DNA antibodies in these CSFs. In addition, we have shown that DNA-hydrolyzing activity is an intrinsic property of IgGs from CSF (see below). There was no good correlation between anti-DNA antibodies in the sera and CSFs, CC = +0.57 (Table 2 ). In addition, the correlation was very low between the total concentration of IgGs and anti-DNA antibodies both in CSF (CC = +0.40) and the serum (CC = 20.32). At the same time, the average differences in the concentration of total IgGs for the serum and the CSF (167-fold) were 11.9-fold lower than the difference for anti-DNA antibodies of the serum and the CSF (1986-fold) ( Table 2) . It is known that human sera contain several major and especially minor proteins. The average concentration of the total protein in the serum was ,130-fold higher than in CSF (Table 2) . It was interesting to compare major proteins of the sera and CSFs using SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Fig. 1 demonstrates major proteins in some samples of the sera and the CSFs. One can see that the sera contain more major proteins, but in both cases IgGs (150 kDa) and human serum albumin (,67 kDa) are most major proteins. At the same time, in contrast to CSFs, the sera contain several major proteins with mol. masses higher than 150 kDa as well as lower than 150 kDa, but higher than 67 kDa (Fig. 1) . It is interesting to see that in CSFs there are several additional good visible proteins with electrophoretic mobility lower than 67 kDa in comparison with serum preparations. It was interesting to compare total DNase relative activity (RA) of all DNA-hydrolyzing enzymes and Abs in the sera and CSF of MS patients. Preparations of total protein were capable to hydrolyze supercoiled plasmid DNA (scDNA), forming single breaks in one strand of supercoiled DNA (relaxed DNA) and then multiple breaks yielding linear DNA. Finally, they hydrolyzed DNA into short and medium-length oligonucleotides. However, after such a deep hydrolysis of DNA, it was very difficult to estimate the relative activity of these preparations. The RAs of total protein from sera and CSF varied remarkably from patient to patient. Fig. 1 illustrates typical examples of cleavage of scDNA by total protein from several MS patients after 2 h of incubation. Therefore, in order to estimate the DNase activity quantitatively, we found the concentration for each preparation and the time of incubation sufficient to convert scDNA into the relaxed form (10-40%; for example, lanes 2, 6, 7, 9, and 10 of Fig. 1C ) without further noticeable fragmentation after 1-2 h of incubation. Since all measurements (initial rates) were taken within the linear regions of the time courses and protein concentration, the measured RAs were normalized to standard conditions (pmole DNA/1 mg of protein/1 h; standard units (SU)) ( Table 3 ). The relative specific DNase activity of total protein of the serum preparations was varied in the range 0.26-0.88 pmole DNA/1 mg of protein/1 h (average value 0.5160.16 SU). It was surprising that the specific activity of the total protein of CSF reparations were 198-fold higher (range 25-263 SU, average value 101650 SU) than the serum ones (Table 3) . At the same time, concentration of total protein in the case of CSF was 130-fold lower than that of sera (Table 2) . Therefore, in calculation on 1 ml of liquid the average RA of total protein corresponding to the sera was only 1.5-fold lower than that for CSFs. Recently, several strict criteria have been applied to show that the DNase activity is an intrinsic property of IgGs from sera of MS patients but not from healthy donors [24] [25] [26] . When searching abzymes in CSF of MS patients, the IgG fraction was purified by chromatography on protein-A Sepharose in conditions to remove non-specifically bound proteins, followed by gel-filtration as in [24] [25] [26] [27] . The relative amount of CSF preparations from only thirteen MS patients was enough for the purification of IgG preparations. To analyze the ''average'' situation for MS IgGs, we prepared a mixture of equal amounts of IgGs from sera of thirteen patients (IgG mix ). The homogeneity of the 150 kDa IgG mix was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, which showed a single band before, and two bands corresponding to the H and L chains after Ab reduction with DTT (silver staining) ( Fig. 2A) . To prove that DNase activity of CSF IgG mix is its intrinsic property and is not due to copurifying enzymes, we applied some of well known rigid criteria [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] 33] ; a) electrophoretic homogeneity of IgG mix ( Fig. 2A) ; b) gel-filtration of IgG mix in conditions of ''acidic shock'' (pH 2.6) did not lead to the disappearance of Ab activity and the peak of activity tracked exactly with 150 kDa Abs (Fig. 2C) ; c) complete adsorption of the activity by Sepharose bearing monoclonal mouse Abs against human IgG light chains and its elution from the adsorbent with buffer of low pH (Fig. 2D ). In order to exclude possible artifacts due to any hypothetical traces of contaminating enzymes we analyzed additionally the DNase activity of IgG mix using an in situ assay in SDS-PAGE gels containing DNA. After incubation, in order to allow DNase renaturation and staining with ethidium bromide, a sharp dark band at the position of DNA hydrolyzing proteins was revealed on a fluorescent background of DNA-bound ethidium bromide (Fig. 2B) . After the dissociation of the IgG mix using DTT, DNase Table 3 . Relative DNase activity of total proteins and IgGs from CSF and sera of patients with MS.*. Serum (8) CSF (9) Serum (10) CSF (11) Serum ( activity was revealed only in the band of the separated light chains. Similar data was obtained earlier for abzymes from serum of MS patients [24] [25] [26] . Since SDS dissociates any protein complexes, and the electrophoretic mobility of hypothetical contaminating DNases cannot coincide at the same time with that of intact IgG and its Lchains, the detection of DNase activity in the gel region corresponding only to IgG and its light chains, together with the absence of any other bands of the activity or protein, provides direct evidence that DNase activity is an intrinsic property of MS IgG mix and is not due to copurifying enzymes. DNase activity was detected earlier in the case of IgGs from sera of 71 of 75 MS patients (,95%) but in none of 50 healthy donors [24] [25] [26] . There was not any possibility to get CSF preparations from healthy donors. However, one can assume that CSF, similarly to serum preparations from healthy donors, does not contain IgGs with DNase activity. We compared the RAs in the hydrolysis of DNA of IgG preparations from sera and CSFs of thirteen MS patients. The RAs of IgGs from sera and CSF varied markedly from patient to patient. Fig. 3 illustrates typical examples of cleavage of scDNA by IgGs (0.2 mg/ml) from the sera and CSFs (0.003 mg/ml) of several patients after 2 h of incubation at their fixed concentrations. To estimate the DNase activity quantitatively, we found the concentration for each IgG preparation corresponding to the linear part of the rate dependences on Ab concentration (the conditions of the reaction of the pseudo-first order), and the time of incubation sufficient to convert scDNA into the relaxed form Fig. 3A ). Since all measurements (initial rates) were taken within the linear regions of the time courses and Ab concentration curves, the measured RAs for individual IgGs were normalized to standard conditions similarly to those for the preparation of total protein (Table 3) . It was surprising, but CSF IgGs possess significantly higher specific DNase activity than serum ones. Average specific DNase activity of serum IgGs (average value 11.264.3 pmole DNA/1 mg of Ab/1 h; range 3.6-20.8 units) is 48.5-fold lower than that for CSF Abs (average value 543.76239.7 units; range 117.3-1190.5 units) (Table 3 ). At the same time, there is no good correlation between catalytic activities of IgGs from the sera and CSF, CC = + 0.26 (Table 3) . Interestingly, average specific RAs of serum IgGs are ,22-fold higher than those of serum total proteins, while this difference in the case of CSF is significantly lower, only ,5.4-fold (Table 3 ).
