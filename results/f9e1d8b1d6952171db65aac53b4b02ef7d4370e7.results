Nucleotide sequence analyses of the 5Ј UTR and adjacent 289 nts, and 3Ј UTR, of the group 2 coronaviruses reveal a two cluster pattern Structural elements acting as cis-acting replication signals in genomic and DI RNAs have been found in the 5Ј UTR and adjacent 289 nts, and in the 3Ј UTR, of MHV and BCoV (reviewed under Introduction above). To examine potentially conserved features in these regions among the group 2 coronaviruses, the 5Ј UTR sequences, 5Ј UTRadjacent 289 nts, and 3Ј UTR sequences of HCoV-OC43, HECoV-4408, HEV-TN11, ECoV-NC99, and SDAV were determined and compared with the published sequences for BCoV-Mebus, MHV-A59, MHV-2, and MHV-JHM (see GenBank Accession Nos. described below and Figs. 2 and 3). For PV, the 3Ј UTR was also compared (Fig. 3) . Upon alignment it became apparent by inspection that there were several regions, up to 18 nts in length in the 5Ј UTR and adjacent 289 nts and up to 29 nts in the 3Ј UTR, that were identical among all the viruses examined (identified by shading in Figs. 2 and 3). It was likewise apparent that there were several smaller regions in which sequences diverged considerably, yielding patterns that would suggest the viruses could be grouped into those that are either BCoV-like or MHV-like. The existence of a two-cluster pattern was confirmed in separate phylogenetic analyses of the 5Ј and 3Ј UTRs and of the amino acid sequences in the partial ORF adjacent to the 5ЈUTR (Figs. 4A-C).
