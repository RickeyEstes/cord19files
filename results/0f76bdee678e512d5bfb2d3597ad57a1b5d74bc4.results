The spatial distribution of influenza A (H1N1) cases per 1,000 people and its relation to sociodemographic covariates is illustrated in Fig 4. During the study period, influenza cases were mainly concentrated in the municipalities within the metropolitan, northern, and western regions of Paraná, where the highest rates of the disease were observed. In general, the maps suggest that higher altitudes and poverty rates may be related to a lower concentration of cases. Municipal HDI, demographic and medical densities, and pendular migration presented heterogeneous spatial distribution patterns compatible with the most affected regions of the state. Higher rates of influenza were observed in municipalities with primary means of transport with the exception of intercity highways, where this relationship was not confirmed. The was no apparent relationship between the total number of cases reported weekly and climate covariates. Table 1 shows the effects of covariates that were retained in the final spatiotemporal model, expressed in terms of chance ratio and the relative risk of the disease in Paraná. We found that pendular migration, presence of air transport, and HDI significantly contributed to increase the chance of influenza. Population density, municipal road transport, municipal HDI and maximum temperature represented risk factors for the disease intensity. The effect of the covariate maximum lagged temperature of one week (lag 1) was assumed to vary over time, and therefore is omitted from Table 1. The variables minimum temperature, relative humidity, altitude, poverty rate, and medical density were not included in the spatiotemporal model due to multicollinearity. Presence of boat transportation in the municipality, the existence of intercity road transport, and rainfall did not contribute significantly to either the chance of occurrence or intensity of influenza A (H1N1) in Paraná and were also not included in the final regression model. The Brazilian influenza A (H1N1) pandemic was divided into two phases: the containment phase and the mitigation phase. The containment phase was the period of introduction of the virus, in which cases of the disease were related to international travel or contact with sick persons who had traveled internationally. This phase was from EW 16 (04/19) to EW 28 (07/12) in 2009, a period that preceded the declaration of sustained transmission of the virus. The mitigation phase began in EW 29 (07/19). The actions recommended for this phase were aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality due to the disease through the early diagnosis and treatment of cases that presented greater risk for severe outcomes or death. In EWs 14 through 18, the period of introduction of the virus in Brazil, there was a significant increase in the incidence of influenza A associated with increased temperature. However, from EW 21 (06/24) to EW 28 (07/12), the period that preceded the sustained transmission phase, reduced temperature favored increased risk of influenza. In general, after the start of the mitigation phase (EW 28) there was no substantial impact of temperature on disease risk (Fig 5) . The spatial correlation parameter, δ = 0.965(0.964 − 0.965), suggests a high degree of spatial dependence for dissemination of pandemic influenza in Paraná. Analogously, the value of the temporal correlation coefficient ρ = 0.509(0.508 − 0.511) confirms the short-term persistence of the number of confirmed and autochthonous cases of influenza A (H1N1). An effect significantly different from zero was also observed for the parameter that relates the effects of the spatiotemporal interaction of both processes, such that ϕ = 0.211(0.208 − 0.216) indicates that the occurrence of cases of the disease also have a heterogeneous spatiotemporal pattern. Fig 6 shows the map of the posterior probabilities of infuenza A (H1N1) chance exceeds 1 for some epidemiological weeks. As we are particularly interested in increased chance, we can visualize the level of uncertainty associated with estimating the chance of influenza when it is greater than 1. The probability maps revealed heterogeneity in the diffusion process of influenza A in Paraná, expliciting underlying geographical differences which caused some municipalities to reach the peak of the epidemic before others. There was high chance of influenza A in the capital Curitiba in the first week of April (EW 14), when the virus was installed in the national territory. From EW 24 (06/14 to 06/20), outbreaks of virus began to spread, concentrating mainly on sites that were geographically distant but important from a socioeconomic perspective. Beginning with EW 28 (07/12 to 07/18), there was a substantial increase in the probability of occurrence of influenza cases in Paraná as a whole, characterizing the beginning of the sustained transmission period according to an official announcement from the Ministry of Health. The epidemic spread rapidly throughout the state, reaching the peak for chance of occurrence in EW 31 (08/02 to 08/08). Overall, from EW 35 (08/30 to 09/05) onwards, there was a progressive reduction in the chance of influenza occurrence, culminating in EW 38 (09/20 to 09/26) when few municipalities still had a high probability of disease occurrence, mainly those in which the virus was identified precociously. Fig 7 shows the excess of influenza risk, that is, in the probability P(Risk > 1). In EW 14 (04/05 to 04/11), which marked the beginning of the study period, the probability of excess risk was considered low for all municipalities of Paraná. However, in EW 25 (06/21 to 06/ 27), a period of high risk of transmission, there was an increased risk of influenza in the state capital, Curitiba. From EW 29 (07/19 to 07/25), the week following the official announcement of sustained transmission of the disease, there were significant increases in the risk of influenza A for two of the most populous municipalities in the western region of Paraná, two municipalities in the southwest and northwest regions, and another in the north-central region, in addition to Curitiba, which maintained a high risk. Since then, other areas of dissemination appeared, increasing the risk of spread of the disease, especially to neighboring municipalities. From EW 32, there was a slow and progressive reduction of the risk of influenza A (H1N1). At EW 38, the risk of disease transmission was considered low for all municipalities. Fig 8 illustrates the analysis of candidate municipalities as the starting points of the spatial diffusion process of influenza A (H1N1) in Paraná in 2009. The values in the center of the blue squares in the first column of the matrix represent the Spearman correlation coefficients between the time of arrival of the epidemic and the effective distance. The upper triangular part of the matrix shows the scatter plots which produced the correlation coefficients for each of the candidate municipalities. As expected, regardless of origin the greater the effective distance of the candidate municipality, the longer the arrival time of the epidemic. It is also easily observable that the municipalities of Pinhais and Curitiba presented the highest correlations and, therefore, are strong candidates for the origin of the process of diffusion of influenza. It is noteworthy that the connectivity matrices and, consequently, the effective distances for both municipalities, are quite similar (correlation equal to 0.94). This is due to the fact that Pinhais has a very strong connection to Curitiba, the State Capital. The number of individuals frequently traveling to Curitiba is 20 times larger than to the second main destination, and concentrates almost 84% of the flow from Pinhais. Therefore, the paths from Pinhais to other municipalities are mostly governed by those from the Capital.
