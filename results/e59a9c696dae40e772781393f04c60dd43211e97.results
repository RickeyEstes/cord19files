MERS-CoV specific antibodies in Israeli camels were analyzed using Qabboa Rahat --2 2 18 10 32 11 Azem Hura Mitzpe two serological assays, VNT and ELISA. Until the year 2014 sera were analyzed only by VNT, as being a gold standard, performed by the reference laboratory. With the expansion of screening activities in Israel, in subsequent years, sera were analyzed by ELISA also, as enabled by safety requirements, thus both assays were performed in parallel. Fig. 2 shows the neutralization titers and the percentage positives with confidence level (CI) detected by the two assays per year. While the VNT was performed on all sera collected from 2012 to 2017, ELISA was performed only on the sera collected between 2015 and 2017. We initially tested 90 camel sera, obtained from 2012 to 2014, using VNT. Most camels were adults, 3 years and more, thus analysis of infection by age is not possible. MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies for the year 2012 showed a seropositivity of 72.5% point estimate proportion (PEP) (CI: 60.3%, 84.8%) at a 95% confidence level (CL). The seropositivity seemed to drop to 38.7%, during 2013. Sera from 2015 to 2017 were analyzed by both ELISA and VNT ( Fig. 2A, B) . The seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies obtained using ELISA did not significantly differ from those obtained using VNT, as both PEPs and Cls overlapped (Fig. 2) . Most camel sera were collected from the Southern part of Israel, except of 2 farms (nos. 14 and 15) ( Table 1 , Fig. 1 ), from the Northern and Central Israel, respectively. Only one camel serum from farm no. 14 was positive. The sensitivity and specificity of the two serological assays, VNT and ELISA, between 2015 and 2017 were determined on 271 camels sera that were tested in parallel by the two assays. Taking VNT as the gold-standard the sensitivity of the ELISA when compared to the VNT assay was 91.71% (CI: 86.70%, 95.29%) and the specificity was 93.33% (Cl: 86.05%, 97.51%). We performed a kappa evaluation of the agreement between the ELISA and the VNT tests, receiving a value of 0.82 (CI: 0.75, 0.89; 95% CL). As defined by Cohen [10] , 0.82 shows a perfect strength of agreement. Overall for 2012 to 2017, 254 camels (61.8%) were VNT positive, with neutralizing titers from 20 to ≥2560 (Fig. 2A) . In 184 camels (70.4%), low antibody titers, between 20 and 320, were measured, while 70 camels (29.6%) had high antibody titers, between 320 to ≥2560. No antibodies were detected (titer < 20) in 155 (37.8%) camels. During 2016, blood was collected from 102 alpacas and 19 llamas and tested by ELISA and by VNT (Fig. 3A) . Using ELISA the alpaca and llama sera showed a seroprevalence of 34.3 and 36.8%, respectively (35 and 7 positives). Using VNT, 30 alpacas and 6 llamas were positive, and PEPs were 29.4% (CI: 21.4%, 38.8%) and 31.5% (CI: 15.3%, 54.0%) respectively. The VNT titers were relatively low, ranging from 20 to 320 (Fig. 3B) . The two camels sampled from the same farm as the alpacas and lamas were negative for MERS-CoV by both VNT and ELISA. The nasal swabs of 540 camels, 102 alpacas and 19 llamas, collected between January 2015 and December 2017, were analyzed for the presence of MERS-CoV RNA. All nasal swabs were negative for the presence of MERS-CoV RNA, providing no evidence for active circulation, at least until 2017, of MERS-CoV in the Negev camels.
