In a total of 711 subjects, there were 351 subjects with first-time acute STEMI and 360 controls without a history of MI. Blood samples were collected on day 7 after MI in the acute MI subjects. As shown in Table 1 , the acute MI subjects and the controls were comparable in age, BMI, blood lipids (except for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides), blood pressure, and insulin sensitivity. As shown in Table 2 , only 2.6%-2.8% of subjects in the control and the acute MI groups were homozygous Arg 972 IRS-1 (AA) carriers. As the number of Arg 972 IRS-1 homozygotes was too small to generate any results of adequate statistical power, we combined Arg 972 IRS-1 homozygotes (AA) and heterozygotes (GA) into one group (GA+AA) to compare with the wild type IRS-1 (GG) group. In addition, as the acute MI subjects and the non-MI controls showed marginally significant difference in the gender profile (p=0.08), we performed gender-stratified comparisons between the control subjects and the acute MI subjects to minimize the potential confounding effects of gender. There was no significant difference in the allelic frequency between the acute MI subjects and the non-MI control subjects in total or by gender (Table 2) , indicating that the Arg 972 IRS-1 mutation is not a significant contributor for acute MI. As shown in Table 3 , the serum ACE2 level was significantly higher in the acute MI subjects than that in the control subjects (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in the serum ACE2 level between the GG and the GA+AA genotype groups in the control subjects. However, in the acute MI subjects, the GA+AA genotype group had significantly lower serum ACE2 levels and higher MI severity scores than the GG genotype group (p<0.05). There were no significant gender differences in the findings. As shown in Table 4 , ANOVA analysis of the whole cohort of subjects (both the control and the STEMI subjects with a discontinuous covariate of acute MI) revealed that acute MI (p=0.00), but not the Arg 972 IRS-1 genotype (P=0. 19 ) contributed significantly to the variance of serum ACE2 levels. In addition, the Arg 972 IRS-1 genotype and acute MI showed significant interaction (p=0.00) that contributes to the variance of serum ACE2 levels. The results suggest that after acute MI, Arg 972 IRS-1 carriers tend to have decreased serum ACE2 levels than wild type IRS-1 carriers. Out of the 351 acute MI subjects, 165 had blood drawn for other studies before the occurrence of MI. We next examined serum ACE2 levels in the 165 subjects before and after MI. As shown in Table 5 , the serum ACE2 level in the GA+AA genotype group was similar to that in the GG genotype group before acute MI. However, after the occurrence of acute MI, the GA+AA genotype group had significantly lower serum ACE2 levels than the GG genotype group (p<0.05). There were no significant gender differences in the findings. Taken together, the results indicate that the presence of Arg 972 IRS-1 leads to significantly reduced serum ACE2 levels and more severe MI in acute MI patients independent of gender. To explore the potential causal relationship between Arg 972 IRS-1 and serum ACE2 levels in acute MI subjects, we performed in vitro experiments using human cardiomyocytes treated with hypoxia. Expression vectors for wild type IRS-1 and Arg 972 IRS-1 were stably transfected into cardiomyocytes. Endogenous IRS-1 was stably knocked down by shRNA. As shown in Figure 1 , stably transfected cells showed marked increase in the protein detected by an anti-IRS-1 antibody, indicating that wild type IRS-1 or Arg 972 IRS-1 was overexpressed in the transfected cardiomyocytes. Compared with cells stably transduced with scramble control shRNA, cells stably transduced with IRS-1 shRNA showed over 80% knockdown of endogenous IRS-1 (Figure 1 ). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR showed that in the absence of insulin, the ACE2 mRNA level remained at a basal level in all experimental groups under either normoxia or hypoxia (Table 6 ). In the presence of insulin (1 mg/L), the ACE2 mRNA level was significantly elevated in the controls. In normoxia, while overexpression of wild type or Arg 972 IRS-1 did not significantly change the ACE2 mRNA level, both IRS-1 shRNA and PI3K inhibitor LY294002 abolished insulininduced elevation of the ACE2 mRNA level (Table 6) . Cardiomyocytes were then exposed to hypoxia to simulate oxygen deprivation during MI. After 24 hours of culture under hypoxia plus insulin (1 mg/L), the control cells showed significantly elevated ACE2 mRNA levels compared to the controls under normoxia+insulin ( Table 6) . Overexpression of Arg 972 IRS-1 markedly decreased the ACE2 mRNA level in cardiomyocytes under hypoxia ( Table 6 ). Both IRS-1 shRNA and LY294002 abolished the induction of ACE2 mRNA by insulin plus hypoxia ( Table 6 ). The results were confirmed at the ACE2 protein level by western blot analyses, which also showed that ACE2 was expressed at a constitutively low level in cardiomyocytes under normoxia ( Figure 2 ). ELISA showed that secreted/soluble ACE2 levels in the culture media of cardiomyocytes followed the same data trend ( Table 7 ). The findings indicate that insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling is required for ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes, and that hypoxia can markedly enhance the induction effect of insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling on ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes. As ACE2 reportedly is shed by sheddase ADAM17 to produce soluble ACE2 [23] , and ADAM17 expression reportedly is regulated by hypoxia [24] , we next examined ADAM17 shedding activities in human cardiomyocytes under the same experimental conditions as in Table 7 . As shown in Figure 3 , the ADAM17 shedding activity was significantly up-regulated by hypoxia in cardiomyocytes. However, overexpression or knockdown of IRS-1, overexpression of Arg 972 IRS-1, or inhibition of PI3K showed no significant effects on the ADAM17 activity in cardiomyocytes with or without insulin, indicating that insulin signaling had no significant effect on the ADAM17 shedding activity in cardiomyocytes. Therefore, the effects of Arg 972 IRS-1 on ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes did not involve a shedding mechanism. In addition, we found no association between Arg 972 -IRS-1 variants and the ACE2 1075AA, 16854GG or 8790AA genotypes in female acute MI patients, or the ACE2 1075A/G-8790A/G-16854G/C haplotype GGC in male acute MI patients (data not shown). As shown in Figure 4 , in the absence of insulin, the IRS-1-associated PI3K activity remained at a basal level in all experimental groups under either normoxia or hypoxia. In the presence of insulin (1 mg/L), the IRS-1associated PI3K activity was significantly elevated in the controls. In normoxia, overexpression of Arg 972 IRS-1 slightly decreased the IRS-1-associated PI3K activity, and both IRS-1 shRNA and LY294002 abolished insulininduced elevation of the IRS-1-associated PI3K activity. In the presence of hypoxia plus insulin (1 mg/L), the control cells showed markedly elevated the IRS-1-associated PI3K activity compared to the controls under normoxia+ insulin. Overexpression of Arg 972 IRS-1 markedly decreased the IRS-1-associated PI3K activity in cardiomyocytes under hypoxia. Both IRS-1 shRNA and LY294002 abolished induction of the IRS-1-associated PI3K activity by insulin plus hypoxia. The results indicate that hypoxia can significantly enhance the IRS-1-associated PI3K activity (or, in other words, insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling) in cardiomyocytes.
