During May 1-October 31, 2009, a total of 324 patients were included in the surveillance. Of these, 19 were excluded from further analysis; 18 patients did not meet the clinical case defi nitions, and no NPA specimen was received for 1 patient (Figure 1) . Pneumonia was diagnosed for 234 (77%) of the 305 eligible patients, and ILI was diagnosed for 71 (24%). For patients with pneumonia, median age was 2.0 years (range 0.1-68 years) and 55% were male; for those with ILI, median age was 1.4 years (range 0.2-10 years) and 54% were male. Fifty seasonal infl uenza A infections and 17 pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infections were detected by rRT-PCR. Fortynine of the 50 seasonal infl uenza A infections were subtyped as H1N1; one was subtype H3N1 (Figure 2 ; with dual virus infection were not signifi cantly more ill than those with infl uenza A infection alone (3/7 vs. 26/60; p = 1.0). Illnesses for 205 (67%) patients met the strict case definition for ILI or pneumonia; 100 (33%) met only the expanded case defi nitions. Age distribution and proportion of infl uenza A viruses did not differ signifi cantly between the strict and expanded case defi nition groups. However, a signifi cantly higher proportion of patients with ILI (18/25 vs. 6/46; p<0.001) or pneumonia (99/180 vs. 5/54; p<0.001) whose illnesses met the strict case defi nition were hospitalized, which suggests that the expanded case defi nitions captured patients with milder illnesses. Overall, at least 1 virus was detected in 175 (57%) patients (37/71 ILI, 138/234 pneumonia). HMPV and RSV accounted for 120/187 (54%) viruses detected. These viruses were detected in ILI cases (HMPV 23%,; RSV 17%) and pneumonia (HMPV, 21%; RSV 18%). RSV was detected signifi cantly more often in children <5 years of age (48/221 vs. 6/84; p = 0.003) and was more age restricted than all other viruses. In Figure 4 ) (R. Sedhain, pers. comm).
