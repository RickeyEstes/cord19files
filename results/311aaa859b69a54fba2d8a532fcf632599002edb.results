Sample characterization. A total of 221 human fecal samples (131 from Kumba and 90 from Lysoka) were collected from two hospitals in the Southwest region of Cameroon, for viral metagenomics screening. From these fecal samples, a total of 63 pools were constituted in categories based on age, bat contact status, and location (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Illumina sequencing of all the 63 human pools generated in total approximately 708 million raw paired-end (PE) reads (between 4.3 and 53.4 million reads per pool). After trimming, 67% of the reads (471 million) were retained and 86% of these retained trimmed reads (405 million) were annotated using Diamond. Of these, 18% (74 million) could be attributed as viral. NGS viral read distribution/abundances. In each of the categories of pools, phages make up at least 84% of the total number of viral reads while the maximum proportion of eukaryotic viral reads is 16%. A similar annotation profile was observed for pools of patients in different age groups, different locations, and different bat contact statuses (Fig. S1 ). Further analysis of eukaryotic viral reads revealed that at least 70% of the reads mapped to viruses of the families Astroviridae, Reoviridae, and Anelloviridae (Fig. 1A) . Other viruses were also present, particularly those that are known to cause gastroenteritis belonging to the families Adenoviridae, Caliciviridae (Sapovirus and Norovirus), and Picornaviridae (of which about 60% were enteroviruses [Fig. 1B and Fig. S2] ). Also, reads from viruses known to cause other human diseases (Parvoviridae) or other animal diseases (Circoviridae) or not associated with any diseases at all (Picobirnaviridae) were present in variable numbers in the different groups ( Fig. 1B to E) . The rest of the viral families were either plant-or insect-associated viruses. Notably, in age groups A to D, the percentage of pools in which Picobirnaviridae viruses were present increased with age with low percentages in age groups A and B (Fig. 1C) . Also, the percentages of pools positive for anelloviruses differed with respect to age, with higher percentages in young children and the elderly. Further, there were no observable trends in the percentage of eukaryotic viral presence with respect to bat contact status or location ( Fig. 1D and E) . Figure 1F shows a heat map of the percentage of pools in which eukaryotic viral families were present in human and bat pools, while Fig. S3 presence in human and bats at the genus level (23) . Astroviridae (Mamastrovirus), Calciviridae (Sapovirus), Picornaviridae (Parechovirus), and Reoviridae (Rotavirus), viral families known to cause gastroenteritis in humans, were identified in both bat and human pools from the same region. Also, mammalian viruses not yet established to cause gastroenteritis (Picobirnaviridae, Circoviridae, and Parvoviridae [Bocaparvovirus]) were also common in both bats and humans from the same regions ( Fig. 1F and Fig. S3 ). Phylogeny of eukaryotic viruses. In this study, we focused on viruses from which near-complete genomes were obtained, particularly those that are known to cause viral gastroenteritis (belonging to the Astroviridae, Caliciviridae [norovirus and sapovirus] , Picornaviridae [enterovirus, parechovirus, cosavirus] , Parvoviridae, Reoviridae, and Adenoviridae [human mastadenovirus]). Furthermore, we also looked at other viruses not fully proven to cause gastroenteritis in humans but which have only sporadically been associated with gastroenteritis, like Picobirnaviridae and small circular singlestranded DNA viruses. Phylogenetic analysis was done for each of the selected viruses using the protein or nucleotide sequences of suitable conserved regions and representative members of their viral family, genus, or species. Reoviridae. Reoviridae is a large viral family of segmented dsRNA viruses with a wide host range. They are further divided into two subfamilies and 15 genera. Genomes of viruses belonging to the Reoviridae contain 9 to 12 segments (24) . In total, Reoviridae reads were found in 6 pools, and (nearly) complete genomes of 2 viruses of the family Reoviridae were obtained from pool HP55. Samples in this pool were from two diarrheic children (less than 5 years), originating from Kumba and without contact with bats. Mammalian orthoreovirus. Mammalian orthoreoviruses (MORVs) contain 10 segments, L1 to L3, M1 to M3, and S1 to S4, coding for 12 to 13 proteins (24, 25) . A MORV strain was identified represented by 16,913 reads (0.4% of all viral reads of the pool). Phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide sequences of each of the 10 segments of this MORV ( Fig. 2 and Fig. S4 ) showed topological incongruence with four distinctive patterns. Based on segments L2 and S1, this strain clustered with bat strains WIV3 and WIV5 from China with 86% and 70% nucleotide (nt) identity, respectively ( Fig. 2A and  B ). For the L1 and S2 segments, the human strain clustered with the Ndelle murine strain, also from Cameroon, with 95% and 92% nt identity, respectively (Fig. 2C and D) . On the other hand, segment S3 of the Cameroonian MORV strain clustered with a human strain and a civet MORV strain from China (88% and 89% nt identity, respectively [Fig. 2E] ). The rest of the segments (L3, M1 to M3, and S4) did not cluster together clearly with any of the abovementioned strains (Fig. S4) . Rotavirus A. Rotavirus A (RVA) contains 11 segments coding for 11 or 12 proteins: VP1 to VP4, VP6, VP7, and NSP1 to NSP6 (26, 27) . We identified a near-complete RVA sequence which made up 99% (4.3 million) of the eukaryotic viral reads of that pool. The NSP3 segment was not identified in the sample. The VP7 gene of this strain was genetically most related to RVA/Human-tc/USA/Wa/1974/G1P1A [8] and RVA/Human-TC/USA/Rotarix/2009/G1P [8] (nt identity of 92 and 97%, respectively) while the VP4 gene was 90% identical to the same strains. The phylogenetic trees of the remaining segments shared the same clustering pattern (Fig. 3A and B and Fig. S5 ). According to the rotavirus classification scheme, this strain is a typical Wa-like G1P [8] named RVA/ Human-wt/CMR/CMRHP55/2014/G1P [8] . CMRHP55 was distantly related to bat RVA strains identified from the same regions (only 69 to 71% nt identity). Picornaviridae. The Picornaviridae represent a large family of small, cytoplasmic, nonenveloped icosahedral ssRNA viruses consisting of 80 species, grouped into 35 genera. They have a genome of 7.1 to 8.9 kb in size and are most often composed of a single ORF encoding a polyprotein flanked by a 5= and 3= UTR (28) . The members of the family Picornaviridae can cause gastroenteritis, meningitis, encephalitis, paralysis (nonpolio and polio-type), myocarditis, hepatitis, upper respiratory tract infections, and diabetes (29, 30) . Out of the 63 pools, 41 contained Picornaviridae reads, making the Picornaviridae the eukaryotic viral family of which reads could be identified in the highest number of pools. Enterovirus. The genus Enterovirus (EV) consists of 15 species: Enterovirus A to L and Rhinovirus A to C. EV A, B, C, and D are found in humans; E and F in cattle; G in pigs; H, J, and L in monkeys; K in rodents; and species I in dromedary camels (http://www .picornaviridae.com). In this study, eighteen (nearly) complete genomes of EVs were obtained. The strains were named EV/Human/CMRHPxx/CMR/2014, here referred to as EV-CMRHPxx. All eighteen genomes were found in pools of age groups A and B (Ï½3 and 3 to 20 years, respectively). Eight of these were identified in age group A, three (EV-CMRHP1, 5A, and 5B) of which were pools consisting of samples of infants who had indirect contact with bats while the rest (EV-CMRHP14, 45, 52A, 52B, and 55) were those that had no contact with bats. The ten other strains were identified in pools belonging to age group B, three of which had direct contact with bats (EV-CMRHP8A, 8B, and 9), 5 indirect contact 4, 35A, 35B, and 39) and two with no contact . Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 nucleotide sequences, the EVs found in this study were quite divergent from each other, belonging to three different species of Enterovirus, A, B, and C (Fig. 4A ). Most of the strains belonged to the Enterovirus C clade (EV-CMRHP1, 3, 4, 8A, 8B, 9, 14, 18, 35A, 52A, and 55) , while EV-CMRHP35B, 39, and 45 clustered within the Enterovirus B genotype, and EVCMRHP5A, 5B, 52B, and 58 in the genogroup Enterovirus A. Some pools had multiple strains of EV present, and some of these clustered together (CMRHP8A and 8B: vaccine type PV-3), whereas other pools contained distinct EV species (EV-CMRHP35A and 35B; 52A and 52B). The presence of vaccine strains in pool HP8 probably indicates recent vaccination events of the infants in this pool. Apart from EV-CMRHP39 (which clustered with 11C52_CMR), all the EV strains identified here were distantly related to those previously identified in the Far North region of Cameroon (31) . Furthermore, none of the human strains from Cameroon were related to any of the animal EV strains (from chimp or gorilla). A summary of the detailed classification of these EVs using an online typing tool (32) is shown in Table 1 . Parechovirus. The genus Parechovirus is comprised of two species, Parechovirus A (human parechovirus [HPeV] ) and Parechovirus B (Ljungan virus, isolated from bank voles) (33) . HPeV is subdivided into 19 types (HPeV1 to -19) . HPeV is associated with mild gastrointestinal or respiratory illness; however, severe disease conditions, such as meningitis/encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, and neonatal sepsis, may occur (34) (35) (36) . Here, three (nearly) complete HPeVs were identified in pools HP2, HP46, and HP48 with sequence lengths of 7,142 bp, 7,202 bp, and 7 ,219 bp, respectively, collected from children less than 3 years old (age group A). In terms of bat contact status, they were in pools of those either in indirect contact with bats (HP2 and HP48) or without contact (HP46). They were all distantly related to each other, with HPeV-CMRHP46 and HPeV-CMRHP48 having the highest identity (76% and 86% nt and aa identity, respectively). Phylogenetically, HPeVs in HP46 and in HP48 fell into a clade of type 1 HPeVs (Fig. 4B ). The HPeV in HP46 clustered together with HPeV1/Harris strain with 76% nt identity, while CMRHP48 clustered closely with Japanese and Norwegian strains A1086-99 and NO-3694 (84 to 90% nt identity) . Furthermore, HPeV-CMRHP2 clustered distantly with type 16 HPeVs from China and Bangladesh with only 70 to 71% nt identity. Considering the 75% identity demarcation for HPeV types (37, 38) , this strain potentially represents a novel type. Cosavirus. The genus Cosavirus consists of five species (Cosavirus A, B, and D to F), which have been associated with gastroenteritis in children (39) . Six near-complete [8] strains. Red, Cameroonian human RVA strain identified in this study; blue, Cameroonian bat RVA strains. Trees were constructed human cosavirus (HCoSV) genomes were identified: 1 from children less than 3 years old (HP49), 3 from those between 3 and Ï½20 years old (HP6A and HP6B, HP57), and 2 from pools of individuals between 20 and Ï½60 years old (HP44, HP24). Some of these pools had direct or indirect contact with bats (HP6, HP24, and HP44), while others had no contact with bats (HP49 and HP57). Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 4C ) showed that cosaviruses from HP6B, HP49, and HP57 formed a clade with two other strains from Australia and Nigeria (HCoSV/E1/AUS and HCoSV/NG385/NGA) in species HCoSV E. Meanwhile the strains in HP6A, HP24, and HP44 clustered with HCoSV in species A, D, and B, respectively. Therefore, it seems that humans in Cameroon host a diverse range of cosaviruses. Cardiovirus. The genus Cardiovirus consists of three species, Cardiovirus A to C. Species B includes Saffold virus (SafV) infecting humans. It has been found in cases with acute flaccid paralysis, respiratory tract infections, and diarrhea in China (40) (41) (42) . Here, we found a near-complete genome of a SafV in one pool (HP35) belonging to the age group between 3 and Ï½20 years old who had indirect contact with bats. The VP1 Phylogenetic trees were based on the nucleotide sequences of the VP1-P2A region for the species Hepatovirus A and the VP1 region for the rest of the genera. All the trees were constructed using the GTRÏ©GÏ©I nucleotide substitution model using RAxML, with the autoMRE flag, which enables a posteriori bootstrapping analysis. Only bootstrap values greater than 70% are shown. Bars indicate nucleotide substitutions per site. Red, novel strains from this study; blue, human Cameroonian enterovirus strains from other studies; green, animal enterovirus strains from Cameroon. segment of the identified SafV was 72 to 74% and 78 to 80% identical (on nt level) to SafV strains in types 5 and 6, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on the VP1 region confirmed the clustering of the novel strain between types 5 and 6 with more phylogenetic relatedness to type 6 ( Fig. 4D) . Hence, this novel SafV strain may be a distant member of type 6 or represent a new type. Hepatovirus A. Hepatitis A virus (HAV), now Hepatovirus A, belongs to the genus Hepatovirus, which consists of nine species (Hepatovirus A to I). The Hepatovirus A species is comprised of a single serotype, HAV, subdivided into human and simian viruses (43) . It causes acute hepatitis throughout the world (44) . There were three (nearly) complete HAV genomes in pools HP2, HP4, and HP6, all of which were pools from those in direct (HP6) or indirect (HP2 and HP4) contact with bats. These strains were either from infants less than 3 years old (HP2) or from children between 3 and Ï½20 years old (HP4 and HP6). Based on the VP1-P2A region, the nt identity between these strains was 98 to 99%. Strains in HP4 and HP6 were 99% identical to BRAB13, isolated from a patient from the Netherlands in 2001, who was staying in a hippie community with visitors from all over the world and under primitive living conditions (45) . On the other hand, the HAV strain in HP2 was closely related to strain G2B1-VP from France (98% nt identity). Therefore, all strains identified here are genotype IIA (Fig. 4E) , increasing the number of completely sequenced genotype II strains to five (the other two strains are BA/ITA/2012 and CF53/Berne). Astroviridae. Astroviridae is a family of nonenveloped, spherical viruses with a linear ssRNA(Ï©) genome of 6.8 to 7kb, containing three overlapping ORFs. The family is divided into two genera: genus Mamastrovirus (MAstVs) and genus Avastrovirus (AAstVs). The genera are further divided into 33 and 7 species, respectively (46) . Fourteen out of the sixty-three human pools contained Astroviridae reads, and we were able to obtain eight near-complete genomes of MAstVs (HP2, 3, 6, 34, 35, 43, 45, and 46) . Additionally, these pools were either from children less than 3 years old (HP2, HP45, and HP46), age group 3 to Ï½20 (HP3, HP6, and HP35), or between 20 and Ï½60 (HP34 and HP43). Phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp and capsid regions ( Fig. 5A and B) depicted clustering of the novel MAstVs in species 1 (CMRHP2, 3, 34, 35D, 43, and 46) , 6 (CMRHP45), and 9 (CMRHP6). In the MAstVs1 clade, there seems to be topological inconsistency in the different phylogenetic trees. Strain AstV8_Yuc8 (AF260508) clustered with the novel strains CMRHP2, 3, and 35D in the capsid tree, while in the RdRp tree it clustered with the Chinese strain V4-Guangzhou, suggesting a recombination event between these strains in the past.
