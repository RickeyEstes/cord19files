The study evaluated 36 children between 3 and 12 years of age undergoing adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy from April 2012 to January 2013, with an average age of 7.3 years and a median of 7 years. Of these 36 children, 25 (69.4%) were girls and 11 (30.6%) were boys. A total of 108 pre-and postoperative nasopharyngeal specimens and adenoid tissue samples were removed surgically from these 36 patients (75 samples from girls and 33 from boys). At least 1 viral agent was isolated in any of the samples collected in 58.3% of 36 children (n ¼ 21) and in 25.9% of 108 samples (n ¼ 28), in 36.4% (n ¼ 12) of 33 samples of boys and 21.3% (n ¼ 16) samples from 75 girls. Of the respiratory viruses found in 36 samples, 75% (n ¼ 27) were isolated in children under 7 years of age. Of the 21 patients with positive results for any respiratory virus, 6 (28.6%) had more than 1 respiratory virus. Considering the 28 positive samples, the rate of viral coinfection also was 28.6% (n ¼ Respiratory viruses were found in 33.3% of preoperative nasopharyngeal specimens (n ¼ 12), with a single virus isolated in 83.3% (n ¼ 10) and coinfection by 2 viral agents in 16.7% of samples (n ¼ 2), totaling 14 respiratory viruses. In adenoid tissue samples, respiratory viruses were found in 30.6% (n ¼ 11): single viral infection in 72.8% (n ¼ 8) and coinfection in 27.2% (n ¼ 3) of these positive samples (totaling 14 viruses). Of postoperative nasopharyngeal secretions, the positivity was less-in only 13.9% of samples (n ¼ 5) was a respiratory virus isolated: coinfection in 60% (n ¼ 3) and single virus infection in 40% (n ¼ 2; ►Table 1). From the 14 respiratory viruses identified in preoperative nasopharyngeal secretions, 50% were rhinovirus (n ¼ 7), present in 19% of 36 samples tested. In adenoid tissue, respiratory viruses were identified in 14, and the most frequent virus found was bocavirus, present in 11% of samples (n ¼ 4), corresponding to 28.6% of the virus isolated. In nasopharyngeal secretions collected after surgery, only 8 respiratory viruses were identified, of which 25% (n ¼ 2) were adenoviruses, present in 6% of samples. Considering all 36 respiratory viruses isolated in 108 samples evaluated, the main agent isolated was rhinovirus (27.8%), followed by bocavirus (22.2%). Other viruses isolated with a lower frequency were adenovirus (11.1%), enterovi-ruses (8.3%), parechovirus (8.3%), coronavirus HKU (5.6%), parainfluenza virus 4 (5.6%), influenza A (2.8%), coronavirus 43 (2.8%), coronavirus 229 (2.8%), and metapneumovirus A/B (2.8%). The respiratory syncytial virus was not isolated in the samples (►Table 2).
