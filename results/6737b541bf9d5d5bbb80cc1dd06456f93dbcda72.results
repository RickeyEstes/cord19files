Bovine TLR pyrosequencing, SNP detection, variant validation, and haplotype inference For 96 elite bovine sires representing 31 domestic cattle breeds (B. t. taurus; B. t. indicus; and composites), we generated and purified 81 amplicons targeting all 10 bovine TLR genes (n = 7,776 total amplicon targets; see methods). The majority of the amplicons were pooled (n = 6,816) to form a normalized fragment library (Table S1 ) which was subjected to a workflow involving Roche 454 Titanium pyrosequencing with downstream variant detection using the Neighborhood Quality Standard algorithm as recently described [29] , and the remaining purified amplicons (n = 960) were analyzed by standard dye-terminator cycle sequencing (Sanger) with alignment-based variant detection [23] [24] [25] . Sanger sequencing was necessary for amplicons that were intolerant to the addition of 59 oligonucleotide barcodes for PCR amplification. In total, 474 variable sites were predicted from intragenic analyses of all sequence data, which included 212 previously validated SNPs [30] , 4 known insertion-deletion mutations (indels) [30] , and 258 new putative SNPs. Evaluation of the genic distributions of all newly predicted TLR variable sites detected within the pyrosequencing data revealed that$62% of the 258 new putative SNPs were located either within or immediately flanking homopolymer repeats. Nevertheless, to allow for inclusion of all possible SNPs in downstream analyses, we investigated all 474 variable sites via fluorescent allele-specific genotyping assays [30] . Collectively, we validated 280 biallelic TLR variants (276 SNPs + 4 indels; Table  S2 ) using custom genotyping assays applied to the sequencing discovery panel (n = 96 elite sires; 31 breeds), a panel of Holstein dairy cattle (n = 405; 3 herds), and a panel of purebred Angus beef cattle from a single herd (n = 48). Of the 276 validated SNPs, 71 were predicted to encode nonsynonymous substitutions (nsSNPs), and one was predicted to encode a nonsense mutation in bovine TLR5 (AA substitution R125*; SNP C2332T). For the validated SNPs detected via pyrosequencing (n = 244), we investigated the relationship between minor allele frequencies (MAFs) estimated from the analysis of pyrosequencing data, as compared to corresponding allele frequencies derived from individual fluorescent allele-specific genotyping assays, and found significant correlations across all 10 TLR genes (discovery panel; Table 1 ). Moreover, an analysis performed across all genes (n = 244 SNPs) revealed that there was little or no bias in the estimates of allele frequencies produced via targeted pyrosequencing (P = 0.999846; Ho: slope = 1; Figure 1 ). Collectively, 266 SNPs and 4 indels were successfully incorporated into 243 unique haplotypes via Bayesian reconstructions [30, 31] (Table 2) , which included one discrete haplotype carrying the putative TLR5 nonsense SNP. Ten SNPs (TLR2: 9431, 10047, 12121; TLR3: 3624, 3804, 5201, 6382; TLR4: 8166; TLR5: 1562, 1685; see Table S2 ) could not be incorporated into discrete haplotypes with best-pair phase probabilities$0.90. Summary data representing the total number of predicted haplotypes, number of cattle with phase probabilities$0.90, total number of variable sites with MAF#0.10, genic distributions of validated variable sites, size of the investigated regions, and average estimates of linkage disequilibrium (LD; r 2 ) between adjacent variable sites are depicted in Table 2 . Across all investigated loci (n = 549 cattle; 31 breeds), the MAF spectrum derived from allelespecific genotyping assays ranged from 0.001 to 0.498, with 64% of the validated SNPs possessing MAFs#0.10 ( Table 2) .
