We here present the complete nucleotide sequence of two contemporary HCoV-OC43 strains. The genome of both contemporary HCoV-OC43 strains encompasses 30723 nucleotides (excluding the 3V poly(A) tail), being 15 nucleotides shorter than the genome of the ATCC prototype strain (GenBank accession number AY391777). Furthermore, we here report the spike gene sequences of three additional 2003 HCoV-OC43 strains (HCoV-OC43 BE03 isolates 89996, 37767 and 84020) and two additional HCoV-OC43 strains from 2004 (HCoV-OC43 BE04 34364 and 36638). These sequences were deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers AY903454-AY903460. Pairwise sequence alignments demonstrate an overall genome similarity of 99.0% between the HCoV-OC43 ATCC prototype strain (AY391777) and the HCoV-OC43 BE03 strain as well as between the prototype strain and the BE04 strain. Complete genome sequence comparisons to the HCoV-OC43 ATCC prototype strain sequenced by St-Jean et al. (AY585228) and the Paris isolate (AY585229) show similar results: 99.0% identity is found between the BE03 strain and the ATCC strain (AY585228) as well as between the BE03 strain and the Paris isolate. For the HCoV-OC43 BE04 strain 98.9% similarity with the complete genome sequences of both the ATCC strain (AY585228) and the Paris isolate is found. The genetic divergence between the prototype and each of the contemporary HCoV-OC43 strains roughly corresponds to an evolutionary rate of about 2.7 Â 10 À4 nucleotide substitutions per site per year. The 2003 and 2004 HCoV-OC43 strains show 99.4% similarity throughout their complete genomes. When comparing the genome sequence data of the HCoV-OC43 ATCC (AY391777) and contemporary strains, several nucleotide deletions and insertions are observed in the 3Vpart of the genome (Fig. 1) . Some of these nucleotide deletions and insertions are common for both contemporary strains in reference to the prototype strain, while others are observed in only one of the strains compared to the prototype strain. Similarity percentages between the HCoV-OC43 BE03 and BE04 strains, the ATCC prototype strain and the HCoV-OC43 Paris isolate are calculated for the major open reading frames (ORFs) and their proteins (Table 1 ). In the 2003 strain, the lowest percentage of identities with the other HCoV-OC43 strains is found for the envelope protein (E) gene and the corresponding amino acid sequence. However, the low rate of similarity is not due to a high number of mutations but to a 6 nucleotide deletion at the 3Vend of the HCoV-OC43 BE03 E gene leading to the deletion of a stop codon. The ORF is thereby elongated until the next stop codon, which is present 14 base pairs (bp) downstream. The HCoV-OC43 BE03 E protein is therefore 4 amino acids longer than its HCoV-OC43 ATCC, BE04 and Paris counterparts. Sequencing of the E gene of the other HCoV-OC43 2003 strains demonstrated the same elongation of the E ORF. The S gene is the most polymorphic ORF, with nucleotide (and amino acid) identity percentages of 97.3% (96.2%) between the ATCC prototype strain (AY391777) and the BE03 strain, 97.1% (96.0%) between the Paris isolate and the BE03 strain, 97.0% (95.5%) for the prototype strain/BE04 pair, and 96.5% (95.2%) for the Paris/BE04 pair. SimPlot analysis of the complete genomes of the HCoV-OC43 BE03 and BE04 strains, the Paris isolate and the HCoV-OC43 ATCC strain (AY585228) in reference to the ATCC prototype strain (AY391777), also demonstrates for the BE03 and BE04 strains that the highest variability is found in the genome region containing the spike gene (Fig. 2 ). Most remarkably, the spike genes of the BE03 and BE04 strains, with detection dates only one year apart, show only 97.2% nucleotide and 96.9% amino acid similarity which corresponds to a total of 93 nucleotide variations leading to 34 amino acid changes, 15 nucleotide (or 5 amino acid) insertions in the BE03 strain spike gene and 9 nucleotide (or 3 amino acid) insertions in the BE04 strain spike gene. Out of 93 polymorphic nucleotides, 60 are located in the S1 subunit and these include 29 synonymous substitutions and 31 nonsynonymous substitutions leading to 23 amino acid changes. Nucleotide insertions and deletions are also exclusively found in the S1 subunit, which codes for the fragment of the spike glycoprotein that binds to its cellular receptor. The putative N-glycosylation pattern of the spike proteins of the contemporary strains also differs slightly between both strains and in comparison to that of the HCoV-OC43 prototype spike protein. There are 15 Fig. 2 . SimPlot analysis of complete genome sequence data of the HCoV-OC43 BE03, BE04, Paris, and ATCC (GenBank accession number AY585228) strains in reference to HCoV-OC43 ATCC strain GenBank accession number AY391777. Each point plotted is the percentage genetic distance within a sliding window of 600 bp wide, centered on the position plotted, with a step size of 100 bp. Each curve is a comparison between the genome of one of the strains and the reference genome of the ATCC HCoV-OC43 strain (AY391777). Among the strains sampled in the same year, a high degree of conservation is found in their spike genes: no more than 0.15% difference between the 2003 strains, and no more than 0.05% between the 2004 strains. A multiple sequence alignment of these sequence data and spike gene sequence data of HCoV-OC43 and of other group 2 coronaviruses, available in Genbank, is performed. Based on this alignment, a neighbor joining phylogenetic tree is constructed and evaluated by 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates (Fig. 3) . In the HCoV-OC43 branch, three phylogenetic clusters can clearly be demonstrated: the ATCC cluster, containing all ATCC strains as well as the Paris isolate, a second cluster containing all HCoV-OC43 BE03 strains, and a third cluster, in which all HCoV-OC43 BE04 strains are found. Molecular clock analysis is performed using the spike gene sequence data of HCoV-OC43 and BCoV strains for which the sampling date is known (Table 2) . A likelihood ratio test indicates that the molecular clock hypothesis, which assumes that the evolutionary rate is roughly constant among lineages, cannot be rejected for these serially sampled data (P = 0.62). Using a Bayesian coalescent approach, the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the HCoV-OC43 2003 and 2004 strains is estimated in 1971 with a 95% highest posterior density interval of 1962-1979. The evolutionary rate is estimated to be 3.5 Â 10 À4 substitutions per site per year (95% highest posterior density interval of 2.6 Â 10 À4 -4.5 Â 10 À4 ). In all 2003 and 2004 contemporary HCoV-OC43 strains, an important amino acid change, in reference to the ATCC strains, is present in the proteolytic cleavage site of the HCoV-OC43 S protein. Unlike the HCoV-OC43 ATCC prototype strain, in which this sequence is RRSRG, the contemporary strains have a G to R amino acid change in the last position, leading to an RRSRR motif. In the HCoV-OC43 ATCC prototype strain, the internal ORF (I) coding region contains a stop codon at position 29345, resulting in two potential coding regions of 60 amino acids and 115 amino acids. This stop codon is not present in the BE03 and BE04 strains, which have the capacity to code for a 207-amino acid protein.
