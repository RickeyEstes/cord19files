Selected results obtained in different measurement series and notes about each series are presented below. Case "I" refers to the door opening towards the negatively pressurized zone, while case"II" refers to the door opening towards the positively pressurized zone. Descriptions of the series and conclusions were prepared on the basis of visualization and observation of the smoke movement. Temperature during the measurements remained constant, therefore, the influence of the buoyant force on contamination movement through the door can be excluded. The door was opened manually and therefore small differences in velocity and time of door opening may have occurred. However, control measurements showed that these differences would not have been greater than 5%. Figs 4-9 shows the results for cases I and II and pressure difference: 2.5, 12.5 and 25 Pa.
