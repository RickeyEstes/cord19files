A schematic representation of the chip design used to represent the F. tularensis genome is depicted in Figure 5 . The F. tularensis LVS genome sequence defined our reference and was represented on chips A-E and the majority of chip F. Unique sequences present in strain SCHU S4, together with two plasmid sequences, were added to the remainder of chip F. Our chip design, based on sequence information from two strains, enables coverage of a large number of strains. Approximately 91% of the F. tularensis double-stranded unique genome can be resequenced with this design from strains belonging to holarctica (type B) and tularensis (type A) subtypes. Most array-based resequencing studies use purified PCR products rather than whole-genome DNA as described here. We wished to test whether, despite their additional complexity, genomic DNA samples could be reliably resequenced and what specific impediments might be encountered. Hybridization of a whole-genome sample on an Affymetrix Ã• resequencing array platform can lead to incorrect base calls due to a number of systematic effects. Most of these adverse effects were predictable and therefore could be accounted for through application of specific bioinformatic data processing. These effects, and the bioinformatic filters, are described in Materials and Methods section.
