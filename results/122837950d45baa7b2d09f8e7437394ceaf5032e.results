We found that the viruses divided into two distinct clusters with five subclusters, designated A1, A2, B1, B2-1, and B2-2 (figure 2). Cluster A included ten isolates mainly derived from Beijing (BJ) and Guangdong (GZ), which were characterised by mutations at nucleotide positions 230 and 731, resulting in aminoacid changes. Only three viruses in cluster A were from patients from Hong Kong (HKU-33867, CUHK-W1, and HKU-36; figure 2; http://image.thelancet.com/extras/ 03art5344webfigure1.pdf). Since these three patients were recently returned from Guangdong (table 1) and the incubation period of the disease ranges from 1 day to 14 days, all three probably acquired their infections in February directly from Guangdong, rather than from Hong Kong. 1, 18, 24 The other viruses from Hong Kong grouped together in cluster B, together with the virus sequences derived from the presumed index case for the outbreak in Hong Kong (HKU-33a/b), as well as viruses from Canada (Tor2), Singapore (eg, SIN2500), Germany (Frankfurt 1), Italy (HSR1), Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam (Urbani). An isolate from Zhejiang province of China (ZJ01) was also in this group. The initial nasopharyngeal aspirate collected from patient 1 (HKU-33) 7 days after onset of his illness had two distinct variants designated HKU-33a and HKU-33b, falling within subclusters B2-1 and B1, respectively, with a silent sequence variation at nucleotide position 1068 of the S1 region (C/T). Subsequent clinical samples from this patient contained one or other variant. HKU-33a was detected in a nasopharyngeal aspirate on day 9 and after death in liver and lung samples on day 25; HKU-33b was also detected in an endotracheal aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage sample on day 10. The viral sequences derived from cases directly linked to patient 1 (figure 1) were further subdivided into two subclusters B1 and B2 (figure 2). Viruses including HKU-39489, HKU-55, HKU-56, Urbani, and CUHK-Su10 18 were all grouped in cluster B1 in the same sublineage as HKU-33b. Tor2 was in cluster B2 in the same lineage as HKU-33a. Four viruses, BJ04, BJ02, M-55696, and A-67428, carried the characteristic residues of two subcluster prototypes and could not be efficiently classed in any of the subclusters; they were defined as subcluster transition viruses (figure 2). In total, 56 single nucleotide variations were identified within the S1 region of the 169 viruses analysed (from 168 patients, including 33a and b). 15 Comparisons were made with other virus isolates by full genome sequence alignment. Except for the Hong Kong and Guangdong samples, the index case or first uploaded sequence from other cities and countries was chosen. Nucleotides were numbered on the basis of the HKU-39849 full sequence. 9 Slash indicates that the sequence data are not available, and nucleotides highlighted in yellow are those that differ from the majority at the corresponding location. Only substitutions occurring in more than one virus are shown.
