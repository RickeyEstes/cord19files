The modelled 2009-2010 season Data from 19 countries or regions, with a total of 20 data sets (15 ILI and 5 ARI), were modelled. Most of the data came from sentinel surveillance systems, based in the voluntary notification of consultations in primary care, and expressed as cases per 100 000 population ( Table 1 ). The number of seasons used in each country varied from five in Kyrgyzstan (ILI), Romania (ILI and ARI) and Kazakhstan (ARI) to 15 in the Netherlands. Pre-epidemic thresholds per 100 000 population ranged from 25 (Ireland and Portugal) to 168 (Romania) for ILI data and from 189 (Kazakhstan) to 762 (Romania) for ARI data, showing the differences between the systems. Postepidemic thresholds were slightly different to pre-epidemics thresholds, most of the countries with a variation in a range of ±10%, with the exception of Castilla y Leó n (Spain), Hungary and Poland in which these differences were much higher ( Table 2) . The modelling results for the 2009-2010 epidemic, summarised in Table 2 , are also plotted by the countries. In Castilla y Leó n (Spain), where the method was primarily developed, MEM identified an epidemic period of 12 weeks and a pre-epidemic threshold of 71 cases per 100 000 population. The alert week (the first incidence rate above the epidemic threshold) in week 38 was the first week of the epidemic period detected by MEM. There was no detection lag, and no false alerts were observed prior to that week. However, 2 weekly rates of the epidemic period are located below the post-epidemic threshold. The intensity of the 2009-2010 epidemic was moderated, peaking very much below the 90% level of historical epidemic values ( Figure 1B) . In countries with similar sentinel surveillance systems, such as Belgium, Spain and Switzerland, the model also produced similar results. No false alerts or detection lags were observed, and the duration of the epidemics was 10, 10 and 9 weeks, respectively. Their observed intensity remained below the 90% confidence interval. (Figure 1A,M,N) . Among the countries providing ARI data, Albania, Kazakhstan, Romania, Russian Federation and Ukraine (Figure 2) , the MEM produced high epidemic thresholds and reduced levels of intensity. The peaks of the 2009-2010 seasons exceeded the 95% confidence interval of the historical epidemic periods. The false alerts and timeliness results appeared quite similar to the ILI countries. In Albania (Figure 2A) , epidemic was detected 2 weeks after the start of the epidemic period, producing a detection lag according to the model. The overall sensitivity of the MEM thresholds across all countries providing data was 71AE8% ( Table 3 ). The sensitivity for countries reporting ILI was slightly higher (75AE7%) than for countries reporting ARI (60AE1%), and this difference is borderline significant (P = 0AE06). The MEM provided over 90% sensitivity in detecting the epidemic period in Belgium and Switzerland. Sensitivity was lowest in Ireland and Norway (ILI data), and in Albania, Romania and Ukraine (ARI data).
