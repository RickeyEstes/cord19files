Forty newborn Holstein bull calves were enrolled in this study. No differences in mortality was observed: 2 calves in the SB-300 group and 1 calf in the CTR group (P = 0.38) were euthanized due to septicemia. Birth weight did not differ between CTR (37.6 kg, 95% CI: 37.4-38.4) and SB-300 (37.7 kg, 95% CI: 37.4-38.4). Serum IgG quantification was performed on d 2 of life, and no differences were found between calves in the CTR group (12.3 g/L, 95% CI: 11.6-13.0) and SB-300 group (12.1 g/L, 95% CI: 11.4-12.8). Additionally, no differences were found for baseline fecal DM between treatment groups (P = 0.55, Table 1 ).
