From comparison of protein sequences, peptidases can be clustered in 261 different families, comprising 16 families of aspartic peptidases, two families of glutamic peptidases, 96 families of cysteine peptidases, 76 families of metallopeptidases, 53 families of serine peptidases, six families of threonine peptidases, two families of mixed catalytic type and 10 families of unknown catalytic type. In addition, there are 10 families of asparagine lyases. Family names are taken from the MEROPS website and database [8] , but when first mentioned in the text below, the name of the type example peptidase from that family is shown in parenthesis. Supplementary Table 1 shows an alphabetical list of families of proteolytic enzymes and the number of phyla in each organism kingdom with homologues from that family. For simplicity, we have adopted a five kingdom system for eukaryotes (animals, plants, fungi, chromists and protozoa). However, because presence in a phylum may be the result of horizontal gene transfer, and absence the result of gene loss, it cannot be assumed that the peptidase gene was present or absent in the ancestor of that phylum. On the assumption that gene loss is as likely as horizontal gene transfer, a gene is assumed to have been present in the ancestor of the kingdom only if it is present in half or more of the phyla in that kingdom. Kingdoms in which half or more of the phyla contain a homologue from a peptidase family are highlighted in yellow in Supplementary Table 1 . Because the number of candidate phyla for bacteria is so high (77 out of 120 phyla), and there is doubt about the completeness of any genome from a candidate phylum, the criteria for presence in the ancestral bacterium is presence in half or more of non-candidate phyla (more than 22 phyla).
