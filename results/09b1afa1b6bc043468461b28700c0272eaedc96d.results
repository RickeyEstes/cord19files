The results of the regressions on Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories are shown in Table 3 . Since Distance to IC and Distance Dummy 1/0 were alternately incorporated into the regressions to test the linear and non-linear spatial relations with office prices, a pair of models are comparably reported with overall fitness (Rsquared = 0.685-0.771) and F-statistics (p < 0.001). Note that spatial fixed effects (unobservable district characteristics) appeared more significantly on the TPU scale on Hong Kong Island and on the DC scale in Kowloon and the New Territories. For unbiased estimates, we checked the potential of multicollinearity problems among independent variables with a correlation matrix and variance inflation factors (VIFs) < 5.0 by territorial division. Most of the independent variables Island. The coefficients obtained from these log-linear regressions can be read as elasticities, which indicate the relative sensitivity of office unit prices to marginal changes in the right-hand side predictors, including Distance to IC and Traffic at IC.
