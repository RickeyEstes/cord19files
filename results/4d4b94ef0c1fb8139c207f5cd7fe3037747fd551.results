PBMCs from non-pregnant women have a robust IFN response to H1N1pdm09 infection, which is reduced in pregnant women PBMCs from pregnant and non-pregnant women were cultured with a strain of influenza isolated during the 2009 swine flu pandemic (H1N1pdm09) or cultured in media only. PBMCs from non-pregnant women demonstrated a robust IFN-α (14,787 pg/mL, 95% CI 7311-22,264 pg/mL) and IFN-λ (1486 pg/mL, 95% CI 756-2216 pg/mL) response to H1N1pdm09 ( Fig. 1A -C,) compared to media alone after 48hours of exposure. Conversely, PBMCs from pregnant women, following H1N1pdm09 stimulation, produced significantly less IFN-α ( Fig. 1A ) (3661pg/mL, 95% CI 2382-4939 pg/mL) and IFN-λ ( Fig. 1B) (558 pg/mL, 95% CI 407-710 pg/mL) compared to PBMCs from non-pregnant women (p<0.0001 and p<0.001, respectively). However, this was not the case with IFN-γ (691 pg/mL, 95% CI 340-1043 pg/mL) (Fig. 1C) . Treatment of PBMCs from non-pregnant women treated with syncytin-1 prior to infection with H1N1pdm09 reduced IFN responses, to levels similar to those in PBMCs from pregnant women PBMCs from non-pregnant women were pre-treated with 1 μM syncytin-1 and then cultured with H1N1pdm09 or media only. This dose of syncytin-1 was selected by performing a dose response on a range of biologically relevant doses (1nM to 5 μM). 1μM had the ability to reduce IFN-α and IFN-λ and induce IL-10 (S1 A-C Fig.) . Cytotoxicity of syncytin-1 has also previously been measured and confirmed to have no effect on cell viability or cytokine release [9] . Furthermore, the syncytin-1 preparation technique did not result in any endotoxin in the final protein. Using size exclusion chromatography we were able to separate syncytin-1 into two major peaks, one corresponding to a low level oligomerization and another as a multimeric complex. The multimeric peak corresponds to the bioactive conformation of the protein and has been used in all experiments. The low level oligomerization peak was also used but found not to be bioactive. The addition of syncytin-1 significantly reduced IFN-α (6083 pg/ mL, 95% CI 2848-9319 pg/mL) and IFN-λ responses (539 pg/mL, 95% CI 255-823 pg/mL) (p<0.001 Fig. 1A-B) . In fact treatment with syncytin-1 induced a response from these cells that mirrored what was seen in PBMCs from pregnant women with infection alone (H1N1 PNV) (Fig. 1A-C) . PBMCs from non-pregnant women treated with syncytin-1 prior to infection have a heightened IL-10 response H1N1pdm09 infection alone did not induce an IL-10 response from either pregnant or nonpregnant PBMCs when compared to media (Fig. 2) (75 pg/mL, 95 CI 34-114 pg/mL). However, there was a substantial increase in IL-10 in non-pregnant PBMCs with pre-treatment with syncytin-1, p<0.0001 (372 pg/mL, 95% CI 230-514 pg/mL). The plasmacytoid DCs are the source of the released IFN-α/λ and IL-10 in response to H1N1pdm09 We then used flow cytometry and surface staining to identify the cells responsible for the observed responses. The DC lineage was identified as CD3-/HLA-DR+, and PBMCs were further characterised as plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) (CD123+) or myeloid DCs (mDCs) (Fig. 3A) . Intracellular cytokine staining of the pDC population showed that pDCs were responsible for the release of IFN-α. The pDCs had increases in the percentage of IFN-α positive cells in the presence of H1N1pdm09 compared to media (Fig. 3B Panel 1 and 3) . While the addition of syncytin-1 and H1N1pdm09, reduced pDC IFN-α expression (Fig. 3B Panel 2) . Furthermore, intracellular cytokine staining of the CD4 lymphocytes showed that the CD4+ population was responsible for the release of IFN-γ, with the percentage of positive cells reduced in the presence of syncytin-1 (S2A Fig.) , though, at the early time-point of assessment, the release was small. Intracellular cytokine staining of the pDC population also showed that these cells were responsible for the increased release of IL-10 in the presence of H1N1pdm09 when compared to were then subjected to surface and intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry to determine cell populations and cytokine release. The pDC population was determined using CD3-/CD45+ cells which were also HLA-DR+ and CD123+ (A). This population was analysed for cytokine release using intracellular media (Fig. 3C Panel 1 and 3) . While the combination of syncytin-1 and H1N1pdm09, further increased pDC expression of IL-10 ( Fig. 3C Panel 2) . Although the majority of the IL-10 was from pDCs, there was also a small amount expressed by CD4 TReg cells (S2B Fig.) . To confirm that these pDCs were active, surface expression of CD86 and HLA-DR were measured. Infection with H1N1pdm09 increased the expression of HLA-DR and CD86 (Fig. 3D) . This expression was further amplified with syncytin-1 pre-treatment.
