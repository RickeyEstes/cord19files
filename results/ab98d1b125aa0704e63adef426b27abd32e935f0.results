We used the ViSeq method to analyze 20 fecal samples from HIV-1 infected individuals. An overview of the analysis process is presented in Figure 1 . A modified VIDISCA method was used to harvest protected nucleic acid from the fecal material and to convert any RNA to cDNA using random-primed reverse transcription [19] [20] . The cDNA was converted into dsDNA and after phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the cDNA was processed by shearing and adapter ligation into an Illumina library and subjected to MiSeq deep sequencing. The resulting sequences were processed to remove adapter sequences and trimmed from the 39 end to a median Phred value of 30, resulting in a median value of 1.5610 6 reads/sample. Raw sequencing data was trimmed to remove low quality reads, analyzed for content using SLIM (Figure 2 , see below) and subjected to de novo assembly followed by SLIM for additional content identification. Sample details and the yield of sequence data are provided in Table 1 .
