Synthetic genomics generated bat-influenza virus-like particles but they were not infectious in many host cell substrates Lack of infectious particles in the original bat specimens is a potential factor in the inability to isolate/culture bat-influenza using multiple host cell substrates [3] . Based on digital sequence information published by Tong et al. [3] , we synthesized the complete genome of A/little yellow-shouldered bat/Guatemala/ 164/2009 (H17N10) (Fig. S1 ) and cloned it into reverse genetics plasmids to rescue this putative bat-influenza virus (Bat09). Thousands of spherical influenza-like particles budded into the supernatants of human cells (293T) transfected with the Bat09 reverse genetics plasmids (Fig. 1A) . The supernatants were inoculated into embryonated chicken eggs and cell lines derived from many species (canine (MDCK), mink (Mv1-Lu), swine (ST), African green monkey (Vero), human (A549, Calu-3), and freetailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis, Tb1Lu); however, none of the host cell substrates tested supported productive virus infection (determined by serial passage and subsequent real-time RT-PCR).
