The application of immunofluorescence microscopy and PCR techniques on 274 alpaca faecal samples showed that 137 animals (50.0%) were infected by Giardia spp. and 12 animals by Cryptosporidium spp. (4.4%) ( Table 1 ). In 10 of these samples (3.6%), co-infection by both pathogens was found. Giardia was detected in 11/12 herds examined (91.7%), with intra-herd prevalence ranging from 18.2% to 75%. The intensity of infection varied between 1.0 and 2.7. Although Giardia was detected in animals as young as 1 week, the prevalence and the intensity of infection increased with age reaching 80% and 2.8, respectively, at 8 weeks. Prevalence values of 50% and 20% were observed in animals 10 weeks and older than 10 weeks of age, respectively, but at lower intensities of infection. No statistically significant differences in prevalence and intensity of infection were observed in relation to breed, sex, or the existence of diarrhoeic process. By PCR amplification of fragments of the ssu-rRNA and ␤-giardin genes, 92 of the 274 analysed samples (33.6%) were positive for Giardia. Sequencing of amplicons showed the existence of G. duodenalis assemblage A in 67 samples; G. duodenalis assemblage E in 24 samples; and in one sample there was an inconsistency between the two molecular markers used. For the amplified fragment of the ssu-rRNA gene, 6 sequences were observed, two matched others deposited in GenBank and 4 were new sequences (one close to G. duodenalis assemblage A and 3 close to G. duodenalis assemblage E) (Fig. 1) . For the amplified fragment of the ␤-giardin gene, 3 sequences were observed, one corresponding to G. duodenalis assemblage A and two to G. duodenalis assemblage E. All sequences showed several SNPs with respect to the sequences deposited in GenBank (Fig. 2) . Faecal samples containing both G. duodenalis assemblages A and E were detected in 5 herds, whereas 5 herds contained only assemblage A and one herd had only assemblage E. Overall, G. duodenalis assemblage A was identified in a higher percentage of samples (73.6%). No significant differences were observed in relation to breed, sex or the presence of diarrhoeic processes. Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were observed by immunofluorescence microscopy in 12 faecal samples (4.4%) from animals aged ≥5 weeks belonging to 7 herds (58.3%) ( Table 1) . Intra-herd prevalence ranged from 2.9% to 13.6%, and the intensity of infection was very low (<1 oocyst per field). By amplification of a fragment of the ssu-rRNA, C. parvum was identified in two samples and C. ubiquitum in one sample (Fig. 3) .
