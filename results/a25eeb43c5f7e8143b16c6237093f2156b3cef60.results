Specificity of the ELISA with antisera from immunized rabbits and mice Twofold dilutions of sera from mice or rabbits immunized with six different Chlamydia-related bacteria belonging to four distinct families have been tested (1/256 to 1/2048 for mice sera and 1/8000 to 1/64 000 for rabbits sera). Waddlia chondrophila immunized mice or rabbits gave a strong signal in ELISA (OD 492nm %3 for the highest concentration of the serum, as shown in Fig. 1a and b) . Sera from animals immunized with the five other Chlamydia-related bacteria did not exhibit significant cross-reactivity with proteins from Waddlia. Only the specific S. negevensis mice anti-sera showed some cross-reaction whereas the homologous rabbit anti-sera did not. As expected, all pre-immune sera did not display anti-Waddlia reactivity. Comparison of two protocols of MIF and validation of the ELISA MIF is the reference standard in chlamydial serology. In this work, two different protocols of MIF were compared. A MIF protocol based on heat-inactivated bacteria (hereafter called 'h-MIF') and read at a magnification of 9400 was compared to a MIF protocol using formalin-inactivated bacteria (hereafter called 'f-MIF') read at a magnification of 91000. In a previous study, 95 samples of serum taken from British women tested with the h-MIF [5] , were tested in this work by the f-MIF. The number of positive, negative or doubtful serology for W. chondrophila is summarized in Table 1 . The number of doubtful results was 1.4 times higher with the h-MIF compared with the f-MIF. When comparing results of the f-MIF with the h-MIF, the overall correlation was 39% considering positive, negative and doubtful sera. Fig. S1 illustrates the validation of the ELISA using both MIFs as a reference standard. In Fig. S1a , sera from British women which tested positive and negative with both MIFs (n = 32) were analysed by the ELISA. The results indicated that the ELISA was able to discriminate between positive and negative sera. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the ELISA, ROCs were calculated using the OD 492nm values obtained with positive and negative sera according to the h-MIF or the f-MIF (Fig. S1b) . The mean area under the ROC for h-MIF or f-MIF (Fig. S1b ) was 0.968 AE 0.012 and 0.967 AE 0.010, respectively. These values close to 1 showed the high performance of the ELISA. The statistical analysis using the unpaired t test demonstrated that MIF-based negative and positive human sera were significantly discriminated by the ELISA (p value <0.0001 for both MIFs). Considering OD 492nm values that gave 100% specificity, the ROCs proposed cut-offs corresponding to the highest sensitivity. Overall, five and eight independent experiments of ROC were performed for h-MIF and f-MIF, respectively. The calculated OD 492nm cut-off for the ELISA based on the h-MIF gave a mean sensitivity of 71.7 AE 11.3%. For the ELISA based on the f-MIF, the optimal cut-off gave a mean sensitivity of 86.6 AE 3.0%. For each experiment, the optimal determined cut-offs were applied on all the 95 sera tested with the ELISA and each serum was classified according to the serological results obtained with the h-MIF (Fig. S1c) or with the f-MIF (Fig. 2) . In the ELISA based on the f-MIF, mean OD 492nm values increased when the score of the MIF increased. With 100% specificity for the ELISA based on both MIF, the sensitivity of the ELISA was higher when based on the f-MIF (Fig. S1b ). The f-MIF was thus chosen as the best reference standard to calculate OD 492nm cut-offs for the ELISA in the subsequent experiments. All 'doubtful low' sera taken from British women were also used to define a high threshold. Thus, the calculated cut-off using the ROC and the high threshold determine a grey zone ( Fig. S1c and Fig. 2 ). The sera with OD 492nm values above, inside or below this grey zone were then considered in the next experiments as positive, doubtful or negative, respectively. Application of the ELISA to sera from children with or without pneumonia Sera from children with (n = 189) or without (n = 175) pneumonia were tested with the new ELISA (Fig. 3) . Sera from British women were included in each experiment as internal controls and in order to calculate a ROC and to define a grey zone. Results from three independent experiments are summarized in Table 2 . Among the children with or without pneumonia, Waddlia seropositivity above the grey zone (i.e. positive) was observed in seven (3.7%) and six (3.4%) patients, respectively. The analysis of the sera at day 14 for children with pneumonia showed that one patient exhibited a seroconversion. The clinical characteristics of the 13 positive patients are indicated in Table S1 . The aetiology of the pneumonia was identified for two patients (Streptococcus pneumoniae and rhinovirus A, respectively) whereas the other five positive patients remained with unknown aetiology (Table  S1 ). Furthermore, 17.5% and 19.4% of the patients with and without pneumonia, respectively, exhibited antibody reactivity in the grey zone corresponding to a doubtful seropositivity. Overall, these results indicated no significant difference between ill and control children for high positivity (odds ratio Using MS analysis on the enriched fraction of sarkosyl insoluble proteins, 617 proteins were identified (Table S2) . Among these proteins, 328 were identified with more than four matched spectra providing sufficient confidence for subsequent analysis. The relative abundance of the proteins was roughly estimated based on the theoretical and observed number of peptide generated after trypsin digestion of each protein and the 40 most abundant proteins are represented in Fig. 4 . Among these 40 most abundant proteins, 11 corresponded to membrane proteins or proteins associated to the membrane: proteins of the outer membrane protein (OMP) family (OmpA11, A2, A3, A7, A10, A1, A4), proteins with predicted transmembrane domains such as the three putative membrane proteins wcw_1100, wcw_1236 and wcw_1644, and the putative long-chain fatty acid transport protein FadL with a predicted peptide signal. Three other proteins identified in the present work were previously shown to be immunogenic proteins [12] using a different approach: the elongation factors FusA and Tuf and, by homology, GroEL2. The putative needle chaperone SctG was also detected and is associated with the type III secretion system inserted in the bacterial membrane. Polymerases (RpoA and B) and ribosomal proteins as well as proteins of metabolic pathways were also recovered. Finally, six other proteins are putative uncharacterized proteins. Considering the relative abundance of each identified protein, five proteins appeared to be predominant: OmpA11, OmpA2, OmpA3, as well as the putative uncharacterized proteins wcw_1930 and wcw_11100 (Fig. 4) .
