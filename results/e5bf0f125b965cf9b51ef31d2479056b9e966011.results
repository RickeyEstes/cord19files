The results revealed 11 unusual cases, which showed characteristics of CRF12_BF (n = 2) and CRF14_BG (n = 8), and one that could not be classified into an existing subtype/ CRF, along with three cases of CRF01_AE. Antiviral drug resistance analysis (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/ ADRA/adra2.html) showed no special drug resistance mutations in the pol sequences. In addition, since six samples were epidemiologically linked (MO007, MO021, MO106, MO108, MO112, MO113), one of the samples, MO108, was subtyped by REGA subtyping tool after whole genome sequencing ( Figure 2 ). In the figure, it can be seen that it is a triple recombinant BFG. Except for the three CRF01_AE sequences probably originated from the same Southeast Asian region, the sequences derived from subtypes BG and BF recombinants have not been previously reported in any other Asian cities, including the neighboring areas of Hong Kong and Mainland China. 5 To study the possible geographical origins of these sequences, a BLAST search was performed and the GenBank records and literature of the matches were studied. Samples MO008 and MO009, from two Portuguese manifesting characteristics of subtype G matched with sequences from Spain and Portugal; whereas the monophyletic group similar to CRF12_BF (MO007, MO021, MO106, MO108, MO111, MO112, MO113 and MO114) matched with sequences mainly from Brazil and a few from Europe (Supplementary Table) . The high query coverage and high similarity in gag and pol regions of MO008 and MO009 suggested that the year of first HIV-positive diagnosis was around 2000, which is in concordance with our records. Sample MO010 shared characters of both BF and BG recombinants -its gag shared some similarity with that of MO008, while its pol and env shared some similarity with MO108, implying a recombination event.
