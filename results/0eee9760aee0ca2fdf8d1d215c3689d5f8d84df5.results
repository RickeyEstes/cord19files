From January 21 to February 15, 2020, based on epidemiological evidence, fever and/or respiratory symptoms, chest radiological findings and blood white blood cell (WBC) results, physicians at the Fever Clinic referred 156 cases to panel discussion by multi-discipline experts. After discussion, 110 were considered to be possible or probable cases of COVID-19, and received 2019-nCoV real-time PCR testing, which was positive in 19 cases (confirmed cases). In another 2 patients, though PCR testing was negative, a clinical diagnosis was made according to epidemiological evidence, consistent clinical and CT findings (clinical cases). These 21 cases were grouped as COVID-19 for this analysis. For the remaining cases with negative viral detection, the diagnosis of COVID-19 was excluded based on inconsistent epidemiological, clinical or radiological data. Among these, 22 were excluded from the analysis because of lack of CT scan or no signs of pneumonia on CT scan, and finally 67 patients with pneumonia of other etiologies were included for analysis as the non-COVID-19 group (see patient selection flowchart in Figure 1 ). In the study period, 2123 patients visited the Fever Clinic because of fever and/or respiratory symptoms, and 342 patients were diagnosed to have pneumonia based on CT scan or in a few cases on Chest X-ray. The prevalence of COVID-19 in all these pneumonia patients was 6.14% (21/342). The prevalence of COVID-19 in cases with CT-confirmed pneumonia sent for 2019-nCoV testing was 23.9% (21/88). The demographics and baseline characteristics of the 21 patients with COVID-19 were shown in Table 1 . The median age was 42.0 years (25th-75th percentile, 34.5-66.0 years). Men and women were equally affected. Nineteen patients (90.5%) had a clear epidemiological history All rights reserved.

Seven patients, from 5 family clusters, had close contact with their family members. In the two patients with unclear epidemiological link, one was a social worker contacting a high-flow of people and his wife was confirmed to have COVID-19 by positive 2019-nCoV test about one week later. The other one had no epidemiological history on presentation, but another patient, who had had dinner with him, was also diagnosed to have COVID-19 later. An incubation period was elicited from 12 patients (57.1%), ranging from 2 to 10 days with a median of 6.5 days. Most of the patients were mild-moderate in disease severity (mild-moderate cases, n=18, 85.7%). Three patients were classified as severe cases with SpO 2 â‰¤ 93% on presentation, while no very severe cases were identified in our series. On presentation, most patients (85.7%) had fever with a mean body temperature of 37.8 o C. Cough (42.9%), expectoration (33.3%), fatigue (57.1%), headache or dizziness (38.1%) were common symptoms. Other symptoms included shortness of breath, myalgia or arthralgia, sore throat, nasal symptoms and diarrhea ( Blood routine showed that decreased lymphocyte count was present in 38.1% of the COVID-19 patients. More than 80% of COVID-19 patients had normal WBC and neutrophil counts. Compared with COVID-19 patients, the total WBC and neutrophil counts were higher in non-COVID-19 patients. Additionally, more non-COVID-19 patients had higher than normal WBC and neutrophil counts. However, lymphocyte counts and the proportions of patients with decreased lymphocytes were not statistically different between the two groups (Table 3 ). In non-COVID-19 patients, infiltrates on the CT scan mainly involved 1-2 lung lobes, while in COVID-19 patients, lesions involving 4-5 lobes were more common. In COVID-19 patients, lung lesions were mostly peripheral or sub-pleural in distribution, and in severe cases were diffusely distributed (Figure 2 ). In non-COVID-19 patients, 34.3% showed airway-dominant lesions, while diffuse distribution was found in only 4.5%. The patterns of the lesions showed no significant difference between the two groups. However, centrilobular nodules were observed in non-COVID-19 patients but not in COVID-19 patients (Table 4 ).
