Design of automated HTS assay platform. We implemented an automated platform (Fig. 1) , which took advantage of the homogeneous assay format and ATP/luminescence readout. Small-footprint liquid handlers and reagent dispensers allowed the use of our existing biosafety cabinets. Minimal change to current laboratory space was needed. User-friendly software and custom-written scripts helped the end user in the steep learning curve. A significant component of this platform was the use of the SOLO single-channel robotic workstation and the Bravo Liquid Handling Platform, both of which allowed miniaturisation of the assay from the 300 μL-96-well to the 30 µL-384-well format. This reduced reagent cost and facilitated HTS. Small volume transfers and 384-well serial dilutions were performed with greater accuracy and precision than manual transfers, without the concern of user error (data not shown). Assay optimisation. We explored the optimisation of the automated assay ( Fig. 1 ) with acceptable accuracy, precision and sensitivity that would be amenable to a high-throughput setting. Accuracy expresses the closeness of agreement between the value accepted as either a conventional true value or an accepted reference value, and the actual measured value. It is typically measured as percent coefficient of variation (%CV). The accuracy was determined by replicate analysis of samples containing a known concentration of rupintrivir. Food and Drug Administration guidelines recommend that the %CV should be within +/−15% at all concentrations (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ucm070107.pdf). Precision describes the closeness or scatter of individual measures of an analyte obtained for replicate samplings of a homogeneous sample. It is typically measured as %CV. The %CV should be within +/−15% at all 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ concentrations, except for the lower limit of quantitation, where it should not exceed 20% of the CV. (http://www. fda.gov/downloads/ucm070107.pdf). Sensitivity is defined as the lowest concentration that can be measured with an acceptable limit of accuracy and precision (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ucm070107.pdf). optimisation of cell density. Cell seeding density in 384-well plates was optimised to prevent possible cell overgrowth, which may affect assay sensitivity, and to establish a consistently strong luminescent signal. RD (human rhabdomyosarcoma) cells were seeded in the 384-well microplates at different densities (Fig. 2) . The cells were allowed to grow for 72 hours post-seeding, and cell viability was evaluated by adding the ATPlite reagent and reading the luminescence signal. A cell density of 5000 RD cells/well was chosen for the assay because this density gave a consistent and strong luminescence signal, with a good signal-to-background ratio (S/B) ratio and low variability (Fig. 2) . Optimal densities for Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells and HeLa (human cervical adenocarcinoma) cells were determined in a similar manner and using the same optimal seeding density. optimisation of virus titre. Virus stocks were titrated to determine the dilution that gave optimal sensitivity in the assay. For each virus, the titre was determined by the endpoint dilution method using half-log dilutions in 96-well microplates. A panel of enterovirus and parechovirus strains was established with cell selection and incubation times based on previous experiments 18 . Twelve-point, half-log 10 serial dilutions of each virus (Fig. 3 ) were made to determine the starting dilution for use in the automated 384-well assay and to ensure a full dynamic range of the CPE. The starting virus dilutions were selected based on the initial linear portion of the curve for each virus. To induce CPE in at least 80% of the cells, a viral dilution of 100 CCID 50 was used. Validation of automated assay for use in HTS. We evaluated whether the automated assay was suitable for use in a high-throughput setting. The liquid handling instrumentation was configured and the assay robustness was determined using the Z′-factor 19 . The Z′-factor is a coefficient that takes into account the assay signal dynamic range and data variability. Assays with a Z′-factor ≥ 0.5 are considered robust for HTS 19 . During assay development, we defined the optimal assay parameters, including cell density, linear range of detection, Z′-factor [Zʹ = 1 − 3 (SD DMSO + SD compound )/|mean DMSO − mean compound |], %CV [SD (signal)/average (signal) × 100], and S/B (fold-increase) [signal (cell control)/background (virus control)]. Lower %CV and higher S/B values can contribute to increased assay robustness. Our assay demonstrated robustness, with a high degree of reproducibility, low deviation (including a reproducible Z′-factor between 0.75 and 0.82), and a %CV between 0.33 and 1.45, with S/B ratios ranging from 6.92 to 22.6 ( Fig. 4 ) when using different EV-A71 isolates ( Table 1 ). The additional viruses tested also met these criteria for robustness, with similar results obtained (data not shown).
