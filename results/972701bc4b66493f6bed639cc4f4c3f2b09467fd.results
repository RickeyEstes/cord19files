The cumulative incidence of diarrhea was significantly ( p < 0.005) reduced in all three egg-powder groups (14.3-15.1% of the calves) compared with the control group (38.8%). The average duration of diarrhea in the control group (3.5 days, sd 1.3) was significantly higher than in the egg-powder groups (2 g egg powder (n = 56) 2.0 days (sd 0.0, p < 0.001); 4 g egg powder (n = 53) 2.8 days (sd 1.8, p < 0.05); 8 g egg powder (n = 55), 2.3 days (sd 0.5, p < 0.05)). Furthermore, 26.3% of the calves in the control group had to receive an antibiotic and liquid-electrolyte treatment. Nevertheless, 8.8% of the calves in the control group died as a result of diarrhea, whereas only 12.5%, 9.1% ( p < 0.05), and 12.5% ( p < 0.05) of the calves in the 2 g, 4 g, and 8 g egg-powder groups, respectively, required additional treatment measures and only one calf died. Differences (by inspection) between the different egg-powder groups were not found (Table 1) . Table I Incidence risk and duration of diarrhea in the calves, in relation to the different test groups, in the period from birth to 14 days of life, together with the percental proportion of calves that were also treated with antibiotics and the mortality. The diagnoses were blind and the clinical treatments used for diarrhea were the same for all groups The daily increase in body weight during the first 14 days of life (Fig. 1) -a parameter which can be measured impartially-additionally reflects the conditions. The calves of the control group gained 2.4 kg (sd 1.2) on average during the first 2 weeks of life, whereas body weight gains of 3.5-3.9 kg were recorded for the calves of the egg-powder groups ( p < 0.0001). Fio -. I. Body weight gain of Turkish diary calves during the first 14 days of life. Egg powder containing antibody to rotavirus at different dosages was administered to some calves. The controls did not receive any egg powder. Bars indicate sd. In some of the calves the birth weight could be compared with the body weight after 3 months of life. The birth weight of all groups was between 38.2 kg and 38.8 kg (sd between 1.6 and 3.2) on average. After 3 months the calves in the control group weighed only 85.2 kg (sd 3.9) compared with the significantly higher weights in the egg-powder groups; these were 88.5 kg (sd 2.3, p < 0.001, 2 g egg powder), 89.5 kg (sd 3.6, p < 0.0001, 4 g egg powder), and 89.8 kg (sd 2.3, p < 0.0001, 8 g egg powder; Table  2 ). With regard to the pathogens routinely identified on Day 7 on this farm, intestinal rotavirus infections (38.1% of the calves) predominated. In the diarrheic calves, 78.2% of the calves showed rotavirus and 34.5% cryptosporidia in faecal samples before were recorded in 15.3% of the calves from the routine faecal samples on Day 7, and in 47.3% of the faecal samples of the diarrheic calves (Fig. 2) . Differences attributable to the breeds, which were similarly distributed among the groups, did not occur with any parameter (data not shown).
