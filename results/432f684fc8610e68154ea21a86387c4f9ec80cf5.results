Airborne bioburden monitoring over 10 h in patientoccupied isolation rooms Ten-hour monitoring of patient-occupied isolation rooms took place on three separate sampling days from 08:00 to 18:00 h. The first case study ( Figure 1a ) involved a 71-year-old male patient, who had undergone partial pancreatectomy for cancer and multi-organ failure, who occupied the room for 8 days prior to commencement of air monitoring. Results (Table I) The results of a second case study ( Figure 1b ) were generated in a room which housed a 37-year-old male patient with severe community-acquired pneumonia who had occupied the room for 7 days prior. A mean value of 44.1 (SD 36.1) cfu/m 3 was recorded. The patient was mobile, talking and subsequently transferred from ICU after completion of the study. Airborne contamination levels remained low and consistent for most of the study (between 10 and 50 cfu/m 3 ) from 08:00 to 14:00 h, during which time room activity was minimal. The number of people entering the room was low (0e2) as the patient did not require 1:1 care for most of the period. Bioburden levels increased from 10 to 110 cfu/m 3 in response to the presence of a visitor at 14:00 h (Observation 25), and remained elevated until their departure (Observation 29 at 15:00 h). Significantly higher ('out-of-control') levels were observed when the patient was assisted out of bed, followed by the removal of the bed from the room. This group of activities occurred between 15:45 and 16:30 h (Observations 32e35) and resulted in an increase in air bioburden to 166 cfu/m 3 . A third study ( Figure 1c ) was conducted in a room occupied by a 75-year-old female patient, admitted to ICU with pneumonia and multi-organ failure, for 3 days. A mean airborne bacteria load of 48.8 (SD 20.5) cfu/m 3 was recorded, with a range of 20e116 cfu/m 3 . 'Out-of-control' levels occurred due to a high level of room activity during patient re-intubation, involving an increase from two to four staff within the room and a higher degree of physical movement around the patient's bed (Observation 9 at 10:00 h). Overall, airborne bioburden data ( Figure 1 ) demonstrate that there is significant variability (PÂ¼0.008) in airborne bacterial counts across the 10-h sampling period in all three independent case studies conducted in patient-occupied isolation room studies, regardless of patient scenario (Table I) .
