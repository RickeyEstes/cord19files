We enrolled a total of 558 healthcare workers into the study, of which 96% (537/558) had â‰¥1 follow-up blood sample; 6 participants were excluded because of missing follow-up review questionnaires, leaving 531 persons for analysis. Of these, 35 (6.6%) seroconverted. Table 1 compares selected characteristics of seroconverters and nonseroconverters. Seroconverters were sampled earlier than nonseroconverters (49% vs. 38% in the fi rst week of enrollment), and 86% of seroconverters had both followup samples compared with 81% of nonseroconverters, but these differences were not signifi cant (p = 0.20 and p = 0.73, respectively). Seroconverters were slightly more likely to have received seasonal infl uenza vaccine than were nonseroconverters (97% vs. 91%), but this difference was not signifi cant. There were no also signifi cant differences between seroconverters and nonseroconverters by age or gender. HI titers in baseline samples from nonseroconverters were higher than in baseline samples from seroconverters (GMT 7.8 vs. 5.9; p = 0.02). Among seroconverters, 63% and 51% reported having an ARI and FRI episode, respectively, and only 15% and 8% of nonseroconverters reported having an ARI and FRI episode, respectively (p<0.01 for both). Most of our participants were nurses (290/531, 55%; Table 2 ); allied health staff, which included mostly participants from paramedical professions such as pharmacists, laboratory medicine technicians, physiotherapists and occupational therapists, formed the second largest group (116/531, 22%); ancillary and support staff, which included mainly hospital attendants and patient service associates, formed the next largest group (69/531, 13%); and administrative support staff (35/531, 7%) and doctors (21/531, 4%) made up the rest. Seroconversion rates were highest in nurses (28/290, 10%) and lowest in allied health staff (2/116, 2%). To facilitate interpretation, allied health staff were designated the reference group for computing ORs; only nurses had a signifi cantly higher odds of infection compared with allied health staff (OR 6.1, 95% CI 1.4-26.0; p = 0.02). Compared with those working in nonpatient care areas, participants whose primary work area was an inpatient ward had higher odds for seroconversion (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.5-3.5; p = 0.54), while those in other patient care settings had lower odds for seroconversion (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.2-1.5; p = 0.21), but neither result was signifi cant. Signifi cantly higher odds for seroconversion were also observed for participants whose primary work area was in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 isolation wards (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.5-15.6; p<0.01). Participants who had contact with patients who had pandemic (H1N1) 2009 had marginally but not significantly increased odds of seroconversion (OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.9-3.7; p = 0.10). Those who reported having contact with a sick colleague(s) whose illness was subsequently diagnosed as pandemic (H1N1) 2009 had signifi cantly increased odds of seroconversion (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.2-6.9; p = 0.02). Results of the univariate analysis for nonoccupational exposures are presented in the Figure. Healthcare workers from larger households had increased odds of seroconversion (OR 1.2 per additional household member, 95% CI 1.0-1.4; p = 0.04), but no discernible association was seen between seroconversion and having another healthcare worker in the same household or reporting another household member with ARI or FRI symptoms during the study. However, having a child or adolescent in the household increased the odds of seroconversion. In particular, significantly higher ORs were observed if the healthcare workers Table 3 . Being a nurse remained signifi cantly associated with increased odds of infection (OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.0-19.6; p = 0.05), as did having pandemic (H1N1) 2009 isolation wards as a primary work area (OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.3-15.6; p = 0.02). Contact with colleagues with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (OR 2.5, 95% CI 0.9-6.6; p = 0.06) and coming from a larger household (OR 1.2 per additional household member, 95% CI 1.0-1.4; p = 0.06) were of borderline signifi cance. Having higher HI titers in the baseline serum sample was protective (OR 0.5 per unit of increase, 95% CI 0.3-1.0; p = 0.05). In Table 4 , allied health participants are compared with nurses, the groups with the lowest and highest seroconversion rates respectively; the latter was further stratifi ed by whether they worked in inpatient wards (ward based vs. non-ward based). The proportion who seroconverted was slightly, but not signifi cantly, higher in ward-based nurses than in non-ward-based nurses (11% vs. 8%; p = 0.53). Ward-based nurses were from significantly larger households than the other 2 groups (p<0.01 vs. allied health, p = 0.01 vs. non-ward-based nurses). No signifi cant difference was found in the proportion who reported using face masks all or almost all of the time in patient care, but ward-based nurses were signifi cantly more likely to have had seasonal infl uenza vaccine than were allied health workers (p<0.01). Key differences were found in the mean number of contacts and occupational related factors. Non-ward-based nurses mostly worked in large areas, including operating theaters, the emergency department, and outpatient clinics, and hence had signifi cantly higher numbers of contacts than either ward-based nurses or allied health workers (p<0.01 on all measures). On the other hand, ward-based nurses were signifi cantly more likely to be in contact with patients with confi rmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (p<0.01 vs. non-ward-based and allied health), and allied health staff were signifi cantly less likely to be in contact with a sick colleague who had pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (p<0.01 vs. either nursing group).
