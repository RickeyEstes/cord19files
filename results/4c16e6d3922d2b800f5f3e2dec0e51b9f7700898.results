Aged neutrophils are cleared through activation of PrCR. During sterile or infection-induced peritonitis, immature neutrophils leave the bone marrow, infiltrate the inflammation site and mature there 29, 30 . These neutrophils are programmed to initiate age-dependent cell apoptotic processes, but to be phagocytosed by peritoneal macrophages before the explosive release of cellular contents that would cause inflammation; they burst inside of macrophages. We utilized a mouse model in which neutrophils are resistant to cell death by enforced expression of Bcl2 under the promoter MRP8 3,31 . In agreement with our previous findings using this animal model, we found after thioglycollate induced peritonitis, the Bcl2-expressing neutrophils were resistant to apoptosis but were removed from the peritoneum with the same temporal dynamics as WT neutrophils undergoing cell death (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 1b) . These data indicate that aged neutrophils are programmed to be removed through PrCR; therefore, recognition of such target cells by macrophages is independent of their cell death. We reasoned that both cell death and PrCR programs were activated in wild-type (WT) neutrophils to promote their removal in the peritoneum, while only PrCR was activated in the Bcl2-protected neutrophils (Fig. 1c) . To reveal potential pathways utilized by neutrophils to activate PrCR, we performed gene-expression profiling using RNAseq analysis to compare immature bone-marrow neutrophils to mature peritoneum-infiltrating neutrophils from WT and MRP8-Bcl2 mice ( Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1b) at the time the neutrophils are starting to be removed from the peritoneum. We identified 333 overlapping genes that are upregulated in both WT and Bcl-2-expressing neutrophils that are potentially involved in PrCR ( Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1c ). Gene ontology enrichment pathway analyses revealed enriched pathways for MAPK signaling cascade, response to stress, and immune system processes (Fig. 1e) . Cell surface CRT determines PrCR of viable aged neutrophils. We wondered whether modifications on the cell surface were changing to promote cell communication leading to PrCR. We evaluated the cell surface changes on neutrophils and macrophages for "eat me" and "don't eat me" signals, such as CRT and CD47, respectively, that regulate PrCR after thioglycollate injection into MRP8-Bcl2 mice (Fig. 2a, Fig. 1 Viable aged neutrophils are cleared through activation of program cell removal. a Analysis of neutrophil and macrophage cell populations after thioglycollate injection to WT and MRP8-Bcl2 mice.

RNAseq analysis was performed on 4 groups of neutrophils, as described in d. RNAseq analysis was used to identify genes upregulated in the maturation process (BM to peritoneum) in both WT and MRP8-Bcl2 mice, which are likely associated with susceptibility to PrCR NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05211-7 ARTICLE with their cell surface expression of CRT, but not CD47 ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2a) . Interestingly, the cell surface levels of CRT increased on the neutrophils over time which correlated with the loss of neutrophils in the peritoneum. These data indicated that the cell surface was dynamically changing over time for PrCR to occur by promoting CRT accumulation on the neutrophil. To test this we isolated macrophages and neutrophils after thioglycollate injection over a period of time and determined the capacity of the cells to bind recombinant CRT. Both macrophages and neutrophils over time modified the cell surface to become more or less receptive to bind exogenous CRT (Fig. 2c) . As the macrophages became less receptive to bind CRT neutrophils became more receptive to bind CRT. These data indicated that cell surface CRT regulated PrCR of neutrophils in this model. To test this we conducted a phagocytosis assay in which we blocked CRT recognition with a CRT blocking antibody and found that the phagocytosis of viable neutrophils by macrophages under this condition was significantly decreased (Fig. 2d) . These data emphasize that PrCR is a dynamic process and PrCR of viable cells is dependent largely on the appearance of cell surface targets for CRT binding. Macrophages produce and secrete CRT to label cells for PrCR. We investigated the molecular mechanisms of CRT-mediated PrCR of neutrophils by examining the origin of cell surface CRT on deathless neutrophils. Interestingly, neutrophils express extremely low levels of CRT while macrophages express high levels of CRT at both the RNA and protein levels, suggesting that surface CRT molecules on neutrophils may originate from macrophages ( Fig. 3a-c, Supplementary Fig. 2b ). To test this we isolated peritoneal macrophages after thioglycollate injection and found that they readily secreted CRT (Fig. 3d) . Stimulation of macrophages with LPS promoted CRT secretion, suggesting that macrophages utilize this mechanism of CRT secretion to promote PrCR ( Supplementary Fig. 2c, d) . To further evaluate the source of CRT we cultured neutrophils or macrophages alone or together and measured cell surface CRT levels. Neutrophils did not alter the cell surface levels of CRT with respect to time when they were cultured alone ( Supplementary Fig. 2e) , however, co-culture of neutrophils and macrophages separated by a 0.4-μm pore membrane in a Boyden chamber showed a rapid and significant increase of cell surface CRT on neutrophils ( Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 2f ). To determine the possibility that macrophages could produce this CRT and transfer it to neutrophils, we (paired t-test) so significant differences for CD47 staining between macrophages and neutrophils at the same time points.

In a, b, and c, MFI, mean fluorescence intensity metabolically labeled activated macrophages with AHA (L-azidohomoalanine), a methionine analog, to label all newly synthesized proteins and then co-cultured these cells with neutrophils separated from the macrophages by a 0.4-μm pore membrane in a Boyden chamber (Fig. 3f ). Through a "click" reaction we were able to incorporate biotin into AHA positive protein on neutrophils. Immunoprecipitating CRT followed by western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitate and probing for Fig. 3 Macrophages are the sources of CRT and secrete CRT to label the target cells. a Expression of CRT measured by qRT-PCR in neutrophils and macrophages 8 h after thioglycollate.

Error bars represent standard deviation. f A schematic showing the Click-iT assay to examine transfer of CRT from macrophages to neutrophils during co-culture. Macrophages proteins were labeled with a methionine analog AHA (L-azidohomoalanine) receptive for click chemistry. The proteins secreted by macrophages were all labeled with AHA. Because neutrophils and macrophages were cultured in a way independent of contact, the AHA-labeled proteins detected on neutrophils originate from the macrophages. g Neutrophils were cultured alone or together with AHA-treated macrophages in a 0.4-μm Boyden chamber. Cells were collected and CRT was immunoprecipitated and then subjected to clickchemistry adding in biotin to receptive methionine analogs. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then western blot for the presence of biotin. Detection of AHA-labeled CRT on neutrophils indicated that macrophage-secreted CRT to label neutrophils and this was independent of the contact between these two cell types biotin with streptavidin-HRP, we found biotin positive CRT on neutrophils, indicating that macrophages secreted CRT that decorated the surface of the deathless neutrophils, in the absence of contact between the macrophages and neutrophils ( Fig. 3g and Supplementary Fig. 2g ). Considering the possibilities that macrophages modify target cells through cytokine secretion, we examined the cytokine profiling of macrophages under different circumstances. Blocking CRT from macrophages didnot affect their cytokine profiling, except for an upregulation of MIP2 and GROA, two inflammatory cytokines ( Supplementary Fig. 2h ). In addition, no significant differences were observed regarding the cytokine secretion from macrophages when co-cultured in a Boyden chamber with neutrophils from WT or MRP8-Bcl2 mice ( Supplementary Fig. 2i ). These data indicate that direct modification of target cells via cytokines from macrophages is not the major mechanism to activate PrCR, however there is a dynamic interplay that promotes macrophages to secrete CRT and neutrophils to accumulate it. Identification of CRT-binding targets. We next sought to identify CRT-binding sites on neutrophils targeted for PrCR to better understand the basic mechanism of macrophage-target cell interaction during PrCR. CRT functions as a lectin-chaperone in the ER, binding to newly synthesized glycoproteins to assist their folding and glycosylation 32 . Abnormal cell-surface glycosylation has been reported on apoptotic cells and on some cancer cells 33, 34 . Therefore, we hypothesized that macrophage-secreted CRT maintains its lectin-like characteristics and binds to target cells via cell surface glycoproteins, perhaps the same glycans CRT binds to in the ER 35, 36 . Thus we performed a screening experiment by probing a carbohydrate microarray 37,38 that contains a large number of tumor glycan molecules, with recombinant CRT. We found that CRT selectively bound to the tumor-associated asialoglycans displaying the Tri-antennary and multivalent type II (Galβ1 → 4GlcNAc) chain epitopes (Tri/m-II) (Fig. 4a) . Phytohaemagglutinin-L (PHA-L), a lectin that we previously demonstrated to specifically bind with the Tri/m-II dominant structure 37,38 ( Supplementary Fig. 3a) , mimics CRT-binding kinetics on neutrophils and macrophages, demonstrating that over time more binding sites for CRT can be detected on neutrophils as less are detected on macrophages (Fig. 4b) . We found that while newly produced neutrophils displayed few CRTbinding sites as compared to mature neutrophils, treatment with neuraminidase, a glycoside hydrolase enzyme which removes sialic acids from the terminal positions of glycans and exposes the cryptic Tri/m-II, dramatically increased CRT binding in both groups (Fig. 4c, d) . These data confirm that CRT can bind to the viable cells to promote PrCR via asialoglycoproteins. We then examined CRT binding to cell surface glycan molecules, by using WT and mutant CHO cell lines that specifically express Tri/m-II and its derivatives 39 . Stronger binding of recombinant CRT was observed on CHO lines defective in the CMP-sialic acid transporter (Lec2) or UDP-GlcNAc 2 epimerase (Lec3) that expressed Tri/m-II, as compared to parental line, or the line defective in UDP-Gal translocase that expressed Tri/m-II capped by sialic acids or missing mannose on the outermost layer ( Supplementary  Fig. 3b ). We next sought to determine whether the same mechanism functions for recognition and phagocytosis of target cells in PrCR during other biological processes. We have previously demonstrated that PrCR is critical for macrophage-mediated cancer immunosurveillance, so we examined the expression and roles of CRT-binding sites on cancer cells. We found that activated macrophages but not cancer cells were able to release a significant amount of CRT into the medium when cultured ( Supplementary   Fig. 3c ). In addition, we examined the presence of CRT-binding sites on a human AML cell line HL60 and a human colon cancer cell line SW620, and found that their endogenous CRT was either expressed at a low level or limited to the perinuclear regions while a significant portion of PHA-L staining were observed on the cell surface (Fig. 4e, f) . Recombinant CRT bound to HL60 cells and colocalized with PHA-L on the cell surface, indicating that CRT is dependent on the presence of the cyptic Tri/m-II domain to bind ( Supplementary Fig. 3d ). Cell surface asialoglycans regulates CRT-mediated PrCR. It has been shown that living aging and cancer cells can be directly phagocytosed by macrophages without cell death being induced 4, 40 ( Supplementary Fig. 4a, b) . Clearance of living cancer cells through PrCR was not due to induction of cell death. During PrCR, cancer cells were engulfed and digested inside macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 4c-e) . With the observation that CRT bridges target cells to macrophage for PrCR via asialoglycans on the cell surface, we wanted to next determine whether we can manipulate this asialoglycan epitope on any normal or neoplastic cell to promote PrCR. Indeed, we found that CRT binding to cancer cells was markedly enhanced after neuraminidase treatment and was specific to the asialoglycans ( Fig. 5a-d) ; and that such treatment significantly promoted phagocytosis of a wide range of human cancer cells by either human or mouse macrophages (Fig. 5e , f and Supplementary  Fig. 5a -c). To determine whether and which neuraminidase was responsible for promoting PrCR, we performed a screening experiment in which we suppressed the expression of the four different neuraminidase genes. We found that Neu4 played a major role in regulating cell surface asialoglycan epitopes for CRT binding to HL60 cells ( Fig. 5g and Supplementary Fig. 5d -e), and consistently, suppression of Neu4 expression significantly decreased phagocytosis of these cells (Fig. 5h) . Taken together these data demonstrate that the regulation of CRT-binding asialoglycans on target cells is critical for their susceptibility to PrCR, and can be produced with cell intrinsic neuraminidases. CRT-binding site in malignancies and hematopoiesis. Since exposure of CRT-binding sites by neuraminidase treatment enhanced phagocytosis of cancer cells, we then examined its effects on inducing PrCR of xenotransplanted cancer cells in mice and reduction of tumor incidence in vivo. Importantly, treatment of cancer cells with neuraminidase showed no effects on the intrinsic programs regulating cell viability and proliferation ( Supplementary Fig. 6a-f ). When a human leukemia cell line (HL60) and a colon cancer cell line (DLD-1) were treated with neuraminidase and put into a long-term incubation with macrophages, significant reductions of cancer cell numbers were observed as compared to the control group ( Supplementary  Fig. 7a-b) . When we subcutaneously injected HL60 and DLD-1 cells treated with active or heat-inactivated neuraminidase into NSG mice, a dramatic inhibition of tumor engraftment and growth was observed for the cells treated with active neuraminidase, suggesting the exposure of CRT-binding sites likely promoted PrCR in vivo (Fig. 6a, b and Supplementary Fig. 7c ). Based on these findings, we reasoned that if the regulation of asialoglycans determines susceptibility to PrCR and therefore growth of tumor cells, then the expression of the genes that regulate the presence of asialoglycans could be correlated with disease outcomes or patient survival. To assess the correlation between the expression of CRT-binding sites and clinical outcomes, we used the PRECOG program 41 to analyze published gene datasets containing corresponding patient survival data. We included in this analysis genes encoding sialytransferases or neuraminidases, which respectively attach or remove sialic acid to -400 B g M a n 1 M a n 2 M a n 3 M a n 4 M a n 5 M a n 6 M a n 7 M a n 8 M a n 9 M a n 9 -K L H M a n 9 -P A Higher expression of genes promoting the removal of sialic acids correlated with an improved survival 43,44 while higher expression of the genes enhancing sialic acid expression correlated with a worse outcome 45, 46 (Fig. 6c-f ). We found previously that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that migrated out of bone marrow and into circulation increased the expression of the "don't eat me" signal CD47, which blocked PrCR 1,13 , suggesting stem cells also develop mechanisms against PrCR for their self-protection. Therefore, we expanded our findings to hematopoiesis and found further evidence for a role of these CRT-binding sites in PrCR in HSCs. In the current study, we used the Gene Expression Commons 47 platform containing gene expression datasets for different cell types in mouse and human to analyze expression of sialytransferases and neuraminidases in HSCs and their differentiated progeny. HSCs showed significantly higher expression of sialytransferases and lower expression of neuraminidases, consistent with their longer survival than their differentiated progeny (Supplementary Fig. 7d-k) . We next examined CRT surface levels and availability of binding sites in acute myelogenous leukemia, as a pathological model of hematopoiesis. We fractionated patient samples into residual normal HSCs, multipotent progenitors (MPPs), leukemia stem cells (LSCs), and blasts cells. Importantly, staining of surface CRT and binding of PHA-L, significantly correlated in all cell populations, indicating the dependence of CRT cell surface binding on asialoglycoproteins in normal and neoplastic cells (Fig. 6g , Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 8) . Consistently, much stronger PHA-L staining was found on blast cells, which have the shortest half-life as compared to MPPs, LSCs, and HSCs (Fig. 6g ).
