Expression and characterization of dsBRD-His 18 protein tag. To add endosomal escape capability, a short polyhistidine peptide was added to dsRBD. The dsRBD domain comes from the first 172 amino acids of human protein kinase R (hPKR), and has two double-strand RNA binding motifs (dsRBM1 and dsRBM2) for cooperative and dsRNA-specific binding 31 . Because dsRBM1 towards the N terminal dominates the binding with dsRNA 32 , we introduced the histidine peptide towards the C terminal ( Figure 1 ) to minimize impact on dsRBD's biological activity. In theory, the endosomal escape capability should increase with longer His chain; on the other hand, long His chain could potentially interfere with dsRBD protein folding and binding. To achieve a balance, dsRBD with Cterminal Histidines of various lengths (His n , n 5 0, 12, 18, and 24) were cloned into the PET28a (1) vector. BamH1 and Xho1 restriction enzyme sites were introduced to the 59-and 39-flanking region by PCR, respectively. Because all the genetic constructs contain His 6 at the N-terminal from the cloning vector (this Nterminal His 6 has been previously proved to have no impact on dsRBD binding) 26 , the total numbers of His encoded by the final constructs are 6, 18, 24, and 30, respectively (sequences see Methods). Post expression and purification, the resulted protein tags were analyzed with sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, Figure 2a ). The sizes of four protein tags show in excellent agreement with theoretical values (Figure 1 ). To assess their dsRNA binding activity, siRNA-aptamer chimera labeled with fluorophore FAM were incubated with the protein tags and probed with gel electrophoresis (1% agarose). As shown in Figure 2b , the dsRNA binding capability of dsRBD with His 12 at the C terminus (total His 18 ) is well preserved compared with dsRBD without a Cterminus histag insertion. The minimum RNA length for high affinity binding with dsRBD has been determined to be 16 base-pairs 26 . At the current RNA length, the siRNA segment and the adjacent short stem in the aptamer structure can bind with 1-2 copies of dsRBD. However, it has been well documented that only the first dsRBD binds to RNA stably, while, at high dsRBD/RNA ratio, a second copy of dsRBD can bind, but at significantly lower affinity 26, 33 . Using unmodified dsRBD and siRNA alone, similar dsRBD-siRNA binding profiles have been observed previously by Kim and coworkers, who also show that the enzymatic stability of siRNA is significantly enhanced upon binding with dsRBD 34 . It is important to mention that a key difference of our technology compared to these prior works utilizing dsRBD for siRNA 27, 34 is that we do not introduce highly positively charged peptides. Although positively charged nanocarriers promote siRNA cell entry, it is well known that they are also quickly cleared by the RES, increase non-specific binding with cells and cytotoxicity 35 . Furthermore, as aforementioned, avoiding positive charges in carrier design is particularly important for siRNA-aptamer chimera because excessive positive charges could non-specifically interact with aptamer and affect its targeting capability. More interestingly, the gel electrophoresis experiments also reveal that extending the C-terminal His by another 6 or 12 amino acids completely abolish dsRBD's binding activity. Therefore, for the following gene expression regulation studies we chose the dsRBD with a total of 18 His due to its balanced dsRNA binding and endosomal escape functionalities, in comparison with the original dsRBD with no C-terminus His as a control. Design, synthesis, and characterization of siRNA-aptamer chimera. To evaluate the universal protein tag for siRNA-aptamer chimera, we first designed and made a chimera based on the protocols described by Dassie and coworkers, taking advantage of the shortened aptamer sequence for specific targeting of PSMA as well as the optimized siRNA strands with enhanced therapeutic potency 15 . The PSMA targeting aptamer was kept in our chimera, because PSMA has been identified as one of the most attractive cell surface markers for both prostate epithelial cells and neovascular endothelial cells 36 . Accumulation and retention of PSMA targeting probes at the site of tumor growth is the basis of radioimmunoscintigraphic scanning (e.g., ProstaScint scan) and targeted therapy for human prostate cancer metastasis. We replaced their siRNA sequence with a siRNA silencing GFP expression, because GFP is the best model for quantitative assessment of the silencing effect using optical imaging and flow cytometry. The long ssRNA composed of PSMA aptamer and siRNA antisense strand ( Figure 1 ) was prepared by in vitro transcription with the presence of 29 fluoro-modified pyrimidies for improved resistance to ribonucleases. It has been shown previously that 29-F modification is compatible with dsRBD binding unlike 29-H or 29-OCH 3 substitutes 26, 37 . The transcript was annealed to chemically synthesized siRNA sense strand. Before combining the chimera with our small protein tag, we first tested the activities of the chimera. To test the targeting function of the aptamer block, PSMA-positive LNCaP and PSMA-negative PC3 prostate tumor cells were incubated with dye-labeled chimera. As shown in Figure 2c , the chimera selectively binds and enters LNCaP cells indicating targeting specificity. To test the silencing effect separately, the chimera was transfected into GFP-expressing C4-2 prostate tumor cells (a derivative of LNCaP) using conventional transfection agents, Lipofectamine. As shown in Figure 2d , the silencing effect is indistinguishable with the positive control using siRNA only, proving that chimera can be enzymatically processed intracellularly to generate functional siRNA. Targeting delivery and silencing in cells. With the biological activities of our protein tag and siRNA-aptamer chimera separately characterized, we proceeded to evaluate the gene silencing effect of this simple yet functionally highly complementary protein tag in siRNA-aptamer chimera delivery. GFP-expressing C4-2 cell line was used as a model because of the advantages of fluorescence imaging techniques such as microscopy and quantitative flow cytometry. Figure 3a -f shows confocal images of the C4-2 cells without treatment, treated with GFP-siRNA alone, chimera alone, a random sequenced siRNA with the protein tag (His 18 ), chimera with protein tag (His 6 ), and chimera with protein tag (His 18 ). Qualitatively, only the experimental treatment, chimera with protein tag (His 18 ), clearly shows GFP silencing, whereas none of the five control treatments leads to significant suppression of GFP expression. Quantitative flow cytometry studies further confirm this result (Figure 3g-l) . At the current gate value set for GFP fluorescence intensity, the original untreated cells showed a GFP-negative population of 17.4%. Treating the cells with a random sequenced siRNA with protein tag (His 18 ) shows virtually no change in this population (difference: 5.4% of total cell population, within error range) proving sequence-specific silencing of RNAi. For cells treated with GFP siRNA and chimera, the GFP negative cells only increase by 7.6% and 12.2% of the total cell population respectively. Even by increasing the chimera concentration by ten times (1 mM), the total GFPnegative cell population only increase by ,20% (Supplementary Figure S1) , strongly suggesting the need of carrier materials. Direct comparison of the chimera tagged by dsRBD-His 6 and dsRBD-His 18 shows major difference in silencing efficiency, too (14.6% and 59.6% change). Taken together, these results clearly indicate that (1) chimera alone at concentration commonly used in RNAi experiments does not lead to effective silencing, and (2) His 18 is remarkably more effective than His 6 in endosomal destabilization since the dsRBD block is identical in structure and function. To put the silencing efficiency of dsRBD-His 18 in the context of those of conventional RNA delivery vehicles such as Lipofectamine, quantitative flow cytometry was also conducted. In agreement with the microscopy results shown in Figure 2d , Lipofectamine reduces GFP-negative cells from the original 17.4% to 91.6% (74.2% change, Supplementary Figure  S2 ), which is slightly more efficient than the protein tag. However, it is important to note that Lipofectamine delivers chimera into cells mainly via electrostatic interactions (positively charged Lipofectamine and negatively charged cell surface, non-targeted delivery), whereas our protein tag delivers chimera by cell type-specific molecular recognition (targeted delivery). It is also worth mentioning that the molar ratio of mixing chimera with protein tag is 152 because the siRNA block can bind up to 2 copies of dsRBD, although the second copy has very weak binding affinity. Indeed, changing the binding ratio to 1 or 4 does not affect the RNAi efficiency (Supplementary Figure S3) . To further confirm the difference in endosomal escape capability between the two protein tags (dsRBD-His 6 and dsRBD-His 18 ), we performed a dual color imaging assay using non-fluorescence LNCaP cells. In this experiment, chimera was labeled with Cy3 and endosome/lysosome was marked with a LysoTracker (spectrally distinguishable green fluorescence). Direct contrast in chimera distribution and intracellular density of endosome/lysosome was observed between the two protein tags. As shown in Figure 4 , Cy3labeled chimera evenly distributes inside cells when tagged by dsRBD-His 18 , whereas dsRBD-His 6 treated cells show much higher density of endosomes and lysosomes and lower level of Cy3 fluorescence. This confocal imaging comparison directly explains the difference between the two protein tags in RNAi efficiency, and unambiguously demonstrates the superior endosome escape capability of dsRBD-His 18 over dsRBD-His 6 . Cytotoxicity. Lastly, we probed the cytotoxicity of the best performing protein tag dsRBD-His 18 using a standard cell viability assay (CellTiter-BlueH). The assay is based on the ability of living cells to convert a redox dye (resazurin) into a fluorescent end product (resorufin). Nonviable cells lose metabolic capacity and thus do not generate fluorescent signals. As illustrated in Figure 5 , virtually no toxicity was detected up to a concentration four times as high as the one used in the delivery work in reference to the untreated control. This is perhaps not too surprising due to the biocompatibility of dsRBD, a small protein of human origin. More importantly, for future in vivo applications, we envision that the small protein tag would have improved clearance capability compared with synthetic polymers and inorganic nanoparticles used for siRNA delivery. Discussion siRNA-aptamer chimera is one of the most promising approaches for cell type-specific RNAi, owing to its low immunogenicity, ease of chemical synthesis and modification, small size, and the modularity of both the targeting aptamer block and the therapeutic siRNA segment. More importantly, employing only RNA molecules, the simple formulation of chimera-based targeted siRNA therapy leads to outstanding clinical translation 15, 16 . Due to the incapability of chimera to efficiently escape endosome, delivery nanocarriers are needed. However, almost all current targeted siRNA delivery formulations involve cationic nanocarriers such as polymers, inorganic nanoparticles, peptides, and proteins 7, 19, 20, 27, 28, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] . Unfortunately, these conventional siRNA nanocarriers are unsuitable for chimera delivery, and, in fact, reverse the signature property of chimera, simple formulation for regulatory approval and clinical translation 15, 16 . This is because the charge induced complex formation is basically an aggregation process, which lacks control over aggregate size, shape, stoichiometry, chimera orientation, aptamer functionality, and reproducibility during scale-up production. In addition, the final complexes often carriers positive charges as well, which is unfavorable for systemic uses 23 . As a result, first clinical trials of siRNA duplexes are mainly limited to local administrations [45] [46] [47] [48] . Our protein tag does not rely on high positive charge to interact with RNA molecules. In fact, it only recognizes relatively long dsRNAs (.16 bp) such as the siRNA segment and the short stem region of the aptamer in our chimera molecule. Extensive biochemistry investigations have shown that for the current length of the chimera, maximum two copies of dsRBD can bind to it with differential affinity (the first copy binds much stronger than the second copy). The gene silencing experiments conducted here reflect this effect since mixing chimera with 13 or 23 protein tags does not affect the silencing efficiency. Considering the molecular weights of the chimera (28.8 kDa) and the protein tag (24.8 kDa), molecular weight of the final complex at 151 binding will become 53.6 kDa. Based on well-documented size effect for in vivo drug delivery 49 , this size is sufficiently large to reduce premature renal clearance while still small enough for deep tissue penetration. For example, by tagging siRNA-aptamer chimera with a 20 kDa PEG, its in vivo circulating half-life has been shown to increase from approximately 30 min to 30 hours 15 ; whereas large nanoparticles (.30 nm) have been shown to be ineffective in tumor treatment except for some hyperpermeable tumors 50 . In conclusion, to solve the endosome escape problem of the highly promising siRNA-aptamer chimera based therapy, we have designed a dual-block small protein by combining dsRBD and polyhistidine and identified the optimal length of polyhistidine. The resulted protein tag shares the simplicity feature of siRNA-aptamer chimera, yet offers exactly complementary functionalities. The dsRBD selectively binds to the siRNA block, leaving the targeting aptamer accessible. In terms of size, different from conventional cationic delivery vehicles, the dsRBD-His 18 tagged chimera remains discrete in solution rather than forming large aggregates. In terms of functionalities, chimera and dsRBD-His 18 are highly complementary to each other, and thus offer the complete set of features necessary for targeted siRNA delivery (e.g., targeting, therapeutic, siRNA protection, and endosomal escape). This platform is also universal, able to chaperone any chimera sequences for cell type-specific delivery. Largely based on natural proteins, dsRBD-His 18 is an excellent candidate for potential clinical translation because of its simple structure and biodegradability. Further development of this small protein tag with in vivo testing should raise exciting opportunities for siRNA clinical translation and personalized medicine.
