The simulation suggests that the advancement of a single epidemic infectious disease vaccine candidate from pre clinical through end of phase 2a can cost $31-68 million ($14-159 million range), assuming no risk of failure (table 3) . However, the total cost of progressing one epidemic infectious disease vaccine successfully through to end of phase 2a is dependent on the probability of success and on the shape of the vaccine research and development pipeline. As the figure demonstrates, accounting for probability of success and assuming no clinical vaccine candidates exist for a given epidemic infectious disease, 11 to 21 preclinical candidates would be required if at least one of these were to progress through to end of phase 2a, at a cost of $319-469 million ($137 million-$1·1 billion range). Similarly, six to ten phase 1 candidates would (table 4) . Under a high probability of success and high cost scenario, the cost for 43 phase 2b-3 ready candidates (26-70 range) would amount to $9·8 billion ($2·4-21·6 billion range). Seven epidemic infectious diseases-Zika, Ebola, chikungunya, Rift Valley fever, Marburg, and Lassa-have sufficient vaccine pipelines for investments (if made available) to guarantee successful phase 2a outcomes regardless of probability of success (in reality, phase 2b-3 ready candidates already exist for Ebola). Under a low probability of success scenario, the successful progression of a vaccine through to end of phase 2a cannot be guaranteed for Nipah, given the available candidates for this epidemic infectious disease. Vaccine pipelines for Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and severe fever with thrombo cytopenia syndrome comprise too few candidates for any phase 2a outcomes to be predicted through investments in these, even under a more optimistic probability of success. Based on the stochastic optimisation (table 5) , lower investments would be needed in a smaller number of vaccine candidates to achieve phase 2a outcomes in chikungunya, Zika, Rift Valley fever, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and Marburg, as their clinical vaccine pipelines are modestly mature. Higher invest ments across a larger number of preclinical vaccine candidates would be needed for a Lassa phase 2b-3 ready vaccine to be guaranteed. 18 to 55 new preclinical candidates would need to be added to the vaccine pipelines of Nipah, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome collectively for a phase 2b-3 ready candidate to be guaranteed in each of these epidemic infectious diseases. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis is embedded in the findings through stochastic modelling (appendix). This analysis demonstrates that whereas zero phase 2a outcomes are unlikely given the numbers of vaccine candidates supported by research and development phase under the low and high probability of success scenarios, outcomes previously mentioned and beyond one phase 2b-3 ready candidate per epidemic infectious disease are dependent on the probability of success. In a scenario in which low costs were associated with high probability of success distributions, the same numbers of vaccine candidates would need to be supported as per the high probability of success and high cost scenario to achieve minimum phase 2a outcomes per epidemic infectious disease, but the overall portfolio cost would reduce to US$1•6 billion ($715 million-2•9 billion range). In contrast, in a scenario where high costs were associated with low probability of success distributions, the same numbers of vaccine candidates would need to be funded as per the low probability of success and low cost scenario to successfully advance at least one vaccine through to end of phase 2a successfully. In this case, however, the associated portfolio cost would increase to $6•8 billion ($1•5-15•1 billion range; appendix).
