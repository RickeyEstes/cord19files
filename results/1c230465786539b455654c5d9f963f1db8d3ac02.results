Replication of PE3 in explants was demonstrated in five experiments ( fig. 1 ). The titres of the light-resistant virus peaked on day 2 or 4 with maximal yields of 1 • 10 s to 1 • 10 ~ MPNCU/ml and average yields of 5 X 104 to 1 • 10 s MPNCU/ml. Attachment of explants to scored areas of the petri dishes remained good (60-100%) for 4 days and then declined; similarly, villous structure appeared typical for 4 days, but by 6 days there was shortening and thinning of villi and some buildup of mucus on the surface of the explants. Differences between virus-inoculated and uninoculated explants were not perceptible. The open portion of each bar shows the titre of the virus incubated with ileal explants, and the filled portion of the bar shows the titre of the same quantity of virus incubated in dishes without tissue (controls). Where only a filled bar appears, only a suspension without tissue was tested (experiments A and E) or the titres of the two suspensions were the same (experiment C). Arrowheads pointing downward indicate that the control suspension gave a negative test result at the lower limit of virus detection. The photosensitized virus suspension had been diluted 100-fold initially in experiments A, B, and C, and 1,000-fold initially in experiments D and E.
