Following the methodology described in the previous section quantitative probabilities were obtained. The probabilities of entry for each route, country and disease are detailed in the following tables: Tables 4-9. There are some countries without information available regarding certain diseases, therefore, no probability has been assigned. With all the probabilities already calculated, the total probability of entry of the disease j from the country i into the European Union by any combination of routes of entry (PI j i ) is obtained and detailed in Table 10 . Furthermore, the likelihood of entry of a disease j in the European Union is represented in Figure 3 . The results show that contagious bovine pleuropneumonia has no risk of entry. This disease is not only absent in Europe at the moment, but it is only transmissible by direct contact between cattle, and according to the databases consulted, the movement of cattle among the affected countries and the European Union is not made. There is no available information about some diseases in some countries; therefore, no probability has been assigned for those countries. In addition, for the countries that had never notified a disease, it has been assigned a zero probability. On the other hand, highly pathogenic avian influenza and Newcastle disease have a major risk of entry into the European Union. These disease have a high risk of entry into the European Union through wild birds migration, due to the existence of different migratory routes that link the European breeding areas with African wintering areas (7, 8) , resulting in a constant flow of wild birds among the affected countries of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and the European Union. Bluetongue, epizootic haemorrhagic disease, foot and mouth disease and Rift Valle fever resulted to have a moderate risk of entry into the European Union. It has been demonstrated the possibility of entry of this diseases into the European Union through wind dispersion of vectors for bluetongue, epizootic haemorrhagic disease and Rift Valley fever; or through wind dispersion of virus for foot and mouth disease. There is no available information about some diseases in some countries; therefore, no probability has been assigned for those countries. In addition, for the countries that had never notified a disease, it has been assigned a zero probability. A low risk of entry has been obtained for the following diseases: Middle East respiratory syndrome, peste des petits ruminants, glanders and heartwater. To complete the study, the results obtained are compared with the historic events occurred during the last 2 years, shown in Table 11 . In 2017 and 2018, European countries had notified outbreaks of bluetongue, highly pathogenic avian influenza, Newcastle disease and Rift Valley fever (among all the diseases included in this study).
