Concentration of methylene chloride vapor in chambers. Rats were exposed to analytical concentrations of methylene chloride of 5 10 + 27, 15 11 -t 62, and 347 + 145 while hamsters were exposed to 5 10 + 27,15 10 + 62,and 500, 1500, and 3500 ppm, respectively. Close agreement was observed between daily nominal and analytical values indicating minimal losses of the test material during vaporization and no detectable decomposition. In-life observations. During the first week of exposure to 3500 ppm methylene chloride, the rats exhibited a slight decrease in physical activity; this effect disappeared after approximately 1 week. No other exposure-related effects due to methylene chloride were observed. However, a disease consistent with sialodacryoadenitis (SDA virus), a transient viral infection, was observed in male and female rats during the first 2 months of the study. This infection did not result in increased mortality and all exposure groups appeared to be affected to the same degree. No exposure-related effects were observed in any of the male or female hamsters. Mortality. Female rats exposed to 3500 ppm had statistically significantly increased mortality from the 18th through the 24th month which appeared to be exposure related (Fig.  1 ). Female hamsters exposed to 3500 ppm had a statistically significantly decreased mortality from the 13th through the 24th month and female hamsters exposed to 1500 ppm had statistically significantly decreased mortality from the 20th through the 24th month (Fig. 2) . No exposure-related effects occurred in the other groups of rats or hamsters. Body weights. There were no exposure-related alterations in body weight in either male or female rats or hamsters. Organ weights and organ to body weight ratios. Mean liver weights were increased for both male and female rats of the 3500-ppm exposure groups at the 18-month interim kill. Both absolute and relative mean liver weights were statistically significantly increased for males, while only the mean relative weight was statistically significantly increased for females. Mean absolute liver weight was also increased for the 3500-ppm females although the increase was not statistically significant. changes were observed that were considered to be related to the methylene chloride exposure. No exposure-related effects were observed in mean fasted body weights and mean organ weights in male or female hamsters exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm. Hematology. Mean hematologic values were determined and mean red blood cell indices were calculated. A few statistically significant increases and decreases were present; they occurred haphazardly among the exposure groups, and most values were within the range expected for these animals. The red cell indices in rats may have been slightly altered. The MCV and MCH values at 15 months in males were both significantly increased at all exposure levels. In addition, the MCV and MCH values were consistently increased (not statistically) in exposed males and females compared to controls. The PCV and Hgb data indicated possible exposure-related trends in the values for both male and female hamsters. For example, every group mean Hgb value was minimally increased over their respective control values in males and females from all exposure levels at each kill; however, only 8 of the values were statistically significant. Similarly, all the PCV values for males and females (except for males exposed to 500 ppm and killed at 12 months) were elevated over their respective control values at all scheduled sacrifices. Clinical chemistries and urinalysis. No exposure-related effects in clinical chemistry or urinalysis values were observed for any of the parameters evaluated throughout this investigation. Carboxyhemoglobin. Male and female rats and hamsters exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm all had statistically significantly elevated carboxyhemoglobin values; however, there was no dose-response relationship (Table 1) . Cytogenetics. No increased cytogenetic aberrations were observed in rats exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm of methylene chloride for 6 months when compared to their respective control groups. Pathologic observations in rats. In view of the voluminous nature of the pathology data, only selected histopathologic findings are summarized in Table 2 . Effects on the liver were observed in both males and females at all exposure levels at 12 months and beyond. All exposure groups had increased hepatocellular vacuolization (Fig. 3 ) which was consistent with fatty change. The number of rats with this change increased in an exposure-related fashion in both males and females. Male rats had 17, 38, 45, and 54% in the 0-, 500~, 1500-, and 3500-ppm exposure groups, respectively, while the females had 34, 52, 59, and 65%, respectively. Multinucleated hepatocytes in the centrilobular region of the liver occurred in control and methylene chloride exposed females (Fig.  4) . The cells were large with from a few to dozens of nuclei per hepatocyte. Ultrastructurally the cells had increased numbers of mitochondria that were larger than normal and contained intra-mitochondrial inclusions (Figs. 5 and 6a, b) . Inhalation of methylene chloride resulted in a statistically significant increase in the number of female rats with these cells, but with no evidence of a doserelated increase in incidence or severity. The number of foci and areas of altered hepatocytes (Fig. 7) were statistically signifr-during the exposure period, but the number camly increased in female rats exposed to 3500 of neoplastic (hyperplastic) nodules (Squire ppm, but were not increased in the groups of and Levitt, 1975), or hepatocellular carcinofemales exposed to 500 or 1500 ppm or in mas, was not increased in any exposure group. males exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm. Males exposed to 1500 or 3500 ppm had The foci and areas were apparent after 12 an increased incidence of individual hepatomonths and their number and size increased cellular necrosis, and females exposed to 3500 FIG. 4 .

Also, the livers of some male and female rats exposed to 1500 or 3500 ppm and some females exposed to 500 ppm for 12 months appeared to have slightly more hemosiderin pigment than controls. Both male and female rats exposed to 3500 ppm and males exposed to 1500 ppm had either a decreased incidence (females) or decreased severity (males) of spontaneously occurring age-associated chronic renal disease (chronic progressive glomerulonephropathy) compared to controls. Furthermore, the nonrenal lesions (i.e., uremic pneumonitis, mineralization of multiple organs and blood vessels, periarteritis, parathyroid hyperplasia, fibrous osteodystrophy, brain malacia, and myocardial degeneration) that normally occurs secondarily in rats with severe renal disease (Burek et al., 1979) was also reduced in the males exposed to 3500 ppm. Males exposed to 1500 or 3500 ppm had a statistically significantly decreased incidence of grossly observed pancreatic nodules. His-tologically, fewer islet cell adenomas, decreased blood vessel mineralization because of the decrease in severe renal disease, or less pancreatic acinar atrophy were observed especially in the 3500-ppm exposure group. As a result, there was a definite decrease in the total number of pancreatic lesions in the males exposed to 3500 ppm compared to controls with 39% of the controls not having any recognized histopathological lesion compared to 70% of those exposed to 3500 ppm. Male rats exposed to 3500 ppm had a statistically significant increase in the total number of cases of increased extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) in the spleen and both males and females exposed to 3500 ppm had a significant decrease in the number with hematogenous pigment (hemosiderin) in the spleen. Groups of female rats exposed to 500,1500, or 3500 ppm of methylene chloride all had increased numbers of benign mammary tumors (Fig. 8) per tumor-bearing rat. The increase was based on palpable mass data and on gross examination. Histopathologic data FIG, 6 . Enlarged mitochondtia in a mukinuckated hepatocyte from a female rat exposed to 3500 ppm. Note the material separating the cristae and the parallel lamellar arrangement of the material (A) X8300, (B) X80,000. provide the numbers of masses that were confirmed to be of mammary origin. The total number of female rats with a benign mammary tumor was not statistically significantly increased in any exposure group. However, the total number of benign mammary tumors increased in an exposure-related manner. The average number of benign mammary tumors per mammary tumor-bearing female rat increased from 2.1 in the control rats, to 2.7 in rats exposed to 500 ppm, to 3.1 in those exposed to 1500 ppm, and to 3.5 in rats exposed to 3500 ppm. The benign mammary tumor response was present in males, but to a lesser extent than in females. There was an increase (not statis- FIG. 7 .

There was a slight increase in the total number of benign mammary tumors in males exposed to 1500 or 3500 ppm. As was the case for females, these effects in males exposed to 1500 or 3500 ppm were exposure related. Despite the increased numbers of benign mammary tumors, there was no indication of an increased number or incidence of malignant mammary tumors in either male or female rats exposed to methylene chloride, and thus no indication for progression of benign to malignant mammary tumors. A second tumor type occurred in the ventral midcervical region, in and around the salivary gland, in male rats. There was 1 tumor in 124 male control rats compared to 0 of 124, 5 of 124, and 11 of 124 in the 500-, 1500-, and 3500-ppm exposure groups, respectively. These tumors were large (several centimeters in diameter), cystic, necrotic, or hemorrhagic. They appeared to invade all adjacent tissues in the neck region and often completely replaced the salivary glands. Histologically, all were sarcomas (Fig. 9) . They were composed of round to spindle &Is. Mitotic figures were frequently observed as were necrosis and local invasion into adjacent tissues. Most tumors had remnants of normal salivary acini or ducts within the area of cellular proliferation. Most tumors had some areas that morphologically resembled one cell type (i.e., fibrosarcoma), while other areas resembled another cell type (i.e., neurofibrosarcoma), and still other tumors had cell types that were undifferentiated or pleomorphic. In some, one cell type was predominant, while in others, areas of all of the above cell types were present depending on the area of the tumor examined. Furthermore, the origin of each of these tumors remains questionable. All appeared to be arising in the midcervical region and all involved the salivary glands. Two were relatively small masses and appeared to be arising in the interstitial and capsular tissue of the salivary glands. The rest were larger, invasive, and destructive tumors that clearly involved the salivary glands as well as adjacent tissues and could have been growing either into or out of the salivary glands. Special stains (periodic acid-S&i& Mallory's phosphotungstic acid, hematoxylin, Gordon and Sweet's reticulum, and Mayer's mucicarmine) showed no evidence of secretory material, but small thin reticulum-like fibers FIG. 9 . Sarcoma in the salivary gland region of a male rat exposed to 3500 ppm. Normal acinar structures are present with tumor cells infiltrating through the gland. H&E stain, X4. were present around many, but not all, of the individual cells. In addition, three sarcomas were examined ultrastructurally. Formalin-fixed tumor tissue was prepared for electron microscopy from the one male rat of the control group and from two males from the 3500-ppm exposure group. Ultrastructurally, the cells most resembled mesenchymal cells and contained prominent rough endoplasmic reticulum, polyribosomes, variable amounts of cytoplasmic fibrils, and a few mitochondria. Collagen was present between many of the tumor cells. As expected, the Formalin fixation interfered somewhat with the ultrastructural evaluation. However, prominent secretory elements were not a part of these cells and desmosomes were not found connecting tumor cells to each other. Groups of females exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm had incidences of pituitary tumors of 24, 30, and 16%, respectively, compared to 34% in the controls. Decreased pituitary tumors may represent an exposurerelated effect in female rats exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm. The total number of rats with a tumor, the total with benign tumors, and the total with malignant tumors were evaluated. The cu-mulative numbers of all tumors, either benign or malignant, was no different in control or exposed groups of female rats. Pathologic observations in hamsters. In view of the voluminous nature of the data, only selected findings are summarized in Table 3 . All hamsters had some hemosiderin in the liver. At the 6-month loll, 5 of 5 males exposed to 3500 ppm had a larger amount of pigment compared to 0 of 5, 1 of 4 and 3 of 5 in the 0-, 500-, and 1500-ppm groups, respectively. This trend was not apparent in exposed females. The results at 12 months were similar and seemed to indicate a trend for more pigment in males exposed to 3500 ppm, since 5 of 5 males in the 3500-ppm group had a larger amount of pigment compared to 1 of 5, 1 of 5 and 3 of 5 in the 0-, 500-, and 1500-ppm groups, respectively. The toxicological significance of the increased hemosiderin is unclear; however, it is probably a slight exposure-related effect in the liver of male (but not female) hamsters exposed to 3500 ppm for 6 or 12 months. Amyloid deposits were common in control hamsters, especially in females. The lesions and distribution were similar to reports of other investigators (Renshaw et al., 1975; Dunham and Herrold, 1962; Former, 1957;  Gleiser et al., 197 1; Russfield, 1965) . In excess of 50% of the control males and 90% of the control females had amyloid in some organ. The severity varied greatly and many organs were commonly affected, including liver, kidneys, spleen, adrenal glands, and thyroid gland. Occasionally, amyloid was found in other tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract and lymph nodes. Hamsters exposed to methylene chloride had less amyloid than controls ( Table 3 ). The exposed hamsters had a decreased incidence as well as a reduced severity when compared to controls. This was evident in most of the exposure-related gross and histopathologic lesions, and usually with a dose-response relationship. Furthermore, control hamsters with severe amyloidosis often had many secondary lesions including atrophy of the genitalia, loss of body fat, and liver failure (including ascites, hydrothorax, pulmonary edema, and subcutaneous edema). These parameters were also decreased in exposed hamsters, probably because of the decreased severity of amyloidosis. In addition to decreased amyloid, male and female hamsters exposed to methylene chloride had fewer bilk-y cysts in the liver. Male hamsters exposed to 3500 ppm had decreased histopathologically observed mineral deposits in the renal cortex or medulla. On the other hand, females exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm had increased mineral deposits in the kidneys. The significance of these findings is unclear. Male (500-, 1500-, and 3500-ppm groups) and female (1500-and 3500-ppm groups) hamsters had increased hemosiderin pigment in the adrenals. This pigment is common, but often becomes difficult to recognize if amyloid deposits are present. Males in all three exposure groups had increased small hyperplastic foci in the adrenal cortex. Amyloid was decreased in these groups and, as a result, may have made these lesions more easily recognized. However, the decmased amyloid may have also altered the occurrence of these lesions in the adrenals. The total number of hamsters with a tumor, the number with a benign tumor, and the number with a malignant tumor were evaluated and no exposure-related differences were recognized in male hamsters. A statistically significant increase in the total number of benign tumors was observed in females exposed to 3500 ppm, but this was considered to be secondary to the increased survival of this group.
