From June 2008 to June 2012, nine boys and six girls (age range, 0.5 to 16 years; median age, 3.5 AE 4.40 years) diagnosed with ADEM were treated at Adana Hospital (Adana, Turkey). Five children (33.3%) were below the age of 3 years, three children (20%) were in the 3-to 6-year age group, five children (33.3%) were in the 6-to 12-year age group, and two children (13.3%) were in the 12-to 18-year age group. The follow-up time after diagnosis ranged from 0.6 to 4 years (median, 1.8 AE 1.11 years). The cases occurred in a seasonal distribution with 73.3% (11/15) presenting in winter or spring. Only four cases (26.7%) occurred in summer, and no cases were encountered in late fall (Table 1) . Eighty-six percent of patients (13/15) had a history of acute febrile illness 2 to 40 days before presentation, with an average of 7 days between onset of acute febrile illness and the appearance of neurologic symptoms. Of these 13 patients, 10 (76.9%) had an upper respiratory tract infection and three (23.1%) had acute gastroenteritis. One of the patients with preceding upper respiratory tract infection also received a combined vaccine (diphtheria-tetanus-acellular, pertussisinactivated, polio, Haemophilus influenzae B) 6 weeks before admission. No preceding illness could be identified in the two other children (13.3%). Five children had serologic evidence of specific triggers: mycoplasma (2 children); influenza-A (H1N1) (1 child), Epstein-Barr virus (2 children) ( Table 1) . The most common presenting symptom was gait disturbance (12/15, 80%), followed by altered consciousness (10/15, 66.7%), fever (7/15, 46.7%), headache (4/15, 26.7%), seizures (4/15, 26.7%), meningismus (4/15, 26.7%), and vomiting (3/15, 20%). Of the 10 children presenting with altered consciousness, three exhibited lethargy, five stupor, and two were in a coma. Five of the patients had behavioral changes, three of them exhibited irritability, and two displayed confusion. Details of the clinical presentation are presented in Table 1 . The leukocytes ranged from 2000 to 25,700/mm 3 (median, 10,000 AE 6873/mm 3 ). Leukocytes were normal in 10 patients, while two had leukopenia and three had leukocytosis. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate ranged from 3 to 73 mm/hr (median, 29 AE 21.2). CSF examination showed pleocytosis (>20/ml) in five patients (33.3%) and protein elevation in four patients (>40 mg/dL, median, 25 AE 24.5, range 11-110 mg/dL). Oligoclonal bands in CSF were measured in all patients, but only one patient showed intrathecal synthesis (case 4, Table 2 ). Electroencephalograms were recorded in eight patients, three of which showed generalized slowing (cases 1, 2, and 10), and one showed focal epileptiform discharges (case 6). The electroencephalogram was normal in four patients. Head CT scans were acquired in 14 of 15 patients but revealed lesions in only three (cases 10, 14, and 15) ( Table 3) , while MRI revealed cerebral lesions in all 15 patients (summarized in Table 3 Follow-up MRI showed complete resolution in 12 patients and partial resolution in two other patients (cases 2 and 15, Table 3 and Fig 1) . Case 10 had multiple new lesions in brain and spinal cord during follow-up and was eventually diagnosed with MS (Table 3 , Fig 2) . Ten patients were treated with a standard protocol of 3 to 5 days of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) followed by oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg) for 2 weeks, tapering off within 2 weeks along with symptomatic treatment. Three patients received both the standard steroid protocol and intravenous immunoglobulin-G (IVIG) therapy. Patients showing continued deterioration were also administered IVIG (2 g/kg) divided over 2 days. One patient (case 10) was treated with the standard 5-day treatment of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) plus IVIG, followed by oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg) for 3 months and tapered off within the next 3 months. Due to recurrent attacks, one girl was put on daily prednisolone. Since new attacks occurred daily under prednisolone, she was also prescribed azathioprine and then daily azathioprine alone. In case 5, because clinical findings were improved spontaneously when MRI was applied, neither IVIG nor steroid treatment was given. Oseltamivir was administered in one patient with influenza-A (case 2) and clarithromycin was administered in patients with mycoplasma (cases 5 and 15). Follow-up evaluation ranged from 0.6 to 4 years (median, 1.8 AE 1.11 years). When the study was concluded in June 2012, only one child (case 10) was still experiencing recurrent attacks. Investigations to exclude vasculitis, vasculopathy, and chronic infection were then conducted. However, serology for these disorders was negative. Visual-evoked potential recordings were also performed. The results were compatible with demyelination in visual pathways, and she had multiple new symptomatic or asymptomatic lesions on MRI and was diagnosed as possible MS. The other cases showed no clinical deterioration or recurrent
