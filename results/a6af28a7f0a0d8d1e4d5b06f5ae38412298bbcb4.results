Based on Definitions 1-4, the majority of CoV infection episodes were asymptomatic. When stratified by type, differences emerge: CoV-NL63 was more than twice as likely to produce symptomatic infection episodes as CoV-229E (by Definitions 1-4). Definition 5, which defines symptomatic infection as the manifestation of any symptom during the 11day window spanning the initial positive swab collection, indicates that a majority of infected persons reported at least one mild cold-related symptom. Participants reported taking medicine in response to cold and flu symptoms for 26% (n=35) of CoV infection episodes. Participants were three times more likely to take medicine in association with CoV-NL63 infection (40%) than CoV-229E infection (12%). 10% of participants reported staying home from work or school during CoV infection episodes, and 4% of participants reported seeking medical care.
