Part-rough, part-smooth fractions of the transition endoplasmic reticulum fraction from rat liver when resuspended in ATP, ATP regenerating system and c3~osol, were observed to contain =60 nm bebs and vesicles reminiscent of transition vesicles produced in situ ( Fig. 1 ; see Nowack et al. [IS] for a comparison). These vesicles appeared to vary in number as a result of incubation at different temperatures. To quantitate the numbers of vesicles present, the preparations were pelleted onto nitrocellulose filters, prepared for electron microscopy, and the pellets were photographed through their entire cross sectional area. All vesicles were counted in 3 representative 40/~m 2 areas. Only circular profiles with solid interiors representing filled vesicles rather than cross sections of hollow tubules, and in the approximate size range to be transition vesicles were scored as transition vesicles. Many were still connected to the transitional endoplasmic reticulum membranes by a narrow stalk (Fig. 1, inset) . The numbers of putative transition vesicles present in the resuspended membranes was approximately 1.5 membrane profiles per 100 membrane profiles at 4°C (Fig. 2) . With increasing temperature, the number of additional vesicles followed a hyperbolic function of increase to approximatively double at 37°C with Qi0 of increase of about 2 over the temperature range 12°C to 37°C. By extrapolation, the temperature dependent formation of 60 nm vesicles below 16°C was insignificant. The effect of temperature on transition vesicle production in situ was examined with liver slices as well. The morphology of the Golgi apparatus of the slices at 8°C (Figs. 3A and 4A) was representative of that observed both at 4°C and at 12°C. Golgi apparatus with characteristic stacked cisternae were present at all temperatures so that Golgi apparatus zones could be readily located. Over the temperature range 4°C to 12°C, transition vesicles were sparse. However, transition elements were well developed and numerous tubular smooth elements of the endoplasmic reticulum were evident within the Golgi zone adjacent to the c/s Golgi apparatus face. These tubular smooth-surfaced membranes were more evident after 60 rain of incubation (Fig. 4A ) than after 30 rain of incubation (Fig. 3A) . With slices incubated at 16°C (Fig. 4B ) or 18°C ( Fig.  3B and 4C) , the most obvious morphological aReration from the appearance at 12cC was an i~crease in the number of transition vesicles. Especially with 60 rain of incubation, the vesicles accumulated in clusters, usually near the cis Golgi apparatus face between the c/s Golgi apparatus cisternae and the transitional endoplasmie reticulum. The tubular transitional membranes were still present at both 16~C and 18°C but were less evident than at 8°C or 12°C. At 20°C, the appearance of the Golgi apparatus zone was changed markedly from that at 16°C or 18°C ( Fig.  3C and 4D ). The number of transition vesicles was reduced compared to 18°C and those vesicles present were no longer present in clusters. Additionally, the tubular smooth membrane elements present throughout the Golgi apparatus zone at temperatures of 18°C and below were much less in evidence. With further increases in temperature, the numbers of transition vesicles appeared to be increased slightly but the tubular elements of the endoplasmic reticulum did not reappear within the Golgi apparatus zone. Overall, the numbers of transition vesicles present at the cis Golgi apparatus face showed an increase with increasing temperature to an optimum at 16°C (30 rain) or 18°C (60 rain) with an abrupt decline in transition vesicle numbers between 18°C and 20°C (Fig. 5) . As with the isolated fractions (Fig. 2) , the numbers of transition vesicles did not appear to increase until temperatures exceeded 12°C. Neither did they accumulate in large numbers at temperatures above 18°C presumably through release of the temperature block at temperatures below 18°C that allowed for their formation but retarded their fusion with the Golgi apparatus. The distribution of diameters of transition vesicles present in situ at 4°C differed from those present in vitro with isolated transition elements at 4°C (Fig. 6) . Those formed in vitro exhibited a larger diameter of 72/~m compared to 55 ~m in ~itu. Comparing vesicles formed in situ at 37°C with those formed at 40C (Fig. 6) , the diameters ~so were shifted to larger values in the distribution profile ,~.z~d the average diameter was increased to 65/~m. A similar increase in vesicle diameter was seen with the transition vesicle formed in vitro from 73/~m at 4°C to 88/~m at 37°C. Since most previous investigations of temperature effects on transition~ endoplasmic reticulum have been with cultured cells, studies were carried out with BHK cells under identical conditions of temperature incubations used for liver slices. At 16°C (Fig. 7A) , the general appearance The use of inhibitors to interrupt the flow of membrane~ between the endoplasmie reticulum and the Golgi apparatus might be expected to have effects similar to low temperatures. Therefore, BHK cells were treated with substances to block membrane flow. Potassium cyanide blocks secretion, presumably by reducing the cellular energy charge, but did not result in an accumulation of transition vesicles (Fig. 9B ) compared with control preparations (Fig. 9A) with 15, 30 or 60 rain of incubation. In contrast, 1 mM CoC! 2 conditions known to block vesicular flow in other systems and axonal transport (see Discussion), did produce morphological changes very similar to those observed with the low temperature block (Fig. 9C) . Numbers of transition vesicles were approximately doubled relative to the control preparations and the peripheral cytoplasm contained numerous tubular transition elements of the endoplasmic reticulum similar in appearance to those observed with incubation at 16°C (Fig.  7A) . These morphological changes were observed with incubation times with 1 mM CoCI 2 as short as 15 rain and the alterations after 60 rain (not illustrated) of incubation were similar to those after 30 rain of inct:bation (Fig. 6,  Fig. 9C ).
