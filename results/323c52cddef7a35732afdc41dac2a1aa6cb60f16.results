Both 16S rRNA and cyt-b sequences were perfectly aligned without any insertions/deletions (indels) whereas numerous indels at various sites of different taxa were required to align the sequences of d-loop (please refer to electronic supplementary fi le). The average frequencies of identical (conserved) sequences between the taxa were 97.65% for 16S rRNA, 94.22% for cyt-b and 87.29% for d-loop (Fig. 1) . On an average there were few transitions (2.35%) and none transversions in 16S rRNA as compared to cyt-b (5.61% transitions and 0.17% transversions) and d-loop (11.57% transitions and 1.14% transversions) (Fig. 1) . The results of Tajima's neutrality are given in Table 1 . Both the number of segregating sites (S) and nucleotide diversities (π) were directly correlated and were in the order of 16S rRNA (S = 17, π = 0.025) Ͻ cyt-b (S = 125, π = 0.058) Ͻ d-loop (S = 270, π = 0.122) ( Table 1 ). The test of homogeneity of substitution patterns showed certain identities and certain variations in disparity index as well as Monte Carlo probability for different mitochondrial markers ( Table 2) . The topologies of all the Bayesian trees were identical irrespective of the marker type, which clearly differentiated the genus Addax from Oryx, and grouped Oryx dammah with Oryx leucoryx (Fig. 2) . The UPGMA trees resulting from 16S rRNA and d-loop sequences were also identical (Oryx dammah grouped with Oryx leucoryx) to Bayesian trees except that the UPGMA tree based on cyt-b showed a slightly different phylogeny (Oryx dammah grouped with Oryx gazella) with a low bootstrap support (Fig. 3) . The MP method failed to differentiate the genus Addax from Oryx and Addax nasomaculatus was either grouped with Oryx leucoryx (16S rRNA or cyt-b) or with Oryx gazella (d-loop) (Fig. 4 ).
