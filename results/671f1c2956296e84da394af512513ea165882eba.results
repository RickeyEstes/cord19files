[Pyr 1 ]Apelin-13 (1-12) Is Synthesized from [Pyr 1 ]Apelin-13 by ACE2 As shown in the mass spectra, [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 ( Figure 3A) and [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1-12) (Figure 3B ) alone produced signals at 1533.8 and 1386.7 m/z, respectively. Incubating [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 with rhACE2 resulted in a signal at the mass-to-charge ratio of 1386.7, corresponding to de novo generation of [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1-12) , with a weak signal representing the remaining parent peptide ( Figure 3C ). In contrast, incubating [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1-12) with rhACE2 ( Figure 3D ) did not produce shorter apelin fragments. Finally, rhACE2 enzyme alone ( Figure 3E ) did not result in interfering signals in the relevant mass range. [Pyr 1 ]Apelin-13 (1-12) Is an Endogenous Apelin Peptide Localized to the Endothelium Endogenous [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1-12) peptide was detectable in human cardiovascular tissues and localized to the endothelium (Figure 4) . [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1-12) -like immunoreactivity (-LI) was detected in vascular ( Figure 4A ) and endocardial ( Figure 4B ) endothelium identified by positive staining with vWF ( Figure 4C ) in sections of human cardiomyopathy heart, where ACE2 expression has been reported to be increased (Zisman et al., 2003; Goulter et al., 2004) . [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1-12) -LI ( Figure 4D ) and vWF-LI ( Figure 4E) were also co-expressed ( Figure 4F ) in human lung. Importantly, [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1-12) -LI ( Figure 4G ) and ACE2-LI ( Figure 4H ) co-localized ( Figure 4I) in pulmonary blood vessels. Importantly, as apelin is reduced in PAH, the presence of [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1-12) was investigated in sections of human PAH lung. Compared to normal lung (Figure 4J) , [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1-12) -LI was not detectable in the vascular endothelium of PAH lung (Figures 4K,L) .
