From January 2001 to June 2006 a total of 177 patients presenting to NTUH ED with MRSA bacteraemia were included. The clinical characteristics of the patients are summarised in CRBSI was the most common type of infection (22.6%), followed by STI (20.9%), primary bacteraemia (15.3%), lower respiratory tract infection (13.6%), orthopaedic infection (9.0%), IE (6.8%), UTI (5.6%), endovascular infection other than IE (5.1%) and biliary infection (1.1%). The most common underlying illnesses were diabetes mellitus (36.7%) and renal insufficiency (24.9%). An intravenous catheter was used in 31.1% of patients. The in-hospital mortality rate was 33.3% and was associated with increased age, persistent bacteraemia, polymicrobial bacteraemia, fewer debridements, rapidly fatal disease according to the McCabe classification, higher Pitt bacteraemia score, septic shock, lower respiratory tract infection, active malignancy and metastatic infection ( Table 1) . Analysis of patients who died within 14 days revealed a similar set of risk factors, as well as lower mortality rate amongst patients with STI-associated bacteraemia. Differences in mortality rates amongst different types of infection were significant. For in-hospital mortality, bacteraemia due to lower respiratory tract infection carried the highest mortality (66.7%), whilst bacteraemia secondary to orthopaedic infection carried the lowest (6.3%). The mortality rate amongst different types of infection is shown in Fig. 1 . To explore the efficacy of treatment response, patients who died within 3 days of the ED visit (n = 24), with McCabe rapidly fatal disease (n = 9) or mortality not related to MRSA bacteraemia (n = 3) were excluded. After excluding these patients, 141 patients remained. The in-hospital mortality of this group was 17.7% (Table 2) . Fewer risk factors associated with mortality were identified in this group. These included increased age, persistent bacteraemia, ultimately fatal disease and non-fatal disease according to the McCabe classification, higher Pitt bacteraemia score, septic shock, lower respiratory tract infection and metastatic infection. A logistic regression analysis of mortality in this group revealed that age (P = 0.021; odds ratio (OR) = 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.13), persistent bacteraemia (P = 0.024; OR = 17.52, 95% CI 1.45-211.76), ultimately fatal disease (P = 0.014; OR = 7.99, 95% CI 1.53-41.59) and Pitt bacteraemia score (P = 0.024; OR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.04-1.69) were significant risk factors for mortality. The association of metastatic infection with mortality was of borderline significance (P = 0.057; OR = 4.47, 95% CI 0.96-20.88). Empirical glycopeptide therapy was not associated with decreased mortality. All MRSA isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid and daptomycin ( Table 3 ). The MICs of vancomycin for all MRSA isolates were between 1 g/mL and 2 g/mL. A detrimental effect of increased vancomycin MICs on patient outcome could not be demonstrated despite separate analyses using the different definitions of outcome. Intravenous linezolid was used in six patients later in the course of hospitalisation (four due to treatment failure with glycopeptides and two due to cytopenia using glycopeptides) and oral linezolid was prescribed for three patients following glycopeptide therapy (oral switch).
