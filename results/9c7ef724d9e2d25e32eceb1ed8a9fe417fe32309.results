Albumin, alpha-1 fraction, expressed in g and as %, and A/G ratio were normally distributed. Mean, median, and 95% confidence interval of concentrations of total protein and ALB and alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2, and gamma globulin fractions concentrations, evaluated at different time of storage, are reported in Table 1 . Concentrations (g/dL) of The Scientific World Journal 3 Table 1 : Mean, median, and confidence interval 95% (95% CI) of total protein (TP) concentrations (biuret method), concentrations of albumin (ALB) and alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2, and gamma globulin fractions (agarose gel electrophoresis), and calculated albumin/globulin (A/G) ratios in fresh plasma samples and plasma samples stored frozen (−20 ∘ C) and then thawed, collected from 20 adult cows for transfusion purposes. TP, ALB, and beta-2 fractions show significantly different increase from fresh and frozen plasma. The results indicate that plasma concentrations (g/dL) of TP and ALB change after 1 month of storage at −20 ∘ C, whereas concentrations of beta-2 protein fractions were stable for 6 months at −20 ∘ C. The significant effects of storage time on mean concentration of TP and on the concentration of protein fractions with the percentage of variation observed in fresh and frozen/thawed sera for each protein fraction are reported in Table 2 . On electropherograms there were 6 protein fractions: albumin, alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2, and gamma globulins. All samples analyzed at the different time of storage had comparable electrophoretic patterns (Figure 1 ).
