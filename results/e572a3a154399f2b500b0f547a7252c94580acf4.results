The training data included 40 provinces and spanned January 2003-October 2010. The fine-tuning data included October 2009-October 2010 data for the same 40 provinces. The testing data spanned March 2011-December 2011 for 40 provinces. The results reported below are based only on the performance of the models in predicting the 2011 incidence data that were not used for model development. In addition to the results for 40 provinces with good data reporting, the results for all 81 provinces are also provided in order to determine how well the model can generalize to provinces that were never used in model development.
