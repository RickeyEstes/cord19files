From June 2008 to August 2013, 2660 trainees enrolled and had specimens tested for respiratory pathogens. Ad VI took place week 48, 2011; 72% of this cohort enrolled pre-VI vs 28% post-VI. None of the pre-VI subjects received Ad vaccine, vs 93% post-VI. Overall, 86% were male, with a median age of 20 years. Enrollments ranged from 437 to a peak of 757 in 2009 for years with a complete calendar-year of data. Trainees reported a perceived stress level of 4 on a 10-point Likert scale. Post-VI, the male predominance of enrolled subjects decreased from 89% to 79% (P < .01) (see Table 1 ). Clinical characteristics are presented in Table 2 . Before VI, 91% of subjects had a recorded oral temperature >100.4Â°F, vs 10% afterward. One or more diagnoses representative or URI, LRTI, or both, were present in 64.3% pre-VI and 74.5% post-VI. Terms associated with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) were more commonly included post-VI (26.1% vs 12.9%, P < .01) and terms associated with URI were less commonly included post-VI (79.0% vs 89.5%, P < .01). Those with the diagnosis of "pneumonia" in the post-VI period were predominantly afebrile (89.5%). Supporting radiographs, if performed, were unavailable. The term "allergic" or "allergy" was included in none of the diagnoses pre-VI, but was included in 8.1% post-VI (P < .01); 75% of these were listed in combination with some other diagnosis of URI or LRTI. Clinical signs and symptoms specifically associated with Ad vs rhinovirus were also compared, with similar findings as those seen in general for pre-and post-VI (data not shown). The exceptions were the loss of statistical significance between those describing malaise and with abnormal tympanic membrane examinations. Those with Ad vs rhinovirus also more often described sore throat (90.8%, 83.1%, P < .01) and had more documented tonsillitis (23.5% vs 13.8%, P < .01). Influenza A detections were less frequent post-VI; H1 accounted for the majority of the pre-VI detections, and these were all in 2009. In subjects with documented fever post-VI (n = 69), rhinovirus accounted for the largest proportion of Abbreviations: IQR, interquartile range; VI, vaccine introduction. a Abnormal examination: any of the following: "decreased breath sounds, rales, crackles, rhonchi, wheezes" for lungs, "abnormal, dull, erythematous, effusion" for tympanic membranes; "gallop, murmur, abnormal rhythm" for cardiac; "abnormal bowel sounds, distended, tender" for abdominal. these (n = 24), with influenza detected in 7 cases and any Ad in 5 (4 serotype 4, 1 serotype 3). Twenty-one of these had no pathogen detected The rate of detection of rhinovirus doubled in the post-VI period; an increase in raw numbers of rhinovirus positive enrollments per month was also seen despite lower enrollments in general (see Table 3 ). Pre-VI, there were 1.9 rhinovirus positive cases per week, and 10.5 enrolled/week; post-VI, 2.9/ week were rhinovirus positive, among 8.5 enrolled/week.
