Tandem nucleic acid mass tag-PNA oligonucleotide probe design and synthesis Two pairs of example TNT-PNA oligonucleotide probes are shown in part (i) of Figure 2a and b. The TNTs are peptides comprising two parts, the tag fragment portion, which carries a charge due to the presence of a tertiary amino-functionality and the mass normalization portion, which remains essentially uncharged. These two portions of the tag are linked by a cleavage enhancement group, a piperazine ring, which also carries the charge of the tag fragment on its tertiary amino-group. The two tag portions both comprise a mass modifier component, which are isotopes of alanine in this tag although a large number of different mass modifiers could be used. It can be seen from Figure 2 that the two tags shown employ the same mass modifier components but the order differs Beta Alanine -Aspartic Acid -Proline -13 C 3 , 15 N-Alanine -Piperazin-1-ylacetic acid -Alanine TNT2 Beta Alanine -Aspartic Acid -Proline -Alanine -Piperazin-1-ylacetic acid -13 C 3 , 15 N-Alanine between the tags. Thus, the overall masses of the tags are the same but the tag fragments have different masses, which are equalized by the mass of the mass normalization portion. These tags are designed so that on analysis by collision-induced dissociation (CID), the tag fragment is released to give rise to a uniquely resolvable ion. Thus, this pair of tags allows a pair of PNA probes to be distinguished by MS/MS analysis. Each tag is linked to a PNA oligonucleotide probe by a second linker, comprising aspartic acid and proline that is easily cleaved by CID (37) . As shown in Figure 2 , the aspartic acid/proline linker is used to cleave the tags from their oligonucleotides during electrospray ionization of the tagged oligonucleotides. The expected structures and mass-to-charge ratios of the cleaved parent tag ions generated by dissociation of the aspartic acid/proline linkage are shown in part (ii) of figure 2a and b (37) . Similarly, the expected structures and mass-to-charge ratios of the tag fragment ions and the structures of the neutral mass normalizer fragments, based on the predictions of the 'mobile proton' model of peptide fragmentation (38, 39) , are shown in part (iii) of Figure 2a and b. The use of FMOC peptide synthesis chemistry to synthesize the TNTs combined with FMOC PNA chemistry to synthesize the oligonucleotide probe sequence means the same resin can be used to synthesize both portions of the tagged probe in a single total synthesis approach. For the probes discussed here, the TNT portion of the probe was synthesized in a commercial peptide synthesizer using standard peptide synthesis resin cartridges. The cartridge was then opened and the resin within was loaded into a cartridge suitable for a commercial oligonucleotide synthesizer that supports PNA synthesis (Expedite DNA/PNA synthesizer), allowing the completion of the synthesis of the probe. The completed probe was then cleaved from the resin and deprotected in one step (TFA/cresol) and then purified. With this approach, only one purification step is required resulting in better yields of finished probe than multi-stage processes. Figure 3 illustrates the ease with which a substantial number of tags can be synthesized from a small set of mass modifier components: nine tags, shown in Figure 3b can be made from three mass modifiers, which are the three commercially available isotopes of alanine shown in Figure 3a . In fact, the number of tags that can be synthesized increases as the square of the number of mass modifier components, e.g. there are at least five isotopes of alanine with different masses that are commercially available which would actually allow the synthesis of 25 tags using the design presented here. One issue that emerged from the experiments presented here was a loss of 13 C isotope from the carboxylic acid of alanine when the alanine isotope was present at the C-terminus of the peptide TNT, i.e. in TNT2 shown in Table 1 . This loss is consistent across every TNT-PNA synthesized with TNT2 and may be an effect of the resin used, which relied on a 4-HydroxyMethyl-Phenoxy Acetic acid (HMPA) linker to the carboxylic acid group of the first amino acid to allow the peptide to be cleaved from the resin at the end of the synthesis. Other resins will be tested in future to avoid the loss of isotope. This has meant that the TNTs synthesized were not completely isobaric as shown in Figure 2 . The mass of the singly charged parent tag ion of TNT1 is 388.2 while that of TNT2 is 387.2. For the MS/MS analysis of these tags, both tags could still be selected simultaneously by the first quadrupole of the Q-TOF instrument, as the mass range that is gated is actually about 3 daltons for the default setting of The TNT approach is similar in principle to other mass tagging techniques and enjoys the same features as other approaches, such as ease of multiplexing and the ability to design tag masses to suit applications, with some additional advantages. TNT tags can be made chemically identical, even sharing the same mass as long as the tag fragments are different, so they can act as more precise reciprocal internal standards, which leads to more accurate quantification and the same behaviour in analytical separations, hybridizations and labelling reactions thus avoiding 'dye effects' that plague fluorescent methods (40, 41) . The use of an MS/MS-based detection method allows TNTs to be selected from background noise thus improving signal to noise ratios. This allows untagged material to be ignored, greatly improving data quality.
