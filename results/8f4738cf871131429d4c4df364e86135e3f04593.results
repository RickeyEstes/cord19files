Of the 16 EBOV entry inhibitors reported previously (Johansen et al., 2013 (Johansen et al., , 2015 Kouznetsova et al., 2014) , we found that the FDA-approved drugs chloroquine (CQ), clomiphene, amodiaquine, alverine and sertraline could inhibit the early stages of ZIKV infection (Fig. 1A) . Consistent with the fact that ribavirin is a polymerase inhibitor, it did not disrupt ZIKV entry in our experiment, therefore it served as a negative control (Fig. 1A) . Since clomiphene cannot be given safely to pregnant women (Legro et al., 2007) , and amodiaquine, alverine and sertraline were less effective inhibitors, we focused on CQ, which had an efficacy similar to the known 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) ZIKV entry inhibitor (Li et al., 2017) . The IC50 of CQ against ZIKV (GZ01, a recent Asian lineage strain ) is about 4.15 μM in Vero cells and 1.72 μM in Huh7 cells (Fig. 1B-C) , while there was no cytotoxicity induced by CQ even at 10 μM (Fig. S1 ) (Kouznetsova et al., 2014) . CQ also inhibits the ZIKV FSS13025 strain (old Asian lineage), with an IC50 of 2.72 μM in Huh7 cells (Fig. 1D) . In order to detect which step of the ZIKV life cycle is inhibited by CQ, an internalization assay was performed as previously described (Talarico et al., 2005) using the RNA synthesis internalized ZIKV (F) were detected using plaque assay and qRT-PCR, respectively. (G) ZIKV replicon RNA was transfected into BHK-21 cells. 6 h later, CQ or NITD008 were used to treat cells for 48 h. Renilla luciferase activity was measured with a microplate reader. All data are shown as mean ± SEM from three independent experiments, *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001, unpaired student t-test. inhibitor, NITD008, as a negative control. The results showed that CQ suppressed ZIKV internalization effectively, while NITD008 did not (Fig. 1F) . However, CQ did not interfere with ZIKV binding to cells or RNA synthesis (Fig. 1E, G) . Next, we tested the ability of CQ to protect against ZIKV infection in vivo. 3-4 week-old immunocompetent BALB/c mice were treated with CQ (100 mg/kg) by intragastric administration (i.g.) 6 h before ZIKV infection by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route (GZ01 strain, 10 5 PFU/mouse). CQ treatment significantly suppressed ZIKV infection in mice compared to the PBS control at 1 day post-infection (dpi) (Fig. 2A) . We then used the IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR)-deficient A129 mouse model (Dai et al., 2016; Lazear et al., 2016) to further evaluate the protective effects of CQ on ZIKV infection. A129 mice were treated with PBS or CQ (i.g., 100 mg/kg) 6 h before ZIKV infection (GZ01 strain, 10 3 PFU/mouse), and daily for the following 5 days. Viremia was measured at 3 and 5 dpi, and it was found to be significantly reduced in CQ-treated mice ( Fig. 2B-C) . Since CQ transmitted through breastmilk was found to inhibit human coronavirus OC43 infection in newborn mice through maternal milk (Keyaerts et al., 2009) , we then tested the effects of CQ on ZIKV infection in a neonatal mouse model (Fig.  2D ). We found that CQ treatment of mother mice could improve survival of ZIKV-infected suckling neonatal mice by about 90% (Fig. 2D ). If CQ was administrated at 12 hour post infection (hpi), this protective effect was reduced, and became completely absent when postponing CQ treatment to 24 hpi. These results showed that CQ can suppress ZIKV mouse infection. Previously, we have shown that 25HC and convalescent serum from a patient who recovered from ZIKV infection both protected embryonic mice from ZIKV infection and its associated microcephaly (Li et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017) . Here we adopted the same model to investigate the effect of CQ on littermate embryos. ZIKV (~350 pfu) or culture medium was injected into the cerebroventricular space in the brains of embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) ICR mice. Pregnant mice were treated with PBS (Veh) or CQ (i.g., 100 mg/kg) 6 h before infection of the embryonic brains, and then once a day from E13.5 to E18.5. The mice were sacrificed and inspected at E18.5. First, we investigated whether CQ could protect mice from microcephaly caused by ZIKV infection. Compared to the mock-infected or ZIKV-infected CQ-treated groups, the average brain sizes of ZIKV-infected but untreated mice were significantly smaller (Fig. 3A ). In addition, the brains of those mice had a significantly thinner cortex compared to the brains of uninfected or CQ-treated mice (Fig. 3B ). The reduced thickness of different layers of cortex was confirmed by immunostaining with NeuN and Tbr1 antibodies ( Fig. 3B and Fig. S2 ). We next explored whether CQ treatment could suppress ZIKV infection in fetal brains. Immunostaining with an anti-ZIKV serum showed that the embryonic brains infected with ZIKV and treated with CQ had a dramatically reduced burden of ZIKV compared to untreated infected brains (Fig. 3C) . Similarly, the intensity of cells positive for the activated form of Caspase 3, an indicator of apoptosis, was also reduced substantially after CQ treatment (Fig. 3D) . These findings indicate that CQ can significantly reduce ZIKV infection and its associated apoptotic effects in the fetal brain, which has been shown previously to be a contributing factor in the development of microcephaly Wang et al., 2017) . The infection of neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) and the dysregulation of their proliferation and differentiation may also contribute to thinner VZ/SVZ cortical layers and microcephaly Wang et al., 2017) . We investigated whether CQ could prevent this effect on NPC proliferation after ZIKV infection. As shown in Fig. 3E , cells positive for phosphorylated histone H3 (P-H3, a marker for cells in M-phase) were significantly reduced in ZIKV-infected brains. Surprisingly, these cells were rescued by CQ therapy. Similarly, the reduction in Sox2 + (NPC marker) and Tbr2 + (intermediate/basal progenitor cell marker) cells were also reversed in those treated with CQ (Fig. 3F) . These findings correlate with changes in the cortical layer thickness and overall size of ZIKV-infected brains. Therefore, CQ treatment protects embryonic mice from ZIKV infection and its associated microcephaly.
