Identification of antigen-specific antibody-secreting cells, such as Bcells, hybridomas or cells transfected with plasmids encoding IgGgenes, is a crucial step during the process of isolating highly neutralizing antibodies. To facilitate this step and thereby promote the generation of novel broadly neutralizing antibodies against HSV and HCMV, we established two screening approaches to identify virus-specific antibody-secreting cells. Since the entry of HSV and HCMV is a highly complex process involving several viral surface proteins, we used intact virus particles for the screening procedure. This strategy allows identifying antibodies directed against the complex entry machinery including miscellaneous conformational epitopes. 3.1. Virus-based ELISA for identification of HSV-specific cells For the identification of HSV-specific cells, we established an ELISA that is based on the detection of HSV-specific antibodies bound to immobilized virus (Fig. 1) . The assay is designed for the screening of antibody-secreting cells or cell culture supernatants for HSV-specific antibodies. Microtiter plates are coated with HSV-1 ΔgE lacking the HSV-Fc-receptor (gE/gI complex) to minimize unspecific binding of antibodies (Fig. 1A) . The binding of the IgG-Fc domain to the HSV-Fcreceptor is species-specific. In contrast to murine antibodies, human IgGs bind to the HSV-1 Fc-receptor (Sprague et al., 2006) . To exclude unspecific binding when working with human antibody-secreting cells or antibodies in subsequent studies, we decided to establish this assay with the HSV-1 ΔgE mutant. The immobilized virus is then fixed and overlaid with murine human antibody-secreting cells. The cells are incubated for 48 h with the immobilized virus (Fig. 1B) . Subsequently, antibody-secreting cells and HSV-unspecific antibodies are removed (Fig. 1C) . Bound HSV-specific antibodies can be detected with a peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (Fig. 1D) . Cell cultures positive for virus-specific antibodies can subsequently be diluted to single cell level, expanded, retested for specific antibodies and selected for the production of monoclonal antibodies.
