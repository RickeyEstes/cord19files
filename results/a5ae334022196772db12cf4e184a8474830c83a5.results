Na + flux (table 1) . Under basal conditions, that is, in the absence of glucose, unidirectional fluxes in control and infected tissue did not differ; net fluxes were secretory and identical. Control tissue responded to glucose as expected with a significant increase in M ..... S flux (P < 0.001) and a change of net flux to absorption (P < 0.001). In TGE tissue, M ..... S Na + flux failed completely to respond to glucose, and although there was a significant increment in net flux (P < 0.005), it was significantly less than in control tissue (P < 0.001). Ouabain added after glucose caused a significant reduction in net Na+ flux in controls, (P < 0.01) but no significant change in TGE tissue, where net Na + flux was already zero. In the presence of theophylline, also added after glucose, the mean net Na + flux in control tissue decreased (P < 0.005); M ..... S Na+ flux decreased (P < 0.01); S ..... M flux increased significantly (P < 0.01) compared with data on the same tissue in the presence of glucose. In TGE tissue after theophylline, M-S Na + flux decreased (P < 0.001), mean net flux changed from -0.2 to -2.2, which was barely significant (P < 0.025), and S ..... M flux did not change significantly. Net Na+ flux did not differ significantly between the two study groups after theophylline. Cl-flux (table 1) . Under basal conditions, unidirectional and net Cl-fluxes in TGE tissue, like Na+ fluxes , did not differ from those in control tissue. The controls responded to glucose with an increase in Cl -M ..... S flux (P < 0.01), and decreased net Cl-flux (P < 0.025), which remained secretory; TGE tissue failed to respond significantly to glucose. After ouabain the apparent inhibition of net Cl -flux in control tissue and TGE was not significant although there was, in TGE tissue, a significant diminution in S-M flux (P < 0 .05) compared with the previous glucose period. Theophylline provoked significant increases in S-M flux and net Clsecretion (P < 0.001) in both control and TGE tissue; mean increments in the two groups did not differ significantly. Electrical data ( fig. 1 ). Under basal conditions, PD's in the infected group were slightly but significantly greater than in controls (P < 0.001), while short-circuit currents (Ise) did not differ between groups. After glucose the increments in both PD and Ise were significantly less in tissue from infected pigs than in controls (P < 0.001). Theophylline provoked the same brisk increase in PD and lac in both groups; ouabain induced a sharp drop to zero in both. Conductance of infected tissue was lower than that of control tissue (P < 0.005) under all experimental conditions. Na+ Transport in enterocytes. Table 2 summarizes the Na+ transport data from jejunal enterocytes isolated selectively from villi and studied in suspension. The Na+ efflux rate constant under basal conditions was significantly less in the infected group compared with controls; in the presence of ouabain it decreased and became equal in the two groups. In the presence of glucose, 10 mM, the rate constant for control cells increased significantly over that found under basal conditions, while the rate constant for cells from infected pigs failed completely to respond to glucose.
