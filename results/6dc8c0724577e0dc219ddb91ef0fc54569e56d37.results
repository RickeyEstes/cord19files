The first case-patient was a 52-year-old male farmer from Yanjiang District of Ziyang Prefecture. On June 24, 2005, three days after he slaughtered and dressed a goat that had died of an unknown cause, fever (38.2Â°C), chills, abdominal pain, vomiting, generalized aching, and generalized purpura developed. Ten hours later, he died on the way to the hospital. The second case-patient was his neighbor who had similar symptoms on June 26 and died shortly after hospital admission. He had helped slaughter the goat with the first case-patient. Blood, tissue, and other specimens for culture were not available from these patients. Other cases of S. suis infection occurred in early July. The number of cases gradually increased, peaked during the second half of July, and dwindled rapidly thereafter ( Figure 1 ). The decline coincided with new measures that prohibited domestic slaughter of sick pigs or pigs that died of any illness. These measures were implemented through provincial legislation and enforced with prosecution. The last case-patient had onset of illness on August 4. By August 18, two weeks after the date of onset of the last case, we had identified 215 cases (66 laboratory confirmed, 149 probable); 39 persons died in Sichuan Province. This finding compares to an expected number of suspected meningococcal disease cases of 10 per month reported through routine surveillance during the summer months (June to August) from 2003 to 2005 ( Figure 2 ). Cases of S. suis infection predominantly involved adult male farmers with recent exposure to sick pigs or carcasses of pigs that had died of unknown illnesses ( Table 1) . The most common methods of exposures were slaughtering a sick pig or preparing a pig carcass for meat, hides, and other pig products. Forty-eight percent of case-patients had wounds on their hands at the time of slaughter or carcass preparation. Illnesses that fit the case definition did not develop in close contacts of case-patients who did not participate in the slaughter, carcass preparation, or carcass disposal. None of the 417 healthcare workers who cared for case-patients became infected, and no similar clinical illness developed. The residences of S. suis case-patients were widely distributed in 203 villages of 12 prefectures in Sichuan Province. In 194 villages, only 1 case was identified ( Figure 3 ). In Ziyang, Yibin, and Chengdu, 2 case-patients in 1 village each were identified. The Ziyang cluster was composed of the first 2 case-patients in the outbreak. The Yibin cluster consisted of 1 farmer who slaughtered a sick pig and became ill with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS); another person who processed meat from the same pig became ill with meningitis and recovered. In Chengdu, 2 persons slaughtered a pig that had died of an unexplained illness; S. suis infection developed in both persons and they recovered. In 6 additional villages, >2 cases of S. suis infection occurred in patients who did not know each other and had no common exposure to a pig.
