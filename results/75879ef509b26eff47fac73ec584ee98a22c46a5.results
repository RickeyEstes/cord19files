A total of 184 healthcare workers who treated pilgrims during the 2009 Hajj season were included in the study. Of these, 161 answered the (main) pre-Hajj questionnaire and 104 answered the (short) post-Hajj questionnaire. A total of 120 combined nasal and throat swabs were obtained during the pre-and post-Hajj periods. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample are shown in Table 1 . The majority of the healthcare workers were males (85%) with an average age of 40.9 AE 9.2 years (range 23e59 years), Non-Saudi (71%), physicians (75%), with more than 10 years of medical experience (60%) as well as previous experience of serving in Hajj medical services (83%). Most of the healthcare workers (93%) described their own health as very good to excellent. Chronic disease, namely hypertension, diabetes, and asthma were present in 15% and 11% were current smokers. Compliance of healthcare workers with pre-Hajj vaccination and infection control is shown in Table 2 . Eighty four percent of them got at least one vaccine before Hajj. The coverage of hepatitis B, meningococcal and seasonal influenza vaccines were relatively high (73%, 67% and 51%, respectively), while the coverage of H1N1 vaccine was considerably low (22%). The main reasons described for not getting the vaccine were worries about the side effects, (42%), non-availability (34%), and fear of developing H1N1 symptoms (22%). Approximately 50% of the healthcare workers did not get seasonal influenza vaccine in the past year due to the belief of being healthy (29%), lack of knowledge about the place to get the vaccine (22%), and the assumption that influenza is not a serious illness (18%). Compliance with hand hygiene was noted in 98%, cough etiquette in 89% and wearing face mask in 90% of the healthcare workers. The Exposure Risk as defined by being within 1 m from a person with ILI was reported in 61%, handling biological specimens in 34% and examining patients in 76%. About 20% of them got sick or injured during Hajj. Background knowledge of the healthcare workers about H1N1 2009 is shown in Tables 3 and 4 . Eighty five percent believed that H1N1 is a serious disease, 80% were worried about catching H1N1 influenza during Hajj and 75% were aware of the main symptoms of H1N1 influenza. The main source or vehicle of H1N1 transmission as recognized by them were contact with people infected with H1N1 (86%), contaminated fomites (72%) and air (65%). Appreciable level of knowledge about measures to avoid H1N1 infection were noted as described by maintenance of hand hygiene (91%), wearing a mask (76%), cough/sneeze etiquette (76%), staying away from sick people (65%), using hand sanitizer (63%), avoiding crowds/public gatherings (62%) and taking H1N1 vaccine (58%). Among the 18 circulating respiratory virus types and subtypes, only two were detected in the healthcare workers in the pre-and post-Hajj period: rhinovirus (N Z 21, 12.6%) and coronavirus 229E (N Z 1, 0.6%) . Rhinovirus was detected more before the Hajj (N Z 14, 11.7%) than after (N Z 9, 7.5%), but the difference was not statistically significant. The only isolate of coronavirus was detected in the post-Hajj period. Two healthcare workers had rhinovirus detected both before and after the Hajj. Rhinovirus was detected in 21.1% of those who had respiratory symptoms and 30.0% of those who got sick during Hajj. No other respiratory viruses were detected in any of the samples. The prevalence (per 100 persons) of respiratory viruses according to age, sex, profession, smoking, vaccine, sickness, and wearing a mask is shown in Fig. 1 . The prevalence was slightly higher in healthcare workers who got sick during Hajj, in nurses, and in those who did not wear masks than in smokers; however, the difference was not statistically significant.
