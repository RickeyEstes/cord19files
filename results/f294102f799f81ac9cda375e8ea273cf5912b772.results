HBoV was detected in 45 of 376 nasopharyngeal aspirates (12%). It was the fourth most common virus in the material after RS-virus (25%), rhinovirus (17%) and human metapneumovirus (14%). Other common viruses in the material were enterovirus (11%) and coronavirus OC43 (11%). During the 4-month study period the occurrence of HBoV was stable, in contrast to coronavirus OC43, influenza A and RS-virus, which varied significantly ( Fig. 1 ). At least one virus was detected in 78% of the 376 samples in the total material. One solitary virus was found in 50%, Table 1 shows the distribution of the codetected viruses. HBoV was more frequently detected in samples from patients with multiple infections. The proportion of samples containing HBoV increased with the number of viruses found per sample (Table 2) . Based on semi quantitative evaluation HBoV was found to be the dominating virus in 15 of the 35 patients with multiple viral infections (43%). In the samples with a high load for HBoV significantly fewer multiple infections were found (p < 0.001, Fisher's exact test) ( Table 3 ). The same tendency was found for RS-virus, although not significant. Seventy-one percent of the HBoV-infected children had LRTI (bronchiolitis: 44% and pneumonia: 27%) and 20% had URTI. For the patients with HBoV recorded as either the dominating or the only virus the proportion of LRTI was 88%. In the group where HBoV was not the dominating agent the proportion was 50% (Table 4 ). The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.005, Fisher's exact test). The median age of the patients with HBoV-infection was 17 months. 58% were males. Table 5 shows the results of the bacterial cultures. The bacteria were equally distributed in the diagnosis groups, and no association was found between viral and bacterial agents. For the majority of the patients who probably had a bacterial pneumonia, the bacterial culture was negative. These patients had received antibiotics before admission.
