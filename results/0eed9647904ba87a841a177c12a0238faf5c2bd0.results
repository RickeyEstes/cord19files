During the study period, multiplex RT-PCR testing was performed for 291 respiratory samples from 282 adult patients. During the same period, rapid influenza antigen detection tests were performed for 5,890 nasopharyngeal swab samples and bacterial cultures were performed for 38,195 respiratory samples in the study hospital. Thus, the frequency of multiplex RT-PCR testing was only 4.9% of rapid influenza antigen detection tests and 0.8% of respiratory bacterial cultures. The mean turnaround time for the 81 positive multiplex RT-PCR tests was 66.1 hours (SD, 24.2; range, 20.4 to 119.7). A turnaround time of < 48 hours was observed in 25.9% (21/81) of the 81 positive tests. The characteristics of the 291 cases are summarized in Table 1 . The mean patient age was 59.5 years and more than half were male (176, 60.5%). The most common underlying disease was diabetes mellitus (17.9%), followed by chronic lung disease (7.9%), solid tumor (7.6%), hematologic malignancy (5.2%), and chronic renal failure (3.8%). Multiplex RT-PCR testing was performed most frequently in cases of pneumonia (58.4%), followed by URI (21.3%) and NRI (20.3%). The majority of multiplex RT-PCR tests were performed for admitted patients (97.9%) with community-acquired infections (84.2%) during the flu season (82.5%). Patients who underwent multiplex RT-PCR for an NRI had the following diseases: urinary tract infections, acute gastroenteritis, acute hepatitis, febrile neutropenia, meningitis, mediastinitis, pulmonary tuberculosis, mumps, chickenpox, acute cholangitis, Escherichia coli bacteremia of unknown origin, enteric fever, Clostridium difficile infection, acute appendicitis, cellulitis, cervical lymphadenitis, hemorrhagic cystitis, cerebrovascular accidents, seizure, hyperventilation syndrome, and angina. In patients with an NRI, multiplex RT-PCR testing was performed due to the presence of a fever of unknown origin during the flu or nonflu season. The list of detected RVs is presented in Table 2 . RVs were identified in 81 of 291 samples (27.8%), with influenza as the most commonly identified (47/81, 58.0%). Influenza (27.4% vs. 14.1%, p = 0.02) and human coronavirus (6.4% vs. 1.2%, p = 0.04) were more frequently detected in patients with a URI than in those with pneumonia. The rates of RV positivity were not different between patients with community-and hospital-acquired infections (28.6% vs. 23.9%, p = 0.52). For any individual RV, there was no difference between the rates of RV positivity in community-and hospital-acquired infections. Of 59 patients with an NRI, 12 (20.3%) had positive multiplex RT-PCR results for influenza (6) , adenovirus (2), parainfluenza virus (2), human enterovirus (2), HRV (1), and RSV (1). The characteristics of the 166 patients with pneumonia (four duplicates excluded) who underwent multiplex RT-PCR testing were compared according to pathogen type (Table 3) . Approximately one quarter of these patients had an RV infection (26.5%, 44/166) and a bacterial infection (24.1%, 40/166), respectively. Nine patients (5.4%, 9/166) had bacterial/viral coinfections. The remaining 91 patients (54.8%) had no identified pathogen. In patients with an RV infection, 20 had RVs other than influenza (20/44, 45.4%). Patients with a single RV infection and those without an RV infection did not differ in terms of their baseline characteristics, underlying diseases, symptoms, and in-hospital mortality, except that rhinorrhea was more frequently observed in patients with a single RV infection during the flu season. In pa- tients coinfected with an RV and a bacterium, RSV and hematologic malignancy were more common features than in patients infected with a single RV. The in-hospital mortality rates were higher in patients with a bacterial/viral coinfection (88.9%) than in those without an RV infection (16.4%) and with a single RV infection (11.4%).
