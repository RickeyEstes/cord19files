At the PSL, laboratory analyses of flies captured monthly in traps from December 2010 through November 2011 demonstrated that these insects were positive for canine parvoviral DNA beginning in February 2011 and for each subsequent month for the remainder of the year. Increased disease incidence appeared to occur mainly in spring and early summer when these flies were most numerous and active, and again in fall when flies tended to congregate in large numbers (Fig. 1) . Although flies were positive for virus for most of the year and were more active in spring, early summer and late fall, the monthly and seasonal fly captures did not correlate with monthly and seasonal disease incidence (P = 0.232 for monthly and P = 0.988 for seasonal incidence). Ambient temperature (r = 0.696, P = 0.012), but not rainfall (r = 0.035, P = 0.913), was found to be correlated with the number of flies captured monthly. As ambient temperatures exceeded (27 • C) in mid-summer, fly captures declined dramatically and this downward trend continued into fall as temperatures steadily decreased. The soil sample collected from an area where only healthy appearing dogs were occasionally kept and flies were active, tested positive for virus. The sample taken from an area where no fly activity occurred and no dogs were kept, tested negative. The prevalence of CPV in different canine facility fly populations, by state, (Fig. 2) is expressed as the positive site rate (PSR): PSR = (PS)/ (LS) × 100 where the sum of the positive sites is (PS) and the sum of the locations sampled is (LS). The PSR for different states was found to be: SC = 17/22 (77%), GA = 3/3 (100%), AL = 1/1 (100%), CT = 1/1 (100%), NC and RI = 2/2 (100%), and FL = 1/3 (33%). Flies at two locations in NY and one location in VA and WV were found to be negative. None of the flies from any of the four non-canine, negative control locations tested positive for virus. Three additional closed-design facilities in SC, PA, and MA did not meet the study inclusion criteria as there were no flies inside the facilities and no flies were caught in traps. At the ASL, 70% (n = 26) of the 37 facilities not including the four negative field controls, were positive for CPV. Ninety-two percent of all positive sites were open-design facilities, but only 22% of nine closed-design facilities were positive (Table 1) . Statistically significant associations (Chisquare and Fisher's exact test; P-values < 0.001 and 0.002 respectively) were found between fly CPV status (positive vs. negative) and facility design (open vs. closed). The odds ratio of a positive fly CPV status for open-facility designs vs. closed-facility designs was estimated to be 21 with a 95% asymptotic confidence interval of (3.16-139.67). Thus the probability of flies testing positive in open-facility designs were estimated to be 21 times higher than at closed-facility designs. The mean number of dogs present monthly at the ASL was significantly greater (P = 0.008) at fly CPV positive sites Table   1 A cross-tabulation of descriptive statistics and confidence intervals for dog numbers, fly numbers and CPV case numbers by fly CPV status and facility design for additional surveillance locations. No sites (x = 4; 95% CI = 0.5-7.6), and the mean number of all flies was also found to be significantly greater (P = 0.043) at fly CPV positive sites (x = 214; 95% CI = 74.8-353.7) than at fly CPV negative sites (x = 80; 95% CI = 0-166.9). The mean number of CPV cases was significantly greater (P = 0.009) at open-design facilities (x = 32; 95% CI = 7.6-56.9) than at closed-design facilities (x = 20; 95% CI = 0-42.3). At the PSL, there was no significant difference between the mean counts of the three fly families (P = 0.902), even after controlling for fly CPV status (positive or negative). However, at the ASL, a significant difference did occur among the mean counts of the three fly families (P = 0.018), even after controlling for fly CPV status (positive or negative). Therefore, post hoc tests were conducted on ASL data to check for pairwise differences in the mean counts of the three fly families. No significant difference was found between the mean number of blow/bottle flies (Calliphoridae) and flesh flies (Sarcophagidae) (P = 0.428 for Bonferroni and 0.434 for Tukey tests) or between flesh flies (Sarcophagidae) and house flies (Mucidae) (P = 0. 135 for Bonferroni and 0.139 for Tukey tests). The mean number of blow/bottle flies (Calliphoridae) (x = 125.4; 95% CI = 24.8-225.9), however, was significantly greater (P = 0.005 for Bonferroni and 0.006 for Tukey tests) than that of house flies (Mucidae) (x = 31.7; 95% CI = 19.4-44). The two-way MANOVA procedure for comparing PSL and ASL revealed no significant differences between PSL and ASL in the mean numbers of the three fly families (P = 0.7 for both Wilk's lambda and Pillai's trace), even after controlling for fly CPV status (positive or negative). The mean number of CPV-positive flies was significantly greater (P < 0.001 for both Wilk's lambda and Pillai's trace) than that of CPV-negative flies regardless of the surveillance location. Thus, fly family numbers varied little across all locations, but fly numbers tended to be greater at CPV-positive facilities. The means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals for each of the three fly families, averaging values across all surveillance locations, are presented in Table 2 . The effect sizes (Eta-squared values and odds ratios) for important canine facility and vector-related risk factor associations are shown in Table 3 .
