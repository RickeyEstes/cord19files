The results of univariate analysis between the general characteristics of the participants and the overall level of MERS-related worry are shown in Table 1 . The mean MERS-related worry score, scored on a five-point scale, was 2.44 points. In the univariate analysis, sex, self-rated health status, and daily life stress level showed statistically significant results. Men showed a lower overall level of MERS-related worry than women did. The group of participants that reported 'very good' health status showed a lower overall level of MERS-related worry than the groups that responded 'bad', 'normal', and 'good'. Moreover, the group that responded 'little' to daily life stress had a lower level of MERS-related worry than group that responded 'very much'. Ordinal logistic regression analysis results also revealed statistically significant associations with overall level of MERS-related worry with respect to sex, self-rated health status, and daily life stress, just as in the univariate analysis. Men showed lower odds ratios (ORs) than women. The group that responded as having 'very good' self-rated health status showed lower ORs than all other groups, except for the group that responded 'very bad'. Moreover, the group that responded as having 'little' daily life stress showed lower ORs than the group that responded as having 'very much' daily life stress (Table 2) . These results satisfied the parallel assumptions of ordinal logistic regression. The levels of MERS-related worry by MERS outbreak periods showed scores of 2.32, 2.45, 2.73, and 2.24 when the first patient with MERS had a definitive diagnosis (index case), the first patient with MERS died (first death), the number of patients continued to rise (increasing patients), and the MERS outbreak ended (end of outbreak), respectively ( Table 3 ). The scores from the levels of MERS-related worry by MERS outbreak periods were compared via a reliability test. Fleiss Kappa and intra-class correlation test results showed that worry scores from each period were statistically significantly consistent (Table 4 ).
