Common household products were assayed against MHV, a proposed surrogate for SARS-CoV, to determine the effectiveness of viral inactivation. Cells were incubated with the neutralized test substance/virus mixture and were compared with cells grown in the presence of virus alone to assess efficacy. The presence of MHV was detected by observing viral cytopathogenic effect of the NCTC clone 1469 cell line through an inverted microscope. To determine the viral titer, cells were assessed for viral infectivity in the presence of virus alone. This control was used to verify the amount of virus present on the Petri plate before disinfectant treatment, and this end point was used for the log reduction calculations using the Reed and Muench TCID 50 end point method. 8, 9 The US Environmental Protection Agency test method only requires a product to be tested once with 1 replicate to be proven efficacious. However, to determine reproducibility, the products were tested 5 times in duplicate, with results outlined in Table 2 . A summary of the averages of the 5 tests for each product has been outlined in Table 3 . This Table demonstrates that, in fact, all of the common household disinfectants and antiseptics were effective at eliminating viral particles from a hard, nonporous surface by providing a 3-log reduction or greater of the virus from the surface. It was determined, when common household disinfectants or antiseptics, containing either 0.050% of triclosan, 0.12% of PCMX, 0.21% of sodium hypochlorite, 0.23% of pine oil, or 0.10% of a quaternary compound with 79.0% of ethanol, provided at least a 3-log reduction of the virus from the surface without any virus recovered in any of the wells within a 30-second contact time. Although some of the agents showed a lower log reduction, this was due to cellular toxicity effects of the agents themselves and not necessarily due to differences in antiviral activity. The household products containing tricolsan or the combination of ethanol and a quaternary compound demonstrated more toxicity to the cell line than the other products and therefore were placed through sephadex columns to reduce toxicity. It was interesting that the triclosan products being tested with sephadex columns resulted in the highest titers.
