aMPV Serum samples were considered to be positive for aMPV if titres â‰¥1656, as per the manufacturer's guidelines. Sixteen (21.9%) samples tested positive (Fig. 1a) . All the OP swabs were negative for aMPV by RT-PCR. A turbinate from a necropsied bird from group 3 was positive for aMPV subtype B. IBV Using the manufacturer's cut-off of 834, 69 (94.5%) birds were serologically positive for IBV (Fig. 1b) . By RT-PCR, only one (group 2) of the pooled OP swab was positive for IBV. Positive PCR reaction was also detected in the same turbinate sample from group 3, which was also positive for aMPV (above). Sequencing revealed these IBVs belong to 793B with 92-95% relatedness to the French isolate FR-94047-94 (GenBank accession number: AJ618987). NDV ELISA results demonstrated considerable variation in the antibody titres, both within and between the groups (Fig. 1c) . Three of the groups within the parent shed (groups 5, 6 and 10) had a VI below the lower limit of 20 suggested by the manufacturer for birds vaccinated with live vaccine ( Table 1) . One of the grandparent groups (group 2) was outside the upper limit of the normal range (250) with a VI of 278. However, this was below the cut-off value of 300, values above which might suggest field challenge. No NDV was identified in the OP or tissue samples by RT-PCR. ILTV Serological testing for ILTV was not performed. No ILTV detected in any of the samples when examined by PCR. Mycoplasmas No Mg or Ms serology was carried out. PCR examination of oropharyngeal swabs identified Mg in the two groups of birds in the parent shed (groups 5 and 8). Ms was identified in 11 of the 12 groups; only one group of grandparent stock (group 2) was negative. Ms was also identified in the trachea and turbinate samples of one of the sacrificed hospitalised birds from one of the grandparent sheds.
