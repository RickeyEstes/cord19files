The LAMP primers amplified only HSV-1 DNA. No LAMP products were detected with the DNAs of HSV-2, CMV, VZV, adenovirus, A. flavus and S. aureus (Fig. 1) . The LAMP reaction tubes were examined with the naked eye to detect a positive reaction upon the addition of SYBR green dye. Upon addition of SYBR green dye to the LAMP reaction tubes, the colour changed to yellowish green in a positive reaction (Fig. 2, tube 1) and remained reddish-orange (i.e. the colour of the unbound dye) in the negative reactions (Fig. 2, tube 2) . All the samples that were judged positive by visual detection of the colour change were also positive by gel electrophoresis (and vice versa). The sequences of the HSV-1 LAMP products were perfectly (99-100%) matched with the HSV-1 sequences (FJ593289, X14112, D00373, AB252711, U53683, DQ889502, U53684, AY120884) deposited in the GenBank database. The sequence similarity (100%) of the LAMP products with one of the sequences deposited in GenBank is shown in Fig. 3 . The HSV-1 LAMP was positive at all the different concentrations of DNA (10, 100, 1000, 10000 copies/lL of HSV-1 DNA) used to test sensitivity. LAMP is as sensitive as real-time PCR, with its lowest detection limit being 10 copies/lL of HSV-1 DNA. Vitreous specimens from 20 patients with clinically suspected viral retinitis were screened for HSV-1 virus by real-time PCR and LAMP. The LAMP assay detected four positive samples and 16 negative samples from patients with retinitis. The real-time PCR also detected four positive samples and 16 negative samples. A concordance of 100% was observed between the two techniques ( Table 2 ).The copy numbers of HSV-1 DNA detected by real-time PCR and the LAMP assay among the four positive samples were: sample 1 (1.2 路 10 2 /lL), sample 2 (4.0 路 10/ lL), sample 3 (2.0 路 10/lL) and sample 4 (1.5 路 10 2 /lL).
