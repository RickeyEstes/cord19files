Host proteins interacting with the 5′ and 3′ ends of TGEV genome To identify host-cell proteins potentially involved in TGEV RNA synthesis, a screening based on the binding to 5′ and 3′ TGEV RNA genome ends was used. To this end, two synthetic RNAs containing the first 504 nt of the 5′ end of the TGEV genome and the last 493 nt of the 3′ end plus a poly(A) tail were biotin labeled during the in vitro transcription and used as baits for an RNA affinity protein isolation (Fig.1) . The length of the transcripts was chosen based on the sequences required for the amplification of TGEV-derived defective RNAs (Escors et al., 2003; Izeta et al., 1999; and unpublished results) and the biotin labeling was random and spaced out in order to minimize interference of the biotin groups with potential RNA structures. The biotin labeled RNA baits were immobilized on a Streptavidin Sepharose resin and incubated with cell extracts from infected porcine ST and rodent BHK-pAPN (expressing TGEV receptor) cells that are highly susceptible to TGEV infection. In order to facilitate protein identification in the databases, extracts from the human hepatomaderived cell line Huh-7, which is susceptible to the TGEV PUR46-C11 strain infection, were also used. RNA-protein complexes were isolated by centrifugation, resolved by electrophoresis in denaturing precasted gels and identified by mass spectrometry (Fig. 2A) . From the pulled down proteins, a low proportion showed a preferential binding for one of the genome ends, that was reproduced for most of them in the three cell lines (Fig. 2B ). Three independent RNA pull down assays were performed and all the proteins showing a preferential binding for one of the TGEV genome ends were excised from the gels and identified by mass spectrometry. A set of 10 proteins was reproducibly identified in at least two out of three experiments with significant MASCOT scores (p N 0.05). The percentage of protein identifications varied depending on the species of origin and it was 100% for human, 70% for rodent and 60% for porcine proteins (Table 1) . That was probably a consequence of sequence variations with respect to the public database sequences for these species. Among the identified proteins, PTB was the only one showing a preferential binding to the 5′ end of the genome, whereas nine proteins were found to bind preferentially to the 3′ end ( Fig. 2B and Table 1 ). These proteins include several hnRNPs (A1, A0, A2B1, Q, and U) involved in RNA processing and metabolism, the translation factors EPRS, arginyl-tRNA synthetase and PABP, and the p100 transcriptional co-activator.
