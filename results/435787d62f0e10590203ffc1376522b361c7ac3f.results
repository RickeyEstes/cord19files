Baseline characteristics. A total of 97 patients were included during the study period (CMSG group, n ¼ 69; PMSG group, n ¼ 28). During the study period, 32 patients underwent open repair for TAAAs and 43 for CAAAs, and 5 underwent hybrid repair. Demographic data and preoperative risk factors are summarized in Table I . Proportions of ASA class 4 patients (23% vs 50%; P ¼ .006) and patients with a history of peripheral artery disease (7% vs 25%; P ¼ .03) were significantly higher in the PMSG group. Aneurysm characteristics are detailed in Table II . Symptomatic aneurysms (0% vs 46%; P < .0001) and TAAAs (15% vs 61%; P < .0001) were more frequent in the PMSG group. Aneurysms were significantly larger in the PMSG group (mean diameter, 59 6 8 mm in the CMSG group vs 74 6 19 mm in the PMSG group; P < .0001). Mean time to treatment from initial evaluation was 3.7 months in the CMSG group and 27 days in the PMSG group. Indications for PMSG implantation were painful aneurysms (n ¼ 12), >70-mm or rapidly enlarging aneurysms (n ¼ 10), type I endoleak after previous EVAR (n ¼ 2), saccular aneurysms (n ¼ 2), rapidly expanding aortic intramural hematoma (n ¼ 1; Fig) , and false aneurysm after previous type IV TAAA open repair (n ¼ 1; Table II ). The patients presenting with type I endoleak after EVAR had large aneurysms (respectively, 70 mm and 85 mm) and were considered to have a high risk of rupture. Another 77-year-old patient was admitted for an intramural hematoma of the thoracoabdominal aorta that was first treated medically. Persistent pain, presence of left pleural effusion, and onset of multiple ulcer-like projections on a control CT scan performed 3 days later led to emergent cervical debranching and thoracic graft stenting (Fig, A) . One week after the operation, the patient had persisting abdominal pain. Another control CT scan showed growing ulcer-like projections at the abdominal level (Fig, B and C), which led to an emergent PMSG procedure (Fig, D-F ). The patient with the visceral patch false aneurysm after open repair of a type IV TAAA performed 5 years earlier presented with a contained rupture that we considered emergent to treat. In the PMSG group, five patients presenting with large and asymptomatic TAAAs underwent a staged procedure. In four cases, an additional thoracic fenestration was created for temporary sac perfusion, which was successfully closed 2 to 4 weeks after PMSG implantation. No neurologic event was recorded during these planned reinterventions. One elderly patient with a painful TAAA involving the distal segment of the arch underwent a two-stage procedure. During the first stage, she underwent cervical debranching and stent grafting of the arch and thoracic aorta (with, respectively, Relay NBS [Vascutek/Terumo Aortic] and Cook Alpha). During the second stage 7 days later, the PMSG was deployed. Although she had thoracic pain, we thought she was too frail to cope with a long one-stage procedure. Operative details. In the CMSG group, all endografts were custom-made fenestrated Cook devices. In the PMSG group, all patients but one had a modified Cook thoracic stent graft implanted. One patient presented with a type IA endoleak after previous EVAR using an aortouni-iliac Endurant (Medtronic) device and an occluded celiac artery. Because this patient had a single iliac access available and we were concerned about successful renal cannulation through fenestrations and previously placed bare-metal stent in an angulated visceral aorta, we decided to treat him using a modified closed web Valiant device with one fenestration for the superior mesenteric artery that was cannulated from an axillary access and two chimney grafts for renal arteries. In the CMSG group, 210 target vessels were revascularized. One patient with a juxtarenal aneurysm and four renal arteries was treated using a fenestrated stent graft with two renal fenestrations and two chimney grafts for accessory renal arteries. In the PMSG group, 98 target vessels (3.5 per patient vs 3 per patient in the CMSG group) were revascularized through fenestrations (n ¼ 87) or parallel grafts (n ¼ 11). Parallel grafts were used in combination with fenestrations in six patients. Indications for this combined technique and outcomes have already been published. 15 Intraoperative results. No intraoperative death occurred in this series. Intraoperative adverse events occurred in eight (11%) CMSG patients and six (21%) PMSG patients. Details of intraoperative adverse events are given in Table III. Postoperative outcome. Overall, three (4%) patients died in the CMSG group vs four (14%) in the PMSG group during the postoperative course. Causes of in-hospital deaths and details of postoperative complications are given in Table IV. In patients treated for CAAA, three (5%) died in the CMSG group vs one (12%) in the PMSG group. In patients treated for a TAAA, there was no early death in the CMSG group vs three (17%) in the PMSG group. MAEs occurred in 18 (26%) patients in the CMSG group vs 11 (42%) in the PMSG group. Multivariable analysis (Supplementary Table, online only) showed a trend toward more MAEs in the PMSG group without reaching statistical significance (odds ratio, 3.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-15.41; P ¼ .07). Univariable and multivariable analysis showed that preoperative chronic renal impairment was significantly associated with postoperative MAEs. Early reinterventions. Early reintervention rates were 16% (n ¼ 11) in the CMSG group and 32% (n ¼ 9) in the PMSG group. Details of reinterventions are given in Table V . One postoperative aneurysm rupture occurred in a patient in the PMSG group. This ASA class 4 patient presented with a rapidly enlarging 74-mm type II TAAA and a type IA endoleak after previous EVAR with an AFX (Endologix) device. The right renal artery was occluded. He was treated using two proximal thoracic components and a PMSG with three fenestrations. The postoperative course was uneventful. Postoperative CT scan showed a mild opacification of the aneurysm sac that was considered a type II endoleak. One week after discharge, the patient presented with a ruptured infrarenal aneurysm. A CT scan revealed a type III endoleak related to disconnection between the tubular and bifurcated components of the AFX device. Emergent open repair was performed, but the patient died of multiorgan failure. Target vessel patency and endoleaks. All postoperative CT scans were available. At discharge, target vessel patency rate of CMSGs was 98% (207/210). All target vessels (n ¼ 98) were patent in the PMSG group. On postoperative CT scans, 19 (29%) patients in the CMSG group presented with endoleak vs 7 (25%) in the PMSG group. Postoperative type I and type III endoleak rates were recorded in 0% and 4% (n ¼ 3) of cases, respectively, in the CMSG group and 7% (n ¼ 2) and 11% (n ¼ 3) of cases in the PMSG group. In the CMSG group, endoleaks resulted in three reinterventions, including stenting of one additional celiac artery and two additional renal arteries. These endoleaks resolved after reintervention (Table V) . At discharge, the remaining endoleaks in the CMSG group were type II endoleaks (n ¼ 16 [24%]). In the PMSG group, five patients underwent endovascular reinterventions for treatment of type I or type III endoleaks. As mentioned before, one patient presenting with aneurysm rupture related to a type III endoleak (7) In-hospital mortality 3 (4) 4 (14) 7 (7) Cause of death underwent surgical conversion. In the PMSG group, one patient with a type IA endoleak through the gutters of chimney grafts dedicated to the superior mesenteric artery and celiac artery died during the postoperative course before any reintervention could be performed. For the three remaining patients, reinterventions are detailed in Table V . At discharge, no patient in the PMSG group had persisting type I or type III endoleak, and the remaining endoleaks were type II (n ¼ 2 [8%]).
