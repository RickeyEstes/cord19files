Viral challenge and reconstruction of ISAV-infected S. salar transcriptome. To investigate the regulation of lncRNAs during viral infection, a cohabitation challenge was used to infect S. salar with a highly virulent ISAV strain (HPR7b). According to Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival, the different survival rates between trojans and cohabitants were not significant in relation to the lifetime of the fish. Samples were taken at the beginning of the challenge (T0), before any mortalities; at 19 DPC (T1), with the first mortalities; at 23 DPC (T2); and at 30 DPC (T3), when the plateau phase began 26 . Whole-transcriptome analyses were performed on collected gills, liver, and head-kidney tissues using Illumina sequencing. Directional cDNA libraries were constructed by a MiSeq ® Illumina sequencer, which profiled polyadenylated, coding, and noncoding transcripts, but not small RNAs 26, 27 . A large number of reads (193 million) were subjected to quality control filters for the random effects of single slide variability, leaving only transcripts that were either present or marginal in all RNA-Seq experiments. For the filtered reads, de novo assembly was performed, and 193,846 contigs were generated with an N50 value equal to 1,171 and effective mapped reads rate of 84.66%. These contigs were used as reference sequences for the identification of putative lncRNAs in Salmo salar (Fig. 1) . The difficulty to characterize the lncRNA landscape in salmon, lack of a robust lncRNA database and the low genome conservation among the fish consequence of the successive genome duplications in teleost, consequently required a several stage processing of the data with specific objectives. The first was removing the protein-coding transcripts (deleting transcripts that could encode known proteins). As a result, above 70 K contigs were annotated (E-value < 10 −5 ) that were discarded from further analysis. Secondly, a highly stringent filter was applied for contig coverage. This filter allows minimizing bias of the de novo assembly and discards contigs with low-coverage (12 k contigs with high coverage < 50 reads/pb). As novel protein coding transcripts could associate with novel non-coding transcripts in the prediction process, the Coding Potential Calculator (CPC) [28] [29] [30] was used firstly to evaluate the protein coding potential of novel transcripts and remove putative protein coding transcripts. Secondly we inspected the presence of open reading frames (ORF) > 200 and the presence of putative protein conserved domains among all possible translation frames. Based upon the CPC value and the ORF prediction 6 K contigs did not show evidence of coding potential and putative conserved domains within their predicted amino acid sequences. The remaining transcripts were mapped against the latest draft of the S. salar genome to ensure their existence at genomic level. Of this set 5,635 did Scientific RepoRts | 6:22698 | DOI: 10.1038/srep22698 not show partial overlap of predicted loci and represents potential lncRNAs of S. salar (Supplementary Table S2 ). Our integrative analysis of transcriptome data by using computational and highly stringent analytical filters suggests that the transcriptional events detected were largely from ncRNAs and that some could be differentially expressed in response to viral infection.
