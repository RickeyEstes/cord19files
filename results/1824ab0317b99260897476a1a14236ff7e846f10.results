Gram-positive organisms blue/black Gram-negative organisms red (Churukian & Schenk, 1982) Sections Formalin-fixed, 4-5 Î¼m, paraffin wax embedded sections. Gram-positive organisms, fibrin, some fungi, Paneth cell granules, kerato-hyalin, and keratin blue Gram-negative organisms red Nuclei red Other tissue elements yellow Gram-positive organisms blue/black Gram-negative organisms pink/red Nuclei red Red blood cells and most cytoplasmic structures green Elastic fibers black Mycobacteria golden yellow (using blue light fluorescence below 530 nm) Background dark green Fungi, Pneumocystis, melanin black Hyphae and yeast-form cells sharply delineated in black of fungi Mucins and glycogen taupe to dark gray/ brown Background pale green Notes a. Incubation time is variable and depends on the type and duration of fixation, and organism being demonstrated. Impregnation is controlled microscopically until fungi are dark brown. Background is colorless at this point. Over-incubation produces intense staining of elastin and fungi which may obscure fine internal detail of the hyphal septa. This detail is essential for critical identification, and is best seen on under-impregnated sections. To avoid excess glycogen impregnation in liver sections, section may be digested prior to incubation. A water bath may be used effectively to insure an even incubation temperature. b. Borax ensures an alkaline pH. c. Sodium bisulfite removes excess chromic acid. d. Some workers prefer a light H&E counterstain. This is especially useful when a consulting case is sent with only one slide, providing morphological detail for the pathologist. e. Solutions a and b need to be made and stored in chemically clean glassware (20% nitric acid), as does the working solution. This includes graduates and Coplin jars. Do not use metal forceps. f. Allow all refrigerated solutions to reach room temperature before using. Fungal cell walls and glycogen magenta to red Background pale green
