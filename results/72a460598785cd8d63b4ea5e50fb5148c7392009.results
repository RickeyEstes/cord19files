The composition of fresh (COL +) and frozen (COL −) colostrum were similar with respect to IgG, total solids, total protein, albumin, total plate count (TPC), and total coliform count (TCC) ( Table 1 ). The median SCC was 1.25 × 10 6 (0.25-5.90 × 10 6 cells/mL). A significant difference between groups was observed only in cellular viability (COL+ = 24 ± 8%; COL− = 0%, p = 0.003) ( Table 1) . The results for absolute total WBC count and the percentage of granulocytes and neutrophils, and the phenotype assessments are shown in Fig. 1A -C. Calves of both groups showed maximum peak of WBC on D7 (Fig. 1A) . The absolute number of total WBC declined at subsequent observations. There was no significant difference between treatment groups during the study. However, a significant reduction was observed when comparing D0 and D28 in COL, P calves (Fig. 1A , p = 0.031). The percent of neutrophil measured using classical differential morphology and staining (Ne) tended to be different between groups on D7, with a larger fraction of Ne observed for COL + calves (Fig. 1B , p = 0.073). Overall, the % of Ne in both treatment groups declined over the course of the study, with each having a peak of about 70% around the time of birth and a decline to a more adult-like %NE of about 40% by 28 days of age. A two-way ANOVA analysis demonstrated a significant difference in the relative number of Ne (%) when D0 was compared to D14, D21 or D28 (Fig. 1B , p ≤ 0.008), D2 to D21 (Fig. 1B , p = 0.013), D7 to D1 or D28 (Fig. 1B , p ≤ 0.036) for COL + calves, and when D0 was compared to D21 or D28 (Fig. 1B , p ≤ 0.032) for COL − calves using the Bonferroni post test to confirm the differential time points. The fraction (%) of CH138 + CD62L + appeared to increase slightly in COL − calves from over the course of the study, with the exception of the D21 measurement. The drop observed at D21 was not statistically significant relative to any of the other measurement of COL − calves. COL+ calves showed no change in CH138CD62L+ expression during the study (Fig. 1C) . The results of the phagocytosis assays are shown in Fig. 2 . The percent phagocytosis (%) of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were not different between COL + and COL − calves at any time during the study. ( Fig. 2A-B ). There appeared to be an overall increase in the % of phagocytic granulocytes during the course of the study period in both treatment groups. A two-way ANOVA analysis demonstrated a significant difference in the percent of cells taking up Staphylococcus aureus in the COL + calves when D0 was compared with D2 or D28 ( Fig. 2A , p ≤ 0.012) and in COL − calves when D0 was compared with D2, D7 or D21 ( Fig. 2A , p ≤ 0.020) by application of the Bonferroni post test. A time dependent tendency was also observed in COL − calves when D2 was compared with D21 ( Fig.  2A , p = 0.095) in COL − group. A tendency toward significance was detected for the percent of cells taking up Escherichia coli in the COL + group when D0 was compared with D2 (Fig. 2B , p = 0.054), and in COL − when D0 was compared with D2 and D7 (Fig. 2B , p ≤ 0.055). A significant difference also was observed in COL − when D2 as compared with D21 (Fig. 2B, p = 0.045) . The average phagocytic avidity (expressed as mean fluorescence intensity, MFI) for Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli phagocytosis were not significantly different between treatment groups. The only statistical significant differences observed were for COL − calves on D7 for Escherichia coli phagocytosis relative to COL + calves (Fig. 2D, p = 0.034) . Overall, MFI of phagocytosis increased for both treatment groups over the course of the study. A two-way ANOVA analysis demonstrated significant differences in Staphylococcus aureus phagocytosis MFI in the COL + calves when D0 was compared with D2, D7 or D28 (Fig. 2C , p ≤ 0.010) and when D2 was compared with D21 (Fig. 2C , p = 0.041) using the Bonferroni post-test assessments. Similarly, COL − calves showed a significant difference in phagocytic MFI by two-way ANOVA assessment when D0 was compared with D2, D7, D14, D21 or D28 (Fig. 2C , p ≤ 0.05). A time dependent tendency was also observed in both groups for Escherichia coli phagocytosis MFI, observing higher values on D0 than D2, D7, D21 and D28 (Fig. 2D, p ≤ 0.024) . The phagocytic MFI value observed on D21 also was higher than D28 in COL − group (p = 0.004). The percent of cells with endogenous ROS activity is shown in Fig.  3A . The profile of ROS production by cells from COL+ and COL− calves showed the same pattern and almost universal detection of endogenous ROS production by all cells. A tendency for a difference between treatments on D14 was observed, but appears to be a weak finding (Fig.  3A , p = 0.061). COL+ and COL− calves showed a common level of endogenous cellular ROS production (MFI) over the course of the study. On D21, a tendency toward an enhanced level of cellular endogenous ROS production was observed in COL+ calves, but this was a single observation (Fig. 3B , p = 0.094). COL+ and COL− calves demonstrated a similar pattern in the percent of cells producing ROS after Staphylococcus aureus stimulation over the whole course of the study. An isolated significant difference indicated that the COL+ calves had higher percentage of ROS producing cells than the COL − calves on D7 (Fig. 3C, p = 0 .008). The cellular intensity of ROS production (MFI) after Staphylococcus aureus stimulation progressively increased in calves under both treatments from birth (at about 500 MFI units) to D28 (about 950 MFI units). There were no significant differences observed between groups. The percent of cells producing ROS after Escherichia coli stimulation was relatively consistent during the study. It was observed that the COL + calves had a higher percent of ROS producing cells after Escherichia coli stimulation on D28 than COL − calves (Fig. 3E , p = 0.040). The cellular intensity of ROS production (MFI) after Escherichia coli stimulation did not change significantly in either treatment group over the course of the study. While a slightly higher mean MFI for ROS production was recorded on D21 in the COL+ calves than COL− calves, it was not significant (and is probably not relevant).
