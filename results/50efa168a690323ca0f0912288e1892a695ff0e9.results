For the period of July-August 2019, there were 73 airline websites within the six global airline conglomerates included in this study. Phase 1 of the analysis revealed that all 14 keywords related to infection control and prevention of infectious diseases were present within all 73 airline websites. The word health was the most frequently found keyword, appearing in almost all (n = 68; 93.2%) websites. Cough etiquette was the least most frequently located keyword (n = 9; 12.3%). The keywords infection prevention, infection control, communicable diseases(s) and infectious disease(s) were on average present in just over one-third (38.3%) of the websites. The frequencies for the presence and absences of all 14 keywords for all 73 websites is illustrated in Fig. 2 . For Phase 2, the frequency of the keyword search outputs across all 73 websites was recorded. Across all 73 websites, the word health was present 20,385 times, followed by hand washing (n = 1954), hand hygiene (n = 1889) and infection control (n = 1583). The keywords disinfect/disinfection (n = 15) and cough etiquette (n = 35) were least present within the 73 websites. The keywords infection prevention, infection control, communicable disease(s) and infectious disease(s) were very seldomly present across the websites. The results from Phase 2 have been graphically presented in Fig. 3 . From the results of Phase 2, a manual review of each of the keyword search outcome was performed to identify the number of websites (out of the 73 in total) that had information that was useful with respect to infection control and prevention of infectious diseases. Nearly half (n = 35; 47.9%) of all airline websites featured some information or advice that was useful for infection control and prevention of infectious diseases for 13 of the 14 keywords. Overall, health was the keyword that resulted in the largest number of instances of information (n = 26; Table 2 . Additionally, we assessed the extent to which the website content yielded from the keyword searches was useful in terms of infection control and prevention of infectious diseases. The search using the keyword infectious disease(s) yielded 244 results across all 73 websites, and of these only 22 (9%) provided information that was deemed useful for infection control and preventing the spread of an infectious disease. By comparison, the keywords handwashing and hand hygiene yielded the lowest number (n = 2; 0.1% and n = 3; 0.2%, respectively) of instances of useful information for infection control and preventing the spread infectious disease. The proportions of the content that were deemed useful for infection control and preventing the spread infectious disease for all 14 keywords are listed in Table 3 . There were some websites where the information provided based on the keyword search was considered useful regarding terms of infection control and prevention of infectious diseases. Of the 73 websites, ten (13.7%) contained information for passengers suggesting they review their vaccination status prior to travel, as part of the destination countries' migration policies. There were eight airline websites (11%) that contained information for passengers recommending immunisation for vaccine-preventable diseases, particularly Cholera and Yellow Fever. One Asian airline, namely Air China, directed individuals to seek information on vaccines against influenza, malaria, hepatitis B virus and epidemic encephalitis B. Two airline websites, South African Airways and HK Express, provided information about Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) for passengers who may have visited endemic areas, and included website links to official government advisory websites. Five airline websites (two from Japan, one from Great Britain, one from Middle East and one from South Africa) featured a list of common and highly contagious infections (including Influenza, Measles, Chicken Pox and Tuberculosis) and their respective transmission periods. The website for Thai Airways provided comprehensive advice on handwashing, advocating it as an effective way for passengers to prevent infectious diseases. The website for Jeju Air, a Korean airline, was the only one to feature information about Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). This was presented in the form of a safety guide that featured advice on hand washing, mask use, cough etiquette, and contact details for a 24-h MERS-CoV hotline. The websites of Air Canada, Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways (ANA), Saudia and South African Airways featured website URL links to their respective countries' department of health website and advised passengers to visit these websites for further official information about infectious diseases. The website for Turkish Airlines contained multiple forms of information and advice that encompassed the importance of infection control and the prevention of infectious diseases, particularly during the in-flight period. These included explicit statements on hygiene procedures for hands and in-cabin surfaces, which were supported by URLs to scientific publications. The website also recommended the use personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks to prevent the spread of potential infectious agents while onboard.
