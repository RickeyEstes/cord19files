A total of 29 of the 109 samples examined were negative by the virus neutralisation test and were examined subsequently by Western blotting. Ten of these sera were found concomitantly to be free of CCoV specific antibodies and used to adjust the Elisa cut-off value (three Standard Deviations higher than the arithmetic mean of the absorbance of concordantly negative samples). Samples with value exceeding than 0.040 were considered to be positive. As shown in Fig. 1A , 80 of the 109 serum samples proved to be positive at the virus neutralisation test. Nineteen samples, which were found to be free of CCoV neutralising antibodies, gave a positive signal by the Elisa. In 17 of these, CCoV specific antibodies were also found by the Western blotting test. These sera, therefore, were recorded as positive concomitantly by Elisa (Fig. 1B) . Two discrepant sera remained which gave a positive result exclusively by Elisa. With the Western blotting test, most serum samples showed reactivity to the N and M proteins of CCoV and only a few samples also reacted against the S protein (data not shown). Considering virus neutralisation as a 'gold standard' test, Elisa had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 34.5%, with an overall agreement of 82.6%. However, when the virus neutralisation test combined with the confirmatory Western blotting test, were used as the 'gold standard', the Elisa showed an improved specificity (83.3%), while the sensitivity remained unchanged (100%), with an overall agreement of 98.2%.
