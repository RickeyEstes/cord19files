Identification of screening hits that are bactericidal against S. aureus smallcolony variants. The AK-based HTS assay was used to screen a Selleck library consisting of 853 FDA-approved drug candidates that showed bactericidal activity at 100 M after 24 h of treatment against a stable SCV S. aureus strain, UAMS-1112 (ΔhemB) (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Screening identified 22 drugs that displayed an increase in AK signal that surpassed two standard deviations above the overall mean AK level for the entire library (Table 1) . Among these, two antibiotics, rifapentine (an antitubercular agent) and sitafloxacin (a fluoroquinolone) were identified. The remaining 20 varied in therapeutic area classifications ranging from antifungal (ketoconazole), anticancer (10-DAB, apatinib, daunorubicin), antiviral (ammonium glycyrrhizinate, cidofovir), cardiac related (clonidine hydrochloride, furosemide, milrinone), ␤-lactamase inhibitor (sulbactam), proton pump inhibition (esomeprazole), antioxidant/anthelmintic (genistein), anesthetic (mepivacaine), muscle relaxant (methocarbamol), antihistamine (mizolastine), antiangiogenic/immunomodulator (pomalidomide), water-soluble vitamin (pantothenic acid), sulfonamide (sulfamethazine), to antipsychotic/antidepressant (amitriptyline, olanzapine). To confirm whether the increased AK signal did indeed correspond to bactericidal activity of the drugs, each of the 22 screening hits was retested for antimicrobial activity using quantitative microbiology by plating UAMS-1112 (ΔhemB) and treating with each candidate drug at 100 M. For each drug, the resulting number of viable CFU were compared to mock-treated cells (dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] ). Four of the 22 drugs tested, daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, and sitafloxacin, displayed potent antimicrobial activity resulting in Ն5-log reduction in viable SCV compared to mocktreated cells. Of these, daunorubicin, an anthracycline chemotherapy agent; rifapentine, a rifamycin class antibiotic; and sitafloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, yielded no detectable viable bacteria while ketoconazole, an imidazole antifungal, displayed a 5.52-log reduction relative to the mock-treated control (Fig. 1) . The remaining 18 hits displayed Յ1.5-log reduction and, thus, were considered less potent and classified as low-priority agents that were not investigated further. MICs of validated screening hits against S. aureus SCV and NCP strains. As an initial means to evaluate the spectrum of antimicrobial activity of the four high-priority hits, conventional MIC assays were performed on genetically diverse strains of S. aureus including the methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strain UAMS-1, methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA) strain USA300, and UAMS-1112 (SCV; ΔhemB) for daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, and sitafloxacin at concentrations ranging from 0 to 128 g/ml. MIC results were compared to that of a conventional aminoglycoside, gentamicin (Table 2) , which is commonly used in local delivery for orthopedic infections via poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone cement spacers (37, 38) . The observed 8-fold increase in MIC of gentamicin against SCV in comparison to the NCP UAMS-1 was consistent with previously reported values and reaffirmed that SCV are refractory to the antibiotic (39, 40) . Rifapentine and sitafloxacin had MICs against SCV and the other strains tested that were lower than gentamicin, daunorubicin, and ketoconazole ( Table 2 ), suggesting they may represent potent options for treating S. aureus SCVassociated infections. Antimicrobial efficacy of validated screening hits against established S. aureus biofilm. S. aureus chronic infections are also associated with biofilm formation, which is comprised of a heterogenous population of cells, both NCP and SCV (41, 42) . To further assess the antimicrobial efficacy of the identified candidates, S. aureus biofilms were grown for 24 h and then challenged with daunorubicin, ketoconazole, sitafloxacin, rifapentine, and gentamicin to assess biofilm vulnerability to these compounds. Briefly, UAMS-1 biofilms were grown on polystyrene pegs using the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) assay (Innovotech, Edmonton, Canada). Growth medium was supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) human plasma (43) , which enabled robust biofilm to be formed after 24 h ( Fig. 2A to C). Established biofilms were then challenged with daunorubicin, ketoconazole, sitafloxacin, rifapentine, or gentamicin for 24 h at concentrations ranging from 1 to 128 g/ml. Pegs were then sonicated in recovery plates, serially diluted, and then plated, and resulting CFU were enumerated. Sitafloxa- cin demonstrated a Ն4-log reduction in recovered biofilm-associated CFU in comparison to the mock-treated growth control (DMSO) at concentrations Ն4 g/ml (Fig. 2D) . Additionally, compared to gentamicin treatment (control), sitafloxacin displayed significant reduction of viable bacteria within biofilms at these concentrations. Gentamicin and rifapentine induced no more than a 2-fold reduction in recovered biofilmassociated CFU at all concentrations tested. Daunorubicin resulted in ϳ4-log reduction in recovered biofilm-associated CFU only at concentrations Ͼ64 g/ml. Ketoconazole failed to demonstrate any significant bactericidal activity against S. aureus biofilm over the entire range of concentrations tested. Mammalian cytotoxicity of validated screening hits. To assess the detrimental effects of the drug candidates on mammalian cells and to establish a therapeutic window by comparing toxic concentrations with identified MICs, the cytotoxicity of daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, sitafloxacin, and gentamicin was measured using an XTT proliferation assay, which involved treating human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells with the candidate drugs at concentrations ranging from 0 to 128 g/ml for 24 h. Results showed that gentamicin did not induce significant cytotoxic effects over the range of concentrations tested, with Ͼ85% cell viability (Fig. 3A ). Sitafloxacin and rifapentine displayed the least cytotoxic effects of the candidates tested, with no significant dose-dependent cytotoxicity effects observed at concentrations ranging from 1 to 64 g/ml and 1 to 16 g/ml, respectively ( Fig. 3D and E) , whereas daunorubicin and ketoconazole demonstrated significant cytotoxic effects in comparison to mock-treated cells at all concentrations ranging from 1 to 128 g/ml and 16 to 128 g/ml, respectively ( Fig. 3B and C) . The therapeutic ratio, defined as the ratio of the lowest concentration causing cytotoxicity to the MIC of each tested S. aureus strain, was calculated for daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, and sitafloxacin (Table 3) . Consistent with the above observations, daunorubicin and ketoconazole had the lowest therapeutic ratios (Ͻ0.25 and Ͻ1, respectively), whereas rifapentine and sitafloxacin had the highest therapeutic ratios (Ͼ1,000). Antimicrobial activity in human serum and spontaneous resistance frequency. The antimicrobial activity against UAMS-1 in human serum was also evaluated to investigate the bioactivity of each drug in the presence of serum proteins. The MIC was generally increased, reflecting Ͼ4-, 62.5-, 15.63-, and 4-fold decreases in bactericidal activity for ketoconazole, rifapentine, sitafloxacin, and gentamicin in the presence of human serum, respectively (Table 1) . However, no change was observed for daunorubicin in the presence of human serum, indicating that serum proteins do not affect its bactericidal activity. Although sitafloxacin demonstrated serum inactivation liabilities (ϳ16-fold increase in MIC), the MIC in serum was 0.25 g/ml, still below that of the clinical control gentamicin's MIC of 0.5 g/ml in regular Mueller-Hinton medium, and well within the therapeutic window demonstrating its bactericidal potency and safety in either setting. The spontaneous resistance frequencies were also measured at 2ϫ and 4ϫ MIC for daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, and sitafloxacin, as well as rifampin, to investigate the development of resistant mutants when UAMS-1 was subjected to each drug. Rifampin was used as a control because it is a known antibiotic that readily induces S. aureus resistant mutants (44) . Ketoconazole had the highest frequency of resistance on the order of 10 Ϫ5 at either 2ϫ or 4ϫ MIC (Table 4 ). Rifapentine and rifampin all had similar spontaneous resistance frequencies on the order of 10 Ϫ7 at 2ϫ or 4ϫ MIC. However, while sitafloxacin had similar equivalent resistance frequencies to rifapentine and rifampin at 4ϫ MIC, it demonstrated an order of magnitude higher resistance frequency at 2ϫ MIC. Daunorubicin yielded no detectable levels of resistant mutants at 2ϫ or 4ϫ MIC. These data suggest that rifapentine and sitafloxacin are equivalent to rifampin in their induction of resistant mutants, while ketoconazole was the most likely to produce resistant mutants. Monotherapy of these drugs will result in the incidence of resistant mutants; however, the addition of a supplemental drug, such as vancomycin, as combination therapy can reduce resistance.
