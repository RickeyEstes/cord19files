LRs on splenic MZ DC-SIGN + macrophages may be important for DC-SIGN-mediated uptake and decomposition of S. pneumoniae DC-SIGN transfectants were immunostained for DC-SIGN and the raft protein GM-1 ganglioside with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit. Large aggregates of DC-SIGN were strongly distributed in CTB-enriched vertex regions of the cells (Fig. 1a) . Moreover, DC-SIGN monomers and dimers were obviously enriched in LR fractions (fractions 4-6) compared with non-LR fractions (Fig. 1a) . Isolation of detergent-resistant raft fractions was confirmed with immunoblotting for flotillin-1 and caveolin-1 as representative markers of planar LRs and caveolae, respectively 40 . The same experiment was performed with SIGN-R1 depletion and DC-SIGN transgenic mice (DC-SIGN BMT / SIGN-R1 TKO ; Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. S1a , b) or human cadavers ( Supplementary Fig. S1c ). DC-SIGN was obviously expressed in LRs of splenic MZ DC-SIGN + cells (Fig. 1c , d and Supplementary Fig. S1d) . Disruption of LRs with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), a cholesterol-extracting agent, did not reduce DC-SIGN expression on the cellular surface, but altered its surface distribution pattern (Fig. 1e) . Moreover, when DC-SIGN transfectants were incubated with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled S. pneumoniae, pneumococcal uptake and decomposition were obvious in the cytoplasm, showing disintegrated particles of the pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide of S. pneumoniae serotype 14 (CPS14) around the phagocytosed bacterium ( Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. S1e ). Similar results were observed after pretreatment with actinomycin-D or cycloheximide, which did not affect the plasma membrane structure (Fig. 1f) . However, pneumococcal uptake and decomposition were dramatically reduced with disruption of LRs using MβCD ( Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. S1f ) or with inhibition of LR-dependent endocytosis using dynamin inhibitory peptide (DIP) or transfection with dominant-negative dynamin (K44A; Fig. 1g and h, respectively), only permitting microbial binding to the cellular surface of DC-SIGN transfectants. The bacterial decomposition ratios were quantitatively calculated ( Fig. 1f-h) . LRs on splenic MZ SIGN-R1 + macrophages may be important for SIGN-R1-mediated uptake and decomposition of S. pneumoniae Large aggregates of SIGN-R1 were observed in CTBenriched vertex regions of SIGN-R1 transfectants and strong distribution of SIGN-R1 monomers and dimers were obvious in LR fractions (Fig. 2a) . In particular, multimers of SIGN-R1 were preformed in LRs (inset in Fig. 2a) . In whole fractions of spleens or lymph nodes from wild-type (WT) mice, SIGN-R1 was evident only in LRs of both tissues of WT mice with a higher concentration of SIGN-R1 multimers in LRs than in non-LRs (Fig. 2b ), but not from SIGN-R1-knockout (KO) mice ( Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. S2a ). Fig. 1 Distribution of DC-SIGN in splenic lipid rafts and its role in the uptake and decomposition of S. pneumoniae. a (Left) DCEK_DC-SIGN transfectants were immunostained for DC-SIGN (red), cholera toxin B (green), and DAPI (blue). Arrowheads (yellow) indicate the colocalization of DC-SIGN and cholera toxin B. (Right) After sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of whole-cell lysates from DCEK_DC-SIGN transfectants, fractions were immunoblotted for DC-SIGN, flotilin-1, and caveolin-1. b DC-SIGN BMT /WT mice were intravenously injected with hamster IgG or 22D1 anti-SIGN-R1 monoclonal antibodies (100 μg, 24 h), and splenic cryosections were immunostained for SIGN-R1 (green), DC-SIGN (red), and SER4/CD169 (blue). c As in (a) (right), but spleens from DC-SIGN BMT /SIGN-R1 TKO mice were used, and immunoblotting for SIGN-R1 was performed. d As in a (right), but cadaver spleens were used, and representative results (#11-148) are presented. e (Left) DCEK_DC-SIGN transfectants were treated with MβCD (10 mM, 3 h), immunostained for DC-SIGN without permeabilization, and assessed by FACS. (Right) As in (left), but cells were immunostained for cholera toxin B (green) and DC-SIGN (red), followed by microscopic analysis. f-h (Left) DCEK_DC-SIGN transfectants were pretreated with f MβCD, actinomycin-D (AD; 5 μg/mL, 24 h), or cycloheximide (CH; 20 μg/mL, 24 h) or with g the myristoylated dynamin inhibitory peptide (50 μM, 1 h) 70 and washed out, or h transfected with empty vector or dominant-negative dynamin (K44A). Samples were then incubated with mitomycin C-treated S. pneumoniae type 14 (MitC-Pn14; 1 × 10 6 , 15 h, 37°C), followed by immunostaining for f, g DC-SIGN (green) and CPS14 (red) or h dynamin (green) and CPS14 (red). (Right) The average percentage of pneumococcal decomposition of total pneumococcal binding on DC-SIGN transfectants was calculated in five areas from each sample in five independent experiments. Data are shown as mean ± SD. n.s., Not significant; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. Scale bars a, f, g, h, 20 µm; b, 200 µm; e, 10 µm Disruption of LRs with MβCD did not reduce SIGN-R1 expression on the transfectant cellular surface, but altered its surface distribution pattern (Fig. 2d) . However, MβCD treatment of SIGN-R1 transfectants reduced the uptake of dextran or CPS14, representative ligands of SIGN-R1 41,42 (Fig. 2e) . Similarly, when SIGN-R1 transfectants were incubated with S. pneumonia type 14, which has strong binding affinity for SIGN-R1 41 , the uptake and decomposition of the organism were evident under control conditions ( Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. S2b ) and in the presence of actinomycin-D or cycloheximide (Fig. 2f) . However, MβCD treatment of SIGN-R1 transfectants inhibited the uptake and decomposition of S. pneumoniae, only permitting microbial binding to the cellular surface As in a (right), but spleens from wild-type and SIGN-R1-KO mice were used and immunoblotted for SIGN-R1, flotilin-1, and caveolin-1. d (Left) DCEK_SIGN-R1 transfectants were treated with MβCD (10 mM, 3 h), immunostained for SIGN-R1 without permeabilization, and assessed by FACS. (Right) As in (left), but cells were immunostained for cholera toxin B (green) and SIGN-R1 (red) and followed by microscopic analysis. e Cells in d were further incubated with FITC-dextran (5 μg, 30 min) or CPS14 (10 μg, 2 h), and their uptake was assessed by FACS (green or pink lines for uptake without or with MβCD, respectively). f-h (Left) DCEK_SIGN-R1 transfectants were pretreated with f MβCD, actinomycin-D (AD; 5 μg/mL, 24 h), cycloheximide (CD; 20 μg/mL, 24 h) or with g myristoylated dynamin inhibitory peptide (50 μM, 1 h) 71 and washed out, or h transfected with dominant-negative dynamin (K44A) and incubated with mitomycin C-treated S. pneumoniae type 14 (MitC-Pn14; 1 × 10 6 , 15 h, 37°C), followed by immunostaining for f, g SIGN-R1 (green) and CPS14 (red) or (H) dynamin (green) and CPS14 (red). (Right) The average percentage of pneumococcal decomposition of total pneumococcal binding on SIGN-R1 transfectants was calculated in five areas from each sample in five independent experiments. Data are shown as mean ± SD. n.s., Not significant; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001., Scale bars a, f, g, h, 20 µm; d, 10 µm (Fig. 2f) . Moreover, inhibition of LR-dependent endocytosis using DIP or K44A dramatically reduced the uptake and decomposition of the organism (Fig. 2g, h) . The bacterial decomposition ratios were quantitatively calculated ( Fig. 2f-h) . LRs of splenic MZ SIGN-R1 + macrophages may provide an optimal location for innate recruitment of SIGN-R1 against S. pneumoniae in vivo SIGN-R1 transfectants were incubated with S. pneumoniae at 37°C or 4°C or in the presence of MβCD, and abundant SIGN-R1 aggregation was observed on the cell surface only at 37°C (Fig. 3a, b) . When these cells were then fractionated and their LR fractions were immunoblotted for SIGN-R1, SIGN-R1 monomers and multimers were obviously increased in LRs (Fig. 3c) . Because SIGN-R1 + macrophages rapidly recognized S. pneumoniae in splenic MZs within 1 h (Fig. 3d) , SIGN-R1 distribution in splenic LRs was examined 1 h after intravenous injection of S. pneumoniae. SIGN-R1 complex was obviously increased only in splenic LRs following S. pneumoniae stimulation (Fig. 3e) , as confirmed in separate experiments ( Supplementary Fig. S3a , cases 1-4). Similar experiments using intravenous injection of an unencapsulated mutant of S. pneumoniae serotype 14 (mt-Pn14) or Staphylococcus aureus, another grampositive coccal bacterium that does not bind SIGN-R1 41, 43 showed no increase in SIGN-R1 complex in splenic LRs (Fig. 3f, g) , confirming the CPS14 dependent recruitment of SIGN-R1 complex against S. pneumoniae. Next, we examined whether MARCO, a scavenger receptor expressed on partial SIGN-R1 + MZ macrophages 44 , or SER4/CD169, a cell adhesion molecule expressed on MZ metallophils, were recruited in splenic LRs following S. pneumoniae exposure. Neither target was recruited in splenic LRs following exposure to S. pneumoniae (Fig. 3h ). C1q and C4 are distributed in LRs of splenic MZ SIGN-R1 + macrophages and increased following S. pneumoniae exposure in a SIGN-R1-dependent manner in vivo The expression levels of C1q and C4 in whole-cell lysates from the spleens, livers, and lungs of control mice were similar in all tissues ( Supplementary Fig. S4b ). However, higher levels of C1q and C4 were found in splenic LRs than in hepatic or pulmonary LRs or in non-LRs from all tissues (Fig. 4a ). Other traditional mediators in different complement pathways (IgM, MBL-C, and factor B) were barely present in LRs from all tissues (Fig. 4b ), but were variable in non-LRs ( Supplementary  Fig. S4c ). Following intravenous injection of phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) or S. pneumoniae, simultaneous increases in C1q and C4 were obvious only in splenic LRs, whereas no changes were found in hepatic or pulmonary LRs or in non-LRs (Fig. 4c) . Additionally, no differences in IgM, MBL-C, or factor B levels were found in any fraction ( Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. S4d ). In SIGN-R1-KO mice, the levels of C1q and C4 in whole-cell lysates of all tissues were the same as those in control mice ( Supplementary Fig. S4e, b) . However, both complements were not increased at all following S. pneumoniae exposure (Fig. 4e) . Moreover, increases in C1q and C4 were completely abolished in splenic LRs from SIGN-R1 TKO mice exposed to S. pneumoniae ( Supplementary Fig. S4f ). To determine whether the specific recognition of CPS14 by SIGN-R1 was required for upregulation of C1q and C4 in splenic LRs, splenic fractions were immunoblotted for C1q and C4. Both complements were not upregulated at all in any splenic fraction following exposure to mt-Pn14 or S. aureus ( Fig. 4f , g). LRs from splenic MZ SIGN-R1 + macrophages may provide an optimal location for dominant C3 activation in response to S. pneumoniae in a SIGN-R1-dependent manner in vivo We examined C3 levels in whole-cell lysates from the spleen, liver, and lung of WT mice, and the lowest expression was observed in the spleen ( Supplementary  Fig. S5a ). However, immunoblotting of their fractions for C3 showed that constitutive distribution of C3 was the highest in splenic LRs among LRs of all tissues (Fig. 5a) . Furthermore, following intravenous injection of PBS or S. pneumoniae, the initial activation of C3 was most dominant in splenic LRs exposed to S. pneumoniae with a dramatic decrease in αC3, but a relatively minor decrease was observed in splenic non-LRs (Fig. 5b) . These results in spleen fractions were confirmed in separate experiments (Supplementary S5b, c). In sera or splenic fractions from SIGN-R1-KO or SIGN-R1 TKO mice, SIGN-R1 deficiency did not affect C3 levels in sera (Supplementary S5g) or distribution in splenic LRs without pneumococcal challenge (Fig. 5c , top, Supplementary Fig. S5f , g, top), but abolished C3 activation with pneumococcal challenge (Fig. 5c , bottom and Supplementary Fig. S5g, bottom) . Moreover, CPS14 was essential for SIGN-R1-mediated C3 activation in splenic LRs because C3 activation was significantly decreased or abolished in all splenic fractions from WT mice following mt-Pn14 or S. aureus challenge, yielding abundant intact C3α and weak or no increases in 43 kDa iC3b (Fig. 5d, e) . In C3-depleted mice, C3 deficiency in splenic LRs had no effect on the constitutive distribution of SIGN-R1, C1q, or C4 in splenic LRs or their increases against S. pneumoniae (Fig. 5f ). When WT cells or SIGN-R1 transfectants were incubated with mouse serum, fixation of C4 and C3 was observed only on SIGN-R1 transfectants and was significantly enhanced in SIGN-R1 transfectants in the Accumulation and multimerization of SIGN-R1 in splenic lipid rafts following exposure to CPS14 from S. pneumoniae in vivo. a DCEK_SIGN-R1 transfectants were incubated with mitomycin C-treated S. pneumoniae type 14 (MitC-Pn14; 1 × 10 6 , 10 min) at 37°C or 4°C and immunostained for SIGN-R1 without permeabilization. b As in a, but cells were pretreated with MβCD (10 mM, 3 h) and incubated only at 37°C. c As in a, but cell lysates at 37°C were fractionated with sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, and fractions of LRs were immunoblotted for SIGN-R1, flotilin-1, or caveolin-1. Multimers of SIGN-R1 are shown in the boxes. d In total, 1 × 10 8 CFSE-labeled MitC-Pn14 (green) were injected intravenously into wild-type mice for 0, 15, or 60 min, and splenic sections were immunostained for SIGN-R1 (blue). The binding or uptake of organisms into splenic MZs is shown in the boxes. (E) As in (C), but spleens were used before or after intravenous injection of live S. pneumoniae (Pn14; 1 × 10 8 , 1 hr) into wild-type mice. (F and G) As in e, but mice were injected intravenously with PBS or 1 × 10 8 cells of an unencapsulated mutant of serotype 14 S. pneumoniae (mt-Pn14) or Staphylococcus aureus for 1 h, respectively. h As in e, but fractions were immunoblotted for MARCO, SER4/CD169, flotilin-1, and caveolin-1. Scale bars a, b, 20 µm; d, 250 µm presence of S. pneumoniae (Fig. 5g) . Furthermore, fluorescent microscopy revealed the colocalization of C4 and C3 only in SIGN-R1 transfectants ( Fig. 5h and Supplementary Fig. S5h ), indicating that C3 activation was specifically generated at the same location on SIGN-R1 + cells in which the SIGN-R1-mediated classical complement pathway was initiated. Enrichment of SIGN-R1 and C1q enhances the opsonization, uptake, and decomposition of S. pneumoniae Addition of SIGN-R1 significantly enhanced the fixation of C1q on the pneumococcal surface (Fig. 6a) . Sequentially, the increased concentration of C1q also accelerated the opsonization of iC3b in response to Fig. 4 Predominant distribution of complement C1q and C4 in splenic lipid rafts and their upregulation after S. pneumoniae challenge in a SIGN-R1-dependent manner in vivo. a Spleens, livers, and lungs of control mice were fractionated with sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, and fractions were immunoblotted for C1q, C4, flotilin-1, and caveolin-1. b As in a, but fractions were immunoblotted for IgM, MBL-C, or factor B. c As in a, but wild-type mice were injected intravenously with live S. pneumoniae (Pn14; 1 × 10 8 , 1 h). d As in c, but fractions were immunoblotted for IgM, MBL-C, or factor B. e As in a, c, but SIGN-R1-KO mice were used, and splenic fractions were analyzed. f, g As in c, but mice were injected intravenously with an unencapsulated mutant of serotype 14 S. pneumoniae (mt-Pn14) or Staphylococcus aureus (1 × 10 8 , 1 h). All data are representative of five independent experiments Fig. 5 Dominant C3 activation in splenic lipid rafts in a SIGN-R1-dependent manner following S. pneumoniae challenge in vivo. a Spleens, livers, and lungs of control mice were fractionated with sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, and fractions were immunoblotted for C3. b As in a, but wild-type mice were injected intravenously with PBS or live S. pneumoniae (Pn14; 1 × 10 8 , 1 h). c As in a, b, but SIGN-R1-KO mice were used, and splenic fractions were analyzed. d, e As in c, but mice were injected intravenously with an unencapsulated mutant of serotype 14 S. pneumoniae (mt-Pn14) or Staphylococcus aureus (1 × 10 8 , 1 h). f As in c, but CVF-treated mice were used, and splenic fractions were immunoblotted for C3, SIGN-R1, C1q, and C4. g DCEK_WT and DCEK_SIGN-R1 were incubated with mitomycin C-treated S. pneumoniae type 14 (MitC-Pn14; 1 × 10 7 , 1 h) without or with 5% NMS in TC buffer for 15 min at 37°C. Cells were immunostained for C4 or C3 with their respective isotype control IgGs and assessed by FACS. h As in g, but the binding of C4 (red) or C3 (green) was assessed by fluorescence microscopy after fixing DCEK-SIGN-R1 transfectants with 1% paraformaldehyde. Arrowheads indicate colocalization of C4 and C3. Representative cells are shown in the box. All data are representative of five independent experiments. Scale bars h, 10 µm S. pneumoniae and led to the formation of a membrane attack complex on S. pneumoniae (Fig. 6b) . Because the same amount of βC3 was used for fixation, the same amount of C3 was fixed on S. pneumoniae under all conditions. However, C3 activation was dominant only with the addition of SIGN-R1, demonstrating the degradation of αC3 and increased fixation of small iC3b (43 kDa; Fig. 6c) . With the addition of C1q or normal human serum (NHS) as a source of C1q, pneumococcal binding was increased only on SIGN-R1 transfectants (Fig. 6d) . Moreover, pneumococcal uptake and sequential decomposition were observed on SIGN-R1 transfectants only with normal mouse serum (NMS), but not without serum or with C3-or C1q-depleted sera ( Fig. 6e and Supplementary Fig. S6a ). After intravenous injection of S. pneumoniae into WT, SIGN-R1-KO, or C3-KO mice, pneumococcal uptake and cytoplasmic decomposition were obvious only on splenic MZ SIGN-R1 + macrophages from control mice ( Fig. 6f and Supplementary Fig.  S6b ), but completely abolished in splenic MZs from SIGN-R1-KO and C3-KO mice and red pulp from all mice (Fig. 6f) . The signal specificity of CPS14 on splenic MZ SIGN-R1 + macrophages of control mice in Fig. 6f was confirmed by immunostaining with its respective isotype control immunoglobulins (Supplementary Fig. S6c ). DC-SIGN may mediate the classical complement pathway in LRs from splenic MZ DC-SIGN + macrophages following S. pneumoniae challenge via interactions with C1q When DC-SIGN transfectants were treated with S. pneumoniae, DC-SIGN aggregates were dramatically increased on the cell surface (Fig. 7a) . Additionally, when LR fractions of these cells were immunoblotted for DC-SIGN, monomers and dimers of DC-SIGN were obviously increased in LRs following S. pneumoniae challenge (Fig. 7b) . Moreover, splenic MZ DC-SIGN + macrophages from DC-SIGN BMT /SIGN-R1 TKO mice recovered the rapid recognition of S. pneumoniae on splenic MZs, even at 15 min and 1 h after intravenous injection of the organisms (Fig. 7c) . In spleens at 1 h, DC-SIGN monomers and multimers were obviously upregulated only in splenic LRs following S. pneumoniae challenge (Fig. 7d) . DC-SIGN bound well to purified human C1q or human C1q from NHS (Fig. 7e) . Additionally, DC-SIGN binding to mouse C1q from NMS was confirmed by immunoblotting and immunostaining ( Fig. 7e and Supplementary   Fig. S7a) . We then examined whether DC-SIGN bound directly to C4, similar to SIGN-R1 39 ( Supplementary  Fig. S4a ). DC-SIGN transfectants showed clear fixation of C4 (Fig. 7f) . Additionally, DC-SIGN-transfected HEK293T cells also induced the fixation of C1q or C4 from NHS, confirming again the binding of DC-SIGN to C1q and C4 (Fig. 7g) , and their fixation was significantly increased following S. pneumoniae challenge (Fig. 7g) . In splenic fractions from DC-SIGN BMT /SIGN-R1 TKO mice, upregulation of C1q and C4 was obvious following S. pneumoniae challenge (Fig. 7h) . Moreover, after intravenous injection of S. pneumoniae into DC-SIGN BMT / SIGN-R1 TKO mice, systemic C3 activation reappeared in SIGN-R1 TKO mice as in control mice, demonstrating gradual decrease in αC3 and larger iC3b and a rapid increase and sequential decrease in small iC3b (Fig. 7i) . C3 fixation was also completely recovered around splenic MZ DC-SIGN + macrophages in DC-SIGN BMT /SIGN-R1 TKO mice from SIGN-R1-KO or SIGN-R1 TKO mice as in control mice ( Fig. 7j and Supplementary Fig. S7b ), occurring rapidly within 15 min after challenge with S. pneumoniae and disappearing at 4 h ( Supplementary Fig.  S7c ). Immunostaining with isotype control IgG for anti-C3 antibodies did not yield a C3 signal ( Supplementary  Fig. S7d) . Moreover, immunoblotting of cadaver spleens for C1q, C4, and C3 revealed expression in human splenic LRs, with predominant expression of C1q and 104-kDa αC3′ rather than 113-kDa αC3 (Fig. 7k and Supplementary Fig. S7e ).
