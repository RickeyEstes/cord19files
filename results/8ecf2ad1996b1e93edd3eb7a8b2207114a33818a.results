As illustrated in Table 3 , the number of types of bacteria was nine, namely, Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Escherichia coli (CRE), Klebsiella pneuminae, Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL), Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus (VRE), Burkholderia, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most prevalent MDRO among the isolates (32.4%). E. coli comes next with a percentage of 18.4% followed by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (10.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL) (10.3%). The frequencies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRE), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were nearly equal (8.1%, 7.8%, and 7.5%, resp.). The rest were encountered at a frequency of less than 2%.
