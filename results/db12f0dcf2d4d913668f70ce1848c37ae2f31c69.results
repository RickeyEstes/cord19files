Patient characteristics and laboratory variables. This study included 99 HFMD patients with EV71related encephalitis and 22 FC patients as controls. The baseline characteristics of the study population are listed in Table 1 . In brief, there were no significant differences between encephalitis and FC patients regarding age, gender, and cell number in blood. However, encephalitis patients were more likely to have a longer duration of fever and hospital stay, have higher blood glucose, and have higher WBC and protein concentrations in CSF compared to children with FC. (Fig. 1a ,b,c,e). The CSF MCP-1 levels, on the contrary, were significantly lower in the encephalitis group (69.06 (29.37-217.59) pg/ml) compared to the FC group (199.84 (98.13-571.13) pg/ml) (Fig. 1d) .
