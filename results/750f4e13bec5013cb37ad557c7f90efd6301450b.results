cDNA cloning, mapping of recombinant plasmids, and sequence analysis When we started this sequence study, a number of cDNA clones against cellular RNAs of MHV-A59 was already available. Mapping by hybridization to the viral mRNAs (P. I. Bredenbeek eta/., manuscript in preparation) and sequence analysis indicated that the overlapping clones 95, 918, and 85 were positioned around the 5' end of the f2 gene ( Fig. 1 ). Clone 853 was mapped beyond the 3' end in gene D. Oligonucleotide 7 (OL 7) complementary to a sequence in the 3' end of clone 85 and oligonucleotide 8 (OL 8) based upon the sequence of clone 853 were synthesized and used to screen the new random genomic cDNA library. Several positive recombinant DNA clones were isolated and characterized by restriction site mapping. This permitted construction of a continuous map of approximately 5 kb containing the complete unique region of mRNA 3 encoding the E2 protein. The large insert of clone B24 was isolated and subsequently digested with restriction endonuclease /-/pall or Taql. The complete digests were ligated into M 13 mpg. Initial selection of subclones overlapping the consensus sequence of clones 95, 918, and 85 was performed by hybridizing a probe from clone B60 to phage DNA. The sequence strategy is summarized in Fig The vertical arrow points at the trypsin cleavage site. The double arrow marks the region in MHV-A59 absent in strain JHM. Small boxes represent the synthetic oligonucleotides used in cloning, sequencing, and hybridizations, numbered when referred to in the text. cDNA clones are indicated by horizontal lines. Extent and direction of sequencing is shown by means of the arrows below. Symbols indicating restriction sites are explained in the figure. The hydrophobicity pattern was generated using the HYDROPLOT program created by Staden (1986) . modified with hydrophobicity data from Eisenberg et al. (1982) . Above the line is hydrophobic.
