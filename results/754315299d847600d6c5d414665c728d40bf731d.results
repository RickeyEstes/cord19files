We further estimated the total number of cases with public health intervention efficacy of 70%, 80% and 90%, assuming a 50% diagnosis rate (Scenarios 4, 5 and 6). If 70% efficacy rate could be achieved (Scenario 4), the forecasting number of cases would drop dramatically to 11,056 as of 10 th February compared to 115,355 without public health interventions (Scenario 2). Even fewer cases can be expected if higher efficacy (e.g., 80% or 90%) is achieved.
