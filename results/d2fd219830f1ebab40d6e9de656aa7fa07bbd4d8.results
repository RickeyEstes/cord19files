3.1. Concentration of bioaerosols outside the building during rain (Building Out) Table 1 shows concentrations of fungal and bacterial bioaerosols at three outdoor locations and at one indoor location during rain and without rain. In our measurement campaigns, the concentrations of total culturable fungal bioaerosols were generally higher than the concentrations of total culturable bacterial bioaerosols. In every case, concentrations of bacterial bioaerosols were lower than the legal standard for public health set by the Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Korea (800 CFU/m 3 ). There is no legal standard for fungal bioaerosols in Korea, and to the authors' knowledge, there are no legal standards for bacterial and fungal bioaerosols in Europe, the US and Asia. Table 1 and Fig. 2 show concentrations of fungal bioaerosols outside the building (Building Out). Surprisingly, concentrations of fungal bioaerosols during rain were much higher than those without rain. The concentrations of fungal bioaerosols during rain were approximately seven times higher than those without rain, on average. This trend was also observed for concentrations of bacterial bioaerosols. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3 , concentrations of bacterial bioaerosols during rain were approximately twice those without rain. These results indicate that concentrations of fungal and bacterial bioaerosols outside the building increased during rain events. In Figs. 2 and 3 , concentrations of bioaerosols and PM10 (a particulate matter with a diameter less than 10 mm) showed a different pattern. Concentrations of bioaerosols increased during rain, but those of PM10 decreased. As mentioned earlier, rain has a cleaning effect. That is, rain gathers particles in the air as it falls to the ground and collects particles, including PM10. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the concentration of PM10 decreased during rain events, as expected. In the same air, however, the concentration of bioaerosols did not decrease, but increased during rain events.
