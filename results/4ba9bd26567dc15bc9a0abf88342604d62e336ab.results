All assay-specific IVT and the uncRNA allowed comparable quantification of Zika virus RNA with a mean twofold deviation of results (maximum deviation: sixfold), suggesting the ability to use these controls to generate comparable results even when different real-time RT-PCR assays are used in different laboratories. The two marker assays showed no detection of Zika virus RNA even upon using RNA from high-titred cell culture isolates (10 6 -10 9 T CAT GATA CTG YTGAT TG C YCYG GCAT A YAG YAT CAGG TGCA T AGG AGT YAG YAA TA GGGA YTT TGT  R  GAAG G  T TGR T HAT GATA BTG YTGAT TGY CCCG GCAT ACAG YAT YAGS TGCA T WGG AGT YAGC AAYA GAGA YTT MGT  G  GARG G  T TGG TC A TGA TA C TGC TGA T TGC  CG GCA TAC AG C A TC AGG TGCA TAGG
