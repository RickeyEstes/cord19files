High degree of conservation in G6PD gene from nematode to human. G6PD is ubiquitously present in living organisms from bacteria to mammals. Based on the aminoacid sequence alignment (Figure 1a) , mouse (Mus musculus) G6PD shows the highest homology (93%) compared with human (Homo sapiens) G6PD, followed by zebrafish (Danio rerio, 74%), fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster, 61%), nematode (C. elegans, 56%), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 45%), and bacteria (Escherichia coli, 34%). Similar to eukaryotic G6PD homologues, including fruit fly, zebrafish, and mouse, C. elegans G6PD contains a shorter amino terminus compared with human counterpart (Figure 1a ). In addition, C. elegans G6PD is separated from multicellular eukaryotic and microbial G6PD homologues in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1b) . Although microbial G6PD homologues display lower degree of conservation compared with human counterpart, it has been shown that the bacterial form of G6PD exerts antioxidant activity in G6PD-nullizygous mouse embryonic stem cells. 23 Based on the high degree of conservation between C. elegans and human, it is speculated that C. elegans G6PD is a functional homologue of human G6PD. Generation of G6PD-deficient C. elegans by G6PD knockdown. To investigate the effect of G6PD deficiency in C. elegans, RNAi knockdown technique was employed to inhibit the endogenous G6PD expression. By measuring G6PD status, including mRNA, protein, and enzymatic activity in G6PD-RNAi knockdown (Gi) C. elegans, the knockdown efficiency was determined ( Figure 2 ). As expected, a marked reduction of g6pd mRNA level was detected in Gi C. elegans (22% of mock, Po0.005, N ¼ 4) (Figure 2a ). In addition, western blot analysis using antihuman G6PD polyclonal antibody showed diminished G6PD protein level in Gi C. elegans compared with mock ( Figure 2b , inlet). Consistent with the downregulated G6PD protein expression, a significant decrease of G6PD catalytic activity was detected in Gi C. elegans (11% of mock, Po0.005, N ¼ 8) (Figure 2b ). The residual G6PD activity (11%) in Gi C. elegans was in good accord with our recent report in G6PD-knockdown human cell line. 13 Despite significant depletion of G6PD, no vital growth defects were observed in the first generation of Gi C. elegans compared to mock C. elegans under our experimental condition. Taken together, these results demonstrate that G6PD knockdown in C. elegans is reproducible in the generation of a viable G6PD-deficient animal model. Increased oxidative stress and DNA oxidative damage by G6PD knockdown in C. elegans. G6PD-depleted cells are highly susceptible to oxidative stress-induced cytotoxic effect with the concomitant generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative damage. 11, 12 In order to test whether G6PD knockdown increased oxidative stress in C. elegans, the level of oxidative stress and oxidative damage were determined ( Figure 3 ). By incubating first-day C. elegans adult with ROS-sensitive fluorescent dye 2 0 , 7 0 dichlorodihydrofluoroscein diacetate (DCFDA), increased ROS was detected in Gi C. elegans compared with mock C. elegans (1.2-fold, P ¼ 0.038, N ¼ 6) (Figure 3a ). To further investigate whether G6PD deficiency caused oxidative damage in macromolecues, malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were measured. While there was no significant difference of MDA level between mock and Gi C. elegans (data not shown), 8-OHdG level was significantly increased in Gi C. elegans compared to mock (1.5-fold, P ¼ 0.005, N ¼ 6) (Figure 3b ). This finding is consistent with a previous report in G6PD-deficient cell model, 11 indicating that G6PD may play a role in protecting cells against DNA oxidative damage in C. elegans. Decreased egg production and hatching by G6PD knockdown in C. elegans. In the first generation of Gi C. elegans, no significant phenotypic changes including morphology, pharyngeal pumping, mobility, and growth rate were observed (data not shown). The lack of major phenotypes upon G6PD knockdown indicated that the residual G6PD activity in Gi C. elegans is sufficient to maintain basic cell functions in C. elegans (Figure 2b) . Nevertheless, the brood size derived from the first generation of Gi hermaphrodite was significantly reduced (65% of mock, P ¼ 0.011, n ¼ 60) compared with mock control (Figure 4a ). This finding indicates that G6PD is required for maintaining normal egg production. In addition to the decreased egg production upon G6PD knockdown, a majority of eggs produced by Gi C. elegans were unable to hatch compared with mock (10% of mock, Po0.005, n ¼ 60) (Figure 4b ). This dramatic observation is consistent with a previous report that G6PD knockdown induces embryonic lethality in C. elegans. 24 Enhanced germ cell apoptosis by G6PD knockdown in C. elegans. In order to investigate whether decreased egg production induced by G6PD knockdown is the consequence of enhanced germ cell death, the germ cell apoptosis was determined in G6PD-deficient C. elegans using GFP reporter strain bcIs39 (P lim-7 ced-1::gfp), which highlights somatic sheath cell around apoptotic germ cells upon oogenesis. 25 Under basal condition, the number of apoptotic germ cells in bcIs39 Gi C. elegans was significantly increased by 2-fold (7.4 per gonad, P ¼ 0.04, n ¼ 80) compared with bcIs39 mock (3.7 per gonad, n ¼ 60) (Figure 4c ). This result clearly demonstrates that reduction of G6PD increases germ cell apoptosis. Involvement of high oxidative stress in altered germ cell apoptosis and egg production by G6PD knockdown in C. elegans. Increased oxidative stress has been associated with reduced brood size in C. elegans. [26] [27] [28] To test whether high oxidative stress was involved in altered germ cell apoptosis and egg production caused by G6PD knockdown, a short-term H 2 O 2 treatment was exogenously applied to C. elegans adult followed by scoring the apoptotic germ cells (Figures 5a and b) and egg production (Figure 5c ). At 5 mM and 10 mM H 2 O 2 , the apoptotic germ cells were increased in mock C. elegans (6.2±1.8 cells per gonad, P ¼ 0.109 and 7.5 ± 1.9 cells per gonad, Po0.005, respectively) compared with untreated control (3.7±1.3 cells per gonad) ( Figure 5a ). However, the apoptotic germ cells in H 2 O 2 -treated Gi C. elegans showed no discernible difference (5 mM H 2 O 2 : 7.8 ± 2.3 cells per gonad, P ¼ 0.276 and 10 mM H 2 O 2 : 7.2±1.7 cells per gonad, P ¼ 0.652) compared with untreated Gi control (7.4 ± 1.9 cells per gonad) ( Figure 5a) . Furthermore, at 5 mM H 2 O 2 , the total egg production of both mock and Gi C. elegans were not significantly affected compared with untreated control (P ¼ 0.924 and P ¼ 0.832, respectively) ( Figure 5c and Supplementary Table S1 ). Nevertheless, during the first half of egg-laying period (day 1 to day 2), the egg production was markedly reduced in mock and Gi C. elegans compared with untreated control (72% of mock control, P ¼ 0.013 and 67% of Gi control, P ¼ 0.022, respectively), whereas no significant difference was found in the second half of egg-laying period (day 3 to day 4). Remarkably, at 10mM H 2 O 2 , the total egg production was significantly reduced in both mock and Gi C. elegans compared with untreated control (65% of mock control, P ¼ 0.010 and 62% of Gi control, P ¼ 0.028, respectively). From day 1 to day 2, the egg production was severely decreased in mock and Gi C. elegans compared with untreated control (34% of mock control, P ¼ 0.001 and 38% of Gi control, P ¼ 0.001, respectively), whereas there was no significant difference in the second half of egg-laying period (day 3 to day 4). Taken together, these data indicate that high oxidative stress could be associated with G6PD knockdown-induced germ cell apoptosis and reduced egg production. Other possible mechanisms of defective egg production induced by G6PD knockdown in C. elegans. In order to elucidate the signaling pathway associated with defective egg production caused by G6PD deficiency, loss-of-function mutants of possible pathways were analyzed for their egg production. It has been shown that p53 protein expression is upregulated in oxidant-treated G6PD-deficient human fibroblasts. 11 Likewise, Gi C. elegans showed enhanced CEP-1 (p53) protein expression (1.37-fold, Figure S1 ). However, cep-1 mutation neither affected egg production (P ¼ 0.313, n ¼ 70) nor prevented G6PD knockdown-induced defective egg production in C. elegans (P ¼ 0.622, n ¼ 70) (Figure 6a ), indicating that reduced egg production caused by G6PD deficiency is independent to cep-1. It has been shown that G6PD knockdown enhances the inhibitory effect of H 2 O 2 on protein tyrosine phosphatase and causes sustained MAPK activation leading to cell demise. 13 In order to investigate whether MAPK played a role in G6PD knockdown-induced defective egg production, C. elegans MAPK mutants, including pmk-1, sek-1, and mek-1 were scored for their egg production under basal and G6PD knockdown conditions (Figures 6b-d) . Our results showed that pmk-1 mutant exhibited minor decrease of egg production compared to mock (91% of mock, Po0.001, n ¼ 70), whereas the egg production of the pmk-1/g6pd(RNAi) double mutant was similar to that of Gi C. elegans (P ¼ 0.136, n ¼ 70) (Figure 6b ). On the other hand, sek-1 mutant displayed reduced egg production similar to Gi C. elegans (76% of mock, Po0.001, n ¼ 70). Notably, sek-1/g6pd(RNAi) double mutant showed further decrease of egg production (42% of Gi C. elegans, Po0.001, n ¼ 70) (Figure 6c ). The mek-1 mutant displayed no difference of egg production compared with mock (P ¼ 0.334, n ¼ 60) (Figure 6d) . Also, the egg production of the mek-1/g6pd(RNAi) double mutant was indistinguishable to that of Gi C. elegans (P ¼ 0.471, n ¼ 60). Taken together, these results suggest that sek-1, but not mek-1 or pmk-1, acts in parallel to G6PD in the modulation of egg production. Involvement of MAPK pathways in defective hatching of G6PD-knockdown C. elegans. Since the hatching of the embryos was severely affected by G6PD knockdown (Figure 4b) , possible signaling pathways such as p53 and MAPK were examined (Figure 7) . Compared with the diminished hatching of Gi C. elegans (8.0%, Po0.001, n ¼ 70), the loss of function of cep-1/g6pd(RNAi) double mutant also displayed low hatching (6.9%, P ¼ 0.408, n ¼ 70). Similarly, the pmk-1/g6pd(RNAi) double mutant exhibited low hatching compared with Gi C. elegans (8.7%, P ¼ 0.568, n ¼ 70). Intriguingly, the hatching was significantly increased in sek-1/g6pd(RNAi) and mek-1/g6pd(RNAi) double mutants compared with Gi C. elegans (8.3-fold, P ¼ 0.019, n ¼ 70 and 9.6-fold, Po0.001, n ¼ 60, respectively). Taken together, these results suggest that sek-1 and mek-1 play essential roles in the modulation of hatching in G6PD-knockdown C. elegans embryos.
