(bases 89 to 1244) that had been sequenced enzymatically. Most of the other clones were able to hybridize to PIB23, but restriction enzyme mapping showed that none extended the sequence beyond that of PIB23 in either direction. A non-hybridizable insert, designated PIB18, was sequenced; it was 790 bases long and, as we will demonstrate below, mapped 3' to PIB23. To prepare clones covering other regions, cDNAs synthesized with calf thymus DNA fragments as primers, were used to generate a plasmid cDNA clone bank. A total of 300 colonies were examined by hybridization with 32P-labeled PIB23 and PIBlS DNA inserts. Three groups of clones were selected for analysis: group 1 clones hybridized to both PIB23 and PIB18; group 2 clones hybridized to PIB18 only; and group 3 clones hybridized to neither. The recombinant plasmid in group 1 containing the largest cDNA insert, was selected (PIB17) and its insert was sequenced. This sequence of 969 bases joined PIB23 and PIB18 and produced a contiguous sequence of 2533 bases from the 5' end. Group 2 clones were analyzed with restriction enzymes and from these the clone PIBll8 was selected and its insert sequenced. It started at base 2153 and extended the sequence to base 3022. All of the group 3 clones were hybridizable to PIB118 but restriction analysis showed that none contained sequences further downstream. Various procedures were tried to modify the primary or secondary structure of the 3' terminus of RNA1 none of which facilitated its polvadenylation. (1) the RNA was heated for five &nut,es at I   1 I  I  I  I I  I  I I II II  II I III  II  811 I I III I l 1  ' I l j  I I  II  III  II  IllllI  Ill  I IT   3'   I  I  I  I  I  I  II  I I  I I  II  I  I  I I  III  I  I  I I  I  I  II  III  II  II  II II  I  Ill1  5'   1 Yl   I  'II I   I  II  I  II  IllI  I  II  II  Ill  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  II I I  III   I  I  I  I 70°C followed by quick chilling at 0°C just prior to attempting polyadenylation; (2) polyadenylation was tried in the presence of CH,HgOH; (3) the RNA was treated with alkaline phosphatase to remove a possible phosphate group. We were also unsuccessful in attempts to label the RNA1 3' terminus with [32P]pCp and phage T4 ligase (England & Uhlenbeck, 1978) as a preliminary to enzymatic sequencing. Additional experiments (to be described elsewhere) now indicate that a protein is bound to the 3' terminus of RNAl. Previously we had determined the sequence of BBV RNA3 (389 bases) by direct enzymatic RNA sequencing methods and by chemical sequencing of its cDNA (Guarino et al., 1984) and this proved to be helpful in completing the RNA1 sequence. Since RNA3 is produced in RNAl-transfected cells but is not needed for infectivity (Gallagher et al., 1983) we assumed that its entire sequence is encoded in RNAl, and indeed inspection showed that the sequence of the 306 bases at the 5' end of the RNA3 sequence were found to be identical to the sequence of the 306 bases at the 3' end of the partial RNA1 sequence, above. Thus, we synthesized a DNA oligonucleotide complementary to the 15 bases at the 3' terminus of RNA3 sequence and used it for RNA1 priming. This oligonucleotide served as an efficient primer for cDNA sequencing of RNA1 and, as expected, yielded an RNA1 sequence identical to the remaining 83 bases of RNAS. We cannot unequivocally rule out the possibility that bases exist to the right of position 3105. However, this is unlikely inasmuch as we were able to label the 3' termini of both double-stranded RNA1 and RNA3 (obtained from infected cells) with [32P]pCp and T4 ligase, and showed that the 3' termini of their positive strands have the sequence we reported immediately to the left of base 3105, and moreover that these sequences terminate with a 3' hydroxyl group. The molecular weight of RNA1 calculated from the sequence is 1.02 x lo6 and is in good agreement with the estimated molecular weight of RNA1 as obtained by denaturing gel electrophoresis (Longworth & Carey, 1976 ) and by oligonucleotide fingerprinting (Clewley et al., 1982) . The RNA1 sequence contains several A-rich regions, among them the sequence G-A-A-A-G-A-A-A-A-G (bases 1052 to 1061) which we judge to be the site of the observed strong internal priming with oligo(dT). The longest open reading frame follows the first AUG codon at bases 39 to 41 and terminates with a UAA codon at bases 2730 to 2732. The 897 amino acid sequence coded by this frame corresponds to a protein of molecular weight 101,873 (Fig. 3) , which is in good agreement with a previous estimate of 104,000 for the molecular weight of protein A (Friesen & Rueckert, 1981) . The second 5' proximal initiating codon occurs at bases 564 to 566 and would correspond to a protein too small to be protein A. The other two reading frames are tightly closed in the region 1 to 2700, thus precluding t,heir coding for other proteins of substantial size. The longest open reading frame in the negative strand of RNA1 is only 210 bases long. The RNA3 sequence start's at position 2717. Two open reading frames exist in the RNA3 region, following AUG codons at bases 2736 to 2738 in the protein A phase and bases 2726 to 2728 in a second phase; the third frame is tightly closed. These frames are 318 and 306 bases in length, encoding putative proteins of molecular weight 11,633 (designated protein B2) and 10,760 (designated protein Bl), either or both of which could be protein B, found in BBV-infected cells (see the Discussion). No striking homology was observed among the 5'-terminal nor among the 3'-terminal sequences of RNA1 and RNA2. RNA1 (bases 7 to 12) and RNA2 (bases 3 to 8) both have the sequence A-A-A-C-A-A near their 5' termini. The sequence A-G-G-U is conserved at the 3' end of RNAs 1 and 2. Neither were there strong homologies in the coding regions. Nine-base-long homologies exist; bases 3019 to 3027 in RNA1 versus bases 34 to 42 in RNAB, and bases 2663 to 2671 in RNA1 versus bases 484 to 492 in RNAB.
