A systematic search for MERS publication retrieved 926 articles in PubMed, from which two duplications were removed, leaving 924 articles. Screening through titles and abstracts excluded 481 articles (335 unrelated to MERS, 29 news, two books and 333 non-research papers). Therefore, 443 articles were included for analysis ( Figure 1 ).  A systematic search for MERS publication retrieved 926 articles in PubMed, from which two duplications were removed, leaving 924 articles. Screening through titles and abstracts excluded 481 articles (335 unrelated to MERS, 29 news, two books and 333 non-research papers). Therefore, 443 articles were included for analysis ( Figure 1 ). The retrieved articles were from 40 countries, of which USA ranked first, followed by China and Saudi Arabia in that order ( Table 3 ). The articles published in these three countries far outnumbered the others. Saudi Arabia is the country where MERS originated and that was most seriously stricken by the disease [1]. Fifteen countries, including Austria, Belgium and India, published only one article. The organizations were classified into six categories, specifically government department, research organization, university, hospital, centers for disease control and prevention, and others (company, blood center, Red Cross, etc.). More than half (62.4%) of the research output came from universities, followed by research organizations (10%), others (9.5%), hospitals (8.5%), government departments (6.3%) and CDCs (3.2%). The three most productive organizations were the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia, the University of Hong Kong in China, and the University of Bonn in Germany (Table 4 ). (Table 5 ) [11] . The other most productive corresponding authors are from Germany, USA, Netherlands, France and China. Ranking of the research categories was prevention and control study (26.2%), basic medical sciences and clinical studies (47.2%), and other studies (26.6%) ( Table 6 ). The differences between the three categories in the three years were statistically significant (X 2 = 23.849, p = 0.000) ( Table 6 ). Of all the 443 articles, 378 were published in SCI journals, with a minimum IF of 0.24, maximum of 55.87 and median of 4.43, and an interquartile range between 2.85 and 6.75 (Table 7 ). The mean ranks of the three categories were found to be prevention and control studies (226.34), basic medical sciences and clinical studies (180.23), and others (168.03). Differences in mean ranks of IF between the three types were statistically significant (Kruskal Wallis Test X 2 = 16.031, p = 0.000). A total of 116 articles were identified as covering prevention and control and 99 were SCI articles with IF. The domains of the 99 SCI articles with IF were transmission and risk factors, investigation and surveillance, intervention and others ( Table 8 ). The minimum IF was 0.59, the maximum 55.87, and the median 5.99, with an interquartile range between 3.01 and 8.88. The mean rank of IF of transmission and risk factors was 46.99, of investigation and surveillance 48.26, of intervention 53.33, and of others 56.32. The differences in the IF mean ranks between the four types were not statistically significant (X 2 = 1.936, p = 0.586). A map was created with VOSviewer, showing the density of the frequently used terms in MERS-related articles (Figure 2 ). Colored regions represent research areas. The font size and bubble size of a term reflect its frequency of use [7] . For example, the term "coronavirus" was more frequently used than the term "risk" because the former is in larger font than the latter. The most frequently used terms were "coronavirus", "case", "transmission" and "detection". It is noticeable that less frequent terms, for example "vaccine", had inconspicuous views.
