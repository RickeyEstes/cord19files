The socio-demographic characteristics of the SARS and H1N1 survey respondents are shown in Table 3 . Overall, there was a shift to older, more educated and more affluent respondents in the 2010 H1N1survey as compared to the 2004 SARS survey. This is most likely due to changes in the households that could be accessed by landline telephones. The proportion of Canadian households with a residential landline decreased from 91% in 2006 (this information is not readily available for the 2004 survey year) to 67% in 2010. Concurrently, the proportion of [41, 42] . Furthermore, the changing use of landlines is age dependent. In 2010, 80% of households comprised solely of people aged 55 and over had at least one landline, compared with 56% of households comprised of people aged 54 and under [40] . A 2008 survey showed that younger households were much more likely to use only a cell phone; 34.4% of households comprised solely of adults aged between 18 and 34 relied exclusively on cell phones, while among all other households the rate was 4.5% [43] . This change in accessibility through the survey method of random digit dialling of landline telephones is also likely the cause of the decreased response rate between the two surveys. Table 4 also compares the socio-demographics results of the SARS and H1N1 surveys (as well as the H1N1 age and education results as weighted against the SARS results) against census results for both Canada 44 , p < 0.001), with a higher percentage of respondents who have at least completed high school, and a lower percentage of respondents who have less than a high school education (compared to both Canada and Alberta). Finally, the household income distribution of the SARS 2004 sample deviates significantly from the Canadian population (χ 2 = 73.13, p < 0.001), with a higher percentage of respondents with household income of $70,000 or more, and a lower percentage of respondents with household income below $70,000. However, household income distribution of the SARS 2004 sample does not deviate significantly from the Albertan population. The age distribution of the H1N12010 sample deviates significantly from the 2011 Canadian population (χ 2 = 38.03, p < 0.001) and the 2011 Alberta population (χ 2 = 120.75, p < 0.001), with a higher percentage of respondents who are 46 years old or older, and a lower percentage of young respondents (18 to 35 years old) (compared to both Canada and Alberta). The weighted age distribution of the H1N12010 sample also deviates significantly from the 2011 Canadian population (χ 2 = 79.30, p < 0.001) and the 2011 Alberta populations (χ 2 = 42.47, p < 0.001), with a higher percentage of middle-age respondents (36 to 60 years old), and a lower percentage of older respondents (61+) (compared to both Canada and Alberta) and a lower percentage of younger respondents (18 to 35 years old) (Alberta only). To compensate for the shift in the Alberta population available to be surveyed using random digit dialling of landline telephones between the 2004 SARS survey and the 2010 H1N1 survey, the H1N1 survey results shown in Tables 4 and 5 have been weighted by age and education against the SARS survey results. This allows for a more direct comparison of the effects of age and education on the results obtained in the two surveys. Age was more likely to account for the variability in information source usage within both the SARS and H1N1 survey results. Not surprisingly, older respondents used traditional information sources (newspaper, television and radio) more, but used the Internet less, than younger respondents. However, interestingly, younger respondents used doctors, health professionals and friends/relatives as information sources more than older respondents. By contrast, age was not a significant factor in any of the responses on usefulness and credibility in the SARS survey. The minor age related differences Table 4 . Mean information scores, and differences associated with age (by age group) and educational level (post-secondary versus high school or less). noted in the responses from the H1N1 survey probably reflect the older demographic of this population. Instead, education was more likely to account for the variability in the identified usefulness and perceived credibility of each information source within the two surveys. Educational differences were particularly notable for the Internet and known health professionals, which were deemed to be both more useful and credible by those with higher education (post-secondary, including any education following high school) in both surveys. Education effects were also observed between the two surveys. Television was seen as less useful and less credible by those with higher education in the SARS survey, but not in the H1N1 survey. Educational differences in the usefulness and credibility of call lines, such as Health Link, seen during the SARS survey were not evident in the H1N1 survey. Doctors were considered to be more useful and credible as information sources by those with higher education only in the H1N1 survey.
