Generation of Transgenic Mice. The cDNAs of the LCMV NP and GP genes were cloned behind the MBP promoter to direct expression to CNS oligodendrocytes as indicated in Fig. 1 A. This MBP promoter vector had previously been shown to drive expression of a transgene specifically in CNS oligodendrocytes in transgenic mice (18) . Eight founders were identified carrying the LCMV-NP construct, and seven MBP-GP carriers were identified. Because greater than 97% of the LCMV-specific CTL response on the H-2 d background is to an epitope in NP (16), the MBP-NP mice were bred to BALB/cByJ (H-2 d ) mice to maximize the proportion of NP-reactive CTL after LCMV infection. Likewise, because the majority of LCMVspecific CTL react with two epitopes in GP on the H-2 b background (25) , the MBP-GP mice were bred to C57BL/6 (H-2 b ) mice. Tissue specific expression of the transgenes was demonstrated by RT-PCR ( Fig. 1 B ) . Oligonucleotide primers were designed to take advantage of the PLP intron within the vector. By amplifying a product across the intron as shown in Fig. 1 A , spliced mRNA could be distinguished from both unspliced mRNA as well as contaminating genomic DNA. RT-PCR product that corresponded in size to correctly spliced RNA message was identified in the brains of 7 out of 8 MBP-NP lines and in 7 out of 7 MBP-GP lines. An RT-PCR survey of RNA from various organs did not detect transgene-specific message in the liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas, lung, heart, or sciatic nerve. However, ‫ف‬ 25% of the lines showed spliced RNA transgene expression in the thymus. Two MBP-NP (5 and 60) and two MBP-GP (36 and 46) lines with only CNS expression of the transgenes were chosen for further study (Fig. 1 , B and C ) and bred to the F4 level to BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice, respectively. Immunohistochemical approaches (in situ immunohistochemistry and Western blot) were undertaken to identify the transgene products in brain tissue; however, these attempts were unsuccessful. Protein expression in the MBP-NP and -GP mice is likely below the level of sensitivity of antibody detection. Previous attempts at identifying LCMV gene products expressed as a transgene of the rat insulin promoter in the ␤ cells of the Islets of Langerhans had also failed (19) . However, these transgenic mice were subsequently shown to express the transgene as shown by CTL recognition of pancreatic ␤ cells, T cell recognition being at least two logs more sensitive than antibody recognition (28, 29) . MBP-NP and -GP mice from all lines were observed for up to 1 yr of age. None of the mice studied showed any signs of clinical disease due to the consequences of brainspecific expression of these viral genes. Additionally, histological examinations of CNS tissue taken at various ages did not detect any abnormalities. Characterization of the Immune Response to LCMV in Transgenic Mice. This model requires the transgenic mice to mount an immune response against the transgene, which is a self-protein. Therefore, the first question addressed was whether the transgenic mice were immunologically responsive to the transgene (self) products. The ability of the MBP-LCMV transgenic mice to generate both anti-viral (self) CTL and antibodies was assessed. CTL responses of the transgenic mice were measured in 51 Cr release assays using splenic lymphocytes harvested 7 d after infection with LCMV. Transgenic and nontransgenic mice from all four transgenic MBP-NP and -GP lines were able to lyse MHC-matched target cells infected with LCMV (Table 1 ). In addition, BALB clone 7 (H-2 d ) target cells infected with a recombinant VV expressing the NP from LCMV (VV-NP) were lysed by lymphocytes from MBP-NP transgenic positive and negative mice. Likewise, MC57 (H-2 b ) target cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the GP from LCMV (VV-GP) were effectively lysed by lymphocytes from MBP-GP transgenic positive and negative mice. The ability of transgenic mice to mount anti-LCMV antibody responses was evaluated using an ELISA assay with gradient-purified LCMV. At 2 mo after infection with LCMV, MBP-NP and -GP transgenic positive and negative mice showed good antibody responses (antibody titers Ͼ 10 5 ; data not shown). Thus, the transgenic positive mice generated LCMV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses equivalent to transgenic negative mice, indicating they were able to mount immune responses to the viral self-proteins expressed as transgenes. Effects of LCMV Infection of Transgenic Mice. Transgenic positive and negative mice from the two MBP-NP and two MBP-GP lines ( Fig. 1 C ) , bred to the F2-F4 level, were infected peripherally with LCMV. After i.p. infection of immunocompetent mice with LCMV, viral replication occurs in many tissues and cell types, but not within the CNS (14, 30) . This was confirmed by in situ hybridization studies using LCMV-specific riboprobes after i.p. infection of transgenic mice (data not shown). Clearance of LCMV in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice normally occurs within 7-14 d after infection and is mediated by a vigorous CD8 ϩ CTL response (13, 14, 31) . When assessed by plaque assays of serum samples, transgenic positive mice cleared virus with the same kinetics as transgenic negative mice. To determine whether lymphocytic infiltration of the CNS occurred after peripheral infection with LCMV, transgenic positive and negative mice were killed at various times postinfection and sagittal brain sections were stained with antibodies to the T cell surface markers CD4 and CD8. Approximately 1,000 lymphocytes were observed per sagittal section at 1 wk after infection in both transgenic positive and negative mice. The majority of these lymphocytes were CD8 ϩ and were found within the meninges and ventricular linings of the brain. These cells were most likely activated by the viral infection and were trafficking through the CNS as a normal part of immune surveillance after activation in the periphery (32) . By 2 wk after infection, fewer meningeal infiltrating cells were observed in both transgenic positive and negative mice. By 3 wk after infection, in nontransgenic mice less than 30 lymphocytes could be found per sagittal section, and by 5 wk after infection less than 5 lymphocytes were detected per section. In contrast, in transgenic positive mice, at 3 wk after infection about 150-300 CD8 ϩ cells were found per section. These cells were located in the brain parenchyma as well as the brain stem and spinal cord, and perivascular cuffs were often observed. In addition, CD4 ϩ cells were present and comprised 20% of the infiltrating T cells. Brains of transgenic positive mice taken at various times after infection were found to contain this level of CD8 ϩ infiltrates as long as 1 yr after infection. By 1 yr after infection, the numbers of CD4 ϩ staining cells had risen to approximately half the number of CD8 ϩ staining cells per section. At 3 wk after infection, the infiltrating cells did not localize to any particular area or location within the brain. By 3 mo after infection, clusters of CD4 ϩ and CD8 ϩ cells were found predominantly within the white matter regions of the CNS, including the corpus callosum, internal capsule, fimbria hippocampus, brain stem, and spinal cord (Fig. 2, A, B, F, G) . Lymphocytes were isolated from the brains of MBP-NP transgenic positive mice 3 wk after LCMV infection and tested in 51 Cr-release CTL assays after in vitro stimulation with LCMV. These lymphocytes were found to effectively lyse MHC-matched target cells infected with either LCMV or recombinant VV expressing the LCMV NP (data not shown). To assess whether expression of a foreign protein by oligodendrocytes alone was enough to alter the pattern of immune surveillance in the CNS, transgenic mice expressing ␤-gal (MBP-␤gal) using the same MBP expression vector (18) were infected with LCMV and followed over time. The pattern of kinetics of immune cell infiltration in MBP-␤gal mice was identical to that observed for the nontransgenic mice. To test whether infection with other viruses could result in chronic CNS infiltration, MBP-LCMV transgenic positive mice were infected with vaccinia virus or Pichinde virus and followed over time. Infection of MBP-NP and MBP-GP mice by either of these viruses did not result in a chronic immune infiltration of their CNS tissue, and the pattern of immune surveillance was similar to that observed in nontransgenic mice. Consequences of Chronic Immune Cell Infiltration. To characterize further the effects of the inflammatory cell infiltration of the CNS of transgenic positive and negative mice after LCMV infection, brain sections were stained with additional immunohistochemical markers. The presence of B cells in the infiltrating population was examined using antibody to the B cell marker, B220. Insignificant numbers of B220 ϩ cells were observed in both transgenic positive and negative mice. Antibody to F4/80, a cell surface marker found on microglia, monocytes, and macrophages, revealed an upregulation of this molecule in regions of infiltrating T cells in transgenic positive mice (Fig. 2, C and H) . Microglial activation was observed as long as 1 yr after infection in association with T cell infiltration. Antibodies to MHC class I and II molecules were used to determine whether an increase in these antigen presentation markers was observed in response to the immune cell infiltration (Fig. 2, D, E, I, J) . In uninfected and LCMV-infected nontransgenic mice, MHC class I antigen staining was limited to the leptomeninges, choroid plexus, and endothelial cells of blood vessels. MHC class II staining was confined to a few macrophage-like cells in the interstitium of the choroid plexus. Staining for MHC class I and class II molecules in the brains of transgenic positive mice revealed that by 6 wk after infection there was an upregulation of both of these antigens on CNS cells in the vicinity of the infiltrating T cells, particularly pronounced in white matter regions. Antibody to MHC class I detected a fine reticular staining pattern in white matter regions, as well as staining many distinct cell types including those with microglial, lymphocyte, and endothelial cell morphology. Oligodendrocytes expressing MHC class I were identified by laser scanning confocal microscopy by colocalizing antibody to 2Ј,3Ј-cyclic nucleotide 3Ј-phosphodiesterase (CNP) with antibody to MHC class I (Horwitz, M.S, C.F. Evans, and M.B.A. Oldstone, manuscript submitted for publication). Anti-MHC class II antibodies stained cells of different morphologies including cells similar to microglia. This upregulation of MHC class I and class II molecules was observed in association with infiltrating lymphocytes for at least 1 yr after infection with LCMV. Light and confocal microscopic analyses of sagittal brain sections stained with luxol fast blue or antibodies to myelin basic protein and CD8 failed to reveal any areas of myelin damage in the transgenic mice after a single LCMV infection. Following infection with LCMV, transgenic positive and negative mice were observed for clinical phenotypes including ruffled fur, weight loss, and ability to walk on a narrow stick. In addition, mice were subjected to a test utilizing a rotating rod apparatus (rotorod), which measured their ability to maintain balance and motor function. By approximately 3 mo after infection, 75% of the transgenic positive mice appeared ruffled and experienced balance difficulties when walking on the stick. No significant differences were observed between transgenic and nontransgenic animals with the rotorod test. By 3.5 mo after infection, 2 out of 40 transgenic positive mice experienced seizures, and 1 out of 40 exhibited weight loss and ataxia. These results indicate that infection of mice by a virus that shares immune determinants with a protein expressed in oligodendrocytes can induce a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS associated with clinical abnormalities. Enhancement of Autoimmune CNS Disease by Memory T Cell Stimulation. Since memory T cells require fewer activation signals and are potentially more aggressive than primary responding lymphocytes, the influence of a second viral infection on the immunohistochemical and clinical abnormalities in transgenic positive mice was examined. MBP-NP transgenic positive and negative mice previously infected with LCMV were reinfected with LCMV or a VV recombinant encoding the NP transgene (VV-NP) at 6 wk after primary infection. Immunohistochemical analysis of the CNS showed a three-to fivefold increase in CD8 ϩ lymphocytes in the transgenic positive mice at 4 wk after second infection with either LCMV or VV-NP, as compared with transgenic positive mice infected singly with LCMV at the same time after primary infection (10 wk). Additionally, a 10-fold increase in the number of CD4 ϩ T cells was 2376 Virus-induced Central Nervous System Autoimmune Disease detected compared with the number of cells observed after a single infection. The ratio of CD8 ϩ to CD4 ϩ cells in the doubly infected mice was 2:1 (Fig. 3, A and B) . The infiltrating cells in the doubly infected transgenic mice were found predominantly within white matter structures of the brain, and perivascular cuffs were observed. Coinciding with these increased levels of T cell infiltration, enhanced areas of F4/80 staining were observed (Fig. 3, C and D) . In addition, an upregulation of the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was observed. A marked increase in the expression of both MHC class I and II markers was observed in areas rich in myelin and coinciding with regions of T cell infiltration (Fig. 3, E-H) . Oligodendrocytes were again identified by confocal microscopy as expressing MHC class I. Focal areas with high numbers of infiltrating T cells were found in the parenchyma of the brain associated with myelin tracts. These lesions of infiltrating lymphocytes spanned several consecutive sections, ranged in size from 25-150 m, and as many as five lesions per sagittal section were found. Immunohistochemical staining showed that they consisted of both CD8 ϩ and CD4 ϩ T cells. Double immunofluorescent labeling of brain sections with antibody to CD8 and MBP and subsequent confocal microscopic analysis revealed a loss of MBP staining at the center of these lesions ( Fig. 4 A) . Double labeling with antibodies to F4/80 and MBP revealed the presence of activated macrophages/microglia around the lesions and colocalization of MBP within these activated macrophages/microglia (Fig. 4, B-D) . To characterize the nature of the CNS-directed immune response, RNA extracts from the brains of MBP-NP transgenic positive and negative mice undergoing the double infection protocol were subjected to an RNase protection assay using probes to a number of cytokines (20) . Brains from transgenic mice first infected with LCMV, secondarily infected 6 wk later with either LCMV or VV-NP, and sacrificed after another 4 wk, contained increased message levels of the following cytokines when compared with Following a second viral infection with LCMV or VV-NP, transgenic positive and negative mice were tested for motor impairment on the rotorod apparatus. As seen in Fig. 5 B, transgenic negative mice performed significantly better than the transgenic positive mice over three trials on the rotorod. These differences in rotorod balancing indicated motor coordination dysfunction in the doubly infected transgenic mice (26, 27) .
