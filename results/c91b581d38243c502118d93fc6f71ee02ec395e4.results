Exponential doubling time, T 2 . We calculated the exponential growth rate of the epidemic, r , from the early stages of the epidemic in China, such that the effect of control measures discussed later will be relative to the early stages of an outbreak, exemplified by baseline contact patterns and environmental conditions in Hubei during that period. We note that this assumption is implicit in many estimates of R 0 . The epidemic doubling time T 2 , equal to log e (2) / r , was previously estimated as 7.4 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.2 to 14) from data on the first 425 cases in Wuhan ( 8 ) , and independently as 7.2 days (95% credible interval 4.7 to 16.3) by phylodynamic analysis of 86 whole SARS-CoV-2 genomes ( http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic-analysis-129-genomes-24-feb-2020/356 ). We analysed the former data source together with the China Centre for Disease Control counts of daily confirmed cases (http://2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-nCoV/), visually identified two periods of consistent early exponential growth, and obtained a more precise combined estimate of T 2 = 5.0 days (95% CI 4.3 to 6.2).

Numbers of people later reporting symptoms beginning that day, from the first 425 cases analysed by ( 8 ) , are shown for those reporting exposure to a wet market (red circles) and those reporting no exposure to any wet market (blue triangles). Also shown are numbers of people confirmed as cases each day (green squares) and number of deaths each day (purple plus signs) from China Centre for Disease Control data. Five visually identified periods of exponential growth have the best-fit linear model shown with a coloured line and 95% confidence intervals in grey shading. Two of these fits (blue and first green) were merged into a single best estimate of the epidemic exponential growth rate r (grey box). Counts of zero are shown on the x axis (log(0) being undefined).
