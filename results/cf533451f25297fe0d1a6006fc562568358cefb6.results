Generation and verification of 32D6. As described in the experimental section (see below) and as summarized in Fig. 1a , a human monoclonal antibody neutralizing the influenza A virus was obtained from the peripheral blood of vaccinated healthy volunteers using an EBV-based strategy. Peripheral CD19+ and CD27+ memory B cells were isolated from healthy donors and were immortalized via EBV. H1N1-specific clones with binding and neutralizing activities were screened and selected through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralization assays. Based on its potency, the antibody clone 32D6 was chosen as the lead clone. It was further characterized using a number of techniques, including ELISA and cell-based neutralization assays, as well as surface plasmon resonance (SPR). To verify the specificity of the 32D6 monoclonal antibody against the H1N1 virus, additional ELISA was performed by using not only H1N1 (A/Taiwan/80813/2013) but also two other strains, namely, H5N1 and H7N9. As shown in Fig. 1b , the specific binding profile of 32D6 and H1N1 followed a hyperbolic curve, suggesting a strong interaction between the antibody and virus. In contrast, very weak binding was observed for either H5N1 or H7N9 as the binding partner of 32D6. The specificity was also examined via a neutralization assay. As shown in Fig. 1c , 32D6 showed strong neutralization ability against the H1N1 virus. The profile of 32D6 neutralization activity against H1N1 also turned out to be hyperbolic, from which a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 0.036 μg/mL was calculated (Fig. 1d) . Further, 32D6 showed little activity against all other strains, H3N2, H5N1 and H7N9 (Fig. 1c) . In summary, 32D6 is a specific anti-H1N1 monoclonal antibody. 32D6 Fab shows high affinity to H1N1 HA1. An intact antibody contains two antigen-binding sites in two Fab. The full-length HA can be divided into two regions, the hemagglutinin head domain (HA1) and hemagglutinin stalk domain (HA2), and it may form a trimer via HA2. Judging by the nature of the divalent antibody and the trimeric HA, and because the HA variations of different strains occur mainly in the HA1 domain, which binds to the host receptor, to investigate the kinetic profile of 32D6 binding to HA, the His-tagged Fab of 32D6 (with the C H 1 domain) and HA1 of A/California/07/2009 (residues 63-290) were each expressed in human Expi293F cells and were purified. Subsequently, using a Biacore T-200 system, the affinity of 32D6-Fab for the HA1 molecule was determined by measuring its binding kinetics through SPR. Single-cycle kinetics was used for the interaction analysis. 32D6-Fab binds to the HA1 protein with high affinity (Fig. 1e) . The dissociation constant (K D ) value for 32D6-Fab was measured as 3.528 × 10 −10 M, with an on-rate (k on ) of 2.585 × 10 5 M −1 S −1 and the off-rate (k off ) of 9.121 × 10 −5 S −1 . 32D6 recognizes clinically isolated H1N1 strain after 2009. Influenza A viruses usually underwent recombination and mutation after each pandemic occurrence, producing new strains with varied antigenic determinants. Because the original antigen of 32D6 was A/California/7/2009, several different clinical isolates of H1N1 strains before and after the 2009 pandemic were subsequently tested for neutralization activity. As shown in Fig. 2 , six clinical isolates before the pandemic all failed to be recognized by 32D6, whereas five isolates after the pandemic could all be neutralized by 32D6. The corresponding EC50 are listed in Table 1 . The EC50 of 32D6 (0.036 μg/mL) for strain A/Taiwan/80813/2013 is slightly higher than those for the four strains of A/ California/7/2009, which range from 0.005 to 0.014 μg/mL. Presumably, the isolates of the A/California/7/2009 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ strain are more closely related to one other (as well as 32D6) than A/Taiwan/80813/2013. Nevertheless, the distinct difference from the six isolates before the 2009 pandemic is very clear. Crystal structure of the 32D6-Fab/HA1 complex. To understand the mechanism by which the antibody 32D6 is capable of neutralizing a large number of H1 viruses, the above 32D6-Fab and HA1 were cocrystallized as a complex, and the structure was determined at 3.15-Å resolution ( Table 2 ). The crystals belong to space group P3 1 12 with four 32D6-Fab/HA1 complexes packed into an asymmetric unit (Fig. S1 ). In the complex structure, one Fab is bound to the top of each globular HA1 domain (Fig. 3a) . The model of the 32D6-Fab comprises the heavy chain (residues 1-230) and the light chain (residues 2-217). Together, they bind to the HA1 domain (residues 63-290). 32D6-Fab displays a typical immunoglobulin fold. The complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are well defined 11 ; the light-chain CDR loops are composed of residues 23-34 (CDR-L1), 47-53 (CDR-L2) and 93-100 (CDR-L3), and the CDRs of the heavy chain are composed of residues 26-37 (CDR-H1), 52-60 (CDR-H2) and 100-113 (CDR-H3) (Fig. 3b ). An influenza hemagglutinin contains 566 residues, with a transmembrane segment from residues 531 to 553 and six N-linked glycosylation sites at residues 28, 40, 104, 304, 498 and 557, as predicted by both the TMHMM (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM) and NetGlyc programs (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc). www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The HA1 domain contains three predicted glycosylation sites: residues 28, 40 and 104. In the 32D6-Fab complex structure, the glycosylated N104 with a monosaccharide is observed on a SDNGT sequon to stabilize the protein structure of HA1 domain, along with the glycan contact with the side chains of K71, N81, and R238 ( Fig. S2) 12 . Glycosylation at the residues N28 and N40 remain uncertain, whereas the other glycosylated residues 304, 498 and 557 were not included in the HA1 in this complex crystal. Notably, a calcium ion is bound to T249 in each HA1 (Fig. S2 ). The sites of glycosylation and calcium binding are separated from one another on the lateral surface of the HA1 molecule. Neither of them is likely to be involved in the interactions with the Fab. Based on the HA1 domain, superimposition of this complex onto an HA trimer model indicates that the 32D6-Fab is not blocked from binding to the HA1 domain in the trimer via the same mode as observed in the Figure 2 . 32D6 selectively recognizes H1N1 clinical isolates. MDCK cells were infected with indicated clinical isolated H1N1 influenza virus strains. After 16 hours, infected cells were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde then double stained by 32D6 (0.3 μg/mL) and FITC conjugated anti-influenza A NP antibody (0.67 μg/mL), followed by Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG. Nuclei were counterstained by DAPI (2 μg/mL). Signals were detected by high-content analysis system (10x). Blue = DAPI (nucleus); Green = anti-influenza A NP protein Ab-FITC; Red = 32D6 + mouse anti-human IgG-Fluor647. The genotype of each clinical isolate was listed in Table 1 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ crystal structure (Fig. 3a) . No steric hindrance is observed between the Fab and the other two HA1 domains. The interatomic distances between the Fab region and the other HA1 domains are all greater than 5 Å, and there appears to be no additional Fab-HA1 interaction of significance. However, again with steric hindrance consideration, if any other HA1 in an HA trimer is bound to another Fab, this second Fab would clash severely with the first one. Consequently, via the observed mode of binding, each HA trimer is likely to bind to only one Fab molecule using only one HA1 domain. Analysis of the 32D6-Fab/HA1 binding mode. The 32D6-binding site displays a conformational epitope located on the top surface of HA. The major region is composed of two discontinuous linear peptides (residues 172 to 177 and residues 206 to 213) form an abreast loop conformation, and the residues T262 between two loops to form a conformational epitope for 32D6 recognition. The paratope on 32D6 consists of all three heavy-chain CDRs and two light-chain CDRs (L-CDR1 and L-CDR3). L-CDR2 shows no interaction with the antigen. The heavy chain and the light chain have surface areas of 590 Å 2 buried upon the complex formation. Figure 3b shows the interface interactions between 32D6-Fab and the influenza virus HA. The side-chain hydroxyl groups from three tyrosine residues (Y35, Y102 and Y109) and the side-chain oxygen atom from T58 in the heavy-chain CDRs provide strong hydrogen bonds to interact with the residues N211, D213 and T262 on the HA molecule. Three water molecules were observed at the interface of HA and the heavy chain. They are consistently observed in all four complexes and show lower B values (41.4 Å 2 ) than average. Two of these water molecules are hydrogen-bonded to the Y102 side chain from the heavy chain and form hydrogen bonds with P176 and T262 on HA. Another water molecule was used to mediate the interaction between G107 in the heavy-chain CDR3 and N211 on HA. These water-mediated bonds provide important stabilizing force for the intermolecular interaction between the two proteins. The residues T58, Y102, I104, L105, T106, Y108 and Y109 in the heavy-chain CDRs exhibit nonpolar interaction with residues S174, P176, K177, Q210, N211, D213 and T262 of HA (Fig. 3c,d) . In light-chain CDRs, the residues A32, T94, W95, and D96 are hydrogen bonded to the residues N173, Q206 and Q210 in HA. The residues Y31, W95, D96 and A97 have hydrophobic contact with G172, N173 and Q206 in HA (Fig. 3c,d) .
