Structure probing of the RSV frameshift signal by primer extension Structure probing of the RSV frameshift region was performed initially within the context of a longer transcript using the primer extension approach (Ehresmann et al., 1987) . For this analysis, a 1.5 kb transcript containing the frameshift region was prepared by T7 transcription of plasmid pRSV1 cut with PvuII ( Figure 2 ). In the ®rst step, RNA was either untreated or subjected to limited RNase hydrolysis or chemical modi®cation using structure-speci®c probes. After stopping the reactions, the RNA was phenol:chloroform extracted and hybridised with oligonucleotides complementary to either RSV nucleotides 2692-2676, 2639-2623 or 2600-2584, which were used as primers for avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase. In order to determine the sites of cleavage/modi®cation produced by the various treatments, the labelled primer extension products were analysed on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels alongside size markers prepared by dideoxy sequencing of pRSV1/PvuII RNA using AMV reverse transcriptase. For each structure probe used, between ®ve and ten primer extension reactions were carried out with each primer and on at least three independent preparations of modi®ed RNA. A representative selection of the individual biochemical analyses are shown in Figure 3 (a), (b) and (c) along with a diagrammatic summary (Figure 3(d) ). The single-strand speci®c probes employed were: RNase T 1 , which cleaves internucleotide bonds 3 H of unpaired G residues; 2keto-3-ethoxybutyraldehyde (kethoxal), which reacts with unpaired G residues at N-1 and N-2; dimethyl sulphate (DMS), which methylates unpaired A at N-1 and unpaired C at N-3; diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC), which reacts with the N-7 group of unpaired A residues (and may also react with unpaired C and U under the conditions of pH and KCl concentration employed here; see Materials and Methods) and 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulphonate (CMCT), which modi®es the N-3 group of unpaired uridines and weakly, N-1 of unpaired guanine bases. To probe double-stranded regions, RNase V 1 was employed, which cleaves internucleotide bonds in helical regions. RNase V 1 is not base-speci®c but cleaves RNA that is in helical conformation, whether base-paired (a minimum of 4 ± 6 bp are required) or single-stranded and stacked. The picture that emerged from the biochemical probing data supports in general the stem- Figure 1 .
