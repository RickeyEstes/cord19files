First, it should be noticed that both samplers involved in all experimental runs demonstrated excellent inter-sampler variation with the discrepancy below 10% for vast majority of runs. On this basis, all following results represent average of two numbers obtained by two personal samplers operating in parallel in each experimental run. The results of measurements of the particle size distribution in the RAC are shown in Fig. 2 . The initial concentration of virus containing particles is quite common representing aerosol composition produced by Collison Nebulizer. It shows approximately 1:10 ratio of the viral particle to liquid carrier droplet sizes, which represents common environmental scenario where viruses usually travel of larger carriers in the air streams. Some shift of the curve obtained after 60 min of the process run at the temperature of 25°C and 79% RH towards smaller particle sizes indicates rather minor evaporation of the droplets at these air conditions. Much more significant changes were observed for the experiments undertaken at the temperature of 38°C and 24% RH. As is seen, a negligible amount of particles with the diameter of larger than 1.8 µm was observed. Vast majority of particles remained in the air after one hour experiment at these conditions were smaller than 0.7 µm. Fig. 3 demonstrates the results of determination of airborne live virus concentration (TCID 50 ) along with the numbers of total viruses obtained by RT-PCR at different time periods per millilitre of the sampler's collecting liquid. As is seen, the total number of viruses decreases significantly during first fifteen minutes of experiment and then becomes steady for the rest of the run with just minor decrease by about 0.25l g over 45 remaining minutes of the procedure. Similar trend was observed with live MERS-CoV virus at the 25°C and 79% RH experimental conditions; the major inactivation occurred over the first fifteen minus of the experiment. Then the inactivation rate became smaller with additional loss of about 0.5lg TCID 50 over the rest of the experiment. Much more significant inactivation was detected during experiments undertaken at 38°C and 24% RH. Over the first 15 min, the inactivation curve has a trend similar to the curve obtained for lower temperature scenario. However, it went steeply down during next 45 min loosing additional 1.5lg TCID 50 at the end of 60 min runs with almost no live particles remaining in the air (0.1lg TCID 50 /ml). The microbial relative inactivation estimated by Eq. (1) for both experimental conditions is shown in Fig. 4 . As is seen, both curves show similar trend only over the first 5 min of experiment. Then they depart from each other significantly reaching the O.V. Pyankov et al. Journal of Aerosol Science 115 (2018) 158-163 difference of around 60% at the end of 60 min run.
