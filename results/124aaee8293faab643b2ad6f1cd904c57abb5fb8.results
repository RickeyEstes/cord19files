In total, 43,819 titles/abstracts were identified during the literature search ( Figure 1 ). Of these, 584 met the inclusion criteria for full-text retrieval. Four of the included studies were not available, and 146 were included in the review. Most of the studies excluded did not meet the spatiotemporal criteria; 171 provided some spatiotemporal results but did not discuss this information as it was not the focus of the study. Others examined annual trends, were case studies or review papers, or focused on non-healthcare settings. Six studies were excluded for being written in a language other than English.
