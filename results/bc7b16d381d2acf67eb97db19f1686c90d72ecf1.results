To undertake screening of compounds for anti-DENV activity, two cell lines were selected, the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T/17, and the human hepatocellular cell line HepG2. Both cell lines are commonly used in analysis of DENV infection, although HET293T/17 cells do not represent a normal tissue involved in DENV infection. Five natural products (melatonin, α-tocopherol, folic acid, acetyl-l-carnitine and resveratrol) were selected for screening for possible anti-DENV 2 activity. All compounds were initially screened for cytotoxicity in both cell lines using the MTT assay. Cytotoxic effects were determined for both uninfected cells and DENV 2 infected cells in the range of 0.0001-10 mM (0.1-10,000 μM) for acetyl-l-carnitine, melatonin and α-tocopherol, and the range of 0.0001 mM (0.1-5000 μM) for folic acid and resveratrol, with treatment being undertaken for 24 h. Results showed little difference in cytotoxicity profiles of the compounds between DENV 2 infected and uninfected cells. Thus there was no cytotoxic synergism between the compounds and DENV infection. Melatonin (Fig. 1a, b) , α-tocopherol (Fig. 2a, b) and acetyl-l-carnitine (Additional file 1: Figure S1A , B) all showed evidence of cytotoxicity at compound concentrations of 10 mM. Folic acid (Additional file 2: Figure  S2A , B) and/or the vehicle showed a slight positive effect in both HEK293T/17and HepG2 cells at concentration of 1 mM, but this was not seen at a higher concentration. Cytotoxicity was observed for resveratrol at concentrations above 0.05 mM in HEK293T/17 cells, and above 1 mM in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3a, b) . Based on the cytotoxicity profiles, two concentrations were selected for each compound for assay of antiviral activity, which were 50 and 500 μM for acetyl-l-carnitine and melatonin, 0.5 and 1.0 mM for α-tocopherol, 0.1 and 0.5 mM for folic acid. For resveratrol which showed significant cell type variation in cytotoxicity, values of 25 and 50 μM were used for HEK293T/17 cells, and 50 and 100 μM were used for HepG2 cells. For all experiments, infections were undertaken at MOI 0.5 and 2 for HEK293T/17 cells and 2 and 5 for HepG2 cells due to different cell susceptibility to infection [12] .
