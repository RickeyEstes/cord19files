PLpro-TM inhibits STING/TBK1/IKKε-mediated activation of Type I interferon Subsequent to our previous report that SARS coronavirus PLpro negatively regulates IRF3-dependent innate immunity (Devaraj et al., 2007) , we determined to address whether SARS PLpro-TM blocks STING/TBK1/IKKε-mediated activation of Type I IFN. In this study, we assessed the level of STING/TBK1/IKKε-activated IFNβ-and IRF3-promoter activities in the presence of SARS PLpro-TM. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with PLpro-TM and a combination of plasmids encoding firefly luciferase under the control of IFNβ promoter (Fig. 1A , 1C and 1E) or IRF3 promoter of PRD(III-I)4 (Fig. 1B, 1D and 1F), and STING, TBK1, or IKKε as an activator of the IFNβ signaling pathway. We found that the stimulation of HEK-293T cells with STING alone increased the activity of IFNβ-and IRF3-promoter more than 20-fold. Co-expression of STING with SARS PLpro-TM resulted in a significant decrease in IFNβ-and IRF3-promoter activities, indicating that SARS PLpro-TM can antagonize STINGmediated activation of IFNβ-and IRF3-promoter activities ( Fig. 1A and 1B) . SARS PLpro-TM significantly inhibited IFNβ-and IRF3-promoter activities, which are activated by TBK1 ( Fig. 1C and 1D) and IKKε ( Fig. 1E and 1F ). These results indicate that SARS-CoV PLpro-TM antagonizes STING/TBK1/IKKε-mediated IFN-β transcription by interfering with the activation of IRF3 pathway.
