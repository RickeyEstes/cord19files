Sixty-nine EVD subjects were assessed; 95.5% (95% CI, 87.8e98.5) were weak on admission, 79.4% (95% CI, 68.4e87.3) had body aches on admission, 67.7% (95% CI, 55.9e77.6) were vomiting, 64% (95% CI, 52.85e75%) were The average age and weight of the CWB-group (44 subjects) were 28.4 (AE14.3) years and 66.6 (AE34) kg respectively; 21 were males and 23 were females. The mean age and weight of the Non-CWB group (25 subjects) were 33.6 (AE15.9) years and 55.8 (AE18.7) kg respectively; thirteen were males and twelve females. The CWB-group took an average of 1.97 AE 0.66 days after onset of symptoms before admission to the holding centre and another 1.61 AE 0.8 days before admission to the Ebola treatment unit (ETU). The Non-CWB group (25 subjects) took an average of 2.09 AE 0.9 days after onset of symptoms before admission to a holding centre and another 1.52 AE 0.5 days before admission to an ETU. Out of 44 subjects that were treated with CWB, 1 dropped out of the study and 31 recovered while 12 succumbed to the disease with a case fatality rate of 27.9%. For the control group that were given routine treatment without convalescent whole blood, 11 died with a case fatality rate of 44%. Patients treated with convalescent whole blood took an average of 10.6 AE 3.4 days to recover while the control patients that recovered took an average of 12.23 AE 4.8 days to recover. Recovery was marked by a gradual decrease in viral load during the treatment. The Ct values for 16 patients on CWB that recovered were recorded. Similarly, the Ct values of five Non-CWB patients were obtained on admission and 24 h after transfusion or admission. Ct values are inversely related to viral load such that lower Ct values mean higher viral load and vice versa. The average Ct value on admission was 23.37 AE 5.0 and the average 24 h after transfusion was 29.99 AE 5.9 (Table 1) . For the Non-CWB, the average Ct value on admission was 31.97 AE 8.4 and average Ct value after 24 h of admission was 31.25 AE 7.5 Similarly, Ct value for seven Non-CWB subjects that died and four subjects on convalescent blood that died were obtained. The average Ct value for Non-CWB patients that died was 23.69 AE 3.5 on admission and 22.98 AE 4.1 obtained 24 h after admission. For those on convalescent blood that died, the Ct value was 21.77 AE 4.9 on admission and 24.40 AE 5.4 obtained 24 h after transfusion ( Table 2 ). The median number of days to death was 4 days for the control group and it was five days for the treatment group. There was a significant difference between admission viral load and viral load after the first 24 h of treatment with convalescent whole blood (P < 0.01). The reduction in viral load was observable in subjects with convalescent blood than those in the Non-CWB group of the study. The odds ratio for survival with CWB was 2.3 (95% CI, 0.8e6.5) ( Table 3) . Patients were considered to have recovered after two negative PCR tests and lack of clinical signs of Ebola.
