A total of 481 HCWs were recruited into the study. Demographic characteristics of study participants are described in Table 1 . Of these, 369 (76·7%) were females; and 52% (252/481) of the participants were aged 535 years. The breakdown of participants by area was: respiratory ward 75 (16%); emergency department 72 (15%); respiratory clinic 16 (3·3%); paediatric department 15 (3·1%); infection fever clinic 6 (1·2%); and other wards 297 (62%). Of the 481 HCWs, 236 (49%) were doctors and 245 (51%) were nurses and others. During the study period, the uptake of influenza vaccine in HCWs was low in both 2007 and 2008 (19·3% and 18·1%, respectively). Fifty-six (11·6%) out of 481 HCWs performed at least one HRP during the study, with the most common activity being airway suctioning (66%, 37/56). Figure 2 shows the number of days on which a HCW reported performing a HRP. Thirty-four (61%) out of 56 HCWs, reported performing a HRP more than once during the study period. The aggregated number of days a HRP was performed was 264. In addition, HCWs on the respiratory ward (33%) were more likely to perform HRPs than those in the emergency department (16·7%). Nurses and other HCWs (16%, 39/245) were significantly more likely than doctors (7%, 17/236) to perform HRPs (P < 0·01). The weekly incidence of CRI was 18/1000 HCWs, for viral or bacterial infection, 16/1000; for any viral infection, 6/1000; and for influenza, 2·5/1000. HCWs who performed HRPs had a significantly higher risk of CRI [relative risk (RR) 2·5, 95% (CI) 1·3-6·5, P < 0·01) and laboratory-confirmed viral or bacterial infection (RR 2·6, 95% CI 1·4-5, P < 0·01) than those who did not perform HRPs (Table 2) . By Poisson regression analysis, adjusting for other variables, only HRPs determined the risk of an infection outcome, as shown in Tables 3-5. The relative risk for CRI in HCWs who performed a HRP was 2·9 (95% CI 1·42-5·87, P < 0·01) ( Table 3 ). The RR for a laboratory-confirmed pathogen (viral or bacterial) in symptomatic HCWs was 2·9 (95% CI 1·37-6·22, P = 0·01), in those who performed a HRP (Table 4 ). For the outcome of any respiratory viral pathogen, the RR was 3·3 (95% CI 1·01-11·02, P = 0·05) ( Table 5 ). Hand washing, influenza vaccination and use of surgical or cloth face masks did not affect the risk of infection outcomes. We also tested for other variables, e.g. number of hours worked, number of patients the HCW was in contact with during the study period, and number of contacts with patients with ILI; however, none of these had a significant association with infection outcomes. There were no significant association between laboratory-confirmed influenza and HRPs (data not shown); but the numbers of influenza-positive cases were low (six cases) in the study.
