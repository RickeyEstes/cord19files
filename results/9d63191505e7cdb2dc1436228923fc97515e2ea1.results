Viral load and histopathology. All the NIBV-infected chickens in the IIBV group were listless, huddled together, had watery faeces, and displayed ruffled feathers (score = 2, according to the methods described by Avellaneda et al. 24 ) from 3 to 9 days post-inoculation (dpi), and the morbidity was higher than 90%. These clinical symptoms were not observed in the INC group. The quantification of the viral load by RT-qPCR showed values ranging from 2.96 × 10 3 to 3.84 × 10 8 genomic copies per 0.2 μg of RNA, with the lowest viral load in the jejuna and the highest in the kidneys (Fig. 1B) . It was noted that the viral load in the ilea was much higher than that in the jejuna, reaching 1.39 × 10 5 genomic copies per 0.2 μg of RNA. No viral RNA was detected in the INC group. There were more goblet cells, which appeared as vacuoles when stained by H&E, in the IIBV group than in the INC group (Fig. 1C , red arrow). In addition, there were many shed villus epithelial tissue that appeared in the ilea of the IIBV group (Fig. 1C , black arrow). Among the ilea, there was no significant difference in villus height (Student's t test, P = 0.094, Fig. 1D ), but crypt depth was significantly increased (Student's t test, P = 0.0003, Fig. 1E ), and the V/C ratio was significantly decreased (Student's t test, P = 0.016, Fig. 1F ). Description of the sequencing data. After two separate runs on an Illumina HiSeq. 2500 platform and quality-filtering as described in the methods, 698,855 total sequences were identified for further analysis. The rarefaction curves (Fig. 2a) showed that the sequencing depth was near saturation and that the sequencing data included most of the 16S rRNA gene information in the samples. A decrease in the microbial diversity in the ilea of chickens with NIBV infection. The sample community richness was evaluated based on the operational taxonomic units (OTU) 25 counts in each single sample as shown in Table 1 . As shown by the OTU counts, the number of OTUs in the ilea of the IIBV group chickens was less than that of the INC group chickens (Fig. 2b) . According to the lower ACE and Chao1 indices, NIBV infection reduced the community richness compared to that in the INC group (Table 1 ). In addition, neither the Shannon nor the Simpson indices were significantly different between the IIBV group and the INC group within the experiment (Wilcox, P = 0.5887 and P = 0.9372, respectively). The higher Shannon and Simpson index indicated a higher bacterial diversity, which meant that the NIBV infection decreased the microbial diversity compared to that in the INC group (Fig. 2c,d) . In conclusion, these data indicated a smaller bacterial diversity in the ileal microbiota of NIBV infected chickens.
