which, when translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, produces a 45,909 Da product corresponding to ribosomes that terminate at the la termination codon within the la/lb overlap region, and a 95,990 Da (-1) frameshift product corresponding to a PBl (5')-la-lb-PBl-(3') fusion protein. (b) Reticulocyte lysate translation products synthesized in response to mRNA derived from SmaI-digested pFS8. The RNA was translated and products were labelled with [35S]methionine as described in Materials and Methods. Polypeptides were separated on an SDS/lOO/o polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. frameshift process was to create defined mutations within the structure and to assess the effect of these changes on the efficiency of frameshifting in a cellfree translation system. The frameshift assay shown in Figure 2 was almost exactly as described (Brierley et al., 1989) , except that synthetic mRNAs were generated using bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. Plasmid pFS8 has a 230 bp cDNA region derived from the IBV la/lb overlap region (and containing the essential 86 nucleotides) cloned within a reporter gene (PBl of influenza virus A/PR8/34) which, in turn, is flanked by the 5' and 3' non-coding regions of the Xenopus fi-globin gene (Krieg & Melton, 1984) downstream from a T7 promoter. Linearization of the plasmid with SmaI followed by transcription results in the production of a capped and polyadenylated 2.8 kb mRNA designed such that on translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, ribosomes which terminate at the la ORF stop codon produce a 45,000 Da product (the "stopped" product) and those that frameshift, a 95,000 Da product (Brierley et al., 1989) . In our analysis of the pseudoknot, we selected four particular features for study; the stems, the nucleotides where the stems are thought to stack, the G7-A24 mismatched pair and the loops (see Fig. l (b) and Fig. 3 ). We first examined the effect on frameshifting of disrupting and reforming the basepaired regions within Sl and 52 predicted by our model (Fig. l(b) ) and the results of these changes are shown in Figure 3 (a). For each region studied, our strategy was to change the nucleotides of each strand of the predicted base-paired regions to their complementary nucleotides in separate constructs, and then to create double-mutant, pseudo-wild-type constructs in which both changes are made and so should be compensatory. We also introduced a number of additional point mutations into the stems, and these are shown in Figure 4 . In the main, the results of the stem analysis support strongly the idea that the overall stability of each of the pseudoknot stems is related to its ability to promote frameshifting. As can be seen in Figure 3 , all the complementary changes predicted to destabilize the stems reduced or abolished frameshifting. In the double-mutant, pseudo-wild-type constructs, in which the stems are predicted to be restabilized, frameshifting was restored to high levels (15 to 30%) in all cases. Consistent with the importance of stem-stability to the frameshift process is the observation that the efficiency of frameshifting was less dramatically reduced (to about 15%) in mIcEID Em 6.62 6.57 6.61 less; (+) 10 to 20%; (+ +) wild-type (25 to 30%). The shaded nucleotides in the stems represent the 2 blocks of nucleotides that were tested by this method and shown to be base-paired in a previous analysis (Brierley et aE., 1989) . 95 l kDa* 45 kDa* constructs where the substitutions were at the very ends of the Sl helix (pFS8.32: 856, Fig. 3(a) ). These changes would be expected to destabilize the structure only slightly and this is supported by estimations of the expected change in free energy upon formation of the mutant structures compared to that of the wild-type structure using the base-pair stacking rules of Turner et al. (1988) . As it is not possible to apply these rules to pseudoknots as a whole (since the contribution of the loops and the stacking of 52 upon Sl to the free energy of formation of the pseudoknot is not known), we considered only the Sl stem-loop structure in isolation. The changes in free energy calculated were -12.4 kcal mol-' for wild-type Sl, -11.4 kcal mol-' for Sl in pFS8.32 (Gl-G30 at the base of Sl) and -196 kcal mol-' for Sl in pFS8.56 (Cl-C30 at the base of Sl). More central changes, which are expected to be highly destabilizing, greatly reduced frameshifting. This was particularly apparent when G. C base-pairs were changed (pFS8.11: 8.15, 8.31, %33 and 8.52 in Sl; pFS8.50: 857, 8.61 and &63 in 52) where the frameshift efficiency was 2% or less. Changes in A. U base-pairs were also inhibitory, although in the examples studied, less dramatic in Sl (pFS8.49, 10%) than in S2 (pFS8.53, lo/). Calculations of the predicted stability of Sl in the more central Sl mutants using the Turner rules support the hypothesis that in these mutants, Sl is considerably less stable. The changes in free energy calculated were -8 kcal mol-' (8.11 and 8*15), -5.8 kcal mol-' (8.31 and 8.33) and -8.4 kcal mol-' (8.49). A point mutation analysis of the mismatched G7-A24 pair in Sl (Fig. 4) tity of nucleotides at this position of the pseudoknot is not critical, In a construct in which the G7-A24 mismatched pair was changed to unpaired G7-G24 (pFS8.21), frameshifting was unaffected. In other constructs where base-pairing was promoted, frameshifting was at slightly greater than the wild-type level (35%) (pFS8.30: U7. A24; pFS8.38: G7. C34). Thus, forming a canonical Watson-Crick base-pair actually improves the frameshift process and this seems once again to be related to an increase in the overall stability of Sl. Calculations of the predicted stability of Sl in these mutants using the Turner rules support this increase in stability (pFS8.30: -164 kcal mall'; pFS8.38: -18.3 kcal mall'). The final feature studied in the stem analysis concerned the nucleotides at the junction where Sl and S2 are thought to stack coaxially. Such an arrangement of stems is strongly suggested from models of the pseudoknots in plant viral tRNA-like structures, and is one of the central features of the pseudoknot building principle (Pleij et al., 1985) . The results of a mutational analysis of the "stacking region" of the IBV pseudoknot are shown in Figure  5 . We expected that the introduction of a mismatched nucleotide pair at the top of Sl or bottom of S2 would destabilize the pseudoknot and inhibit frameshifting, since the stacking of 52 upon Sl in such mutants would be energetically less favourable. Thus, when we changed G20 to C20 (pFS8.10) such that the predicted Ull .G20 basepair at the top of Sl would be replaced by unpaired Ull-C20, we were surprised to find that frameshifting was still efficient (15%). This result could be explained by suggesting that in this mutant, Ul 1 may be displaced into loop 1 and replaced by G62 from loop 2 such that a new G62. C20 base-pair could form at the junction between Sl and 52 ( Fig. 5(a) ). In order to test this possibility, G62 was changed to C62 in a pFS8.10 background (to create pFS8.34) such that we could be confident that only mismatched base-pairs were present at' the top of Sl (either Ull-C20, or C62-C20 if Ull is displaced). Once again, this mutant displayed efficient frameshifting (15%). A similar etliciency was seen in pFS8.39, in which Ull was replaced by Gil such that an unmatched Gll-G20 pair was present at' the top of Sl (Fig. 5(b) ). Thus, a standard base-pair at t'he top of Sl is not absolutely required. It appears, however, that base-pairing at this location can contribute to frameshifting, albeit to a limited extent. In pFS8.40, we replaced Ull by Cl1 such that a standard Cl 1 *G20 pair would be present; in this construct the frameshift efficiency was, if anything, slightly better (30 to 35%) than that seen with the wild-type structure. A second piece of evidence comes from the analysis of a double mutant, pFS8.14. In pFS8.13, a Ull to All transversion at the top of Sl had little effect upon frameshifting, but in combination with an adjacent GlO to Cl0 change (pFS8.14), frameshifting was abolished. As the GlO to Cl0 change in isolation produces a mutant (pFS8.15) in which a frameshift product can still be detected, it seems that the Ul 1. G20 base-pair does provide some stabilization ( Fig. 5(b) ). The observation of a wild-type frameshift in pFS8.13 (All and G20 at the top of Sl), however, indicates that the level of frameshifting seen in mutants created at, the top of Sl may, perhaps, not be determined simply by the presence or absence of a base-pair at this position. This possibility is supported by our analysis of the contribution of the C63. G19 frameshift process (Fig. 5(c) ). In pFS8.46, a point correlation of frameshift efficiency with base-pair mutation that created unpaired G63-G19 at this formation at the stacking region is not fully underposition reduced the frameshift efficiency by half to stood, but may be related to the possibility that the about, 15'&, a level similar to that seen with the structure of the RNA in this region of the pseudoequivalent change at the top of Sl (Gil-G20, knot is unusual. The n.m.r. analysis of a short pFS8.39). In a mutant in which the corresponding synthetic RNA pseudoknot performed by Puglisi et C63-Cl9 mismatch was created (pF8.54), frameal. (1990) revealed that although the two pseushifting was unaffected (30%), yet surprisingly, in a doknot stems did, indeed, stack, the A-form pseudo-wild-type double mutant (G63.Cl9, geometry of the RNA helix was distorted at the pFS8.59), frameshifting was once again reduced (to junction of the loops and the stacked stems. Thus, 15%). This was an unexpected observation, since in the biological effect of point mutations which the analysis of the Ull and G20 pair at the top of influence the particular bases at this region (parti-Sl, wild-t,ype frameshifting was seen with all the cularly, in the case of the IBV pseudoknot, Ull and constructs in which the bases at this position were C63) probably cannot be interpreted simply on the paired and raised the possibility that there may be a basis of the ability to form base-pairs. Clearly, more specific requirement for the C63 nucleotide at the detailed information on the three-dimensional strucbottom of 52. However, in an additional mutant ture of the stacking region of the IBV pseudoknot is (pFS8.67) in which C63 was changed to A63 to needed before the effects of changes in this region create unpaired A63-G19, frameshifting was at the can be fully interpreted. Nevertheless, the finding wild-type level. The apparent inconsistencies in the that preventing base-pair format,ion in the stacking region had only a limited effect on the frameshift process raised the possibility that direct stacking of the two stems was not an essential requirement of the process, To investigate this, we sought to separate Sl and 52 by inserting three nucleotides between G20 of Sl and G19 of 52 (pFS8.60: AAA insertion) such that stacking could only occur if this insertion was looped out of the helix (Fig. 5(d) ). In order to rule out the possibility that the two nucleotides of loop 1 were insufficient to span the increased distance between the two helices, the insertion was also introduced into a variant construct (pFS8.23) in which a three nucleotide insertion (AAA insertion) had previously been made in Ll (and shown to be functional: see Fig. 6 , pseudoknot loop analysis) to create pFS8.66. As can be seen in Figure 5 AAA insertion between Sl and 52 reduced the efficiency of frameshifting in both pFS8.66 (wild-type background, 1%) and pFS8.66 (pFS8.23 background, 5%) supporting the view that "intact" individual stems are not sufficient for high efficiency frameshifting, and that Sl and S2 need be in close proximity.
