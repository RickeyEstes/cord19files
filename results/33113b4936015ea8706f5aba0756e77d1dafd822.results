The mean (Ϯ SD) age of the 13 patients was 41 Ϯ 20 years (Table) ; 11 were women and 6 were health care workers. Clinical features included fever, upper respiratory tract symptoms, myalgia, normal leukocyte counts, and lymphopenia. Only 5 patients had an initial diagnosis of possible SARS and were promptly referred to the national SARS hospital. Because of a lack of fever at presentation, patients 6 and 10 were not diagnosed with SARS initially despite positive contact histories. The remaining patients were not recognized as having contact histories because their index cases had not been diagnosed with SARS at the time or because of a strict adherence to the WHO definition of direct contact. Five patients died. Two patients transmitted SARS while in the emergency department. The first patient (patient 8) was a 63-yearold man who presented with dizziness and dyspnea on April 8. He was afebrile and had atrial fibrillation. A chest radiograph showed bilateral lower-zone opacities. He had spent almost 4 hours before admittance to a general medical (nonisolation) ward for heart failure. It was later discovered that his brother whom he had visited at another hospital was the then-unrecognized index case for a number of infections there. Patient 8 had been cared for in gurney 19 of the intermediate care area (Figure) . He was neither placed in isolation nor given a mask because his admitting diagnosis was heart failure. A visitor to the patient in gurney 18 was infected with SARS, with onset of symptoms on April 13. Eight other patients were in the intermediate care area during this period. The patient in gurney 8 developed SARS symptoms on April 14, and the patient in gurney 11, on April 18; no other source could be identified for their infections. The remaining 6 patients had no evidence of SARS on extended follow-up. Patient 8 was also the source of infection for 4 health care workers from the inpatient unit (patients 9, 10, 11, and 13). He was transferred to the national SARS hospital where he died 3 days later. The second patient (patient 4) who transmitted SARS in the emergency department was a 43-year-old woman who presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea on March 24. A visitor to the ambulatory waiting area, where patient 4 had waited for 2 hours prior to examination, developed SARS 5 days later. Patient 4 was admitted with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia and was not isolated as she had marked leukocytosis and had no close contact (as defined by the WHO criteria) with SARS patients. She had also waited for 2 hours in gurney 8 of the intermediate care area (Figure) before admission; no patients were infected during this time. She was, however, the source of infection for her son and the intensivist who performed a bronchoscopy on her. She died 8 days after admission. A total of 105 emergency department staff at our hospital have had their temperature monitored, initially three times a day until late August 2003, and now twice daily. Eleven staff members had blood counts and radiographs taken, all for low-grade fevers, and only 1 person was found to have evidence of SARS much later when serologic testing became available. She had a mild febrile illness and there were no changes on five serial chest radiographs.
