This study does not attempt to quantify the effect of SARS on patient outcomes or missed follow-up appointments. It is possible that these patients experienced poor pain control or decreased quality of life as a result of delayed or deferred RT, but it is also conceivable that their pain may have been medically controlled until RT became more accessible. Twentyeight patients were excluded from the study because of missing data. Information on primary tumor site and reason for referral was unavailable for 7% and 5% of patients, respectively. From January to May 2002 and 2003, a total of 649 patients were scheduled to attend the RRRP clinic; 519 patients were treated with palliative RT. Patients' primary tumor site and reason for referral for each time period are reported in Table  1 . Multiple comparisons among all 4 groups showed no significant difference in the median age of patients, number of patients seen, or number of patients receiving RT. There was a significant increase in the proportion of missed or cancelled visits during the period of SARS incidence compared with the same dates during the previous year (5% vs. 1%; P = 0.049). There was a decrease in the proportion of follow-up visits during the SARS epidemic ( Figure 1 ), but this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.054).
