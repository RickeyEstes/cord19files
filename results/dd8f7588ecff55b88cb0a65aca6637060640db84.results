Fifty-one (48 ascitic and 3 pleuric fluids) of the 61 tested samples had FCoV antibody (Table 2 and Fig. 1 ), although only 37 positive effusions contained antibody levels ≥ 1:1600, which are considered highly suggestive of FIP diagnosis (Hartmann et al., 2003) . Additional 13 samples presented FCoV antibody titres between 1:200 and 1:800, which are quite high for an enteric infection but cannot be considered enough high for a systemic infection. Only one effusion had an antibody titre of 1:100 and two samples displayed an antibody titre of 1:51,200. By means of qRT-PCR, FCoV RNA was detected in a total of 52 samples (49 ascitic and 3 pleuric fluids). C T values were generally above 30 (mean C T value of 32.87), accounting for low viral titres, with higher viral RNA loads (C T values < 30) being detected in only 11 effusions. By comparing the results qRT-PCR with those of IIF assay using an antibody titre ≥ 1:1600 as cut-off (Fig. 1B) , 6 samples tested negative by both assays (no viral RNA and no FCoV antibodies), possibly accounting for diseases other than FIP, and 3 samples tested negative only by qRT-PCR, although they contained FCoV antibody titres between 1:3200 and 1:12,800, which were highly suggestive of FIP. Eighteen effusions were found to contain FCoV RNA in the absence of specific antibodies (or at least in the presence of antibody titres < 1:1600); 5 of these qRT-PCR positive specimens had no FCoV antibodies (or at least antibody titres < 1:100), while additional 13 effusions contained antibody titres ranging from 1:100 to 1:800, which are not considered as suggestive of FIP. Therefore, based only on antibody detection, a total of 18 cats whose effusions contained viral RNA were predicted not to be affected by FIP, while taking advantage on molecular detection of FCoV RNA, 3 animals with high antibody titres would have been considered FIP negative. Unfortunately, samples with FCoV RNA tested negative by IIF even after treatment with the chaotropic thiocyanate ion, which had been proven to dissociate immune complexes Pullen et al., 1986. Most effusions displaying the highest viral loads (C T values < 30) contained antibody titres ≥ 1:1600; only one sample with a low C T value displayed an antibody titre (1:200) not suggestive of FIP (Table 2) . Therefore, qRT-PCR positive samples with low antibody titres mostly contained low FCoV RNA loads, although the highest antibody titres were detected in effusions with C T values > 30. Overall, no statistically significant correlation (R = 0.1178; twotailed P-value = 0.36576) was found between viral RNA loads and antibody titres.
