Construction of large combinatorial DNA and cDNA antibody libraries We prepared the gDNAs from the PBMCs of 300 uninfected healthy donors and amplified the heavy chain variable regions and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions by semi-nested PCR using pooled gDNA as a template and a set of primers that annealed to the leader sequence or framework 1 (FR1) or FR4 of each heavy chain or kappa and lambda light chain gene family (Table S1 , http://links.lww.com/QAD/A401). The heavy chain variable regions and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions were then covalently linked by a flexible (G4S)3 linker by strand overlap extension (SOE)-PCR to assemble scFvs. The resultant combinatorial gDNA scFv library, including two sublibraries, designated NIgH/gK and NIgH/gL, in pComb3X contained over 600 million individual clones. Similarly, we constructed three immune gDNA scFv libraries using the gDNAs isolated from pt1, pt2 and pt3. Each immune gDNA scFv library had kappa and lambda sublibraries except that pt1 lambda sublibrary was omitted. Five sublibraries were designated pt1gH/gK, pt2gH/gK, pt2gH/gL, pt3gH/gK and pt3gH/gL, and each sublibrary contained one to six billion individual clones. We simultaneously constructed corresponding combinatorial cDNA antibody Fab libraries except that construction of a cDNA Fab library using pt1 PBMCs was omitted because the isolation of bnmAbs by single cell sorting of memory B-cells from pt1 PBMCs has been reported [18, 28] . The resultant nonimmune and immune cDNA Fab kappa and lambda sublibraries were designated NIH/NIK and NIH/NIL, pt2H/pt2K and pt2H/pt2L, and pt3H/pt3K and pt3H/pt3L, respectively. Each sublibrary contained 1-6 billion individual clones. More diverse heavy chain V-gene lineage usage in the genomic DNA libraries than in the cDNA libraries We amplified the scFvs from the gDNA libraries and the Fds and light chains from the cDNA libraries using primers that annealed to the pComb3X vector or to the constant regions of heavy or light chains (CH1 and CL, respectively) (Table S1 and S2, http://links.lww. com/QAD/A401) and sent the PCR products for deep sequencing. We obtained trim sequences (>290 nt) from each library ranging from 23 530 to 88 331 for heavy chain variable regions, and from 17 285 to 28 110 for kappa light chain variable regions and from 21 480 to 30 199 for lambda light chain variable regions.

The gDNA libraries were more diverse overall than the cDNA libraries in using various IGHV lineages (Figs 1 and 2) . Among the four gDNA heavy chain libraries, NIgH and pt1gH showed a similar pattern of various IGHV lineage usage, whereas pt2gH and pt3gH were significantly different from NIgH and pt1gH in using IGHV1, IGHV2 and IGHV6 lineages (Figs 1 and 2) . Compared with the gDNA heavy chain libraries, the corresponding cDNA heavy chain libraries had significantly higher percentages of clones using IGHV1 and IGHV3 lineages (Fig. 1) , and were biased to certain VH1 and VH3 subfamilies, including IGHV1-18, 1-2 and 1-69, and IGHV 3-11, 3-21, 3-23, 3-30, 3-33, 3-49, 3-7 and 3-74 (Fig. 2) . The patterns of various IGKV/IGLV lineage usages in the nonimmune and immune gDNA libraries were similar except for pt1gK library (Figs 1 and 3) . The nonimmune and immune cDNA libraries also showed a similar pattern in using various IGKV/IGLV lineages. Both nonimmune and immune cDNA antibody libraries heavily used IGKV3 and IGLV1 lineages (Figs 1 and 3) . These results indicate that HIV-1 infection shapes the patterns of various IGHV lineage usages, but the caused changes at the cDNA level are much less significant compared with the changes at the gDNA level. The differences between the gDNA and cDNA antibody gene repertoires in HIV-1 uninfected (nonimmune) humans reflect host immune regulations, and such regulations may largely determine the host-dependent immune response to HIV-1 infection. Extremely low frequency of the heavy chain variable regions and kappa/lambda light chain variable regions with identical V(D)J recombinations to known HIV-1 bnmAbs To investigate the potential of basal human antibody gene repertoires to develop HIV-1 bnAbs, we analysed the trim heavy chain variable region sequences and counted the number of heavy chain variable regions that had identical putative VDJ recombinations to five known CD4 binding site bnmAbs b12, VRC01, VRC03, NIH45-46 and 3BNC60, and two glycan and loopspecific bnmAbs PG9 and pGT127. To our surprise, we found that the frequencies of the heavy chain variable regions with identical putative VDJ recombinations to these known HIV-1 bnmAbs in both nonimmune and immune gDNA and cDNA libraries were extremely low (Table 1) . We did not find any heavy chain variable regions that had identical VDJ recombinations compared with the known bnmAbs in the nonimmune and three immune gDNA libraries (Table 1) . We found a total of five, 10 and two productive heavy chain variable regions (with in-frame junctions) in the cDNA libraries with exactly the same putative VDJ recombinations as VRC01, VRC03 and NIH45-46, respectively (Table 1) . However, their junction regions and the length of the HCDR3s were very different compared with the respective bnmAbs (data not shown), suggesting the unlikelihood for them to mature to VRC01-like bnAbs. We did a similar search for heavy chain variable regions that had identical VDJ recombinations to a nonneutralizing or weakly neutralizing CD4-induced (CD4i) mAb X5 and a bnmAb against SARS-CoV, m396 [31, 32] . We found four productive heavy chain variable regions in two immune gDNA libraries (1 in pt2gH and 3 in pt3gH) and a total of 28 productive heavy chain variable regions in the cDNA libraries (12 in NIH, 2 in pt2H and 14 in pt3H) that had identical putative VDJ recombinations to X5, but all these heavy chain variable regions had a shorter HCDR3 than that of X5 (24 amino acids, AA). We found one heavy chain variable region in pt1gH library and one heavy chain variable region in NIH library that had exactly the same putative VDJ recombination as IGHV1-18  IGHV1-2  IGHV1-24  IGHV1-3  IGHV1-45  IGHV1-46  IGHV1-58  IGHV1-69  IGHV1-8  IGHV1-c  IGHV1-f  IGHV1-NL1  IGHV2-10  IGHV2-26  IGHV2-5  IGHV2-70  IGHV3-11  IGHV3-13  IGHV3-15  IGHV3-16  IGHV3-19  IGHV3-20  IGHV3-21  IGHV3-22  IGHV3-23  IGHV3-25  IGHV3-30  IGHV3-30-3  IGHV3-33  IGHV3-35  IGHV3-38  IGHV3-43  IGHV3-47  IGHV3-48  IGHV3-49  IGHV3-52  IGHV3-53  IGHV3-54  IGHV3-62  IGHV3-64  IGHV3-66  IGHV3-7  IGHV3-71  IGHV3-72  IGHV3-73  IGHV3-74  IGHV3-9  IGHV3-d  IGHV3-h  IGHV3-NL1  IGHV4- IGKV1-12  IGKV1-13  IGKV1-16  IGKV1-17  IGKV1-27  IGKV1-33  IGKV1-37  IGKV1-39  IGKV1-5  IGKV1-6  IGKV1-8  IGKV1-9  IGKV1…  IGKV1…  IGKV1…  IGKV1…  IGKV1…  IGKV1…  IGKV1-…  IGKV2-18  IGKV2-24  IGKV2-28  IGKV2-29  IGKV2-30  IGKV2-4  IGKV2-40  IGKV2…  IGKV2…  IGKV2…  IGKV2…  IGKV3-11  IGKV3-15  IGKV3-20  IGKV3-7  IGKV3…  IGKV3…  IGKV3…  IGKV3…  IGKV3-…  IGKV3-…  IGKV3-…  IGKV3-…  IGKV3-…  IGKV4-1  IGKV5-2  IGKV6-21  IGKV6…  IGKV7-3   NIgK   pt1gK   pt2gK   pt3gK   0   5   10   15   20   25   30   35   40   IGKV1-12  IGKV1-13  IGKV1-16  IGKV1-17  IGKV1-27  IGKV1-33  IGKV1-37  IGKV1-39  IGKV1-5  IGKV1-6  IGKV1-8  IGKV1-9  IGKV1…  IGKV1…  IGKV1…  IGKV1…  IGKV1…  IGKV1…  IGKV1-…  IGKV2-18  IGKV2-24  IGKV2-28  IGKV2-29  IGKV2-30  IGKV2-4  IGKV2-40  IGKV2…  IGKV2…  IGKV2…  IGKV2…  IGKV3-11  IGKV3-15  IGKV3-20  IGKV3-7  IGKV3…  IGKV3…  IGKV3…  IGKV3…  IGKV3- m396, but none of them had the same HCDR3 length as that of m396 (11 amino acids). These results indicate that the chance of having a heavy chain variable region with a defined VDJ recombination along with a specific HCDR3 length could be extremely low in human antibody gene repertoires. The frequencies of the kappa light chain variable regions that had the identical VJ recombinations to the known HIV-1 bnmAbs in both nonimmune and immune gDNA and cDNA libraries were also very low except that the frequencies of the kappa light chain variable regions with the identical VJ recombination to b12 kappa light chain variable region (IGKV3-20/IGKJ2) were relatively high (Table 1) . X5 used the same VJ recombination as b12, so the frequencies of the kappa light chain variable regions with identical VJ recombination to X5 were also relatively high. Interestingly, we found that the frequencies of the lambda light chain variable regions with the identical VJ recombinations to bnmAbs PG9 and PGT127 were also relatively high, whereas the frequencies of the kappa light chain variable regions with the identical VJ recombination to m396 were very low (Table 1) . Relatively high frequencies of heavy and kappa/ lambda light chain variable regions that used the same or very similar heavy chain genes and kappa/lambda light chain V-genes and had the same length of CDR3s as known HIV-1 bnmAbs regardless of (D)J-gene usage It is usually difficult to determine which D-gene and J-gene were recombined with the V-genes to generate heavy chain variable regions, owing to the complexity of VDJ recombination events. Therefore, we searched for productive heavy chain variable regions that used the same or very similar IGHVs and had the same length of HCDR3 as known HIV-1 bnmAbs regardless of D-gene and J-gene usage. The frequencies of such heavy chain variables were relatively high in the nonimmune and immune gDNA and cDNA libraries than the frequencies of the heavy chain variable regions with exactly the same VDJ recombinations of known HIV-1 bnmAbs except for VRC03, PG9 and PGT127 that had long HCDR3s (23, 30 and 25 amino acids, respectively) ( Table 2) . X5 also had a long HCDR3 (24 amino acids), so the frequencies of the heavy chain variable regions that used the same or very similar IGHV of X5 and had the same HCDR3 length were not higher than the frequencies of the heavy chain variable regions with exactly the same VDJ recombinations of X5. Similar analysis of trim kappa/lambda light chain variable regions also showed relatively high frequencies of the VKs/VLs that used the same or very similar IGKVs/IGLVs and had the same length of CDR3 as known HIV-1 bnmAbs regardless of J-gene usage, especially for b12, PG9 and PGT127 (Table 2 ).
