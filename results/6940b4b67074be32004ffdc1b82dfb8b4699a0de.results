Seventy-nine patients with acute exacerbations of asthma who were hospitalized in the respiratory medical unit and 54 control subjects were recruited. In the study period, 155 adults were admitted to the hospital with acute exacerbation of asthma-ll8 to the respiratory medical unit and 37 to other medical units of the hospital. We chose to recruit only patients admitted to the respiratory medical unit because the patients admitted with asthma to other medical units also had evidence of other major medical illnesses that may have confounded our results. The 49 patients admitted to the respiratory medical unit and not recruited to trial were missed predominantly because of logistic reasons rather than refusal to enter the study. The major reasons for asthma patient nonrecruitment to the trial was admission to hospital over weekends and a 2-week period in April1994 when the physicians conducting the trial were on leave. Nonrecruitment into the trial was not related to season. The demographic characteristics of the patient and control groups are given in Table l . The monthly patient admission numbers to the hospital and trial are shown in Figure l. Peak patient admissions to hospital occurred in late winter, all of spring, and early summer with less patient admissions occurring in late summer and autumn. Twenty-nine patients (37%) had evidence of recent RTI compared with five of the control group (9%) (p<0.001) . Twenty-three patients (29%) had evidence of recent viral infection, predominantly influenza A and rhinoviruses, on serologic and/or NPA culture criteria ( Table 2) . Thirteen of the patients had evidence of recent influenza A infection, two had evidence of recent influenza B infection, and nine had evidence of recent rhinovirus infection. Five of the patients had evidence of more than one viral infection ( Table 2 ). There was a peak of influenza in the late winter and early spring period whereas rhinovirus infection occurred predominantly in early winter. Three patients with either DISCUSSION We have found evidence of recent RTI in 37% of adult patients admitted to hospital to the respiratory medical unit over a 12-month period with acute exacerbation of asthma. This is in contrast to early previous studies in which 10 to 21% of adult asthmatics have been found to have RTI present at time of acute exacerbations. 15 Indeed, Tarlo et al 1 6 in 1979 did not find an association between RTI and asthma exacerbation in adults. It has long been postulated that many asthma exacerbations are precipitated by RTI. In children it has been shown that asthma exacerbation is associated with respiratory tract infection in up to 45% of cases, though RTI is present in between 50% and 60% of asthmatic children studied without asthma exacerbation. 5 In the same study, 24% of children hospitalized with asthma had evidence of recent viral infection. Horn et alP however, found 50% of children with acute asthma exacerbation had evidence of rhinovirus infection in sputum. The higher rate of RTI in children with asthma exacerbation compared with adults has been thought to be partly due to the delayed presentation of adults for management and the more rapid clearing of viruses which often occurs in adults, leading to increased difficulty in isolation of viruses in adults. .. Older studies had difficulty in isolating rhinovirus and coronavirus infection and although we tried to culture for coronaviruses on NPA, we did not find infection with this organism, perhaps because of its fastidious nature. Our study has identified only one patient with evidence of recent Mycoplasma infection. As Mycoplasma infections occur in epidemics, this suggests that little Mycoplasma had occurred in the community during the patient recruitment period. We found that 11% of our patients had rhinovirus cultured from NPA and by combining NPA culture and viral serology, we also found an incidence of 19% influenza A or B infection in our patients. Our results for viral RTI associated with acute asthma exacerbation are lower than those of Nicholson et al 9 who prospectively studied 138 adult outpatient asthmatics. They found an incidence of 44% of nonbacterial pathogens in what they termed severe asthma episodes (mean decrease of PEFR > 100 Umin). They also found that 24% of laboratory-confirmed RTI were associated with mean decrease of PEFR :::::50 Umin on days 1 to 7. These authors were also able to identify coronavirus infections by a noncommercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique and rhinoviruses by seminested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. 9 In a prospective study, Beasley e t al 8 assessed recent RTI in acute asthma exacerbations in adults in an outpatient setting. Though overall they found evidence of RTI in only 10% of acute asthma exacerbations, they state that the incidence of viral RTI with severe asthma exacerbation was 36%. The authors, however, did not specify the criteria for severity of asthma. They further found that 60% of those adult asthma patients who had evidence of RTI also had an exacerbation of asthma of varying severity. 8 To our knowledge, our study is only the second prospective work assessing the association of recent RTI in adults with acute asthma requiring hospitalization. Abramson et al, 18 in a case-control study of 38 patients older than 10 years admitted to hospital with acute asthma, found that 21% had evidence of recent viral RTI. The asthmatic group had 6.2 times more chance of having viral RTI than a control group. 18 Our study has a larger number of patients and we specifically assessed patients older than 18 years. To reduce the likelihood that our findings may have been secondary to a high background incidence of RTI within the general community at the time of our study, we attempted to recruit control subjects who were age-and sex-matched with our patients. Because our control subjects were recruited simultaneously with the patients and were age-and sexmatched, there were some difficulties with recruiting over the entire 12-month period; however, it was clear that the rate of RTI within the control group was lower than the asthmatic patients. Our control subjects, however, were a selected group admitted to the hospital for elective surgery and our finding of 9% incidence of recent RTI may be an underestimation for the general community. Although we do not have incidence figures of RTI agents in the community during the time frame of our study, we have an indication of these pathogens in the community from data collected by VIDRL (N. Lehmann; personal communication; 1995).1 9 These data are taken from serologic, NP A, and sputum samples sent to the reference laboratory, from patients who are ill with RTI. Overall during winter, RSV was the predominant pathogen as it was in spring and the influenza viruses were common in early spring. Viral infections were uncommon in summer with adenoviruses and parainfluenza viruses being predominant, and during autumn, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and parainfluenza viruses were common. From these figures, there did not seem to be an influenza or Mycoplasma outbreak in the community during the 12 months of our study (N. Lehmann; personal communication; 1995). 1 9 Indeed RSV, adenoviruses, and parainfluenza were noted frequently in the VIDRL data, but they were infrequently associated with asthma exacerbations in our study. The reasons for this are unclear; perhaps the latter infections occurred predominantly in children and/or are less likely to cause increase in bronchial reactivity in adults compared with the influenza viruses. 20 Data regarding pollen counts during the year in Melbourne show that 81% of total grass pollens per annum occur in November and December and tree pollens, mainly elm and cypress, predominate in late winter and early spring. 21 Taken together, these data suggest that in late winter and early spring, the population is exposed to a number of RTI pathogens and tree pollens that could potentially cause asthma. Whereas in summer, though RTI pathogens are less evident, grass pollens are abundant and in autumn and early winter, RTI pathogens are again common in the community. Our hospital admission rates for adult patients with acute asthma show that 55% of the patients were admitted in the five months August 1993 to December 1993 inclusive, whereas in the four months January 1994 to April 1994 inclusive, 20% of the year total number of patients were admitted (Fig 1) . It is therefore tempting to suggest that in our group of patients, the worst times for acute exacerbation of asthma are in late winter, all of spring, and early summer and are related to high levels of community RTI pathogens and high environmental pollen counts. We believe that the incidence of 37% RTI occurring in adult patients with acute exacerbation of asthma requiring hospitalization could be underestimated because a number of the patients failed to return for their convalescent serum sample and as a result some viral infections may have been missed. In addition, we were unable to specifically culture for Chlamydia pneurrwniae (strain TW AR) infection, an organism that has previously been implicated in asthma exacerbations. 22 Further studies in adults with acute exacerbation of asthma using the polymerase chain reaction technique for viral identification may identify a higher incidence of RTI in adult subjects. 23 • 24 It is possible that we may have overestimated the frequency of RTI in our patients by using the criteria of chest radiograph consolidation in association with fever and blood neutrophilia as being diagnostic of infection. However, these criteria are used in routine clinical practice to diagnose pneumonia, and in studies of etiology of hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia, an infective organism is not identified in at least 30% of cases. 25 Similarly the isolation of an organism in the sputum is likely to be pathogenic in the setting of associated sputum neutrophilia and fever with or without chest radiograph abnormalities. Alternatively, we may have underestimated the number of patients with bacterial RTI because of antibiotic therapy prior to their admission to hospital. We do not have reliable data to confirm or deny this possibility, though most of the patients in the study denied recent antibiotic therapy. An interesting clinical observation was the 43% frequency of fever in patients with acute exacerbation of asthma requiring hospitalization. One could postulate that the fever could be secondary to the inflammatory process of asthma alone. However, perhaps not surprisingly, in our population the find-ing of a fever was more common in those asthmatics with evidence of recent RTI compared to those without. Those patients with evidence of recent RTI but who were afebrile on admission to hospital may have exhibited ongoing increased bronchial reactivity secondary to an RTI that had occurred within the 4 weeks prior to hospitalization. There is evidence from both animal and human experimentation to support the concept that viral RTI cause ongoing bronchial inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity.26·27 In addition, as previously stated, adult asthma patients may present to hospital late in the disease severity, so that even if there is evidence of recent RTI, the patients may be afebrile at time of hospitalization. In summary, we believe this study demonstrates that there is a strong association of recent RTI with severe acute exacerbation of asthma in adults requiring hospitalization for their asthma. The 19% incidence of influenza infection in this group supports the view that in adults with significant long-term asthma, influenza vaccination on a y early basis would be advisable. 28 As 79% of RTI found in our patient group were viral, we suggest that antibiotic therapy be withheld in acute severe exacerbation of asthma unless there is a high clinical and microbiologic suspicion of acute bacterial infection.
