A total of 1,550 surveys at the Frontline level were initiated and collected, and 615 were initiated and collected at the Lead level, for a total of 2,165 and an overall response rate of approximately 2%. All survey questions were voluntary and skip patterns were integrated throughout; therefore, individual question response rates varied from 16.9%-74.4% at the Frontline level and 24.4% to 72.3% at the Supervisor level, with a final survey completion rate of 47.4% and 46.0%, respectively, of those who initiated the survey. Individual question response rates are detailed throughout the results. EMS survey respondents were holders of varying positions and some respondents indicated holding multiple titles. When asked for self-reported titles at the Lead level (451 responses), 12.9% were training or education officers; 52.8% were in high-level administration positions (ie, director, president, vice president, or captain); 20.2% were chiefs; and 14.2% were paramedics, firefighters, or EMTs. At the Frontline level (1,126 responses), 56.8% were paramedics (eg, medics, NPR, and EMT-P); 33.0% were EMTs (includes EMT-B and EMT-A); 4.8% were officers (ie, lieutenant, captain, chief, sergeant); and 5.4% were support (ie, office staff, instructors, or engineers).
