In total, 626 hospital environmental surface swab samples were collected; 13.6% were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1 ). There were significant differences in the percentage of positive samples found across different hospital areas (P < .01). The most contaminated zones were the intensive care unit (ICU) that specialized in caring for NCP patients (31.9%), the Obstetric Isolation Ward focusing .

CZ II included the Outpatient Lobby (16.7% positive samples), Emergency Department (12.5%), Office and Preparation Area of the Isolation Ward for NCP patients (12.2%), Obstetric Ward (12.1%), and Clinical Laboratories (11.5%). CZ I included the Fever Clinics (6.5% positive samples), CT Examination Room (5.6%), and General Ward (5.5%). Both the Administrative Area and Parking Lot were classified as CZ 0. Among all examined commonly used hospital objects and medical equipment, 13.9% were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 ( Table 2 ). This included positive samples from self-service printers (20%, it is a machine commonly used in China by patients themselves to print out their examination or test reports in a hospital), desktops (16.8%), doorknobs (16.0%), and telephones (12.5%), medical equipment (12.5%), and public facilities (8%). Only 5.6% of samples collected from walls and floors were positive. The most contaminated objects were self-service printers (20%), desktops/keyboards (16.8%), and doorknobs (16%). Of the samples collected from HCWs' used PPE (hand sanitizer dispensers, gloves, and eye protector/face shield), 12.9% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Table 3 ). Significant differences were found in the percentage of positive samples across the PPE types (P < .01). The highest positive detection rate found was from the hand sanitizer dispensers 20.3%; 15.4% and 1.7% of gloves and eye protection or face shields tested positive, respectively (Table 3) .
