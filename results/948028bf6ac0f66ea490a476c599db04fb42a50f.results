Complement is activated in SARS-CoV MA15-infected mice. While work by other laboratories has shown that C3-deficient mice are extremely susceptible to both H5N1 and H1N1 influenza virus infection (22) , the role of complement in SARS-CoV infection has not yet been evaluated in vivo. Using a systems biology-based approach, we identified the complement pathway as a high-priority target for control of SARS-CoV MA15 (the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV) pathogenesis based on weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) of RNA transcripts in the lungs of mice infected with a lethal versus a sublethal dose of SARS-CoV MA15 (23) . Because the complement signaling cascade is activated through proteolytic cleavage events, we also assessed lung proteomics samples for complement protein abundance. C4b, CfB, and C3 all had significantly higher abundances in the lungs of mice infected with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV MA15 than in those of mice infected with a sublethal dose (Fig. 1A) . Complement activation is measured by detection of pathway component cleavage products. C3, the master regulator of complement signaling, is cleaved into C3a and C3b following creation of C3 convertase. C3 activation products (C3 fragments C3a, C3b, iC3b, C3dg, and C3c) were detected by Western blotting in lung tissue of SARS-CoV MA15-infected mice, but not in control mice, as early as 1 day postinfection (dpi) (Fig. 1B) , confirming that SARS-CoV MA15 infection activates the complement pathway.
