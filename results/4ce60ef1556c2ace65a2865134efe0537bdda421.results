The incidence of FHC in normal newborns in our series was 0.5% (18/3545). The incidence of subependymal cyst was 11.90% and choroid plexus cyst 1.21%. The characteristics and clinical and ultrasound findings of the 18 subjects are listed in Table 1 . All FHCs were found in the first 3 days after birth by ultrasound examination. No other sonographic abnormalities were seen. The antenatal history and delivery were unremarkable in all 18. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities except for subject 3, who had bilateral simian fissures, and subject 13, who had a small anal polyp. All infants were full term or near full term. The gestational age ranged from 36 to 41 weeks, the head circumference from 30.5 to 35.5 cm, and the birth weight from 1986 to 3618 g. The female to male ratio was 2:1 (12/6). The FHC was bilateral in seven and unilateral in 11 (7 left, 4 right). Only one baby had an atypical FHC. Among the 17 infants with typical FHCs, 12 infants had repeat ultrasound at 1 month of age. Of these 12, the cyst had disappeared in six (50%) by 1 month, one patient was later lost to follow up, and the remaining five had repeat scans that showed disappearance of the cyst by 3-11 months of age. One infant had only one follow up scan at 2 months, which showed resolution of the cyst. Among the other four infants with typical FHC, one was lost to follow up, one had a persistent cyst at 1 month and no further scan but was subsequently normal on Denver Developmental screening, and the other two had normal development but no follow up scans. Infant 17 had an atypical FHC in that the cyst did not have the typical elliptical shape ( Fig. 2A,B) . It enlarged and exerted a mass effect, compressing the contralateral hemisphere; a midline shift was seen on the follow-up examination at two months. This finding was confirmed by computed tomography (Fig. 2C,D) . However, when the child was 4-months-old, the cyst had not enlarged and there was no further mass effect. The infant was developmentally normal.
