Preliminary experiments were conducted to determine the amount of gamma radiation required to inactivate the infectivity of 13 influenza virus strains. Allantoic fluid pools of 400 to 500 ml were prepared for each of the influenza types A and B viruses. An amniotic fluid pool was prepared from eggs infected with influenza G/Taylor/1233/47. The pools were dispensed in 25 ml aliquots in glass, screwcap bottles and were exposed to five increasing amounts of gamma radiation from O-4 to 2.1 Mrad. Duplicate infectivity titrations were performed in six embryonated eggs per dilution of the untreated and treated materials. After incubation, the fluids from each egg were harvested individually and tested for hemagglutinins. Positive HA was used as indication of infectivity. The rates of inactivation were determined by reduction in infectivity titers (Table 2) . A/New Jersey18176 was inactivated with 0.8 Mrad. This was the smallest radiation dosage required for inactivation of any of the 13 influenza viruses. Four strains were inactivated with 1-3 Mrad and the remaining eight viruses were non-infective after exposure to 1.7 Mrad. Innocuity was confirmed by titration of fluids from individual eggs at the infectivity endpoint dilution. Infectivity titers decreased in direct proportion to the increase in radiation. As a quality control on the inactivated antigens, 0.1% BPL was used to treat additional samples from each influenza pool by routine procedures. The pools were innocuity tested in embryonated eggs and all were non-infectious after treatment with 0.1% BPL. The stabilities of untreated versus gamma-and BPL-inactivated hemagglutinins from split samples were compared (Table 3) . Gamma and BPL concentrations used were those previously determined to effectively inactivate the influenza antigens. Comparable HA titers were obtained with antigens inactivated by both procedures with the exception of B/Lee/40 which showed a four-fold decrease in titer following BPL treatment. The antigenic specificity was determined in HI tests with reference chicken antisera. Each inactivated antigen was inhibited by reference homologous antisera to a titer within twofold of that obtained with the non-inactivated control. Radiation with 1.7 Mrad did not cause any change in the antigenic specificity of the antigens. Their performance as reference reagents was unaffected. Using the standard neuraminidase assay, the percentage of neuraminidase activity remaining in the split samples after gamma and BPL inactivation was compared with the percentage of activity in the infectious control preparations. Neuraminidase activity in control and inactivated preparations was tested on at least two occasions (Table 3) . Five BPL-inactivated and two gamma-inactivated influenza preparations showed a higher percentage of remaining neuraminidase activity than their corresponding inactivated sample. Four specimens, A/Japan/170/62 (HZNZ), A/ Victoria/3/75(H3N2), A/Equine/Prague/56 (Heql Neql), and A/Equine/Miami/63 (Heq2Neq2), exhibited <107c variance between samples in the amount of remaining neuraminidase. These four specimens were considered to be comparable. Greater stability of Nl was observed after BPL inactivation, while Neql and Neq2 neuraminadase activity was stable after inactivation by both methods. With the exception of A/Texas/1/77(H3N2), less inactivation of N2 was observed with gamma treatments. Since greater inactivation of type Nl and B neuraminidases by radiation was observed, additional investigations were performed by repeating the neuraminidase assay on five selected influenza antigens. Influenza AiNew Jersey/8/76(HswlNl), AlUSSR/90/ 77(HlNl), and B/Hong Kong/5/72 were re-evaluated. AITexas/1/77(H3N2) was included because of the low result previously obtained and A/equine/Miami/ 63tHeq2Neq2) was used as a control. These antigens were exposed at five radiation doses, from 0.8 to 4.5 Mrad, under three temperature conditions, unrefrigerated (2O"C), ice bath (4"-5"C), and frozen (-20°C) (Fig. 1) . Inactivation of infectivity was slower in the frozen state and required 2.4 Mrad as compared to 1.6 Mrad at other temperatures. The neuraminidase inactivation rates increased with higher temperature and with increased amounts of radiation. At 4°C and above, significant inactivation of the influenza B and Nl neuraminidases was confirmed, but satisfactory levels remained when treatment occurred at -20°C. The N2 neuraminidase level of A/Texas/l/77 showed less inactivation than observed in the previous experiment. However, at temperature above 4"C, significant inactivation occurred at the higher radiation levels that was not evident with the frozen samples. The Neq2 neuraminidase control demonstrated good stability at all temperatures. The second group of viruses investigated contained 11 enterovirus strains. The objective was to determine the amount of gamma radiation required to inactivate these viruses grown in cell cultures. Enteroviruses 68 and 70 required 3.2 Mrad for inactivation while polioviruses 2 and 3 and coxsackievirus A-4 required 4.2 Mrad. The other enteroviruses were inactivated with 3.7 Mrad (Table 4) . Innocuity was confirmed with the pooled suspensions from the endpoint dilutions as previously described. When CPE was not observed after 7 days of incubation at 37"C, the innocuity was considered confirmed. Six different viruses, three entero-and three myxo- in lo-day embryonated eggs. Infectivity titers were determined for each pool and the antigens were gamma-inactivated while chilled in an ice bath at 4 to 5°C. The serologic reactivity was compared with that obtained with non-inactivated materials (Table 5 ). Innocuity tests were performed and confirmed in the same host system. The radiation dosage necessary for inactivation varied with each of the viruses. During inactivation, HA titers for measles, Newcastle Disease, and parainfluenza types 1 and 3 remained stable. Reovirus types 1 and 2 showed a four-to eight-fold decrease in titer, but retained satisfactory potency. Reovirus type 3 HA antigen exhibited an eight-fold titer decline to an unsatisfactory potency. The HA titer of simian rotavirus was totally destroyed. In comparing the CF titers of non-irradiated and irradiated antigens, we observed that two antigens, coronavirus and respiratory syncytial showed a >two-fold decrease in potency after gamma treatment. Three antigen preparations (parainfluenza 1, calf and simian rotaviruses) were unsatisfactory because of low potency levels in both treated and nontreated preparations. The remaining CF antigens were satisfactory. The sensitivity and specificity of the inactivated HA and CF antigens were comparable to that of the CDC reference antigens as determined in tests with homologous and heterolo-of the seven CF antigens maintained titer stability gous the CDC reference human and animal antisera. through the B-year period.
