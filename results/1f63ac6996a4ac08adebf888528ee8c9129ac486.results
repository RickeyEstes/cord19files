Mutations in the predicted ADP-ribose binding site in the nsP3 macro domain do not affect PAR binding, but do affect SINV replication Modeling of nsP3 against a macro domain protein from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (Fig. 1A) predicted that asparagines at amino acids 10 and 24 of nsP3 are at corresponding positions to the two amino acids in close contact with ADP-ribose in A. fulgidus (Fig. 1B) (10). These asparagines were changed to alanines to generate SINV with a double mutation (SINV DM) or with single mutations at amino acid 10 (SINV SM10) or 24 (SINV SM24) (Fig. 1C) . To assess the effect of these mutations on PAR binding, his-tagged WT and mutant proteins were tested for interaction with PAR at different concentrations (Fig. 1D) . The mutations had no effect on binding of PAR. To assess the potential importance of the amino acids at these positions for SINV replication, undifferentiated ( Fig. 2A ) and differentiated ( Fig. 2B ) CSM14.1 cells were infected with SINV WT, SM10, SM24, or DM. In differentiated CSM14.1 cells, the replication of SINV SM10 and DM was impaired at early times after infection (P b 0.01 before 24 h). After 24 h, replication of SINV WT plateaued, while replication of SINV SM10 and DM continued to increase to approximately the same level as SINV WT. Replication of SINV SM24 was less impaired, suggesting that the amino acid at position 10 of nsP3 is more important for SINV replication in neurons than the amino acid at position 24. The results in undifferentiated CSM14.1 cells were similar. In BHK21 cells, however, replication of SINV WT and DM was not different (Fig. 2C) , suggesting that the effect of mutations on SINV replication is greatest in neurons. Revertants arise during growth of nsP3 macro domain mutants in neurons SINV DM grown in BHK21 cells showed a small plaque phenotype compared to the large plaques produced by SINV WT (Fig. 3A) . Viruses produced by SINV WT-infected differentiated CSM14.1 cells also formed large plaques (average diameter of 3 mm). In contrast, viruses produced by SINV DM-infected differentiated (Fig. 3A ) and undifferentiated (data not shown) CSM14.1 cells were a mixture of small plaques (average diameter of 1.5 mm) and a few large plaques (Fig. 3A , arrow). To determine whether these large plaques were revertants, plaques from SINV DM grown in undifferentiated or differentiated CSM14.1 cells, or BHK21 cells were isolated and sequenced. In BHK21 cells, all plaques were original SINV DM with no reversion. In undifferentiated and differentiated CSM14.1 cells, however, small plaque viruses retained the original mutations, while large plaque viruses had reverted alanine (GCT) at amino acid 10 of nsP3 to threonine (ACT) or aspartate (GAT) (Fig. 3B ). These reversions required only a single nucleotide change and were detected as early as 8 h after infection of both undifferentiated and differentiated CSM14.1 cells. SINV DM grown in CSM14.1 cells was also sequenced directly without plaque isolation (Fig. 3C ) and showed co-existence of the original SINV DM and variants with reversions at amino acid 10. No reversion was detected at amino acid 24, and SINV SM24 formed large plaques (data not shown). In addition to the reversion at amino acid 10, a second-site mutation was detected at amino acid 31. A change from glutamate (GAA) (31E) to glycine (GGA) (31G) was present in plaques from SINV DM without the reversion at amino acid 10 ( Fig. 3B ). This second-site mutation was detected as early as 8 h after infection of CSM14.1 cells and represented more than 50% of the total virus population (Fig. 3C ). However, this change at amino acid 31 did not increase the plaque size ( Fig. 3B ). Although most alphaviruses contain glutamate or aspartate at the position corresponding to nsP3 31E, most other macro domain proteins contain glycine (Fig. 3D ). When Cα and side chain positions of nsP3 31E are compared to those of corresponding residues in the Af1521 macro domain protein from A. fulgidus (Karras et al., 2005) , 31E has a bulky side chain that the template glycine residue does not have, and Cα positions of 31E and nearby residues (30G and 32G) are not similar to those of corresponding residues in the template (Fig.  3E ). In contrast, Cα and side chain positions of nsP3 amino acids 10N and 24N are highly similar to those of corresponding residues in Af1521.
