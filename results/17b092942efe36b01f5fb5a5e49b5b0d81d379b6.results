During the site visits, we completed 127 questionnaires of HCWs, 31 questionnaires of UMs, and 40 questionnaires of HMs. A total of 115 respirator demonstrations was observed (a mean of five per facility). As shown in Table 1 , whereas all hospitals visited had respiratory protection policies present, 2 hospitals lacked a defined RPP (8.7%), and many were missing key components. Less than half of the programs reviewed contained a plan to evaluate the effectiveness of the RPP (47.8%) or a designated RPP administrator (39.1%). Only 69.6% of hospitals had the need for medical evaluation and clearance fully stated in the RPP, with 21.7% partially stating it. The fit-testing component of an RPP should provide guidance in choosing the brand, model, and size of respirator that provides the best fit for each individual employee, as well as instructions for proper wear procedures. This was only fully included in 65.2% of RPPs reviewed. Guidance pertaining to the use and storage of respirators was fully included in the RPPs 65.2% and 60.9% of the time, respectively (Table 1) . Based on their responses, UMs and HMs were generally very aware and knowledgeable about their hospitals' respiratory protection policies, and appropriate respiratory protection practices ( Table 2 ). Health care workers reported that the N-95s they were fit tested for were easily accessible 92.9% of the time and stored close to the point of use 94.5% of the time ( Table 2) . Hospitals are required to have PAPRs on hand if there is an employee who cannot be cleared to wear an N-95. PAPRs are also desirable to use when performing a high-risk, aerosol-generating procedure. When asked whether the facility had PAPRs available for use when employees need them, 59.8% of HCWs responded "Yes" ( Table 2) . When asked about the most common trigger for use of respiratory protection, HCWs stated that 57.5% of the time it is a "Patients' signs and symptoms" ( Table 2) . Medical evaluation and clearance, in addition to fit testing, is required at hire before being allowed to wear an N-95 respirator. HCWs stated that they did receive medical evaluation and clearance 96.9% of the time ( Table 2) . Facilities are required to offer employees training about how to use respiratory protection. HCWs reported this 96.9% of the time ( Table 2 ). OSHA requires that respirator training be provided at hire and every year thereafter. HCWs reported that this standard was met 81.9% of the time ( Table 2 ). The overall beliefs of those interviewed were that employees used respirators when they were required: HCWs stated this 87.4% of the time ( Table 2) . Vaccinations are important in preventing the spread of influenza within the health care facility. Of those surveyed, 74.8% reported being vaccinated for the 2011-2012 season ( Table 2 ). The majority of HCWs reported that flu vaccinations were made available to them at no cost during the 2010-2011 flu season (96.1%) and the 2011-2012 season (99.2%) ( Table 2 ). To conserve supplies in the event of a shortage, while still reducing the risk of exposure to influenza, employees can redon a specific N-95 as long as it has not been soiled or functionally compromised. Facilities should state in the RPP the specifics of reuse. The N-95 should be stored in a paper bag (or other breathable container) between uses. Less than half of all those surveyed were aware of a reuse policy in their facility. Of those who stated there was a policy for the reuse of N-95s, the majority was unaware of the recommendation to store an N-95 in a breathable container between uses (Table 3) . All HCWs were asked questions about the appropriate respirator that would be required for different scenarios and levels of precaution. A respirator selection element was included in 60.9% of the RPPs reviewed (Table 1) . When asked during interviews about the selection of appropriate respiratory protection based on precautions (droplet, influenza, airborne) and task (close contact, aerosol-generating procedure), results were wide-ranging (Fig 3) . These respirator selection requirements are based on Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee guidance. 6 The majority of respondents reported that they had access to the model and size for which they received a fit test (97.4%). We observed that participants performed well in positioning the N-95 properly on the face (92.2%), properly placing the straps (87.8%), properly forming the nose clip (85.2%), and having no facial hair under the seal (93.0%). Only 36.5% of participants performed the seal check, which is imperative in determining whether a proper fit has been achieved. The respirators were properly removed using the straps 65.2% of the time (Table 4) .
