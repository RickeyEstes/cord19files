Fifty-six (56%) were studying for a higher diploma in nursing and 44 (44%) were working toward a bachelor's degree in nursing. Forty of them (40%) had completed year 1, 42 (42%) had completed year 2, 16 (16%) had completed year 3, and 2 (2%) had completed year 4. None had experience in nursing SARS patients.
