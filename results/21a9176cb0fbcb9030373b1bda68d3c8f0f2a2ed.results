A total of 280 patients from different geographical regions of Turkey were included in the study. A total of 31 patients whose medical records were missing could not be included in the study. There were 163 (58.2%) males with an average age of 32.9 ± 21.08 (min 11---max 72) months and BMI of 16.4 (min 10.8---max 29.5). The average duration of hospitalisation was 9.2 ± 7.90 (min 1---max 60) days. Viral agents included RSV (29.7%), Influenza A (20.5%), rhinovirus (18.9%), adenovirus (10%), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (8%), parainfluenza (5.2%), coronavirus (6%), and bocavirus (1.6%). When the history of atopy in the family was questioned, 16% had parental asthma, 6.9% had family history of allergic rhinitis, 3.6% eczema and 6.0% food/drug allergy in the family. Forty-eight percent of the patients had ever wheezing, 5.2% had allergic rhinitis, 2% had eczema and 5.2% had food/drug allergy. Environmental tobacco smoke exposure was present in 44.1% of the patients. When the family education status was evaluated 33.7% mothers had high-school education and 46.9% of the fathers had high-school education. Three percent of the patients had received influenza vaccine and 6.4% had pets in their homes (Table 1) . Atopy was found in 60 (21.4%) patients; most frequent sensitisations were mite (11.4%), grass/pollen mixture (7.1%) and Alternaria (5%). Atopy was more frequent in patients with influenza (29.2%) and rhinovirus (25%) infections (p = 0.196) but no statistically significant difference was found. Atopic patients were older compared to nonatopic patients with viral pneumonia (p = 0.001). One hundred and ninety-five patients (69.6%) had mild---moderate, 85 (30.4%) had severe pneumonia. When compared to patients with mild or moderate pneumonia, patients with severe pneumonia were found to carry a significantly greater relative risk (RR) in terms of ever wheezing (RR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1---2.4), parental asthma (RR: 1.5, 95% CI:1.09---2.23), other allergic diseases in the family (RR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.16---2.9) and ETS (RR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1---3.5) respectively. The education status of the parents, existence of pets, whether the patient or the family members had had influenza vaccination during this year or in the past were not associated with the severity of pneumonia (Tables 2a and 2b) . Not surprisingly, patients with severe pneumonia had longer duration of hospitalisation (p < 0.001) and their body mass indexes were lower (p = 0.032). Children with severe pneumonia had lower number of lymphocytes (p < 0.001) and eosinophils (p = 0.003), and higher number of neutrophils (p < 0.001) compared to mild to moderate group. Atopy was detected in 17.6% of children with severe pneumonia and 16.4% in mild---moderate pneumonia (p = 0.736). Even though no statistically significant difference was found in terms of atopy in the group with severe pneumonia, ever wheezing (p = 0.008) and parental asthma (p = 0.004) were observed more frequently in children with severe pneumonia (Table 2b ).
