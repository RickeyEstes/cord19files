A total of 820 children were recruited in the clinical trial. Seven hundred and seventy four children (94.4%) had NPA collected. Therefore, the study group consisted of 774 cases. A subgroup of 272 (36.4%) cases had concordant radiologically-confirmed pneumonia. According to radiologists 1, 2, and 3, consolidation was found in, respectively, 84.2%, 76.8%, and 69.1% of the 272 cases with concordant radiologically-confirmed pneumonia. As per each radiologist, the other cases presented pulmonary infiltrate. When the baseline characteristics were compared, the only difference found was in the frequency of fever, which was more common among patients with multiple viruses in regard to patients with single virus (93.9% vs. 88.4%; P = 0.01). Table 2 presents the frequency of each respiratory virus detected. RV, HAdV, and EV were the most commonly found viruses either in the whole group or in the subgroup of patients with concordant radiologicallyconfirmed pneumonia. The in-house triplex PCR test and Anyplex II RV16 detected RV, EV, and RSV in 77.6% and 69.9% of the NPA samples, respectively. Data on acute HBoV1 infection diagnosed by serology have been published elsewhere [13] . Overall, among 491 cases with multiple virus detection, the number of detected viruses were: 2 (n = 234; 47.7%), 3 (n = 140; 28.5%), 4 (n = 66; 13.4%), 5 (n = 34; 6.9%), 6 (n = 13; 2.6%), 7 (n = 3; 0.6%), and 8 (n = 1; 0.2%), being RV plus HAdV (n = 177; 36.0%), RV plus HBoV1 (n = 108; 22.0%), EV plus HAdV (n = 90; 18.3%), EV plus RV (n = 85; 17.3%), and HBoV1 plus HAdV (n = 42; 8.6%) the most frequent combinations, either alone or along with other viruses. On the other hand, the number of detected viruses among 170 cases with concordant radiologically-confirmed pneumonia and multiple virus detections were: 2 (n = 75; 44.1%), 3 (n = 46; 27.1%), 4 (n = 28; 16.5%), 5 (n = 14; 8.2%), 6 (n = 5; 2.9%), and 7 (n = 2; 1.2%), being RV plus HAdV (n = 49; 28.8%), EV plus RV (n = 43; 25.3%), HBoV plus HAdV (n = 37; 21.8%), RV plus HBoV (n = 32; 18.8%), and EV plus HAdV (n = 30; 17.6%) the most frequent combinations, either alone or along with other viruses too. Table 3 shows the comparison of the frequency of each virus among children with sole or multiple virus detection. In the whole group, no difference was found in the frequency of RSV A, RSV B, Flu A, Flu B, PIV 1, or PIV 4. Among 238 cases of non-severe CAP with concordant radiologically-confirmed pneumonia and virus detected, RV, HAdV, EV, HBoV1, and PIV 3 were significantly more frequent among cases with detection of multiple viruses. Table 4 compares the distribution of age and disease duration between children with or without each respiratory virus. Children with RSV A or PIV 3 or HCoV OC43 were younger than those without each one of them whereas children with PIV 4 were older than those without it. In regard to disease duration, children with RSV had a shorter disease than those without it. Similar results were found among patients with concordant radiologically-confirmed pneumonia. Table 5 presents the frequency of the baseline characteristics among patients with distinct respiratory viruses. Table 6 compares the baseline characteristics among patients with sole respiratory virus detection and detected distinct viruses. The frequency of fever, crackles and tachypnea was significantly different among the compared subgroups (Table 6 ).
