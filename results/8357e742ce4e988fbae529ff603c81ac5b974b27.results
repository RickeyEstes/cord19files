GLDC was prioritized as a potential susceptibility gene to severe influenza through an integrative approach. Based on the existing knowledge, we uncovered the GLDC/pyrimidine biosynthesis/innate immunity axis. We demonstrated that GLDC inhibition and depletion significantly amplified the antiviral response of type I IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes and suppressed the replication of H1N1 and H7N9 viruses. Consistently, GLDC overexpression significantly promoted viral replication due to the attenuated antiviral responses. GLDC inhibition in the H1N1-infected BALB/c mice recapitulated the amplified antiviral response and suppressed viral growth, indicating that temporal GLDC inhibition could achieve a potent protection to the infected mice from the fatal infection.
