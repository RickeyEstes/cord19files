In 44 rabbits, histology showed typical lesions for attaching effacing E. coli (AEEC) as described before (Peeters et al., 1984a (Peeters et al., , 1985b ; these were moderate to large numbers of gram-negative organisms apparently attached to the epithelium of ileum, cecum and colon. Microvilli were effaced. The lamina propria beneath areas of attachment was infiltrated by polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNL). At necropsy, the cecal wail showed edema and cecal contents were foul smelling, watery and brown. Bacteriology of intestinal contents showed confluent growth of E. coli from at least the cecum of these animals. Lesions of Tyzzer's disease were found in 14 animals. A detailed description of clinical signs, gross pathology and histopathological lesions is reported elsewhere (Peeters et ai., 1985a} . Briefly, lesions consisted of multifocal hepatic necrosis and patchy mucosal necrosis in the ileum, cecum and colon. Histology of the liver showed bundles of weakly-staining gram-negative and silver-positive rod-shaped bacilli in apparently viable hepatocytes bordering foci of necrosis. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed these organisms to have a similar ultrastructure to Bacillus piliformis, the etiologic agent of Tyzzer's disease. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of rotaviruses, coronaviruses and parvoviruses in cecal contents of 40, two and one animal, respectively. Carbol-fuchsin stain and histology showed the presence of cryptosporidia in the intestinal tract of 12 animals. Eimeria spp. were found in 64 animals: 19 cecal samples contained <103 oocysts g-l, 24 between 103 and 104, 12 between 104 and l0 s and nine samples >10 s oocysts g-1. Semi-circular Gram-positive C. spiroforme-like organisms were demonstrated in smears of 78 cecal samples from diarrheic rabbits out of a total of 149 examined. When organisms were abundantly present, helically coiled forms were also seen. Organisms presenting as loosely-coiled rods were cultured anaerobically from 46 of these samples on Columbia sheep blot)d agar. Between 1 × 102 and 2 × 10 ~ spores of these organisms were present per gram (wet weight) of cecal contents. Numbers of C. spiroforme present were probably higher, as figures are based on recovery of spores. A total of 32 C. spiroforme-like strains was isolated and stored in standard Robertson's cooked meat medium. Presumptive C. spiroforme strains with typical loosely-coiled morphology as seen by Gram stain could not be separated from contaminants in samples containing <103 spores g-1. PAGE confirmed identity between outer membrane proteins of 25 isolates and those of the reference strain of C. spiroforme NCTC 11493. Four strains grew insufficiently and were not tested. Rocket immuno-electrophoresis of 48-h BHI peptone glucose salts culture filtrates showed the presence of iotalike toxins in 26 cultures, including the cultures from the four strains which could not be tested by PAGE. So, it can be assumed that 29 isolates of 32 were in fact C. spiroforme. Three of the 29 isolates were not toxigenic. Toxic strains originated from 24 of the 29 rabbitries visited. Neutralization trials with iota-anti-toxins in mice showed that 11 out of 78 cecal filtrates of C. spiroforme-positive samples contained enough iota-like toxin to kill mice. Table I shows the presence of parasites, bacteria and viruses in cecal samples which were positive or negative for C. spiroforme as judged by In 26 of 78 samples, more than one of these agents was present. In 20 samples, only C. spiroforme was established as potential pathogen by Gram's stain. From 12 of these 20 samples, C. spiroforme was cultured: all 12 strains were toxigenic. Three of the 20 cecal samples contained enough toxin to kill mice. In 115 of 149 rabbits examined more than one pathogen was established. This makes evaluation of gross and microscopic lesions difficult, so only lesions in the 20 rabbits showing C. spiroforme as the only possible pathogenic agent can be evaluated. The perineum and hind legs of these 20 rabbits were extensively soiled by liquid feces. At necropsy of these animals, the small intestine was dilated and contained a colourless to light yellowish liquid. In two animals, the small intestine was moderately congested. Cecal contents were watery (16/20). In animals killed in extremis, cecal contents were blood-stained (3/20): blood-stained cecal contents filtrates were toxic to mice. The cecal wall was thickened in five animals and showed paintbrush hemorrhages on the serosa of two animals; in the latter the proximal colon was congested. Mesenteric lymph nodes were moderately to severely swollen. Kidneys were pale and swollen in eight animals. Similar lesions were also established in animals with mixed infections. However, hemorrhages were only found in C. spiroforme-positive rabbits. Histology showed diffuse infiltration of the liver by PMNL in six animals and some miliary necrosis in one rabbit. Renal tubuli were dilated and showed mild epithelial degeneration in eight animals. Intestinal lesions were most pronounced in the distal ileum, cecum and proximal colon. They varied from accumulation of basophilic debris in enterocytes to necrosis and desquamation of epithelial cells. In the ileum and to a lesser degree in the jejunum and duodenum, villus length was reduced. In the three cases with toxic cecal contents, ileal, c~cal and colonic mucosa were partly denuded. Where the mucosa was still intact, it was covered by cuboidal epithelial cells. The ileal mucosa was almost completely flat. The lumen was filled with a proteinaceous fluid containing cellular debris, blood cells and fibrin. Edema of cecal propria and submucosa was present in seven animals. Hemorrhages were regularly seen. Propria and submucosa were infiltrated by PMNL and round cells.
