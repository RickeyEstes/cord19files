• For the Rose-Waaler test in normal animals, the differential titer (difference between titers at which agglutination of unsensitized versus sensitized sheep RBCs occurs) should be less than eight (Barta, 1993) . A titer against sensitized RBCs not corrected for the actual titer of natural antibodies to sheep RBCs can be misleading because some normal animals have higher titers of naturally occurring antibodies to sheep RBCs. Some laboratories perform the Rose-Waaler test by preabsorbing all test sera with sheep RBCs. In this case a titer of less than 16 is expected in normal dogs. Artifacts • Serum submitted for RF testing should not be frozen, because RF activity (especially IgM) may be destroyed, causing a false-negative result. Canine RF tends to self-associate, forming multimeric complexes that significantly lower the detectable titer. Wide, sometimes negative, fluctuations in RF titer occur over time; these fluctuations do not appear to correlate with disease severity. False-positive results may occur in the Rose-Waaler test if a patient's serum has antibodies against sheep RBCs and appropriate controls or absorption of these antibodies is not performed. joints is the most reliable means of diagnosing canine RA. Histopathologic examination of synovium allows an early diagnosis and therapy in patients lacking classic radiographic changes. An ANA titer helps distinguish SLE from RA; but it is occasionally positive for RA. Finding both types of autoantibodies may represent the rare, combined occurrence of both SLE and RA (a so-called overlap syndrome) or merely the appearance of multiple autoantibodies in a patient with RA or SLE. In either case, clinical criteria are required for diagnosis.
