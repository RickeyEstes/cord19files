Preparation and LC-MS analysis of oleuropein (Ole) and hydroxytyrosol (HT) Ole fractionates as a single peak by HPLC at 1.848 min with m/z of 539 and HT as a single peak by HPLC at 1.108 min with m/z of 153. Fig. 1E shows the major steps in Ole metabolism. These are also the basic reactions in HT preparation from Ole. First, the glucose moiety is removed by b-glycosidase to yield oleuropein aglycone (Ole-AG). Next, Ole-AG is hydrolyzed by esterase to yield HT and elenolic acid (EA). Fig. 1F shows chemical synthesis of HT using 3,4-dihydroxylphenylacetic acid (DHPAA) as the starting material. Two major steps are involved: (1) acetylation with acetyl chloride (AcCl), and (2) reduction by LiAlH 4 to yield HT. Chemically synthesized HT was purified and characterized by LC-MS, and demonstrates identical biological, chemical and physical properties as natural HT prepared from Ole from olive leaf extract. Ole and HT inhibit HIV-1 infection and replication, but are not toxic to target cells Ole and HT exhibit dose-dependent inhibition of HIV-1 infection and replication as measured by syncytial formation and p24 production ( Table 1 ). The average EC 50 for Ole is 55 nM for syncytial formation and 73 nM for p24 production. The corresponding EC 50 s are 61 and 68 nM for HT. No cytotoxicity was detected, either by MTT assay or trypan blue dye exclusion, over a 10,000-fold concentration range from 1 nM to 10 lM. The EC 50 s for inhibition on fusion complex, 6HB formation are also presented in Table 1 . Ole and HT bind to the conserved hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the central trimeric coiled-coil of HIV-1 gp41 Inhibition of syncytial formation by Ole and HT reflects effects on early events during viral infection/entry, including CD4 receptor and coreceptor binding as well as viral fusion. To probe anti-HIV mechanisms of Ole and HT, we carried out molecular docking and MD calculations of these small molecules with viral targets. We found that Ole and HT bind to the conserved hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the central trimeric coiled-coil of the HIV-1 gp41 fusion domain. HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) mediates viral entry by fusing virus to target cells. Env is trimeric on the virion surface. Each monomer contains a surface subunit, gp120, for virus binding to CD4 receptor and coreceptors [14] [15] [16] [17] and a noncovalently associated transmembrane subunit, gp41, that mediates fusion of the virus with the target cell [18, 19] . Fig. 2A shows the structure of HIV-1 gp41. Like other type I transmembrane proteins, HIV-1 gp41 consists of extracellular (ectodomain), transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. The ectodomain contains four functional regions: the fusion peptide (FP), N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR), C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR), and a tryptophan-rich region (TR). Binding of gp120 to the cellular receptor CD4 and coreceptor triggers conformational changes in gp41 that induce fusion [20] [21] [22] [23] . This increases exposure of two heptad repeat motifs, NHR and CHR, and insertion of the fusion peptide into the target membrane [20] [21] [22] [23] . Subsequently NHR and CHR fold in an antiparallel manner to create the six-helix bundle 6HB composed of a trimeric NHR coiled-coil core surrounded by three CHR helices that pack in the grooves of the coiled-coil as seen in Fig. 2B [24] [25] [26] . Formation of the 6HB promotes fusion between viral and cellular membranes and is essential for viral entry and infection [25, 26] . Ole and HT interact with the NHR coiled-coil trimer N36 helices and interfere with the formation of 6HB with the CHR, C34, as shown in Fig. 2C and D. We used the crystal structure of the HIV-1 gp41 fusion complex, PDB code 1AIK [20] as a reference for our modeling work. To provide a ligand-binding site, one of the C34 helices was removed from the 6HB (Fig. 3A ). Fig. 3B shows the chemical structure of Ole with the 9 free rotatable bonds selected in our modeling interaction. Molecular simulations suggest that the conserved hydrophobic cavity of the gp41 N36 trimer coiled-coil is the most likely binding site for Ole and HT. This cavity is mainly occupied by W628, W631, and neighboring I635 and D632. The predicted binding structures of Ole and HT are shown in Fig. 3C and D, respectively. Ole and HT form stable hydrogen bonds with Q577 on the N36 peptide. Fig. 3E and F are ribbon representations of the predicted binding site of Ole and HT. 5HB, consisting of three N36-peptides (pink, residues 546-581) and two C34 peptides (green, residues 628-661), is used for docking calculations. Only one groove is exposed for the binding of small molecules. Both Ole and HT occupy the binding site similarly, with the diphenol ring forming stable hydrogen bonds with Q577. This blocks the close contacts between the hydrophobic groove in the gp41 NHR and the indole rings of W631 and W628, thus interfering with the formation of 6HB. In addition to hydrogen binding, hydrophobic interactions with I573, G572, and L568 also play important roles in the interaction.
