The number of outbreaks varied according to region, with SE and UME (North Carolina and Minnesota/Iowa), the most swine densely populated regions of the country, reporting the highest number of outbreaks over the 2009-2016 period ( Table 1) . A given swine site may have had more than one outbreak through the study period; the number of outbreak per site reporting an outbreak was higher for the S and UMW regions (1.76 and 2.21 outbreaks per site, respectively) when compared to SE and UME (1.44 and 1.48 outbreaks per site, respectively). Those two last areas, however, did contribute with a larger number of months of data ( Table 1) . The generation time distribution followed a lognormal distribution for the regions of SE (mean 1.30 months, SD: 1.26), S (mean: 1.09 months, SD: 1.01), UME (mean: 7.93 months, SD: 7.76) and UMW (mean months: 1.30, SD: 1.23). The median and mean values for TD-R were similar across all regions and oscillated around 1.0, which is expected for endemic diseases. Interestingly, even though the mean and median values were close to 1 for all regions, incidence peaks and temporal variation in TD-R appeared remarkably different (Figure 2) . A difference was observed in regards to the maximum number of TD-R values observed across regions; specifically, the TD-R was highest for SE, followed by S, UMW, and UME ( Table 1) . There were also remarkable differences in PRRS immune status classification for sites reporting outbreaks across the four regions ( Table 1) : of note; for the S region, the vast majority of sites reporting outbreaks were vaccinating the herd prior to the outbreak, which was not observed in such proportion for other regions. The SE region had a higher proportion of sites breaking that were classified as status 1 (active infection) when compared to sites that reported outbreaks from other regions ( Table 1) . Between-region difference on median TD-R values was evident on the Kruskal-Wallis test, which showed that at least one of the regions had a different median (P = 0.03). Further post hoc pairwise comparison showed that the UME region was only statistically significant from the SE and UMW regions ( Table 2) . It has been previously reported that PRRS has an evident seasonal pattern, showing high incidence during fall and winter (October through January), and low during spring and summer [February through September (5)]. Surprisingly, after stratifying the data by geographical region, there was no obvious visual indication of predictable yearly patterns for any of the regions besides Minnesota/Iowa (Figure 2) . The TD-R description showed variation according to geographical region, a phenomenon similar to the one previously described for the incidence estimate (Figure 2) . The TD-R values showed statistically significant peaks before the incidence peaked for SE, S, and UMW (Figure 2) . Interestingly, when comparing raw number of new cases or incidence with the TD-R estimates, all statistically significant peaks of TD-R (P < 0.05) preceded a meaningful increase in the number of cases (>2) for the regions of SE and S, showing the potential the tool has for early signaling outbreaks (Figure 2) . The TD-R and the incidence peaks FigUre 2 | regional graphs showing time-dependent reproduction number (TD-r) and incidence for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. The Y axis corresponds to TD-R with 95% upper and lower confidence intervals (CIs) (red) and number of new cases (yellow; represented after replacing 0 counts with "1's" as described in Section "Materials and Methods").

For instances in which the TD-R peaks preceded the incidence peak, the lag time between peaks varied between 1 and 2 months. Likewise, indications that the epidemic was waning (TD-R < 1) occurred 2 months earlier than declines in incidence for SE and S (March 2015 versus May 2015 and November 2013 versus January 2014, respectively), and 1 month earlier for UMW. Finally, the 20 systems examined contributed with a population at risk of on average 35 farms (min: 7, max: 83) per system. The average number of outbreaks per farm reporting at least one outbreak was 48.15 (min: 12, max: 189). Separate system-specific TD-R appeared to vary (Table 3; Figure 3) , even for systems located within the same geographical region. Four systems were selected to illustrate differences between TD-R and incidence curves (systems A-D, Figure 3 ). Systems C and D, for example, were located within the same geographical region and showed one peak within the same time period (February 2015), even though the TD-R peak was not significant for system D. System A showed no significant peaks on TD-R, but it showed frequent increases in incidence; and system B showed a peak in TD-R not observed when farms are aggregated at the region level. The spatial-temporal model showed statistically significant clusters for all examined regions ( Table 4 ). There were 3 clusters in space and time for the SE region, 3 clusters for the S region, 10 clusters for UME, and 4 clusters for UMW.
