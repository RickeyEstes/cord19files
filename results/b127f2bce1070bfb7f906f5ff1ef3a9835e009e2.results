There were 96 study subjects with 194 separate illnesses for which samples were available for analysis ( Table 2 ). Participants in study 1 were younger (61.3 vs. 66.7 years, PZ0.005), more likely to be non-white (71% vs. 21%, P!0.05), and less likely to have received influenza vaccination (49% vs. 89%, P!0.001) than those in Study 2. The majority of subjects in both studies had a smoking history, but a larger percentage of persons in Study 1 were still smoking at study enrollment (46% vs. 15%, P!0.01). Paired sera were available for analysis for fewer illnesses in Study 1 than in Study 2 (38% vs. 91%, P!0.001). Eighty-eight respiratory viral infections were identified in 81 illnesses in the two studies; there were seven illnesses in which dual respiratory infections were identified (Table 3) . Fifty (57%) of the 88 infections were identified by culture or serologic methods while the RT-PCR assays identified an additional 38 infections. Overall, picornaviruses (rhinoviruses and enteroviruses) were the most common respiratory virus infections identified and the most frequent virus group identified only by RT-PCR. Twenty-eight of the isolated picornaviruses were further classified to the genus level: 24 were rhinoviruses and 4 were enteroviruses. Influenza viruses and coronaviruses were the next most commonly identified viruses. Fourteen of the 16 influenza virus infections were caused by influenza A viruses. Influenza virus infection was more common in Study 1 where none of the influenza virus-infected subjects were documented to have received influenza vaccine in the prior year. Twelve of the 16 coronavirus infections identified were caused by OC43-like strains. Only one of the four infections with 229E-like strains occurred in hospitalized subjects, and all four of these infections were identified by RT-PCR. Parainfluenza virus infections occurred in less than 5% of the illnesses. Two, two and five parainfluenza virus infections were seen with types 1, 2 and 3 strains, respectively. RT-PCR identified two additional type 3 infections and one additional type 1 infection. RSV infections were This study This study This study a For real-time PCR assay. seen in 3.6% of the subjects. No additional RSV infections were identified by RT-PCR. RT-PCR was the only assay used to identify human metapneumovirus infections, and no infections with this virus were identified. Fifteen of the respiratory illnesses in study 2 were upper respiratory illnesses only, and all were managed in the outpatient setting. Eighty percent (12/15) of these illnesses were associated with a respiratory viral infection compared to 38% (39/102) of the acute exacerbations of COPD in this study. There were six picornavirus, four coronavirus, two parainfluenza virus, one influenza virus, and one RSV infections (two dual) associated with these common cold illnesses.
