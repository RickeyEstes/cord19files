SARS-CoV nsp14 is active as AdoMet-dependent N7-MTase on short capped RNA substrates whereas the nsp16 29O-MTase requires nsp10 as co-factor Unlike flaviviruses, which use a single active site in the NS5 protein for both N7-and 29O-MTase activities [32, 42] , coronaviruses presumably encode two separate MTases that catalyze the last two steps in the formation of a methylated RNA-cap structure. SARS-CoV nsp14 has been shown to be an RNA-cap N7-MTase [17] . Sequence motifs that are canonical in 29O-MTases were identified in nsp16 [3, 19] , but the experimental verification of the MTase activity has not been reported, in contrast to FCoV nsp16, for which a rather low activity could be demonstrated [18] . SARS-CoV nsp10 was previously shown to interact with both nsp14 and nsp16 [35, 36] , suggesting its involvement in RNA capping and/or methylation. Consequently, we cloned and expressed both nsp10 and nsp16 in E. coli and purified both recombinant proteins, using their N-terminal His 6 -tag, by metal affinity chromatography. Nsp14 was expressed as a fusion protein with an intein tag at its Cterminus. The nsp14-intein product was bound to a chitin affinity column and the untagged protein was eluted after removal of the tag by DTT treatment. All three proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography. Upon SDS-PAGE, the purified proteins migrated as single bands corresponding to their expected molecular masses (nsp14: 57 kDa; His 6 -nsp16: 35 kDa, and His 6 -nsp10: 15 kDa) (Figure 2A ). The identity of the recombinant proteins was confirmed by trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry ((MALDI-TOF), data not shown). Using the purified recombinant proteins, we first conducted in vitro MTase assays on short capped RNA substrates methylated or not at the N7-position of the guanine cap ( 7Me GpppAC 5 and GpppAC 5 ). We used all possible combinations of the three proteins (nsp10, nsp14, and nsp16) and incubated them with the substrate in the presence of the tritiated methyl donor [ 3 H]-AdoMet. The extent of [ 3 H]-CH 3 transfer was quantified after reaction times of 5, 30, and 240 min by using a DEAE filterbinding assay (see Materials and Methods). Figure 2B shows that nsp14 methylated GpppAC 5 in a time-dependent manner whereas neither nsp16 nor nsp10 alone did. Apparently, the activity of nsp14 was barely influenced by the presence of nsp10 or nsp16. In addition, we observed that nsp14 did not methylate 7Me GpppAC 5 ( Figure 2C ) suggesting that nsp14 methylates only the N7-position of the cap structure. In contrast to nsp14, nsp16 catalyzed methyltransfer to neither GpppAC 5 nor to 7Me GpppAC 5 under these reaction conditions. Surprisingly, when nsp16 activity assays were supplemented with nsp10, robust methylation of 7Me Gpp-pAC 5 was observed ( Figure 2C ), but not of GpppAC 5 ( Figure 2B ). In control reactions, containing either nsp10 alone or nsp10 supplemented with nsp14 no 7Me GpppAC 5 -specific MTase activity was detected ( Figure 2C ). When the GpppAC 5 substrate was incubated with a combination of nsp10, nsp14, and nsp16 ( Figure 2B ) , the level of substrate methylation was enhanced compared to reactions performed with nsp14 alone. After overnight incubation of GpppAC 5 with the three proteins, the methyl incorporation reached a plateau and the incorporation level was twice higher than after a reaction in the presence of nsp14 alone (not shown). In contrast, no significant difference was observed between the methylation level reached after incubation of the 7Me GpppAC 5 substrate with either all three proteins or the nsp16-nsp10 pair only ( Figure 2C ). Taken together, these results suggest that, (i) SARS-CoV nsp14 methylates GpppAC 5 at the N7position of the cap guanine and indeed acts as an N7-MTase on these substrates, (ii) nsp16 acts as an nsp10-dependent 29O-MTase on 7Me GpppAC 5 , (iii) the 29O-MTase activity of nsp16-nsp10 requires the presence of a cap structure already methylated at its N7-position and (iv) nsp14 and the nsp16-nsp10 pair can perform sequential double methylation of GpppAC 5 , presumably at the N7-and 29O-positions. To determine how nsp10 stimulated nsp16 MTase activity, we co-expressed in E. coli an N-terminally Strep-tagged nsp10 and a His 6 -tagged nsp16. The bacterial cell lysate containing these proteins was incubated with Strep-Tactin beads (see Materials and Methods), in order to bind the tagged nsp10. After extensive washing, the proteins bound to the beads were analysed using SDS-PAGE. Figure 2D indicates that nsp16 remained associated with nsp10, whereas nsp16 alone was unable to bind to the beads. These data suggest that nsp10 can stimulate the MTase activity of nsp16 by direct association resulting in the formation of a nsp10/ nsp16 complex. When the intensities of the bands corresponding to nsp10 and nsp16 were quantified, a ratio of nsp10 to nsp16 of 1.1 was obtained. Correcting for the respective molecular masses, and assuming that they bind Coomassie blue dye with the same affinity, this yields a nsp10 to nsp16 ratio of about 2.3. This suggests that the complex does not contain a large molar excess of nsp10, as one might have expected due to the fact that nsp10 seems to form dodecamers under certain conditions [38] . mRNA cap N7-and 29O-site specific methylation by SARS-CoV nsp14 and nsp10/nsp16 In order to test MTase activities of nsp14 and nsp10/nsp16 on virus-specific capped RNA substrates, we synthesized a 59triphosphate-carrying RNA corresponding to the first 264 nucleotides of the SARS-CoV genome using the T7 RNA polymerase. Since the canonical T7 promoter inefficiently directs transcription of RNA beginning with an A, as is required to make transcripts resembling the 59 end of coronavirus RNAs, we used the T7 class II w2.5 promoter [43] . Additionally, we introduced a URG substitution in the 2 nd position of the RNA to increase the in vitro transcription efficiency (data not shown). The RNA was capped with [a-32 P]-GTP using the vaccinia virus (VV) capping enzyme (containing RTPase, GTase and N7-MTase activities, see Materials and Methods) in the presence or absence of the methyl donor AdoMet. The substrates GpppAG-SARS-264 and 7Me Gpp-pAG-SARS-264 were then incubated with various combinations of nsp14, nsp16, and nsp10. Reaction products were digested by nuclease P1 in order to release the RNA cap structure. Radiolabeled cap molecules were subsequently separated on TLC plates and visualized using autoradiography. The comparison with commercially available and in-house synthesized cap analogs allowed the identification of the methylation position of the cap structure. Figure 3A shows that the cap structure released after nuclease P1 digestion of substrates GpppAG-SARS-264 and 7Me GpppAG-SARS-264 RNA co-migrated, as expected, with GpppA and 7Me GpppA cap analogs, respectively. In the presence of nsp14, or the VV:N7-MTase positive control, the GpppA cap structure present at the 59 end of the RNA was converted into 7Me GpppA (left panel of Figure 3A ). We also observed that the methylation of the N7-position induced by nsp14 was weakly stimulated in the presence of nsp10, but was not influenced by the presence of nsp16. Indeed, nsp14 converts 83% of the substrate into the 7Me GpppA product, whereas in the presence of nsp10 97% of the substrate was converted, as judged by autoradiography analysis. Nsp10 or nsp16 alone did not show any MTase activity. When all three proteins are present, the substrate is fully methylated at the N7-and 29O-positions of the cap, as judged by the comparison with products generated by the bifunctional N7-and 29O-MTase domain of dengue virus protein NS5 (DV:NS5MTase), which was used as a positive control [32, 42] . The right panel of Figure 3A shows that incubation of 7Me GpppAG-SARS-264 RNA, with nsp14, nsp16 or nsp10 alone did not result in 29O-methylation of the 7Me GpppA structure. The same was true when nsp14/nsp10 or nsp14/nsp16 combinations were tested. In contrast, 29O-methylation of the cap structure of 7Me GpppAG-SARS-264 occurred upon incubation with nsp10/ nsp16, and also when all three proteins were used together. We therefore conclude that capped RNA corresponding to the first 264 nucleotides of the SARS-CoV genome represents a bona fide substrate to follow the RNA cap MTase activities of SARS-CoV nsp14 and nsp10/nsp16. Moreover, the TLC analysis allowed us to demonstrate that nsp14 indeed specifically methylates RNA cap structures at the N7-position and that nsp10/nsp16 methylates capped RNA at the 29O-position of the first nucleotide after the Figure 2 . SARS-CoV proteins nsp14, nsp16 and nsp10 purification, AdoMet-dependent MTase activity on short capped RNA and complex formation of nsp16/nsp10. Panel A: The SARS-CoV proteins nsp14, nsp16 and nsp10, purified by affinity and size exclusion chromatography (as described in Materials and Methods) were separated by SDS-PAGE (14%) and visualized by Coomassie blue staining. Lane 1 corresponds to the molecular size markers, lanes 2 to 4 to nsp14, nsp16, and nsp10, respectively. Panel B and C: AdoMet-dependent MTase assays performed on short capped RNA substrates. The different purified proteins (nsp10: 1200 nM, nsp14: 50 nM and nsp16: 200 nM) were incubated with GpppAC 5 and 7Me GpppAC 5 RNA oligonucleotides in presence of [ 3 H]-AdoMet as described in Materials and Methods. The methyl transfer to the capped RNA substrate was determined after 5-, 30-, and 240-min incubation by using a filterbinding assay (see Materials and Methods). Panel D: SARS-CoV His 6 -nsp16 protein co-expressed with strep-tag-nsp10 and His 6 -nsp16 expressed alone were incubated with Strep-Tactin sepharose. Strep-Tactin-bound protein was eluted with D-desthiobiotin and analysed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. Lane 1 corresponds to the molecular size markers, lane 2 to strep-tag-nsp10 co-expressed with His 6 -nsp16 and lane 3 to His 6 -nsp16 alone. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000863.g002 N7-methylated cap. As also observed when using short substrates, nsp10/nsp16 could only methylate 7Me GpppAG-SARS-264 and not GpppAG-SARS-264, suggesting that N7-methylation by nsp14 must precede 29O-methylation by nsp10/nsp16. We conclude that nsp14 exhibits N7-MTase activity in the absence of nsp10, whereas the latter is an absolute requirement for nsp16-mediated 29O-methylation of the cap structure. Nsp10, which was previously shown to interact with both nsp14 and nsp16 [35, 36] , modestly stimulates the nsp14-mediated cap N7-MTase activity ( Figure 3A and S1B; 10 to 15% increase of activity at a broad optimum around a 4-fold molar excess). In order to directly monitor the order of SARS-CoV RNA-cap methylation, we performed a time-course experiment using the GpppAG-SARS-264 substrate in conjunction with nsp10, nsp14, and nsp16. The results, shown in Figure 3B , indicate that methylation of the substrate indeed starts at the N7-position. Subsequently, the 7Me GpppA cap-0 structure is converted to an 7Me GpppA 2'OMe cap-1 structure. A GpppA 2'OMe structure was never observed in this assay, not even when using larger amounts of nsp10/nsp16 or nsp16 (data not shown), in agreement with the data presented in Figures 2B and 3A that show that GpppAC 5 and GpppAG-SARS-264 substrates are not methylated by nsp10/ nsp16. Thus, the N7-methylation of the SARS-CoV cap structure by nsp14 is a pre-requisite for its recognition by the nsp10/nsp16 pair, which then converts the cap-0 into a cap-1 structure by 29Omethylation. The nsp14 D 331 residue is essential for N7-methylation whereas catalytic residues of the N-terminal exonuclease domain are not The recent identification of the C-terminal domain of nsp14 as an N7-MTase [17] revealed that this replicase subunit is a multifunctional protein, since it also carries an exoribonuclease activity embedded in its N-terminal domain [16] . The interplay between these two functionalities was analyzed using mutagenesis experiments. We mutated conserved residues in both the MTase and the exoribonuclease domain to evaluate the possible interplay or long-range regulation of both activities. The conserved residue D 331 , which is presumably involved in AdoMet-binding, was mutated to alanine. In the exoribonuclease domain, we replaced conserved residues from exonuclease motifs I (D 90 XE 92 ), II (D 243 ) and III (D 273 and H 268 ) of the DE(A/D)D nuclease superfamily. All the His-tagged nsp14 mutant proteins could be expressed, except the D243A mutant, which was barely soluble. Figure 4A shows that they migrated at a molecular mass similar to that of wt nsp14 upon SDS-PAGE. We next analyzed their N7-MTase activity on GpppAC 5 using [ 3 H]-AdoMet as methyl donor. The results show that the D331A point mutation completely abolished nsp14 N7-MTase activity. This is in agreement with the hypothesis [17] that the MTase domain is located in the Cterminal half of nsp14 protein and that the conserved residue D 331 is important for N7-MTase function. In contrast, the mutations in the exonuclease domain did not significantly interfere with nsp14 MTase activity, excepted in the case of the motif I-double mutant (D 90 XE 92 ) which displayed attenuated N7-MTase activity (,2fold). This observation is in agreement with the fact that a Nterminal truncation of 90 amino acids of the nsp14 exoribonuclease domain abolished the N7-MTase activity in a yeast transcomplementation assay [17] . Thus an altered N-terminus of the exoribonuclease domain may still interfere with the MTase activity to a certain extent.
