Our strategy for generating large user-defined mutagenesis libraries of bacteriophage ΦX174 is shown in Figure 1 . The circular 5386 nucleotide genome compactly encodes 11 genes where the F and G genes encode the capsid and spike proteins, respectively (Fig. 1A) . The genome was segmented onto 14 separate plasmids, including 3 plasmids for the F gene and 2 for the G gene (Fig. 1B) . Fragment boundaries were first engineered to divide large genes, separate regulatory regions from protein coding genes, and result in fragments of similar size. Initial attempts to clone some fragments resulted in low plasmid yield, presumably due to gene toxicity. These genes were further divided and tested empirically, resulting in the final set of 14 fragments. User-defined comprehensive mutations on F and G were encoded using . Cartoon structure of the ΦX174 virion. F and G proteins are organized into pentamers and are the only exposed proteins in the mature virion. B. A linear schematic of the circular ΦX174 genome showing the size and location of the synthetic genome fragments. The location of mutated residues in genes F and G are indicated. C. An oligo pool containing all mutagenic oligos for genes F and G was generated and used in Nicking Scanning Mutagenesis for the generation of saturation mutant libraries for genes F and G. D. Golden Gate cloning was used to assemble the mutant genomes, which were transformed into XL1-Blue competent cells (Agilent) and plated on susceptible E. coli C cells. The resulting plaques were sequenced. E. Linear schematics depicting some of the possible mutant libraries that can be generated using the workflow and existing libraries. nicking mutagenesis with a single unamplified oligo pool containing all 11,860 mutagenic oligonucleotides (Fig. 1C ). ΦX174 mutant genomes were reconstituted from individual plasmids using Golden Gate cloning and transformation into a host E. coli strain (Fig. 1D ). Harvested phages contained all possible nonsynonymous mutations in the F and G genes depending on the mutagenized segments used for Golden Gate cloning (Fig. 1E ). We sought a reverse genetics system for ΦX174 wherein the virus chromosome was segmented and encoded on individual vector plasmids. Our method of construction closely followed that for the assembly of human coronavirus NL63 (Donaldson et al. 2008) , where each plasmid contained unique BsmB1 type IIS restriction endonuclease sites flanking unique five nucleotide overlaps of wild-type (WT) ΦX174. This architecture allows for faithful and easy assembly of the complete genome via Golden Gate cloning. The ΦX174 genome was separated into 14 separate nontoxic fragments by PCR and cloned into vector plasmids where genes were separated from their promoters and larger genes were segmented (full sequences for all plasmid inserts are given in Supplemental Note S1). The segments ranged from 129 to 634 base pairs in length, with necessary additional truncations of genes D and A. ΦX174 phage could be reconstituted by digesting pooled plasmids with BsmB1, ligating inserts overnight, and transforming into electrocompetent E. coli C Figure 2 . Structural view of potential epistatic interactions between F and G libraries. A. Pentameric complex between F and G shown in surface view. For both F and G, one monomer is shown as a ribbon color-coded according to the saturation mutagenesis library prepared in this work. B. Close-up of interaction surface between the F3 sub-library of F protein (green ribbons) and G2 sub-library of G protein (purple spheres). C. Distance mapping between alpha carbons in F and G crystal structure. Residues within 10 angstrom are colors red, 10-20 are black, and >20 are blue. Euclidian distances calculated from F-G crystal structure. Heatmap shows that many opportunities exist for close proximity (interactions) both within and between fragments.
