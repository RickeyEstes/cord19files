We collected 43,169 events from the NEMA administrative database, covering the period from January 2000 to December 2009. Of these, 115 and 3,079 were defined, respectively, as disasters and MCIs that occurred in Korea. There were 2,286 (72.3%) cases of disasters and MCIs in rural areas, which is approximately 2.6 times greater than the 879 (27.7%) cases that occurred in urban areas. The incidence of technical disasters/MCIs was approximately 12.7 times greater than that of natural disasters/ MCIs (2,960 cases vs 233 cases). With regard to both disasters and MCIs, transportation crashes were the most common cases. In an analysis of the seasonal factors, both disasters and MCIs occurred more frequently in the summer (June-August) and the winter (November-February). With respect to the provincial factor, the Gyeonggi province showed the highest frequency of disasters (27 cases, 23.5%) and MCIs (606 cases, 19.7%), followed by Seoul with 17 cases (14.8%) of disasters and 343 cases of MCIs (11.1%) and Gyeongnam with 5 cases (4.4%) of disasters and 269 cases of MCIs (8.7%) ( Table 2) . From 2000 to 2009, both disasters and MCIs showed a tendency to increase in number over time, but there is no significant time trend, although the frequency of incidents and the number of casualties were directly proportional in MCIs (Fig. 1, 2) . As for natural factors, general floods were the most common type of disaster and MCI with 125 cases (61.0%), followed by flash floods with 47 cases (20.2%) and tropical cyclones with 24 cases (10.3%). The number and the frequency of injuries and deaths were on the same order. For disasters only, general floods were the most common type (17 cases, 68.4%), followed by tropical cyclones (4 cases, 15.4%) and flash floods (3 cases, 11.5%). The number and frequency of injuries and deaths were on the same order. For MCIs, the number and frequency of occurrence and the number of injuries and deaths were the same as those of the total ( Table 3) . As for technical factors, road crashes were the most common type of disaster and MCI with 2,326 cases (78.6%), followed by fire with 221 cases (7.5%) and others incidents such as isolations of closed space, escalator incident, rippling incident, leisure place incident with 166 cases (5.6%). The number and the frequency of affected and deaths were on the different order for disaster and MCI. For affected victims of disaster only, road crashes were the most common type (2,369 persons, 48.3%), followed by mass gatherings (1,499 persons, 24.9%), fires (991 persons, 16.5%). For dead victims of disaster, fires were most common type (258 persons, 35.9%), followed by road crashes Table 4) . The crude mortality rates for disasters and MCIs nationwide were 2.36 per 100,000 people and 6.78 per 100,000 people, respectively. The crude injury incidence rates per 100,000 people for disasters and MCIs nationwide were 25.47 and 152, respec-tively (Table 5) . For disasters by province, Ulsan showed the highest injury incidence rate (11.15 per 100,000), followed by Jeonnam (7.67) and Gangwon (7.09). For MCIs, the rate for Gangwon was 23.34 per 100,000 people, followed by Jeju (18.5) and Jeonnam (17.4) .
