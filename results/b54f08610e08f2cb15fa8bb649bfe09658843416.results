We employed the proposed method to evaluate how the experimental dataset is clustered, when using different values of k. While there may be many different criteria to select the number of clusters to be employed, in this work, we examine the results that are obtained employing three values that we consider interesting: (i) k = 6 which correspond to the number of different kingdoms in the selected dataset, (ii) k = 17 which corresponds to the number of different phyla in the dataset, and (iii) k = 35 which corresponds to the total number of classes in the selected dataset. The length of the PSD of each sequence to be compared was 4,100. Figure 3 depicts the results obtained when the dataset was grouped into six clusters. It can be noted that the majority of the Chordates (blue-edge squares) are grouped together in C-2, a small proportion of them (the Bat Myotis davidii, two copies of the Yak Bos grunniens and the second copy of the Spotted Green Pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridis, are grouped in C-4 along with a plant (the second copy of the Castor oil tree Ricinus communis), and the rest are scattered in C-3 and C-6. It is remarkable that all of the Tracheophytan plants (green-edge squares) with the exception of Castor Oil tree R. communis are grouped in C-1 while the Chlorophyta plants (mostly Picoplanktons defined by green-edge circles) are grouped in C-6 along with other organisms. The formation of two separated groups for the plants may be explained by the fact that despite belonging to the same kingdom, these phyla share very little morphology (Simpson, 2006) . Note that the all of the Ascomycota fungi (yellow-edge squares) are grouped together in cluster C-3, while the single organism of the Basidiomycota phylum (yellow-edge circle) is clustered in a separate group. All Arthropods (blue-edge right oriented triangles) are contained in the cluster C-5.
