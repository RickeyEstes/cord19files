The descriptive statistics for outpatient and inpatient visits and corresponding period and season data are shown in Table 1 . Compared with women, the RRs for inpatient and outpatient visits in men were 1.31 (p,0.0001) and 1.15 (p,0.0001), respectively. Furthermore, when divided into 4 age groups, the highest RRs for inpatient and outpatient visits were among the elderly group (i.e. $65 years) followed by the child group (0 -18), the adults aged 45-64 group and the adult aged 19-44 group. For the period effect, there were increased outpatient visits (RR: 1.29, P,0.0001) since 2005 and inpatient visits (RR: 3.30, P,0.0001) since 2006 when compared with patient visits in 2000. The peak seasons for asthma inpatient and outpatient visits in Taiwan were spring (5.1/10,000 person-season) and winter (149.6/10,000 person-season), respectively. Table 2 shows the RRs of outpatient health service use with respect to exposure to air pollutants in the four age groups following adjustments for sex, period and quartiles of air pollutants by the generalized estimating equations model. Relative to the respective lowest quartile of air pollutants, the adjusted RRs of the outpatient visits in the highest quartile were 1.10 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.16; P-trend = 0.013) for CO, 1.10 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.18; P-trend = 0.015) for NO 2 , 0.94 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.99; P-trend = 0.016) for O 3 , and 1.20 (95% CI:1.13, 1.27; P-trend ,0.0001) for PM 10 in the child group. For adults aged 19-44, the adjusted RRs of the outpatient visits were 1.13 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.23; P-trend = 0.078) for CO, 1.17 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.31; P-trend = 0.002) for NO 2, 0.88 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.94; P-trend,0.0001) for O 3 , and 1.13 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.21; P-trend ,0.0001) for PM 10 . The adjusted RRs of the outpatient visits in the adults aged 45-64 were 1.15 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.26; P-trend = 0.003) for CO, 1.19 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.30; Ptrend = 0.0002) for NO 2, 0.93 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.98; Ptrend = 0.028) for O 3 , and 1.10 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.18; Ptrend = 0.001) for PM 10 . The adjusted RRs for the elderly outpatient visits across quartiles of air pollutant level were 1.00, 1.02, 1.07, and 1.12 (P-trend = 0.003) for NO 2 and 1.00, 1.04, 1.06, 1.10 (P-trend = 0.006) for PM 10. There was no significant association between SO 2 and outpatient visits in any group. The use of inpatient health services in relation to levels of air pollutants by different age groups is shown in Table 3 . The adjusted RRs for the child inpatient visits across quartiles of CO level were 1.00, 1.70, 1.92, and 1.86 (P-trend = 0.0001) after multivariate adjustment by sex, year and other air pollutants. There were no significant linear associations between inpatient visits and air pollutants in other age groups. The use of inpatient health services increased with time as shown in Fig 1. In general, there were trends of increasing asthma outpatient visits in the children's group (Fig. 1A & B) . In 2003, there was an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong and nearly became a pandemic event [16] . During this period, inpatient visits dramatically decreased in all age groups. After the SARS outbreak, the rates of inpatient visits have increased with time since 2006, especially in the child and the elderly groups (Fig 1C & D) .
