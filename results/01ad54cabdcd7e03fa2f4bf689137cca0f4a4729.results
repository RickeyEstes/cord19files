A total of 537 MERS patient records were retrieved and included in the study. The mean age of these patients was 55 AE 17.9 years (range 1-109 years), and 41.4% of patients were aged above 60 years. Two-thirds of patients were male, 73.9% had a comorbidity, 10.4% were healthcare workers, and 46.5% had severe illnesses. Other characteristics are reported in Table 1 . The mean time from the onset of symptoms to MERS-CoV diagnosis was 5.6 AE 4.4 days (range 0-36 days). The median time from onset of symptoms to MERS-CoV diagnosis was 4 days (IQR 2-7 days). Among the 537 symptomatic MERS patients, 39.5% were diagnosed within 3 days, 75.6% within 7 days, and 90% within 10 days after symptom onset. The unadjusted RRs for delays in the diagnosis are reported in Table 2 . Older patients (RR 1.42, p = 0.039), non-healthcare workers (RR 1.74, p = 0.001), patients with a severe illness (RR 1.22, p = 0.031), patients with an unknown source of infection (RR 1.84, p = 0.001), and patients who had been in close contact with camels (RR 1.74, p = 0.002) were associated with a greater number of days from symptom onset to MERS-CoV diagnosis. After accounting for confounders (Table 3) , source of infection remained a significant predictor that increased the time interval to a confirmed diagnosis after symptom onset (Figure 1) . Specifically, the adjusted RR of delays in the diagnosis was independently associated with an unknown source of infection (aRR 1.68, p = 0.005) and those in close contact with camels (aRR 1.58, p = 0.018). The adequacy of the final model was compared between the negative binomial and Poisson regression models. The log likelihood (negative binomial À1482.4; Poisson regression À1545.3) and the deviance (negative binomial 0.383; Poisson regression 2.514) indicated that the negative binomial model was superior to the Poisson model. All the adjusted and unadjusted RRs presented in this section were produced with the negative binomial regression model.
