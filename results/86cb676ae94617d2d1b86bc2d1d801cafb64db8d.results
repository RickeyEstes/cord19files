In this study, 23 normal male volunteers and a collective of randomly selected frozen BAL samples were retrospectively studied without preliminary selection of patients and pathologic states. For further analysis from this collective, known smokers, nonsmokers, and patients with AIDS were selected. In addition, a selection of patients in whom a welldocumented diagnostic was available was specifically analyzed. Clinical data from the normal volunteers and these selected patients are summarized in Table I . Cell repartition between macrophages, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear neutrophils was within the normal values in the normal volunteers. BAL supernatants obtained from normal volunteers (Table II) and from patients with various pathologic conditions (Table III) specifically expressed ACE, APN, and DPP IV activities. In the patient population, dipeptidase activity on his-leu was controled to ensure that low levels of ACE activity were not caused by his-leu degradation (Table III) . To compare ACE, APN, and DPP IV kinetic properties in BAL fluid and plasma, the effect of the specific inhibitors lisinopril, actinonin, and diprotin A, respectively, was analyzed. Lisinopril inhibited the enzymatic activity of the soluble ACE in two BAL and two blood samples (Fig. 1, A) . The respective ICs0 values were 0.2 rtmol/L for the enzyme from the blood and 0.5 txmol/L for the enzyme from the BAL fluid. However, the K M values (0.08 mmol/L) measured in controlled CF concentration from the x-axis intercept of the Lineweaver and Burk plot and substrate inhibition (starting at 0.5 mmol/L substrate concentration), a characteristic of many carboxypeptidases including ACE, 14 were identical for the enzymes of blood and bronchoalveolar origin. The amount of inhibitor necessary to inhibit half of the activity (IC50) of both serum and BAL ACE activities was higher than postulated by the inhibition constants. This can be explained by the high substrate concentration necessary for evaluation of ACE in vitro, because it has been shown that inhibition decreases with a high S/K M ratio) 2 '15 ACE activities between serum and BAL supernatants (n = 23, r = 0.08) and between BAL supernatants and BAL cell extracts (n = 22, r = 0.08) from the normal volunteers were not correlated. In the patient population, soluble ACE activity was increased when lymphocyte content in the BAL was increased (p < 0.05) ( Table IV) , independent of the number of granulocytes. Actinonin and diprotin A similarly inhibited blood and BAL enzymes (Fig. 2, A and B) . APN activity was inhibited by actinonin in BAL fluid (1.12 U/ml) and serum (9.88 U/ml) (Fig. 2, A) , and DPP IV activity was inhibited by diprotin A in BAL fluid (1.14 U/ml) and serum (20,43 U/ml) (Fig. 2, B) with ICs0 values of 0.5 p, mol/L and 7 txmol/L, respectively. In the patient population, soluble APN activity was markedly elevated when the relative proportion of granulocytes was increased (Table IV) , and that of DPP IV was slightly elevated when an increased proportion of lymphocytes was observed (Table IV) , independent of the number of granulocytes, whereas these activities were not measurable in samples with normal cellular repartition. However, no strict correlation between BAL cellular composition and supernatant enzyme activities could be observed. In some BAL fluid containing a determination. Two normal serum samples or two lavage supernatants were preincubated for 10 minutes at 37 Â° with decreasing concentrations of lisinopril; substrate was then added, and ACE activity was determined as described. B, K M determination. Decreasing concentrations of z-phe-his-leu were added to either two normal serum samples or to two supernatants of BAL, and ACE activity was measured. The arrow indicates substrate inhibition. very high proportion of either granulocytes or lymphocytes, the activities of APN, ACE, and DPP IV were not elevated. In some samples with high levels of these enzymatic activities, the respective proportions of the corresponding cells were not increased. Some samples with high levels of APN actMty also expressed increased levels of DPP IV, but in other samples, only one of these enzymatic activities was elevated. Thus the relative proportion, or even the absolute number of the three classes of cells evaluated, was not the exclusive factor determining relative levels of enzymatic activity, but other undetermined factors were likely involved. To examine potential clinically relevant factors, we evaluated several distinct groups (clinical data in Table I ) of disorders (Fig. 3, A, B, and C) . Patients with sarcoidosis (Fig. 3 , A, group B) had significantly elevated levels of ACE activity, but an elevated level of this enzyme was also found in patients with blood malignancy (Fig. 3 , A, group G). A normal level of ACE activity was found in the other pulmonary disorders, including interstitial pneumopathy (sarcoidosis excluded), infection, neoplasia (groups C to F) when comparison was made with normal volunteers (group A). No specific condition could be found for patients with ACE activity values below the normal range. APN activity was increased in some samples of pulmonary infections (Fig. 3, B , groups D and E) and DPP IV activity in some samples in all groups, except for samples from patients with blood malignancies (Fig. 3, C) . In BAL samples from a small group of patients with sarcoidosis (n = 4), APN activity was found to be in the normal range (0.15 U/ml), whereas DPP IV activity was increased (0.55 U/ml) in accordance with results obtained with high lymphocyte counts (Table IV) . To analyze the effects of two known modulators of the immune system, the effect of AIDS pathology or of current smoking (more than 10 cigarettes per day) was evaluated (Table V) . It was concluded that neither condition alone importantly altered the level of the proteolytic enzymes studied. However, smokers did exhibit a lower ACE activity in BAL fluid when compared with nonsmokers (p < 0.05). When the aminopeptidase activities were evaluated in situ in cells from BALs, APN and DPP IV (Fig. 4, A and B) were detected. Immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal anti-ACE (9B9) and anti-macrophage (CD68) antibodies demonstrated that ACE was expressed by bronchoalveolar macrophages (Fig. 5) . However, the number of cells that stained positive for ACE in smears was not correlated with ACE activity in cell extracts (results not shown). ACE immunostaining was also observed exclusively in macrophages in bronchoalveolar cells obtained from a sample with a high lymphocyte ratio (45% macrophages, 50% lymphocytes, CD4+/CD8 + = 0.3) (not shown). Human epithelial cells both from bronchial (BEAS-2B) and alveolar origin (A549) expressed APN and DPP IV activities as well as -y-GTP (a specific marker of epithelial cells used as an internal control) but not ACE activity. BAL macrophages expressed APN, DPP IV, and ACE activities but not ~-GTP activity (Table VI) .
