Each ED sample was routinely tested using a rapid antibody assay (BinaxNOW, Alere, Waltham MA, USA), DFA, and viral culture by the BAMC clinical laboratory (data not shown). All seasonal influenza A samples were previously identified by the local epidemiology laboratory as influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes, respectively, as per their standard protocol (data not shown). Influenza B samples were similarly identified by the epidemiology laboratory. All 12 influenza A H1N1 seasonal viral samples were confirmed by the Luminex RVP assay as influenza A H1. Similarly, all 12 influenza A H3N2 seasonal viral isolates were confirmed as influenza A H3 by the RVP assay. Two additional samples collected at the BAMC ED were identified by the RVP as influenza A (no-subtype) and were classified as novel H1N1 influenza A, although this was not confirmed by PCR or microarray. Six of the 20 ED samples were identified by the Luminex RVP assay as positive for virus: 2 influenza A no-subtype (as discussed above), 2 rhinovirus, 1 parainfluenza 3, and 1 metapneumovirus. In addition, all 15 influenza B, 5 adenovirus, and 4 parainfluenza 3 samples from the epidemiology laboratory were also confirmed by the Luminex RVP assay. Fourteen of the 20 ED samples, plus the 3 samples from the epidemiology laboratory with no virus detected, and the 5 Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial samples were used as the 22 negative controls for both the influenza A and influenza B calculations (see Table 1 A total of 3 false-positive (positive by the Lucigen system but negative by the gold standard Luminex RVP assay) influenza A and 6 false-positive influenza B results were observed with the PyroScript influenza tests. In the case of influenza A, all samples not identified by the RVP assay as influenza A are considered as true negatives for calculation of the influenza A specificity. Conversely, all samples not identified by the RVP assay as influenza B are considered as true influenza B negatives. Thus, the specificity of the PyroScript influenza reagents are 50/53 (94.3%) for influenza A and 84/90 (93.3%) for influenza B tests.
