Faecal cultures from all the scouring lambs in all the farms (n = 240) were positive for E. coli and most of them for Cryptosporidium spp. However, PCR assays yielded negative results for enterotoxigenic or verotoxigenic E. coli strains and for Rotavirus, Coronavirus and Salmonella. C. jejuni was isolated only in one farm. The results of case fatality rate (%), serum endotoxin level (ng/ml) and concentration of fibrinogen (mg/dl) in plasma in the different groups of lambs are displayed in Table 1 . The first two parameters were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the treated lambs. However, no difference was found for plasma fibrinogen level between the treated and the untreated group. The occurrence of the main pathological findings in the treated and untreated deceased lambs is shown in Table 2 . The patients in both groups presented some common pathological findings, as catarrhal gastroenteritis and the typical reactivity pictures in the lymphoid organs, with enlargement and hyperplasia. Nevertheless, certain lesions in other systems appeared with different incidence in the two groups. The results of the microbiological study from the samples obtained at the necroscopy revealed the presence of E. coli, Proteus spp. and, scarcely, Cryptosporidium spp. The frequency of mixed infections of E. coli and Proteus spp. is indicated in Table 2 .
