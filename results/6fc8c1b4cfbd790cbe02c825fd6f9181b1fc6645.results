Between 11 and 14 May, the call centre received 583 calls concerning swine flu, of which 349 received home care advice and 40 received information only. 45 patients gave permission for their details to be passed to us. Of these, we interviewed 33. 32 participants were interviewed within two weeks of their contact with NHS Direct; the remaining participant was interviewed after 16 days. Our participants included 19 women (58%), had a median age of 33 years (range: 19 to 79), and were predominantly white British (n = 24, 73%), with the remainder being 'mixed White' (4, 12%), Indian (2, 6%) and 'other Asian,' Black African or Turkish Cypriot (1 each, 3%). Three participants had called NHS Direct on behalf of a relative.
