During the 2015 Korean outbreak, we collected blood and respiratory secretion samples from 14 MERS patients with a wide range of clinical severity, from mild febrile illness to fatal pneumonia . The patients were classified into four groups based on disease severity as previously described . Briefly, Group I (n = 2) included patients with mild febrile illness who recovered without any treatment. Group II (n = 3) comprised of patients who developed mild pneumonia without hypoxemia. Group III (n = 4) and Group IV (n = 5) included infectious cases that resulted in severe pneumonia or were fatal, respectively. Detailed clinical characteristics and immunological responses were previously described . We measured the concentration of sDPP4 proteins in plasma and sputa from the patients and healthy controls by ELISA. The sDPP4 level in the plasma of MERS patients (474.76 ± 108.06 ng/ml) was significantly lower than those of healthy controls (703.42 ± 169.96 ng/ ml) (Fig. 1A, left panel) . The levels of sDPP4 were relatively variable and not significantly associated with age or gender in normal controls (Supplementary Table 1 ). To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating a decrease in the sDPP4 protein level in patients experiencing acute viral infection. All the MERS patient groups displayed a statistically significant decrease of plasma sDPP4 levels compared with healthy controls (Fig. 1A, right panel) . Although samples from Group IV fatal cases showed the lowest value (360.50 ± 111.93 ng/ ml), there was no statistically significant difference among the patient groups. sDPP4 levels in sputa samples (83.53 ± 72.57 ng/ml) were much lower compared with plasma samples, and there was no significant difference among the patient groups (Fig. 1B) . The kinetic changes of sDPP4 levels in plasma and sputa showed personal variation without notable trends during the acute phase of infection (Supplementary Table 1 ). We could not found any correlation between sDPP4 level and disease severity. Given that sDPP4 is capable of suppressing MERS-CoV infection by acting as a decoy receptor, we assessed the ability of sDPP4 to suppress the entry of MERS-CoV. The percent inhibition of viral entry by 250 and 1000 ng/ml of sDPP4 was approximately 14% and 24%, respectively ( Fig. 2A) . A concentration higher than 8000 ng/ml of sDPP4 is required to achieve 50% inhibition of pseudotyped lentivirus infection, indicating that physiological levels of plasma sDPP4 observed in MERS patients may not be sufficient to resist MERS-CoV entry. Consistently, sDPP4 within the physiological range failed to induce a significant reduction of viral plaques in a plaque-forming assay using MERS-CoV (Fig. 2B ).
