The secondary sources identify 134 unique individuals, all but five of whom can be identified by name. Four types of attribute are assigned to these nodes: gender, location (global north or south), organisation type and organisational role. Attributes have been identified through an internet search of institutional websites, LinkedIn and related online resources. Role and organisation type are recorded for the period of the crisis. The total number of nodes given at the bottom of Fig. 2 is slightly lower due to the anonymity of five individuals whose gender and role could not be established. Looking at this distribution of attributes across the whole network one can make the following observations in relation to how prominently different characteristics are represented: I. Females slightly outnumber males in the social science category but there are twice as many male 'scientists other' than female. They are a combination of clinicians, virologists, epidemiologists and other biomedical expertise. II. There are just nine southern based nodes out of a total of 134 and none of these are policy makers or practitioners. This is racially and geographically a northern network with just a sliver of West African perspectives. These included, Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr, veteran Ebola campaigner and current Mayor of Freetown, four academics from Njala University and development professionals working in the Sierra Leone offices of agencies such as the UNFAO. III. Although 'scientists other' only just outnumber social scientists this is heavily skewed by one of the eight interaction nodesthe Lessons for Development Conferencewhich was primarily a learning event and not part of the advisory processes around the response. Many individuals who participated in this event are not active in any of the other seven interactions. If we remove these non-active nodes from the network, you get just 23 social scientists compared to 32 'scientist other'. The remaining core policy network of 77 individuals appears to be weighted towards the biomedical sciences.
