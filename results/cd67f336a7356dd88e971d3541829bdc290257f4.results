There were 3,897 Ebola confirmed cases in Liberia as of July 26, 2015 (Fig 1) . The weekly number of incident confirmed cases ranged from 0 to 364; 364 incident cases were reported during the week of September 1 to September 7, 2014. Montserrado County had the largest number of cumulative confirmed cases in the country (1,978 cases). In Sierra Leone, there were 9,896 confirmed cases as of July 5, 2015 (Fig 2) . The weekly number of incident confirmed cases ranged from 3 to 578 with the largest number reported during the week of November 24 to November 30, 2014. The capital city of Freetown (Western Area Urban District) had the largest number of cumulative confirmed cases (2,508 cases). Guinea had 3,325 confirmed cases as of July 26, 2015 (Fig 3) . The weekly number of incident confirmed cases ranged from 1 to 171, with the largest number of reports occurred during the week of December 15 to December 21, 2014. The Macenta prefecture had the highest number of reported cumulative confirmed cases (713 cases). To be conservative, we considered an epidemic to be subcritical when the upper bound of the 95% credible interval for R dropped below 1.0. In Liberia, the median R ranged from 0.9 to 4.6 between March 23, 2014 and October 5, 2014 (Fig 4) . The estimate of R was subcritical on October 26, 2014; although the median R estimates after November 30, 2014 are below 1.0, the upper bound is greater than 1.0. In Sierra Leone, the median R ranged from 0.6 to 5.9 between May 25, 2014 and January 18, 2015 (Fig 5) . The time-varying estimates of R reached subcriticality in Sierra Leone during the week ending on January 18, 2015 to February 1, 2015. These estimates are consistent with a previous report that the epidemic in Sierra Leone was subcritical as of January 18, 2015 [19] . In Guinea, the epidemic was not subcritical from March 2, 2014 through July 19, 2015 (Fig 6) .
