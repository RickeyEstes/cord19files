After elimination of unsuitable images (example shown in Figure 1 ), the satellite imagery data consisted of 26, 15 and 13 hospitals for Mexico, Argentina and Chile respectively. We considered four recorded variables (the numbers of vehicles in the parking lot, on the street, and along the hospital border, and the occupancy or fill rate), thereby resulting in 104, 60 and 52 variables respectively. There were 2890 satellite images from January 2010 to May 2013, and all images were used in the analysis. The mean and median numbers of parking lot spaces by country were as follows: Mexico (mean 195, median 155), Argentina (144, 112) and Chile (159, 91). The mean weekly parking lot occupancy rate is shown in Figure 2 . Based on the monthly ILI activity and average number of cars in the parking lot, peaks in parking lot volume appeared to either precede or follow peaks in percent ILI in some cases. For example, ILI activity peaked in the months of September, June and July for 2010, 2012 and 2013 respectively for Chile. In contrast, hospital peak occupancy months were August, March and May respectively. Similarly, for Mexico, hospital peak occupancy was observed in September, May and February, while ILI activity peaked in August, December and January. The trends observed for Argentina were not as consistent. Note that the influenza season typically runs from May to October, and October to May in the Southern and Northern hemispheres respectively. So for most years, for each of the countries, the peak occupancy month fell within the influenza season. Recency, Fits and Predictions. In Table 1 , we present various values of recency (defined as the most recent data observations given by n 2 t to n, where t is the recency value and n is the current time point) and the resulting normalized root mean squared error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient between the fitted/predicted values and the percent ILI from PAHO for Chile, Argentina and Mexico. In most cases, the normalized RMSE agreed with the Pearson correlation coefficients. Based on the recency values considered, high correlations between the ILI and fitted/predicted data corresponded to low RMSE values. In addition, smaller recency values appeared to achieve the best fits and predictions based on the correlation and normalized RMSE. The highest correlation and lowest RMSE value pair for the model fits was observed separately at recency values of 4, (4 and 5) and (4 and 5) for Chile, Mexico and Argentina. Note, the model fitted using all the observed data from the initial to the current week ( Figure 3 ) had the lowest correlation and the highest normalized RMSE for the fitted models. The model fitted with a recency value of 4 ( Figure 4 ) had a better fit compared to the model shown in Figure 3 . This was consistent across all countries. The fitted models with fewer data points captured the peaks and ILI trend better than the model based on all observations. The correlations and normalized RMSE appeared to depreciate with long-term predictions. number of hospitals, suggesting there was more data available. However, although Chile had the least number of hospitals, the RMSE and correlations were sometimes better than that for Mexico. This suggests that the performance of the models could partially be explained by the quality of the data and differences in trends across countries rather than the number of observations/images used. Similar observations were made for recency values less than 10. Hospital Variables. Occupancy for each hospital was represented by the fill rate, number of vehicles in the parking lot, on the street, and along the hospital border. At each week, the elastic net model selected between one and four variables. The number of cars in the parking lot appeared to be the dominant variable (i.e. most significant model coefficient) across all countries. For example, the number of cars in the parking lot of a general care hospital located in the Arica and Parinacota Region had the most significant coefficient for Chile for most weeks when the entire set of observations ( Figure 3 ) and also when the most recent set of observations were used in fitting (as shown in Figure 4 ). The second most significant coefficient for most weeks was the fill rate of a hospital located in the Metropolitan Region of Chile. The fill rate was also the second most significant variable for the models developed for Mexico and Argentina. Similar to Chile, the hospitals with significant coefficients were located in urban regions specifically, Mexico City for Mexico and Buenos Aires, Ushuaia, and Mendoza for Argentina. The location of the most dominant hospitals in urban areas could be partially explained by the increased likelihood of owning a car in an urban/metropolitan region compared to a rural region. For all three situations, there was no statistical significant evidence (P 5 0.391 to 0.9141) to suggest that hospital parking lot usage was different during and after these disasters.
