As of May 28, 2013, 131 laboratory-confi rmed human cases of avian infl uenza A H7N9 infection had been offi cially recorded in mainland China. Of those, 123 patients had to be admitted to hospital for medical reasons and were included in our analyses. Four of the other eight individuals were diagnosed after they had already recovered from mild illness, and four who had mild illness were admitted to hospital for observation (one had been identifi ed through ILI surveillance). 71 (58%) of the 123 individuals who had to be admitted to hospital were aged at least 60 years, and 87 (71%) were male (table 1) . Table 2 shows estimated overall fatality risk and risk of other adverse outcomes. Fatality risk was higher for individuals aged 60 years or older than for . 71 (66%) of 108 patients for whom detailed clinical information was available required mechanical ventilation, and 83 (75%) of 110 were admitted to ICU. We used multiple imputation to account for missing data for dates of ICU admission for one patient and for mechanical ventilation for 23 patients, and censored in 17 patients who were still in hospital as of May 28. We estimated that risks of ICU admission (p=0·08) and mechanical ventilation (p=0·0067) were higher for patients aged 60 years or older than for younger patients (fi gure 2, table 2). We recorded some evidence that disease progressed or resolved faster in patients younger than 60 years than in older individuals (fi gures 1, 2), but the small sample size meant that we did not have suffi cient statistical power to warrant further investigation. When we estimated the fatality risk of patients admitted to hospital on the basis of information available on diff erent dates, we noted that the estimated risk gradually decreased (fi gure 3). Uncertainty was initially substantial, but decreased with time (fi gure 3), because of the increasing number of cases and follow-up of individuals admitted to hospital. We estimated that 23 (95% credible interval [CrI] seven to 58) symptomatic individuals infected with avian infl uenza A H7N9 sought medical care at ILI sentinels in Shanghai up to May 28, on the basis that two cases were identifi ed there by ILI surveillance. Additionally, we estimated that 40 (seven to 129) sought medical care at ILI sentinels in Nanjing on the basis that one case was identifi ed by ILI surveillance. With method 1, we estimated that about 0·75% of individuals with symptomatic 2009 infl uenza A H1N1 pandemic virus infection sought medical care. With the assumption that a similar proportion of symptomatic individuals infected with avian infl uenza A H7N9 would have attended ILI sentinels, we estimated that about 3020 (95% CrI 900-7800) sympto matic infections had occurred in Shanghai and 5310 (880-17 300) in Nanjing (appendix). Pro-rata extrapolation on the basis of 40 total hospital admissions in Shanghai and Nanjing, as of May 28, suggested that 27 000 (95% CrI 9530-65 000) symptomatic infections might have occurred throughout the country as of May 28. This number corresponds to a symptomatic case fatality risk of 160 (63-460) per 100 000 symptomatic cases. About 21% of outpatient visits in the internal medicine, paediatrics, and emergency departments in Shanghai, and 11% in Nanjing, occurred in sentinel ILI sites. With method 2 and allowing for this coverage, we estimated that about 107 (95% CrI 33-273) symptomatic infections had occurred in Shanghai and 367 (61-1200) in Nanjing (appendix). Pro-rata extrapolation on the basis of number of hospital admissions in these cities (as in method 1) suggested that 1500 (95% CrI 470-4050) symptomatic infections might have occurred throughout the country as of May 28. This number corresponds to a symptomatic case fatality risk of 2800 (1000-9400) per 100 000 symp tomatic cases.
