Of the 2594 children screened for participation, 876 (33.8%) were enrolled. Reasons for nonenrollment included ineligibility (24.8%), refusal (33.2%) and other reasons (42.0%) (e.g. ED staff workload, discharged before consent obtained, critically ill children). Nasal swabs were collected from 827 (94.4%) enrolled (60.2% male) children; median age was 27.7 months (interquartile range 13.9-60.3 months). Parent-reported receipt of an influenza vaccine in the preceding 12 months occurred in 8% of children in the study. Ten swabs were not tested because of poor sample quality; hence, 817 children were included in this analysis. Overall, 740 (90.6%) of 817 specimens were positive for any organism. Four hundred ninety-seven (60.8%) of the 817 swabs had at least one virus; 411 (50.3%) of 817 had only one virus and 86 (10.5%) of 817 had two or more viruses detected. The most commonly detected viruses were hRV (27.0%) and RSV (16.5%) (Supplementary Table 1 ). Six hundred sixteen (75.4%) of the 817 swabs had at least one bacterial pathogen identified; 232 (28.4%) of 817 tested positive for only one, while 384 (47.0%) of 817 had two or more bacteria detected. The most commonly detected bacteria were M. catarrhalis (53.4%), S. pneumoniae (46.5%) and NTHi (29.6%) (Supplementary Table 1 ). In contrast, only ten specimens were positive for M. pneumoniae and two for C. pneumoniae; these were not considered further in the analysis. Both viruses and bacteria were codetected in 423 (51.8%) of 817 specimens, and of these, 67 swabs (15.8%) tested positive for two or more bacteria and two viruses together. Univariate analyses of associations between child characteristics and virus-bacteria codetections identified age, gender, child care attendance, siblings and enrolling season for inclusion in regression models ( Table 1 ). Factors that remained significantly associated with codetection in the final model (likelihood ratio Ï‡ 2 = 0.32, p 0.569) were age (aOR for age <12 months = 4.9, 95% CI 3.0, 7.9; age 12 to <24 months = 6.0, 95% CI 3.7, 9.8; age 24 to <60 months = 2.4, 95% CI 1.5, 3.9), male gender (aOR 1.46, 95% CI 1.1, 2.0), child care attendance (aOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4, 2.8) and winter enrollment (aOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3, 3.0). Table 2 presents the unadjusted and adjusted (for age, season and antibiotics in the past 7 days) associations between individual viruses and codetection with respiratory bacterial pathogens. Of note was that RSV was significantly associated with NTHi, S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis and S. aureus (Table 2) . Given the associations between RSV and each bacterium, we constructed a model to identify predictors of RSV that included all four bacteria of interest, age, season and antibiotics in the past 7 days. In the final model, NTHi (aOR 1.9 (95% CI 1.2, 2.8), age (<12 months: aOR 7.5, 95% CI 3.5, 16.3; 12 to <24 months = 5.9, 95% CI 2.7, 12.8; 24 to <60 months = 3.6, 95% CI 1.7, 7.7) and autumn enrollment (aOR 4.3, 95% CI 2.4, 7.7) remained significantly associated with RSV detection. Associations with season are presented in Fig. 1
