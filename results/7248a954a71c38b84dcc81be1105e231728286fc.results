During the study period, 125 patients fulfilled the study inclusion criteria. Of these, 89 (71%) survived ICU admission. The remaining 36 (29%) patients died on the ICU. Baseline characteristics of the study cohort are shown in Table 1. Nonsurvivors were older. No significant difference was found between survivors and nonsurvivors in terms of sex, body mass index, smoking status, or comorbidities. Mechanical ventilation was primarily due to pneumonia in 54% (48/89) of survivors and 69% (25/36) of non-survivors (p=0.11). Nonsurvivors had significantly higher APACHE II and SOFA scores and had a higher rate of vasopressor use within 24 hours of ICU admission. Active infection was found in 44 (35%) of the cohort, with no significant difference being found between survivors and non-survivors. The following pathogens were considered to be associated with pneumonia: methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (n=14); Acinetobacter (n=9); Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n=6); Pseudomonas (n=5); extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organism (n=4); Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=3); Stenotrophomonas (n=3); and Aspergillus species (n=3). The median arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 )/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) ratio was significantly lower in non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors had numerically lower serum albumin and higher BNP, although the results were not statistically significant. Survivors and non-survivors had similar median field scores. Pulmonary function test results were available for 54 (43%) of the cohort. The median FEV 1 /FVC ratio was <0.70, and no significant differences between survivors and nonsurvivors were found for median FVC and FEV 1 . Echocardiographic findings were available for 64 (51%) of the cohort. Cor pulmonale was diagnosed in nearly half of the patients. However, the survivor and non-survivor groups showed no difference in terms of left ventricular systolic function or the proportion of patients with high RV systolic pressure. Clinical outcomes in the cohort are shown in Table 2 . Table 3 shows the results of the univariate and multivariate analyses of risk factors predicting ICU mortality. The following cut-off values were identified via inspection of locally weighted scatterplot smoothing curves: age ≥65 years, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio <180, PaCO 2 <52 mm Hg, serum albumin <3.0 g/dL, BNP ≥330 pg/mL, and field score ≥2 (Supplementary Figure S1) . Based on the β coefficient values observed in model 1, a TDL-Vent score comprising the following factors was proposed: (1) age ≥65 years (+1 point); (2) vasopressor use (+1 point); and (3) PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio <180 (+1 point). This model had acceptable discrimination (AUC, 0.74) and calibration (Hosmer and Lemeshow chi-square, 14.74; p=0.06). Figure 1A shows the Kaplan-Meier survival curves, as stratified according to the TDL-Vent score. The 60-day mortality rates for scores ranging from 0 to 3 were 11%, 27%, 30%, and 77%, respectively (logrank test, p<0.001). The AUC of the TDL-Vent score for predicting ICU mortality was 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63-0.80). This was larger than the AUC for the APACHE II score (0.63; 95% CI, 0.54-0.72) and SOFA score (0.62; 95% CI, 0.53-0.71) (Figure 2 ). The cut-off score for predicting mortality based on the maximum Youden' s index was ≥2, with a sensitivity of 44% and a specificity of 93%. In model 2, BNP was included as an additional variable in the regression model, since pulmonary hypertension is associated with poor prognosis in chronic pulmonary tuberculosis 16, 17 and BNP is a non-invasive marker of pulmonary hypertension 18, 19 (Table 3 ). In accordance with the β values in this model, the following modified TDL-Vent score was developed: (1) vasopressor use (+1 point); (2) PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio <180 (+2 points); and (3) BNP ≥330 pg/mL (+1 point). The model had acceptable discrimination (AUC, 0.76) and calibration (Hosmer and Lemeshow chi-square, 54.66; p=0.69). For modi- fied TDL-Vent scores ranging from 0 to ≥3, 60-day mortality rates were 0%, 21%, 33%, and 57%, respectively (log-rank test, p=0.001) ( Figure 1B) . The AUC of the modified TDL-Vent score for predicting ICU mortality was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.64-0.82) (Figure 3 ). The cut-off score for predicting mortality was ≥2, with a sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 71%. Table 4 shows the clinical outcomes of study patients, as stratified according to the TDL-Vent scores from models 1 and 2.
