Both major-groove and minor-groove triple interactions are required for the Z1 PRF activity of DU177 A comparison between DU177 and several representative À1 PRF pseudoknot stimulators ( Figure 1A -F) revealed a consensus AACAA sequence in the loop 2 of three short stem 1-containing pseudoknots ( Figure 1C -E). Furthermore, both PEMV-1 PK and DU177 contain an unusual Hoogsteen AU base pair, formed between loops 1 and 2, to bridge the helical junction. We thus examined if DU177 could function as a À1 PRF stimulator when it is positioned downstream of a slippery sequence. To this end, the À1 PRF activity of DU177 was measured and compared with those of several well-characterized pseudoknot stimulators available in our laboratory. The results, shown in Figure 1G , indicate that DU177 can act as an efficient À1 PRF stimulator in vitro. The À1 PRF efficiency stimulated by DU177 was comparable with that of the minimal IBV pseudoknot (IBVm-PK) and was in the range of 50%. This value was higher than those of MMTV-PK (24%) and the other two AACAA-containing pseudoknots, BWYV-PK and SRV-PK (21% and 34%, respectively). In addition, DU177 possessed substantial À1 PRF activity in vivo (data not shown). Therefore, the high À1 PRF activity and the well-resolved structure of DU177 (33) . The nucleotides in DU177 are numbered according to those in ref. (33) . The common AACAA sequences are highlighted by gray shadow, the unusual Hoogsteen AU base pairs are boxed, and the adenines stacking and tertiary interactions are represented by filled circles and dotted lines, respectively. (G) The 12% SDS-PAGE analysis of the À1 PRF assays of several viral RNA pseudoknots, including a minimum IBV-PK (IBV m -PK), MMTV-PK, SRV-PK, BWYV-PK and DU177 RNA (22, 25, 29, 32, 33) . Each pseudoknot was incorporated into a pRL-SV40-based reporter, assayed as described in the 'Materials and Methods', and the translated proteins corresponding to the 0-frame and À1 frame products were labeled as indicated. Please note that a negative control without insertion of a pseudoknot only showed background À1 PRF activity (data not shown). make it a good model molecule for dissecting the structural determinants within a pseudoknot for the stimulation of À1 PRF. A structural feature found in several À1 PRF pseudoknot stimulators, which involved stacking of the loop 2 adenines in the minor groove of stem 1 in a pseudoknot, was also identified in DU177 (33) . The residues 166-168 of DU177 were thus mutated, and the resulting mutants (C166U, A167C, A168U and L2-UU in Figure 2A ) still possessed substantial À1 PRF activities ranging from 50% to 30% ( Figure 2B, lanes 2-5) . Similarly, mutagenesis on loop 1 nucleotides 103 and 105 generated mutant L1-ACA with a DU177-like À1 PRF activity (compare lane 1 with lane 6 in Figure 2B ). Therefore, the À1 PRF activity of DU177 is not very sensitive to nucleotide identity in the 3 0 portion of its loop 1. As base-triple interactions were shown to be important for À1 PRF activity in several pseudoknots (22, (25) (26) (27) (28) 32) , we disrupted the three major-groove triples and the two minor-groove triples by making mutations on loops 1 and 2 of DU177, respectively. As shown in Figure 2B (lanes 7-9), the À1 PRF efficiencies of both mutants (L1-CCC and L2-GU) were reduced dramatically to below 5%, whereas the CCC/GU mutant, with all five base triples impaired, lost its À1 PRF activity to essentially 0%. The A173G mutant was then made to destroy the crucial Hoogsteen AU base pair that helps in anchoring the interhelical triplex. Similar to what was observed in CCC/GU mutant, this single mutation wiped out À1 PRF activity completely ( Figure 2B , lane 10) and is consistent with the involvement of triplex formation in the stimulation of À1 PRF activity of DU177.
