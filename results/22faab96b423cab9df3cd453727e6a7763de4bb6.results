The study group included 97 patients, 52 boys and 45 girls; the average age in the group was 56 months. The presence of comorbidities was established in 90 children (92.78%), including respiratory system diseases in 25 cases, cardiac diseases in 21 cases, neurologic diseases in 13 cases, and neoplastic diseases in 9 cases. Immunosuppression was identified in 11 patients (11.34%). The details are provided in Table 1 . Positive test results were achieved in 74 patients (76.3%). The presence of a viral factor was established in 61 samples (82% of all positive results); bacterial factors were found in 29 samples (39% of all positive results). The presence of the genetic material of a single pathogen was found in 34 children (45% of all positive results). The details of the analysis are presented in Table 2 . On the basis of the obtained results, 5 groups of patients were established: When comparing these groups, no differences were found in terms of age, day of material collection in relation to hospitalization time, or the necessity of ICU stay. Radiological image analysis was not sufficient to unambiguously diagnose the etiology of pneumonia or respiratory infection. The presence of airflow obstruction was significantly higher in patients with a viral etiology ( = 0.0011). On admission 54% of children with negative real-time PCR results had elevated procalcitonin levels. This proportion is significantly higher when compared to patient with established etiology ( = 0.0186). Such difference was not observed while comparing proportion of patients with markedly elevated CRP levels (>50 mg/dL). The prevalence of increased procalcitonin levels (>2 ng/ml) was higher in patients without established etiology. The difference is of statistical significance. Such differences were not observed when comparing number of patients with increased CRP levels. Airflow obstruction was found in 44 patients (45%); 75% of them had viral etiology of pneumonia. The difference was of statistical significance ( = 0.0011). The most frequently identified pathogen was RSV in 23 children (23.7%), and rhinovirus (RH) was found in 19 patients (19.6%), adenovirus (AdV) in 11 (11.3%), cytomegalovirus (CMV) in 10 (10.3%), and Pneumocystis jiroveci (PNP) in 9 (9.3%). Purely bacterial etiology was established in 8 patients (8.2%). The details are presented in Figure 1 . Relations were found between age and the presence of individual microorganisms: infections of RSV etiology were more frequent in younger children (median age 10.5 months versus 42 months; = 0.0133); airflow obstruction symptoms were also more frequent in this group ( = 0.0008). In children under the age of one, the dominant pathogen was RSV, which was found in 32% of patients in this age group. 56% of all positive results for RSV occurred in children in their first year of life. Blood cultures were performed in 75 children, in 62 cases they were sterile (82,67%), bacterial flora growth occurred in 13 cases, and in 3 (4%) cases it was pathological (S. aureus, Serratia sp., and E. coli). Respiratory aspirate cultures were performed in 64 children, they were sterile in 15, physiological respiratory tract flora growth was achieved in 28 cases, and in 23 it was pathological; in 8 of these cases the results were confirmed with multiplex real-time PCR tests. Nasal smear cultures were performed in 58 children, they were sterile in 15, and the presence of pathological flora was found in 17 cases (29.31%); in 5 of these cases the results were confirmed with multiplex real-time PCR tests. Detailed results of microbiological analyses of patients with at least one positive microbiology results are presented in Table 3 . In the group of children with negative results of multiplex PCR tests, blood cultures were positive in 3 cases (E. coli, Serratia, and S. aureus), tracheal aspirate cultures were positive in 7 (in 4 of them pathological flora was grown), and nasal smear cultures indicated the presence of pathogenic flora in 5 cases (see details in Table 3 ). Test results enabled the implementation of targeted therapy in 13 patients; details are presented in Table 4 .
