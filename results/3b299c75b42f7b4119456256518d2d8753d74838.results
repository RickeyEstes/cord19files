Of the 735 patients, 285 (38.8%) displayed evidence of viral infection, 163 (57.2%) of whom were males and 122 (42.8%) were females. Among the 285 patients, 331 viruses were detected because 44 (15.4%) patients were coinfected with two respiratory viruses and 2 (0.7%) were coinfected with three respiratory viruses ( table 1 ). The most common viral infections were HRV 122 (42.8%), followed by Flu A 47 (16.5%), RSV 42 (14.7%), HCoV-OC43 25 (8.8%), AdV 22 (7.7%) and hMPV 15 (5.3%). The newly discovered viruses WUV, KIV, Boca and hMPV were detected in 43 (15.1%) of the patients with RTI (table 1) . Of the 285 patients, 167 (58.6%) respiratory viral infections were detected in infants aged <2 years (table 2) . Among these infections, Boca was responsible for 11 (3.9%), hMPV for 7 (2.5%) and KIV for 3 (1.1%). Regarding the other viruses, HRV was responsible for 64 (22.5%), RSV for 36 (12.6%) and HCoV-OC43 for 11 (3.9%) infections. It was interesting to note that 20 (7%) of the Flu A infections were in patients aged >30 years. Overall, the majority of RTI, reaching 202 (70.9%), were among children â‰¤ 5 years of age (table 2) . The distribution of viruses detected in relation to hospital admission is shown in table 2 . The majority of the patients admitted to wards had HRV infections (n = 68, 23.9%), followed by patients with Flu A infections (n = 35, 12.3%). Most of the children were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for HRV (n = 43, 15.1%), followed by RSV (n = 23, 8.1%). Furthermore, 11 (3.9%) of the patients with viral respiratory infection were admitted to the intensive care unit due to HRV, followed by Flu A (n = 6, 2.1%). These viruses were most commonly detected in NPS (104 samples, 30.1%), followed by NPA (99 samples, 28.7%), BAL (87 samples, 25.5%) and TA (55 samples, 15.9%; table 2 ). Table 3 shows that the majority of the infections caused by the investigated respiratory viruses affected the LRT (251 infections, 88.1%) rather than the URT (80 infections, 28.1%). Pneumonia and bronchiolitis were the most frequent reasons for hospitalization (170 infections, 59.6%). The prevalence of respiratory viral infections was highest during the period from October to February and then declined to the lowest level from July to September ( fig. 1 ). The incidence of newly discovered viral infections was highest during the months of January, February and October. Positivity for WUV and hMPV peaked in February [3 (1.1%) and 7 infections (2.5%), respectively] and Boca peaked in March (5 infections, 1.8%). KIV presented consistent numbers from October to January (1 infection, 0.4%). The other respiratory viral infections were generally present throughout the year, reaching a peak during the winter months from October to February.
