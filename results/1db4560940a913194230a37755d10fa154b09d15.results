Characterisation of the IFITM genes in the genomes of chicken and duck The IFITM response to influenza infection has not been examined in vivo in any avian species. We therefore resolved to identify and annotate these genes in the chicken and duck genomes, examine their evolution in vertebrates and determine their expression after infection with either LPAI or HPAI viruses. This would allow the evolution of the IFITM gene family and their response to influenza infection to be compared with mammals and between chickens and ducks. This analysis would highlight similarities and differences that may be correlated with susceptibility to infection by this group of viruses. With only the IFITM3-like, IFITM5 and part of the IFITM10 genes annotated in the chicken genome we had to first identify the genomic locations of other chicken IFITM genes (if any) and identify the orthologous genes on the relevant scaffolds in the sequenced duck genome. The locations of the genes in the chicken genome (Galgal4; GCA_000002315.2) were determined to be clustered on Chr5 as follows: cIFITM1: 1592913-1593904; cIFITM2: 1598390-1599631; cIFITM3: 1596326-1597707; cIFITM5: 1600790-1601575 and cIFITM10: 13520526-13526834. The chicken IFITM locus was previously described by Smith et al. [28] although the true orthology with mammals was uncertain. With respect to the avian gene nomenclature, IFITM1 has been annotated as 'chIFITM3' by these authors and IFITM3 was called 'chIFITM1'. Aside from IFITM5, only partial duck IFITM gene sequences could be identified in the duck genome (BGI_ duck_1.0; GCA_000355885.1) using the chicken sequences as probes in any Blast homology searches. The complete IFITM1 gene was identified in the duck genome using the chicken sequence based on a Genewise prediction and the full coding sequence was confirmed by 5'-RACE. The complete cDNA sequences for duck IFITM2, 3 and 10 required cloning by 5'-RACE experiments to complete the 5'-end of each sequence. The IFITM5 gene was also confirmed by sequencing of the genomic locus. Analysis of the protein sequences using the SMART algorithm showed that both the chicken and duck proteins share the same double transmembrane domain structure and the highly conserved CD225 domain, as found in other species [22] (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). Comparison of duck and chicken IFITM protein sequences shows varying degrees of sequence identity: IFITM1 40 %, IFITM2 68 %, IFITM3 75 %, IFITM5 92 % and IFITM10 92 %. (All duck sequences have been submitted to the public databases under the following accession numbers: IFITM1: GenBank-KF584226; IFITM2: GenBank-KF584227; IFITM3: GenBank-KF584228; IFITM5: EMBL-HG764554; IFITM10: GenBank-KF584229).
