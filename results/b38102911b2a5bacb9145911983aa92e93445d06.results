Demographic characteristics of the participants are summarized in Table 2 . Positive affect did not change before and after stress. However, negative affect increased significantly from preto post-stress. Analysis of repeated measures of peripheral markers revealed significant differences between time points for ACTH (x 2 (7) = 24.8; p = 0.001), cortisol (x 2 (7) = 34.5; p < 0.001), norepinephrine (x 2 (7) = 47.7; p < 0.001), and epinephrine (x 2 (7) = 41.0; p < 0.001) ( Fig. 1A-D) . Plasma IL-6 (x 2 (7) = 38.2; p < 0.001) and log 2 normalized signal intensity for IL-6 extracted from gene expression data are presented in Fig. 2 . Comparison between baseline (0 min) and stress samples (30 min) revealed a total of 49 pathways that significantly changed (p < 0.05) ( Table 3) . When comparing stress (30 min) and recovery samples (60 min), 36 pathways were significantly changed ( Table 4 ). The parametric p-values and the geometric means for all genes identified in the pathways of Tables 3 and 4 can be found in Supplementary file 1. Eight pathways were identified as common to each of these analyses (bold highlight, Tables 3 and 4) involving 210 unique genes. This represents 36 and 45% of the unique genes common to these eight pathways. We are able to dissect out the gene expression changes in each of the pathways (Supplementary file 2). The Janus kinase-signal (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway is central to the stress response and looking at the expression changes between baseline and stressor (0 and 30 min) we find 42/56 genes are showing !2-fold increase in expression. Then 31/42 of these genes are down-regulated (!2fold change) during the recovery (30-60 min). A further 11 genes in this pathway, unchanged from baseline to stress, are also downregulated during the recovery. Similar analytical dissection of the gene regulation for the remaining seven common pathways is given in Supplementary file 2. The transcription factors that regulate the genes in the pathways that were found to be differentially expressed were examined by over-representation analysis (Tables 5 and 6 ). The limited amount of RNA on several subjects allowed for validation of four genes by qPCR (Fig. 3) . Overall there was very good agreement of the qPCR data with the mRNA generated microarray data, in that the trends of differential expression were maintained in both.
