The study population. A total of 2,120 hospitalized cases with severe/very-severe pneumonia were enrolled across the three sub-Saharan African sites included in this study. Of these children, 439 (21%) tested positive for HRV and were subtyped. The prevalence of HRV-associated pneumonia was highest in South Africa (23%, n ϭ 210/ 911), followed by Zambia (21%, n ϭ 113/538), and was lowest in Mali (17%, n ϭ 116/ 671, P ϭ 0.020) among the pneumonia cases. Additionally, 2,284 age-frequency-matched community controls were enrolled across the sites, among whom the levels of prevalence of HRV infection (overall, 20%, n ϭ 462) were similar across the sites, including 22% in South Africa (n ϭ 212/964), 20% in Mali (n ϭ 143/725), and 18% in Zambia (n ϭ 107/686, P ϭ 0.093). There were no differences in the prevalences of HRV detection and HRV load between cases (21% and 3.6 log 10 copies/ml, respectively) and controls (20% and 3.5 log 10 copies/ml; P ϭ 0.334 and P ϭ 0.08, respectively). Furthermore, the prevalence of HRV identification, the species distribution, and the viral load did not differ between cases and controls at the individual sites (data not shown). However, among children Ͼ12 months of age, the cases had a significantly greater prevalence of HRV detection (21%) than the controls (16%, P ϭ 0.009), with the results driven by HRV-C detection (12% versus 7%, P ϭ 0.001) ( Table 1) . The seasonal circulation of the three HRV species over the full study period for cases and controls is detailed in Fig. 1 . For both cases and controls, HRV-B appeared sporadically throughout the year with no obvious seasonality pattern. Similarly, there were no obvious patterns in the circulation of the HRV-A and HRV-C species among both cases and controls; however, they were detected throughout the year. Furthermore, no obvious pattern or clear seasonal distribution of HRV infection was observed at any of the sites (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The overall prevalence for HRV ranged from 11% in August 2011 and March 2012 to 33% in August 2013 among cases and from 1% in October 2011 to 27% in January 2014 among controls during the study period. HRV clinical and molecular subtyping among community controls. Among the HRV-positive samples from community controls, 97% (n ϭ 446) were successfully amplified, 3% (n ϭ 14) failed to amplify, and 0.5% (n ϭ 2) were of insufficient volume for serotyping. Among the amplified samples, 5% were typed as enterovirus and one as echovirus and 92% as HRV. The dominant HRV species among controls were HRV-C (45%) and HRV-A (45%), and 10% were HRV-B. There were no differences in species distribution between asymptomatic controls (HRV-A, 47%; HRV-B, 10%; HRV-C, 43%) and controls with signs and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections (including runny nose, cough, wheeze, difficulty breathing, and fever) (HRV-A, 38%; HRV-B, 6%; HRV-C, 56%; P ϭ 0.066). There were no differences in demographic and clinical symptom characteristics among controls with HRV-B infection compared to those with HRV-A and HRV-C infection. Comparisons of controls to those with HRV-A and HRV-C infections showed that, other than for controls with HRV-A being more likely to be LytA positive on whole blood (10% versus 4%, P ϭ 0.012), there were no differences in demographic characteristics, HRV load, and symptoms of RTI (Table 2) . HRV was the sole respiratory virus identified in the nasopharynx in 67% of the controls with HRV infection, including 68%, 67%, and 64% with HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C infections, respectively (P ϭ 0.713) ( Table 2) . However, among respiratory virus coinfections, coinfection with parainfluenza virus (PIV) was more common among controls with HRV-C (6%) than among those with HRV-A (2%, P ϭ 0.026) ( Table 2) . Further, when the HRV types were compared among the asymptomatic and RTI controls separately, there were no significant differences for any of the demographic, clinical, or molecular markers (Table S1 and S2) . Molecular subtyping of the HRV-associated cases. Among the HRV-associated pneumonia cases, 97% of the samples were successfully subtyped, while 3% (n ϭ 11) of the samples failed to amplify, all of which had very low copy numbers (threshold cycle , with the caveat that maternal exposure must be confirmed by maternal serology for seronegative infants aged Ͻ7 months. c Underweight was defined as weight for age Յ2 SD of the median age-sex-specific WHO reference. d Premature birth was defined as gestational age Ͻ37 weeks. e Tachypnea was defined as respiratory rate Ͼ60 breaths/min for subjects aged Ͻ2 months, respiratory rate Ͼ50 breaths/min for subjects aged 2 to 12 months, and respiratory rate Ͼ40 breaths/min for subjects aged Ͼ12 months. f Fever was defined as temperature Ն38°C. g The child was completely asymptomatic for all signs of respiratory tract illness, including runny nose, fever, cough, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. h CRP was defined as levels Ն40 mg/liter, which are considered to show potential bacterial infection. Only a subset of randomly chosen controls had CRP testing conducted at the South African site. i Blood sample positive for S. pneumoniae colonization by LytA PCR. j HDP was defined as S. pneumoniae density in nasopharynx Ͼ6.9 log 10 copies/ml and/or density in whole-blood sample Ͼ2.2 log 10 copies/ml. k HRV load in the nasopharynx, expressed as log 10 copies/ml. l HRV was the only respiratory virus detected in the nasopharynx. were typed as enterovirus and closely related member of HRV. The species of samples was successfully identified in 91% (n ϭ 415) of the HRV-associated cases, among which 48%, 45%, and 7% were found to be infected with HRV-A, HRV-C, and HRV-B (7%), respectively ( Table 1 ). The distribution of HRV species differed by age group, with HRV-A (52%) being the most prevalent among infants Ͻ12 months of age, followed by HRV-C (38%) and then HRV-B (10%), whereas HRV-C (60%) was more prevalent among children 13 to 59 months of age, followed by HRV-A (38%) and HRV-B (2%, P ϭ 0.002). Similarly to the results seen with the controls, HRV-B was the least prevalent species and appeared sporadically throughout the 2-year period (Fig. 1) . This limited any in-depth statistical analysis specific to HRV-B, with no significant differences in demographic and clinical characteristics observed between HRV-B-associated cases and HRV-A-associated or HRV-C-associated cases, except that the subjects with HRV-B infection were younger (4.8 months of age) than the subjects with HRV-A infection (9.4 months, P ϭ 0.01) and with HRV-C infection (12.1 months, P Ͻ 0.001) ( Table 3) . Further species-specific analyses were limited to comparing HRV-A-associated cases to HRV-C-associated cases, with HRV-A cases being younger (9.4 months) than HRV-C cases (12.1 months, P ϭ 0.033) cases (Table 3) . Furthermore, the HRV-A-associated cases were more likely to have radiographically confirmed pneumonia (abnormal chest radiograph, defined as primary endpoint pneumonia or presence of any infiltrates) than the HRV-C-associated cases (46% versus 36%, P ϭ 0.040) and were more likely to present with concurrent diarrhea (26% versus 14%, P ϭ 0.007). In contrast, cases with HRV-C were more likely to present with wheeze (35%) than cases with HRV-A (25%, P ϭ 0.031) ( Table 3) . Among the HRV-associated cases, HRV was the only virus identified in the nasopharynx samples from 54% (n ϭ 223/415) of the cases, including 55%, 42%, and 54% of HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C infections, respectively (P ϭ 0.742). Case-control comparison of results of molecular subtyping of HRV. There were 60 different HRV-A strains, 17 different HRV-B strains, and 28 different HRV-C strains circulating throughout the 2-year period (Fig. 2) . No discernible differences were noted in the distribution of strains between cases and controls; moreover, there were no apparent differences in the distribution of strains among the three sites ( Fig. S2 to S4) . Additionally, no obvious patterns of temporal clustering of HRV species or strains were observed, with strain distributions differing on a month-to-month basis (data not shown). The HRV sequences for each of the species formed many unique clusters, with mean levels of nucleotide diversity of 82% for HRV-A (nucleotide diversity range, 45% to 100%), 80% for HRV-B (nucleotide diversity range, 53% to 100%), and 74% for HRV-C (nucleotide diversity range, 52% to 100%). The levels of nucleotide diversity did not differ among cases and controls for the different HRV species. The HRV-A and HRV-B sequences clustered with the GenBank sequences of known HRV-A and HRV-B strains, with statistically significant bootstrap support, whereas the HRV-C sequences tended to form numerous subclusters which did not always cluster closely with the GenBank sequences but which did always occur in the same monophyletic groups of known HRV-C strains. The numerous clusters and ranges of nucleotide diversities, especially in the HRV-C population, suggest considerable diversity in the strains present in the population (Fig. S2 to S4) . Among the HRV-A strains, the nucleotide similarities to the closest GenBank prototype reference strains ranged from 82.3% to 99.4% and strain identities with other contemporaneous HRV-A strains ranged from 79.8% to 100%. Among the HRV-B strains, the nucleotide similarities to the closest GenBank prototype reference strains ranged from 87.9% to 99.8% and strain identity with other contemporaneous HRV-B strains ranged from 91.2% to 100%. Among the HRV-C strains, the nucleotide similarities to the closest GenBank prototype reference strains showed much lower levels of relatedness than the other two species and ranged from 74.5% to 98.8%; however, there were high degrees of similarity with the other contemporaneous HRV-C strains, with strain identities ranging from 93.9% to 100%. No novel serotypes were identified in this study.
