Products were separated in 2% agarose gels, and Sau3AI-digested pUC 18 DNA was used as a molecular weight marker (lanes M). Sizes are given in basepairs.

Later, the levels of viral RNA in their plasma at any time during the isolation period nor showed any sign of disease. more sensitive RT-nPCR was required and viral RNA was detected less frequently. For cat H419, the FCoV infection Viral persistence in the gastrointestinal tract appeared to wane after 4 months of isolation, but through RT-nPCR viral RNA was detected in the feces even after Our findings indicate that FCoV can indeed establish asymptomatic chronic infections.

Nucleotides 026-170 of ORF7b were amplified as indicated in Fig. 1 and the PCR products were sequenced directly by cycle sequence analysis. Only those nucleotides differing from the overall consensus sequence (Cons.) are depicted. Nucleotide changes leading to amino acid substitutions are boxed. a,b and c,d represent the consensus sequences of the FCoV quasispecies in fecal samples taken from cats H324 and 419, respectively.

In a phylogenetic analysis, the FCoVs sampled from cat H324 cluster and, with the exception of FCoV sampled from cat H326, are more closely related to each other than to the FCoVs sampled from other cats. Given the overall genetic diversity in this region of the S gene among the FCoVs in the cattery, these findings support our conclusion that cats H419 and H324 carried an asymptomatic chronic FCoV infection and argue against accidental reinfections during the isolation period.
