A total of 465 people was interviewed. Of them, 96.3% had heard of the term "antibiotics," whereas 80.6% recalled having been prescribed antibiotics at least once before the interview. The 96 individuals who had never heard of the term "antibiotics" and/or had never been prescribed antibiotics were excluded from the analysis. The demographic characteristics of the 369 included participants are shown in Table 2 . Most 57.1% (210) of the participants had been prescribed antibiotics in the 2 years before the interview. Of these, 75.8% (276) had completed the entire course of their most recent antibiotic prescription, and 83.6% (305) had taken the antibiotics on time according to physicians' instructions. Of the 83 participants who did not complete the course of antibiotics, 66.3% deemed it unnecessary to complete the course, 15.7% stopped the course because of adverse effects, and 7.2% reported no clear instructions from their physicians on the need for completion. Thus, 67.1% (243) met the criteria for adherence ( Table 1) . The antibiotics knowledge score had a normal distribution, with a score of 2 most frequent (33%). Less than 30% answered all 3 (11) questions correctly. Figure 1 shows that nonadherence was associated with lower antibiotics knowledge scores with a clear dose response (P for trend < .001). Nonadherent participants had a lower mean antibiotics knowledge score (mean, 1.3; standard deviation [SD], 1.0; compared with mean, 2.0; SD, 0.9, P < .001). People with a score 1 accounted for most (58%) of the nonadherence, and this relationship persisted across all education levels (Fig 2, (Table 3) . Although a significant positive relationship was observed between subjects' education level and antibiotics knowledge score (P < .001), there was no significant difference between the prevalence of nonadherence across different background education levels (P > .05).
