This study aims to compare the efficacy of vaccination strategies between the local geo-social interaction patterns and the whole areas based on the real world networks provided by the school interaction data. The better vaccination strategies are expected to generate a lower number of infections. Another measure of how well we can contain the epidemic locally is the number of infected cases occurring outside the selected areas. If this number is zero, the local control scenarios with the selected areas are considered successfully. Otherwise, the local control scenarios are considered as failures. Figure 2 shows the design of eight vaccination strategies with six different control rates in the two networks, Thursday, October 1st 2009 in (a) and Friday, October 2nd 2009 in (b). Two networks have been reordered according to the strength of social connections to the classroom with the first infected case. The local control areas are highlighted in orange. The efficacy of eight vaccination strategies in the two networks is evaluated through infection percentage and the spatial-social extent of infection as described below.
