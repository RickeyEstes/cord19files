The negative effects of Influenza A virus infection on body weight, mortality and locomotor activity are exacerbated following chronic CS exposure. Chronic (6 months) air-and CS-exposed mice were infected intranasally with 120 HAU IAV (H3N2). Before infection (Day 0), we did not observe a significant difference in body weight among the experimental groups. The body weight of mice in both IAV-infected groups dropped significantly on days 1-3 post-infection, with a slightly more dramatic decline in the CS1Virus group (Fig. 1a ). This suggests that chronic CS-exposed mice exhibited greater mortality following IAV infection. Indeed, IAV infection in chronic CS-exposed mice produced a 14.1% reduction in survival within 9 days of infection (Fig. 1b) . As reported, there was no significant difference in the body weight and mortality between the chronic air-and CS-exposed mice 30 . We found that chronic air and CS-exposed mice infected with IAV showed significant reduction in body weight compared to corresponding controls at the end of chronic exposure or day 9 post-infection ( Supplementary Fig. 2b) . Thus, while IAV infection alone (Air1Virus) has modest effects, infection of mice following chronic CS exposure (COPD/emphysema model) significantly increases mortality. We have previously reported that mice exposed to 10 days of CS (acute exposure model) during the active phase show reduced locomotor activity associated with increased inflammation 30 . Similarly, mice exposed to chronic CS showed significantly reduced activity beginning 5 days after the first exposure that persisted for much of the exposure period 30 . In the present study, chronic CS-exposed mice infected with IAV (CS1Virus) showed a significant reduction in locomotor activity after infection that persisted for the duration of measurement (9 days post-infection; Fig. 1c-d) . Chronic air-exposed mice infected with influenza (Air1Virus) showed an initial reduction in locomotor activity 1-5 days after infection with a trough 5-6 days after infection followed by a modest recovery by day 9 after infection ( Fig. 1c-d) . Actograms clearly reveal that the CS1Virus group showed significantly reduced locomotor activity postinfection (lower right panel) when compared to Air1Virus, air-and CS-exposed mice ( Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2a) . Limiting our analysis to the dark phase reveals that the primary influence of IAV infection was a reduction in nighttime activity, which was further suppressed in those mice previously exposed to chronic CS (Fig. 1c) . The period of locomotor activity in L:D during days 1-8 post IAV infection was very similar between air and CS groups, whereas the Air1Virus and CS1Virus groups showed increased variation in period between animals although the mean was not statistically different from controls (Fig. 1e) . Analysis of behavior as a function of daily distribution (day vs. night) emphasizes the mortality and behavior in chronic air or CS-exposed mice. Data from uninfected air-and CS-exposed mice from a previous experiment were included for comparison [panels c-e; 30 ]. (a) Chronic CS-exposed mice infected with IAV showed a modest reduction in weight, marked by a decline on days 1-3 post-infection relative to air-exposed mice infected with IAV. (b) Mortality was monitored for 9 days post IAV infection. Data are representative of mean 6 SEM (n530-40 mice/group). ** P , 0.01 significant compared to Air1Virus group. Analysis of differences in survival over time was determined by a Mantel-Cox test (P , 0.68). (c) Nocturnal activity for 9 days post-infection was plotted as ambulatory counts. IAV infection reduced locomotor activity in CS-exposed mice by 70-80% during days 1-7 post-infection when compared to CS-exposed mice treated with saline. Similarly, IAV infection reduced locomotor activity in CS-exposed mice by 70-80% on days 1-2 and day 4 postinfection but only 30-45% during days 5-9 post-infection when compared to Air1Virus treated mice. Data are mean 6 SEM (n56 mice/group) for each time point. ** P , 0.01; *** P , 0.001 significant compared to control groups (air or Air1Virus); $$ P , 0.01 significant compared to air-exposed mice; # P , 0.05; # # P , 0.01; # # # P , 0.001 significant compared to CS-exposed mice. (d) Representative double plotted actograms of total cage activity from chronic air, chronic CS, Air1Virus and CS1Virus treated mice. In panel d, gray shading indicates the dark phase (ZT12-24) and activity was not recorded during body weight measurements (ZT5-6). Red arrow head indicates day 0 IAV infection and asterisks denotes the time during which the mice were infected with IAV (ZT4-6). (e) Periodogram analysis of activity in L:D during days 1-8 post IAV infection. Period was very similar between air and CS groups, whereas the Air1Virus and CS1Virus groups showed increased variation in period though the mean was not significantly different from controls. Data are mean 6 SEM (n56 mice/group). Fig. 3a-d) . Control (air) and Air1Virus infected mice were primarily active (70-80% activity) during the dark phase and less active (20-30%) during the light phase from day 2 to day 9 post-saline infusion (Supplementary Fig. 3a and c) . In three of the four groups, we detected a transient change in the distribution of activity on day 1 post-infusion regardless of treatment, suggesting that the infusion procedure acutely and temporarily altered activity ( Supplementary Fig. 3a-d) . In agreement with our previous report, chronic CS-exposed mice displayed a distribution of locomotor activity similar to air-exposed mice with the majority (70-80%) of activity limited to the dark phase ( Supplementary Fig. 3b) 30 . Following IAV infection in chronic CSexposed mice nighttime activity declined and daytime activity increased from days 3-7 post-infection such that we detected no difference between day and night activity levels by day 7 (Supplementary Fig. 3d ). By day 8-9 post-infection the CS1Virus mice showed recovery of their normal nighttime (70-80%) and daytime (20-30%) distribution of activity ( Supplementary Fig. 3d ). The negative effects of Influenza A virus infection are enhanced in BMAL1 knockout mice. To dissect the role of clock regulatory proteins in response to respiratory infection, we measured the response of BMAL1 KO mice and wild-type littermates to IAV infection. Similar to mice that had been exposed to CS, BMAL1 KO and WT littermates were infected intranasally with 120 HAU (H3N2) IAV. Before IAV infection (Day 0), there was no significant difference in body weight between WT and BMAL1 KO mice (Fig. 2a) . The body weight of WT and BMAL1 KO IAV infected mice dropped by day 2 post-infection and remained low until day 8 post-infection when compared to control mice of both strains (Fig. 2a) . BMAL1 KO-Virus infected mice showed increased mortality beginning 5 days post-infection and by day 9 all of the BMAL1 KO mice infected with IAV was deceased (Fig. 2b) . WT-Virus infected mice showed increased mortality beginning 7 days post-infection and reached a total of 38.5% mortality by day 9 post-infection (Fig. 2b ). There was a significant difference in the body weight and mortality of WT-Virus compared to BMAL1 KO-Virus infected mice. This suggests that BMAL1 plays an important role in the host response to IAV infection. Further, our data suggest that circadian disruption may enhance the severity of infection, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Locomotor activity of BMAL1 KO and WT littermates was monitored before (5 days) and after IAV infection (1-9 days post-infection). Regardless of genotype, IAV infection significantly reduced activity ( Fig. 2c -d and Supplementary Fig. 2b ). Both BMAL1 KO and WT mice showed significant reductions in daily activity on days 1-9 post-infection ( Fig. 2c -d and Supplementary Fig. 2b ). The period of locomotor activity in L:D on days 1-8 post IAV infection was very similar between all four groups, though IAV infected BMAL1 KO mice had greater variability in period relative to the other treatment groups (Fig. 2e ). Analysis of behavior as a function of daily distribution (day vs. night) emphasizes treatment and genotype specific effects ( Supplementary Fig. 4a-d) . As expected, WT-saline treated mice were mostly active during the dark phase (ZT12-24; 70-80% of total activity) while BMAL1 KO-saline treated mice appeared to be arrhythmic and displayed a more even distribution of activity, though levels were still slightly higher at night (Supplementary Fig. 4a-b) . IAV infection altered the normal distribution of daily activity in both WT and BMAL1 KO mice, though the effects were clearly more dramatic in WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 4c-d) . WT mice infected with IAV increased their daytime activity but reduced their nighttime activity, producing apparent arrhythmia marked by a near equal distribution of activity across the 24h day (50% light; 50% dark). This effect of IAV infection on daily activity was less pronounced in BMAL1 KO mice, due largely to the fact that these mice already displayed a more equal distribution of daily activity/arrhythmia. That said, within 2 days of infection mean activity was actually higher in BMAL1 KO mice during the light phase, suggesting a brief period of diurnal preference following IAV infection ( Supplementary Fig. 4d ). This effect was diminished by day 3-4 post-infection with mice becoming more active during the night 5-9 days post-infection in parallel with increased mortality. These data reveal that, though BMAL1 KO mice differ from WT mice in terms of activity distribution prior to infection (most likely due to entrainment deficits in KO mice) both strains show reduced nocturnal preference following IAV infection. Influenza A virus affects the phase and amplitude of circadian clock gene expression in the lungs. We have previously reported that core clock genes (bmal1, clock, per1-2, cry1-2, rev-erba) were rhythmically expressed in the lung of air-and CS-exposed mice both during acute and chronic CS exposure 30 . Of the known core clock genes, only rora gene expression was not rhythmic in lungs of chronic air-and CS-exposed mice 30 . The peaks of gene expression rhythms for most clock genes in air-exposed controls were similar to those previously reported 30, 31 . In both the chronic air-and CSexposed mice, the expression of bmal1, clock, and cry1 displayed nocturnal acrophases, peaking during the mid to late portion of the dark phase (ZT18-24; ZT0 5 lights on: ZT12 5 lights off) 30 . As anticipated, both chronic air-and CS-exposed mice showed peaks of per1, per2, cry2, rev-erba, and rev-erbb antiphase to bmal1 (between ZT6-ZT12) 30 . Chronic CS-exposed mice showed a modest reduction in the amplitude of bmal1 and rev-erba expression and substantially reduced amplitude of per1 expression 30 . Analysis of clock gene expression 9 days after IAV infection in air-exposed mice (Air1Virus) revealed significant rhythms of bmal1 (P , 0.001), per1, per2, cry1 and rev-erbb (P , 0.05) but not clock, cry2, rev-erba and rora in lung tissue ( Fig. 3a- Supplementary Fig. 5 and Table 1 ). Mice exposed to chronic CS and IAV infection (CS1Virus) only displayed rhythms of bmal1 (P , 0.01) and per1 (P , 0.05) expression in the lungs ( Fig. 3a- Supplementary Fig. 5 and Table 1 ). Previously reported data from air-exposed mice are shown here for comparison ( Fig. 3a- Supplementary Fig. 5 and Table 1 ). In Air1Virus infected mice, the peak expression of bmal1, per1, per2, cry1, cry2, and rev-erbb shifted to the middle of the light phase (ZT6; ZT05 lights on; ZT125lights off) and the amplitude of gene expression was altered at ZT6 when compared to air-exposed controls and chronic CS1Virus group ( Fig. 3a- Supplementary Fig. 5a -b). As in Air1Virus treated mice, expression of bmal1, clock and rev-erbb was shifted to peak at mid-day (ZT6) in CS1Virus exposed mice ( Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 5b ). However, unlike Air1Virus treated mice, the phase of peak per1 and cry2 expression returned to ZT12 and the remaining clock genes [per2, cry1, rev-erba and rora] peaked at middle of dark phase (ZT18). Together, these data support the notion that IAV induces circadian disruption in the lungs, though the effects appear to be somewhat attenuated in mice exposed to chronic CS ( Fig. 3a-b and Supplementary Fig. 5a-b) . We also determined the effects of CS with or without IAV infection on the expression of CCGs including sirt1, ahr and muc5ac in the lungs (Supplementary Fig. 5c-d) . We have previously detected a circadian rhythm of sirt1 expression that was altered by acute exposure to CS 30 . Herein we observed daily fluctuation of all three CCGs but only ahr rhythmicity was confirmed by CircWave analysis (P , 0.05). Though not statistically rhythmic in the air-exposed lungs, CircWave analysis did confirm significant rhythms of sirt1 (P , 0.05) in the Air1Virus group that was attenuated by previous exposure to CS (Supplementary Fig. 5c -d and Table 1 ). Further, we detected a shift in peak sirt1 and ahr expression from the latter portion of the dark phase (ZT18) in the air-exposed group to mid-day (ZT6) in both the Air1Virus and CS1Virus groups ( Supplementary Fig. 5d ). In addition to these phase shifts, there was an apparent increase in the amplitude of sirt1 expression following IAV infection ( Supplementary Fig. 5c ). According to CircWave analyses muc5ac was not rhythmically expressed in lung tissue regardless of treatment ( Supplementary Fig. 5c ). The effect of acute CS exposure combined with or without IAV infection on clock gene expression in the lung was confirmed by realtime monitoring of PER2::LUC expression in lung tissue explant cultures. Exposure to 0.1% cigarette smoke extract (CSE) in vitro produced a modest reduction in the amplitude and slight increase in the period of PER2::LUC expression in lung tissue explants in agreement with our previous report 30 . Viral infection (300 HAU/ ml) also significantly reduced the amplitude and increased the period of PER2::LUC expression in lung explants (Fig. 3c) . We observed comparable effects of 0.1% CSE1Virus similar to 0.1% CSE treatment alone in the amplitude and period of PER2::LUC expression in lung tissue explants (Fig. 3c ). There was a significant reduction in the period of PER2::LUC expression in lung tissue explants treated with 0.1% CSE1Virus compared to IAV infection alone (Fig. 3c) . Overall, CSE1Virus and IAV infection alone both reduced the amplitude and differentially affected the period of PER2::LUC expression in lung tissue explants. Infection with IAV increases macrophages, lymphocytes and CSmediated inflammatory responses in the lungs. As previously reported, similar levels of virus-specific antibodies were present in the blood of both Air1Virus and CS1Virus infected mice 32 . To investigate whether IAV infection after chronic CS exposure alters the inflammatory status in mouse lung, we measured the number of leukocytes in lung bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid 9 days postinfection. We observed more total cells, macrophages and lymphocytes near the end of the dark phase (ZT24) in the CS1Virus group when compared to Air1Virus, air-and CSexposed mice (Fig. 4a-c) . There was also a significant increase in neutrophils at ZT24 in chronic CS-exposed mice compared to airexposed control. That is, in the absence of infection, there was an increase in neutrophils; however, this was not observed on day 9 of infection ( Fig. 4d) . We next determined the impact of chronic CS exposure followed by IAV infection on rhythms of proinflammatory cytokine release in BAL fluid. MCP-1, IL-6 and MIP-2 levels were measured in BAL fluid at day 9 post-infection across the 24h day. The CS1Virus group showed significant increases in the expression of MCP-1 at ZT6 and ZT24 when compared to Air1Virus and air-exposed controls (Fig. 4e ). We observed a significant decline in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines MIP-2 at ZT0 and ZT12 and IL-6 at ZT12 in the Air1Virus and CS1Virus groups 9 days postinfection compared to uninfected CS-exposed mice ( Fig. 4f-g) . Chronic CS-exposed mice showed significant increases in the levels of IL-6 and MIP-2 that peaked at ZT12 compared to air-exposed controls ( Fig. 4f-g) . Overall, IAV infection dampened the total number of neutrophils, MIP-2 and IL-6 levels, while it increased the total number of macrophages, lymphocytes and MCP-1 levels by day 9 post-infection. CircWave analysis confirmed significant diurnal rhythms of both IL-6 and MIP-2 levels in BAL fluid from chronic CS-exposed mice (P , 0.01). In contrast, chronic air-exposed, Air1Virus and CS1Virus groups did not show rhythmic expression of MCP-1, IL-6 and MIP-2 in BAL fluid as confirmed by CircWave analysis. The increase in levels of cytokines that we observed on day 9 post-infection was associated with influx of inflammatory cells in the lung in CS1Virus and chronic CS-exposed mice ( We have also analyzed proinflammatory cytokine release in BAL fluid by pooling time points according to photoperiod (ZT61ZT12 5 daytime and ZT18124 5 nighttime) for MCP-1, MIP-2, IL-6 and TGF-b1. Chronic CS-exposed mice showed a significant increase in the levels of MIP-2, IL-6 at ZT61ZT12 (daytime) and TGF-b1 at ZT181ZT24 (nighttime) compared to controls (Supplementary Fig. 6a-d) . Chronic CS-exposed mice infected with IAV showed a significant increase in the level of MCP-1 both at ZT61ZT12 (daytime) and ZT181ZT24 (nighttime). The levels of other cytokines including MIP-2, IL-6 and TGF-b1 were significantly reduced in CS1Virus group compared to CS-exposed mice at ZT61ZT12 (Supplementary Fig. 6a-d) . Thus, our data show that disruption of circadian clock function in the lung was associated with augmented MCP-1 levels during IAV-induced exacerbation in chronic CSexposed mice. To further examine the role of circadian regulatory factors on host responses to infection, we determined the total number of leukocytes in the airways. Consistent with prior reports, there was a significant increase in total cells, macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils in BAL fluid from WT-Virus infected mice compared to WT-Saline treated mice (Supplementary Fig. 7a-d) . However, we were unable to evaluate immune cells in lungs of infected BMAL1 KO mice due to 100% mortality in this group by day-9 post-infection (see Fig. 2b ). Because we observed a significant increase in inflammatory cellular influx into the lung of IAV infected WT mice, we next determined the level of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in BAL fluid. WT-Virus infected mice showed a significant increase in release of www.nature.com/scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 5: 9927 | DOI: 10.1038/srep09927 30 ]. Lung tissues were harvested every 6 h for 24 h beginning at ZT0 day 9 post-infection. (a) Expression of core clock genes (bmal1, clock, per1, cry1, and rev-erba) in mouse lung tissue. CircWave analysis confirmed statistically significant rhythms of clock gene expression in Air1Virus (P , 0.05 for per1 and cry1; P , 0.001 for bmal1) and CS1Virus (P , 0.05 for per1; P , 0.01 for bmal1) treated mice.

Influenza A virus augments chronic cigarette smoke-mediated inflammation and fibrosis. Chronic CS exposure enhanced IAV induced inflammatory responses, as observed by increases in peribronchial and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration in the airways (Fig. 5a) . Mucus hypersecretion in the airways is an important characteristic pathological feature during acute exacerbation of COPD and is a key facet of inflammation-induced airway obstruction 33 . We determined the degree of mucus production in the airways of Air1Virus and CS1Virus infected mice at day 9 post-infection. Mucus-producing PAS positive cells were significantly increased in airway epithelium of chronic CS1Virus infected mice compared to Air1Virus infected mice that displayed a paucity of mucus producing cells in the airway epithelium (Fig. 5b) . Trichrome staining demonstrated significant increases in airway fibrosis in mice exposed to CS1Virus with increase in collagen deposition observed around the airways (Fig. 5c) . Further, we detected a significant increase in a-SMA levels, a marker for activated myofibroblasts observed in fibrotic lung disease, in the fibrotic regions of the lung from both air and CS-exposed mice infected with IAV ( Supplementary Fig. 9a ). These characteristic features suggest that IAV infection of mice previously exposed to chronic CS results in exaggerated lung inflammation and fibrotic airway remodeling in vivo. It has been documented that after IAV infection, epithelial damage induced by the virus could be repaired in order to completely restore lung structure and function in vivo. Clara cell specific marker, CCSP was used to identify changes that occur during virus infection in the airway bronchial epithelial cell population. At day 9 post-infection, we observed a significant decrease in the expression of CCSP positive cells in the airway bronchial epithelium of chronic CS1Virus infected mice compared to Air1Virus, air-and CS-exposed mice ( Supplementary  Fig. 9a ). Influenza A virus exaggerates chronic cigarette smoke-mediated airspace enlargement/emphysema and altered rhythms of lung function. To investigate the role of IAV-induced circadian clock disruption of the lungs and the possible impact on lung airway remodeling and pulmonary function, we examined airspace enlargement/emphysema by lung histopathologic and functional measurements in chronic CS1Virus infected mice. There was a significant difference in lung histopathological changes between chronic CS1Virus infected mice and Air1Virus infected mice 9 days post-infection, which was confirmed with measurements of the mean linear intercept (MLI; Air1Virus 43.27 6 3.31 vs. CS1Virus 62.27 6 3.20; P , 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 9b ). These data suggest that IAV infection and chronic CS exposure can synergistically enhance airway remodeling in mice. We then determined the impact of IAV infection on diurnal rhythms of lung function, including lung compliance, resistance and tissue elastance. We have previously reported that when examined as a function of time of day (day vs. night) chronic CS-exposed mice show significantly increased lung compliance and reduced elastance, but resistance is not significantly reduced 30 . When analyzed at specific time points across the day, elastance and resistance were only significantly reduced at ZT18 in chronic CS-exposed mice 30 . Lung compliance was significantly decreased at ZT12 and ZT24 in the CS1Virus group when compared to the Air1Virus group ( Fig. 6a-b ; Tables 2-3 and Supplementary Tables 1-3 ). There was a change in the phase and rhythms of lung compliance in Air1Virus group when compared to air-exposed and chronic CS1Virus infected mice ( Fig. 6a-b ; Tables 2-3 and Supplementary Tables 1-3) . However, lung resistance decreased significantly only at ZT6 in CS1Virus group as compared to Air1Virus group ( Fig. 6a-b ; Tables 2-3 and Supplementary Tables 1-3) . Tissue elastance was significantly decreased at ZT6 and significantly increased at ZT24 in the CS1Virus group when compared to the Air1Virus group ( Fig. 6a-b ; Tables 2-3 and Supplementary Tables 1-3) . Similarly, there were significant alterations in the phase and amplitude of lung resistance and tissue elastance rhythms in CS1Virus group and Air1Virus group when compared to air-exposed controls ( Fig. 6a-b ; Table 2-3 and Supplementary Tables 1-3) . Overall, when we combined the data from day (ZT6 and ZT24) and night (ZT12 and ZT18), lung compliance was significantly reduced whereas lung resistance and tissue elastance significantly increased during the dark phase (ZT12-18) in CS1Virus group compared to Air1Virus group ( Fig. 6a-b ; Tables 2-3 and Supplementary Tables 1-3) . Thus, IAV infection appeared to invert the phase of peak tissue elastance and resistance but not lung compliance such that each marker of pulmonary function peaked during the light phase (when the animal is generally sleeping; Fig. 6b ). Exposure to CS prior to IAV appeared to oppose this response, preventing the dramatic shifts produced by IAV infection. BMAL1 KO mice show altered lung function and pro-fibrotic responses. To investigate the role of the molecular clock in the Figure 4 | Chronic CS-exposed mice infected with influenza A virus show increased inflammatory cell influx and proinflammatory cytokine release in BAL fluid. Data from chronic (6 months) air-or CS-exposed mice given intranasal inoculation of either saline (control group) or influenza A virus (IAV; treatment group) at ZT4-6 are shown. Data from uninfected air-and CS-exposed mice from a previous experiment were included for comparison [panels a-d; 30 ]. The total number of inflammatory cells was determined in BAL fluid from air, CS, Air1Virus and CS1Virus infected mice on day 9 post-infection. At least 500 cells in the BAL fluid were counted to determine (a) total cells, (b) total macrophages, (c) total lymphocytes and (d) total neutrophils.

Lung compliance was significantly decreased in both WT-Virus and BMAL1 KO-Saline treated mice compared to WT-Saline and BMAL1 Het-Saline treated mice (Fig. 6c) . However, lung resistance and tissue elastance were significantly increased in both WT-Virus and BMAL1 KO-Saline treated mice (Fig. 6c) . BMAL1 KO-Saline treated mice displayed a significant increase in lung compliance and decrease in resistance and elastance when compared to WT-Virus infected mice suggesting an inherent defect in the lung mechanical properties of BMAL1 KO mice in the absence of infection (Fig. 6c) . In a separate experiment, we determined lung function at different ZT (ZT0-ZT18; n51 mice/ ZT time point) in 2-3 months old BMAL1 KO mice and WT littermates. We also performed differential cell counts in BAL fluid collected from WT and BMAL1 KO mice at all the four ZT time points. We averaged the cell counts data from different time points and found that Bmal1 KO mice had a significant increase in neutrophil counts compared to WT littermates ( Supplementary Fig. 10a ). Total cell counts and macrophage counts were not significantly different between BMAL1 KO and WT littermates (Supplementary Fig. 10a) . We measured the rhythms of lung mechanical properties in BMAL1 KO and WT littermates at different ZT time points. BMAL1 KO mice showed similar peaks of lung function measurements as air-exposed controls but each was significantly altered (reduced compliance, increased resistance and elastance) compared to WT littermates ( Supplementary Fig. 10b ). We found that BMAL1 KO mice develop spontaneous pro-fibrotic lung phenotype as they age when compared to WT littermates ( Supplementary Fig. 10c) . The development of a fibrotic-like phenotype in BMAL1 KO mice could contribute to the altered lung function we observed in these mice (Fig. 6c) . Thus, our data suggest that the clock gene activator BMAL1 may play an essential role in maintaining normal pulmonary function. Influenza A virus infection in BMAL1 KO mice further enhance the severity of virus infection resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.
