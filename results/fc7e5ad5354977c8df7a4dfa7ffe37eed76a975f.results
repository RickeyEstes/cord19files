Virus-induced CPE were not observed in cell cultures during a four-week observation period, suggesting a virus(es) had not been isolated. However, CoVs do not always cause easily discernable CPE in the cell lines used for this study, so for additional evidence of virus isolation, RT-PCR tests were performed. Coronavirus RNAs were also not detected by RT-PCR of spent cell culture media collected and tested by RT-PCR every five days, and in RNA purified from the infected cells at the terminal observation time-point (30 days post-infection). Attempts to isolate CoVs from the inoculated cell lines were thus considered unsuccessful. Out of 19 bat fecal samples, 440 bp amplicons corresponding to a conserved region of the CoV RdRp gene were generated by RT-PCR from two filtered homogenates (Figure 1 ). The sequence for both amplicons was identical and submitted to GenBank (Accession: KX663833.1). Following BLAST analyses, the consensus RdRp sequence was found to be highly similar but not identical to alphacoronavirus RdRp sequences identified in Brazilian free-tailed bats and velvety free-tailed bats (Molossus molossus) from southern Brazil [36] . The percentage of nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity ranged from 94% to 96%.
