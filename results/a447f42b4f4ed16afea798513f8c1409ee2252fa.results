Protein engineering of the Spn4A scaffold and drug delivery strategy to target secretory pathway SKI-1/S1P Our previous studies have demonstrated that Spn4A architecture can inhibit two evolutionary divergent members of the PC family (furin and PC2) [58] . We selected this novel Drosophila melanogaster serpin scaffold to engineer a novel protein-based inhibitor directed at the PC SKI-1/S1P. First, we cloned our pre-His/FLAG-tagged
