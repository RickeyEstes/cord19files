A total of 2773 patients presenting with ALRI participated in the study (no refusals). Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from all patients, of which 43 (1AE5%) tested positive for HBoV. HBoV infections were detected year-round, and the annual incidence amongst the study patients did not vary significantly (1AE5-1AE7%) during 2007-2009 ( Figure 1 ). The median age of the HBoV-infected patients was 1 year (range, 0AE3-56 years), and 46AE5% were female. The incidence of HBoV infection was highest amongst children aged <2 years ( Table 2) . Whereas bronchiolitis was only observed in patients aged <2 years, pneumonia or bronchopneumonia was the most common clinical diagnosis, regardless of age (37AE2%; Table 2 ). Only respiratory specimens were available for testing in this study, and no clinical information regarding gastrointestinal symptoms was recorded. Nineteen (44%) patients were co-infected with an additional respiratory virus (Table 3) . Co-infection with HRhV was most frequently detected (21%), followed by parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3, 4AE6%) and respiratory syncytial Table 1 . Reference human bocavirus (HBoV) strains used in this study to construct phylogeny. Shown are the name of the strain, Genbank accession number, year of isolation, country of isolation and genotype. Whether strains were included in Figure 2 (HBoV NP1 phylogeny), Figure virus (RSV, 4AE6%). One patient was co-infected with both RSV and HRhV (Table 3 ).
