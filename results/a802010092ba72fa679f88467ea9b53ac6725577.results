Although the above admission figures show growth, the average duration of stay decreased by 32.9% from 6.83 to 4.58 days per episode from 2000 to 2010 ( Figure 4 ). In particular, the reduction was reflected more in males (35.4%, 7.38 days to 4.77 days) than in females (30.3%, 6 .33 days to 4.41 days). However, we note that the number of hospital beds in Hospital Authority [9] Moreover, the total hospitalized days decreased by 17.1% (Table 1) . Table 1 and Table 2 give the relative contribution of the differences in mean length of stay, The decomposition is summarized in Table 2 . Applying equation (iv), the relative contributions of each factor are calculated as follows:  From 2000 to 2010, more than 515,000 individuals (1 million episodes) were admitted into public hospitals in Hong Kong per year ( Figure 1 ). Figure 4 ). In particular, the reduction was reflected more in males (35.4%, from 7.38 days to 4.77 days) than in females (30.3%, from 6.33 days to 4.41 days). However, we note that the number of hospital beds in Hospital Authority hospitals during the period has been reduced by 8.1% . [14] Moreover, the total hospitalized days decreased by 17.1% between 2000 and 2010 ( Table 1) . Table 2 give the relative contribution of the differences in mean length of stay, frequency of admission, and hospitalization rate by the decomposition method from 2000 to 2010. Applying equation (iv), the relative contributions of each factor are calculated as follows:
