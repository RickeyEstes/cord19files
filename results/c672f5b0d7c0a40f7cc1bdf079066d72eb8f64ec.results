To determine whether patients infected with 2019-nCoV have abnormal renal function or kidney damage, we reviewed the latest 3 studies focused on the clinical features of such patients. In these 3 cohorts, one was a familial cluster of six patients, while other cohorts contained 99 patients and 41 patients, respectively. Outcome in two relatively larger sample studies suggest that about 3% to 10% of patients infected with 2019-nCoV had abnormal renal function, including elevated creatinine or urea nitrogen. In addition, 7% of patients experienced acute renal impairment (Table   1 ). Considering the large number of infected patients, it is necessary to explore the mechanisms of abnormal renal function and to promote to take special care on such patients. As the virus frequently enters the cell by binding to cell receptors, and ACE2 has been proven to be one of the major receptors of 2019-nCoV in human body, we explored the online datasets to find out the expression level of ACE2 in urinary system. As we expected, data from CCLE and GTEx portal indicated that ACE2 mRNA expression level is relatively higher in kidney cells ( Figure 1 ). To further determine the protein expression level of ACE2 in kidney cells, we investigated the Human Protein Atlas portal to find out some details. Results of immunohistochemistry (IHC) also indicated that the expression level of ACE2 protein is significantly higher in the kidney, especially in renal tubular cells, although the mRNA expression level is not such high ( Figure 2 , Table 2 ). Unexpectedly, we also found that ACE2 expresses quite highly in testicular cells. The protein and mRNA expression of ACE2 in the testes is almost the highest in the body. Moreover, both cells in seminiferous ducts and Leydig cells showed high ACE2 expression level ( Figure 2, Table 2 ). These results indicate that testicular cells are the potential targets of 2019-nCoV. .
