The distribution of country and year of publication of the 36 studies is presented in Fig. 3 . Thirty-three studies were conducted in developed countries or regions, and two studies 52, 63 were conducted in developing countries. One study conducted by Hong Kong researchers recruited samples from nine countries, including China (Mainland China and Hong Kong), Indonesia, Turkey, South Korea, Greece, Canada, the UK, Brazil and Nigeria. 64 All studies had been published since 1985, and most studies were published in the decade from 2000 to 2009 (n Â¼ 20). Table B (see online supplementary material) summarises the design features and main findings. Ten studies were rated as high quality using the STROBE or CASP checklist, most studies were of moderate quality, and three were rated as low quality. Twenty-seven studies evaluated seasonal influenza vaccination coverage among elderly people, which ranged from 26% 35 to 84%. 33 Only seven studies reported vaccine uptake rates 75%, and 10 studies reported rates 50%. A new framework was synthesised based on all 36 studies (see Fig. 4 ). In the context of influenza vaccination behaviour among elderly people, the meaning of perceived benefits from the HBM was as same as that of positive behavioural beliefs from the TRA. Therefore, the two constructs were taken as one in the analysis. No study surveyed behavioural outcomes evaluation of the TRA, so this construct was excluded from the research framework. Attitude was also excluded as it was measured by multiplying the score of behavioural outcomes evaluation and behavioural beliefs.
