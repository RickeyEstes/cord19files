Overall, 261 individuals were enrolled, including 159 cases of CAP, 27 cases of ILI and 75 cases of volunteer. However, 10 cases of CAP were excluded (2 obstructive pneumonia, 3 pulmonary tuberculosis, 4 immunosuppressed patients and 1 sheep brucellosis). Eighty-nine patients had at least one underlying condition (Table 1) . Swab samples were available in all patients and volunteers, paired sera in 70 cases of CAP patients and in all ILI patients. Viral etiology was established in 52 (34.9%) of 149 CAP patients, in 22 (81.5%) of 27 ILI patients, as shown in Table 2 . All volunteers were virus negative. Among 58 viruses from CAP patients, 18 viruses were detected by shell-vial cell culture system, 47 viruses by NATs and 20 viruses by serological survey, respectively ( Figure 1 ). Sputum bacterial culture was performed for the clinical need in 77 hospitalized patients with CAP and results was also recorded. Six patients yield a positive result (Table 2 ). Three out of six patients were virus positive. Clinical features and severity of illness in CAP patients were summarized in Table 3 and Table 4 , respectively. Some Flu A or PIV-3 infected patients manifested hemoptysis and chest pain. Dyspnea and gastrointestinal symptoms were also common in Flu and PIV-3 positive CAP patients. Compared with virus negative patients, sorethroat and fatigue was more common, leukocytosis and neutrophilia was less common in viral pneumonia patients, although fatigue and neutrophilia had no statistical significance. It seemed that length of hospital stay was longer, intensive care requirement and 30-day mortality was higher in virus positive patients, however, there was no statistical significance. Table 5 showed the significant features associated with viral pneumonia or severe disease on multivariate analysis. On viral pneumonia model, leukocytosis was negative correlated with any virus infection. While, myalgia was included in the model for pneumonia associated with influenza infection. In the CURB-65 model, only influenza infection was found independently associated with severe disease (CURB-65 score â‰¥ 3), with P = 0.021, Odds Ratio (OR) 7.86 (95% Confidence interval [CI] 1.37-45.04). All CAP patients received antibiotics. However, few patients were prescribed for antiviral agents such as oseltamivir or zanamivir by clinician. Seven patients (two of which was virus positive) received short course of intravenous ribavirin before their admission to our hospital. Only one A(H1N1)pdm09 infected patient received oral oseltamivir before and during his hospitalization in our hospital. Finally, all but five CAP patients recovered during our one month observation. Clinical course of four CAP patients (one was Flu B positive, one was PIV-3 positive, none received antiviral drugs) went deteriorated. They denied going on hospital stay and died within 30 days after hospitalization. One COPD patient who was diagnosed with seasonal influenza A pneumonia, developed respiratory failure and denied invasive ventilation and ICU admission. Ultimately, he died.
