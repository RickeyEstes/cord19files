Patients (n = 101) (16 male and 85 female) presenting with respiratory illness symptoms were enrolled in the present study. Respiratory samples (n = 134) were collected and analyzed for the presence of viruses. The most common symptoms observed were cough (88.4%), sneezing (67.4%), and nasal congestion (58.1%). Fever was reported in 22.4% (30/134) of respiratory infection episodes (Fig. 1) . Patients were stratified into six age groups ( Table 1 ). The overall detection frequency of any viral respiratory infections was 33.3% (2/6) in individuals <24 years old, 33 Frequency of symptoms (%) (Table 1 ). Only 23.3% (10/43) of the virus-positive samples were collected from patients with febrile illness. Of the seven (5.52%, n = 134) patients presenting only with HRV (four positive for HRV-A/B and three for HRV-C) the most pronounced symptoms were cough (100%), sneezing (71.4%), nasal congestion (57.1%), watery eyes (57.1%), rhinorrhea (42.9%), and fever (42.9%) (Fig. 2) . Symptoms were similar for infections caused by HRV-A/B or HRV-C. HAdV was detected in samples from 11 (8.2%) patients presenting with a single infection and in samples from four patients co-infected with HBoV-1, HBoV-2, HCoV-229E, or KIPyV + HRV-A/B. The most frequent symptoms presented by patients infected with HAdV were cough (91%), sneezing (82%), nasal congestion (54.4%), and myalgia (36.4%) (Fig. 2) . Of the 16 (11.9%) patients infected with HBoV (considering both single and co-infections), five patients were infected with HBoV-1 (four single infections and one co-infection with HAdV) and 11 were infected with HBoV-2. Eight patients had single infections and three were co-infected with HRV-A/B, KIPyV, and HAdV. The most common symptoms observed among HBoV single-infected patients were cough (66.7%), sneezing (50%), nasal congestion (50%), and rhinorrhea (33.3%) (Fig. 2) . Clinical symptoms were similar for HBoV-1 and HBoV-2 infections. FLUVB was detected in two (1.5%) patients. A 45-year old female presenting with cough and myalgia and a 48-year old female presenting with cough, sneezing, watering eyes, nasal congestion, and sore throat. Two (1.5%) HMPV infections were detected. The first case was a 69-year old female with cough, sneezing, nasal congestion, and myalgia, and the second was a 25-year old female with cough, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and sore throat. HCoV-HKU1 was detected as a single infection in a 63 year-old male presenting with cough and nasal congestion. Co-infection with HCoV-229E and HAdV was detected in a 57year old female with cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal congestion, and myalgia. A 31-year old male presenting with fever, cough, and sore throat was infected with HRSV-A and a 45-year old female patient infected with HPIV-3 presented with cough, rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal congestion, and a sore throat. KIPyV was only detected in co-infections ( Table 1) . Peaks of viral infections were observed primarily during March (33.3%; n = 6), April (58.8% positivity; n = 17), May (33.3%; n = 9), August (30.6% positivity; n = 49), and October (41.2% positivity; n = 17). However, viruses were detected in samples all year round. There was no sample collection during the months of January and December and only one sample was collected during November (Fig. 3 ).
