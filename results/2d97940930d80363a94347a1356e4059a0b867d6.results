Both scanning electron and atomic force microscopy showed that the uninfected Vero cells were flat and without prominent form and surface ( Figure 1 ). Pseudopodia, where present, were not extensive ( Figure 1A and 1B). In the transmission electron microscopy studies (10, 11, 15) , SARS-CoV replicated very rapidly and produced large amounts of virus after 6 h of infection. The scanning electron microscopy confirmed that, for some infected cells (15 h postinfection), a large quantity of extracellular virus was present (Figure 2A , arrowheads) on the whole cell surface. However, very few virus particles were on the neighboring cell (top right), indicating a nonsynchronous infection. The scanning electron microscopy images showed a holistic view of SARS-CoV-infected cells compared to ultrathin sections in transmission electron microscopy. Another virus-induced change clearly demonstrated by using the scanning electron microscope was the proliferation of pseudopodia on the infected cells and in particular, at the edge of these cells (Figure 2A , arrows compared to Figure 1 ). At higher magnification, progeny virus particles protruded at the cell periphery ( Figure 2B , arrow). In the inset (boxed area), a virus particle was seen in the process of extrusion (arrow) after the fusion of the transport vesicle and the plasma membrane. The knoblike spikes surrounding the coronavirus were clearly visible. SARS-CoV spikes appeared short and stubby (16-17 nm) when compared to those of other coronaviruses (20 nm). This feature gave the virus a rosettelike appearance when viewed under the scanning electron microscope (arrowheads indicate extruded virus particles). The average size of the extracellular virus particles was 100-130 nm. The gold sputter coating can also increase in the diameters of the virus particles. From 15 to 24 h after infection, the virus was exported prolifically at the pseudopodia and cell surfaces ( Figure  3A -C, arrows). The surface imaging clearly showed the profuse presence of extracellular virus (arrows). High magnification scanning electron microscopy images of the SARS-CoV form and structure ( Figure 3C , arrows) appeared to correlate well with those images that used negative staining and TEM ( Figure 3C , inset). The knoblike spikes were short and stubby in the negative staining image as well. Online Figure 3D (available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol10no11/04-0195-G3.htm) shows virus particles were also exported out from the surface of the pseudopodia (arrows). A virus particle in the process of extrusion at the cell plasma membrane was captured with the atomic force microscope at 15 hours after infection. Although the proposed mechanism for export of the virus to the extracellular space is through fusion of the transport vesicle membrane at the cell surface, this process seemed to result in localized breaching at the plasma membrane, where the virus extrusion occurred ( Figure 4A, thin arrows) . Although fixed and gold-coated samples were used in this study, the atomic force microscope delivered high-resolution images. Unfortunately, the knoblike spikes for this virus were not well illustrated in Figure 4A . A threedimensional reconstruction ( Figure 4B ) shows that the virus particle was extruding from a much-thickened cell periphery (arrow). The knoblike structures on the virus surface were further confirmed by atomic force microscopy (online Figure 4C , available at http://www. cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol10no11/04-0195-G4.htm). The thickened edges of the infected cells were ruffled and appeared to comprise layers of folded membranes ( Figure 5A and 5B and online Figure 5C Virus particles (arrowheads) could still be exported out of the puffy edge ( Figure 6A, arrows) . A three-dimensional reconstruction ( Figure 6B ) of the height image in Figure 6A shows puffy fronts of the cell edge (arrows) with many virus particles just underneath the surface awaiting extrusion. The large number of progeny virus particles at the cell edge may have resulted in this thickened appearance. Virus particles (arrowheads) were pres-ent on other parts of the cell surface as well. Thick white arrow shows a clump of virus particles just underneath the plasma membrane. Closer examination of the virus-induced changes at the subcellular surfaces of the infected cells, by using the hard tapping mode under the atomic force microscope, showed the involvement of the cell cytoskeleton at late infection. In Figure 7A , gross thickening of the cell skeletal filaments was seen in the cytoplasm (arrowhead) and pseudopodia (arrows). At higher resolution, thickening of the filaments at the edge of cells was obvious ( Figure 7B , arrows). These filaments, which ran parallel to the cell edge, could be the enhanced actin filaments, and together Figure  3 .
