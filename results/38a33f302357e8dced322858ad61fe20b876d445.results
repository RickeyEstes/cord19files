Out of the 400 survivors invited to participate in the study, 377 of them agreed to take part in the study. However, 19 failed to completely fill the questionnaire. Thus, complete data on 358 EVD survivors were analysed. Table 1 gives a summary of EVD survivors' sociodemographic and healthrelated characteristics. More than half (n = 194, 54.2%) of survivors were within the ages of 18-33 years and close to two-thirds (n = 223, 62.3%) were females. Also close to three -fourths (n = 262, 73.2%) of survivors perceived their health to be fair/poor.
