Of the 3 cases of confirmed case, 2 were male and 1 was female. The age ranged from 39 to 57 years. 2 patients had diabetes and hypertension respectively. 1 was a common case, 2 were severe cases. 1 case had history of Wuhan contact and the other 2 cases had no clear epidemiological history (Table 1 ). The main laboratory findings of COVID-19 patients were normal or slightly low white blood cells and lymphocytes, elevated inflammatory indicators such as interleukin-6, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; and normal myocardial markers ( Table 2 ). the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

In non-COVID-19, other disease, medical staff and health control groups, there were a few cases reactive for 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG, all the cases were single reactive for IgM or IgG. The sensitivities of IgM and IgG were 100%, as for specificities of IgM and IgG were all over 97% (Table 4 ). Of 225 non-COVID-19 cases, 2 cases were detectable for influenza A RNA and 2 cases were detectable for influenza B RNA, respectively, 4 cases were detectable for adenovirus DNA, 17 cases were detectable for mycoplasma pneumonia DNA (Table   4 ). We also compared the anti-2019-nCoV antibodies values distributions in different groups. The anti-2019-nCoV IgM levels in non-COVID-19 was higher than that of healthy control group, the difference was statistically significant (Table 4 ; The area under the curve was 0.988 and 1.000, and the best cut-off value was 10.14 and 15.99, respectively ( Figure 3 ).
