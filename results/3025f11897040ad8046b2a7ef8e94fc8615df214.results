A total of 120 571 specimens were collected during the entire study period of January 2004 to December 2013. We examined the age profile of 9 952, 1 509, 5 012, 1 467, and 3 391 cases with laboratory-confirmed infections of influenza A, influenza B, RSV, adenovirus, and parainfluenza, respectively. During the pandemic period of 26 April 2009 to 24 April 2010, the positive rate of A(H1N1)pdm09 was high among school children and adults but low in the elderly. After the pandemic, the positive rate of A(H1N1)pdm09 became low in school children and adults. Compared with those in the pre-pandemic period, a markedly decrease of positive proportions in the pandemic was observed for nearly all the non-pandemic viruses; RSV and A (H3N2) slightly increased in the 0-4y age group, but only RSV reached statistical significance (Table 1) . After the pandemic, seasonal A(H1N1) almost completely disappeared from the Hong Kong population, and positive proportions of A(H3N2) were higher than those in the pre-pandemic, but for influenza B the proportions were slightly lower in all age groups. Age-specific epidemic curves of influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza B, RSV, adenovirus and parainfluenza are shown in Fig 1. Seasonal subtype A(H1N1) infected many children aged below 18 years in all the study years but only widely circulated in some years (2006, 2008, and 2009 ). A(H3N2) was frequently isolated from all age groups except 2006, with high numbers observed in the age groups of 0-4y and 65y above. Both A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) usually showed a two-peak annual seasonal pattern, and one broad peak was occasionally observed during the study period. Influenza B had a single broad annual peak in most years but remained at low level in 2004, 2009, 2011 and 2013. The first wave of A(H1N1) pdm09 occurred around September 2009, and the second wave around February 2011. We also found that school children were more exempted from the second wave, while in the elderly more infections occurred in the second wave as compared to the first wave. RSV was characterized with broad peaks spanning over one or two months (Fig 1) . Two peaks of RSV cases were observed among young children each year, but no clear patterns were observed in adults due to the limited number of cases. All the viruses demonstrated annual and semiannual seasonal patterns across age groups (Fig 2) . Annual cycle was dominant throughout the study period for A(H3N2) and B, but semiannual cycle became dominant for A(H1N1) in early 2009 before the pandemic outbreak. In contrast to seasonal influenza viruses, A(H1N1)pdm09 showed a biannual seasonal pattern, corresponding to the two waves in 2009 and 2011. RSV and parainfluenza showed a gradual shift from annual to semiannual cycle, especially in young children. The seasonal pattern of adenovirus was least clear among all the viruses. Compared to the pre-pandemic period, the MWE of A(H3N2) in all age groups dramatically increased during the post-pandemic period for the winter epidemics, but earlier peaks were observed for the summer epidemics (Fig 3) . Similar changes were also observed in RSV, with the only exception of the 65y above group. Influenza B, adenovirus and parainfluenza showed slightly earlier summer peaks but delayed winter peaks in most age groups during the post-pandemic period.
