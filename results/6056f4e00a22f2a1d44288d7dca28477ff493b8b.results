Ion Transport In Vitro Na+ flux ( Table 1) . Under short-circuited conditions, ileal epithelium from TGE-infected animals failed actively to transport sodium either in the presence or in the absence of glucose. In the absence of glucose under basal conditions, Ine,Na in TGE was negligible and significantly less than the control Inc,Na, which was absorptive; after administration of 30 mM glucose, Inc,Na in TGE tissue did not change significantly and remained negligible, in contrast to a significant increase in Inct Na in control tissue (P < 0.001). Under basal conditions, unidirectional fluxes (] ms Na and Ism Na) did not differ significantly between TGE and control tissue, but after administration of glucose, Ims Na in TGE was significantly less than the control value and the increment was greater in control tissue (P < 0.02). In the presence of 10 mM theophylline, added after glucose, Inct Na in TGE was ab- sorptive, although no significant changes in unidirectional or net fluxes occurred. In control tissue, theophylline caused an increased Ism Na (P < 0.01) and a decreased Inc,Na (P < 0.05), although control lnct" remained significantly greater than TGE Inet Na . CI-flux ( Table 1 ). In the basal period, lms cl , Ism CI, and lne,c:l were lower in TGE compared with control tissue, lnel ci being negligible. Glucose did not significantly alter lnel ci in either tissue, although the increment was greater in control tissue compared with TGE tissue due to an increase in lms ci (P < 0.02), which was not observed in TGE tissue. ].m Cl did not change significantly in either tissue after glucose. Theophylline, added after glucose, caused net CI secretion in both control and TGE tissue, with significant alteration in both flux values (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). Residual flux. A small Inet R was noted in both tissues and no differences were noted between control and TGE fluxes; both tissues responded similarly to both glucose and theophylline. Electrical data (Figure 1 ). In TGE tissue, spontaneous PD was negligible and lower than control PD (P < 0.001). The response to glucose was blunted in TGE compared with the response in controls (P < 0.001), and the PD remained lower (P < 0.001). During the theophylline period, PD in control tissues and PD in infected tissues were not significantly different. Similarly, the Is c (Figure 1 and Table 1 ) in TGE was negligible, and significantly less than control during the basal period (P < 0.001), and demonstrated a blunted response to glucose when compared with control (P value comparing increments < 0.01). Again, in the presence of theophylline, the differences in Is c between TGE and control tissue were no longer significant. Conductance was lower in TGE during basal and glucose study periods (P < 0.02), although an increment occurred in TGE tissue after administration of glucose (P < 0.02). During the theophylline period, conductance did not differ significantly between the tissues.
