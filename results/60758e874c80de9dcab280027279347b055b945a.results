Determination of optimal internal quality control spiking MS2 bacteriophage (MS2), a single-stranded RNA virus (ssRNA), was used as the IQC to validate the whole metagenomic process for each sample. In order to optimize IQC spiking level, the sensitivity of the metagenomic analysis workflow for MS2 detection was first evaluated with a ten-fold serial dilutions of MS2 (from 10 − 2 to 10 − 5 ) in a nasopharyngeal swab tested negative using FA RP (bioMérieux). MS2 was detected in internal QCT1 (IQCT1) for all levels of MS2 spiking (Ct ranged from 17.5 at the 10 − 2 dilution to 26.4 Ct at the 10 − 5 dilution). Full to partial MS2 genome coverage was obtained for all MS2 spiking levels in internal QCT2 (IQCT2; coverage ranged from 98% at the 10 − 2 dilution to 69% at the 10 − 5 dilution). For the highest spiking level, 66.0% of the total number of viral reads was mapped to MS2; for the lowest spiking level, 0.9% were so (Fig. 2) . To limit the number of NGS reads consumed for IQC detection, the optimal spiking condition was determined to be the 10 − 5 dilution and was used for the rest of the study.
