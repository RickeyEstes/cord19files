Forty-six consecutive patients received an unrelated donor stem cell transplant with fludarabine/melphalanbased conditioning and either subQ or i.v. alemtuzumab in combination with tacrolimus as GVHD prophylaxis. Twenty-six patients received subQ alemtuzumab and 20 received i.v. alemtuzumab. Overall, 130 subQ doses and 100 i.v. alemtuzumab doses were administered. Treatment groups were balanced with respect to age, gender, and disease state ( Table 2) . Disease status at transplantation and graft source were different between the 2 groups, most notably the subQ group had more patients with stable disease and all the patients in the subQ group received peripheral blood stem cell transplants whereas in the i.v. group, 50% had stem cells derived from bone marrow. Karnofsky performance status at the time of transplantation was similar between the treatment groups. There was no difference in Sorror comorbidity score and American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation risk category between the 2 groups (P Â¼ .434) [11] .
