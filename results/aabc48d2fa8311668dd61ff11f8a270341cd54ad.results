Eighty exacerbations in 54 patients were included in the data analysis. Thirty-five patients had one exacerbation, 13 had two exacerbations, five had three exacerbations, and one patient had four exacerbations during the 9-month study period. The patients ranged in age from 10 months to 32 years; the mean age was 15.4 years. Twenty-eight (52%) of the patients were male. There was a broad spectrum of disease severity; the modified Shwachman scores ranged from 30 to 99, with a mean of 67. Of the 80 exacerbations, 44 (55%) required hospitalization in the judgment of the physicians caring for the patient. Uniform criteria for hospital admission were not used. Two deaths occurred during the study period. Viral culture specimens were obtained during 71 (89%) of the 80 exacerbations, and paired sera for viral and mycoplasmal serologic studies were available from the patients with 40 (50%) of the exacerbations. Twenty-three (29%) of the 80 exacerbations were associated with an NBI. Five patients had positive viral cultures, and 18 had an NBI detected by serologic study (Table I) . Three exacerbations were associated with serologic evidence of infection by two different pathogens. Bacterial cultures revealed that 61 (76%) of the pulmonary exacerbations occurred in patients who were colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 17 (21%) were in pa-tients colonized with Pseudomonas cepacia. There was no correlation between colonization with either of these organisms and the detection of an associated NBI. Clinical characteristics. History and physical examination findings in the 23 exacerbations associated with NBI were compared with the findings in the 57 exacerbations with no associated NBI. The clinical findings in the two groups were similar. Of the 23 patients with NBI, 10 (43%) were admitted to the hospital, compared with 34 (60%) of the patients with no NBI. Further examination revealed that those patients with a diagnosis of influenza infection were more likely to be admitted to the hospital (6/8) than patients with other NBIs (4/15; p <0.04). The mean Shwachman score in the patients with influenza was 52 + 11 (mean _+ SD), compared with 72 _ 11 in patients with other NBIs and 67 _ 14 in patients with no NBI (p <0.01 for both comparisons). Laboratory findings. Complete blood cell counts were done on enrollment in the study for 21 (91%) of the exacerbations associated with NBI and for 51 (89%) of the remaining exacerbations. The complete blood cell counts were similar in the two groups. Quantitative CRP measurements were done on enrollment in the study in 18 (78%) of the patients with exacerbations of NBI and in 38 (67%) of those with the remaining exacerbations. The CRP finding was positive in 30 (54%) of the 56 exacerbations tested. Of the patients with NBI, 12 (67%) had positive CRP findings, compared with 18 (47%) of the patients with no NBI (p >0.05). All six of the patients with influenza-associated exacerbations who were tested had positive CRP findings, compared with 6 (50%) of the 12 patients with other NBIs and 18 (47%) of the 38 patients with no NBI (p <0.05 for both comparisons). The mean quantitative CRP value was higher (3.8 _+_+ 4.0 mg/dl) in the patients with influenza than in the patients with no NBI (1.7 _+ 2.0 mg/dl;p <0.05). The Shwachman scores were significantly lower in patients with positive CRP findings (61.9 __+ 14.6) than in patients without CRP (72.4 __+ 13.1;p <0.005). There was no association between a positive CRP finding and the magnitude of decline in the pulmonary function test results. Pulmonary function testing. Pulmonary function testing was done after 15 (65%) of the 23 exacerbations associated with NBI and after 36 (63%) of the 57 exacerbations with no NBI. The mean percentage of change in the PFT results did not differ significantly for the two groups. Pulmonary function was tested in six of the eight patients with influenza. Comparison of the patients with influenza either with the patients with no NBI or with those with NBI other than influenza revealed a significantly greater decline in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second and in the forced expiratory flow in the first 25% of vital capacity in the patients (Table II) . When the analysis was limited to exacerbations in patients with Shwachman scores less than 70, the results of the comparisons were the same except that the difference in ,the magnitude of decline of FEVt in patients with influenza, compared with those with no NBI, was no longer statistically significant. The data were also analyzed by comparing the proportion of patients in each group who had at least a 20% decline in the results of each of the PFTs. Four (67%) of the six patients with influenza, 8 (22%) of the 36 patients with no NBI, and 1 (11%) of the 9 patients with NBI other than influenza had at least a 20% decline in FEVI (p <0.05 for both comparisons). The proportion of patients in each group with at least a 20% decline in FEF25 was 6/6, 20/36 (56%), and 4/9 (44%), respectively (p <0.05 for both comparisons). There was no correlation between the Shwachman score and the magnitude of the change in PFT results during the acute exacerbations (r = 0.11 and r = 0.007 for correlation between the Shwachman score and the change in FEV1 and FEF25, respectively).
