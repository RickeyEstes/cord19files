We first present the experimental evidence for GO surface morphology, which changes upon various stages of surface modification. We then present the quenching effect of IgG-FITC on bare GO, antibody-conjugated GO, and Bovine serum albumin (BSA)-blocked GO surfaces to characterize and optimize assay parameters. Finally, we show how analyte IgG may be detected in a wide range of concentrations based on the fluorescence signal change of IgG-FITC. In addition, we provide the limit of detection and selectivity of the assay. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was introduced to measure the various stages of the surface modification of GO. According to the works of Lee et al. 19 and Hosseini et al. 4 , the height of GO would obviously increase after being activated by EDC-NHS and further upon conjugation by antibodies. These studies served as reference points for us to use AFM to characterize the surface morphologies of bare GO, EDC-NHS-activated GO, and antibody-conjugated GO to provide evidence of the EDC-NHS coupling reaction and the presence of antibodies on the GO surface. In Fig. 2(a) , bare GO has a thin and flat appearance with a height of approximately 1 nm on mica, which may correspond to the monolayer state of GO. The corresponding line scan and height profile of the sample are shown in Fig. 2 (d). After activation by EDC-NHS, GO exhibits an increased thickness of about 4 nm, similar to what was reported before 4, 19 . The line scan (arrow) gives a corresponding cross-sectional height profile in Fig. 2(d) , showing a uniform surface of the GO. Because the antibody is very large (with a molecular weight of over 150 kDa), one can correctly expect that the antibody-conjugated GO should be much thicker. As shown in Fig. 2 (c), we observed that the height of antibody-conjugated GO increased dramatically, with a typical thickness of about 10 nm, as suggested in the height profile in Fig. 2 (d). Some bright peaks were observed on this sample, which was also similar to what Hosseini et al. had observed 4 . The bright peaks are likely due to the accumulation of antibodies on the GO surface. All of the surface morphology results implied that the antibody was successfully retained on the GO surface. The key design of our immunoassay is the adsorption of IgG on antibody-conjugated GO, which controls the adsorption of IgG-FITCs and leaves some free IgG-FITCs in the solution to generate fluorescence signals. Due to the fact that binding sites on the antibody-conjugated GO were limited, when more analyte IgG proteins adsorb on antibody-conjugated GO, fewer binding sites remain for IgG-FITCs, so that more free IgG-FITCs will be in the solution and produce more fluorescence signals. Therefore, there is a positive and quantitative correlation between the analyte IgG concentration and the fluorescence intensity of free IgG-FITCs. According to this principle, our assay relies on the effectiveness of GO as an energy acceptor to provide efficient fluorescence quenching. The quenching efficiency of IgG-FITC by bare GO, antibody-conjugated GO, and BSA-blocked GO was investigated by adding a variety of these 3 types of GO to standard samples containing 1 μ g mL −1 of IgG-FITC, respectively. As we expected, the fluorescence of the free IgG-FITCs decreased when the IgG-FITCs bound to the graphene surfaces. In Fig. 3(a) , a rapid decrease of fluorescence intensity was observed with the increasing amount of bare GO, exhibiting a quenching efficiency of about 90% with 10 μ g mL −1 of GO. The signal change versus GO concentration is plotted in Fig. 3(d) . The quenching efficiency of antibody-conjugated GO may be lower than bare GO, because the modification of GO with antibodies changed the electronic property of GO, changing GO to a semiconductor 19 and making the transfer of energy from the excited state of FITC to bare GO easier than that to antibody-conjugated GO. In Fig. 3(b) , the fluorescence intensity also decreased with the increasing amount of antibody-conjugated GO, and the quenching efficiency indeed dropped to about 60% at 200 μ g mL −1 , showing antibody-modified GO could still be a quencher. With 100 μ g mL −1 of antibody-conjugated GO, about 30% of IgG-FITC initial fluorescence had been quenched, as can be seen in Fig. 3(d) . Therefore, with analyte IgG in the solution, the fluorescence intensity change of IgG-FITC will be between 0 to 30% with respect to initial fluorescence with no analyte. One last characterization of the assay was to determine whether the diminishing of fluorescence intensity could originate from other principles. If the fluorescence of IgG-FITCs will be quenched no matter if it is free or attached to the GO surface, the design is meaningless. By blocking the GO surface with 2% BSA in the buffer solution, we found that the fluorescence intensity change remained almost unchanged with increasing amount of BSA-blocked GO. Only the IgG-FITCs adsorbed on the surface of the GO could be quenched. According to our results, the appropriate concentration of antibody-conjugated GO was 100 μ g mL −1 (~30% quenching). Although more GO might quench the fluorescence even further, a higher antibody-conjugated GO concentration could be less sensitive for sensing the analyte IgG with a very small concentration. Therefore, there is a delicate balance between the concentration of GO and the change of fluorescence signal. In the following experiment, antibody-conjugated GO always had a concentration of 100 μ g mL −1 . Based on the above results, we carried out quantitative sensing of analyte IgG. Various amounts of IgG ranging from 0 to 20 μ g mL −1 was prepared in the buffer solution and tested. In our experiment, the "blank" sample consisted of antibody-conjugated GO and IgG-FITC, without analyte IgG. In order to show the difference in fluorescence quenching with the addition of the analyte, we always compared the fluorescence intensity of the blank without the analyte versus that when the analyte was present. As mentioned above, fluorescence quenching efficiency is determined by the energy coupling between the GO surface and the adsorbed IgG-FITC. Surface modification and interfacial environment largely affect quenching efficiency. With 100 μ g mL −1 of conjugated GO and 1 μ g mL −1 of IgG-FITC, our measured fluorescence intensity was ~50 at 520 nm as obtained by spectrometer. The addition of analyte IgG induced an increase of the signal, starting from the relatively large background signal. In order to make the results in direct proportion to the analyte concentration, we used the change of intensity for plotting the assay response curve in Fig. 4(a) . The value of Δ I was calculated by subtracting the final fluorescence intensity at 520 nm and the "blank" sample without analyte IgG. The experiment was repeated 4 times, and the average of the results was plotted in Fig. 4(a) , from which we can see the assay's fluorescence signal increased readily with the increasing analyte IgG concentration. There are 2 main features that can be observed from the plot. First, the signal change Δ I showed a rapid increase with analyte IgG up to ~5 μ g mL −1 , after which the change became less steep (The initial rise of the fluorescence signal was very rapid with a nearly linear region at concentrations below about 5 μ g mL −1 ). Second, the signal change reached about half of the maximum value with 10 μ g mL −1 of the analyte concentration (versus that of 20 μ g mL −1 ). According to our design, since binding sites on antibody-conjugated GO are limited, the more analyte IgG that was added, the fewer binding sites remained for IgG-FITCs, resulting in more free IgG-FITCs in the buffer solution. Thus, we observed that increasing fluorescence intensity is quantitatively controlled by the analyte IgG concentration. The result indicates that the principle of our platform is feasible, and the analyte IgG proteins could control the fluorescence quenching and determine the fluorescence intensity. Within the concentrations of 0 to 5 μ g mL −1 , we generated a linear plot relating to the IgG-FITC fluorescence intensity with the analyte IgG concentration. This is plotted in Fig. 4(b) . We performed the experiment under the same conditions 4 times and the data points in Fig. 4(b) fit well with the linear function. The fitting function of the curve is Δ I = 0.04157c (concentration of IgG) with an R 2 of 0.994. We then repeated the blank experiment 20 times in order to calculate the standard deviation (SD). We took 3 times the value of the SD and divided it by the slope of the calibration curve, and got the LOD of 4.67 pmol mL −1 . Up to now, we have assumed that IgG-FITC proteins are all uniformly labelled with fluorescent FITCs. Because the quality of antibodies and percentage of FITC labelling on IgG may vary in different batches and from different manufacturers 20 , the LOD could in principle be improved with well-controlled and uniform labelling of IgG by FITC. However, this is beyond the scope of this paper. One major assumption we held is that IgG proteins bind on antibody-conjugated GO via the antibody-antigen type of specific bonding. This discriminative binding process means that analyte IgG will be adsorbed by antibody-conjugated GO, preventing the fluorescein-labelled IgG-FITC from binding to and being quenching by the surface. In order to know whether other biological molecules might interfere with the sensing process and give false positive signals, we performed a series of experiments to determine more about the specificity of our assay. Some interference molecules, such as human serum albumin (HSA), BSA, and IgG, were introduced to test the selectivity. In this set of parallel testing, the signals from the solutions containing the above interference substances, analyte IgG, and blank sample without analyte IgG were compared. The results in Fig. 5 clearly show that the 3 possible interfering biomolecules gave no detectable signal change, as compared with the blank sample. Only the analyte IgG protein showed a significant positive signal as the fluorescence intensity of the other proteins was close to the blank sample. This indicates that our assay design is highly selective for IgG protein.
