In this study, men accounted for 56% of the experimental group and 53.85% of the control group. The overall mean age of the patients was 50.41Â±13.04 years. Fever was the most common symptom in patients in this study (80.39%). In clinical symptoms, the extent of lung lesions based on chest CT did not differ significantly between the two groups, whether or not they used hypnotic drugs, gender, and age (P> 0.05, Table 1 ). All patients completed the study without data leakage. The average score of sleep quality before intervention in the two groups was not statistically significant (P=0.927), and there was statistical significance after intervention (P <0.05). The t test results also showed that the average score of anxiety before intervention was not statistically significant (P=0.713), and the average score of anxiety after intervention was statistically significant (P <0.05) (Figure 1 and 2) (Table 2 ). In this study, compared with the control group, the experimental group had reduced anxiety levels and improved sleep quality after 5 days (Figures 1 and 2 ).
