The C protein of hPIV3 interacts directly with STAT1 and GRB2 To identify cellular targets of hPIV3-C, this viral protein was used as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human cDNA library. The screen was performed at saturation with a 10-fold coverage of the library (50.10 +6 diploids), and positive yeast colonies growing on selective medium were analyzed by PCR and sequencing to identify binding partners of hPIV3-C. STAT1 and GRB2 were the main interactors of hPIV3-C identified in the screen with 5 and 150 yeast colonies corresponding to these cellular proteins, respectively. In both cases, cDNA clones retrieved from the screen corresponded to full-length STAT1 and GRB2 in frame with the Gal4-AD transactivation domain. To validate these interactions in human cells, GST-tagged hPIV3-C was expressed in HEK-293T cells and purified with glutathion-sepharose beads. As shown in Figure 1B and 1C, endogenous STAT1 and GRB2 co-purified with hPIV3-C. Highly divergent C proteins from measles virus (MV-C) and Nipah virus (Nipah-C) failed to do so, thereby demonstrating the specificity of identified interactions. Binding to STAT1 provides molecular basis to the inhibition of IFN-a/b signaling by hPIV3-C [18] , and parallels the interaction previously identified between Sendai virus C protein and mouse STAT1 [15] . Altogether, this suggests that STAT1 is a specific cellular interactor of Respirovirus C proteins. In contrast, binding to GRB2 is unexpected and suggests a new function for hPIV3-C that we decided to investigate. hPIV3-C has opposite effects on IFN-a/b and EGF signaling pathways The adaptor protein GRB2 plays a critical role in coupling signal from growth factor receptors to MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. To address the question of hPIV3-C interference with this pathway, we used a trans-reporter gene assay that measures Elk1 activation by ERK1/2. In this system, Elk1 transcription factor is fused to the DNA binding domain of Gal4 (Gal4-DB) and binds the promoter sequence of a luciferase reporter gene. Upon stimulation with a growth factor like EGF, Elk1 is activated as assessed by a significant increase in luciferase expression. Surprisingly, we observed a 6-fold enhancement in this cellular response to EGF when 36FLAG-tagged hPIV3-C was expressed in HEK-293T cells (Figure 2A ). Same results were obtained when using hPIV3-C without a tag (14-fold enhancement) or tagged with the red fluorescent protein Cherry (7-fold enhancement). In contrast to hPIV3-C, neither MV-C nor Nipah-C enhanced Elk1 activity upon EGF stimulation (Figure 2A ) whereas expression levels of hPIV3-C, MV-C and Nipah-C were similar in this system ( Figure 2F , left panel). Elk1 activity was also enhanced by hPIV3-C expression in Vero and Hela cells as well as BEAS-2B and A549, two epithelial cell lines that originate from the respiratory tract, which is the tissue targeted by hPIV3 in vivo ( Table 1 ). The effect of hPIV3-C in these different cell lines was highly significant (see p-values in Table 1 ) although relatively modest when compared to HEK-293T cells. This is probably because our reporter system requires the co-transfection of four plasmids and Vero, Hela, BEAS-2B and A549 cells are more difficult to transfect than HEK-293T. In parallel experiments, cellular response to IFN-a/b was monitored using a cis-reporter gene, of which expression is controlled by five ISREs. As previously reported [18] , we found that hPIV3-C efficiently blocked IFN-a/b signaling ( Figure 2B ) as opposed to what we observed for the EGF pathway. Again, MV-C or Nipah-C was unable to do so. Altogether, these results show that hPIV3-C enhances the cellular response to EGF in addition to its ability to block IFN-a/b signaling. We also determined if similar effects on the EGF pathway were observed in infected cells. HEK-293T cells were infected with hPIV3 (MOI = 3) and then transfected with Elk1 activity reporter plasmids. Infection of HEK-293T cells was confirmed by anti-hPIV3 hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (hPIV3-HN) immunostaining and flow cytometry analysis ( Figure 2E ). Like hPIV3-C alone, hPIV3 infection enhanced Elk1 activity upon EGF stimulation ( Figure 2C ). Interestingly, hPIV3 infection induced a significant level of Elk1 activity in the absence of EGF stimulation. This suggests that in addition to hPIV3-C interaction with GRB2, other mechanisms modulate MAPK/ERK pathway during hPIV3 infection. Finally, to demonstrate that enhancement of Elk1 activation by hPIV3-C is completely dependent on ERK1/2 activation, HEK-293T cells were pre-treated with MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 before stimulation with EGF. This molecule targets MEK1/2 and totally abrogates downstream phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2 [30] . As shown in Figure 2D , Elk1 activation was blocked by U0126, whereas hPIV3-C expression was maintained ( Figure 2F , right panel). This demonstrates that hPIV3-C is acting through ERK1/2 stimulation. Altogether, these results support a model where hPIV3-C interaction with GRB2 enhances cellular response to growth factors as assessed by an increased activation of MAPK/ ERK pathway. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2, eIF4E and small ribosomal subunit S6 protein are stimulated by hPIV3-C expression or hPIV3 infection To further document hPIV3-C impact on MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, we compared the kinetic of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HEK-293T cells expressing hPIV3-C or not. Cells were transfected hPIV3-C Impact on IFN-a/b and EGF Pathways In addition to these three plasmids, cells were co-transfected with an expression vector encoding 36FLAG-tagged MV-C, hPIV3-C or Nipah-C or the corresponding empty vector pCI-neo-36FLAG. 12 h after transfection, cells were starved and 6 h later EGF was added at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. After 24 h, relative luciferase activity was determined. (B) HEK-293T cells were transfected with pISRE-Luc, a plasmid containing a luciferase gene of which expression is controlled by five ISREs, and pRL-CMV. In addition to these two plasmids, cells were co-transfected with an expression plasmid encoding 36FLAG-tagged MV-C, hPIV3-C or Nipah-C or the corresponding empty vector pCI-neo-36FLAG. 24 h after transfection, 1000 IU/ml of recombinant IFN-b were added. After 24 h, relative luciferase activity was determined. (C) HEK-293T cells were infected with hPIV3 (MOI = 3) and then transfected with pFA2-Elk1, pGal4-UAS-Luc, pRL-CMV vectors. 12 h later, cells were starved during 6 h and stimulated with EGF at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. After 24 h, relative luciferase activity was determined. (D) Same experiment as (A) but 20 mM of MEK1/2 specific inhibitor U0126 was added as indicated. (A-D) All experiments were achieved in triplicate, and data represent means6SD. (E) HEK-293T cells were infected as in (C), and hPIV3-HN expression determined by immunostaining and flow cytometry analysis. (F) HEK-293T cells were transfected to express 36FLAG-tagged MV-C, hPIV3-C or Nipah-C as described in (A) and (B), and relative expression levels were determined 36 h later by western blot analysis (left panel). In a parallel experiment, HEK-293T cells were transfected to express hPIV3-C and were cultured with or without EGF in the presence or absence of U0126 as described in (D). hPIV3-C expression level was determined by western blot analysis (right panel). doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000587.g002 with 36FLAG-tagged hPIV3-C or a control plasmid and 24 h post transfection, they were starved before stimulation with EGF. ERK1/ 2 phosphorylation was determined at 10, 30 and 120 min after stimulation. As illustrated by one representative experiment in Figure 3A , EGF stimulation induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in control cells but signal was markedly and reproducibly increased by hPIV3-C expression at maximum phosphorylation time point (1.4 to 2.8 fold increase; p = 0.005; n = 4). We then determined the phosphorylation level of two downstream targets of this pathway that are involved in the control of mRNA translation, the translation initiation factor eIF4E and the ribosomal protein S6 ( Figure 3B ). Before EGF stimulation, low levels of phosphorylated eIF4E and S6 were detectable in mock-treated cells ( Figure 3B and 3D). hPIV3-C expression had virtually no effects on this background. Thus, eIF4E and S6 phosphorylation levels were determined at different time-points after EGF stimulation. Because ERK1/2 activation precedes eIF4E and S6 phosphorylation, maximal phosphorylation occurs at later time points and was determined at 30 min, 2 h, 6 h and 24 h after stimulation. As observed for ERK1/2, phosphorylation levels of eIF4E and S6 were enhanced by hPIV3-C expression when stimulating the cells with EGF. To validate these observations in infected cells, HEK-293T cells were infected with hPIV3 (MOI = 3) and 24 h later, cells were starved for 12 h before stimulation with EGF. Like hPIV3-C expression alone, hPIV3 infection enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation at the peak of induction, i.e. 10 min after adding EGF to the cells ( Figure 3C ). Interestingly, hPIV3 infection of A549 cells also enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation but the induction profile was different. Indeed, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was not significantly increased at the peak of induction, but the signal was boosted by hPIV3 infection at late time points ( Figure S1 ). The same profile was observed when eIF4E and S6 phosphorylation levels were analyzed in infected HEK-293T cells. hPIV3 infection sustained the phosphorylation of these two translation factors at late time points, but showed no increase at the peak of stimulation, i.e. 30 min after adding EGF to the cells ( Figure 3D ). This could relate to the fact that hPIV3 infection also induces low levels of eIF4E and S6 phosphorylation in the absence of EGF stimulation ( Figure 3D ). This is reminiscent to what was observed for Elk1 ( Figure 2C ), and suggests that hPIV3 infection induces a basal activation of MAPK/ERK pathway leading to the constitutive phosphorylation of downstream targets. Altogether, these data demonstrate that hPIV3 infection or hPIV3-C expression alone both enhance MAPK/ERK pathway activation in EGF-stimulated cells. Several RNA viruses require an activated MAPK/ERK pathway to produce viral components and replicate properly (for review see [31] ). To test if the same was true for hPIV3, cells were treated for 2 h with MAPK/ERK pathway inhibitor U0126 and infected with hPIV3 (MOI = 1). Two days after infection, cell surface expression of hPIV3-HN was detected by immunostaining and flow cytometry. U0126 completely blocked the expression of hPIV3-HN in hPIV3-infected cells (Figure 4 ), whereas the same inhibitor had no effect when cells were infected with MV ( Figure S2 ). Altogether, this demonstrates that MAPK/ERK signaling is essential for the expression of hPIV3 proteins and suggests that hPIV3 manipulates this pathway to increase replication efficiency. The C-terminal region of hPIV3-C binds STAT1 and GRB2 To better understand how hPIV3-C targets both the IFN-a/b and EGF signaling pathways, we characterized the functional domains of hPIV3-C that bind STAT1 and GRB2. To do so, we generated by PCR a full matrix of hPIV3-C overlapping fragments and tested their ability to interact with either STAT1 or GRB2 in the yeast two-hybrid system ( Figure 5 and 6 ). Both forward and reverse primers were designed every 75 nucleotides along hPIV3-C sequence and fused to appropriate tails to allow gap-repair recombination with linearized Gal4-DB yeast two-hybrid vector ( Figure 5A ). All possible combinations of forward and reverse primers were used to amplify hPIV3-C fragments. Finally, corresponding PCR products were transformed in a yeast strain expressing Gal4-AD fused to either STAT1 or GRB2, and growth on selective medium was used to detect potential interactions. A 124 (AA)-long peptide encompassing position 76 to 199 located in the C-terminal half of hPIV3-C was sufficient to bind STAT1 ( Figure 5B ) or GRB2 ( Figure 6A ). In an iterative process, we then generated a second, a third and a fourth set of hPIV3-C fragments corresponding to one-by-one AA deletions ( Figure 5C -E and Figure 6B -D), allowing to further reduce the STAT1 and GRB2 binding motifs to minimal peptides. A 106 AA peptide encompassing residues 90 to 195 of hPIV3-C was sufficient to observe the interaction with STAT1 ( Figure 5E ). The binding region to GRB2 was virtually the same, encompassing AA 97 to 195 ( Figure 6D ). The C-terminal region of hPIV3-C required to bind STAT1 and GRB2 in the yeast two-hybrid system is highly conserved among Respiroviruses ( Figure 7A ) and suspected to fold into a structured coiled-coil domain [18] . Furthermore, virtually the same C-terminal region of Sendai virus C protein (AA 85-204) was previously reported to mediate the interaction with mouse STAT1 [32] . To further validate our observations performed in the yeast two-hybrid system, we retested by co-affinity purification the ability of hPIV3-C fragment encompassing AA 90-195 (hPIV3-C 90-195 ) to interact with STAT1 and GRB2 in HEK-293T cells. GST-tagged hPIV3-C 90-195 was expressed together with 36-FLAG-tagged STAT1 or GRB2, and purified with glutathionsepharose beads. Full-length hPIV3-C and the N-terminal region encompassing AA 1-89 (hPIV3-C 1-89 ) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. As shown in Figure 7B and 7C, hPIV3-C 90-195 interacted with STAT1 and GRB2, whereas hPIV3-C 1-89 did not. Although hPIV3-C 90-195 interacted with GRB2 as efficiently as full-length hPIV3-C ( Figure 7C ), interaction with STAT1 was weaker suggesting that more residues contribute to the stabilization of this interaction ( Figure 7B ). Altogether, these results confirm that AA 90-195 of hPIV-3 include both STAT1 and GRB2 binding sites. As described in Figure 2 , HEK-293T, Hela, Vero, A549 or BEAS-2B cells were transfected with pFA2-Elk1, pGal4-UAS-Luc, pRL-CMV to measure the activation level of MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding 36FLAG-tagged MV-C, hPIV3-C or Nipah-C or the corresponding empty vector pCI-neo-36FLAG. 12 h after transfection, cells were starved and stimulated 6 h later with 100 ng/ml of EGF. After 24 h, expression of luciferase was quantified. Results were normalized so that reporter activity in cells transfected with a control vector equals 1. Experiments were performed in triplicates and data represent means6SD. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000587.t001 hPIV3-C Impact on IFN-a/b and EGF Pathways Although STAT1 and GRB2 essentially bind to the same region of hPIV3-C as demonstrated above, it remained unclear whether these interactions are mutually exclusive. To answer this question, a competition experiment was designed where GST-tagged hPIV3-C was co-expressed with STAT1 in the presence or absence of GRB2 ( Figure 7D ). In this setting, GRB2 expression prevents STAT1 copurification together with GST-tagged hPIV3-C. This validates our finding that STAT1 and GRB2 interact with the same region of hPIV3-C, and demonstrates that STAT1 and GRB2 compete for hPIV3-C binding. Interestingly, GRB2 interaction with hPIV3-C was not affected by STAT1 expression (Figure 7D and data not shown), suggesting that GRB2 has a higher affinity for hPIV3-C than STAT1. Both the N-and C-terminal domains of hPIV3-C are required for its activity We finally tested if hPIV3-C 90-195 was able, like full-length hPIV3-C, to block IFN-a/b signaling and enhance cellular response to EGF stimulation. First, cells were transfected with 36FLAG-tagged hPIV3-C, hPIV3-C 90-195 or hPIV3-C 1-89 together with the IFN-a/b reporter plasmid, and stimulated 24 h later with recombinant IFN-b. Reporter gene expression was determined 24 h post transfection and found to be inhibited exclusively by full-length hPIV3-C ( Figure 8A ). Although this may reflect the weakness of hPIV3-C interaction with STAT1 ( Figure 7B ), this also indicates that both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of hPIV3-C are required to block IFN-a/b signaling, even if only the C-terminal region is required for the binding to STAT1. The same constructs were tested using the Elk1 activity reporter plasmids ( Figure 8B ). Again, only full-length hPIV3-C was able to enhance Elk1 activation upon EGF stimulation whereas full-length hPIV3-C and hPIV3-C 90-195 were expressed at similar levels in transfected cells ( Figure 8B , upper right panel). Because GRB2 binding to hPIV3-C and hPIV3-C 90-195 were essentially equivalent in co-affinity purification experiments, we hypothesized that the N-terminal region of hPIV3-C was required for its proper subcellular localization. Thus, hPIV3-C, hPIV3-C 90-195 and hPIV3-C 1-89 were expressed in fusion downstream of the red fluorescent protein Cherry. As shown in Figure 8C , Cherry alone or fused to hPIV3-C 90-195 localized both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of transfected cells. In contrast, full-length hPIV3-C essentially accumulated at the cellular membrane whereas hPIV3-C 1-89 was in the nucleus. Although we have no explanation for this unexpected localization of hPIV3-C 1-89 , these observations show that only full-length hPIV3-C is able to target the cellular membrane where both IFN-a/b and EGF signaling are triggered.
