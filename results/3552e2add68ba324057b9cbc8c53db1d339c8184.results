The demographic and clinical characteristics of SARS patients in this study are shown in Table 1 . The mean age of patients was 37.6 years (range 21 to 85 years). It can be seen that 77.2% of men and 73.1% of women had received high-dose intravenous steroid therapy. Assuming that 1 mg of prednisolone was equivalent to 4 mg hydrocortisone (or 0.8 mg of methyl prednisolone), male patients had an average daily dose of 176 mg (SD = 109 mg), with an average cumulative dose of 2931 mg (SD = 2085 mg) of prednisolone; while female patients had an average daily dose of 152 mg (SD = 111 mg); and an average cumulative dose of 2648 mg (SD = 2191 mg) of prednisolone. Moreover, both men and women were treated by high-dose ribavirin therapy. On average, patients had their BMD measured at 197 days after being diagnosed as SARS patients (SD = 18, median = 195 days, range 149-231 days). The Z score for BMD at the total hip and spine for SARS patients are shown in Fig. 1 (a -d) and Table 2 . In men, there was a trend for SARS patients to have negative BMD Z scores. Six percent and 3.7% of men had a BMD Z score of À2 at the total hip and spine, respectively (P = 0.057 for testing the hypothesis that >2.5% of subjects should have a Z score of À2 at the total hip). In men, the Spearman correlation coefficients between BMD and the following variables are as follows: duration of steroid treatment, r = À0.25 (P = 0.023); cumulative prednisolone equivalent dose, r = À0.07 (P = 0.95); cumulative ribarivin dose, r = 0.07 (P = 0.50). In women, the Spearman correlation coefficients between BMD and the following variables are as follows: duration of steroid treatment, r = 0.014 (P = 0.87); cumulative prednisolone equivalent dose, r = 0.04 (P = 0.64); cumulative ribavirin dose, r = 0.11 (P = 0.19). The drug regime for patients whose BMD Z score at the hip and spine were À2 or less is shown in Table 3 . It can be seen that only 2 of these patients had relatively low dose prednisolone therapy, while the rest all had intravenous steroid therapy. Most patients also received high doses of ribavirin.
