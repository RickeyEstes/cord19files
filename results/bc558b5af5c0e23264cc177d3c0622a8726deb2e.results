To investigate the cellular interactions of the PRRSV N protein and to identify potential cellular proteins that played important function(s) in virus biology a label free proteomic approach was used. We have used a similar mass spectrometry approach to identify the cellular interactome of Zaire Ebola virus VP24 protein (Garcia-Dorival et al., 2014) . This was coupled to interaction studies using recombinant His-tagged PRRSV N protein as bait to pull-down cellular interacting partners. 3.1. Pull-down of cellular interacting proteins N protein was expressed with a C-terminal His-tag (Jourdan et al., 2012b) in BL21(DE3)pLyS cells (Fig. 1A , left panel). To purify the N protein bacterial lysate from the induced culture was incubated with nickel affinity beads. Western blot analysis using anti-his antibody indicated that N protein bound to the nickel affinity beads (Fig. 1A , right panel). The same was also shown for the UBC9 protein used as a binding control (data not shown). To identify potential cellular protein interactions with N protein, the nickel affinity bound N or UBC9 control protein (with similar molecular weight to N protein) were incubated with cell lystate prepared from HEK293T cells. This cell line was chosen because of the superior annotation of the human genome for protein identification and high level of transfection efficiency. Furthermore, numerous small molecule inhibitors have been identified for human proteins, which allowed us to test our hypothesis that proteomics can be a powerful tool for identifying therapeutic targets. Potential protein-protein interactions were visualized by silver stain analysis (Fig. 1B) . The data indicated that cellular proteins were bound to both N and UBC9 and that these profiles were distinct from each other.
