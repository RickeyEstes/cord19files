The patterns, extent and distribution of the lung abnormalities by HRCT scans at different time points were listed in detail in Table 1 . Serial HRCT scans of 39 patients were categorized into the early, progressive, and convalescent stages. No scans demonstrated nodules or mediastinal lymph nodes at any time point of assessment. At the early stage, chest HRCT was performed in 7 patients within 3 days after symptoms onset. Patchy GGO with homogeneous density, segmental distribution and poorly defined boundary were shown in 4 cases. In addition, mixture of patchy GGOs with consolidations was present in 3 cases. In the progressive stage, chest HRCT was performed in all 39 patients within d 4e7 and d 8e14 after the symptoms onset. The lesions of the 7 patients who received HRCT scan at the early stage progressed at d 4e7. The lesions of 39 patients deteriorated to a peak during d 8e14. The HRCT abnormality peaked averagely at d 9.8 ± 2.1 after the symptoms onset. Mixture of bilaterally distributed consolidations with GGOs was the most commonly observed pattern (n ¼ 28, 71.8%). The diffuse pattern deteriorated to a peak abnormality rate (n ¼ 17, 43.6%). During d 4e14 of assessment, confluent air-space opacities diffusely involved both lungs, compatible with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Fig. 1 ), in 4 cases (10.3%). Pneumothorax was noted in 1 patient at d 6 after the onset. Three patients developed super-infection, and 2 of these patients developed aspergillus. By HRCT for one patient, progressive consolidation was noted; and for another, a cavity was noted in the right upper lung. And one patient developed staphylococcal septicemia with multiple cavities in both lungs by HRCT scanning (Fig. 2) . In the convalescent stage, the extent of lesions in lungs of 5 patients gradually decreased since d 7 after symptoms onset, and improved after d 14 in another 32 patients. A predominant pattern of consolidation with or without GGO was the most common during the first 14 days and decreased thereafter. Serial HRCT scans obtained in 25 patients demonstrated fibrosis, including 7 cases during d 8e14 and 18 cases after d 14. The prevalence of fibrosis decreased slowly thereafter. Averagely, fibrosis was observed at d 18.5 ± 6.4, either confined within the subpleural region of lungs or diffusing from the subpleural region. In 24 patients, final HRCT scan was obtained at d 22e28 or after d 28. The lesions in 5 (20.8%) patients were completely absorbed, and the extent of lesions in 19 patients (79.2%) decreased. Residual fibrosis was observed in 16 patients (66.7%), and one patient showed residual fibrosis only at the dorsal lower lobes at d 97 after the symptoms onset. Three patterns of longitudinal changes of the lung lesions were identified: type 1, improvement after deterioration (Figs. 1 and 2); type 2, concurrent improvement and deterioration followed by improvement; and type 3, gradual improvement (Fig. 3) . Type 1 was the most common pattern (n ¼ 27, 69.2%). The involvement and distribution of lesions were noted, including unilateral or bilateral, singular or multiple segments/lobes involved, diffuse or focal distribution. Type 2 was the second most common pattern (n ¼ 7, 17.9%). The lesions were found completely absorbed or decreased. However, new lesions may be present and were then absorbed. Type 3 was observed in 5 patients (12.8%). Multifocal or diffuse opacities were present within d 4e7 and were gradually absorbed as shown by follow-up HRCT scans. A total of 24 patients received all serial HRCT scans. The patterns, extent, distribution and mean CT scores of the lung lesions by HRCT scans at different time points were shown in detail in Table 2 . The estimated mean CT scores peaked at d 8e14 of the illness course, indicating a marked increase of severity at d 8e14, with a slow decrease thereafter (Fig. 4) .
