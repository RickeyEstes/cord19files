Effects of ACE2 and Mas-receptor antagonist A779on LPSinduced apoptosis in PMVECs. The rate of apoptosis of PMVECs in the LPS group (exposed to LPS for 48 h; 55.07%), was significantly higher than that of the PBS control group (6.43%; P , 0.05; Fig. 1A ). For cells infected with LV-Ace2 receiving LPS (ACE2 1 LPS group) the rate of apoptosis was 37.60% (P , 0.05), but this was significantly lower than that of PMVECs infected with shRNA-ACE2 treated with LPS (shACE2 1 LPS group; 85.85%; P , 0.05). In normal PMVECs stimulated with LPS, the apoptosis rate of those given the A779 pretreatment (A779 1 LPS group; 89.55%) was significantly higher than that of the cells treated with LPS only (LPS; 55.07%; P , 0.05; Fig. 1B ). However, the apoptosis rate of cells infected with LV-Ace2 that received pretreatment of A779 prior to LPS (ACE2 1 A779 1 LPS group; 53.80%) was significantly lower than that of the A779 1 LPS group (P , 0.05), although there was no significant difference between the ACE2 1 A779 1 LPS group (53.80%) and the LPS group (55.07%). Effects of ACE2 and Mas-receptor antagonist A779 on cytokine secretion in PMVECs. The IL-1b and TNF-a levels in the supernatants of cultured PMVECs that were exposed to LPS for 48 h were significantly higher as compared with control group. (Fig. 2A, 2C) . LPS-induced IL-1b and TNF-a secretions were significantly inhibited by ACE2 overexpression, but further promoted by ACE2 knockdown. In PMVECs exposed to LPS, pretreatment with A779 caused a significant increase in IL-1b and TNF-a secretions, which were markedly attenuated by ACE2 overexpression (Fig. 2B, 2D) . However, there was no significant difference between ACE2 1 A779 1 LPS and LPS-treated cells in the levels of cytokines in the supernatants. These results indicate that ACE2 suppressed the LPSinduced inflammatory response in PMVECs, and the Mas-receptor antagonist effectively prevented this protective effect. Effects of ACE2 and Mas-receptor antagonist A779 on AngII/Ang-(1-7) secretion in PMVECs. The AngII levels in supernatants of the LPS group (20.04 6 1.92 ng/mL) were significantly higher than that of the PBS control group (10.99 6 4.03 ng/mL; P , 0.05), but the Ang-(1-7) levels in the LPS group were only slightly higher (15.49 6 3.41 ng/mL) than that of the PBS group (12.30 6 2.40 ng/mL; P . 0.05). For cells infected with LV-Ace2 receiving LPS (ACE2 1 LPS group), AngII secretion (12.79 6 2.42 ng/mL) was significantly less than that of the normal cells receiving LPS (LPS group; 20.04 6 1.92 ng/mL), but AngII levels were significantly higher in PMVECs infected with shRNA-Ace2 treated with LPS (shACE2 1 LPS group; 27.29 6 3.97 ng/mL) compared with the LPS group (P , 0.05). In contrast, Ang-(1-7) levels in PMVECs infected with LV-Ace2 receiving LPS (ACE2 1 LPS group; 31.20 6 4.75 ng/mL; P , 0.05) were significantly higher than that of the LPS group (15.49 6 3.41 ng/mL), and also that of the shRNA-ACE2 1 LPS group (14.81 6 2.55 ng/mL; P , 0.05; Fig 3A, 3C) . In normal PMVECs exposed to LPS, the AngII levels of those pretreated with A779 (A779 1 LPS group; 31.87 6 4.69 ng/mL) were significantly higher than that of the cells treated with LPS only (20.04 6 1.92 ng/mL; P , 0.05). The AngII levels of cells infected with LV-Ace2 that received pretreatment of A779 prior to LPS (ACE2 1 A779 1 LPS group; 15.50 6 0.60 ng/mL) were significantly lower than that of the A779 1 LPS group (31.87 6 4.69 ng/mL; P , 0.05). However, the levels of Ang-(1-7) in normal PMVECs treated with A779 and LPS (A779 1 LPS group; 10.12 6 2.80 ng/mL) were slightly less than these levels in the LPS group (15.49 6 3.41; P . 0.05), and those of the ACE2 1 A779 1 LPS group (16.23 6 5.17 ng/ mL) were only slightly higher (P . 0.05; Fig 3B, 3D) . Effects of ACE2 and Mas-receptor antagonist A779 on the ACE2/ ACE ratio in PMVECs. Relative to the normal PMVECs in PBS (control group), in those stimulated with LPS for 48 h (LPS group) the ACE levels were higher and the ACE2 levels were lower, and therefore the ACE2/ACE ratio was significantly lower (Fig. 4A) . However, in cells infected with LV-Ace2 receiving LPS only (ACE2 1 LPS group), the ACE2/ACE ratio was comparable to the control group (P . 0.05). In contrast, cells infected with shRNA-Ace2 receiving LPS only (shACE2 1 LPS group), the ratio of ACE2/ ACE ratio was lower than that of the LPS group. Compared with the ACE2/actin and ACE/actin levels of the LPS group (0.2924 and 0.6918, respectively), both of these were significantly lower in normal PMVECs treated with A779 prior to LPS (A779 1 LPS group; 0.2187 and 0.5462; P , 0.05 for both). The ACE2/ACE ratio was also notably lower in the A779 1 LPS group compared to the control group, but was not significantly different from that of the LPS group (Fig. 4B ). In addition, compared with the ACE2/actin and ACE/actin levels of the normal cells treated with A779 and LPS (A779 1 LPS group; 0.2187 and 0.5462, respectively), in the cells infected with LV-Ace2 and treated with both A779 and LPS (ACE2 1 A779 1 LPS group), ACE2/actin was significantly higher (0.3733; P , 0.05) while ACE/actin (0.4707) was similar (P . 0.05). As a result, the ratio of ACE2/ACE was much higher in the A779 1 ACE2 1 LPS group. Effects of ACE2 and Mas-receptor antagonist A779 on the MAPKs phosphorylation in PMVECs. The western blot results showed that after normal PMVECs were incubated with LPS for 48 h (LPS group), phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2, p38, and SAPK/JNK were significantly higher compared with the untreated control group (Fig 5A, 5C, 5E) . Compared with the LPS group, PMVECs transduced with Ace2 and incubated with LPS (ACE2 1 LPS group) had lower levels of phosphorylated p38 and SAPK/JNK, but levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation were not markedly less. In contrast, compared with the LPS group, PMVECs transduced with shRNA-Ace2 and incubated with LPS (shACE2 1 LPS group) had significantly higher ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels, but levels of phosphorylated p38 and SAPK/JNK were similar. Pretreatment with A779 in LPS-exposed cells (A779 1 LPS group) was associated with significantly higher phosphorylation levels of all three MAPK pathways relative to cells of the LPS group. Whereas compared with the A779 1 LPS group, the levels of phosphorylated p38 and SAPK/JNK phosphorylation in the ACE2 1 A779 1 LPS group were markedly lower (P , 0.05), there was no obvious difference in these levels between the ACE2 1 A779 1 LPS and LPS groups (P . 0.05; Fig. 5B , D, F). Furthermore, compared with the A779 1 LPS group, the ERK1/2 phosphorylation level was only slightly less in the ACE2 1 A779 1 LPS group (P . 0.05), but significantly higher than that of the LPS group and the phosphorylation level in the A779 1 LPS group was still more enhanced than in LPS group (P , 0.05). In addition, the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in the A779 1 LPS group were approximately the same as that of the shACE2 1 LPS group (P . 0.05), while the levels of phosphorylated p38 and SAPK/ JNK were significantly higher (P , 0.05). Effects of ACE2 and Mas-receptor antagonist A779 on NF-kB p65 phosphorylation and IkBa expression in PMVECs. The phosphorylation of NF-kB p65 and expression of IkBa were examined by western blot (Fig. 6) . LPS stimulation resulted in significantly increased level of NF-kB p65 phosphorylation and decreased level of IkBa expression in normal PMVECs. In the cells infected with LV-Ace2 and stimulated with LPS (ACE2 1 LPS group), the NF-kB p65 phosphorylation level was significantly lower and IkBa expression level significantly higher than that in PMVECs stimulated with LPS only. In contrast, compared with the LPS group, PMVECs transduced with shRNA-Ace2 and stimulated with LPS (shACE2 1 LPS group) had significantly higher NF-kB p65 phosphorylation levels and lower IkBa expression levels. The phosphorylation levels of NF-kB p65 were significantly higher and the IkBa levels lower in the cells stimulated with LPS and pretreated with A779 (A779 1 LPS group) compared with the LPS group. The phosphorylated NF-kB p65 levels in the ACE2 1 A779 1 LPS group were significantly higher than that of the LPS group, but were not significantly different from the ACE2 1 A779 1 LPS and A779 1 LPS groups. The IkBa levels in the ACE2 1 A779 1 LPS group was approximately similar to that of the LPS group, but was significantly increased compared with the A779 1 LPS group.
