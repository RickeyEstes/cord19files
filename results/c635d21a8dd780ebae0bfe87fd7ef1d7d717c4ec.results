A total of 101 herd-periods (55 from period A; 46 from period B) from 65 herds were considered for analysis. The different number of observations between periods was because of missing milk samples at some sampling times. The distribution of herd-periods in each BCV and BRSV herd status is shown in Table 1 . The relative proportions of periods-at-risk in status RI, PSI, and FREE were 17, 65, and 18% and 24, 47, and 29% for BRSV infection and BCV infection, respectively. The proportion of periods-at-risk with an outbreak classified as BRSV related was 8%, whereas this proportion was 34% for BCV related outbreaks. A total of 36,184 test-days, 2,716 cows with a first AI within the periods-at-risk, and 4,104 calves and heifers were retained for analyses of TDMY and TDSCC, risk of failure, and risk of mortality, respectively.
