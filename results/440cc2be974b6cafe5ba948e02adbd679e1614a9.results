Impaired antibody responses to Gn and NP in deceased cases. Between April and October of 2016, 43 patients admitted into Nanjing Drum-Tower Hospital were confirmed with SFTSV infection. The peripheral blood samples of 30 patients, of whom 11 were deceased, were collected at multiple time points ranging from 3 to 18 days post symptom onset. Longitudinal serum antibody responses to NP and Gn of SFTS virus were determined by both ELISA and western blot (WB). Interestingly, the NP-specific IgM and IgG were completely absent from the deceased group from the symptom onset to death (Fig. 1a, b) . In contrast, NP-specific IgM was positive at early time points after symptom onset and remained positive during the entire hospital stay in all recovered patients. Among this group, 7 out of 10 patients had serum antibodies reaching the highest titers in the 1st week post symptom onset. As for serum NP-specific IgG (Fig. 1a, c, upper panel) , although four out of ten convalescent patients were negative in the 1st week, all of them became positive from the 2nd week post symptom onset and manifested increasing IgG titers during the 3-week clinical course. We further analyzed serum antibody to Gn and Gc, two viral structural glycoproteins that were expressed in mammalian cells and purified (Supplementary Fig. 1a and 1b) . In accordance with serological response to NP, the titers of Gn-specific IgG in recovered patients manifested increasing trend during the 3-week period after symptom onset, as compared with negative results in all deceased patients for the same period (Fig. 1d ), which were confirmed by WB detection of Gn-IgG during the 3rd week post symptom onset ( Supplementary Fig. 1c ). Distinct from IgM response to NP, Gn-specific serum IgM was positive in all deceased patients and in five out of ten survived patients in the 1st week ( Supplementary Fig. 1d ), but became undetectable in all patients in the following two weeks. Interestingly, none of the patient sera reacted with Gc. Together, the absence of both NPand Gn-specific IgG in the deceased patients indicates that the defective serological responses to the pathogen are associated with the fatal outcome (Figs. 1e, f). Deficient specific IgG contributed to persistent viremia. To investigate if the defective antibody responses were associated with viremia, serum viral loads were determined at the corresponding time points. The quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the serum viral loads of all survived patients gradually decreased during acute phase of SFTS, and became undetectable within 7-12 days after symptom onset (Fig. 2a) . Strikingly, all deceased patients maintained continuously high levels of viremia from symptom onset until they succumbed to the disease. The viral loads of the deceased group were significantly higher than the survived group in the 3-week period post symptom onset (p < 0.005). The mean log 10 values of the viral load in the deceased patients were 7.5, 8.2 and 8.0 for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd weeks, respectively, as compared with 5.3, 1.9 and 0 in the survived patients (Fig. 2a) . NP-IgG titers had strong association with serum viral load as shown by correlation analysis of the dynamic data of 10 survived and 5 deceased patients (Fig. 2b) , suggesting that virus-specific IgG exerted crucial effect in viral clearance. However, the correlation between NP-IgM titers with the viral load was not significant (Fig. 2b) . In order to confirm the role of virus-specific antibodies in the clearance of virus, we further investigated the neutralization activity of Gnspecific antiserum from an immunized camel, and sera from a convalescent patient and a deceased patient (Fig. 2c) . The results showed that the sera of both Gn-immunized camel and the convalescent patient effectively neutralized SFTSV, with 50% FRNT value at 0.118 ± 0.001 and 0.009 ± 0.002, respectively. In comparison, the serum from the deceased patient failed to show any significant neutralization. Dysregulation of peripheral B-cell subsets in fatal patients. To understand how the peripheral B-cell subsets were impacted with respect to humoral response during acute SFTSV infection, we analyzed various B-cell subtypes in PBMCs by flow cytometry ( Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). B-cell subsets were defined phenotypically as reported 19, 20 : naive (CD19 + IgD + CD27 − ), memory (MB, CD19 + IgD − CD27 + ), plasmablast (PB, CD19 + IgD − CD27 high ), marginal zone-like B cells (MZ, CD19 + IgD + CD27 + ), and double-negative B cells (CD19 + IgD − CD27 − ). The composition of total B cells in acute phase of SFTS was presented in Fig. 3b . We and others had previously reported that disease outcome did not impact on the numbers of patient's leukocytes and lymphocytes 8, 21 . The regulation of the proportion and numbers of each B-cell subset also exhibited high consistency. The proportion of naive B cells within total peripheral B cells of the deceased and the survived groups was significantly lower than that of the healthy control in the 3-week period post symptom onset (Fig. 3c) . Interestingly, the mean weekly frequency of the naive B cells in the deceased group dramatically reduced to only 6.8, 5.7, and 5.2 in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd weeks, respectively, in contrast to 25.4, 23.3, and 21.6 in the survived group. This observation suggests an overwhelming activation and exhaustion of naive B cells in the process of robust viral replication. We then evaluated the dynamics of two important effector B-cell subsets, PB, and MB cells, both of which differentiate from naive B cells (Figs. 3d, e) . The frequencies and numbers of both PBs and MBs subsets in both survived and deceased patients were significantly higher than that of the healthy control. Although the fraction of MBs in total B cells did not differ between the deceased and the survived groups, the fraction of PBs in the deceased group increased significantly more than the survived group during the entire acute phase (Fig. 3d) . The significant increase of PBs is in stark contrast to the absence of serological response in the deceased patients, but nevertheless it is consistent with an earlier report that defective T-cell participation led to a surge of PBs during VSV infection 22 . The MZ B cells, another relatively small but essential subset, were significantly lower in the deceased group than that in both the survived and the healthy groups, and manifested a decline with the progression of SFTS (Fig. 3f) . The frequency of IgD − CD27 − subset notably increased with the disease aggravation in the deceased group, and reached 56.7% of total B cells in the 3rd week as compared with 40.0% in the survived group (Fig. 3g ). Further investigation of the IgD − CD27 − B-cell compartment (Fig. 3h ) demonstrated that the mean frequency of IgM + cells in the survived, deceased and healthy control groups was 26.8, 19.6, and 31.0%, respectively, as compared with the corresponding frequency of IgG + cells at only 4.9, 3.5, and 1.3%. However, both the IgG and IgM fractions in IgD − CD27 − B cells showed no significance difference among three groups (Fig. 3i) . The CD21 negative fraction of IgM + IgD − CD27 − B cells in the deceased group was 89.9%, and significantly higher than in the other two groups. IgM + IgD − CD27 − B cells were phenotypically defined as B-cell precursors in bone marrow 23 , and the expression of CD21 in this subset could reflect the degree of maturation during B-cell ontogeny 24 . Therefore, due to the extremely large fraction of CD21 − B cells in IgM + IgD − CD27 − subset of the deceased patients, we inferred that the dysfunction of pre-B-cell maturation might be involved in the dramatic reduction of mature naive B cells with CD27 − IgD + phenotype. week. The similar phenomenon was also reported in Ebola virus infection 25 . The magnitude of PB expansion in the deceased group was markedly higher than that in the survived group during all three weeks. The proportion of MBs showed no significant differences between the two groups of patients as shown in Fig. 4b . Analysis of immunoglobulin expression by FACS demonstrated no significant differences in class-unswitched IgM + IgG − PBs among three groups (Fig. 4b) . However, class-switched IgM a b Correlation of NP-IgG and viral loads 2 4 2 3 2 2 2 1 2 0 2 4 2 3 2 2 2 1 2 0 Fig. 2 Correlation between serum viral load and virus-specific antibodies. a Serum viral load of 17 survived and 10 deceased patients at different day point was determined by RT-PCR, and then their kenetics of viremia during acute phase of SFTS was generated in the left panel. The level of serum viral load of the survived and deceased group during the 3-week clinical course was compared using T test in the right panel, ** p < 0.005. b Linear regression analysis of correlations between viral load and NP-specific antibodies. X-axis denotes the dilution fold of the patients' serum samples that gives detectable signal of NP-specific antibodies, and negative means undetectable antibodies at any dilution fold. r and p indicate the correlation coefficient and the p value of significance, respectively. p < 0.05 is considered as significant. c Neutralization of SFTSV by sera from the Gn-immunized camel, convalescent and fatal patients were shown by fluorescence staining (left panel), and percentage of infection reduction as indicated in 50% FRNT value (right panel). Non-specific neutralization effects of both human and camel sera were shown in blue. The data were from two independent experiments, and each data point from duplicate wells (means ± s.e.m). Error bar represents the standard deviation − IgG + PBs in the survived patients exhibited steady elevation from the 1st week, and continued to the 2nd week, as compared with the drastic decline in the deceased patients, which was even significantly lower than the healthy control (Fig. 4b) . It is interesting that a large fraction of IgM − IgG − PBs in PBMCs was observed in the deceased patients, representing 71.2, 54.6, and 65.2 of the total PBs in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd weeks, respectively, as compared with only 31.3, 31.1, and 30.6% in the survived group ( Supplementary Fig. 3g ). Considering that PBs could secret other immunoglobulin isotypes besides IgG and IgM 27 , we further measured IgA and IgD expression in these PBs ( Fig. 4c -d) and found that only low levels of IgD + and IgA + fractions were detected in the PBs and they showed no significant difference between the two patient groups. Taken together, we conclude that a relatively large fraction of CD27 + CD38 + B-cell subset in the deceased patients didn't secret IgG, IgM, IgD, and IgA isotypes. The transcriptional profile of PBs was investigated by analyzing the expression of BLIMP-1, IRF-4, and XBP-1, three key genes involved in the antibody-secreting network 27 . When proceeding to the antibody-secreting phase, B cells significantly upregulate the expression of BLIMP-1, IRF-4 and XBP-1. The result showed that the expression of all three genes in PBs was significantly down-modulated in the deceased group ( Fig. 4e-f ). To further illustrate the functional regulation of ASC in SFTS patients, we performed an Elispot assay, which captures virus-specific IgG after cell stimulation in vitro using samples from three patients, representing different temporal phases and clinical outcomes. R848, an TLR agonist, was used as the non-specific stimulator 28 . The samples of two survived patients, P28 and P29, were collected at the early and later phases of acute SFTSV infection, respectively. The sample of patient P30 was collected one day before death. PB of two survived patients, but not of the deceased patient, produced Gn-specific IgG (Fig. 4g) . Moreover, the stimulation with the combination of R848 and Gn protein produced more specific IgG secretion than with only R848 in the survived patients. The kinetics of IgM and IgG expression in MBs showed that in the survived patients the fraction of IgM + IgG − MBs gradually declined with IgG + IgM -MBs significantly elevated until the 3rd week post symptom onset (Fig. 4b , middle at lower panel), indicating a later class-switching response in MBs than that in PBs. By comparison with the healthy control, the proportion of Robust pTfh differentiation emerged in survived patients. To understand the roles of Tfh in the B-cell immunity against SFTSV, we defined the pTfh phenotypically as CD3 + CD4 + ICOS + CXCR5 + PD-1 + [9] and gated them on PBMCs as shown in panel D (Fig. 5a) . We analyzed IL-21 expression in pTfh after in vitro stimulation with Leukocyte Activation Cocktail by FACS and RT-PCR. The number of pTfh in the survived, but not the deceased patients showed robust increase in the 1st week, as compared with that in the healthy control (Fig. 5b, right panel) , and then gradually decreased in the following two weeks to the baseline (Fig. 5b) , suggesting that pTfh expansion in the early stage of acute SFTVS infection is associated with the recovery of the disease. Moreover, the expression of ICOS, a surface molecule for Tfh migration to GC [29] [30] [31] , showed no significant difference among three groups (Fig. 5c, left panel) . However, PD-1 expression on pTfh in the deceased patients maintained a significantly higher level than that in both the survived patients and the healthy control (Fig. 5c, right  panel) . The expression of ICOS, PD-1 and IL-21 by individual patients as measured by FACS was shown in Supplementary Fig. 6 . FACS analysis of IL-21 expression in pTfh of selected SFTS patients (6 deceased and 12 survived) demonstrated that the proportion of IL-21 + pTfh was significantly higher in the survived patients than that in the deceased patients in the 1st and 2nd weeks post symptom onset (Fig. 5d, left panel) . In addition, RT-PCR analysis also showed that the relative gene expression of IL-21 in the sorted pTfh of the survived patients was significantly higher than that of the deceased patients (Fig. 5d, right panel) . To further explore the influence of pTfh on B-cell maturation, we performed a CD4 + B-cell helper assay by placing the pTfh sorted from SFTS patients in co-culture with autologous naive B cells, and assessed proliferation and CD38/ IgM expression by FACS (Fig. 5e) . Although both CD38 and IgM expression showed no significant differences in B cells between the survived or deceased patients, the greater proliferation of naive B cells was still observed when co-cultured with autologous pTfh from the survived individuals (Fig. 5f) . Collectively, these data indicated the impairment of Tfh in promoting B-cell immunity during fatal SFTSV infection. Severe monocyte apoptosis and inhibited mDC differentiation. Monocytes represent the most abundant circulating pool of DCs 19 , which play critical roles in the development of adaptive immune response by presenting antigens and providing costimulatory signals to both T and B cells 10 . We, therefore, analyzed apoptosis of the adherent cells of PBMC, which consist of about 90% of monocytes 32, 33 in the 1st week post symptom onset. Strikingly, the positive rates of both annexin V and PI in the adherent cells from the deceased patients were significantly higher than those in the survived patients and the healthy control (Fig. 6a, b) , indicating monocytes undergoing severe apoptosis at an early stage of SFTSV infection. Moreover, in vitro infection assay indicated that the annexin V + PI − and annexin V + PI + proportions of SFTSV-infected mDCs, representing the early apoptotic cells and late apoptotic cells, respectively, were significantly higher than that with mock infection (Fig. 6c, d) . We then investigated the differentiation and function of mDCs by FACS in patients' blood samples. mDCs were gated as CD14 − B220 − CD11c + CD123 − HLA-DR + on PBMCs and B220 − was used as a lineage control (Fig. 6e) since B cells will be the major interference to the selection of CD14 − CD11c + CD123 − HLA-DR + as mDCs' markers 34 . The robust differentiation of mDCs in the survived, but not in the deceased patients, initiated at the 2nd week and sustained to the 3rd week post symptom onset ( Fig. 6f and Supplementary Fig. 4a ). The expression of co-stimulatory molecule CD86 on mDCs from the 2nd week and the proportion of CD80 + CD86 + /mDCs in the 3rd week of the survived patients were significantly higher than that of the deceased patients, as the expression of CD80 showed no meaningful difference between both patients' groups (Fig. 6g, h) . These data suggest that the differential activation of mDCs in the survived and the deceased ARTICLE patients was mainly due to the expression of CD86, which may impact on their antigen presentation function. In order to further evaluate the antigen-presentation function of mDCs during SFTS virus infection, we isolated mDCs from peripheral blood of healthy donors and performed allogenic DC/T-cell co-culture and stimulation assay using in vitro infection model [35] [36] [37] (Fig. 6i, j) . When mDCs were infected with SFTS virus, the proliferation rate of T cells as measured by CFSE tagging and the level of IFN-γ in the supernatant were significantly lower than that of the mock infection, demonstrating that mDC activation of T cells could be inhibited by SFTS virus infection. Inhibited HLA-DR/CD80 on peripheral B cells in fatal cases. Bcell antigen presentation, in cooperation with DCs, facilitated Tfh differentiation and GC formation 11 . Previous study revealed that a small subset of B cells mainly located at the T-cell B-cell border of lymphoid organs were involved in the process 38 . Therefore, we indirectly estimated antigen-presenting function of this B-cell subset by calculating the expression of CD80 and HLA-DR on peripheral B cells (Fig. 7a) . HLA-DR + CD80 + expression had been proved to be a key factor affecting the B-cell antigen presentation 39 . In the deceased patients, the HLA-DR expression on total B cells, MBs, MZ B and CD27 − IgD − B cells was significantly more down-regulated than that in the survived patients in the 3rd week (Fig. 7c) , as shown by the dynamics of the HLA-DR + CD80 + B cells ( Fig. 7b ; Data of individual patients were shown in Supplementary Fig. 5) . Meanwhile, the proportion of CD80 + HLA-DR + cells and the CD80 expression in total B cells, MBs Fig. 6 Apoptosis of peripheral monocytes and differentiation of myeloid DC. a Apoptosis of peripheral monocytes in deceased (P17) and survived (P22) patients, and healthy control, as shown by annexin V and PI staining.

Serum Th-related cytokine kinetics during acute infection. Cytokines are important to the maturation and function of Tfh and DCs. We, therefore, determined relevant cytokines in SFTS patients' sera using a highly sensitive Milliplex chip (Fig. 8a) . A radar plot analysis was presented in Fig. 8b to show the dynamic profile of the cytokine regulation during the three weeks of acute infection. In the 1st week, serum levels of IFN-γ, IL-23, IL-12 and IL-10 increased dramatically in the deceased patients, with IL-4 and TNF-α increased to a less extent as compared with these in the survived patients whose GM-CSF level was higher. In the 2nd week, IFN-γ, IL-23, IL-12 and IL-10 showed declining trend in the deceased group, but still had higher levels than those in the survived group except for IL-12. During the same period, IL-6 and TNF-α, two representative inflammatory cytokines, were markedly elevated in the deceased patients. Although nearly all cytokines measured in the deceased patients decreased further in the final week, as compared with those in the previous two weeks, IL-6 and TNFα still maintained higher level than those in the survived patients. However, serum IL-1β and IL-4 in the survived patients markedly elevated accompanied by improved clinical course. Interestingly, the level of IL-21 in the sera of nearly all individuals was undetectable.
