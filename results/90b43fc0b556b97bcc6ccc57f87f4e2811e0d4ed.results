Generation of BatIV from plasmids. We first attempted to generate H17N10 BatIV by transfecting human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells with 8 pol-I plasmids providing viral RNA templates and 4 pCAGGS plasmids expressing the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and polymerases required for viral RNA transcription/replication. To confirm the expression of HA, NA, and viral matrix protein (M1) in the transfected cells, cell lysates and supernatants were analyzed by western blotting. We detected H17 HA, N10 NA, and M1 as approximately 70 kDa, 70 kDa, and 27 kDa bands, respectively, in the cell lysates (Fig. 1a) , suggesting that plasmid-driven viral RNA transcription/replication successfully occurred in the transfected cells. We further confirmed that these viral proteins were detectable in the supernatants of the transfected cells (Fig. 1b) . Pol-I and pCAGGS plasmids providing viral RNA and proteins of H18N11 BatIV were also constructed and similarly used for generation of the virus.
