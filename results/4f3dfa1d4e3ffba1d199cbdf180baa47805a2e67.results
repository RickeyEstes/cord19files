Twenty-five articles were identified from the search (Fig. 3) . All the included articles were case reports, or case series of 1-7 patients. Altogether 44 cases were reported in which NGS provided a diagnosis in otherwise undiagnosed cases of encephalitis (Table 1 ). An exponential temporal increase in cases has been observed over the last decade (Fig. 4) . Country of origin of cases included Australia, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Poland, Sri Lanka, UK, USA, and Vietnam. Samples were analysed in laboratories largely in the USA and Europe (UK, France, Germany, Poland), but also in China, Japan and Vietnam. Among the 27 cases for which age was documented, the median age was 14 years (Interquartile range 3-61). Of the 22 cases that reported immune status of the patient, 73% (16/22) were immunocompromised. There was uniformly poor reporting of encephalitis or meningoencephalitis case definitions, and limited explanation of diagnostic assays performed and algorithms used for testing. None of the studies reported adherence to published or unpublished clinical guidelines.
