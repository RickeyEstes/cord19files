For the 2017-2018 influenza season, 4041 out of 11,943 specimens tested positive for influenza (33.8%) (Data not shown). There were 3869 specimens identified as other respiratory pathogens (32.4%). The remaining 4033 specimens resulted as negative (33.8%) (Data not shown). Of the 11,943 specimens, 2474 (20.7%) specimens were excluded from our population based on the exclusionary criteria described in the Methods section, leaving a final study population of 9469 unique people (Data not shown). The study population was predominantly male, Active Duty service members, aged 18-35 years old (Tables 1 and 2) . A majority of the study population was vaccinated (Tables 1 and 2 ). Most respiratory specimens were analyzed during the winter (December, January, and February) months (Tables 1 and 2) . Those who tested positive for a respiratory virus other than influenza had a similar breakdown for sex, vaccination status, and season of illness when compared to pan-negatives ( Table 1) . The other respiratory positive group had more child beneficiaries, and was overall younger than the pan-negative group (Table 1) . Examining demographic characteristics stratified by vaccination status, males were more likely to be vaccinated than females (Table 2) . Active Duty members were more likely to be vaccinated than people with other beneficiary statuses ( Table 2 ). The younger aged population was more likely to be unvaccinated when compared to other age groups ( Table 2 ). Composition of lab results (Other respiratory virus, influenza, and no pathogen detected) was distributed fairly evenly among the vaccinated population; however, unvaccinated people were more likely to have their specimen resulted as influenza (Table 2) . Winter was the predominate season for illness and specimen testing ( Table 2) . Among the study population, 4549 people had AFCITA vaccination records (48.0%) while 4920 people self-reported vaccination status via questionnaire (52.0%) (Data not shown). Examining the population with other respiratory viruses and no virus detected, those who were vaccinated had 19% lower unadjusted odds (95% CI: 0.72, 0.91) of having other respiratory viruses compared to those who were unvaccinated (Table 3) . After adjusting for age group, the odds were 3% lower (95% CI: 0.86, 1.09) of having other respiratory viruses in the vaccinated population ( Table 3 ). The unadjusted (data not shown) were statistically significant; however, the adjusted odds did not remain statistically significant (p = 0.60) ( Table 3 ). Since self-reported vaccination status may not be accurate and may bias results, those with AFCITA confirmed vaccination were examined exclusively. Those who were vaccinated according AFCITA records had 5% lower unadjusted odds (95% CI: 0.68, 1.34) of having other respiratory viruses compared to those who were unvaccinated (Table 3) . Adjusting for age group and seasonality increased the odds to 23% higher (95% CI: 0.86, 1.76) of having other respiratory viruses in the vaccinated population (Table 3) . Neither the unadjusted odds (data not shown) nor the adjusted odds (p = 0.24) in the AFCITA population were significant. Virus interference was also examined among Active Duty only for the 2017-2018 season. Those who were vaccinated had slightly lower unadjusted odds (OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.73, 1.29) of having other respiratory viruses compared to those who were unvaccinated (Table 3 ). After adjusting for age and season, these odds increased to a 20% higher odds (95% CI: 0.89, 1.61) of having other respiratory viruses in the vaccinated population; however, the unadjusted (data not shown) and adjusted (p = 0.24) odds ratios were not statistically significant (Table 3) . Both the unadjusted and adjusted odds of influenza were significantly lower in the vaccinated population for all three of the control groups ( Table 4 ). The adjusted ORs ranged from 0.46 (pan-negative comparison) to 0.51 (non-influenza virus positive comparison) ( Table 4 ). The 95% CI for the adjusted ORs of all three comparison groups overlapped and no differences were detected among each control group when compared to influenza cases. The odds of testing positive for individual respiratory viruses by vaccination status were also examined ( Table 5 ). The influenza vaccine was sufficient at protecting all influenza virus results tested for at a significant level except two (Influenza B Victoria and Influenza coinfections) ( Table 5 ). Both Influenza B Victoria and Influenza coinfections had reduced odds in the vaccinated cohort, but not at significant levels (Table 5 ). Examining noninfluenza viruses specifically, the odds of both coronavirus and human metapneumovirus in vaccinated individuals were significantly higher when compared to unvaccinated individuals (OR = 1.36 and 1.51, respectively) ( Table 5) . Conversely, all other non-influenza respiratory viruses had decreased odds in the vaccinated population, including significantly decreased odds ratios in vaccinated people with parainfluenza, RSV, and non-influenza virus coinfections (Table 5) . Additionally, the odds ratio in the no pathogen detected cohort was significantly higher in vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals (OR = 1.51) ( Table 5) .
