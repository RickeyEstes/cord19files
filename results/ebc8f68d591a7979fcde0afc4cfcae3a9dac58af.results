A putative amphipathic a-helix in BMV 1a is sufficient for membrane association Previously, using membrane affinity and protease sensitivity assays, we showed that BMV 1a strongly localizes to the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane despite lacking any detectable trans-membrane domain [24] . Membrane flotation assays of 1a deletion derivatives and GFP-fusion to truncated versions of 1a showed that a 105 amino acid (aa) region (aa 368-472, previously designated region E, Fig. 1A ) plays a major role in 1a-ER membrane binding [24] . In this region, a stretch of 35 amino acids (aa 388-422) is predicted to be predominantly ahelical. Within this helical region, a putative amphipathic a-helix core peptide of 18 amino acids (aa 392-409) can be recognized, which we will refer to as ''helix A''. One indication that helix A is likely important is that its amino acid sequence is evolutionarily highly conserved among the equivalent 1a replication proteins of other bromoviruses (Fig. 1A) . To test the functionality of helix A for membrane association, the 105, 35 and 18 aa regions described above were fused to the N-terminus of GFP to produce E-GFP, 35H-GFP, and 18H-GFP, respectively (Fig. 1B) . Lysates of yeast cells expressing these fusion proteins were loaded under flotation gradients, which upon centrifugation were fractionated and analyzed by SDS PAGE and western blotting using anti-GFP antibodies. As a measure of membrane association, flotation efficiency was determined as the percentage of total GFP or 1a-GFP fusion protein in the gradient that was present in the top two fractions. In these assays, less than 3% of wild type cytosolic GFP floated to the top of the gradient with the membrane fraction. Fusing the 35 aa region to GFP greatly increased membrane association up to 45%, which was as efficient as membrane association directed by the full 105 aa E region fused to GFP. The smaller 18H-GFP fusion protein retained about 30% flotation efficiency (Fig. 1B) . Thus, the 35 aa segment 388-422 accounts for essentially all of 1a's membrane association mediated by domain E, and the 18 aa helix A region retains most of this function and is sufficient to direct membrane association of GFP. NMR spectroscopy and mutational analysis confirm the a-helical and amphipathic nature of helix A A helical wheel projection of the 18 aa helix A core region shows that it has the potential to form an amphipathic a-helical cylinder with one side (the right side in Fig. 2 ) having a cluster of hydrophobic, non-polar residues including three leucines (L396, L400, L407) and two nearby positive-charged lysines (K403, K406), and the other (left) side of the helix mostly hydrophilic and polar residues (Fig. 2 , see also marked aa in Fig. 1A ). To test these predictions, we used NMR to resolve the structure of an 18 aa peptide with the core sequence (aa 392-409) of helix A. NMR spectra of this peptide dissolved in water did not reveal a long term
