IFN treatment induces secretion of capsid protein. IFN and the expression of ISGs can target almost any step of the viral life cycle. However, very little is known about the effect of IFN on particle assembly and egress of flaviviruses. To study viral particle release, we established an expression system that allows the generation of virus-like particles (VLPs) composed of the structural proteins C, prM, and E ( Fig. 1A) (26) . This system enabled us to study the secretion of VLPs into the supernatant of transfected A549 cells (Fig. 1B) . To test the influence of IFN-␣, we compared intracellular and extracellular abundance of flavivirus protein and particles in presence or absence of recombinant IFN-␣B/D (Fig. 1B) . The effect of IFN treatment on particle assembly was measured by quantifying the ratio between secreted E and C proteins (VLP) and E and C proteins in the cell lysate (Lysate). Surprisingly, compared to control treatment, IFN-␣B/D treatment led to a strong increase in C protein release, while the secretion of E protein remained unaltered (Fig. 1B ). Flavivirus C protein has not previously been described to be secreted separately from the other structural proteins. To test this, only TBEV C protein was expressed in A549 cells and found to be sufficient for protein release (Fig. 1C) . Again, treatment of transfected cells with IFN-␣B/D led to an increase of C protein secreted to the supernatant (Fig. 1C) . Collectively, this suggested that type I IFN affect the viral structural proteins differently, indicating that C and E proteins are secreted by different mechanisms. Capsid particles are membrane associated and exit the ER via a COPII dependent mechanism bypassing the Golgi compartment. Since flavivirus C protein secretion has not been described before, we set out to characterize the phenomenon in detail. The C protein detected in the supernatant could be released from cells as soluble proteins, protein aggregates, or membrane-associated proteins. To characterize the nature of the secreted C protein, a flotation assay was performed. C protein floated up and behaved ( Fig. 2A , first row) in the same manner as Langat virus (LGTV; a low-virulence member of the TBEV serogroup, which has been used extensively as a nonpathogenic models for TBEV) and VLPs containing prM and E ( Fig. 2A ). This showed that the C protein released from cells was membrane associated. After the addition of detergent, the C protein was mainly found in the pellet ( Fig. 2A , second row, fraction 6), confirming the membrane association. Analysis of the enriched C-particle fraction using electron microscopy revealed particles with a round morphology similar to LGTV and VLPs containing C, prM, and E (Fig. 2B) . It is generally assumed that flavivirus virions assemble in the ER and exit via the conventional secretory pathway (7, 27) , and lipid droplets have been suggested to play a role in DENV encapsidation (28) . However, to gain further information on the exact localization of TBEV C protein, we performed confocal analysis of cells transfected with plasmid encoding C-FLAG. The C protein was found in the nucleus and colocalized with E and the ER marker calnexin (ER) but not with GM130 (Golgi matrix protein) and was only in some cells associated with lipid droplets ( Fig. 3A and B). To specifically block COPII-mediated transport from the ER toward the ERGIC (ER-Golgi intermediate compartment) and Golgi compartment, a dominant-active mutant of the small GTPase Sar1 (Sar1-H79G) was overexpressed, together with prME or C, and progeny particles were monitored. The Sar1 mutant binds to the ER and initiate the COPII coat protein recruitment but is not able to detach from the ER, thereby blocking ER-to-Golgicompartment transport (29) . The overexpression of Sar1-H79G blocked both prMEparticle and C-particle release ( Fig. 3C and D) , suggesting that COPII-mediated antero-FIG 2 C protein is released as membrane-associated particles. (A) A flotation assay was used to determine the membrane association of C protein, prME VLPs, or LGTV. Supernatant from HeLa cells, which were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing C-FLAG or prM and E, and VeroB4 cells infected with LGTV were concentrated by ultracentrifugation, followed by a flotation assay. The gradient was fractionated from top to bottom and analyzed by immunoblot analysis. Representative blots from two independent experiments are shown. (B) Morphology of VLPs and LGTV as determined by transmission electron microscopy. Supernatant from cells transfected with C-FLAG or the structural proteins C, prM, and E or infected with LGTV were harvested, concentrated by using a flotation assay, and analyzed by negative staining after glutaraldehyde fixation. Representative images are shown. FIG 3 E and C localize to the ER and prME VLP release is COPII and COPI dependent, whereas C-particle release is only COPII dependent. Intracellular localization of C-FLAG with different cellular markers (A). HeLa cells were transfected with C-FLAG, fixed, and stained using antibodies against FLAG, calnexin (ER), and GM130 (Golgi). Lipid droplets were stained with Bodipy 493/503 at 1 g/ml. For a clear arrangement, the lipid droplets are colored red in the overlay. (B) HeLa cells transfected with C-FLAG, prM, and E protein were stained with antibodies against FLAG and TBEV E. (C) Secretion of prME protein was analyzed in HeLa cells transfected with or without Sar1 H79G (dominant-active mutant) by immunoblot analysis.

Immunoblot analysis showing the intracellular expression of E and C, and also E and C secreted from transfected HeLa cells treated with 0.5 g/ml BFA (E and F, respectively). Representative blots are shown; the graphs show the quantification (means and standard deviations from n ϭ 3 [C, D, and E] and n ϭ 4 [F] Western blot experiments), where protein in the supernatant (VLP) was normalized to protein in the lysate. Significance was calculated using a Student t test (*, P Ͻ 0.05; **, P Ͻ 0.01). grade transport is involved in the release of C particles. Next, the cells were treated with brefeldin A (BFA), which blocks both retrograde transport via COPI vesicles and the secretion from the trans-Golgi compartment via clathrin-coated vesicles and subsequently causes disruption of the Golgi apparatus (30) . This leads to a collapse of the Golgi compartment into the ER and thereby blocks the release of proteins via this pathway (31) . BFA efficiently inhibited the secretion of prME particles (Fig. 3E ). However, BFA increased the secretion of C particles similar to the IFN treatment ( Fig. 3F and Fig. 1C ). Our data suggest that C protein is released as membrane-associated particles and transported from the ER via a COPII-dependent mechanism. However, whereas virus particles and prME VLPs use the classical COPI-dependent secretory pathway, the C particles are released from the cell via a different mechanism, which is induced by both BFA and IFN treatment. Viperin enhances the release of TBEV capsid particles. To our knowledge, an ISG that positively regulates and induce budding of particles has not been reported. TBEV is budding into the ER and a prominent ISG that localizes to this compartment is viperin. Viperin has previously been reported to inhibit assembly and egress of influenza A and HIV-1 (21, 22) and inhibits TBEV replication (19) . Interestingly, the effect on TBEV particle release is greater than the effect on RNA replication (19) , suggesting a viperin activity on posttranscriptional level. Viperin colocalized with calnexin ( Fig. 4A ), confirming it is localization to the ER. Moreover, we could colocalize viperin with C and E protein (Fig. 4A) , suggesting an involvement of viperin in particle formation. To assay the effect of viperin on virus protein secretion, we cotransfected FLAGtagged C and viperin into 293 FLP-IN T Rex cells expressing prME upon addition of tetracycline (tet). The accumulation of secreted proteins in the supernatant was analyzed by immunoblotting for E protein and C-FLAG, respectively. Expression of viperin did not have an effect on TBEV prME-particle secretion (Fig. 4B ) or NS1 protein secretion (data not shown). However, the amount of released C protein increased drastically in the presence of viperin (Fig. 4B ). The positive effect on C protein release depended on the dose of transfected viperin (Fig. 4C ). In agreement with this, C particles were detected in the supernatant by electron microscopy when C-FLAG and viperin were coexpressed (Fig. 4D ). Next, we analyzed which domains in viperin were involved in the enhanced release of C, using transient transfection of different mutated versions of viperin (Fig. 4E ). Truncation in the C terminus (Δ342-361) and the mutant in the radical SAM motif (M1) did not impair the ability of viperin to induce secretion of C protein (Fig. 4F ). However, deletion of the N-terminal amphipathic alpha-helix (Δ1-50, also known as TN50 [19] ), which directs the protein to the ER (14) significantly reduced the potency of viperin to promote C protein release ( Fig. 4F and G) . To verify the antiviral effect of viperin on particle release during viral infection, 293 FLP-IN T Rex cells inducibly expressing viperin upon addition of tet were infected with a high multiplicity of LGTV. Viperin showed a clear antiviral activity against LGTV (Fig. 5) , and the antiviral effect was stronger on released viral particles (Fig. 5B) and infectivity (Fig. 5E ) than on the viral RNA (Fig. 5D ) and viral proteins in the cell lysate (Fig. 5A ). The total amount of C protein in the supernatant compared to the E protein ( Fig. 5B and C) was greatly enhanced in the presence of viperin (Fig. 5C) . Collectively, our data show that viperin induces C protein release both during viral infection and in transient transfected cells expressing C protein. This function requires localization to the ER and does not impair other cellular secretion systems. Viperin interacts with GBF1 and induce C-particle secretion. Next, we aimed to reveal the mechanism behind viperin-induced secretion of C particles. As no direct interaction between viperin and C protein could be detected (data not shown), host factors might be involved. We therefore used an affinity proteomics approach to study cellular interaction partners of viperin. We precipitated wild-type (wt) viperin, the Δ1-50 viperin mutant, or GFP as a control and analyzed associated proteins by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Fig. 6A) . We identified 115 proteins specifically binding to viperin or the Δ1-50 mutant ( Fig.  6B and C; see also Table S1 in the supplemental material). Direct comparison of viperin to the Δ1-50 mutant identified 34 proteins that were significantly more enriched in the wt protein precipitates compared to precipitations with the mutant protein (Fig. 6D , red and green dots). Ciao1 identified previously (19) is comparably well enriched by wt viperin and Δ1-50 mutant, suggesting that the immunoprecipitation (IP) conditions were similar overall. As additional filter method we considered the subcellular localization of these proteins using annotations based on the Human Protein Atlas. This analysis showed that the majority proportion of candidates localized to the nucleus. However, three proteins ARL1 (ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 1), RCN2 (ERC-55; ER Ca2 ϩ binding protein, 55 kDa), and GBF1 (Fig. 6D, green dots) were annotated to localize to the ER or the Golgi compartment. Of these proteins, ARL1 has been reported to regulate intracellular trafficking between the plasma membrane, endosomes, and
