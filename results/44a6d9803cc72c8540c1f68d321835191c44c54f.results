A total of 41,172 specimens were collected, of which 12,765 (31.0%) were from ILI and SARI patients sampled between weeks 20/2009 and 09/2011 ("universal" surveillance scheme), and 28,407 (69.0%) from SARI patients sampled between week 10/2011 and week 52/2016 ("sentinel" surveillance scheme) ( Table 1 ). In terms of age distribution, 27.7% and 31.3% of specimens were from children aged less than 1 year or 1-4 years, respectively; whereas 8.3% of specimens were taken among patients aged â‰¥65 years. Males and females provided 54.1% and 45.9% of all specimens, respectively. Almost all of the specimens were collected in the Sierra (51.5%) and in the Coast (47.3%) regions. The overall PDR during the study period was 26.8%: influenza (14.3%) and RSV (9.5%) were the most frequent causes of RVI, while parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and hMPV were respectively detected in 1.8%, 0.6% and 0.5% of respiratory specimens ( Table 1 ). The most frequently detected influenza virus (sub)type was A(H1N1)p (9.5%), followed by A(H3N2) (2.6%) and B (1.2%). Circulation of viruses varied by period: during 2009-11, the overall PDR was 31.3% and the 2009 influenza pandemic strain was found in 20.3% of specimens, while during 2011-16, the overall PDR was 24.8% and RSV accounted for nearly half of positive specimens (11.7%). Differences emerged also by region, as the most frequently detected virus was RSV in the Coast (11.0% of all specimens) and the pandemic strain in the Sierra (12.0%). In contrast, there were no differences in the overall and virus-specific PDR by gender.
