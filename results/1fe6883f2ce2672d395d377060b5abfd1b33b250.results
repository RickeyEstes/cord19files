Ion exchange chromatography of the extract of Chinese dull black soybeans on Q-Sepharose yielded an unadsorbed fraction devoid of trypsin-inhibitory activity and three adsorbed fractions of similar sizes (in terms of protein yields) eluted by 0.1 M NaCl, 0.4 M NaCl and 1 M NaCl in the Tris-HCl buffer, respectively. Trypsin-inhibitory activity resided only in fraction Q1 eluted with 0.1 M NaCl (Fig. 1A) . This fraction was next chromatographed on SP-Sepharose to yield an unadsorbed fraction without trypsininhibitory activity, a sharp adsorbed fraction SP1 eluted with 0.2 M NaCl, and a broad adsorbed fraction SP2 eluted with 1 M NaCl in the starting buffer (Fig. 1B) . Fraction SP1, with trypsin-inhibitory activity eluted with 0.2 M NaCl, was fractionated on Mono Q to yield a small unadsorbed fraction S1 and a broad adsorbed fraction S2, both without trypsin-inhibitory activity. Trypsin-inhibitory activity was located in the sharp and more strongly adsorbed fraction S3 (Fig. 1C) . This fraction yielded a single sharp peak with a molecular mass of 40 kDa upon FPLC-gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column which has been calibrated with markers with molecular weights ranging from 67 to 17 kDa (not shown). The peak from Superdex 75 appeared as a single band with a molecular mass of about 20 kDa in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) . The purification of dull black soybean trypsin inhibitor is summarized in Table 1 . There was 65fold purification. The N-terminal sequence of the purified trypsin inhibitor was highly homologous to those of Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors from yellow soybean, wild soybean and spinach ( Table 2) . Dull black soybean trypsin inhibitor and soybean trypsin inhibitor more potently inhibited trypsin than they inhibited chymotrypsin (Fig. 3) . Dithiothreitol dose-dependently and timedependently inhibited the trypsin-inhibitory activity of dull black soybean and soybean trypsin inhibitors (Fig. 4) . The trypsininhibitory activity of BSKTI was totally preserved after exposure to the entire pH range (1-14) for 2 h, and after exposure to temperatures up to 80 8C for 10 min. Only 80 and 70% activity remained after exposure for 10 min to 90 and 100 8C, respectively (data not shown). The dull black soybean trypsin inhibitor enhanced nitric oxide production by murine macrophages, and so did lipopolysaccharide and Con A (Fig. 5A ). The enhancement was in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B ). The enhancement caused by soybean trypsin inhibitor was only minimal. The dull black soybean inhibitor inhibited proliferation of HepG2 cells and MCF7 cells with an IC 50 of 39 and 70 mM, respectively. The corresponding values for soybean trypsin inhibitor were lower, being 31 and 47 mM, respectively ( Fig. 6A and B) . Dull black soybean trypsin inhibitor inhibited HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an IC 50 of 9.4 mM (Fig. 7) . Soybean trypsin inhibitor was inactive. Dull black soybean trypsin inhibitor inhibited translation in the cell-free rabbit reticulocyte system with an IC 50 of 14 mM. Soybean trypsin inhibitor did not have translation-inhibitory activity (Fig. 8) . There was no effect of the two trypsin inhibitors on mitogenic response of splenocytes and the activities of HIV-1 integrase and SARS proteinase (data not shown). Antifungal and antibacterial activities were also absent (data not shown).
