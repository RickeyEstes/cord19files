About 8% of the abnormal faecal samples, and none of the normal faecal samples, contained "virus-like" particles. The "virus-like" particles were usually spherical and had a thick wall which was penetrated by numerous pores (Fig. I ) . This wall appears to be rigid as the particles are not readily distorted on the grid. When damaged particles were observed they appeared to be cracked open ( Fig. 2) . The particles did not disintegrate into a cluster of subunits as has been observed with a number of other viruses. Indented particles were observed (Fig. 3 ) Often the particles were penetrated by stain but when they were not penetrated the detailed surface texture became apparent (Fig. 1) . When the particles were penetrated by stain, no regular internal component was observed, but they did not appear to be completely empty ( Fig. 2) . 3 . "Virus-like" particles of two different size\. larger particle (thick arrow) smaller particle ( thin arrow) bar equal5 100 "tn. The particles ranged from 100 nm to about 300 nm. Usually in any one sample there were particles of one size but occasionally particles of two different diameters were present in one sample ( Fig. 4 and Fig. 8) . The particles were usually scattered singly or in small groups throughout the sample ( Fig. 1) but, at times, larger groups or groups of over a hundred particles were observed bound within membranes (Fig. 5. Fig. 6 and Fig. 8 ). The particles often absorbed to gut bacteria (Fig. 7) . Parvovirus particles were observed in some samples containing the viruslike particles ( Fig. 8)
