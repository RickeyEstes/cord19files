The different stages of an epidemic pass quickly in an outbreak of respiratory infections in a small population (Fig 1) . In our simulated population of 1,000 people for an influenza-like pathogen (Scenario 1) there was an average delay of only 16.5 days (median, 95% prediction interval: 8.4, 26.2) from the introduction of 10 infectious individuals to peak incidence. The more transmissible, but slower Scenario 2 still achieved a peak of incidence after 23 days (18.1, 29.2) . In addition to an early peak of incidence, partial saturation occurred very quickly in this population. An initial exponential increase in incidence can be seen on the log y-axes in Fig 1  (as a straight line) . However, this exponential phase ends quickly in such a small population. In Scenario 1, incidence appears to be occurring sub-exponentially as early as 10 days after the initial seed. The speedy transition from exponential growth to partial depletion of susceptible individuals and then peak incidence permitted rapid and accurate univariate parameter estimation. We attempted to recover either R 0 or T g (but not both at this stage) from simulated data similar to those described above. As would be expected, for both Scenario 1 (Fig 2a and 2b showed 8 arbitrary epidemics and prediction intervals of 100 epidemics) and Scenario 2 (Fig 3a and 3b showed 8 arbitrary epidemics and prediction intervals of 100 epidemics), we were able to obtain accurate values of R 0 prior to the peak of the epidemics when T g was known, even during the earliest exponential phase of incidence. Estimates of R 0 did not become any more accurate once the peak of incidence had passed. Although the pattern of univariate inference for T g was similar to that for R 0 , the final confidence intervals were wider (in relative terms) than for R 0 . We extended our analysis of the univariate parameter estimation routines to test the model's performance (Fig 4 for Scenario 1) . For a day 50 in the simulated epidemic of 50 realizations, we held R 0 and T g constant in the simulated epidemics while varying the values of a) R 0 estimates, denoted asR 0 , or b) T g estimates, denoted asT g , by Â±1.5 in the likelihood function. Next, we repeated the process by c) varying R 0 from 1.0 to 3.0 and d) varying T g from 1.1 to 10.0 in the simulated epidemics, then computed the residuals of c)R 0 and d)T g from the likelihood function respectively as previously done. Nevertheless, it was possible to jointly estimate both R 0 and T g in this small population. We assumed that neither T g nor R 0 were known for an emerging pathogen and attempted to estimate them jointly for Scenario 1 (Fig 2c and 2d showed 8 arbitrary epidemics and prediction intervals of 100 epidemics) and Scenario 2 (Fig 3c and 3d showed 8 arbitrary epidemics and prediction intervals of 100 epidemics). Compared to the univariate cases, for both scenarios, reliable information was obtained on both R 0 and T g . However, prediction intervals were wider. Once the peak had been reached, the convergence of estimates of T g in bivariate case were achieved, but in relative terms, the accuracy was considerably lower. The estimates of different values of k were tabulated on Table 1 for the model using Poisson-distributed serial interval for the estimates on the last day of observation using different numbers of iterations: (i) 10, (ii) 20, (iii) 100, along with different k values.
