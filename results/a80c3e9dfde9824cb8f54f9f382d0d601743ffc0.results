Of the 75 patients, 71 (95%) were ethnic Chinese, and the remainder were Filipino. The male-to-female ratio was one to 0·92, and mean age was 39·8 (SD 12·2) years. Five patients were smokers. Underlying diseases were identified in 13 patients, including nine patients positive for HBsAg with no stigmata of chronic liver disease and normal liver function tests. The clinical symptoms on admission included fever in 75 (100%) patients, chills in 49 (65%), rigors in 42 (56%), myalgia in 51 (68%), cough in 22 (29%), sore throat in eight (11%), shortness of breath in three (4%), headache in 11 (15%), dizziness in three (4%), and diarrhoea in one (1%). Initial chest radiograph was abnormal in 53 (71%) patients; involvement was confined to one lung zone in 37 (49%) and was multizonal in 16 (21%). Lower-zone infiltrates or consolidation occurred in 45 (60%) patients. Initial high-resolution CT was done in 33 (44%) patients in whom the initial chest radiographs were normal, equivocal, or atypical. Of these 33 patients, 18 (55%) had abnormalities confined to one lobe. Multilobar involvement was seen in 15 (46%) patients. Focal ground-glass opacification was the only type of abnormality in eight (24%) patients. 12 (36%) patients had consolidation only, and 13 (39%) had both types of infiltrates. On haematological and biochemical investigation, anaemia was detected in six (8%), leucopenia in five (7%), severe lymphopenia of less than 1ϫ10 9 /L in 56 (75%), and thrombocytopenia in 28 (37%). Raised values were seen for alanine aminotransferase (42-343 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (39-302 U/L), and creatinine kinase (176-1466 U/L) in 22 (29%), 24 (32%), and 27 (36%) patients, respectively. The median lymphocyte counts decreased from 0·8ϫ10 9 /L (IQR 0·6-1·1) on admission to 0·6ϫ10 9 /L (0·5-0·9), 0·4ϫ10 9 /L (0·3-0·5), and 0·4ϫ10 9 /L (0·3-0·6) at days 7, 14, and 21, respectively. In terms of disease progression, all except one patient became afebrile within 48 h with the standard treatment protocol, but the fever recurred in 64 (85%) patients at a mean of 8·9 days (SD 3·1). Only ten of these patients had positive findings on sepsis work up: three had Stenotrophomonas maltophilia bacteraemia, four had clinical evidence of catheter-related sepsis, and three had nosocomial pneumonia due to Klebsiella pneumoniae (in two) and Escherichia coli (one). All these septic episodes responded to the appropriate antimicrobial treatment and removal of infected catheters. In the remaining 54 patients, fever recurred after a mean of 8·0 (2·1) days, which was unlikely to be caused by hospital-acquired infection. Between days 13 and 15, 17 (23%) patients developed another episode of fever (figure 1). Watery diarrhoea developed in 55 (73%) patients, with onset at a mean of 7·5 (2·3) days. The rate of diarrhoea peaked at a mean of 8·7 (2·3) days, with a maximum frequency of 6·3 (3·5) times daily (figure 1). Work up for diarrhoeal pathogens, including C difficile cytotoxin, was negative in all these patients. The mean duration of diarrhoea was 3·9 (2·3) days. Simultaneous occurrence of fever and diarrhoea occurred in 24 (32%) patients. Concomitant fever, diarrhoea, and radiological worsening occurred in 16 (21%) patients. Improvement of diarrhoea occurred in all patients by day 13. Radiological worsening was noted in 60 (80%) patients at a mean of 7·4 (2·2) days: 34 (45%) developed shifting of radiological lesions, evidenced by improvement of original lesions followed by the appearance of new lesions (figure 2); worsening of original lesions with or without (12) 0·79 concentration (g/L) Mean (SD) initial total peripheral 7·1 (2·1) 6·1 (2·1) 0·09 white blood cell count (ϫ10 9 /L) Mean (SD) initial lymphocyte 1·1 (0·9) 0·9 (0·4) 0·19 count (ϫ10 9 /L) Mean (SD) initial platelet 163 (56) 167 (41) 0·77 count (ϫ10 9 /L) figure 2 . 33 (44%) patients developed arterial oxygen desaturation of less than 90% at room air, at a mean of 9·1 (4·2) days after onset of symptoms (figure 1). 24 (32%) patients required intensive care at a mean of 11·0 (6·4) days, among whom 19 had to be intubated at a mean of 12·9 (6·4) days. 15 (20%) patients progressed to ARDS and required mechanical ventilation. On day 1 of mechanical ventilation for ARDS, the mean PaO 2 -to-FiO 2 ratio was 14·7 kPa (10·8) and the mean APACHE II score was 22·3 (5·8). Time to occurrence of ARDS showed a bimodal pattern, with one peak at 11·0 days and another peak at 20·0 days (figure 1). Seven patients developed hospital-acquired infection during their stay in the intensive-care unit, including hospital-acquired pneumonia in three, meticillinresistant Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteraemia in one, and clinical sepsis in three, without positive cultures. On univariate analysis, the risk factors associated with ARDS requiring ventilatory support and intensive care were age, male sex, chronic hepatitis B virus carriage, raised creatinine, and recurrence of fever (table 1). Lymphocyte counts of ARDS patients on days 7, 14, and 21 did not differ significantly from those in non-ARDS patients. On multivariate analysis, only age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection were significant risk factors (table 2) . The mean length of stay for 75 patients was 22·1 (3·1) days, whereas for the 15 patients who developed ARDS, the mean length of stay was 26·8 days at the time of writing. Five patients died during the study period, of whom two, aged 79 and 64 years, had succumbed to acute myocardial infarction on days 13 and 17, respectively. One patient died of clinical sepsis on day 23. Another two patients died of clinical sepsis and ARDS on days 24 and 25, respectively. 27 (36%) of patients were discharged home or transferred to a rehabilitation facility. One patient was transferred to a specialised obstetric unit for urgent delivery of a baby at 32 weeks' gestation. For the 42 patients who remained in the hospital, 13 were treated in intensive care for ARDS (table 3) The 20 patients initially documented to have SARSassociated coronavirus RNA in the nasopharyngeal aspirates on RT-PCR were serially followed up with sequential samples; the virological profile is shown in table 4. Quantitative RT-PCR of the nasopharyngeal aspirates showed an inverted V pattern, with mean geometric viral loads of 2·3ϫ10 5 copies per mL, and 1·9ϫ10 7 copies per mL, and 9·8ϫ10 4 copies per mL on days 5, 10, and 15, respectively, after onset of symptoms ( figure 4 ).
