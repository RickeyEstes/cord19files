Expression of NS5 induces a G 0 /G 1 phase arrest MNV-1 infection of RAW-Blue cells induces an arrest at the G 1 /S restriction point, increasing the G 0 /G 1 population in order to change the internal cellular environment to favor viral replication [20] . We sought to determine if a viral encoded protein was responsible by analysis of the non-structural proteins of MNV-1 for effects to the host cell cycle. The NS5 protein from caliciviruses is essential to viral RNA transcription and translation and is essential for calicivirus replication. The NS5 protein has been shown to bind host eukaryotic translation initiation factors, recruiting these proteins for preferential viral translation and potentially inhibiting host protein expression [11, 30] . We hypothesized that an inhibition of host protein expression may contribute to a cell cycle arrest. The effect of NS5 on the host cell cycle was therefore determined by transfection of RAW-Blue cells with RNA transcripts, encoding individual viral genes, NS1-2 from MNV-1 was included as a negative control (Fig 1A) . NS1-2 and NS5 were detected by their corresponding antibodies 18 h posttransfection (Fig 1C) . Expression of NS5 increased the population of cells in the G 0 /G 1 phase by 28% and decreased the S phase by 27% when compared to the mock-transfected population ( Fig 1B) . Furthermore, NS5 expression decreased cyclin A expression by 68% when compared to the mock-transfected control ( Fig 1D) . The cyclin A protein governs S phase entry and progression, so a decrease in expression would imply a decrease in S phase entry, further indicating NS5 as the protein responsible for the MNV-1 induced cell cycle manipulation. NS1-2 had no significant effects on the host cell cycle or cyclin A expression.
