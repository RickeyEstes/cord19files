There were nine tertiary level pediatric EDs comprising 150 participants. Three sites were already routinely using MDI/spacers in the ED ('early adopters'), two sites were in the adoption process, and the remaining four sites had not yet adopted the innovation. Category membership was based on results from the study by Osmond et al [6] and was verified by self report from a key informant. Table  1 outlines the number of participants by profession and category of MDI/spacer adoption, as well as the numbers of interviews in each category. Our findings are organized into thematic categories based on the OMRU [15] elements thought to influence research use: the evidence-based innovation (MDI spacers), the potential adopter, and the practice environment. A list of representative quotations from each thematic category has been provided [see Additional file 2].
