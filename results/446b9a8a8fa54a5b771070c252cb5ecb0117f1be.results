From June 2007 to December 2008, 304 patients were screened at admission to our ED, and 86 were for its potential to predict response to antibiotic therapy in respiratory tract infections, [15] [16] [17] it has never been systematically correlated to virological investigations to assess its ability to discriminate between the bacterial and viral etiology of an exacerbation. We aimed to describe the role of viruses, including the recently identifi ed strains that, to our knowledge, have never been studied in this setting, as pathogens in COPD by documenting their presence during the acute phase of an exacerbation and their disappearance after recovery during a clinically stable phase in the same patients. We also aimed to explore the potential of biologic markers (C-reactive protein [CRP] and PCT) to distinguish between viral and nonviral infection in AECOPD.
