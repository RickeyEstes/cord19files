A flow chart of studies from search to inclusion is shown in Fig. 1 . Of the 74 potentially relevant abstracts retrieved, 5 papers were eventually included in this review. Two of the five included papers reported on different aspects of the same study (Hou et al., 2003 (Hou et al., , 2005 . The reason for the large number of studies being excluded was that many of them addressed either PTSD or IPV but not both IPV and PTSD. The five papers are summarized as follows. 3.1. Post-traumatic responses to domestic violence in Taiwan (Hou et al., 2003 (Hou et al., , 2005 Hou, Wang, and Chung assessed the post-traumatic responses of 109 Chinese women to domestic violence in a cross-sectional survey. The women were recruited from the Kaohsiung area of Taiwan and were included if they had suffered physical, psychological, and/or sexual abuse from their husband, ex-husband, or former or current intimate heterosexual partner within the last year. A 15item Post-Traumatic Response Scale (PTRS), a Chinese version translated from Horowitz et al.'s (1979) Impact of Event Scale (IES), was used to measure the subjective impact of marital violence on abused women within the past week. In their 2003 paper, Hou et al. reported that most (93.6%) of the participants had scores of 19 indicating a high level of post-traumatic response. They also found that the standardized mean score of the intrusion subscale of the PTRS was higher than that of the avoidance subscale. The significance of the high intrusion score was compared to an earlier study by Houskamp and Foy (1991) in which PTSD was predicted by high intrusion reaction. Based on this observation, Hou and colleagues concluded that the women in their study had a higher rate of developing PTSD. In their 2005 paper, Hou et al. reported that most (89%) of the women faced life-threatening situations in their abusive intimate relationships. Also, the more dangerous the life-threatening situations faced by the women, the greater their overall post-traumatic response scores, a finding similar to those reported in Western literature (Houskamp and Foy, 1991) . (Huang et al., 2006) In a study of 471 Chinese female prisoners randomly selected from the Hunan female prison in China, Huang, Zhang, Momartin, Cao and Zhao used structured psychiatric interviews and a clinician-administered PTSD scale (CAPS) (Blake et al., 1997) to arrive at a diagnosis of PTSD as specified by the DSM-IV. A history of IPV was reported by 24.6% of the participants and was found to be one of the most predictive factors for PTSD. Specifically, survivors of IPV in the younger age group were nearly five times more likely to develop lifetime PTSD while those in the older age group were twice as likely to develop lifetime PTSD. Despite their high exposure to traumatic events, which included IPV, the lifetime and current rates of PTSD for this Chinese sample of female prisoners, at 15.9% and 10.6% (Chandra et al., 2009; Leahy et al., 2004; Yoshihama and Horrocks, 2003; Yoshihama and Horrocks, 2005) . respectively, were much lower than those found in Western literature (Cauffman et al., 1998; Ruchkin et al., 2002) . Differences between the Chinese and Western study subjects were suggested as a possible reason for the discrepancy in the prevalence of PTSD, although the researchers did not elaborate on the differences. Interestingly, not only were the rates of PTSD lower than those in Western literature, they were also lower than those reported in colleagues' (2003, 2005) study of women in a community in Taiwan. What may have accounted for the apparent difference in PTSD scores between female prisoners in Mainland China and community-dwelling women in Taiwan? Could this be due to differences in coping strategies or personality hardiness that may have insulated the female prisoners from developing PTSD? As Huang et al.'s study did not elaborate on the participants' coping strategies or personality hardiness, it was not possible to draw a conclusion.
