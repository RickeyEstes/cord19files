At a MS level, the baseline model predicted the Netherlands and the United Kingdom to be the most likely points of introduction (Fig 2) . The Netherlands was the most likely legal trade destination, while the UK was the most likely destination for introduction via human travel, bushmeat and live animals; although the risk from live animals was much lower than for other routes. The baseline model results (Table 2) suggested that legal trade was the most likely route of introduction of NiV followed by bushmeat and human travel. The results from the scenario analyses show that the uncertainty and variability surrounding the model parameterisation, in particular the estimate for the prevalence in bats, can have considerable impact on the average number of years to an EU introduction of NiV, relative to the baseline model parameterisation (Table 2) . However, the relative ranking between routes was more robust; the only scenarios to have an impact on the relative ranking between the routes were those involving much lower estimates for the bat prevalence. For scenarios 1-6, the relative rankings of the MSs were fairly robust. The top three MSs for all routes were always the UK, the Netherlands and Germany (Table 3) . Between all 28 EU MSs, the largest variation in rank was 5 places, with Sweden falling from 5 th to 9 th in scenario 3e, when a much lower estimate of bat prevalence is used. As might be expected, there was greater variation in the ranking for scenarios 7-8, which involved changing the exporting countries and/or at risk trade products, with some MSs changing by as much as 15 places.
