To investigate our observations regarding AmphoB and IFITM3, we first evaluated the effect of AmphoB on IAV replication in IFITM-depleted cells. HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma cells were stably transduced with either of two short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting IFITM3 or two negative control shRNAs against firefly luciferase ( Figures 1A and 1B) . HeLa cells were chosen because they express relatively high levels of endogenous IFITM3 and differing endogenous levels of IFITM3 strongly correlate with AmphoB's effects on IAV replication (Feeley et al., 2011; Roethl et al., 2011) . The cell lines were then challenged with either of two strains of IAV, H1N1 A/WSN/33 (WSN/33) or H1N1 A/PR/38 (PR8), with or without AmphoB. The loss of IFITM3 in untreated cells increased the infection of both viruses, with the enhancement being greater for PR8 (25-fold) than for WSN/33 (5-fold). In the IFITM3-depleted cells treated with AmphoB, we saw no increased infection with WSN/33 and a modest additional increase in replication with PR8 (1.7-and 2.4-fold, respectively), suggesting that the majority of AmphoB's enhancement of IAV infection is due to overcoming IFITM3. The IFITMs act on the viral envelope protein-dependent stage of entry by blocking fusion. Therefore, we tested the effect of AmphoB on the infectivity of viral pseudoparticles that express the HA1, HA5, or HA7 proteins. Consistent with its overcoming IFITM3, AmphoB treatment enhanced the infectivity of all of the HA-expressing particles ( Figure 1C) . Notably, the infectivity of particles bearing PR8's HA1 was uniquely increased in the vector cells treated with AmphoB, suggesting that the residual infectivity seen when IAV PR8 is used with IFITM3-depleted cells ( Figure 1A ) is the result of an intrinsic property of the PR8 HA1 envelope. Interestingly, while IFITM3 did modestly inhibit VSV-g pseudoparticle infection, this block was not alleviated by AmphoB. We next tested A549 human lung carcinoma cells expressing high levels of exogenous IFITM3 and observed that AmphoB (1 mM) produced a marked reversal of IFITM3-mediated restriction at both 12 and 24 hr postinfection ( Figure 1D ; Figures S1A-S1D). Similar results were seen with influenza B virus (data not shown). Due to decreased toxicity, liposomal preparations of AmphoB (AmBisome) are used to treat patients with fungal infections. Therefore, we investigated if AmBisome also rescued IAV infection from IFITM3. This was the case, as AmBisome's effect on IFITM3-mediated restriction was indistinguishable from that of AmphoB at a clinically relevant concentration (2 mM; Figure 1E ). Notably, therapeutically administered maximal concentrations of AmphoB and AmBisome range from 1 to 3 mM (Bellmann, 2007) . Given IFITM3's role in the IFN response, we determined the effect of AmBisome on IFNa-induced restriction of IAV ( Figure 1F ). IFN-a inhibited IAV infection in both the vector and IFITM3 cells, with the addition of AmBisome rescuing >60% of IAV infectivity, consistent with the 60%-80% of the IFN response that is lost with IFITM3 depletion (Brass et al., 2009) . Thus, AmBisome removes the majority of IFN's protection from IAV in vitro. A basic amine in the mycosamine of AmphoB is critical for its antimycotic activity (Volmer and Carreira, 2010) . This amine is protonated at physiological pH and makes key interactions with the lipid bilayer. Consequently, we synthesized DS-AmpB-020, which incorporates additional cationic sites at the mycosamine ( Figure 1G ). Indeed, this compound displays 15-fold more antifungal activity (Paquet et al., 2008) . Treatment of A549-IFITM3 cells with DS-AmpB-020 resulted in the complete loss of IFITM3-mediated restriction and showed this compound to be more potent than AmphoB (4-fold lower IC 50 ; Figure 1H ). Together, these data suggest that the chemical moieties required for the antifungal properties of these compounds are also important for their alleviation of IFITM3's antiviral actions. IFITM3 blocks IAV fusion and prevents vRNPs from translocating to the nucleus (Feeley et al., 2011) . We examined the effect of AmphoB on IAV vRNP nuclear translocation (Figure 2A ). At the start of infection, the IAV nucleoprotein (NP) is associated with the vRNPs. By immunostaining for NP, we can follow vRNP distribution intracellularly. HeLa-vector or HeLa-IFITM3 cells were chilled on ice with IAV PR8. Next, the viral supernatant was (A) HeLa cells stably expressing either of two negative control short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against the firefly luciferase gene (shLuc-1 or shLuc-2) or shRNAs against IFITM3 (shIFITM3-1 and shIFITM3-2) were incubated for 1 hr in the presence (red) or absence (blue) of 1 mM AmphoB, then challenged with IAV WSN/33 (multiplicity of infection [moi] 0.2) or PR8 (moi 0.02) followed by immunostaining for HA.

Results are representative of three independent experiments. replaced with warm media (0 min). At the indicated times after warming, cells were evaluated for NP signal with a confocal microscope. vRNPs arrive in the nuclei by 90 min in the vector cells, with the NP signal increasing through to 120 min, and these events are inhibited by IFITM3 overexpression. Remarkably, when we treated the cell lines with AmphoB, both the vector and IFITM3 cells showed a strong increase in vRNP particles in their nuclei, although the vector cells were still more infected at 90 min. A time of addition experiment showed that AmphoB's effect was maximal when added 60 min prior to viral addition, consistent with inhibiting IFITM3 ( Figure S1E ). An immunoblot revealed that AmphoB treatment did not decrease IFITM3 levels ( Figure S1F ). Together with the pseudoparticle experiments, these data demonstrate that AmphoB's enhancement of IAV infection arises from it overcoming IFITM3's inhibition of viral fusion. To determine the specificity of AmphoB's actions, we compared its effect on A549 cells stably expressing IFITM1, IFITM2, or IFITM3. These experiments showed that while AmphoB effectively counteracts IFITM2 and IFITM3, its neutralization of IFITM1 was considerably less, with only a 1.4-fold increase in infection observed ( Figure 2B ). Next, chimeric IFITM proteins were constructed to find what regions of IFITM3 confer AmphoB sensitivity (John et al., 2013 ). IFITM3's N-terminal domain (NTD) was fused with the remaining portions of IFITM1 to generate M3M1, and the NTD of IFITM1 was fused to IFITM3 to produce M1M3 ( Figure 2C ). The M3M1 chimera was less affected by AmphoB treatment similar to wild-type (WT) IFITM1, and the M1M3 protein was rendered ineffective by AmphoB (Figure 2D ). The levels of the WT IFITM proteins in the cell lines used for these experiments were purposefully matched to the expression levels of the chimeras, resulting in less restriction than seen with higher-expressing cell lines ( Figure 2E ). These results reveal that AmphoB impacts IFITM2 and IFITM3 greater than IFITM1 and that this susceptibility resides in amino acids 51-133 of IFITM3. IFITM3's mechanism of restriction is not fully understood. Given that AmphoB reverses IFITM3's inhibition of viral replication, we set about using it as a molecular probe to investigate IFITM3's actions. IAV fusion requires endosomal acidification, and IFITM3 both blocks IAV fusion and increases intracellular acidity by expanding the late endosomal and lysosomal compartments (Feeley et al., 2011) . Therefore, IFITM3 might inhibit IAV by altering endosomal pH. To test this idea, HeLa-vector and HeLa-IFITM3 cells were stably transduced with a RAB7red fluorescent protein (RAB7-RFP) to identify their late endosomes and lysosomes. The cell lines were then incubated with a mixture of two dextrans, conjugated to either a pH-sensitive or pH-insensitive fluor, in the presence or absence of AmphoB. Calculating the ratio of these two signals allowed us to determine that IFITM3 increased the acidity in the RAB7 compartments ( Figure S2A ). In addition, AmphoB modestly decreased the relative acidity of both the vector and IFITM3 cell lines. We next evaluated the consequences of AmphoB's altering pH on acid-induced HA activation. At the indicated times after the initiation of a synchronized infection, we immunostained for the presence of HA that has undergone an acid-induced conformational change required for fusion ( Figure S2B ). These experi-ments showed more acid-induced HA signal in the IFITM3 cells, consistent with their higher acidity. However, we observed no appreciable change in the levels of acid-induced HA upon AmphoB treatment of either cell line. Along with the dextran and NP translocation studies, these results suggest that AmphoB did not prevent IFITM3-mediated restriction by decreasing endosomal acidity. These studies also showed that the levels and location of IFITM3 were not altered by AmphoB treatment with or without viral infection. AmphoB's pores permit the diffusion of ions across membranes (Bolard, 1986) . Endosomal membrane potential and ion concentration (Na + , K + , and Cl À ) play roles in both endocytosis and viral-host membrane fusion (Helenius et al., 1985; Scott and Gruenberg, 2011) . Therefore, we examined how IFITM3 and AmphoB influence endosomal Na + levels. Vector and IFITM3 cells were treated with AmphoB, nystatin (a related heptaen), or three Na + ionophores, then incubated with a cell-impermeable fluorescent indicator, Asante Na + green 2 (ANG-2). ANG-2 remains in the endocytic compartment permitting the visualization of Na + levels in vital endosomes. The HeLa-IFITM3 cells showed a higher ANG-2 signal than vector (normalized maximum ANG-2 intensity of IFITM3 cells = 1.28, vector = 1.0; p value = 2.2 3 10 À5 ; Figure 3A ), indicating that IFITM3 increases endosomal salinity as well as acidity. Addition of the indicated compounds after ANG-2 reduced the intensity of the Na + signal in both cell lines. However, the loss of IFITM3-mediated restriction was seen only with AmphoB or nystatin treatment and not with any of the ionophores ( Figure 3B ). Therefore, AmphoB's diminishment of endosomal Na + concentration alone is unlikely to explain its counteracting IFITM3-mediated restriction. Nystatin, a pore-forming heptaen like AmphoB, was the only other compound found to rescue IAV infection from IFITM3. In contrast, the ionophores do not form pores but instead transport Na + by encasing the ion and shuttling it across the bilayer (Figure 3C) . This difference suggests that egress of a combination of ions (Cybulska et al., 1995; Hartsel et al., 1994) , or the pore itself may alter the membrane's properties and underlie AmphoB's negation of IFITM3. To investigate this, we used two small molecules, tetraethylammonium (TEA) and acetylcholine (ACh), to block AmphoB pores (Brutyan and McPhie, 1996; Terazima and Yoshino, 2010;  Figure 3C ). We first determined conditions where TEA or ACh prevented the AmphoB-mediated efflux of Na + from endosomes ( Figure 3D ; quantitation provided in Figure S2C ). Importantly, we assume from these results that the diffusion of additional ions (i.e., K + and Cl À ) through the AmphoB pores is also blocked. In support of this, TEA also diminished the modest change in endosomal acidity observed with the addition of AmphoB (Figures S2A and S2D ). Next, using these conditions, we challenged the vector and IFITM3 cells with IAV and found that the blockade of AmphoB pores with either TEA or ACh had no effect on AmphoB's rescue of IAV replication ( Figure 3E ), arguing that alteration of endosomal ion concentration and pore conductance cannot account for either IFITM3mediated restriction or its negation by AmphoB. Because AmphoB binds cholesterol and overcomes IFITM3mediated restriction, we were intrigued by recent studies regarding the IFITMs and VAPA, cholesterol, and oleic acid; therefore, we tested the role of these factors in IFITM3-mediated Cell Reports 5, 895-908, November 27, 2013 ª2013 The Authors 899 However, lowering the levels of intracellular cholesterol in A549 cells using methyl-b-cyclodextrin (MbCD) or lovastatin resulted in no appreciable difference in restriction of IAV WSN/33 by IFITM1 or IFITM3, with or without AmphoB treatment ( Figure 4A ). The addition of cholesterol slightly decreased infection in the vector cells and halved AmphoB's alleviation of IFITM3-mediated restriction, although we cannot rule out that the latter result occurs because excess cholesterol prevents AmphoB from reaching an effective intracellular concentration. Notably, treatment of the A549 cell lines with oleic acid had no effect on either IFITM1-or IFITM3-mediated restriction of IAV WSN/33 (Figure 4B ). Overexpression of both VAPA and IFITM3 in A549 cells, or VAPA alone in HeLa cells, generated a modest alleviation of IFITM3-mediated restriction of either IAV PR8 or IAV WSN/33 infection ( Figures 4D-4F ). Neiman-Pick type c1 fibroblasts contain a mutation that results in high levels of cholesterol in late endosomal and lysosomal membranes, but this characteristic did not diminish IAV WSN/33 infection (Figures 4G and 4H; Amini-Bavil-Olyaee et al., 2013) . Last, three alanine scan (AS) mutant A549 proteins, each possessing six contiguous residues changed to alanine collectively spanning the IM2 region of IFITM3 that interacts with VAPA, had no loss in restriction compared to WT IFITM3, nor did their respective mutations result in any alterations in lysosomal cholesterol levels ( Figures  S3D-S3G ; John et al., 2013) . These data suggest that neither VAPA nor cholesterol nor the alleviation of a block to hemifusion by oleic acid plays a substantial role in either IFITM3-mediated restriction of IAV or its reversal by AmphoB. The IFITM proteins can associate to form homo-and heteromeric complexes via their IM1 domains, and this interaction is required for restriction of IAV (John et al., 2013) . This prompted us to hypothesize that the multimerization of IFITM proteins inhibits viral fusion by altering the fluidity of the cell membrane. To test this idea, we measured the membrane fluidity of cells stably expressing IFITM1 using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). We chose to use COS-7 cells stably transduced with IFITM1 due to their planar morphology and because IFITM1 is predominantly cell-surface expressed as compared to IFITM3, which resides in late endosomes and lysosomes that were not amenable to FRAP studies due to their small size and continued movements (data not shown; Figure 5A ; Figure S4A ). Caveolin 1 (CAV1) was chosen as a control because it has a similar intramembrane topology to the IFITMs (Hoop et al., 2012; Yount et al., 2012) . After incubating the cells along with a fluorescent membrane probe (DiO), we then photobleached an area of the cell surface (white squares, Figure 5B ). We monitored the return of the DiO signal as readout for membrane fluidity by capturing serial images of the bleached areas ( Figure 5C) . These experiments showed that IFITM1 decreased membrane fluidity compared to vector cells, signified by the slower recovery and a greater than 2-fold increase in the immobile fraction in the IFITM1 cells ( Figure 5D ). Consistent with previous reports, and in contrast to IFITM1, CAV1 expression increased membrane fluidity, demonstrating the specificity of IFITM1's actions (Cai et al., 2004) . To test for a functional effect, we emulated elegant studies that established that IAV and other fusogenic viruses can induce tissue culture cells to form syncytia when exposed to low pH (White et al., 1981 (White et al., , 1982 . We incubated the COS-7 cell lines (vector, IFITM1, and IFITM3) with concentrated IAV PR8 on ice, followed by the addition of warm buffer at either pH 5.0 or 7.5. After replacing the buffer with media, we stained the cells for actin and DNA followed by image analysis. Quantitation of syncytia, based on clustering of nuclei and the absence of intervening bands of actin ( Figure 5E ), showed there were less fusion events occurring among the IFITM1 cells (1.5% ± 0.4% fused cells) as compared to either the IFITM3 cells or the vector control cells (3.6% ± 0.6% fused cells, p < 0.05; Figures 5F and 5G) . We interpret the lack of effect by IFITM3 in this assay to be attributable to its location in the late endosomes and lysosomes. The levels of the exogenously expressed IFITM1 and IFITM3 proteins were seen to be comparable by immunoblotting ( Figure 5H ). AmphoB did not alter either IFITM1's effect on membrane fluidity or its antifusion actions ( Figures S4B and S4C ), although this was not altogether unexpected given AmphoB's weak effect on IFITM1-mediated restriction. Therefore, we conclude that IFITM1 decreases membrane fluidity along with increasing resistance to IAV-induced cell-to-cell fusion. Our data demonstrate that AmphoB increases IAV replication by overcoming IFITM3's protective effects in vitro. To determine the effects of AmphoB on IAV in vivo, we infected either WT or Ifitm3 knockout mice (Ifitm3 À/À ) with a low-pathogenicity strain of IAV (A/X-31 H3N2 [X-31]; (Everitt et al., 2012) . At the dose used, the X-31 strain produced a mild illness from which the WT mice made a full recovery ( Figures 6A and 6B ). In contrast, and consistent with our previous studies, the infected Ifitm3 À/À mice lost >25% of their body weight with signs of significant illness 6 days postinfection. Notably, WT littermates treated with AmBisome (3 mg/kg injected at days 0, 2, and 4 relative to viral inoculation) behaved identically to the Ifitm3 À/À mice, experiencing a clinical course usually observed with more pathogenic strains of IAV and manifest by severe symptoms in conjunction with a weight loss exceeding 25% of their starting values. We saw no signs of illness with AmBisome treatment alone in the absence of infection ( Figure S5 ). Evaluation of lung (C) Schematic diagram of AmphoB or nystatin transmembrane pores (left) permitting the passive diffusion of multiple monovalent cations (purple and red ovals) across the endosomal membrane (arrow indicates high to low concentration gradient). In comparison, the ionophores selectively bind Na + (red ovals) in a central region, effectively shielding the positive charge from the hydrophobic interior of the membrane and thus allowing the cation to be transported down the gradient. Adding TEA or ACh blocks the opening of the AmphoB pore, preventing ion transport (lower panel, gold oval).

Quantitation provided in Figure S2C . Scale bar, 10 mm. (legend continued on next page) pathology at day 6 postinfection showed marked edema, pneumonia, and hemorrhage with substantial inflammation in the AmBisome-treated infected mice (either WT or Ifitm3 À/À ) as compared to the WT mice not exposed to AmBisome ( Figure 6C ). Indeed, in the setting of infection, there is little difference seen when comparing the AmBisome-treated WT lungs to ones from an Ifitm3 À/À animal. Consistent with these results, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Ifitm3 À/À mice were more susceptible to infection than WT MEFs, and this difference was largely erased with AmphoB exposure (Figure 6D , E). Similar to above, the Ifitm3 À/À cells treated with AmphoB demonstrated a slightly increased infection with X-31, suggesting that Ifitm2 or an additional component is also being overcome by AmphoB. We conclude that a clinical formulation of AmphoB, AmBisome, produces the functional equivalent of an Ifitm3-null state, and by so doing converts a mild illness into a life-threatening infection.
