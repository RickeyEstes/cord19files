We analyzed 108,801 patient visits. Table 2 provides the descriptive characteristics of the study sample, as well as a summary of the median waiting time and LOS. The median waiting time and LOS for all patients was 34 min and 112 min, respectively. In general, patients over 65 years old, brought in by ambulance, and admitted, experienced shorter waiting time and LOS than their complementary counterparts. There was no significant variation between genders. Table 3 displays the contribution of patient demographics, clinical factors, crowding factors, and emergent patients on the waiting times of non-emergent patients. Patients who had lower acuity had higher waiting times, and patients who arrived by ambulance and were admitted had significantly lower waiting times, as most of those patients were triaged to Category I-III. The more important finding shown in this table is that emergent patients prolonged a non-emergent patient's waiting time by 14 Service Delay for Non-emergent ED Patients Table 4 presents the results of the multiple linear regression model estimating LOS. Longer LOS were found among elderly patients because they usually underwent further observation after testing and treatment. Patients brought in by ambulance and those admitted had a shorter LOS. This model also shows that emergent patients prolonged a non-emergency patient's LOS by 10.8% (95% CI 10.6-11.0). In other words, given that the median LOS for non-emergent patients was 118 min and the average number of emergent patients arriving during their visit was 1.4, this would increase the waiting time to 16.8 min. Overall, the volume of the earlier arrived patients in different phases of care prolonged a newly arrived patient's LOS except for the negative impact imposed by non-urgent patients in treatment (À0.6, 95% CI À0.9 to À0.2). The patient attributes were significantly associated with the LOS. For example, patients in higher categories stayed longer in the A&E, whereas those brought by ambulance and finally being admitted stayed shorter because most of them suffered from major conditions that require less waiting before the first consultation. Table 5 displays the results of the secondary aim of this study, to determine if emergent patients increase the probability of violating the 120-min waiting time target for semi-urgent patients. The logistic regression model shows that the presence of each additional emergent patient predicted a higher likelihood of violation of the mandate (OR 2.31, 95% CI 2.18-2.45). The subsequent ROC curve demonstrated good discriminative power of a 0.889 (95% CI 0.880-0.898) AUC value, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test provided no evidence of rejecting the model (p > 0.05).
