Demographic information is shown in Table 1 . The mean age was not different between SARS cases and contacts (p = 0.1781). Although females appeared more frequently in SARS cases than contacts, the male/female ratio was not statistically different between the two groups (p = 0.0869). Sixteen individuals out of 103 contacts were revealed to have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies. When we classified these individuals into an infected group together with SARS patients, age and gender showed no significant difference between the infected and non-infected groups (p = 0.2139; 0.2065). SARS cases were classified by the requirement for oxygen therapy. Age and gender did not differ between these subgroups either (p = 0.4198; 0.7411). We analyzed SNPs of IFN-inducible genes showing association with HCV infection as described above [20] [21] [22] , and compared their genotypes and allele frequencies between 44 SARS cases and 103 controls with contact history to SARS patients ( Table 2) . We observed a higher frequency of the G-allele positive genotypes (GA and GG) of non-synonymous SNP in exon 3 of OAS-1 gene in SARS patients (odds ratio 2.68; 95% CI; 1.17-6.15; p = 0.0178). Allele frequency of the G-allele in exon 3 was significantly higher in SARS patients (p = 0.0090). Allele frequency of the Gallele in exon 6 of OAS-1 was also found more frequently in SARS patients than in the controls that showed marginal significance (p = 0.0542). The genotype and allele frequencies of OAS-1 polymorphisms were compared among 60 SARS-CoV infected individuals and 87 uninfected individuals (Table 3 ). It was shown that frequencies of the G-alleles in exon 3 and exon 6 were significantly higher in infected individuals than in uninfected (p = 0.0156 and p = 0.0176, respectively). These two polymorphisms in the OAS-1 gene were in strong linkage disequilibrium (jD 0 j = 0.931, r 2 = 0.530). Genotype and allele frequencies in 50 controls with no contact history with SARS patients are also shown in Table 3 . In controls of subjects having no contact history, allele frequencies of G-allele in exons 3 and 6 were lower than those of the infected group, but higher than those of the uninfected group. The SNPs in MxA gene and PKR gene were not associated with the development of SARS (Table 2) . However, on comparison of the MxA genotype between hypoxemic SARS patients requiring oxygen therapy and non-hypoxemic SARS patients who did not, GG genotype was found more frequently in patients of the former category (odds ratio 3.75; 95% CI 1.08-10.7; p = 0.0346). It was also shown that the G-allele was more frequent in the former group (p = 0.0195) ( Table 4 ). The other SNPs did not show any significant p values between these two groups (data not shown).
