In a separate experiment, TFT levels and HSV titers were measured using a small portion of the liver, leaving approximately 1 g intact from 4 mice/group to measure 19F levels by NMR spectroscopy, under conditions as described in the methods. The results are shown in Table 3 , compared with the HSV pfu/g liver where applicable and the TIT levels as measured by HPLC. By linear regression, the correlation between HPLC and NMR was I = 0.91, P < 0.0005. Fig. 3 shows actual 19F NMR tracings of (A) the 40 pg/ml standard, (B) liver homogenate from an HSV-2 infected mouse 3.5 h after i.v. injection of 100 mgikg TFT; the area under the peak corresponds to 11 Fg/g liver, (C) liver homogenate from a CC& treated mouse and (D) liver homogenate from an uninfected mouse 3.5 h after i.v. injection of 100 mg/kg TFT. As a further specificity control, 10 CBA mice were infected with murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59), a coronavirus which does not contain thymidine kinase. As shown in Fig. 4 , there was no increased concentration of TFT in livers of 10 MHV infected mice 2 h after i.v. injection of TFT, compared with the levels found in uninfected mice in the same experiment. In contrast, the 2 HSV-2 infected mice with titers of lo6 pfu HSV/g liver, had strikingly elevated levels.
