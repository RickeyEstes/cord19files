No significant differences were present between groups for BW (P = 0.68), dehydration assessment scores (P = 0.87), or serum analytes (all P > 0.7 except for HCO 3 , which was P = 0.44) before initiation of the dehydration protocol. The administration of sucrose and the 2 diuretic agents resulted in profuse, watery diarrhea, with subsequent moderate dehydration. Per protocol, this was achieved in almost all cases without evidence of profound depression, recumbency, or loss of a suckle reflex. Calves experienced an average BW loss of approximately 7.9% following the induction protocol (range of 3% gain to 13.9% loss). Mean BW before induction (i.e., at initial assessment) was 40.0 kg (range 27.6-61.3) versus 36.7 kg (range 27.5-53) at treatment enrollment (after induction but before initiation of treatment). This decrease in BW was statistically significant (P < 0.0005). Serum total protein and PCV values were increased at enrollment compared with initial assessment, also consistent with dehydration. Mean total protein at initial assessment was 5.64 g/dL (range 4.6-7.2) compared with 6.18 after dehydration, at time of enrollment for treatment (range 5-7.4; P < 0.0005). Mean PCV was 35% (range 20-48) and increased to 38.4% (range 23-48; P < 0.0005) at enrollment. Mean calculated base excess at initial assessment was 7.5 mEq/L (range −5 to 21); and at enrollment decreased to 5.7 [range −5 to 12; P = 0.017 for all calves; no significant difference from initial to enrollment for the LRS group (P = 0.288)]. Mean bicarbonate concentration at initial assessment was 32.06 mEq/L (range 21-44.4) and at treatment enrollment decreased to 30.38 [range 21.7-36.3; P = 0.001 for all calves; no significant difference between initial assessment and time of enrollment for the LRS group (P = 0.18)]. In contrast, Na + and K + values were not significantly different after dehydration but before treatment, compared with initial evaluation (138 vs. 137 mEq/L, P = 0.43; and 5.0 vs. 4.9 mEq/L, P = 0.134). A significant increase was observed in BW from time of treatment enrollment to completion of the trial (1 d after completion of treatment) for both treatment groups. Mean weight of the supplement group at treatment enrollment was 36.9 kg (range 27.9-53.1) compared with a mean weight at trial completion of 39.2 (range 27.2-60.6; P < 0.0005). The mean weight of the LRS group at enrollment was 36.6 kg (range 27.5-52.8) and at completion was 38.8 kg (range 28.5-60.6; P < 0.0005). No difference was observed between the 2 treatment groups in final BW or change in BW from induction to completion (P = 0.55). Similarly, total protein values, PCV, base excess, and bicarbonate all showed significant changes toward baseline from treatment enrollment to completion of the trial test period (see Table 2 ). No significant difference was observed in these values between the 2 treatment groups. No significant difference was observed in Na + or K + , either between induction and final, or between the 2 treatment protocols. Major findings are summarized in Table 2 .
