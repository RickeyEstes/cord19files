The ECMO program was initiated in 2011, and the transport of ECMO patients began in the same year. (14) A flowchart of the 28 requests for extracorporeal support outside the referral hospitals is shown in figure 1S . The first seven patients in this series were described in another publication. (15) During the six years of the program, 18 patients in the state of São Paulo were rescued and transported with ECMO support by our team. Seventeen patients received exclusive respiratory support (venovenous -VV configuration), and one patient received respiratory and cardiovascular support (veno-arterial -VA configuration). A profile of the patients is shown in table 1. The characteristics of the patients shortly before initiation of the support are shown in table 2. The Respiratory ECMO Survival Prediction Score (RESP score) and the tidal volume in pre-ECMO mechanical ventilation differed significantly in survivors and nonsurvivors. The data on the rescue missions and complications during transport are shown in table 3. The referral hospitals were Hospital Sírio Libanês (two patients), Hospital TotalCor (two patients), and the Hospital das Clínicas of São Paulo (14 patients). The data on the extracorporeal support are shown in table 4. Respiratory support was provided using the femoral-jugular configuration, and veno-arterial support (one case) was provided using the femoral-femoral configuration. The venous cannulae were 21 -22 Fr, and the arterial cannulae were 16 -19 Fr. Apart from venoarterial cannulation, anticoagulation was started upon patient arrival at the referral hospital. Five patients did not use anticoagulation at any time because of pulmonary hemorrhage (four cases) or the presence of cerebral vasculitis with hemorrhagic areas (one case). None of the evaluated patients had a change of itinerary or a change in the support configuration related to initial cannulation. The final results are shown in table 5. The minimum and maximum duration of support was 3 and 60 days, respectively. Of the 18 patients, 13 (72%, 95%CI 49 -88) survived to hospital admission ( Figure 2S ). Of the survivors, only one patient needed dialysis after hospital admission, and none required home oxygen therapy. The individual patient data are presented in table 1S.
