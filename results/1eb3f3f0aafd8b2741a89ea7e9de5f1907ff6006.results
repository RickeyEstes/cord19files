As a direct comparison was not justified, 11 the seven graphs in Fig. 5 compare the same spread process over time and the same time based on different models. In Fig. 5 , the red dashed lines, (for interpretation of the reference to colour in this legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article) indicate the significance threshold (PZ0.05). The x-axis is the temporal for SARS, and the y-axis is the negative z value of the join-count statistic. Model 7 is an exception as its y-axis is the positive z value. The greater the degree of spatial autocorrelation (contagion), the larger (negative) the z score for BW joins. Comparison of temporal variety suggests that besides the population-amount model (M-3) and urban-rural model (M-7), the whole trends of spatial autocorrelation of the new cases (blue line, (For interpretation of the reference to colour in this legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article)) are declining with the epidemic. Fig. 5 also shows that in different SARS processes, the dominated diffusion model is also changed.
