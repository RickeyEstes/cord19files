Sera were tested for IgG antibodies reactive with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and human coronavirus OC43 S1 antigens in a protein microarray (fi gure 1). Human coronavirus OC43 is serologically closely related to bovine coronavirus, 26 diverging at the end of the 19th century. 10 Bovine coronavirus circulates in cows, sheep, goats, and Old and New World camelids. [27] [28] [29] [30] Because bovine coronavirus S1 was not available, human coronavirus OC43 S1 antigen was used as a proxy. Sera from three llamas, four alpacas, one guanaco, and two Bactrian camels reacted with human coronavirus OC43 antigen. One cow and one goat serum reacted with human coronavirus OC43 antigen as did sera from 16 of 105 (15%) Spanish dromedary camels. All sera from cattle, sheep, and goats tested negative for MERS-CoV antigen, but sera from 15 Spanish camels (14%) did react with MERS-CoV antigen (fi gure 1). The reactivity was highly specifi c-the same sera did not bind to SARS-CoV antigen but a positive control specimen did. No correlation existed between the reactivity of sera with MERS-CoV antigen and human coronavirus OC43 antigen (fi gure 2). All but one serum sample that reacted with MERS-CoV antigen were from adult animals. One reactive serum was from a 2-year-old animal. To confi rm the presence of MERS-CoV specifi c IgG in the Spanish camel sera, we used a MERS-CoV neutralisation assay to test a subset of 49 camel sera with diff erent degrees of reactivity with MERS-CoV and human coronavirus OC43 antigen according to microarray. Nine Spanish camels had MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies with titres varying between 1/20 and 1/320 (table 1). Three of the 12 sera reacted with MERS-CoV spike antigen but did not neutralise MERS-CoV, most likely because of recognition of nonneutralising epitopes. All MERS-CoV neutralising sera had (almost) saturating reactivity with MERS-CoV antigen on the microarray, whereas reactivity with human coronavirus OC43 antigen varied from negative to 50% of saturating reactivity (table 1). The variable human coronavirus OC43 signals suggest that MERS-CoV did not generally cross-react with human coronavirus OC43 or bovine coronavirus antigens. All nine camels with MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies were born and raised on the Canary Islands; seven were female, two were male. Eight camels were adults, one was 2 years old. To show that the reactivity of the camel sera with human coronavirus OC43 antigen according to the microarray was caused by the presence of bovine coronavirus IgG and to further exclude MERS-CoV neutralising activity caused by cross-neutralisation by the bovine coronavirus antibodies, we tested camels that had suffi cient serum left (n=15) in a comparative MERS-CoV and bovine coronavirus plaque reduction neutralisation test (fi gure 2, table 2). All camel sera neutralised bovine coronavirus, but with varying titres, suggesting a lower cutoff than 20 000 RFU for OC43 in the microarray (fi gure 1). Five camels had high neutralising antibody titres against bovine coronavirus (and a mean signal intensity of greater than 50 000 RFU for human coronavirus OC43 antigen on microarray) but were negative for MERS-CoV neutralisation, suggesting that cross-neutralisation in this direction did not occur and that the MERS-CoV neutralising activity was not caused by the presence of bovine coronavirus neutralising antibodies. A serum sample from a patient who had MERS, neutralised MERS-CoV with a high titre (1/640) but neutralised bovine coronavirus less effi ciently (titre 1/80). The latter fi nding was most probably caused by previous infection with human coronavirus OC43-this patient had a high titre (1/>5120) in a human coronavirus OC43 recombinant spike immuno fl uorescence assay and a saturating signal with human coronavirus OC43 antigen in the microarray. Two human serum samples positive for human coronavirus OC43 did not neutralise MERS-CoV, one of which neutralised bovine coronavirus at a titre of 1/80 (table 2) . We tested 50 sera from dromedary camels in Oman at a dilution of 1/20 by microarray and MERS-CoV neutralisation test. All the sera showed saturating reactivity with MERS-CoV antigen on the microarray, no SARS-CoV antigen reactivity, and human coronavirus OC43 antigen reactivity varying between negative (below the cutoff of 20 000 RFU) and saturating signals (fi gure 1, table 1). Serial dilution of two sera with saturating reactivity for both antigens at the initial dilution of 1/20 showed that MERS-CoV antigen reactivity was still above the cutoff at 1/5120, whereas human coronavirus OC43 antigen reactivity fell below the cutoff at dilutions of 1/80 to 1/320 (fi gure 2D). Consistent with the microarray data, all sera had high MERS-CoV neutralising capacity, with titres varying between 1/320 (seven of 50 samples) and 1/2560 or more (16 or 50 samples).
