The initial investigation focused on individuals one would consider to be close contacts, i.e., those sharing living quarters, individuals working in close proximity with the patient, and friends with whom the patient spent time in social settings. The local newspaper ran several stories about the death at the resort, which generated substantial interest in being tested among resort employees who had little or no contact with the patient. The county elected to test all individuals who requested the test; however, for purposes of the contact investigation, data were segregated into categories of "close" and "not close." The index case was a 60-year-old black Hispanic man born in Central America. His date of entry into the United States and immigration status is unknown. In May 1998, he started work at the hotel as a dishwasher. His residence was on the grounds of the resort. The building contained 4 single-room units, each approximately 10 feet ϫ 10 feet and containing a sink. There was a common hall and shared bathroom for the residents. The patient's medical history was incomplete. There was no known history of TB. A few weeks before his death he had been seen by a local physician and treated for an upper respiratory infection. Symptomatology indicative of TB could not reliably be documented; however, his associates reported a history of frequent coughing. The autopsy identified 1 ⁄2 -inch cavitary necrotic lesions in the upper lobe of each lung containing purulent yellowish-green material. Multiple well-circumscribed, soft, yellowish-white nodules were present ranging in diameter up to 1 ⁄2 inch, and the tracheobronchial and arterial tree was unremarkable. Microscopically, the sections taken from each lung showed extensive caseating granulomatous inflammation, and scattered acid-fast bacilli were identified. A direct acid-fast bacilli smear was graded 4ϩ and identified as Mycobacterium tb complex. All food service activities took place in 1 large, poorly ventilated area; food was cooked, wait staff picked up plates to be served, bus staff returned soiled plates, and dishes were washed and stacked. The dishwashing station was at the end of the room where a large floor standing fan was positioned to ventilate the area by pushing air back into the center of the room. The patient worked long hours, often worked overtime, and had worked at his dishwashing job the day before he died. The contact investigation included 264 individuals, 171 of whom were determined to be close contacts, and the remaining 93 were determined not to be close contacts. Given the attention raised by the local media around the case, the County Health Department agreed to test the not-close contacts, but their primary attention was focused on those contacts determined to be close. Close and notclose contacts differed remarkably by place of birth: 71% of the close contacts were born outside of the United States compared with 18% of the not-close contacts. Not-close contacts were also notably younger than close contacts. The large number of close contacts included food service staff from sev-eral shifts and friends working at the resort. Firstround testing of close contacts looked at 171 individuals, 24 (14%) of whom were known by the local health department to be TB skin test (TST)-positive. They were not tested but were interviewed for signs and symptoms and told to return if indications of TB developed. Of the 147 close contacts not known to be positive, 129 (88%) were tested in the first round. Positive PPD (purified protein derivative of Mycobacterium tb) results (Ն 5mm) were seen in 46 (36%) of those tested (of the 46, 38 were foreign-born), 79 (61%) were negative, and 4 failed to return for the reading. Second-round testing included 52 of the 79 first-round negative individuals. Positive reactions were identified in 8 (15%), bringing the total number of TST-positive individuals to 54 (32%) those identified as close contacts (Figure 1 ). Among the notclose contacts, 89 were tested; 8 (9%) were positive, and 81 (91%) were TST-negative on first-round testing. Only 2 of those people presented for secondround testing, and 1 of these tested positively.
