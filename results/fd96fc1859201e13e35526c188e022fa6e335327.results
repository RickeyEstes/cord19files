Of the 106 confirmed COVID-19 cases with a clear travel or contact history, the median age was 41 years (range, 19 to 73), and 70 (66.0%) were known to be male ( Table 1 ). The majority (82.1%) had an exposure period of 1-2 days, and 67.9% had a short travel history to Wuhan city. We estimated the mean incubation period to be 4.9 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4 to 5.4) days, ranging from 0.8 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile) (Fig. 1 ). Among the 50 clusters infected with SARS-CoV-2, the median age of the first-generation cases was 47 years (range, 21 to 73), and 58.0% were male, and 82.0% had a travel history to Wuhan ( Table 2 ). The median age of the 74 secondary cases was 45 years (range 7-83), and 45.9% were male. As the timelines shown in Figure 2 , most of the secondary cases (89.2%) had symptom onset after their first-generation cases, while four secondary cases (5.4%; in cluster 5, 21, 29, and 46) had symptom onset before their first-generation ones, and four pairs of first-generation and .

The observed mean and standard deviation (SD) of serial interval was 4.1Â±3.3 days, with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles at -1 and 13 days (Fig .2) . After the symptom onset dates of the first-generation cases were centralized, the peak of the infectious curve of the secondary cases was shown locating before the symptom onset dates of the first-generation cases (Fig. 3A) . The majority of the secondary cases (73.0%) were infected before the symptom onset of the first-generation cases, while 18.9% and 8.1% were infected on and after the date of the symptom onset of the first-generation cases, respectively (Fig. 3B) . Particularly, 66.2% of the secondary cases were infected within three days before the symptom onset dates of the first-generation cases.
