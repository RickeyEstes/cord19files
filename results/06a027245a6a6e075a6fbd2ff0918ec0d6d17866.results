Invitations to participate were sent to families of 3763 patients from 2 pediatric clinics; 367 families were not solicited, as screening disclosed an underlying medical condition. From February 2012 to March 2015, 236 subjects were enrolled. A subgroup of 119 children has completed the 1-year study; 58 subjects withdrew, and 59 children are still being followed. All 236 subjects are the cohort in whom the characteristics of URIs are described. The subgroup of 119 children who completed the study was used to calculate the frequency of URIs per subject per year. The demographic characteristics of enrolled subjects are shown in Table I .
