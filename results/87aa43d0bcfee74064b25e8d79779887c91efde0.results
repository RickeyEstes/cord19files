Probes from the 5' end of the genome of CB4, reacted strongly (signal +++) with RNA from CB-3 and -4 virus, and gave good signals (+ +) with RNA from CB2, -6 and echovirus-1. On the other hand, a probe from the 3' end of the genome of CB4 gave a good signal (+ +) only when hybridized with RNA from CB-1 and -2 viruses. Generally, CB4 probes did not react well with the genomes of coxsackie A viruses, echoviruses or polioviruses. In contrast to the findings obtained with cDNA probes, the synthetic oligonucleotides probes detected RNA from all the enteroviruses efficiently. Although, our initial experiments showed that the intensity of signals may vary, these clearly depended only on the amount of RNA contained in the samples (data not presented). It can be seen from Fig. 1 that the ratio of the intensity of the signal to the amount of RNA was constant for representative enteroviruses. None of the control viruses such as coronavirus-229E, influenza A and B viruses, reovirus-1 and -3, parainfluenza virus-3 or herpes simplex virus gave a positive signal with these probes (data not presented). These results were repeated several times and shown to be reproducible.
