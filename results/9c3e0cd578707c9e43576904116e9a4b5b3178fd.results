We recruited patients in two seasons: between Jan 15, 2015, and April 30, 2015, and between Oct 1, 2015, and April 30, 2016. We assessed 868 patients for eligibility, and stopped the trial when 720 patients had been recruited (figure 1). 362 patients were randomly assigned to receive POCT and 358 were randomly assigned to receive routine clinical care (control). One patient assigned to POCT declined to be swabbed and so did not receive the intervention. One patient in the POCT group and four in the control group were withdrawn due to protocol violations (figure 1). 360 patients in the POCT group and 354 patients in the routine clinical care group were analysed in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (figure 1). Baseline demo graphics and clinical characteristics seemed similar between groups (table 1) . All patients in the POCT group were tested for respiratory viruses compared with 158 (45%) of 354 patients in the control group (table 2) . More patients in the POCT group had a respiratory virus detected than in the control group (table 2). The mean turnaround time (time from the decision to test a patient to the result being available to clinicians) for respiratory virus testing was substantially lower in the POCT groups (table 2). The positive and negative agreement between the POCT results and laboratory PCR (for patients in the POCT group in whom both were done) are given in the appendix (p 2). For the primary outcome, 301 (84%) of 360 patients in the POCT group received antibiotics during their admission compared with 294 (83%) of 354 patients in the control group (difference 0·6% in favour of the control group, 95% CI -4·9 to 6·0; p=0·84; table 3). Multiple logistic regression analysis on the primary outcome altered the direction of the difference but did not change the broader interpretation (table 3; appendix p 3 for full results from the multiple logistic regression model). Mean duration of antibiotics did not differ between groups (difference −0·4, −1·2 to 0·4; p=0·32; table 3), and multiple negative binomial regression analysis did not signifi cantly alter the interpretation of the results ( (table 3) . Similarly, a greater proportion of patients in the POCT group received a brief course (<48 h) of antibiotics than in the control group (table 3) . The pro portion of patients treated with intravenous antibiotics and their duration did not differ between the groups (table 3) . Owing to hospital processes of care, many recruited patients had antibiotics prescribed very early in the course of their assessment and often before they could be randomly allocated or before the POCT results were available to the clinical teams for the POCT group. We therefore did a posthoc analysis on patients in whom antibiotics had not been prescribed before randomisation and before POCT results were available to the clinical teams. In this subgroup, antibiotics were prescribed in 61 (51%) of 120 patients in the POCT group compared with 107 (64%) of 167 in the control group (difference −13·2%, 95% CI −24·8 to −1·7; p=0·0289; number needed to test to prevent one patient being treated with antibiotics is eight; appendix p 5). Most patients presenting to secondary care were hospitalised in both groups (table 4). Mean hospital length of stay was shorter in the POCT group than in the control group (table 4). The proportion of patients with a prolonged inpatient stay (≥7 days) did not differ between groups. Post-hoc analysis of antibiotic duration and hospital length of stay in the intervention group by POCT result showed that patients with positive results received shorter courses of anti biotics ( In the exacerbation of asthma and COPD subgroups, mean duration of antibiotics was lower for patients in the POCT group than in the control group. Non-significant differences were observed in the other subgroups (appendix pp 7-8). For patients with asthma treated with antibiotics, a greater proportion of patients in the POCT group than in the control group received only a single dose of antibiotics (table 5) . For patients with infective exacerbation of COPD treated with antibiotics, a greater proportion of patients in the POCT group than in the control group received less than 48 h of antibiotics (for distributions of antibiotic duration for asthma and COPD subgroups, see appendix pp [10] [11] . For patients with infective exacerbation of COPD, the mean length of hospital stay was lower in the POCT group than in the control group; mean length of hospital stay did not differ within other subgroups (table 5, appendix pp 7-8). No difference was observed in the number of patients treated with neuraminidase inhibitors (table 6). A greater proportion of patients treated with neuraminidase in hibitors in the POCT group had confirmed influenza infection than in the control group (table 6 ). In addition, patients treated empirically with neuraminidase inhibitors who then tested negative for influenza received shorter courses of neuraminidase inhibitors in the POCT group compared with the control group (table 6). UK Public Health England guidelines 21 recommend neuraminidase inhibitor treatment for all hospitalised adults with influenza. A greater proportion of hospitalised patients with confirmed influenza in the POCT group were treated with neuraminidase inhibitors than in the control group (table 6). The mean time to starting neuraminidase inhibitor treatment in these patients did not differ between groups (table 6) . Data on isolation facility use were only available for the second year of recruitment (winter of 2015-16) owing to the introduction of a new hospital information system that allowed hospital side room use to be accurately tracked in real time (to the nearest whole day). Overall isolation facility use did not differ between the groups (table 6) . However, a greater proportion of patients in the POCT group were isolated for confirmed respiratory virus infection compared with the control group (table 6). The proportion of influenza-positive patients admitted to hospital and staying for at least 6 h who were isolated did not differ significantly between groups (table 6). Mean time to isolation for influenza-positive patients not empirically isolated at presentation was significantly shorter in the POCT group than in the control group, as was mean time to de-isolation for patents initially isolated with suspected influenza but sub sequently testing negative (table 6) . We found no differences between the groups in overall rates of adverse outcomes, or in individual rates of high dependency or intensive care unit admissions during hospitalisation, re-presentation, or readmission to hospital within 30 days of discharge, or 30-day mortality (table 7) .
