CIVs identified in canines in Guangxi, China. From 2013 to 2015, 800 nasal swabs were collected from canines presenting primarily with respiratory symptoms at veterinary clinics in 11 of the 14 prefectures in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi) (Fig. 1B) . Of the 800 samples, 116 (14.5%) tested positive for influenza virus by PCR (Table 1 ). The influenza virus-positive animals were primarily pets (115/116) (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Most were pure breeds, including Alaskan malamute (n ϭ 16), bichon frise (n ϭ 3), border collie (n ϭ 3), chihuahua (n ϭ 3), German shepherd (n ϭ 7), golden retriever (n ϭ 9), Siberian husky (n ϭ 6), and poodle (n ϭ 20). The majority of influenza virus-positive animals (~67%) were young dogs less than 1 year of age (median age of 5.5 months; range, 34 days to 9 years of age). The Table 1 . The three prefectures shown in black were not sampled. The proportion of samples that were positive for IAV by PCR for each sampled prefecture is listed in Table 1 . (C) The 10 Guangxi prefectures for which spatial-temporal information was available for both influenza viruspositive and -negative samples. Each circle represents a single respiratory sample obtained from a dog for this study. Samples that tested negative for influenza virus by PCR are shaded by location (prefecture) as shown in Fig. 1B . Samples that tested positive for influenza virus in all locations are shown in red. Emergence of Novel IAVs in Canines ® age profile of the influenza virus-positive animals did not differ significantly from influenza virus-negative animals (median age of 4 months; range, 2 days to 15 years). Twelve influenza virus-positive animals were rural Chinese dogs, including a 3-year-old female that died during treatment. It is unclear whether the death was caused by influenza. Approximately 70% (81/116) of the canines that tested positive presented with respiratory symptoms. Other animals presented with diarrhea, fever, vomiting, or injuries. Seven of the influenza virus-positive dogs were otherwise healthy. The first influenza virus-positive samples were identified in Liuzhou prefecture in April 2013 ( Fig. 1C and Table S1 ). The first successfully isolated virus was collected from a 2-month-old female Samoyed presenting with respiratory symptoms in the Wuzhou district in October 2013 (Table 2) . Influenza virus-positive samples were identified in 9 of the 11 sampled prefectures and in each of the 3 years of sampling (2013 to 2015). Sampling was not conducted evenly across prefectures or across time ( Fig. 1C and Table S2 ), so the percentage of positive samples in a location (Table 1 ) is likely to be biased and not appropriate for quantitative spatial-temporal comparisons. Sampling was conducted in multiple veterinary clinics in two prefectures (Nanning and Liuzhou), which explains the larger number of samples available from these locations (Fig. 1C ). Sixteen viruses (2.0%) from seven prefectures spanning multiple regions of Guangxi were successfully isolated, and the whole genomes of the viruses were sequenced ( Fig. 1B and Table 2 , the genetic lineage of each of the eight segments of the viral genome is indicated by the color of the circle: black E for EAswH1, gray P for PDMswH1, pink T for TRswH3, and yellow C for CIV-H3N2. The surface antigens HA and NA are listed first, followed by the six internal gene segments. Viruses with genotypes similar to those observed in swine [CIV-H1N1(sw1) and CIV-H1N1(sw2)] are listed first (indicated with colored triangles), followed by the three viruses with genotypes that include segments from swine-origin viruses and CIV-H3N2 viruses (indicated with colored ovals). (B) The color of each solid triangle or oval corresponds to the colors used in panel A and indicates the CIV genotype that was identified in the seven Guangxi prefectures from which CIVs were successfully isolated and whole genome sequenced for this study. The two swine-origin genotypes identified in October-November 2013 are presented in the left map, and the five genotypes identified in August 2014 to August 2015 are presented in the right map. Table 2) . A 10th virus [A/canine/Guangxi/PX11/2014(HxN1)] had seven segments, similar to CIV-H1N1(sw1), and clustered phylogenetically with a swine virus with a CIV-H1N1(sw1)-like genotype (Fig. S2 ), but the hemagglutinin (HA) was not sequenced. CIV-H1N1(sw1) viruses (EE-PPPPPT) have HA and neuraminidase (NA) segments from the EAswH1 lineage, a nonstructural (NS) segment from the TRswH3 lineage, and the remaining five internal gene segments from the PDMswH1 lineage ( Fig. 2A) . Three viruses were identified with the CIV-H1N1(sw2) genotype (EE-PPPPET), which is similar to CIV-H1N1(sw1), except the matrix protein (MP) segment is derived from the EAswH1 lineage. The CIV-H1N1r genotype (EE-PPPPPC) is similar to CIV-H1N1(sw1), except the NS segment was acquired from the CIV-H3N2 lineage. The CIV-H3N2r genotype (CC-PPPPC) is similar to CIV-H1N1r, but this virus also acquired HA and NA segments from CIV-H3N2 viruses. The CIV-H1N2r genotype (EC-CCCCCC) has seven segments from CIV-H3N2 viruses, and an HA from the EAswH1 lineage.
