. . Patient Characteristics. In the present study, a total of 34 patients with LAPC were retrospectively included in this study. All patients have received IRE therapy. There were 18 (52.9%) female patients and 16 (47.1%) male patients. The median age was 59.5 years (range 45-73 years). Patient characteristics were summarized in Table 1 . Large size and moderate differentiation were the most commonly seen features of tumors. Most patients had lower values of inflammatory indexes, such as PLR, PI, and mGPS, while patients with higher values of NLR occupied the majority of all patients. For the whole study cohort, there were only 4 patients whose TBIL was higher than 100 umol/L. Complications after IRE treatment in patients with LAPC were also evaluated ( Table 2 ). The most frequently reported complications were pain (3 of 34 patients) and hypotension (3 of 34 patients). . . Modulation of Circulating Immune Cells. To investigate how IRE influences circulating immune cells, these cells were phenotypically characterized by evaluating the absolute number of helper T cell (CD4 + T cell, identified as CD3 + CD4 + ), cytotoxic T cell (CD8 + T cell, identified as CD3 + CD8 + ), regulatory T cell (Treg, identified as CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + ), and natural killer cell (NK cell, identified as CD3 âˆ’ CD16 + CD56 + ) before (preOP) and after IRE treatment (D3 and D7). It was shown that the absolute numbers of CD4 + T cell (p<0.05), CD8 + T cell (p<0.05), and NK cell (p<0.01) were decreased immediately after IRE (D3), followed by a steady increase in the next few days (D7) (p<0.001). However, the trend for Treg cell reversed between preOP and D7 (p<0.05). The NK cell showed the most dramatic inverse effect for each time interval. Huge alterations of CD4 + T cell and CD8 + T cell were observed while there was a significant decrease in the ratio of CD4 + T cell to CD8 + T cell from D3 to D7 (p<0.05) ( Figure 1 ).
