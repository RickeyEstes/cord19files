We are interested in identifying which modelling techniques and datasets are used in global disease spread models, including how many records have used particular methods. As we are not conducting a critical appraisal of each record we have not included a discussion of each individual record, however we refer to examples throughout our analysis. For some records we had difficulty in extracting information. For example, a record may refer to a dataset within the main article text, however fail to provide a citation for the data source. We have labelled these records as 'unclear'.
