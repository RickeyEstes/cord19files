A previous attempt to predict drugs for the M pro of SARS-CoV has identified two HIV-1 protease inhibitors, namely lopinavir and ritonavir, as potential candidates, both of which bind to the same target site of M pro . Clinical application of these two drugs on 2019-nCoV patients also appears to be effective, whereas the nearby non-conserved amino acids locate far away from the binding pocket, thus would not affect its structural conservation (Figure 1b) . Virtual docking of lopinavir/ritonavir to 2019-nCoV M pro also showed high binding ability to the pocket site (Figure 1c) , similar to previous report for SARS-CoV M pro . Amino acids Thr24, Thr26, and Asn119 were predicted to be the key residues for binding the drugs (Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure 1) , forming 2 hydrogen bonds with lopinavir and 2 hydrogen bonds with ritonavir, respectively. author/funder.

Basing on these results, we performed virtual docking to screen for commercial medicines in the DrugBank database that could bind to the above mentioned pocket site of 2019-nCoV M pro , and identified 10 candidate clinical medicines (Table 1, Figure 1d and Supplementary Figure 2) . These drugs could form hydrogen bonds with one or more residues among Thr24-Asn28 and Asn119, theoretically, are capable to bind to author/funder. All rights reserved.

In summary, basing on the structural information of clinical effective medicines for 2019-nCoV, we have predicted a list of commercial medicines which may function as inhibitors for 2019-nCoV by targeting its main protease M pro . Compared to lopinavir/ritonavir, most of these predicted drugs could form more hydrogen bounds with 2019-nCoV M pro , thus may have higher mutation tolerance than lopinavir/ritonavir. The binding pockets of these drugs on M pro are conserved between SARS-CoV M pro and 2019-nCoV M pro , indicating the potential of these drugs to function as inhibitors for other coronaviruses with similar M pro binding sites and pocket structures.
