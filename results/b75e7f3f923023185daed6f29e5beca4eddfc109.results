Identification of host proteins interacting with LASV GP. To identify the host proteins interacting with LASV GP, we adopted a strategy to tag its C terminus with a Twin-Strep-tag, which is advantageous for the one-step purification of protein complexes from cell lysates (43) (44) (45) . No significant changes of the proteolytic cleavage, glycosylation, or cell surface transport were observed between the tagged and untagged LASV GPs (Fig. 1A) . Then, plasmids encoding the tagged LASV GP or vector plasmid as a control were transfected into HEK293T cells. At 48 h posttransfection, the cells were harvested, and LASV GP-associated host proteins were purified from the cell lysates by magnetic Sepharose beads coated with Strep-Tactin XT and subjected to Western blot analysis using a GP1-specific serum or anti-Strep antibody. Cleaved GP1 and GP2 were purified simultaneously from the cell lysates, together with a noncleaved form of GPC (Fig. 1B) . The retention of cleaved GP1 with purified GP2 suggests that viral GP remained in the prefusion conformation during the purification process since GP1 and GP2 interact with each other through unstable noncovalent interactions, and irreversible conformation changes during the membrane fusion process lead to their disassociation (20, 25) . Then, eluted proteins were trypsin digested and subjected to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Three independent replicate experiments were performed, and a total of 1,104 host proteins were identified from at least one independent replicate (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Only proteins meeting the following criteria were considered as interactors of GP: (i) for proteins identified in only the GP group but not the control group, at least two peptides should be identified, or (ii) for proteins identified in both the GP and control groups, the GP versus control group peptide count ratios should be Ͼ3 (Fig. 1C) . With this standard, 591 proteins were considered as valid interactors of LASV GPs. ␣-DG, the host receptor of OW arenaviruses (23) , was detected in the GP groups with high abundance but not in the control groups (Table S1) . Gene ontology analysis of LASV GP-interacting proteins highlighted the OST complex. To functionally annotate interactors, 591 host proteins identified here were submitted to Protein Annotation Through Evolutionary Relationship (PANTHER) to perform gene ontology (GO) analysis (46) . As shown in Fig. 2A and Table S1 in the supplemental material, 591 proteins were clustered into 22 groups based on the cellular components, demonstrating the extensive cellular distribution of LASV GP interactors. Multiple proteins were clustered into compartments of the host secretory system, such as the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, Golgi apparatus, and plasma membrane. Interactors residing in these cellular components might participate in the maturation process of LASV GP and thus affect viral replication. To further explore the biological significance of GP-associated interactors, statistical overrepresentation tests for GO molecular functions and biological processes were also performed. Redundant GO terms were first eliminated by REVIGO based on semantic similarity (47) and further summarized manually. Functional subsets of proteins with ranked fold enrichment values and -log10(P values) are shown in Fig. 2B . The top overrepresented functional subsets from GO molecular function and biological process analyses with high fold enrichment values (Ͼ10) are highlighted in the scatterplot graph (central region) and listed in Tables 1 and 2. Proteins responsible for host OST activity were highly overrepresented. STT3A and STT3B, the two isoforms of the catalytic subunit of the mammalian OST complex, together with their auxiliary subunits were identified as GP interactors here (Fig. 2C ). In addition, proteins involved in the protein folding process and proteasome activity were also significantly enriched in the data set, hinting at possible roles of these proteins in arenavirus GP physiology. Interestingly, multiple proteins responsible for nuclear transport or Ran GTPase binding were also enriched in the data set, consistent with the results of a proteomic survey of JUNV virions (48) , while their roles in virus replication remain unknown. To verify the interactions between LASV GP and the OST subunits identified here, coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses were performed. Twin-Strep-tagged LASV GP with its associated proteins was purified from cell lysates. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged with a Twin-Strep-tag was also set as the control bait. Endogenous STT3A and STT3B or exogenously expressed RPN1, RPN2, OSTC, and DDOST/ OST48 were detected in the GP fraction but not in the GFP-purified fraction (Fig. 3A to F). Most of the OST subunits (excluding DDOST) migrated into diffused bands and HEK293T cells were transfected with a pCAGGs plasmid encoding LASV GP with a C-terminal Twin-Strep-tag or a pCAGGs plasmid expressing only the Twin-Strep-tag as a control. At 48 h posttransfection, the cells were harvested and lysed by using a mild nonionic detergent buffer at 4°C. LASV GP-associated host interactors were pulled down from cell lysates by magnetic Sepharose beads coated with Strep-Tactin XT. Purified proteins were digested into peptides by trypsin and subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to test whether the Twin-Strep-tag would affect the proteolytic cleavage, glycosylation, and cell surface transport of LASV GP. The cleavage rates of tagged and untagged GP2 are shown above, as determined by densitometric quantification. (B) Silver-stained SDS-PAGE gel of purified LASV GP together with host interactors or the control group. Western blot analysis was also conducted to show the bands of viral GP1 and GP2, as detected by GP1-specific serum and an anti-Strep antibody, respectively. The silver-stained and Western blot gels shown here are representatives of three independent replicates. (C) The left column diagram shows the distribution of detected peptide counts from proteins identified in only the GP group and not in the control group. The right column diagram shows the distribution of peptide count ratios from proteins identified in both the GP group and the control group (GP/control). Proteins that fulfilled our filtration standard in the two groups were considered to be valid interactors. formed high-molecular-weight aggregates, probably because of stable associations with other subunits of the OST complex. We also compared our data set to a previous interactome of LCMV GP and found that 127 proteins were common (Table S1) (49) . Interestingly, subunits of the OST complex were also identified in the interactome of LCMV GP, including STT3B, DDOST, RPN1, RPN2, and MAGT1. These results suggested a high confidence level of our interactome results and confirmed that LASV GP interacted specifically with the host OST complex. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated isoform-specific knockouts of the OST complex impaired the propagation of the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus. The GPs of arenaviruses are highly glycosylated (34) , and the absence of even a single GP glycosylation site could globally attenuate the arenavirus in vivo (50) . We hypothesized that the OST complex is central to GP modification and might therefore play a vital role in virus propagation. Because of partly redundant functions of the two isoforms in N-linked glycosylation, most glycoproteins in host cells can be modified by both OST isoforms except for a few special proteins that are preferentially modified by either STT3A or STT3B (51). STT3A and STT3B also display distinct enzymatic properties, and differential utilization of the Tables 1 and 2 . The test was performed using the Fisher exact test with an FDR multiple test correction of Ͻ0.05. (C) Representative overview of the LASV GP interactome classified based on both biological processes and molecular functions, which were visualized by Cytoscape. Subunits of the OST complex are highlighted by a red square. MAGT1 and TUSC3 were validated by the coimmunoprecipitation assay shown below and are also presented here. Note that not all the interactors are presented here. In addition, note that one protein may be classified into more than one subset. two isoforms may represent distinct glycosylation patterns (52) . It remains unknown whether the glycosylation of LASV GP requires both OST isoforms. Since the small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of OST subunits in HEK293 cells is reported to be relatively ineffective (53), we generated STT3A and STT3B knockout cells (STT3Aand STT3Bcells) by using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to explore the roles of STT3A and STT3B in arenavirus propagation. Plasmids encoding single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the exons of the STT3A and STT3B genes were transfected into HEK293T cells to direct genome editing. Knockouts of STT3A and STT3B were confirmed by sequencing (Fig. 4A , frameshift mutations at the corresponding sites) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 4B ). To further confirm the loss of STT3A and STT3B catalytic activity, the N-glycosylation of two plasmids expressing progranulin (pGRN) or sex hormone- binding globulin (SHBG), which were reported to be specific N-glycosylation substrates of STT3A or STT3B, respectively, was examined (54, 55) . As shown in Fig. 4C , N-glycosylation of pGRN was inhibited in STT3Acells but not in wild-type (WT) cells or STT3Bcells, whereas knockout of STT3B inhibited the N-glycosylation of only SHBG. To explore whether STT3A and STT3B affect viral replication, we rescued a recombinant arenavirus, rLCMV/LASV GPC, in which LCMV GP was replaced by LASV GP, while the backbone of LCMV was not altered. This recombinant virus can be manipulated in BSL-2 conditions and reportedly exhibits high fitness with intact characteristics of LASV GP (56) . STT3Aand STT3Bcells were infected with rLCMV/LASV GPC and harvested at the indicated time points. The intracellular viral level was determined based on the amount of viral S genomic RNA(ϩ), as determined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), and the viral titer in the supernatant was determined by an immunological plaque assay. As shown in Fig. 4D , the intracellular level of the viral S genome was only slightly reduced in STT3Aor STT3Bcells, indicating that viral genome replication was not significantly affected by the knockout of STT3A or STT3B. The titers in the supernatants of STT3Aand STT3Bcells were reduced dramatically, indicating that knockout of STT3A or STT3B impaired the propagation of rLCMV/LASV GPC. These results showed that both STT3A and STT3B are host factors on which the virus depends. Knockout of STT3A or STT3B led to the formation of viral particles with reduced infectivity. To explore whether STT3A or STT3B plays roles in productive viral entry and early infection, STT3A -, STT3B -, and WT cells were infected with rLCMV/LASV GPC at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. We examined intracellular levels of viral nucleoprotein (NP) at 8 h postinfection (hpi), at which time point LASV has reportedly finished entry (57) . As shown in Fig. 5A , no significant changes were observed, suggesting that knockout of STT3A or STT3B did not affect viral entry or early infection. Since knockout of STT3A or STT3B had no significant effects on the replication of the rLCMV/LASV GPC genome (Fig. 4D ), we tested whether knockout of STT3A or STT3B affected the release of viral particles. To this end, STT3Aor STT3Bcells were infected with rLCMV/LASV GPC, and both intracellular and supernatant viral genomes were measured by qRT-PCR at 48 hpi. The ratio of the supernatant viral genome level versus the intracellular viral genome level was calculated as an indicator of virus budding ability. Knockout of STT3A or STT3B had no significant effect on virus budding ability ( Fig. 5B ), suggesting that STT3A or STT3B did not affect viral release. Although the absolute viral genome levels were partly reduced in STT3Aand STT3Bcells, the extent of reduction (Ͻ2-fold) was insufficient to explain the dramatic reduction in viral titers in the supernatants (Ͼ30-fold reduction, shown in Fig. 4D ). The viral titers decreased dramatically with only mild reductions in the viral genome RNA levels in the supernatants of STT3Aor STT3Bcells ( Fig. 5C ), suggesting that viral particles derived from STT3Aor STT3Bcells may have reduced viral infectivity. We calculated the ratio of viral titers to viral genome RNA copy numbers in the supernatant as an indicator of viral infectivity. As shown in Fig. 5D , viral particles derived from STT3Aor STT3Bknockout cells exhibited reduced viral infectivity. Viral infectivity was further visualized by the infection of a rLCMV (NP-P2A-GFP)/LASV GPC virus, in which LCMV NP was linked with GFP by a P2A self-cleaving peptide. Cells infected with the rLCMV (NP-P2A-GFP)/LASV GPC virus were immobilized, and viral foci were observed at different time points. As shown in Fig. 5E , knockout of STT3A and STT3B did not reduce the number of viral foci; however, the viral foci in STT3Aand STT3Bcells were notably . GAPDH was also detected as a control of cell lysate input and bead fraction output (A to H, bottom). Bands indicating specific interactions between LASV GP and the OST subunits are marked with a red star. Note that some of the OST subunits were found to migrated into diffused bands and formed high-molecular-weight aggregates in the SDS-PAGE gels. LASV GP but not the control GFP was able to pull down all of the subunits identified in our MS data set. smaller than those in WT cells, suggesting reduced virus infectivity. Based on these results, we concluded that the inhibited propagation of the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus by the knockout of STT3A or STT3B was mainly due to the reduced viral infectivity. Knockout of STT3B caused hypoglycosylation of LASV GP. Since both STT3A and STT3B play roles in virus propagation, we sought to investigate the glycosylation profile of viral GP in STT3Aand STT3Bcells. Cells infected with the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus were harvested at the indicated time points and subjected to Western blotting. In STT3Acells, the viral GP displayed the same glycosylation pattern as that in WT cells, but the proteolytic cleavage process was hindered in the early stage of infection (24 and 36 hpi). Even so, the viral GP in STT3Acells reached a level of maturation similar to that observed in WT cells at the late stage of infection (Fig. 6A) . Knockout of STT3A did not significantly affect the glycosylation of LASV GP, which might be explained by the functionally compensatory effect executed by the STT3B isoform of OST in STT3Acells. However, we observed an obviously hypoglycosylated form of noncleaved GPC in STT3Bcells. To exclude the possibility that the reduced molecular weight of viral GPC was caused by other modifications, such as phosphorylation, viral proteins from different cell lines were subjected to cleavage by PNGase F to remove the N-glycans. As shown in Fig. 6B , the migration of the unglycosylated form of noncleaved GPC was identical among these cells, suggesting that the differential migration of the glycosylated form of GPC in STT3Bcells was due to the distinct glycosylation status of GPC. Taken together, these data showed that LASV GP was a preferential substrate of STT3B-OST and that the full glycosylation of LASV GP requires the STT3B-OST isoform. Although STT3A was not an essential prerequisite for the glycosylation of LASV GP, loss of STT3A delayed its proteolytic cleavage. Incorporation of viral GP into viral particles was reduced in STT3Aand STT3Bcells. Since knockout of STT3A or STT3B hindered the proteolytic cleavage of GPC, we explored whether the incorporation of GP in virions was affected in STT3Aand STT3Bcells. Virions derived from different cells were collected and screened for viral proteins (GP1, GP2, and NP) by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 6C , only cleaved GP1 or GP2 was detected, which was in line with a previous report demonstrating that cleavage is necessary for the incorporation of GP into virions (14) . Viral NP, GP1, and GP2 levels were reduced in viral particles derived from STT3Aand STT3Bcells, suggesting reduced virus production. The GP2/NP band intensity ratios were calculated as an indicator of the number of viral GPs incorporated into a single viral particle. As shown in Fig. 6D , the ratios of GP2 to NP derived from both STT3Aand STT3Bcells were significantly reduced compared to those from WT cells, suggesting that the GP composition in virions was reduced. To explore whether the reduced GP levels in virions derived from STT3Aor STT3Bcells affect virus infection, the binding abilities of these virions were tested. Genome RNA-normalized virions derived from different cells were added to BHK-21 cells, and the virus binding ability was measured by qRT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 6E , virions derived from STT3Aand STT3Bcells exhibited a partial defect in their ability to attach to normal BHK-21 cells. Based on these results, we concluded that knockout of STT3A and STT3B reduced the level of GP incorporated into viral particles and hindered the ability of the virus to bind permissive cells. MAGT1 and TUSC3 were required for the full glycosylation of LASV GP. The results [resented above revealed that LASV GP was a preferred substrate of STT3B-OST. MAGT1 and TUSC3 are specific subunits of the STT3B-OST complex. Despite their replaceable functions, MAGT1 mRNA was shown to be widely expressed in human tissues, whereas the expression of TUSC3 is relatively more restricted (58) . The expression of TUSC3 in several cultured cell lines was reported to be difficult to detect by Western blotting (53) . MAGT1 was found to weakly interact with LASV GP in our MS data set, while TUSC3 was not identified (Table S1 ). This result could be explained by previous reports demonstrating that MAGT1 and TUSC3 easily dissociated from the canine OST during the purification process (52) . To confirm that MAGT1 and TUSC3 were host interactors of LASV GP, a pCAGGs plasmid encoding 6ϫHis-tagged MAGT1 or Flag-tagged TUSC3 was cotransfected with LASV GP into HEK293T cells. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses revealed that viral GP but not GFP was able to pull down exogenously expressed MAGT1 and TUSC3, indicating that these proteins were also host interactors of LASV GP (Fig. 3G and H) . We then sought to explore the roles of MAGT1 and TUSC3 in virus propagation. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of MAGT1 and TUSC3 cell lines were constructed (MAGT1and TUSC3cells) as described above and confirmed by sequencing (Fig. 7A) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 7C) . The expression levels of both MAGT1 and TUSC3 were also decreased in STT3Bcells, indicating that their expression relies on the existence of STT3B. Although virus titers were partly reduced in MAGT1and TUSC3cells compared to that in WT cells (Fig. 7C, right) , glycosylation of LASV GP was not significantly altered in these two cells. The inefficiency of functional knockout might be explained by the functional compensation between the two proteins. The level of TUSC3 in WT cells was almost undetectable by Western blotting, while a deficiency of MAGT1 was accompanied by obviously increased expression of TUSC3 (Fig. 7C, lanes 1  and 5) . To confirm this finding, the MAGT1 -TUSC3cell line was constructed (Fig. 7B) . Both MAGT1 -TUSC3cells and STT3Bcells were then infected with the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus, and we observed the same hypoglycosylation pattern of viral GP in the two cells compared to the glycosylation pattern in WT cells (Fig. 7C) , indicating that MAGT1 Journal of Virology or TUSC3 was required for full viral GP glycosylation. The virus titer derived from MAGT1 -TUSC3cells was also dramatically reduced compared to that derived from WT cells (Fig. 7C) . Similarly, the viral foci in MAGT1 -TUSC3cells were notably smaller than those in WT cells (Fig. 5D) , as in STT3Bcells. Full glycosylation of LASV GP requires the CXXC active-site motifs of MAGT1 and TUSC3. MAGT1 and TUSC3 are thioredoxin homologs, and a luminally oriented CXXC active-site motif is responsible for their oxidoreductase activity (59) . A protein tertiary structure stabilized by disulfide bonds is a negative regulatory factor for their posttranslational glycosylation (60) . MAGT1 and TUSC3 delay the folding of nascent polypeptides by forming mixed disulfide bonds with cysteine-proximal glycosylation sequons via their CXXC site motifs and thereby facilitate access to STT3B (41) . Mutation of the active site cysteines of MAGT1 or TUSC3 resulted in the hypoglycosylation of a subset of STT3B-dependent substrates (41) . To test whether the glycosylation of LASV GP requires the oxidoreductase activity of MAGT1 and TUSC3, plasmids encoding MAGT1/TUSC3 or MAGT1/TUSC3 with SXXC, CXXS, or SXXS mutations were transfected into MAGT1 -TUSC3cells to restore the glycosylation of LASV GP. As shown in Fig. 8 , the expression of WT MAGT1 or WT TUSC3 was able to restore the glycosylation of LASV GPC (lanes 1, 5, and 6), whereas MAGT1 and TUSC3 with mutations of any cysteine in their CXXC site motifs failed to restore glycosylation and virus replication (lanes 2, 3, and 4). Our results revealed that the oxidoreductase CXXC active-site motifs of MAGT1 and TUSC3 play roles in the full glycosylation of LASV GP. A small-molecule OST inhibitor impaired the propagation of the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus. NGI-1, a small-molecule OST inhibitor, was reported to directly target and block the function of the OST catalytic subunits STT3A and STT3B. Unlike tunicamycin, NGI-1 does not completely inhibit all the N-glycosylation sites, and this probably determines the reduced cellular toxicity of NGI-1, making it an excellent approach to modulate N-glycosylation in mammalian cells (61) . To test the inhibitory effect of NGI-1 on the N-glycosylation of LASV GP, STT3A -, STT3B -, MAGT1 -TUSC3 -, and WT cells were infected with the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus and then treated with NGI-1 at the indicated concentrations. None of the concentrations showed cellular toxicity during the incubation time (data not shown). Cells were harvested at 36 hpi and subjected to Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 9A , NGI-1 was able to inhibit the glycosylation of LASV GP mediated by STT3A-OST (in STT3Band MAGT1 -TUSC3cells) or STT3B-OST (in STT3Acells) and impaired its proteolytic cleavage in a dose-dependent manner. At the same NGI-1 concentrations, hypoglycosylation of LASV GP was most severe in STT3Band MAGT1 -TUSC3cells compared to that in STT3Aand WT cells. To further evaluate the effect of NGI-1 on virus propagation, supernatant viral titers and viral RNA copy numbers were determined by the immunological plaque assay and qRT-PCR, respectively. As shown in Fig. 9B , NGI-1 treatment significantly reduced the viral titers, while the viral RNA copy numbers were only mildly reduced, indicating that NGI-1 mainly impaired virus infectivity but not the number of released progeny viruses. The effect of NGI-1 on LASV GP and virus propagation was also tested in several other human cell lines, including A549, HeLa, Huh7, and HEK293 cells, and both hypoglycosylation of LASV GP and reduced viral titer were observed ( Fig. 9C and D) , which is consistent with the findings in HEK293T cells. The preferential requirement for STT3B-dependent N-glycosylation of GP was conserved among arenaviruses. Arenavirus GPs are all highly glycosylated. We next sought to explore whether the preferential requirement for STT3B-dependent N-glycosylation is conserved among other arenaviruses. Plasmids encoding GPs of OW arenaviruses, including LCMV, Mopeia virus (MOPV), Lujo virus (LUJV), and Dandenong detected. GAPDH was detected as a loading control for each lane. Hypoglycosylation of viral glycoprotein is indicated by red triangles. Supernatant viral titers derived from different cell lines were determined by the immunological plaque assay. The data presented here represent the means Ϯ the SD of three independent experiments, and each independent experiment had two replicates. virus (DNAV) (Fig. 10A ) and NW arenaviruses, including JUNV and MACV (Fig. 10B) , were transfected into STT3A -, STT3B -, MAGT1 -TUSC3 -, and WT cells. The glycosylation patterns of viral GPs were then analyzed by Western blotting. We observed hypoglycosylation patterns for all the arenavirus GPs tested in STT3Band MAGT1 -TUSC3cells, indicating the conserved requirement of STT3B and MAGT1/TUSC3 for arenavirus glycosylation. We also tested the effect of knockout of STT3A or STT3B on the glycoproteins of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), influenza A virus, and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). As shown in Fig. 10C , influenza HA was only affected by knockout of STT3B, whereas HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (GP160) was affected by knockout of STT3A or STT3B. No significant changes of molecular weight were observed in VSV glycoprotein (VSV-G). To test whether STT3A and STT3B can affect the infectivity of other arenaviruses, two other viruses, LCMV and rLCMV/MACV GPC, were chosen as representatives of OW and NW arenaviruses to explore their propagation in STT3A -, STT3B -, MAGT1 -TUSC3 -, and WT cells. Cells were infected with viruses and harvested at 36 hpi. Supernatant viral titers and viral RNA copy numbers were determined by the immunological plaque assay and qRT-PCR, respectively. As shown in Fig. 10D , both the titers and the RNA copy numbers of the LCMV and rLCMV/MACV GPC viruses were reduced in the three OST-knockout cells, demonstrating the impaired propagation of both viruses. Even so, the viral RNA copy numbers were reduced less than the viral titers, especially for the rLCMV/MACV GPC virus, indicating that virus infectivity was affected, which is in line with that of the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus. NGI-1 was also able to severely reduce the viral titers, whereas viral RNA copy numbers were only mildly reduced (Fig. 10E) . The viral infectivity was further visualized by the infection of the rLCMV (NP-P2A-GFP) and rLCMV (NP-P2A-GFP)/MACV GPC viruses. Similarly, the viral foci (36 hpi) in OST-knockout cells were notably smaller than those in WT cells, especially in STT3Band MAGT1 -TUSC3cells (Fig. 10F) . Our results revealed that the dependence on the host OST complex was conserved among arenaviruses.
