A total of 314 symptomatic MERS patients were included in the analysis, with a mean age of 48 ( Â± 17.3) years. Of these cases, 78 (24.8%) died. Table 1 shows identified parameters to be associated with mortality. In binary logistic regression analysis with a backward stepwise approach the following parameters were associated with increased mortality, age, increased WBC, and neutrophil count, lower serum albumin level, use of CRRT and corticosteroid use. The odd ratio for mortality was highest for CRRT and corticosteroid use (4.95 and 3.85, respectively). The use of interferon-ribavirin was not associated with mortality in this cohort. The majority of patients received methyl-prednisone with variable doses and duration (see Table 2 ).
