The body weights of the mice in the CTRL and QUE groups were not significantly different before and after the experiment, whereas those of the mice in the CR-infection group were lower after the experiment ( Figure 1A) . On day 7 postinfection, the C. rodentium count in the colonic contents or feces was not different between the CR-infection and QUE groups (Figures 1B,C) . While comparing with the mice in the CTRL and QUE groups, the mice in the CR-infection group showed signs of colitis (Figures 2A-D) . Compared with the mice in the CTRL group, those in the CR-infection and QUE groups showed significantly elevated IL-10 ( Figure 3A) , IL-17 (Figure 3B ), IL-6 ( Figure 3C) , and TNF-α ( Figure 3D ) levels (all p < 0.05). Quercetin supplementation also significantly increased the IL-10 level in the QUE mice ( Figure 3A ) compared with the level found in the CR-infected mice (p < 0.05). However, quercetin supplementation in the QUE group appeared to mitigate the C. rodentium-induced increases in the IL-17 (Figure 3B ), IL-6 ( Figure 3C) , and TNF-α ( Figure 3D ) levels (p < 0.05). Amplification of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene obtained from the colonic contents of CTRL, CR-infected, and QUE groups provided raw readings (35,673, 37,894, and 33,511, respectively) to facilitate the assessment of the effects of C. rodentium infection and dietary quercetin on bacterial communities. Following trimming, assembly, and quality filtering, 2,895 OTUs were detected. Figure 4 presents the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices and microbial richness indices (Chao1 and ACE) in the groups. Compared with the CTRL group, the CR-infection group showed significantly increased Simpson index (p < 0.05) ( Figure 4A ) and decreased Chao1 (Figure 4B) , Shannon ( Figure 4C ) and ACE indices ( Figure 4D ) (all, p < 0.05). Compared with the CR-infection group, the QUE group showed increased Chao1 (Figure 4B) , Shannon (Figure 4C) , and ACE indices ( Figure 4D ) (all, p < 0.05) and decreased Simpson index ( Figure 4A ) (p < 0.05). However, the observed alpha diversity of the microbiota showed no significant difference between the CTRL and QUE groups. Taxon-dependent analysis was used to determine the intestinal microbiota taxonomy, and Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia were found to be the most abundant phyla (Figures 5A-D) . Their relative abundances were 56.32, 33.18, 2.42 and 2.45%, respectively, in the CTRL group; 67.54, 24.47, 2.45, and 4.31%, respectively, in the CR-infection group; and 57.24, 29.87, 2.89, and 3.13%, respectively, in the QUE group. Microbial populations at the genus level in the colonic contents were also investigated (Figures 6A-F) . The populations of Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Clostridia were decreased (p < 0.05), and those of Fusobacterium and Enterococcus were increased in the CR-infection group (p < 0.05) compared with those in3 the CTRL group. Notably, compared with the CR-infection group, the QUE group showed enhanced populations of Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Clostridia but suppressed populations of Fusobacterium and Enterococcus (p < 0.05) because of quercetin supplementation.
