GRP78 overwhelms its viral secretion-promoting effect to suppress HBV production in HepG2.2.15 cells GRP78 has been reported to promote the secretion of HBV particles in HepG2.2.15 cells, but to act as an intracellular anti-HBV factor in HepAD38, a cell line with Tetoff promoter to control its HBV production [22] [23] [24] . Though both reports used siRNA to down-regulate GRP78, the decrease and increase in supernatant HBV particles were observed, respectively. This discordance may result from the difference in cell models. Compared with HepAD38 cells, HepG2.2.15 cells produce HBV particles in a continuous manner, which better mimics the persistent infection state of patients. For this reason, HepG2.2.15 cells were used in this study to clarify the overall effect of GRP78 on HBV production. GRP78 was successfully up-regulated and down-regulated by transfections of the recombinant expression plasmid and the siRNA of GRP78, respectively (Fig. 1a) . GRP78 overexpression reduced supernatant and intracellular coreassociated HBV DNA and GRP78 knockdown showed the opposite effect ( Fig. 1b and c) . GRP78 was regularly detected as two bands, perhaps due to splice variation. Though the same cell model was used, the effect of GRP78 here was opposite to that reported in the published literature [24] , which may result from the uses of different observation time, 72 h in this study and 24 h in literature. To test this possibility, supernatant coreassociated HBV DNA was detected 24 h after transfections (Fig. 1d) . As result, GRP78 indeed moderately increases the supernatant level of HBV particles. Furthermore, GRP78 was found to inhibit HBV production slightly 48 h and significantly 96 h after transfections. The above results suggest that the HBV replication-inhibiting effect of GRP78 time-dependently overwhelmed its viral secretionpromoting effect and that GRP78 mainly inhibits HBV production in patients with persistent infection. GRP78 may not inhibit HBV replication by the IFN-β1dependent pathway in HepG2.2.15 cells GRP78 reduced HBV production by inhibiting viral DNA replication ( Fig. 1) . However, the underlying mechanism in HepG2.2.15 cells is unclear yet. Based on the findings in HepG2 cells (parent cells of HepG2.2.15), GRP78 has been reported to inhibit HBV replication through the activation of the IFN-β1-2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase-RNase L pathway [22] . Here, we wonder whether GRP78 similarly inhibits HBV replication in HepG2.2.15 cells. Unexpectedly, GRP78 overexpression or knockdown did not significantly affect the mRNA levels of IFN-β1 and RNase L genes ( Fig. 2a) or the protein level of IFN-β1 ( Fig. 2b) in HepG2.2.15 cells. To clarify the reasons behind the deviation in HepG2.2.15 cells, we further compared the expression levels of those genes of interest between these two cell lines. As results, the mRNA levels of IFN-β1and RNase L genes in HepG2.2.15 cells were only about 1/10 and 1/100 of those in HepG2 cells, respectively ( Fig. 2c ). Similarly, the protein level of IFN-β1 in HepG2.2.15 cells was much lower than that in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2d) . These results ascertain that the IFN-β1dependent pathway has been blocked and GRP78 does not inhibit HBV replication by this pathway in HepG2.2.15 cells.
