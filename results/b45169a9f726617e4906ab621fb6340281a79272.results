During the observation period, the utilization of personal protective equipment (PPE) with cases of MERS-CoV compared with the period before MERS-CoV cases increased dramatically from 2,947.4 to 10,283.9 per 1,000 patient-days (P < .0000001) for surgical masks and from 22 to 232 per 1,000 patient days (P < .0000001) for N95 masks (Fig 1) . It is interesting to note that the increase in utilization of N95 masks preceded the increase in surgical mask utilization by about 1 month. The utilization of alcohol-based hand sanitizer and soap is shown in Figure 2 ; there was a significant increase in the used amount (P < .0000001). Hand hygiene compliance rates are shown in Figure 2 . The hand hygiene compliance rate increased from 73% just before the occurrence of the first MERS case to 88% during MERS cases (P = .0001) (Fig 3) . The monthly added cost was $16,400 for the included infection control items, such as hand sanitizers, soap, surgical masks, and N95 respirators.
