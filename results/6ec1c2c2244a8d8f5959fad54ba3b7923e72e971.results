Two-hundred and fifty-four persons in the total population sample (n = 1,011) could not be reached by a telephone call. Of the 757 persons reached, 443 provided a complete response, leading to a 59% response rate to the telephone survey and a 44% participation rate with regard to the total sample. The age category 65-90 years was slightly over-represented (54% response rate) among the study participants when compared to the total population sample (p = 0.039). However, the effect size of this difference in participation was small (Cramer's V = 0.08). Thus, while elderly individuals were overrepresented in our data, the impact of this deviation from the reference population was of a small magnitude. In terms of place of residence, those living in small labor market regions (with a total population of less than 100,000 inhabitants) exhibited the highest participation rates: 51%, compared to 41% in large regions (with a population greater than 1 000,000 inhabitants). The basic sociodemiographic characteristics of the final study participants are displayed in Table 1 . The general level of health in the study population as measured by SF-8 scores was above the reference values for all items except for Physical functioning and Vitality (lower scores) and General Health (equal scores) ( Table 2 ). There was no statistically significant difference between men and women regarding the mean scores of any SF-8 item or summary component.
