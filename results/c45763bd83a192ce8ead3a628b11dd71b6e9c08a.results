The WHO declared ZIKV a "Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)", with triggering funding into research, vector control, and efforts to stop pregnant women becoming infected. 4 In the following part of the manuscript the epidemiology, phobia against ZIKV in mass gathering and recommendation for its prevention and control is being discussed. Descriptive epidemiology of ZIKV: 1. Person: Approximately two-thirds of the world population lives in areas infested by Aedes (Ae.) mosquito vector. 5 Furthermore, anyone who lives in or travels to an areas where ZIKV is already circulating and has not been infected with the virus can get it through mosquito bites. Once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections. In addition, recently it was found that persons can catch infection through person to person transmission. 6 2. Time: The breading season of Ae. mosquitoes is usually during warm and rainy seasons in tropics and subtropics. The mosquito usually bite during the day times (after sunrise and before sunset). 6 primarily monkeys in an "enzootic mosquitomonkey-mosquito cycle", with only occasional transmission to humans. Before the current pandemic began in 2007, Zika rarely caused recognized 'spillover' infections in humans, even in highly enzootic areas. In the current pandemic, human is a host of ZIKV and local transmission between human has been reported in many countries and territories 6, 12, 13 Zika antibodies were detected also in ducks, goats, cows, horses, bats, and carabaos. 13 The vector reservoir host is Aedes mosquitoes. 6 3. Environment: Ae. aegypti and albopictus live and lay eggs in the stagnant water collections and water-holding containers (as puddles, buckets, empty cans) around the households. Example of such areas are the peri-domestic areas with absent of the piped water provision; as in the slums in tropics and subtropics. This need warm and rainy season of the tropics and sub-tropics. 7,13
