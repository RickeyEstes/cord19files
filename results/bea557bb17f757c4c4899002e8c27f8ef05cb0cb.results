In total, 133 school nurses participated (33.6% response rate). Almost all nurse participants were women (99.2%, n ¼ 132) and white (95.5%, n ¼ 127). Most were aged 41 years, with almost half (48.9%, n ¼ 65) being 51-60 years and 23.3% (n ¼ 31) being 41-50 years old. Over half of the nurses had either an associate's degree (22.6%, n ¼ 30) or a bachelor's degree (39.1%, n ¼ 52); only 1 (0.8%) was a nurse practitioner. Approximately half (58.6%, n ¼ 78) reported being a school nurse (as opposed to being a lead nurse). Half (51.9%, n ¼ 69) were members of their school disaster planning committee. Nurse participants reported covering from 1-17 schools. Most (63.2%, n ¼ 84) cover only a single school; of those who cover >1 school (n ¼ 49), almost half (44.9%, n ¼ 22) cover 2 schools. The nurses represented schools of all sizes and grade levels. Just under half of the schools (42.9%, n ¼ 57) had 501 students, and a quarter (24.8%, n ¼ 33) had 300. Half (49.2%, n ¼ 65) were elementary schools, 22.7% (n ¼ 30) were middle schools, and 28.0% (n ¼ 37) were high schools. Almost all of the schools (94.7%, n ¼ 126) were public. Almost half (45.6%, n ¼ 61) were suburban, and only 12.8% (n ¼ 17) were urban. Demographics of the nurse participants are nearly identical to those of school nurses nationwide. 13
