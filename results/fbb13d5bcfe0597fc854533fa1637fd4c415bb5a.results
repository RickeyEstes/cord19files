Generation of a rIBV with the genomic backbone of Beau-R but expressing the S gene from 4/91(UK) Sequence analysis of the IBV 4/91(UK) S gene identified 555 nucleotide differences and a 6-nucleotide insertion when compared to the Beau-R S gene sequence, corresponding to a total of 201 amino acid differences between the two S glycoproteins with two extra amino acids within the 4/91 S glycoprotein (Fig. 2 ). There is one amino acid difference between the cytoplasmic domains of the two viruses, M 1131 R I 1133 for Beau-R and 4/91(UK), respectively. Overall, the primary translation products of the two S genes are 1164 and 1162 amino acids for 4/91(UK) and Beau-R, respectively, with an identity of 82.7% between the two S proteins; 75.3% and 89.1% identity for the S1 and S2 subunits, respectively. A chimaeric S gene, consisting of the signal sequence, ectodomain and transmembrane regions derived from IBV 4/91(UK) and the cytoplasmic tail from Beau-R, was produced. The last 137 nucleotides of the Beaudette S gene, comprising of the cytoplasmic domain, were retained to maintain any interaction [18] of the S protein C-terminal domain with the other Beaudette-derived proteins. The transmembrane regions between the two S glycoproteins only contained one amino acid difference, T 1104 R I 1106 for Beau-R and 4/91(UK), respectively. A plasmid, pGPT-4/91S, containing the chimaeric S gene with the above characteristics was generated and used to produce a full-length IBV-derived cDNA, containing the complete genomic sequence of Beau-R but with the chimaeric S gene within the vaccinia virus genome, using the TDS method. This was achieved using a Beau-R-DS receiver sequence and a donor sequence in pGPT-4/91S (Fig. 1) . Following TDS, DNA was extracted from four rVVs, potentially containing the BeauR-4/91(S) cDNA. Analysis by PCR, using GPT-specific primers confirmed the loss of the GPT gene following the second TDS recombination event in three of the rVVs. The IBV cDNAs within these rVV DNAs were analysed for the presence of 4/91 S sequence by amplifying a region comprising the S gene. Three rVVs, were then further screened by sequence analysis of different regions of the S1 and S2 subunits of the chimaeric S gene to confirm that an S gene, with the ectodomain sequence from IBV 4/91(UK) had been inserted into the IBV Beaudette genomic sequence lacking an S gene sequence. All three rVVs were found to contain the sequence corresponding to the chimaeric S gene, one rVV, rVV-BeauR-4/91(S), was chosen for further work.
