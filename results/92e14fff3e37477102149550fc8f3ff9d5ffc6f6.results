Poorly Adapted HIV-1 Codons are Mostly A-ending Viral codon adaptation is considered poor when codons highly avoided by the host genes are highly used by viral genes, as host codon usage is considered a reliable indicator of the availability of cognate tRNAs (Bulmer 1987) . To identify HIV-1 codons poorly adapted to its host, the RSCU values for HIV-1 were plotted against human RSCU values ( fig.  1 ). RSCU measures the degree of bias in codon usage for each codon family. The codon usage of HIV-1 genes correlated poorly with that of host genes (Pearson r 5 Ã€0.1470, P 5 0.2665; Spearman r 5 0.1829, P 5 0.1657, fig. 1 ). Aending codons are particularly highly used by HIV-1 but strongly avoided by the host.
