A mock-virome (containing nine highly diverse viruses/phages), as well as a bacterial mock-community (containing four bacterial species common in the gut) were assembled to determine the effect of various sample treatment procedures and allowed to select for procedures that: 1) recover all viruses present in a sample, 2) alter the ratio of viral/(bacterial + rRNA) genetic material in favour of the viruses, and 3) introduce the least amount of bias in the relative distribution of viruses in a sample. Homogenisation, centrifugation, chloroform treatment, filtration and random amplification of nucleic acids were tested on the individual viral and bacterial communities to obtain a clear and clean understanding of the effect of the different tested procedures, avoiding unexpected interactions of viruses and bacteria. Homogenisation with ceramic beads reduces number of viral particles. To obtain reproducible results a proper homogenisation of biological samples (such as tissue or faecal samples) is crucial and minimises subsequent filter clogging 23 . As benchtop vortexers do not provide a standardised approach for sample homogenisation, a tissue homogeniser was used. The mock-virome and bacterial mock-community were subjected to homogenisation at different speeds (3000 and 5000 rpm) and with or without beads of different sizes (Ø0.1 and Ø2.8 mm) and compared to a non-homogenised control (Fig. 2) . Homogenisation with Ø2.8 mm beads led to a destruction of viral particles irrespective of homogenisation speed. The reduction was largest for coronavirus (99.5% and 99.6% and Ct differences of 8.5 and 8.9 for 5000 and 3000 rpm, respectively) and mimivirus (96.0% and 97.7% and Ct differences of 6.0 and 6.3 for 5000 and 3000 rpm, respectively). In addition, Ø2.8 mm beads led to a 316% and 350% increase in the detection of 16S rRNA at 5000 and 3000 rpm, respectively (Ct difference 2.3 and 2.4, respectively). For the bacteria, Ø2.8 mm beads also showed increases ranging from 612% (3.2Ct decrease) for the Bacteroides to 6184% for the E.coli (6.1Ct decrease). Homogenisation at 5000 rpm (without beads or with Ø0.1 mm beads) showed a larger reduction in viral particles than homogenisation at 3000 rpm. Reduction of viral particles was lowest using 3000 rpm homogenisation without beads (the maximum percentage of reduction was 59.6% for the pepino mosaic virus, 1.07Ct), and did not increase the amount of bacterial DNA/rRNA. All conditions resulted in well-homogenised suspensions suitable for subsequent filtration experiments (data not shown). Centrifugation conditions strongly influence the reduction in bacterial and viral particles. Centrifugation is commonly used to precipitate larger particles, such as cells and cellular debris, while viruses remain in solution. Since this step differs greatly among studies [24] [25] [26] , we decided to test a mild and medium centrifugal force (100 g and 17000 g, respectively) as well as short (3 min) and medium (30 min) centrifugation times on our mock-communities (Fig. 3) . Higher g-forces or longer centrifugation times were not tested as this would result in even higher viral losses. Centrifugation at 100 g for 3 min showed limited differences compared to the control for viruses, bacteria and rRNA. Only for Lactobacillus a reduction of more than 1 Ct was observed (68.6%; 1.8Ct increase). Centrifugation for 30 min at 100 g, resulted in an increased reduction of mimivirus (94.6%; 4.5Ct). For the bacteria, the highest reductions were observed for the Lactobacillus (99.0%; 7Ct) and Bifidobacterium (96.0%; 5Ct), whereas E.coli and Bacteroides showed less pronounced reductions (80.6% or 2.4 Ct and 48% or 0.95 Ct, respectively). Centrifugation at 17000 g for both 3 and 30 min resulted in more than 99.99% reductions for Bifidobacterium, E.coli and Bacteroides. The reduction in Lactobacillus was slightly lower (99.7%-99.8%), whereas the reduction in the rRNA was 98.5-99.4%. For 3 minutes at 17000 g the losses for viruses were negligible, except for polyomavirus (43.3% loss, 1.2Ct), herpesvirus (65.3% loss, 1.3Ct), and especially mimivirus (96.9% loss, 5.4Ct). These findings were much more pronounced when centrifugation was performed at 17000 g for 30 minutes. Surprisingly, more than 90% reduction was observed for polyomavirus, coronavirus and herpesvirus, and 99.9% for mimivirus. Although the samples where thoroughly homogenised, it cannot be excluded that this observation is due to viral aggregates still present in the sample. Filtration: keep the viruses or get rid of bacteria? Filtration is an efficient and widely used method to enrich viral particles by removing bacterial and host cells (human/animal/plant). Therefore, the mock-virome and bacterial mock-community were filtered with a 0.8-μ m centrifugal filter (PES), a 0.8-μ m polycarbonate filter (PC), a 0.45-μ m centrifugal filter (PVDF) or a 0.22-μ m centrifugal filter (PVDF) and compared with an unfiltered control (Fig. 4) . Filtration with the two 0.8-μ m and 0.45-μ m filters showed limited effects on most of the viruses in the mock-virome, except for mimivirus, the largest virus in the mock-virome, for which a 81.7% (3.8Ct increase), a 95.9% (6.8Ct) and a 99.0% (9.9Ct) reduction was observed for the 0.8-μ m PES, the 0.8-μ m PC and 0.45-μ m filters, respectively. The least mimivirus was recovered using the 0.22-μ m filter (99.90% reduction, 13.95Ct), and also 82.0% (4.1Ct) reduction was observed for herpesvirus using the 0.22-μ m filter. The use of the 0.8-μ m PC filter resulted in a reduction of 99.1% (7.5Ct) and 99.2% (7.9Ct) for Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, respectively, whereas E.coli (80.7%, 2.5Ct) and Bacteroides (50.1%, 1.04Ct) showed modest reductions. A much more efficient removal of bacteria was obtained with the 0.8-μ m PES, 0.45-μ m and 0.22-μ m filters, removing 99.5% to 99.90% of all bacteria present in the bacterial mock-community. Independent of the filter used, rRNA was less efficiently removed than bacteria (30-75% reduction; 0.7-2.4Ct).
