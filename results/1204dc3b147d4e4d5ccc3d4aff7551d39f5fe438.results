The mean age was 37.97 ± 13.9 years (range, 18 to 76 years). There were 16 men (mean age, 30.06 ± 13) and 15 women (mean age, 40 ± 14.8 years). Seventeen (54%) had a co-existing medical condition ( Table 1) . The mean duration of stay in the hospital was 10.35 ± 9 days, range 2 to 50 days. Twelve (38.7%) patients were admitted to the ICU. Five (16.1%) died due to respiratory failure. Of our patients, 87.1% had fever, 58% cough, 80.6% dyspnea, 25.8% vomiting, 16.1% diarrhea and nine (29%) hemoptysis. Eight (25.8%) had normal radiographs. The abnormal pattern was unilateral in four (12.9%) and bilateral in 19 (61.3%). The most common abnormal radiographic pattern was consolidation (12/31, 38.7%) (Figure 1 ) observed most frequently in the peripheral region (11/31; 35.5%) followed by peribronchovascular infiltration (10/31; 32.3%) which was present in the left lower lung zone in 61.3% and the right lower lung zone in 45.2% ( Table 2) . Other findings included cardiomegaly in five (16.1%) patients. Five (16.1%) patients had bilateral and two (6.4%) had unilateral pleural thickening or effusion ( Figure 2) . Five (16.1%) had hilar or mediastinal adenopathy ( Figure 3) . CPK was elevated in 9/24 and LDH in 14/22 patient. The platelet count was low in 32.3%. Hb was low in 22.6%. White blood cell (WBC) was high in 22.6%. Twelve patients with a mean age of 39.5 (66.7% women) were admitted to ICU. Seven had a preco-existing condition no. Respiratory disease (Asthma, COPD a ) 8 Cardiovascular (ischemic heart disease, hypertension) 5 Immunodeficiency (common variable immunodeficiency, HIV) 2 Cancer (multiple myeloma, synovial cell cancer) 2 Others (addiction, suicide, convulsions) 4 CPK was high in 6/10 and LDH in 10/10. The patients admitted to the ICU were more likely to have two or more lung zones involved (P = 0.005). Ten patients had an available CT scan and the most common pattern was ground glass opacities seen in six patients (60%) followed by consolidation in four (40%) which was most commonly observed in the peripheral region in six (60%) followed by the peribronchovascular region in five (50%) and in the upper lung zones in seven (70%) of patients.
