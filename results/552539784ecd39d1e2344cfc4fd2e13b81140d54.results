In pathogen-free rats, a network of MHC class II expressing cells, identified by their OX6 immunoreactivity, occupied a thin layer just beneath the epithelium of the tracheal mucosa (Fig. 1A) . In rats infected with M. pulmonis, the mucosa became progressively thicker and much more densely populated with OX6-positive cells over the 4-week period of the study (Figs. 1B and C). Mucosal thickness increased from about 50 lm in pathogen-free rats to 200 lm at 1 week after infection, and 500 lm at 4 weeks after infection.
