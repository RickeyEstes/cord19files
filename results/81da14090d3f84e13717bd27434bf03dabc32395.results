On the basis of morphology eight distinct viruses or virus-like particles, excluding canine parvovirus, were identified in the dog faeces. Three faecal samples contained characteristic coronavirus particles (Fig. 1) . These particles varied in size from 155 nm to 210 nm, and averaged 150 nm along their greatest dimension. The virus particles were pleomorphic being round, oval or pear shaped. The spikes were club shaped and did not always surround the entire virion. The length of the spikes generally ranged from 19 to 22 nm, although on some particles they were as short as 17 nm. One of these specimens also contained parvovirus. None of the three faecal samples was diarrhoeic, although one of the stools was soft. CVLP resembling those observed by Schnagl and Holmes ( 1978) were observed in two samples (Fig. 2) . These particles were very pleomorphic and ranged in size from 170 to 555 nm. The spike lengths for the particles in the two samples varied, one measuring 28 nm and the other averaging 23 nm. Neither of these samples was diarrhoeic. CVLP with shorter fringes measuring approximately 11 nm were identified in two faecal samples (Fig. 3) . The spikes were not attached as sparsely as those associated with characteristic coronavirus particles, but they were not as closely attached to one another as the Both of these samples were diarrhoeic. Rotavirus-like particles were observed in one faecal sample (Fig. 4) . The particles observed were characteristic of single-shelled rotavirus particles and measured approximately 74 nm in diameter. This sample also contained parvovirus and was not diarrhoeic. Papovavirus-like particles were observed in one sample and measured approximately 47 nm in diameter (Fig. 5) . These particles were not associated with diarrhoea. Pleomorphic particles, with fringes 8 to 11 nm, that resembled torovirus particles were observed in one sample (Fig. 6) . The particles varied in size from about 45 nm to 140 nm and averaged 85 nm in diameter. The spikes were positioned closely to one another. Particles resembling members of the family Picomaviridae were observed in four samples. In three of these samples the particles measured about 27 nm in diameter, while in the fourth sample the particles were larger at about 30 nm in diameter. The particles in the first three samples had featureless surfaces and both intact and 'empty' virions were observed (Fig. 7) . The particles in the fourth sample were generally 'empty' and ten capsomeres could be counted around the edge of the particle (Fig. 8 ) Some smaller virus-like particles were detected in this sample also. These particles were about 22 nm in diameter and resembled parvoviruses, although a positive HA titre was not observed. Three of these samples were from diarrhoeic dogs. In two cases the diarrhoeic dogs were less than nine weeks old. Two previously undescribed virus-like particles were observed in one sample. These particles were circular and had 12 projections extending from their surface (Fig. 9 ). They measured approximately 27 nm in diameter, including the projections. This sample was normal and parvovirus and picomavirus-like particles were present also. Table 1 records the details of the dogs from which viruses or virus-like particles were identified. Coronaviruses were not isolated in either FK or MDCK cells.
