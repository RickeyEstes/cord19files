Ebola virus sGP is C-mannosylated sGP peptide mapping by MALDI MS and HPLC-MALDI MS was performed as previously described following trypsin digestion (Falzarano et al., 2006) . Two unmodified tryptic pep-tides containing amino acids 288 to 291 (WAFW) were found: T26 (VNPEIDTTIGEWAFWETK) and T26 + T27 (VNPEIDT-TIGEWAFWETKK) (Fig. 1A) . The presence of a peptide with a missed cleavage is typical when there are two adjacent cut sites (KK) and in this case results in two peaks separated by ∼ 128.095 Da. Both peptides showed + 162 Da adducts, consistent with the mass of a hexose residue (162.053 Da, Delta Mass-a database of protein post-translational modifications, http://www.abrf.org/index.cfm/dm.home). A comparison of the relative intensities of the non-modified peptides and their respective + 162 Da adducts (Fig. 1A) suggested that approximately 60% of the peptides were modified. MALDI MS analysis allowed all four of the fragments to be observed simultaneously, while HPLC-MALDI MS analysis introduces an additional retention time shift for the +162 Da modified species-they elute ∼ 1 min earlier under the chromatographic conditions used. This finding is consistent with the addition of a hydrophilic sugar moiety to a hydrophobic Trp residue. The identification of this post-translational modification was further supported by the presence of the recognition sequence, W-x-x-W, for Cmannosylation at amino acid position 288 to 291 (W-A-F-W) of sGP, which was part of both peptides. Final confirmation of W 288 C-mannosylation was obtained during low-energy CID MS/MS analysis of the modified peptides. Fig. 1C shows MS/MS spectrum of the + 162 Da adducts of the T26 (VNPEIDTTIGEWAFWETK) peptide (MH+ 2298) . A complete series of y ions (y 2 to y 6 ) confirms that W 291 is unmodified, while all y ions starting at y 7 have a mass increase of 162 Da. This is a strong indication that a mannose residue is attached to W 288 . Furthermore, the characteristic 120 Da loss (Furmanek and Hofsteenge, 2000) that occurs during CID of mannosylated peptides was also observed (Fig. 1C) . MS/MS analysis of the second mannosylated peptide T26 + T27 (VNPEIDTTIGEWAFWETKK) (MH+ 2426) showed similar results. To ensure that this modification was not unique to the specific cell line used, sGP was also purified from transfected Vero E6 and Huh7 cell lines. MALDI MS revealed a similar spectra to that of the 293T cell derived sGP with modified peptides indicating the presence of a mannose residue (Figs. 2A, B) . This is not unexpected as others have reported that C-mannosylation occurs in multiple tissue types from diverse species (Krieg et al., 1997; Doucey et al., 1998) . In addition, sGP purified from ZEBOV-infected Vero cells was shown to contain the Cmannosylated peptide T26 following HPLC-MALDI MS (Fig.   2C ), but in contrast to the transfected cell lines, only Cmannosylated peptides were detected. To confirm this result, the peak corresponding to C-mannosylated T26 was selected for MS/MS which yielded results identical to Fig. 1C (data not shown).
