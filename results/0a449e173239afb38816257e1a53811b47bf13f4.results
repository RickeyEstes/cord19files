Changes in the number of subjects with clinically relevant symptoms over time are shown in Table 1 . The PHQ-9 scores indicated that 26.92% (T1), 17.31% (T2) of subjects had clinically relevant depressive symptoms. In addition, 48.08% (T1), 32.69% (T2) had clinically relevant chronic fatigue according to their FSS scores. In terms of the IES-R assessment, 42.31% (T1), 26.92% (T2) had scores above the cut-off point for PTSD. Table 2 shows the correlations among the variables of interest included in the hypothetical model. All correlations across the variables of interest were significant. FSS (T1) scores were positively correlated with scores on the PHQ-9 (T1, T2) and the IES-R (T2). Mean scores of all of the scales were lower at T2 than at T1. The mean FSS score changed significantly from 3.50 (SD=1.88) to 2.78 (SD=1.89), and that of the IES-R decreased significantly from 25.83 (SD=20.05) to 19 .29 (SD=21.03). The mean score of the PHQ-9 decreased from 6.50 (SD=5.69) to 5.42 (SD=5.71) but we could not find significance. The serial multiple-mediation model, which included T1 FSS, T1 PHQ-9, and T2 PHQ-9, accounted for 34.19% of the Moreover, bootstrap analyses revealed that the positive indirect effects of T1 FSS on T2 IES-R through T1 PHQ-9 and T2 PHQ-9 were significant (B=2.1601, SE=1.3268, 95% confidence interval=0.4250-6.1307) ( Table 3) . These results indicate that both T1 PHQ and T2 PHQ-9 fully mediated the effects of T1 FSS on T2 IES-R (Figure 1 ), which suggests that both T1 PHQ and T2 PHQ-9 eliminated the direct effects of T1 FSS on T2 IES-R.
