The LCMV matrix protein is reversibly phosphorylated The matrix protein plays a multifactorial role in the arenavirus life cycle yet little is known regarding how its various functions are regulated. Given the importance of phosphorylation for regulating the functionality of matrix proteins of other virus families [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] , we were interested in whether LCMV's matrix protein might also be phosphorylated. LCMV strain Armstrong 53b particles grown in Vero E6 cells were purified via sucrose-banding ( Fig 1A) and subjected to mass spectrometry. This analysis revealed a tyrosine phosphorylation site near the C-terminus of the LCMV Z protein at position 88 (Y88) (Fig 1B and S1 Fig) , which lies within LCMV Z's PPPY late domain (Fig 1C) . Both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides containing this residue were observed at a ratio of 1 to 11, respectively, which suggests that~10% of the total Z protein in this virion preparation is phosphorylated ( Fig  1B and S1C Fig) . Because the virion preparation contained a mixture of both standard infectious virus and DI particles, we were not able to determine whether the phosphorylated Z was derived from standard particles, DI particles, and/or both types of particles. To confirm the phosphorylation site, plasmids encoding either WT Z or a phenylalanine mutant (Y88F) that cannot be phosphorylated were transfected into HEK293T cells and 2 days later the cells were treated with either water or the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, hydrogen peroxide. WT Z and Y88F Z were affinity purified and probed with a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody. The phosphotyrosine signal detected from WT Z was greatly enhanced following inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases (Fig 1D) . Substitution of tyrosine 88 with phenylalanine, to prevent phosphorylation, resulted in a complete loss of detectable phosphotyrosine signal in both settings indicating that Y88 may be the only tyrosine of the 3 encoded in LCMV Z that is phosphorylated (Fig 1D) by endogenous kinases in these cells. To determine whether LCMV Z is tyrosine phosphorylated in the context of a relevant rodent cell line, we infected murine L929 cells with a rLCMV that encodes Z with a C-terminal streptavidin binding peptide (SBP) tag. Two days later, cells were either treated with hydrogen peroxide or not and Z was affinity purified from cell lysates for western blot analysis. As shown in Fig 1E, a phosphotyrosine signal was clearly detectable from Z and was enhanced following treatment with hydrogen peroxide.
