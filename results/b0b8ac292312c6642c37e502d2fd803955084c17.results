Farms were enrolled in the program as agreement to participate (by veterinarians and producers) was obtained; thus, the program started in June 2009 and ended in December 2011. The 33 producers who agreed to participate were located throughout the midwestern United States: 17 farms in Iowa, 4 in Illinois, 8 in Indiana, and 4 in Minnesota. Each of the 33 farms housed 1,000-13,000 pigs. One group of 7 farms in Iowa withdrew from the program in August 2009 after the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus-associated crisis in the swine industry.
