An intuitive understanding of the power of similarity search methods can be provided by the genetic distance at which they can detect homologs. However, the genetic distances between viral proteins often cannot be easily established by standard phylogenetic analyses, owing to their high rate of evolution (particularly in RNA viruses). Instead, we relied on the precomputed viral taxonomy as a proxy for genetic distances, since recent studies suggest that viral taxonomy reflects sequence-based phylogeny well (46-48) (despite being based on additional factors such as antigenicity). We compiled a data set of 351 proteins from positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that BLAST classifies as genus restricted by adapting a previously published data set identified as ORFans on the basis of BLAST searches (3) (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Profile-profile methods find more distant homologs of 25% of the proteins classified as genus restricted by BLAST. We first ran several automated sequence similarity search programs on this data set and compared the taxonomic depths at which they detected homologs. For a given program, a protein was deemed homologous to the query if the program reported a statistically significant sequence similarity between them, i.e., with an E value smaller than the cutoff of 10 Ϫ3 . The programs we compared included the widely used BLAST and PSI-BLAST programs and the more recent profile-profile comparison methods HHpred (14) and HHblits (15) . If the proteins in the data set were truly genus restricted, then no algorithm would detect homologs in other genera. This is not what we observed. Table 1 and Fig. 1 show that all of the methods, aside from BLAST, detect homologs in other genera for at least some of the proteins in the data set. For example, HHpred detected distant homologs (i.e., in more than one genus) for about 20% of the sequences and very distant homologs (i.e., in more than one family) for about 14% of the sequences. Methods based on profile-profile comparison, i.e., HHpred and HHblits, detected many more distant homologs than PSI-BLAST ( Fig. 1 and Table  1 ). Among these methods, HHpred found about as many distant homologs as HHblits but markedly more very distant homologs. This is probably due to the fact that contrary to HHblits, HHpred relies on a database of protein profiles built with human supervision (PFAM); in particular, PFAM clans often incorporate other information than merely sequence data, such as 3D structure or function (24) . When combining results from PSI-BLAST, HHblits, and HHpred (right side of Fig. 1 ), in total, Ͼ25% of the 89 proteins in the data set had distant homologs and Ͼ14% had very distant homologs. Thus, many of the proteins characterized as genus restricted by BLAST and thought to be ORFans (3) are actually members of protein families with a wide taxonomic distribution. For the proteins for which homologs were detected in more than one genus by at least one program and their taxonomic distribution according to each method, see Table S2 in the supplemental material. To corroborate these results, we examined indepth 18 proteins (one-fifth) selected at random from among the 89 proteins found to have distant homologs (see Materials and Methods). We found that all were correct (not shown). We also ran the same calculations with a more stringent E value cutoff (10 Ϫ5 ) and obtained qualitatively similar results (not shown), confirming that they are not an artifact due to the detection of false positives. Manual analysis using biological context reveals markedly more distant homologs than automated methods. Even the profile-profile methods described above could not find distant homologs of 75% of the proteins in the data set with the standard significance cutoff (E ϭ 10 Ϫ3 ). However, more distant homologs can sometimes be detected by examining subsignificant hits (i.e., those with E values of Ͼ10 Ϫ3 ) and using "extrinsic" or "contextual" sequence-based information that goes beyond simple sequence similarity (such as taxonomy, gene order, or domain organization) (25) . We randomly selected 10 such proteins (Table 2) and analyzed them in depth manually (see Materials and Methods). This allowed the detection of more homologs in half of the cases (5 out of 10) listed in the top half of Table 2 (compare columns 4 and 5). The evidence supporting homology is described in the last column of Table 2 . Of these five proteins, three have homologs in more than one genus, including two that have homologs in more than one family. The 6K2 protein of Cucumber vein yellowing virus is homologous to the 6K2 proteins of several genera in the Potyviridae family ( Table 2 ). The coat protein of Strawberry latent ringspot virus and that of Mushroom bacilliform virus are each predicted to have a jellyroll fold (49) and to have homologs in Ͼ40 families (Table 2) . Experiments confirmed that they function as a capsid (50, 51) . Intriguingly, four of the five other genus-restricted proteins belong to the same family, Closteroviridae. The fact that this family The total for each row can be Ͼ100% because "beyond genus level" includes "beyond family level." Likewise, the total proportion of the different algorithms in each column can be greater than the value of the cell "all methods combined" because for some proteins, distant homologs were detected by several algorithms. Percentages were calculated from a total of 351 sequences. Table 1 , columns 2 and 3. contains numerous proteins that lack identifiable orthologs has been noted previously (53) . In summary, 3 of 10 proteins that all of the automated methods found to be genus restricted actually have distant homologs detectable by manual sequence analysis. This value cannot be simply extrapolated to the whole data set because of the small size of the subset examined. Nevertheless, it is clear that numerous proteins classified as genus restricted by BLAST and initially thought to be ORFans (3) actually have more distant homologs. Therefore, methods relying on profile-profile comparison should be used in addition to BLAST and PSI-BLAST to annotate viral genomes. Case study: in-depth analysis of the genome of CBPV. We applied a combination of automated profile-profile methods and manual examination of subsignificant hits to analyze the genome of a phylogenetically isolated virus, CBPV (proposed genus, Chroparavirus [P. Blanchard, personal communication]), that induces paralysis in the honeybee Apis mellifera (20) . The first genome segment (RNA1) encodes three ORFs (all accession numbers are in Table 3 ). ORF1 and ORF3 are thought to give rise to a fusion protein, ORF1-ORF3, by a frameshift (20) . ORF2 overlaps ORF1; its expression is unproven. PSI-BLAST detected significant similarity between ORF3 and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) but could detect no homolog of ORF1 or ORF2 (20) . The second genome segment (RNA2) of CBPV contains three ORFs (ORF1 to ORF3) for which PSI-BLAST could detect no homolog either (20) . ORF1 of CBPV RNA1 is homologous to the Alphavirus MTase-GTase. HHpred reported a statistically significant hit (E ϭ 4.6 ϫ 10 Ϫ4 ) between aa 132 to 325 of RNA1 ORF1 and the first 231 aa of the PFAM family Vmethyltransf, corresponding to the MTase-GTase of the Alphavirus supergroup (54) . Two recently discovered viruses infecting bees have an organization similar to that of CBPV, Lake Sinai virus 1 and Lake Sinai virus 2 (55) . Their first genome segment is also composed of an ORF1 with significant similarity to that of CBPV, followed by an ORF encoding the RdRP. We aligned the ORF1 of CBPV and those of the Lake Sinai viruses and submitted the alignment to HHpred. HHpred reported a longer match between this alignment (corresponding to aa 131 to 338 of CBPV) and almost the entire Vmethyltransf domain, albeit with a lower E value (E ϭ 0.002), marginally under the threshold of significance. The strictly conserved histidine of the MTase-GTase of the Alphavirus superfamily (54) is also conserved in the ORF1 of the bee viruses (aa 158 in CBPV ORF1). In addition, the predicted secondary-structure elements of the putative MTase-GTase of CBPV matched that of the Alphavirus supergroup (not shown). Thus, we conclude that the aa 131 to 338 region of CBPV ORF1 contains a domain homologous to the MTase-GTase of the Alphavirus superfamily. This prediction is coherent with the facts that the genome of CBPV is capped (20) and that the MTase-GTase is generally found at the N terminus of the viral replicase (54) . Finally, we could find no homolog of RNA1 ORF2.
