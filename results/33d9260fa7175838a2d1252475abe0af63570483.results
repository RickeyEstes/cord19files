YFV antigens were detected by IHC in the kidney, but not in the liver, spleen, heart or lung. Histopathologic findings in the liver included microvesicular steatosis and Councilman bodies, which are seen in wild-type YF. Panacinar necrosis, presumed secondary to DIC and repeated bouts of hypotension, predominated over the classic finding of midzonal necrosis. Tissue staining revealed abundant colonies of Gram-positive and Gram-variable cocci in the inflammatory infiltrate of the lung. IHC staining identified the colonies as S. aureus. 17D vaccine strain RNA was amplified from plasma and serum samples by RT-PCR. The estimated viral titer was 61,000 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL on post-vaccination day 5, rising to a peak of 106,500 PFU/mL the following day ( Table 2 ). Healthy vaccinated people rarely have greater than 100 PFU/mL [2] . Viremia dropped 8 days after vaccination with the development of YF virus-specific neutralizing and IgM antibody. Viral RNA was thereafter detected at low levels until the day of death. There were elevated levels of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IFN‚ê•, Table 2 Serum levels of viremia, antibody and selected cytokines Neut Ab: neutralizing antibody; IgM: immunoglobulin M; IFN: interferon; TNF: tumor necrosis factor; IL: interleukin; RANTES: regulated on activation normally T cell expressed and secreted; GM-CSF: granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor; MCP: monocyte chemotactic protein; MIP: macrophage inflammatory protein; IP: interferon-delta-inducible protein; ND: not determined. Cytokine levels are expressed as high, low or baseline compared to four healthy recipients of yellow fever vaccine. IL-6, RANTES, GM-CSF, IL-1a, IL-3, IL-7 and IP-10, during the clinical course but no specific cytokine abnormality that would explain her illness. The consensus sequence of viral RNA obtained 5 days post-vaccination showed 100% nucleotide identity to the utilized vaccine lot. These sequences differed from a reference strain of 17D-204 at A1431C (Asn to Thr), C5362T (silent), A5641G (silent), T7496C (silent), A10,243G (silent) and A10,722G (3 non-coding). Identical changes at positions 5641, 10,243 and 10,722, but not at 1431, 5362, and 7496, were detected in viral RNA from a recent fatal case in Spain [8] . The Spanish isolate also had a unique silent mutation at 6418. Comparison of the patient's OAS1 gene promoter and exons 1, 2, 4, and 5 sequences with the GenBank human genome assemblies NT 009775 or NW 925395 revealed no differences. However, the minor allele was detected at three previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the OAS1 gene: GG-homozygous for SNP rs3741981 in exon 3 (Gly162Ser); GG-homozygous for SNP rs10774671 in intron 5 (splicing acceptor site); and AA-homozygous for the SNP rs11352835 A/-indel in 3 terminal exon. The frequency of SNP rs3741981 GGhomozygotes varies from 0.133 in Europeans to 0.767 in Sub-Saharan Africans. 1 The frequency of SNP rs10774671 GG-homozygotes is 0.195, 1 and of SNP rs11352835 AAhomozygotes is 0.111. 2 No variations in the sequences of the regulatory elements of the OAS2 gene promoter were observed, but there was a single variation within the OAS2 exons; the patient was AA-homozygous for SNP rs15895, which causes a premature stop-codon in exon 11. The frequency of AAhomozygotes varies from 0.00 in African-Americans to 0.208 in Caucasians. 1 The patient was homozygous for the minor allele at one of four SNPs [CC of rs12992188 (frequency 0.16) 2 ] in the promoter region and for one of five SNPs in exon 2 [5 NCR;TT of rs2254958 (frequency 0.217) 1 ] and was heterozygous at SNPs: rs4648174 (intron 4), rs2307483 (intron 6) and rs2307469 (silent, exon 15). No mutations were detected in either the promoter or exons of the toll-like receptor 3 gene. She was homozygous wild-type for the SNPs analyzed in the CCR5 gene, CCR5 promoter, RANTES promoter and DC-SIGN gene [16] . Her DC-SIGNR gene was heterozygous for the number of repeats in exon 4 (6/5) [17] .
