Over the pre-implementation study period (pre-implementation period), 321 nasopharyngeal specimens with a request for respiratory testing were received. Of these, 121 (37.7%) were excluded from the study (Fig. 1) . During the postimplementation study period (post-implementation period), 211 patient specimens were received and 87 (41.2%) of these were excluded. Thus, for the final analysis, 200 patients were included in the pre-implementation group and 124 were included in the post-implementation group. Both groups were similar across a range of baseline characteristics that are presented in Table 1 .
