In order to search for the immunogenic NP peptide sequence, nine potential peptides were predicted using SYFPEITHI software. Various assays were used to determine the immunogenicity of the peptides and the desirable ones (i.e., those with both the highest binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 positive cells and the ability to stimulate human CD8+ T cells) were selected for further in vivo experimentation. In order to determine their binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 positive cells, the peptides were synthesized and a T2-cell binding assay was performed. T2 cells normally express unstable HLA molecules on the cell surface and therefore if a peptide is able to fit into the peptidebinding groove of an HLA molecule, it will form a more stable structural complex with the HLA molecule in the presence of b 2 -microglobulin. This complex can be detected with an anti-human HLA-A2 antibody via flow cytometry. In our assay, a flu peptide (GILGFVFTL), which is an HLA-A*0201 epitope, was used as a positive control for the experiment. The results indicate that the NP373 (AMDSNT-LEL), NP189 (MVMELIRMI), and NP458 (FQGRGVFEL) showed the highest scores in the T2-cell binding assay (Fig. 1) . The potential of the nine peptides in stimulating the human CD8+ T cells was also determined. Two groups of CD8+ T cells isolated from PBMC of two healthy donors, respectively, were primed with autologous mature NP-loaded DC three times. Intracellular cytokine staining was performed to detect the release of IFN-c from the CD8+ T cells, and the peptide-loaded T2 cells were used as the target cells. NP once processed by DC, will combine with the HLA molecules and eventually become presented on the cell surface for the priming of the CD8+ T cells. The primed CD8+ T cells could therefore recognize the peptide-MHC complex on the T2 cells if the target peptides are processed and presented on the DC surface. The results from intracellular cytokine staining showed that the highest number of CD8+ IFN-c-secreting T cells was produced after the stimulation with the NP189 (MVME-LIRMI), NP373 (AMDSNTLEL), and NP458 (FQGRGVFEL) peptides, and the lowest number of the stimulated T cells was observed after stimulation with the NP158 (GMDPRMCSL) peptide. The N160 (LQLPQGTTL) peptideloaded T2 cells used as a negative control did not show any significant changes (Fig. 2) [2] . From the results of the two assays, we selected four target peptides, NP158 (GMD-PRMCSL), NP189 (MVMELIRMI), NP373 (AMDSNTLEL), and NP458 (FQGRGVFEL) for animal experimentation. Based on our findings, three of the peptides showed the highest binding affinity to the HLA-A2 molecules and they were able to activate the highest number of CD8+ T cells. Since NP158 (GMDPR-MCSL) exhibited a comparatively low ability to stimulate T cells against the peptide-loaded T2 cells and induced only a small amount of the IFN-c release, it was included in the sample peptides as a control for checking the consistency of the results previously shown by the in vitro T-cell stimulation experiment. An animal experiment was performed to test the immunogenicity of the target peptides in vivo. DNA corresponding to the target peptides was cloned into the HHD gene to produce a DNA vaccine candidate containing the peptide-b 2 -microglobulin-MHC class-I heavy chain complex that could be expressed on the cell surface and trigger the immune system. Mice received a total of three administrations and were sacrificed 1 week after the last injection. Splenocytes were collected for the cytotoxicity and ELISPOT assays. Cytotoxicity was measured by the amount of TDA released from the target cells. The target cells (T2 cells) were loaded with the target peptides. Therefore, the peptide-loaded T2 cells would be killed if the corresponding peptides were immunogenic to the mice. The results from the cytotoxicity assay showed that the highest percentage of cytotoxic response was triggered in mice immunized with plasmids encoding NP373 and NP458, and the effect was similar to that produced by the positive control (N220). During an 1 h incubation period, NP373 exhibited a 14% and 10% killing efficiency with the effector cell-to-target cell ratios of 50:1 and 10:1, respectively, and NP458 exhibited a 13% and 9% killing efficiency with the effector cell-to-target cell ratios of 50:1 and 10:1, respectively. However, the killing efficiency of T cells triggered by the NP189 was comparatively low (7%) with the effector cellto-target cell ratios of 50:1. The result produced by NP158 was significantly lower, with only a 3.7% killing efficiency at an effector cell-totarget cell ratio of 50:1 (Fig. 3 ). An ELISPOTassay was used to determine the splenocyte recognition of the corresponding peptides via IFN-c release after animal immunization. The largest number of splenocytes (appeared as spots) was produced in mice after immunization with NP373 and NP458 containing the SCT-DNA constructs (79 and 72 spots, respectively). In contrast, only 14 and 4 spots were observed in animals immunized with NP189 and NP158 containing the SCT-DNA constructs, respectively. The results were very similar to the negative control (5 spots only). The immunogenicity triggered by NP189 in mice was comparatively low when compared with the results of the T2-cell binding assay and the intracellular cytokine staining. Nonetheless, the results indicate that the immunogenicity of NP373 and NP458 was more than 18 times higher than that induced by NP158 (Fig. 4) . The prediction process was repeated and the prediction score indicated that NP373 and NP485 may be able to bind to a variety of other HLA types, such as HLA-A1, A11, A24, A26, B7, B8, B14, B15, B27, B37, B38, B39, B40, B44, and B47 (Tab. I).
