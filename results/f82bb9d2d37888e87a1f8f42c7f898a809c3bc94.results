The mutation of the LEW/Ztm-ci2 rat was traced to a base substitution in exon 56 of Myo15 In a previous study a genome-wide scan of a (LEW/ Ztm-ci26BN/Ztm) F16LEW/Ztm-ci2 backcross population demonstrated a strong association of the circling 2 phenotype with a region localized centrally in RNO10. Rat BAC clones were used to create a physical map of this region of interest. Two candidate genes, Myo15 and Kcnj12, were selected based on their genomic localization and involvement in a similar pathology in human and mouse [26] . To identify the mutation we resequenced exons of both genes using PCR and conventional dideoxy sequencing. Two nonreference alleles of Myo15 were identified by comparing sequences of the mutated rat strain LEW/Ztm-ci2 and its co-isogenic background strain LEW/Ztm. The detected base substitution from T to C at position 43612 in exon 56 leads to an amino acid change from leucine to proline (L3157P) within the carboxyterminal MyTH4 (myosin tail homology-4) domain of the protein (Fig. 1) . The leucine residue at position 3157 is conserved throughout the vertebrate lineage, according to MultiZ alignments in the UCSC Genome Browser (http://ucsc.genome.gov). The PolyPhen program predicted this amino acid change to be ''possibly damaging'' to protein function. Resequencing of Kcnj12 revealed no additional mutation.
