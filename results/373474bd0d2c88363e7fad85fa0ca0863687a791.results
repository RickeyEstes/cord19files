Unadjusted and adjusted disease-specifi c completeness proportions for 2000-2006 with 95% CIs and UIs, respectively, are summarized in the Table. The adjusted disease-specifi c, completeness proportions ranged from 0% to 82.0%, and almost all diseases (49/53) had completeness proportions <50%. Eleven diseases accounted for 90% of disease reporting: salmonellosis, tuberculosis, meningococcal disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, campylobacteriosis, shigellosis, acute hepatitis A, pneumococcal meningitis, legionellosis, malaria, and Haemophilus infl uenzae invasive disease. Some unexpected diseases had cases identifi ed with an ICD-9-CM code; for example, anthrax had 14 cases identifi ed, paralytic polio had 32 cases identifi ed, human rabies had 12 cases identifi ed, and smallpox had 9 cases identifi ed. The most dramatic adjustments in the unadjusted to adjusted point estimates were noted for staphylococcal foodborne disease, and for foodborne diseases caused by Vibrio vulnifi cus and other Vibrio spp., with an ≈80% change in point estimate for the latter. However, wide UIs refl ect the imprecision in these estimates. Figure 1 displays the overall reporting proportions by year for the 2 periods, 1995-1997, when only physicians were required to report most diseases, and 2000-2006, when laboratories and physicians were required to report. Reporting increased signifi cantly in the second period, but was still low overall; the linear trend line slope was ≈0 and the intercept was 10.2%. Figure 2 The completeness proportions ranged from 1.8% to 29.7% with an overall median proportion of 8.0%. The covariates that described whether or not each health care system designated persons to report had no effect on a health care system's reporting proportion. The sensitivity analysis of the τ 2 values showed that the point estimates and UIs were relatively insensitive to dramatic changes in τ 2 ; for example, for meningococcal meningitis with a low τ 2 , the reporting proportion was estimated as 21% (95% UI 16%-28%), with a medium τ 2 , 22% (95% UI 16%-28%); and with a high τ 2 , 22% (95% UI 16%-29%), and the sensitivity analyses examining the use of prior covariates were shown only to have effects on the reporting proportion and 95% UI for diseases with sparse data; for example, cholera with all prior covariates 22% (95% UI 3%-74%), no prior covariates 10% (95% UI 1%-51%), time covariate alone 50% (95% UI 10%-89%).
