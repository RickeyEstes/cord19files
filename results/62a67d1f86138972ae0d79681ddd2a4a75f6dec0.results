A total of 726 children, aged 3 mo to 16 y, were enrolled in this study from July 1, 2008, until November 30, 2011 (Figures 1 and  2 ). In the asymptomatic group, 405 children were enrolled. Enrollment for this group started in January 2009. In the symptomatic group, 321 children were enrolled. With respect to age, sex, and time of enrollment of study participants, there were no differences between the group of children for whom consent was given (enrolled in the study) and the group of children for whom consent was not given (Table S1) . We found that the prevalence of M. pneumoniae by real-time PCR did not differ significantly (p = 0.11) between the asymptomatic group (21.2%, 95% CI 17.2%-25.2%, n = 85) and the symptomatic group (16.2%, 95% CI 12.2%-20.2%, n = 51). A significant difference between the groups was also not found by culture: four (1.0%, 95% CI 0.03%-1.97%) of the asymptomatic children and five (1.6%, 95% CI 0.23%-2.97%) of the symptomatic children were M. pneumoniae-positive (p = 0.52). In the symptomatic group, the prevalence of M. pneumoniae by real-time PCR did not differ significantly (p = 0.85) between the children with a lower RTI (15.6%, 95% CI 11.6%-19.6%, n = 10) and the children with an upper RTI (15.9%, 95% CI 11.9%-19.9%, n = 41). In the asymptomatic group, multiple logistic regression analysis showed that season and year of enrollment were significantly related to prevalence of M. pneumoniae (Tables 2 and S2 ). In the symptomatic group, we found the presence of M. pneumoniae to be positively associated with enrollment in 2010 and 2011 (Table S3) . As shown in Table 3 , none of the variables were independently related to the prevalence of M. pneumoniae. The presence of M. pneumoniae was not significantly associated with age or asthma-like symptoms (Tables 2 and 3 ). The two subtypes of M. pneumoniae were equally distributed between the two groups (Table S4 ). A similar distribution of M. pneumoniae DNA loads was observed among the asymptomatic and symptomatic children ( Figure 3A and 3B). We did not find a significant correlation between bacterial load in nasopharyngeal and pharyngeal samples ( Figure 3C ). The distribution of bacterial loads was different among children with a lower RTI and children with an upper RTI ( Figure 3D and 3E) . However, both very high and very low bacterial loads were detected in both subgroups. The study was not powered to perform a statistical subgroup analysis for this variable. To investigate how long M. pneumoniae can persist in the respiratory tract of children, a longitudinal follow-up study was performed among children who tested positive for M. pneumoniae by PCR. In this study, 43 (68%) of the 63 children who were eligible for inclusion participated in the follow-up study. Of these 43 children, 21 children originated from the asymptomatic group, and 22 from the symptomatic group. The most common reason given for declining to participate in the follow-up study was distance from home to the study site (10/20; 50%). Fifteen of the 21 (71%) asymptomatic children and 19 of the 22 (86%) symptomatic children in this longitudinal follow-up study tested negative after 1 mo. Six of the asymptomatic children also tested positive at 2 mo, and two children also tested positive at 3 mo. Three of the symptomatic children tested positive at 2 mo, and none tested positive at 3 mo (Figure 4 ). To confirm their negative status, children were tested an additional time after becoming negative. We found that the prevalence of a positive ELISA for anti-M. pneumoniae IgM antibodies was not significantly different in the asymptomatic group (12.6%, 95% CI 9.4%-15.8%, n = 43) and the symptomatic group (9.2%, 95% CI 6.0%-12.4%, n = 26) (p = 0.23). The prevalence of a positive ELISA for anti-M. pneumoniae IgG antibodies differed significantly (p,0.001) between the asymptomatic group (25.1%, 95% CI 20.9%-29.3%, n = 85) and the symptomatic group (14.2%, 95% CI 10.4%-18.0%, n = 40). However, when adjusted for age, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of anti-M. pneumoniae antibodies between the two groups. The prevalence of a positive ELISA for anti-M. pneumoniae IgM and IgG was low among children below the age of 5 y (IgM, 7.3%, 95% CI 3.5%-11.1%; IgG, 8.3%, 95% CI 4.3%-12.3%) in the asymptomatic group versus in the symptomatic group (IgM, 6.7%, 95% CI 0.0%-13.4%; IgG, 5.0%, 95% CI 0.0%-5.9%), and much higher among children above the age of 5 y (IgM, 20.4%, 95% CI 14.1%-26.7%, and IgG, 50.7%, 95% CI 42.8%-58.5%, in the asymptomatic group; IgM, 11.9%, 95% CI 7.7%-16.1%, and IgG, 47.6%, 95% CI 41.1%-54.1%, in the symptomatic group). The median levels of IgM and IgG antibodies did not differ significantly between the two groups ( Figures 5A and 5B) . The prevalence of a positive ELISA for anti-M. pneumoniae IgA antibodies was very low in both groups (2.0%, 95% CI 0.6%-3.4%, versus 0.4%, 95% CI 0.0%-1.1%), and none of the children below the age of 5 y tested positive for anti-M. pneumoniae IgA. The serological data did not correspond significantly with the PCR results ( Figure 5C and 5D; Table 4 ). Interestingly, a higher percentage of asymptomatic PCR-positive children tested positive for IgG compared to symptomatic PCR-positive children ( Table 4 ; 32% versus 15%). However, this difference was not found to be statistically significant when adjusted for age. Because an immunoglobulin class switch from IgM to IgG is generally accepted as evidence of a recent M. pneumoniae infection, a second serum sample was collected from 233 (72.6%) of the symptomatic children. From this group, 26 (11.2%) children developed an immunoglobulin class switch. The agreement between an immunoglobulin class switch and a positive PCR result was poor (Kappa = 0.10) ( Table 4 ). Besides age, we did not find any determinants of an immunoglobulin class switch or a single positive test for IgM, IgG, or IgA. Bacterial and viral pathogens do coexist in the respiratory tract, and co-infection may influence severity of disease. Therefore, we determined the presence of four other bacterial respiratory pathogens in all children and the presence of 15 viral respiratory pathogens in a subsample of the children (n = 202). Two or more pathogens were found in 56% (63/112) of the asymptomatic children and in 55.5% (50/90) of the symptomatic children. The prevalence of the four bacterial pathogens is shown in Table 5 . As reported previously, the prevalence of these bacterial species was largely age-dependent [20] . We found a significantly higher prevalence of S. aureus in the asymptomatic group than in the symptomatic group. However, when adjusted for age this difference in prevalence was not significant. An association between the presence of any of these four bacterial species and M. pneumoniae was not detected. Almost all of the viruses screened for were detected in both groups (Table 6 ). We did not perform a statistical analysis to detect differences in the distribution of cycle threshold values since our study was not powered for this purpose. Rhinovirus, bocavirus, and parainfluenzavirus 4 were detected more frequently in asymptomatic children than in symptomatic children. In contrast, influenzaviruses A and B, human metapneumovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were predominantly detected in symptomatic children. The majority of the children (from both groups) tested positive for more than one pathogen ( Figure 6 ). Group-specific combinations of pathogens could not be identified. In addition, none of the viruses were associated with the presence of M. pneumoniae. Because of the limited number of M. pneumoniae-positive children without bacterial and/or viral co-infection, it was not possible to analyze the influence of bacterial and viral co-infection on disease severity.
