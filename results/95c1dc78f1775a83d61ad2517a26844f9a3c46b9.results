EV71 2A protease exhibited strong transcriptional activity in yeast cells EV71 2A protease, when fused with the DNA-binding domain of Gal4, activates the reporter genes in yeast cells ( Figure 1 ). This reaction is quite specific since none of the other proteins we studied at the same time exhibited this activity, including EV 71 3C protein, hepatitis C virus NS5A protein, NS3 protein(data not shown), or ARFP [7] . Truncation of 40 but not 60 amino acids at the N-terminus of EV71 2A protease did not affect its transcriptional activation activity (Figure 1 ). On the other hand, deletion of 20 amino acids at the Cterminus of EV71 2A protease resulted in the loss of transcriptional activity (Figure 1 ).
