Survey forms were returned from 249 HCWs; eight surveys were incomplete, and 30 reported no work-related contacts on the survey date submitted, leaving surveys from 211 HCWs for analysis. Of 2928 participants from the community, 2922 contributed surveys on two days, but only 1028 participants aged from 20 to 64 years had one survey with work-related contacts. Table I shows that, whereas both sexes and all age groups were evenly represented among community-based working adults, HCWs were predominantly female (86.3%) and aged between 20 and 39 years (88.6%).
