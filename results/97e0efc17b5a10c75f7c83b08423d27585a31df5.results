A total of 222 patients with a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 recorded in the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were analyzed. Median age was 62 years (IQR; range from 52 to 69 years), and 48.2% of patients were male. 39.2% of patients were severe at the time of sampling. As of March 12, 2020, 5 patients (2.3%) died. A total of 121 patients (54.5%) required supplemental oxygen at some stage of illness. A total of 111 patients were administrated with high-dose corticosteroid. The number of patients receiving mechanical ventilation and administration of intravenous immunoglobin were 31 (14.0%) and 123 (55.4%), respectively. 194 patients recovered from this infected disease, and 59 severe patients recovered by anti-viral and supported therapy. All patients had convalescent-phase sera for analysis. Of these, 98.6% of patients had anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG detected in sera, and 82.0% had anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgM detected in sera. As shown in figure 1A , IgG was first detected on day 4 of illness, and its peak levels occurred in the fourth week, whereas IgM was first detected on day 3 of illness, and its peak levels occurred in the second week. Median IgG and IgM levels in convalescent-phase sera (within 35 days) for all included patients were compared among severe and nonsevere patients. Higher IgM levels were detected in patients with severe disease compared to those with nonsevere disease at early stage (<14 days), whereas higher IgG levels were detected at late stage (≥21 days) (figure 1B and 1C). We used median as cut-off value to stratify high and levels of IgM and IgG. Interestingly, severe cases were more frequently occurred in patients with low IgM levels (<34.1 AU/mL) than those with high IgM levels (≥3.04 AU/mL) (81.3% versus 40%; p=0.024) ( figure   1D ). Severe cases were more frequently found in patients with high IgG levels (≥116.9 AU/mL), compared to those who with low IgG levels (<116.9 AU/mL) (51.8% versus 32.3%; p=0.008) (figure 1E). Considering NLR is linked to innate immunity, and anti-IgG response is an indicator of acquired immunity, we stratified patients at late stage into four different immune response phenotypes: high NLR and high IgG levels (NLR hi IgG hi ), high NLR and low IgG levels (NLR hi IgG lo ), low NLR and high IgG levels (NLR lo IgG hi ), and low NLR and high IgG levels (NLR lo IgG lo ), according to NLR (cutoff: 3.04) and detected IgG levels (cutoff: 116.9 AU/mL). Severity rates for patients with NLR hi IgG hi , NLR hi IgG lo , NLR lo IgG hi , and NLR lo IgG lo phenotype were 72.3% (34/47), 48.5% (16/33), 33.3% (12/36), and 15.6% (5/32), respectively (p<0.0001) (figure 2A).

As shown in table 1, severe patients had higher proinflammatory cytokines levels including IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10 than nonsevere patients, especially in the NLR hi IgG hi or NLR hi IgG lo phenotype (p<0.05). Furthermore, severe patients with the NLR hi IgG hi or NLR hi IgG lo phenotype had higher proinflammatory cytokines levels including IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10, and decreased CD4+ T cell count, compared to those with the NLR lo IgG lo phenotype (p<0.05). In particular, only IgG and IgM were higher in severe patients with the NLR lo IgG hi phenotype than those in the NLR lo IgG lo phenotype (p<0.05). We also analyzed the treatment and clinical outcome for patients with different combined immune response phenotypes. 2B ). Dead cases only found in population with the NLR hi IgG hi or the NLR hi IgG lo phenotypes ( figure   2C ). However, too few severe cases at early stage had convalescent sera collected to allow separate analysis of anti-IgM response.
