Pteropid Bats Express a Diverse Range of APOBEC3 Gene Products Pteropid A3 gene expression was initially determined by searching for A3 homologues in the P. alecto transcriptome database through a tBLASTn analysis using the human A3 proteins A3A, A3C, and A3H, representing the three zinccoordinating cytosine deaminase motif (Z-domain) subtypes A3Z1, A3Z2, and A3Z3, as search queries. A3 expression was subsequently assessed through analysis of cDNA (complementary DNA) generated from P. alecto spleen tissue, which harbors multiple immune cell types known to express A3 genes in humans (Refsland et al. 2010 ). This analysis revealed 20 distinct A3 mRNA transcripts derived from seven A3Z1 genes, five A3Z2 genes, and a single A3Z3 gene (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). Pairwise comparison of these A3 transcripts (supplementary fig. S1 , Supplementary Material online) reveal a wide range of sequence identities between pteropid A3 genes, indicating considerable diversity among homologs: A3Z1 genes range from 86% to 97% identity, whereas A3Z2 genes range from 54% to 99% identity. In addition to the expected A3Z1, A3Z2, and A3Z3 subtypes, several A3 amino acid sequences contained Z-domains distinct from the canonical domains as defined by a specific combination of key conserved residues (LaRue et al. 2009 ). This group, designated A3Z2B, carried both the A3Z2 domain-specific tryptophan-phenylalanine (WF) residues and the A3Z1 domain-specific arginine-adjacent isoleucine (RI) motif ( fig. 1A ). Of the 20 unique transcripts, 19 harbored a single Z-domain and one contained two Z-domains, an Nterminal A3Z2B domain paired with a C-terminal A3Z3 domain. These results indicate that pteropid bats express a more diverse repertoire of A3 mRNA than reported to date for other mammals ( fig. 1C ).
