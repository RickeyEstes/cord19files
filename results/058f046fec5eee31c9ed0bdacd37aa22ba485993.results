The odds of hospital mortality increased if the MERS-CoV patients were older or female. For example, females were 2.4 times more likely to die compared to males. On the other hand, the odds of death were lower (OR = 0.21) in patients with at least one chronic condition (reference = no chronic diseases). None of these associations, however, were statistically significant (p > 0.05). The only significant association was if patients were admitted to the hospitals with shock or organ failure (OR = 47.9) (reference = pneumonia/ARDS) ( Table 3 ).
