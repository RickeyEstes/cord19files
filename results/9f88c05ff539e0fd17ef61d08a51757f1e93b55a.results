Over the course of the experiment, HF1995 successfully established an infection in the tracheal mucosae of all 15 house finches inoculated, whereas Rlow established an infection in 12 of 15 (80%) inoculated birds ( 2 ϭ 1.5, df ϭ 1, P ϭ 0.22). There was, however, a difference in the timing of the establishment of infection. At 2 days postinfection (dpi), HF1995-inoculated birds were significantly more likely to test positive for infection. M. gallisepticum could be detected in 12 out of the 15 (80%) birds inoculated with HF1995 but in only 6 of the 15 (40%) birds inoculated with Rlow (logistic regression: z ϭ Ϫ2.2, df ϭ 1, P ϭ 0.03). By 7 dpi, however, all the birds that became infected (i.e., 15 HF1995 birds and 12 Rlow birds) tested positive for M. gallisepticum. When considering only the birds that became infected, we found that HF1995infected finches reached higher peak bacterial loads than Rlow-infected finches (Mann-Whitney U test: Wilcoxon test statistic (W) ϭ 170, P Ͻ 0.0001) (Fig. 1 ). The number of days between inoculation and peak bacterial loads, however, did not significantly differ between treatments (Mann-Whitney U test: W ϭ 104, P ϭ 0.43; mean Ϯ standard deviation: Rlow ϭ 9.3 Ϯ 4.6 days, HF1995 ϭ 11.2 Ϯ 6.4 days). By the end of the experiment (56 dpi), all 12 Rlow-infected finches had cleared the infection, whereas 3 of 15 (20%) HF1995-infected birds remained positive for M. gallisepticum ( 2 ϭ 14.2, df ϭ 1, P Ͻ 0.0002). Additionally, Rlow-infected birds cleared the infection significantly faster than HF1995-infected ones (linear model: t ϭ Ϫ4.5, P Ͻ 0.001; mean Ϯ standard deviation: Rlow ϭ 22.8 Ϯ 13.5 days, HF1995 ϭ 41.5 Ϯ 5.3 days). While 14 out of 15 finches (93%) inoculated with HF1995 developed clinical symptoms (i.e., conjunctivitis), only 5 out of 12 (42%) Rlow-infected individuals exhibited conjunctivitis. This difference was significant. Rlow-infected individuals exhibited a significantly lower probability of developing clinical symptoms than those inoculated with HF1995 (logistic regression: z ϭ Ϫ2.5, P ϭ 0.01). Furthermore, when we considered symptomatic birds only, birds that were infected with HF1995 developed significantly more severe conjunctivitis than birds infected with Rlow (Mann-Whitney U test: W ϭ 69, P Ͻ 0.001) (Fig. 2) . Overall, there was a significant quadratic relationship between the production of M. gallisepticum-specific antibodies and time (linear mixed model; time: F 1,53.9 ϭ 35.8, P Ͻ 0.0001; time 2 : F 1,54.5 ϭ 8.2, P Ͻ 0.0001) (Fig. 3) . However, the strength and pattern of this relationship differed significantly between the two treatment groups, leading to a significant treatment-by-time interaction (F 1,53.9 ϭ 8.2, P ϭ 0.045). For example, while HF1995 triggered antibody responses to increase at a rate of 0.06 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) units (EU)/ml between 7 and 14 dpi, Rlow did so at a rate of 0.01 EU/ml over that same period, generating a 130% increase in the amplitude of the response of HF1995-inoculated birds relative to Rlow-inoculated ones (treatment, F 1,58.8 ϭ 18.6, P ϭ 0.022).
