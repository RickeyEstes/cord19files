Peroxynitrite has no effect on SARS-CoV SIN-1, which produces peroxynitrite, was used in conjunction with a superoxide scavenger, MnTBAP, to determine if peroxynitrite was involved in the inhibition of SARS-CoV replication. SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells were treated with different concentrations of SIN-1, and it was observed that no significant inhibition of viral replication occurred. This suggested that SIN-1 administration had no effect on the replication cycle of SARS-CoV. Next, we treated the SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells with different concentrations of MnTBAP together with SIN-1. MnTBAP removes the superoxide, resulting in a reduction in the amount of peroxynitrite and an increase in the amount of free NO. The results in Fig. 1B clearly demonstrate that with increasing amount of MnTBAP in presence of SIN-1 (400 μM), there is an inhibition in the production of progeny virus in a concentration-dependent manner. Although a slight reduction on the production of progeny virus was observed when the cells were treated with the highest concentration of MnTBAP used in this study (800 μM, Fig. 1C ), the reduction of virus replication in cells treated with both SIN-1 and MnTBAP is significantly higher than those treated with MnTBAP alone. This slight reduction might be explained by the possibility that the use of the superoxide scavenger would have resulted in an increase in intracellular free NO, which could then, directly or through an intermediary compound, exert an inhibitory effect.
