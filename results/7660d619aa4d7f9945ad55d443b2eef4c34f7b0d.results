PTX3 levels are enhanced in human asthma PTX3 expression has been shown to be increased in patients with several pulmonary diseases, including cigarette smoke-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, LPS-induced acute lung injury, and murine SARS infection. 9 Previously, we have shown augmented expression of PTX3 in bronchial biopsy specimens obtained from patients with severe allergic asthma compared with healthy subjects. 10 We further validated this in BALF of human patients with severe asthma compared with healthy donors (Tables I-III) . Patients with severe asthma exhibit greater concentrations of PTX3 in BALF compared with healthy donors (240.2 6 58.6 vs 78.60 6 47.6 pg/mL; n 5 10; P < .01; Fig 1, A) . PTX3 concentrations are increased in OVA-exposed murine lungs Next, we sought to determine PTX3 production in the lungs of mice in response to acute OVA exposure. Mice were sensitized with OVA plus alum intraperitoneally on days 1 and 11 and challenged intranasally on days 18 and 19 (Fig 1, B) . OVA-sensitized and challenged mice display a significant increase in BALF and lung PTX3 concentrations compared with their saline controls (BALF PTX3: 321 6 89 vs *Donor had a normal FEV 1 /forced vital capacity ratio and diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide value. There was no difference between total lung capacity, as calculated by using plethysmography and the single-breath method, which suggests the absence of any obstruction.
