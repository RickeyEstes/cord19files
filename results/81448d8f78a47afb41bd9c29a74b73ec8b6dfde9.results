During the nearly 21-week period of study, a total of 563 samples were processed for CC and R-mix TM shell vial assay. Rapid DAT was performed on a subset of 329 of these samples (58%). Patient age ranged from 2 weeks to 79 years (mean 4.4 years, median 1.0 years); and 95% of specimens received were collected from patients <18 years of age. From the 563 specimens included in the analysis, a total of 207 viruses were detected by one or more method, resulting in an overall positivity rate of 36.8%. These figures include eight samples from which dual virus infection was detected (Table 1) . The most frequently detected virus during the study period was RSV (n = 78), followed by influenza A/B (n = 36), adenovirus (n = 31), parainfluenza 1-3 and picornaviruses (n = 23 each) (Table II) . Sensitivity/NPV for the detection of RSV by R-mix TM was significantly higher than by CC (73%/95.8% and 42%/91.5%, respectively; p = 0.0001); and mean TTD of all RSV positive specimens by R-mix TM shell vial assay was 1.2 days compared to 8.0 days required by CC. On the other hand, DAT identified 72/72 RSV-positive samples (20 by EIA, 52 by DFA), resulting in a significantly greater sensitivity/NPV for RSV (100%/100%) than for either CC or R-mix TM (p < 0.0001). In addition, all results were reported within 24 h of specimen processing. Sensitivity/NPV for the detection of adenovirus was significantly higher by CC than by R-mix TM (100%/100% and 45%/96.9%, respectively; p < 0.0001), while mean TTD by CC was 4.8 days versus 1.4 days by R-mix TM . Interestingly, CC required an average of 2.6 days for isolation of the 14 adenovirus strains detected by the R-mix TM system, whereas mean TTD for the other 17 isolates (identified by CC only) was 6.7 days. Sensitivity/NPV for the detection of all parainfluenza isolates was 87%/99.4% by CC and 83%/99.2% by R-mix TM . These differences (as well as differences between detection of individual serotypes) were not significant. Additionally, 23 picornavirus isolates and 16 herpesvirus isolates were recovered by CC only (Table 2) . A total of 36 specimens containing either influenza A (n = 31) or B (n = 5) was identified in the study, 27 by CC, 28 by R-mix TM , and 15 by DAT (11 by EIA and 4 by DFA) ( Table 2 ). Sensitivities and 95% confidence intervals for combined influenza A/B detection were 75% (59-86%), 78% (62-89%) and 65% (45-81%) for CC, R-mix TM and DAT, respectively (Table 2 ). No statistical difference in sensitivity between the two culture methods was identified, yet mean TTD by R-mix TM was 2.3 days shorter than by CC. Sensitivity for influenza A/B detection by DAT did not differ significantly when compared to either culture methodology. Further analysis of influenza A and B data subsets individually yielded similar results, as did sub-analysis of individual DAT methodologies (data is not shown). Because our routine laboratory protocol does not incorporate culture for DAT-positive samples throughout the epidemic season, we chose to analyze separately culture results from the subset of specimens that were either DATnegative or on which DAT was not performed (due to lack of request). Of 468 such cultures, 6 (1.3%) and 21 (4.5%) were positive for RSV and influenza A/B, respectively, by either R-mix TM or CC (Table 3) . When analyzed in this fashion, no statistical differences in sensitivity between R-mix TM and CC for the detection of RSV or influenza A/B were noted. Mean TTD by R-mix TM remained shorter than by CC, averaging 3.2 and 8.6 days faster for influenza A/B and RSV, respectively. Had this culture protocol been in place during the study period, however, the overall detection rate by either CC or R-mix TM would have been effectively reduced. As illustrated in Fig. 1 , the relative proportions of viruses detected by culture alone would have differed in comparison with the proportions detected by all three methodologies. As a result, while RSV, influenza A/B and parainfluenza 1-3 comprise 67% of the total number of viruses detected by all methods (Fig. 1A) , they represent only 44% of viruses detected by culture alone (Fig. 1B) . Put differently, specimens for which culture would have been the sole manner of virus detection (e.g. DAT negative or DAT not requested) gave similar overall positivity rates for RSV (5/468; 1.1%), HSV (5/468; 1.1%) and CMV (11/468; 2.4%) as well as for influenza A/B (21/468; 4.5%), picornaviruses (23/468; 4.9%), adenovirus (31/468; 6.6%) and parainfluenza 1-3 (23/468; 4.9%) (Fig. 1B) . Equivocal results were occasionally obtained by R-mix TM when screening with the pooled antibody was positive but confirmation staining of a replicate SV with individual antibodies was negative. A total of 33 specimens gave such initial equivocal results (17 at 24 h and 16 at 48 h). Of these, 11 (33%) were identified as virus-positive by CC and/or DAT but were negative by R-mix TM upon repeat staining (five adenovirus, four influenza A, and two parainfluenza 3). Thirteen samples (39%) were negative by CC, DAT and R-mix TM . The remaining nine samples were initially equivocal at 24 h but became positive at 48 h upon repeat staining with individual, virus-specific antibodies (one adenovirus, two influenza A, four RSV and two parainfluenza 3 isolates). Seven of these nine isolates were concomitantly identified by CC and/or DAT. Overall, the R-mix TM system was well accepted among laboratory personnel due to its performance ease and timesavings. Given the two culture protocols used in this study, we found negligible differences in set-up times (e.g. specimen processing, inoculations, centrifugation steps, etc.) and baseline material costs (i.e. cell monolayers/shell vials) between the two culture methodologies. The primary differences in cost were noted in immunofluorescent reagents and overall technologist time. We calculated having spent approximately $12,000 for R-mix TM ($21 per specimen) and approximately $3000 for CC ($5 per specimen) on immune reagents over the entire study period. This was partially compensated for by savings in technologist time-∼0.37 h per specimen for R-mix TM versus ∼1.02 h per specimen for CC, representing a difference of $13 per specimen based upon a $20 h −1 salary. Other items either represented nominal costs or were difficult to calculate due to their use in other assays.
