Thirty Holstein calves reared under an educative intensive dairy management system were monitored for BCoV infection during their first 60 days of age. Six out of thirty (6/30; 20%) calves died because of additional causes other than BCoV diarrhea. In order to evaluate colostrum intake, total serum protein levels for each calf were measured at the beginning of the study. The mean (±SD) value of total serum proteins in sera was 7.1 ± 0.9 g/dl. When the kinetics of the IgG1 Ab levels to BCoV was evaluated by ELISA for each individual calf, we observed that the IgG1 Ab titers to BCoV in the calves' sera (representing colostrum intake) were highly heterogeneous on arrival to the farm (IgG1 Ab titers for each calf are shown in Table 1 ). Calves' passive immunity to BCoV was also analyzed in order to understand BCoV pathogenesis. Animals were classified into the FPT (titers ≤ 256) and APT (titers ≥ 1024) groups depending on their initial BCoV IgG1 ELISA Ab titers (Fig. 1) . The IgG1 Abs to BCoV significantly differed between groups depending on the time (GLMM Group-Time F (5,120) = 12.17, p < 0.0001). The FPT group had significantly lower IgG1 Ab titers to BCoV than the APT calves for up to seven days after the beginning of the experiment. These significant differences were also observed when measuring total protein levels by refractometry (Kruskal---Wallis rank sum test, p = 0.0081) which is the preferred method used to measure colostrum Abs transfer under field conditions. As expected, the higher the initial level of IgG1 Abs in the calves' sera, the longest it took for them to decrease to a susceptible level. When BCoV IgG1 Ab titers decreased to 16 or 64, BCoV infection was evidenced by either virus detection in feces, or by a minimum 16-fold increase of anti-BCoV IgG1 ELISA Ab titers for around two weeks (defined as seroconversion for the purpose of this study) (Table 1, Fig. 2 ). Moreover, 71% (5/7) of calves from the FPT group showed BCoV IgG1 seroconversion between 14 and 21 days of the experiment while only 29.4% (5/17) of the animals from the APT group presented sequential seroconversion during the same period (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.085) ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). However, the moments of seroconversion in the different groups of calves are not necessarily correlated with the days of age because, as we mentioned before, the calves' age was between 1 and 10 days at the beginning of the experience. The APT group average age at day 0 of the experience was 2.8 days while the FPT group average age was 5.4 days (data not shown). Considering the presence of neonatal diarrhea in calves with varying titers of colostrum Abs, it was observed that all calves were affected by one, two or even three events of severe diarrhea with an average duration of 18 days (Table 2 ); BCoV shedding of short time duration (2---3 days) was detected in 10% (3/30) of calves (Tables 1 and 2 ) and the highest BCoV infectious titer was 10 5 FFU/ml of stool. Although viral shedding was detected at a low rate in the calves' stool, BCoV IgG1 seroconversion was observed in 42% of animals, suggesting that almost half of the calves were exposed to BCoV (Table 1) . Calves shedding BCoV in stools were further analyzed. Calf #66 had a first 14 day-diarrhea episode in which BCoV was detected from 9 to 11 days of the study (9, 10 and 11 days of age). This calf had additional diarrhea episodes that were not associated with BCoV infection. Calf #76 had diarrhea since the experiment started (ten days of life for this calf) and during 15 days, in which BCoV was detected at 6 and 7 days of the experiment (15 and 16 days of age). Then, this calf had other diarrhea episodes without etiologic diagnosis. Finally, calf #611 had 16 days of severe diarrhea beginning at day two of the study (six days of life), while BCoV was detected at 15 and 16 days of the experiment (20 and 21 days of age). In these three cases the presence of BCoV was associated with severe diarrhea (fecal score ≥ 3). Two out of three calves showed BCoV IgG1 seroconversion at the same time of viral detection (Fig. 2) . The third BCoVpositive calf died with severe diarrhea. Calves' fecal samples were also tested for RVA as another common causing agent of neonatal gastroenteritis. RVA shedding was detected in 50% (15/30) of the calves, between three to ten days of age. No bacterial or parasite diagnosis was performed; however, taking into consideration that neither antibiotics nor anti-parasitic drugs were administered to the calves, diarrhea caused by either of these groups of agents may not be discarded. As a final important parameter, all the calves' weight was registered. Even though all the calves presented severe diarrhea at some point during the study, once the clinical signs of gastroenteritis disappeared, all animals gained weight reaching an average of 90 kg by the end of the experiment. All calves duplicated their weight during the study period (60 days) with no significant differences between the groups.
