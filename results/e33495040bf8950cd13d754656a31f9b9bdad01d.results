The study ran from 5th January 2015 until 1st July 2015 as planned. No changes were made to the study protocol. During this time 606 patients met eligibility criteria (Fig. 1 ). Sixty-one (10.1%) of these patients were not included (33 in the intervention arm, 28 in the control arm) because 20 were discharged before enrolment, an interpreter was unavailable for three, 34 declined participation, one patient died before being approached, one patient consented but the test was not performed and information is missing for two patients. No patients withdrew from the study. Thus 545 (89.9%) patients were enrolled and included in the analysis, 211 in the control arm and 334 in the intervention arm. All statistical analyses were pre-specified; there were no post-hoc analyses. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two study arms (Table 2) . CURB-65 score was missing for 62.9% of patients for whom it was relevant and was omitted from the analysis. One hundred and sixty-five (30%) patients had a negative time to antibiotics changed to 0 h (median − 1.5 h [IQR −3.5 to −0.8]). The median time to result from admission was substantially shorter in the intervention arm compared to the control arm (control arm 39.5 h (IQR 25.4-57.6), intervention arm 19.0 h (IQR 8.1-31.7) ), two-sample ttest assuming unequal variances, p < 0.001. Ward staff of all grades performed 28% of POC tests, 68% of the samples were tested by study investigators and there is no record for 4%. No adverse events were reported. Overall, 124 (22.8%) of the 545 patients had a positive result (Table 3) , 43 (20.4%) in the control arm and 81 (24.3%) in the intervention arm. The viruses and bacteria detected are shown in Table 3 . Every virus on the panels was identified except parainfluenza virus type 1, type 2 and type 4. Only single pathogens were detected by routine testing but FilmArray® detected dual infections in five samples. FilmArray® also detected coronaviruses, not detected using standard tests. There were three and four invalid tests in the control and intervention arms respectively, the remaining tests were negative (78.2% control, 74.6% intervention). M. pneumoniae was the only bacterium on the panels which was identified. Four patients in the control arm had an elevated Mycoplasma CFT (1:64, 1:64, 1:32, >1:16). Convalescent serology was not sent, rendering results uninterpretable. All of these results were available after ward discharge, three after hospital discharge, and did not influence management. The TAT was 8-13 days. Five patients in the intervention arm had M. pneumoniae detected by FilmArray®. Antibiotics were started for 2 of these cases and extended in 2 after discussion with the Microbiologist. There was no evidence that the length of hospital stay, the primary endpoint, was reduced by POC testing. The median length of hospital stay was 79.6 h (IQR 41.9-188.9) in the control arm and 98.6 h (IQR 48.1-218.4) in the intervention arm. In the linear model (for log-transformed length of stay data, adjusting for potential confounders) the rapid test was associated with an absolute difference in the natural logarithm of the length of stay of 0.108 (95% CI [−0.089, 0.305]; p = 0.28). This corresponds to an 11% (95% CI [−9%, 36%]) increase in length of stay associated with the rapid test arm. Six of 33 patients tested on the MAC in the control arm (18%) and 13 of 67 patients tested in the MAC in the intervention arm (19.4%) were discharged without admission to a hospital ward. For all but one of the secondary outcomes, there was no evidence that the intervention had an effect (Table 4) . Only the prescribing decision within 24 h following the diagnostic results under investigation showed evidence of a difference between study arms (Table 5 , p < 0.001, Pearson's Chi-squared test, p-value calculated by 10,000 Monte Carlo replicates). Charlson score a 0 (0-2) 1 (0-3) White cell count (×10 9 /L) a 9.6 (6.8-13.7) 9.6 (6.9-13. Fifty-one patients had influenza A virus and/or influenza B virus detected by either the routine assay (21) or by the FilmArray® (30) . Of these patients, 13 of 21 (62%) in the control arm and 24 of 30 (80%) in the intervention arm were given antivirals. The time to the first dose from the time of admission was known for all but one patient in each arm and was considerably reduced in the intervention arm: median of 60.4 h in the control arm (IQR 22.7-85.2) and 24 h in the intervention arm (IQR 11.6-33.0). Only one patient in each arm was given empiric antivirals but had a no viruses detected. The planned subgroup analysis excluding patients who had infection proven elsewhere after enrolment e.g. urinary tract infection (n = 33) did not substantially alter any of the above results.
