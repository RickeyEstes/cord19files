Enrichment NGS aids in the detection and characterization of diverse CoVs. In surveillance studies, detection and characterization are fundamental requirements to fully assess the risk that bat CoVs pose to humans. We aimed to address two main issues encountered during surveillance studies. First, many samples are collected but not all samples harbor viruses. Second, when viruses are detected, the high genetic diversity of CoVs means that full-length genome sequencing is essential to fully characterize viruses. In the context of CoV discovery, it is not time or cost-effective to perform unbiased NGS on all samples. Most data generated from unbiased NGS can be attributed to non-CoV-specific reads. To assess whether samples can be enriched to allow sequencing of only CoV-specific reads, we utilized NGS in conjunction with viral nucleic acid capture specifically targeting most of the known CoVs using a pool of 4,303 unique baits (18) . These baits were designed from 90 representative CoV genomes, and in silico analysis determined that these baits should target all known CoV species tested here ( [MHV]) were amplified in cell culture, and RNA was extracted from the supernatants. Additionally, to test the robustness of the assay, RNA was extracted from 3 clinical samples (oral swabs from humans infected with human CoV OC43 [HCoV-OC43], HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63). NGS libraries were constructed and either directly sequenced or subjected to enrichment prior to sequencing. The 17 captured samples were made into two pools (8 or 9 per pool) for sequencing. The total amount of data obtained was variable across samples, but in swabs, unbiased NGS consistently produced more data (Fig. 1A ). Within these data sets, the ratios of viral reads to total number of reads increased by almost 100% for captured samples, in contrast to the ratios of less than 1% for most of the unbiased NGS (Fig. 1B) . The high ratio of viral to total reads in conjunction with decreased data size reduces the sequencing cost and data analysis burden. This methodology could thus greatly facilitate large-scale surveillance studies. Ratios of viral to total reads were determined by mapping reads to the respective reference genome using CLC genomics. (C) CoV Circos plots. RNA extracted from cell culture supernatant or human oral swabs was subjected to NGS analysis. Circos plots, from outer to inner circle: CoV genome length (bp), genome annotation, CoV bait positions, read depth from direct NGS (blue lines), and read depth from enrichment NGS (red lines). Scale of read depth is shown as seven thin circular lines and ranges from 0 to 10 6 . Sample details can be found in Table S2 in the supplemental material. Once viral reads are detected in a sample, enrichment NGS can be retrospectively complemented with unbiased NGS and/or additional Sanger sequencing to obtain full-length genomes. The full-length genomes were obtained by NGS for the five cultured viruses and with minimal further gap filling for HCoV-HKU1 (240 bp), HCoV-NL63 (566 bp), and HCoV-OC43 (2,465 bp). The efficiency of CoV enrichment NGS was closely related to the number of baits and cycle threshold (C T ) value ( Fig. 1C and Table S2 ). Read depth and genome coverage were compared between unbiased NGS and enrichment NGS. The read depth for SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), MERS-CoV, PEDV, and TGEV increased from 10-to 1,000-fold throughout the genome after enrichment. The increase in read depth can be partially attributed to the high viral titers in cultured samples. Sequencing of the full-length genome of green fluorescent protein-labeled MHV (MHV-GFP) was successful, although the read depth was lower than for unbiased NGS (Fig. 1C ). An increase in read depth of at least 10-fold was observed in HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 in regions where baits were present. Sequencing of the partial genome of HCoV-HKU1 was successful with enrichment NGS, but the full-length genome was obtained with unbiased NGS (Fig. 1C) . Taken together, these data indicate that enrichment NGS not only decreases the amount of data requiring analysis but can produce full-length genome coverage in both laboratory and clinical samples. Discovery of bat CoV genomes using capture-based NGS. The NGS pipeline was assessed for CoV discovery in bat samples. Samples from representative bat CoV species were selected based on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequence similarity to that of reference genomes. Similar to the human swab samples (Fig. 1 ), more data were obtained from unbiased NGS, but a higher ratio of viral to total reads was observed after enrichment ( Fig. 2A and B ). An increase of at least 10-fold in read depth was observed for BtMiCoV-1 (Miniopterus bat coronavirus 1), BtMiCoV-HKU8r (Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8 related) (hereinafter, "r" denotes "related"), BtRhCoV-HKU2r (Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2 related), and BtPiCoV-HKU5r (Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 related) in regions where baits were located (Fig. 2C ). Although reads were obtained for BtRaCoV-229Er (Human coronavirus 229E related; sampled from Rousettus aegyptiacus bat) and BtScCoV-512r (Scotophilus bat coronavirus 512 related) after enrichment, more virus-specific reads were obtained with unbiased NGS. Similarly, the efficiency of unbiased NGS was poor on BtHpCoV-HKU10r (Bat coronavirus HKU10 related; sampled from Hipposideros pomona bat), BtHiCoV-CHB25 (related to Bat coronavirus HKU10; sampled from Hipposideros pomona bat), and BtTyCoV-HKU4r (Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 related). In total, full-length genome coverage was obtained for six of nine genomes without further gap filling. More than 75% genome coverage was obtained for another 3 samples. Although complete genome coverage was obtained mostly from unbiased NGS, targeted enrichment clearly identified the presence of CoVs in bat samples. In a surveillance study, targeted enrichment is a valuable tool to triage samples for further processing. Diversity of bat CoV genomes. To assess the diversity of nine novel bat CoV genomes, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the conserved ORF1b protein as a reference (Fig. 3A) . The newly identified viruses were most closely related to BtPiCoV-HKU5 (BtPiCoV-HKU5r), BtTyCoV-HKU4 (BtTyCoV-HKU4r), BtMiCoV-1 (BtMiCoV-1r), BtRhCoV-HKU2 (BtRhCoV-HKU2r), BtRaCoV-229E (BtRaCoV-229Er), BtScCoV-512 (BtScCoV-512r), BtMiCoV-HKU8 (BtMiCoV-HKU8r), and BtHpCoV-HKU10 (BtHpCoV-HKU10r and BtHiCoV-CHB25). In addition to the comparison with ORF1b at the protein level, the genomes of the newly identified viruses were compared to their respective reference genomes at the nucleotide level. The nucleotide sequence similarities were 97%, 96%, 96%, 89%, 85%, 91%, and 90% for BtPiCoV-HKU5r, BtTyCoV-HKU4r, BtMiCoV-1r, BtRhCoV-HKU2r, BtRaCoV-229Er, BtScCoV-512r, and BtMiCoV-HKU8r, respectively. The nucleotide sequence similarities of BtHpCoV-HKU10r and BtHiCoV-CHB25 to BtHpCoV-HKU10 were 88% and 73%, respectively (Fig. 3B) . The most divergent region of the genome was the region encoding the N terminus of the spike protein, which is usually responsible for receptor binding. In this region, seven of eight genomes showed less than 90% nucleotide identity, and five were below 40% nucleotide identity, suggesting these viruses may utilize a different receptor than their reference viruses. The most divergent, BtMiCoV-HKU8r, shared less than 10% sequence identity in this region. Another divergent region in the CoV genome is the region encoding the C terminus of the product of the N gene and the 3= untranslated region (UTR) of the accessory protein gene (Fig. 3B ). CoV accessory proteins are responsible for host response modulation and are highly variable among CoVs (1). The diversity observed in the genomes of these newly identified viruses suggests that these CoVs may be quite different in terms of receptor usage or virus-host interaction.
