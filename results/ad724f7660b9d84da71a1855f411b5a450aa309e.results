The SOP rapidly generates noninfectious, barcoded DNA libraries for ssRNA؉ viruses. An overview of our approach illustrates nine major steps (Fig. 1A) . First, viral RNA is isolated using a commercially available RNeasy kit or Trizol. Second, purified viral RNA is used as a template for sequence-independent cDNA synthesis, and a random library of barcoded PCR products is constructed. Third, DNA products of the SOP are treated with RNase. Fourth, SOP products are purified. At this point, we tested all products of the SOP for loss of viral infectivity and for the absence of infectious full-length viral genomic RNA. This step is not highlighted yellow in Fig. 1 and is not included in the final SOP, since the methods are virus specific. Fifth, immediately prior to transfer, all samples are heated at 72°C for 30 min to inactivate any potential virus contamination that could inadvertently occur during cDNA generation and purification (16) . Sixth, all samples are transferred from BSL-3/4 to BSL-2 space. Seventh, products from the SOP are pooled and subjected to NGS library construction. Eighth, libraries are sequenced. Ninth, sequence data are analyzed and computationally assembled in standard office space. A full detailed protocol for the SOP is provided in our supplemental methods (Text S1 in the supplemental material). Sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) utilizes a random hexamer primer coupled to a unique barcode (BC-N6 [ Fig. 1B] ). The BC-N6 oligonucleotide generates single-stranded cDNA from input RNA and double-stranded DNA by randomly priming the synthesized cDNA. Finally, a PCR step with primers encoding only the barcode sequence amplifies and uniquely barcodes a sample. As a result, small PCR products are generated with unique barcodes on each terminus of randomly primed amplicons. A representative gel image displays products of the SOP obtained from serial dilutions of genomic human rhinovirus 16 (HRV-16) virion RNA. At high input RNA amounts, a smear between 200 bp and 1 kb is visible. This signal intensity diminishes as the starting material is diluted (Fig. 1C) . Upstream steps may be required prior to initiating the SOP. When starting from a high-titer virus stock, directly proceeding to the SOP (Fig. 1A) will provide the investigator with sufficient sample purity to obtain viral sequence data that spans the majority of the viral genome. For a heterogeneous sample (e.g., virus-infected cells), a host RNA depletion step, such as rRNA or mRNA removal may be required to enrich for virusspecific sequences before proceeding to the SOP (Fig. 1D) . The SOP recovers full-length genomic sequence data across multiple ss-RNA؉ virus families. We sought to perform the SOP in multiple laboratories and test diverse virus families. Therefore, a standardized version of the SOP was distributed to laboratories that have expertise working with various ssRNAϩ virus families (17) (18) (19) . For proof-of-principle experiments, work was performed with both BSL-2 and BSL-3 ss-RNAϩ viruses. Representative genomic coverage for FMDV, WNV, HRV-16, CHIKV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) obtained from Illumina MiSeq sequencing illustrates that 99.9 to 98% genome coverage was achieved for each virus ( Fig. 2A A detailed protocol is provided in Text S1 in the supplemental material. Steps in the pink box denote work performed in a biosafety level 3 and/or 4 (BSL-3/4) laboratory. Steps in the blue box denote work that can be performed in a BSL-2 laboratory. The asterisk in step 1 indicates that for nonselect agent pathogens (e.g., West Nile virus), extracted RNA may be moved to BSL-2 for library construction. Step 1, generating cDNA and SISPA, utilizes a primer with a random hexamer coupled to a unique barcode (BC-N6). SISPA stands for sequence-independent single-primer amplification. (B) The BC-N6 primer is used for both generating single-stranded cDNA from input RNA and generating double-stranded DNA by randomly priming the synthesized cDNA. A PCR step using primers only encoding the barcode sequence with either three or four random nucleotides (3N/4N) at the 5= end simultaneously amplifies and uniquely identifies (barcodes) a sample.

At high-input RNA amounts, a smear between 200 bp and 1,000 bp is visible. This signal intensity diminishes as the starting material is diluted. (D) Summary of diverse types of starting material which can feed into the SOP. Samples enriched for virus-specific sequence (e.g., virion stocks) can directly proceed to the SOP. For samples that contain a majority of host nucleic acid, the use of upstream procedures to enrich for virus-specific signal (e.g., rRNA depletion or mRNA enhancement) is recommended. 3= ends of the genome and large homopolymer regions, such as the poly(C) region present in the 5= untranslated region (5=-UTR) of FMDV (20) . To date, we have sequenced 299 FMDV samples, 49 MERS-CoV samples, 175 WNV samples, 224 HRV (both HRV-14 and -16) samples, and 25 CHIKV samples (representative data from each family are summarized in Table S2 in the supplemental material). An advantage of this system is the ability to create a single library from hundreds of barcoded samples rather than hundreds of libraries, dramatically reducing the time and cost associated with reagents and labor. In cases where the sequences are of sufficient depth, minor variants that differ from the provided reference sequence may be determined using bioinformatic pipelines that integrate CLCbio software (21) and custom software. Representative WNV data ( Fig. 2 ; Table S1 ) was subjected to minor variant analysis, and we identified 11 base changes from the reference sequence (GenBank accession no. AF404756.1). These changes were a combination of three engineered mutations (positions 8859, 8862, and 8880) (22) and eight additional changes present in the virus stock, serving as a control for our sequencing and analyses.
