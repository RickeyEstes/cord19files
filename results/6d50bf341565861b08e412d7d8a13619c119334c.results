Amino acid residue 441 (arginine) is essential for the immunogenicity of RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies It was recently reported that the full-length S protein of SARS-CoV bearing R441A substitution failed to induce neutralizing antibodies against S protein-pseudotyped viruses [33] . We are interested in investigating whether this point mutation can also affect the immunogenicity of RBD-Fc, a potent inducer of neutralizing antibodies [28, 29] . The RBD-R441A mutant was generated by mutagenesis as described. Both wild-type RBD-Fc and RBD-R441A were expressed in 293T cells and purified to homogenicity by protein A chromatography (Fig. 1C) . For comparison, both the wild-type and mutant proteins were, respectively, used to immunize mice and rabbits. As shown in Fig. 2 , both mice and rabbits developed robust antibody responses against the corresponding immunogens after the third boosting immunizations. Relatively, RBD-Fc induced higher titers of antibodies in both mice (mean end-point titer was 1/656,100) and rabbits (mean end-point titer was 1/5,904,900), whereas RBD-R441A induced antibodies with mean end-point titers at 1/145,800 in mice and at 1/328,050 in rabbits. We used a recombinant full-length S protein (FL-S) as a coating antigen to measure the titers of antibodies specific for the RBD in the antisera collected after the third boost (Fig. 3) . Surprisingly, while the RBD-Fc could induce high titers of RBD-specific antibodies in mice and rabbits (mean endpoint titers were 1/656,100 and 1/437,400, respectively), the R441A mutant only induced RBD-specific antibody titers at 1/2700 in mice and 1/1800 in rabbits, respectively. We then tested whether mouse and rabbit antisera had neutralizing activities against S protein-mediated viral entry by using SARS pseudovirus. Consistent with our previous findings [28, 29] , both mouse and rabbit antibodies induced by RBD-Fc could potently neutralize SARS pseudovirus with mean 50% neutralizing titers at 1/58,320 and 1/19,440, respectively (Fig. 4) . However, the antibodies induced by RBD-R441A mutant in both mice and rabbits could not significantly inhibit SARS pseudovirus at 1/40 or higher dilutions. These results indicate that R441A substitution severely impairs the immunogenicity of RBD-Fc to elicit RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies in immunized animals.
