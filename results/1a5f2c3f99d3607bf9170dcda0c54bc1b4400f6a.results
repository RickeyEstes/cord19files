Identification of shared pathogens. Our assessment using a structured literature review and expert panel identified 39 (46%) of the 84 OIE terrestrial pathogens as those that can affect swine, with 22 (56%) viral, 9 (23%) bacterial, and 8 (21%) parasitic pathogens ( Table 2) . Of these 39 pathogens affecting swine, 33 (85%) caused clinical disease while only a few (4; 10%) were categorized as causing asymptomatic (or subclinical) infection or had documented natural infections in swine with unknown consequences in (2; 5%). Our assessment of all species' susceptibility to pathogens of swine found that of these 39 pathogens, 34 (87.2%) caused clinical or sub-clinical disease in at least one other species. On average 70% (±25%; ±StDev) of swine pathogens could infect other species (Table 3) . Specifically, non-swine hosts were susceptible (clinical, subclinical, affected, and occasionally affected) to 80% (±32%) of bacterial, 56% (±13%) of viral, and 73% (±24%) of swine parasitic pathogens. All species except for poultry were susceptible to greater than 75% of bacterial pathogens. All species except poultry and cervids were susceptible to more than 75% of parasites; humans had the greatest number, being susceptible to 100% of parasites evaluated. Susceptibility to swine viral pathogens was the lowest among other host species with Bovidae (cattle, sheep, goat) being the most susceptible (>60%) to swine viral pathogens (see Table 2 ). On average 73% (±29%) of bacterial, 39% (±13%) of viral, and 63% (±20%) of swine parasitic pathogens caused clinical disease in other species. All species except poultry and cervids had greater than 75% of swine bacterial pathogens causing clinical disease. Humans accounted for the greatest proportion of swine viral pathogens causing clinical disease (88%) while cattle, humans, and horses accounted for the greatest number of parasitic pathogens causing clinical disease. We also documented studies that specifically investigated wild pigs for susceptibility to domestic swine diseases. Nearly all 8 (80%) of the bacterial diseases had been investigated using wild pigs. Only 10 (37%) of the viral pathogens and 3 (37%) of the parasitic pathogens had been investigated in wild pigs. Transmission potential. Transmission potential, measured using the Jaccard index, between swine and other species demonstrated heterogeneity. Figure 1 illustrates the transmission potential between swine and other species. Members of the family Bovidae were important (upper 75 th quartile Jaccard index) for all but parasitic pathogens causing clinical disease. When all pathogens were considered together cattle was the only species group in the upper 75 th quartile. Transmission potential between swine and multiple species was greatest for bacterial pathogens with cattle, sheep, goat, and horse all having Jaccard index values in the upper 75 th quartile. Viral pathogen transmission with swine was greatest for cattle and goats. In our study parasitic pathogen transmission potential with swine was highest for humans. In networks considering all types of susceptibility cattle, sheep, and goat had the greatest relative transmission potential with swine. There was little difference between bacterial pathogen networks for clinical susceptibility and all susceptibilities. Parasitic transmission potential with swine increased with sheep, horse and humans all in the upper 75 th quartile. Centrality for species demonstrated less heterogeneity (Tables 3 and 4 Pathogen centrality had greater heterogeneity when compared to species centrality (see Supplemental  Table S4 ). Twenty four (70.6%) pathogens had eigenvector centralities greater than 0.5 and normalized degree centralities greater than 0.5, indicating they could be transmitted to at least half of the species considered. Only nine (26.5%) of the pathogens had centrality values below 0.5. Bacterial pathogens on average had greater Farms and rural populations potentially at risk. The co-occurrence of wild pigs and farms for all commodities increased across the ten years investigated (Fig. 3) . For the year 2012 on average 47.7% (range 56.5-36.5%) of all farms were in counties with wild pigs representing 46.6% (range 77.3-11.3%) of all domestic animals. The geographic co-occurrence for 2012 is illustrated in Fig. 4 and shows high densities of concordance in the Midwestern states of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, western states of California and Oregon, and eastern states of South Carolina, North Carolina and Florida. Farmed cervids had the largest increase resulting in a 66.6% increase in co-occurrence across the ten years. In 2012, 56.5% of all cervid farms representing 77.3% of all animals were in counties where wild pigs were present. Four of the seven agricultural commodities investigated had over 40% of farms in counties with wild pigs. Domestic swine, an agricultural commodity of concern for disease transmission from wild pigs, had a 58% increase in co-occurrence and an annual rate of increase of 1.3% (95% CI = 1.0-1.7%), with 36.5% farms and 11.3% of animals in counties with wild pigs. Rural human populations had a 29.9% increase in co-occurrence with wild pigs and an annual rate of increase of 1.07% (95% CI = 0.5-1.7%). In 2012 an estimated 46.5% of all rural U.S. citizens lived in counties with wild pigs.
