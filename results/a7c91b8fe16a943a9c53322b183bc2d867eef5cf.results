Our serology results demonstrated that IDV circulates throughout the country, in all tested species ( Figure 1 ). We observed a higher seroprevalence in bovine (47.2%, mean geometric titers or GMT: 67) than in small ruminants (1.5%, GMT 27 for ovine and 3.2%, GMT 31 for caprine), all regions combined (p < 0.01). In addition, the small ruminants presented low antibody titers (from 1:20 to 1:160) as compared to those observed in cattle (from 1:20 to 1:1280). We observed that sera from all years of collecting (2014-2018 all regions included) were at least seropositive for one serum. We observed differences of serological prevalence between French regions, ranging between 31-70% for bovine, 0-5.5% for ovine and 1.3-5.8% for caprine. These differences were only significant for cattle (p < 0.01, Ï‡2 test). For bovine, the highest seroprevalence was observed in Pays de la Loire, and the lowest in Hauts-de-France. The highest seroprevalence for goat and sheep were in Bretagne and Hauts-de-France regions, respectively.
