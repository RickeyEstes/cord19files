Nucleic acid of PRV, CIV, and CCV were used as templates in this study to evaluate the specificity of the multiplex-PCR primers. The results showed that, all primers pairs were found to detect their specific viral target with no amplification of non-target samples. The fluorescence signals were observed only in the positive controls (Figure 1) , revealing a good specificity of the assay. Sensitivity was tested using 10-fold serial dilutions of standards and the limit of detection was defined as the highest dilution that resulted in an MFI value above the cutoff value. In this study, these five viruses shared different cutoff values, which were based on the MFI values of their own negative controls. Data analysis showed that the limit of detection for each of the five viruses was about 100 copies/µL (Figure 2 and Table 3 ). The reproducibility and stability of the assay was determined using parallel reactions at concentrations of 10 8 , 10 5 , and 10 3 copies/µL of standard DNA/RNA. The inter-assay variance was less than 3%, while the intra-assay variance was less than 4%. The low inter-assay and intra-assay coefficient of variations demonstrated a high repeatability of the xTAG assay ( Table 4) . A total number of 75 clinical samples were evaluated by both the Luminex xTAG assay and conventional PCR. The positive rates for CDV, CPV, CAV, and CPIV were 8% (6/75), 50.7% (38/75), 2.7% (2/75), and 4% (3/75), respectively. No sample tested positive for RV and no mixed infections were identified. The detection results of these two methods were in 100% agreement. The positive detection rate of CDV test card was 8% (6/75), which was fully consistent with the xTAG assay. However, only 35 samples were tested positive with the CPV test card, three positive samples (confirmed by sequencing) were falsely detected as negative. To a certain extent, the xTAG assay was more sensitive than the colloidal gold test strip, as revealed by the comparison results (Supplementary Table S1 ). To determine the utility of the multiplex xTAG assay in multiplex infection, artificial mixed infection samples were tested. Three samples were found triple infection and four samples were found double infection (Figure 3) . Indicating that, the new developed multiplex xTAG assay had the ability to identify different targets in co-infection samples.
