Urinary F.D.P., IgG, and C3 concentrations are shown in two of the controls who had an influenza-like illness ( fig. 1 ). The mean urine F.D.P. concentration during the illness in eight controls was 2.37 mg/1 (s.n.&plusmn;1263) and this was significantly higher than the mean concentration in those controls who did not have the illness Proteinuria was found in only two controls (30 and 300 mg/dl), but the method used to measure urinary protein was poor, there being insufficient urine to carry out a detailed protein estimation by the biuret method. Blood not associated with menstruation was detected by microscopy in two consecutive urine samples from one woman during the illness. Blood urea and creatinine were not raised in any of the controls at any time. Serum antibody titres to the antigens tested were not raised in any of the eight controls. Throat and nasal swabs were not taken. The Paul Bunnell test for heterophil antibody was negative in all eight cases. Routine bacteriological cultures were negative and the anti-streptolysin 0 titre was not raised in any of the eight controls. The results of all haematological investigations for disseminated intravascular coagulation were within normal limits.
