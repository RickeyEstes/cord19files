Model 0 produced an MLE of R = 0.87 (95% CI: 0.46-1.90) and k = 0.035 (0.016-0.069). Model 1a, assuming a change in the reproductive number after the first generation of transmission, produced an MLE of R 0 = 5.2 (1.7-29.9), R c = 0.19 (0.05-0.53), k 0 = k c = 0.068 (0.031-0.14). Model 1b produced R 0 = 5.5 (1.7-35.4), R c = 0.14 (0.05-0.29), and k 0 = 0.061 (0.025-0.13). Model 1c produced R 0 = 5.5 (1.7-35.7), R c = 0.14 (0.05-0.27), and k 0 = 0.061 (0.025-0.13). Model 2a, assuming the change occurred after the second generation of transmission, resulted in estimates of R 0 = 2.0 (1.0-6.7), R c = 0.064 (0.007-0.27), and k 0 = k c = 0.078 (0.034-0.16). Model 2b produced R 0 = 2.2 (1.0-6.8), R c = 0.060 (0.008-0.18), and k 0 = 0.076 (0.032-0.16). Model 2c produced R 0 = 2.2 (1.0-6.8), R c = 0.060 (0.008-0.17), and k 0 = 0.076 (0.032-0.16). Each version of Models 1 and 2 produced an MLE with substantially higher likelihood and lower AIC than Model 0, the two-parameter (R, k) model previously implemented Kucharski and Althaus, 2015; Chowell et al., 2015) . Of these, models 2b and 2c produced the lowest AIC value (Table 2) ; we chose Model 2b to represent an optimal model under this criterion. We compared the risk assessment implications of the optimal model against those of other models. The optimal model produces a higher probability of smaller outbreaks across one or two generations of transmission, but a much lower probability of very large outbreaks or of outbreaks exceeding several transmission generations (Table 3) . The results under the assumption of undetected clusters (Table 4) show that Model 2b is still optimal according to AIC, although the change in AIC compared to Model 0 becomes smaller as the number of assumed undetected clusters increases. Also, as the number of assumed undetected clusters increases, the optimal model's estimate of "worst-case" outbreak sizes at the 0.1% or 0.01% probability level move closer to those of the simpler Model 0 ( Fig. 1 panels A, C, E) . However, the optimal model still produces much lower estimates of the probability of outbreaks lasting several generations across all assumptions for undetected clusters (Fig. 1  panels B, D, F) .
