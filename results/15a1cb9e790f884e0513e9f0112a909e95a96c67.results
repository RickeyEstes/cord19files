To tease apart the consequences of failing to account for stochasticity from those of improperly fitting to cumulative data, we fit both deterministic and stochastic models each to both actual incidence and accumulated incidence data. It is important to recognize that the exercise of fitting the stochastic model to accumulated data is not something one would ever actually do. Indeed, at the outset incompatibility of model assumptions with the data becomes evident. To see this, let H t be the true incidence (i.e., actual number of new infections) in reporting interval t and C t be the number of reported cases in that interval. Because of measurement error, C t = H t +ε t , where ε t is the error. Let h t = t s=1 H t and c t = t s=1 C t be the accumulated true and reported incidence, respectively. Because c t = t s=1 (H t + ε t ), the errors c t − h t are not independent, which is the fundamental problem associated with fitting to cumulative incidence data, irrespective of whether the model for H t is deterministic or stochastic. If one attempts to fit a stochastic model to c t by modeling c t = h t + ξ t , where ξ t are measurement errors, one is confronted with the fact that, even though the accumulated data, c t , and simulations of h t are guaranteed to increase with time, simulations of c t under this model will not in general be monotonically increasing. Nevertheless, one naturally wonders about the relative importance of the choice to use a deterministic or stochastic model vs. using raw or accumulated incidence data. Although the answer will certainly depend on both model and data, and therefore vary from situation to situation, we present the comparison in the present case to partially satisfy this natural curiosity. For the SEIR model fit to the Sierra Leone outbreak data, Fig. B2 shows likelihood profiles for the four model-data combinations and Fig. B3 shows the corresponding forecasts. Figure B1 : Additional summary statistics, or probes, computed on both stochastic model simulations and the data. In each panel, the probability density of the probes on the simulated data are shown in grey; the blue line indicates the value of the probe on the data. Probes include autocorrelation at lag 1 (ACF), standard deviation (SD) on log-transformed data, 90th percentile, the autocorrelation at lags 1, 2, and 3 wk after removing an exponential trend (DACF), and the exponential growth rate as obtained by log-linear regression (TREND). Figure B2 : R 0 likelihood profiles for four model-data combinations for the SEIR model fit to the Sierra Leone outbreak. Figure B3 : Forecast uncertainty for the Sierra Leone EBVD outbreak as a function of the model used and the data to which the model was fit. The ribbons show the median and 95% envelope of model simulations for the various models fit to raw and cumulative incidence data from the Sierra Leone outbreak. The data used in model fitting are shown using black triangles.
