Six hundred eighty-fi ve patients were included, fi and in 295 (43%) a causal diagnosis was reached: 118 S pneumoniae (17.2%), 24 L pneumophila (3.5%), 18 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.6%) , 14 Haemophilus influenzae fl (2%), 13 Staphylococcus aureus (1.9%), heterogeneous cytokine pattern activation with different combinations of high, medium, and low IL-6 and IL-10 levels, although they did not evaluate the infl uence of causal microorganisms. Our hypothesis is that causal microorganisms play a key role in the host response and may trigger different infl ammatory responses, depending on their intrinsic properties, the presence of a capsule, lipopolysaccharides in the cell wall, virulence factors, and infection spread. 1 Understanding the response of the host to the different pathogens is essential to increasing our knowledge of the course of infection in order to improve the diagnostic process and, possibly, for developing targeted therapeutic strategies. Our objective was to investigate the cytokine systemic activation patterns (tumor necrosis factor-a [TNF-a], IL-1 b, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10) together with the biomarkers procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) provoked by causal microorganisms in hospitalized patients with CAP. A secondary objective was to evaluate their usefulness in a causaldiagnosis approach. An abstract with some results has been published. 7
