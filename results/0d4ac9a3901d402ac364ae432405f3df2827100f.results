To test the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, critical-node strategy (CNS), we plot F (the fraction of the size of the largest connected component that can be infected) versus q (the fraction of immunized nodes) for several artificial networks (including Erdős-Rényi (ER) networks [28] and Barabási-Albert (BA) model networks [29] in Fig. 3) and empirical networks from different fields in Fig. 4 : the electrical power grid of the western United States (Power Grid) [32] [33] [34] , a trust network of mutual signing based on the pretty good privacy algorithm (PGP network) [35] [36] [37] [38] , collaboration network of arxiv condensed matter (ca-CondMat) [39, 40] , and email communication network from Enron (email-Enron) [41] [42] [43] . The detailed information of the networks is shown in Table 1 . Note that we here remove 58 self-loop edges from the source data of ca-CondMat. We compare the efficiency of the CNS to the degree centrality strategy (DCS), the betweenness centrality strategy (BCS), the equal graph partitioning strategy (EGP) and the adaptive degree centrality strategy (ADCS). In the ADCS we immunize a node by recalculating the importance of every node after the immunized node removal. For both of ER and BA networks, the CNS exhibits notable advantage of less nodes to be immunized compared to the other strategies. Regarding to threshold point q c , where F approaches 0 (F < 0.0005), the CNS shows over 50% improvement than the DCS and BCS, 18% in ER network and 26% in BA network than ADCS. For the real-world networks, the CNS also shows a larger improvement, over 50%, against both DCS, and gives an advantage of over 30% compared to ADCS. To further evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy, the susceptible-infectious-recovery (SIR) epidemic spreading model [44, 45] is used to evaluate the immunization effectiveness on the BA network, the PGP network, the ca-CondMat network and the email-Enron network. In the SIR model, each node belongs to one state of the susceptible state, the infected state and the recovered state. At the initial stage, the immunized nodes are removed from the network, including the incident links. We set one node that is randomly selected from the remaining network or networks (may be some disconnected subnetworks after immunized) to be infected to investigate the transmissibility of this node, and the others to be susceptible. At each time step, the infected nodes infect its susceptible neighbors with infection rate λ, and they recover with rate η. The recovered nodes are removed from the network. This process is repeated until there is no infected node in the network. The simulation results are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 . In the simulations we use λ = 0.4 and η = 0.05 for strong infection situation. For all of the networks studied here, the recovered fraction is significantly (42 to 77 times) lower when using the CNS compared to the ADCS with the same fraction of immunization doses. In Fig. 7 , we also investigate the threshold q c of the network parameters of ER and BA networks for different immunization strategies. The threshold q c is defined as the fraction of nodes immunized or removed for which F approaches 0 (F < 0.0005). In all networks tested here, the proposed strategy exhibits obviously effectiveness of lower q c compared to the other immunization strategies. Although q c increases with increasing the average degree k , the curves of CNS are far below curves of DCS, BCS and ADCS. Finally, comparing Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(d) , the results show that the proposed method is more effective in assortatively mixed networks where high degree nodes tend to connect to other high degree nodes, which is a common feature for many real networks [46, 47] . In the disassortative networks, high degree nodes mostly have neighbors with a small number of connections. Our strategy identifies the critical node only based on the largest and the second-largest connected components. It is expected that the proposed strategy will immunize or remove some low degree nodes (shown as Fig. 8(a) where q < 0.078 (F > 0.84) and Fig. 8(b) where q < 0.0518 (F > 0.8)), which is the critical node of two components, at the early stage. However, those components are also connected by some high degree nodes. The immunization threshold q c is quickly reached after those low degree nodes removal (q : 0.078 → 0.109 (F < 0.04) on the BA network and q : 0.0518 → 0.0711 (F < 0.04) on the email-Enron network). To summarize, the proposed method is more effective in assortatively mixed net- Table 1 Some statistical properties of the real-world networks: network size (n), edge number (m), average degree k , maximum degree k max , degree heterogeneity (H = k 2 / k 2 ), degree assortativity (r), clustering coefficient ( C ). works. In the disassortative networks, our strategy performs worse than other methods when low immunized fraction of nodes is conducted. However, it will outperform the others if we increase the immunized fraction of nodes.
