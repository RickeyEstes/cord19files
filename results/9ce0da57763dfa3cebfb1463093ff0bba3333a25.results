There were 110 calves enrolled in the study (48 females and 62 males), with a total of 220 fecal samples collected from the 109 farms (including the farm with twins). The results of the fecal examinations revealed Eimeria and Cryptosporidia as the protozoal infections infecting the calves, and Strongyloides as the helminth infection present among the study calves. There were no Giardia cysts detected in the fecal samples of the calves. Figure-1 shows a Cryptosporidia oocyst staining pink against a green malachite background. Figures-2 and -3 show an Eimeria oocyst and a Strongyloides papillosus egg as they appeared under a light microscope, respectively. sample, with 37.3% (41/110) infected at 4 weeks and 28.2% (31/110) infected at 6 weeks. The prevalence of Eimeria, Cryptosporidia, and Strongyloides was numerically but not statistically significantly higher at 4 weeks than at 6 weeks of age (p-value = 0.64; 0.47; 0.11, respectively). Moreover, the confidence intervals for the two ages of calves were overlapping for the three parasites. Only 7.3% (8/109), 0.9% (1/107), and 0.9% (1/109) of the study calves were infected at both 4 and 6 weeks of age with Eimeria, Cryptosporidia, and Strongyloides, respectively. Mixed parasitic infections were reported in 10.3% (6/58) and were only detected in 4 week old calves; Eimeria and Cryptosporidia 5.2% (3/58), Eimeria and Strongyloides 3.4% (2/58), Eimeria, Cryptosporidia, and Strongyloides 1.7% (1/58). All mixed infections occurred with Eimeria and one or more of the other parasites.
