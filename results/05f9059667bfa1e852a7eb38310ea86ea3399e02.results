During the 12-month study period that began in June 2006 and ended in May 2007, 22/189 (11.6%) samples tested positive for Giardia antigens by the fecal antigen ELISA method. These samples included intestinal contents obtained at necropsy of scouring calves, and intestinal tissue and fecal mail-in samples from scouring calves received at the NDSU-VDL. Except for one Giardia-positive case that was also positive for coronavirus and E. coli expressing the virulence factors F41 and Stx-I, no other pathogenic organisms were identified in all the other 21 Giardia-positive cases. The highest number of Giardia-positive cases was recorded during the warm months of June 2006 (four cases) and May 2007 (seven cases). Of all the Giardia positive cases, 95% were aged between 1 and 4 weeks, and no age was indicated for 5% of the calves. Of all the calf samples tested, virulent E. coli accounted for 16/189 (8.5%), Salmonella spp. for 11/189 (5.8%), Cryptos-poridium spp. for 56/189 (29.6%), coccidia for 13/189 (6.9%), rotavirus for 47/189 (24.9%) and coronavirus for 24/189 (12.7%). A mixed infection of Giardia spp., E. coli and coronavirus was demonstrated in one calf. Of the ELISA-positive samples that were sent to a referral laboratory for PCR testing, 10/17 (58.8%) were positive for assemblage E Giardia DNA, 6/17 (35.3%) were negative and 1/17 (5.9%) could not be tested because of sample quality. For the cases where fresh or formalin-fixed intestinal tissue samples were available, intestinal sections were examined by the principal investigator, and further evaluated by two board-certified veterinary pathologists who in a blinded fashion analyzed the H&E sections, and scored the parasite loads in the IHC sections. Low to moderate numbers of lymphoplasmacytic cells and rare eosinophils infiltrated into the submucosa and lamina propria and occasional crypts were distended by low numbers of inflammatory cells (Fig. 1) . Results of the examination of correlate IHC stained sections included variable numbers of Giardia trophozoites that were admixed with sloughed enterocytes in the intestinal lumen of Giardia spp. positive calves (Fig. 1) , or many parasites that were attached to the intact or disrupted villus enterocytes in the calf that was positive for Giardia spp., coronavirus and virulent E. coli (Fig. 2) . In the latter, there were numerous Giardia trophozoites that invaded into the mucosa (Fig. 2) . No comparable histologic changes or Giardia trophozoites were present in H&E and IHC sections of intestinal tissue obtained from the negative control (Fig. 3) .
