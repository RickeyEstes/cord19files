From the two sites, a total of 47 wild pigs were sampled including six (12.8%) juveniles and 41 (87.2%) adults; 18 (38.3%) were males and 29 (61.7%) were females. Weight (kilograms) was recorded for 32 individuals: 5 juveniles and 27 adults. All juveniles weighed < 11.3 kgs and the mean ± SD weight of the 12 adult males (47.1 ± 16.5) was significantly greater than that of the 15 adult females (25.4 ± 4.1; P < 0.001). All pigs were positive for at least one of the pathogens included in the study. Exposure to or infection with influenza A virus (IAV), Brucella, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, Babesia spp., transmissible gastroenteritis/porcine respiratory coronavirus and Trichinella spp. was rare or absent (Table 1 ). Based on antibody testing, a high percentage of pigs were exposed to Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia (APP; 93%), Lawsonia intracellularis (93%), and porcine parvovirus (94%). Exposure to multiple serotypes of APP was also common ( Table 2 ). Based on MAT testing, antibodies to four Leptospira serovars were detected in 11 pigs (Tables 1 and 3) , with some individuals having antibodies to more than one serovar. Kidney samples from nine pigs with Leptospira antibodies were negative for Leptospira antigens by IHC. Juvenile pigs had a significantly higher prevalence of antibodies to porcine circovirus type 2 (6/6 [100%]) compared with adults (10/ ; P = 0.017, respectively). There was no difference in prevalence between males and females for any pathogen. Only 38 pigs were examined for ectoparasites; lice (Hematopinus suis) and ticks (Amblyomma breviscutatum) were found on 12 (32%) and seven (18%) pigs, respectively. Lung samples from 32 pigs were examined histologically and eight (25%) were positive for Metastrongylus lungworms. Stephanurus dentatus were found in abdominal lesions from three pigs and one pig had a liver abscess with intralesional nematode larvae which could not be identified.
