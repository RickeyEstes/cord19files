We recruited 97 children and data from 96 children were analysed ( Figure 1 ). The major reason why 450 children did not meet the inclusion criteria was they did not require supplemental O 2 or were admitted over the weekend. During recruitment, 21 children admitted into intensive care were excluded; 17 were Indigenous. One participant was excluded from the analysis of primary outcomes; they had received a macrolide in the previous 7 days (this child was randomised to placebo). This child was included in the analysis of secondary outcomes. Of the 96 remaining children, demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between the treatment groups (Table-1) . No children received steroids during hospitalisation. Of the cohort, 10 children were previously hospitalised for a respiratory episode, all were Indigenous; 3 in azithromycin group and 7 in placebo group. When data were grouped by ethnicity, a higher proportion of Indigenous children lived in remote areas (n = 45, 74%; p = ,0.001), were exposed to cigarette smoke during pregnancy (n = 37, 61%; p = ,0.001), or in their household (n = 44, 72%; p = ,0.001). They were more likely to have coexisting comorbidities (i.e. skin infections (n = 17, 28%; p = 0.02) or secondary pneumonia (n = 13, 21%; p = 0.01). More Indigenous children (n = 34, 56%, p = ,0.001) received antibiotics prior to hospitalisation. The antibiotics given were ceftriaxone (n = 14, 41%), procaine penicillin (n = 7, 21%) and amoxicillin (n = 5, 15%). In hospital, additional antibiotics were more often prescribed in Indigenous children (n = 52, 85%, p = ,0.001) ( Table-1) . LOS was similar in both treatment groups. The median LOS in the azithromycin group was 54 hrs, compared to 58 hrs in the placebo group (difference between groups of 4 hrs, 95%CI 28, 13, p = 0.6), figure 2. The median time on O 2 in the azithromycin group was 35 hrs, compared to 42 hrs in the placebo group (i.e. reduction of 7 hrs 95%CI 29, 13, p = 0.7), figure 3. No child required admission into intensive care and there were no adverse or serious adverse events. All children contributed to readmission data. There was no significant difference in the number of respiratory readmissions within 6 months (10 per group, OR = 0.9, 95%CI 0.3, 2, p = 0.8) or time to readmission (logrank p = 0.9) between treatment groups (figure 4). 70% of children readmitted, were reported to have a wheeze-associated illness. Indigenous children (n = 61) had longer LOS; median 59 hrs compared to 51 hrs in non-Indigenous children (n = 35) (difference of 8 hrs, 95%CI -25, 1.5, p = 0.07). This was similar with duration of O 2 ; 43 hrs in Indigenous children and 35 hrs in non-Indigenous children (difference of 8 hrs 95%CI -22, 1.4, p = 0.08). A higher proportion of Indigenous children were readmitted for a respiratory illness (n = 16 (26%) compared to non-Indigenous children (n = 4 (11%)), difference 15% (95%CI 0, 30%) p = 0.05. Indigenous children were more likely to be re-hospitalised earlier (Indigenous n = 16, non-Indigenous n = 4, OR = 2.8, 95% CI 0.9, 8.8), logrank p = 0.08 (figure 5). There was no evidence that the difference in either LOS or O 2 between treatment groups varied according to ethnicity or age (table-2).
