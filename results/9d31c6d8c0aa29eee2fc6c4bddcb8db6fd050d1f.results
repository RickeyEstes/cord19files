In total, 19 VIOLET exercises were performed during the time available. After completing the scenarios, every volunteer had significant contamination on the outer surfaces of their PPE ensembles. Examples are shown in Figure 4 , with 4a showing heavy vomit contamination (blue fluorescence) and 4b showing all four body fluids e vomit, sweat (orange), cough (red) and diarrhoea (yellow). The cough mechanism failed on one occasion, but, once resolved, the exercise was run repeatedly and reproducibly. Some post-doffing contamination events were observed, with mechanisms identified by retrospective review of video footage. Full results of the contamination events and PPE analysis are presented and examined further in separate work by Hall et al. [30] . Although not a research objective, environmental screening revealed the medical equipment, e.g. stethoscope and thermometer, to be heavily contaminated after use. Of interest, yellow UV tracer (diarrhoea) was found on the back of the mannequin's head, and on the inside of a box of supposedly clean gloves in the patient's room. Participants successfully completed the different components of the exercise, asking relevant questions and performing all required procedural tasks with only occasional prompting. Volunteer feedback was positive, with participants stating that it was useful to practise in an unfamiliar and complex, but safe, environment. Many were surprised by the volume and distribution of contamination in the environment and on their PPE immediately after patient care, despite being aware of the occurrence of high-volume exposure episodes, such as projectile vomit, during the scenario.
