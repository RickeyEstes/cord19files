Recently we identified two small molecules which could amazingly inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3pro in non-competitive mode (19) (20) (21) : one is p-Nitrophenyl-p-guanidino benzoate (pNGB) ( Fig. 1A) , an active site inhibitor for both West Nile and Dengue protease (19) , while another is qucertin (Fig. 1B) , a natural product rich in many edible plant (Fig. 1C) . author/funder.

To insight into the structural details of possible binding pockets, we decided to dock two small molecules to Zika NS2B-NS3pro. The chemical structure of quercetin (ZINC Num: ZINC03869685) and pNGB (CAS Num: 19135-17-2) were downloaded from ZINC (http://zinc.docking.org) and ChemicalBook database (http://www.chemicalbook.com) respectively. Subsequently the chemical structures were then geometrically optimized with Avogadro [22] . The partial charges of all atoms in small compounds and Zika NS2B-NS3pro were assigned with Gasteiger-Marsili charges, and nonpolar hydrogen atoms were merged into the appropriate heavy atoms with AutoDockTools [23] . Fig. 2A and 2B , pNGB binds to a pocket on the back of the substrate-binding pocket which is occupied by cn-716, a very tight competitive inhibitor for Zika NS2B-NS3pro [24] . Furthermore, as seen in Fig. 2C , the pocket is located in between two subdomains of the chymotrypsin fold, with a hydrophobic pocket at the bottom, and the rest of surface negatively charged. author/funder.

Qucertin also bind to the small pocket as pNGB (Fig. 3) . This is further highlighted by Fig.4 . author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
