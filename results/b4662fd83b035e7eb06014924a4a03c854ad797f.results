Patterns of Seasonality. There was a distinct seasonality in diarrhoea occurrence in the total population ( Figure 1 ) and in each age group (Figures S1A-S1C (supplementary material)), and two peaks were observed every year. Specifically, diarrhoea in children ,5 years peaked in fall-winter seasons, and diarrhoea in persons .55 years peaked in summer ( Figure 2 ). Further, we found that the peak times in children (,15 years) varied greatly over time, while the peak times in adults (.515 years) was consistent across years (Figures S2A-S2F (supplementary material)). Figure 3 shows the seasonality of diarrhoea in different regions (listed by latitude), revealing that in both children ,5 years and persons .55 years, diarrhoea at higher latitudes were more likely to be peaking in summer, and diarrhoea at lower latitudes were more likely to be peaking in fall-winter seasons ( Figures 3A-C) . Analysis by season ( Figures S3A-3C (supplementary material) ) reveals this pattern more clearly. In terms of the amplitude distribution by age and region (seasonal amplitude refers to the relative fluctuation of diarrhoea within a certain period of time, and it provides pivotal information on the possibility of diarrhoea outbreaks), we found that adults (.515 years) had much greater diarrhoea amplitudes than children (,15 years) (Figure 4 ), but the amplitude in persons .520 years declined progressively with increasing age, reaching its valley in elderly .585 years (Figure 4) , and this decreasing trend was remarkably consistent across years ( Figure S4 (supplementary material)). Figures 5A-C depicts the spatial pattern of diarrhoea amplitude, indicating that, in persons .55 years, diarrhoea amplitudes at higher latitudes were greater than lower latitudes. Drivers of seasonality. To better understand whether there was a statistically significant relationship between latitude and diarrhoea seasonal parameters (peak time, trough time and amplitude), we calculated the Spearman correlations between them, and found that diarrhoea peak time and trough time were negatively correlated with latitude ( Figures 6A-D) . No significant correlation was observed between amplitude in children ,5 years and latitude, but amplitude in persons .55 years was positively correlated with latitude (r50.62, P,0.001) ( Figures 6E-F) . To identify the putative predictors of diarrhoea seasonality, we conducted regression tree analysis. Table 1 shows the summary statistics for the demographic, economic, and geographic characteristics, climatic factors, and diarrhoea seasonal parameters of the 31 pro- Epidemiological transmission zones. After identifying the latitudinal threshold for diarrhoea peak and trough times, we plotted the heat maps accordingly ( Figure 8A -C), and found that: At latitudes.
