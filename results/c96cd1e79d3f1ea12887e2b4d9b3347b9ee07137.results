Comparison of survival rates of mice in each group. The survival rate of the blank group and the control group at day 8 was 100%. A total of 11 mice in the VMC group died at day 8, with a survival rate of 45%. A total of 5 mice in the MG-132 group died at day 8, with a survival rate of 75%. The 8-day survival rates of the blank group and control group were significantly higher than those of the VMC group and MG-132 group, but the 8-day survival rate of mice in the MG-132 group was significantly higher than that of the VMC group (P<0.05) (Fig. 1) . Histopathological scores of myocardial tissues of mice in each group. There was no inflammatory cell infiltration in myocardial tissues of mice in blank or control group. There was a large amount of inflammatory cell infiltration in myocardial tissues of mice in VMC group. The inflammatory cells in the myocardial tissues of mice in MG-132 group were significantly reduced compared with those in VMC group. The myocardial histopathological scores of mice in blank and the control group were respectively 0.33±0.04 and 0.34±0.06, the myocardial histopathological score of mice in the VMC group was 1.85±0.11, and was 1.04±0.10 in the MG-132 group. The myocardial histopathological scores of mice in the blank and the control group were significantly lower than those in VMC and MG-132 group, and myocardial histopathological score of mice in MG-132 was significantly lower than that in VMC group (P<0.05) (Fig. 2) . Expression levels of mRNA of TNF-α and TGF-β1 in myocardial tissues of mice in each group. There was no significant Figure 1 . Comparison of survival rates of mice in each group. The survival rate of the blank group and the control group was 100%. The 8-day survival rates of the blank and control group were significantly higher than those of the VMC and MG-132 group, but the 8-day survival rate of MG-132 group was significantly higher than that of the VMC group, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). VMC, viral myocarditis. difference in expression levels of TNF-α mRNA and TGF-β1 mRNA between the blank group and the control group (P>0.05), but were significantly lower than those in the VMC group and the MG-132 group. However, expression levels of TNF-α mRNA and TGF-β1 mRNA in myocardial tissues of MG-132 group were significantly lower than those of the VMC group (P<0.05) (Table II) .
