The first set of MS2 loaded coupons was stored at 228C and 30% RH. MS2 survival was measured at 0, 8, and 20 hours. Figure 1 shows that the log 10 reduction of MS2 increased with time up to 20 hours for all respirator coupons except antimicrobial respirator D. All respirator coupons showed ,1-log 10 reduction even at 20 hours storage time. There was no significant difference (P . .05) in the log 10 reduction of MS2 between the control N95 FFR and the antimicrobial respirator coupons (A, B, C, and D) at 8 or at 20 hours. In the second set of experiments, MS2 loaded coupons were stored at 378C and 80% RH, and the log 10 reduction was measured at 0, 2, and 4 hours. Figure 2 shows that the log 10 reduction of MS2 increased with time for all the antimicrobial respirators and N95 FFR controls tested. MS2 reductions for coupons from antimicrobial respirators A and B were approximately 2log 10 units and were not significantly (P . .05) different from the control N95 FFR. At the same time, coupons from antimicrobial respirator C showed 3.7-log 10 reduction of MS2 at 4 hours of storage, which was significantly (P # .05) different from the N95 FFR control coupons. Coupons from antimicrobial respirator D were unable to be tested at the high RH conditions. Coupons from antimicrobial respirator C were compared with N95 control respirators for MS2 reduction at the 2 different storage conditions (Figs 1 and 2) . MS2 reduction was approximately 2-log 10 and 3.7-log 10 units (4 hours) at 378C and 80% RH for coupons from the control and antimicrobial respirator C, respectively. However, coupons from both the N95 FFR control and the antimicrobial respirators showed approximately ,1-log 10 MS2 reduction (8 hours) at 228C and 30% RH. To determine whether MS2 inactivation of respirator C was due to iodine released from respirator coupon, a control toxicity assay was performed. MS2 survival was found to be 6.27 6 0.03 and 6.23 6 0.10 log 10 units for the N95 control and respirator C, respectively, with no significant difference between them.
