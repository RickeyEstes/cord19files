Virus isolation and sequence analysis of spike gene A PEDV isolate was obtained from the field samples. The isolated virus was designated MZ0116-2/2013. MZ0116-2/2013 exhibited a distinct CPE characterized by cell fusion and syncytium formation as of passage 0. The isolate was further serially passaged in Vero cells for a total of 5 passages (P1 -P5). The isolate had a virus titer of 10 5.5 TCID 50 /ml at P5. The CPE was observed within 24 h post inoculation during the propagation process (Fig. 1a) . Phylogenetic analysis based on the spike gene sequences of 43 PEDV strains shows distribution between just 2 major branches that have or do not have INDEL. The non-INDEL strains constituted the first branch; the second branch contained INDEL strains. MZ0116-2/ 2013 strain has been confirmed to be in US prototypelike non-INDEL, genogroup 2 sublineage (Fig. 1b) . The PEDV spike protein plays important roles in interactions with cellular receptors during virus entry, growth adaptation in vitro, the induction of neutralizing antibodies and alteration of pathogenicity in vivo [16] . As shown in Fig. 2 , we compared the amino acid sequences of P-5V vaccine strain with the newly emerging strains. Previous studies of the PEDV spike protein have identified neutralizing COE region (498-637 aa), epitopes SS2 (747-754 aa), SS6 (763-770 aa), and 2C10 (1367-1373 aa) [17] [18] [19] . There was no difference in the epitopes SS2 and 2C10 between genogroup 1 and 2 viruses, however, two amino acid differences (Leu 763 and Asp 765 ) were found in the SS6 of P-5V compared to the genogroup 2 viruses. In the P-5V strain, four amino acids (Ala 516 , Thr 548 , Gly 593 , and Gln 632 ) were different from all genogroup 2 viruses, and one amino acid (Lys 620 ) was different from the MZ0116-2/2013 strain. The Spike protein is also known as a type I glycoprotein [20] , and the P-5V vaccine strain contains 22 potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The predicted N-linked glycosylation sites were very similar among genogroup 1 and 2 viruses,
