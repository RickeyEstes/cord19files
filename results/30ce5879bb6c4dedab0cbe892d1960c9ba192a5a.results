In a parallel study (Vascotto et al., submitted for publication), a library of V regions, derived from hyperimmune spleens from mice immunized with the rotavirus NSP5 protein, was created to select intracellular antibodies by IACT. The selection and the characterization of this library gave unexpected results: (i) Many antibodies against the NSP5 were isolated, and the sequences of anti-NSP5 antibody V regions obtained from the NSP5 antigen selections were often very similar to germline sequences (for VH or VK). (ii) The antibody library obtained from NSP5 immunized splenocytes was also found to contain many antibodies against different antigens, against which no immunization had been made. (iii) The selected intrabodies were found not to be promiscuous and to have high specificity. Moreover, the IAC technology has been shown previously, in one anecdotal example, to lead to the isolation of putative intracellular binders starting directly from a small na√Øve antibody library cloned in the two-hybrid vector (Portner-Taliana et al., 2000) , with no library preselection. The authors showed that using IAC technology it was possible to select one specific in vivo binder against their target antigen although no functional characterization of the selected intracellular antibody was provided. On the basis of these results, as well as on the basis of the considerations made in the previous section, we explored the possibility that a small but systematically very well-examined naive library of antibodies directly cloned in the two-hybrid vector could yield a good single pot library of intracellular binders.
