A total of 511 NPA were collected from 406 children: 381 samples were collected from 359 children in the paediatric ward and ICU, while 130 were collected from 47 infants in the NICU. Fiftyfive samples (10.7%) were positive for HBoV, with a higher prevalence between May and August. Ten of the HBoV infections were definitely or probably acquired in the hospital. Four infants had been in the NICU since birth (patients 1, 2, 3 and 10) while four infants admitted from the community had previously tested negative for HBoV (patients 4, 6, 7 and 9). One infant (patient 8) was in the paediatric ICU following liver transplantation and developed respiratory distress 28 days after admission. The final patient (patient 5) was in the paediatric ward being treated for visceral leishmaniasis and developed LRT infection 17 days after admission. The characteristics of the patients with hospital-acquired HBoV are described in Table I . Among the 45 presumed community-acquired HBoV infections, 23 (51.1%) were coinfected with at least one other respiratory virus, particularly adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (in nine cases each). Of the 10 hospital-acquired infections, only one was coinfected (adenovirus). Phylogenetic analysis of eight of the 10 HBoV amplicons revealed three different strains of HBoV group 1 with 99.6e99.8% similarity (Figure 1 ). Two amplicons (representing patients 8 and 10) were not sequenced.
