The Table 2 . Of particular interest were those specimens in which a double infection of an influenza virus together with other viruses was detected. In 13 samples 14 positive (and 2 questionable) results for other viruses were found associated with influenza virus. These associated viruses are listed below along with extra remarks about 2 samples that gave questionable results (100-150 MFI). • Adenovirus B and E -2 samples. These samples were passaged up to five times in MDCK 33016 PF cell as described in Section 2. In addition, sample 750 (compare Table 3 ) was also used for these passages, as it was questionably positive for bocavirus and contained influenza B. One other sample (sample 670, positive for coronavirus HKU1 in association with influenza virus B in the clinical specimen) could not be cultivated because there was not sufficient material. As shown in Table 3 , the only virus that was detectable after 2 (or 5) passages was influenza virus; the other contaminating viruses were lost during passage. The table also lists the total dilution of the original sample until passage 2 (10 −7 to 10 −9 ) and passage 5 (10 −22 to 10 −28 ). Only one sample (see sample 608 in Table 3 ), in which no virus could be recovered was passaged at lower dilutions. The order in which the detected viruses are listed in Table 3 reflects the counts found in the ResPlex method. Most co-infecting viruses had lower counts than the influenza virus. Sample 635 had highest counts for an enterovirus and similar counts for rhinovirus and influenza virus, sample 608 had higher counts for adenovirus than for influenza virus. However, it should be noted that the ResPlex method is not a quantitative method. In a similar way, samples with positive and questionable multiplex PCR results only for viruses other than influenza virus were also cultivated for 2 or 3 passages in MDCK 33016PF cells. As shown in Table 4 , only two passages usually were sufficient to eliminate the virus, so that almost all samples tested negative. Only three of the 54 viruses detected in the original sample still gave a very weak Resplex signal after the second cell culture passage: one coronavirus with a signal just above the questionable level and an enterovirus and one RSV at the questionable level. Considering the total dilution from the original sample to the second passage of only 2 × 10 4 , it is possible that the original sample contained more than 10 4 viruses and remained (weakly) positive during 2 passages without any virus growth. When tested after the third culture passage (representing a 1:10 dilution of the clinical sample, these three samples tested negative by Resplex II, indicating no virus growth and that the weakly positive test results from the 2nd passage were obviously due to residual virus from the original clinical sample. Table 5 shows the results of confirmatory test of clinical specimens using independent, conventional PCR methods.
