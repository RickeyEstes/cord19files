Among the 183 respiratory specimens initially included in the study, 5 were positive by the Luminex xTAG RVP v1 assay for human CoVs not included in the CLART® PneumoVir panel (CoV NL63, n = 2; CoV HKU1, n = 1; and CoV OC43, n = 2). These were excluded from the analyses described below. Thus, the final number of samples included for comparative purposes was 178. The total number of viruses detected by the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast assay and the CLART® PneumoVir both was comparable (n = 140 versus n =138, respectively; P = 0.92). Likewise, both methods performed comparably for detection of multiple infections (n = 29 versus n = 27, respectively; P = 0.94). Fully concordance was obtained for a total of 122/178 (68.5%) specimens (65 identical positive results and 57 samples yielding negative results in both assays). Thus, the overall rate of concordance was 80% (Kappa coefficient, 0.62). A single RV was detected in 54 out of the 65 specimens (83.0%) yielding concordant positive results. Two and 3 RVs were detected in 9 (13.8%) and 2 (3.0%) of these samples. Partially or fully discordant results were observed in 21/178 samples (11.8%) and 35/178 samples (19.6%), respectively. The latter discrepant results corresponded to 28 specimens testing negative by one method and positive by the other and 7 specimens testing positive by both methods but yielding different viral agents. It is of note that InfA H1N1/v was detected by the CLART® PneumoVir in 5 specimens. These specimens tested either negative (n = 2) or positive for InfA H1/N1 (n = 3) by the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v1 assay. A detailed description of discrepant results is shown in Table 2 . Table 3 shows the number of viral agents detected by each method. An excellent concordance (Kappa index N0.90) was found for hMPV, RSV, PIV-3, and PIV-4. Conversely, a suboptimal concordance (Kappa index b0.60) was found for InfA A/H1/N1 and picornaviruses (EV/Rh). The data clearly proved the superiority of the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v1 assay over the CLART® PneumoVir assay for detection of picornaviruses (P ≤ 0.001). In contrast, the CLART® PneumoVir method appeared to perform slightly better for detection of most of the other RVs included in the panels, although the differences did not reach statistical significance (Table 3 ). The performance of both assays was irrespective of either the origin of the respiratory specimen or the age group to which the patients belonged (data not shown). A total of 47 out of 56 specimens yielding discordant results were further analyzed by nested PCR coupled with automated sequencing. No sufficient volume for analysis was available from the remaining 9 specimens. The viral agent missed by either one or the other multiplex PCR assay was confirmed by the reference method in 41/47 specimens. In the remaining 6 specimens, the presence of 1 or more viral agents in respiratory specimens, as detected by one or the other method, could not be confirmed by the reference method and thus were considered false-positive results (Table 2) . Following resolution of discrepancies, the data indicated that the sensitivity of the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v1 assay was higher than of the CLART® PneumoVir assay for detection of picornaviruses (89.8% versus 59.3%). The opposite was true for Adv (90.0% vs. 100%), hBoV (80% versus 90%), InfB (66.7% versus 100%), 3/0 (2) 4/0 (1) 2/1 (2) 4/0 (3) InfA A/H1N1v 2/2 (2) -3/3 (3) -InfA A/H3N2 1/0 (1) 0 2/0 (0) 0 hMPV 1/1 (1) 0 1/1 (1) 0 PIV-1 1/0 (1) 1/0 (1) 0 0 PIV-2 1/1 (1) 0 0 0 PIV-3 1/0 (1) 0 1/0 (0) 0 RSV A-B 2/1 (1) 0 1/0 (0) 0 a Number of available specimens for confirmation by nested PCR coupled to sequencing.
