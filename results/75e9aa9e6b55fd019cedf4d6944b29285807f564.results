A total 17 samples were analyzed: the reference CCoV strain S378, five cell culture-adapted CCoV strains and eleven faecal samples of pups. PCR amplicons of the expected size were obtained with the primer pairs M5/ M6, p493-p247, p685/p670, p650/p652, p686/p687. Some pol regions of several faecal samples were not amplified, probably due to viral loads close to the sensitivity threshold of the RT-PCR assays. The observation that in vitro-grown isolates were amplifiable with all primer sets used (excepted 65/00-30 isolate that scored negative with pol 1a B primers) strengthened this hypothesis (Table 3 for the details). Multiple alignments showed that the studied sequences differed from each other, thus ruling out possible contaminations. Multiple nucleotide alignments deduced from pol 1a and pol 1b regions were straightforward, whereas those obtained from the M gene exhibited numerous insertions and deletions and needed to be refined by manual editing. Alignment of deduced amino acid sequences showed that the great majority of nonsynonymous substitutions were localized within the NH 2 -end ectodomain of the M protein. Although no consistent pattern was observed, all the insertions and deletions were in-frame and located in four defined positions. Moreover, initial direct inspection revealed that seven Italian samples analysed contained amino acid residues which were typical of FCoV isolates: Ile 0/ Val-128, Ile/Val 0/Ala-132, Val 0/Thr-178, Ile 0/Met-197, Asp 0/Glu-205, Asn 0/His-206, Lys 0/Gln-228, Asp 0/Glu-251 and Gln 0/His-260; thus highlighting the fact that these specimens contained coronavirus RNA with more deduced amino acid similarity to FCoV than to CCoV in this region (Fig. 2) . Phylogenetic relationships were inferred from the genetic distances by constructing phylogenetic trees using the distance-based methods NEIGHBOR-JOIN-ING and FITCH-MARGOLIASH, and the character-state method DNAML. For this analysis, distance values for the M gene were recalculated by trimming the ectodomain region (i.e. by reducing the sequence stretch analyzed from 835 to 681 bp) which did not allow precise phylogenetic inference because of its high heterogeneity (homoplasy). Trees were rooted by using the porcine TGEV isolate Purdue as an outgroup. To appraise the sensitivity of NEIGHBOR-JOINING to the input order of species, the program was run, in a pilot study, by using either fixed or multiple randomized orders of M sequences and by repeating the process ten times. The resulting trees differed slightly but phylogroups and outliers were identical (trees not shown). Since the randomizing option was time-consuming and did not influence segregation, NEIGHBOR-JOINING trees were produced from a fixed order of bootstrapped sequences only and by using the multiple data set option (100 reiterations). Branch lengths were then calculated from the consensus trees using FITCH-MARGO-LIASH. Topologies of trees from all of the genomic regions analyzed were very similar, the major phylogenetic lineages defining the FCoV and CCoV genotypes were delineated clearly and generally supported by high bootstrap values. Irrespective of the genome portion analyzed, the CCoV strains Insavc, S378, 45/93, 257/98, A-2/99, 144/01 and 65/00-30, and FCoV TN406 and UCD1, clustered into different phylogroups. Both the FCoV type II isolates segregated together with the CCoV isolates when analyzed for pol 1b (region D); when analyzed for pol 1b (region C) only the FCoV 79-1683 strain segregated with CCoV. The Italian samples analyzed segregated in two different clusters, indicating a distinct genetic related- Table 3 List of the viruses analysed in this study: the genome fragments successfully amplified and sequenced are indicated (Fig. 3a) . Although the number of samples analyzed was smaller and the bootstrap values were lower than for the M gene, the segregation pattern of Italian samples was observed consistently also when analyzed in pol 1b-region D (Fig. 3e) . The topology of the trees built with the other genome stretches shown confirmed the presence of typical CCoV strains and CCoVs that could not be assigned to either CCoV or FCoV genotypes, although these samples did not fall within a single branch but were dispersed into smaller clusters and located between the outgroup strain and samples belonging to FCoV genotype (Fig. 3b√Å/d) . Similar findings were also observed by analyzing the amino acid sequences (data not shown). Altogether, these results suggested that outlier samples may have undergone partly separate evolutions from typical CCoV strains.
