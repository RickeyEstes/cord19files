60 healthy individuals were enrolled into clinical trial VRC 306 between Nov 17, 2008, and Nov 16, 2009 (fi gure 1). To directly compare vaccine regimens with a 24-week boost interval, a follow-up clinical trial (VRC 310) was initiated, and 21 individuals were enrolled between March 8, 2010, and May 13, 2010. Groups A and B were enrolled in VRC 310 to expand on the fi ndings in VRC 306 (fi gure 1). The demographic characteristics were similar between groups (webappendix p 4). The vaccines were well tolerated, and no vaccine-related serious adverse events were recorded. When present, reactogenicity was mild to moderate in severity (webappendix pp 5-6). Antigen-specifi c T-cell responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining at 4 weeks after the MIV boost in each group. CD4 (interleukin 2 or interferon γ) T-cell responses to H5 were detected by intracellular cytokine staining more frequently in individuals who received two doses of DNA than in those who did not receive DNA priming (p<0·05) and CD4 responses were more frequently observed than CD8 T cell responses, which were only detected in two individuals in the study (webappendix p 2). Antibody responses were assessed at 2-4 weeks after the MIV boost. All individuals were negative for H5 antibodies by HAI at baseline (table 1) . After MIV boost, the frequency of positive H5 (Indo) HAI responses was greatest when the boost interval was longer (groups 3, 4, and B, table 1). The HAI titre (geometric mean titre [GMT]) was highest in individuals who received DNA priming and were boosted at the longest interval (groups 3, 4, and B; fi gure 2A and 2D). H5 binding antibodies assessed by ELISA were present in most individuals after the boost, and the magnitude of the GMT of ELISA responses (table 2) was highest in DNA primed individuals boosted after the longer 24-week interval (groups 3, 4, and B; fi gure 2B and E, and table 2). Neutralising antibodies to the H5 were detected in most individuals, and the greatest magnitude of response was also seen in the same groups, (groups 3, 4, and B; fi gure 2C and F and table 2). To assess whether stem-directed neutralising antibodies were elicited, we analysed individuals for the presence of anti-stem antibodies before or after immunisation as previously described. 16 Sera were fi rst absorbed with 293 cells expressing the stem mutant of the H5 (Indo) haemagglutinin to remove non-stem directed antibodies, and then tested their binding affi nity to wild-type H5 (Indo) haemagglutinin. 16 Figure 3A shows vaccine-induced anti-stem antibodies for three representative individuals (one individual each from groups 2, 3, and 4) to illustrate these fi ndings of a fi ve-times increase in binding after immunisation (fi gure 3A). We confi rmed the specifi city of these antisera using a competition ELISA assay in which haemagglutinin binding was done in the presence of 9E8 (anti-head) or F10 (anti-stem) antibodies. In this assay, binding to haemagglutinin was inhibited by the anti-stem antibody F10 but not the control anti-head antibody 9E8 (fi gure 3A). We assessed the ability of the sera from these individuals to neutralise heterologous strains of virus on an unmatched distant low pathogenicitiy H5N2 (A/mallard/Pennsylvania/ 12180/1984, 1984 Penn) and on a diff erent subtype, H9N2 (A/Hong Kong/1074/1999, 1999 HK) in three representative individuals (fi gure 3B). Post-immune but not pre-immune sera neutralised the unrelated 1984 Penn virus and two of these individuals also neutralised the alternative subtype 1999 HK virus (fi gure 3C), documenting the increased breadth of these immune sera. Furthermore, wild-type H5 (Indo) haemagglutinin but not ΔStem trimer protein blocked neutralisation against each strain (fi gure 3B, C; lower panels, wildtype vs ΔStem), again showing that anti-stem neutralising antibodies were induced by vaccination in these individuals (webappendix pp [7] [8] . When comparing all regimens by combining data from groups in VRC 306 and VRC 310 by boost interval, HAI titres did not diff er in those who received two doses of MIV regardless of interval (fi gure 4). DNA priming with a 24-week boost interval induced a four-to-nine-fold increase in HAI titres (VRC 306+VRC 310 data) above DNA priming with a 4-week interval (fi gure 4 and table 1). A second DNA prime did not signifi cantly increase the magnitude of HAI titre after MIV boosting at week 24 (fi gure 4).
