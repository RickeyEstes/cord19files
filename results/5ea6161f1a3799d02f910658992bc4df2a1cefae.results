Eight hundred thirty-five infants and young children met the study criteria. RVRT-PCR was performed on 769 (92%) of the participants. RVRT-PCR was not performed on 66 patients due to parental refusal or because the laboratory in our hospital does not run this specific test during the nights or weekends. RSV was positive in 352 (45.7%) children admitted with clinical bronchiolitis. In addition, no viruses were identified in 142 (18.4%), while respiratory viruses other than RSV were found in 275 (35.7%) of children. Among the respiratory viruses other than RSV, rhinovirus constituted one third of the total followed by adenovirus (14%), parainfluenza virus type 4 (14%), bocavirus (10%), coronavirus (7%), H1N1 (3.4%), parainfluenza virus type 1 (3.4%), parainfluenza virus type 2 (3.4%), and parainfluenza virus type 3 (3.4%). More boys than girls were admitted with acute bronchiolitis, the male-to-female ratio being 1.6:1 (39.2% girls and 60.8% boys) with mean age at diagnosis being 3.61±3.56 months, ranging from 0.33 to 24 months. The mean gestational age was 37.01±3.37, with less than one fifth of the total participants were born at gestational age fewer than 35 weeks. A seasonal trend for the RSV isolation rate was evident (Figure 1) , showing annual peaks in the months of October, November, December, and January, with a significant test for seasonality (test statistics [T] =3.15, P=0.009). Figure 1 clearly shows that there has been a steady and periodic seasonal variation in the RSV rate over the study period. The series exhibited several peaks; aside from the small range fluctuations, the significant peak appeared to be separated by more than a few months. It shows a seasonal pattern as the peak of RSV cases follows a similar pattern with an interval of few months between the peaks. The mean duration of hospital stay (Figure 2 ) was 8±7.9 days (median 6 days, range 1-71 days). The LOS (We were not able to verify the LOS in all patients. The reason is attributed to the fact that some families refused to allow the infant to be discharged from the hospital until he/she was "100%" back to baseline. Another common reason is that the patients might stay in the hospital for other concomitant illnesses) in hospital was found to be significantly higher among children in group C (9.3±9.8) compared to group B (7±6.3) and group
