We collected 142 environmental samples (66 and 76 samples in the Hajj 2016 and 2018 respectively, 75 samples at Mecca, 48 at Mina, 8 at Arafat and 11 at Medina) (Supplementary data). A total of 70 samples (49.3%) were positive for at least one respiratory pathogen (Supplementary data). Among the positive samples, K. pneumoniae was the most common bacterium that tested positive (57.1%), followed by S. pneumoniae (12.9%), S. aureus (10.0%) and H. influenzae (7.1%). In addition, 32.9% positive samples tested positive for HRV and 1.4% for HCoV. No sample was positive for influenza virus A and B or HPIV (Fig. 1) . Overall, the prevalence of positive surfaces was 28.2% for K. pneumoniae, 16.2% for HRV and 6.3% for S. pneumoniae. Of the 70 positive samples, 12 were positive for more than one pathogen, including 9 positive samples for K. pneumoniae and one or two other mostly bacterial pathogens and 3 samples with various associations of bacteria other than K. pneumoniae (Supplementary data). Surfaces with the highest rates of K. pneumoniae positive samples were kitchen tables (80.0%), ice reserves (76.9%), edge of water coolers lid (62.5%) and bathroom and ablution equipments (60.0%). Surfaces with the highest rates of HRV positive samples were door handles (40.9%), while those with the highest rates of S. pneumoniae positive samples were tent parts (40.0%) and water fountain faucets (60.0%) ( Table 1) . By comparing the distribution of respiratory pathogens by geographical area where samples were collected, Mina positivity rates were significantly higher than in other areas for most pathogens and including multiple contaminations by several pathogens. Of note, all samples positive for S. pneumoniae were collected at Mina (p < 0.0001) ( Table 2 ).
