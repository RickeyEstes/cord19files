Following i.c. injection of mice with 1000 pfu of MHV-A59, both groups of mice developed an acute disease, consisting of acute hepatitis and encephalitis, as seen histologically. Viral titers in the brain and liver were not significantly different in the two groups of mice (Fig. 1) . By day 30 postinfection, both the MHV-A59-infected CD28 À /À mice and the wild-type CD28+/+ mice exhibited the same degree of mild symptoms of chronic paralytic demyelinating disease. All five CD28 À / À mice injected with 1000 pfu of MHV-A59 developed chronic demyelinating lesions in 28/ 92 of the spinal cord quadrants, as did all five normal B6 mice in 35/88 spinal cord quadrants following injection with the same dose of virus.
