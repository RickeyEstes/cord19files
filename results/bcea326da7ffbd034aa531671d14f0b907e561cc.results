The mean toad serum antibody titres, S.E.M. and ranges in the control and C. fasciculuta -injected groups, together with the number of sera-containing detectable antibodies, are given in Table 1 . The mean value, range in titres and number of animals in which antibodies were detected were lowest for the CFT and highest by ELISA. Of the 29 control and 38 parasiteinjected toads, 93 and 92%, respectively contained antibodies detectable by ELISA. When all four immunological assays were applied to each individual serum, in all cases antibodies were detected by at least two or more of the methods used. However the background 'positive antibody' titres in the control animals ranged from 0 to 2-j depending on the technique employed. Therefore values higher than 2-' were considered to be positive for the parasiteinjected toads. Furthermore comparisons between control and immune sera for each method revealed significant differences in antibody titres (P< 0.01; Student's t-test). Moreover, 'antibody' levels were not significantly different between the two control groups (P> 0.05). The titres against L. hertigi and T. brucei varied from 0 to 2-j and from 0 to 2-1 in the control and immune sera, respectively. The results for each technique were compared in turn with those for the other methods and the half matrix of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients (r) calculated for all experimental animals ( Table 2 ). The significance of each r value was tested by the t-test. In the case of the control sera, r values ranging from 49 to SY% (P< 0.01) were calculated whilst overall higher correlations were determined for sera from immune animals which varied from 82 to 99% (all I'< 0.00 1). In order that the results of the present study can be used by other investigators for comparative purposes with different experimental models, regression formulae to convert the antibody titres as determined for each technique to those of another are given in Table 3 . The regression equations, based on the rectilinear relationship Y = mX + c, were only calculated for the highest mean titre found for each of the four immunological methods.
