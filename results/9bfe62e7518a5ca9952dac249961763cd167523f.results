During the 7-year study period (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) , 492 037 all-cause ARI cases were recorded, representing 8.3% from a total of 5 922 770 clinical visits. Of note was an inverse relationship between age and the predominance of ARI diagnoses; 27.2% of visits for children (ages 0-4) included an ARI diagnosis as compared with 3.8% of visits for adults age 65 years and older (see Table 2 ).
