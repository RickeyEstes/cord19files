Thirty-three children, 12 girls and 21 boys with a median age of 10 months (range 4-38 m), were assessed because of unexplained persistent wheezing despite ICS therapy. Administrated ICS dosages ranged from 100-500 mcg fluticasone daily or equivalent, with a variable treatment duration of 1-10 months. Table 1 summarises the characteristics of the study population with respect to allergy and reflux testing results, and familial and environmental risk factors for asthma. Only 7 of 13 (53.8 %) children suffering from gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), were treated for GERD prior to FOB + BAL. None of the children were treated with antibiotics in the 7 days prior to FOB + BAL. The FOB + BAL procedure was well tolerated in all children. Significant bacterial cultures were found in 16 of 33 (48.5 %) children (Table 2) . No significant differences in the number of positive BAL-cultures were seen in children with or without GERD. Aerobic bacteria were isolated as sole pathogen in 11 of 33 (33.3 %) cases. Mixed bacterial-viral infection and mixed bacterial-atypical infection were found in 4 of 33 (12.1 %) and in 1 of 33 (3.0 %) cases, respectively ( Table 2) . Considering only significant bacterial BAL-cultures, Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae), isolated from 10 of 33 (30.3 %) children, was the predominant bacteria found, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) and Moraxella catarrhalis (M. catarrhalis) ( Table 2 ). Bacterial co-infection was found in 5 of 33 (15.2 %) cases, including H. influenzae in 4 of these; twice with S. pneumoniae, once with M. catarrhalis and once with both S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis, and 1 co-infection with Staphylococcus aureus and Serratia marcescens ( Table 2) . Respiratory viruses were detected in 7 of 32 (21.9 %) cases, with predominance of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) ( Table 2 ). In 3 of 32 (9.4 %) cases the respiratory virus was the sole pathogen detected ( Table 2) . Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected in 1 of 19 cases, in a mixed infection with H. influenzae (Table 2) . Capsular typing of H. influenzae isolates revealed that all 10 isolates were non-encapsulated strains (NTHi). All 10 NTHi strains were evaluated for misidentification of non-haemolytic H. haemolyticus, and all were proven true NTHi. Nine of ten (90 %) NTHI isolates were β-lactamase negative and susceptible to ampicillin (MIC ≤ 1μg/ml) and cefuroxime (MIC ≤ 1μg/ml) [16] . The latter isolate was β-lactamase positive, with a MIC = 2μg/ml for amoxicillin-clavulanate and MIC = 3μg/ml for cefuroxime. The 4 S. pneumoniae isolates were fully susceptible to penicillin and belonged to serogroups; ST 6, ST 9, ST 11 and ST 19. Susceptibility based antibiotic treatment in patients with a significant BAL-culture is routine in our centre. In general, antibiotics are administered orally for 10 days (daily dose: 50-75 mg/kg for amoxicillin or amoxicillinclavulanate). 7 Of 16 (43,8 %) patients responded well to treatment, in 3 of 16 (18,8 %) no change in symptoms was noted, and data were missing for 6 patients. In 4 of 7 (57,1 %) responders however, symptoms relapsed within 2-3 weeks after completion of the antibiotic treatment. In one of these patients, FOB + BAL was repeated 70 days after the initial procedure. NTHi (>10 5 colony forming units (cfu)/ml) that was present as sole pathogen in the first BAL fluid was cultured again together with S. pneumoniae (>10 5 cfu/ml). The Total cell count (TCC) in BAL-fluid was high (median: 1055.5/mm 3 , IQR: 544.5/mm 3 -2099.75/mm 3 ) and differential cytology revealed a neutrophilic inflammation in 24 of 28 (85.7 %) patients. Patients with a positive bacterial BAL-culture, had a significantly higher TTC (median 1893.5/mm 3 , IQR 829.7/mm 3 -3479.5/mm 3 versus 787.0/mm 3 , IQR 283.5/ mm 3 -1439.5/mm 3 ; p = 0.023) compared to patients with a negative BAL-culture. Cytology of BAL-fluid differed significantly between patients with NTHi isolated from BAL and patients with a negative BAL-culture (Table 3 ).
