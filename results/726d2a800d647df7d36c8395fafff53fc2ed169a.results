On March 8 (day 0), the patient-a 73-year-old man from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates-abruptly developed fl u-like symptoms, with fever and non-productive cough. He was admitted to Mafraq hospital (Abu Dhabi) on day 2 (fi gure 1), and was diagnosed with pneumonia. He was intubated on day 9 because of progressive hypoxia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (fraction of inspired oxygen 60%; positive end-expiratory pressure 10 cm H 2 O). The patient had received intensive antimicrobial treatment with meropenem, levofl oxacin, vancomycin, caspofungin, aciclovir, and oseltamivir during his stay in an intensive care unit in Abu Dhabi, without major improvement in his pulmonary function. The patient was transferred to Klinikum Schwabing (Munich, Germany) on March 19, 2013 (fi gure 1). The patient had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment in the previous few years, such as high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation in 2009. At relapse of his multiple myeloma in November, 2012, he was given lenalidomide plus dexamethasone. Relatives reported that the patient owned camels, and had taken care of a diseased animal shortly before onset of symptoms. No animal samples, or further details about potential sources or exposures could be retrieved. During his stay in Munich, we recorded thrombocytopenia (table 1) . Thrombocytopenia was also reported in the fi rst described case of MERS-CoV infection, 1 in two of four patients from a family cluster in Saudi Arabia, 12 and in the two cases reported from France. 5 The patient developed renal insuffi ciency on day 14, and required dialysis. Despite continuous invasive ventilation and antibiotic treatment, the patient's health status deteriorated. Death occurred on day 18 and was due to septic shock, with signs of haemolysis and acute coagulation disorder (fi gure 1, table 1). After hospital admission in Munich, infection with MERS-CoV was suspected on the basis of treatment-refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome, combined with the geographical origin of the patient. Bronchoalveolar fl uid was obtained on March 20 and 22 (days 12 and 14). MERS-CoV was detected in both samples by RT-PCR. We also detected herpes simplex virus type 1 DNA 13 (6·4 × 10⁴ to 1·9 × 10⁷ copies per mL) and rhinovirus RNA 14 (3·7 × 10⁵ to 2·1 × 10⁹ copies per mL) by (RT-)PCR in both samples. MERS-CoV RNA concentrations in respiratory samples ranged from 933 to 1·2 × 10⁶ genome copies per mL. Virus concentrations seemed to be higher in samples taken earlier in the course than in those obtained later (fi gure 2). Concentrations were more variable in tracheobronchial samples than in bronchoalveolar lavage samples (fi gure 2), which was ascribed to variation in volumes of saline solution applied during removal of tracheobronchial samples. Notably, suction catheters without opening at point of care and stored for as long as 5 days at 8°C in a refrigerator in the intensive care unit tested consistently positive but yielded up to roughly 3·5log 10 lower RNA concentrations than did those in fresh tracheobronchial aspirates taken on the same days (fi gure 2). Immunofl uorescence assays yielded endpoint titres on day 16 of infection (table 2 ). An IgM-specifi c immunofl uorescence assay confi rmed recent infection in the same serum sample (table 2) . Plaque-reduction neutralisation test confi rmed MERS-CoV specifi city of detected antibody titres (table 2) . These titres were somewhat lower than those recorded for serum samples from an unlinked non-fatal case of MERS-CoV treated in Germany in 2012. 8 Serum samples from this patient had been taken later than they were for our patient (table 2) . We tested two urine samples on day 12, one on day 13, and one on day 16. One of the two samples on day 12, and the sample from day 13 were positive, meaning that the virus was not present in urine after renal failure (day 14), with a maximum virus concentration of 2691 RNA copies per mL on day 13. Both stool samples obtained on day 12 and the fi ve on day 16 were positive, with up to 1031 RNA copies per g, which is a concentration close to the lowest detection limit of the assay. We recorded a low virus concentration in one of two oronasal aspirate samples taken from the intubated patient on day 16 (5370 copies per mL). One dialysate sample and two serum samples on day 16 , and one serum sample on day 18 were negative. Although we obtained several isolates for the herpes simplex virus type 1, repeated attempts to isolate MERS-CoV were unsuccessful. Herpes simplex virus is a frequent bystander infection in intubated patients, and is known to not aff ect the cardiorespiratory prognosis and outcome. 15 We sequenced the full MERS-CoV genome directly from respiratory samples (GenBank accession number KF192507). We subjected all available MERS-CoV genome sequences to phylogenetic analysis, including a correlation and regression analysis of known dates of virus isolation versus tree branch lengths (fi gure 3). We estimated the rate of evolution as 1·6 × 10 -³ substitutions per site per year. The time of the common ancestor of all fi ve viruses for which genomes are available was halfway through 2011 (fi gure 3). The virus in our patient clustered with a sequence from a virus imported into the UK from Qatar. 16 To compare this sequence with that of another virus from the same region, we reanalysed a stored clinical sample from another case of MERS-CoV infection imported into Germany in October, 2012. This sample contained low concentrations of RNA, so the genome of the virus had not been successfully sequenced previously. 8 After many attempts to recover RT-PCR fragments from the available bronchoalveolar lavage sample, we could sequence 12 fragments, covering 4012 nucleotides of the MERS-CoV genome (GenBank accession number KC875821). A concatenated alignment of homologous sequence portions of all available MERS-CoV sequences was subjected to phylogenetic analyses, confi rming a clustering of sequences from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (fi gure 3). A sequence from a patient with a history of travel to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia branched next to this cluster. During and up to 10 days after the course of treatment, 14 health-care workers who had direct contact with our patient or patient-derived materials reported mild respiratory symptoms. Samples were taken from the upper respiratory tract and tested by two diff erent RT-PCR assays for MERS-CoV. None yielded positive results. By contrast, one patient who had had direct contact with the patient with MERS-CoV was infected with HCoV-NL63, a common human coronavirus, and four patients were infected with rhinoviruses. These rhinoviruses were not all mutually related, and none was related to the rhinovirus detected in the patient with MERS-CoV (appendix). Follow-up of all contact patients, including investigation for subclinical infections, is in progress.
