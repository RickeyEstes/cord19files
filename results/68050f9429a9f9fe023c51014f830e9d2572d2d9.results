Clinical data for 23 patients, including protopathy, corticosteroid type, corticosteroid dosage, time of pain onset, location of initial pain, time of initial MRI, and time of final diagnosis, are summarized in Table 1 . Average time between steroid therapy and first MRI examination was 45.7 ± 25.5 days (range, 10-94 days). Average time between steroid administration and final diagnosis was 199.9 ± 165.8 days (range, 32-762 days). At the second MRI examination, 12 hips had progressed to stage III, 22 hips had progressed to stage II, and 4 hips had progressed to stage I. In this study, 21/23 patients complained of discomfort after receiving steroid therapy but presented normal results at their first MRI examinations. Two patients did not experience any pain and underwent their first MRI examinations to screen for ONFH. Of the 21 patients who complained of discomfort, the average time from steroid administration to pain onset was 30.7 ± 24.4 days (range, 4-81 days), to the first MRI examination was 45.5 ± 26.6 days (range, 10-94 days), and to final diagnosis was 199.7 ± 173.6 days (range, 32-762 days). Time intervals were similar for male and female patients ( Table 2 ). All 21 patients were misdiagnosed initially because the first MRI examination results were normal. One patient received a lumbar discectomy. Among the 21 patients who complained of pain, 9 patients had continuous pain, and 12 patients had intermittent pain. Pain presented relatively later in the continuous pain cases, although these patients were diagnosed at an earlier time point than the intermittent pain cases (Table 3 ).
