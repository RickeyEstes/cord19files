The For adults aged between 26 and 45 years, a clear seasonal pattern of R values was observed after 2012, which showed a similar trend to that observed in children. In 2014 and 2015, the estimated annual peaks of R were 1.24 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.33) and 1.20 (95% CI: 1.01 to 1.39) respectively. Given that the R peak of the entire population was significantly above unity in 2016, adults aged 26-45 years had the largest contribution to measles transmissions. S1 Fig shows the sensitivity of the results to the use of contact matrices from other countries [23] . In general, the major findings were robust with the variation of contact patterns, for example, children aged 0-6 years still had a large contribution in measles transmissions after 2012. Nevertheless, due to a difference in contact frequency, larger estimates were observed for children aged 0-8 months and 9-19 months when using the contact matrix of Germany. Moreover, while using Poland's contact matrix drew a lower estimates for children aged 0-8 We also investigated using a different set of parameters for the distribution of the serial interval, and found that the results were generally consistent with the main analysis (S2 Fig). The R values of children groups were slightly increased, whereas the R values of adult groups were slightly decreased.
