The Evolutionary History of Bacterial tRNA Modifications Is Highly Dynamic We determined the occurrence of tRNA modifications across 1093 bacteria using homology searches for complete protein sequences of previously described MEs (see Materials and Methods). We assume that detected homologs are functional, and have the same modification function as that of the previously described enzymes. Within each modification pathway, we focused on the following enzymes that directly modify the tRNA and complete the modification (see Materials and Methods), and whose absence should effectively prevent the modification: (1) MnmE-MnmG for the (c)mnm 5 (s 2 )U modification, (2) CmoA-CmoB for the cmo 5 U modification, (3) Tgt-QueA-QueG-QueH for the Q modification, (4) TadA for the I modification, and (5) TilS for the k 2 C modification. Note that in our analysis, we did not consider GU wobble pairing, which is not mediated by specific modification enzymes. We observed that except for TilS (found in 98.18% of the studied bacteria), most MEs are not found in many bacteria ( fig. 1A) , suggesting that different modification pathways were gained or lost in specific lineages. The essential proteins RpoB and RplA (positive controls) were respectively present in 99.5% and 99.7% of analyzed bacteria, indicating that our homology detection method resulted in very few false negatives. When multiple enzymes are necessary for a modification, they tend to co-occur in bacterial lineages ( fig. 1A ). For instance, both MnmE and MnmG are absent only in Actinobacteria. Similarly, both CmoA and CmoB are primarily observed in c-proteobacteria and e-proteobacteria. However, this contradicts previous reports showing that the cmo 5 U modification is also active in Bacillus subtilis and Mycobacterium bovis str. BCG (Murao et al. 1976; Yamada et al. 2005; Chionh et al. 2016) . Despite an extensive search, we could not reliably identify the reported enzymes in the sequences of any other organisms (see Materials and Methods for details). Hence, here we focus on the proteobacterial cmo 5 U modification. In contrast to the co-occurrence of CmoA and CmoB, for the Queuosine modification, we found that QueG is often missing even when Tgt and QueA are present. However, 244 of these species had the QueH enzyme ( fig. 1B) , which was recently shown to function as a nonorthologous replacement for QueG (Zallot, Ross, et al. 2017) . The relative evolutionary instability of QueG corroborates a recent report suggesting that in some bacteria, Tgt alone may be enough to generate the Q modification (Zallot, Yuan, et al. 2017) . To determine the key evolutionary changes in major tRNA modification pathways across bacteria, we performed ancestral reconstruction with stochastic character mapping for each ME ( fig. 1A ; supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). We used a posterior probability value of ! 0.7 to assign the ME state at each internal node in the bacterial phylogeny. Four of the five modification systems-MnmE-MnmG, Tgt-QueA-QueG-QueH, TadA, and TilS-were predicted to occur at the root of the phylogenetic tree; that is, they were already present in the eubacterial ancestor ( fig. 1B ). In contrast, CmoA-CmoB were gained/evolved much later: once at the root of c-proteobacteria, once in e-proteobacteria, and once in some species of d-proteobacteria ( fig. 1B ). However, given experimental evidence for functional cmo 5 U modification in species such as B. subtilis and M. bovis (Yamada et al. 2005; Chionh et al. 2016 ) that do not have well-supported homologs to the proteobacterial cmo 5 U genes, it is possible that the modification was ancient and the responsible genes diverged significantly in different bacterial lineages. Alternatively, these enzymes may have nonorthologous genes in the ancestor. However, we could not test these hypotheses because the relevant ME genes in these species are not known. Thus, in general, we suggest that most bacterial tRNA modifications are ancient. These ancient modifications were then independently lost multiple times, with a total of 12 major losses (on branches with at least 5 descendant bacterial species in our phylogeny; fig. 1B ) and 19 minor loss events (in lineages with fewer than five descendants; supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online). The only exception to this pattern of repeated ME gains/losses is the k 2 C modification (TilS), which appears to be evolutionarily stable across bacteria. Overall, The Evolutionary History and Impact of Bacterial tRNA Modifications . doi:10.1093/molbev/msy110 tRNA Modification Loss Is Associated with More Nontarget tRNAs The early evolution of nearly all tRNA modifications suggests that the eubacterial ancestor should have been able to decode most sense codons using only a subset of all possible tRNAs. Indeed, ancestral reconstruction of tRNA genes suggests that the eubacterial ancestor did have all target tRNAs (except tRNA UUU Leu ), but did not possess nontarget tRNAs for the Q, k 2 C, and I modifications ( fig. 1C ; note that the state of tRNA UCG Arg is ambiguous). Interestingly, for the (c)mnm 5 (s 2 )U modification, both target and nontarget tRNA were present in the eubacterial ancestor. Thus, a subsequent loss of any of these modifications should be strongly associated with the gain [or retention, in case of (c)mnm 5 (s 2 )U] of the respective nontarget tRNA. Both predictions were supported when we observed that the proportion of species that have nontarget tRNA is significantly different between bacteria with versus without a specific modification (P < 0.05, two-sample proportions test; supplementary fig. S2, Supplementary Material online). Overall, these patterns suggest that the loss of tRNA modifications was associated with the retention or secondary gain of nontarget tRNAs, and the gain of MEs was associated with the loss of nontarget tRNAs. To account for phylogenetic relationships between analyzed bacteria, we compared the tRNA gene content of sister clades with contrasting modification status; that is, following a major modification gain or loss event (see Materials and Methods; fig. 2 ). For instance, since the (c)mnm 5 (s 2 )U modification was lost at the root of Actinobacteria (MnmE/ MnmG enzymes, fig. 1B ), we compared the tRNA gene content of species within the Actinobacteria clade with that of species in the sister group: the Cyanobacteria-Deinococcus-Thermus (CDT) clade. Similarly, we compared the target and nontarget tRNA gene copy numbers for descendent sister clades for 14 of the 15 major modification gain and loss events highlighted in figure 1B (we did not analyze Thermotogae, because its sister clade would consist of all other bacteria). Of these, four cases involving the Q modification are not informative with regard to nontarget tRNAs because these are absent in all bacteria (fig. 2F-I). Although the biochemical or evolutionary causes for the absence of these nontarget tRNA remain unknown, theoretically these tRNAs could exist, given the possible anticodon space. Therefore, we consider them in our analysis since they are useful for understanding the evolution of target tRNAs for the Q modification. In most of the informative sister clade comparisons (8 out of 10 cases), species were more likely to have nontarget tRNAs if the modification was absent (compare bottom left vs. bottom right bar plots within each panel of fig. 2 ), supporting our hypothesis that modification loss (gain) is associated with the presence (absence) of nontarget tRNAs. For instance, in three out of the five comparisons made for the (c)mnm 5 (s 2 )U and cmo 5 U modifications, at least five of the six nontarget tRNAs were present in a significantly higher proportion of species without the modification ( fig. 2A , C, and D; P < 0.05, twosample proportions test). The two exceptions to this pattern occur in clades with relatively low sample sizes ( fig. 2B and E), and may potentially reflect low statistical power. Alternatively, these may be biologically interesting exceptions that require further examination. Additionally, in all five comparisons made for the I modification, at least one nontarget tRNA (in most cases both) was present in significantly more species without the modification, compared with species with the modification (fig. 2J-N; P < 0.05, two-sample proportions test). In contrast to the wide variation in the occurrence of nontarget tRNAs, we found that target tRNA genes were largely stable irrespective of species' modification status (top row in each panel of fig. 2 ). Contrary to expectation, the gain or loss of the (c)mnm 5 (s 2 )U and cmo 5 U modifications does not appear to have any impact on target tRNAs (fig. 2A-E; P > 0.05, two-sample proportions test); likely because the corresponding codons are still used in these species and cannot be decoded by nontarget tRNAs. In the case of the Q modification, target tRNAs were always present; but in two of four comparisons their copy number was lower in clades that had lost the ME (fig. 2F-I; P < 0.05, two-sample proportions test). Inosine presents the only evidence supporting weakened selection on target tRNAs upon ME loss. In three of five comparisons, target tRNAs were absent in nearly all species without the modification ( fig. 2J-L) . In the remaining two comparisons, target tRNAs were present in fewer species without modifications (fig. 2M and N; P < 0.05, twosample proportions test). Together, these results suggest that except for the I modification, the evolution of modifications had no impact on the evolution of target tRNA genes. Modification Status Is Associated with tRNA Diversity, GC Content, and Genome Size To identify the cause and impact of evolutionary changes in tRNA modifications, we compared key translation-associated genomic features of sister clades with contrasting modification status. As shown above, we found that in 11 of 14 comparisons, the tRNA diversity of sister clades was significantly different (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test; fig. 3 fig. 1B ). Stacked bar plots show the proportion of species within each sister clade that lack a specific tRNA (blue bars), have a single copy of the gene (light red bars), or have multiple copies (dark red bars). The total number of species analyzed in each clade are given in parentheses above the bar plots. Each panel shows data for a specific sister clade comparison; panels are grouped by modification pathway. Gray shading represents anticodons (i.e., tRNA) for which the proportion of species without the tRNA is significantly different across groups, with respect to modification presence versus absence (P < 0.05; two-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction). CDT, Cyanobacteria-Deinococcus-Thermus; FCB, Fibrobacteres-Chlorobi-Bacteroidetes. Diwan and Agashe . doi:10.1093/molbev/msy110 MBE our prediction that the lack of modifications should be associated with greater tRNA diversity. Next, we tested whether changes in modification status and tRNA genes were also associated with changes in GC content and codon use. In most cases showing altered tRNA diversity (8 out of 11), we found that the change in diversity was also associated with significant shifts in GC content, so that species in clades without the tRNA modification typically had more extreme GC3 values (i.e., GC content in the third base of codons, fig. 3 ; P < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test; we observed similar results with genomic GC content, supplementary fig. S3 , Supplementary Material online). In seven of these eight cases, species without the modification also had significantly more biased codon use (measured as relative synonymous codon use RSCU for all proteins; P < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test; we observed similar results for RSCU of highly expressed ribosomal proteins; supplementary fig. S3 , Supplementary Material online). Finally, in five of the eight cases we observed significant differences in genome size across sister clades ( fig. 3 ). Of these, in the two comparisons that involved Actinobacteria ( fig. 3A and F) we observed that larger genomes were associated with the absence of the modification. As mentioned above, in the other three cases involving Tenericutes and Enterobacterales ( fig. 3G, I, and M) , the lack of modification may reflect overall genome reduction. Note that in every comparison where codon use and genome size were different, GC content was also skewed significantly. Thus, to test the overall effect of genome size and GC content on modification status, we carried out a phylogenetic regression analysis. We found that both GC content and genome size had a significant effect on the presence/absence of the Q FIG. 3. Differences in key genomic features across sister clades with contrasting modification status. Box plots show the range of values of three genomic traits, across all species within a sister clade (red boxes ¼ modification absent; green boxes ¼ modification present). For the Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) panel, asterisks indicate that the difference between the distributions represented by green box plots is significantly different than the difference between the distributions represented by the red box plots (i.e., codon usage is more biased in one case; P < 0.05; Wilcoxon rank sum test with P-values correction for multiple comparisons). For tRNA types, GC3 (GC content of the third codon base) and genome size, asterisks indicate a significant difference in distributions across the sister clades (P < 0.05; Wilcoxon rank sum test with P-values correction for multiple comparisons). The Evolutionary History and Impact of Bacterial tRNA Modifications . doi:10.1093/molbev/msy110 modification alone (supplementary fig. S4 , Supplementary Material online). A previous structural report shows that the Q base binds both C and U with a strength equivalent to GU pairing (Morris et al. 1999 ). This binding is weaker compared with the canonical GC base pair, and thus the Q modification may be lost in genomes with high or low GC content where canonical GC base pairs may be preferred. This hypothesis fits three out of four cases for the loss of the Q modification. Overall, these results suggest that except for the Q modification, modifications were lost in only a few instances of shifts in GC content. Thus, GC content may be the major ultimate driver of changes in tRNA gene content and the subsequent loss of modification may generate selection to fix these changes. Altogether, 3 of the 14 major changes in modification status were not associated with significant shifts in either tRNA or GC content, and remain unexplained. These included one instance of the loss of the (c)mnm 5 (s 2 )U modification ( fig. 3B ) and two losses of the I modification ( fig. 3K-L) . Finally, to quantify the evolutionary impact of tRNA modifications on tRNA gene pools, we simultaneously mapped changes in tRNA genes copies, MEs, and GC content on the bacterial phylogeny. As expected, following major GC shifts, nontarget tRNA showed several gain/loss events whereas target tRNA were more stable (figs. 4-6). As suggested by our sister clade comparison, in some cases modification gain or FIG. 4. Evolutionary dynamics of tRNA genes, MEs, and GC content for the (c)mnm 5 (s 2 )U modification. Branches are colored according to the inferred GC content for each branch, with white indicating low GC% and black indicating high GC%. Nodes that showed the largest GC shifts are indicated with black circles. Colored open and closed circles, respectively, indicate the loss and gain of each ME involved in the modification. Open and closed triangles indicate the loss and gain of tRNA genes relevant to the (c)mnm 5 (s 2 )U modification, with target tRNA indicated on the tree on the left and nontarget tRNA indicated on the mirror tree on the right. Diwan and Agashe . doi:10.1093/molbev/msy110 MBE loss was also preceded by a GC shift (8 out of 14 independent lineages). Moreover, a phylogenetic regression to test the impact of GC and MEs on tRNA genes revealed that GC content had the strongest impact on the dynamics of nontarget tRNA genes ( fig. 7) . However, as observed in the sister clade comparison, the phylogenetic regression and mapping also reveal clear instances of GC independent impacts of modification status on tRNA genes (figs. 4-7). The strongest impact of tRNA modification is observed the case of the Inosine modification, where the target tRNA was present in all species when the modification was present (fig. 6) ; and the nontarget tRNA were absent in most of these species (fig. 2D ). On the other hand, the loss of target tRNAs and presence of nontarget tRNAs is strongly associated with the loss of the Inosine modification (figs. 2D, 6, and 7). Thus, the bacterial tRNA repertoire is strongly affected by evolutionary changes in GC content as well as tRNA MEs.
