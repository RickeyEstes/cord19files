Nationwide surveillance data indicated that after remaining just below 0·2 cases per 100 000 people from 1989 to 1993, the total incidence of syphilis increased from 0·17 cases per 100 000 in 1993 to 6·5 cases per 100 000 in 1999, with incidence of primary and secondary syphilis accounting for 5·85 cases per 100 000 (fi gure 3). After decreasing slightly between 2000 and 2003 (perhaps more a result of administrative changes during that time than a real decline), the incidence of primary and secondary syphilis has increased in the past 2 years to 5·67 cases per 100 000 people. The average incidence of primary and secondary syphilis for the years 2000 to 2005 was 5·13 cases per 100 000 people per year. Incidence of congenital syphilis had grown at a very rapid rate with an average yearly increase of 71·9%, from 0·01 cases per 100 000 livebirths in 1991 to 19·68 cases per 100 000 livebirths in 2005 (fi gure 3). The actual numbers of cases of syphilis classifi ed by the stage of disease are shown in table 1. More than 70% of reported cases of syphilis in the past 10 years were in people aged 20-49 years. The mean ages were slightly higher in northern and central China than in other regions of the country (table 2). The ratio of male to female individuals with syphilis decreased from 2·0 to 1·0 between 1988 and 2000, and has held steady for the past 5 years. All China's 2882 counties reported cases of syphilis during the past 5 years. In 2005, the highest rates of total syphilis cases were reported in Shanghai (55·3 cases per 100 000 individuals), Zhejiang (35·9 per 100 000), and Fujian (26·8 per 100 000), which together with Jiangsu (13·0 per 100 000) form China's prosperous southeastern seaboard. Beijing municipality had the next highest rate (24·9 per 100 000), followed by the southern Zhujiang River Delta (Guangxi, Guangdong, and Hainan provinces), which reported rates of about 14-21 cases per 1 9 8 9 1 9 9 0 1 9 9 1 1 9 9 2 1 9 9 3 1 9 9 4 1 9 9 5 1 9 9 6 1 9 9 7 1 9 9 8 1 9 9 9 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 3 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 Reported incidence of primary and secondary syphilis cases Reported incidence of congenital syphilis cases Year Incidence (per 100 000) Figure 3 : Reported incidence of congenital syphilis and cumulative primary and secondary syphilis in China from 1988 to 2005, nationwide STD surveillance system *Aside from congenital syphilis, classifi cation into diff erent stages of syphilis was introduced in 1996. Thus, before 1996, data points for primary and secondary syphilis show incidence for total syphilis. However, an ad hoc survey of syphilis reports in 38 cities from 1990 to 1994 suggested that reported cases of primary, secondary, early latent, tertiary, and congenital syphilis accounted for 20·2%, 46·5%, 28·1%, 2·1%, and 0·7% of total cases, respectively.
