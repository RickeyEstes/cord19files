Coproscopically, a moderate amount of Cystoisospora suis oocysts and Balantidium coli cysts were detected in the faeces from the 17-18 week-old fattening pigs with diarrhoea. Blood analysis from the euthanized fattening pig showed neutrophilic leucocytosis with left shift and lymphopenia, increased serum levels of urea (14.8 mmol/l; normal: 1.9-6.5 mmol/l) creatinine (258 mmol/l; normal: 99-164 mmol/l), ASAT (GOT) (94 U/l; normal: 23-50 U/l) and GLDH (2.7 U/l; normal 0.3-2.1 U/l) and hypoalbuminemia (16.2 g/l; normal: 23-42 g/l; albumin/globulin 0.51; normal: 0.68-1.4). At necropsy, pale mucous membranes and subcutaneous tissues and a moderate body condition were noticed. Histologically, a severe acute fibrinopurulent jejunoileitis with extensive loss of intestinal villi, loss of goblet cells and crypt abscesses were observed and in some zones, fusion of intestinal villi was present (Fig. 1A) . Abundant C. suis stages (mainly typical merozoite pairs within enterocytes) were associated with these severe lesions ( Fig. 1B-C) . In the liver, intranuclear inclusion bodies typical for a herpesvirus infection, moderate leukocyte stasis and a mixed-cell infiltration were detected (Fig. 1D) . Additionally, a peracute neutrophilic interstitial pneumonia and leukocyte stasis were observed in lung sections. The lesions in lung and liver suggested the beginning of a septic process. The remaining examined organs did not show any histopathological alterations. Performed analyses for PCV-2, Rotavirus A, TGEV, PED and L. intracellularis detection yielded negative results. Bacteriological studies revealed growth of E. coli (non-haemolytic F4 and F5 negative), which was considered irrelevant. FFPE liver sections were tested for herpesvirus by nested-PCR and subsequent sequencing, which revealed 100% identity with PCMV GenBank sequences.
