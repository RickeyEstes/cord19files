Over a time period of 18 months, 42 thrombocytopenic cats were included in the study. PBA testing was established for these 42 patients (platelet counts 6e179 Â 10 9 /l, mean 74 AE 55 Â 10 9 /l, median 56 Â 10 9 /l) and for 47 healthy control cats (platelet counts 182e564 Â 10 9 /l, mean 310 AE 127 Â 10 9 /l, median 256 Â 10 9 /l). The PBA test applied here was negative in all healthy and 23 thrombocytopenic cats (platelet values 15e179 Â 10 9 /l, mean 89 AE 59 Â 10 9 /l, median 82 Â 10 9 /l). These 23 cats with negative test results suffered from viral or bacterial infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases, neoplasias, immunological disorders, and various other diseases (Table 1) . Spontaneous haemorrhage was found only in two of these 23 cats. One cat diagnosed with FIV had bled into the abdomen (platelet count 22 Â 10 9 /l). The other cat, which was diagnosed with erythrocytic-megakaryocytic bone marrow aplasia, had bleeding of the gums and petechiae and ecchymoses on the abdomen, ear, retina, and sclera (platelet count 34 Â 10 9 /l). Nineteen thrombocytopenic cats (platelet values 6e179 Â 10 9 /l, mean 60 AE 47 Â 10 9 /l, median 42 Â 10 9 /l) tested positive for PBA, suggesting ITP. Seventeen of these 19 cats were diagnosed with the following underlying diseases: viral or bacterial infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases, neoplasias, and various other disorders (Table 1 ). In two of the cats, an underlying disease could not be found: cat 1, a 9-year-old female-spayed British shorthair, with anaemia and thrombocytopenia had IgG antibodies bound to erythrocytes and platelets suggesting an Evans' syndrome (ITP and immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia) and cat 2, a 9-year-old malecastrated domestic shorthair, was thought to have a primary ITP (Table 1) . Cat 1 (possible Evans' syndrome) suffered from anaemia, which was non-regenerative initially (haematocrit 0.22 l/l, absolute numbers of aggregated reticulocytes 8380/ml); the leukocyte count was 4.8 Â 10 9 /l. The direct differentiated Coombs' test was positive (class IgG anti-erythrocytic antibodies) and anti-nuclear antibody-titre was negative. Apart from splenomegaly, radiography and ultrasonography were unremarkable. The first two cytometric tests (initially and after 6 months) were positive for PBA (platelet values 6 and 38 Â 10 9 /l). Follow-up after 11 months yielded a negative test result (platelet count 101 Â 10 9 /l). A regenerative anaemia was present in cat 2 (haematocrit 0.16 l/l, absolute aggregated reticulocyte count 208,560/ml); the white blood cell count was 6.3 Â 10 9 /l. The PBA test was positive initially and after 14 days (platelet counts 41 and 100 Â 10 9 /l). It was negative after 3 months (platelet count 172 Â 10 9 /l). The direct Coombs' test was negative. The differential cell count, parameters of clinical chemistry and the coagulation panel (prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time) were within the reference range in both cats. Both cats were started on an immunosuppressive dosage of prednisolone (2 mg/kg twice daily); cats 1 and 2 received whole blood transfusions at day 5 and at days 1 and 4, respectively. Both patients received follow-ups and checks of their blood parameters during a time period of 19 and 3 months, respectively. In cat 1, platelet counts reached levels over 100 Â 10 9 /l only twice (out of 22 checks) in 19 months; platelet values ranged from 6 to 106 Â 10 9 /l. After 10 days of therapy, cat 2 showed a constant increase in thrombocytes to levels >100 Â 10 9 /l. These two cats had clinical signs that indicated spontaneous bleeding and included epistaxis and petechiae in the soft palate and ear (cat 1, platelet value 10 Â 10 9 /l) or gum bleeding (cat 2, platelet count 46 Â 10 9 /l). Three other PBA test positive cats also displayed spontaneous bleeding. These three cats had underlying diseases, two were FIV positive cats and one had leukaemia. One of the FIV positive cats (platelet value 57 Â 10 9 /l) had haematomas in the cheek, petechiae in the ears, soft palate, and around the anus; the second cat suffering from FIV (platelet count 16 Â 10 9 /l) had gum bleeding. The cat with leukaemia bled from the gums, had a haematoma above the eye, and petechiae in the oral mucosa, the abdomen and the ear at platelet counts of 42 Â 10 9 /l. In this study, only seven of the 42 thrombocytopenic cats displayed spontaneous bleeding. Platelet counts ranged from 10 to 57 Â 10 9 /l (mean 24.3 AE 17.1 Â 10 9 /l, median 34 Â 10 9 /l). In those cats showing thrombocytopenia but not bleeding, numbers of thrombocytes ranged from 15 to 179 Â 10 9 /l (mean 82.2 AE 55.8 Â 10 9 /l, median 74 Â 10 9 /l) (Fig 1) . Three out of seven bleeding cats had platelet values <30 Â 10 9 /l. However, another 10 of the 42 thrombocytopenic cats also displayed platelet counts <30 Â 10 9 /l without spontaneous bleeding. Of the seven cats with a positive PBA test and platelet values <30 Â 10 9 /l, two cats displayed bleeding. Of the six cats with negative PBA test results and thrombocyte counts <30 Â 10 9 /l, bleeding occurred in one cat.
