Treatment with DMXAA generates significant therapeutic effects against TC-1 tumors but does not enhance the antigen-specific immune responses in tumor bearing mice To determine the antitumor effects of treatment with DMXAA, we first challenged groups of C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) with TC-1 tumor cells and treated them with a single dose of DMXAA which was administered on day 13 after tumor challenge via i.p. injection and monitored the tumor size over time. As shown in Figure 1A , tumor bearing mice treated with DMXAA showed significantly lower tumor volumes over time compared to tumor bearing mice without DMXAA treatment (* p < 0.05). We also characterized the E7-specific CD8 + T cell immune responses in these mice. One week after DMXAA treatment, splenocytes from tumor-bearing mice were harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8 + T cells using intracellular IFN-g staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. However, as shown in Figure 1B , we found that mice treated with DMXAA were not capable of significantly enhancing the E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses compared to mice without DMXAA treatment. Taken together, our data indicate that treatment with DMXAA generates significant therapeutic effects against TC-1 tumors but does not enhance the antigen-specific immune responses in tumor bearing mice. Combination of DMXAA treatment with E7 DNA vaccination generates potent antitumor effects and E7specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in the splenocytes of tumor-bearing mice In order to determine the therapeutic antitumor effects and E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune response in TC-1 tumor-bearing mice treated with DMXAA combined with CRT/E7 DNA vaccination, we first challenged groups of C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) with TC-1 tumor cells and then treated them with CRT/E7 DNA vaccine with or without DMXAA as illustrated in Figure 2A . Seven days after the last vaccination, we harvested splenocytes from vaccinated mice and characterized them for the presence of E7-specific CD8 + T cells using intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-γ followed by flow Figure 1 Characterization of antitumor effects and E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in TC-1 tumor-bearing mice treated with DMXAA. 5-8 weeks old C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were challenged with 1 × 10 5 TC-1 cells subcutaneously. Mice were treated with a single dose of DMXAA given at day 13 after tumor challenge via i.p. injection. Tumor volume was monitored with calipers twice a week. One week after DMXAA treatment, splenocytes from tumor-bearing mice were harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8 + T cells using intracellular IFN-g staining followed by flow cytometry analysis.

As shown in Figure 2B , tumor-bearing mice that were treated with CRT/E7 DNA vaccine in combination with DMXAA generated the best therapeutic antitumor effects compared to mice treated with any other regimens (* p < 0.05). Furthermore, mice treated with DNA vaccine in combination with DMXAA also generated the highest number of E7-specific CD8 + T cells compared to mice treated with any of the other regimens. Thus, our results suggest that treatment of tumorbearing mice with DMXAA enhances the systemic E7specific CD8+ T cell immune responses and antitumor effects generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccination. The DMXAA-mediated enhancement of E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccination is dependent on the time of administration of DMXAA In order to determine the optimal regimen for enhancing the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccine using DMXAA, C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were vaccinated with CRT/ E7 DNA vaccine three times at 3 day intervals via gene gun delivery and treated with DMXAA at 3 days before the first vaccination (-3), simultaneously (0) or 3 days after the first vaccination (+3) as indicated in Figure 3A . Vaccinated mice without DMXAA treatment were used as controls. Seven days after the last vaccination, splenocytes were harvested from vaccinated mice and characterized for the presence of E7-specific CD8 + T cells using intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-γ followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 3B , vaccinated mice treated with DMXAA 3 days after vaccination generated the best E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses compared to any of the other regimens. Furthermore, we observed that vaccinated mice treated with DMXAA at the time of vaccination or 3 days before the first vaccination generated suppressed E7specific CD8+ T cell immune responses compared to vaccinated mice without DMXAA treatment. Thus, our data indicate that administration of DMXAA 3 days Tumor volume was monitored with calipers twice a week. One week after last vaccination, splenocytes from tumor-bearing mice were harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8 + T cells using intracellular IFN-g staining followed by flow cytometry analysis.

In order to determine if the observed phenomenon is also applicable to tumor-bearing mice, C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were challenged with TC-1 tumor cells subcutaneously, vaccinated with pcDNA3-CRT/E7 DNA vaccine via gene gun delivery, and treated with DMXAA either before the first vaccination (d-3) or after the first vaccination (d+3) as indicated in Figure 4A . One week after last vaccination, splenocytes from tumor-bearing mice were harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8 + T cells using intracellular IFN-g staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 4B , tumor-bearing mice treated with DMXAA 3 days after the first vaccination (d +3) generated significantly higher E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses compared to tumor-bearing mice treated with DMXAA before vaccination (d-3) (p < 0.05). We also observed that vaccinated tumor-bearing mice treated with DMXAA at the time of vaccination or 3 days before vaccination generated suppressed E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses compared to vaccinated mice without DMXAA treatment. Furthermore, tumor-bearing mice treated with DMXAA 3 days after the first vaccination (d+3) generated a significantly increased number of activated dendritic cells compared to the control. In addition, treatment with DMXAA also led to increased expression of co-stimulatory markers for DC activation compared to the control (see Additional File 1; Figure S1 ). The increased number and function of DCs contribute to the enhanced processing and presentation of E7 antigen to the generation of E7-specific CD8+ T cells in treated mice. Taken together, our data indicate that the timing of administration of DMXAA significantly influences the E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in treated mice. The DMXAA-mediated enhancement of antigen-specific T cell-mediated immune responses generated by vaccination is also applicable to other antigen-specific vaccines In order to determine if the observed enhancement of HPV DNA vaccine-induced antigen-specific immune responses by DMXAA is also applicable to other antigen- Figure 3A .

One week after last vaccination, splenocytes from mice were harvested and characterized for antigenspecific T cell immune responses using intracellular IFN-g staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 5 , mice vaccinated with the 3 different vaccines (CRT/E6 DNA or Sig/E7/L1 vaccinia virus or PADRE DNA) and treated with DMXAA 3 days after the first vaccination all generated the best antigen-specific T cell immune responses ((A) HPV-16 E6-specific CD8 + T cell responses, (B) HPV-16 E7-specific CD8 + T cell responses, and (C) PADRE-specific CD4 + T cell immune responses) compared to any of the other regimens. Thus, our data indicate that administration of DMXAA three days after the first vaccination is capable of enhancing antigen-specific immune responses in different vaccination systems. In order to determine if additional doses of DMXAA following the first vaccination would further enhance the immune responses generated in vaccinated mice, C57BL/ 6 mice (5 per group) were vaccinated with pcDNA3-CRT/E7 DNA vaccine via gene gun delivery and treated with either one dose or two doses of DMXAA as indicated in Additional File 2; Figure S2A . One week after last vaccination, splenocytes from mice were harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8 + T cells using intracellular IFN-g staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Additional File 2; Figure S2B and C, vaccinated mice treated with two doses of DMXAA after vaccination generated significantly better E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses compared to vaccinated mice treated with one dose of DMXAA. Thus, our data indicate that administration of two doses of DMXAA after the first CRT/E7 DNA vaccination generates significantly better E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in vaccinated mice compared to administration of one dose of DMXAA.
