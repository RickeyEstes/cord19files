Seventy three people (61 women and 12 men) took part in 14 focus group discussions (see table 1 ). Participants were aged between 16 years of age and 60. Twenty five were parents, of whom more than half had children under the age of five. Seven participants considered that they had had swine flu and thirty six believed that they would accept swine flu vaccination either for themselves or their children if offered. Our purposive sampling strategy meant the sample had nineteen people who deemed themselves at greater risk because of underlying health problems, including asthma (n = 7) and a chronic kidney problem (n = 1), or because they were pregnant (n = 11).
