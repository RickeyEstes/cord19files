The synthesized hTnV-nP Fa9 Peptide exhibited high Binding affinity to the hla-a*0201 Molecule Our previous findings showed that the HTNV-NP FA9 peptide restricted by HLA-A*02 induced an effective CD8 + T-cell response in HFRS patients (21) . To further investigate the binding affinity of peptide FA9 to an HLA-A*02 molecule, a T2 cell-peptidebinding assay was conducted. The synthesized peptide FA9 increased the surface expression of HLA-A*0201 molecules, corresponding to a FI value of 2.77, indicating that peptide FA9 had a high affinity for binding with HLA-A*0201 molecules, whereas the HLA-B*35-restricted peptide aa131-aa139 (VPILLKALY, VY9) on HTNV-NP used as a negative control showed an FI of 0.14, indicating no binding with HLA-A*0201 ( Figure 1A) . Moreover, the HLA-A*0201 complex refolding assay showed that the predicted molecular weight of the protein coming out with ~15.9 ml eluting buffer would be 45 kDa, coincident with the molecular mass of the pHLA complex ( Figure 1B and Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). Therefore, the results suggest that To further confirm that the HTNV-NP FA9 peptide is a typical HLA-A*02-restricted epitope, the crystal structure of peptide FA9 bound to HLA-A*0201 was further analyzed. Crystal trials were carried out with the purified heterodimer of the heavy chain and β2-microglobulin (β2m) expressed in E. coli, and the synthesized cognate peptide was refolded. The diffracting crystals of pHLA were then obtained ( Figure S2 in Supplementary Material). As expected, the overall three-dimensional structure and domain arrangements of the FA9/HLA-A*0201 complex showed a typical MHC class I fold, which was exactly similar to those of the formerly determined peptide/HLA-A*0201 molecules (Figure 2A) . Specifically, the antiparallel α1 and α2 helices in the extracellular region of the HLA-A*0201 heavy chain formed the antigenic peptide-binding groove, which was supported by an eightstranded β-sheet bedplate. The α3 domain and β2m occupied the standard positions below the bedplate (Figure 2A) . Compared with the previously determined HLA-A*0201 complexed with peptide GV9 (GLMWLSYFV, PDB code: 3I6G), the structural superposition of FA9/HLA-A*0201 was similar to that of GV9/ HLA-A*0201 with a low root mean square difference (RMSD) of 0.415 Å. The amino acid sequence alignments revealed that the main chain conformation of FA9 is quite similar to GV9 (Figures 2B,C) . Specifically, the residues Val2 and Ala9 act as primary anchor residues of peptide FA9, which perform the same conformation as Leu2 and Val9 of peptide GV9. The residue Val at position 2 from the N-terminus and the residue Ala9 at the C-terminal of peptide FA9 were deeply buried in the pocket, indicating typical anchor residues ( Figure 2C) . Of particular interest were the residues Val3 and Leu7, which point their side chains into the pocket and might act as secondary anchor residues for peptide FA9 to bind with HLA-A*0201. However, Met3 and Ser6 might be the secondary anchors for the peptide GV9 ( Figure 2C) . Although there were differences in residues observed between the FA9 and GV9 peptides, the crystal structures revealed that the two peptides adopted similar conformations in their binding with an HLA-A*0201 molecule. All of these anchor residues help the peptide tightly bind with the HLA-A*0201 heavy chain and enhance the stability of the entire complex. It is also important to note that the centrally located residues on the main chain of peptide FA9 tended to protrude out of the antigen-binding groove. The side chains of Phe1, Pro4, Ile5, Leu6, and Lys8 are the most exposed residues pointing upwards from the HLA-A*0201 surface, indicating that these amino acids are the most probable recognition sites for TCRs and might be involved in TCR docking ( Figure 2C) . The mutants in these positions may influence the antigenicity of the peptide and even lead to the immune escape of the virus. The further unambiguous electron density of the complex was observed for the bound peptide FA9, which was well defined inside the peptide-binding groove of HLA-A*0201 ( Figure 2D) . The structural properties of the FA9/HLA-A*0201 complex may be related to the immunogenicity of the epitope that allow it to induce specific immune response to against HTNV infection. In vivo induction of Peptide-specific cD8 + T cells in hla-a2.1/K b Tg Mice immunized with the hTnV-nP Fa9 Peptide Having defined the structure of the complex HTNV-NP FA9 peptide/HLA-A*0201 molecule, we next sought to determine the in vivo immunogenic potential of peptide FA9, which was validated for its ability to elicit specific CD8 + T-cell responses in vitro in our previous study. Groups of HLA-A2.1/K b Tg mice were immunized or injected with peptide HTNV-NP FA9, peptide HTNV-NP VY9, the HTNV inactivated vaccine, or PBS, as described in Section "Materials and Methods. " After three rounds of in vivo stimulation, splenocytes from primed mice were first tested for IFN-γ production via an ELISPOT assay with peptide FA9 as the stimulator. The results showed that a large number of CD8 + T cells from Tg mice inoculated with peptide FA9 demonstrated strong IFN-γ production with a median magnitude of 151 (range, 104-255) SFC/10 6 splenocytes, which is even higher than the IFN-γ secretion level detected in the positive control group injected with the HTNV inactivated vaccine (median: 123, range: 89-152 SFC/10 6 splenocytes), although the difference was not statistically significant. By contrast, no specific CD8 + T-cell reactivity was detected in the splenocytes generated from Tg mice injected with PBS (median: 18, range: 14-26 SFC/10 6 splenocytes) (Figure 3 ). More importantly, although immunization with the FA9 peptide in Tg mice efficiently elicited FA9-specific CD8 + T-cell responses, the HLA-B*35-restricted HTNV-NP VY9 peptide used as an uncorrelated peptide control was unable to prime or very inefficiently primed obvious CD8 + T-cell responses in the Tg mice, with a median value of 28 (range, 15-55) SFC/10 6 splenocytes for IFN-γ production (Figure 3) . Notably, compared to Tg mice injected with PBS, the SFC count, as an index of the CD8 + T-cell reactivity, increased by approximately eightfold in the FA9 peptide-immunized mice (p = 0.021) (Figure 3) . Moreover, a comparison of IFN-γ secretion between the FA9 peptide group and the uncorrelated VY9 peptide control group revealed a significant quantitative difference in the magnitude of peptide FA9-specific CD8 + T-cell responses. Immunization with the FA9 peptide elicited significantly stronger IFN-γ producing CD8 + T-cell responses than that observed in Tg mice inoculation with the VY9 peptide (p = 0.029) (Figure 3) . These results indicate that HTNV-NP FA9 peptide can be naturally processed in vivo in an HLA-A*02-restricted manner and induce a robust FA9-specific CD8 + T-cell response in HLA-A2.1/K b Tg mice. hTnV-nP Fa9 Peptide elicited high levels of cytokine and cytotoxic Mediator Production in hla-a2. 1
