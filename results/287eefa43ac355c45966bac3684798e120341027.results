Eight cascs of NEC and three of HGE occurrcd among 40 nconates in two University of Colorado Health Sciences Center nurseries during the study period, for an attack rate of 27.5%. There is frequent movement of babies between the level II nursery and the NICU as care requires. The distribution of the affected babies and the pattern of their internursery transfers are shown in the Figure. The outbreak may have arisen in the level lI unit with patient 1, who was subsequcntly transferred to the NICU. Wc presume that he introduced the disease to the NICU, where patient 2 became symptomatic eight days after the death of patient 1. Patients 3 and 4 became ill in the level II nursery. Patients 5 and 6 developed disease in the NICU five and eight days, respectively, after the onset of disease in patient 2 in the same unit. The remainder of the cases arose in the level II unit. The precise pathway of transmission has not been elucidated, but may well have included symptomatic staff members. Two physicians and four nurses from the level II nursery and six nurscs from the NICU reported gastrointestinal tract illness in the two weeks before the outbreak, during the outbreak, or in the two weeks following. The clinical characteristics, signs of disease, and hospital course of the patients are summarized in Table I . Six patients had bacterial sepsis, four had perforations requiring surgery, and two patients died of septic shock. No significant risk factors distinguished patients from controls, although all patients had some risk factor(s). The groups were nearly identical in birth weight distribution. Patients were neither more asphyxiated at birth nor more The Journal of Pediatrics September 1983 stressed in the postnatal period by other factors previously associated with the development of NEC. Included among the risk factors analyzed were umbilical catheters, congenital heart disease, patent ductus arteriosus, hypotension, respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, ventilator use, apnea and bradycardia, anemia, polycythemia, jaundice, exchange transfusions, intraventricular hemorrhage, previous surgery, cardiac catheterization, and chromosomal or other anomalies. Previous antibiotic exposure was nearly identical in the two groups. Although none of the patients had been fed human milk exclusively (compared with six controls), more asymptomatic infants had been exclusively fed formula. None of the feeding patterns were associated with disease. All infants with NEC and HGE had been fed prior to onset of symptoms. No Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, or Yersinia species were detected in culture. Only two patients had Escherichia coli strains in their stool, and none had Staphylococcus aureus. Klebsiella pneumoniae was present in 70% (seven of 10) of stool specimens from patients and in 65% (11 of 17) from controls. Klebsiella was also detected in peritoneal cultures in patients 4 and 10. There was no Clostridium difficile toxin in any of the patients. Virus was not cultured from stool filtrate, nasopharyngeal washings, or urine, nor were viral particles seen on electron microscopy of stool. ELISA for coronavirus, adenovirus and coxsackie virus yielded negative results. Rotavirus antigen, however, was detected in the stools of seven of 10 symptomatic infants by ELISA (Table II) . Specificity was confirmed by lack of reaction with preimmune antiserum. ~5 In none of the asymptomatic controls were stool ELISA HRV positive (P = 0.0001). In 40 nursery personnel tested, 11 (two physicians, nine nurses) had elevated IgM titers to HRV, indicating recent infection (Table II1 ). The attack rate for infection among staff members was 27.5%, identical to the attack rate in the neonates. Ten of these 11 personnel worked in the level II unit, and only ~our of them had gastrointestinal tract symptoms, Thus,~of the 12 staff members who responded affirmatively to the survey for gastrointestinal tract symptoms, serologic studies for HRV were positive in four. Seven asymptomatic personnel also had IgM antibody to HRV. Three babies with NEC had elevated !gM to HRV, and one of the infants with HGE had a serologic rise. One of these serologically positiVe infants did not have detectable HRV antigen in the stool, but should be counted as an eighth baby among the 10 symptomatic patients tested who had evidence of HRV infection. None of the asymptomatic infants had IgM antibody to HRV. All infected infants as well as all infants present in the nursery with them ("exposed") were strictly isolated. One of the exposed babies (patient i 1) subsequently developed disease; this was the final case of the cluster. It was necessary to close one of the nurseries to new admissions for seven days to fulfill the criteria of our isolation protocol, and absolute separation of nursing staff into the "exposed" or "clean" areas was maintained. Gowning and gloving were strictly enforced when entering the cohort area, and a change of gown and gloves was required when moving from baby to baby within the group. Three weeks after the final case. of the cluster, another baby in the level II nursery developed NEC. By this time, isolation procedures had been relaxed because none of the original infants remained in the nursery. Strict bedside enteric precautions were imposed, and no additional cases arose. Stool ELISA for HRV yielded negative findings in that infant, but he did have a positive serologic response to HRV, indicating recent infection.
