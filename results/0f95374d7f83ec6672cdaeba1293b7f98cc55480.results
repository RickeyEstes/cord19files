A total of 239 healthcare workers participated in the study: 113 (47.3%) worked in the emergency department, 49 (20.5%) in the medical area, 46 (19.2%) in the surgical area and 31 (13%) in the emergency department of the peripheral centre associated with the hospital. The principal characteristics of the participants are summarised in Table 1 , including the symptoms reported at the moment the blood sample was taken. None of the participants reported suffering dyspnea. None of the workers were diagnosed with influenza A, nor had any been vaccinated against this virus. However, 11 (4.6%) workers were diagnosed with seasonal influenza and 40 (16.7%) were vaccinated against seasonal influenza. Only one worker was taking medication (oseltamivir) for this. 60 (25.1%) participants presented antibody titres determined by IHA ≥1/40. The geometric mean of these values was 58.56. The proportion of positive results was significantly different among the diverse hospital departments: 36.6% in the emergency department, 12.2% in the medical area, 22.2% in the surgical area and 9.7% in the peripheral centre associated with the hospital (p = 0.001). We also observed differences by professional category, with positive results among 30.8% of the doctors, 11.1% of the nurses, 30.2% of the nursing auxiliary staff, 23.1% of the administrative staff and 41.7% of the orderlies (p = 0.01). A positive serology was recorded among 31.4% of the women vs. 14% of the men (49 females vs. 12 males, p = 0.009). There were no differences in average age between seropositive and seronegative subjects. None of the comorbidities were associated with a greater prevalence of positive serologies. With respect to symptoms, only the presence of rhinorrhoea on the day the serology was determined and was significantly associated with a greater proportion of seropositive subjects (57.1% vs. 23.3%, p = 0.009). There were no differences with respect to influenza diagnosed among other family members or whether or not vaccination against seasonal influenza had been received. Of the 11 workers who had been diagnosed with seasonal influenza, 6 (54.5%) presented a positive serology, vs. 23.9% of the other subjects (p = 0.03). The geometric mean of the antibody levels in these 6 patients was higher than that of those who had not been diagnosed with seasonal influenza, although without reaching statistical significance (80 vs. 56.56, p = 0.32). An initial logistic regression analysis was performed, in which the outcome variable was the presentation of positive serology (IHA ≥ 1/40), and in which the independent variables were gender, age, the hospital area in which the worker was active, professional category, the presence of rhinorrhoea, and the prior diagnosis of seasonal influenza. The factors subsequently maintained in the model were female gender (OR 2.28, 95%CI: 1.05-4.95), rhinorrhoea (OR 3.71, 95%CI: 1.09-12.63) and prior diagnosis of influenza (OR 5.24, 95%CI: 1.32-20.82), as well as the professional categories of orderly, administrative staff and doctor. Table 2 summarises the results of the logistic regression analysis. A second model was constructed, excluding the workers who had previously been diagnosed with seasonal influenza. The results of this are shown in Table 3 . In this model, the factors subsequently maintained were rhinorrhoea (OR of 3.65; 95%CI: 1.03-12.92), working in the emergencies area (OR of 3.84, 95%CI: 1.04-14.09) and professional category of doctor, administrative staff or orderly (OR of 8.19, 7.22 and 7.21, respectively) .
