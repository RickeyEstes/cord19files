The rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant enhances humoral and cellular responses after immunization with rRBD of SARS-CoV in mice To evaluate the adjuvant activity of rOv-ASP-1, mice were immunized with SARS-CoV rRBD in the presence or absence of rOv-ASP-1 or with Alum or CpG for comparison. We previously reported that rOv-ASP-1 could effectively induce a mixed, but Th1-skewed immune response against rS and rRBD in immunized mice [27] . As shown in Figure 1 , the titers of RBD-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b antibodies increase after the first or second boost immunization in the sera of mice immunized with rRBD plus rOv-ASP-1, which were all significantly higher than in mice immunized with rRBD alone. The IgG and IgG2a responses in mice vaccinated with rRBD in the presence of Alum were significantly higher only after the second boost; only the IgG1 response was significantly higher after the first boost. The anti-rRBD IgG response was significantly higher in the presence of CpG only after the second boost when compared to mice vaccinated only with rRBD (1:102,400 vs. 1:11,314) . Notably, the rOv-ASP-1 augmented IgG antibody response to rRBD was almost 4 times higher than the Alum vaccination group (64,000 vs. 16,000) and 5.7 times higher than the CpG vaccination group (64,000 vs. 11,200) already after the first boost. Further comparison of the rOv-ASP-1 and the Alum induced rRBD antibody responses after the second boost revealed similar levels of IgG1 (1,884,544 vs. 1,722,156); two-fold higher level of IgG2a (935,763 vs. 512,000) as well as ten times higher level of IgG2b (430,538 vs. 45,255) endpoint titers in the rOv-ASP-1 vaccine group. Comparison of the rOv-ASP-1 and the CpG induced rRBD antibody responses after the second boost revealed a 27 fold increase in IgG1 (1,884,544 vs. 68,000), 14.6 fold increase in IgG2a (935,763 vs. 64,000), and 215 fold increase in IgG2b (430,538 vs. 2,000) endpoint titers. Each adjuvant/rRBD model performed differently depending on the adjuvant, e.g., a skewed Th2 response with Alum (IgG1/IgG2a = 3.3), but a mixed Th1/ Th2 response with CpG (IgG2a/IgG1 = 0.94) and rOv-ASP-1(IgG2a/IgG1 = 2), with a predominance of Th1-associated antibodies (when both IgG2a and IgG2b are taken into account) with rOv-ASP-1. These results further supported our previous studies showing that rOv-ASP-1 can induce a more balanced antibody response with some bias towards a skewed Th1associated antibody response than other adjuvants used with the same bystander antigen such as Alum or CpG (this study) or the MLP plus TDM adjuvant [14, 27, 29] . To further evaluate whether the induced IgG antibodies could neutralize infection of SARS-CoV in vitro (Fig. 2) , we tested the antisera from the 10-day post-second boost immunization and found that mice immunized with rRBD in the presence of rOv-ASP-1 contained a very high titer of neutralizing antibodies against infection by SARS-CoV pseudovirus (NT 50 = 1:76,592), which was not significantly different than in neutralizing antibodies found in sera from mice immunized with rRBD plus the Alum adjuvant (NT 50 = 1:64,666). The subclass of immunoglobulin induced after immunization is an indirect measure of the relative contribution of Th1-type cytokines vs.Th2-type cytokines. In this study, the data from the CBA analyses showed that the levels of Th1-and Th2-type cytokine secretion were significantly higher in mice immunized with rRBD+rOv-ASP-1 or Alum than in those who were immunized with rRBD alone ( Table 1 ). The rOv-ASP-1 induced the production of Type I proinflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IFN-c, TNF-a, IL-17A and IL-6) to the same extent as Alum, as well as the Th2/regulatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-10. There was no significant recall induction of the Th2 IL-4 or IL-5 cytokines by rRBD (data not shown). Notably, the responses to rRBD when formulated with CpG are in comparison more IFN-c and IL-17A dominant with diminished IL-2, TNF-a, IL-10 and IL-6 responses. We found that the variation between individual mice was very low [31, 32] , and therefore we are confident that the results obtained using the pooled spleens are a good representation of what would have been the outcome if we had used individual mice. Distinct from the previous studies are the responses to two RBD-specific peptides; N50 (CD8 + T cell epitope) and N60 (CD4 + T cell epitope) (Table 1) . Interestingly, the cytokine levels in the culture supernatants of the murine splenocytes when stimulated with either N50 or N60 were similar to those produced by stimulation with the full length rRBD in mice vaccinated with rRBD+rOv-ASP-1, thus further confirming the ability of rOv-ASP-1 to elicit RBD-specific CD8 + and CD4 + cellular responses in the tested vaccine formulation. Naïve BALB/c mice or mice ten weeks after immunization with rRBD in the presence of rOv-ASP-1 were immunized with HAs of influenza viruses in the absence or presence of yeast expressed rOv-ASP-1 (100 mg/mice). The mice that were previously immunized with rRBD in the presence of rOv-ASP-1 had endpoint total anti-rOv-ASP-1 antibody titers of 1:256,000-1:512,000 at the time of the priming with the second vaccine. As shown in Table 2 , similar IgG1 and IgG2a humoral immune responses against the influenza viruses were induced in the mice vaccinated previously with rRBD plus rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant and those administered with PBS only. Moreover, the IgG2b was higher in the group that got the sequential vaccine (162,000 vs. 54,000). The anti-HA IgG1 and IgG2b antibody responses were much higher in mice that were immunized with the HAs vaccine in the presence of rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant than those immunized in the absence of rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant (IgG1: 1,458,000 vs. 607,000 or 729,000; IgG2b: 243,000 vs. 162,000 or 54,000). All levels of IgG isotype responses in mice when the flu vaccine was formulated with rOv-ASP-1 were statistically higher than when mice were immunized with no adjuvant (p.0.05; Fig. 3 ). There was no significant difference in the IgG1 and IgG2a responses if the flu vaccine was given to naïve mice or to mice that were previously immunized with another vaccine; rRBD of SARS-CoV+rOv-ASP-1.
