In total, 7196 samples (4958 patients) were included; 29.2% tested positive, with viral coinfections detected in 1.6% of samples. Overall, two viral groups accounted for 60.2% of all viruses identified: picornaviruses (rhinovirus or enterovirus, 34.3%) and influenza (26.6%). Influenza viruses constituted the group most frequently identified in winter (34.4%), in the upper respiratory tract (32%) and in patients over the age of 70 years (36.4%). Picornavirus was the second most frequently identified viral group in these populations and in all other groups, including lower respiratory tract infections (41.3%)  During the study period, 7196 samples from 4958 patients were included in the analysis. In accordance with our definition and exclusion of repeat samples, no sample obtained, within 30 days, from the same area of the respiratory tract of a given patient as the initial sample was included. The median interval between two included samples from the same respiratory tract area of the same patient was 133 days (interquartile range [ The overall distribution of viruses, from year to year, is depicted in Fig 1 and S1 Fig The variation between years was driven mostly by influenza epidemic variations and by a specific variation in the summer of 2012. The number of tests performed annually increased steadily over the study period, from 634 to 1640 samples (Table 1) .
