The total RNA extracted from individual MECs samples exhibited high purity as determined by mean (±SEM) 260/280 ratio of 2.06 ± 0.014. The bioanalyzer-based RQ value of >8 also indicated sufficiently good quality of each extracted RNA. The qPCR performance for each gene in 2 Pérez et al. [32] , and 3 Hernandez et al. [33] . 4 qPCR efficiencies for each primer pair were calculated from six-point standard curves using fivefold dilution series of pooled cDNA from control and heatstressed samples. terms of coefficient of determination, ( 2 ), and efficiency of amplification ( = 10 −1/slope ) on the basis of slope of six-point standard curve are summarized in Table 2 . The efficiency of PCR reactions ranged from 90.70% for ACTB to 131.37% for B2M. The characteristics of individual 16 genes based on their cycle threshold (Ct) values are shown as box whisker plot (Figure 1 ).
