All MERS-CoV sequence information data publicly available as of 27th January 2014 was analysed for variation within oligonucleotide binding sites which could negatively impact PCR-based viral detection. Fig. 1 shows the alignment for the upE and ORF1A target regions. No variation was found in 31 available sequences within binding regions of primers or probes. The limits of detection for the RealStar ® MERS-CoV RT-PCR upE and ORF1A assay were determined using in vitro transcribed RNA (IVT) quantified by spectrophotometry. The IVT was diluted in half-logarithmic steps (from 100 to 0.03 copies/reaction) in nuclease-free water containing 10 g/mL carrier RNA (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and tested in replicates (n = 13) for positive amplification. Probit regression analysis in SPSS (IBM, Ehningen, Germany) was used to determine the 95% cut-off value (Fig. 2) . The upE-assay has a 95% cut-off value of 5.3 copies/reaction (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.0-9.7 copies/reaction); the ORF1A assay detects 9.3 copies/reaction with 95% probability (95% CI: 7.0-14.1 copies/reaction). To determine the sensitivity in detecting the whole virus genome, RNA was extracted (50 l input, 50 l elution volume) from cell culture supernatant of MERS-CoV strain EMC/2012 grown on VeroB4 cells, serially diluted and tested in triplicates (equivalents of 2.8 × 10 2 to 2.8 × 10 −6 plaque forming units (PFU)/reaction). Both assays showed positive triplicate results down to 2.8 × 10 −3 PFU/reaction. The homogenous assays were as sensitive as the in-house assays. The determine the analytical specificity of the homogenous assays we performed experiments to exclude non-specific signals caused by human nucleic acids or nucleic acids of other respiratory pathogens in patient samples. Clinical specimens positive for 15 other respiratory viruses were tested with the kit assays. The clinical samples contained Enterovirus (n = 3); Rhinovirus (n = 5); human Parainfluenzavirus 1 (n = 2), 2 (n = 3), 3 (n = 2) and 4 (n = 2); Respiratory Syncytial Virus (n = 5); Human Metapneumovirus (n = 2); human CoVs HCoV-NL63 (n = 2), HCoV-OC43 (n = 3), HCoV-229E (n = 2) and HCoV-HKU1 (n = 1), Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (n = 2), Influenza A(H3N2) (n = 2) and Influenza B (n = 2). No false-positive results were obtained with any of the MERS-CoV assays. The internal amplification control was detected in all reactions showing that none of the PCR reactions was inhibited. Nineteen samples from a patient were tested with the in-house upE assay and compared to the RealStar ® MERS-CoV RT-PCR kit 1.0 (Table 1) . Among the samples, eight were tested positive and seven negative with both assays. Four samples showed discrepant results, with 3 samples testing positive only with the kit assay and 1 testing positive only by the in-house assay formulation. All discrepant results were seen with samples with very low virus concentrations indicated by a high Ct-value (>36).
