Prediction of H2-Kd binding epitopes from CEA-SRAS-CoV fusion polypeptides The SYFPEITHI prediction algorithm was used to predict peptide/H2-Kd interaction by affinity calculation. To find a low-immunogenic TAA and prevent the human TAA from activating mouse immunity, a truncated CEA peptide was used as a low-immunogenic tumor antigen in this study, the sequence of which is shown in Figure 1a . The CEA sequence was predicted to be less immunogenic by affinity calculation because its highest epitope score (CEA a.a. No. 5-13 ( Figure 1a ): epitope score 16) was far lower than the scores of well-known epitopes of Listeria monocytogenes (Listeriolysin O) (LLO91-99: epitope score 24; p60217-225: epitope score 27) ( Table 1) . A selected SARS fragment was fused with CEA, and this sequence is shown in Figure  1b . As described previously, the epitope within the CEA-SARS-CoV amino acid sequence was also calculated and compared with known epitopes in Listeria monocytogenes (LLO91-99, p60217-225). As a result, the highest score within the CEA-SARS sequence was 21 in the SARS region (Table 2) , lower than the scores of known epitopes of L. monocytogenes for peptide/H2-Kd interaction. In addition, fusion of the CEA and SARS sequences did not create a new epitope with a higher score (data not shown).
