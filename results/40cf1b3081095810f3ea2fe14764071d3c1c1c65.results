Viral DNA yield is increased in PKR ؊/؊ mouse embryonic fibroblasts. While PKR is an important part of the innate immune response, PKR Ϫ/Ϫ cells in culture are not always more susceptible to viral infection than wild-type (WT) cells (48) (49) (50) . PKR Ϫ/Ϫ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) show increased viral yields compared to wild-type MEFs when infected with vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza A virus (48, 49) , but there is no change in viral yield during vaccinia virus infection compared to the results seen with wild-type cells (50) . However, it was later discovered that the PKR Ϫ/Ϫ MEF lines used were not complete PKR knockouts (51) . There are two categories of PKR Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs derived from knockout mice: N-PKR Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs and C-PKR Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs (51). The PKR Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs derived from mice created in the Weissmann laboratory (52) are designated N-PKR Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs, because the C-terminal fragment of PKR is still expressed and can be detected by immunoblotting when there is IFN induction (51) . The fragment has the kinase catalytic activity of PKR, but it does not bind dsRNA (51) . The PKR Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs derived from mice created in the Bell laboratory (53) are designated C-PKR Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs, because the N-terminal fragment of PKR is still expressed and can be detected by immunoblotting with specific PKR antibodies (51) . The fragment is catalytically inactive, but it can still bind dsRNA (51) . Susceptibility of these PKR Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs to specific viruses may be dependent on the PKR mutation and the mechanism used by each virus to circumvent PKR. To determine whether PKR plays an important role during MAV-1 infection, we tested the susceptibility of both PKR Ϫ/Ϫ MEF lines to MAV-1 infection. We infected wild-type MEFs, N-PKR Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs, and C-PKR Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs with MAV-1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 PFU/cell and collected cell pellets at 48 and 72 hpi. DNA was purified from the cell pellets and analyzed for MAV-1 genome copies by quantitative PCR (qPCR). N-PKR Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs produced a significantly higher viral DNA yield than wild-type MEFs at 48 hpi, and both PKR mutant MEF lines had a significantly higher viral DNA yield than wild-type MEFs at 72 hpi (Fig. 1 ). Although we have not confirmed the production of truncated PKR proteins in the cells in our laboratory, the results shown in Fig. 1
