The distribution of [3H]uridine label in a glycerol tartrate gradient following rate zonal centrifugation is shown in Fig. 1 . Electron microscopic examination of Fig. 2 . Phosphotungstic acid-stained virus from peak A (Fig. 1) showing typical intact coronavirus particles. Fig. 1 ) resulted in a major peak of radioactivity at a density of 1.1 8 g/cm 3 (Fig. 3) . Subsequent examination of this material by electron microscopy showed typical coronavirus particles similar to those shown in Fig. 2 . Simultaneous equilibrium centrifugation of peak (B) resulted in a major peak of radioactivity at a density of 1.27 g/cm 3 (Fig. 3) .
