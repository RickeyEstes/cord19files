Optimization of the LAMP Assay Targeting bla OXA−51−like Five sets of different primers were initially tested for detection of the bla OXA−51−like gene, and the primers for pgaD gene of A. baumannii were added as a control (Wang et al., 2013) . Four of the five primer sets enabled successful amplification (Figure 1) . The OXA-4 primer set amplified the target sequence within the shortest time and was, therefore, chosen as the optimal primer set ( Table 2) . Reaction temperatures ranging from 55 to 69 • C at a 2 • C intervals were compared to determine optimal amplification conditions. The amplification efficiency was highest at 65 • C ( Figure 2) and was, therefore, used in subsequent experiments. FIGURE 1 | Five sets of primers were used to amplify the indicated target genes of Acinetobacter baumannii under the same conditions. Turbidity was monitored using a Loopamp real-time turbidimeter by measuring the absorbance at 650 nm every 6 s. The OXA-4 primer set was chosen as the most appropriate primers for the rapid detection of A. baumannii. Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org
