We report results here for SEIR epidemics run over Bernoulli and power-law networks. A number of smaller trials that we do not report were run: with different values chosen for the network and epidemic parameters; on networks with the same degree distributions as a random intersection graph; and, using an SIR epidemic rather than an SEIR. The results for those smaller trials were qualitatively similar to the results reported here. The distributions of the measured clustering coefficients is shown in Figure 3 and show that the simulated networks with high and low clustering for a given degree distribution are easily distinguished from one another. The Bernoulli networks with low clustering contain no triangles, so the clustering coefficient for each of these networks is zero, while for highly-clustered Bernoulli networks, clustering coefficients are in the range (0.28,0.33). For the power-law networks, the low clustered networks have clustering in the range (0.00,0.09) while the highly clustered networks have clustering in the range (0.24,0.38). Figures 4 and 5 show comparisons of summary statistics for networks with differing levels of clustering and Bernoulli degree distributions. The summaries show some differences between the outbreaks on the differently clustered networks. In particular, the outbreaks in the highly-clustered networks spread more slowly, on average, leading to marginally longer epidemics with fewer individuals infected at the peak of the outbreak, that occurs slightly later, than we see in outbreaks on the networks with low clustering. These mean effects are in line with the predictions of [22] . The variances of the measured statistics, however, are sufficiently large due to stochastic effects in the model that the ranges of the distributions overlap almost completely in most cases. Statistics derived from the transmission tree appear to add little information, with only the number of cherries differing in the mean. Figures 6 and 7 show the corresponding distributions for networks with power-law degree distributions. Again, differences in the means between the two sets of statistics are apparent with the mean length of epidemic, total number infected and number infected at peak all lower in the epidemics on networks with high-clustering. The largest difference is found in the total number infected, where in the low-clustered networks, the range of the statistic is (231, 445) while it is just (211, 361) in the high-clustered networks. The primary cause here is due to the change in size of the largest connected component of the network. If we adjust for this by looking instead at the proportion of the giant component infected, the distributions again overlap almost completely with the range for the proportion infected in the low-clustered networks being (0.39, 0.74) and (0.42, 0.74) for the high-clustered networks.
