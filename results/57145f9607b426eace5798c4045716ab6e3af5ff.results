All 60 cows calved successfully and had colostrum samples collected. There were no differences in Salmonella titers between groups of cows at the end of lactation. Cows in the vaccinated group had a significant increase in antibody titers at the time of calving as compared to unvaccinated cows ( Table 2 ). The colostrum collected from cows that had been vaccinated for Salmonella Newport also had significantly higher antibody titers than did colostrum from unvaccinated cows. Twenty-nine calves born to control cows received colostrum in this study (1 was dead at birth), and 30 calves born to vaccinated cows received colostrum. Two calves were dead at birth, but 2 cows had twins and both calves were fed colostrum from the dam. Stillbirth rates were therefore 2/30 (6.7%) in the vaccinated group and 1/30 (3.3%) in the unvaccinated group. Calves that received colostrum from vaccinated cows had significantly higher Salmonella Newport titers as compared to calves born to unvaccinated cows ( Table 2 ).
