Black tea extract concentrations up to 14 mM have no significant effect on cell morphology A549 and Vero cells were exposed to ten-fold dilutions of BTE, from 14 mM to 0.014 nM. No significant changes in morphology, as determined by phase contrast microscopy, were observed at any tested concentration of BTE in A549 cells (data not shown). However, slight changes in morphology were observed for Vero cells at the highest concentration (data not shown). Vero cells appeared to tolerate 1-hour exposure to BTE up to 1.4 mM (data not shown).
