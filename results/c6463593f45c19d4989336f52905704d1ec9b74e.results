The A/H5N1 survey comprised 1,760 respondents with a response rate of 63% while the A/H1N1 survey comprised 1,016 respondents with a response rate of 68.8%. Demographics including age, gender, education level, marital status and birth place of the two samples were comparable to the general population [51] (effect sizes<0.3) [43] but differed somewhat from each other (Appendix Table 2 ), with the A/H1N1 sample more closely approximating the general population in terms of gender and age, and the A/H5N1 sample closer in terms of educational attainment and marital status. There were some demographic differences in the constructs specified in the model (Appendix Table 3 ). PHPs were generally greater in females across the two surveys but were unassociated with age. Perceived effectiveness of hygiene and disease worry were higher in females in the A/ H5N1 survey only but positively associated with age in both surveys. Perceived susceptibility was negative associated with age in the A/H5N1 data but positively associated with age in the A/H1N1 data. Trust in formal information was higher in females and positively associated with age in the A/H5N1 data only while trust in informal information was positively associated with age but did not differ by gender in either dataset. In the A/H5N1 data, three cases were identified and deleted as outliers based on disproportionate contribution to normalized multivariate kurtosis, leaving 1,757 cases for model testing. Similarly, four cases were identified and deleted as outliers in the A/H1N1 data, leaving 1,012 cases for model testing. Mardia coefficients (63.68 and 41.68 for A/H5N1 and A/H1N1 survey data, respectively) indicated some degree of persisting non-normality for both survey datasets, thus robust maximum likelihood estimation and SB Ï‡ 2 were applied for model testing.
