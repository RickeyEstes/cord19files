Analytical performance. (i) Analytical sensitivity. The limit of detection (LoD) of the SAMBA Flu duplex test was determined by testing dilutions of quantified cultured virus (the genome copy number, by using the in-house qRT-PCR) spiked in pooled negative swab specimens. The LoD was defined as the lowest concentration at which 95% of 20 replicates tested positive. A/Perth/ 16/2009 (H3N2) and B/Brisbane/60/2008 were used as the representative strains for influenza A and B viruses, respectively. First, 1,000, 500, 250, 200, 150, and 75 copies of influenza A/B viruses were tested in quadruplicate. All dilutions except that with 75 copies yielded 100% positivity. Concentrations above 75 copies were subsequently tested in increments of 5 copies in 20 replicates until at least 95% of the replicates tested positive. According to this procedure, the LoD of the SAMBA Flu duplex test was determined to be 95 copies/test and 85 copies/test for influenza A and B viruses, respectively. (ii) Analytical specificity. A panel of common respiratory pathogen culture supernatants ( Table 2 ) was used to validate the analytical specificity. All viruses tested negative by SAMBA. (iii) Analytical reactivity (inclusivity). A panel comprising 18 influenza viruses, including 3 H1N1, 4 H3N2, 1 each of H5N3, H7N1, and H7N2 subtypes, and 8 influenza B viruses were tested to determine the detection spectrum of the SAMBA Flu duplex test. The copy numbers of these cultures were quantified by using the in-house qRT-PCR assay, except for A/Teal/England/2006 (quantified in PFU), owing to its low sample volume. Two hundred copies/test of the panel member and 45 PFU/test of A/Teal/ England/2006 were tested in duplicate, and all tested positive (Table 2). (iv) Dynamic range of the IC. The dynamic range of the IC was analyzed by testing 10-fold serial dilutions of the cultured virus in pooled clinical samples from the highest possible concentration (40.74 and 36.47 million copies/test for influenza A and B viruses, respectively). The IC signal remained visible at 4.074 and 3.647 million copies/test of influenza A and B virus, respectively, and was out-competed at higher levels of influenza virus. In addition, the potential competitive inhibition of the assay was evaluated by using samples that simulated coinfection with various concentrations of both influenza A and B viruses in a single reaction mixture. Five hundred copies of influenza A virus were mixed with 500, 5,000, 50,000, and 500,000, copies of influenza B virus, and vice versa. These simulated coinfection samples were tested in duplicate. Successful detection of both viruses was observed when two viral concentrations were within a 100-fold difference, e.g., 500 and 50,000 copies. At a 1,000-fold difference in concentrations, the virus with the lower level was out-competed. The internal control line was visible at all simulated concentrations. (v) Reproducibility. An in-house quality control (QC) panel consisting of negative, medium-positive (200 copies/test), and low-positive (100 copies/test) samples was used to validate the performance of production lots of reagents throughout this project and to analyze test reproducibility. Each panel was com- ) and was tested by three operators to evaluate interoperator reproducibility. Additionally, the panel testing was performed by one operator on three different days to establish interday reproducibility. All replicates tested by each operator as well as the overall results (100 replicates in total) met the internal QC criteria (0% positivity for negatives, 100% positivity for medium positives, and at least 50% positivity for low positives). Clinical evaluation of the SAMBA Flu duplex test. The clinical evaluation of the SAMBA Flu duplex test was conducted by testing samples from two public health laboratories: HPA Cambridge, United Kingdom, and WIV-ISP Brussels, Belgium. The details of the clinical samples are described in the previous section. In brief, 41 prospective nasal/throat swab samples were collected during the 2011-2012 winter season from HPA Cambridge and were tested fresh (Table 3) . A further 287 archived nasopharyngeal swab specimens were provided by WIV-ISP Brussels ( Table 3) . The routine qRT-PCR assays used by these two collaborating centers were used as the comparator tests. The comparator test results were initially blinded, and the SAMBA results were sent to and compared with the reference tests by the collaborators at the end of the evaluation. In the initial testing, the SAMBA Flu duplex test detected 135 influenza A-positive and 94 influenza B-positive concordant samples. Four samples tested influenza A positive by SAMBA but negative by qRT-PCR, and two samples tested negative by SAMBA but influenza B positive by qRT-PCR (C T values of 37.97 and 37.86). To resolve the discrepancy and to prevent any testing bias, these six discordant samples were blind tested alongside 10% of the concordant ones (randomly selected; 38 in total), using twostep typing/subtyping real-time RT-PCR assays for influenza A(H3), A(H1N1)pdm09, former seasonal H1N1, and influenza B viruses routinely used for influenza surveillance at PHE Colindale. The 32 concordant samples gave the same results as SAMBA (and the comparator qRT-PCR) by the PHE real-time assays. Four influenza A virus SAMBA-positive qRT-PCR-negative samples tested negative, and two influenza B virus SAMBA-negative qRT-PCR-positive samples also tested negative. In summary, through the analysis of 328 clinical specimens, the SAMBA showed a resolved clinical sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 97.9% for its influenza A virus test and a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 100% for its influenza B virus test ( Table 3 ). The performance between the prospective study, although small in sample size, and the retrospective study was similar. Notably, out of these test, only one sample from Belgium initially gave an invalid result. Upon repeat, this sample tested negative (concordant). This gave an invalid rate of 0.3%. The SAMBA Flu duplex test detected almost all the positive cases (97.4% [227/233]) with a clearly visible signal (Ն3), even in samples with low viral load (C T Ն 30). In the six samples (2.6%) showing a low dipstick signal, two had a very low viral load (SAMBA ID 52, with SAMBA signal of 1, C T of 37.05, and SAMBA ID C4, with SAMBA signal of 1 and C T of 34.83), and the other four were later confirmed (resolved by qRT-PCR and also retested by SAMBA) to be false positives, possibly due to degradation of the viral genome in the original samples or contamination during the extraction process. A weak negative correlation was observed between the signal strength of the SAMBA test and the C T values from the qRT-PCR assays (r ϭ Ϫ0.35; P Ͻ 0.0001).
