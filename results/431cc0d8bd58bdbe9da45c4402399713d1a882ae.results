The AKR prototype was successfully demonstrated within the Interoperability Showcase at the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) 2009 conference in Chicago, IL, in April 2009, and again at the seventh annual Public Health Information Network (PHIN) conference in Atlanta, GA, on August 30 through September 3, 2009. These demonstrations were conducted in collaboration with the CDC, GE Healthcare, and the Regenstrief Institute. CDC personnel populated the AKR with several public health alerts, GE Healthcare and Regenstrief Institute accessed the AKR through their EMR systems to demonstrate interoperability, and JHU/APL provided the AKR. As a result of these live demonstrations, a number of previously unidentified requirements were discovered, as well as gaps in existing HITSP standards. For example, the T.81 requests standard returns query results in an unspecified format and it was found that requiring HTML retrieval allowed the query results to be viewable in the GE EMR software. Additional requirements for the full AKR were initiated based on the results obtained from these demonstrations. These include the ability to provide feedback to the health departments based on the number of alert matches.
