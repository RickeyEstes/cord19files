In the Liguria Region, influenza activity was moderate in the 2010-2011 season. The influenza epidemic began in the 50th week of 2010 and lasted until the 10th week of 2011. The epidemic period lasted 13 weeks, during which time it was estimated that about 6.4% of the Region's population suffered from influenza. Infants, children and adolescents were the subjects most affected by influenza. Only 9.4% of cases fell into the over-64 y age-class. The predominant circulating influenza virus was A/ California/07/09 pdm (67%), followed by B virus (B/ Brisbane/60/2008) (23.5%) and A/H3N2 (A/Perth/16/2009) (9.3%). In the 2010-2011 season there was optimal matching between circulating viruses and vaccine strains. No drifted influenza strains were isolated in the Genoa district. The 2010-2011 influenza vaccination coverage was 62.3% in the elderly in Genoa. On the basis of the distribution of the vaccines used, 33,228, 41,504 and 27,320 elderly subjects were vaccinated with Inflexal V ® , Fluad ® and Intanza ® , respectively (Data from Liguria Region-Influenza vaccination: 2010-2011 season). A total of 187 cases (104 males and 83 females) and 187 controls were recruited. Seven cases were excluded because they were not matched with suitable controls. Table 1 shows the personal and clinical characteristics of cases and controls. Smoking and drinking were significantly more common among cases than controls. Furthermore, more cases than controls suffered from heart disease (p = 0.0002), respiratory disease (p < 0.0001) and renal disease (p = 0.0007). By contrast, controls were more often affected by rheumatologic disease (p = 0.0033). The high-risk medical conditions of hypertension, liver disease and cancer were similarly distributed among cases and controls. Pneumococcal vaccination was received by 9.1% risk of serious influenza complications. About 90% of excess mortality due to influenza and about 50% of excess hospitalizations occur among the elderly. 5, 6 Moreover, as underlined by the US. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the complications of influenza more often affect persons over 64 y of age, especially those aged over 75 y, as well as children and people of all ages with recognized risk conditions. 7, 8 It is acknowledged that the only really effective means of combating influenza and its possible complications is vaccination. 7, 8 Many studies support the hypothesis that influenza vaccination significantly reduces the risk of severe complications, e.g., hospitalizations for pneumonia and death among the elderly living in communities. 6, [9] [10] [11] In subjects over 64 y of age, vaccination against influenza seems to reduce hospitalizations by 50-60% and mortality by up to 80%. 7 However, these studies are open to potential bias, since several variables can influence evaluations of efficacy/effectiveness. The need for ever more immunogenic and efficacious influenza vaccines, especially for the elderly, has prompted the development of adjuvanted vaccines. In order to enhance the immune response to influenza vaccines, several adjuvants have been proposed (e.g., MF-59 ® and virosomes). 12, 13 Adjuvants are agents which, when influenza or pneumonia were assessed only in subjects who had received adjuvanted influenza vaccines. Those who had received the Intanza ® 15 mcg vaccine were excluded from the following statistical tests (29 case-controls pairs). Then, we analyzed 158 case-control pairs. If we consider the overall effectiveness of adjuvanted influenza vaccination, the multivariable logistic models included, in addition to elderly status, the following confounding factors, which changed the crude-OR by more than 10%: drinking and smoking. The crude influenza vaccine effectiveness was 97.1% (88.3-99.3%) and the adjusted value was 94.8% (77.1-98.8%) ( Table 3) . If we consider the effectiveness of the Inflexal V ® vaccine, the multivariable logistic models included, in addition to elderly status, the following confounding factors, which changed the crude-OR by more than 10%: heart and respiratory diseases, drinking and smoking. The crude Inflexal V ® vaccine effectiveness was 98.0% (85.2-99.7%) and the adjusted value was 95.2% (62.8-99.4%) ( Table 3) . Regarding the Fluad ® vaccine, the multivariable logistic models included, in addition to elderly status, the following confounding factors, which changed the crude-OR by more than 10%: respiratory disease, drinking and smoking. The crude Fluad ® vaccine effectiveness was 95.2% (64.6-99.4%) and the adjusted value was 87.8% (0.0-98.9%) ( Table 3) . However, regarding the adjusted OR of Fluad ® , the analysis did not prove to be statistically significant (p = 0.09). Furthermore, the 95% CI of the adjusted OR (0.011-1.394) also confirmed that the adjusted OR (0.122) of Fluad ® should be considered only an indicative value. of cases and 24.1% of controls; pneumococcal vaccination status could not be ascertained in 105 cases and 70 controls. The number of subjects with three or more risk factors was significantly higher among cases (p = 0.0021) ( Table 1) . The influenza vaccination status of cases and controls is reported in Figure 1 . A total of 46.5% of the cases had been vaccinated; of these, 32.2%, 39.1% and 28.7% received Inflexal V ® , Fluad ® and Intanza ® , respectively. Only 3 of the vaccinated cases had no high-risk medical conditions. Specifically, 23 (26.4%) had 1 high-risk medical condition, 32 (36.8%) had 2 conditions, 14 (16.1%) had 3 conditions, 11 (12.6%) had 4 conditions, 3 (3.4%) had 5 conditions and 1 had 6 conditions. Fourteen (16.1%) vaccinated cases were smokers and 11 (12.6%) were drinkers. Among the controls, 79.1% had been vaccinated; of these, 52.0%, 36.5% and 11.5% received Inflexal V ® , Fluad ® and Intanza ® , respectively. High-risk medical conditions were recorded among vaccinated controls as follows: 21 subjects (14.2%) had no high-risk conditions, 58 (39.2%) had 1 condition, 52 (35.1%) had 2 conditions, 15 (10.1%) had 3 conditions and 2 (1.3%) had 4 conditions. Thirteen (8.8%) vaccinated controls were smokers and 6 (4.0%) were drinkers. Table 2 reveals that many elderly subjects with underlying chronic medical conditions were not vaccinated and were therefore exposed to a high risk of developing serious complications caused by influenza. For example, 52.6% and 46.5% of those with heart and respiratory diseases, respectively, were not vaccinated. In accordance with the aim of the study, the risk of hospitalization for pneumonia and/or influenza and the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in preventing hospitalization from Moreover, our study is the first to provide information on the effectiveness of the Inflexal V ® vaccine in terms of reducing hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia among subjects > 64 y, and demonstrates that this vaccine yields a high degree of protection. This information is consistent with the results obtained by Pregliasco et al. and Consonni et al., 22, 23 although these authors considered another outcome, i.e., the efficacy of virosomal influenza vaccine in preventing Influenza-Like Illness in the elderly. In particular, Consonni et al. who performed their study during the 2002-2003 influenza season, found a 62% rate of protection against ILI. 23 Our analysis showed much greater effectiveness in reducing hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia than other studies. Indeed, practically no other previous research has registered similar levels of effectiveness. Only one study, conducted by Puig-Barberà in 1994-96, found a vaccine efficacy of 79% with regard to radiologically confirmed pneumonia hospitalization, 26 and a case-control study performed by Herrera in 2003-04 showed 90% vaccine efficacy against influenza hospitalization, though that was in non-high-risk 50-64-y-old subjects. 27 It is important
