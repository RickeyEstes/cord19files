The results are produced using the discrete-event simulation approach outlined in Material and methods. While an analytical solution has been formulated (see electronic supplementary material B), it is not used due to computational feasibility issues associated with the substantial threshold found for F. tularensis. The programming language R has been used in the computation of these results. Before discussing the main results of this study, some of those deduced during the parametrization are firstly reviewed. In estimating the survival and death rate ( ยง2.2.3), the deterministic solution for extracellular bacteria over time (equation (2.1)) is fitted to data from the two in vivo studies (figure 3c). These data clearly suggest an initial drop in the number of extracellular bacteria followed by exponential growth (the rate of which is lower in less virulent strains [7] ). A birth-death model cannot represent these characteristics (not shown, but exemplified in [23] in fitting to guinea pig plague data), but an accurate portrayal is obtained by extending this standard approach to incorporate phagocytosis. Furthermore, fitting the birth-death deterministic solution only yields the net growth rate, l 2 m, which does not provide an explicit parametrization required to obtain the dose-response relation and incubation period distribution (by either the asymptotic approaches of [14] and [15] , or by the matrix-analytic approach detailed in the electronic supplementary material, A). It is assumed that clinical infection occurs when some threshold number of bacteria is in the system. The triggering of symptoms is a very complex process with few data available to validate more detailed models. It is likely that the threshold will vary by individual, and it appears that a fixed threshold poorly describes the data (figure 5) at higher doses given the variability assumed in the other parameters. This is because the process is more deterministic in the higher dose rangean observation consistent with the standard birth-death model with host homogeneity [5, 23] . On the other hand, if the threshold is lognormally distributed then, given deterministic exponential growth, the times at which the number of extracellular bacteria reach this threshold are normally distributed, as deduced for doses of 300 organisms and greater (not possible to verify from [43] owing to the recording sensitivity). This increased dispersion enables the model to capture the variability exhibited in the data for such doses. However, at lower doses, the majority of the variability is attributable to the stochastic in-host processes, so the characterization of the threshold itself plays a lesser role. This variability is caused by an initial bistability, but as the numbers of extracellular bacteria start to increase they reach a 'point of no return', from which the process becomes deterministic. This is supported in fitting the three-parameter lognormal distribution to low dose fixed threshold data, whereby an estimated location parameter of 3-4 days indicates the duration of the deterministic processes (cf. anthrax model of [47] ). For the same dose range with the distributed threshold model, this and some other standard two-parameter distributions are unable to represent the skewness and kurtosis of the modelled incubation period distributions (figure 6b). In fact, the only distribution, out of those considered, that is able to do so is the (four parameter) Johnson SU family of distributions. While the gamma distribution would appear to provide the least appropriate choice, the lognormal distribution-long associated with modelling incubation periods [57, 58] -is also clearly unsuitable. In summary, an extension to the standard birth-death process has allowed for the incorporation of phagocytosis-a fundamental mechanism undergone by intracellular bacteria. Also considered is the heterogeneity of individuals through a distributed threshold required for illness. For F. tularensis, this raises some interesting parallels to some of the classical dose-response models. First, the infection dynamics for dose-response can be simplified to the single-hit model, whereby the hit required for response is a failed phagocytosis. Second, the thresholds are found to be lognormally distributed, as in the probit model. These findings thus support the experimental evidence and postulations of [25, 26] that response is a mixture of both the hypotheses of independent action (single-hit model) and individual effective dose (probit model). Future uses of the model rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J. R. Soc. Interface 11: 20140119 considered here could include application to Coxiella burnetii (Q-fever) and L. pneumophila (Legionnaires' disease).
