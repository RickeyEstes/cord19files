Epidemiological characteristics of case categories A total of 131 confirmed H7N9 cases in 10 provinces in China were mapped as individual points based on detailed addresses (figure 2). Most of the patients (81%) were located in Jiangsu, Shanghai and Zhejiang Provinces. Most of the cases (73% or above) in the 10 provinces were severe. There were 25 mild cases, 56 severe cases without death, 39 severe cases with death and 11 unknown cases without death in China through 31 May 2013. Online supplementary figure S1 shows the rate, direction and scope of H7N9 spread. Each ellipse covers 95% of the incident cases for 1 week. The location of the first week of H7N9 onset was Shanghai. Over the next few weeks, the epidemic spread to Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces and continued to grow. The virus spread quickly from the northwest to the north and south regions. The onset of most H7N9 cases was relatively clustered. Within the total event timeframe (19 February and 21 May 2013), 74% of the cases were infected between 28 March and 17 April 2013 (see online supplementary figure S2). Severe cases with death were found in the initial and intermediate stages. The median age of patients with (table 3) . Data regarding hospital stay were available for 11 of the 25 mild cases, 19 of the 56 severe cases without death and 19 of the 39 severe cases with death. The mean length of stay was 9 days for mild cases, 18 days for severe cases without death and 20 days for severe cases with death. Data on the duration of ICU stay were available for 10 of the 56 severe cases without death and 11 of the 39 severe cases with death. Severe cases without death stayed in the ICU for a mean of 12 days, whereas severe cases with death stayed for a mean of 16 days. We assumed that the mean hospital stay of severe cases with complications was equal to the length of the ICU stay, although complications might occur incrementally. The mean duration of treatments was estimated based on a subset of investigated patients, except for glucocorticoids and intravenous immunoglobulin, for which estimates were obtained from professional experience. Treatment for complications required drugs and examinations in addition to the treatments listed above. Treatment was described for 111 confirmed H7N9 cases, along with the proportion of patients who received each treatment. 8 We assumed that the proportions were generalisable to all cases because it covered 85% of cases. Online Three types of losses were calculated for region 1: losses from poultry slaughter, lost live poultry sales and fees for market-stall leases. In the 10 affected provinces (region 2), in addition to the losses in region 1, the losses arose mainly from closing down live poultry markets in each province. These two losses were then summed to estimate PIL caused by H7N9 outbreaks. Most of the main live poultry markets in the affected provinces (figure 3) were obtained from Google Earth; the retail locations were excluded. PIL in eight non-affected adjacent provinces (region 3) were also calculated as potential economic losses. The direct PIL of 27 prefectures for the H7N9 cases are described in detail in table 4. The cost of closing down live poultry markets includes the lost live poultry sales and fees for market-stall leases. The cost of lost live poultry sales was calculated according to the daily live poultry sales, the cost per animal (assumed to be ¥10 or US$1.6 in this study) and the number of days the market was closed. The cost of market-stall leases was calculated based on the average lease per stall per day in the corresponding city, the number of stalls and the number of days the market was closed in each city. The cost of poultry slaughter was obtained from the number of poultry slaughtered and the cost per animal. The number of days the market was closed was counted through 31 May figure S4 . China's poultry industry suffered direct losses amounting to ¥7.75 billion (US$1.24) from when the first case of H7N9 was confirmed through 31 May 2013. Losses from the live poultry trade accounted for 98% of the total losses. Although it had only a few H7N9 cases, Shandong Province ranked first in losses among all 10 provinces at ¥1.81 billion (US$0.29); Jiangsu, Henan and Anhui ranked next with ¥1.28 billion(US$0.20), ¥1.15 billion(US$0.18) and ¥1.14 billion(US$0.18), respectively. These provinces have large poultry markets. Zhejiang Province had the highest number of confirmed cases; however, the losses in that region were not very high, as the sales of live poultry were lower. Strict prevention and control measures, such as daily cleaning of the market, weekly disinfection of the market and monthly closings of the live market were conducted in Guangdong Province, which reported no H7N9 cases until 31 May 2013 during the emergency response. These prevention and control measures affected the poultry industry. For this reason, the PIL in Guangdong Province are also given in table 5. Owing to timely control measures, the H7N9-affected regions were limited to 27 prefectures in 10 provinces in China. In this study, the potential economic risks were also calculated for the eight non-affected adjacent provinces (region 3, shadowed in figure 3 ). Online supplementary table S5 shows that the potential losses to the poultry industry in those regions amounted to ¥3.6 billion (US$0.58).
