An air-liquid interface culture system for differentiated porcine airway epithelial cells. To study the IAV infection in differentiated airway epithelial cells, we established an ALI culture system derived from the porcine airway. Primary PTEC and PBEC were isolated from the tracheae and bronchi, respectively, of swine that were shown by multiplex PCR to be negative for porcine respiratory tract pathogens. PTEC and PBEC were cultured under ALI conditions for four weeks. Histological staining of semi-thin sections indicated that both cultures showed the characteristic appearance of a pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium (Fig. 1A) , similar to that obtained by H&E staining of tissue derived from the primary bronchus and trachea of swine (Fig. 1B) . Examination by scanning electron microscopy revealed that the majority of cells contained cilia (Fig. 1C) . Furthermore, PTEC and PBEC were shown by fluorescent staining to contain ciliated, mucus-producing cells and basal cells (Fig. 2A) . These data indicate that the airway epithelial cells were well-differentiated. There were no major differences in the results obtained with PTEC and PBEC. Therefore, in the following part only results obtained with PBEC are shown. Sialic acid distribution on PBEC. The sialic acid distribution on well-differentiated PBEC (wdP-BEC) cultures was determined by lectin staining. Both α 2,3-linked (red) and α 2,6-linked sialic acids (green) were expressed on the apical surface of PBEC cultures but the α 2,6-linkage type was predominant (Fig. 2B) . Co-localization of Maackia amurensis agglutinin II (MAA II) and Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) signals (Fig. 2B , arrows) indicates that some cells expressed sialic acids in both linkage types. When lectins were applied from the basal side, wdPBEC were primarily stained by MAA II and hardly by SNA (Fig. 2C ). Strong MAA II staining is found in the same area that is stained by the basal cell marker (compare 2A and 2C) indicating that basal cells mainly contain α 2,3-linked sialic acids. The distribution of sialic acids in wdPBEC was analyzed also by co-staining of sialic acids and cilia or mucus markers. Both α 2,3 and α 2,6-linked sialic acids (green) were detected on ciliated cells (red), while non-ciliated cells predominantly contained α 2,6-linked sialic acid (Fig. 2D ). Mucin/mucus-producing cells (red) were found to have α 2,6-linked but not α 2,3-linked sialic acids (Fig. 2D ). Replication kinetics of human IAV. We used two recombinant human IAV, R1 and R2, to analyze the course of infection in ALI cultures. R1 is derived from the pandemic strain A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3N2) and has a binding preference to α 2,6-linked sialic acids. R2 differs from R1 by two mutations in the haemagglutinin and prefers binding to α 2,3-linked sialic acid 12 . WdPBEC cultures on filter supports were inoculated by R1 or R2 from the apical surface at an MOI of 0.25. At all time points analysed, the titre of R1 virus released from the apical side of wdPBEC was somewhat higher than that of R2 (Fig. 3A ). This result is consistent with the abundant presence of the α 2,6-linkage type on the apical surface, but it also shows that R2 is able to replicate to substantial titres despite the low amount of α 2,3-linked sialic acid detected by MAA staining (Fig. 2B ). When IAV was applied from the basal side of wdPBEC, there was no significant difference in the replication kinetics irrespective of the binding preference for α 2,3-or α 2,6-linked sialic acids (Fig. 3A ).
