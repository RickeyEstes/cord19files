A total of 134 calves were enrolled into the study (MAB, n = 72; MEP, n = 62). One Jersey calf was enrolled but subsequently removed from analysis; therefore, the final study population consisted of 133 Holstein calves. Bull calves made up 72 and 37% of the treatment and control groups, respectively. Fourteen (9 MAB and 4 MEP) calves failed to produce adequate fecal specimens on d 0 and were therefore excluded from the d-0 analyses. Health scores were missed on a single day for 2 calves (one MAB and one MEP), so their total health scores were omitted from analysis. All calves had equivalent PCV and STP concentrations when sampled on d 0, 7, and 14 (Table 1) . No calves died during the follow-up period. Median fecal pH in MAB calves was lower compared with MEP calves on d 0 (P = 0.02, Figure 1A ) and higher than MEP calves on d 14 (P = 0.01, Figure 1B Upon arrival, raw hipometer-derived weights (median, IQR) were 43 (41-45) kg and 45 (41-47) kg in MAB and MEP calves, respectively (P = 0.29). Hipometer weights (median, IQR) were 73 (70-77) kg and 70 (70-77) kg on d 56 in MAB and MEP calves, respectively (P = 0.10). The differences in hipometer estimated weights between enrollment and d 56 were higher in the MAB group (median = 30 kg, IQR = 28-33) compared with the MEP group (median = 27 kg, IQR = 24-32; P = 0.02). The raw ADG in MAB calves was 0.75 ± 0.11 kg/d, and the ADG in MEP calves was 0.78 ± 0.11 kg/d (P = 0.11). Multivariable linear regression models were also fit for the calf growth data.
