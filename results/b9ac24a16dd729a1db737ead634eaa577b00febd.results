A total of 3478 individuals were screened, of whom 820 passed the preliminary screening and 245 were finally enrolled into the study; 575 were excluded. Of these, 372 were lost to follow-up or refused enrollment; 178 did not meet the inclusion criteria; 25 met the exclusion criteria. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned to XTJYF (n = 123) or placebo (n = 122) treatment. Of these, 102 (83%) of the XTJYF group and 99 (81%) of the control group completed the whole study. Reasons for withdrawal from the study are listed separately for each treatment group in Figure 1 , and a detailed discussion on treatment tolerability is provided in Section 3.4. Table 2 shows that randomization was effective and that there were no significant differences between the two groups in baseline demographics, core clinical PTSD symptoms, or baseline SCL-90-R global indices. Even though individual SCL-90-R factor scores and sleep quality scores at baseline are not shown here, we checked all of them and founded no significant differences between the two groups. Notice that women constituted 72% of XTJYF-treated and 71% of placebo-treated patients. Ages ranged from 16 to 85; 64% were over 45. Table 3 shows the urgency of the public health needs of these earthquake-affected PTSD patients and indicates Table 4 shows that patients in the XTJYF group experienced statistically significant improvement after treatment in all three supplementary global index scores compared to the placebo group. Based on the reported effect sizes, XTJYF treatment has a moderate effect on GSI and PSDI indices and a small effect on the PST index. Our findings on the rate of response, defin-ed based on GSI score improvement, are displayed in Figure 2 ; 50% of the XTJYF patients versus 28% of those in the placebo group were "much improved," providing statistically significant evidence supporting the advantage of XTJYF over placebo at the level of 0.05 (P value = 0.001). The NNT is 4.55. Additionally, as Figure 2 shows, 20% of the XTJYF patients versus 12% of those in the placebo group were "very much improved," but this result is not statistically significant (P value = 0.12).
