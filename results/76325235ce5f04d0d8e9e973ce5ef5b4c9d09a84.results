A haemagglutinating agent was recovered from one piece of lung from the herd outbreak ; this was isolated using the amniotic cavity route, then subcultured using the allantoic cavity route . No agents were isolated from any other samples . The isolate, designated A/Swine/Weybridge/163266/87 (H3N2) was identified as an influenza A virus by immunodiffusion tests involving antisera to the appropriate matrix protein antigen . Specific antisera were prepared in chickens and ferrets, then tested against a range of HINT, H2N2 and H3N2 influenza A viruses . The results are shown in Table I , and indicate a low level of reactivity between the isolate and the human H3N2 strain A/Port Chalmers/1/73 . Further studies by Dr J . Skehel, Mill Hill, are listed in Table II . These show a relationship to H3N2 strains present in the human population in 1972 (A/ England/42/72), 1973 (A/Port Chalmers/1/73) and 1975 (A/Victoria/3/75) . Although there is close similarity between the isolate and recent H3N2 strains found in European pigs (Table II) , they are distinguishable . There is also a clear difference between this virus and a swine H3N2 isolated in Northern Ireland in 1986 (Dr J . Skehel, personal communication) . Neuraminidase-inhibition tests carried out by Dr Skehel showed a close relationship between the neuraminidase of A/Port Chalmers/1/73 and that of the isolate ; this test also shows the neuraminidase to be very similar to that of an isolate from Europe, SW/ OMS/3633/84 (Table III) . There was no clinical reaction seen in either the pig inoculated with the isolate, or in the sentinel, other than slight lethargy . The pigs were slaughtered 4 weeks after inoculation and no macroscopic lesions were detected . Virus was recovered from nasal swabs from the inoculated pig 1 and 3 days after inoculation, and from the sentinel at 7 days (strain A/Swine/Weybridge/163266/87) . At 14 days after inoculation, the HI antibody titres were 1/80 and 1/40 for the sentinel and inoculated animals respectively ; these had dropped to 1/40 and 1/20 at slaughter 2 weeks later . Serum samples taken before inoculation had shown no HI antibodies at a dilution of 1/10 . A preliminary survey of 834 adult pigs from 47 farms has shown that 255 pigs (31%) have antibody titres of 1/10 or higher, 140 (17%) have titres of 1/40 or higher . Twenty premises (43%) have pigs with titres of 1/40 or higher .
