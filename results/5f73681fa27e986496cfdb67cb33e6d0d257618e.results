The 17 viruses sought 16, 20 included some (human bocavirus, HBoV, and the polyomaviruses, KIPyV and WUPyV) with unclear aetiologies in the respiratory tract. In 660 of the specimens (52.9%), at least one virus was detected (Fig. 1) . HRVs were the most commonly detected virus group (Table 1; HRV primers from Arola et al. 22, 23 ) and were involved in the highest total number of co-detections, being found with another virus in 78 specimens (23.6% of HRV detections). However, a higher proportion of HBoV, HRSV, human adenovirus (HAdV), human coronavirus (HCoV), human enterovirus (HEV) and PyV positives were involved in co-detections (29.6% to 73.5%; Table 1 ). There was no difference in age among the patients either according to number of co-detections (p = 0.27) or whether or not an HRV was present (p = 0.20). There was no difference in the proportion of co-detections involving an HRV according to presentation with URTI or LRTI (p = 0.34). There was a consistent pattern of HRV detection associated with a reduced likelihood of co-detection with a number of other viruses. Both the univariate contingency table analyses and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed similar trends (Tables 1-3) . For example, from Table 1 , an HRV detection resulted in a reduced likelihood of co-detecting eight viruses or virus groups (HAdV, HCoV, IFAV, HBoV, HMPV, HRSV, HPIV or KIPyV) as reflected by an odds ratio (OR) of <1. HRSV was involved with six negative associations, HMPV and HBoV with four and HPIV with only three. Of these, all are RNA viruses except HBoV. HRSV and HMPV exhibited different association patterns despite shared genetic features and clinical impact. HRSV, HMPV and HPIV did not occur together in our specimen set. The only positive association to reach significance was the pairing of HBoV and WUPyV. Eleven virus pairs (models) were selected for logistic regression analysis ( Table 3 ). All models were consistent with results from the univariate analyses, but some added information relating to season and age group. For example there was a reduced likelihood (OR <1) of an HBoV detection among toddlers, during autumn or if an HRV had been detected. To investigate whether a particular HRV strain or group of strains drove the trends we observed, we randomly selected 10% of HRV PCR-positive specimens and sequenced a portion of the 5 untranslated region. 24 Nearest matches by comparative BLAST analysis indicated both classic and novel strains of HRV species A (HRV-78, 82, 49, 94, 44, 29, 65, 19, 56, NAT040, NAT049) , only a few from species B (HRV-6, NAT066) and strains belonging to the putative new species, HRV C (similar to HRV-QPM, 17 QPID03-0013, 16 QPID03-0009, HRV-C024, 18 HRV-C025, NAT083 19 and Antwerp HRV strains 25 ).
