Inhibition of PCV2 viral protein synthesis in cell culture by shRNA is sequence-specific and dose-dependent To test whether RNAi could inhibit PCV2 in cell culture, we generated six shRNA-expressing plasmids targeting the ORF1 and ORF2 regions of the PCV2 genome (Fig. 1A) for their ability to suppress expression of PCV2 viral proteins. The PK15 cells were transfected with the shRNA-expressing plasmids and then infected with PCV2, and the levels of PCV2 viral protein production were determined by IFA at 48 h after infection. The time points for measuring the effects of shRNA in cells were chosen following preliminary optimization experiments (data not shown). To confirm the specificity of the inhibition, pVP2, an shRNA-expressing plasmid directed against porcine parvovirus viral sequence, was used as a negative control in the experiments. The results showed that all shRNA-expressing plasmids targeting the PCV2 genome caused a decrease in PCV2 antigen levels to varying degrees (Figs. 1B and C). Among these specific shRNAs, pSIR3 and pSIR6 exhibited the highest level of inhibition (Figs. 1B and C). Therefore, we chose these two shRNA-expressing plasmids for the following experiments. In contrast to the PCV2-specific shRNAs, the control pVP2 had no effect on PCV2 antigen level in the treated cells, indicating that inhibition by the PCV2-targeted shRNAs was specific and due to RNAi. A dose -response analysis ( Fig. 2A ) was conducted by transfecting PK15 cells with increasing amounts of pSIR3, pSIR6, or negative control pVP2-expressing plasmid followed by measuring the numbers of PCV2 antigen cells by IFA 72 h post-transfection. The results showed that, at concentrations of 1500 to 2500 ng shRNA-expressing plasmid per 5 Ã‚ 10 4 cells, the highest level of inhibition (fivefold) of viral antigen was obtained with pSIR3 and pSIR6 plasmids, whereas pVP2 had no effect ( Fig. 2A) . At higher doses of shRNA, we observed a slight nonspecific inhibitory effect of pVP2 on viral protein production ( Fig. 2A ). In addition, kinetic study results (Fig. 2B ) revealed a continuous trend in the specific inhibition of PCV2 viral production by pSIR3 and pSIR6 from 48 to 120 h after transfection. The inhibition of PCV2 viral production was maximal at 72 h but thereafter started to decline by 96 h after transfection.
