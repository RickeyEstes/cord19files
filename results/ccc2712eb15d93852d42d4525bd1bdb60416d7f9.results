All cytokines were constitutively transcribed. IL-1b and TNF-a were detected in all samples. IL-6 was not detected in two samples (each one from a cat aged 3 yr 1 mo and 3 yr 11 mo), IL-10 was not detected in two samples (each one from a cat aged 3 yr 9 mo and 5 yr 2 mo), and IL-12p40 was not detected in four samples (each one from a cat aged 3 yr 1 mo and 3 yr 11 mo and two cats aged 5 yr 2 mo). Transcription levels were generally variable, both among cats of the same age (Fig. 1 ) and in individual cats at different time points. IL-1b was overall transcribed most intensely, followed by TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-10. IL-12 p40 levels were generally very low (Fig. 1) . For IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-12 p40, a statistically significant association was found between the level of transcription and age. Higher transcription levels were noted in younger and older cats than in those of middle age (Fig. 1) . For IL-1b and IL-6, transcription levels were similar in the youngest and oldest cats, whereas IL-12 p40 transcription was highest in the youngest cats. For IL-10, an overall decline in constitutive transcription with age was indicated, but not statistically significant (Fig. 1) . TNF-a levels were on average less variable throughout the examination period. A slight drop in transcription was observed in the middle-aged cats, but not statistically significant (Fig. 1) . The multivariable regression analysis did not identify more suitable models to evaluate the association between cytokine transcription levels and age. Results of the Pearson correlation coefficients matrix are illustrated in Table 1 . Transcription of IL-1b and IL-6 appeared highly correlated, independent of age. A trend for a positive correlation between IL-1b and age was found as well as a moderate negative correlation between IL-12 p40 transcription and age.
