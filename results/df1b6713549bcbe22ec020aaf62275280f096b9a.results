Subjects were well matched for age, sex and height, but those with CF had lower weight, body mass index and lung function (table 1). All subjects completed the cough manoeuvres safely. Four patients with CF were studied during a pulmonary exacerbation. Within the CF group there was no significant change in spirometry between study days (intraclass correlation coefficient (95% CI) 0.79 (0.48 to 0.92)). Similarly, total CFUs for P aeruginosa in cough aerosols, cough counts and log P aeruginosa sputum concentration within subjects were highly repeatable (see online supplementary table S1). Eighteen patients with CF produced sputum and one provided a cough swab (table 1) , with P aeruginosa isolated from all and 15/19 (79%) yielding at least one mucoid isolate. Sputum P aeruginosa concentrations ranged from 4.0×10 6 to 4.2×10 9 CFU/mL. Genotypic analysis revealed 12 strains shared commonly within the Australian CF community 11 ; AUST-01 (1), AUST-02 (7), AUST-06 (2), AUST-07 (1) and AUST-19 (1), and seven unique strains. Five patients harboured two different strains. Other organisms cultured are detailed in table 1. P aeruginosa was cultured in cough aerosols from all patients with CF, but not from any controls. Viable P aeruginosa was isolated at 4 m from 17/18 (94%) and at all distances from 16/18 (89%) of the CF group (figure 1). Aerosolised P aeruginosa remained viable for 45 min from 14/18 (78%) subjects in the duration experiments (figure 2). Most viable P aeruginosa isolates were cultured from particles <3.3 μm (table 2) and the strains cultured from cough aerosols were genotypically indistinguishable from those isolated in respiratory samples from the same patient. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Arxula adeninivorans were also cultured in cough aerosols and sputum from two patients. No other respiratory pathogens cultured in sputum were isolated from cough aerosols. No P aeruginosa or other microbes identified in cough aerosols were isolated from surface swabs or blank aerosol samples taken during the studies (see online supplementary methods). Marked intersubject heterogeneity was seen in the total numbers of viable P aeruginosa cultured from cough aerosols (figure 1; see online supplementary table S2). Measured P aeruginosa CFUs decreased with the distance the aerosol travelled and with the ageing time; CFUs were significantly higher at 1 m than 4 m, and at 5 min than 45 min (table 2). CFUs remained significantly higher for both distance and duration when corrected for the effects of stacking (see online supplementary table S3). In both distance and duration studies, strong correlations were seen between total, small and large fraction cough aerosols (r=0.90-1.0). A positive correlation was found between sputum and aerosol P aeruginosa CFUs in both distance (r=0.73-0.78) and duration (r=0.85-0.90; see online supplementary table S4) studies, although there was no significant correlation found between clinical or demographic variables and cough aerosols produced in either study. Correlations for these variables were unchanged when measured CFUs were corrected for stacking (see online supplementary table S5) The influences of biological decay and room ventilation on P aeruginosa in cough aerosols were modelled (see online supplementary methods). Environmental conditions in the Duration Rig were similar to those in the air-conditioned clinical setting. The number of viable P aeruginosa in cough aerosol followed an exponential decay with a half-life of 50 min (95% CI 30 to 151 min). Room ventilation removed additional viable P aeruginosa and became the dominant mechanism of removal at ventilation rates above the biological decay rate of the cough aerosol (ie, approximately 0.85 ACH). Figure 3 shows the time taken to achieve 10, 50, 90, 99 and 99.9% reductions in airborne P aeruginosa following the departure of a source patient, including the combined effects of biological decay and room ventilation. At 2 ACH, 90% of viable airborne P aeruginosa are removed in approximately 49 min (95% CI 41 to 61 min), decreasing as ventilation rate increases to approximately 24 min (95% CI 22 to 26 min) at 5 ACH and to 13 min (95% CI 12 to 13 min) at 10 ACH.
