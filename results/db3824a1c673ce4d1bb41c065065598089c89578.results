In this population-based case-control study a total of 834 hematological patients were recruited. Demographic and clinical characteristics of these patients are summarized in Table 2 . IA and non-IA patients had similar age but male patients were more prone to develop IA than females (male/female ratio = 1.86 vs. 1.18, P = 0.015). HSCT was common and equally distributed between IA and non-IA groups (45.85 vs. 45.49%) and the underlying disease (hematological disorder) was also uniform between both groups ( Table 2) . As expected, patients without prophylaxis were more prone to develop IA compared to those patients who take antifungal drugs (23.28 vs. 14.51%; Table 2 ). All SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg in the control group with the exception of the REL rs13031237 that was excluded from further analyses (non-IA; P < 0.001). Allele and genotype frequencies of selected SNPs were in line with those reported in Hapmap. Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, country of origin, allo-HSCT, and underlying disease showed that none of the selected SNPs was significantly associated with the risk of IA according to codominant, dominant, recessive and log-additive models of inheritance (Table 3 ). In addition, although prophylaxis status was only partially available in our population (n = 618), no significant changes in association estimates were observed when this clinical variable was included as covariate for adjustment (data not shown). No significant associations between the NFκB1, NFκB2, cRel, RelB, and IRF4 polymorphisms and IA risk were also found in an allo-HSCTrestricted analysis considering donor genotypes and IA episodes occurred after transplantation ( Table 4) . Although our statistical power was limited (Supplementary Table 1) , we found a fairly weak association of the IRF4 rs12203592T/T genotype with the risk of developing the infection at the nominal significance level of P < 0.05. Carriers of the IRF4 rs12203592T/T genotype showed a six-fold increased risk of developing IA when compared with patients carrying the wild type C-allele (OR REC = 6.24, 95%CI 1.25-31.2, P = 0.026). Interestingly, we found that the presence of the minor allele of the rs12203592 (T) strongly correlated with IRF4 mRNA expression levels in whole blood samples and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphocytes (P = 6.0 • 10 −7 and P = 3.0 • 10 −7 , respectively), which suggested a possible functional role of this polymorphism. Based on these interesting results, we decided to explore the potential functional impact of this polymorphism using Haploreg and ENCODE annotation data. This analysis revealed that the IRF4 rs12203592 SNP resides on a strong enhancer and near of an active promoter that might constitute a regulatory element for IRF4. In addition, this analysis showed that this intronic polymorphism was predicted to change binding motifs for NFκB, HDAC2, and HMG-IY, which are proteins implicated in the transcriptional regulation of multiple innate and adaptive immune-related genes (Liu et al., 2001; Hayden et al., 2006; Falkenberg and Johnstone, 2014) . In line with the findings suggesting a functional role of this variant, we also found that the rs12203592 SNP mapped among promoter and enhancer histone marks in different primary T-cell subtypes (TCD8+, TCD4+, Treg, and Th17) of different origin (peripheral blood, hematopoietic stem cells, cord blood, etc.) but also in primary B-cells, natural killer cells and monocytes. Although at this point it was tempting to speculate that the IRF4 rs12203592 SNP might play a role in modulating the risk of developing IA likely through the regulation of IRF4 mRNA expression levels, the association of this SNP with IA risk did not remained significant after correction for multiple testing (P = 0.001; Table 4 ) and, therefore, requires further confirmation. In agreement with the single-SNP analysis, haplotype association analysis showed fairly weak associations of the IRF4 AATC and IRF4 GGTC haplotypes (not including the IRF4 rs12203592T risk allele) with a decreased risk of IA. However, these associations were of similar magnitude to the one observed for the IRF4 rs12203592 SNP in the single-SNP analysis (OR = 0.28, 95%CI 0.08-0.95, P = 0.042 and OR = 0.04, 95%CI 0.00-0.71; Table 5 ) suggesting that the haplotypic effect was due to this intronic variant. Finally, given the involvement of physiological complexes (p50/p65, p52/RelB, and p65-c-Rel) in the activation of the NFκB signaling pathway and the role of the p52/RelB complex in the transcriptional activation of the IRF4 (Boddicker et al., 2015) , we also decided to investigate whether NFκB-related SNPs might interact to each other to modify the risk of IA. Results of the MDR analysis evaluating all possible combinations among the NFκBrelated SNPs are shown in Table 6 and Figure 1 . The best model suggested an interaction between the REL rs842647 , NFκB2 rs1056890 , IRF4 rs7768807 , and REL rs13017599 SNPs to synergistically increase the risk of developing IA (TA = 0.5488, P Sign = 0.0010). Although this model was the best to predict IA and presented a high cross validation consistency (CVC) (9/10), it did not remain statistically significant following 1000-fold permutation test (P = 0.31). In addition, we found a significant 2-locus interaction model including the NFκB2 rs1056890 and IRF4 rs7768807 SNPs to increase the risk of getting the infection (TA = 0.5353, P Sign = 0.0010) but this interaction model also failed to retain statistical significance after 1000-fold permutation test (P = 0.47; Table 6 ). None of the best models included the IRF4 rs12203592 SNP.
