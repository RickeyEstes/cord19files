Of the 84 patients with bronchiolitis hospitalised during the 11-week study period, 36 were excluded for the following reasons: cardiac disease (2), chronic lung disease with home oxygen (2), Down's syndrome (3) , no parental consent (12), age > two (7), missed inclusion (6), missing nasal wash specimen at admission (3). A total of 48 patients completed the study ( Table 2 ). The distribution of viral pathogens is shown in Table 3 ; RSV was the major pathogen detected in 83%. Co-infection was found in 11 (22.9%) patients, nine of whom were already co-infected at admission, and two acquired co-infection during admission. Of all included patients, 37 (77.1%) had shared a room with other bronchiolitis patients, 20 of whom (54.1%) had shared a room with a patient infected with a different virus. The two patients who acquired co-infection during admission had never shared a room with another patient. None of the bronchiolitis-patients sharing rooms had been infected with another virus during admission. Co-infected patients did not suffer from more severe disease than patients infected with a single virus, but, al-though not statistically significant, disease severity tended to be higher in RSV-infected patients compared to RSV-negative patients (Table 4 ).
