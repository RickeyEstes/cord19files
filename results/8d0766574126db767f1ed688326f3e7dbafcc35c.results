Conclusions: This study is one of the few that examined the presence of HPV in urine samples from patients referred to a colposcopy unit. High HPV type-specific concordance between cervical and urine samples and good sensitivity of urine detection are reported. Only specimens with two or more epithelial cells in 400 Â· magnification are worth processing with the more expensive HPV detection method. This report supports the possibility that self-testing for HPV, using urine, will one day give to low-income groups and specific populations like young adolescents a good screening alternative. Objectives: Several diagnostic tests for the detection of SARS antibodies from serum have been previously evaluated, including ELISA and IIFT assays. This study evaluated a novel protein chip assay, the Coronavirus Protein Microarray (CoV-PM), that has been developed for the detection of antibodies to multiple coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, comparing it to the currently accepted commercially available gold standard assay, the EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV IgG Indirect Immunofluorescence test (IIFT). Methods: The CoV-PM comprised of all the SARS-CoV proteins and protein fragments, along with proteins from 5 additional coronaviruses that infect human, cats, mice and cows. The arrays were used to probe a selection of 399 previously validated, challenge samples of human sera for antibodies to SARS-CoV that included samples from the same patients from different dates. These sera included 40 SARS-CoV IgG-negatives (neg) from acute SARS cases (ACUT), 164 SARS-CoV IgG positive (pos) from convalescent cases (CONV), 112 SARS-CoVneg from patients with other respiratory illness (RESP), and 84 from healthcare workers (HCW; 17 SARS-CoV IgG pos; 66 neg). Each grid on the CoV-PM was probed with 1 lL serum/patient, reacted with fluorescently labeled antibodies and signals were detected using a standard microarray scanner. Scans were analysed by two readers using a programme developed to predict the nature of each serum. Results: Of the 181 SARS-CoV-pos sera, 168 were read as positive by CoV-PM by both readers (93.3% sensitivity), while 8 CONV sera were read as CoV-PM pos by one reader but not by the other, whereas 16 and 7 were called neg and inconclusive by both readers. Interestingly, in the majority of cases, SARS-CoV pos sera that tested discrepant by CoV-PM were CoV-PM pos in other samples from the same patients from later dates. 64 HCW, 40 ACU and 100 RESP from 218 SARS-CoV-neg sera were CoV-PM-neg (specificity 99.1%), with SARS-CoV antibodies found in 1 HCW and 1 RESP while 2 others were inconclusive. Some of the SARS-CoV pos sera also reacted with 229E proteins, suggesting concurrent or prior infection with this coronavirus; some sera within this selection tested positive for 229E/OC43 by Western blot assay. Conclusions: The CoV-PM appears to be a sensitive and specific method for the detection of SARS-CoV antibodies from serum. The added value of its ability to detect antibodies to other coronaviruses requires further evaluation. The prevalence of respiratory viruses in hospitalised patients is rather unclear. Due to the rather large effort of reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR methods, the poor sample quality of many specimens and the sensitivity of most rapid antigen detection tests, many viruses are not diagnosed. With nucleic acid tetection methods there is also question, whether there are acute replicating viruses or residual genetic material detected. In this presentation we describe our results from a study using a combined cell culture/PCR method suitable for detection of productive infection of different respiratory viruses. By cultivation of a total of 266 nasopharyngeal secretions and bronchioalveolar lavages (BAL) from children hospitalized in the local paediatrics department and from adult transplant patients on HEp-2 human larynx epithelial and MA-104 monkey kidney cells we were able to detect also slow growing viruses like human metapneumovirus (HMPV). The method was also able to detect Parainfluenza Virus or Rhinoviruses and to a certain extent Adenoviruses. Additionally Influenzaviruses, Respiratory-Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Adenoviruses were detected by commercial antigen detection assays. The epidemiology of respiratory viruses in Western Austria for the winter season 2003/04 reveals a Parainfluenza 1 outbreak as confirmed by sequencing right before the main Flu season, a relatively weak RSV season and many of HMPV isolations with some double infections as indicated below. Additionally the samples were also tested for 'exotic'agents like Mimiviridae. Mimiviruses are a new species which has been described most recently in water amoeba and their nearest relatives appear to be aquatic Phycodnaviruses. As replication of Mimivirus similar to the Leginella spp., which also replicate in amoeba, has been suggested to occur also in alveolar cells of humans we decided to test our patient samples using a 'suicide-PCR' protocol. Conclusions: Biofilm formation is present to the same extent in both, FBI-associated and 'wild type' Staphylococcus epidermidis strains demonstrating the potential of skin flora to cause FBIs. Although it is well known that nosocomial Staphylococcus epidermidis are resistant to multiple antibiotics, the 'wild type' isolates show alarming resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin possibly reflecting the abundant use of macrolides for minor infections in the population. Objectives: Biofilm expression in Staphylococcus epidermidis is a major virulence factor and attachment to polymeric surfaces leads to reduced susceptibility against antimicrobial substances. The alternative sigma factor SigmaB is an important regulator of biofilm formation in S. epidermidis. However, biofilm formation is under influence of additional yet uncharacterized regulators, which were examined in this study. Methods: The Tn917 insertion of the biofilm-negative mutant M12 generated in the biofilm-positive genetic background of S. epidermidis 1457 was identified by arbitrary PCR. The transcription of the icaADBC locus, essential for biofilm formation as well as of the inactivated genes was investigated. The function of the inactivated genes was characterized by complementation studies under different environmental conditions. Results: In M12 Tn917 was inserted at the distal end of an orf homologous to the regulatory gene purR in Bacillus subtilis. The gene upstream of purR is conserved between S. epidermidis, B. subtilis, and S. aureus furthermore two additional orfs (orf3 and orf4) homologous to B. subtilis, and S. aureus are located downstream of the Tn917 insertion site. Within the purR genes of S. epidermidis, B. subtilis, and S. aureus a highly conserved motif homologous to the consensus sequence for SigmaB dependent promoters was identified upstream of Tn917. The SigmaB dependent transcription of the orf3 and orf4 could be demonstrated in mutants with inactivation of sigB. In M12 transcription of the biofilm associated genes icaADBC was abolished, whereas the transcription of their negative regulatory gene icaR was unaffected. Complementation with the single genes showed no effect in M12, whereas complementation of M12 with orf3 and orf4 together was able to restore biofilm formation under high osmotic conditions. Interestingly, under standard conditions used for biofilm formation as well as under biofilm induction with subinhibitory concentrations of ethanol no biofilm formation was observed in the complemented mutant. Conclusions: We identified two new regulators of S. epidermidis biofilm formation, which we designate now as biofilm accumulation regulators A and B (barAB). BarA and B act as positive regulators of icaADBC transcription independent of the regulatory gene icaR. BarAB is a SigmaB dependent gene locus, which is at least partially responsible for the NaCl induction of biofilm formation in S. epidermidis.
