HBoV DNA was detected in NPA samples from 1 (0.8%) of 126 symptomatic adults (71 years of age) and from 31 (13.8%) of 225 symptomatic children (mean age 17 months, median age 15 months). However, HBoV was detected more frequently (43%, p<0.001) in the 100 asymptomatic control children (mean age 22 months, median age 23 months). Another virus was detected in 22 (71%) of 31 HBoV-positive NPAs from symptomatic children. The virus most commonly co-isolated with HBoV was hRSV (16/31, 52%), followed by infl uenza A/B (3 cases), hMPV (3 cases), adenovirus (1 case), and parainfl uenza virus (1 case). Two children were infected with 2 other viruses in addition to HBoV. The median age of symptomatic children with HBoV infection (15 months) was signifi cantly greater than that of symptomatic children without HBoV infection (8 months; p<0.0001). The hospital length of stay was similar for children positive for HBoV DNA (mean 5.1 days, median 4 days) and those negative for HBoV DNA (mean 6.6 days, median 3 days) (p = 0.9). Clinical characteristics of HBoV-positive children are summarized in the Table. There were signifi cantly fewer bronchiolitis episodes in children infected only with HBoV than in children infected only with hRSV (p<0.0001). None of the children with single HBoV infections and only 2 (6%) of all 31 HBoV-infected children were admitted to the intensive care unit. In the control group of asymptomatic children who underwent elective surgery, ear, nose, and throat surgery was more frequently performed in children with HBoV infections (36/43, 84%) than in children without HBoV infections (35/57, 61%) (p = 0.014). Ear, nose, and throat elective surgeries consisted mainly of myringotomies, adenoidectomies, and tonsillectomies. The 1 adult with an HBoV infection was a 71-year-old man (a smoker) who came to the hospital for a COPD exacerbation and was treated with systemic corticosteroids and antimicrobial drugs. No other microbiologic agents (bacteria or viruses) could be identifi ed in his sputum or NPA. He was hospitalized for 11 days. Sequence analysis of the HBoV VP1/VP2 genes performed on â‰ˆ50% of HBoV-positive specimens showed 2 distinct clades of viruses (Figure) . These genotypes clustered with the original strains described by Allander et al. (ST1, GenBank accession no. DQ000495, and ST2, Gen-Bank accession no. DQ000496) (1). There was no temporal link between the clades because both were equally distributed throughout the study period. No obvious relationship was found between clades and the presence or absence of symptoms.
