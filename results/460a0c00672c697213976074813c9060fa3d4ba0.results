The hel/N complex relocalizes to sites of M accumulation at late times of infection Using hel as a marker for the hel/N/p28/RNA complexes and M as a marker for sites of virion assembly, we sought to determine whether the localization of hel/N complexes changed during the course of infection. DBT cells were mock-infected or infected with MHV-A59 for 5.5, 8, or 12 h and probed with antibodies directed against hel (B1) and M (J.1.3), followed by analysis using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2) . These times were chosen since we have previously shown that the rate of MHV RNA synthesis is maximal at 5 to 6 h p.i. in DBT cells and production of progeny virus is still active at 12 h p.i. (Kim et al., 1995) . Neither hel, M, nor N was detected in mock-infected DBT cells ( Fig. 2A) . In MHV-infected cells, hel and M were distinct at 5.5 h p.i., with hel detected as punctate cytoplasmic foci and M as a typical perinuclear "cap." However, when cells were probed at 8 and 12 h p.i., hel and M were no longer distinct, but rather were extensively colocalized (Figs. 2B and 2C). The colocalization of hel and M was detected in a more prominent perinuclear pattern similar to that seen with M alone at 5.5 h p.i. Although the degree of hel/M colocalization varied from cell to cell in the infected monolayer at each time point, the number of cells with significant hel/M colocalization increased between 6 and 8 h p.i. (data not shown). Hel/M colocalization was predominant by 12 h p.i. We therefore chose 5.5 and 12 h p.i. as the early and late time points for subsequent experiments. To determine whether hel was relocalizing independent of the complexes containing hel, N, and viral RNA, we investigated whether other components of the complex also relocalized at sites of M accumulation by 12 h p.i. Nucleocapsid protein was chosen since it has previously been shown to colocalize with hel by both confocal immunofluorescence and biochemical fractionation Sims et al., 2000) . When a direct comparison of N and hel localization was performed at 5.5 h p.i., hel and N colocalized in punctate cytoplasmic foci (Fig. 2C ), in agreement with our previous results . When cells were probed for hel and N at 12 h p.i., hel and N retained their colocalization both in single cells and in syncytia (Fig. 2C ). This result suggested that both hel and N were relocalizing in intact complexes at late times of infection. To demonstrate this directly, the localization of N with respect to M was analyzed at 5.5 and 12 h p.i. At 5.5 h p.i., foci of N were entirely distinct from sites of M concentration, but by 12 h p.i., N was extensively colocalized with M in perinuclear foci, in a pattern indistinguishable from that with hel and M. The N/M colocalization was observed both in individual cells (data not shown) and in syncytia. Together these results demonstrated that the intact membranous complexes containing hel and N were relocalized to sites of M accumulation.
