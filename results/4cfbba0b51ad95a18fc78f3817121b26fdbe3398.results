During the first five months (May through September 2013) of the observed PEDv epidemic in the studied production system, 30 of 47 sow farms were infected. The epidemic began slowly with just a few sow farms infected, followed by a sudden increase in infection in mid-June, which was associated with the introduction and spread of the virus in Region I (Fig. 2) . No new sow farms were infected between July 3 until October 30, 2013, which is beyond the time period of our model.
