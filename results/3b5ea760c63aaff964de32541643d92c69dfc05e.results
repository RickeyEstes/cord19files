In this study different virus concentration and nucleic acid extraction methods were evaluated for metagenomic analysis of sewage samples. Sequencing results showed that the majority of the mapped reads (>80%) were of viral origin (S1 Fig). However, between 60 and 90% of the total reads were unmapped. The three main viral families detected were Adenoviridae (human viruses) including the spiked HAdV 35, Virgaviridae (plant viruses), and Siphoviridae (bacteriophages). The sequencing data were analyzed further to determine the viral community composition, viral specificity, viral richness, and detection of pathogenic species.
