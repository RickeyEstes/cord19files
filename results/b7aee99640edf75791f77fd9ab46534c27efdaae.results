The initial data set downloaded on 16 October 2017 included 256 544 clinical trials registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. A total of 166 415 interventional trials were registered from 1 October 2007, after enactment of mandatory registration on 27 September 2007, through 30 September 2017, providing a 10-year period for studying trends in registered trials. Of these, 13 707 trials (8.5%) were defined as the ID trial data set. A summary of ID trials, non-ID trials, and selected subcategories (HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, malaria, skin and softtissue infection, and lower respiratory tract infection [LRTI]) is presented in Table 1 [15] . These categories were chosen for further analysis based on their prevalence as well as global and domestic significance. The primary purpose was "treatment" in the majority of both ID (52.7%) and non-ID trials (69.6%). A higher proportion of ID trials than non-ID trials focused on prevention (32.5% vs 9.1%, respectively). In terms of intervention type, ID trials also tended to be more drug focused than non-ID trials (54.4% vs 50.3%, respectively) and more biologic/ vaccine focused (23.5% vs 5.0%). Of 3215 ID trials with a biologic or vaccine intervention, 85.3% evaluated a vaccine. ID trials were less likely than non-ID trials to concern interventions involving procedures (4.2% vs 10.7%, respectively) or devices (5.9% vs 14.2%). ID trials also tended to be larger than non-ID trials, with a median (interquartile range) enrollment of 102 (37-321.5) versus 60 (27-145) subjects for non-ID studies. The largest studies were observed for Enterovirus trials (mean enrollment, 6855 subjects; median, 780), trachoma (mean, 5035; median 1139), intestinal nematode infection (mean, 4323; median, 172), and malaria (mean, 3652; median, 141). These results were due primarily to the inclusion of multiple large (>10 000-subject) studies, including 5 Enterovirus, 1 trachoma, 2 intestinal nematode infection, and 28 malaria trials. Five trials included ≥100 000 subjects, 1 for intestinal nematode infection trial and 4 for malaria. However, only the Enterovirus and trachoma categories had median enrollments of >500 subjects. A greater percentage of ID trials focused specifically on children (≤18 years of age (13.3%), compared with non-ID trials (6.3%). Moreover, ID trials were more likely than non-ID trials to exclude elderly patients (>65 years of age) (32.8% vs 2.9%, respectively). After omission of trials restricted to pediatric subjects, ID trials were still more likely than non-ID trials to exclude elderly patients (21.3% vs 17.8%, respectively). Omitting trials restricted to pediatrics, we observed that certain trial categories excluded elderly patients at higher rates: pharmacology (54.5%), HIV/AIDS (31.4%), influenza vaccine (29.8%), malaria (28.6%), and tuberculosis (21.7%) trials were more likely to exclude the elderly. In line with non-ID trials, the majority of ID trials were randomized (85.9%) and did not use masking protocols (57.1%). ID trials were less likely than non-ID trials to occur in North America (37.8% vs 44.9%) or Europe (24.5% vs 29.2%). Of the 13 707 ID trials, 11 881 (86.7%) were assigned to 1 clinical subcategory, 1754 (12.8%) were assigned to 2, and 72 (0.5%) were assigned to ≥3 . The distribution of trials across the 60 ID subcategories is presented in Figure 1 . The 4 most common trial categories (HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, influenza vaccine, and LRTI) accounted for 35.6% of all ID trials, in terms of trials assigned solely to those categories (4875 trials; Figure 1 ). Figure 1 also shows the total number of subjects enrolled or expected to be enrolled in each ID subcategory. HIV/AIDS had the highest numbers of trials and enrolled subjects. Despite having fewer trials, malaria and tuberculosis had the second and fourth highest numbers of enrolled subjects, owing to relatively large enrollment sizes. Based on their frequency in the database and their global impact, 10 subcategories were chosen for more detailed characterization. The representation of these selected subcategories within the ClinicalTrials.gov ID data set was compared with global and United States ID-related deaths and DALYs (as defined by the WHO Global Burden of Disease) and is shown in Figure 2 . Hepatitis C trials accounted for 8.7% of ID trials registered from 2007-2017. This was similar to the hepatitis C virus-associated morbidity rate in the United States (6.3%) but higher than the global hepatitis C virus-associated morbidity rate (0.7%). Similarly, trials of HIV/ AIDS, hepatitis B, and sexually transmitted disease excluding HIV were overrepresented compared with both global and US burden of disease, whereas LRTI trials were underrepresented. Notably, diarrheal disease and tuberculosis trials were underrepresented compared with the global burden of disease (4.1% vs 16.7%, and 3.5% vs 11.0%, respectively). Hepatitis C trials were selected for additional scrutiny owing to the considerable advancements in hepatitis C treatment over the 10-year study period [16] . Hepatitis C trials tended to be more focused on treatment (89.0%) and specifically drug intervention (89.1%) than the rest of the ID trials (54.5%). They were also more likely to be funded by industry (72.0% vs 40.5%). Hepatitis C trials registered by year were pooled by phase as follows: early phase 1 trials were considered to be phase 1, phase 1/phase 2 trials were considered phase 2, and phase 2/ phase 3 trials were considered phase 3. The distribution of the phases of hepatitis C trials is presented in Figure 4 , along with key dates for these drugs, including date of first registration in ClinicalTrials.gov and date of FDA approval [17] [18] [19] [20] . As these new hepatitis C drugs entered into clinical testing, there is a phase shift evident in the trial phase, which begins with a predominance of phase 1, then advancing through the subsequent phases over time. Funding sources for hepatitis C trials per year are shown in Figure 4B . In general, industry funding plateaued in study years 2011 and 2012, with industry being the primary funding source for >80% of trials and dropping to 52.9% of studies by 2011. NIH funding fluctuated, but the NIH was the main funder for <10% of hepatitis C trials for all study years.
