Production of a CHO Cell Line Secreting rHuMig. CHO cells were transfected with the pMSXND plasmid into which had been inserted HuMig cDNA sequences, and rHuMig-secreting cell lines were derived by selection in methotrexate as detailed in Materials and Methods. CHO cells were chosen as a source of recombinant protein because they could be manipulated to yield lines secreting quantities of rHuMig far in excess of what could be obtained from a natural source (see below) and because conditioned medium could be harvested from CHO cells cultured without added protein, thereby simplifying rHuMig purification. In addition, CHO cells as compared with bacteria or cells of lower eukaryotes, could be expected to process HuMig similarly to human cells. Transfection of CHO cells with pMSXND containing HuMig cDNA sequences in the sense orientation with respect to the mouse metaUothionein I promoter yielded the CHO/H9 cell line. The CHO/I<5 cell line was derived from cells transfected with pMSXND containing HuMig cDNA sequences in the antisense orientation. The CHO/ R5 cell line served as a source of control conditioned medium lacking rHuMig. As described in Materials and Methods, rabbit antisera JH49 and JH50 were raised against HuMig protein sequences expressed in E. coli and rabbit antiserum 5092 was raised against rHuMig high-kD species purified from the CHO/H9 cell line (see below). As shown in Fig. 1 , the cell line CHO/H9 secreted a collection ofanti-HuMig-reactive polypeptides. As expected, no rHuMig protein was produced by the parent, nontransfected CHO cells, or by the methotrexate-resistant CHO/ R.5 ceils that had been transfected with pMSXND containing HuMig cDNA sequences in the antisense orientation. Figure 1 . Production of rHuMig protein by transfected CliO cells. Culture supematant was prepared from the parent CHO cell hne, from the pool of G418-resistant CHO cells after transfection with the pMSXND/HuMig plasmid, and from the methotrexate-resistant cell hnes CHO/H9 and CHO/K5, the former derived from cells transfected with the pMSXND plasmid containing the HuMig cDNA in the sense orientation and the latter with the HuMig cDNA in the antisense orientation. 24-h supematants were collected from flasks containing confluent CHO cells and 50 ~1 of the conditioned medium (containing ,'ol.5 ~g total protein) was loaded per lane and analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-HuMig serum JH50. The positions of prestained protein molecular weight standards (GIBCO/BRL Life Technologies) are shown. The initial pool o f transfected, G418-resistant C H O cells, while expressing detectable levels o f HuMig-hybridizing P, N A (not shown) did not secrete sufficient amounts of protein for detection by Western blot. For estimating relative molecular masses the C H O / H 9 supematant was analyzed by Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE using a 15% gel (not shown) that revealed predicted molecular masses for the rHuMig species o f '~8 -3 6 kD. While the rHuMig species running at the 14.3-kD marker and below had predicted molecular masses in the 11,725-M~ range as predicted for the secreted protein on the basis o f the HuMig c D N A sequence, it was puzzling that the C H O cells produced a reduced and denatured rHuMig species running as a discrete band between the 29and 43-kD markers (Fig. 1) . Moreover, production o f this species was not unique to the C H O / H 9 cell line but was found in supernatants from 12 other transfected, methotrexate-resistant, rHuMig-secreting C H O cell lines (data not shown). Northern blot analysis of the HuMig P, N A species produced by the C H O / H 9 cells revealed evidence for alternative splicing (data not shown). Northern blot analysis using oligonucleotide probes and P C R analysis of c D N A did not suggest the presence in the C H O / H 9 cells of any HuMig R N A species where the HuMig stop codon had been deleted (data not shown). Nonetheless, we considered whether there might be a minor P, N A species where splicing had in fact deleted the HuMig stop codon and fused Mig sequences with those of the SV40 large T antigen from the p M S X N D vector. W e investigated this possibility by probing a Western blot o f supernatants of the rHuMig-producing C H O cells with mAb KT3, whose epitope is in the carboxy-terminal residues of the SV40 large T antigen (31) , and found that, in fact, the low mobility species that was immunoreactive with anti-HuMig antibodies was likewise recognized by antibody KT3, while none o f the 8-14.3-kD rHuMig species reacted with KT3 and no KT3-reactive species were present in supernatants from control C H O cells (data not shown). This H u M i g / large T antigen fusion protein was not investigated further.
