Initial screening of retrieved articles excluded articles which were: review articles, and those which did not include specific rates or cases of asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection. A total of 10 papers were retrieved and included in the final analysis and review ( Fig. 1 , Table 1 ) [6, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . We included studies in humans describing the incidence of asymptomatic MERS [6, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] and two additional studies in animals [42, 43] .
