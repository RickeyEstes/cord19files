The ABO blood group in 3,694 normal people in Wuhan displayed a percentage distribution of 32.16%, 24.90%, 9.10% and 33.84% for A, B, AB and O, respectively, while the 1,775 patients with COVID-19 from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital showed an ABO distribution of 37.75%, 26.42%, 10.03% and 25.80% for A, B, AB and O, respectively. The proportion of blood group A in patients with COVID-19 was significantly higher than that in normal people, being 37.75% in the former vs 32.16% in the later (P < 0.001).

These results corresponded to a significantly increased risk of blood group A for COVID-19 with an OR of 1.279 (95% CI Table 1 ). To the contrary, blood group A was associated with a higher risk of death compared with non-A groups, with an OR of 1.482 (95% CI 1.113~1.972, P = 0.008, Table 1 ). We next examined 113 patients with COVID-19 from another hospital in Wuhan City, the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, and found a similar risk distribution trend of ABO blood groups for the infection. Specifically, compared with non-O groups, blood group O were significantly associated with a lower risk of infection, with an OR of 0.644 (95% CI 0.418~0.993, P = 0.045, Table 1 ). Compared with non-A blood groups, blood group A displayed higher relative risk (OR=1.396; 95% CI 0.952~2.048) than those observed in patients from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, although the associations did not reach statistical significance likely due to the small All rights reserved.

We found no significant difference in patient age among different ABO groups (F = 0.135ï¼›P = 0.939). Figure 1 shows the estimates of ORs of the risk of ABO blood groups for COVID-19 on the pooled data from the three hospitals by random effects models. Again, the results showed that blood group A was associated with a significantly higher risk for COVID-19 (OR, 1.21; 95% CI 1.02~1.43, P = 0.027) compared with non-A blood groups, whereas blood group O was associated with a significantly lower risk for the infection (OR, 0.67; 95% CI 0.60~0.75, P < 0.001) compared with non-O blood groups. Compared with other ABO blood groups, AB blood group (OR, 1.48, 95% CI 0.97~2.24) and B blood group (OR, 1.09, 95% CI 0.98~1.22) seemed to have a higher risk of infection, although the associations did not reach statistical significance.

The distribution of ABO blood groups is known to have no sex and age predilections. For example, by analyzing the blood type of more than ninety thousands normal people, it was out that the percentage of A, B, AB and O blood types were essentially the same among different age groups and among different genders. 7 Thus we used the ABO blood group distribution of 3,694 normal people in Wuhan area as control to compare with different age groups and gender groups. When all patients from Jinyintan Hospital and Renmin Hospital in Wuhan city were combined together (1,888 patients together) and grouped into three age groups (less 40, 41-59, over 60 years old ages), the ABO blood group distribution did not change among the three age groups (Table S1 ). Similarly, the ABO blood group distribution did not have much change when men and woman of patient with COVID-19 were considered separately (Table S1 ).
