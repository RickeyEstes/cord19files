The RNA was extracted and cDNA was synthesized, and further a (392bp) segment of the S1 gene was amplified by nested RT-PCR (Fig. 1) . Samples from twelve farms (80%) found to be positive (Table 1) . On the base gene sequences, phylogenetic tree was constructed from the nucleotide sequences of the S1 glycoprotein gene, revealing that the sequences of the recent Iranian strains formed two main groups (Fig. 2) . The first group was subdivided into two subgroups: one including Kurdistan-Sulaymania/12, Egypt/Beni Suef/ 01, Turkey/10RS-3161/2010, IS/VAR2-06, variant_2, Eg/ CLEVB-2/IBV/012, IR/Bu/variant2/SH1229. 5
