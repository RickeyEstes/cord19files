During a period of 460 child-weeks, respiratory symptoms in were recorded in 18 children. There were 2 sibling pairs; all other children were unrelated. Other characteristics of the study group are presented in Table I . A total of 230 biweekly samples from both symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes were tested for the presence of respiratory pathogens; 119 samples (52%) were positive for at least 1 respiratory pathogen. Table II gives the results of the PCR testing of samples obtained during symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes. Significantly greater numbers of pathogens were found in symptomatic episodes compared with the asymptomatic episodes. A pathogen was detected in 56% of the symptomatic episodes, compared with 40% of the asymptomatic episodes (P ϭ .03). Rhinovirus was the most prevalent virus, found in 23% of the symptomatic episodes and in 22% of the asymptomatic episodes; this difference was not significant (P ϭ .88). The second most prevalent pathogens were the coronaviruses, which also were detected in comparable numbers in symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes (P ϭ .38). Human metapneumovirus and M pneumoniae were never detected as a monoinfection, but only as a coinfection with another pathogen (Table III; available at www.jpeds.com). We analyzed the influence of age on the occurrence of symptoms during an episode. For this reason, we selected the episodes in which at least 1 pathogen was detected and divided them into 3 age categories. Figure 1 shows the distribution of symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes in the different age categories. With increasing age, pathogen-positive children are increasingly asymptomatic. Only 9% of the pathogen-positive episodes were asymptomatic in children age 0 to 2 years, compared with 26% in those age 3 to 4 years and 36% in those age 5 to 7 years (P ϭ .04 and .01, respectively; 2 test). Multiple pathogens were seen in 17% of the symptomatic episodes, compared with 3% of the asymptomatic episodes (P ϭ .01). Figure 2 shows the distribution of symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes when no pathogen, a single pathogen, or multiple pathogens were detected. If no pathogen was found, then 35% of the episodes were asymptomatic, compared with 7% of the episodes with multiple pathogens (P Ͻ .01).
