We measured the relative fitness of 3D G64S by direct competition over serial passage by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) ( Fig 1A) . Here, the fitness of 3D G64S is 0.78 ± 0.01 (n = 3 replicates) relative to WT. This is a moderate fitness defect, falling in the 64th percentile in a dataset of 8,970 fitness values obtained for point mutants of poliovirus under similar conditions [16] (e.g., human epithelial cells [HeLa] multiplicity of infection [MOI] 0.1, 8-hour infection cycle, and 6 passages; Fig 1B) . We also measured the relative growth properties of WT and 3D G64S using a plaque-size assay, which measures the growth, burst size, and spread of individual viruses in the absence of competition [40] [41] [42] . The distribution of clonal plaque sizes was significantly different (p < 0.005; unpaired t test with Welch correction; n = 272 WT and n = 220 3D G64S plaques) and consistent with a moderate fitness defect in 3D G64S (Fig 1C) . In contrast with prior work, we were able to detect a significant replication defect for 3D G64S by one-step growth curve, but only with rigorous synchronization, more frequent time points, and larger numbers of replicates ( Fig 1D) . This replication defect was not specific to HeLa because we observed a similar lag for 3D G64S in a 3T3 cell line [16] . " Ã " indicates the relative fitness (0.78) and percentile (64th) of 3D G64S .

ÃÃÃ that we derived from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from PVR mice ( Fig 1E) . These data demonstrate that the fitness defect of 3D G64S is largely attributable to its slower replicative kinetics and is consistent with biochemical assays on purified RdRp [6, 39] . The reduced mutation rate and replicative fitness of 3D G64S suggest a trade-off between speed and fidelity in RNA virus replication. Here, the fitness gain from increased replicative speed is offset by a reduction in fitness due to increased mutational load. We derived a quantitative model of this trade-off (see S1 Text Model 1) by measuring the replicative fitness ( Fig  1F) and mutation rate (Fig 1G, S1 Table) of WT and 3D G64S under exposure to an exogenous mutagen, ribavirin [43] . WT and 3D G64S had equal fitness at approximately 150 μM ribavirin. Based on these data, our model indicates that WT incurs a fitness cost of 0.137 from mutational load alone. Therefore, any fitness benefit of the high baseline mutation rates in WT would presumably need to offset this cost. In 3D G64S , the cost of mutational load is reduced to 0.037. If viral RdRp are constrained by a speed-fidelity trade-off, selection for increased replicative speed (r-selection) will increase mutation rate. We subjected the 3D G64S-1nt point mutant (A6176G) to r-selection over serial passage by infecting cells at low multiplicity and harvesting progeny at 4.5 hours (midexponential phase of replication). The 3D G64S point mutant reverted to WT within 15 passages in 5 independent lineages (Fig 2A) . We only observed partial reversion at passage 15 in a subset of 24-hour control lineages, in which virus populations underwent twice as many cellular infection cycles per passage and experienced reduced r-selection. We next asked whether r-selection would lead to genetic compensation of the fidelity phenotype in 3D G64S-3nt , which has all 3 positions in the codon mutated to minimize reversion. After 50 passages of r-selection, we identified fixed and polymorphic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) by next-generation sequencing of all r-selected and control (24-hour passage) populations of 3D G64S and WT ( Fig 2B) . Unbiased hierarchical clustering of SNVs by type and frequency indicates that the viruses explored distinct mutational pathways in adapting to either r-selective or control passaging regimes. Within the r-selected group, WT and 3D G64S lineages clustered together, and we noted a larger number of SNVs within the coding region for the RdRp across the 5 3D G64S populations. We found that a number of distinct SNVs increased viral fitness when introduced into the ancestral WT backbone. For example, the WT-VP4 S22G had a fitness of 2.62, and its presence in all r-selected and control lineages suggests that it mediates adaptation to HeLa cells (see SI, S1 Data 2C). In contrast, a mutation in the viral helicase found only in r-selected populations-2C V127L (fitness 1.41-1.67 in WT and 1.11 ± 0.02 in 3D G64S , SI S1 Data 2C)would be more likely to have a general effect on replicative speed. To identify compensatory mutations, we focused our subsequent analysis on nonsynonymous mutations in the RdRp that were found predominantly in r-selected populations, shared among multiple lineages, and more frequent in 3D G64S than in WT. Two mutations-U6261C/3D I92T and A6813G/3D K276R -met these criteria, and their frequencies at passages 30 and 50 suggest that the I92T mutation may have arisen first. The 3D I92T mutation, which was found in both r-selected WT (3 out of 5) and 3D G64S (5 out of 5) lineages, did not change either fitness or mutation rate appreciably in the 3D G64S background (Fig 2C and 2D ). The r-selected K276R substitution, which was found in 3D G64S lineages (4 out of 5) and not in WT populations, decreased overall fitness in both WT (0.92 ± 0.03; p = 0.0031 versus WT; t test) and 3D G64S (0.55 ± 0.03; p = 0.005 versus 3D G64S ; t test). It had no detectable effect on mutation rate in either background. The G64S/I92T/K276R triple mutant had a significant increase in fitness (0.7637; p = 0.0012 versus 3D G64S ; t test) and mutation rate (8.71 × 10 −6 s/n/r; p = 0.0120 versus 3D G64S ; t test) compared to 3D G64S and each double mutant. Therefore, direct selection for replicative speed led to indirect selection of mutations that together (GGT gly to AGT ser ) was introduced into a poliovirus genome that is marked with a nearby point mutation that ablates an AccI restriction site. Viruses were serially passaged every 4.5 hours (r-selected) or every 24 hours (control) for 15 passages. Chromatograms show the codon for position 64 (either GGT gly or AGT ser ).

(B) WT and a "locked in" version of 3D G64S (GGT gly to UCA ser ) were subjected to rselection (3.5-4 hours and 4-4.5 hours, respectively) or control (24-hour) passages for 50 passages as described in the text.

RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; WT, wild-type. increase the poliovirus mutation rate, with sign epistasis among G64S, I92T, and K276R in the RdRp. To gain mechanistic insight into the interactions among these 3 mutations, we analyzed the kinetics of single-nucleotide incorporation and misincorporation by purified RdRp. The 3D G64S;I92T RdRp exhibits an assembly defect relative to 3D I92T when incubated with purified primer template and ATP (Fig 2E and [6] ). The K276R mutation partially compensates for this assembly defect in the 3D G64S;I92T background, resulting in a 1.5-to 2-fold increase in incorporation of the correct nucleotide (A opposite U). This interaction is dependent on G64S because K276R reduced RdRp activity in the 3D I92T background. While some poliovirus mutators exhibit altered kinetics of nucleotide misincorporation for G opposite U [30] , the kinetics of 3D G64S;I92T;K276R were similar to those of 3D G64S;I92T (S1 Fig) . We further examined the relationship between RdRp speed and fidelity using a second poliovirus antimutator. The 3D K359R RdRp has slower polymerization kinetics and higher fidelity relative to WT, and the 3D K359H RdRp has similar characteristics [44] . In 2 separate experiments, we infected HeLa cells with 3D K359H virus and recovered mutants after 1 or 2 passages. We observed 2 missense mutations in the 3D gene. Amino acid changes I331F and P356H were identified together in 1 experiment, and the P356H change was identified alone in the second. We introduced each of these amino acid substitutions alone or in combination into the 3D K359H RdRp. In all cases, we observed an increase in the elongation rate (kpol) of the viral polymerase (a surrogate for speed) as well as the nucleotide misincorporation rate (kobs misincorporation for mutant relative to WT) in vitro ( Table 1) . The adaptability of WT and high-fidelity viruses have generally been compared using assays that measure the acquisition of drug resistance, the reversion of an attenuating point mutation, or escape from microRNA in a limited number of replication cycles [5] [6] [7] 34, 36] . In these experiments, mutations come at little cost, and the assays essentially quantify the beneficial mutation rate. To capture better the impact of both deleterious and beneficial mutations on adaptability, we measured the fitness gain of WT and 3D G64S over 20 passages in HeLa. While our WT strain is "culture-adapted," we found that it was far from a fitness peak; both WT and 3D G64S increased their fitness 10-fold in approximately 40 cellular infection cycles (20 passages, Fig 3A, S2 Fig) . The difference in the rate of fitness gain between WT and 3D G64S lineages was small but statistically significant (0.025 per passage, WT > 3D G64S ; mixed linear effects model, p = 0.0129). We examined adaptation to a completely distinct environment by repeating the experiment on our PVR-3T3 cell line [45, 46] . In this alternative species and cell type, we actually observed greater fitness gain in the high-fidelity 3D G64S variant relative to WT (0.121 per passage; mixed Table 1 . Kinetic parameters for nucleotide incorporation and misincorporation for purified RdRp. The k pol for the correct nucleotide measures the speed of polymerization in vitro. The k pol,corr /k pol,incorr is an in vitro surrogate for fidelity, as it measures the relative rates of incorporation for the correct and incorrect nucleotides. A higher ratio indicates higher fidelity.
