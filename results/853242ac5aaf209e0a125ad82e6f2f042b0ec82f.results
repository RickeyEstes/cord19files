Altogether, 1264 residual nasal washes collected between December 2002 and September 2004 ( Fig. 1 ) from unique patients with clinical data were available for analysis. The majority of samples (88%) were collected within 1 day of admission. This study population had a median age of 14.3 months at the time of sampling; the oldest subject was 20 years and the youngest was 1 day (Table 1) . Slightly more than half of the population was male (57%). The majority of patients were admitted to the inpatient medical ward (73%), but 17% were seen in the emergency department only, 10% were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 0.5% were seen as outpatients in specialty clinics. Four hundred forty-five (35%) of the 1264 total children had a specimen with RSV detected by RT-PCR; 418 (94%) of those RSV samples had no viruses other than RSV detected by direct FA testing and did not have hMPV present by RT-PCR. Among the 418 samples used for this analysis, the mean RSV viral load was 5.3 × 10 8 copies/mL, with a median viral load of 4.5 × 10 7 (range, 850 to 2.1 × 10 10 copies/mL) (Fig. 2 ). Ninety-eight percent of the 393 children with RSV viral loads ≥10 5 had RSV detected by both FA as well as RT-PCR, whereas only 15 (60%) of the 25 children with RSV viral loads b10 5 copies/mL had RSV detected by FA testing (P b 0.001, χ 2 test). Only 110 (9%) of the 1264 children had a specimen with hMPV detected by RT-PCR. Of these samples with hMPV detected, 81 (74%) had no other viruses detected by FA and did not have RSV present as detected by FA or RT-PCR. Among these 81 samples, the mean hMPV viral load was 1.3 × 10 9 copies/mL, with a median viral load of 3.0 × 10 8 (range, 1.6 × 10 4 to 4.0 × 10 10 copies/mL) (Fig. 2) . Children with only hMPV (n = 81) or only RSV (n = 418) were similar in gender distribution (57% and 55% male, respectively), although children with RSV were significantly younger (P b 0.001) (median, 8.2 months; range, 0.3 months to 18 years) compared with children with hMPV (median, 14.9 months; range, 0.7 months to 20 years) ( Table 1) . No significant differences were observed between these 2 groups for admission unit (outpatient clinic, emergency department, inpatient, or intensive care unit) or proportion of children with a specimen collected within 1 day of admission. In a univariate linear regression model evaluating the relationship between age and log viral load, every 6-month increase in age was significantly associated with a 0.1 log decrease in RSV viral load (P = 0.027). By contrast, no association between age and hMPV viral load was observed. Of the 418 RSV-only infections, 370 (89%) episodes had admission ICD-9 diagnoses available; 83% of admission ICD-9 codes were for acute respiratory illnesses. An additional 9% of admissions were for asthma or asthma exacerbations, and 2% were for fever. Likewise, the 68 (84%) of 81 ICD-9 admission diagnoses available for children with hMPV-only infections showed that 74% of admission codes were for acute respiratory illnesses, with 10% for asthma or asthma exacerbations and 9% for fever. We characterized the burden of underlying chronic disease, including asthma, for all 1264 patients, as well as separately within the hMPV and RSV groups ( Table 1) . The presence of any underlying condition did not significantly differ between children with an RSV-only and those with an hMPV-only specimen (P = 0.609), after controlling for age and gender; however, condition-specific differences were identified. Eight (2%) children with only RSV detected had underlying chronic respiratory conditions compared with 8 (10%) children infected only with hMPV (P = 0.002). Neither hMPV nor RSV viral load differed between previously healthy children and the overall group of children with chronic conditions. However, children with malignancies and an RSV-only infection (n = 5) had a lower log viral load compared with other children with an RSVonly infection (median, 5.4 versus 7.7) that approached statistical significance (P = 0.055). Children with an underlying neurologic condition with an RSV-only infection (n = 12) had a significantly higher RSV log viral load than those without a neurologic condition (median, 8.3 versus 7.6; P = 0.021). Several markers of disease severity increased significantly with each log increase of hMPV viral load, controlling for age and presence of underlying chronic disease ( Table 2) . The presence of fever at or above 38.0°C, increased bronchodilator use, increased frequency of hospital stays greater than 2 days, and increased frequency of obtaining chest radiographs were related to hMPV viral load (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9, P = 0.002; OR = 1.6, P = 0.019; OR = 1.5, P = 0.025; and OR = 1.4, P = 0.05, respectively). When these estimates were reevaluated in the subgroup of children 12 months and younger, the magnitude of each odds ratio, except bronchodilator use, increased. In the RSV-only group, controlling for age and presence of underlying chronic conditions, the use of antibiotics, and the frequency of inpatient admission significantly decreased with each log increase in viral load (OR = 0.8, P = 0.001; OR = 0.8, P = 0.047) ( Table 2 ). An increase in RSV viral load of 1 log was associated with a decrease in respiratory rate of 1.3 breaths per minute, controlling for bronchodilator use, age, and presence of underlying chronic conditions (P = 0.008). In a secondary analysis, we evaluated differences in the clinical markers of disease severity discussed above for hMPV and RSV between children with a viral load less than 1.0 × 10 5 (n = 6 for hMPV, n = 25 for RSV) compared with children with a viral load of 1.0 × 10 5 or higher (n = 75 for hMPV, n = 393 for RSV). For children infected only with hMPV, increases in illness severity in the higher viral load group were observed for every variable evaluated, except antibiotic use and inpatient admission. However, these differences were not statistically significant when controlling for age and the presence of underlying chronic disease. This pattern was not observed among children infected only with RSV. Importantly, clinically significant illness was observed in children with fewer than 1 × 10 5 copies/mL with both hMPV and RSV infections. For example, 83% of the low-copy hMPV cases were admitted to the inpatient ward and 33% required supplemental oxygen compared with 80% (P = 0.993) and 49% (P = 0.423), respectively, in the highcopy group. Fifty-two percent of the low-copy RSV cases had a fever within 24 h of the sample collection, 68% required bronchodilators, and 44% required supplemental Table 2 Associations with viral load a , controlling for age, and chronic disease hMPV (n = 81) RSV (n = 418) OR, P (95% CI) OR, P (95% CI) Fever The presence of an underlying chronic condition was found to significantly modify the relationship between viral load and ventilator requirement. For this reason, the estimate is presented separately for the previously healthy and the underlying disease groups. c β indicates the linear regression coefficient. For example, a 1 log increase in hMPV viral load corresponds to an increase in respiratory rate of 0.2 breaths per minute. d Controlling for use of bronchodilators as well. Fig. 2 .
