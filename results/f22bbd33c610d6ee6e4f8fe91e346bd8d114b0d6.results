The summary statistics for our sample are presented in Table 1 , both for the full sample as well as for Liberia and Sierra Leone separately. Overall, approximately 41% of the respondents in the pooled sample knew a close friend or family member who had been infected with Ebola and only slightly lower percentage reported knowing a close friend who had died of Ebola (38%). A slightly higher percentage of people had been exposed to cases of Ebola in Liberia than in Sierra Leone. Almost exactly half of the respondents were male, which is not surprising given the sampling strategy of the Afrobarometer survey. The sample was well distributed in terms of ages, but was slightly older in Sierra Leone. About half of the sample had more than a primary education, but the Liberian sample was slightly more educated than in Sierra Leone. Households in both countries were large (mean 6.5-6.7 adults per household). Based on the full-sample pooled common asset score, we find that households in both countries were similar in terms of overall wealth, but that communities in Liberia fared better in terms of access to communitylevel resources than in Sierra Leone. In Table 2 , we present our regression results which explore the determinants of Ebola exposure along individual, household, and community lines. The dependent variable in all of the specifications is a binary variable reporting knowing at least one close friend or family member with Ebola and the models are all estimated using logistic regression. The first set of columns correspond to the results for the pooled sample, while the second and third sets of columns present the same analysis for Sierra Leone and Liberia separately. In columns 1,4, and 7, we regress knowing a close friend or family member with Ebola with individual and household-level factors alone. In columns 2, 5, and 8 we add community-level factors while in the last set columns in each set we also control for region-level fixed effects. In the full sample, we find that after controlling for all other variables, individual-level education as well as an indicator that the household lives in an urban area are both positively and significantly associated with knowing a close friend or family member with Ebola. When we use the same specification in the country-specific models, controlling for all other variables, we find that the individual-level educational effect is only significant in Sierra Leone and the urban effect is only significant in Liberia, although the patterns observed were consistent across countries, but were just not significant. We also find that the pooled sample masks important differences in the association between household wealth and exposure at the country-level. While there is no measurable effect in the pooled sample, after controlling for other variables, in Sierra Leone, higher wealth index quintile households were more likely to report knowing a close friend or family member with Ebola, while in Liberia we get the opposite finding with higher SES households less likely to report knowing someone with Ebola. Whether or not the respondent was male or the number of adults in the household had little impact on exposure in any sample. Overall age had little impact, with the exception of older respondents in Liberia being more likely to report knowing someone with Ebola. We then explore whether controlling for community and region-level factors influence these relationships by adding the average educational levels and socio-economic status measured at the community-levels. We find that community-level education is positively associated with Ebola exposure but that this effect appears to be mainly concentrated in Sierra Leone. When we control for community-level education we also reduce the associations with individual-level measures of education, but only slightly and it remains significant in Sierra Leone. Controlling for community-level SES does not systematically affect our associations between individual and household-level SES and exposure. Adding subnational regional fixed-effects also does not affect our observed effects, although we do observe some regions have higher or lower propensity to reporting knowing someone with Ebola (not shown, but available upon request). We also replicate all of the same regression results using knowing someone who died of Ebola, and the results are presented in Appendix Table 2 . Given the similarity in this measure with our other dependent variable, unsurprisingly, we find nearly the exact same pattern of associations as with knowing someone with Ebola. We also explore the determinants of Ebola exposure in a model that has been stratified by rural and urban populations in Appendix Table 4 . Despite the much smaller sample sizes, which makes it more difficult to find strong associations, we also see some differences in the sub-samples. For example, while there is no association between gender and exposure in the full sample, we see that males were more likely to be exposed in the rural sample but not in the urban sample.
