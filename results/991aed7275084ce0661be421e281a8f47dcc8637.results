Manifestation of the highest nonisostericity between the parallel G * GC & T * AT triplets Superposition of the parallel GÃGC & TÃAT base triplets reveals (Fig 1A) misalignment of the C1' atoms of the Hoogsteen strand (see also S1A Fig). This results in the largest value for the residual twist angle Δt°(± 21.6°) between the G. . .G and A. . .T Hoogsteen pairs. It is obvious that the effect of residual twist would be to impart over winding (+Δt°) at the G H T H step (GÃGC preceding TÃAT) ( Fig 1C) and under winding (-Δt°) at the T H G H step (TÃAT preceding GÃGC) in the Hoogsteen strand of the triplex (Fig 1D) . Consequently effective triple helical twist would be 30°(t°) + 21.6°(+Δt°) = 51.6°and 30°(t°)−21.6°(-Δt°) = 8.4°at the GT and TG steps of the Hoogsteen strand respectively. 51.6°is close to nearly twice the value of triple helical twist of 30°(t°), while 8.4°is an exceptionally low value for triple helical twist. Outcome of these creates disconnects of nearly one nucleotide length (5.5 Å to 6.3 Å) in the sugar-phosphate backbone at the successive steps of the Hoogsteen strand (S1B Fig). They also generate severe steric overlap between the adjacent sugars, especially, at the under wound TG step. Bridging these disconnects and ensuring a steric free conformation, while retaining Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds in the GÃGC & TÃAT triplets, demand considerable conformational rearrangements (see below). Incidentally, the other nonisostericity parameter viz., radial difference (Δr Å) is relatively small (ffi 0.4 Å) for the parallel (Fig 1A) compared to the antiparallel base triplets (ffi 1.1 Å) ( Fig 1B) . Given this, it is expected that Δt°would impact more than Δr Å in a parallel DNA triplex. Successive incidence of G * GC & T * AT triplets destabilizes parallel DNA triplex by disrupting Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds It might be anticipated that the conformational changes necessitated by the unusually high and low twist angles at the alternating G H T H and T H G H steps might be absorbed by the inherent flexibility of the triplex. In order to examine this, MD simulations (250 ns) have been carried out on a 15-mer parallel triplex comprising alternating GÃGC & TÃAT triplets (Sequence 1 in Table 1 ). The results at once indicate a proclivity for the loss of Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds in both the triplets (Fig 2A) : N6 (A W ) . . . O4 (T H ) and N7 (A W ) . . .N3 (T H ) hydrogen bonds in the TÃAT triplets are absent for over 52% and 49% of the simulation period respectively, while N7 (G W ) . . .N2 (G H ) and O6 (G W ). . . N1 (G H ) hydrogen bonds are absent in the GÃGC triplets for over 64% and 47.7% respectively. This is caused by the movement of T H and G H to overcome the effects of high Δt°. In the process, Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds are disrupted. In striking contrast, the reverse Hoogsteen bonds of the GÃGC & TÃAT triplets in the antiparallel DNA triplex (Sequence 2) are largely preserved ( Fig 2B) . This can be attributed to the much lower value of Δt°(10°) in antiparallel, as opposed to 21.6°in the parallel triplex. Evidently much smaller conformational variations required by the lower residual twists are readily absorbed by the inherent triplex flexibility without the need for the loss of reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds. Pronounced Nonisostericity between G*GC and T*AT Triplets Destabilizes Parallel DNA Triplex Emergence of noncanonical Hoogsteen schemes. Consequent to the disruption of Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds, alternative schemes of hydrogen bonds emerge for both the TÃAT (NC1 to NC4; Fig 3D-3G ) and GÃGC (NC5 to NC8; Fig 3H-3K ) triplets. These are referred to as noncanonical Hoogsteen schemes. For TÃAT, NC1 scheme ( Fig 3D) is predominant and is formed by way of water mediated interaction involving N3 of T H and N6 & N7 of A W . In NC2 (Fig 3E) , both ion and water interact with T H (O4 & N3) and N6 & N7 of A W and O4 of T H . Interaction via two water molecules describes NC3 ( Fig 3F) . In all of these none of the canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds are retained. But in NC4 (Fig 3G) , canonical N6. . .O4 Hoogsteen hydrogen bond scheme is preserved while a water molecule mediates the interaction between N3 of T H and N7 of A W . In the case of GÃGC triplet, NC5 scheme ( Fig 3H) is predominant. This is characterised by bifurcated hydrogen bonds involving N2 of G H and O6 & N7 of G W . In the NC6 scheme ( Fig  3I) , a water molecule mediates interaction between G H and WC paired bases. In both these situations, Hoogsteen G H swivels causing the amino group to glide towards the WH groove. But, similar action in the direction of the CH groove results in the NC7 scheme ( Fig 3J) . Here, an ion comes in between O6's of G H and G W , while N7 of G W forms bifurcated hydrogen bonds with N2 & N1 of G H . NC8 scheme is alike NC5, but in addition, is mediated by a water molecule between N7 & N3 atoms of G W and G H (Fig 3K) . A common feature observed in all of the above is the propensity for reducing the initial large Δt°(21.6°) to lower values (as low as 1.2°in NC3; Fig 3G) to circumvent the large mechanistic effects (steric overlap and disconnect in the sugar-phosphate backbone) discussed above. This can happen only at the expense of losing canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding. Such a loss in a large number of triplets would critically affect triplex stability. This is clearly reflected in the very low binding free energy of only-9.4 kcal/mol for the parallel triplex (Sequence 1) in sharp contrast to the comparatively high value of-70.80 kcal/mol for the antiparallel triplex (Sequence 2). The latter by and large retains all the reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds in all the triplets. Thus, the parallel DNA triplex with consecutive GÃGC and TÃAT triplets is not expected to be stable due to the mechanistic effects of extreme nonisostericity at every base step of the Hoogsteen strand. Hence the discussion about this unstable structure is not pursued further.
