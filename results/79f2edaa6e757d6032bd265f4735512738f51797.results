Two cats (Ab2 and Ab4) were euthanized at 15 and 18 day of post FIPV infection (dpi) with FIPV-I KU-2, respectively, when they reached the humane endpoint. These animals showed febrile (>39.5°C), lethargy, anorexia, and jaundice. Upon necropsy, ascites was noted in two cats with FIP and pyogranulomatous lesions were present in the intestine and spleen. Pleural effusion and inflammatory lesions in the lung were noted in Ab2. In passively immunized cats without clinical symptoms after FIPV infection, several 1-2-mm nodules were observed in the intestine, but there was no other lesion. Cats inoculated orally with FIPV-I KU-2 without passive immunization did not develop clinical symptoms. No FIP-related lesion was noted on necropsy at 90 dpi with FIPV-I KU-2. Figure 1B shows the survival rate of cats infected with FIPV-I KU-2. The survival rate of cats with passive immunization was lower than that of the cats without passive immunization, and the average survival time after infection with FIPV-I KU-2 was also shorter. We tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies against FIPV-I KU-2 in cats with passive immunization. In cats with passive immunization, NT was increased to 4-32 fold on the day of virus inoculation (day 3 post passive immunization) ( Fig. 2A) . NT was maintained at a constant level in cats excluding 2 cats (Ab2 and Ab4) which developed FIP after viral challenge. In cats without passive immunization, NT started to increase on 12 dpi with FIPV-I KU-2, and reached 64-128 fold on 36 dpi (Fig. 2B) . Time-course changes in the serum anti-FIPV antibody level were investigated by ELISA using purified soluble FIPV antigen. In cats passive immunization, the ELISA OD value was increased to 0.2-0.8 on the day of virus inoculation (day 3 post passive immunization). As with the NT titer, the ELISA OD value was continuously increased in 2 cats excluding 2 cats developed FIP (Ab2 and Ab4; Fig. 2C ). In cats without passive immunization, the ELISA OD value continuously increased 12-18 dpi after inoculation with FIPV-I KU-2, and reached 1.2-1.7 on 24-30 dpi (Fig. 2D ). Rectal swab samples from cats were subjected to RT-PCR targeting FCoV N gene. In cats with passive immunization, FCoV N gene was detected day 15 after virus inoculation in Ab3. However, FCoV N gene was not detected in any samples of the other cats (Table 1) . Based on the findings described above, FIPV-I KU-2 was suggested to promote ADE through not only subcutaneous but also oral infection. However, the mechanism of ADE induced by FIPV-I KU-2 infection is unclear. To elucidate this mechanism, it is necessary to promote FIPV-I KU-2-induced ADE in vitro. Therefore, the ADE infection with FIPV-I KU-2 was performed in feline macrophage. No FCoV N protein was detected in macrophages treated with only IgG purified from ascites of FIPV-I KU-2-infected cats (Fig. 3A) . In macrophages treated with only FIPV-I KU-2, FCoV N protein was detected in 3.9 ± 2.5% (Mean ± S.D.) of cells (Fig. 3B) . In macrophages treated with both purified IgG and FIPV-I KU-2, FCoV N protein was detected in 35.9 ± 8.1% (Mean ± S.D.) of cells (Fig. 3C) , showing that the FIPV-I KU-2 infection rate in macrophages increased in the presence of the antibody.
