Discovery of the pan-viral signature. An initial search was conducted across 13 Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets (Table 1 ) from human adult and pediatric subjects, and one GEO dataset from macaques. These 14 discovery datasets (comprising 417 cases and 182 controls) spanned three Baltimore Group I viruses (cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus 6, enterovirus), one Group III virus (rotavirus), two Group IV viruses (Dengue, hepatitis C), and six Group V viruses (influenza, Lassa virus, rhinovirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and measles virus). Next, a comprehensive, stepwise filtering approach was applied to 19 additional GEO datasets comprising a total of 1337 cases and 1106 controls (Table 1) , to exclude genes that were differentially expressed in conditions that may present as SI but appear unrelated to viral systemic inflammation. The end result, after the filtering step was applied, was a "pan-viral" signature based on the expression levels of four genes: Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15), Interleukin 16 (IL16), 2′,5′-Oligoadenylate Synthetase Like (OASL), and Adhesion G Protein Coupled Receptor E5 (ADGRE5). Table 2 summarizes what is known about the role, function and tissue expression of these four genes. Three of the genes (ISG15, OASL, IL16) have previously been reported to be associated with host response to viral infection, although they are not entirely specific to such a response. The four genes are all strongly expressed in whole blood and white blood cells, and to a lesser degree in most other tissues.
