During the study period from 2014 to 2017, there was a total of 2435 suspected MERS-CoV cases. Of these, 1823 cases (75%) tested negative and the remaining 25% tested positive for MERS-CoV by PCR. The application of the visual triage score resulted in a similar percentage of MERS-CoV and non-MERS-CoV patients with each score from 0 to 11 (Fig. 2) . The percentage of patients with a cutoff score of 4 was 75% in patients with MERS and 85% in patients without MERS (p 0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity of this cutoff score for MERS-CoV infection were 74.1% and 18.6%, respectively. Increasing the values of items 7 to 9 and recalculating the score, as indicated above, was not discriminative as well.
