From a total number of 170 flocks tested, 84.71% found to be positive. The phylogenetic analysis revealed detected IBVs were divided into five major clusters (Fig. 2) . The distribution of prevalence rates in each province is depicted in Table 1 . IS-1494-like IBV was the most common type accounted for 85% of detected strains. The other types overall created a lower proportion; including 793/B having a prevalence of 7%, QX, and Mass with prevalence rates of 5% and 2%, respectively, and D274 with the incidence of 1% (Fig. 3) The sequence identity among IS/1494/06 IBV types detected in this
