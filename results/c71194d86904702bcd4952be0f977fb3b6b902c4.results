Expression of IFN-g using an MHV DI RNA vector cell metabolism prior to infection or it may be that interferon acts at an early stage of viral replication. The murine IFN-g gene was cloned into the MHV DI To distinguish these possibilities, the culture medium RNA vector (Liao et al., 1995) under the control of the harvested from JHM-infected and DE-IFN-g-transfected MHV IG7 sequence. The resulting RNA, DE-IFN-g RNA, cells late in infection was used to infect DBT cells. This was transfected into MHV-infected cells, and the producmedium contained not only JHM virus but also IFN-g tion of IFN-g in the culture medium was detected by (180 U/ml) (Fig. 1) . Therefore, IFN-g was present through-ELISA. As shown in Fig. 1B , when MHV-JHM was used out the infection, beginning with the initiation of viral as helper virus, IFN-g was secreted into the medium (20 infection. No significant differences in virus titer released U/ml) as early as 6 hr posttransfection and increased from the DE-IFN-g-and DE-CAT-infected cells were dewith time. At 24 hr posttransfection, when cell monotected (both yielded approximately 10 6 PFU/ml) (data not layers were completely lysed, the amount of IFN-g shown). Thus, IFN-g has little antiviral effect even when reached approximately 180 U/ml. When A59 was used present at the initiation of viral infection. as helper virus, the production of IFN-g was detected at In view of the known mechanisms of action of IFN-a 80 U/ml at 6 hr posttransfection and reached a maximum and -b, whose antiviral activities require preadsorption (approximately 180 U/ml) earlier (at 12 hr posttransfecto cells prior to viral infection (Bianzani and Autonelli, tion) (Fig. 1C) , consistent with the observation that A59 1989), we examined the effects of pretreatment of cells replicates faster than JHM. These results indicated that with IFN-g prior to infection. For this study, the culture MHV DI vector can be used for the production of a semedium from JHM-infected and DE-IFN-g-transfected creted cytokine during MHV infection in vitro. cells was UV-irradiated to inactivate infectious virus and then used as a source of IFN-g to pretreat DBT cells.
