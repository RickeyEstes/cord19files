During the study, a total of 91 pediatric patients were hospitalized based on upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections. Of these 9 (9.9%) patients tested positive for hMPV antigens, as demonstrated by DFA from the nasopharyngeal secretions [ Figure 1 ]. Table 1 provides the demographic and clinical presentation data of all hMPV-positive patients. The age of these patients ranged from 9 months to 16 years and all were Saudi nationals except one infant, who was a Jordanian by nationality but was born and raised in Saudi Arabia. From the patient's demographics, it was observed that hMPV antigens were detected not only in patients from Abha but also among those from its bordering areas, namely, Algahama, Bilahmar, Ahud Rufida, Sarat Abeedah, Khamis Mushait and Bilasmer. Three of the nine positive cases were found from Abha (33.3%), and one positive case from each of the previously mentioned six cities was reported (11.1%). Of the nine hMPV-positive patients, seven (77.8%) were hospitalized during the autumn and winter of 2016-2017. In the hMPV-positive patients, the symptoms included fever (77.8%), cough (77.8), shortness of breath (66.7%), nasal congestion (11.1%), cyanosis (11.1%) and stridor (11.1%). These patients also had underlying chronic illnesses such as chronic heart disease (22.2%) and bronchial asthma (11.1%), and most had tachypnea (88.8%). On physical examinations, bilateral crepitation and wheezing were found to be the major findings along with bronchopneumonia (55.5%) and aspiration pneumonia (22.2%).
