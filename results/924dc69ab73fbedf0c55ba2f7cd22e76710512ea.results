On admission, most patients had bronchiolitis of moderate severity, with a median RDAI score of six, but no significant difference in the severity score was observed between age groups (0-6 months, 6-12 months, and .12 months). An oxygen saturation lower than 95% was observed in 21 patients (28.3%). Treatment included nebulized beta-agonists in 83% and systemic steroids in 46% of the patients; 32 patents (41.5%) required hospital admission, and 8 were admitted to the ICU. Only two patients required non-invasive ventilation, and there were no deaths. The overall mean length of stay in the hospital was 3.9 days, but a significantly increased length of stay was observed among patients admitted to the ICU (6.4 days, p = 0.012, Kruskal Wallis test). At least one viral agent was identified in 72 samples (93.5%); RSV was the most frequently detected agent, followed by rhinovirus, enterovirus, and human metapneumovirus (Table 2) . Single agents (mostly RSV) were identified in 38 samples, whereas coinfections were observed in 34 cases (44%) and primarily involved rhinovirus and enterovirus. Up to four different agents were identified in some samples ( Table 2 and Figure 1) . After adjusting the multivariate model, the main variables associated with hospital admission were age, atopy in a first-degree relative, and the identification of enterovirus ( Table 3 ). Identification of RSV showed a significant association in the univariate analysis, but this effect was not detected after including other variables in the model. Age had an odds ratio of 0.838, meaning that an older age led to a decrease in hospital admissions; atopy in the family showed a similar protective effect. Identification of enterovirus in the samples was associated with an increased hospital admission rate (Table 3) . Gender, lack of siblings, prematurity, day care attendance, having relatives with asthma, tobacco exposure, and the identification of any other viruses were also investigated for possible associations with hospital admission rates. With regard to admission to the ICU, we investigated the same variables described above and found prematurity to be a significant risk factor, with an odds ratio of 24.512 (95% CI: [3.214 -186.925], p = 0.002). An assessment of the impact of coinfections on hospital admissions for each viral agent was feasible only for RSV due to the high number of single infections; we did not find an association between coinfections and hospital or ICU admissions. When considering all viral infections, we found that coinfections did not result in an increase in hospital admissions.
