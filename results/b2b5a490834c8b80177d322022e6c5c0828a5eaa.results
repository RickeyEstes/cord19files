Pictograms of selected BLAST results are shown in Figure 1 . The initial sweep of unfiltered BLASTs returned 125-304 hits, but this number was markedly increased when using the filter "schizophrenia" (14,088 Hits for HSV-2). For unfiltered sweeps, the viral homologues are longer, while the filtered sweeps return shorter contiguous sequences nevertheless including multiple matches of pentapeptides or more. Viral-human matches are characterised by short contiguous amino acid matches of 5 or more amino acids, that are identical in viral and human proteins, defined as vatches (viral matches). These are exemplified, for DISC1 in Figure 2 . Hexapeptide matches have also been described for the influenza H5N1 virus and this study also highlighted homologies with DISC1, reelin and neurexin, inter alia [35] . The entire length of a human protein can be composed of Figure 4 : The antigenicity (B-cell epitope prediction) of DISC1: the amino acid sequences with an index of >0.35 are considered as epitopes. A value of 0.8 was chosen to define highly antigenic regions as seen in Figure 2 . The amino acid sequences of these highly antigenic regions are shown. many overlapping, intercalated vatches, related to multiple viral species. However, the viral spectrum is distinct for each protein as shown in Figure 3 for DISC1, neuregulin, the D2 dopamine receptor and transcription factor 4. Each is homologous to proteins from a large spectrum of viruses, but this spectrum is distinct for each protein. Interestingly, all are homologous to proteins from the hepatitis C virus. Several studies have noted that Hepatitis C infection is associated with schizophrenia, but this has generally been interpreted in terms of a schizophrenia life style that favours infection, rather than viewing Hepatitis C as a risk-promoting factor [36] [37] [38] [39] . These data may challenge this assumption. All of the pathogens implicated in schizophrenia express proteins with homology to multiple schizophrenia susceptibility gene products ( Table 3 ). The profile of each individual pathogen is again specific for different types of gene product, but all target key members of the schizophrenia network including dopamine, serotonin and glutamate receptors as well as neuregulin and growth-related or DISC1 related pathways. This is the case even when no filter is used. Interestingly, both the rubella and the influenza viruses target members of the translation initiation complex, which has been implicated in myelination and oligodendrocyte survival [4, 40] . Oligodendrocyte cell loss and myelination defects are prominent in the schizophrenic brain [41] [42] [43] [44] . The degree of overlap between the rubella, HERV and influenza viruses and schizophrenia gene products is shown by the Venn diagrams in Figure 3 . All but one schizophrenia gene product was covered by various permutations and similar data were recovered for other pathogens. All schizophrenia gene products (N = 632) were homologous to proteins expressed by one or more of these pathogens. However, only 16 proteins were common to all 8 pathogens ( Figure 3 ). These included neuregulin (NRG1) and DISC1, dopamine (DRD5), glutamate (GRIA4, GRID1, GRM3, GRM7) GABA (GABBR1) and serotonin (HTR7) receptors, a presynaptic protein regulating glutamate release (synapsin SYN3) and HOMER2, a member of the postsynaptic scaffold, all of which are key elements relating to the pathology of schizophrenia. Other proteins within this class included neurocan (CSPG5), a chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan expressed in oligodendrocytes that inhibits neurite outgrowth and regulates axonal growth [45] [46] [47] . It is also involved thalamocortical projection development [48] . ARHGEF10 is a rho Guanine-nucleotide exchange factor that controls myelination [49] . NDUFV2 is a subunit of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and its protein expression levels are reduced in the frontal cortex and striatum in schizophrenia [50] . PPP3CC Calcineurin gamma (PPP3CC) plays a role in dopamine receptor signalling [51, 52] . Calcineurin knockout mice show defects in prepulse inhibition and other phenotypes related to schizophrenia [53] . Calcineurin is highly expressed in the immune system and regulates the expression of numerous cytokines [54] . MAP6 is a microtubule protein that controls synaptic organisation, in particular of glutamatergic synapses where it controls the expression of the glutamate transporter and presynaptic genes, synaptophysin and GAP-43, spinophilin and MAP2. [55, 56] KCNH2 is a potassium channel that plays a role in the development of neural crest cells [57] and in lymphocyte proliferation [58] . PRSS16 is a serine protease involved in autoimmunity and the presentation of self-antigens within the thymus [59] . So, by a random bioinformatics process, trawling the entire human proteome, asking simply which proteins are homologous to those of the pathogens implicated in schizophrenia, we arrive at a small set of proteins related to synaptic and dendritic function, myelination, neuregulin and DISC1 pathways, glutamate, dopamine, GABA and serotonin transmission, and immune regulation that are the cornerstones of schizophrenia pathology [3, [60] [61] [62] .
