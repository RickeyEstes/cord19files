During the study period, 76 patients were enrolled. Their demographic and clinical data are detailed in Table 1 . The male-to-female ratio was 34:42. Their age was 24-87 years (median 46.5 years). Twenty-four patients had various underlying diseases, including cardiovascular disorders in 13 patients, diabetes mellitus in 10, hepatobiliary disorders in 6, history of cerebrovascular accidents in 3, chronic renal diseases in 2, pulmonary fibrosis in 1, history of intravenous drug abuse in 1, and adrenal insufficiency in 1. Fourteen of these 24 patients had underlying diseases classified as rapidly fatal (diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, plus congestive heart failure in four patients; diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, plus cerebrovascular accident with being bedridden in three; diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, plus end-stage renal disease in two; diabetes mellitus plus decompensated liver cirrhosis in one; and ischemic heart disease plus massive ischemic bowel in one) or ultimately fatal (severe pulmonary fibrosis in one, ischemic heart disease in two). Most frequent initial symptoms were fever, cough, myalgia, dyspnea, diarrhea, and rigor. Three of the 24 patients who had diarrhea had previously received various antimicrobial agents. The duration from symptom onset to a patient's visiting NTUH was 1-12 days (median 3 days). The initial laboratory data are detailed in Table 2 . Abnormalities on chest radiography suggesting pneumonia were found in 56 of the 76 patients. Lesions were found in one lobe in 33 patients, two lobes in 15 patients, three lobes in 4 patients, four lobes in 2 patients, and five lobes in 2 patients. Abnormalities visible on chest radiography developed in the other 20 patients after admission. The duration from disease onset to the time when abnormalities on the chest radiography were first noted was 1-12 days (median 4 days). During hospitalization, 69 patients (90.8%) had respiratory distress and needed oxygen supplements. The duration from disease onset to severe respiratory distress was a mean of 9.8 ± 3.0 days (standard deviation [SD]). Endotracheal intubation with ventilator support was indicated for 26 patients, but 3 patients refused intubation. Among the 23 intubated patients, the duration from disease onset to intubation was 8.4 ± 3.3 (SD) days. Eight of these 23 patients were successfully extubated 12.1 ± 6.1 (SD) days later. Twelve of the 23 patients died, and 3 patients remained intubated at the end of the study because of marked lung fibrosis. Thirty-one patients (40.8%) experienced exacerbation of diarrhea after admission. All had received various antimicrobial agents since hospitalization. The duration from disease onset to severe diarrhea was 8.9 ± 4.7 (SD) days. During the disease course, leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia were found in 40, 72, and 61 patients, respectively. Elevation of AST and ALT was noted in 66 and 59 patients, respectively. Elevation of serum LDH, CK, and CRP levels was found in 73, 34, and 71 patients, respectively. The laboratory values of the various parameters listed above typically peaked in severity in the second week of illness ( Table 3 ). The Figure demonstrates the relationships between the time points when several clinical and laboratory parameters became most severe. New lesions visible on chest radiography developed in 64 patients during hospitalization, including new lesions limited to one lung lobe in 21 patients, two lobes in 13, three lobes in 16, four lobes in 7, and five lobes in 7. The duration from disease onset to the most severe chest radiography findings was 9.6 ± 2.9 (SD) days. Sputum Gram stain and acid-fast stain, sputum culture for bacteria, sputum chlamydial antigen, throat swab for virus isolation, and urine legionella and pneumococcal antigen tests were available for all 76 patients; all results were negative. Paired serum specimens were available for 41 patients. Tests for antibody reaction to Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coxsackievirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were negative. Of these 41 patients, immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody to SARS-CoV was detected by immunofluorescent assay in 38 patients (92.7%). Twenty-six (34.2%) of the total 76 patients had positive results on throat swab RT-PCR for SARS-CoV. Among the 50 patients whose throat swab results were negative for SARS-CoV by RT-PCR, 28 seroconverted to SARS-CoV. The other 22 patients, who had no direct microbiology or serologic evidence for SARS-CoV infection at the time the study ended, had clinical courses compatible with those of probable SARS and clear relationships as well as exposures to the initial immigrant clusters and the later intrahospital outbreaks in Taiwan (11) . Their diagnoses of SARS had also been confirmed by a committee of the Center for Disease Control (Taiwan). The first patient did not receive any treatment specific for SARS. Five patients did not receive ribavirin treatment because its use was contraindicated for them because of conditions such as cardiac arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy. Seven patients did not receive steroids because their cases were rapidly fatal after diagnosis. These seven patients died mainly because of their underlying diseases, especially cardiac events. Their SARS cases did not progress to the point that steroids were indicated according to our treatment protocol. Eight patients received pulse steroid therapy for progressive clinical conditions, with the usual dosage of steroids. Forty patients received IVIG infusion for severe cytopenia (thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, or both) (22 patients in total) or marked local progression of pulmonary lesions on chest radiography in the first week of disease (18 patients). Those 22 patients who received IVIG for severe cytopenia did not receive steroids while on IVIG; their leukocyte counts were 2.6 ± 1.2 x 10 9 /L and 4.3 ± 2.8 x 10 9 /L, before and after the use of IVIG, respectively (p = 0.014, by paired t test). Their platelet counts were 104 ± 35 x 10 9 /L and 141 ± 46 x 10 9 /L, before and after IVIG, respectively (p = 0.002, by paired t test). Various complications developed in 18 patients during hospitalizations, including rhabdomyolysis, peripheral neuropathy, acute renal failure, and fungal or bacterial superinfection (Table 4 ). Among the 18 nosocomial infections, 6 were bloodstream infections; 3 of these were caused by enterococci, 2 by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 1 by methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Eleven episodes were lower respiratory infections, diagnosed by the existence of new infiltration on chest radiography, purulent sputum, phagocytosis of bacteria by neutrophils in sputum (indicated by sputum Gram stain), positive sputum culture for bacteria, and response to effective antimicrobial agents. The last episode was a catheter-related infection caused by Candida parapsilosis. The overall death rate was 19.7% (15/76). Among the 14 patients whose underlying diseases were classified as ultimately fatal or rapidly fatal, the rate of death was 78.6% (11/14) . For the other 62 patients with mild underlying diseases or without underlying disease, the death rate was 6.5% (4/62). The time from disease onset to death in these 15 patients was 4-42 days (median 12 days). For the 26 patients whose clinical conditions indicated endotracheal intubation with ventilator support, the rate of death was 57.7% (15/26). When we used the logistic regression model for univariate analysis, age, underlying disease (nonfatal versus ultimately or rapidly fatal), initial CRP level, initial absolute neutrophil count (ANC), peak CK level, and peak CRP level were predictors of death. Age, sex, underlying disease, initial chest radiographic findings, initial CRP level, initial ANC, peak CK level, lowest lymphocyte count, worst chest radiographic findings, peak LDH level, and peak CRP level were the predictive factors for respiratory failure (Table 5) . However, when we used logistic regression for multivariate analysis, underlying disease and initial CRP level were the only two factors significantly predictive for death (odds ratio [OR], 83.333 and 1.447 every 1 mg/dL increase, respectively; p < 0.001 and p = 0.006, respectively), and age, initial CRP level, and worst chest radiographic findings were predictive for respiratory failure (OR 1.076, 1.419 every 1 mg/dL, and 2.501 every one-lobe involvement, respectively; p = 0.01, p = 0.01, and p = 0.006, respectively). For the 65 patients who received steroids as the treatment protocol described above, 3 remained febrile and needed further pulse steroid therapy after the use of methylprednisolone with the dosage of 2 mg/kg/day. For the other 62 patients who became afebrile after steroid was administered, 12 had rebound of fever 2-3 days after the temporary defervescence. Seven of the 12 patients became afebrile again and had no fever 1-2 days after the transient rebound of fever without specific intervention. The other five patients received further pulse steroid therapy to control the fever and exacerbated clinical symptoms. For those 62 patients alive at the end of this study, the time to defervescence after disease onset was 10.3 ± 5.1 days. Major lung fibrosis directly caused by SARS developed in 6 of these 62 patients; this condition resulted in exertional dyspnea in 2 patients, oxygen-supplement dependence in 1 patient, and respiratory failure in 3 patients. By the end of the study, 58 of the 62 patients had been successfully discharged from NTUH. The other four patients, including three patients who had respiratory failure and one who was dependent on oxygen supplement, remained hospitalized. The duration of follow-up for these four patients was >4 weeks.
