Infectious PEDV was recovered from all samples in the 4.4°C control group. Samples from treatments of 65.6°C at 5, 10, and 30 s; and 76.7°C and 87.8°C at 5 s contained viable virus post-treatment. Heated water was effective at rendering PEDV nonviable at all other temperature and time points (Table 1 ). All samples, regardless of treatment, were positive for PEDV nucleic acid via rRT-PCR posttreatment (Ct range: 20.26-25.99). Treatment with 87.8°C water for 5 s resulted in a > 4 log reduction in viable virus (from 10 4.6 to 10 0.3 TCID 50 /ml). Viable PEDV was not recovered after a ten second or longer treatment with water heated to ≥76.7°C (Table) . The ANOVA showed that the effects of time, temperature, and the interaction between time and temperature were all significant predictors of the viral titer of infectious PEDV (p < 0.0001).
