A total number of 242 blood samples were collected from 200 children. During study clinic visits for an acute RTI, blood samples for MxA, CRP and WBC determinations were collected from 132 children. Nine children were excluded from the study because of missing nasal swabs and 3 because of bacterial infections (2 children with a culture confirmed pyelonephritis and 1 with orbital cellulitis, with MxA and CRP levels of 50 g/L and 63 mg/L; 90 g/L and 112 mg/L; 80 g/L and 104 mg/L, respectively), resulting in a group of 120 children visiting for RTI (Table 1) . Blood MxA was also measured from 110 children at scheduled visits at the age of 2 (n = 67) and 13 months (n = 43). Of these children, 33 had symptoms of respiratory infection at the time of sample collection. In addition, blood MxA level was determined in 44 asymptomatic parents (age, 25-56 years; males, 41%). Clinical, laboratory, and virus findings of the study subjects are presented in Table 1 . ROC analysis was used to estimate the ability of MxA to differentiate children with a laboratory-confirmed, symptomatic respiratory virus infection from asymptomatic virus-negative children. The greatest sum of sensitivity (92%) and specificity (77%) was obtained with a cut-off level of 175 g/L as the upper limit of normal range. A slighly lower specificity (75%) was obtained when the comparison group was asymptomatic children regardless of virus detection. The blood MxA protein levels in children, according to the presence of respiratory symptoms and virus detection, and in asymptomatic adults, are shown in Fig. 1 . The basal level of blood MxA (median [interquartile range]) was significantly higher in asymptomatic children than in asymptomatic adults (110 [60-185] g/L vs. 10 g/L; p < 0.001). MxA protein levels did not differ in asymptomatic children at 2 months compared to 13 months of age (120 [60-215] g/L vs. 90 [60-165] g/L; p 0.55). Children with a symptomatic, laboratory confirmed respiratory virus infection had higher MxA levels than asymptomatic virus-negative children MxA levels had a weak negative correlation with the duration of symptoms preceding the sampling, but the assay sensitivity was not affected (Fig. 2) . Symptomatic RV, RSV, PIV, Flu, CoV and HMPV infections were associated with elevated MxA levels, whereas MxA levels of HBoV infected children were not found to be different (p 1.00) from those of asymptomatic virus negative children (Fig. 3) . The MxA levels in children positive for more than one virus were similar to those seen in children positive only for one virus (590 [320-1200] g/L vs. 760 [345-1405] g/L; p 0.48). There was no significant correlation between the RV or RSV RNA copy numbers and the blood MxA levels (RV log of copies vs. MxA, Spearman's rho −0.259, p 0.064 and RSV log of copies vs. MxA, Spearman's rho −0.112, p 0.56). Samples were available from 11 children both during the healthy, asymptomatic state and later during a respiratory infection demonstrating individual MxA responses and significant differences between the states (Fig. 4) .
