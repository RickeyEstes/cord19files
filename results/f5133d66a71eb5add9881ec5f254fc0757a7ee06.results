The epidemic curves in terms of daily cumulative cases are shown on Figure 3 . In this figure, the cumulative number of positive cases was updated every day. The two estimated daily-cumulative curves by the proposed methods are quite similar to the final status curve before January but again the proposed method does not work well during the end stage of the epidemic. Table 1 compares the ARB of the daily cumulative number of positive cases between the different methods. After the first confirmed positive case appeared on July 6, 2006, the estimates based on the gamma model results in an estimate closer to the real data than the other methods. For other two curves, the nonparametric method performs worst at the end of the epidemic after January 1 and there was about 20 cases higher than the final status curve. The daily confirmed curve was about 50 cases lower than the final status curve during the peak of epidemic. Figure 4 showed the daily parameter estimates, α and β, of the gamma distributions used to dynamically calculate the daily number of positive cases. The parameter estimates varied from day to day and thus the probability of being a positive case changes. For the negative cases, the parameters had a jump during late September.
