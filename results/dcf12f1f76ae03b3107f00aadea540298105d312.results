Estimates of the days of SSE starts and ends, increments (j X , j Y ), and the number of SSE cases in Hospital X and Housing Estate Y are shown in Table 2 . Despite the somewhat shorter SSE Effective contact rates in the community during the first two days Exponential distribution (mean 1000) Effective contact rates in hospitals during the first two days Exponential distribution (mean 1000) duration for Housing Estate Y than for Hospital X, 2.5 times more cases occurred in Housing Estate Y than Hospital X. The estimated mean of the infectious period was 9.3 days (95% credible interval: (8.6-9.9)), with an estimated standard deviation of 2.3 days (95% credible interval: (1.8-2.9)). The proportion of the infectious period spent in the community decreased continuously with time (.60% at the beginning, ,20% as early as early April). Toward the end of the epidemic, .95% of the infectious period was spent inside hospitals (see Figure 3 ). The daily effective contact rates in the community (b t ) and hospitals (b b t ) exhibited progressive a decrease in time, as shown in The model's ability to reproduce the main features of the epidemic was checked by simulating 5000 epidemics with parameters sampled from the estimated joint posterior distribution, as described in Text S4. The size and duration of simulated epidemics, as well as cases breakdown in categories (gp, hw, hp) mirrored the Hong Kong epidemic (see Figure 2 ). We also simulated 100 epidemics with a single set of parameters, sampled from the posterior distribution. Then, the estimation procedure was applied to each simulated epidemic in order to reestimate the parameters. The original parameters were in the estimated corresponding 95% credible interval in 87% of cases.
