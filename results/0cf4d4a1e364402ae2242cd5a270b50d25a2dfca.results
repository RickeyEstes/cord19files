The kinetics of the in vitro antibody response obtained with the MLN cells from different animals were similar but differed in their magnitude. In this report, we present data from a piglet in whom the magnitude was close to the mean value determined for eight animals: 240.1 + 76.4 total Ig-ASC per 105 leukocytes with 26.1 _ 14.2 IgA-ASC.
