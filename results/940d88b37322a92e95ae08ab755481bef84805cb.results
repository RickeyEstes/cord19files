Our search retrieved 802 publications. Duplicates were detected and removed in EndNote X8.2 (Clarivate Analytics, 2018a), leaving 414 unique publications. A further 322 records were excluded during abstract screening using the criteria given above. Of the remaining 92, full text screening proved that a further 30 records met the exclusion criteria. Two records sampled Bactrian camels (largely restricted to Central Asia, they have not yet been found to have been infected with MERS-CoV) Liu et al., 2015; Miguel et al., 2016) , leaving 60 records pertaining to MERS-CoV seropositivity and/or RNA positivity in dromedaries (Fig. 1 ). 55 of these described cross-sectional studies of dromedary populations, sampling each animal at a single time-point only (40 measured seroprevalence and 32 measured RNA prevalence). Note that 6 studies were designed to investigate groups of dromedaries that had been epidemiologically linked to human cases of MERS-CoV infection rather than conducting a systematic/random survey. Longitudinal studies that measured seropositivity and viral RNA shedding in the same animals at multiple time-points, featured in 11 publications.
