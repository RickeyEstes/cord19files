Between December 1st 2015 and April 2nd 2016, 16 ICUs in 8 countries enrolled 49 critically ill patients with diagnosis of ZIKAV infection: Colombia 25, Venezuela 10, Salvador 6, Guatemala 2, Puerto Rico 2, Ecuador 2, Peru and Chile 1 each. The diagnosis of ZIKAV was established through RT-PCR in 10 patients (9 from serum, 1 from Cerebrospinal Fluid), ELISA in 10 patients (Serum) and using clinical/epidemiological criteria in the remaining 29 patients. Only those patients with diagnostic confirmation by RT-PCR were included (Fig. 1 ). Baseline characteristics are described in Table 1 . ELISA detection of IgM was negative for dengue (55%), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (46.9%), Cytomegalovirus (18.4%), hepatitis (14%), Epstein Barr virus (12%), Herpes Simplex virus (12.%), with the exception of one case positive for Dengue. Other tests for Chikungunya, Campylobacter jejunii, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, were made with lesser frequency. Seven patients still had eruption at the time of admission, as required by the WHO definition of ZIKAV infection case, and only one of them was pruritic, as seen in the convalescence period of other viral diseases like dengue (Table 1) . Nine patients came from urban areas, and 1 patient from rural area. Three reported Zika-like illnesses in family members. Eight patients were diagnosed with GBS, by an intensivist or a neurologist following the Brighton Criteria. Two patients diagnosed with encephalitis by neurologist according to clinically and radiologic criteria Indications for ICU admission were: respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular weakness in 6, altered level of consciousness in 3, and one septic shock ( Table 2 ). The median time lapse between initiation of symptoms and admission was 5.5 days (IQR 9-2). The median stay at UCI was 6.5 days (IQR 9-6) and the median time between initiation of symptoms and neurologic nadir was 6 (IQR 8-4). The median hospital stay was 13 days (IQR 14-3) ( Table 2) . A total of 6 patients required intubation and mechanical ventilation; all radiographs were described as normal, and the respiratory insufficiency had its origin in neuromuscular weakness; one required, additionally, nasal high flow oxygen during the stay. During the ICU stay, four confirmed patients received intravenous vasoactive drugs for shock; half required norepinephrine doses of N 0.1 μg/kg/min (Table 2 ). Six patients were treated with immunoglobulin and 1 with plasmapheresis ( Table 2) . Lumbar puncture (LP) was performed in 6 patients, with a mean time lapse between onset of symptoms and procedure of 13.4 ± 7.4 days. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed pleocytosis in 4, two of those also had increased proteins, and glucose was normal in all of them. Three patients underwent electromyography (EMG). Findings were consistent with demyelinating polyneuropathy in one, axonal polyneuropathy in the other and mixed in the last (Table 3 ). Fig. 2 shows this patient's EMG. Eight patients underwent brain imaging; three magnetic resonance images (MRI) and six Computed Tomographic (CT) images. One MRI was reported pathological with hyperintense lesions in frontal and temporal cortical regions bilaterally, and subcortical involvement that persisted in axial flair, rendering the sequence compatible with inflammatory lesions "characteristic of encephalitis/rhomboencephalitis" (Fig. 3) . One CT scan showed signs suggestive of brain swelling. All the other imaging studies were normal. Two patients had a clinical picture compatible with encephalitis. One patient was diagnosed after showing suggestive findings on MRI (as described above), a LP with 34 lymphocytes/mm 3 , elevated proteins and normal glucose with a positive RT-PCR for ZIKAV in the CSF. After an eleven-day stay in the ICU, the patient was discharged with no neurological disability. The other, admitted with a diminished level of consciousness, had the abnormal CT described above and died after less than a week in the ICU. The median Rankin scale at discharge was 1 (IQR 6-1), meaning no significant disability. Two patients died, one diagnosed with GBS (and subsequent multisystem organ failure), the other with encephalitis. The neurologic deficit responsible for ICU admission persisted at discharge in only one of all the cases. Nevertheless, this one patient suffered severe disability (bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care) ( Table 2 ).
