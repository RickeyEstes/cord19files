The development of the epidemic (figure 1) features a period of exponential growth, beginning on March 10, after the formal announcement of the outbreak, followed by a period of comparative stability throughout early to mid April, with evidence of a slight decay over the week April 21-28. The geographical and age distributions of the cases are presented in figure 1 . 57% of patients were female and 43% male. Clinical symptoms at presentation were fully recorded for about 90% of the cases confirmed by the Department of Health. The frequency of self-reported symptoms is similar to that noted in the early cases. 5 The most common reported symptom was fever (94%), with 51-72% of patients reporting general influenza-like symptoms, chills, malaise, loss of appetite, and myalgia. Gastrointestinal symptoms were less common at presentation, including diarrhoea (27%), vomiting (14%), and abdominal pain (13%). 88% reported fever plus any one other symptom, and 79% fever plus one of the five most common symptoms (table) . Infection events cannot be observed, but for patients with short and defined periods of exposure to known SARS cases, data on the timing and duration of exposure can be used to estimate the distribution of the incubation period, the time from infection to the onset of clinical symptoms of SARS. The database contained 57 patients with one exposure to SARS over a limited time scale with recorded start and end dates. The maximum likelihood estimate of the mean and variance of the time from infection to onset was 6·37 days (95 CI 5·29-7·75) and 16·69 days 2 , respectively; therefore 95% of patients would experience the onset of symptoms within 14·22 days of infection. The estimated distribution is presented in figure 2 . However, this distribution is based on a limited number of observations to date, and has high variance and may reflect biases in reporting, different routes of transmission, or varying infectious doses of the virus. Onset and admission times are both observable events. However, allowance must be made in the analysis for censoring due to incomplete observation. If censoring is not taken into account, the distribution will be biased towards short onset-to-admission times, because patients are only eligible to be included in the hospital-based database on admission to hospital. Patients with recent onsets and long onset-to-admission times are less likely to have been admitted to hospital and thus be included. In the analysis, patients were grouped by their week of clinical onset, and seven weekly time periods were analysed (Feb 26 to March 4, March 5-11, March 12-18, March 19-25, March 26 to April 1, April 2-8, and April 9-15). There were too few patients with clinical onset before Feb 26 for robust analysis and too little time has elapsed after onset to allow analysis of those with clinical onset after April 15. We assume that the recorded data are complete up to April 15. Estimated mean onset-toadmission times were obtained for each week, assuming that the times were ␥ distributed: Feb 26 to March The estimated mean and variance of the admission-todeath time was 35·9 days and 572·9 2 days, respectively, and the estimated mean and variance of the time from admission to discharge was 23·5 days and 62·1 2 days, respectively (figure 2). If ␥ distribution is assumed, the estimated distributions and case fatality rate varied as a function of patients' age, but not the time from onset to admission (figure 2). The estimated case fatality rate for patients younger than 60 years was 13·2% (9·8-16·8) and 43·3% (35·2-52·4) for patients aged 60 years and older. The adapted Kaplan-Meier-like nonparametric method gave estimates of 6·8% (4·0-9·6) and 55·0% (45·3-64·7), respectively (figure 3). The estimated fatality rates are higher than the estimate obtained from the current cumulative number of deaths divided by the current cumulative number of hospital admissions, because of the incomplete follow-up on patients still in hospital. A key feature of this epidemic is the clustering of cases in place and time linked to a particular individual (in some cases in a particular setting such as a residence block or health-care setting), where one primary case has led to many secondary and tertiary cases. The Amoy Gardens outbreak is particularly striking, with the onset times of the cases identified as arising from this setting following a ␥ distribution (figure 1). Work on the clusters is still evolving and will be reported in detail separately.
