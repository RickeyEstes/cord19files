Seventy three ENT HCW were screened for TB. Of these, 24 (32.8%) were referred for a Pulmonology appointment for suspected TB, as they were positive in the tuberculin test (all) with one patient in addition having a dry cough. The HCW with suspected TB were evaluated via chest X-ray, mycobacteriological sputum smear, bronchofibroscopy with bronchial lavage, diagnostic thoracocentesis and pleural biopsy. All 24 HCW underwent chest X-ray, which showed abnormalities in 10 cases. Six had expectoration and underwent mycobacteriological smear sputum exam and culture, which was positive in 2. Seven underwent bronchofibroscopy with bronchial lavage. In 2 cases, this was performed as the mycobacteriological sputum smear was negative and in the other 5 as they did not (Fig.1 ). Sete dos 9 doentes apresentavam sintomas sugestivos de tuberculose present expectoration. Diagnosis was made in 4 cases. One patient, with chest X-ray showing left pleural effusion, underwent diagnostic thoracocentesis and pleural biopsy. The latter method was conclusive in diagnosing TB. The evaluation and study allowed the diagnosis of 9 cases of TB (12.3%) and 3 cases of latent tuberculosis (4.1%). Eight of the 9 new TB cases were female and 1 male. Mean age of the patients was 30 years old (23-61 years). Six were nurses, 2 nursing auxiliaries and I a doctor (Fig.1) . Seven of the 9 patients presented symptoms suggesting TB (Fig. 2 ). X-rays showed pulmonary infiltrates (Fig. 2) . A apresentação radiológica dos casos distribuiu-se da seguinte forma: infiltrado pulmonar em 6 doentes; nódulo pulmonar em 2 casos e derrame pleural em 1 doente (Fig. 3) . O diagnóstico de tuberculose foi confirmado microbiologicamente através da identificação de Mycobacterium tuberculosis em 6 casos; num caso houve confirmação histológica, pela presença de granulomas epitelióides com necrose caseosa em retalhos de pleura parietal; em 2 casos foi assumido o diagnóstico de presunção (Fig. 4) . Um dos 9 casos de tuberculose apresentava derrame pleural esquerdo, que foi estudado, tendo para esse efeito sido realizada toracocentese diagnóstica (ADA: 119 U/L; exame directo e cul-in 6 patients, pulmonary nodules in 2 and pleural effusion in 1 (Fig. 3) . TB diagnosis was confirmed microbiologically via identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 6 cases. Histological diagnosis was used to confirm one case, identifying epithelioid granulomas with caseous necrosis in sections of parietal pleura. Two cases had a presumed diagnosis only (Fig. 4) . One of the 9 TB cases presented left pleural effusion. Diagnostic thoracocentesis ADA: 119 U/L was performed to study this. Smear and culture exam of the pleural liquid was negative. Mycobacterium tuberculosis study of the pleural liquid using the polymerase chain reaction molecular biology technique was negative. Pleural biopsy was performed as histological exam of the pleura fragments (Table I) . A presumed diagnosis was made in 2 cases as the mycobacteriological exams (smear, culture and polymerase chain reaction) of the bronchial lavage were negative. One patient had respiratory (chest pain) and bodily (fever) symptoms, a pos- Assim, verificou-se que em 2 casos os exames micobacteriológicos (directo, cultural e polymerase chain reaction) do lavado brônquico foram negativos, tendo sido assumido um diagnóstico de presunção. Um dos doentes apresentava sintomas respiratórios (toracalgia) e constitucionais (febre), prova de tuberculina positiva e alteração radiológica (nódulo pulmonar no lobo superior direito), pelo que efectuou tratamento com anti--bacilares de primeira linha durante seis meses, tendo ficado assintomático. Por outro lado, a tomografia computadorizada torácica de controlo, realizada 8 meses depois do início do trata-itive reactive to the tuberculin test and X--ray abnormalities (pulmonary nodule of the right upper lobe) and so was prescribed first line anti-bacillary treatment for six months, after which symptoms disappeared. In addition, a control chest CT scan made 8 months after start of treatment showed the nodular lesion on the right upper lobe had decreased in size. While the other patient had no symptoms, there was a positive reactive to the tuberculin test and X-ray abnormalities (pulmonary infiltrates in both upper lobes). Anti--bacillary treatment was prescribed for six months, after which a control chest CT scan showed resolution of the abovementioned pulmonary infiltrates, with patient remaining asymptomatic. Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomic DNA was extracted from cultures in 4 of the 9 patients. In 3 cases the culture was of bronchial lavage and in one case sputum. Molecular typing was then carried out, using Three cases of latent TB were also identified, one in a 54 year old nurse, one in a 50 year old nurse and one in a 32 year old nursing auxiliary. These were diagnosed due to positive reaction to the tuberculin test as patients did not present any symptoms of TB and chest X-rays did not show any abnormalities suggesting the disease. These 3 health care workers were prescribed chemo-prophylaxis with isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide for 2 months.
