Data are presented as mean ± SD or median (range) and n = 8 unless indicated. Haematology results are presented in Table 1 . The righting reflex was lost in 3 ± 1 min and the pedal withdrawal reflex in 5 ± 2 min after start of induction. Induction occurred without excitation or apnoea, and the number of intubation attempts ranged between 2 and 6. No apnoea or struggling was encountered during intubation. Time to intubation from start of induction was 9 ± 2 min (n = 7). Intubation failed in one rabbit and a close fitting mask (Galemed with connector, Kruuse svenska AB) was used instead. Induction doses for sufentanil and midazolam were 0.48 ± 0.11 μg/kg BW and 0.09 ± 0.02 mg/kg BW, respectively. Maintenance doses were 0.72 ± 0.15 μg/kg BW/h and 0.13 ± 0.03 mg/kg BW/h respectively, corresponding to a mean infusion rate of 0.29 ± 0.06 ml/kg BW/h. The infusion rate did not change statistically over 60 min of anaesthesia duration. Maintenance of anaesthesia was characterized by muscle relaxation and loss of the pedal withdrawal reflex. Compared to values during sedation, the respiratory rate was reduced during the first 20 minutes of anaesthesia (Table 2) . Two rabbits occasionally needed mechanical ventilation during maintenance due to apnoea. End-tidal CO 2 (ETCO 2 ) and arterial partial pressure of CO 2 (PaCO 2 ) were increased during most of the maintenance of anaesthesia ( Figure 1 ). Blood pH decreased from 7.50 ± 0.00 to 7.28 ± 0.04 and serum lactate from 1.9 ± 0.6 to 0.7 ± 0.2 mmol/L (n = 7). The arterial partial pressure of O 2 (PaO 2 ) increased from 9.6 (8.4-11.1) to 38 (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) kPa whereas mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased during anaesthesia ( Table 2 ). Heart rate (HR) and cardiac output (CO, n = 6) increased immediately after induction and remained high during most of maintenance ( Figure 2 ). No signs of arrhythmias were observed on the ECG. Rectal temperature dropped from 39.2°C (37.9-39.9) to 38.4°C (38.1-39.0) at 60 min. Blood glucose increased from 10.8 (6.6-14.0) to 16.0 (8.3-18.5) mmol/L (n = 7) and haematocrit from 23 ± 2 to 27 ± 1%. Sufentanil and midazolam serum levels did not change from 15 to 60 min during anaesthesia ( Figure 3 ). Time from stop of TIVA infusion to extubation was 5 ± 3 min, and to recovery of the righting reflex 7 ± 6 min. Recovery was without excitation. Body weight was reduced by 3% 24 h after anaesthesia and restored 48 h later. No clinical abnormalities were seen during the week after anaesthesia.
