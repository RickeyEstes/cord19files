All challenged calves (n = 30) had adequate passive transfer of maternal antibody (serum total protein â‰¥5.5 g/dL; Tyler et al., 1996) and survived the study period. Twenty-eight calves developed at least 1 cm 2 of lung consolidation within 24 h of challenge and were randomized to treatment (TX, n = 17; CON, n = 11). The challenge model failed to induce bronchopneumonia in 2 calves. These 2 calves were excluded from all analyses. Ultrasound score, clinical respiratory score, and exam number at the time of first treatment were similar between TX and CON calves, indicating suc-cessful randomization (Table 1 , P > 0.40). Box and whisker plots demonstrating the distribution of US and clinical respiratory scores over the course of the study period are shown in Figure 2 .
