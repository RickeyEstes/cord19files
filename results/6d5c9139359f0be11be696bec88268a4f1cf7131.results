We selected two CC strains (CC003/Unc and CC053/Unc) which (a) had shown extreme and divergent SARS-CoV responses in our preCC study , and (b) were available as completely inbred stains at the time we initiated this study [many preCC strains went extinct during the inbreeding process (Shorter et al. 2017) ]. PreCC funnel 3067, now the fully inbred line CC003/Unc, was highly resistant to SARS-CoV-induced weight loss ( Figure 1A ), despite having a high viral load in the lung at 4 d postinfection ( Figure 1B ). In contrast, preCC funnel 773, now the fully inbred line CC053/Unc, was highly susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, exhibiting extreme weight loss and mortality, but a low virus load in the lung. From CC003/Unc and CC053/Unc, we bred reciprocal F1 mice to test for susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection. Both male and female F1 mice were intranasally infected with 10 5 PFU of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15). All F1 animals showed intermediate weight loss and titer phenotypes ( Figure  1 , C and D and raw data in Table S2 ), and these phenotypes were highly similar regardless of the cross order. Together, the results suggested that genetic elements driving susceptibility and resistance in parental lines were not dominant, not dependent on parent of origin, and could be mapped in an F2 cross. Infected F2 progeny produce a range of disease F1 mice were bred to generate 264 F2 mice for challenge with SARS-CoV. All mice were infected with 10 5 PFU of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) at 9-11 wk of age, and monitored daily for weight loss and signs of disease until harvest at 4 d postinfection. Unlike the F1 mice, which had a narrow range of disease, F2 mice showed expanded phenotypes, exceeding both the range of weight loss and titer observed in the parents (Figure 2 ). Two percent (4/264) of F2 mice gained weight over the course of the 4 d infection, and an additional 41% (108/264) of F2 animals lost 0-10% of their starting weight, marking them as relatively resistant to infection (Figure 2A ). Thirty-seven percent (99/264) of animals were moderately susceptible, losing between 10 and 20% of their starting weight by day 4 postinfection. Twenty percent of animals were extremely susceptible to infection, losing either over 20% of their starting weight (12%, 33/264) or succumbing to infection (8%, 20/264). Notably, 28% of F2 mice showed transient weight loss, and began to recover from infection by day 4; they are represented in both the 0-10% and 10-20% weight loss groups. Overall, the weight loss results highlight the range and diversity of the F2 progeny's host response to SARS-CoV infection. In addition to weight loss, other markers of pathogenesis demonstrate the variability of the F2 response to SARS-CoV. Lung titers were assessed by plaque assay for all surviving F2 mice, and titers ranged from ,10 3 PFU per lung to .10 7 PFU per lung ( Figure 2B) . Notably, significant correlation was observed between weight loss and titer (Pearson's r 20.5553, P , 0.0001, Figure 2C ) at day 4 postinfection. Both male and female F2 mice had similar ranges of weight loss and virus load in the lung ( Figure S1 ); in addition, both showed significant correlations between the two phenotypes. Pulmonary hemorrhage was assessed at the time of tissue harvest, and illustrated a spectrum of disease. F2 mice ranged from no hemorrhage (85 mice with a score of zero) ( Figure 2D ) to extreme hemorrhage (42 mice with a score of 3 or 4). Hemorrhage was significantly correlated with both day 4 weight loss (r of 20.699, P , 0.0001) and titer (r of 0.487, P , 0.0001). Table S1 contains the full phenotypic data for all F2 mice including lung histopathology scoring. Mapping F2 phenotypes reveals multiple QTL F2 mice were genotyped using the MUGA array, and we conducted QTL mapping using 304 evenly spaced and informative markers using R/QTL (Arends et al. 2010) . We identified five QTL associated with a variety of traits: one locus on Chr18 (Host response to SARS QTL #5, Hrs5) was associated with weight loss at day 3 and day 4 postinfection, viral titer, pulmonary hemorrhage (Figure 3 ), vascular cuffing, and edema histopathology phenotypes ( Figure S2 ). Trait-specific QTL were also identified for day 3 weight loss (Hrs6 Chr 9), viral titer (Hrs7 Chr 7, Hrs8 Chr 12), and hemorrhage (Hrs9 Chr 15). Analysis of the chromosome Figure 1 preCC parent and F1 phenotypes. preCC mice from lines 3067 (n = 1) and 773 (n = 2) were infected with 10 5 PFU of MA15 and followed for overall pathogenesis as measured by weight loss relative to day zero (A) and virus titer in the lung at day four (B). Two animals from line 773 were received; however, one succumbed to infection at day 3 postinfection. Weight loss (C) and titer (D) were tested in reciprocal F1 mice [CC003·CC053 (n = 7 for WL and n = 4 for titer) and CC053·CC003 (n = 14 for WL and n = 12 for titer)]. 18 multi-trait QTL indicated a phenotypic contribution of 6.6% of day 3 weight loss, 8.5% of day 4 weight loss, 12.9% of variation in viral titer, 6% of hemorrhage, and a consensus region of 27.1-58.6 Mb (all QTL are summarized in Table 1 ). Table S4, Table S5, Table S6, and Table S7 show the complete QTL mapping files, with the LOD score at each of the 304 markers used. Given the number of loci segregating within this cross, we next assessed if there was evidence of epistatic interactions between these loci. We found strong support for additive interactions between Hrs5 and Hrs6 for day 3 weight loss (LOD = 8.27, genome-wide P = 0.05 threshold = 6.25), and also between Hrs5 and Hrs9 for hemorrhage (LOD = 9.43, genome-wide P = 0.05 threshold = 6.4). We found evidence for a full model of interaction (that is both additive and epistatic interactions) for viral titers between Hrs7 and Hrs8 (LOD = 13.3, genome-wide P = 0.05 threshold = 11.4), as well as between Hrs7 and Hrs5 (LOD = 17.5, genome-wide P = 0.05 threshold = 11.4) ( Figure 4) . We determined which ancestral (CC founder strain) alleles were segregating at each QTL in order to better understand the architecture of the QTL and SARS-CoV-associated responses we identified. Throughout the Hrs5 region, CC003/Unc has a PWK-derived allele, whereas CC053/Unc had a PWK (27.1-31.2 Mb), and then a C57BL/6J (31.2-51) or a C57BL/6J and 129s1/SvImJ (51-58.6 Mb) region of uncertainty ( Figure S3 ). The shared PWK/PhJ haplotype at the proximal end of the locus functionally reduced the QTL region to 31.2-58.6 Mb, and, at the most highly associated marker (JAX00083358, Chr18:51.41 Mb), we found that the CC003/Unc PWK-derived allele was associated with enhanced disease relative to the CC053/Unc C57BL/6J-derived allele-a case of transgressive segregation ( Figure 5) Ticam2 plays a critical role in SARS-CoV pathogenesis Given these haplotypic differences, we compared the PWK and C57BL/ 6J genomes on chromosome 18 from 31.2-58.6 Mb, looking for missense mutations or insertions/deletions to narrow potential candidate genes beneath the QTL. While it is possible that a spontaneous mutation in either CC003/Unc or CC053/Unc is the cause of Hrs5, we considered this to be the less likely scenario, and focused our initial bioinformatics analysis based on genotyping of the CC founder lines. Using the publically available Sanger sequences (Oreper et al. 2017) , we identified 743 missense mutations but no insertions or deletions in the consensus region encompassing 158 coding genes (Table S3 ). Further examination revealed that four of the missense mutations were located within Ticam2, formerly known as TRAM-a TLR adapter protein. Previous work by our group identified critical roles for the TLR pathways and adaptors in modulating SARS-CoV disease (Sheahan et al. 2008; Totura et al. 2015) , and led us to further pursue the role of Ticam2 in contributing to SARS-CoV pathogenesis. Although knockout mice do not test the effect of allelic variation in candidate genes, they can confirm the overall importance of a given gene in phenotypes of interest. In this case, Ticam2-deficient mice (Ticam2 2/2 ) had greater SARS-CoV induced weight loss than C57BL/6J control mice ( Figure 6A and raw data in Table S2 ) [and as previously described (Totura et al. 2015) ]. While Ticam2 2/2 mice had similar virus titers to C57BL/6J control mice at day 4 postinfection [ (Totura et al. 2015) and further confirmed in data not shown], their virus load is significantly higher at day 2 postinfection (Totura et al. 2015) . We further examined Ticam2 2/2 mice for the additional phenotypes that mapped to the same region of chromosome 18. Initially focusing on vascular cuffing, Ticam2 2/2 mice showed no notable increase in scoring relative to wild-type control mice despite their increased weight loss ( Figure 6B ). In contrast, pulmonary hemorrhage scores were significantly higher in Ticam2 2/2 mice at 4 d postinfection ( Figure 6C ). Overall, these data demonstrate an important role for Ticam2 in SARS-CoV pathogenesis, although additional loci contribute to variation in disease severity.
