The crude extracts of both plants exhibits better larvicidal, pupicidal and adulticidal activity against Ae. aegypti (Table 1) . The acetone and methanol extracts of P. tomentosa shown good mortality rate in Ae. aegypti with the LC 50 and LC 90 values of 9.325 and 1.223 μg/ml followed by T. asiatica having LC 50 and LC 90 values of 1.288 and 1.992, 1.284 and 1. 994 μg/ml (after 24 h) respectively. Whereas, the ethyl acetate and hexane extracts of P. tomentosa found to be moderate effect and T. asiatica noticed significant effect against Ae. aegypti. The least activity was noted in chloroform extract of both plants, after 24 h exposure period. After 48 h treatment of both plants crude extract against the Ae. aegypti mosquito showed better mortality rate with least LC 50 and LC 90 values in tested extracts. i.e. acetone (9.122 and 7.493 μg/ml), ethyl acetate (6.914 and 9.060 μg/ml), hexane (8.625 and 1.170 μg/ml) and chloroform (5.968 and 7.493 μg/ml) respectively. The pupicidal assay of plants extracts showed an excellent effect against test mosquito, after 24&48 h. Among them, acetone extract reflects highest pupicidal effect with the least LC 50 and LC 90 values i.e. 3.273 and 1.306 μg/ml, after 48 h exposure. Whereas, other tested crude extracts found to be more or less similar mortality rate, after 48 h of treatment. The adulticidal activity results of both plants were observed at 0-60 min time intervals. The crude extracts of plants shown notable adulticidal activity against Ae. aegypti. Among them, acetone and hexane extracts expressed good mortality and the best LC 50 and LC 90 values of P. tomentosa (32.105and 41.001 μg/ml, 11.810 and 44.215) and T. asiatica (09.012 and 11.852 μg/ml, 12.142 and 28.019 μg/ml) was noticed after 60 min. The antiviral property of plant extracts shown no significant cytopathic changes in cells treated with acetone extracts of T. asiatica and the best CC 50 value was recorded in the concentration of 500 μg/ml, but P. tomentosa acetone extracts failed to restrict the virus cell lines at concentration of 125 μg/ml (Table 2 and Fig. 1 ) it means that P. tomentosa expressed good antiviral potential. The preliminary phytochemical analysis of both plants revealed the presence of saponins, flavonoids and alkaloids in all the tested extracts. Amino acids and tannins were occurred in the acetone and methanol extracts. Proteins were present only in the chloroform extract and carbohydrates were found in chloroform and acetone extracts of both plants. Whereas, phenols are present only in the ethyl acetate extract of P. tomentosa (Table 3) . The GC-MS chromatogram results reflected forty nine compounds present in the acetone extract of P. tomentosa and seven major compounds (Table 4 & Figs. 2 and 3) were identified as follows: Hexanedioic acid, Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) Ester, 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 229 2, 6, 10, 15, 19 ,23-Hexamethyl-(ALL-E)-, 3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl-2-Hexadecen-1 OC, N-Hexadecanoic acid, Octadecanoic acid, Vitamin E and 1-Naphthalenepropanol, Alpha-Ethydecahydro-5-(Hydroxymethyl)-. But incase of T. asiatica have three major compounds like Tetracontane, 2-methyltetracosane and Eicosane ( Cytotoxicity concentration, denotes significant difference at P < 0.05, compared to the negative control using ANOVA followed by post hoc Duncan Multiple Range Test (DMRT), performed by SPSS software. (Table 6 & Figs. 6 and 7) . The highest sharp peak was noticed in aromatic compounds, so it may be a chance for presence of phenolic or flavonoids compounds in the plants.
