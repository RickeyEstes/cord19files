Protein modeling and p4a-dsRNA interface analyses. The high-resolution 3D structure of a protein and its interacting partners are of crucial concern when their interaction mechanisms need to be deciphered. In addition, only 3D atomic level structures can suggest plausible druggability of viral proteins. However, in this particular case, a high-resolution 3D structure of MERS-CoV p4a, alone or bound to dsRNA, is not available. Thus, p4a-DSRM, containing 72 amino acid residues, was modeled and investigated for its structural stability. 1YYK 34 , the crystal structure of Aquifex aeolicus dsRNA binding protein, was used as a template, with a TM-score of 0.7577 suggested by Iterative Threading ASSEmbly Refinement (I-TASSER) modeling server, to build p4a model. The sequence alignment of p4a with 1YYK shows a satisfactory normalized Z score of 1.27 (a normalized Z score > 1 is considered as a good score). The pairwise sequence alignment obtained from the T-COFFEE server also showed a satisfactory score of 76 (Fig. 1a) . After the validation of structures obtained from different servers and tools (Supplementary Table S1 ), the 3D structure obtained from I-TASSER was selected as the best model for further studies. The 3D structure validation and protein geometry results were found to be satisfactory, as provided by the ProSA web server. Thr19, Tyr22, and Ala50, located in loop regions, were found to be outside of the core region in the Ramachandran plot (Fig. 1b) . However, an overall ERRAT quality factor and Z-score values, calculated using ProSA-web, were found to be satisfactory (Supplementary Table S1 ). The obtained structure of p4a-DSRM exhibited a typical dsRBD structure that adopts an αβββα fold (Fig. 1c) . This particular folded structure has been endowed with the ability to recognize and bind to dsRNA 35 . To validate the arrangement of the secondary structural elements, the modeled protein was compared with the predicted secondary structure. MERS-CoV p4a consists of 33% helix, 33% strands, and 34% coils. In the model, the helices α1 and α2 span from residue positions 3 to 13 and 61 to 71, while β1, β2, and β3 span from residues 27 to 34, 42 to 48, and 53 to 58, respectively (Fig. 1d) . The optimized p4a model was selected and subjected to a structural similarity search. The TM-align 36 web server was used to match the structural feature of the query model to all Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures. Interestingly, we found that all of the top ten structures having the highest structural similarity with p4a were dsRBD-containing proteins (Table 1) . Based on the TM-score and high similarity in protein structures, as predicted through a global structure comparison, it is very likely that the target protein has the same function as the query. For a plausible functional annotation of p4a, a meta-server COACH 37 was used. COACH also suggested the same top two structures suggested by TM-align. Knowing the structural features and plausible dsRNA binding residues, we further investigated the RNA interaction mechanism of MERS-CoV p4a. A protein-RNA docking protocol was used to identify the binding interface and crucial residues in p4a. Residues in the α1 helix and β1-β2 loop regions make contact with the minor grooves of the dsRNA. However, K63 and K67, present in the α2 helix, make dominant contacts with the major groove of RNA ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). To decipher the involvement of all interfacial residues in p4a-dsRNA interaction and stability, we extended our analysis to computational mutagenesis.
