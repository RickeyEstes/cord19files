The survey was completed by 1222 subjects (70% participation rate). There were 477 visitors, 532 patients waiting to be seen who did not have a disposition, and 213 patients being boarded. The age and gender compositions of the patient population are shown in Figure 1 . A racial, gender, and age description of the entire sample, including visitors, is shown in Figure 2 . Those patients actually being boarded split fairly evenly as to preferred location for boarding. Patients waiting to be seen and visitors showed progressively decreasing tolerance for ED boarding. A similar trend was noted for subjects' opinions of a reasonable wait time to be moved to an inpatient bed from the ED (Table 1) . Combining all three groups, 801 (65.5%; 95% CI 62.8%-68.2%) stated a preference for being boarded in the hallway of an inpatient ward rather than in the ED, 406 (33.2%; 95% CI 30.6%-35.9%) would choose the ED, and 15 (1%; 95% CI 0.7%-2.0%) had no preference. There were no significant differences when evaluated by gender, season, or between daytime and nighttime participants. The commonly cited reasons among boarded patients for preferring inpatient ward boarding were privacy concerns and reduced noise levels (n ϭ 32, n ϭ 36). The most common reasons for preferring ED boarding are easy access to a doctor and the excitement of watching the care of other patients (n ϭ 30, n ϭ 5). An appropriate denominator for these reasons is difficult to select as most patient comments reflected frustration at waiting times rather than specific reasons for their preference for ED or ward boarding. Post hoc analysis of ED staffing, patient load, ambulance traffic, and ED status (open, open to trauma cases only, or closed to all ambulance traffic) was performed for the 499 subjects for whom the data were available. The ED was on "closure" (diverting all ambulance traffic) and on "trauma activation only" when 0.7% and 28.5% of the subjects, respectively, were surveyed. The total number of registered patients in the ED (including the waiting area) ranged from 20 to 77. The range of ED activity and staffing levels when the surveys were being conducted is shown in Figure 2 . On multivariate analysis, only ED closure approached statistical significance, odds ratio 2.43 (95% CI 0.99 -5.99, p ϭ 0.054), for predicting a preference for ward boarding. Ambulance traffic, nurse staffing level, and the number and type of other patients boarding did not differ between those who preferred ED boarding and those who preferred ward boarding.
