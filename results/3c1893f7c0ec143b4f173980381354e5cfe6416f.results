Fifty-six (15%) of 360 SARS patients who received treatment in one of 20 Ontario hospitals required intubation. Eleven patients were excluded from the primary analysis: seven had probable SARS, one patient was unclassifiable and three patients had at least one specimen positive by PCR, but did not have detectable antibodies to SARS CoV at $28 days after symptom onset. Thus, 45 patients were classified as having laboratory confirmed SARS and were included in the primary analysis as potential index cases for the exposed HCWs. Overall, 624 (90%) of 697 HCWs who were identified as having provided care to the 45 laboratory confirmed SARS patients consented to participate, could be classified as having had SARS or not, and had no other high risk exposures. They worked a total of 786 eligible shifts. Interviews were completed at a median of 4.2 months (range 0.2-10 months) after the eligible shift. 111 (17.8%) HCWs were involved in the care of more than one intubated SARS patient, with a maximum of 8 eligible patients cared for by the same HCW. The median number of participating HCWs involved in the care of each SARS patient during the relevant time period (24 hours prior to intubation until 4 hours post-intubation) was 15 (range 6 to 30). Of the 624 participating HCWs, 26 contracted SARS; all survived and none required intubation. SARS-CoV transmission to HCWs was attributable to 7 of the 45 laboratory confirmed SARS patients. Transmission to 22 HCWs could be definitively attributed to a single patient, with 6 patients transmitting to 1, 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 HCWs respectively. The remaining four HCWs who acquired SARS had cared for more than one SARS patient during the high risk period, making it difficult to precisely identify which patient was the source of infection. For the primary analysis, we assumed a 'most likely scenario' for assigning transmission to one patient. Three of the infected staff members cared for two patients whose intubations were a few hours apart. Since one patient was the source of infection for five other individuals; we assumed in the primary analysis that this patient had also transmitted SARS-CoV to these 3 HCWs. The fourth HCW was involved in the care of two intubated patients; transmission was assumed to have occurred on the shift that involved emergency intubation and cardiac resuscitation. No patient characteristics were statistically significantly different between patients who did and did not transmit SARS-CoV (Table 1) . HCWs who contracted SARS were more likely to be paramedics (p,.01) and had less infection control training (p,.009) than other workers ( Table 2 ). They were less likely to always wear goggles (p,0.01) or a gown (p = .02) while in the patient's room, and more likely to have used less effective methods of respiratory protection while in a patient's room (p = .04). They were more likely to have participated in administering noninvasive ventilation (p,0.01), and to have performed ECGs (p,0.01), fiber optic intubation (p,0.01) or manual ventilation before intubation (p,0.01) than HCWs who did not develop SARS (Table 3 ). In the CART analysis allowing individual patients to be entered as covariates, patient covariates were the top four splitting variables according to the deviance at each node (Figure 1 ). Twenty-three of the 26 HCWs who acquired SARS were involved in the care of one of these four patients. The results of this analysis did not change when only HCWs with exposures to single patients were considered, or when we altered the assumptions regarding which patient infected the four HCWs with exposures to two patients. If patients were not included as predictor variables (Figure 2) , then the first splitting variable was whether the patient P/F ratio was .35.5 or ,35.5 (3% vs 42% contracted SARS). Among the 605 HCWs involved in the care of patients with P/F ratio .35.5, the most predictive variable was whether or not the HCW wore eye protection (1% of HCWs infected wearing eye protection vs 8% infected not using eye protection). It should be noted that the single patient with P/F ratio ,35.5 was the patient who was the first splitting variable in the CART analysis with individual patients included. In univariate GEE models (Table S1) , patient characteristics associated with transmitting SARS-CoV were: P/F ratio #59, gender, death due to SARS, APACHE II score $20, presence of diarrhea within 24 hours of intubation, any chronic underlying illness disease, and diabetes mellitus (when underlying illnesses were considered separately). HCW characteristics associated with acquiring SARS included eye/mucous membrane exposure to blood/body fluids, performing intubation, and presence in the room for any of cardiac compressions, defibrillation, ECG, intubation, manual ventilation, manipulation of oxygen mask or tubing, collection of sputum or stool samples, or transporting the patient. In the multivariate GEE logistic regression model (
