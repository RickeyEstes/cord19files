Cytotoxicity of NHC in HepG2 and CEM cell lines. Prior to conducting experiments on mitochondrial function, the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) of NHC was determined in each of the cell lines used in this study. The results of these assays are summarized in Table 1 and in Table S1 in the supplemental material. The CC 50 values for the human hepatic origin HepG2 cell line were measured in cells grown in glucose-containing media and in glucose-free media. Cells grown in the presence of glucose are subject to the Crabtree effect, whereby they are able to produce nearly all of their ATP through glycolysis, even though the cells possess functional mitochondria (20) . Furthermore, it has been shown that cells are more susceptible to mitochondrial toxins when glucose is replaced with galactose in the incubation media (20) . In a side-by-side experiment, the CC 50 values for NHC were similar in HepG2 cells incubated with glucose and in HepG2 cells incubated with galactose instead of glucose. By this measure, NHC does not impair mitochondrial function in this cell line. Among other tested cell lines of different tissue and species origin, the T-lymphoblastoid origin CEM cell line was the most susceptible to NHC treatment, with CC 50 values 3-to 4-fold lower than in other cell lines tested (see Table S1 ); therefore, the CEM cell line was chosen to evaluate the potential for NHC to cause mitochondrial toxicity. In addition, the HepG2 cell line was also chosen since HepG2 cells have been traditionally used to evaluate mitochondrial toxicity (2, 14, 20, 21) and have demonstrated their utility. NHC is efficiently converted in cells to its 5=-triphosphate. Ribonucleoside analogs must be converted into their 5=-triphosphate metabolites to be utilized as the substrates by RNA polymerases and incorporated into RNA. To confirm that NHC is converted to its 5=-triphosphate form, NHC-TP, HepG2, PC-3, and CEM cells were incubated with NHC and intracellular levels of NHC-TP were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In HepG2 cells treated with 20 M NHC, intracellular NHC-TP levels reached a maximum concentration of 732.7 Ϯ 2.9 pmol/10 6 cells after a 6-h incubation (Fig. 1A) and remained stable for up to 24 h in the presence of drug in the media. This level appears to be higher than the previously reported value of 71.12 Ϯ 22.66 pmol/10 6 cells, which was determined after a 6-h incubation with 10 M NHC (14) . In CEM cells treated with 10 M NHC, the intracellular levels of NHC-TP reached a maximum of 158.4 Ϯ 14.5 pmol/10 6 cells after a 1-h incubation (Fig. 1B) . In PC-3 cells treated with 10 M NHC, the intracellular levels of NHC-TP reached a maximum concentration of 819.5 Ϯ 16.8 pmol/10 6 cells after a 6-h incubation (Fig. 1C) . These experiments confirm that NHC is efficiently converted to its 5=-triphosphate metabolite in all tested cells. NHC-5=-triphosphate is a substrate for POLRMT in primer extension assays. A nonradioactive primer extension assay was used to determine whether NHC-TP can be incorporated into RNA by POLRMT as a cytidine analog. The incorporation efficiency of a ribonucleoside analog is usually compared to the natural ribonucleoside; however, in the case of CTP analogs, CTP is incorporated much more efficiently by POLRMT than most CTP analogs which makes it difficult to directly compare their incorporation efficiencies under the same conditions (7) . To facilitate the measurement, 3=-dCTP can be used as an intermediary (7) . In a single nucleotide incorporation primer extension assay it was determined that POLRMT favors 3=-dCTP as a substrate over NHC-TP with a discrimination value of 12.4 Ϯ 1.2 (Fig. 2) . Previously, it has been determined that POLRMT favors CTP over 3=-dCTP with a discrimination factor of 59.7 Ϯ 1.6 (7). By extrapolation, POLRMT favors CTP as a substrate over NHC-TP by a factor of approximately 740. This value suggests that NHC-TP is a relatively efficient substrate for POLRMT (7) . It was further determined that NHC-TP does not cause immediate chaintermination upon incorporation into nascent chain RNA in an alternative assay where multiple nucleotides could be incorporated (Fig. 3 ). As shown in Fig. 3 , after NHC-TP was incorporated as a C-analog at the ϩ2 position, NHC-TP can be further incorporated as a G-analog forming a ϩ3 band and as a U-analog at the ϩ4 position in conditions when no competing natural GTP or UTP are present. Partial chain termination occurs at multiple sites further downstream after incorporation of NHC-TP, as demonstrated by accumulation of the unextended bands at the ϩ7 to ϩ9 positions. NHC causes stronger reduction in mitochondrial DNA-encoded protein expression than in nuclear DNA-encoded protein expression. Since NHC-TP is a substrate for POLRMT and the NHC-modified RNA may have different translation properties, it is important to understand if POLRMT-mediated protein expression is selectively affected in cells incubated with NHC. The effect of NHC on expression of mitochondrial DNAencoded protein cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COX1) was compared to the effect on expression of nuclear DNA-encoded protein succinate dehydrogenase A (SDH-A) in PC-3 cells using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based quantitative assay. PC-3 cells were chosen because they have been shown to be highly sensitive to mitochondrial toxins in this assay and, therefore, are preferable for such analysis (22) . The results of this assay are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2 . In PC-3 cells incubated with increasing concentrations of NHC for 5-days, the measured 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value for COX1 protein expression was 2.7-fold lower relative to the IC 50 for SDH-A protein expression, suggesting that NHC has slightly stronger negative effect on mitochondrial mRNA transcription and/or translation. For comparison, chloramphenicol, which was used as a positive control, exhibited stronger effect on mitochondrial protein expression, with IC 50 values of COX1 protein inhibition ϳ12-fold lower compared to that of SDH-A protein (see Table S2 ). Similarly, dideoxycytidine (ddC) showed selective inhibition of COX1 expression with an SDH-A/COX1 IC 50 ratio of Ͼ49.2. Long-term incubation with NHC in CEM or HepG2 cells does not cause a reduction in mtDNA levels, or an increase in lactate production. Mitochondrial toxicity can be exhibited by a decrease in mitochondrial number per cell or by a decrease of function in existing mitochondria. The decrease of functional activity of mitochondria should result in less production of ATP by mitochondria even if the mitochondrial number has not changed. In glucose-containing culture medium conditions, the decrease in mitochondrial number or in mitochondrial function in the affected cell puts additional demands on ATP production through mitochondrionindependent anaerobic glycolysis, which is registered by an increase in lactate production. To determine whether any of the mechanisms are involved, i.e., the decrease in The incorporation efficiency was evaluated based on the extension of 22-mer to 23-mer products. The measured K 1/2 values are shown on the right of the graph. The discrimination between the analog and 3=-dCTP, D* analog , was calculated as K 1/2, analog /K 1/2, 3=-dCTP (where K 1/2 is defined as the analog triphosphate concentration resulting in 50% product extension). The D* EIDD-2061 in this experiment is 13.2. In second analogous experiment repeat, the D* EIDD-2061 was measured to be 11.5. mitochondrial quantity or the decrease of mitochondrial function due to decrease in mitochondrial protein quantity or protein function (13, 21, 23) , the effect of long-term incubation with NHC on both mitochondrial number and lactate production in treated cells was investigated. To measure the long-term effects of exposure to NHC, HepG2 cells were incubated with NHC at 10 and 100 M for 14 days, and CEM cells were incubated with NHC at 10 and 30 M for 14 days. The concentrations were selected near or just above the CC 50 concentrations for the corresponding cell line. Higher treatment concentrations could not be tested since not enough cells survived to perform the assay. After 14 days of treatment, mtDNA copy number in cells and lactate levels in cell culture media were measured relative to the mock-treated cells. ddC, a known inhibitor of DNA polymerase Tables 3 and  4 . There was not a significant difference in relative mtDNA levels in HepG2 cells treated with NHC for 14 days at either concentration. After treatment at 10 M, the level of relative mtDNA in HepG2 cells was 115.0 Ϯ 92.4% compared to a mock-treated control, and after treatment at 100 M, relative level of mtDNA was 68.4 Ϯ 17.6% of the control, but the difference was not statistically significant (P ϭ 0.8). Parallel treatment with positive controls ddC and EtBr resulted in mtDNA decreases to 7.1 Ϯ 2.8% and 19.6 Ϯ 12.1%, respectively, compared to a mock-treated control. The lactate levels in the NHC-treated cells were 103.7 Ϯ 21.2% relative to the mock-control when cells were treated at 10 M and 111.5 Ϯ 38.5% when treated at 100 M, indicating no significant increase in lactate production after 14 days of treatment at either concentration. Treatment with positive controls ddC and EtBr resulted in extracellular lactate increases to 195.9 Ϯ 61.9% and 242.5 Ϯ 47.8%, respectively. In CEM cells treated with NHC at 10 or 30 M, relative mtDNA was measured at 80.0 Ϯ 19.1% and 78.7 Ϯ 15.8%, respectively, compared to the mock-treated controls (100 Ϯ 10.8%). Although the differences of relative mtDNA levels from the controls were statistically significant (P Ͻ 0.05), they were likely not meaningful, particularly considering that no additional decrease was observed at a higher treatment concentration. For comparison, in CEM cells treated with positive controls, the relative mtDNA levels were decreased to 0.15 Ϯ 0.06% after incubation with ddC and to 0.39 Ϯ 0.11% for cells incubated with EtBr. The lactate levels in CEM cells incubated with NHC at 10 M were increased slightly to 118.1 Ϯ 3.4% relative to the mock control but were not increased after incubation with NHC at 30 M (101.8 Ϯ 12.7%). In CEM cells treated with positive controls, the lactate levels were 310.5 Ϯ 71.2% after treatment with ddC and 260.7 Ϯ 39.3% after treatment with EtBr.
