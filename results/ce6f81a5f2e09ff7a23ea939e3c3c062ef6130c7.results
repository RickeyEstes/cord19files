From 2002 to 2012, a total of 65,124 CKD decedents aged â‰¥ 60 years who passed away in hospitals or shortly after discharge were identified. The mean (SD) age at death was 77.5 (8.7) years and 42.9% had a diagnosis of ESRD (Table 1) . During the last 30 days of life, 23.9% of decedents received inpatient care from nephrologists, with an additional 12.9% receiving care from surgeons, 4.1% from family medicine physicians, and the remaining patients from physicians of other specialties. Regional hospitals accounted for the largest share (43.5%) of EOL inpatient care, followed by medical centers (33.6%); the majority of inpatient care took place in private hospitals (66.5%). Across regions, Taipei had the largest number of the CKD decedents (28.8%), whereas the eastern region had the fewest (3.6%). During the study period, the annual number of CKD decedents peaked at 7164 during 2003, when Taiwan experienced an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome that may have caused adverse health outcomes [41] . Through the database of 1,000,000 randomly sampled individuals, we had access to the detailed prescription data of 2072 decedents between 2005 and 2012. The characteristics of this sub-sample are similar to those of the population-based sample ( Table 1) . Table 2 presents the distribution of our outcome measures, namely 30-day EOL inpatient expenses and the probability of receiving intensive health services such as surgical interventions, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, resuscitation, and dialysis treatment. The average 30day EOL inpatient expense was approximately US$10,260 (NT$332,422, at US$1 = NT$32.4) and varied from US$8000 (NT$260,000) to US$12,300 (NT$400,000). Expenses were relatively higher for patients aged 60-70 years, females with lower insurable earnings, and those with ESRD; in addition, expenses incurred at medical centers and public hospitals were also higher. Moreover, apparent temporal variations were observed. All the aforementioned differences were statistically significant ( Table 2 ). The variation in the average probabilities of receiving surgical interventions across sub-populations was generally similar to that of the EOL inpatient expenses, except that the difference in the probabilities of surgical interventions by insurable monthly earnings group was not statistically significant.
