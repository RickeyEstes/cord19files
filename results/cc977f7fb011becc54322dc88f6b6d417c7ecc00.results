Overall, 1003 patients were screened and 180 met the inclusion criteria, of which 163 (91%) subjects gave an IC and were included into the study. Ninety-one (55.8%) subjects were negative for any influenza virus infection, 72 (44.2%) subjects tested positive for influenza virus infection. Sixty-five subjects (39.9%) were confirmed with influenza virus A infection, including 50 cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. The subtyping was inconclusive for 15 specimens of influenza type A. There were eight (4.9%) cases with influenza B virus infection (seven B/Victoria; one unsubtyped) and one (0.6%) had a co-infection with unsubtyped influenza virus A and B/Victoria. Eighty-four (91.3%) patients were swabbed within 4 days of antiviral administration, of which 32 (34.8%) were administered antivirals before or on the day of swabbing and 39 (42.4%) patients were swabbed 1 day after the administration of antivirals. In addition to influenza, seven subjects were co-infected: two with adenovirus (2.8%), one with coronavirus (1.4%), two with metapneumovirus (2.8%) and two with RSV (2.8%). Other respiratory pathogens isolated from the study participants (n=25) were RSV (6, 3.7%), adenovirus (5, 3.1%), metapneumovirus (5, 3.1%), rhinovirus (6, 3.7%), coronavirus (2, 2.3%) and parainfluenza (1, 0.6%). The observed influenza peak in our study occurred in week 6 (figure 1), which overlapped with the nationally detected influenza season's peak in Lithuania in 2015-2016 (figure 2). The average age of the influenza cases was significantly lower than the controls (59 vs 67 years old). Influenza cases had significantly less underlying medical conditions, such as cardiovascular and lung diseases, were less often hospitalised during the last 12 months due to the exacerbations of the underlying illnesses, and were prescribed oseltamivir twice more often (table 1) . Fifteen (9.1%) subjects were vaccinated against influenza in the 2015-2016 season, of which 12 were â‰¥65 years old (table 1). All vaccinations occurred more than 14 days before the onset of SARI. Vaccinated individuals were older, more likely to have received the seasonal influenza vaccine during the previous season and had slightly shorter length of hospitalisation (table 1) . Influenza cases appeared to have more cough and less shortness of breath and deterioration of general condition than the controls (table 2) . In the total sample, five out of 163 patients died during the hospitalisation, of which 4/72 (5.6%) within the influenza confirmed cases (including one vaccinated death), and 1/91 (1.1%) within the controls (ceased subject not vaccinated).
