Synthesis and isolation of PRRSV-specific cDNA clones: Demonstration of PRRSV genomic and subgenomic mRNAs As determined by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequent staining with acridine orange, an RNA species of about 15 kb could be enriched in the course of virion purification from the supernatants of PRRSV-infected macrophages (not shown). For arteriviruses, similar sizes of genomic RNAs have been described, namely 13 kb for EAV and 13 to 14 kb for LDV (Den Boon et al., 1991; Godeny et al., 1990; Kuo et al., 1991) . It seemed likely that PRRSV genomic RNA also terminates with a poly(A) tail. Acco rdingly, oligo(dT) was employed for priming of an analyticai first cDNA strand synthesis, w here efficient incorporation of [a-32 P)-labeled dCTP occurr ed (not show n}. To investigate whether the labeled cDNA originated mainly from the viral RNA or from contaminating cellular RNAs, Northern hybridizations were performed with tot al RNA from PRRSV-infected and noninfected macrophag es. Prominent specifi c bands appeared with t he RNA of infected cells , wh ile only faint hybridization signals were obtained with RN A from noninfected cells (Fig. 1) . The largest hybridizing RNA population corresponded in size to the supposed 15-kb PRRSV genomic RNA. In addition, a set of subgenomic RNAs in the range of 0.9 to 3.7 kb were observed. Thus the bulk of eDNA primed w ith oligo(dT} originated from PRRSV RNA wh ich is obviousl y polyadenylated. Using again oligo(dT) as a primer, preparative eDNA synthesis was performed . A cDNA bank was established in XZAPII phages and sc reened with the labeled singlestranded eDNA probe. Plaques showi ng strong hybridization signals were isolated and recomb inant pBluescri pt were obtained by in vivo excision from XZAPII. The isolated inserts proved to be specific for PRRSV by hybridization experiments wit h infected and noninfected cells as described above. North ern hybridization showed in addition, that the RNA isolated from purified virions, wh ich was used for cDNA synthesis. consisted mainly of the 15-kb popul ation ( Fig. 2} . PRRSV-specific cDNA clones we re characterized by restriction mapping and terminal sequencing . Most clones from the oligo(dT) primed c DNA started within a short stretc h of nucl eotide s, whi ch was supposed to be located close to the genomic 3' end. Clone pPRRSV-T1 had a size of 5 kb and possessed a term inal stretch of four A residues ; most likely thes e represent the first nucleotides of the genomic poly(A) tail (see below ).
