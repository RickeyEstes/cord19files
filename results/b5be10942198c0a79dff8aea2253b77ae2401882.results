Among the 46 patients, 27 patients suffered from fever(≥37.3℃) on admission, and 15 patients received methylprednisolone therapy, while the remaining patients not. The dynamic change of the body temperature for the 27 patients was shown in Figure 1A . The number and percentage of the patients whose body temperature decreased to the normal range on different day from treatment beginning was reported as follows(methylprednisolone therapy vs. no methylprednisolone therapy ): day 2, 7(46.7%) vs. 2 Figure 1B ). The median of SpO2 at rest was similar between patients with and without methylprednisolone therapy on admission. Due to the low SpO2, all of the 46 patients received oxygen therapy. The daily SpO2 of each patient was shown in Figure 2A . The average SpO2 of every day was compared between patients with and without methylprednisolone therapy, as shown in Figure 3B , the methylprednisolone therapy group had a faster improvement of SpO2: (Table 2 ). However, in terms of chest CT scan on day 7 and 14, we found the absorption degree of the focus was significantly better in the patients with methylprednisolone ( Figure 4) . .
