Poliovirus dried on stainless carriers 50 μL of poliovirus inoculum applied in the middle of each stainless steel disc were dried under the airflow of a class II biological safety cabinet at room temperature (20 ±2°C) for 2 h (±15 min). After 0, 90 and 150 min, the dried inoculum was recovered and titrations were performed as described in the Materials and Methods section. As shown in Figure 1 , the infectious titer of inoculum before drying was 10 6 TCID 50 .mL -1 . After drying, it was 10 5.1 TCID 50 .mL -1 and was roughly maintained at this level up to 150 minutes after drying (10 4.6 TCID 50 .mL -1 ).
