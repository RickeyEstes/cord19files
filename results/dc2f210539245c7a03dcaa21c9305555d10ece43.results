In the clinical setting, RLI would be obtained from tumorbearing hosts. We therefore examined whether RLI is still effective when the lymphocytes are obtained from tumor-bearing mice. Recipients of RLI from tumor-bearing mice showed similar tumor survival compared to recipients of RLI from naive donors. Thus, with a purging procedure, the same anti-tumor effect was achieved with RLI from tumor-bearing hosts as from non-tumorbearing hosts. Allogeneic lymphocyte injection is a potentially feasible antitumor therapy. We therefore compared anti-tumor effects of allogeneic lymphocyte infusion into naive mice with that of RLI given to mixed chimeras. RLI recipients had longer survival than naive mice receiving allogeneic lymphocytes. This result suggests not only that the anti-tumor effect of RLI therapy is stronger than allogeneic lymphocyte infusion therapy but also suggests that rejection of allogeneic cells is insufficient and mixed chimerism is required prior to the induced rejection to achieve maximum antitumor effects. CONCLUSION Together, these data reinforce the potential of RLI therapy to be a new HSCT strategy which does not have the risk of graft-versus-host disease. ThymoglobulinR, a rabbit anti-human thymocyte globulin, is FDA approved for use in acute transplant rejection. Positive results in this setting suggest that ThymoglobulinR would likely be effective against graft-versus-host disease. To test this hyothesis preclinically, we generated an anti-mouse thymocyte antiserum (mATG) by immunizing rabbits with mouse thymocytes and purifying IgG from the resulting immuneserum. These methods were performed identically to those used to generate ThymoglobulinR, the human counterpart ATG. In addition, a model of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was developed. GVHD was induced by transfer of spleen cells from C57BL/6 mice into non-irradiated BALB/c RAG-2 deficient mice that lack mature T and B cells. Following transfer of the allogeneic cells, the C57BL/6 hosts displayed progressive weight loss which was accompanied by increased production of a variety of proinflammatory cytokines detected in the serum, hepatic necrosis and inflammation in several organs. In the absence of therapeutic intervention, control mice display significant disease within 3 weeks. We then applied mATG at various time points following cell transfer in the GVHD model to evaluate its effectiveness in disease prevention/reversal. Administration of mATG at days 0-3 post allogeneic cell transfer depletes most T cells from the circulation (FACS analysis) and completely prevents all evidence of acute GVHD. GVH mice treated with mATG showed no evidence of weight loss, elevated cytokine levels or target organ pathology. This protective effect of mATG on acute GVHD persisted for at least 12 weeks. We also tested the effectiveness of mouse ATG treatment given after acute GVHD was well established. In contrast to mATG administration at the initiation of disease, treatment 10-13 days following allogeneic cell transfer showed no evidence of GVHD amelioration. Thus, we show that dependent upon timing of dosing, mATG treatment can be quite effective at preventing acute GVH in a murine model of disease. These results suggest that exploration of ThymoglobulinR dosing in relation to bone marrow transplant in human patients as prophylaxis for GVHD is warranted. This work is supported by Genzyme Corporation. The role of IFN-g in the induction of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) has been elusive. IFN-g is protective in lethally irradiated mice receiving allogeneic T cells plus marrow cells, but deleterious in non-conditioned or sublethally irradiated recipients of allogeneic T cells alone (i.e., without marrow cells). We have recently observed that T cells from IFN-g KO donors induce more severe damage in parenchymal GVHD target tissues, but have reduced ability to eliminate recipient hematopoietic cells in lethally irradiated murine allo-HCT models. These results suggest that the deleterious effect of IFN-g in allo-HCT recipients of donor T cells alone might be due to facilitation of anti-host lymphohematopoietic GVH reactions, which result in destruction of host type hematopoietic cells and hematopoietic failure of the recipients. To test this hypothesis, we compared the development of GVHD in sublethally irradiated (6 Gy) B6D2F1 mice that received splenocytes alone or along with bone marrow cells (BMC) from IFN-g KO or wild-type (WT) B6 donors. B6D2F1 mice that received sublethal irradiation alone were used as non-GVHD controls and all survived long-term. Consistent with published studies, the recipients of WT B6 splenocytes alone (without BMC, so that the inoculum contained minimal numbers of hematopoietic stem cells) developed more severe GVHD compared to mice receiving a similar number of splenocytes from KO B6 donors (P b 0.05). In contrast, when mice received donor spleen cells along with BMC, the recipients of KO allo-HCT developed severe acute GVHD and succumbed to death by 5 weeks, while most of the recipients of WT allo-HCT survived long-term (P b 0.01). Unlike the recipients of WT allo-HCT, the addition of BMC to splenocytes did not significantly delay GVHD death in the recipients of GKO allo-HCT. In order to quantitatively evaluate the ability of WT vs. IFN-g KO donor T cells to induce lethal GVHD, we compared the survival of lethally irradiated B6D2F1 mice that received a fixed number of BMC along with titrated numbers of splenocytes from WT or IFN-g KO B6 mice. The minimal number of splenocytes needed to induce lethal GVHD was approximately 10 fold less for KO than WT donor cells. Taken together, our results indicate that WT allo-HCT mediates stronger lymphohematopoietic GVH reactions than GKO allo-HCT, but the latter cause more severe damage in parenchymal tissues. Since lymphohematopoietic GVH reactions may selectively eliminate host lymphohematopoietic cells, including lymphoma cells, a better understanding of the mechanisms by which IFN-g separates the two types of GVH reactions could lead to novel approaches to separating GVHD and graft-vs.-leukemic effects. Background: It has been shown that CTLA-4 blockade early after murine MHC-disparate allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) results in augmentation of donor or host alloreactivity (graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), resp. rejection). Later after BMT, CTLA-4 blockade in combination with DLI induced a graft-vsleukemia (GVL) effect with a slightly increased risk for GVHD. Aim: To explore, in a model of MHC-compatible, miHCdisparate allo BMT, how CTLA-4 blockade can be used to modulate GVHD and to induce GVL effects. Materials & Methods: C3H Â AKR 7,5 Gy radiation BM chimeras were treated with blocking anti-CTLA-4 MoAb (UC10-4F10) or irrelevant Hamster IgG, early (d-1 to 12) or late (d21 to 34). Mice were monitored for weight changes, clinical signs of GVHD and survival. Moribund animals were sacrificed for histopathology. FACS was used to study T cell chimerism and host/donorreactive T cell-frequency, MLR to study ex vivo alloreactivity, ELISA to determine circulating antiDNA Ab. Results: CTLA-4blockade early after non-T cell depleted (TCD) allo BMT induced acute and (N90%) lethal GVHD (increased donor T cell chimerism and alloreactive TCR-Vb6 + cells), histopathologically confirmed. Late after non-TCD allo BMT, however, CTLA-4blockade induced weight loss, alopecia, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and cachexia with 60% mortality. Treated and nontreated animals did not show any difference in chimerism or alloreactive T cell-frequency. Histopathology showed lymphoproliferation in spleen, lymph nodes but also in stomach, intestine, salivary glands and liver. In the liver, periportal infiltrates showed numerous plasmacells. AntiDNA Abs and liver-enzyme abnormalities were detected in the treated group. Ex vivo, splenocytes of diseased animals showed strikingly strong spontaneous proliferation but MLR reactivity towards host-or donor-type antigens was equal to that of tolerant non-treated chimeras. Conclusions: In a miHC-disparate context, CTLA-4-blockade, early after non-TCD BMT induces vigorous acute GVHD, consistent with activation of alloreactive T cells from the BM inoculum. In contrast, CTLA-4 blockade from day 21 onwards does not give rise to the breaking of transplantation tolerance, however, induces a lymphoproliferative syndrome with autoimmune manifestations.Our data suggest that after non-TCD allo miHC-disparate BMT, donor-host tolerance relies on clonal deletion which is insensitive to aCTLA-4 Ab. In contrast, tolerance to self is maintained by peripheral tolerance mechanisms, in which CTLA-4 signaling appears to play a major role.We are currently investigating if CTLA-4 blockade can elicit antileukemic reactivity and how the balance between autoimmunity and antitumor immunity can be modulated.

Concerning on the phenotypic characterization, there were no detectable differences in the percentages of CD4+, CD8+ and CD19+ cells. Compared to controls, CD3+ cells were decreased (70.9% vs. 56.6%), while CD56+ cells were elevated (8.4% vs. 15 .1%) in cancer-associated dermatomyositis patients, but not in primary dermatomyositis patients. The ratio of activated CD3+/ HLA-DR+ and CD3+/CD69+ cells was elevated both in cancerassociated and primary dermatomyositis cases. There was no significant difference in the ratio of Th1 cells compared to controls both in untreated and treated cancer-associated dermatomyositis patients (21.0% vs. 24.4% and 21.9%). On the other hand, significantly decreased Th1 ratio was found in active primary dermatomyositis patients (21.0% vs. 9.8%). The percentage of Th2 cells were normal in cancer-associated and in primary dermatomyositis patients as well, but it was decreased in inactive primary dermatomyositis patients compared to healthy controls. Conclusion T lymphocytes of primary dermatomyositis were less polarized towards Th1 cells, while this was not observed in cancer-associated dermatomyositis patients. Cancer-associated dermatomyositis differs from primary myositis in many aspects of clinical and immunological features. Better understanding of the precise interaction of the host immune system with the malignant disease can shed light on the association between an autoimmune disease and malignancy. Sa2.108. Bacteriophage HAP1: Molecular Basis of Its Antitumour Activity. Previously we investigated interactions of bacteriophage T4 with mammalian cells: unexpected binding of phage T4 to cancer cells and its antitumour activity. We selected in vitro the mutant HAP1 that was able to bind the cells much stronger (than parental T4), it was also more effective against B16 melanoma tumour and metastases in vivo (Dabrowska et al. Acta Virol. 48, 2004 , Dabrowska et al. Anticancer Res. 24, 2004 . We proposed a possible molecular basis of these interactions: reactions of beta3 integrins on target cells and T4 capsid proteins: probably gp24, which contain KGD-aminoacid motifs, i.e. RGD homologues able to bind beta3 receptors (Gorski et al., Medical Immunol. 2, 2003) . Here we present further results that may highlight non-antibacterial properties of phages. In direct sequencing of phage-head genes we found a non-sense mutation in the hoc gene of HAP1. Phage particle size and morphology was observed in the electron micrographs and determined by dynamic light scattering (PCS). T4 and HAP1 do not differ in their general morphology, but the head of HAP1 is smaller than the head of T4. This is in line with the well-described morphogenesis of the T4 capsid: after incorporation of Hoc protein T4 phage head becomes visibly larger. These indicate that HAP1 lacks gp Hoc. The normal Hoc protein is balloon-shaped and it extends to about 5 nm away from the capsid surface, 160 regularly arranged units per one capsid. Because of its special localisation gp Hoc impedes access of external factors to the head surface. Without gp Hoc, there are no important spatial disturbers that can diminish the interactions of other head components with any external targets. This also applies to gp 24, which was proposed as the active protein. Differences in T4 and HAP1 interactions with platelets were also observed (Kniotek et al., Immunology 2004) . This may suggest that Hoc could be involved.Hoc protein is not necessary for T4 viability nor for its structure, and its exact function is unknown. However, a very interesting report reveals its relatedness to eukaryotic immunoglobulin-like domains. This similarity results rather from divergence from a common ancestor, not just from convergent evolution (Bateman et al., Virus Genes. 14, 1997) . The immunoglobulin superfamily is engaged in adhesion processes, MHC functions, Tcell receptors, and others. On the other hand, we know that higher organisms are strongly exposed to bacteriophages. They have become ban environmentQ for phage life cycles (Dabrowska et al., J. Appl. Microbiol. 98, 2005) and, one can expect, phages adapt to them. All these considerations suggest that some bacteriophage molecules are predicted to interact with eukaryotic organisms, influencing important immunological processing and/or to modulate these interactions. Hoc protein seems to be one of these molecules. Objective: Although immune response is thought to regulate the progression of various cancers, cancers often progress by escaping from hostsT immune surveillance. In the present study, we investigated the changes in the immune status during the progression of mouse leukemia. Materials and Methods: We established a leukemia model by injecting in BALB/c mice with WEHI-3b cells intraperitoneally. Mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) every 10 days, and analyzed the cell composition by flow cytometry. Cells were separated by using magnetic microbeads-conjugated antibodies. Results and discussion: The numbers of peripheral white blood cells (most of them were leukemic cells) were dramatically increased after day 24 following injection of WEHI-3b cells, and reached 1.8Â10 5 /ml on day 30. During progression of leukemia, both dendritic cells (DCs, I-A d CD11c + ) and DX5 + CD3-cells showed marked increases in PB, although most cell types were increased. We, therefore, focused on the kinetics and functions of those two cell populations. Increased DCs expressed lower levels of I-A d than that of DCs from normal mice and had low allo T-cell stimulatory activity. In the BM of leukemic mice, only DX5 + CD3-cells were continuously increased despite the progression of leukemia, and those cells were rapidly increased in PB. The increase in DX5 + cells in BM was thought to be induced by soluble factors from leukemic cells, because co-culture of WEHI-3b cells with normal bone marrow cells in trans-wells showed a selective increase in DX5 + and CD25 + cells. The morphology of most of the circulating DX5 + cells from leukemic mice was large granular lymphocytes, and the surface markers of the cells were shown to be lineage-CD94-CD122 + CD25 + Ly-49-Thy-1 bright c-kit dim . These data suggest that those DX5 + cells were immature NK cells. Isolated circulating NK cells from leukemic mice were able to down-regulate the expression of I-A d on normal BM-derived DCs, which was possibly mediated by TGF-h produced by those cells. Moreover, these NK cells significantly suppressed the allo T-cell stimulatory activity of DCs, which required cell-to-cell contact between NK cells and DCs, and CD25 was thought to be involved. Because direct interaction between NK cells and DCs induced IL-2 production, IL-2 might be associated with the inhibitory effect. In the d90s, Thy-1 + bone marrow cells were reported to have immunoregulatory functions in bone marrow transplantation without further analyses. Immature Thy-1 + NK cells with immunosuppressive activities identified in the present study might be a population of such cells. Conclusion: We have identified circulating immature NK cells with immunosuppressive activities during the development of leukemia, which is important not only for understanding the development of the disease, but also for effective immunotherapy.
