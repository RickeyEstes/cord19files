Of 186 selected patients, half were men (Table 1) . On average, patients in the positive influenza group were younger than the negative influenza group (difference in mean, -11 years; 95% confidence interval, -20 to 1) and the positive noninfluenza group (difference in mean, -7 years; 95% confidence interval, -17 to 5). Patients in the 2 test positive groups were more likely to present with fever and cough than those who tested negative. The percentage of patients with a comorbidity was very high in all 3 groups. The percentage of patients suspected to have pneumonia based on chest radiography results was similar in all 3 groups. Seventy percent of the patients with positive results and onethird of patients with negative results were only treated in the emergency room, whereas the rest were hospitalized at the time of testing. Polymerase chain reaction test results were available on the same day for 80 (43%) of the patients and on the next day for the remaining patients. Results were available for all patients in our study prior to their discharge from hospital. Among hospitalized patients, 7 of 17 (41.2%) patients positive for influenza were empirically treated with oseltamivir antiviral prior to test result, and all of them continued the treatment given the MRVP test result (Table 2) . After a negative MRVP result, empirical oseltamivir antiviral treatment was discontinued in two-thirds (10/ 15) of the hospitalized patients. Empirical oseltamivir antiviral treatment was also discontinued in all hospitalized patients with a positive noninfluenza result. The proportions of empirical antibiotic treatment in hospitalized patients were 66.1% in patients with negative MRVP test, 70.0% in patients with positive noninfluenza, and 70.6% in patients with positive influenza. Empirical antibiotic treatment was continued in 85.4% of hospitalized patients with negative MRVP test. Empirical antibiotic treatment was discontinued in only one-quarter (ie, 3/12) of MRVP-positive hospitalized patients. When further stratifying hospitalized MRVP-positive patients according to whether they had suspected pneumonia, we found that 5 of 6 patients with suspected pneumonia continued empirical antibiotics compared with NOTE. Values are n (%) or as otherwise indicated. MRVP, multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; N/A, not applicable. *Chest radiograph results were missing for 9, 2, and 8 patients in the positive influenza, positive noninfluenza and negative categories, respectively. â€  Results were missing for 8 patients among the influenza-negative category. 4 of 6 patients with no suspected pneumonia. The high prevalence of comorbidity did not permit a stratified analysis. Most influenza-positive patients, who were not treated empirically, were highly likely to be initiated after the test results: 80% (8/10) among hospitalized patients and 85% (6/7) among emergency room patients scheduled to be admitted. Among patients with a negative MRVP test who were not empirically treated, antibiotic treatment was initiated in only 1 patient in each setting: 1 in 21 (5%) hospitalized patients and 1 in 9 (11%) emergency room patients. Among patients tested in the emergency room, 20.6% (7/34) of MRVP-positive patients were admitted compared with 78.9% (15/ 19) of MRVP-negative patients.
