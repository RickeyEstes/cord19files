The specificity and analytical sensitivity of the real-time RPA assay were analyzed (Figs.1 and 2). Using 10 ng of viral DNA, cDNA or canine genome as template, the results showed that only CPV-2a and CPV-2b were detected by the real-time RPA assay, while the other four viruses, including CDV, CCoV, CPIV and PRV, and canine genome, were not (Fig. 1, n = 5) . Thus, the realtime RPA assay results demonstrated good specificity for the detection of CPV-2. To evaluate the sensitivity of the real-time RPA method, a dilution range of 10 5 -10 0 copies/Î¼L of standard DNA was used as templates, and the real-time RPA and realtime PCR were performed simultaneously. The limit of detection of the real-time RPA was 10 1 copies ( Fig. 2a and  b) . A probit regression analysis using the results of eight complete molecular standard runs calculated that the limit of detection (LOD) of the real-time RPA was 10 1 copies per reaction in 95% of cases (Fig. 2c) , which was the same as that of the real-time PCR applied in the study (data not shown). With the data from eight runs on the quantitative DNA standards, a semi-log regression analysis for the real-time RPA and real-time PCR was made. Run times of the real-time RPA assay were about 4-12 min for 10 5 -10 1 copies, respectively (Fig. 2b) , while the real-time PCR with Ct values between 21 and 36 (data not shown) required about 32-54 min to obtain the final results. Results of the evaluation of exo RPA with clinical samples are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3 . The diagnostic performance of the real-time RPA assay to detect CPV-2 in the 91 clinical swab samples was compared to that of the real-time PCR. These two assays showed the same results (76 positive and 15 negative cases), and further analysis demonstrated that the real-time RPA had a diagnostic agreement of 100% with the real-time PCR (Table 3) . No discrepancy was found in samples (14/76) containing low levels of CPV-2 DNA (Ct > 35, real-time PCR), indicating that the established real-time RPA reliably detected low amounts of CPV-2 in clinical samples. Positive samples had real-time RPA Ct values ranging from 17.52 to 36.29, indicating that the method was able to detect CPV-2 DNA across the entire range of the assay. Twenty-three positive samples were selected randomly, and the threshold time (TT) and cycle threshold (Ct) values of real-time RPA and real-time PCR, respectively, were well correlated with an R 2 value of 0.846 (Fig. 3) . The relative sensitivity of the real-time RPA assay was further evaluated by comparing with the SNAP test. A total of 30 fecal swab samples were collected for this experiment. Twenty-four of the above tested clinical samples displayed CPV-2 positive, six of them were CPV-2 negative by real-time PCR assay. The result showed that the SNAP test was able to detect CPV antigen in 16/30 (53.3%) of analyzed samples. A higher detection rate (24/ 30, 80%) was obtained using real-time RPA for CPV-2 DNA. The relative sensitivity of the SNAP test was 66.7% (16/24) , when compared to real-time RPA. The best correlation was observed again between conventional realtime PCR and real-time RPA analysis (shown in the Additional file 1: Table S1 ). The detection results of the swab samples showed that the real-time RPA method we developed was effective in detecting CPV-2.
