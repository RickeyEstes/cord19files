Nineteen volunteers, 10 male, 9 female, aged between 21 and 38 years, participated in this study. Three subjects (two with suit B, one with suit A) who terminated the study before the end of the task series were included in the analyses of tasks in which they have participated. Two of them terminated due to indication of score 10 on the assessment sheet after series 4 (paranasal sinus obstruction) and after series 5 (hunger) on the first study day at 22˚C. These subjects continued the study on study day two at 28˚C. One subject assigned to suit B resigned from the study after the task series at 22˚C not because of physical stress but without giving reason.
