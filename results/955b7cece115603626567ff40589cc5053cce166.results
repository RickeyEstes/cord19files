The calves used in the present study were exposed to a lower level of stress compared to typical weaned and receiver calves experiencing a multitude of co-mingling, handling and transport stressors. The verified TP incidence in these calves was thus not unexpectedly comparatively low at 14% (9 out of 65 animals show- (1) side panels, (2) two bowl water system, (3) extension panels, (4) viewing windows, (5) antennaek (6) RFID control modules, (7) electromagnetic, shielding (8) infrared camera on motor mount within enclosure, (9) instrumentation cabinet. ing a gold standard value of 3 or 4/4). Of interest, however, was the observation that none of these calves were identified as suspect for BRD using subjective clinical signs and none of these animals were deemed to be in need of treatment nor removed for treatment by the animal managers or pen checkers during the study. A total of 44 of the calves displayed TN values (gold standard values of 0 or 1/4) and a further 12 animals displayed intermediate values (gold score value of 2/4) for BRD incidence. The calves typically would visit the water station between 1 and 5 times per day. The amount of time spent at the water station by any individual varied but again typically twenty or more thermal images were captured per animal per day. The overall average orbital maximum temperature for all calves for the 3 week period was 33.85°C ± 0.66 (SD). For this same period, the average for the orbital maximum for the TP calves was 35.44°C ± 0.58 and for the TN calves was 34.71°C ± 0.57 (P < 0.01; Table 1 ). Since daily thermal values for all animals were monitored, it was possible to follow the radiated temperature rise for the TP calves to the point at which a peak temperature occurred (Table 3 and Fig. 3 ). The peak thermal response for the TP calves as monitored by the thermal station was 35.7°C. The 12 calves displaying intermediate values (a gold standard score of 2 out of 4) showed an average orbital IRT value of 34.9 ± 0.2°C which was not significantly different from the TN calves but was significantly lower than the TP peak values (P < 0.01). Of interest in the present study was the observation that nine of the calves developed BRD signs during the study period and for these animals it was possible to automatically and non-invasively follow the thermal radiated response up to the time of peak thermal response and BRD onset. These data showed that there was over a 1°C elevation in temperature for the TP calves over this time. This contrasts to a flat or basically zero average daily change in temperature for the entire group of animals of À0.07 ± 0.27°C/day. The data for the mean ratios (MR. Table 1) in general paralleled the orbital maximum values. In terms of biological values, compared to the TN animals the TP calves (Table 1 ) displayed higher core temperature values, white blood cell counts, clinical scores and serum cortisol values (P < 0.01) with trends towards a higher value in neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios. These values for the intermediate calves were 39.4 ± 0.73°C, 9.589 ± 2.075 Â 10 3 /lL, 3.5 ± 1.3, 0.086 ± 0.066 and 135.3 ± 45.3 lmol/L for core temperatures, white blood cell counts, clinical scores, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and serum cortisol, respectively. With respect to specific differential counts the TP calves displayed a lower neutrophil count and a higher lymphocyte count, as well as a slight increase in red blood cell numbers (P < 0.05) ( Table 4) . Salivary cortisol displayed a greater variation among animals and thus there were no statistically significant differences in salivary cortisol values among the groups. The calculation of predictive index values for optimal cut off values, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, test sensitivity and test specificity are shown in Table 2 . Again, these values were calculated using ROC analysis. The collected data may also be used to estimate test efficiency. In the current study, the test efficiency for the IRT max values was 93% which was as high as any test used. In terms of seroprevalence the average and range of titres for IBR and BVD were <1:6 (range 1:0-1:19) and 1:452 (range <1:6-1:2916), respectively. For the PI3, BRSV and Coronavirus these values were 28 (range 0-68), 19 (range 0-64) and 56 (range 7-95). Most of the calves displayed a low to moderate titre to one or more viruses. In terms of seroconversion, higher values were seen for the true positive (TP) calves. Thirty-three percent of the TP animals seroconverted (>20 units) to BVD virus, 11% to IBR, 0% to BRSV, 11% to PI3 and 11% to corona virus. By contrast in the true negative animals a lower extent of seroconversion was seen. Twenty-two percent seroconverted to BVD, 0% to IBR, 5% to BRSV, 0% to PI3 and 5% to Coronavirus. The data suggest that the BRD viruses measured may have played some significant role in the onset of BRD in the TP animals.
