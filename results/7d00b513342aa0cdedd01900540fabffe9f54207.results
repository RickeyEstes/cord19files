Multiple test procedures were used to examine the interdependencies between typical aviation materials and the substances tested. The LHT Central Laboratories provide services to perform the tests in its chemical and metallographic laboratories and also according to specific standards of Lufthansa, Boeing, Airbus, American Standard Methods (ASTM), etc. They tested effects on aircraft materials such as metal, glass, electric conduits, synthetics, leather, and fabric seat covers, windows, and monitors. All disinfectants are approved by the airline engineering and can be used on the Lufthansa fleet. Gathered results deviating from common aircraft manuals, for example, the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM), are documented in the LHT Standard Practices Manual (SPM), which is mandatory for the Lufthansa fleet and, if accepted, for clients. With regard to the SOPs, different procedures are defined and reduced to simple, reproducible processes [14] . The following procedures were developed and already implemented within the Lufthansa fleet by: 4 integration into manuals for cockpit crews 4 information 4 on notification procedures to air traffic control and operational control center (OCC), 4 for cabin crews, 4 for passengers, 4 for Health Protection Authorities at Port of Destination (POD) or Port of Entry (POE), 4 on products and generics, 4 for disinfectors, 4 for aircraft maintenance and ground personnel, and 4 for release to service (RTS). The above-mentioned procedures are available at Lufthansa destinations worldwide, published in the Station Emergency Reaction Plan (SERP). The SOPs are available in a document on board DLH aircrafts (available for technical/expert groups (see [14] or via QR code/link as shown in . Fig. 1) ).
