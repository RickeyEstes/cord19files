Characteristics of the study population. Table 1 shows the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 219 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients at the time of liver biopsy. Regarding liver biopsy, 49.8% had significant fibrosis (F ≥ 2), 52.6% had moderate necroinflammatory activity (A ≥ 2), and 15.3% had alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 150 IU/L. Mx1 and OAS1-3 polymorphisms. Table 2 shows the characteristics of SNPs, which displayed missing values < 5% and were in HWE (p > 0.05). When SNPs frequencies in HIV/HCV coinfected patients were compared to the SNPs frequencies in healthy subjects from the IBS, we only found differences between groups for Mx1 rs469390 AA (p = 0.011) and Mx1 rs469390 AG (p = 0.036) genotypes. Association between Mx1 and OAS1-3 polymorphisms and liver disease. Table 3 shows the relationship of Mx1 and OAS1-3 polymorphisms with severity of liver disease under a model of additive inheritance, which was the genetic model that best fitted our data. The trend of having significant fibrosis (F ≥ 2) was lower in patients carrying of OAS2 rs1293762 A allele (p = 0.023). The trend of having moderate activity grade (A ≥ 2) was higher in patients carrying Mx1 rs464397 C allele (p = 0.015) and Mx1 rs469390 G allele (p = 0.003); while it was lower in patients carrying OAS1 rs2285934 A allele (p = 0.026), OAS2 rs1293762 A allele (p = 0.002), and it was nearly significant for OAS3 rs2010604 C allele (p = 0.095). Moreover, the likelihood of having significant fibrosis (F ≥ 2) in liver biopsy was lower in patients carrying OAS2 rs1293762 A allele [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.51; p = 0.040]. Besides, the likelihood of having moderate activity grade (A ≥ 2) was higher in patients carrying Mx1 rs464397 C allele (aOR = 1.63; p = 0.028) and Mx1 rs469390 G allele (aOR = 1.97; p = 0.005), while it was lower in patients carrying OAS1 rs2285934 A allele (aOR = 0.64; p = 0.039) and OAS2 rs1293762 A allele (aOR = 0.41; p = 0.009). Figure 1 shows the relation between MX1 and OAS1-3 genetic polymorphisms and serum ALT. We found that patients carrying Mx1 rs464397 CC genotype and Mx1 rs469390 GG genotype had higher values of serum ALT and percentage of patients with ALT ≥ 150 IU/L. However, we did not find any significant association in multivariate regression analysis (data not shown). Moreover, we also analyzed the relation between MX1 and OAS1-3 polymorphisms and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), but we did not find any association (data not shown). Table 4 shows the relationship among haplotype of Mx1 gene (rs464397, rs458582, rs469390) and OAS1-3 cluster (rs2285934, rs2285933, rs2010604, rs739903, rs1293762) and severity of liver disease. The likelihood of having moderate activity grade (A ≥ 2) in liver biopsy was higher in patients with Mx1 CTG haplotype (aOR = 1.44; p < 0.001) and lower in patients with Mx1 CTA haplotype (aOR = 0.62; p = 0.007). Moreover, the likelihood of having moderate activity grade (A ≥ 2) in liver biopsy was lower in patients with OAS1-3 AGCTA haplotype (aOR = 0.78; p = 0.008).
