Between December 13, 2002 and May 6, 2003, 102 patients were hospitalized 105 times for an exacerbation of COPD and 50 (49%) patients met enrollment criteria. Twenty-four (24%) patients were excluded since they did not have a nasopharyngeal specimen obtained during the first five hospital days, 18 (18%) patients were excluded since no remaining nasopharyngeal specimen was available for hMPV testing and 10 (10%) patients were excluded since their nasopharyngeal specimen was deemed inadequate for DFA testing. hMPV was identified in 6 of 50 (12%, CI 5e24%) patients, RSV in 4 (8%, CI 2e19%), influenza A in 2 (4%, CI 1e14%) and parainfluenza type 3 in 1 (2%, CI 0e11%) patient. The remaining 37 (74%) were negative for RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus and hMPV. All 10 specimens deemed inadequate for DFA testing were negative for hMPV by RTePCR. No patient was identified with more than one virus. No significant differences in the demographic or clinical characteristics were noted between the hospitalized acute exacerbation of COPD patients identified with or without evidence for hMPV infection. However, patients with hMPV associated acute exacerbations were more frequently febrile (>38 C) during their hospitalization ( Table 1) . All of the patients with hMPV were hospitalized between December 25, 2002 and April 3, 2003 ( Fig. 1) and noted a change in the character of their cough, sputum production and level of dyspnea, consistent with an accepted definition of an acute exacerbation of COPD. 15 These patients all received supportive care, broad spectrum antibiotics, systemic steroids and supplemental oxygen during their hospitalization. Three of the six patients with hMPV had evidence for a lower respiratory tract infection by the presence of a new infiltrate on chest radiograph (patients 2, 5 and 6). A urine Legionella antigen test was performed for one patient (patient 6) and was negative. Gram stain and culture was performed on sputa available from three patients (patients 1, 2 and 3) and failed Data for some variables were not available from all enrolled patients. SD, standard deviation. n.s., not significant (P > 0.5). a Type 1 exacerbations were defined as the occurrence of increased dyspnea, sputum production and cough. A Type 2 exacerbation is defined as the presence of 2 of these 3 symptoms and a Type 3 exacerbation is defined as the presence of one of these 3 symptoms along with at least one of the following: upper respiratory tract signs or symptoms during the preceding 5 days, fever, increased wheezing, tachypnea, or tachycardia. 15 to reveal any potential bacterial pathogens. No patient identified with hMPV was diagnosed or suspected of having an acute bacterial respiratory infection during the period of hospitalization. Among the acute exacerbation of COPD patients without evidence for hMPV, sputum Gram stain and culture were performed for 42% and urine Legionella tests were obtained from two patients. Bacterial diagnoses of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae infection were each made in one of the 44 patients. Four of the six patients with hMPV clinically improved after the initial 48 h of hospitalization as reflected by the decreased use of supplemental oxygen. Two patients with hMPV-associated acute exacerbations of COPD required mechanical ventilation. One patient received non-invasive mask ventilation, clinically improved and was discharged after 3 days of hospital care. The other patient had a history of severe COPD (FEV 1 of 0.56 L/s measured 7 years prior to this admission) and required invasive mechanical ventilation for 3 days due to hypoxic, hypercapneic respiratory failure. This patient slowly improved and was discharged home after a total 16 days hospitalization. Inadequate pulmonary function testing data was available to allow reliable comparison between the hMPV and non-hMPV groups. Phylogenetic analysis using hMPV F Gene nucleotide sequences showed that the exacerbations of COPD were associated with both recognized hMPV genotypes (Fig. 2) . 16 52 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 sequences revealed a total of 21 single nucleotide substitution sites within the 120 nucleotide F gene segment from the six hMPV isolates; 19 of these 21 sites were located in the third codon position. One codon contained substitutions in both the first and third position, but neither polymorphism encoded for an amino acid change. There was 97.5% deduced amino acid sequence homology between A and B genotypes for this F gene segment.
