Experience of the consultant anaesthetists ranged from 1 year post fellowship to 20 years. The level of training of the trainees ranged from first year to final year in the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists training system. Table 2 shows that none of the three types of PPE had a significant effect on the ability to perform tracheal intubation in the manikin with the different intubation techniques. The intubating laryngeal mask airway and fibreoptic intubation using the eyepiece both provided the longest intubation times. These times are significantly longer than direct laryngoscopy and fibreoptic intubation using the video screen. There were no oesophageal intubations; however, there were four endobronchial intubations. One was associated with direct laryngoscopy while wearing the control PPE. The other three cases occurred with control PPE, PPE 1 and PPE 2, respectively, using the intubating laryngeal mask. The study size was insufficient to show any statistical difference in the incidence of endobronchial intubation. Table 3 shows the results to the questionnaire at the completion of the study. Sixty-seven percent of subjects recorded that PPE 2 generally provided the most comfort for all types of intubation, while the same percentage of subjects rated PPE 1 as having the worst. Numerous comments from the subjects highlighted the uncomfortable environment that PPE 1 produced, with most subjects sweating while wearing the water-resistant surgical gown and face shield despite the air-conditioned environment (23 â€¢ C and 55% relative humidity) in which the study took place. The face shield in PPE 1 often became fogged especially during longer intubation techniques. Subjects frequently needed to adjust their head into different positions to maintain visibility. The positive pressure produced by the Dustmaster TM device in PPE 2 appeared to protect against fogging. Other issues apart from the level of comfort using PPE included the following: 1. All PPE devices produced problems when using the bronchoscopic eyepiece. The distance between the eyes of the subject and the bronchoscopic eyepiece meant that the participants needed to move their head across the eyepiece to view the entire image. 2. One subject found that the combination of bifocal eyeglasses, PPE 1 and the bronchoscopic eyepiece produced difficult conditions for intubation. Frequent adjustment of the visual axis was necessary to obtain the optimal image. 3. Another subject wearing glasses for myopia found PPE 1 and the bronchoscopic eyepiece difficult for intubation, finding the visual image poorly focused. 4. Reflections from the back of the face shield proved to be troublesome with PPE 1 by two subjects. 5. Two subjects noted that the noise from the battery-powered pump in the Dustmaster TM in PPE 2 made it difficult to hear instructions from personnel directing them to the various intubation stations.
