Among the variables contained in the information collected in the visits to the farms (flock size, type of facilities, type of breeding, lambing percentage, organization of lambing periods, cleaning of lambing areas and accumulation of lambs in the pens) only the three later were significantly related to lamb mortality. The number of farms with high and low lamb mortality according to the magnitude (under or above average values) of milk and blood variables, together with the values for OR, Ï‡ 2 and statistical significance appear in Table 1 Statistical results from the comparison between the number of farms with high and low lamb mortality and the categories (under or above average values) of some variables involved in outbreaks of lamb scouring in the region of "La Serena" (Southwest Spain) Positive correlations were found between the individual values of gamma globulin and serum total protein in lambs (R = 0.728, P = 0.012), between the individual levels of gamma globulin in ewes and their lambs (R = 0.670, P = 0.033) and between serum gamma globulin in lambs and serum total protein in ewes (R = 0.632, P = 0.027). The most relevant microbiological findings obtained from the clinical reports of previous scouring occurrences in the same farms were: E. coli isolated in all the farms, Cryptosporidium spp. frequently isolated, C. jejuni only isolated in one farm and Rotavirus spp., Coronavirus spp. and Salmonella spp. not detected.
