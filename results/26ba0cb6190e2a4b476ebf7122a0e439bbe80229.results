Screening of miRNAs targeting TfR mRNA 3′UTR As described in Materials and Methods, small RNA ultrahigh throughput sequencing was performed (Solexa) on uninfected F81 cells and following MEV infection (MOI = 1) to detect miRNAs targeting TfR 3′UTR. Two miRNA libraries were also constructed [34] . Screening for miRNAs with RNAhybrid [30] , RegRNA [31] and TargetScan tools identified 6 miRNA candidates (Figure 1 ). To test these miRNAs, F81 cells were transfected with the miRNA mimics and inhibitors, negative control (NC) mimics and inhibitors as controls. After 36 h, TfR mRNAs were quantified by qPCR. Results showed that miR-320a and miR140 mimics decreased TfR mRNA levels by almost 30% compared to NC mimics, and miR-320a inhibitors increased them approximately 25% (Figure 2A ). After 48 h transfection as above, the quantity of TfR proteins were also examined by western blot and flow cytometry. Results showed that miR-320a and miR-140 downregulated the protein level ( Figure 2B ) and the percentage of TfR-positive cells by almost 20% and 30% respectively ( Figure 2C ). To further confirm the activity of the mimics, qPCR and western blot assay were used to show that the expression levels of TfR were reduced in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1D,E) . Altogether, these results clearly show that cellular miR-320a and miR-140 have negative effects on TfR expression.
