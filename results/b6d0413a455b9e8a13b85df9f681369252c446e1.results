Hereafter, we consistently use the "week since the last case" as defined by the number of weeks that have elapsed since the purported last case testing negative twice or burial (Table S1 ). Using the baseline parameter values including p = 0.0012 in Table 1 , the probability of observing additional cases lowered 5% at 19, 37 and 28 weeks since the last case in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, respectively; these time points varied by country due to the different sizes and shapes of the epidemic curves. Considering that the WHO criteria imposes 6 weeks to wait since the last case, the suggested lengths of our proposed method were 13, 31 and 22 weeks longer than the WHO, but all those events were successfully captured within the waiting time (Table S3 ). The first recrudescent case was reported in week 17, 14, 16 since the last case in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, respectively. It should be noted that the last observed actual recrudescent event in Guinea was in the week 20, and the gap period between the last observed recrudescence and the week of the end derived from our model (week 19) was only 1 week ( Fig. 1 A) . In addition, the gap period between the last declaration (week 25) and the calculated end of the epidemic from our model (week 28) was 3 weeks in Sierra Leone ( Fig. 1 E) . The purported last case reported in week 34 in Liberia before the second declaration was 3 weeks earlier than our suggested week (week 37) in Fig. 1 C. It appears that the extent of sexual transmission among the total secondary transmission events had a profound impact on the waiting period before declaring the end of the epidemic ( Fig. 1 ). If as many as 10% of secondary transmission events were attributed to sexual contact, it may be necessary to wait 55-81 weeks (i.e., approximately 1 year) from the purported last case to declaring the end of the Ebola epidemic. It is clear that the mean length of virus persistence also plays a role ( Fig. 1 B,D and F) , but qualitatively, the extent of sexual transmission had a greater impact on the waiting period. As the proportion of sexual transmission among all secondary transmission events influences the probability of observing additional cases, individual's behavior regarding unprotected sex would impact on the waiting period ( Fig. 2 ) . This effect is particularly visible if the extent of sexual transmission is substantial ( Fig. 2 B , D and F). For example, in Sierra Leone, the waiting period between the last case and declaring the end of the epidemic was 28 weeks without any interventions to avoid unprotected sex (i.e., u = 0). However, this time period can be reduced by 14 weeks if 80% of people avoid risky sexual contact ( Fig. 2 E) . This indicates that the length of time that must elapse before declaring the end of an Ebola epidemic is highly dependent on sexual behavior. Fig. 3 examines the extent of the impact of under-ascertainment on the declaration of the end of an epidemic. As the extent of under-ascertainment is magnified by the factor of 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9, a country has to endure considerably longer waiting times to ensure that an epidemic is over (e.g. it was 19 weeks since the last case in Guinea with p = 0.0012 and q = 0.5, but it can vary from week 14 to 33 with q = 0.1 and 0.9). However, with an ascertainment rate of 10%, the impact was less than that observed with a weight of p = 0.1 (with 10% of secondary transmission events attributed to sexual transmission) in Fig. 2 . In Fig. 4 , the probability of observing additional cases is examined using the average R f over the most recent 24 weeks, and the probability is compared against R f = 0.5 and 1.5. The sensitivity of the waiting time to R f varied by country due to different epidemic curves, e.g., in Liberia, there were a greater number of recent cases before the purported last case than in the other two countries, and thus, there was more variation in the week in which the end of the epidemic was declared. Fig. 4 B,D and F compare our suggested week of declaration of the end of an epidemic against those adhering to the WHO criteria for all possible opportunities for declaration. In observation, declarations of the end were made twice in Guinea and Sierra Leone and four times in Liberia. Guinea declared the end of the epidemic 6 weeks after the first purported last case being buried, and subsequently, declared 28 weeks after the first purported last case testing negative twice. Liberia declared 6, 23, 42 and 63 weeks after the first purported last case testing negative twice for all possible declarations. Sierra Leone declared in weeks 6 and 25 after the first purported last case testing negative twice. Considering Week 0 of the epidemic to have commenced on 15 September 2014, the first purported last case was buried in Week 27 in Liberia and tested negative twice in Weeks 61 and 53 in Guinea and Sierra Leone, respectively. For the first declaration in all three countries, our method proposed longer waiting periods than the 42-day wait recommended by the WHO criteria. However, during the later opportunities for declaration, our method proposed earlier declaration times than those based on the WHO criteria due to the low chance of secondary transmission. We implemented random simulations of the epidemic since the purported last case, validating our proposed method. Given the absence of recrudescence during the waiting period, the probability of observing at least one additional case after declaration was below 4.9% and 1.3%, respectively, for all combinations of parameters Vertical axis measures the probability of observing additional cases on or after the specified week, while the horizontal axis measures the weeks since the last case was buried or tested negative twice to Ebola virus. Panels A, C and E examines the sensitivity of the probability to the reproduction number around the end of the epidemic. We used the reproduction numbers during the late stage of the epidemic, taking weighted means using case counts for weighting, dating back for 24 weeks from the week in which the last case was reported. Of the two types of vertical lines, the solid line represents the week in which the end of the epidemic was declared, following a 42-day waiting period as specified by the WHO. The dashed vertical line represents the week in which a recrudescent case was recognized after the first erroneous declaration. The horizontal dashed line measures the probability at 5% below which one may regard that the epidemic is over. Panels B, D and F measure the sensitivity of the probability to different timings at which the last case was observed.
