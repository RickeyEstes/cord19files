No housing-related differences in food consumption or weight gain were observed (Table 1) . Similar feed efficiencies suggested similar energy expenditure between groups. Fecal output and fecal fibre content over the 2 week balance phase were also not affected by housing. While dry weight fecal outputs were not significantly different, bedding material was present in the insoluble fraction derived from feces indicating that the rats housed on bedding ingested this material (Fig.1) . No differences in the levels of serum enzymes normally associated with liver pathology were observed. Blood urea nitrogen values were also similar between housing groups (Table 1 ). The proportion of fecal SCFA corresponding to acetic acid was significantly higher in beddinghoused rats. On the other hand, the proportion of propionic, isobutyric, valeric and isovaleric acids was significantly lower (Fig. 2) . No differences in butyric acid were observed.
