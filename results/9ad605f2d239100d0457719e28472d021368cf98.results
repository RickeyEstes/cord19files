Though it is not shown in Fig. 3 , the peak came 2 years after the initial case was exposed, and the total number of patients reached about 17 million. Needless to say, if some intervention policy were to be implemented the course of Starting day of intervention is defined as the number of days from the day that the initial-exposure case was exposed prevalence would be affected and control may be achieved by adopting appropriate countermeasures such as quarantine and vaccination. Table 3 summarizes the results for mass vaccination. Table 4 shows the results for ring vaccination. Each Table has 24 patterns of combinations of different R 0 values, and shows the number of initial-exposure cases, and the starting date of intervention. The numbers of patients in Tables 3  and 4 indicate the estimated numbers of patients 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after the initial case was exposed, and the necessary number of vaccination shots to be given. In general, comparing Table 3 and Table 4 , the total number of patients in the ring-vaccination scenario is smaller than that in the mass vaccination scenario for all patterns. Mass vaccination needs almost 30 million vaccine doses. Conversely, the necessary number of vaccine doses for ring vaccination is much smaller than that required for mass vaccination. If there is a larger number of initial cases, higher R 0 , and later start of intervention by the public health authority, more than 24 million vaccine doses are necessary. In such a scenario, mass vaccination is preferable to ring vaccination. Number of patients (3 months/6 months/1 year) indicates the estimated number of patients at 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year after the initial case was exposed Figure 5 illustrates the movement of the cumulative number of patients in the mass vaccination scenario where, R 0 ϭ 1.5, and where the number of initial-exposure cases is 1000. It clearly shows that the total number of patients would reach 14 000 if intervention was delayed. Even if the public health authority could start intervention within 30 days after the initial case was exposed, the total number of patients would exceed 5000. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 6 , ring vaccination can dramatically reduce the total number of patients. Namely, even in the worst case of delay, the total number of patients would be lower than 7000. If the public authority could start intervention within 30 days and it adopted ring vaccination, the total number of patients may be constrained to less than 2500. Therefore, we can conclude that ring vaccination is more effective when R 0 ϭ 1.5 and the number of initial-exposure cases is 1000. Figure 7 shows such relationships in more detail. The upper areas of the declining lines indicate that for the combination of R 0 and number of initial-exposure cases, mass vaccination is more effective than ring vaccination. The blue line indicates the combination in the scenario in which the starting date of intervention is 30 days after the initial case was exposed. The pink line and yellow line indicate the combinations for 45 and 60 days, respectively. Obviously, Number of patients (3 months/6 months/1 year) indicates the estimated number of patients at 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year after the initial case was exposed Fig. 5 . Cumulative number of patients in the mass-vaccination scenario (R 0 ϭ 1.5, number of initial-exposed cases ϭ 1000) the later the intervention starts, the wider the area on the graph would be where mass vaccination is more effective. For instance, if the R 0 value is 9 and the number of initialexposure cases is more than ten, mass vaccination would be more effective.
