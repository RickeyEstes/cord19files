. Response to challenge (Table I) All cats given the two larger doses of FIPV (subgroups A and B) developed clinical signs of FIP; the diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of tissues after death. Five of six cats given the smallest challenge dose (0' 5 per cent liver homogenate, subgroup C) remained healthy while the sixth, which had been vaccinated with ccv sub-signs of FIP and remained healthy throughout the course of the experiment. developed extremely low VN titres that were first detected two weeks after vaccination. These tit res rose only marginally during the succeeding two weeks but were boosted to high levels by the second vaccination, reaching a plateau at a mean value of 1/125. Neutralising antibody titres in individual cats remained relatively stable after FIPV challenge. Shamvaccinated cats (groups 3 and 4) were consistently negative in ccv VN tests I before FIPV challenge. Extremely low levels of heterotypic VN antibody were detected terminally in only the two subgroup C cats after the second, lethal challenge. Cross-reacting antibodies to TGEV were not detected in any cat until after lethal FIPV challenge (Fig 2) . A rapid and dramatic rise in KELA titres occurred in aerosol-vaccinated cats (group I) after challenge, perhaps reflecting the production of nonneutralising antibody (Barlough et aI1984b) . The two cats that survived the lowest FIPV challenge dose (subgroup C) did not develop KELA titres until after the second,lethal challenge. Antibodies to TGEV were detected in only two subcutaneously vaccinated cats (group 2) after challenge (the one surviving subgroup C cat developed KELA titres only after the second, lethal FIPV challenge). Several cats given subcutaneous inoculations developed elevated background reactivity in their serum as detected by KELA; such reactivity has been associated previously with humoral immune responses to extraneous, noncoronaviral components of cell culture medium (Barlough et al 1984a) . All sham-vaccinated cats (groups 3 and 4) remained negative by KELA after FIPV challenge. Sentinel room control cats were seronegative in both assays throughout the course of the experiment (data not shown).
