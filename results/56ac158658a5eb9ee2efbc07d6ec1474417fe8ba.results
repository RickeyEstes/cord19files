Prevalence of respiratory pathogens in nasal aspiration and pleural effusion positive samples The identification of the main respiratory agents in nasal aspiration and pleural effusion samples of children hospitalised for severe pneumonia was performed using a sensitive multiplex real-time molecular assay. In nasal aspiration samples, rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses and human metapneumovirus were found as the main respiratory pathogens (table 2) . Bacterial agents were found in 80% of the pleural effusion samples whereas 20% remained undiagnosed. A pathogen discovery protocol based on random RT-PCR was performed on the five negative pleural effusion samples, and several short sequences related to TTMV were obtained for three of them. The characterisation of TTMV required the amplification and sequencing of the full-length virus genome. Betatorquevirus-specific inverse PCR was performed and the corresponding TTMV-LY genomes were amplified. The TTMV-LY genomes were composed of 2912 bp, 2979 bp and 2915 bp for TTMV-LY1, -LY2 and -LY3, respectively. Using PCR, the TTMV-LY genomes found in pleural effusion samples were also identified in the corresponding nasal aspiration sample for each patient. Among the three patients for whom the pleural effusion samples were only positive for TTMV, two were male and one was female. They were aged 48 months, 7 months and 37 months for TTMV-LY1, -LY2 and -LY3, respectively, and presented the same clinical features as the other patients of the cohort. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out on the nucleotide sequence of predictive open reading frame (ORF)1, as recommended by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [5] . Based on the phylogenetic tree ( fig. 1 ), all three new isolates of TTMV-LY belong to genogroup I and are related to previously identified TGP96 (64% of maximum identity) and Pt-TTV8-II (44% of maximum identity) isolates. TTMV-LY isolates possess at least three ORFs: one major ORF1 composed of 673, 667 and 659 amino acids (aa) for TTMV-LY1, -LY2 and -LY3, respectively, and several overlapping ORFs. The TTMV-LY1 and -LY3 have two overlapping ORFs of 91 and 101 aa, and 97 and 129 aa, respectively, as opposed to TTMV-LY2, which has ORFs of 100 and 109 aa, and an additional ORF3 of 113 aa. One other feature of these viruses is the highly conserved 59-untranslated region (UTR), as shown in figure 2 . Figure 2a shows that TTMV-LY2 possesses a significant insertion in this 59-UTR, forming a predictive secondary structure of RNA sequence ( fig. 2b ). This structure appeared to be capable of forming a stable loop-and-dimer structure.
