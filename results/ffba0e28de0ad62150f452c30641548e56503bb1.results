Variables in boosted regression tree models. After factoring out reporting effort (in the weighted model), evergreen broadleaf trees (median 7.6% of the model's predictive power), human population density (6.9%), Global Environmental Stratification (climate) (5.9%), and mammal species richness (an aspect of biodiversity) (5.6%) had the largest relative influence over the distribution of EID events (Fig. 1) . Across 1000 iterations of the model, no variables consistently emerged as much stronger predictors than others but an average ranking of predictor importance could be derived. Of the top predictors, evergreen broadleaf trees (representing tropical rainforests) exhibited an overall positive trend, human population density an overall negative trend, the Global Environmental Stratification (climate) Low High High Low a b Fig. 3 Heat maps of predicted relative risk distribution of zoonotic EID events. a shows the predicted distribution of new events being observed (weighted model output with current reporting effort); b shows the estimated risk of event locations after factoring out reporting bias (weighted model output reweighted by population). See Fig. 4 for raw weighted model output. Maps were created using standard deviation scaling, with the color palette scaled to 2.5 s.d. above and below the mean an idiosyncratic trend towards warmer and wetter (i.e., more tropical) climates, and mammal species richness showed an idiosyncratic trend, with higher risk values at lower and particularly higher richness values (Fig. 2) . After mammal species richness, three variables involving agricultural practices followed in importance: cultivated/managed vegetation (5.6%), pasture change (5.2%), and areas dedicated to pasture (5.1%). In the unweighted model, which did not account for reporting effort (Supplementary Note 3), urban/built-up land was by far the strongest predictor of observed events, explaining a median of 30.6% of the model's variation and exhibiting a distinct positive trend. Global distribution of EID risk index. Relative to the observed risk index for EID events, the model's estimated risk index correcting for reporting bias (Fig. 3 with an empirical 90% confidence interval ranging from 0.54 to 0.69 (out of possible values between 0 and 1, with 0.5 indicating performance no better than random). The median True Skill Statistic (TSS) was 0.23 with an empirical 90% CI of 0.14 to 0.33 (out of a range of âˆ’1 to 1). These indicate low to moderate predictive performance [13] [14] [15] . Evaluated against an unweighted null, the weighted model had a median AUC of 0.78 (90% CI (0.75, 0.81)) and a median TSS of 0.43 (90% CI (0.37, 0.50)). The unweighted model evaluated against to an unweighted null, had a median AUC of 0.77 (90% CI (0.73, 0.81)) and a median TSS of 0.44 (90% CI (0.37, 0.50)).
