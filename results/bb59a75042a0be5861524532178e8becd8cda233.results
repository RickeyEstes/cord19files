Through a computerized search using 3 electronic databases, altogether 42 potentially eligible records were retrieved and at the same time 5 additional ones were obtained by screening the reference lists of relevant articles. However, 13 apparently unqualified ones were first removed by evaluating the titles and abstracts. Subsequently another 17 literatures were excluded by screening full texts of remaining records. The article search process as well as reasons for inclusion and exclusion was listed in Fig. 1 in detail. Eventually, 17 [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] studies were considered to be eligible for this systematic review, 16 [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] of which were published in English and only 1 [22] was published in Chinese. Next, we extracted 3 types of useful data from included studies and imported them into different tables: basic information of included publications (Table 1) ; technological details of extracorporeal shockwave therapy ( Table 2 ) and therapeutic effect assessment indexes of included studies ( Table 3) . As for the study design, 2 [15, 28] were case reports, 9 [13, 14, 16, [22] [23] [24] [25] 27, 29] were open label trials, 2 [20, 26] were cohorts, and 4 [17] [18] [19] 24] were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Twelve [13, 14, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [23] [24] [25] 27] studies were prospective ones and 5 [15, 22, 26, 28, 29] were retrospective ones. All patients were diagnosed with ONFH. Fourteen [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] articles provided the energy intensity of ESWT, all of which exceeded 0.18 mj/mm 2 and 9 were 0.62 mj/mm 2 . The patient population of these studies ranged from 1 to 335. Eleven [13, 15, 16, 20, [22] [23] [24] [26] [27] [28] [29] studies only investigated the effect of extracorporeal shockwave, 4 [14, 17, 19, 25] compared the performance of ESWT with operations (jointpreserving surgeries or endoprosthetic replacement of joint) and 2 [18, 21] compared the effect of ESWT with cocktail therapy (ESWT combined with other noninvasive modalities). Sixteen [13] [14] [15] [16] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] studies presented the visual analog scale (VAS) and/or Harris hip score before and after the treatment as evaluation indicators. Other outcome assessment indexes provided by these literatures included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), the 12item Short Form (SF-12) Survey, magnetic resonance imaging manifestation, the need for surgical intervention as well as numbers of patients with improved, stable and deteriorating conditions.
