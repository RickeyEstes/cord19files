By real-time RT-PCR, CDV infection was confirmed in both animals at the day of recovery. In animal A, all the collected samples tested positive for CDV, while in dog B CDV was detected only in urine and rectal swab. Sample from both animals tested negative for other viral pathogens. Based on the RT-PCR genotyping, the CDV strains were characterized as Arctic genotype. Real-time RT-PCR was used to screen all the collected samples. Dog A was found to shed virus in all the samples with consistently higher viral RNA load in urine, rectal, nasal and conjunctival swabs (Table 1) . Moreover, all the samples tested positive for CDV at all the sampling times, with a virus load higher than 1.06 × 10 4 RNA copies/L of template 37 days after hospitalization. Dog B was consistently positive for CDV in urine samples until 50 days after hospitalization (Table 1) . Peaks in viral loads were recorded from 10 to 22 days after hospitalization with a mean titer of 1.47 × 10 4 RNA copies/l of template. In the remaining observation period, the mean viral load detected in urine was 7.22 × 10 2 RNA copies/l of template. Interestingly, rectal swabs resulted consistently positive from 1 to 36 days of hospitalization with the highest viral load (5.71 × 10 4 RNA copies/l of template) detected at day 10. Blood, nasal and conjunctival swabs of dog B tested negative at hospitalization. The virus was detected only occasionally and with low viral titer in the first month, while it was no longer detected after the 32nd day of hospitalization.
