A total of 35 questionnaires were completed and returned (65% of 54 distributed). Seventeen respondents were male (49%) and 18 were female (51%). All the students were between the ages of 20-29 years and none of them had ever performed either chest compressions or mouth-to-mouth ventilation in a real resuscitation situation before. Table 1 shows the students' opinions regarding their performance of BLS. Nineteen students (54%) agreed or strongly agreed that they had received adequate training to enable them to perform BLS competently. However, only 34% of the students felt confident about performing BLS if required and the vast majority (94%) would like more practice before performing it in a real situation. Despite this, 57% of the students disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement that medical students are not qualified to perform BLS during a real cardiac arrest situation. The students were asked if they found chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth ventilation easy skills to perform, but although 34% of the students felt that chest compressions are easy to perform whereas only 26% considered performing mouth-to-mouth ventilation to be easy, the differences in perception of the ease or difficulty of both skills were not significant (p = 0.16, S = 2.0). Student opinion as to whether mouth-to-mouth ventilation is an efficient way of delivering oxygen was neutral (Table 1) . However, the majority of students (85%) disagreed or strongly disagreed that the option of performing only chest compressions was as effective as performing both chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth ventilation during a cardiorespiratory arrest. In addition, 48% of the students felt that it is morally wrong to withhold mouth-to-mouth ventilation if you are trained to do it. Twenty-seven students (13 male; 14 female) or 77%, were concerned regarding disease transmission to the rescuer during BLS (Table 2) . Whereas previous studies have found HIV transmission to be the greatest perceived risk to the rescuer during BLS, 68% of our student responders either disagreed or strongly disagreed that HIV is a greater risk to the rescuer than SARS (Table 2) . Performing mouth-to-mouth ventilation was thought to be a significantly more risky behaviour than performing chest compressions, as illustrated by the majority of students (68%) who considered the risk of transmission of infection to the rescuer from performing chest compressions to be low compared to only 26% who thought that the risk from performing mouthto-mouth ventilation was low (p = 0.002; S = 9.3) ( Table 2 ). Most students (71%) stated that the SARS outbreak had affected their opinion regarding the safety of mouth-to-mouth ventilation for the rescuer. However, when asked if the risk of disease transmission from mouth-to-mouth ventilation was higher after the SARS outbreak than it had been before, their responses were split fairly evenly between agreeing (52%) and disagreeing (40%), with very few neutral responses (8%) ( Table 2 ). Nearly all of the students (100% and 80%, respectively) denied that the fear of SARS would prevent them from performing chest compressions in the situations of (a) resuscitating a family member or (b) resuscitating a stranger. However, although small, the differences in the student responses regarding willingness to perform chest compressions for family members and strangers were significant (p < 0.001; Z = −3.6) (Fig. 1a) . Student opinion regarding the performance of mouth-to-mouth ventilation was much more divided. Whereas 100% of the student respondents indicated that the fear of SARS would not prevent them from performing mouth-to-mouth The risk from performing chest compressions is low 17 51 12 14 6 The risk from performing mouth-to-mouth ventilation is low The risk of infection transmission during mouth-to-mouth ventilation is greater now than it was before the SARS epidemic 9 43 8 34 6 The SARS epidemic has had no effect on my opinion regarding the safety of mouth-to-mouth ventilation HIV is a greater risk to the rescuer than SARS during BLS 0 3 29 37 31 ventilation for a family member, only 54% stated this in regard to strangers while 37% claimed that it would prevent them from performing mouthto-mouth ventilation in this situation (p < 0.001; Z = −4.3) (Fig. 1b) . In addition, regarding the resuscitation of strangers only, the students claimed to be significantly more likely to withhold the performance of mouth-to-mouth ventilation due to a fear of SARS than they were to withhold chest compressions (p < 0.001; Z = −4.0). However, the effect of the fear of SARS in causing student reluctance to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation is less than the effect of the presence of sus SARS: p < 0.001, Z = −3.6), although there is no significant difference in the effect of the presence of vomit compared with the presence of blood (p = 0.9, Z = −0.1). Similar results were obtained when these three factors were compared regarding the resuscitation of family members (Fig. 2b) . When considering the four different patient types, the students were significantly more likely to perform both skills for family members compared to any of the other groups (p ≤ 0.001; 2 = 13.6-25.7), but there were no significant differences in the responses comparing each group of strangers to each other (Fig. 3) . Performing no basic life support at all was not a popular option for the majority (80-86%) of our students regardless of the type of patient they were resuscitating. The SARS outbreak has, for the majority (89%), made no difference to the student likelihood of performing mouth-to-mouth ventilation for family members (Fig. 4) . The responses for each of the stranger groups were similar to each other with no significant difference between any of the groups and were mainly split between the SARS outbreak having made (a) no difference to the likelihood that the students would perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation (46-54%) and (b) a decrease in the likelihood that the students would perform mouth-tomouth ventilation (29-37%) for these patient types (Fig. 4) . A constant 17% of students claimed that they would now be more likely to perform mouthto-mouth ventilation for each of the stranger groups than they would have been before the SARS outbreak. In the final section of the questionnaire, the two most common reasons indicated by the students that would prevent performance of mouth- to-mouth ventilation were fear of SARS (74%) and fear of vomitus (66%). Only 6% of students felt that they would not perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation because it is not useful. There was a significant male:female divide. Male students were significantly more concerned regarding HIV than female students (p = 0.03, 2 = 4.9) who in turn were more concerned with the fear of failure (p = 0.01, 2 = 6.7) and the unpleasant nature of mouth-tomouth ventilation (p < 0.01, 2 = 7.1) (Fig. 5 ).
