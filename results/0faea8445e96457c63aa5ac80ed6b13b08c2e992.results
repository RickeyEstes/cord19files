The 11-week period of evaluation during the fall 2009 pandemic period included a median of 2,774 (IQR 2,219-3,319) admissions and 19,283 (IQR 15,842-21,315) bed-days (Table 1) . Median overall inpatient occupancy was 95% (IQR 85%-99%), whereas median overall occupancy during the 2008-09 seasonal infl uenza period was 101% (IQR 96%-110%) and, for the entire calendar year 2008, 91% (IQR 87%-95%). Hospitals' experiences varied considerably, with hospital-level median occupancy ranging from 57.4% to 128.0% (online Technical Appendix, www.cdc.gov/eid/content/17/9/101950-Techapp.pdf). To reach 100% occupancy during the pandemic period, for every 10 beds of each type, hospitals would have needed to admit a median of 0.2 (IQR 0.1-0.3) additional patients per day for non-ICU beds and 0.7 (IQR 0.5-0.9) per day for ICU beds (Table 2) . For the 26 hospitals for which ED and inpatient data were available, the median ED-to-hospital admission rate for IRI patients was 5.4% (IQR 3.3%-8.1%). Different hypothetical scenarios for ED IRI volume and admission rates would have differently affected the frequency of hospital days exceeding the 100% occupancy threshold for exhausting capacity reserves ( Individual hospital experience varied considerably (Figure) . For each hospital, the dot-plots we constructed show the distribution of occupancy data across hospitals for each of the 6 scenarios. For our worst-case scenario (scenario F), median occupancy would have been 132% (IQR 124%-145%).
