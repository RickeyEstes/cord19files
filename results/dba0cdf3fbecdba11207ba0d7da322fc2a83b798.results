The WHO assessment tool also provided an MS Excel spreadsheet file model, which enabled reviewers to choose their response (fully implemented, partially implemented, or not implemented) to each indicator. When the performance of each indicator is determined, the model automatically generates numerical results with graphic representations of the same. According to the WHO, a PoE with a final score of above 80% is defined as fairly consistent with the requirements of the IHR Annex 1. Assessment results of the TIA The TIA taskforce reported a self-assessment score of 86%. Among 89 assessment indicators (six indicators specific to seaports/ground crossing were excluded), 73.1% were assessed as 'fully implemented', while 26.9% were reported to be 'partially implemented' in the airport. It was found that the TIA owns a communication network among various stakeholders for communicable diseases or biological events, while the reporting system for radiological and chemical events had not yet been established. The airport exhibited routine capacities of adequate on-site medical services for ill travelers, and an inspection/surveillance program of the terminal environment and aircraft. However, the response plans toward radiological, chemical, and biological emergencies were not in place. The external reviewer of the preliminary external assessment reported that 77.5% of the assessment indicators had been 'fully implemented', while 22.5% had been 'partially implemented'. The total score of the TIA was 91%, which showed a fair progress as compared to the self-assessment. From the reviewer's viewpoint, the TIA had already or nearly fulfilled Part A (Communication & Coordination) and Part BI (Routine) requirements, and suggested that further efforts need to be invested in developing its capabilities to respond to PHEIC. It was noted that all the competent authorities in the TIA answered that if they encountered a problem that was difficult to address, they would consult their headquarters. However, the horizontal communication between agencies at the TIA was rarely mentioned. Based on the learning from the previous two assessments, the TIA applied its action plans on the following areas: 1) Reconstructing the communication flow to ensure that event information is notified by and disseminated to stakeholders including outsourcing companies and service providers; 2) formulating/updating emergency plans with the consideration of the surge response. Contents of the plans, along with the communication link with various targets, were validated by table exercises or scenario drills; 3) developing regular and irregular inspection mechanisms to ensure the quality of outsourcing services, and specifying all requirements in contracts; 4) designating a specific location for the decontamination of PHEIC; 5) replacing personal protective equipments (PPEs) that had passed their expiry date, or purchasing required ones; and (6) updating standard operating procedures (SOPs) for inspecting and responding to air postal parcels. The reviewers of the follow-up external assessment reported that 100% of the indicators had been 'fully implemented' (Fig. 3) . In general, reviewers determined five strengths of the TIA: 1) communication link with travelers for health-related information; 2) the Operation Control Center provides comprehensive infrastructure and management for PHEIC; 3) on-site medical facilities and integration of resources with contracted hospitals; 4) capacities for radiological and chemical inspection, and emergency response; and 5) providing access to, and training in the use of, PPE for all hazards. In addition, two areas of consideration were proposed in the further implementation of the core capacities. First, as the detection of fever-screening limits for respiratory diseases was an area of concern, broader surveillance parameters may be considered to enable the detection of nonrespiratory diseases. Second, it was suggested that a risk assessment may be implemented to determine whether vector control measures are warranted, and whether a response protocol should be established to mitigate the risk of introduction of vectors detected in an aircraft. In response to the reviewers' recommendations, the TCDC, as the competent authority for these matters, are carrying out policy analysis of current entry screening procedures, as well as the vector surveillance/control on aircrafts (Table 1) .
