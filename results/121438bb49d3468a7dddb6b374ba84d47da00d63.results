The current study describes and defines the nuclear organization of the cholinergic, catecholaminergic, serotonergic and orexinergic neural systems in three species of strepsirrhine primates (Demidoff's dwarf bushbaby-G. demidoff, the potto-P. potto and the ring-tailed lemur-L. catta). For the most part, the systems investigated exhibited an organization that may be thought of as generally mammalian, and typically primate-like; however, the structure of the locus coeruleus in the primates appears to be quite different to that observed in most other mammals, although it is very similar to that seen in megachiropteran bats Dell et al., 2010) . As all species investigated showed a near identical pattern of nuclear organization, the following description applies to all three species unless otherwise noted. Despite this it should be noted that hile the nuclear subdivisions of these systems are the same across the species, the exact morphology of the brains of the different species does differ to some extent, and these minor differences lead to slightly different placement of the nuclei of the systems investigated in relation to the broader neuroanatomy.
