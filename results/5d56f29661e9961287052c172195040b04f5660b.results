Among the socio-demographic variables in the first block, gender had a significant and positive relationship with risk perception (b ¼ 0.09, p < 0.01) and income had a significant and negative relationship with the dependent variable (b ¼ -0.07, p < 0.05). Theses suggest that female respondents were more likely than male respondents to perceive risk regarding MERS and respondents with higher levels of income tended to perceive more risk than those with lower level of income. We also found that the use of the Internet was positively related to risk perceptions of MERS (b ¼ 0.08, p < 0.05), indicating that respondents who were more exposed to news and information on the Internet about MERS were more likely to perceive risk regarding the infectious disease. In the second block, social media exposure was found to be positively associated with risk perceptions of MERS (b ¼ 0.07, p < 0.05). This finding suggests that respondents who were more exposed to news and information on social media about MERS were more likely to perceive greater levels of risks about the infectious disease. Thus, H1 was supported. In the third block, which included the information processing mode (HSM), we found that systematic processing was positively related to risk perceptions of MERS (b ¼ 0.34, p < 0.001). In support of H2, this finding indicates that respondents who engaged more in systematic processing were more likely to perceive risks of the infectious disease. However, there was no significant relationship between heuristic processing and the dependent variable. Thus, H3 was not supported. In the fourth block, self-efficacy for MERS displayed a significant and negative relationship with risk perceptions of MERS (b ¼ -0.14, p < 0.001), lending support for H4. This suggests that respondents who reported greater self-efficacy for MERS were less likely to perceive risks of the infectious disease. In addition to these main effects, the final block demonstrates the interactive effects among social media exposure, heuristicsystematic processing, and self-efficacy on risk perceptions. After accounting for all controls, and in response to RQ1, we found that there was a significant interaction effect between social media exposure and systematic processing (b ¼ 0.08, p < 0.01, See Fig. 1 ). As shown in Fig. 1 , this interaction suggests that the relationship between social media exposure and risk perception was significantly stronger for respondents who engaged in high systematic processing than for those who engaged in low systematic processing. That is, the influence of social media exposure on risk perceptions was significantly more pronounced among those who engaged in high systematic processing. We also found a positive and significant interaction effect between social media exposure and heuristic processing on risk perception (b ¼ 0.12, p < 0.001, See  Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 shows that the relationship between social media exposure and risk perceptions was stronger for individuals who engaged in high heuristic processing than for those engaged in low heuristic processing. This finding suggests that the impact of increased social media exposure on risk perceptions was much more significant among those who engaged in high heuristic processing, even though increased social media exposure positively impacts risk perception among all people (as our significant main effect has already shown). In response to RQ2, the study found a significant interactive effect between social media exposure and self-efficacy for MERS on risk perception (b ¼ 0.08, p < 0.01, See Fig. 3 ). As indicated in Fig. 3 , this interaction suggests that the impact of social media exposure in increasing risk perceptions was stronger for those who reported 10.5 *** Block 4: Efficacy Self-Efficacy for MERS À0.14 *** Incremental R 2 (%) 1.8 *** Block 5: Two-Way Interactions Social Media Exposure x Systematic Processing 0.08 ** Social Media Exposure x Heuristic Processing 0.12 *** Social Media Exposure x Self-Efficacy for MERS 0.08 ** Incremental R 2 (%) 1.7 *** Total R 2 (%) 20.7 Notes: Cell entries are standardized regression coefficients for Blocks 1, 2, 3, and 4 and while cell entries are before-entry standardized regression coefficients for Block 5. *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05. greater self-efficacy for MERS compared to those with lower selfefficacy for MERS.
