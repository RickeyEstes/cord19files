We included 58,304 testing episodes (obtained from 54,116 unique patients, including 7% tested during multiple seasons), with 11,496 (20%) testing positive for influenza and 31,004 (53%) vaccinated during the season of testing and before specimen collection. Compared with test-negative controls, test-positive cases were older, were more likely to be female, used fewer health services, had fewer comorbidities, and were less likely to be vaccinated (Supplementary Table  S3 ). Descriptive statistics comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated patients can be found in Supplementary  Table S4 . Overall adjusted VE against any influenza for the 2010/11 to 2015/16 seasons combined was 21% (95%CI: 18 to 24%) ( Table 1 ). For the six seasons combined, VE was 38% (95%CI: 28 to 46%) against A(H1N1)pdm09, 22% (95%CI: 16 to 28%) against A(H3N2), and 30% (95%CI: 24 to 36%) against B. VE against unsubtyped influenza A viruses was only 11% (95%CI: 5 to 16%). We observed substantial variability in VE by season (interaction test p < 0.001), by age group (p = 0.01), and by sex (p = 0.03), but not by healthcare setting (p = 0.60). After correcting for misclassification of vaccination status, VE for the six seasons combined increased to 38% (95%CI: 35 to 42%) against any influenza. We observed similar results when restricting the analysis to ARI-coded healthcare encounters and to patients tested by PCR ( Table 1 ) . VE estimates stratified by influenza subtype and season are presented in Supplementary Table S5 .
