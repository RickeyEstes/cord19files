Fourteen adult patients;8 males,with median age 32(range 25-48) years,presented with high fever, headache, severe body aches, a severe sore throat and a dry cough for 2-3 days duration. They complained of severe sore eyes around the 4-5th day associated with intense tearing. Examination revealed variable degree of posterior cervical lymphadenopathy and in 6 of them, typical Koplik's spots were noted in the buccal mucosa on the 3-4th day of illness. The eyes were injected around the 4th day and progressed to develop red eyes over the next few days (Fig. 1) . Five of them developed sub-conjunctival haemorrhages. The patients with severe conjunctivitis had photophobia and intense tearing requiring treatment by ophthalmologists. Around the 5th day of clinical illness, they developed a discrete maculopapular rash starting in the forehead and the face which spread to involve the upper chest, back and the limbs including palms and soles by the 7th day (Fig. 2 ). Almost all patients developed a dry cough on the 3rd day and 8 developed severe intractable cough and wheezing with the chest examination revealing wide spread coarse crackles and polyphonic rhonchi. In investigations on 3rd-4th day; the white cell count ranged 2.2-6.2 × 10 3 /dL with neutrophils ranging 34-53% and lymphocytes 35-55%. The lowest platelets ranged 96-152 × 10 9 /L. The C-reactive protein levels (CRP) ranged from 14 to 56 mg/dl. Almost all of these patients had derangements in the liver functions with ALT (Alanine aminotransferase) median (range) 246iu/L (128-367) and AST (Aspartate aminotransferase)178iu/L (96-236) with normal serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. Around the 5-7th day, eight patients had coarse crackles wide spread over the lung fields, rises in the white cell counts (9.3-11.5 × 10 3 /dL; N 65-78%), high CRP levels (24-110 mg/dL) and chest radiographs showing bilateral patchy opacifications (2-5 mm) suggestive of varying degrees of lower respiratory tract involvement and required management with intravenous cephalosporins (cefuroxime or cefotaxime). Altogether, the illness lasted up to about 10 days and had high fever spikes ranging from 102 to 104 °F for about 6-7 days in a majority of cases. The fever regressed with the fading of the rash and was followed by peeling of the facial skin and the palms and soles. All 14 patients were positive for measles IgM antibodies confirming the diagnosis. They were negative for dengue NS1 Ag. On further questioning none of these patients knew whether they had measles immunization as a child nor had immunization records available with them. Furthermore, they were not aware of recent recommendation of immunization for those who were above 25 years of age. When questioned whether they would have obliged to obtain such immunization, they raised doubts as to whether such immunization is really necessary at their age. While only 10 of themhad heard of measles, 8 thought it was an illness in the childhood and adults had nothing to do with it. Furthermore, two patients had regular foreign travel to regional countries for business or occupation related purposes, one had travelled to India on Buddhist pilgrimage several occasions over the last four years. None of the others have travelled outside the country. While one patient who arrived for follow up visit had become aware that the receptionist in his private company had been ill with a similar illness about two days prior to his illness, none of the others were aware of such illness among their work mates or among other associates. However they were travelling in public transport very often for daily needs. The last patient to be included in the cohort was a sister of a final year medical student who had been doing the paediatric clinical appointment at the time she developed the illness.
