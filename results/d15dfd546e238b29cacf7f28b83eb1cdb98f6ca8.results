CR1 plasma levels. CR1 plasma levels were significantly lower in CD patients compared to controls (p < 0.0001), (Fig. 1) . When comparing controls to each clinical form separately, statistical differences were also observed for CR1 levels between controls and the indeterminate form (p = 0.0002), cardiac form (p < 0.0001), digestive form (p < 0.0001), and cardiodigestive form (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1) . Comparison of CR1 levels between asymptomatic (indeterminate form) and symptomatic patients showed no statistical difference. Association of CR1 variants with Chagas disease. The distribution of CR1 genotypes in controls was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p > 0.05), in patients with chronic CD three SNPs (rs17047660, rs17047661, rs4844609) were not in HW equilibrium, which may be due to disease association. The frequencies of CR1 variants rs17047660G (p = 0.02, OR 5.06, 95%CI 1.17-21.81), rs17047661G (p = 0.0042, OR 3.03, 95%CI 1.34-9.9) and rs6691117G (p = 0.015, OR 1.6, 95%CI 1.09-2.35) were significantly higher in CD patients compared to controls (Table 1) . Also, the frequencies of the CR1 genotypes rs17047661AG and rs17047661GG (p = 0.015, OR 3.0, 95%CI 1. 25-7.49 ) and rs6691117AG and rs6691117GG (p = 0.004, OR 2.2, 95%CI 1.26-3.53) were significantly higher in chronic CD patients than in controls (Table 1) . When analyzing CD patients according to their clinical presentation in relation to controls, the rs6691117G allele occurred more frequently among asymptomatic indeterminate form of CD (p = 0.02, OR 1.7, 95%CI 1.09-2.69) and in patients presenting with the digestive form of CD (p = 0.025, OR 2.4, 95%CI 1.18-5.0) ( Table 1 ). In addition, carriers of the G allele (rs6691117AG and rs6691117GG) were rather present among asymptomatic patients than in controls (p = 0.006, OR 2.3, 95%CI 1.28-4.27) ( Table 1) . A significant association with the cardiac form was found also for the minor G allele of rs17047661 (p = 0.017, OR 3.9, 95%CI 1.62-9.68) and for G carriers (AG and GG) (p = 0.023, OR 3.7, 95%CI 1.19-11.72) ( Table 1) . Patients with cardiomyopathy, graded according to the classification of cardiomyopathy as outlined in the Methods section, were compared to asymptomatic patients. The rs17047661G allele occurred more frequently in patients with cardiomyopathy without ECHO alteration (p = 0.028, OR 2.8, 95%CI 1.14-7.16) and in patients with cardiomyopathy without heart failure (p = 0.0065, OR 2.8, 95%CI 1.33-6.02) than in asymptomatic patients. Both rs17047661AG and rs17047661GG genotypes were observed more frequently among patients with cardiomyopathy without ECHO alteration (p = 0.031, OR 3.3, 95%CI 1.11-9.75) and in patients with cardiomyopathy without heart failure (p = 0.02, OR 1.7, 95%CI 1.08-2.79) than in patients without overt symptoms ( Table 2) . Comparing patients with cardiomyopathy and considering the different stages of cardiac pathology, the rs17047661G alleles (p = 0.0017, OR 0.19, 95%CI 0.06-0.59) and rs17047661AG and rs17047661GG genotypes (p = 0.007, OR 0.15, 95%CI 0.03-0.60) were more frequent in patients without heart failure than in those with heart failure ( Table 2 ). Association of CR1 haplotypes with Chagas disease. A total of 15 CR1 haplotypes were observed, they were reconstructed from the six CR1 variants (rs17259045, rs41274768, rs17047660, rs17047661, rs4844609, rs6691117) investigated in the study (Fig. 2) . The frequency of CR1*AGAGTG haplotype was significantly increased among CD patients (p = 0.035, OR 3.9, 95%CI 1. 10-14.15 ), in patients with cardiomyopathy without ECHO alteration (p = 0.03, OR 5.5, 95%CI 1. 17-25.8) , and in cardiomyopathy patients without heart failure (p = 0.005, OR 7.7, 95%CI 1.84-32.7) than among controls. In addition, CR1*AGGGTG was significantly associated with cardiomyopathy (p = 0.028, OR 12.1, 95%CI 1.3-113) and with the absence of heart failure (p = 0.037, OR 11.1, 95%CI 1.15-107) in comparison to controls (Table 3) . Linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns of the CR1 variants are given in Fig. 3 . Strong LD was observed only in chronic CD patients. The LD plot indicates that rs17259045, rs41274768, rs17047660, and rs17047661 were in strong LD with rs6691117; therefore, rs17047660 was also in strong LD with rs17047661.
