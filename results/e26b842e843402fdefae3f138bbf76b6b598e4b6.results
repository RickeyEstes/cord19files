A total of 1,380 sera of healty adults obtained from some provinces and cities of China were assayed for the antibody against adult diarrhoea rotavirus, of which 141 were positive, giving a total positive rate of 10.2%. The results are shown in Table 1 . In order to confirm the accuracy of the results, a blocking test was carried out on 25 positive serum specimens as well as on rabbit anti-adult diarrhoea rotavirus immune serum. Its results revealed that the P/N ratios after blocking were all lower than those before blocking. The P/N ratio of normal rabbit serum serving as the negative control showed no change after blocking.
