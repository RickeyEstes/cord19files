Preparation and characterization of antibody to PEDV Cell lesion was above 85% after PEDV was inoculated onto Vero cell monolayer for 36 h. After repeated freezing and thawing, cracking and sucrose-PBS gradient centrifugation, the virus bands between the 40 and 60% interface were collected. After identification, protein concentration was determined to be 4 mg/mL. The prepared PEDV was used to immunize mice to generate mAbs against PEDV [24] . From the hybridoma cells generated against PEDV, 14 clones that could produce mAbs with strong PEDV binding ability were selected. Immunoglobulin isotyping suggested these clones were IgG2a. To select PEDV mAb pairs with high sensitivity and specificity, a double antibody sandwich ELISA was used. The amount of capture antibody for coating and detecting antibody in both experimental and control group was 10 μg/ml. 1 μg/ml PEDV was added to each well of experimental group while an equal volume of PBS was added to the control group. Only the mAb pairs which have strong signal (OD ≥ 1.0) in PEDV group and no obvious signal (OD ≤ 0.2) in PBS group were marked as positive. All the mAb pairs which have no strong signal in PEDV group or have obvious signal in PBS group were marked as negative. As shown in Tables 1, 5 of the 14 mAbs were successfully paired using double antibody sandwich ELISA matrix method. These successfully paired mAbs (4A11, 5H9, 5A9, A11H7 and 4H7) were used in the new ICA for their outstanding binding ability.
