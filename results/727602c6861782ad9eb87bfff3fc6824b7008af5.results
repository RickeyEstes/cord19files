To analyze the ubiquity and diversity of CBD in Brazil, Using nested RT-PCR, we tested for the presence of CLRDV-related sequences in all 23 sampled plants. The CP sequence, part of RdRp, and the full IR were amplified in all the isolates tested (Table 1) . All amplicons showed the expected size for CLRDV and were sequenced. At least three independent PCR reactions for each fragment from each sample were sequenced. The obtained sequences were aligned and a consensus nucleotide sequence for each isolate was made for the three viral fragments. The CP sequences of all isolates were similar to the CP sequence from CLRDV deposited in the GenBank database (accession number AY758560). In addition, most of the RdRp sequences analyzed were also closely related to that of the previously reported isolate (accession number AY758561). However, three isolates (designated PL3, CV2, and PO1) showed best hit results with TVDV, an unclassified member of the family Luteoviridae, but not with CLRDV. This suggests that these three isolates may have resulted from recombination events. Interestingly, these three divergent viruses were found in plants with atypical CBD symptoms. When we compared CP sequence identities from all the isolates, we observed a high degree of nucleotide identity (97-100%). However, when the partial RdRp sequences were analyzed, the sequence identities were lower (65-100%). Most of this diversity resulted from a high sequence divergence in the three isolates found in plants with atypical CBD symptoms. Isolates PL3, CV2, and PO1 shared identities of 68%, 68%, and 67%, respectively, with the original CLRDV RdRp sequence. The identities among PL3, CV2, and PO1, however, ranged from 93% to 95%. Excluding the divergent isolates from the analysis, identities ranging from 95 to 100% for the RdRp sequence were observed among the 20 newly-identified CLRDV isolates. Similar results were also obtained for the IR, where the identities ranged from 94% to 100% among the 20 CLRDV isolates. The three divergent isolates shared identities of 66% with the original CLRDV IR sequence.
