We demonstrated previously that MHC class I antigens are expressed at high levels on the surface of MHV-A59 infected astrocytes and oligodendrocytes when compared to uninfected cells .' 1, 18 We wanted to determine if these changes were a result of an increase in MHC-specific mRNAs . We show here that infection of cells in culture as well as in vivo causes a rapid increase in both MHC class I and class II mRNAs . MHC mRNA induction in vitro in glial cell cultures Mixed glial cell cultures were derived by mechanical dissociation of newborn mouse brain . Greater than 90% of the cells in these cultures are positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as determined by immunostaining, suggesting they are of the astroglial lineage ; 19,31 (data not shown) . Confluent monolayers of cells were infected with A59 at high multiplicity as described in Materials and methods . At regular intervals, total RNA was isolated from the cells, bound to nylon membranes, and hybridized with single-stranded RNA probes specific for MHC class I mRNA ; the amount of probe that hybridized was quantitated by counting sections of the membrane containing individual RNA samples with a scintillation counter . The amount of positivesense probe that bound to the membrane was used as an estimate of non-specific binding and background . As shown in Table 1 , uninfected mixed glial cultures express low levels of class I mRNA . However, these cells respond rapidly to infection with an increase in class I expression that, by day 3, approaches six-fold . Class I transcripts decreased thereafter, returning to levels observed in mock-infected cells or below by day 10 . To verify and extend these results, both virus-infected and mock-infected cultures were examined for class I expression by in situ hybridization . These experiments failed to show expression of class I mRNA in mock-infected cells hybridized with the negative-sense probe (Fig . 1A) . In contrast, a marked increase in MHC class I expression was observed in A59-infected cells (Fig . 1 B) . Expression was observed in the majority of cells indicating that the elevation was not a result of a minor cell type responding to infection . Control experiments in which infected cells were treated with the positive-sense probe did not reveal significant hybridization (Fig . 1 C) . We suggest that astrocytes, the major cell type in these cultures, have the ability to elevate class I mRNA expression in response to infection .
