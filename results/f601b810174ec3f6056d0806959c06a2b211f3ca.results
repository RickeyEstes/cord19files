FP affects transcription factors regulating immunity to RV. To determine the efficacy and duration of action of ICS in a mouse model of FP treatment, we assessed glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation by measuring nuclear GR-DNA binding. Administration of 20 μg FP, a dose similar to that employed in previous animal studies 16, 19 , significantly increased GR activation, while a tenfold lower dose did not (Fig. 1a) . RV infection activates immune-regulating transcription factors, including nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB), required for proinflammatory responses to RV infection 20 and IFN regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), required for antiviral responses 21 . We assessed the effect of FP administration (Fig. 1b) on RV activation of these transcription factors in mouse lung. FP suppressed lung NFκB p65 activation in RV-infected mice at 8 h post infection (Fig. 1c) . For IRF-3, activation by RV occurred at 2 h post infection and significant suppression was also observed in FP-treated mice (Fig. 1c) . ICS suppress innate immunity and impair virus control. We next assessed the effect of FP on innate antiviral immune responses to RV infection in mice. FP suppressed RV induction of lung IFNβ and IFNλ2/3 mRNAs (~75% and~60% reductions, respectively, Fig. 1d ) and IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-λ2/3 BAL proteins (~85%,~80% and~50% reductions, respectively, Fig. 1e ). FP also suppressed RV induction of the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (2′-5′-OAS), protein kinase-R (PKR) and viperin and CXCL10/IP-10 protein in BAL (~75%,~45%,~60% and~80% reductions, respectively, Fig. 1f ). Type I IFN receptor signalling is required for airway natural killer (NK) cell responses to RVs 20 . Reduced numbers of total and activated (CD69 expressing) NK cells were observed in RVinfected mice treated with FP (Fig. 1g) . Consistent with the suppression of innate antiviral responses ( Fig. 1d-g) , FP treatment led to delayed virus clearance with increased RV RNA copies in FP-treated mice at 8, 24 and 48 h post infection (maximal effect size threefold at 8 and 48 h) and increased levels of infectious virus at 24 h (Fig. 1h) . To confirm that other ICS compounds apart from FP can also impair antiviral immunity, we evaluated the effect of another commonly used agent, budesonide, on RV infection in mice. Administration of 20 μg of budesonide similarly suppressed RV induction of lung IFNβ and IFNλ2/3 and increased RV RNA ( Supplementary Fig 1a-d) . FP impairs adaptive immune responses to RV infection. We next determined the effects of FP on adaptive immune responses to RV infection (Fig. 2a) . Total and activated numbers of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were suppressed in FP-treated mice (Fig. 2b , c) as were serum levels of RV-specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies and neutralising antibody (Fig. 2d ). Fig. 2a ) suppressed cellular airway inflammation with reduced numbers of neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages observed in BAL ( Supplementary Fig. 2b ). FP also suppressed RV induction of BAL neutrophil chemokines CXCL1/KC and CXCL2/MIP-2 and the lymphocyte chemokine CCL5/RANTES ( Supplementary  Fig. 2c ).
