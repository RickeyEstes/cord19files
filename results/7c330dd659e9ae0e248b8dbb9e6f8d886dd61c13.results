Using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), fourteen (16%) of the aerosol samples collected from the Singapore MRT tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses. Nine (64%) of the virus-positive aerosol samples were collected from the North East MRT Line (NEL; Purple) and five (36%) from the East West MRT Line (EWL; Green). Nine of the virus-positive aerosol samples (64%) tested positive for adenovirus, four (29%) tested positive for RSV-A, and one (7%) tested positive for influenza A virus. One sample tested positive for both adenovirus and RSV-A. One additional sample with a Ct value of 41 was suspected to be positive for influenza A virus. Aerosol samples did not test positive for any other target pathogens including influenza B viruses, enteroviruses, coronaviruses, and RSV-B. Temperature, relative humidity (RH) and light intensity remained relatively consistent inside the Purple and Green MRT Lines throughout the study, with averages of 27 °C and 28 °C, 63% RH, and 710.4 and 730.7 lum/m², respectively (Table 1 ). There were no significant differences in these environmental conditions on sampling days yielding virus-positive aerosol samples. Adenovirus-positive droplets (>4 μm in aerodynamic diameter) and droplet nuclei (≤4 μm in aerodynamic diameter) were retrieved from six (67%) and four (44%) of the adenovirus-positive samples, respectively. In one instance, adenovirus-positive particles of both size ranges were retrieved from the same sample. RSV-A droplets and droplet nuclei were both retrieved from four (100%) of the RSV-A-positive samples. Only influenza A virus-positive droplets (not droplet nuclei) were retrieved from the influenza A virus-positive sample. Adenovirus-positive samples were collected in January 2018, and February, March, May, June, September and October 2017. RSV-A-positive samples were collected in February 2017, and the influenza A virus-positive sample was collected in September 2017. The additional sample that was suspected to be positive for influenza A virus was collected in November 2017. See Table 2 for a monthly summary of PCR-positive aerosol samples. Attempts to culture and subtype adenovirus and influenza A virus from PCR-positive aerosol samples were unsuccessful. Insufficient volumes of the original samples were leftover to attempt to culture RSV-A from PCR-positive aerosol samples.
