Antibody prevalence for IBR virus was 85.8%, and for BVD virus it was 79.2% in the tested cows from all dairy farms. Table 1 presents antthody prevalence for these viruses for each dairy farm. On the basis of the results we are able to say that the presence of anlfoodies to IBR and BVD viruses at these farm was approximately equal. Presence of IBR and BVD in dairy cows was considered in relation to their reproductive status ( Table 2 ). In the group of cows that proved positive for IBR and BVD viruses, a statistically si~ificant difference (P<O.O1) was observed between cows with reproductive disorders and those without reproductive disorders. The likelihood ratio test for the influence of]BR and BVD viruses on reproductive disorders was significant (likelihood ratio X 2 = 3.95, df= 1; P<0.05; Table 2 ). A reciprocal relation between IBR and BVD positive cows with reproductive disorders and cows without reproductive disorders on single dairy farms bring up Table 3 . Comparison of reproductive disorders in cows fTom the 4 dairy farms are presented in Table  4 . These reproductive disorders occurred at .~imilar rates among the farms. The most f~equently occurring reproductive disorder at all 4 dairy farms was that of repeat breeding, which affected 15 to 35% of the cows. Small percentages of stillbirths, perimetritis and atrophic ovaries were also found, although these disorders were not present at all the farms.
