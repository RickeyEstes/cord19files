No abnormality could be found on the plain radiographs of all of the patients. The diagnosis of AVN was based on MR findings. Twenty-eight of 65 SARS patients between April 2003 and August 2003 were identified as having AVN (Table 1) . Among them, there are 22 women (age range, 23 -50 years; mean age, 31.8 years) and six men (age range, 21 -52 years; mean age, 29.2 years). The mean time to diagnosis of AVN was 119 days after the diagnosis of SARS, or 116 days after steroid administration. Three patients had bilateral AVN of the hips (Fig. 1) , four patients of one femoral head (Fig. 2) , five patients of the bilateral hips, distal femur and proximal tibia, four patients of the ipsilateral hip and knees, 10 patients of the knee(s), one patient of right proximal fibula, and one patient of knees and talus (Fig. 3) . However, many small patchy areas of AVN involving the subchondral areas of the medial, lateral femoral condyle and tibia plateau were found (Fig. 4) .
