The parents of eighty-nine children did not give their consent mainly because of fears of distressing or injuring the child during the sampling procedure. There were no children with serious chronic disorders attending the day-care centers. The study population finally consisted of 233 healthy children whose parents consented to their enrolment. One hundred and twenty were from the rural and 113 from the urban area, while the male to female ratios were 64/56 and 60/53 (p = 0.53), respectively. Mean ± SD age was 3.5 ± 0.7 years. Four samples from each child, namely 932 samples in total were obtained. Viral nucleic acids were detected from 352 (37.7%) samples. Among positive samples, 272 (77.3%), 65 (18.5%), and 15 (4.3%) were positive for 1, 2, and 3 viruses, respectively. We did not detect any enteroviruses or coronaviruses. The distribution of viruses detected by sampling period is shown in Table 1 . Incidence of viral detection was significantly different in the different sampling periods for all viruses except for PIV and HMPV. Levels of UC were skewed to the left (p < 0.001) and were significantly higher in rural areas (medians (p25---p75): 3.70 (1.77---12.60) and
