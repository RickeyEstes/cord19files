The study was conducted in two sequential separate stages: (I) The exploratory stage, in which multiple patient samples and proteins were tested for Immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactivity, and (II) the validation stage using a smaller, high-interest subset of the proteins identified in Stage I based on the retrospective classification, and expanded to a larger cohort. The use of this focused subset allowed us to utilize the proteins displaying the greatest degree of differential IgG reactivity between patient groups and healthy controls. The different experimental designs are illustrated in Fig. 1a , and described in detail with the results further below. In Stage I multiple plasma samples (75) were obtained from male patients, in the 44-87 (median 70) age range, and a healthy cohort (34) , in the 52-70 (median 61) age range. As discussed in the Methods, the samples used in our study were obtained early in the patients' courses, to enable the assessment of predictive potential for prolonged clinical courses of the MDS patients (i.e., s-MDS). At the time of sample collection, the patients were classified using the prospective clinical risk-based IPSS system. Following long-term monitoring of the patients, the same samples were also assigned a retrospective classification (into s-MDS, t-MDS, L, as stated above and previously defined 23 ). The patients were compared to a healthy cohort (Table 1a) . After identifying a high-priority set of 35 markers (Fig. 1b-d) in Stage I described below, in the validation Stage II (Fig. 2a) the initial subject pool was enlarged to include both male and female individuals, with 204 patients (119 s-MDS, 42 t-MDS, 43 L) and 112 healthy controls (Table 1b) . We note here that differences in median ages between patient and healthy groups were taken into consideration in our Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) model below to ensure they were statistically not a factor for our final results. While Stage I samples were only obtained from male patients, as prior studies in patients with ovarian and prostate carcinoma showed gender differences in antibody reactivity 13, 14 , in Stage II we assessed samples from The investigation was carried out in two stages, (a), where in Stage I ProtoArrays were used to identify a high priority set of 35 candidate biomarkers, 25 of which were successfully spotted onto customized arrays for the Stage II focused validation part of the investigation. Stage II identified 3 biomarker candidates, AKT3, ARL8B and FCGR3A, which were also detected using ELISA assays. The 35 candidate biomarkers from Stage I showed distinct higher reactivity in MDS patients compared to the healthy cohort, (b), with higher standardized intensities indicated in yellow, low in blue/turquoise, and validated proteins from Stage II marked in red. (c) The binary statistical comparisons between patient subgroups and healthy cohort resulted in different sets of autoantibodies specific to their respective classification. The Venn diagram indicates the overlap between these comparisons, with more candidate biomarkers specific to s-MDS patients than in other subgroups. (d) Various associations, including cancer were discovered using Ingenuity Pathways and Network Analysis (IngenuityH Systems, http://www.ingenuity.com). www.nature.com/scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 3 : 3311 | DOI: 10.1038/srep03311 both genders and found no such differences in our results for MDS patients. Stage I results. The initial screening of protein arrays containing 9,483 proteins identified 35 autoantigens of high interest showing aberrantly high reactivity in patient subgroups compared to the healthy cohort (Fig. 1b) . The Venn diagram (Fig. 1c) indicates minimal overlap between the different retrospective MDS classifications, with the s-MDS group showing the greatest differences compared to the healthy group, which should be noted has greater numbers of available samples. Furthermore, considered as a whole the results support the hypothesis that MDS patients display distinct autoantibody responses compared to a healthy cohort (see also Supplementary Table S1 ). This initial screening identified relevant molecular associations, (IngenuityH IPA Knowledge Database, http://www.ingenuity.com, Stage II results. The high-interest proteins from Stage I (see Methods for details) were tested for validation, using custom protein arrays, with 25 proteins successfully produced and spotted (Fig. 2) . To take into account multiple sources of variability, we employed an ANOVA model, and filtered results to eliminate effects due to printing, replication and batch effect, and subject age (see Methods; Fig. 3a ). We identified 3 proteins, AKT3, FCGR3A and ARL8B (Fig. 3b) , showing aberrantly increased reactivity in patients compared to healthy (P , 0.01, Bonferroni corrected), and with no other factors considered having a significant confounding effect. The corresponding binary group comparisons of mean differences were also statistically significant [Mann-Whitney U-tests, with 1) AKT3 mean intensities P , 3 3 10 26 , ,3 3 10 23 , ,4 3 10 23 for s-MDS, t-MDS and L versus healthy respectively, 2) FCGR3A mean intensities P , 8 3 10 24 , ,7 3 10 23 , for s-MDS, and L versus healthy respectively, and 3) ARL8B mean intensities P , 4 3 10 25 , ,2 3 10 23 , ,3 3 10 26 , for s-MDS, t-MDS and L versus healthy respectively]. To classify the different samples into patient subgroups we implemented Kernel Discriminant Analysis (KDA [24] [25] [26] ), using the transformed intensities for AKT3, FCGR3A and ARL8B, for successful classification into retrospective classes, particularly for s-MDS ( Fig. 4a-b) . When considering s-MDS and healthy cohort only, s-MDS samples were classified correctly 87% of the time (103/119, standard deviation, s.d. ,3.1), and healthy samples at 90% (101/ 112, s.d. ,2.7). Expanding the classification to all MDS and L patients did not significantly affect classification for s-MDS or healthy cohorts (Fig. 4b) . However, the classification was lower for known t-MDS (38%, 16/42, s.d. ,3.0), and L (30%, 13/43, s.d. ,2.3) samples. Autoantibody reactivity-based classification worked less well for classifying samples into their known IPSS classes (Fig. 4c) . The best classification was for Intermediate 1(62%, 46/74 s.d, ,3.2), while the classification of healthy samples was at 100% (112/112, s.d ,0.6). We detected all three proteins of interest in plasma using Enzymelinked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs). For AKT3 and FCGR3A the differential protein levels were found to be statistically significant (ANOVA analysis Bonferroni corrected P , 9 3 10 28 , ,7 3 10 25 respectively) (Fig. 3c) . For AKT3 the differential protein trend between retrospective classes reflected the autoantibody reactivity (post hoc tests, Bonferroni P , 0.01, displaying differences between all patient groups versus healthy, as well as L versus t-MDS). For FCGR3A the differential protein levels showed an opposite trend compared to the corresponding autoantibody reactivity, Fig. 3b -c (post hoc tests, Bonferroni p , 0.01 displaying differences between healthy versus both t-MDS and s-MDS, as well as between L and both t-MDS and s-MDS).
