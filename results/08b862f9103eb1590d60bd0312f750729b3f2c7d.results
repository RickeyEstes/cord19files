Out of 130 eligible patients, 66 were RSV positive (data in S1 Fig). 92.4% of these (n = 61) were <12 months of age and the majority (66.7%) of the patients were boys. All children were correctly vaccinated according to the recommended national immunization schedule. Diagnosis at discharge was predominantly bronchiolitis 78.8% (n = 54) and pneumonia 6.1% (n = 4) 34.9% (n = 23) of the RSV positive patients had a suspected bacterial superinfection according to the referring physician. Molecular assessment revealed bacterial presence in the blood of seven (10.6%) patients ( Table 2 ). No differences were found between those with negative or positive PCR in terms of sex distribution, age, family history, vaccination rate, diagnosis or suspicion of bacterial superinfection. There were significant differences in terms of illness severity between children with positive bacterial PCR and those with negative results: PICU admission (100% vs. 50%, P-value = 0.015) and respiratory support necessity (100% vs. 18.6%, P-value < 0.001). Patients with confirmed bacteremia had a more severe respiratory affection than those with no bacteria identified in blood (Table 2 ). Both the Wood-Downes score and the GENVIP scale indicated a worse value in the blood PCR positive patients (mean = 8.7 points and 17.0 points, respectively) than in the blood PCR negative patients (mean = 4.8 points and 10.1 points) (P-value < 0.001 for both). Hospitalization was longer for children with PCR-confirmed bacteremia (mean = 12.1 vs. 7.5 days, P-value = 0.007) (Fig 1) . The pathogen found were H. influenzae (n = 4), S. pneumoniae (n = 1) and both simltaneously (n = 2). The cycle thresholds were <20 except for S. pneumoniae in the co-infection Table 2 . Summary of the characteristics of RSV cohort and comparison between those with positive and negative blood PCR for bacteria. General data are presented as percentages or means with 95% confidence intervals. Different statistical models were used to assess the association between the variables: Fisher's exact test (1) cases, in which the cycle threshold was >25. Only in one of these cases this bacteria had also been identified by conventional cultures. In nasopharyngeal samples, more than one virus was detected in 35 out of 66 (53.0%) patients by molecular techniques. In bacterial PCR positive patients, viral co-infection was observed in 5 out of 7 (71.4%) subjects (Table 3) . 30 patients with viral co-infection and negative PCR were identified (n = 24 patients with two virus and n = 6 with three virus). No statistical differences were observed in terms of viral co-infection between positive and negative bacterial PCR (P-value = 0.433) Antibiotic administration in patients with suspected bacterial superinfection was recorded in 50.0% (n = 33) of the RSV-infected patients and in 3.3% (n = 1) of these patients a bacterial superinfection was confirmed by conventional blood cultures. In the patients with confirmed bacteremia by PCR, n = 6 patients were treated with antibiotics due to suspected bacterial superinfection. In these 6 patients, wide spectrum antibiotics were used. There was no correlation between the patients suspected of superinfection and/or prescribed antibiotic by the referring physician, and those with positive blood PCR results (Cohen's kappa coefficient bacterial superinfection-PCR = 0.15). A total of 87.5% of the patients presented fever: > 38Â°C in 50% of the included children (24 out of 48), and low-grade fever in 18 of them (37.5%). Fever frequency in children with bacteremia confirmed by PCR was similar to that in the rest of the cohort (P-value = 0.733).
