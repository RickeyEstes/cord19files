In 1986, the Chinese Government divided China into three regions on the basis of disparities in economic progress at the time (appendix p 3). This division continues to be used today for the allocation of resources from the central government. 22 At the time of the 2010 census, 13 western China accounted for 27·0% of the total population. Compared with eastern and central China, the western region is more rural; has a lower GDP per capita, higher female illiteracy, and higher fertility; and is more sparsely populated (panel; appendix pp 4-5). The Chinese health policy and programme environment from the mid-1990s to the present has maintained a strong focus on maternal health, with committed funding (appendix pp [6] [7] [8] [9] . The Law on Maternal and Infant Health Care, formulated in 1994, provided a complete legal and policy framework for maternal and child health, and was implemented through National Plans of Action for women and children. The law specified clear guidelines for the care of pregnant women and newborn babies, including the need for access to qualified midwives for women who gave birth at home. The law also emphasised the strengthening of information systems for pregnancy and birth, including the introduction of birth certificates for all births. 23 The National Plan of Action for Women (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) aimed to raise the number of rural women delivering in health facilities and to vaccinate 85% of pregnant women against tetanus: the target was to decrease maternal mortality by 50% and eliminate neonatal tetanus by 2000. 24 The National Plans of Action for women were updated twice (2001-10 and 2011-20) to include further targets to decrease the maternal mortality ratio. 25, 26 To accelerate progress in the reduction of maternal mortality, the National Working Committee on Children and Women within the Chinese Ministry of Health designed the maternal mortality reduction and neonatal tetanus elimination programme in partnership with UNICEF and WHO, with a focus on increasing facility births and antenatal visits. 27 The programme was implemented in 378 counties in 12 western provinces in 1999, expanding coverage to a total of 2288 counties in 22 central and western provinces from 2008 onwards and reaching a population of 830 million by 2008. The programme was effective in reducing maternal mortality through the enhancement of hospital delivery. 28 In 2009 the programme was nationalised to ensure free hospital delivery for all women in China. 29 The programme was funded mainly by the central government with some financial inputs from provincial governments. Equity was an important focus: in 2009, the central government provided 80% of the funds for the poorest provinces but only 10% for the richest provinces. In total, the central government invested nearly ¥2·5 billion (US$1=¥6·31 in 2012) in the programme in 2000-12. 30 This programme encouraged birth in health facilities through a comprehensive set of measures. 31 First, the role of traditional midwives was transformed from assisting births at home to supporting referrals to health facilities and health promotion. Second, a fast channel referral system for pregnant women who were either medically or socially at risk was introduced (appendix p 10). Medical risk factors included young age (<18 years) or old age (>35 years), previous stillbirth, anaemia, and previous caesarean section, and women were considered socially at risk if they lived far from the hospital or had no family support at home (eg, no husband or the husband was working elsewhere). Responsibility for the referral system lay with the highest administrative authority within the county (usually the director of the health bureau). All women screened as high risk by the village doctor or township hospital staff were informed about when and which hospital to go to before the expected date of birth. Women in emergency situations were offered transport, and once they arrived in hospital, designated staff ensured that prompt care was given. Third, specific
