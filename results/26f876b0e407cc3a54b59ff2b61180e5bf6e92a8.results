The charts in Fig. 4 present the correlation of RR between values calculated using the reference method (manually for belt-based signals) and for two estimators for thermal-based signals. The values of the two signal descriptors (i.e., ''complexity'' and SPI) were calculated for thermal-based signals (experiment 1, no apnea events) from the nose ROI and from the forehead and cheeks ROIs. For the nose ROI, the mean values and standard deviations were ''complexity'' = 0.12 AE 0.01 (max value = 0.14; min value = 0.09) and SPI = 0.30 AE 0.09 In Fig. 5 , the aligned, thermal-based (black) and belt-based (green) respiration signals measured for the subject S01 are presented for all patterns used in experiment 2. The 60 recorded pattern signals were analyzed using the methods described in Section 2. Selected results are presented. Table 3 lists the results of the apnea event detection algorithm for the P2pattern signals (apnea time period to detect > Tapnea = 4 s). The mean, standard deviation and values for the coefficient of determination for the linear regression model were calculated and are shown in Table 3 . b i o c y b e r n e t i c s a n d b i o m e d i c a l e n g i n e e r i n g 3 6 ( 2 0 1 6 ) 7 3 1 -7 4 1 Fig. 6 illustrates selected examples of the apnea event detection results for two special cases: slow respiration rate and increasing temperature values during apnea (subject S04, left chart) and fast respiration rate and decreasing temperature values during apnea (subject S05, right chart). The respiration rate was also estimated for signals from experiment 2 (60 signals, P1-P5 patterns). The previously used RR estimators were used. In the absence of apnea events (P3), the results were practically the same as those for the data in experiment 1 (i.e., accurate RR estimation, especially using the eRR_ac estimator). In the presence of apnea events (P1, P2, P4, and P5), differences were observed due to the different definitions of the estimators. The eRR_sp and eRR_ac estimate the dominated signal's frequency such that apnea periods did not highly influence the result. Table 4 lists the estimated respiration rate values for signals with apnea events (P2 pattern). The reference values were calculated for the belt signals using manual indication of points in time for inspiration starts and counting the number of breath events (between beginning of inspirations). Two sets of reference values were calculated: RV1 = values calculated including apnea periods ((no. of events * 60)/(total time)) and RV2 = values calculated excluding apnea periods ((no. of events * 60)/ (sum of all periods of breath events)). The values of respiration rates for RV1 are smaller than those for RV2. The results presented in Table 4 for the eRR_sp and eRR_ac estimators were calculated with reference to the RV2 values, whereas the results for eRR_pk were calculated using the RV1 values (i.e., with apnea periods, according to the definition of the respiration rate). Table 5 displays the mean values and standard deviations of the respiration rate differences between estimated values and reference values. Additionally, values for the coefficient of determination for the linear regression model were calculated. For example, comparing the respiration rates obtained for the eRR_sp and eRR_ac estimators and using RV1 as a reference leads to much higher (than for RV2) differences between the estimated and reference respiration rates (mean and std. dev.), i.e., 4.677 AE 3.99 for eRR_sp and 5.611 AE 3.214 for eRR_ac. The ''complexity'' and SPI descriptors were also calculated for the pattern signals. The highest mean complexity value (lowest similarity to sine signal) was found for the P5 patterns, i.e., 0.163 AE 0.023, whereas the smallest mean value was found for the P3 patterns, i.e., 0.128 AE 0.050. Similarly, for the SPI descriptor, the highest mean value (more spectrally ''pure'' signal) was found for the P3 patterns, i.e., 0.489 AE 0.191, and the smallest mean value was noted for the P5 patterns, i.e., 0.308 AE 0.095. The recorded signals for the P1 and P5 patterns (irregular amplitudes) were also analyzed to verify whether the relative change of amplitudes observed for thermal recordings corresponds to the similar change observed for belt recordings. No such correlation was observed. Amplitude modulation for thermal recordings was not related to belt-based signals. Therefore, no quantitative analysis was performed. Fig. 7 shows examples of respiratory signals recorded simultaneously for the belt and the thermal camera (subject S01). The spectrogram is additionally presented (short time Fourier transform, window size = 250).
