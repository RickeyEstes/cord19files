At the EU level the probability of viral introduction was ranked highest for wEBOV with an overall average prediction of at least one introduction event occurring in one year (Table 2) , primarily via human travel and associated illegal importation of bushmeat. In relative terms, and given the uncertainties in the absolute value estimates, MARV and MERS-CoV were of a comparable risk whilst the overall probability of introduction was lowest for HeV. A 90% or 99% reduction in virus prevalence in the exporting country bat population only affected the risk estimates for the legal trade and bushmeat routes. Consequently, for EBOV and MERS-CoV, which had a relatively high probability of introduction from human travel, the decrease in risk from trade and bushmeat was not sufficient to affect the overall probability of disease introduction. For HeV and NiV, however, where the legal trade and bushmeat routes posed the highest risk in the baseline model the decrease in overall risk was substantial. Human travel replaced legal trade and bushmeat as the route with the highest associated probability for HeV, MARV and NiV introduction when the virus prevalence in bats was reduced by 99% (90% for MARV). The number of imports of live animals was low for all exporting countries resulting in a relatively low probability of introduction via this route for all viruses (Table 2) . Only dromedary camels (Camelus dromedaries) have been shown to be a risk factor for MERS-CoV transmission (Azhar et al., 2014) , but as there is no legal trade of live camelids to the EU from countries reporting cases of MERS-CoV, the risk from live animals was considered to be negligible. Within the EU, individual MSs demonstrated different relative probabilities for the various pathogens when the probabilities for all the routes of introduction were combined for each MS (Fig. 3) . The probability of introduction for MERS-CoV was quite high across most of the EU MSs, but for other viruses it was mainly focussed in a few MSs, usually in Western Europe with the probability of introduction for MSs from Eastern Europe and Scandinavia generally being much lower (Fig. 3) . Overall, the probability of introduction was highest for individual viruses in those MSs with strong historical links to relevant exporting countries, e.g. the United Kingdom (UK) for NiV and France for cEBOV. Such links usually correspond to a relatively large volume of human travel or legal trade movements between the countries. It should be noted that this analysis does not consider movement within the EU after the initial entry. The countries are ranked according to the probability of introduction for each virus in Table 3 . Overall there was a relatively wide variation in the relative ranking of many of the MSs between the different viruses. Different distributions of risk scores were observed between routes but considering the relative ranking of the MSs (1-28), the UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands generally have the highest probability of introduction for all viruses considered here.
