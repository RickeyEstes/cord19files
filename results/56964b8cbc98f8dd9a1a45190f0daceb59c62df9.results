The hriD Facilitated the solubility of Mers-coV rBD-Fr The spike glycoprotein (S) of MERS-CoV was used for the generation of MERS-CoV-like NPs. S protein forms trimers, resulting in large spikes on the virus envelope (47) . It is challenging to express the full-sized S protein (~200 kDa) in E. coli. Thus, the S1 domain of S protein (~80 kDa), which includes the receptor-binding ability, was used. Our initial attempt to express the S1 domain, either as S1 or as an S1-FR fusion protein, failed; the expression level and solubility of the protein was below the lower limit of detection by SDS-PAGE and western blotting ( Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). We therefore used the RBD (367-606 a.a.) of the S1 protein, which has a pivotal function as illustrated in Figure 1B (48, 49) . When expressed alone in E. coli, the RBD is not able to form the trimeric assembly (unpublished observation), due to the lack of the HR2 domain within the S2 domain (50) . To overcome this problem, FR was used as scaffold for the assembly. FR is a spherical NP whose subunits form trimers that subsequently result in octahedral structures composed of 24 identical subunits (51) . We therefore performed computational modeling to evaluate the potential of FR as scaffold for trimer formation of the RBD. Possible trimer formation was analyzed by computational modeling using MODELER (13, 52) and ClusPro (41, 42) . Various linkers, including SSG, ASG, and D6, were introduced between the RBD and FR with a goal to minimize steric hindrance between the two domains so as to enhance trimer and NP formation. In silico analysis showed energy-stable trimeric models of RBD-FR, RBD-[SSG]-FR, and RBD-[ASG]-FR, whereas RBD-D6-FR failed to form a trimeric structure ( Figure 1A) . The RBD-[SSG]-FR was predicted to be the most stable and well-structured compared with RBD-FR and RBD-[ASG]-FR. Initial testing of the RBD-FR constructs without hRID fusion showed that none of the constructs were solubly expressed, even under low-temperature culture conditions ( Figure 1C ) ( Figure 1B) . We previously confirmed that by using chaperna, the globular domain of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) is efficiently assembled into a trimeric complex with an immunologically relevant conformation (Yang et al., in press) . As shown in Figure 1C , the hRID fusion significantly increased the solubility of both RBD-FR (59.1%) and RBD-[SSG]-FR (62.83%), indicating that the chaperna platform effectively increased both the solubility and the folding of its fused target proteins. Because of the poor expression level and low solubility of the RBD-[ASG]-FR construct (Figure 1C) , further experiments were performed using only the RBD-FR and RBD-[SSG]-FR constructs.
