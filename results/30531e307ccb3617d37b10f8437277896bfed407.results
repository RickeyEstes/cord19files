Unless otherwise specified, we assumed the primary particles of the aggregates and the planar surface to be negatively charged for theoretical calculations, with zeta potentials same as those of polystyrene latex particles and glass surface used in Shen et al. [60] , respectively. Specifically, the zeta potentials for the latex particles were À87 mV, À81 mV, À30 mV, and À24 mV in 0.001 M, 0.01 M, Fig. 1 . Schematic of interactions of aggregates with planar surfaces. The aggregates I and II result in tetrahedral and octahedral coordination configurations, respectively. The aggregate III was created as a cluster of 20 spheres obtained by randomly placing them in the lattice sites of a simple cubic lattice by the Monte Carlo method. The aggregate IV was created by placing 18 small spheres of equal sizes on a large sphere surface. H is minimum separation distance between a primary particle and planar surface, dS is differential area element on the primary particle surface, dA is the projected area of dS on the planar surface, h is local distance of dS from the planar surface, n is unit outward normal to the surface and k is unit vector normal along the positive z-direction.
