We determined sequence diversity in the CD209 and CD209L genes ( fig. 1 ) as well as length variation of the neck region in 254 chromosomes originating from three major ethnic groups: sub-Saharan Africans, Europeans, and East Asians. In addition, the orthologous sequences were obtained in four chimpanzees, to infer the ancestral state at each site, to estimate the divergence between humans and chimpanzees, and to perform a number of interspecies neutrality tests.
