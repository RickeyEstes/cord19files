A total of 11,700 dentists with 207,831.11 person-years were accrued until December 31, 2009, when the follow-up examinations were terminated. During this period, 289 members died. By the time of the censored date, December 31, 2006, 18,664 internists with 963,791.51 person-years were included in this study. The basic demographic data of the study participants are summarized in Table 1 .The gender ratio of the participants was 3.25:1 (male:female), which is lower than that of the internists. More than half (53.2%) of the dentists practiced in the northern region, and 47.8% of the subjects were registered in areas with high physician-to-population ratios. About two-thirds of the subjects initiated their practice before 1995 and over 90% began to practice dentistry before the age of 30. The observed number of deaths and cause-specific SMRs for dentists are summarized in Table 2 . Nearly all of the SMRs of dentists are < 0.5 when compared with the general population of Taiwan. The crude death rate of the internists was higher than that of dentists (6.4% vs. 2.5%; Table 1 ), but this discrepancy disappeared after adjusting for age, gender, and the calendar year of beginning practice (Table 2) . When we applied a socioeconomically more comparable populationdthe internistsdas a reference group, the overall SMR of the dentists significantly increased (SMR Z 1.13; 95% CI Z 1.00e1.26) and the SMR of drowning was 6.62 with a 95% CI ranging from 2.15e15.45 (Table 2) . Dentists were also more likely to die from heart diseases (SMR Z 1.66; 95% CI Z 1.22e2.21). The SMRs of malignant neoplasm and cerebral vascular disease were marginally increased, although they did not reach a statistically significant level. We did not detect any significant increase in the SMRs for suicide, accidents, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia/influenza, HIVrelated diseases, or liver cirrhosis. To further adjust for other risk factors among dentists and internists, a Cox proportional hazard model was constructed and the results are summarized in Table 3 . Using the internists as the referents, the dentists appeared to show a higher overall hazard ratio of 1.17 (95% CI Z 1.01e1.37).
