A total of 1,021 NP microbiome profiles were obtained from 234 infants using 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures) . These included 487 ''healthy'' NP samples collected in the absence of respiratory symptoms and 534 ''infection'' NP samples collected during episodes of acute respiratory illness (ARI) during the first year of life. Three quarters of the infants (n = 177) contributed at least two healthy NP samples at the age of $2 months, $6 months, and/or $12 months. Eighty percent of the infants (n = 186) contributed a healthy sample before experiencing their first ARI. The 534 infection NP samples were from 184 infants who had experienced R 1 ARI within the first year of life. NP samples were analyzed from all (380/381) recorded LRI in this period and a random selection of 20% (154/782) of recorded episodes of upper respiratory illness (URI). The characteristics of the infants are summarized in Table S1 .
