Conserved domains exist in the 5 0 UTR of type 1 and 2 PRRSVs and their secondary structures have similar feature Five type 1 PRRSV strains (GenBank accession Nos. M96262, DQ489311, AY366525, EU076704 and AY588319)t and eleven type 2 PRRSV strains (GenBank accession Nos. AY150564, GQ330474, EF488048, EF112445, AF184212, EU109503, EU200962, U87392, EF112447, AY424271, and AF331831) were compared and aligned for their 5 0 UTR sequences using DNAstar software. The sequence alignment is presented in Fig. 1A . The 5 0 UTR sequence of type 1 PRRSV strains is 30 nt longer than that of type 2 strains. The nucleotide consensus sequence in the 5 0 UTR regions was identified for type 1 and type 2 strains and is boxed in Fig. 1A , designated as CS I, CS II, III and IV. The high-order structures of the PRRSV 5 0 UTR were analyzed using the Mfold program, followed by modification using the RNAviz software. The predicted secondary structures of the type 1 and type 2 PRRSV 5 0 UTR are shown in Fig. 1B (i) and (ii). They were characterized by six major putative helical stem-loops, which we arbitrarily designated as ESL1-5 for type 1 PRRSV and N-SL1-5 for type 2 PRRSV, respectively (Fig. 1B i and 1B ii) . The E-SL1 in type 1 PRRSV could be separated into two minor stem-loops, designated as E-SL1a and E-SL1b, which corresponded to N-SL1 in type 2 PRRSV. Similarly, NSL4 in type 2 PRRSV also could be divided into two minor stem-loops, named N-SL4a and N-SL4b, which corresponded to E-SL4 in type 1 PRRSV . Although the primary nucleotide sequences of these strains showed low sequence homology, their RNA secondary structures were similar, especially the most important leader TRS hairpin (LTH) parts, as shown by the shaded grey box in Fig. 1B , that is, the prominent N/E-SL5. Virus rescue, RNA synthesis and gene expression show quite different consequences for the mutants and the WT pAPRRS, pSHE and the mutant cDNA clones, pTLNd4, pPa2, pTLV8 and pSHSP5 were transfected into BHK-21 cells, and subsequently used to infect MARC-145 cells for identification of viral infectivity. When passaged in MARC-145 cells, pTLNd4 and pAPRRS developed CPE at 3-4dpi. When approximately 80% cytopathic effect (CPE) had developed, viral supernatants from the infected MARC-145 cells were harvested and designated vTLNd4 and vAPRRS (P1), respectively. Both the transfected BHK-21 cell monolayers and infected MARC-145 cell monolayers were examined via IFA using MAb against two genotypes of PRRSV N protein. The results revealed that the similar N protein expression level for pAPRRS and pTLNd4 tranfected wells. Moreover, N protein expression of type 1 WT, pSHE, showed comparable level with that of type 2 WT. while only a few isolated spots were found in pTLV8 and pPa2 transfected wells, as shown in Fig. 2C . However, none of the fluorescent signal could be detected in pSHSP5 transfected well. When transfectant supernatants were used to infect MARC-145 cells, vTLV8 showed a subtly different IFA pattern from that of vAPRRS. However, mutant pPa2 and chimeric pSHSP5 did not develop CPE even after the fifth passage in MARC-145 cells. The IFA result showed that pPa2 developed a PRRSV-specific fluorescent signal in a few of transfected BHK-21 cells but it did not show any infection of MARC-145 cells. N-specific fluorescent signal could not detected in pSHSP5 transfected BHK-21 cells and MARC-145 cells inoculated with supernatant collected from pSHSP5 transfected BHK-21 cells, as shown in Fig. 2C . To further confirm whether pSHSP5 was infectious, we repeated the transfection experiments using BHK-21 cells three more times and transferred the transfection supernatants to MARC-145 cells for three blind passages. No typical CPE were observed in the MARC-145 cells, and no viral genomic RNA was detected in either the total intracellular RNA or the culture supernatant by RT-PCR. This result suggested that the viral rescue of pPa2 and pSHSP5 did not occur in MARC-145 cells. Therefore, the insertion of the four nucleotides ''ttaa'' in front of TRS caused inactivation of the pPa2, while ''at'' insertion between TRS and translational initiation codon of ORF1 did not affect the production of infectious progeny virus.The replacement of 5 0 UTR of type 2 with 5 0 UTR of type 1 in the context of type 2 PRRSV clone did not affect virus viability. Otherwise, the converse replacement in a context of type 1 PRRSV was lethal. For the negative strand gRNA (( À ) gRNA) RT-PCR analysis, in order to detect whether the possible interferences from the input DNA and the RNA transcript generated by the CMV promoter, the RNAs extracted from pAS and WT transfected cells were used for RT-PCR, as our previously reported . The results in Fig. 2A showed that DNase I and RNase A could eliminate transfected input DNAs and the CMV-driven RNAs. Therefore the presence of the newly synthesized viral ( À ) gRNA could be detected. The results of the analysis of ( À) gRNA and sg mRNA7 are shown in Fig. 2B . RT-negative controls were also performed for all of the clones. After DNase I and RNase A digestion, nothing could be detected by the RT-PCR (data not shown). The levels of RNA synthesis levels of vTLNd4 showed almost no difference from those of WT. Otherwise the level of chimeric vTLV8 was reduced compared with vAPRRS. Remarkably, the level of RNA synthesis of the mutant pPa2 showed great similarity to that of pAPRRS, although it did not develop CPE in the tested cell cultures. For pSHSP5, ( À) gRNA could also be detected, but the synthesis level was largely reduced compared with pSHE, as shown in Fig. 2B . The leader-body junction PCR was performed for identification of sg mRNA7, using four primer pairs as follows, SF12/SR15284, SFLV1/SR15284, SFLV1/SRLV14835 and SF12/SRLV14835. The sg mRNA7 transcription level of vTLV8 dropped to 50% compared with pAPRRS, Otherwise, the sg mRNA7 could not be detected in pSHSP5 transfected cells, indicated that the sg mRNA transcription was dramatically impaired. Taken together, the results indicated that 5 0 UTR of type 1 PRRSV substitution did not affect type 2 PRRSV propogation in MARC-145 cells. The Chimera pTLV8 shared almost the similar RNA synthesis level and virological characteristics with the parental type 2 PRRSV strain, vAPRRS. However, the converse chimera pSHSP5, in which 5 0 UTR of a type 1 PRRSV was substituted with counterpart of the type 2 PRRSV, was lethal. Although the (-) gRNA replication could be detected, the replication level was significantly impaired and the sg mRNA transcription was absolutely abolished. Therefore, the type 1 5 0 UTR replacement could allow maintain fully functional activities of type 2 PRRSV. The virological properties and sg mRNA transcription level of vTLV8 are indistinguishable from those of the parental virus The chimeric virus vTLV8 and the other mutants were compared with the parental virus vAPRRS with regard to their titers, plaque morphology and growth profiles in MARC-145 cells. After 48 hpt in BHK-21 cells, the supernatants were harvested and used to infect MARC-145 cells for measurement of their titers. The results shown in Fig. 3A illustrate that the viral titer of the parental virus vAPRRS was 1 Â 10 3.67 TCID 50 /mL while the chimeric virus vTLV8 did not develop CPE in the first passage in MARC-145. The viral titer of the mutant vTLNd4 was 1 Â 10 2.23 TCID 50 /mL. In addition, the mutant pPa2 did not develop CPE. There were no differences in viral plaque morphology between vTLV8, vTLNd4, and vAPRRS, as shown in Fig. 3C . Although vTLV8 did not develop CPE in the first passage, the analysis of growth kinetics showed that vTLV8 had almost the same propagation state as vTLNd4 and vAPRRS (Fig. 3D) . In order to analyze the sg mRNA profiles of the MARC-145 cells infected by the mutant viruses, total intracellular RNAs were extracted from the P5 viral supernatants for Northern blotting analysis. The specific oligonucleotide biotin-labeled probes against type 2 PRRSV 3 0 UTR (PR3) and type 1 PRRSV 5 0 UTR (PLVR5) were designed to hybridize with the viral RNA. The sequences of the probes are displayed in Table 1 . The results demonstrated that the sg mRNAs of chimeric vTLV8 were recognized by both probes, and the sg mRNA7 was most abundant during the viral transcription process, as shown in Fig. 3B . The parental vAPRRS and mutant vTLNd4 were reacted with the type 2-specific probe PR3, not the type 1-specific probe PLVR5.
