Leukocytes of 50 children with recurrent respiratory infections and those of 50 controls were examined for interferon production after stimulation with different inducers. Interferon yields from cultures stimulated by adeno-, rhino-, corona-, or RS viruses or mycoplasma were statistically significantly lower for the patient cells than for those of the controls; influenza A virus showed a similar tendency with an almost statistically significant difference ( Table I ). The uneven distribution of the IFN titres in the two groups of children is shown in Fig. 1 . While leukocytes from all children showed interferon production after at least 3 different inducers, 11 of the patients and 2 controls showed no detectable production when stimulated with one or more of the remaining 3 inducers (Table II) . Furthermore, leukocytes from as many as 42 of the 50 patients produced an interferon yield below the lower percentile-10 level of the controls when stimulated by at least one of the 6 inducers. Among the 50 controls only 13 children belonged to this low-producer group. The inducer-specific difference between the patients and controls was supported by a designated mean IFN producing capacity of the children, estimated by calculating a geometric mean value for the yields after the 6 different inducers. Leukocytes from children with recurring respiratory infections showed significantly weaker IFN responses. No difference was noted between the patients with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections and patients with only frequent middle ear infections. The patients with ongoing respiratory tract infection or antibiotic treatment did not differ from the other patients in their in vitro IFN responses to different agents. The production of interferon was influenced by neither the age nor the sex of the children. Spontaneous IFN production was not detected in leukocyte cultures of either patients or controls.
