Performance evaluation of predictive models during 10-fold cross validation Viral siRNA prediction modelshave been developed using various siRNA sequence features including mono, di, tri, tetra, penta nucleotide frequencies, binary pattern of nucleotides, thermodynamic properties and secondary structure. During 10-fold cross validation using SVM we achieved a maximum correlation of 0.19, 0.32, 0.42, 0.43, 0.46, 0.19, 0.26, 0.07 respectively for the above-mentioned individual features, between predicted and actual efficacy of viral siRNAs. We employed different features like nucleotide frequency (mono to penta) and positional (binary) as well as structural and thermodynamic features on viral siRNA training dataset consisting of 1380 (T 1380 ) sequences. During 10-fold cross validation using SVM, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) increased from 0.19 to 0.46 while moving from individual mono to pentanucleotide frequency features respectively. The binary feature performed similar to mononucleotide frequency. The thermodynamic properties showed marginal correlations with siRNA inhibition while secondary structural features did not work. Also, we found that hybrid models (frequency-binary and frequency-binary-thermo) performed better compared to other features used individually. Amongst the hybrid models, PCC was found to increase by combining frequency, binary and thermodynamic feature vectors (0.55) as compared to hybrid frequency (0.48), hybrid frequency-binary (0.50) or hybrid frequency-binary-thermo-secondary structural features (0.53) as shown in Table 1 . We also used other machine learning algorithms like ANN, KNN and REP Tree to check their performance on the experimental viral siRNA data using the above mentioned features. During 10-fold cross validation, PCC increased from 0.10 to a maximum of 0.30 from mono to pentanucleotide frequency in all the three cases. Here also the binary and secondary structural features did not perform well, confirming our earlier results using SVM. However while using a combination of features (frequencybinary and frequency-binary-thermo) in hybrid models, the correlation performance increased from 0.30 to 0.46 for ANN, 0.31 to 0.48 for KNN and 0.31 to 0.35 for REP Tree (Table 1) . However SVM performed better compared to other machine learning algorithms in all the cases and was thus chosen for model development. Performance evaluation of predictive models on independent 345 viral siRNA dataset Besides 10-fold cross validation, we also checked the performance of our algorithms on independent dataset of 345 siRNAs (V 345 ) on the above models as shown in the Table 2 . Here again, the binary and secondary structural features did not perform well while the model based on thermodynamic features showed a marginal (Table 2) .
