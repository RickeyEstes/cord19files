Juglanin ameliorates UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis. uVB exposure has been known to stimulate hyperplasia or infiltration of inflammatory cells into animal skin (19) . Therefore, the present study explored the role of juglanin in uVB-induced skin carcinogenesis. notably, 72 h after exposure to solar-simulated uV radiation, when erythema development was most obvious, the skin of the juglanin-treated mice exhibited no apparent erythema compared with the mice in the mod group ( fig. 1a) . Having established the effects of juglanin on uVB-induced skin injury, the present study explored the effects of 600 mj/cm 2 figure 2. effects of juglanin on uVB-induced p38/jnK and Pi3K/aKt signaling activity. Western blotting was conducted and relative protein expression levels of (a) p-p38 and p-jnK, and (B) Pi3K, p-aKt and p-mtor were determined. data are presented as the means ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. ## P<0.01 and ### P<0.001 compared with the Con group; * P<0.05, ** P<0.01 and *** P<0.001 compared with the Mod group. AKT, protein kinase B; con, control; jnK, c-jun n-terminal kinase; jugH, high juglanin; jugl, low juglanin; mod, model; mtor, mammalian target of rapamycin; p-, phosphorylated; Pi3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; uVB, ultraviolet B. 1B) . uVB exposure led to upregulated epidermal thickness in the mod group, as well as the infiltration of inflammatory cells compared with in the control mice ( fig. 1c) . following uVB exposure, administration of juglanin (10 and 20 mg/kg to mice) led to the suppression of epidermal hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration compared with in the mod group ( fig. 1c) . Ki67 expression was assessed in the skin of uVB-induced mice administered juglanin. in mice in the mod group, the expression levels of Ki67 were markedly higher compared with in the control mice. However, juglanin treatment significantly downregulated KI67 expression in the skin of uVB-exposed mice compared with in the mod group ( fig. 1d) . taken together, these results suggested that juglanin exerts potential effects on the amelioration of uVB-stimulated skin carcinogenesis in animals. Juglanin suppresses UVB-induced p38/JNK and PI3K/AKT activity. Phosphorylation of p38 and jnK is an indicator of cellular stress following exposure to uV radiation (20) . therefore, the phosphorylated levels of p38 and jnK were investigated in the present study. the results suggested that p38 and jnK phosphorylation levels were increased in mice following uV exposure compared with in the control group ( fig. 2a) . However, juglanin treatment significantly reduced the increased expression of p-p38 and p-jnK compared with in the mod group ( fig. 2a ). in addition, the Pi3K/aKt signaling pathway figure 3. effects of juglanin on uVB-induced inflammation. (A) Western blotting was conducted and relative expression levels of the following inflammation-associated proteins, tnf-α, il-1β, il-18 and p-nf-κB , were determined. (B) reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to determine the mRNA expression levels of inflammation-associated genes, IL-1β and il-18. (c) immunohistochemical analysis of tnf-α was conducted on 5-µm sections. representative photomicrographs from each group were shown (scale bar, 100 µm). (D) Immunofluorescence analysis of p-nf-κB was conducted on tissue sections. representative photomicrographs from each group were shown (scale bar, 100 µm). data are presented as the means ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. ### P<0.001 compared with the Con group; ** P<0.01 and *** P<0.001 compared with the Mod group. con, control; il, interleukin; jugH, high juglanin; jugl, low juglanin; mod, model; nf-κB, nuclear factor-κB; p-, phosphorylated; tnf-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; uVB, ultraviolet B. has been reported to be involved in uV exposure-induced skin cancer (21) . in the present study, Pi3K was activated in the mod group, whereas juglanin reduced Pi3K expression. in addition, uV-induced p-aKt expression was downregulated by juglanin in a dose-dependent manner ( fig. 2B ). mtor is regulated by the Pi3K/aKt signaling pathway, and is closely associated with cancer progression (22) . finally, the present study demonstrated that upregulated mtor phosphorylation was induced by uV, and was downregulated in the juglanin-treated groups (Fig. 2B) . These findings indicated that p38/JNK and Pi3K/aKt may be involved in the inhibitory effects of juglanin on skin cancer.
