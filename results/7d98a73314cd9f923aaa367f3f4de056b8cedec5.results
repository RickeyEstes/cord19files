IFIT1 co-precipitates IFIT2 and IFIT3 independently of RNA association IFIT1 was originally identified as an RNA binding protein after being precipitated by 5´-ppp RNA from lysates of IFN stimulated HEK293 cells. IFIT2 and IFIT3, as well as several well-characterised RNA binding proteins, co-precipitated with IFIT1 (12) . We used SILAC proteomics to examine if IFIT1 could interact directly with IFIT2 and IFIT3 in nuclease treated lysates from IFN-stimulated cells. HEK293 cells were passaged in differentially isotopically labelled media and transfected with either a plasmid author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Preparation of nuclease treated cell lysates and pull-down experiments are described in Materials and Methods. Consistent with previous reports (38) , IFIT1 was poorly overexpressed while IFIT5 was strongly expressed ( Figure S1 ). However, as shown in Figure 1A , IFIT2 and IFIT3 co-precipitated with FLAG-tagged IFIT1, while FLAG-tagged IFIT5 did not precipitate other IFIT family members ( Figure 1B ). The full SILAC data set is available on the PRIDE server. These results independently confirm the interaction of IFIT1, 2 and 3 in IFN-stimulated cell lysates and further demonstrate that this interaction is maintained after nuclease treatment. Both IFIT2 and IFIT3 were enriched to a similar extent in the IFIT1 pull downs ( Figure 1A ).
