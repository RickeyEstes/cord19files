Considering the geographical distribution (Fig. 1) , 16 animals were caught in Northern Portugal mainly in the natural areas of Peneda-Geres National Park; and also Montesinho and Douro Internacional natural parks; cats from the center of the country were mainly from Serra da Estrela Natural Park with the exception of one animal from Serra de S. Mamede Natural Park. The remaining samples (LTE/serum = 37; stool = 21) were from 41 animals caught in Alentejo and Algarve in the South, including the Vale do Guadiana Natural Park (n = 21) and the Natura 2000 area of Moura Barrancos (n = 5). FeLV p27 antigen was detected in 13/50 samples (26%), FCoV RNA was present in 6/28 samples (21.4%) and FPV DNA in 2/28 samples (7.1%) ( Table 1) . CDV RNA was not detected (n = 13). CDV antibodies were detected in 2/26 samples (7.7%); FIV (n = 50) and FCoV (n = 26) antibodies were not detected. Feral cats (F. s. catus) showed a higher frequency of FeLV antigen (33.3%) and FPV DNA (20%), and wild cats (F. s. silvestris) of FCoV RNA (33.3%). Among the 16 samples analyzed from North and Central Portugal (12 LTE/serum and 7 stool samples), one sample from a feral cat (n = 4) and one sample of a wildcat (n = 6) were positive for FeLV Ag. FCoV RNA was found in one sample (1/4) from a wild cat and one sample from a feral cat (1/2) was positive for FPV DNA. FeLV was detected throughout the country including all the natural parks sampled. Presence of FPV was confirmed in Vale do Guadiana and Serra da Estrela. The priority areas for Iberian lynx included in the survey -S. Mamede, Moura Barrancos and Guadiana -showed presence of FeLV, FPV and FCoV. CDV seropositive samples were also from this area (2/17 of wild cats). Southern districts (Alentejo and Algarve) contributed with 41 animals (36 LTE/serum samples; 19 stool samples). FeLV antigen was found in 5/15 of feral cats and 6/21 of wild cats. FCoV RNA was found in 1/9 samples from feral cats and in 4/10 samples of wild cats. FPV DNA was only found in 1/9 samples of feral cats.
