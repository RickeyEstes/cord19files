Of 62 patient cases corresponding to the World Health Organization case definition of probable SARS, five patients died and another three were not Vietnamese. As a result, 44 of the remaining 54 SARS patients after recovery (Cases), 103 individuals who had contact with SARS patients (Contacts) and 50 without contact (No contacts) were included within this study. DNA samples from two of 103 Contacts showed inconclusive genotyping results and were excluded from the present analysis. We primarily compared the Cases with Contacts, No contacts, or both. Subsequently all Cases and 16 of the 101 Contacts were revealed to have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies in their blood and we secondarily analyzed them together with SARS patients as the Infected group (n ϭ 44 ϩ 16) and compared with the Uninfected group (n ϭ 101 Ϫ 16). Allele frequencies of HLA class I and class II genes in each group were first represented by low resolution (twodigit) typing and are listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. When the number of comparisons was considered at each locus, HLA class I genes did not show any significant association (p c Ͼ 0.10). On the other hand, among HLA class II genes, HLA-DRB1*12 showed positive association (p ϭ 0.0032, p c ϭ 0.042), and HLA-DRB1*13 showed marginally negative association (p ϭ 0.0069, pC ϭ 0.090) when the SARS group was compared with the Contacts. A similar tendency was observed when the SARS group was compared with the No-contacts as well. However, the same alleles did not show any strong association when the Infected group was compared with Uninfected. HLA-DRB1*1202 allele was the only allele of HLA-DRB1*12 identified in this population by higher resolution (four-digit) typing (Table 3) . When the Contacts and No-contacts were collected together as a single control group, HLA-DRB1*1202 showed further significant association (p ϭ 0.0011, p c ϭ 0.014, data not shown). In our previous population-based study on Vietnamese HLA alleles, the frequency of HLA-DRB1*1202 allele in 170 healthy Hanoi citizens was 0.353 [13] . The frequency of HLA-DRB1*1202 in our SARS patients (0.466) remained higher than that of the general population in Hanoi. Under the dominant model, HLA-DRB1*1202 was the most strongly associated with SARS as shown in Table 4 (p c ϭ 0.0065 and 0.0052 depending on the controls to be compared). HLA-DRB1*13 was composed of DRB1*1301, *1302 and *1303 but no single alleles were further associated with the disease (Table  3) . HLA association between the Infected and Uninfected groups did not exceed any association of HLA alleles observed between the Cases and Contacts (Tables 1 and 2 ). Possible association of HLA polymorphism with severity of SARS was not investigated in this study because of the small numbers in each subgroup. No significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed in the control populations (p Ͼ 0.10).
