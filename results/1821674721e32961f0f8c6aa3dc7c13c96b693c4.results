Headache was the most common symptom (13 patients, 76%), followed by fever and vomiting (eight cases each, 47%). Upon admission to hospital, eight patients (47%) were confused and/or agitated, two patients (12%) were lethargic, and another two (12%) were fully comatose. Meningeal signs were detected in seven patients (41%). The mean time from admission to death was 9.3 days (95%CI: 2.4-16.2). Cryptococcal infection was considered the first clinical diagnostic option in only 4/17 (23%) of the confirmed cases, whereas it was included in the differential diagnosis in eight patients (47%). Antifungal treatment (fluconazole or Amphotericin B) had been prescribed to seven patients but to only five of the clinically suspected cases. Seven of the patients (41%) died within 72 hours of admission, and 12 out of the 16 HIV-positive patients (75%) died within one week of admission. The clinical records of the remaining 267 cases included in this study were reviewed for clinical diagnosis of cryptococcal infection. Among these, three HIV-infected patients were clinically diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis, but no evidence of cryptococcal infection was found in the autopsy (the cause of death was identified as toxoplasmosis in two cases and tuberculosis in one case). Table 2 shows the final cause of death, the cryptococcal species, other associated diagnoses identified in the CDA, as well as the results of the PAS staining, Cryptococcus real time PCR and CrAg test in the different samples analysed. Identification of the cryptococcal species was successful in 15 out of the 17 cases. In two cases, the tissue samples provided insufficient DNA to perform IGS amplification and sequencing. Interestingly, among the 15 cases identified, five (33%) were C. gattii whereas the remaining cases (66.6%) were C. neoformans var. grubii.
