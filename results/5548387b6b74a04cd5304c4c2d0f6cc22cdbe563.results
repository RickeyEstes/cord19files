Each of the 10 participants committed at least one breach of standard airborne and contact isolation precautions. These breaches were classified as either risk factors detected during the PPE donning and doffing processes (Table 1) or risk factors observed while the HCW was in the room with the patient ( Table 2 ). The most common breaches in PPE donning were not conducting a seal check on the respirator, failing to tie the gown at both the neck and the waist, and donning the equipment in the improper sequence. The most common breaches in PPE doffing were related to the sequence of equipment removal, removing the respirator, and removing potentially contaminated items from the room. The most common breaches detected in the patient room included touching unprotected areas of the participant's own body with contaminated PPE and the unnecessary touching of surfaces in the room during patient care activities. Other observations noted by the reviewers included one instance of an HCW adjusting both the respiratory protection and the protective goggles with contaminated gloved hands during simulated patient care. The participant complained of visual disturbance from condensation in the goggles. In addition, 6 participants touched various surfaces in the room for no reason. In one notable case, the participant who touched various surfaces did not use proper glove-in-glove technique or the recommended doffing sequence. Flourescent marker contamination was documented on 8 of the 10 participants after completion of the simulation experience. Six participants had contamination on the hands, 3 participants had contamination on the back of the head, and one participant had contamination on both the hands and the head.
