Protein dimers and higher oligomers in detergent micelles. Vpu-WT and mutant Vpu proteins were expressed in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 1 ). SDS-Page analysis from cells expressing Vpu-WT revealed four bands (Fig. 2a, lane 1) . The SDS-PAGE analysis of the double mutants Vpu-DD and Vpu-NN, which lack phosphate groups at the serines, showed only a single band each on the SDS-PAGE at various molecular weights due to the decreased migration rate of the negative charged Vpu-DD upon denaturation (Fig. 2a , lanes 3 and 9) 28, 29 . Vpu-52D and Vpu-56D each show two bands ( Fig. 2a lanes 5 and 7) . Taken together, these results indicate that the four bands of Vpu-WT represent the following from high to low molecular weight, (i) phosphorylation of both of the serines, Ser-52 and Ser-56, (ii) single phosphorylated serines at position 56 and (iii) position 52, and (iv) fully non-phosphorylated serines. The ratio between phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated Vpu remains the same as found in measurements directly from cell pellets using anti-strep-tag antibody for Vpu in Western blot (data not shown). The thrombin enzyme cleaves the strep-His8 fusion tag from Vpu-WT and the mutants ( Fig. 2a lanes 2 , 4, 8 and 10 and Supplementary Fig. S1 ). The pattern mentioned for uncleaved Vpu does not seem to be affected by thrombin treatment. The fusion tag-free Vpu was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography and eluted with four peaks (Fig. 2b) . Vpu-WT showed two peaks, a smaller peak at 9.5 ml representing large protein/detergent complexes (P 1 in Fig. 2b ) and a larger peak representing smaller protein/detergent complexes (P 2 in Fig. 2b ) at 13.5 ml. Mutant Vpu-56D shows a similar pattern. For Vpu-52D and Vpu-DD the peak of the large complexes was not resolved. Vpu-NN showed the peak of the large complexes being larger than that of the smaller complexes. SDS-PAGE analysis identified the two peaks representing Vpu protein and its respective mutations (Fig. 2c) . The third and fourth peaks correspond to thrombin and strep-His8 fusion tags, respectively. Multi-angle light scattering analysis identified that P 1 and P 2 correspond to molecular weights of 174.7 ± 18.4 kDa and 18.0 ± 1.9 kDa, respectively ( Table 1 ). The respective averaged oligomeric state was calculated to be around 19.0 ± 2.0 for P 1 and 2.0 ± 0.2 for P 2 . Thus, Vpu is able to exist in two oligomeric states, which are most likely a dimer and higher oligomer. Modulation of the dynamics of Vpu-WT, Vpu-NN and Vpu-DD oligomerization by the two phosphorylation sites. After purification of the proteins from a stock solution, the peak ratio between the higher oligomer (referring to P 1 ) and the dimer (referring to P 2 ) for Vpu-WT and Vpu-DD was in favor of the dimer for all ionic strengths investigated, 50, 150 and 300 mM NaCl (Fig. 3a) . The peak of the higher oligomer is the largest at the highest ionic strength of 300 mM NaCl for the two proteins. The peak area of the higher oligomer was largest for Vpu-NN at all ionic strengths (Fig. 3b) . Higher ionic strength screens the negative charges at the serine sites and even the partial charges of the amide group in asparagine indicating electrostatic type interaction modulates assembly. Immediately after purification of Vpu-WT from a stock solution, the peak of the dimer was larger than that of the higher oligomer (Fig. 4a, top graph) . Repeating the purification from the stock solution over a period of 12 days revealed a gradual increase in the higher oligomer. A slower increase in the peak of the higher oligomer was observed for Vpu-DD. Purification after 7 days showed just the beginning of a small peak for the dimer (Fig. 4a , middle graph, green line). In the case of Vpu-NN, the peak of the higher oligomer was larger than that of the dimer from the first day of the experiment and increased even more over three days, finally reaching a plateau over a longer period (Fig. 4a , lower graph). The dynamics data was plotted as area of the peak of the higher oligomer (A P1 ), divided by the total area of A P1 and the peak area of the dimer (A P2 ), A P1 /(A P1 + A P2 ), over time for Vpu-WT with a double logarithmic growth curve (Fig. 4b , black and Table 2 ). Vpu-DD (Fig. 4b , red) and Vpu-NN (Fig. 4b , blue) can both be fitted with a single function (see also Table 2 ). Vpu-NN (c = 1.05 day −1 ) and Vpu-DD (c = 0.56 day −1 ) mark a fast and slow increase in the area of the higher oligomer, respectively. Vpu-WT exhibited a fast increase (c = 2.35 day −1 ) first, followed by a slow increase (c = 0.31 day −1 ), similar to the afore-mentioned growth rates of Vpu-NN and Vpu-DD, respectively. As a result, Vpu-DD, due to their negative charges at the two serine sites tended to assemble very slowly reaching a final assembly ratio of a = 0.22, whilst Vpu-NN, having charges removed at the site of the two serines, assembled very quickly reaching the largest assembly ratio of a = 0.78. Therefore, the fast increase in the peak of the higher oligomer of Vpu-WT should be due to the assembly of non-phosphorylated Vpu, whilst the slower increase of that peak should be due to the assembly of both, single and double phosphorylated Vpu proteins. The single phosphorylated Vpu proteins obscure the plot in as much they show 'mixed' assembly dynamics. The negative charges of the phosphorylated serine site slowdown or even prevent oligomerization.
