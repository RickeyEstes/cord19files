Generation of chimaeric rIBVs with the replicase gene from Beaudette and the rest of the genome M41-CK A full-length IBV-derived cDNA, within the vaccinia virus genome, was generated by homologous recombination using the TDS method and consisted of the replicase gene from the apathogenic IBV strain Beau-R and the structural and accessory genes plus the 39-UTR from the pathogenic M41 strain of IBV. This was achieved using a Beau-R-based receiver sequence consisting of the complete replicase gene, followed by the first 376 nt of the S gene fused to the N gene and 39-UTR (Fig. 1) . The donor sequence consisted of the last 1246 nt of the Beau-R replicase gene fused to M41-CK-derived cDNA from the S gene to the poly(A) tail ( Fig. 1 ). Following TDS, DNA was extracted from 20 rVVs, potentially containing the chimaeric IBV full-length cDNA. Analysis by PCR, using GPT specific primers to confirm the loss of the E. coli GPT gene, on six of the rVV DNAs confirmed the loss of the GPT gene following the second TDS recombination event (Fig. 1 ). The IBV cDNAs within these six rVV DNAs were analysed (1) for the presence of the M41-CK-derived 39-UTR sequence, which is 184 nt shorter than the Beau-R 39-UTR [42] , (2) the junction between the replicase and S gene using oligonucleotides BG40 and BG134 and (3) for the presence of the M41-CK-derived M gene using oligonucleotides BG52 (59-24945 GAATGGTGTTCTT-TATTG 24962 -39) and BG146 (59-25549 TCTAACACTC-TAAGTTGAG 25567 -39); to confirm that the second TDS recombination event had not resulted in generation of the starting receiver sequence (Fig. 1 ). Two rVVs, rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 and rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-12, that did contain the M41-CK-derived 39-UTR and M gene were further screened by spot sequence analysis of the IBV cDNA to confirm that the region downstream of the Beau-R replicase gene had been replaced with the corresponding sequence from M41-CK; the sequences were as expected for the required chimaeric IBV sequence.
