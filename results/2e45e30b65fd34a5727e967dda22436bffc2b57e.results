the bovine ceA gene family. In order to identify bovine CEACAMs we performed similarity searches using three different bovine genomic sequence databases (Bos taurus, Bos indicus and Bos grunniens) using Blast and Blat algorithms as described previously 8 . By comparing data from these genomes, we predicted the coding sequence (CDS) of eight CEACAM genes and two pseudo genes. We identified orthologous genes to human CEACAM1, CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19, CEACAM20 and three putatively functional CEACAM1 paralogs, CEACAM32, CEACAM33, and CEACAM35. The two putative pseudogenes have stop codons in multiple exons, indicating that they do not encode functional proteins. According to the current genome assembly in Ensembl (Cow (UMD3.1)) the chromosomal location of the CEA gene family is syntenic to the CEA gene family in other mammals located in the extended leucocyte receptor complex on chromosome 18 (Fig. 1A) . CEACAM1 is the only member of the CEA gene family located between TGFB1 and LIPE. All CEACAM1 paralogs including one pseudogene are positioned in one cluster flanked by the CD79A and XRCC1 genes (Fig. 1B) . The second pseudogene is a CEACAM18 paralog located next to the CEACAM18 gene within the SIGLEC cluster (Fig. 1B) . The location of the orthologous genes CEACAM16, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 is similar as in other mammals 7, 8 . The orthologous CEACAM genes CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 have the same exon arrangement as previously described in other mammals 8 (Fig. S1 ). In contrast, CEACAM1 in cattle does not contain a B domain exon (255 bp) commonly found in other mammalian CEACAM1 genes as previously described 23 . The CEACAM1 paralog CEACAM32 has a unique transmembrane domain which significantly differs from the transmembrane domains found in CEA gene family members with immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) or immune receptor tyrosine-based activation-like motifs (ITAM-like). CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 contain a transmembrane domain, which is very similar to that of human CEACAM3, CEACAM4, and CEACAM21. Human CEACAM3 and CEACAM4 have a cytoplasmic tail with an ITAM-like motif encoded by four exons. Similar exons could be identified in the CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 genes. CEACAM35 is the only CEACAM1 paralog which contains a B domain exon in cattle (Fig. S1 ). CEACAM34 described in a previous paper 8 is no longer in the Whole-genome shotgun contigs (wgs) database at NCBI which is in accordance with our inability to amplify any fragment with CEACAM34-specific primers from cDNA of different tissues or genomic DNA from different cattle. These results suggest that CEACAM34 does not exist as a separate gene in the cattle genome or that the sequence information previously available was incomplete. A detailed depiction of the exon arrangement of all CEACAM genes is shown in Figs. 1C and S1A. Differential expression of bovine CEACAM1 paralogs. First, we designed primers for the bovine housekeeping gene GAPDH. The primer pair was designed to amplify a specific fragment of GAPDH mRNA-derived cDNA and a fragment of genomic DNA from the GAPDH gene but not from a processed pseudogene. Both fragments differ in size and therefore could be used to detect and quantify genomic DNA contamination in the cDNA preparations (Table 1 , Fig. 2A ). Next, we designed CEACAM-specific primers (Table 1) complementary to individual leader exon and N domain exon sequences. Using these primers we screened the expression of bovine CEACAMs in different candidate tissues, including liver, lung, skin, kidney, rumen, small intestine, large intestine, spleen, udder, tonsils, lymph nodes, granulocytes and lymphocytes. CEACAM32 mRNA was detected in testis but not in any other tissue tested (Fig. 2B) . Expression of CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 was detected in bovine granulocytes isolated from peripheral blood (Fig. 2C) and at low level in other tissues (data not shown). To substantiate our prediction of the exon composition of the CEACAM32 gene we performed 3′ RACE experiments starting from the N domain exon to identify the 3′ end of CEACAM32 cDNA. Sequencing of the cDNA obtained by 3′ RACE, revealed that the CEACAM32 mRNA encodes a unique transmembrane domain, which contains a stop codon and a poly A signal, resulting in a very short 3′ untranslated region. Based on the 3′ sequence of CEACAM32 cDNA we designed primers for the amplification of full length CEACAM32 cDNA which was then cloned and sequenced ( Table 1 ). The CEACAM32 mRNA (GenBank accession no. MH684294) codes for a single isoform (Fig. 2D ) composed of a leader sequence, an IgV-like domain (N domain), an IgC-like domain (A2 type domain), a transmembrane domain and an extremely short cytoplasmic domain consisting of four amino acids. Amplification and sequencing of the full length CEACAM33 cDNA indicated that four different splice isoforms exists (Fig. 2D ). However, we could only confirm two of these isoforms by cDNA cloning. One CEACAM33 splice variant contains the ITAM-like motif (GenBank accession no. MH684295), while another isoform (GenBank accession no. MH684296) lacks the transmembrane domain indicating that it encodes a secreted protein (Fig. 2E) . CEACAM35 (GenBank accession no. MH684297) exist as one isoform (Fig. 2D ) composed of a leader exon, an N domain exon, one IgC-like domain (A1 type) exon, a transmembrane domain exon and four cytoplasmic domain exons. The four cytoplasmic domain exons code for a ITAM-like motif slightly different from the ones found in CEACAM33 cDNA. The B domain exon of the CEACAM35 gene identified as a putatively spliceable exon in the genome (Fig. 1C ) was found to be not included in analyzed mRNAs. The putative proteins encoded by bovine CEACAM1 and its paralogous genes are depicted in Fig. 2E. phylogenetic relationship of bovine ceAcAMs. We compared the IgV-like (N domain) exon nucleotide sequences of all bovine CEACAMs (Fig. 3A) . The CEACAM N domains of CEACAM1 paralogs cluster together with those of the CEACAM1a and b alleles while the N domain exon sequences of conserved CEACAMs are more distantly related. The N domain exon sequence of the inhibitory receptor CEACAM1 was most closely related to that of the activating receptor CEACAM33 followed by the second activating receptor CEACAM35. The N domain exon sequence of CEACAM32 showed the greatest difference to that of the N domain exon of CEACAM1 and of all CEACAM1 paralogs (Fig. 3A) . We further determined the relationship of IgC-like domain exons of bovine CEACAMs (Fig. S3 ). CEACAM1 and CEACAM33 contain two IgC-like domains of the A1 and A2 type. CEACAM35 is composed of an A1 and a B domain. The IgC-like domains of CEACAM32 and the CEACAMps are of the A2 type (Figs. 1C; S3). Next, we analyzed the relationship of the transmembrane exon nucleotide sequences of bovine CEACAM1 paralogs with that of other species (Fig. 3B ). As previously observed, two main forms of transmembrane domain exons can be discerned: one cluster is composed of TM domain exon sequences present in genes encoding ITIM motifs and the other containing the transmembrane domain exons associated with exons which encode a ITAM-like signaling motif. The transmembrane domain exon sequence of CEACAM32 is more closely related to the CEACAM1-related transmembrane domain exon sequence but is clearly separated from the CEACAM1 transmembrane exon cluster (Fig. 3B ). When we compared all identified N domain exons of CEACAM32 with N domain exons from CEACAM1 and closely related CEACAM1 paralogs of selected mammalian species we found that all CEACAM32 N domain exons cluster together while N domain exons of CEACAM1 and other bovine CEACAM1 paralogs formed a separated cluster (Fig. 3C ). phylogenetic history of the bovine ceA gene family. We used the composition of mobile elements within the different bovine CEACAM genes to analyze the phylogenetic history of bovine CEACAMs (Figs. S4, S5). CEACAM33 contains most of the elements at the same positions as in CEACAM35 indicating that CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 are the result of a duplication event. Interestingly further modifications of CEACAM33 seem to have taken place, since the B domain exon is replaced by an A2 domain exon, which is most closely related to the A2 domain exon of CEACAM1 and/or CEACAMps (Fig. S3 ). The mobile elements around the N domain exons (i.e. in introns 1 and 2) suggest a close relationship between CEACAM1 and CEACAM32. On the other hand, a similar origin of the transmembrane domain exon of these two genes is not supported by the surrounding mobile elements (Fig. S4 ). Based on the mobile elements found in the CEACAM1-related pseudogene it is closer related with the ITAM containing CEACAMs, CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 than with CEACAM1 and CEACAM32 (Fig. S4 ). Mobile elements of conserved CEACAMs indicate that the duplication of CEACAM18 was a rather recent event and that the other conserved CEACAMs evolved separately for quite a while (Fig. S5 ). The loss of the B domain exon in bovine CEACAM1, the integration of different artiodactyl-specific mobile elements (Fig. 4) , and the cooption of the transmembrane domain exon of CEACAM32 into the ruminant CEA gene family are additional genetic markers which allowed further analysis of the evolutionary history of the bovine CEA gene family. Previously we have speculated that B domain exon loss is due to the insertion of mobile elements 23 (Fig. 4) . However, when we analyzed CEACAM1 from other artiodactyls, i.e. pig (Sus scrofa), alpaca (Vicugna pacos), and the Wild Bactrian (Camelus ferus) and Arabian camel (Camelus dromedarus), two old world camelids, we also did not find B domain exons in the CEACAM1 genes ( Fig. 5A; www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ years ago (mya). On the other hand, similar mobile elements as found in the A1-A2 intron of bovine CEACAM1 were detected in CEACAM1 of goats (Capra hircus), sheep (Ovis aries) and giraffe (Giraffa Camelopardalis tippelskirchi) but not in CEACAM1 of pigs and camelids (Fig. 5A ). This suggests that the B domain exon loss occurred before mobile elements were integrated into the A1-A2 intron of the common ancestor of ruminant CEACAM1. Furthermore, in the data base CEACAM35 has a complete B domain exon while CEACAM33 contains only part of the B domain exon from the 5′ region (Fig. 5B ). This indicates that the duplication event which created CEACAM35 took place before the CEACAM1-like ancestor lost its B domain. CEACAM33 seems to be younger than CEACAM35 and may have been evolved by duplication of a CEACAM35 ancestor followed by further modifications. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ A close relative of the transmembrane domain exon of bovine CEACAM32 was found in bovidae, cervidae and in some giraffidae i.e. in okapi but not in giraffe and not in suidae and camelidae. This data suggests that the birth of CEACAM32 took place in the most recent ancestor of ruminants. Two different CEACAM1 alleles exist in cattle, CEACAM1a (GenBank accession no. AY345127) and CEACAM1b (GenBank accession no. AY487416). The alleles differ mainly in their N exon sequences by a number of non-synonymous mutations and most remarkably by an in frame 9-nucleotide deletion in the CEACAM1a allele. Interestingly, the CEACAM1a allele was found in the wgs database for Bos taurus and Bos indicus but not for Bos grunniens, Bison bison, and Bubalus bubalis. In contrast, the CEACAM1b allele was found in the database of all five bovine species. Taken together, this indicates that the CEACAM1b allele is the original bovine CEACAM1 allele and that the CEACAM1a allele appeared first in the ancestor of domestic cattle 0.2-1 mya 4 ago. Concerted evolution and gene conversion between CEACAM1 paralogs. The phylogenetic analysis of the N domains of bovine CEACAM1 paralogs indicates that the N domains of CEACAM1, CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 exhibit concerted evolution while the N domain of CEACAM32 evolved independently. To better understand the mechanism that allows the independent evolution of CEACAM32 we analyzed recombination and gene conversion events that may have taken place between bovine CEACAM1 paralogs. First, we searched the protein-coding region of bovine CEACAM1 paralogs using GARD. Three breakpoints were identified one was in the leader sequence one in the N domain and one in the A1 domain exon. When we compared the www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ sequences between these breakpoints, we observed that CEACAM32 differs from CEACAM1, CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 in particular in the N and in the first IgC-like domain exons (Fig. 6A ). Next, we used the PipMaker software to compare the whole sequences of the CEACAM1 paralogous genes. As shown in Fig. 6B CEACAM32 Human tRNA GLU TCCCTGGTGGTCTAGTGGTTAGGATTCGGCGCTCTCACCGCCGCGGGCCCGGGTTCGATTCCCGGTCAGGGAACCA ******* **** *********** ** ***** **** **** ************ ** ** **** ****** * CHR-1 consensus (type I) www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and CEACAM1 N exon sequences differ strongly. However, high similarity between CEACAM1 and CEACAM32 was found in the intron sequences particular around the N domain exon (Fig. 6B upper panel) . In contrast, sequence similarities between CEACAM1 and CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 were most pronounced in the exon sequences ( Fig. 6C middle and lower panels) . Finally, we used GENCONV to detect putative gene conversion events between CEACAM1, CEACAM32, CEACAM33, CEACAM35 and CEACAMps1. 23 gene conversion events were detected by GENECONV in the region starting at the leader exon and ending after ~1000 nucleotides of the intron following the N domain exon (Fig. 7 and Table 2) ). Gene conversion events were detected for all CEACAM1 paralogs at the N domain exon except for CEACAM32 (Fig. 7) . Remarkably, gene conversion between CEACAM32 and other CEACAM1 paralogs were detected, but they were restricted to the leader exon and the intron sequence following the N domain exon (Fig. 7) . We used only the region of the CEACAM1 paralogs for the analysis of gene conversion where the sequence similarity was high enough to guarantee a high quality alignment. All gene conversion events located around the N domain exon have a high statistical support Table 2 . These results demonstrate that CEACAM32 is still involved in gene conversion and, therefore, in concerted evolution of CEACAM1 paralogs, however, since gene conversion only affects noncoding regions and the leader exon of CEACAM32, the mature CEACAM32 protein has escaped concerted evolution. The nucleotide sequence of CEACAM1 starting -2000 bp upstream of exon 1 including exons encoding the extracellular part was compared with that of the corresponding region of CEACAM1 paralogs. For contiguous stretches of nucleotides conserved between the gene pairs using a sliding window, the degree of identity was calculated and displayed as horizontal lines. The location of CEACAM1 exons is indicated by numbered boxes and highlighted by red lines. Note, that the sequence similarity between CEACAM1 and CEACAM32 is highest in intron sequences, while the similarity of CEACAM1 sequences with that of CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 is highest for the exon sequences. The different repeat sequences are indicated by differently shaped forms. Figure 7 . Gene conversion of bovine CEACAM1 paralogs. Gene conversion was analyzed using GENECONV. Sequences of all bovine CEACAM1 paralogs starting from the leader exon (exon 1) to the first ~1000 nucleotides from the intron between the N domain (exon 2) and A domain (exon 3) exon were aligned using muscle. Gene conversion was detected by GENECONV. 23 gene conversion events were detected using default parameters. Events were numbered from 1 to 23. Gene conversions between two CEACAM genes are depicted. The direction of gene conversion is not shown. Statistical support can be found in www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ substitutions was observed (Fig. 8A ). In addition, the MEME application was used to analyze the sequence alignment of CEACAM32 sequences to search for episodic positive selection. Only one codon (codon 27) was found to be under episodic positive selection i.e. selection for diversification at a significance level of 0.1 (Fig. 8B) . Additional sites were identified, which were indicated to be under positive selection by the LRT (p-value > 0.1), four of them (sites 39, 40, 41, 42) are located in the region between position 36 to 52 (Fig. 8B) . Modeling the structure of the CEACAM32 N domain revealed that most the codons putatively selected for diversification are placed in or near to the CFG face (Fig. 8C) . The CFG face is known to be the major ligand interaction area of CEACAM N domains. Together these data suggest that natural selection has favored differentiation of the putative ligand-binding face of CEACAM32 from other bovine CEACAMs.
