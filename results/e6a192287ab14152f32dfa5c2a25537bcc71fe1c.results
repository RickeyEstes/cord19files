The spatial distribution of ambient PM 2.5 concentrations between Chinese cities was geographically heterogeneous (Fig. 1) . The highest levels of PM 2.5 (N 64.90 μg/m 3 ) were generally located in cities in the western and northern regions of China and were more inland, in contrast to cities with low levels of PM 2.5 (b 33.50 μg/m 3 ) which were located in the more southern, outer regions of China. Among the 47 cities, the city of Shijiazhuang in Hebei province had the highest PM 2.5 concentration (98.14 μg/m 3 ), while the lowest was recorded in the city of Xilingele in Inner Mongolia (11.90 μg/m 3 ). Overall, there were 76,902 incident cases of influenza cases during the time period of the study. The highest incidences of influenza occurred in cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chongqing, and the lowest incidences were observed in cities in the north eastern and central parts of China (Fig. 1) . The highest daily count of new cases of influenza (n = 32) was observed in Guangzhou city, Guangdong province whereas the lowest was in Xianning city, Hubei province. A summary of daily PM 2.5 concentrations, incident influenza and the weather conditions for each city are shown in Table S1 -S3 of the appendix. Table 1 shows the correlations between ambient PM 2.5 and the meteorological variables under investigation. PM 2.5 concentrations were negatively correlated with temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and hours of sunshine significantly (r = − 0.31,-0.03, − 0.25 and −0.12, respectively), but were positively correlated with atmospheric pressure significantly (r = 0.06). There was a strong correlation between relative humidity and hours of sunshine and weak correlations were observed between other meteorological factors. Fig. 2 shows the pooled results from the meta-analysis for different single lag models (lag 0 to lag 7). The effect of PM 2.5 on influenza was significant at lag days 2 and 3 (RR: 1.015 and 1.013; and 95% CI: 1.004, 1.025 and 1.003, 1.023, respectively). Thus, a moving average lag model at lag 2-3 days was performed to examine the cumulative effect across these two days. Fig. 3 shows the effect of ambient PM 2.5 on influenza at lag 2-3 days for each individual city and the overall pooled estimate at the national level. The effect estimates varied by city, with strong and significant effects observed in several cities in Southwest China and Central China including Guilin, Xianning, Kunming and Guangzhou. However, weak and insignificant effects were observed in cities located in Northeast China and South China including Shenyang, Changchun and Shenzhen. For the pooled estimate, the increased risk of influenza was significantly associated with an increase of 10 μg/m 3 in PM 2.5 at lag 2-3 days (RR: 1.020, 95% CI: 1.006, 1.034). Fig. 4 shows the results for the stratified analyses by temperature levels per 10 μg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 at lag day 2, lag day 3 and lag days' 2-3. Significant associations at lag days' 2-3 for cold days were observed (RR: 1.027, 95% CI: 1.010, 1.044), and a weaker, non-significant association was observed for hot days (RR: 0.982, 0.943, 1.023). For different lag types, the strongest effects were observed for cold days and the weakest effects for hot days. The effects on moderate cold and moderate hot days were similar. Table 2 shows the number and fraction of incident influenza that might related to ambient lag days' 2-3 PM 2.5 moving average concentrations. Overall, approximately 10% of incident cases of influenza during the study period may result from exposure to ambient PM 2.5 (PAF 10.72% [95% CI: 3.47%, 17.04%]). When stratified by temperature, the highest attributable fractions occurred on cold days (16.26, 95% CI: 6.67%, 24.53%). For moderate cold days and moderate hot days, the attributable fractions were similar. The effect of PM 2.5 on incident influenza was stronger on cold days than hot days at lag 2-3 days (Table S4 in appendix). Our findings were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses including increasing the number of lag days to 15 days for meteorological variables and when modifying the degrees of freedom for meteorological variables (3-6 df) and for time per year (6-10 df). Our findings remained robust after controlling for the effects of ambient SO 2 and NO 2 (Fig. S2 in the appendix) .
