A good fit was achieved with all masks: no exhaled gas was observed leaking between the edge of the mask and the face. With the nonrebreathing and Venturi-type masks, plumes of exhaled droplets could be seen exiting the side vents (Fig 1) . In the mask without vents, all exhaled vapor was directed through the exhalation port (Fig 2, left, A) . Placing the respiratory filter on the exhalation port appeared to prevent droplets from leaving the mask (Fig 2, right, B) . There was no increased positive pressure or increased end-tidal carbon dioxide discovered using the modified oxygen delivery system.
