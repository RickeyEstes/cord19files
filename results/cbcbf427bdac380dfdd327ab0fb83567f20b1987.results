Sampling. A total of 235 adult bats were captured live with nets near or in human dwellings from Zhoushan (ZS), Daishan (DS), Xiamen (XM), Changle (CL), Shishi (SS), and Lianjiang (LJ) between July to August in 2015 in Zhejiang and Fujian Provinces of China (Fig. 1 ). All bats looked healthy and had no obvious clinical signs at capture. Based on the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, the bats can be divided into five species based on their muscle tissues: Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Myotis formosus, Scotophilus kuhlii, Myotis davidii, and Rhinolophus pusillus. All intestine and lung samples were classified and combined into 12 pools and then subjected to metagenomic sequencing. High throughput sequencing. The original data was processed with in-house scripts. After quality control and host read removal, a total of 5,990,261 reads were employed for further analysis. The read length was between 80 bp and 100 bp. For each sample, an average of 89.85 Mbp data were obtained (range: 48.16Mbp-167.31Mbp). The percentage of bases with a quality score of > = Q20 relative to the total bases in each sample ranged from 94.23% to 96.70% (mean percentage: 95.35%). The corresponding percentages of high-quality bases (> = Q30 and > = Q40) in each sample ranged from 87.57% to 92.34% (mean percentage: 89.76%) and from 62.41% to 72.80% (mean percentage: 67.57%), respectively. The filtered clean data matched with the NCBI bacterial genome, fungal genome, and virus database. Reads on the reference database were compared, and 327,159 reads were detected as bacterial sequences, 298,008 reads (4.93%) were detected as eucaryon sequences, 51 reads (0.00085%) were detected as archaeal sequences, and 2,180 reads (0.036%) were detected as virus sequences. 49.67% (2, Supplementary Table S1 . Plant viruses accounted for 0.51% (77/15012) of annotated tags, which included the following four viral families: Luteoviridae, Totiviridae, Virgaviridae, and Phycodnaviridae. Phycodnaviridae accounts for the largest proportion of plant viruses (77%). Phycodnaviridae virus infection is widely present in fresh water algae or seaweed across the world. It is worth mentioning that 35.27% virus sequences shared low similarity with known viral sequences. To verify the reliability of metagenomic sequencing results, six viruses (coronavirus, mastadenovirus, mamastrovirus, circovirus, norovirus, and bocavirus) closely related to human disease were selected, and nucleic acid from bat tissue samples of all 235 bats was amplified by PCR ( Table S1 ). All bat samples were amplified by a nested PCR which targeted a 440 bp fragment of conserved protein RdRp; 16 positive amplifications were detected from ZS, CL, and SS groups. The ZS group had seven out of 45, CL group had five out of 55, SS group had four out of 35 positive amplifications from Rhinolophidae family, including 14 cases of Rhinolophus pusillus and two cases of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. Subsequently,16 positive amplifications were further sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed against Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus samples (Fig. 3) . Nine sequences shared 91.4%-99.8% identity to Betacoronavirus, SARS coronavirus SZ3, and SARS-related bat coronavirus in a large branch, while the remaining seven sequences belonged to the Alphacoronavirus, along with BtRf-AlphaCoV/YN2012, and Human coronavirus 229E in a large branch. Detection and identification of Adenovirus. Adenoviruses (AdVs) are one of the most common viruses that infect humans and animals. These infections cause a variety of sub-clinical to lethal symptoms and outcomes 19 . In this viral metagenomic analysis, we found 21 tags showing identity with genus Mastadenovirus in group ZS, one tag showing identity with genus Mastadenovirus in XM group and 15 tags showing identity with genus Mastadenovirus in CL group (Supplementary Table S1 ). Further screening of intestine from the bat samples by performing PCR of a partial hexon gene sequence of mammalian adenovirus (766 nt) confirmed that three sequences existed in the intestine of Rhinolophus pusillus from the CL group but not the other two groups. At present, partial genomic sequences(10603 bp) of bat adenovirus CLR6 were obtained by using degenerated primers, including three major ORFs (E1B1, Iva2,Pol, Genbank:MF278269). Phylogenetic analysis based on a partial hexon gene sequence (Fig. 4) showed that bat adenoviruses, CLR1, CLR6, and CLR10 shared 80.0% to 98.2% nucleotide sequence identity to each other and 55.1% to 78.7% nucleotide sequence identity with bat adenovirus as previously reported in China and Germany [20] [21] [22] . Therefore, the three bat adenoviruses were termed as Mastadenovirus-related virus 1.
