Design of specific shRNA expression plasmids targeting at coronavirus RDRP Coronavirus isolated from SARS patients has a large genomic RNA (approximately 30 kb). When the virus replicates, errors are generated with a high frequency, making the virus particularly difficult to target. We therefore chose the target genes in the viral genome that are conserved in different strains of coronavirus. One of the candidates is RDRP (GeneBank AY 268070). This gene has 645 bp and codes a 215-amino-acid peptide. BLAST analysis shows that there is almost no mismatch in this region of coronaviruses. This sequence has no homology with any known human genes. Among 25 candidate fragments, five panels of DNA sequences (Table 1) were synthesized and inserted into pSilence1.0-U6. With the U6 pol III promoter, the plasmids express a 55-nt RNA stem-loop. After transfecton, about 40-90% of RDRP gene expression was inhibited, depending on the sequence of the shRNA inserts, based on RT-PCR analysis in both HeLa and 293 cells transfected with RDRP (data not shown). Therefore, we selected the most potent plasmid inserted with sequence A (plasmid-A, see Table 1 ) for subsequent experiments. A mutated version of the inserted sequence-A with 6-nt mismatch was also synthesized as a specific negative control (plasmid-A*, Table 1 ). shRNA reduced the expression of SARS RDRP mRNA in 293 and HeLa cells As shown in Fig. 1A , based on the RT-PCR analysis, the expression of extraneous RDRP gene was observed peaking at 48 h after the transfection. When 293 cells were cotransfected with pIRES-2-EGFP/RDRP plasmid along with shRNA expression plasmid-A, the RDRP mRNA was reduced to 25% of that of the control cells measured at 24 h after the transfection, and the RDRP mRNA can no longer be detected 48 h after the transfection (Fig. 1B, lane 4) . No inhibitory effect was observed in the cells co-transfected with pIRES-2-EGFP/RDRP along with plasmid-A* (Fig.  1B , lane 5). The inhibitive effect on RDRP by plasmid-A was also observed in HeLa cells (data not shown). shRNA reduced the production of SARS RDRP proteins To confirm the effect of shRNA on RDRP expression, we performed Western blot analysis. Because anti-RDRP antibody is not commercially available, antibody against HA tag was used to detect the production of RDRP proteins, in which an HA epitope tag had been introduced at the Nterminus. The results showed that the production of RDRP proteins was reduced by more than 90% in cells co-transfected with plasmid-A (Fig. 2B, lane 4) . The specificity of the RNAi was again demonstrated in that no inhibitory effect on RDRP protein expression was observed in the cells co-transfected with plasmid-A* (Fig. 2 , lane 5). The reduction of RDRP protein in the target cells was also analyzed by immunofluorescence. Again, RDRP production was significantly reduced by plasmid-A (Fig. 3D ), but not by plasmid-A* (Fig. 3E ). In addition, we noticed an interesting phenomenon: RDRP proteins appeared to be located in the cytoplasm, but somehow accumulated in the nucleus of the cells 48 h after the transfection (Fig. 3) . The significance of this finding is as yet unknown.
