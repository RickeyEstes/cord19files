From March 2014 through July 2015, we tested 294 pairs of NP/OP swabs and sputum specimens using TAC. On average, NP/OP swabs and sputum specimens were collected 29 (Standard Deviation [SD] = 14) and 38 (SD = 31) hours after admission, respectively. Most patients (198/294; 67%) were between ages 18-49 years, and 81/294 (28%) were male. Fever was either self-reported or measured (≥38 °C) in 40% of the patients, and malaria was diagnosed in 19% of the patients. More than half the patients (179/294; 61%) had underlying chronic illness; 39% and 22% for HIV and other chronic conditions respectively. Of the 294 patients, 116 (39%) sought care in <5 days from respiratory illness onset, 99 (34%) sought care 5-10 days and 79 (27%) sought care after 10 days. Of all cases, 88 (30%) were hospitalized for >7 days and 24 (8%) died in hospital (Table 1) . Of the 24 who died, 9 (38%) were HIV-positive, 3 (13%) had malaria and 3 (13%) had other chronic illnesses. Of the 294 pairs of specimens tested, 248 bacterial and 136 viral pathogens were detected from 141 and 115 NP/OP specimens respectively whereas 213 bacterial and 47 viral pathogens were detected from 141 and 45 sputum specimens respectively. NP/OP specimens were more likely to test positive for any viral pathogen compared to sputum specimens, p < 0.01. There was no difference in bacterial pathogen detection in NP/OP vs. sputum specimens, and the pathogen specific agreements ranged between 85-100% (Table 2) . Among the bacterial pathogens detected, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis were more significantly present in NP/OP specimens compared to sputum specimens. However, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were more significantly present in the sputum specimen compared to the NP/OP specimen. Among the viral pathogens, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Rhinovirus, and Human Coronavirus 2 (NL63) were commonly detected in NP/OP than sputum specimens (Table 2) . When stratified by HIV status, malaria infection, prolonged hospitalization and duration from onset to admission, there was not much difference in pathogen yield. Although, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (detected in sputum) was associated with HIV positive, malaria negative, and severe cases, and with patients admitted ≥5 days from illness onset.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were the most co-detected bacterial pathogens and rhinovirus was the most co-detected viral pathogen (Supplementary Tables S5 and S6) . The median C T values shown in box-and-whiskers plot were comparable for NP/OP and sputum specimens for all bacterial targets (Fig. 1) . This was also observed for most viral pathogens, except that a higher concentration of viruses (corresponding to lower C T values) was observed for influenza B, RSV and human metapneumovirus in the NP/OP specimens compared to sputum specimens. The median C T values were similar in the NP/OP and sputum specimens for the RNP target.
