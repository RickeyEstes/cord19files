High-throughput screening has identified Rhus chinensis gallnut ethanol extract with inhibitory activity on human recombinant hLDH-A. As previously reported, this was one of the most potent natural products elucidated with an IC 50 < 1 g/mL [18] . In order to elucidate the active constituents within the RCG extract responsible for hLDH-A inhibition, bioactivity guided fractionation (Figure 2(a) ) was conducted to where hLDH-A activity was inhibited by the ethyl acetate fraction (167-215) (Figures 2(b) , and 2(c)), which further yielded two active fractions within (Figure 2(d) ). Fractions 2 (0.2 g) and 3 (0.15 g) showed similar activity and then were identified by 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR to be the same and then later combined. The molecule is identified as PGG (1,2,3,4,6-pentagalloylglucose) which is a solid and an off-white substance. The melting point was determined on a Mel-Temp II apparatus (Laboratory Devices) and found to be 337 ∘ C. MW Figure 3) where an external standard (b) versus extract (a) indicating PGG was present at 24.8 ± .85 g/mL, which is equivalent to 9.95 ± .34 of crude extract. To assess if PGG could theoretically inhibit hLDH-A, molecular docking studies were conducted and the data show predicted competitive binding of PGG (Figure 4(a) ) within the NADH binding cofactor site of the hLDH-A enzyme (Figures 4(b) and 4(c) ). Docking studies showed H bond interactions between the docked ligand PGG and the protein in the cofactor site (Figures 5(a) (Figures 1 and 2) . When compound PGG was docked alongside the bound ligand 1,4-dihydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAI), the total scores which are expressed aslog( ) obtained were 5.86 and 12.61, respectively, for PGG and the bound ligand NIA, respectively. These effects were also confirmed by functional studies (Figure 5(a) ), where PGG was found to be an extremely potent hLDH-A inhibitor within the therapeutic range IC 50 = 27.17 nM compared to a known hLDH-A inhibitor oxalic acid ( Figure 5(b) ) demonstrating a relative weak potency reflected by an IC 50 > 6 mM. Competitive binding of PGG versus NADH clearly shows that the site has greater affinity for PGG than NADH ( Figure 6 ). In order to determine the effects of PGG in vitro, a human breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231) lysate was evaluated for the baseline expression of hLDH-A by Western blot (Figure 7) . These findings validate the identity of the recombinant protein used in this study, as well as demonstrating dominant expression level in MDA-MB-231 cells, further subject to in vitro effects incurred by PGG. In vitro analyses on the lethality of PGG versus reduction in lactic acid accumulated in the supernatant were near identical (Figures 8(a) and 8(b) ). However, given that all toxic compounds regardless of mechanism of action will reduce lactic acid as a process of cell death in tumor cells, there is no conclusion drawn from this data. If loss of lactate significantly preceded cell death, one could say there was a correlation, but further analysis will be required. The antiproliferative effects of PGG relative to paclitaxel were evaluated over a three-day growth period (Figure 9 ). In this study, we provide data to
