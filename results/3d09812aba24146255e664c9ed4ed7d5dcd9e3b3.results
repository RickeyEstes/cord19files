There were a total of 19,581 dengue-related documents identified in the Scopus database that were published between 1872 and 2015. These documents were published from the across 12 document types. There were 14,434 paper articles comprising 73.71 % of the total production, followed by reviews (10.26 %), and letters (4.31 %). Other document types such as editorial materials, proceedings papers, notes, and book reviews covered approximately 11.73 % of the published literature. Table 1 illustrates the top 10 countries in terms of absolute research production, their h-index and number of publication from international collaboration. The leading countries in dengue research were the USA (4,709; 24.05 %), India (1,942; 9.92 %), Brazil (1,530; 7.81 %), Thailand (1,260; 6.43 %), the UK (1,129; 5.77 %), and France (1,087; 5.55 %). As expected, most publications related to dengue were carried out in North America, Europe, South Asia, and Latin America. This bibliometric analysis has demonstrated the leading role that the USA, India, Brazil, Thailand, the UK, and France play in dengue research (Table 1 ). In case of number of publications with multinational researchers, France tops the list with 147 countries, followed by the USA with 146 countries, and the UK with 126 countries. Furthermore, the UK (71.12 %) had the highest percentage of documents in collaboration, followed by 56.03 % for France, 52.54 % for Thailand, and 52.11 % for India from the total number of documents for each country. The total number of citations for all publications was 352,710, with an average of 18.0 citations per publication. Furthermore, the h-index for all extracted data related to dengue research was 186. The best h-index value is achieved by the USA (159) followed by the UK (92), Thailand (78) , and France (76); ( Table 1) . The Arab world produced fewer publications related to dengue. Only 226 (1.16 % of the overall global research effort in the dengue field) articles were published from the Arab region across 7 document types. There were 187 paper articles comprising 82.7 % of the total production, followed by reviews (7.5 %), and letters (3.1 %). Editorial materials, proceedings papers, notes, and book reviews covered approximately 6.7 % of the published literature. The total publications per year are demonstrated in Fig. 1 . The results from Arab world show that the study of dengue exhibits an overall upward trend from 1968 to 2015 with peak publications in 2015.  The top 10 most productive journals based on the number of publication at global level were analyzed ( Table 3) The impact factor was reported according to the journal citation reports (JCR) 2014 field of dengue research at Arab level are shown in Table 6 [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] .
