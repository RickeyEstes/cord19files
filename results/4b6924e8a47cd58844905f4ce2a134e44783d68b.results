A total of 4892 eligible participants were contacted. 2823 refused to participate, 223 were unable to respond and 219 did not finish the interview. 1.627 completed the interview (response rate of 33.3%). The distribution of sex, age groups and educational level were similar in both waves (data not shown). The two most frequently adopted preventive measures were those recommended by the Spanish MoH. Overall, 79.5% of the participants reported adopting at least one preventive measure in the first wave. The proportion was lower in the second wave (74.6%, p =0.02) ( Table 1) . As shown in Table 2 , the factors associated with the adoption of the MoH recommended measures were female gender, secondary or higher educational level, living in towns with more than 50,000 inhabitants, high concern about becoming infected by 2009 influenza A (H1N1), perceiving the preventive measures to be highly effective and high perception of the usefulness of the information provided by the government. For purchase measures, similar associated factors were identified except that the respondents belonging to the younger age groups (b55) and those living with school-aged children were more likely to follow these measures. In addition, no association was observed regarding the perceived usefulness of the information provided by the government. Avoidance measures were independently associated with the group aged 18-35 years, living in towns with more than 50,000 inhabitants, high concern about becoming infected by 2009 influenza A (H1N1) and perceiving the preventive measures to be highly effective.
