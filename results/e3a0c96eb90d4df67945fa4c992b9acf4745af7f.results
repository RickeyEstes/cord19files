Of the 144 stool samples analysed by PCR, 29.2% (42/144) were positive for CPV-2 ( Table 1) . Amplification of the partial VP2 gene displayed a single band with the expected 583 bp. Of the dogs examined, 38.8% had haemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE), but from the 42 positive samples, 71.4% displayed signs of HGE (Table 2) . From Rio Grande do Sul, 111 samples were analysed, which were from the municipalities of Porto Alegre, Viamão, Cachoeirinha, Taquara, Canoas, Caxias do Sul, Passo Fundo, Bagé, Glorinha, Gravataí, Santana do Livramento, Lavras do Sul, Novo Hamburgo, Rio Pardo and São Francisco de Paula. The states of Santa Catarina (SC), Paraná (PR), São Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and Rondônia (RO) had a total of 33 samples that resulted in nine CPV-2-positive samples. Sequencing the amplification product from the 42 positive samples allowed us to identify nucleotide mutations, although the majority were silent (Table 1) . It was possible to identify 78.6% (33/42) of the samples as type 2c, 19% (8/42) as type 2b and 2.4% (1/42) as type 2a. From the positive animals, 33.3% (14/42) were aged less than 2 months, 47.6% (20/42) had no vaccination history and the 6 animals with a complete immunisation schedule were positive for CPV-2c. Regarding breed, 11 mixed breeds, 6 German Shepherds and 3 Rottweilers were CPV-2c positive and their ages ranged from 2 to 10 months. In general, the BI and NJ trees (not shown here) were different because many possible topological resolutions were found, with weak support. Salient features of all trees included that (a) CPV-2 Brazilian variants can be considered to be cosmopolitan, with similar variants in South America, Europe, Africa and Asia and (b) no clear geographic structure was found showing that CPV-2 variants are widely dispersed along the studied area. The BI tree (Fig. 1) showed that the CPV-2 Brazilian variants have clustered into different groups.
