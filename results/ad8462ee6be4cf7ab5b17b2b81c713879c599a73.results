Mono-ARTDs are regulated by interferon. In order to identify stimuli driving ARTD10 expression, a fragment of the ARTD10 promoter (− 532 to + 491 relative to the start of transcription) was cloned into the pGL3 basic luciferase reporter gene construct. U2OS cells were transiently transfected with this reporter gene construct and stimulated with the antiviral defense-inducing cytokine IFNα . This stimulated the ARTD10 promoter reporter gene construct in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 1a) , in accordance with previous findings 20 . IFNα also promoted endogenous ARTD10 protein synthesis in these cells (Fig. 1b) . Next we analyzed endogenous ARTD10 Figure 1 . Expression of ARTD8 and ARTD10 is stimulated by interferon α. (a) A fragment of the human ARTD10 promoter (− 532 to + 491 relative to the start of transcription) was cloned in front of a luciferase reporter gene. This construct was transfected together with a β -galactosidase expressing plasmid into U2OS cells, which were then stimulated with the indicated amounts of interferon (IFN) α . 24 h later the relative luciferase activity was determined. Mean values ± SD of three experiments. (b) Untransfected U2OS cells were treated with IFNα in parallel to the cells in panel A and whole cell lysates analyzed for ARTD10 expression by immunoblotting using mAb 5H11. (c-f) HeLa and U2OS cells were stimulated with IFNα for the indicated times. The expression of ARTD10 and ARTD8 mRNA was measured using RT-qPCR (mean values ± SD of three experiments). ARTD10 and ARTD8 protein was analyzed by immunoblotting using mAb 5H11 (panels c and d) and peptide-specific pAb (panels e and f), respectively. gene expression. IFNα stimulated ARTD10 mRNA and protein synthesis in HeLa and U2OS cells ( Fig. 1c and d) , consistent with our reporter gene assays. Similarly to the findings for ARTD10, ARTD8 expression was also induced by IFNα resulting in elevated mRNA and protein levels in HeLa and U2OS cells ( Fig. 1e and f) . To detect ARTD8 protein levels we made use of an antibody generated against a peptide derived from the sequence located between macrodomain 2 and 3 of ARTD8 ( Supplementary Fig. S1a ). Analogous to IFNα , lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial pathogen-associated molecular pattern, stimulated ARTD10 mRNA and protein synthesis in differentiated THP-1 cells ( Supplementary Fig. S1b ), but not in undifferentiated cells (data not shown). Of note is that both IFNα and LPS stimulated ARTD10 and ARTD8 expression with some delay, indicating that the induction of these genes is probably indirect rather than through direct activation of IFN receptor downstream signaling events. Taken together our results support the notion that mono-ARTDs like ARTD8 and ARTD10 play a role in the first line immune response that is induced in consequence of stimuli such as IFNα and LPS. Our observations and published findings let us hypothesize a function for MARylation in the immune defense against pathogens.
