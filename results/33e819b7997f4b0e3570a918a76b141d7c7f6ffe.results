During the SARS outbreak, 49 of 227 cases did not receive medication due to loss of contact with medical care providers. Among these cases, 28 cases suffered seizure attacks during the outbreak. Among them, four cases received emergency room (ER) treatment because of cluster attacks. Two other cases were admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) because of status epilepticus. Twenty cases, including four sent to ER and two sent to ICU, were seizure free for at least 6 months before SARS outbreak. Another eight cases had seizures before the SARS outbreak period, but the acute withdrawal of drugs also produced a significant increase in the number of The impact of SARS on epilepsy 559 seizures compared to the previous period. After SARS, the 28 cases returned to the OPD, and the drugs were reinstituted; seizure frequency then showed a marked decrease during 6 months observation period (P < 0.001) (Fig. 1) . Seventeen of the 28 cases were seizure free for 6 months. The seizure types were 5 generalized, 10 secondarily generalized, 8 complex partial seizures, and 5 simple partial seizures. The etiologies for the seizures were 7 idiopathic and 21 symptomatic including tumor, mesial temporal sclerosis, stroke, and developmental disorders. Twelve cases received monotherapy, and the other 16 cases had at least two drugs for seizure control (Table 1) . Twenty-one of 227 cases did not have drugs but they did not have seizures after drug withdrawal. All were seizure free during the previous 6 months. Eleven cases were generalized seizures and ten cases were secondarily generalized seizures. The etiologies for the seizures were 17 idiopathic, 1 stroke. Sixteen cases received monotherapy, other five on polytherapy. After the outbreak, they kept drug-free after the consultation. Nineteen cases remained seizure free at the 6 months follow up after the SARS outbreak. Another two had recurrent seizures and they received treatment again. In the above two groups, seizure type (P = 0.01, x 2 -test), etiology (P = 0.001), number of drugs (P = 0.019), and seizure free before SARS (P = 0.007) were significantly different. Partial seizure, symptomatic etiology, polytherapy, and still seizure attack before SARS were more common in the ''stop drug/attack'' group. One hundred and twenty-five cases had drugs and were seizure-free during the SARS outbreak period. In the previous 6 months, 117 of these cases were seizure-free for 6 months. Statistical analysis shows seizure frequency decreased during SARS period (P = 0.05). The seizure types in this group were 33 generalized, 12 complex partial, 2 partial, and 78 secondary generalized seizures. The etiologies for seizures in this group were 53 idiopathic or cryptogenic and 72 symptomatic. Sixty-two cases received monotherapy, 49 cases received two drugs, 13 received three and 1 received four drugs. Fifty-three cases had drugs but still suffered seizure attacks during the SARS period. In this group, only two cases were seizure-free in the previous 6 months. According to statistical analysis, seizure frequency did not increase during the SARS period (P = 0.863). The seizure types in this group were 4 generalized, 11 complex partial, 4 simple partial, and 34 secondarily generalized seizures. The etiologies for seizures in this group were 8 idiopathic, and 45 symptomatic. Eleven cases have treated with monotherapy, 23 with two drugs, 15 with three drugs, and 4 with four drugs. In the above two groups, seizure type (P < 0.0000), etiology (P < 0.0000), and number of drug types (P < 0.0000), under treatment but still seizures (P < 0.0000) differed significantly. Partial seizure, symptomatic etiology, intractable seizures and polytherapy were more common in the ''continue drug/attack'' group. Analysis of risk factors by logistic regression, shows drug withdrawal (P < 0.001), polytherapy (P < 0.05), presence of seizure before withdrawal (P < 0.001) and seizure etiology (P < 0.0001) were strongly associated with seizure recurrence after drug withdrawal.
