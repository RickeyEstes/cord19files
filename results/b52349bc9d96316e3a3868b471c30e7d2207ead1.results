The CD14 polymorphism, -159C/T, was successfully genotyped in 153 brucellosis patients and 128 control subjects. No deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed in the studied case and control groups (P > 0.05). The genotype and allele frequency of the SNP in the studied groups were shown in Table 2 . The results showed that the CD14 polymorphism, -159C/T, was associated with the risk of brucellosis in our population. At genotypic level, the CD14 CT, and TT genotypes were more frequent in the patients group compared to cases, and were associated with increased risk of brucellosis in the codominant model (OR = 1.993, 95% CI = 1.07-3.71, P = 0.03 for CT; OR = 3.869, 95% CI = 1.91-7.84, P = 0.01 for TT genotype). Additionally, the CT + TT vs. CC genotype in the dominant model was a risk factor for brucellosis (OR = 2.514, 95% CI = 1.34-4.73, P = 0.02). Likewise, in the recessive model, the TT genotype vs. CC + CT was associated with the risk of brucellosis (OR = 2.379, 95% CI = 1.33-4.27, P = 0.02). At allelic level, the minor allele (T) was significantly more frequently present in brucellosis patients than in controls (61% vs. 45%, respectively), and was a risk factor for brucellosis (OR = 3.058, 95% CI = 1.507-6.315, P = 0.01).
