Establishment of an H5N1 virus infection system in nonhuman primates through an aerosol route by using a commercial nebulizer. A wide range of commercial nebulizers are available for clinical and research use. In this study, we used the ultrasonic nebulizer NE-U17 from Omron Healthcare Co, Ltd, Japan. This was chosen because it is easy to use and could reduce the treatment time needed compared with other nebulizer devices 16 , thereby making the procedure less stressful for the animals. The particle size is also critical for aerosol inhalation because aerosol transmission (also referred to as droplet nuclei transmission) occurs when small particles (<5 µm) are inhaled. A previous study demonstrated that the NE-U17 nebulizer generates a large fine particle fraction of aerosol mass <5 µm (the mean percentage of the fine particle fraction was 46%) 16 . We used 2-to 3-year-old male cynomolgus macaques that weighed 2-3 kg each. Four animals were inoculated with 4 ml of a 10 7 PFU/ml solution of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus A/Vietnam/ UT3040/2004 strain (VN3040) through the aerosol route by using the ultrasonic nebulizer NE-U17. These animals were defined as 'the aerosol method group' . As a control, 4 ml of the virus solution was administered through multiple routes by the conventional method, that is, by the intranasal (0.4 ml each to the left and right nostril), intraoral (0.4 ml each to the left and right tonsil), intraocular (0.1 ml per eye), and intratracheal (2.2 ml using a tracheal catheter) routes (defined as 'the conventional method group'). The virus dose of 4 × 10 7 PFU of influenza virus was chosen for inoculation because a similar virus dose has been widely used in previous studies to infect NHPs to ensure the greatest likelihood of virus infection and replication in the inoculated animals 6, 15, [17] [18] [19] . Upon virus infection, none of the animals exhibited noticeable clinical signs (i.e., no appreciable body weight loss or fever was observed in any of the infected animals) except for a slight decrease in appetite among all of the infected animals. To examine virus shedding, nasal swab samples were collected from the infected animals on days 1 and 3 post-infection for virus titration. On day 1 post-infection, VN3040 virus was recovered from four animals in the conventional method group, whereas viruses were detected from three of four animals in the aerosol method group (Table 1 and Fig. 1 ). The mean virus titers were not significantly different between the conventional and the aerosol method groups [3.38 and 1.9 log 10 (PFU/ml), respectively] (Fig. 1 ). On day 3 post-infection, VN3040 virus was recovered from nasal swabs of two and three animals in the conventional and aerosol method groups, respectively, and the mean virus titers were comparable between the two groups.
