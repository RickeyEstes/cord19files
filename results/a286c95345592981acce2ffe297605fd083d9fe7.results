Sequencing and analysis of ORF3 and S1 genes of PEDV In the current study, 165 samples from 41 PEDV-positive farms in 18 provinces or municipalities of China were identified by RT-PCR or rapid strip test. Of those 165 samples, 137 (83.03%) were confirmed as PEDV positive using by RT-PCR targeting the ORF3 gene of PEDV (Table 1) . A total of 41 independent ORF3 genes and 29 S1 genes were successfully sequenced, covering seven regions of China. The sequence comparisons of the ORF3 genes revealed nucleotide homologies of 98.2%-100% and amino acid homologies of 97.8%-99.6% among the 41 PEDV strains; the 41 identifed PEDV strains exhibited 96.4%-97.2% nucleotide sequence homologies with the prototypical CV777 strain ( Table 2 ). Sequence comparisons of the 29 identified S1 genes indicated nucleotide homologies of 96.6%-100% and amino acid homologies of 95.2%-99.5%, while nucleotide and amino acid homologies of 92.0%-92.7% and 89.5%-91.3% respectively, were observed between the 29 identifed PEDV strains and the prototypical CV777 strain (Table 2 ). These data demonstrated that both the ORF3 and S1 gene of the identified PEDV strains exhibited high sequence similarity to Chinese highly virulent PEDV strain CHYJ130330, Chinese recombinant PEDV strain CH/HNQX-3/14, and US prototype strain USA/Colorado/2013. They also showed low sequence similarity to the CV777 strain (ORF3: 94.7%-96% amino acids identity; S1: 89.5%-91.3% amino acids identity), early Chinese PEDV field strain LZC (ORF3: 93.3%-94.2% amino acids identity; S1: 89.2%-90.5% amino acids identity) ( Table 2) . To further reveal the molecular characterization of the 29 identified S1 genes, the type S-INDEL strains, epitopes, and the pAPN receptor-binding regions were analyzed (Fig 1) . The 29 identified PEDV strains were classified as the global non S-INDEL strains. The S1 gene of the HLJ2015/DP1-1 strain has a unique deletion of 12 nucleotides at position of 1130-1141 (using CV777 as the reference strain) when compared with S-INDEL and non S-INDEL strains ( Fig  1A) . The SS2 epitope (Y 748 SNIGVCK 755 ) was found to be highly conserved in the 29 identified S1 genes, while two amino acid substitution occurred in the SS6 epitope (S 764 QSGQVKI 771 ) when compared with the CV777 strain (Fig 1B) . A total of 7 amino acid (aa) substitutions occurred in pAPN receptor-binding region (aa 490-615) of all identified PEDV S1 genes when compared to the CV777 strain (Fig 1C) .
