Demographic data of verified TB patients from 2002 to 2008 are presented in Table 1 . Between 2002 and 2008, the number of new TB cases declined from 16,758 to 14,265, and the incidence rate declined from 75 per 100,000 population to 62 per 100,000 population, reflecting an 17% decline in TB incident rate and an annual mean rate decrease of 3%. During the 7-year study period, the median age of the cohort increased from 63 years to 66 years, and incidence declined significantly in all age groups except among individuals aged 0-14 years. The incidence rate among men was approximately twice that in women in each year. Incidence declined annually for all age groups; however, the disease burden was felt most acutely in elderly patients, especially in those aged ≥ 65 years. Among incident TB patients, > 50% were elderly. In fact, those aged ≥ 65 years showed the highest TB incidence rate during the study period, whereas the rate of TB in the youngest age group (0-14 years) remained constant over time compared to that of other age groups. Of all new cases, > 90% were pulmonary TB (PTB); extrapulmonary TB accounted for 10.4% of new cases in 2002 and 4.4% in 2008. With all extrapulmonary TB cases, pleural effusion was predominant (approximately 25%), and approximately 7% of cases had tuberculous meningitis during 2002-2008 (data not shown in Table 1 ). Based on the sputum bacteriology, the rate of smear-or culture-positive PTB increased slightly over the study period. TB-associated mortality rates and associated factors are presented in Table 2 . TB-associated deaths decreased from 1,277 deaths in 2002 to 762 deaths in 2008, and the mortality rate fell from six per 100,000 population to three per 100,000 population. Among TB-associated deaths, more than three times as many deaths occurred among men than women. We found that TBassociated mortality increased with age. The median age of TB patients was 76-79 years, and > 80% were ≥ 65 years old. The highest burden of TB mortality continues to be among elderly patients. The geographical distribution of TB in Taiwan is shown in Table 3 . The eastern area consistently had higher TB incidence rates than the Kao-Ping and southern areas. Age-adjusted incidence rate also revealed that the eastern area had higher TB incidence rates, followed by Kao-Ping area. This was particularly true in Hualien County, where the incidence rate was the highest from 2002 to 2008. However, new cases in the eastern area made up only 4% of all cases, whereas the Taipei area consistently contributed the most cases (27-30%) during each year of the study. The case-mortality rate was consistently highest in the eastern and Kao-Ping areas and lowest in the Taipei area. Even after age adjustment, the eastern area still had the highest case-mortality rate. Incidence and mortality rates between 2005 and 2008 declined by 14% and 23%, respectively. Decreasing incidence between 2005 and 2008 was seen in six parts of the eastern area, which showed the greatest decline of 22% during that period. Among the 25 Taiwanese cities/ counties assessed, the greatest decline was seen in Lienchiang County, while cases increased in three jurisdictions. Decreases in mortality rates were seen in all areas except the Taipei area. The central area had the greatest decline during 2005-2008 (34%). For regions with intervention programs started in 2006, Hsinchu County had an 11% increase in incidence in 2006, while in 2007 and 2008, there was an 18% and 19% decline, respectively (Table 4 ).
