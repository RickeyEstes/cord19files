To determine whether age of IBV vaccination affected the humoral immune response, plasma samples were collected 14 and 21 days and tears 14 days after vaccination with 3 × 10 5 EID 50 of a live-attenuated ArkDPI IBV vaccine strain on 1, 7 14, 21 or 28 days of age. The IBV-specific IgG endpoint titers in plasma 14 days after vaccination are significantly lower for day 1 vaccinated birds with a mean of 7.8 ± 1.0 when compared to day 14, 21 and 28 vaccinated birds, which means vary between 10.2-11.4. The 7-day-old group does not differ significantly from day 1 or later vaccinated bird (Fig. 1A) . The IgG IBV-specific plasma levels 21 days after vaccination demonstrate, that the day 21 and 28 old vaccination groups Chickens were vaccinated at day 1, 7, 14, 21 or 28 of age. Unvaccinated chickens of the different age groups served as negative control. The data was analyzed by one way ANOVA with the Newman-Keuls post-test. The control group contains 3 data points for each age group, which were pooled in one group (n = 15). All vaccinated age groups contained between 10 and 13 chickens for IgG and IgA. A significant difference is observed at P < 0.05 and is indicated by different letters. IgM levels in IBV vaccinated birds are depicted by squares (n = 5) and the controls by circles (n = 5, d28 group n = 3). For the IgM controls the different age groups are shown separately since significant differences were observed between them. A significant increase (P < 0.05) of IgM levels in IBV vaccinated birds over their control group is indicated by a (*). stayed the same, while IgG antibody titers in groups vaccinated on day 1, 7 and 14 still increased (Fig. 1C) . This shows that early vaccination causes a delay in the IBV-specific IgG antibody kinetics. The IBV-specific IgA plasma antibody titers are not significantly different between groups, although the day 1 vaccinated group mean antibody titer is the lowest of all groups (Fig. 1B) and at least 3-fold lower than the next lowest group. Unlike the IgG antibody titers only the day 7 vaccination group increases in mean IgA plasma titer on day 21 post vaccination, while day 14 group stays the same and the day 21, 28 and 1 groups decline in mean IgA titer. Thus, only the day 7 group increases antibody titers on day 21 when compared to older birds. Thus, the day 7 group displays a delayed response in antibody production compared to older birds. The day 7 and day 14 groups have plasma IgA titers to IBV that are comparable to, or higher than, the day 21 and 28 groups on day 21 of the response. Unlike the day 7 and day14 vaccination groups the day 21 and 28 groups are declining on day 21 of the response compared to the immune response on day 14. This indicates that they are past their peak response on day 21 and possibly even on day 14 based on previous observations [20] . These data are consistent with a delay in the IgA plasma response to IBV in birds vaccinated at a younger age and a non-significant decline in mean IgA titers in the 1-day-old group. IBV-specific IgM antibody titers were measured in plasma. The plasma samples analyzed were collected on day 7 post vaccination. This time point was selected based on the literature in which the peak IgM response was observed between 5-9 days after virus challenge or live virus vaccination [26] [27] [28] . Due to the variability of IBV-reactive IgM in the controls between different age groups, independent controls were included for each age group. The IgM levels in the controls decreased considerably by ∼2 week of age after (7 days after the day 7 old chick vaccination) which increased one week later and stabilized in older age control groups (Fig. 1E) . The day 14 through day 28 control IgM levels were significantly higher than in the day 1 and day 7 age group controls. And the day 7 control was significantly lower than the day 1 control IgM levels. All IgM titers from the IBV vaccinated age groups were significantly higher when compared to their controls (P < 0.05) with exception of the day 21 age groups (P = 0.08). This was due to higher control values, which were ∼1.6 fold higher than in the age 14 or 28 days old groups. This may reflect an initial peak of natural antibodies induced to IBV before stabilizing. The IBV vaccinated age groups did not differ significantly in IgM antibody levels to IBV with exception of the day 1 IBV vaccinated group, which mean ± SE was 8.7 ± 0.6 had significantly lower IBV-specific IgM levels in plasma than the day 14 (10.2 ± 0.4) day 21 (10.6 ± 0.7) and day 28 (11.2 ± 0.5) vaccinated birds but did not differ significantly from the day 7 (9.2 ± 0.5) vaccinated birds (Fig. 1E) . The day 7 IgM antibody titers were also significantly lower than those in the day 28 vaccination group but not compared to the other age groups. In tears the IBV-specific IgG response is significantly higher in the day 21 and 28 vaccinated groups than in the day 1 and 7 vaccinated chickens for day 14 of the immune response ( Fig. 2A) . The IgG endpoint titer in the day 1 immunized group is even significantly lower than the day 7 immunized group, while the day 14 immunized group is intermediate between the day 7 group and chickens vaccinated at an older age. Thus, a correlation between age of vaccination and the magnitude of the IBV-specific IgG response in tears is observed on day 14 of the IBV-specific immune response. The day 14 and 21 groups have significantly higher IgA anti-IBV responses in tears on day 14 after vaccination compared to the day 1 group. The day 1 group is not significantly different from the day 7 and 28 vaccination groups. The day 28 group is also significantly lower than the day 14 and 21 groups (Fig. 2B) . This is likely due to the day 28 group displaying faster kinetics for IgA antibody levels in tears after vaccination, rather than a lower response [20] . The day 14 group IgA response is significantly higher than the day 1 and day 7 groups consistent with a delay or deficiency in the mucosal antibody response when vaccinated at an earlier age. Our data indicate there is a delay in antibody production when vaccinated at a younger age. The day 1 vaccination group not only displays a delay but also lower levels of antibody production. To determine whether there are not only quantitative differences between antibodies produced when vaccinated on day 1 but also qualitative differences we compared avidity indices for IgG and IgA antibodies from plasma and tears generated in 1 day old versus fully matured 28 day old birds 14 days after IBV vaccination. As is illustrated in Fig. 3A ,B a significantly higher avidity index is observed for IgG plasma antibodies for the day 28 vaccination group when compared to the day 1 vaccinated birds, while no significant difference is observed for IgA plasma antibodies. The same observations are also made for tear IgG and IgA antibodies (Fig. 3C,D) . Ciliated cells and goblet cells are the primary target of IBV in the respiratory tract [29] . Fig. 4 displays the deciliation (Fig. 4A ) and goblet cell (Fig. 4B ) scores 4 days after IBV challenge. IBV challenge decreased ciliated epithelial cells and goblet cell score. Ciliated cells were fully protected when vaccinated on day 7 of age or later but not when vaccinated on day 1 of age (Fig. 4A) . The protection of goblet cells increases with the age of vaccination and were fully protected when vaccinated on day 21 of age or older (Fig. 4B) . The lymphocytes score and mucosal thickness were also measured in tracheal samples on day 4 post AL/4614/98 IBV field strain challenge as indicators of inflammation. As is illustrated in Fig. 5A , a significant decrease in lymphocyte score was observed in the day 7 and 14 vaccination groups when compared to the day 1 group. The day 1 vaccination group did not significantly differ from the day 21 Fig. 2 . The IBV-specific IgG and IgA response in tears. Endpoint titers of IBV-specific IgG (A) and IgA (B) on day 14 of the immune response were measured by ELISA. Chickens were vaccinated on day 1, 7, 14, 21 or 28 of age. Unvaccinated chickens of the different age groups served as negative control. Depicted are the means and standard error of each age group and the control group, and different age groups are as described in Fig. 1 (n = 10-14 per group) . The data was analyzed by one way ANOVA with the Newman-Keuls post-test. Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05 and are indicated by different letters. Fig. 4 . Tracheal deciliation and goblet cell depletion after IBV challenge. To measure the degree of protection against IBV challenge after vaccination tracheal deciliation and goblet cell depletion were measured. Chickens were vaccinated at day 1, 7, 14, 21 or 28 of age and challenged 21 days later. Unvaccinated/unchallenged chickens of all age groups served as negative control and unvaccinated/IBV challenge chickens as positive control. Trachea were collected 4 days post challenge. Depicted are the mean and one standard error. For the negative and positive controls n = 5 for the different age groups n = 10-13. The data were analyzed by one way ANOVA with the Newman-Keuls post-test. Significant difference was observed at P < 0.05 and are indicated by different letters. and 28 vaccination groups due to a small increase in lymphocyte score in the latter two groups (Fig. 5A) . The day 1 group displayed the highest lymphocytes score from all vaccination groups, which is consistent with the highest inflammatory response to IBV challenge. This was also supported by a significant increase in mucosal thickness in the day 1 vaccinated group when compared with the day 14, 21 and 28 groups but not day 7 group, which was intermediate between the day 1 and groups vaccinated at an older age (Fig. 5B ).
