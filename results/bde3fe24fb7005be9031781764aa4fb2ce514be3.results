Radioautograms were obtained in a series of coronal and sagittal sections of rat brain, spinal cord and intestine. In each case, the high levels of speci¢c binding observed in the di¡erent tissue sections are re£ected by well-de¢ned total binding in each section while non-spe-ci¢c labeling remained very weak and homogenous (Fig. 1) . In the brain, [ 125 I]RB 129 labeling was very high in the meninges, choroid plexus (Fig. 3F^H ) and blood vessels, which appear as dark points on the slices (Table 1) .
