The mean time from onset to diagnosis for the previously quarantined persons (1.20 days) was significantly shorter than that of those who were not quarantined (2.89 days) ( Table 2 ). However, the respective mean times from diagnosis to classification (6.21 days and 7.34 days) ( Table  2) , though slightly reduced for the quarantined persons, were not significantly different. For the mean onset-todiagnosis time, period 1 was significantly longer (3.60 days to 2.49 days) than period 2 (p < 0.0001), while the mean difference before and after May 10 was not significant (p = 0.0722) ( Table 3 ). The mean diagnosis-to-classification time (Table 4) was not significantly different from period 1 to period 2. However, the time was significantly shortened after May 10 (from period 2 to period 3).
