IgG antibodies to T. gondii were detected in 10 out of 26 serum samples (38.5%) and in 10 out of 24 serum samples (42.0%) from groups 1 and 2, respectively. IgG antibodies to T. gondii were detected in 2 out of 26 aqueous humor samples (7.6%) and in 1 out of 24 aqueous humor (4.0%) from groups 1 and 2, respectively (Table 1) . When antibodies were detected in aqueous humor samples, the serology was systematically positive from the corresponding sera. However, titres were lower in aqueous humor samples than in the serum samples. Among the cats with uveitis, 6 out of 26 (23.0%) were positive for FIV but only two had concurrent anti-T. gondii antibodies, one cat (3.8%) was positive for FeLV and had concurrent anti-T. gondii antibodies and another one (3.8%) was positive for FIP without evidence of anti-T. gondii antibodies. Among the group 2, one cat was positive for FeLV and 4 cats were suspected of FIV infection. For the first group of cats, the following criteria were considered for the distribution of ocular lesions according to the serological status of the animals ( Table 2) : uni or bilateral uveitis, anterior and/or posterior uveitis, lens luxation and buphthalmia. Anterior segment disease was much more common than posterior segment disease in cats with (14/14) or without (11/12) serological evidence of T. gondii infection. The proportion of animals with unilateral or bilateral uveitis was similar in T. gondii-seropositive or seronegative cats. On the contrary, lens luxation and buphthalmia were more frequently observed in T. gondii-seropositive cats than in seronegative ones ( p < 0.05). Faecal examination was negative in all the cats tested.
