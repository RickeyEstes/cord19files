A total of 79 calves were enrolled with 26 calves in group 1 (placebo), 28 calves in group 2 (zinc Met), and 25 in group 3 (ZO). All the trial calves drank their morning and afternoon two quart daily milk bottles except for two of the calves that died. The enrollment blocks added up to 78 calves. In addition a calf was enrolled in group 2 on the last day bringing the total enrolled to 79 calves. A total of 5 calves were excluded from all analyses including: (1) one calf mistakenly enrolled in group 1 with normal fecal consistency; (2) two calves in group 2: one died immediately after enrollment and its necropsy revealed abomasal torsion; another was enrolled with an umbilical abscess; (3) two calves in group 3: one died after enrollment and necropsy revealed serous atrophy of fat, and the other was moribund at enrollment with severe systemic illness unable to drink milk or electrolyte treatment. Of the 74 calves in the study, 3 died during the trial: (1) one in group 1 (placebo) with gross lesions of an infarct and perforating ulcer in the cecum; (2) one in group 2 (zinc Met) with enteritis; (3) one in group 3 (ZO) with bilateral bronchopneumonia. There was no evidence of peritonitis associated with the liver biopsies in any of the calves Fig. 1 . Means and 95% confidence intervals for daily weight change (grams) in neonatal Holstein calves diagnosed with diarrhea and randomly allocated to a placebo, zinc methionine (Met), or zinc oxide (ZO) treatment in a double-blind block-randomized clinical trial to study the effect of zinc as a treatment for diarrhea. submitted for necropsy. Histology of the formalin-fixed pancreas of each calf that died revealed no damage to the exocrine pancreas, and therefore, no evidence of zinc toxicosis (Gabrielson et al., 1996, Smith and Embling, 1993) . The remaining 71 calves were treated once daily with either a placebo, zinc Met, or ZO formulations and were removed from the trial when they developed a normal fecal score of 1, or at the end of a 14 day supplementation period.
