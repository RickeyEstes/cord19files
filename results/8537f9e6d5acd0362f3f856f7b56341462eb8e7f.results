IFNc induction and MHV3 replication in BALB/c and A/J mouse macrophages upon activation with IL-12 and IL-18 Studies performed to investigate IFNg induction in activated MF are shown in Fig. 2 . Only upon a synergistic IL-12/IL-18 activation, BMMF from spf BALB/c and A/J mice were capable of synthesizing the IFNg gene as shown by RT-PCR or secrete IFNg into the supernatant culture as shown by specific ELISA assay. The treatment of BMMF from these spf mice with only IL-12 or IL-18 failed to either induce expression of the IFNg gene or secretion of IFNg during the first 48 h. BALB/c mouse MF were shown to regularly synthesize higher amounts of IFNg (3200760 pg/ml for BALB/c BMMF and 1600720 pg/ ml for A/J BMMF after 72 h of activation) and the studies showed that, in BMMF of both mouse strains, the IFNg mRNA and secreted IFNg could be detected after 24 h of IL-12/IL-18 activation. The amount of secreted IFNg present in supernatants increased consistently from 24 to 72 h (from 1500720 to 3200760 pg/ml in BALB/c BMMF and from 500710 to 1600720 pg/ml in A/J BMMF). At that time (72 h) some IFNg could be detected in cultures treated only with IL-18 (1200720 pg/ml in BALB/c BMMF and 750730 pg/ml in A/J BMMF). When PMF of non-spf BALB/c or A/J mice were used in the experiments, secreted IFNg could be detected in high amounts upon activation with IL-12 or IL-18 alone (31007200 or 38007180 pg/ml for BALB/c PMF and 15007100 or 3200760 pg/ml for A/J PMF) in addition to the synergistic IL-12/IL-18 activation (4000750 pg/ml for BALB/c PMF and 3600740 pg/ ml for A/J PMF). Cultured macrophage populations activated with IL-12, IL-18 or exogenous IFNg were assayed for their ability to restrict MHV3 after infection. The data shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that both BMMF and PMF from resistant A/J mice were capable of restricting MHV3 multiplication only when synergistically activated with IL-12/IL-18 (inhibition of 90.9% and 94% for PMF and BMMF, respectively) (5.570.5 Â 10 5 PFU/ml and 371.1 Â 10 5 PFU/ml for control PMF and BMMF, respectively, and 573.1 Â 10 4 PFU/ml and 370.8 Â 10 4 PFU/ml for IL-12/IL-18 activated PMF and BMMF, respectively) or with exogenous IFNg (inhibition of 92.8% and 96% for PMF and BMMF, respectively) (470.7 Â 10 4 PFU/ml and 270.4 Â 10 4 PFU/ml for IFNg activated PMF and BMMF, respectively). In contrast, no MHV3 multiplication restriction was observed in macrophages from the susceptible BALB/c mice (values from 5 to 7.5 Â 10 5 PFU/ml).
