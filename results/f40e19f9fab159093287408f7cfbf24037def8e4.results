In sensitivity analyses, Figures 1 and 2 show the estimated case fatality ratios in Hong Kong and Toronto, respectively, for 5 separate analyses in which patients were grouped by the treatment they had received within days of hospital admission for d Ï­ 1, 2, . . . , 5. For Hong Kong, the estimated case fatality ratios were consistent with the main results in Table 2 and generally stable across the different cutoffs, except for the small numbers of patients receiving corticosteroids only. Appendix Table 3 shows the estimated adjusted odds ratio of case fatality ratios among treatments, based on conventional multinomial logistic regression models on 10 imputed datasets. For Hong Kong, the estimated odds ratio is consistent with the main results in Table 2 , where patients treated with both ribavirin and corticosteroids had a higher case fatality ratio and the difference was marginally statistically significant. For Toronto, the results were not statistically significant with wide CIs.
