Emodin inhibits cell viability in the HepaRG cells. MTT assay indicated that emodin inhibited the proliferation of HepaRG cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner ( Fig. 2A) . When HepaRG cells were treated with 80 ÂµM of emodin, the cell viabilities were ~52.21% after 24 h of treatment, and then reduced to 40.32% after 48 h of treatment, respectively. Furthermore, emodin treatment also caused LDH leakage observed on HepaRG cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B) . To further verify emodin-induced apoptosis in HepaRG cells, we analyzed morphological nuclear changes using DAPI staining. The results showed that a significant number of cells with chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation were observed compared to the untreated control (Fig. 2C) . Emodin induces the apoptosis of HepaRG cells. Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining was performed to quantify emodin-induced apoptosis. The percentage of viable cells was significantly decreased after treatment with emodin for 24 h. Furthermore, both the early and late apoptotic cell populations increased 7.5-and 8.3-fold in the HepaRG cells, respectively. However, pretreatment with NAC successfully reversed the apoptosis induction ( Fig. 3A and B) . Thus, these results indicate that emodin appears to trigger apoptotic cell death in HepaRG cells.
