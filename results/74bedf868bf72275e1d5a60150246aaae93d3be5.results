Amoebicidal and cytotoxic effect of T-001, T-011, and T-016. All three compounds, T-001, T-011, and T-016 were effective against E. histolytica, with IC 50 values < 2 µM. Compound T-011 was cytotoxic in vitro against Vero cell cultures (IC 50 = 5.86 µM), whereas T-001 and T-016 were not cytotoxic (IC 50 > 100 µM), resulting in selectivity index (SI) > 65; these two compounds have anti-amoebic activity and SI higher than the reference drug metronidazole (IC 50 = 4.5 and a SI > 22.22). These results are summarized in Table 1 . www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Obtaining precision-cut hamster intestinal slices. The preparation and culture of complete tissue slices from hamster intestine and liver was successfully established using the Krumdieck tissue slicer (Fig. 1) . The slices prepared in this way maintained histological and morphologic characteristics of the normal intestine, preserved intestinal microvilli (Fig. 2a) , and remained viable during the incubation period ( Fig. 2b-e) .
