Multiple pathogens were present in 12 index patients and five asymptoma tic room con tacts, Table I . Bacterial pathogens and virus-like particles identified in stool from infants with diarrhea and asymptomatic room contacts culture of each patient with diarrhea were tested for enterotoxin production, using the infant mouse assay," and the YI adrenal cell assay methods." Control strains of E. coli were kindly provided by Dr. D.A. Sack. Assays were carried out in triplicate. The predominant lactose-fermenting colony type from each infant with diarrhea was tested for invasiveness by the guinea pig eye inoculation (Sereny) test." An inoculum of I drop of a very heavy suspension of the organism in Mueller-Hinton broth (at 5 X lO" cells per ml) was used. One hundred and sixty-five infants aged 9 days to 24 months (median 4 months) were studied; 41 had diarrhea, comprising 8 of 16 infants resident at outset, and 33 of 149 newly admitted infants. Two to eight new cases occurred per week; 26 cases were considered nosocomial. Two' infants each had two periods of diarrhea, and one had three, for a total of 45 diarrhea episodes. Eighty-one room contacts of infants with diarrhea remained asymptomatic, and specimens from 74 were available for examination. A putative stool pathogen was identified in 31 of 45 case episodes (69%), and in 31 of 74 (42%) asymptomatic room contacts (Table I) . Bacterial pathogens were isolated from seven infants, four of whom coincidentally carried a virus. Concurrent infection with two agents occurred in 10 patients, and with three agents in two, without evidence of an agent:agent pattern. Viruses. Six morphologic classes of virus-like particles were present in stools from 28 of 45 episodes of diarrhea
