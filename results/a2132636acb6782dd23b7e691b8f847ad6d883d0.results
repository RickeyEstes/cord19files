Over an 11 week period (early January to late March 2001), 54 symptomatic trainees were enrolled into the study from a group of 134 recruits who met the case definition. The average resident population of recruits at HMS Raleigh was approximately 1000 during this period. Nasopharyngeal swabs, an acute phase blood sample and a completed case report were obtained from each recruit at presentation. A follow-up questionnaire was completed by 37 (69%) of the recruits. Participant details at presentation and subsequently gathered general clinical information are summarized in Table 1 . One or more viruses were isolated and identified by viral culture in 29 of the 54 participants (54%). Adenovirus was isolated from 19 recruits (35%) and influenza viruses from 10 recruits (19%; 20% influenza A and 80% influenza B). Each virus occurred alone (no co-infections were identified), and no other respiratory viruses (i.e. RSV, PIV, enterovirus or HSV) were isolated by viral culture. Paired acute-and convalescent-phase sera were available for 38 (70%) of the participants and the determination of anti-RSV IgG antibody titres was performed on these samples by an ELISA. Among these recruits, three (8%) demonstrated serological evidence of recent RSV infection as indicated by a ‡4-fold increase in RSV-specific IgG antibodies between acute and convalescent sera. Two trainees (6%) showed a twofold increase in anti-RSV IgG titre, 26 trainees (72%) showed no change in titre and the remaining five trainees (14%) demonstrated a reduction in anti-RSV IgG titre. Two pairs of samples were excluded from the analysis because of indeterminable IgG titres and prefractionation haemolysis. Molecular beacon real-time nested PCR detected the presence of RSV RNA in 3 (6%) of the 54 samples. Conventional nested PCR failed to detect the presence of RSV RNA in any of these samples. The estimated RNA levels of positive samples ranged from those equivalent to 1.0 · 10 )4 to 2.0 · 10 )4 pfu ⁄ ml (mean, 2.0 · 10 )4 pfu ⁄ ml). (This assay can detect both virion RNA and viral mRNA.) Respiratory syncytial virus was detected among the six different recruits by either PCR or serology, therefore after combining the data the prevalence of RSV among the participants was determined to be 14% (an additive prevalence was determined as the three recruits of 38 (8%) positive for RSV infection by serology were different to the three recruits of 54 (6%) positive by PCR). The clinical data associated with each identified virus are summarized in Table 2 .
