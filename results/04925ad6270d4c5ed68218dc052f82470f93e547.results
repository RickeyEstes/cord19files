In total, 2058 patients (out of 2061) that did not consume antibiotics in the month before consultation were randomized. Symptom duration and symptom severity were reported for 87% (1793/2058) and 88% (1804/2024) of patients, respectively. Illness deterioration (or no deterioration) was documented in 98% (2024/ 2058) of whom 18% (355/2024) experienced illness deterioration. The vast majority of those with illness deterioration represented reconsultation with new or worsening symptoms. Sample size information for subgroup analyses is presented in Fig. 1 .
