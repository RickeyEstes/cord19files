Genetically diverse mice display a broad range of phenotypes upon M. tuberculosis infection. In order to independently assess the contribution of host genotype to M. tuberculosis susceptibility and vaccine protection, we assembled a population of highly diverse and reproducible inbred lines. This diversity panel contained the eight founder lines of the CC and DO populations, which include five relatively diverse classical inbred strains (A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/LtJ, and NZO/H1LtJ) and three wild-derived inbred strains (CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ), hereinafter abbreviated to A/J, B6, 129, NOD, NZO, CAST, PWK, and WSB. We also took advantage of additional recombinant CC lines, since the range observed for polygenic traits in this type of panel is often much greater in the genetically mosaic offspring than in the founders (57, 58) . Recombinant lines were included in this panel based on their relative resistance or susceptibility to Smith et al. M. tuberculosis after intravenous challenge, which was determined in a related study. To characterize the range of M. tuberculosis susceptibility represented in the diversity panel, we infected groups of each genotype with strain H37Rv via the aerosol route and monitored disease over time. When the population was analyzed in the aggregate (Fig. 1A , B, and C), we observed a range of susceptibility similar to that observed in completely outbred DO animals derived from the same founders (54) . The lung and spleen CFU burdens varied over a range of 1,000-to 10,000-fold, and some animals required euthanasia after only 4 weeks of infection. When the panel was assessed at the genotype level (Fig. 1D , E, and F), we found that these differences in susceptibility were reproducible within each genotype and were therefore highly heritable. Based on the bacterial burdens in lungs at 6 weeks postinfection, the genotypes could be ranked based on susceptibility (Fig. 1D) . The B6 strain, generally considered to be the most resistant of the classical inbred lines (59) , showed intermediate susceptibility in our panel, maintaining lung pathogen burdens of approximately 10 6 CFU throughout the infection. The CC recombinant line, CC001, proved to be the most resistant to infection by 6 weeks, while the wild-derived line of M. musculus domesticus, WSB, was the most susceptible. The phenotypes of these outlier strains were notable. CC001 was the only line in the panel in which the lung CFU burdens decreased between weeks 3 and 6 postinfection (P ϭ 0.044 by t test). This relatively modest decrease was the first indication that this strain progressively kills M. tuberculosis over time (as shown in the subsequent studies presented below; see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). In contrast, the WSB and CC042 strains were both unable to control bacterial replication (P ϭ 0.0001 for WSB and P Ͻ 0.0001 for CC042 compared to B6 via one-way analysis of variance [ANOVA] with Tukey's multiple comparison test), lost weight, (P ϭ 0.0039 for WSB and P ϭ 0.0004 for CC042 compared to B6 via one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test), and were moribund after only 4 weeks of infection. Thus, these genotypes were as susceptible as knockout mice lacking critical aspects of CD4 ϩ T cell-driven immunity, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) (60) or major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) (61) . The ability to accurately measure multiple metrics of disease over time in reproducible lines allowed the identification of traits that are genetically separable. For example, the rate at which bacteria disseminate from the lung to the spleen varied across the panel. Despite harboring similar numbers of M. tuberculosis bacteria in the lungs at 3 weeks postinfection, NOD mice and the wild-derived strain of M. musculus musculus, PWK, harbored significantly fewer CFU in their spleens than B6 (P ϭ 0.020 for NOD versus B6 and P ϭ 0.028 for PWK versus B6 by one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test). In the spleens of PWK mice, the M. tuberculosis burden increased between 3 and 6 weeks postinfection, indicating that M. tuberculosis is able to replicate at this site. Thus, the early deficit in spleen CFU in this genotype could reflect delayed dissemination from the lung, which occurs during this period and has previously been shown to vary with host genotype (62) . We conclude that the diversity panel encompasses a wide variation in TB susceptibility traits and that different aspects of disease may be controlled by distinct genetic polymorphisms. TB pathogenesis and immune response differ qualitatively between strains. The polygenic basis of susceptibility in the diver-sity panel suggested that distinct inflammatory and/or immunological pathways might underlie disease outcomes. Indeed, the lungs of infected mice displayed lesional heterogeneity between strains over time. At 3 and 6 weeks of M. tuberculosis infection, the lungs of B6 mice (the standard for mouse M. tuberculosis studies) contained typical lesions for this strain, i.e., multifocal coalescing histiocytic alveolar pneumonia with perivascular and peribronchiolar lymphocytic aggregates, no necrosis, and diminishing neutrophils over time ( Fig. 2A to C). The lungs of several similarly resistant inbred strains (PWK and CAST) shared these characteristics. In contrast, after only 3 weeks of infection, the susceptible WSB strain had already developed dense neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrates in small and large airways, which after one additional week of infection progressed to widespread necrosis of inflammatory cells and lung tissue, associated with morbidity. Interestingly, the M. tuberculosis burden alone did not predict the extent of lung damage or the type of microscopic lesions in all cases. For example, the lungs of CC001 mice displayed early neutrophil recruitment and necrosis that was not apparent in other similarly resistant lines and was resolved by 6 weeks postinfection, when the bacterial burden had decreased in this strain. Thus, the CC001 strain has some capacity to tolerate and resolve early necrosis and neutrophilic-mediated lung damage due to M. tuberculosis infection. Qualitative differences in the immune response were more apparent when cytokine levels were measured in the lungs ( Fig. 2D and E). Immunity to M. tuberculosis in B6 mice depends on IFN-␥ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which contribute to the effector function of CD4 ϩ T cells (63, 64) . Lung TNF levels were relatively consistent across the panel at 3 weeks postinfection and were only elevated in the moribund WSB mice after 4 weeks. In contrast, the IFN-␥ levels in mice with these genotypes varied by nearly 20-fold at the early time point. The wild-derived lines PWK and CAST and the recombinant CC042 line expressed remarkably low levels of this cytokine that were at or below the limit of detection (LOD) of the assay (LOD ϭ 17 pg/ml). Splenocytes from PWK and CAST mice both produced IFN-␥ upon polyclonal stimulation ex vivo (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material), indicating that these cells were capable of producing detectable levels of cytokine in our assay. Thus, the lack of IFN-␥ expression in the lungs of PWK, CAST, and CC042 mice was not due to an inherent inability to express the cytokine. Instead, these lines appear to mount a distinct response to M. tuberculosis infection, and the relative levels of resistance of the CAST and PWK lines indicate that these responses can be effective in the absence of high levels of IFN-␥. Host genotype determines BCG efficacy. To determine whether genetic polymorphism could influence the degree of protection conferred by vaccination, we immunized a panel of diverse mouse strains with BCG by the subcutaneous route. The mice used for the vaccination study consisted of the same CC founder strains, the highly resistant CC001 recombinant line, and two additional recombinant lines representing susceptible (CC019) and resistant (CC002) phenotypes. Twelve weeks after vaccination, viable BCG was not detected in spleen homogenates of all genotypes (LOD ϭ 20 CFU/spleen), indicating that all mice were able to control infection with this attenuated strain. The mice were then challenged with M. tuberculosis, and the protection elicited by vaccination was determined at 4 and 14 weeks postinfection. We initially analyzed this large panel as an aggregate popula-tion with 53 to 66 animals per group. As seen previously, the bacterial burdens in the lungs and spleens of these animals varied widely, and vaccination did not alter this variation ( Fig. 3A and B) . BCG vaccination reduced the mean M. tuberculosis burdens in the lungs or spleens by 1.7-to 4-fold at each time point, but even with this large group size, the BCG-mediated reduction of bacterial burden was only statistically significant at 4 weeks postinfection. Thus, no durable protection from M. tuberculosis growth could be detected in the aggregated data, which mirrors the lack of protection conferred by BCG in many natural outbred populations. When the data were analyzed at the genotype level, it became clear that the variation in CFU burdens was driven by genotypespecific effects on both M. tuberculosis susceptibility and vaccine efficacy ( Fig. 3C and D) . Using the reduction in M. tuberculosis burden as a metric of vaccine efficacy, we defined "protection" as a decrease in CFU of greater than 0.5 log 10 that reached statistical significance. Based on these criteria, only a subset of genotypes was protected by vaccination. Consistent with previous literature, BCG reduced the bacterial loads in the lungs and spleens of B6 mice by approximately 10-fold. This response was shared in three other lines, two recombinants (CC001 and CC002) and the wild-derived WSB line. In these genotypes, BCG exposure reduced the M. tuberculosis loads by 10-to 100-fold. Notably, these were the only genotypes in which vaccination protected The remaining genotypes were not protected by vaccination in either organ at any time point. In these nonresponding lines, BCG vaccination either had no effect on the M. tuberculosis burden or was associated with an increase in mean CFU, which reached statistical significance for the NZO genotype (P Ͻ 0.05 by t test). In most cases, an increased bacterial burden correlated with weight loss (Fig. 3D) . In mice of the WSB, CC002, and B6 genotypes, BCG vaccination reduced the bacterial burdens and significantly reversed weight loss at one of the two time points. The effects of BCG on CFU and weight loss were discordant for mice of the NZO and CC001 genotypes, reflecting unique phenotypes that will be discussed below. Average percent weight change of each mouse strain relative to initial body weight for BCG-vaccinated and naive mice at 4 and 14 weeks. The percent weight changes were compared between naive and BCG-vaccinated mice within each mouse strain (unpaired t test). n ϭ 6 mice per strain per time point for naive or BCG-vaccinated mice. *, P Ͻ 0.05; **, P Ͻ 0.01; ***, P Ͻ 0.001. TB susceptibility and BCG efficacy are genetically separable traits. The ability to serially evaluate the same host genotype allowed multiple traits to be measured independently in the vaccinated and unvaccinated state. To investigate potential mechanisms that determine vaccine efficacy, we searched for correlates of BCG-mediated protection among the traits measured during primary infection. These traits included lung cytokine measurements as a metric of adaptive immunity, CFU as a measure of antimicrobial capacity, and weight loss as a surrogate for systemic disease. Upon correlating disease and immune metrics with the degree of BCG protection, we identified a number of clusters of covariant traits. A single cluster contained virtually all traits associated with BCG-mediated protection, including all metrics of antimicrobial efficacy and protection from weight loss at 4 weeks postinfection (Fig. 4A, green box) . The cluster did not contain any traits related to M. tuberculosis susceptibility in the unvaccinated state, and no specific correlation between M. tuberculosis susceptibility and BCG efficacy was evident ( Fig. 4B and C). Furthermore, BCG caused the largest reductions in CFU in the CC001 and WSB lines, the most resistant and susceptible lines in the study, respectively (Fig. 4B , orange and purple). Thus, M. tuberculosis susceptibility and BCG efficacy were genetically separable. In addition to all traits related to BCG protection, the BCG efficacy-related cluster of traits also included another metric of immune response that correlated strongly with the degree of BCG-mediated protection, the early production of IFN-␥ by unvaccinated animals ( Fig. 3D and E) . The capacity to produce other T cell cytokines, such as TNF, was less predictive of BCG efficacy. Upon examination of individual genotypes, two of the wildderived lines, CAST and PWK, were particularly notable for producing nearly undetectable levels of IFN-␥ upon M. tuberculosis infection and receiving little or no benefit from BCG vaccination ( Fig. 4D and E, red and green) . Long-term protection depends on a combination of traits. In this panel of genetically diverse mice, we found that the extent of disease at later time points depended on the intrinsic susceptibility of the animal as much as the effect of vaccination. For example, despite the nearly 100-fold reduction in lung M. tuberculosis burden at 4 weeks postinfection, BCG only marginally extended the survival of the highly susceptible WSB strain, from 4 to 6 weeks, and ultimately did not protect this strain from disease. Conversely, even without vaccination, the resistant CC001 and CC002 strains had the remarkable ability to kill 90 to 95% of M. tuberculosis bacteria between 4 and 14 weeks postinfection ( Fig. 3 ; see also Fig S2 in the supplemental material) . As a result, unvaccinated animals of these genotypes harbored bacterial burdens at the later time point that were similar to the burdens in the vaccinated B6 group. The relative resistance of this CC001 line likely explains its ability to gain weight throughout the infection, regardless of BCG vaccination (Fig. 3D) . We also found that mice could benefit from vaccination even if the M. tuberculosis burden was not reduced. For example, even though BCG-vaccinated NZO mice harbored significantly more M. tuberculosis bacteria in their lungs than their unvaccinated counterparts at 4 weeks postinfection, vaccination still reversed M. tuberculosis-induced weight loss between 4 and 14 weeks (Fig. 3D) . The NZO mouse strain has been described to develop a polygenic form of type II diabetes at about the same age as the animals used in our study (65) . As chronic hyperglycemia can increase M. tuberculosis susceptibility in mice (66, 67) , we hypothesized that an interaction between vaccination and diabetes initiation might underlie the paradoxical effects of BCG on M. tuberculosis burden and weight loss. Indeed, while 5 of 6 unvaccinated animals were found to have fasting blood glucose levels above 500 mg/dl at 14 weeks postinfection, 0 of 6 vaccinated animals were diabetic ( Fig. 5A and B) . In the NZO genotype, diabetes strongly predicted weight loss but not CFU (Fig. 5C and D) . Our diversity mouse panel also included NOD mice that develop autoimmune type I diabetes (68) . No significant effect of BCG on either M. tuberculosis burden or blood glucose concentration was evident in this strain, possibly due to the variable penetrance of diabetes (see Fig. S2J in the supplemental material). Thus, the major protective effect of BCG in M. tuberculosisinfected NZO mice appears to be the prevention of type II diabetes. Taken together, our observations in the genetic diversity panel suggest that while the protective efficacy of BCG can be separated from TB susceptibility, the ultimate effect of vaccination on the outcome of infection is influenced by a variety of factors, including intrinsic susceptibility to TB and complex interactions with comorbidities, such as diabetes.
