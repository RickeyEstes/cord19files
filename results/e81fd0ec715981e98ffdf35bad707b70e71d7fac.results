Cysts were detected in the feces from the fifth day post-inoculation (p.i.) onwards in most dogs inoculated with cysts and trophozoites, except dog 3 of group A which presented cysts in the feces at 6 p.i. The dogs of groups A and B presented positive results for G. duodenalis up to 49 p.i., alternation of positive and negative results with variable production of cysts being observed from this day onwards. The dogs of group A demonstrated negative results between 91 and 105 p.i., thereafter presenting positive results up to 140 p.i. again. Cysts were not detected in the feces starting from 140 p.i. in the dogs of group A and starting from 112 p.i. in group B, with results remaining negative until the end of the experimental period (Fig. 1) . No alterations were observed in physical parameters analyzed. Significant differences were observed in values of red blood cell counts, hemoglobin and hematocrit for dogs of group A compared to those of groups B and control (Fig. 2) , principally at 15 p.i. ( p 0.05). The hematimetric indices of MGV, MGH and MGHC did not present significant differences. The mean values of immature neutrophils of group B were significantly greater than those of the groups A and control at 15, 60, 75 and 165 p.i. ( p 0.05) although no differences were seen for segmented neutrophils (Fig. 3) . The mean values of eosinophils in dogs of groups A and B (Fig. 4) were both significantly higher than those of the control group at 120, 135 and 165 p.i. Biochemical analyses of total protein, albumin, alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamyltransferase, urea and creatinine revealed no statistically significant differences between the groups.
