Design and construction of DENV1 full-length infectious clone. The recombinant DENV1 infectious clone (rDENV1ic) was synthesized as a panel of four continuous cDNA segments that span the entire genome ( Fig. 1A) (19) . Based on sequence from a laboratory strain of DENV1 West Pac '74, each segment is flanked by class IIS restriction endonuclease sites that cleave palindromic sequences into asymmetric 3-nucleotide overhangs. These overhangs permit directional assembly of the cleaved fragments to generate full-length viral cDNA. With the exception of an ablated restriction site (see Materials and Methods), the sequence directly reconstitutes the wild-type (WT) laboratory strain. The ligated cDNA fragments are then used as a template to produce full-length viral RNA, which is electroporated into C6/36 mosquito cells. To demonstrate transfection efficiencies of full-length transcripts, the results of the infectious center assay indicate low, but stable infection (0.4%) (Fig. 1B) . After several days, cell culture supernatant containing progeny rDENV1ic virions is harvested and passaged once on C6/36 cells to generate working virus stocks. RNA isolated from infected cells was verified relative to the parental wild-type strain using genome length analysis and finding no differences in the consensus amino acid sequences. Similarly, endpoint titers from C6/36 cells (Fig. 1C) found no notable difference between the viruses derived from wild-type DENV1 and rDENV1ic in regard to replication. In C6/36 cells, both wild-type DENV1-and infectious-clone-derived virus maintain similar sized foci following infection (Fig. 1D) . Together, the results indicate that no replication deficit nor focus formation deficit was observed between the wild-type and infectious clone virus. Replication kinetics of rDENV1ic. Some of the previously described reverse genetic systems for DENVs have been hampered by replication attenuation relative to the wild-type strain despite identical consensus sequences (6) . To determine whether rDENV1ic is attenuated relative to the wild-type virus, growth curves were completed in C6/36 mosquito cells over a 7-day time course (Fig. 1E) . The data indicate that wild-type DENV1 and rDENV1ic replicate equivalently, peaking in focus-forming units 5 days after infection (Fig. 1E ). Percent infection of C6/36 cells also demonstrated no significant difference between the wild-type and infectious clone with nearly 100% infection observed 4 days after infection (Fig. 1F ). We next examined replication in the human monocyte-derived U937 cell line stably expressing DC-SIGN (dendritic cellspecific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin), a known DENV attachment factor (Fig. 1G ); similar to the C6/36 mosquito cell line, we observed no difference in the replication of the wild-type DENV1 and rDENV1ic in DC-SIGNexpressing U937 (U937ϩDC-SIGN) cells. These results demonstrate no detectable attenuation of the rDENV1ic clone relative to the wild-type strain in either insect or human cells. Display of antibody epitopes on rDENV1ic. Antibody binding and neutralization are critical issues in DENV pathogenesis in humans; as such, the infectious clone and parental WT strain must display the same surface architecture and epitopes. To compare the display of antibody epitopes, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed using a panel of DENV1-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against rDENV1ic and the parental wild-type strain (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). MAb 1F4, derived from a DENV1-infected patient (20) , binds in the envelope domain I (EDI) region and extends into the EDI and domain II (EDII) hinge region (21) ; ELISA with MAb 1F4 produced strong and equivalent binding to both the wild-type and infectious clone ( Fig. 2A) . Similarly, the EDI, EDIII, and EDI/II hinge region is the epitope for MAb 14C10, which also bound similarly between the wild-type DENV1 and rDENV1ic (Fig. 2B) . Finally, MAb 1C19.2, an EDIII antibody, also bound similarly to both wild-type DENV1 and rDENV1ic (Fig. 2C) . Together, the results indicate that rDENV1ic displays the same antibody epitopes as the wild-type control virus. We also tested the binding of DENV serotype 2, 3, and 4 monoclonal antibodies (Table S1 ) to rDENV1ic. Beginning with a DENV2-specific antibody, MAb 2D22 (22) , failed to bind to either wild-type DENV1 or rDENV1ic (Fig. 2D) . Similarly, MAb 5J7 (23) also fails to bind to rDENV1ic or wild-type strain while efficiently binding DENV3 (Fig. 2E ). Finally, MAb 5H2, an EDI antibody specific to DENV4, showed no binding to either DENV1 iteration (Fig. 2F) . Together, combined with DENV1 monoclonal data, the results indicate that rDENV1ic has the same surface architecture and epitopes as the wild-type strain. Antibody neutralization of rDENV1ic. While observing equivalent antibody binding between rDENV1ic and wild-type virus by ELISA, neutralization is an even more sensitive functional assay to compare viruses. Small changes in binding conformation may induce enhancement versus neutralization; as such, these assays must be equivalent between the infectious clone and the wild-type virus to justify the use of rDENVic for vaccine and immunogenicity studies. Using a focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT), we examined the ability of well-defined MAbs to block virus infectivity. For all three DENV1 monoclonal antibodies (1F4, 14C10, and 1C19.2), percent neutralization was nearly identical between the wild-type DENV1 and rDENV1ic ( Fig. 3A to C). Similar to ELISA results, monoclonal antibodies against the other DENV serotypes were unable to neutralize either the clone or wild-type virus ( Fig. 3D to F) . Extending studies to a U937ϩDC-SIGN flow-based neutralization assay, percent infection results revealed overlapping neutralization of rDENV1ic and wild-type DENV1 following DENV1 monoclonal antibody incubations ( Fig. S1A to C). In addition, none of the other DENV serotype-specific antibodies provides any significant reduction in viral infection (Fig. S1D to F) . Together, the results match the ELISA data and indicate antibody neutralization fidelity between the infectious clone and wild-type viruses in two independent neutralization assays. Gain of DENV4 monoclonal binding and neutralization. To use the rDENVic to study antibody responses to specific epitopes, we generated a DENV1 mutant virus that incorporates the DENV4 5H2 epitope into the DENV1 backbone virus. 5H2 is a DENV4 type-specific and strongly neutralizing MAb isolated from a nonhuman primate infected with DENV4 (24, 25) . A high-resolution structure of 5H2 bound to DENV4 E protein has led to the identification of 17 residues within EDI that interact with the antibody (Table 1) (24, 25) . Of these 17 amino acids, five are conserved between DENV1 and DENV4. The remaining 12 residues in DENV1 were replaced with those from DENV4, by manipulating plasmid A of the DENV1 infectious clone (rDENV1ic-5H2-epitope [rDENV1ic-EDI]) (Fig. 4A) ( Table 1 ). The DENV4 MAb 5H2 bound and neutralized the rDENV1ic-EDI virus ( Fig. 4B and C) . As the parental clone and wild-type DENV1 were not recognized by 5H2 (Fig. 4B and C) , these results confirm successful transfer of a conformational epitope from DENV4 into DENV1. Ablation of DENV1 monoclonal binding and neutralization. The epitope of DENV4 MAb 5H2 overlaps with the known DENV1 type-specific epitopes recognized by human neutralizing MAbs 1F4 and 14C10 (21) . Importantly, 1F4 has more than onethird of its predicted contact residues replaced in the rDENV1ic-EDI virus ( Fig. 5A and Table 1 ). Insertion of the DENV4 5H2 epitope partially disrupted the DENV1 1F4 epitope, resulting in an 80-fold reduction in 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) but not complete ablation in binding of 1F4 to rDENV1ic-EDI (Fig. 5B) . Similarly, neutralization assays indicate that 1F4 nearly lost all of its ability to neutralize the rDENV1ic-EDI mutant (Fig. 5C) . MAb 14C10 has a smaller percentage (15%) of its epitope disrupted in the rDENV1ic-EDI virus ( Fig. 5D and Table 1 ), as it has additional contact residues in EDIII from the neighboring dimer that are maintained (Fig. S2) (26) . Despite this smaller percentage, binding of 14C10 is still reduced (Fig. 5E) , and 14C10 neutralization of TABLE 1 Virus amino acid sequences and MAb epitopes a a Amino acid sequences for wild-type rDENV1ic, rDENV4ic are shown with chimeric rDENV1ic-EDI residues highlighted in orange (DENV4 amino acids transplanted into the DENV1 backbone sequence). rDENV1ic-EDI virus that was recovered contained an additional mutation (light orange) unrelated to the transplanted 5H2 epitope. Contact residues for MAbs 5H2, 1F4, 14C10, and E103 are shown in green, magenta, purple, and cyan, respectively. rDENV1ic-EDI is mostly lost (Fig. 5F ). In contrast, DENV1 monoclonal antibody E103, which targets an EDIII epitope (Fig. 5G ) (27) , had no significant reduction in ELISA binding relative to wild-type virus or the infectious clone (Fig. 5H) . Additionally, MAb E103 maintained robust neutralization, indicating maintenance of other DENV1 epitopes within the mutant virus (Fig. 5I) . In summary, the introduction of the 5H2 epitope residues to create the rDENV1ic-EDI virus leads to efficient display of a heterologous DENV4 epitope and the disruption of two native DENV1 type-specific epitopes. Our results illustrate the utility of the infectious clone for transferring DENV epitopes between serotypes and identify functional consequences on other conserved epitopes within the transferred amino acid regions.
