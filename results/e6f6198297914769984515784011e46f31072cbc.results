Since passive protection is important for preventing rotavirus infection in neonates, it is important that neonates receive sufficient quantities of neutralizing antibodies in milk from their mothers. In this study we were interested in determining the best regimen of immunizations against BRV which would result in the highest neutralizing antibody levels in milk. To achieve this goal. mice were immunized with either live or killed BRV via different routes and the levels of serum antibody against rotavirus were monitored throughout the immunization schedule up to parturition. After parturition, anti-rotavirus antibodies were determined in lacteal secretions for 11 days. using an ELISA and virus neutralization test. Antibody titers in serum, colostrum and milk are shown in Figs. 1-4. Milk samples were also examined for determination of different immunoglobulin (Ig) classes. Data showing ratios of various subtypes in milk collected from dams immunized with either live or killed BRV are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. The distribution of different subtypes in milk samples revealed IgG to be the most predominant antibody followed by IgM and IgA. It is interesting to note that regardless of the route of immunization, a gradual increase in the antibody titer in the lacteal secretions was observed up to 9 days post-partum, with the greatest increase on day 9. followed by a decrease in titer on day 11; a unique observation compared with other species. ltntnunizatiotz with killed bovirle rotavirm To determine whether killed BRV can produce lactogenic anti-rotavirus antibody response, experiments were performed using this antigen orally and in combinations of other routes. Animals were immunized by the following route using killed BRV: 0 x 3, 0 x IM x 2, IM X 3 and IMam x 3. Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) and Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA) were used only with the IM route of immunization (Table 1) . Immunization with killed BRV significantly increased anti-rotavirus antibodies in serum in all groups regardless of the route of immunization (Fig. 1) . The rapid immune response observed a week after the first immunization as compared to an almost negligible titer on day 0, does not reflect that animals were primed before immunization because mice used in this study were pre-tested for anti-rotavirus antibodies and all were found to be seronegative and control mice remained seronegative throughout the study. However, it does show that rotavirus is highly immunogenic. Among all the groups immunized with killed BRV, the group immunized 3 times via the IMam route showed the best anti-rotavirus serum antibody response. An interesting but unexplainable decrease in antibody occured 21 days post-immunization in animals immunized via the IMam route (Fig. 1 ). However. a second immunization at 21 days increased the antibody titer above that of any other group. Although the second immunization boosted the antibody titers in all groups, the third immunization at 42 days did not show any effect on the level of antibody production in any of the groups under study (Fig. 1) . Antibody titers against rotavirus in lacteal secretions as determined by ELISA. varied from 2-3 log,,, between groups one day post-parturition ( Fig. 2) . Animals immunized 0 x 3 had the highest titers whereas the IM x 3 had the lowest antibody titers. A gradual increase in antibody was observed in all groups with the maximum antibody titer in lacteal secretions being achieved 9 days after parturition. Unlike serum antibodies, the highest lacteal antibody titer occurred in the group immunized 0 x 3 and 0 x IM x 2. The virus neutralization antibody titers in milk showed a similar pattern throughout lactation as did the ELISA titers. However, anti-rotavirus antibody titers, as determined by ELISA, were consistently higher than virus neutralization titers, with the exception of the group immunized 0 x 3 which showed slightly higher neutralization titers on day 1 and 3 after parturition (Fig. 2) . immunization with live bovine rotavirus Since killed antigen produced an excellent response following oral immunization, attempts were made to do similar studies with live virus. Animals were immunized by the following routes using live BRV: 0 x 3, 0 x IM x 2, IM x 3, IMam x 3 and IMam X IM x 2 with or without adjuvant as indicated in the immunization schedule (Table 1) . Immunization with live BRV induced the production of high levels of anti-rotavirus antibodies in serum of dams in all groups. The pattern of immune response was rapid, similar to the groups immunized with killed BRV. One exception was the group immunized IMam x IM x 2, which revealed significantly higher antia rotavirus antibodies 35 days after primary immunization (2 wk after the second immunization). There was a rapid decrease in antibody titer in this particular group 21 days after the first immunization, but the second immunization at 21 days induced a higher level of antibody than in the rest of the groups. The third immunization at 42 days did not increase antibody production, and antibody levels in serum started declining towards the time of parturition (Fig. 3) . Titers of anti-rotavirus antibodies in lacteal secretions, as determined by ELISA, also revealed a similar pattern as seen in the groups immunized with killed BRV. The colostrum and milk samples collected up to a week after parturition showed a gradual increase in antibody titers as determined by ELISA. The highest antirotavirus antibody titer in all groups was observed on day 9 post-parturition. The maximum titer of antibody at this point was observed in the group immunized IMam x IM x 2. The titers started declining thereafter (Fig. 4) . Virus neutralizing antibody titers in the lacteal secretions exhibited a similar pattern throughout lactation. The anti-rotavirus antibody titers, as determined by ELISA, were consistently higher than virus neutralizing antibody titers in all the groups (Fig. 4) .
