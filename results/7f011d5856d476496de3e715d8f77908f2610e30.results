A recombinant CsrA dimer with a single CesT binding site. According to previous studies 11, 12, 28 , both CesT and CsrA exist as stable homodimers in solution. These results remind us of the possibility that two identical ligand binding sites could be present in both CesT and CsrA dimers. We therefore first investigate the binding features between the two proteins via analytical gel filtration chromatography. CsrA was initially expressed as a GST-fusion protein and then enzymatically digested to remove the fusion-tags (Fig. 1a) ; while CesT was expressed as a 6xHis-tagged protein. Both proteins were individually prepared to homogeneity and then mixed for in vitro binding analyses. As expected, stable CesT/CsrA complex forms in solution. The resultant complex species is mainly eluted in the void peak with an estimated molecular weight of more than 440 kDa and exhibits high heterogeneity (Fig. 1b) . Noted that CesT and CsrA dimers are of~35.4 kDa and~13.7 kDa respectively, the result is therefore consistent with our expectations that both CesT and CsrA dimers contain two ligand binding sites, leading to irregular protein aggregations upon complex formation. We further determined the real time binding kinetics between CesT and CsrA via surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The observed profile revealed typical slow-on/slow-off binding characteristics, and fits well with the Bivalent-Analyte model which describes the binding of a bivalent protein (in the current case the CsrA dimer) to an immobilized ligand (in the current case CesT) (Fig. 1c) . The affinity (K D ) of the first ligand binding site in CsrA to CesT was calculated to be~148 nM. To obtain homogeneous CesT/CsrA protein complexes that are suitable for structural study, we set out to disrupt the complex aggregations arising from binding of the two bivalent proteins. It is notable that CsrA and its homologous proteins in other bacteria contain an extended C-terminal α-helix which has been shown in previous reports to play pivotal roles in ligand binding 23, 26 . We therefore hypothesized that this terminal helical component, which extends from E45 to Y61 (Fig. 1a) , is also involved in engaging CesT. To verify this hypothesis, we conducted a GST-pulldown experiment with either the wildtype (WT) CsrA or a CsrA-variant (CsrA-C del , residues M1-R44) which lacks the C-terminal helix. While the WT protein efficiently pulldowns CesT, CsrA-C del completely lost its CesT binding avidity (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The result enabled us to make a new CsrA construct that reserves only a single CesT binding site by linking CsrA-C del with full-length CsrA via a tenresidue linker (GGGGSGGGGS) (Fig. 1a) . As expected, the resultant recombinant protein (denoted Re-CsrA hereafter) remains competent in CesT engagement and forms stable complex with CesT in solution as with WT CsrA (Fig. 1b) . In contrast to the WT protein-complex, however, the CesT/Re-CsrA complex behaves as homogeneous protein species with an estimated molecular weight of~60 kDa, coinciding well with two Re-CsrA (~12.5 kDa) molecules binding to one CesT dimer. The interactions between Re-CsrA and CesT were further analyzed via SPR. In contrast to WT CsrA, the recombinant protein binds CesT with a fast-on/fast-off mode (Fig. 1c) . Despite of the altered binding kinetics (which is commonly observed in the ligand/receptor interactions when the interface residues are mutated [34] [35] [36] , the affinity between Re-CsrA and CesT, which is calculated to be~151 nM, is in good accordance with that observed for the WT proteins. The recombinant protein therefore represents a good candidate for structural investigations on the molecular basis of CesT/CsrA recognition. The complex structure between CesT and Re-CsrA. Inspired by the high homogeneity of the CesT/Re-CsrA complex, we used this protein species for crystal screening and managed to collect a dataset of 2.3-Å resolution. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined to R work = 0.233 and R free = 0.251, respectively ( Table 1 ). The final model contains, in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, two CesT/Re-CsrA complexes which are essentially of the same structure. Superimposition of the two complexes reveals a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.713 Å for all the equivalent Cα atoms. As expected, each complex is composed of two Re-CsrA molecules and one CesT dimer (Fig. 2) . For Re-CsrA, clear electron densities could be traced for residues M1-P37 of the CsrA-C del moiety and residues M1-K55 of the following full-length CsrA entity. These amino acids assemble into a compact β-barrel core with one terminal helix extending out into the bulk solvent. Overall, the Re-CsrA structure is quite similar to that of the swapped dimer of native CsrA. Superimposition of the two structures revealed both wellaligned core-barrel strands and the terminal helix. The secondary structure components of Re-CsrA (strands β1′-β4′ in CsrA-C del , β1-β5 and α1 in full-length CsrA) were therefore labeled such that CsrA-C del was viewed as an equivalent to the second protomer of the native dimer, highlighted with the prime symbols. Without helix α1′, Re-CsrA also lacks traceable electron densities for the β5′ strand due to flexibility, which could be otherwise clearly observed in the native CsrA dimer structure (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). It is also noteworthy that Re-CsrA uses its peripheral side-patch, created by strands β1′, β4, β5, and helix α1, for CesT binding (Fig. 2) . The structure therefore in turn verifies our analytical gel filtration results, demonstrating that the recombinant CsrA protein indeed retains a single but integral CesT binding site. For CesT, two protomer molecules of the same fold assemble into a tight dimer. Each protomer is topologically arranged in an αβββαββαα manner, structurally folding into a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β1-β5) in the center which is further wrapped by three α-helices (α1-α3) at peripheral. The fourth helix (α4), however, is linked to α3 via a long inter-loop and extends to the vicinity of the other CesT molecule in the dimer (Fig. 2) . On the whole, the two CesT protomers symmetrically pack against each other around the α2-β4 helix-strand motif, leading to a dimer with typical two-fold non-crystallographic rotation symmetry. Accordingly, the bound Re-CsrA molecules are related by the same two-fold axis, recognizing the same surface components in CesT (Fig. 2) . A CesT dimer with a swapped C-terminal helix. A previous study on CesT reveals that the molecule, unlike the other bacterial T3SS chaperones as exemplified by the SigE molecule of Salmonella enterica, exhibited a unique domain-swapped dimeric architecture 11 . In this dimer structure (denoted dimer form A hereafter), the N-terminal α1 helix, β1 strand, and their intervening loop form a discrete module, intertwining with the other protomer such that its β1 strand pairs with strand β2 from the other CesT molecule. In addition, the C-terminal residues K140-E143 fold into an extra strand (β6), aligning in an antiparallel manner with β1 on the other side (Fig. 3a ). In such a dimer, the long α3 helices from the two protomers further symmetrically pack against each other. This domain-arrangement mode therefore created a CesT dimer with a two-fold rotation symmetry around an axis that locates in between the two swapped β-sheets and vertically passes through the packed α3 helices (Fig. 3a) . It is also notable that due to strand-swapping, the dimer is predominantly stabilized by the main-chain hydrogen bond contacts among adjacent β-strands with hydrophobic interactions of less profoundness contributed by the apolar residue side-chains. In the complex structure of Re-CsrA bound to CesT, however, the chaperone molecule adopted a quite different dimeric fold (denoted dimer form B hereafter). The N-terminal α1-loop-β1 module, instead of being swapped into the other protomer, remains unswapped and pairs with strand β2 of its own molecule. Without the swapped β1 strand, the C-terminal residues K140-E143 form a loop in our structure, which were otherwise of rigid strand conformation (β6) in the form A dimer described above. Overall, the CesT molecules assemble into a dimer around the α2-β4 motif such that the α2 helices in the two protomers are aligned with each other in an almost parallel manner. The dimer structure is therefore symmetrically related with a two-fold rotation axis which vertically passes through the packed α2-β4 components (Fig. 3b) . We further compared the single protomer structures derived from the two forms of CesT dimers. As expected, the most profound structural variations were observed in their terminal components: the N-terminal α1-loop-β1 module and the extended C-terminal motif. The former flipped~180°from swapping out for inter-molecule β-paring in dimer form A to folding back for intra-molecule β-pair interactions in dimer form B (Fig. 3c) ; while the latter similarly experienced a significant conformational change, reorienting for~160°from interacting as a β6 strand (in dimer form A) with β1 to spreading as an extended loop and an α4 helix (in dimer form B) over the molecule surface (Fig. 3c) . It is also notable that with profound divergence in its orientation, the α1-loop-β1 module retains essentially the same structure except that its β1 strand exhibited a slight (~15°) orientation-difference relative to helix α1 between the two dimer forms (Fig. 3c) . On the whole, the architecture of the form B CesT dimer is quite similar to that observed in the unswapped salmonella SigE molecule ( Supplementary Fig. 3a, 3b) . In both dimers, the two protomers assemble around the α2 helix and β4 strand, forming a core dimeric interface in which multiple apolar and aromatic residues created a strong hydrophobic center. The CesT dimer, however, was further clenched at peripheral by the extended Cterminal motif. A most important stabilizing contact was contributed by the α4 helix, which protrudes into the otherwise exposed groove formed by helices α2 and α3 in the other protomer and presents several residues (especially Y153) for mainly apolar inter-molecule interactions ( Supplementary  Fig. 3c ). It is unexpected that the C-terminal part of CesT forms a helical structure and extends exclusively into the other protomer of the dimer. It is notable that other T3SS chaperones, such as SycT from Yersinia enterocolitica, also contains an extended C-terminal loop which interacts with the β2-β3 interloop from the other molecule of the dimer 37, 38 . Nevertheless, CesT extends its C-terminal helix into the other molecule to a much greater extent, providing much stronger and more intimate inter-molecule interactions than those observed for SycT ( Supplementary Fig. 3d ). Such dimeric arrangement with a swapped C-terminal domain seems unique which has not been observed in the other T3SS chaperone structures reported previously [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . It is also noteworthy that the α2-α3 helices of one CesT molecule also in turn stabilized the swapped Structural basis of the binding between CesT and CsrA. The atomic binding details between CesT and CsrA were then systematically investigated based on the complex structure solved in this study. Overall, Re-CsrA utilizes its intact CsrA-dimer part composed of helix α1, strands β1′, β4, β5, and their intervening loops for CesT engagement, contacting mainly the β1-β2 interloop, the long α3 helix, and the swapped terminal helix α4 (from the other protomer) in the chaperone dimer (Fig. 4a ). In total, these components buried a surface area of 836.2 Å 2 in Re-CsrA and 893.9 Å 2 in the CesT dimer, respectively. Along this extended interface, the inter-molecule amino acid interactions can further be allocated to three binding patches (Patch1, 2, and 3) as to the protomer affiliations (to either the parental molecule of the dimer or the second protomer) of the engaging components. The first patch involves Re-CsrA strand β1′ and CesT helix α3, representing interactions contributed by the second CsrA protomer with the parental CesT molecule (Fig. 4a) . The former presents three residues I3, L4, and T5 to pack against CesT E121, providing both hydrogen bond and apolar carbon-carbon interactions (Fig. 4b) . In contrast to Patch1, Patch2 is much more extended and consists of multiple components from the CsrA and CesT parental molecules (Fig. 4a) . A series of charged and hydrophilic residues were observed to locate in this second patch, forming a strong polar (hydrogen bond and/or salt bridge) contact network. These include the Re-CsrA residues R31 located in strand β4, K38 in the β4-β5 inter-loop, and V42 (with its mainchain groups) and R44 in strand β5 interacting with the CesT amino acids D34 in the β1-β2 intervening loop, Y37 in the β2 strand, and E121, N122, N129, T133 in the α3 helix and its following loop (Fig. 4c) . For Patch3, it is mainly the parental CsrA contacting the second CesT protomer, involving strand β5 and helix α1 in Re-CsrA and the swapped α4 helix in CesT (Fig. 4a) . The α4-residues, including H151 and Y152, were observed to protrude out for Re-CsrA interactions, stacking over CsrA residues H43, R44, I47, R50, I51, and E54 to provide dozens of hydrophobic contacts via their apolar carbon atoms. In addition, Y152 of CesT also forms two hydrogen bonds with CsrA H43 and R44, respectively (Fig. 4d) . The defined amino acid interactions therefore revealed a CesT/CsrA binding mode which is mediated mainly by the polar interactions among hydrophilic interface residues. It is also notable that the full-capacity binding between CesT and CsrA requires both proteins first assembling into a dimer. To verify the observed binding mode, a series of mutant CesT and CsrA proteins were prepared. Via CD spectroscopy and comparative analytical gel filtration, we first showed that all the mutant proteins are properly folded and remain existing as dimers in solution ( Supplementary Fig. 4a, 4b) . The proteins were then tested for their ligand binding avidities via ELISA. For CesT, deletion of the C-terminal α4 helix (CesT-C del ) and individual or simultaneous substitution of the key interface residues E121 and Y152 with alanine all dramatically jeopardized its ability to engage CsrA. While WT CesT potently binds to both native CsrA and Re-CsrA, the CesT mutants only show a very weak binding at the highest concentration tested (500 µg/ml) (Fig. 4e, f) . Reciprocally, the four basic interface-residues (R31, K38, H43, and R44) in CsrA were mutated (to alanine) and the resultant mutant protein was tested for its interaction with WT CesT. As expected, this tetra-mutant CsrA protein completely lost its CesT-binding capacity, as with the C-terminal deletion variant CsrA-C del (Fig. 4g) . In summarization, these results are in good accordance with the atomic binding details defined in the complex structure, in turn verifying the observed CesT/CsrA interaction mode. Mechanism of CsrA modulation by CesT. It is notable that CsrA, as a global post-transcriptional regulator, exerts its regulatory function by binding specifically to the mRNA RBS sequence, thereby leading to translational repression 22 . The atomic binding mode between CsrA and the RBS RNA has been structurally investigated with the pseudomonas CsrA homolog of RsmE 23 . Although the structure of E. coli CsrA bound with RNA remains unavailable thus far, the E. coli CsrA and P. fluorescens RsmE share high sequence identity and conserved structural fold. In addition, previous mutagenesis studies identified two regions in E. coli CsrA (residues 2-7 and 40-47) that are important for its RNA binding avidity in vivo 39 . These two regions fall in good accordance with the structural observations in the RsmE/RNA complex structure. We therefore believe E. coli CsrA shares a similar RNA binding mode to that of RsmE. In such a context, we compared the structure of CesT/Re-CsrA with that of RsmE bound with an 5′-A / U CANGGANG U / A -3′ RNA (corresponding to the RBS sequence of the hcnA gene, PDB code: 2JPP) to learn the possible CsrA-modulation mechanism by CesT. In the RsmE dimer, two RNA moieties individually bound to the β1′/β4/β5 and its symmetrical β1/β4′/ β5′ barrel-patches, defining two identical RNA binding sites (Fig. 5a) . The CesT molecule also engages extensively with the β1′, β4, and β5 strands in Re-CsrA (Fig. 5a) . Superimposition of the two structures on the Re-CsrA/RsmE proteins revealed an extensively overlapped region between the RNA binding site in RsmE and the CesT binding site in CsrA (Fig. 5a) . The binding of CesT to CsrA should therefore competitively inhibits the engagement of CsrA to mRNA, thereby relieving the CsrAmediated translation repression. To further demonstrate the inhibition of CsrA/mRNA interactions by CesT, we performed an RNA-based motility shift assay (RMSA) using a previously reported RNA molecule derived from the 5′UTR of the nleA transcript with the sequence of 5′-CACUAAUAAUAUCAAUG-GAUUGAUAUUAUUAAUG-3′ 5 . While CsrA is able to effectively bind the RNA molecule, addition of CesT indeed antagonizes the binding of CsrA to RNA (Fig. 5b) . Similar results have also been observed in a previous study using the GST fusion protein of CesT 5 . It is also notable that CesT and CsrA, each of which contains two ligand binding sites in their homodimers, could polymerize in solution (Fig. 1b) . In order to investigate, whether polymerization of the CesT/CsrA complex could contribute to CsrA repression by CesT, we performed a comparative RMSA experiment using the CsrA WT + C del mixture (WT CsrA mixing with CsrA-C del in a 1:1 molar ratio) and Re-CsrA, which were first pre-incubated with RNA and then compared for the inhibition efficiencies of the CsrA/RNA interactions by CesT in parallel. In this testing system, the CsrA WT + C del mixture could create equal amounts of the individual intact (containing the C-terminal helix) and the incomplete (lacking the C-terminal helix) ligand-binding sites to the Re-CsrA fusion protein of the same molar quantity. The CesT/CsrA polymerization, however, would only occur in the former case where WT CsrA is present. While the WT + C del mixture is similarly capable of binding to the RNA molecule as Re-CsrA, the inhibition of CsrA/RNA binding by CesT with WT + C del (in which case CesT would polymerize with CsrA) is apparently more effective than that with Re-CsrA (in which case CesT would form uniform complexes with Re-CsrA) (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). These results therefore revealed an interesting notion that the CesT/CsrA polymerization could benefit the effective repression of CsrA by CesT.
