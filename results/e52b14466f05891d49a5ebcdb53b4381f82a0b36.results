A total of 368 paired upper airway samples were collected from 33 children (aged 10 months to 17 years; mean 7.43, median 8.0), yielding a mean of 11.2 samples per patient. Table 1 Table 2 shows the results of the cultures. We detected bacteria in 132 of the sputum specimens (132/368; 35.9%); the most frequently detected microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (102/368; 27.7%), Haemophilus influenzae (14/368; 3.8%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9/368; 2.4%). Other bacteria detected in less than 5 samples were Klebsiella oxytoca, Moraxella catarrhalis, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens. We found 54 virus-bacteria coinfections (54/368; 14.7%); the most common combination was rhinovirus plus S. aureus (28/54) ( Table 3 ). In general, viruses did not persist; the same virus was detected in three or more samples during two months' follow-up in only 8/33 patients (4 rhinovirus and 2 adenovirus). By contrast, S. aureus was detected in subsequent sampling in 6/33 patients and persisted for more than 8 months in all but 1 patient, in whom it persisted for 2 months. No persistence of co-infections was observed. We also analyzed the seasonality of the respiratory infections detected. The highest prevalence of virus detection was in autumn (62/98; 63.2%), followed by winter (42/102; 41.2%); bacteria isolations were more common in spring (40/96; 41.7%) and autumn (40/98; 40.8%) (Fig. 1) . The viruses detected in all four seasons were very similar; rhinovirus was the most common in every season. Nearly all infections with H. influenzae occurred in autumn and winter (Fig. 2) . The most common bacterial infection in all seasons was S. aureus. When we distributed patients into 5 age groups (<2 y, ≥2-<5 y, ≥5-<9 y, ≥9-<12 y, and ≥12 y), we found that the proportion of patients in whom viruses were detected decreased with age: 48.5% of samples were positive in children <2 years old, whereas only 31.4% of samples were positive in those ≥12 years old. By contrast, the proportion of infections due to bacteria was higher in patients >12 years old (Fig. 3) .
