MTase activities. In vitro, CR-VI þ most effectively binds and methylates synthetic RNAs containing the conserved start sequence of hMPV transcripts, preferring a substrate length of nine nucleotides (Fig. 2) . The methylation occurs at the GN7 and N 1 -2 0 O positions (Figs 2 and 3a), with 2 0 O-methylation preceding N7-methylation (Fig. 3a) , an uncommon order of events also occurring in VSV 8 . CR-VI þ , moreover, efficiently methylates uncapped RNAs with 5 0 -phosphate groups (especially pppRNA), primarily at the 2 0 O atom of N1 since almost no 3 H-methyl . Substrate specificity was determined as above, but using various synthetic RNA substrates, and allowing the reactions to proceed for 16 h. Substrates were compared with GpppGGGACAAGU (red and blue panels) and pppGGGACAAGU (green panel), for which the degree of methylation was set at 100% (#, marked bars). The red-shaded panel compares the degree of methylation of nine-nucleotide-long hMPV start sequences with different 5 0 -ends and methylation states (the lighter bars represent uncapped RNAs). The results indicate efficient methylation of RNAs that already carried a (cold) methyl group, either at their N7-guanine or 2 0 O-ribose position (confirming the occurrence of 2 0 O-and N7-methylation, respectively), and of uncapped RNAs (especially pppRNA). The pppRNA substrate is predominantly methylated at N 1 , as substrates that were methylated beforehand at this nucleotide do not undergo substantial additional methylation (green panel). CR-VI þ prefers the hMPV start sequence over the short GpppACCCC sequence, and over RNA-start sequences of Dengue virus and SARS coronavirus, irrespective of their lengths (blue panel). A nine-nucleotide hMPV substrate, however, is much preferred over one with only five nucleotides, indicating that additional interactions take place between the protein and nucleotides 6-9. Consistently a 10-times lower K D (dissociation constant) characterizes the interaction of CR-VI þ with the 9-mer, compared with that with the 5-mer. The K D s, measured in triplicate using a dot-blot assay and listed at the right of the diagram ( ± s.d.'s), also show that capped and uncapped hMPV sequences are bound with comparable affinities, and that 2 0 O-methylated substrates are preferred over unmethylated ones. NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/ncomms9749 ARTICLE transfer takes place onto the pppG m GGACAAGU substrate where this atom is blocked (Fig. 2b , green bars). The 2 0 O-methylation of pppGGGACAAGU represents B50% of that observed with GpppGGGACAAGU (which has an extra methylation target in the GN7 atom; Fig. 2b , red bars). Mutagenesis studies show that all K-D-K-E residues (K 1673 , D 1779 , K 1817 and E 1848 ) are essential for 2 0 O-methylation, while the aspartic acid (D 1779 ) in particular is important for N7-methylation (Fig. 3b) , as was also observed in Flaviviridae MTases 9 . Other residues, many of which belong to the þ domain rather than the core MTase fold, were also found to be essential for the MTase activities (the ' SUB P' residues in Fig. 3b , described below). Structure of the þ domain. The crystal structure of CR-VI þ was solved to 2.2 Å resolution in space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 with two molecules, disulphide-linked at residue C 1877 , in the asymmetric unit, assuming a 'head-to-toe' conformation ( Supplementary  Fig. 1 ). There are no significant differences between the molecules, which have a slightly twisted, bi-lobed shape, composed of two globular domains, the larger corresponding to CR-VI (residues B1,616-1,883) and the smaller to the þ domain (1,884-2,005; Fig. 1b ). Although composed of only B120 residues in Pneumovirinae, the size of the þ domain varies greatly within the Mononegavirales order, reaching B240 residues in Rhabdoviridae. In hMPV, it consists of six a-helices (a þ 1-6). Helix a þ 6 contains the K-K-G motif ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ) and together with a þ 1 leans over the active cleft of CR-VI. Helix a þ 4, and to a lesser extent helices a þ 1, a þ 5 and a þ 6, packs down on l 1650-1666 , the second half of a long loop (residues 1,635-1,666) that swerves around the CR-VI domain ( Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 3 ; 'l' is used throughout the paper to denote loops). The l 1650-1666 region, which contains a small helix (a-a), acts as a fulcrum allowing the þ domain to pivot relative to the CR-VI domain. Helix a þ 3 varies in length, from 4½ turns (in most crystals) to 6 (in Protein Data Bank (PDB) 4UCY), and the loop between a þ 2 and a þ 3 is always disordered ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). In crystals of the monomeric C 1877 A mutant (space group P3 1 Fig. 2 ), using GpppGGGACAAGU substrates that were methylated beforehand at N7 of G or 2 0 O of N1, to specifically monitor 2 0 O or N7-MTase activities, respectively. Mutants are listed against a yellow, green or red background, to indicate that the altered residue belongs to l 1650-1666 , the rest of the CR-VI domain, or the þ domain, respectively. They are also grouped according to whether they change the K-D-K-E tetrad, SAM P, SUB P or NS P. The results highlight the importance of essential SUB P residues (such as the K-K-G lysines K 1991 , K 1992 and K 1995 and l 1650-1666 residues H 1659 and R 1662 ) for both 2 0 O-and N7-methylation. All tetrad residues are crucial for region is further enlarged, as helix a þ 2 completely unfolds and a þ 3 unwinds to 3½ turns. 12 , such as the long N-terminal loop and the position of helix aX. In its active core, however, it better resembles RrmJ-type flavivirus MTases (for example, 3EVF 9 ; Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Most notably, hMPV and flaviviruses share an unusually long (B10 residues), flexible b2 l (that is, the loop immediately following the b2-strand), which forms the SAM-binding pocket ( SAM P) along with loops b1 l and b4 l, shielding it from the solvent (Fig. 1b, c) . In Wesselsbron (flavi-)virus, b2 l is found in closed or open conformations, either packing up against SAM (PDB: 3ELW) or exposing it to the solvent (3EMB) 13 , changes that may assist SAM uptake and/or SAH expulsion. In CR-VI þ , b2 l similarly assumes alternate conformations (Fig. 4c,d) . In the 'closed' form, the ligand's ribose group is hydrogen bonded to D 1725 , and-via a water-to D 1722. Loops b1 l and b4 l also show a degree of flexibility. b1 l residue E 1697 , conserved in paramyxo-and filoviruses, forms a hydrogen bond with the NH 2 group of SAM and is essential for both MTase activities (Fig. 3b) . However, in the absence of SAM, its side chain either moves into the sub-pocket that normally accommodates the NH 2 group, or, more markedly, turns towards the solvent in the direction of b2 l, which in this case assumes the 'open' position ( Fig. 4d) . b4 l forms a side wall of SAM P, and together with aD and b5 also defines a deep, hydrophobic cavity not present in other MTases, termed NS P (or nucleoside-binding pocket). Although a role for NS P has yet to be determined, the pocket binds the adenosine moiety of SAM or ATP, soaked at high (25 mM) concentrations into CR-VI þ crystals, causing b4 l to impinge onto SAM P (Fig. 4c,d; when SAM is used for soaking, one SAM molecule occupies SAM P, and another binds to NS P). GTP was not observed in NS P, but this may reflect a lower soaking concentration (2.5 mM), due to GTP's poor solubility. With the exception of E 1781 , the amino acids lining NS P are poorly conserved beyond the Pneumovirinae, and mutating key NS P residues barely affects the MTase activities (Fig. 3b) . CR-VI, finally, contains a Zn-finger, which is not conserved beyond the Pneumovirinae subfamily and links the small a-d 0 to the rest of the structure (Fig. 1b) . During the preparation of this manuscript, a 3.8-Å structure of VSV L, obtained by electron cryo-microscopy, was published 14 . The CR-VI (or MTase) part of VSV resembles that of hMPV, but apparently lacks a deep NS P pocket (PDB: 5a22, Fig. 5 ). The þ domain (C-terminal domain) is more elaborate in VSV than in hMPV, containing extra regions N and C terminal of helix a þ 6. The helix itself, however, appears well conserved, both in length and in position. Although a K-K-G motif is not present in VSV, it does contain an arginine (R 2038 ) strictly conserved among the Rhabdoviridae, which is structurally equivalent to hMPV's K 1995 , the second lysine of K-K-G motif. The absence of a classical cap-binding site. A common feature of MTases involved in cap methylation is a defined cap-binding pocket that binds G with high affinity, enabling subsequent, lowaffinity interactions with the triphosphate bridge and the first few nucleotides, thus precluding methylation of uncapped RNAs 15, 16 . In CR-VI þ , however, an open, solvent-exposed area is found where this pocket is normally located (Fig. 6a) . Moreover, GpppG-or m GpppG binding was not observed in co-crystallization or soaking experiments, suggesting that CR-VI þ has a weak affinity for G at best and that the cap is not required for substrate recognition. This is consistent with CR-VI þ binding capped and uncapped RNAs with similar strength and being able to 2 0 O-methylate uncapped RNAs (Fig. 2b) . Strong binding would also prevent translocation of G into SUB P for N7-methylation. Although a high-affinity capbinding site is clearly absent from CR-VI þ , the low-affinity nucleoside binding to NS P and the convenient location of this pocket relative to SUB P suggest it could provide space for G without forming strong interactions ( Supplementary Fig. 5) . The absence of a high-affinity cap-binding pocket appears partly compensated for by the narrowing of the groove that in related MTases accommodates the first few nucleotides of the transcripts, by the overhanging þ domain (Figs 4 and 6a) . In  (1) (9) (2) , which runs somewhat differently in VSV. The l 1650-1666 peptide on which the þ domain rests (yellow) also has a homologue in VSV. The Zn-finger, however, is not conserved, and a-helices B and Z are not fragmented. Helix aE, an element of the standard MTase topology (Fig. 1c) , is present in VSV (3), as a result of which NS P may have disappeared. aX is at a different location (4), and is preceded by an extra helix (ax 0 (5)). E 1833 , expected to belong to the K-D-K-E tetrad from sequence alignments, is buried in the structure and does not reach the surface of the catalytic pocket (6) , and the position normally taken by the K-D-K-E glutamate is occupied by T 1831 . The þ domain of VSV is tilted, compared with that of hMPV, and more elaborate. Helices a þ 1, a þ 2, a þ 3, a þ 5 and a þ 6 are conserved, but the a þ 1-a þ 2 loop is replaced by an extra helix (a þ 1 0 (7)). a þ 4 is absent, whereas a þ 5 is enlarged and immediately follows a þ 3 (8). The 2-residue loop connecting a þ 5 and a þ 6 in hMPV is replaced by a 34-residue coil carrying a small three-stranded b-sheet (9) . Helix a þ 6 seems best conserved between the two þ domains, although a K-K-G motif is not present in VSV. However, R 2038 , which is strictly conserved in Rhabdoviridae, takes the place of K 1995 ((10) and alignment below). In VSV, the þ domain is extended beyond a þ 6 with a 65-residue, partly helical, but mainly unstructured polypeptide (in grey (11)). Colour scheme and labelling are as in Fig. 1b. (b) . Alignment of a þ 6-helices from Mononegavirales L proteins. K-K-G motif residues are highlighted in red; the arginine replacing the second lysine of the motif in Filoviridae and Rhabdoviridae is highlighted in magenta. Red letters indicate other (less strictly) conserved residues, except for the G that replaces the first lysine of the K-K-G motif in most Rhabdoviridae (blue). particular, the site adjoining SAM P, which holds the nucleotides undergoing methylation, has become a more elaborate, but narrower and possibly therefore, higher-affinity substrate-binding pocket (termed SUB P as it accommodates the nucleotide undergoing methylation). Consistently, electron density is found in SUB P following soaking or co-crystallization with GTP, whereas in other MTases added GTP predominantly shows up in the capbinding pocket. In particular, helix a þ 6 and the þ domainaffiliated l 1650-1666 help shape SUB P through the side chains of K 1991 and K 1995 (of the K-K-G motif), and of H 1659 and R 1662 , respectively (Fig. 4b) . The marked decrease in MTase activity of mutants altered at these residues (Fig. 3b) illustrates the importance of SUB P in correctly presenting the substrate nucleotides to SAM. Nevertheless, the pocket is too spacious for a single nucleotide, and the electron density in SUB P from a number of soaked crystals suggests that bound GTP often assumes more than one orientation. In structures where GTP could be fitted with confidence, the guanosine moiety predominantly interacts with l 1650-1666 residues H 1659 and R 1662 , and with K 1991 and (K-D-K-E residue) K 1673 , which clamp the guanine (Fig. 4b) . Unusually for cap-MTases, K 1673 is not part of aZ, but instead resides on the small z 0 (3 10 )-helix (Fig. 1b,c) . Whether any of the observed positions of GTP reflects in vivo binding of N 1 (as part of a transcript) is unclear; in MTase-RNA complexes (PDB: 1AV6 (ref. 17) , 4N49 (ref. 16) ), N 1 is situated much closer to the K-D-K-E tetrad (Fig. 6a) . A potential role of CR-VI þ in cap addition. K-K-G residue K 1995 corresponds to the Gp binding lysine in the signature motif of eukaryotic GTases, but here is in a loop instead of an a-helix ARTICLE Mg þ þ , resulted in radioactive protein bands on denaturing SDS gels, the level of radioactivity was low, and was not diminished by acid treatment before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), implying it is not due to phosphoamide bond formation. A second, strong argument against a GTase-based capping mechanism in hMPV (and in favour of a PRNTase-based one) is the fact that in the closely related RSV the cap is formed by Gpp ligation to pRNA 20 . We observed that CR-VI þ also displays NTPase activity, converting GTP into GDP and ATP into ADP (Fig. 7) . GTPase activity, which is required for PRNTase-based capping, was previously reported in Mononegavirales L (ref. 21 ), but as yet could not be linked to a specific domain within the protein. The reaction observed with CR-VI þ , however, is quite slow, possibly because other parts of L, or other co-factors, are needed for full activity. In line with this, we were not able to identify key activesite residues. Using the mutants listed in Fig. 3b , the greatest reductions in GTPase activity were obtained with E 1697 C (corresponding to the flexible residue at the bottom of SAM P; Fig. 4d ) and S 1669 A (part of SUB P, Fig. 4b) to 54 (±20) and 57 ( ± 16) % of the wild-type activity, respectively (n ¼ 3). The deletion of the dipeptide G 1645 K 1646 from the long N-terminal loop resulted in a somewhat more pronounced B70% reduction ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). The NTPase activity was confirmed using crystallized CR-VI þ (Fig. 7 ).
