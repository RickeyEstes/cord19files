The early time series of suspect cases in Mexico City (S) revealed a 1-month period in which daily case counts remained low (never surpassing twenty) followed by a fairly sharp climb and descent ( Figure 1 ). The large pulse, from 78 to 407 cases occurred from 19 April -the last day of the Holy Week period -to 26 April, shortly after initial pronouncements by Mexico's Public Health Secretary. The number of laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (epidemic curve C) was significantly lower than the initial curve of suspected patients (S). Many of the original suspect cases were not infected with influenza A at all (N), and a number were infected by influenza A strains other than pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (A). Based on suspect cases prior to 20 April, we estimate a reproduction number of 1AE51 (95% CI 1AE32-1AE71); for confirmed cases, it is 1AE43 (95% CI 1AE29-1AE57). (Table 2 ) To assess the reliability of estimates made from early epidemic data, we estimated the reproduction number of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 using both early data (Figure 1 , curve A) and later data (Figure 1, other curves) , and compared the results of these two analyses. For each day, we estimate R using the full time series preceding and including that day. The estimates stabilize approximately one week before the end of Holy Week. This value likely represents the intrinsic rate of transmission that would ultimately drive the exponential growth of epidemic (the so-called 'epidemic curve'). The analysis of seasonal influenza incidence in Mexico from 1990 to 2005 suggests that the bulk of seasonal influenza transmission occurs between November and February, declining in March and subsiding in April. 13 Therefore, the apparent peak (Figure 1 , curve A) between 19 April and 10 May likely does not correspond to a seasonal influenza epidemic peak. The surprisingly synchronous changes in non-influenza A cases (curve N) suggests that some of the fluctuations may be caused by extrinsic factors rather than underlying transmission dynamics. Assuming that there were no other respiratory epidemics in the same period, it is plausible that the marked increase in reported cases after 19 April is attributable to a surge in notification spurred by the end of Holy Week and the public health decrees. Assuming that the improved surveillance and public health alerts led to increased case ascertainment of both A and C in a similar manner, one can use the rates of A to 'deflate' the number of confirmed cases with date of symptoms onset later than 17 April to estimate the underlying transmission-driven incidence curve (Figure 2A,B) . This adjusted time series should represent the number of cases identified if the public health measures described had not been implemented. Of note, the peak of the adjusted epidemic curve shifts from 27 April to 23 April, the date the public alert took place and when the social distancing interventions were implemented. This suggests that the public health interventions may have significantly mitigated the epidemic. Adjustment using both the patients without influenza (curve N) and those with non-pandemic influenza A (curve A) has similar impacts ( Figure 2 ). Looking at the time period immediately before 23 April, one may also use either curve A or N to 'inflate' the number of confirmed cases to reflect the hypothetical scenario of early heightened surveillance and public awareness (from the start of the epidemic) ( Figure 3A ,B). This approach increases confirmed cases closer to the 'true' prevalence. Estimates of R based on the four adjusted curves are also given in Table 2 . Unlike the estimates based on the raw data, these estimates remain relatively stable throughout the period of heightened awareness and surveillance. To test the sensitivity of the estimates to underlying assumptions, we repeatedly re-estimated R using random choices of parameters from the ranges given in Table 1 . Figure 4 shows the distribution of R for case series S, C, and both A-and N-deflated C, with each series run with data from before and after the surge (to 19 April and to 25 April, respectively). Each panel summarizes the estimates of R using 388 080 combinations of parameter values. The parameter with greatest impact on estimated reproduction number over the range assessed is the latency period (data not shown). The results suggest that the estimates of R for the second segment of the adjusted time series (after public health alerts) are in agreement with the first segments of both time series S and C. Figure 4 also illustrates that if the time series representing confirmed cases is not adjusted for extrinsic factors, a wider confidence interval will be achieved.
