DC-SIGN uptakes F. hepatica glycoconjugates and mediates the enhanced production of TLR-induced IL-10 and IL-27p28 by mo-DCs. To determine whether F. hepatica glycans modulate DC-mediated immune responses, we first evaluated whether a total preparation of parasite components (FhTE) can modulate the production of cytokines induced after a maturation stimulus by DCs. To this end, immature mo-DCs were cultured in the presence or absence of Pam3CSK4 or LPS and FhTE, and the production of different cytokines were evaluated in the culture medium. Although FhTE alone did not induce the expression of cytokines by mo-DCs, when cultured together with a maturation stimulus, it enhanced the production of IL-10 and IL-27p28 by mo-DCs ( Fig. 1A and B) . Interestingly, this enhanced production of IL-10 was abrogated when FhTE glycans were oxidized with meta-periodate (FhmPox), a common method used to evaluate the biological activity of glycans (Fig. 1C) 32 . These results indicate that F. hepatica glycoconjugates mediate the enhanced production of TLR-induced IL-10 and IL-27p28 by mo-DCs. Next, we investigated whether parasite components are taken up by mo-DCs. To this end we studied the intracellular routing of FhTE components by imaging flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2A , the localization of labeled-FhTE molecules was intracellular and they co-localized at 15 minute-incubation period with early endosomal antigen (EEA-1) and the lysosomal marker LAMP-1. Uptake of labeled-FhTE to moDCs was also confirmed by flow cytometry and inhibited upon incubation with EGTA ( Fig. 2B) , suggesting the participation of a CLR in this process. Furthermore, FhTE-uptake to mo-DCs was inhibited with MR-and DC-SIGN-specific antibodies, while it was not modified when using anti-DCIR and anti-MGL antibodies (Fig. 2B) . Finally, we evaluated the capacity of MR and DC-SIGN to recognize coated-FhTE using MR-and DC-SIGN-Fc constructions, confirming their participation in the recognition of glycans present in FhTE, which was inhibited with the chelating agent EGTA (Fig. 2C) . Given the capacity of MR and DC-SIGN to recognize and internalize FhTE we investigated whether these receptors mediated the enhanced production of TLR-induced IL-10 and IL27-p28 by mo-DCs stimulated with FhTE. Mo-DCs were incubated with FhTE and LPS in presence of MR-, DC-SIGN-, DCIR-and MGL-specific blocking antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3 , only the anti-DC-SIGN antibody was capable of restoring IL-10 levels Scientific RepoRts | 7:46748 | DOI: 10.1038/srep46748 produced by LPS-stimulated mo-DCs. In addition, the DC-SIGN blocking antibody also restored the levels of IL-27p28 ( Fig. 3B) suggesting that DC-SIGN and not MR mediates the modulation triggered by FhTE together with a TLR ligand.
