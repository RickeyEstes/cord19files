Optimization of SpyCatcher. The current SpyTag/SpyCatcher system consists of a 13 aa SpyTag and a 138 aa SpyCatcher. To further simplify this system for engineering purposes and to minimize its immunogenicity, we tried to truncate the SpyCatcher protein while maintaining its conjugation activity. A structural analysis found that aa 53-118 are probably essential for the conjugation activity. An immunogenicity analysis revealed four major immune epitopes at the N-terminus (aa 32-50, aa 57-66) and C-terminus (aa 104-112, aa 121-138) ( Figure S1 ). Considering these together, we performed several truncations, as shown in Figure 1a . The truncation with deletion at the N-terminus (24-47 aa) was named SpyCatcherDN, and the truncation with deletions at both the N-terminus and the C-terminus (24-47 and 121-138 aa) was named SpyCatcherDNC. The truncated SpyCatcher proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography ( Figure 1b) . The full-length and truncated SpyCatcher proteins were then used to immunize C57BL/6 mice. Fourteen days later, antibody levels in the sera were determined by ELISA. As shown in Figure 1c , the antibody levels induced by SpyCatcherDN and SpyCatcherDNC were significantly lower than those induced by full-length SpyCatcher. No significant difference was found between SpyCatcherDN and SpyCatcherDNC. Next, we further tested the efficiency of the binding of the truncated SpyCatcher proteins to the SpyTag fusion protein, aDEC205-SpyTag, which was made by genetic fusion of SpyTag with a single-chain antibody against murine DEC205 (aDEC205) at its C-terminus. As shown in Figures 1d and  1e , there was no significant difference in binding efficiency between SpyCatcherDN and full-length SpyCatcher, consistent with the results of a recent study 24 . However, the binding efficiency of SpyCatcherDNC was obviously lower than that of full-length SpyCatcher. Therefore, SpyCatcherDN was chosen for further studies. Assembly of synthetic DEC205-targeted vaccine using optimized SpyTag/SpyCatcher system. A full vaccine usually consists of at least an immunoregulatory functional unit in addition to the antigen. The modified single-chain antibody aDEC205-SpyTag was used as a functional unit in the present study. The OVA 8 -TBEV ED3 DNA sequence, which encodes model antigens including both a CD8 Tcell epitope (ovalbumin 257-264 ) and a B-cell epitope (TBEV ED3), was genetically fused to the C-terminus of SpyCatcherDN (Sc-OVA 8 -ED3). Conjugation of aDEC205-SpyTag and Sc-OVA 8 -ED3 would result in a fully functional vaccine ( Figure 2a ). aDEC205-SpyTag was expressed in FreeStyle TM 293-F cells and purified by Protein A chromatography ( Figure 2b , Lane 1). The Sc-OVA 8 -ED3 fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography ( Figure 2b , Lane 2). The covalent binding reaction was tested under different conditions and with different molar ratios. A 151.5 molar ratio of aDEC205-SpyTag:Sc-OVA 8 -ED3 at 4uC for 2 h was found to give rise to an optimal binding efficiency for the proteins. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that more than 90% of the input aDEC205-SpyTag was conjugated ( Figure 2b , Lane 3). The synthetic DEC205-targeted vaccine (aDEC205-Sc-OVA 8 -ED3) was then purified by Protein A chromatography, with a purity above 90% (Figure 2b , Lane 4). Synthetic aDEC205-Sc-OVA 8 -ED3 vaccine can bind to DEC205 1 DCs both in vitro and in vivo. To test the DC-targeting ability of the synthetic aDEC205-Sc-OVA 8 -ED3 fusion protein, splenocytes isolated from naïve WT C57BL/6 mice were incubated with the fusion protein or an isotype-control protein. After staining with a fluorescent secondary antibody, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 3a , conventional DCs were gated as MHC class II high and CD11c high cells, and the CD8a 1 DC and CD8a 2 DC subsets were then each further gated and analyzed. As shown in Figure 3b (top panel), the aDEC205 fusion protein preferentially bound to CD8a 1 DCs, rather than to CD8a 2 DCs or other immune cells (data not shown), which is consistent with the and assembly. The cDNA encoding the single chain of aDEC205 was genetically fused to SpyTag at the C-terminus, and the antigen containing the OT1 epitope and TBEV ED3 was fused to the C-terminus of SpyCatcherDN. Once mixed, an amide bond efficiently forms between SpyTag and SpyCatcher. (b) Synthetic vaccine production and purification. Purified aDEC205-SpyTag was mixed with SpyCatcherDN-OVA 8 -TBEV ED3 at a molar ratio of 151.5 at 4uC for 2 h. The assembled aDEC205-Sc-OVA 8 -ED3 adduct was purified by Protein A chromatography. Both the efficiency of the reaction and the purified adduct can be analyzed by SDS-PAGE. specific expression of DEC205 on the former subset of DCs. To further test its targeting ability in vivo, naïve WT mice were immunized with the aDEC205 fusion protein, together with CpG/ Poly I:C. Next, 24 h after immunization, draining lymph nodes (DLNs) were isolated and digested to form single-cell suspensions. aDEC205 fusion protein-bound cells were visualized with fluorescent secondary antibody staining followed by flow cytometry. Preferential targeting to CD8a 1 DCs was confirmed (Figure 3b , bottom panel). Thus, the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system allows assembly of SpyCatcher fusion proteins with aDEC205-SpyTag, without influencing its DC-targeting ability. Synthetic aDEC205-Sc-OVA 8 -ED3 vaccine generates enhanced cytotoxic T-cell response. We next tested whether the synthetic vaccine could generate an efficient cytotoxic T-cell response. This was measured by IFNc intracellular staining and in vivo specific killing assays. Naïve WT C57BL/6 mice were immunized twice with the aDEC205-Sc-OVA 8 -ED3 fusion protein or the Sc-OVA 8 -ED3 protein at a 7-day interval. CpG1826/Poly I:C was used as adjuvant. For the IFNc intracellular staining assay, 5 days after the last injection, splenocytes were isolated from the immunized mice and stimulated with 5 mg/ml OT1 peptide in a U-bottom 96-well plate for 6 h. The IFNc-producing CD8 T cells were then stained and analyzed by flow cytometry. The splenocytes from the aDEC205-Sc-OVA 8 -ED3-vaccinated mice showed a significantly higher percentage of IFNc-producing CD8 T cells compared with the splenocytes from Sc-OVA 8 -ED3-immunized mice (Figures 4a  and 4b ). For the in vivo specific killing assay, 4 days after the secondary injection, target cells (an equal mixture of OVA 8 peptide-loaded, CFSE-high, labeled naïve splenocytes and non-loaded, CFSE-low, labeled naïve splenocytes) were transferred to the immunized mice. Next, 20 h later, the proportion of CFSE-labeled cells in the spleen was analyzed. A significantly higher specific killing rate was found in mice immunized with the aDEC205-Sc-OVA 8 -ED3 vaccine Synthetic aDEC205-Sc-OVA 8 -ED3 vaccine induces better antigenspecific antibody response. It has been shown that targeting antigens to DEC205 can induce strong antibody responses in the presence of adjuvants. We next tested whether synthetic aDEC205-Sc-OVA 8 -ED3 can elicit a better antibody response against the antigen TBEV ED3. Naïve WT C57BL/6 mice were immunized twice with 300 pmol aDEC205-Sc-OVA 8 -ED3 fusion protein or Sc-OVA 8 -ED3 protein, together with CpG1826/Poly I:C as an adjuvant, at a 14-day interval. Seven days after the last vaccination, the mice were bled, and anti-TBEV ED3 antibody was measured by ELISA. Compared with the Sc-OVA 8 -ED3 control vaccine, aDEC205-Sc-OVA 8 -ED3 elicited a significantly increased antibody response against TBEV ED3 ( Figure 5) . Thus, the synthetic DCtargeting vaccine is efficient in inducing both T-and B-cell responses.
