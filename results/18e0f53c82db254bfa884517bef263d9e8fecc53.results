Cytotoxicity of TSL-1 on the 3 lung cancer cell lines. NSCLC cells were treated with or without TSL-1 for different time points; IC 50 values of TSL-1 treated tumor cells for 48 h were, 0.20 mg/mL for H441 cells, 0.25 mg/mL for H520 cells, and 0.12 mg/mL for H661 cells, respectively. Compared with the 24 h time point, 48 h treatment showed better inhibitory effect in all 3 lung cancer cell lines. Among the 3 cell lines, H661treated cells displayed a lower IC 50 value (Fig 1, A and  B) . These experiments showed that TSL-1 could induce high cytotoxicity against NSCLC cells. Effects of TSL-1 on cell-cycle distribution and cell-cyclerelated proteins. To examine the underlying mechanism for TSL-1-mediated cell proliferation inhibition, cellcycle distribution was evaluated using flow cytometric analysis. TSL-1-treated NSCLC cells showed a significant increase in the G1-phase compared with the control group (Fig 2) . Next, we analyzed the effect of TSL-1 on cell-cycle proteins; the result showed that TSL-1 could inhibit cyclin D1 and CDK4 protein levels in all 3 NSCLCs, thereby upregulating the p27 expression level. The decrease in both cyclin D1 and CDK4 coupled with an increase in p27 was more significant in H661 cells when compared with the other 2 cell lines (Fig 3) . Thus, TSL-1 treatment induced G1 cell-cycle arrest was associated with the result of cell-cycle-related proteins. Apoptotic effect of TSL-1 on the 3 cancer cell lines. Four separate assays were applied to investigate the induction of apoptosis in NSCLC by TSL-1 treatment (Fig 4) . The cells were treated for 48 h with 0.5 mg/mL TSL-1 and were analyzed for apoptosis by the TUNEL, cell morphology, subG1 peak accumulation, the cleavage of PARP, and PI-Annexin-V double staining. Cell morphology was determined to analyze the effect of treatment in inducing apoptosis in both untreated and TSL-1-treated NSCLC; apoptotic bodies were observed and some substances in the cytosol were released to the media with a time-dependent effect (Fig 4, A) . TSL-1 treatment induced apoptosis as shown by the TUNEL assay (Fig 4, B) . These apoptotic features observed in the TSL-1 treated cells include brown-stained fragmented nuclei, irregular-shaped cells, and irregular cytoplasmic membranes. In addition, the percentage of Annexin V-positive cells, which is indicative of early apoptosis, increased from 4.2% in the control to 12.9% in TSL-1-treated H441 cells; similarly, an increase of apoptosis from 0.2% in the H520 and H661 control cells to 14.9% to 23.2% of TSL-1-treated cells was observed. More-over, TSL-1 treatment increased the percentage of cells positive for both Annexin V and propidium iodide (hallmarks of late apoptosis) from 0.2% in the controls to 0.2%, 3.2%, and 8.3% in H441, H520, and H661 cells, respectively (Fig 4, C) . A Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the activation of PARP downstream of the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. From (Fig 4, D) . we observed an increase in 85-kDa cleavage product with respect to TSL-1 concentration. This result was consistent with all the 3 cell lines used. Taken together, we conclude that TSL-1 induces the apoptosis on NSCLC cells. Effects of TSL-1 on Bcl-2 family proteins. It is well known that Bcl-2 family members can induce or inhibit apoptosis. Western blot analysis showed that with increase in TSL-1 concentration decreased Bcl-2 proteins expression in all the 3 cell lines. At the same time TSL-1 treated H441, H520 and H661 cell lines showed increased Bax protein levels when compared with their respective control (Fig. 5) . These results indicate that Bcl-2 protein family might involve in TSL-1 mediated apoptosis. TSL-1 inhibits tumor growth in nude mice. To understand the effect of TSL-1 on NSCLC cells, equal number of H441, H520 and H661 cells were injected on the right flank of nude mice, tumor was (visualized as small nodules at the sites of injection) appeared after 14 days of H441 cells injection; but the other 2 cell lines failed to induce tumor formation. Compared with the control (5.87 6 1.13 310 3 mm 3 ), TSL-1 treatment (intraperitonial) for 35 days showed reduction in tumor size (0.38 6 0.06 3 10 3 mm 3 ). Similar result was found when low (2.03 6 0.12 3 10 3 mm 3 ) and high dose (1.24 6 0.15 3 10 3 mm 3 ) of TSL-1 was administrated via p.o (Fig. 6A) . These results revealed that TSL-1 caused tumor shrinkage in a dose dependent manner. To test the preventive effects of TSL-1 on tumor formation, mice were pretreated with vehicle (Control) or TSL-1 for 30 days and then inoculated with H441 cells. These groups were further treated using distilled water or TSL-1 for an additional 42 days and were observed for tumor shrinkage. Compared with the control [distilled water (Control)] tumor volume (3.13 6 0.32 3 10 3 mm 3 ), pretreatment with TSL-1 and posttreatment with distilled water showed reduction in tumor volume by (0.94 6 0.21 3 10 3 mm 3 ), where as in both pre and post treated mice with TSL-1 showed reduction in the tumor size to (0.32 6 0.13 3 10 3 mm 3 ) (Fig. 5 B) . No hepatic, kidney and renal toxicity were observed in TSL-1 administrated mice (Po and IP) (data not shown).
