A summary of the COVID-19 confirmed cases by age group and symptom status onboard the Princess Cruises Ship is illustrated in Table 2 . A total of 531 people had tested positive for the illness as of February 5, 2020. Out of 531 cases, three cases were aged 0e19 years, 117 were aged 20e58 years and 411 were aged 60 years and older. Finally, the crude asymptomatic ratio, a simple proportion of asymptomatic infections among all the infections was estimated as follows: 66.7% (95% Confidence Interval (95%CI): 9.4%, 99.1%) for aged 0e19 years, 30.8% (95%CI: 22.6%, 40.0%) for aged 20e58 years and 52.8% (95%CI: 47.9%, 57.5%) for aged 60 years and older (95%CI is based on binomial distribution). The observed and estimated daily number of cases among passengers and crew members from day 1 to day 29 (January 20, 2020eFebruary 17, 2020) are shown in Fig. 1 . The total number of cases for all and by type (passengers and crew members) were estimated at 187.0 (95%CrI: 163.8, 212.3), 127.1 (95%CrI: 107.8, 148.9) and 59.6 (95%CrI: 47.3, 74.0), respectively. For comparison, the number of reported cases for all and by type were 197, 149 and 48 respectively. The corresponding percentage coverage of the 95%CrI of estimated data for observed data, the number of days where the model 95% CrI overlapped with the observed data, is 54% (15/28) for all, and 50% (14/28) and 43% (12/28) for passenger and crew, respectively. The time-dependent reproduction number for all and by type are presented in Fig. 2 . For all, R t rapidly increased at around day 12 (January 31, 2020) and reached its maximum with the value of 11.2 (95%CrI: 7.5, 16.2) at day 19 (February 7, 2020). R t for passengers presented a similar pattern with the value of 12.1 (95%CrI: 8.2, 17.2) at day 19 (February 7, 2020), while R t for crew members only shows slight fluctuations with the largest value reaching 1.56 (95%CrI: 0.07, 7.55) at day 23 (February 11, 2020). Distributions of median R t for entire study period for overall, for type and by each transmission type are shown in Fig. 3 . Median R t are 5.8 (95%CrI: 0.6e11.0), 6.1 (95%CrI: 0.5, 11.8), 0.9 (95%CrI: 0.3, 1.5) for overall and by type (passenger, crew). Examining inter-type and within-type transmission, R t estimates greatly vary across transmission types: 5.6 (95%CrI: 0.3, 10.9) for passenger to passenger, 0.6 (95%CrI: 0.1, 1.1) for passenger to crew, 0.5 (95%CrI: 0.2, 0.8) for crew to passenger, 0.5 (95%CrI: 0.3, 0.8) for crew to crew. Although vaccines are still in early development stages as of February 2020, based on our findings, the corresponding target vaccination coverage to contain the outbreak in this confined setting were estimated at 91% and 94% from the maximum value of the 50 percentile distribution and the 97.5 percentile distribution, respectively. Our latest estimate of the overall R t is 0.35 (95%CrI: 0.02, 2.19), with only 2% of R t estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0. Passenger and crew also have total (within-type and inter-type) R t values largely below the epidemic threshold, with only small percentages at 0% and 9% above the epidemic threshold, respectively (Table 3) .
