Participants and setting. In 2015, a total of 684 (of 738) secondary school students participated in the Viruskenner education module. Two of the participating schools in the Netherlands, dropped out (54 of 260 Dutch students, representing 20.7% of them) because of noncompletion of the module and evaluation program. One school dropped out because the teacher got sick after the kick-off and the other school could not attend the final day because it clashed with another school activity that day (Figure 2 ). In Suriname, 158 students participated and there was no dropout. This was also the case in Indonesia, where all 320 students completed the education module. Response rates for the Netherlands were 95.6% of participants for the pretest and 70.9% for the posttest. In Suriname, these percentages were 90.5 and 96.8%, respectively, and for Indonesia 97.2 and 99.1%, respectively. The control group had a response rate of 100% for the pretest and 73.4% for the posttest. Table 2 presents the pre-and posttest characteristics of the module participants from all three countries and the control group. In all groups, except the Surinamese group, the age category in the posttest was significantly higher than in the pretest. However, for gender and education, the characteristics did not show any significant differences between the pre-and posttest per country. In Indonesia, the preference for science was significantly higher in the posttest than in the pretest. On average, in the Netherlands, most of the participating students were male, whereas in Indonesia, they were mostly female. Generally speaking, in the Netherlands, the students from both the control group and the intervention group were significantly younger than average. The pretest showed that on average more students attended preuniversity education in the Netherlands, Suriname, and in the control group. In Indonesia, all students attended advanced general secondary education. In the posttest, the percentage of preuniversity education students in the Dutch intervention group rose to 65.3%. In the control group, this percentage decreased to 64.1%. In both the pre-and posttest, the amount of participants from the intervention group in the Netherlands and Suriname that chose scientific profiles was not significantly different from the average. The control group consisted of less students with scientific profiles than average and Indonesia had more students with science-related profiles. Correlations between knowledge score and attitude and behavior. Pearson's coefficients showed a positive and significant correlation between the knowledge scores and all four components regarding attitude and behavior (Table 3) . Knowledge was most strongly correlated with attitude and awareness (r = 0.20). Students who scored higher on attitude and awareness also scored higher on behavior regarding risk of infection (r = 0.47) and behavior regarding life sciences (r = 0.51). Knowledge. During the project, the answer to one of the 32 knowledge questions changed, due to the MERS epidemic in South Korea. Because of the confusion surrounding this question, we decided to exclude it from the analysis. Analyses per country showed differences in achieved knowledge ( Figure 3) , with mean knowledge increasing in all three participating countries. For Suriname and the Netherlands, this increase was significant (P < 0.001). The overall effect size (Cohen's d) for all intervention groups was 0.43, which represents a medium effect. At 0.77, the effect size for Suriname was the highest. The effect size for the Netherlands was 0.52, which also represents a large The given percentages have been calculated from the number of students for which data is available for that variable. The percentages have been rounded off to one decimal place. Pearson chisquare was used to calculate differences per country and the control group between pre-and post-test. T = 0 represents the pre-test and T = 1 represents the post-test after 10 weeks. Education represents the level of education, in which HAVO stands for advanced general secondary education and VWO stands for pre-university education level. Science represents the interest of the students, measured by their (preferred) choice of curriculum. FIGURE 3. The impact of the Viruskenner on students' knowledge. The knowledge of the participating and nonparticipating students per country before and after the intervention is represented by the mean percentage of the true/false questions in the questionnaire that were answered correctly. The blue line represents the Netherlands, without the control group. The orange line represents all intervention groups, so from the Netherlands, Suriname, and Indonesia. * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001. This figure appears in color at www.ajtmh.org. The correlation coefficients shown have been calculated from all values in the intervention groups at both the pre-and posttest. * P < 0.05 ** P < 0.01 *** P < 0.001. effect. 36 For example, in the Netherlands, the percentage of correct answers on the statement "Dengue is a virus infection that is transmitted by a tiger mosquito" raised from 71% correct in the pretest to 90% correct in the posttest (the correct answer is true). The score for "If someone is infected with HIV this person has AIDS" raised from 76% to 83% (the correct answer is false because acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is a syndrome in which the immune system is suppressed and opportunistic infections can cause illness, which can be prevented in HIV infected individuals by taking antiretrovirals).Although in some other questions the percentage of correct answers differs only one percentage point between the pre-and posttest. The mean percentage of correct answers on a few questions declined. The mean total knowledge in the control group decreased significantly (P = 0.032). In the multiple regression analyses, the variable participation (control group or intervention group) contributed significantly (P < 0.001; B = 0.078) to the knowledge outcome. The variable time point (pre-or posttest), however, did not. Most information about the impact of the module on knowledge is given by the interaction between participation and time point, which was significant (P < 0.001; B = 0.053). Other variables that contributed significantly to knowledge were gender, age > 16 years, and the school ( Table 4 ). The mean tolerance of all variables in the regression analyses is 0.3. Although this suggests that there is some multicollinearity between predictors, this value is no reason for concern. 30 The data from the knowledge quiz showed that the Netherlands had a mean score of 70.7%, with Suriname scoring 59.6%. Stigma and fear. The first question regarding stigma and fear was "I don't want to mix with people who have HIV" and the second one was "I am afraid that I will get infected by Ebola." Generally speaking, the module participants' answers did not change significantly. However, the results per country showed a significant decrease in Suriname on both questions (P = 0.009; effect size [ES] = 0.31 and P = 0.001; ES = 0.42, respectively); other countries showed no significant differences in separate analyses, neither did the control group. Figure 4 shows the changes in the four components regarding attitude and behavior. In the intervention group (all countries combined), attitude and awareness increased significantly (P = 0.028; ES = 0.12) and so did attitude and risk infection (P < 0.001; ES = 0.30). Behavior and risk infection increased, but with the chosen P value of 0.05, the increase was on the borderline of significance (P = 0.062; ES = 0.11). Behavior and life sciences also increased with borderline significance (P = 0.060; ES = 0.10). In the control group, attitude and awareness and behavior and risk infection decreased significantly (P < 0.001; ES = 0.67 and P < 0.001; ES = 0.51, respectively). Attitude and risk infection and behavior and life sciences both showed a slight, but nonsignificant increase.
