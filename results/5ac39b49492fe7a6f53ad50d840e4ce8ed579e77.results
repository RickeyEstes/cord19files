The general organization of the two genomic regions, the natural killer complex (NKC) and the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC), containing genes and gene families encoding the NK cell receptors annotated based on the dromedary genome assembly CamDro2, was established and is represented in Figure 1 . The phylogenetic trees of the genes analyzed are shown in Figures 2  and 3 for NKC and LRC genes, respectively. A summary of the allelic variants of the predicted proteins for the genes genotyped in dromedaries and Bactrian camels is given in
