The study sample consisted of 693 patients with symptomatic, uncomplicated bone metastases. In total, 965 courses of palliative radiotherapy were prescribed. Table 1 presents the clinic activity, demographic, disease and treatmentrelated characteristics of the patients for each year under study. Clinic activity refers to the number of patients who were prescribed radiotherapy for bone metastases as well as the number of courses of radiotherapy for bone metastases prescribed for each year under study. After randomly selecting one course of radiotherapy per patient, 451 (65.08%) and 242 (34.92%) patients were prescribed single and multiple fractions of radiation, respectively. Singlefraction treatments were predominantly prescribed as 8 Gy (92%), with doses ranging from 4 to 10 Gy. Ninety per cent of multiple-fraction treatments were prescribed as 20 Gy/five fractions and 6% were 30 Gy/10 fractions (range 12 Gy/two fractions to 30 Gy/10 fractions). The proportions of single fractions used over time are presented in Fig. 1 . The administration of single treatments generally increased across time, from 51% in 1999, to 70% in 2001, to 71% in 2004 and 66% in 2005 (P ! 0.0001). Overall, 57% of the sample were men, with a mean age of 67.4 years. The three most common primary cancer sites were lung, prostate and breast (respectively), and the median KPS score was 60, indicating that most patients required occasional assistance from others, but were able to care for most needs [38] . About 87% of radiotherapy episodes were to the spine, pelvis, or limbs. The median travel distance to the clinic was 25.1 km and most patients (66.1%) resided 'near' the cancer centre (at a distance of less than 40 km). Tests for heterogeneity found significant differences in the proportion of men and women who were prescribed radiotherapy (P ¼ 0.037) across time, with the proportion of men increasing. The distribution of primary cancer sites also changed (P ¼ 0.004) across time, with an increasing proportion of both lung and prostate cancers and a decreasing frequency of breast cancer and other cancer types. Furthermore, patients prescribed radiotherapy in 1999 and 2001 had a poorer performance status (median of 60) than patients seen in 2004 and 2005 (median of 70) (P ! 0.0001, Table 1 ). Table 2 presents the univariate relationship between individual clinical and demographic variables and singlefraction radiotherapy. As shown, patients treated with single-fraction radiotherapy were significantly older (mean age 68.26 years) than patients treated with multiple fractions (mean age 65.64 years). For each increasing year of age, patients had 1.02 times greater the odds of receiving single-fraction radiation. Patients with prostate cancer had 1.623 times the odds of receiving single-fraction radiation, compared with patients with lung cancer. There were no significant differences in the use of single or multiple fractions for patients with breast or other types of cancer, with odds ratios of 0.767 and 0.981, respectively ( Table 2) . Patients who had a higher KPS had lower odds of receiving single-fraction radiation than patients with a poorer performance status (odds ratio ¼ 0.984, 95% confidence interval 0.972e0.996). Also, patients who lived 'very distant' from the treatment centre had 1.951 times the odds (95% confidence interval 1.050e3.864) of receiving a single fraction of radiotherapy compared with patients who lived 'near' the cancer centre. Overall, there were significant differences in the use of single-fraction radiotherapy by bony sites of metastases (P ! 0.0001); single fractions were used more frequently to irradiate the limbs, hips, pelvis and ribs compared with treatments to the spine ( Table 2 ). There were significant differences in the prescription of single-or multiple-fraction radiation according to the year of certification of the radiation oncologists. Oncologists certified in the 1970s and 1980s were more likely to prescribe single-fraction radiation than those certified in the 2000s (odds ratio ¼ 4.07 and 2.50, respectively). However, there was no difference in the prescription patterns of oncologists certified in the 1990s compared with their year 2000s counterparts. Gender was not found to be associated with single-fraction radiation ( Table 2 ). The results of the multivariable logistic regression analyses are also presented in Table 2 . After adjusting for gender, age, primary cancer site, KPS, distance travelled (ordinal measurement), site of radiotherapy, and year of certification of radiation oncologist, there was a significantly increased likelihood of single-fraction radiation being prescribed after 1999. The odds of using singlefraction radiation were about 1.5 times greater overall than in 1999 ( Table 2 ). The increased use of single-fraction radiation was observed in 2002, 2004 and 2005. KPS, the site of radiation, and the year of certification of the oncologist were also significantly associated with the dosefractionation regimen. Treatments to the pelvis had 5.6 times the odds of receiving single-fraction radiation, whereas treatments to the ribs, scapula, sternum and clavicle had about 3.2 times the odds of receiving singlefraction radiation compared with treatments to the spine. Also, treatments to the limbs, hips and shoulders had 1.9 times the odds of receiving single-fraction radiation compared with treatments to the spine. After controlling for age, the primary cancer site overall was not found to be related to single-fraction radiation, although prostate cancer patients had a greater likelihood (odds ratio ¼ 2.089) of being prescribed single-fraction radiation compared with other cancer sites. Oncologists trained in earlier years (i.e. 1970s and 1980s) had significantly higher odds of prescribing single-fraction radiation than oncologists trained later. There was no collinearity present in the multivariable model, with variance inflation factors ranging from 1.00853 to 1.12102. The results of the HosmereLemeshow goodness-of-fit test did not indicate any evidence of gross lack of fit of the model (P ¼ 0.1489).
