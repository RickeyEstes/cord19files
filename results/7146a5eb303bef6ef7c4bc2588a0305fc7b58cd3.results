3A tagged with GFP(S11) assembles with GFP(S1-10) to yield GFP fluorescence. In order to visualize the enterovirus ROs in living cells, one of the nonstructural proteins that is anchored in the membranes of the ROs should be labeled with a fluorescent tag. A transposon-based insertion mutagenesis study revealed that the N-terminal region of poliovirus 3A tolerates small insertions (32, 37) . Specifically, viable insertions were found after residues 2, 6, 9, 10, and 11. Since the 3A proteins of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and poliovirus are highly homologous, these positions were good candidates for introduction of a small tag in CVB3 3A. We chose to insert GFP(S11) after amino acid 2 in CVB3 3A without using any linker residues, yielding 3A(S11aa2) (Fig. 1A) . Before introducing GFP(S11) into the viral genome, we first tested whether inserting the tag into 3A at this position would generate GFP fluorescence upon coexpression with GFP(S1-10). Staining with an anti-3A antibody demonstrated that the expression pattern of 3A(S11aa2) resembled that of untagged 3A [i.e., lacking GFP(S11)] in HeLa cells (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material) and in BGM (buffalo green monkey) cells (data not shown), indicating that the GFP(S11) tag does not alter the localization of 3A. Coexpression of GFP(S1-10) with 3A(S11aa2), but not with untagged 3A, resulted in a GFP signal that greatly overlapped with the 3A pattern generated with the anti-3A antibody (see Fig. S1B , HeLa cells not shown). Furthermore, 3A(S11aa2) was not GFP fluorescent in the absence of GFP(S1-10) (see Fig. S1A ). Thus, GFP(S1-10) can assemble with 3A(S11aa2) to yield GFP fluorescence at the sites where 3A is localized in the cell. Introduction of GFP(S11) into 3A does not impair its known functions. Next, we investigated whether 3A(S11aa2) is able to perform the same functions as untagged 3A. Enteroviruses hijack the Golgi-resident PI4KB (phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III␤) via their 3A protein to ROs to enrich these membranes in PI4P (phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate), an essential lipid for viral RNA replication (22) . In line with previous observations (22, 38, 39) , PI4KB was present in a faint Golgi-like pattern in untransfected HeLa cells, whereas in 3A-transfected cells, an intense PI4KB signal was detected at membranes containing untagged 3A (Fig. 1B) . Likewise, in cells coexpressing 3A(S11aa2) and GFP(S1-10), PI4KB recruitment was observed to the membranes containing fluorescent 3A (Fig. 1B) . The enterovirus 3A protein interacts directly with GBF1, an essential host factor for enterovirus replication (27, 30) . Under normal conditions, GBF1 is an activator of the small GTPase Arf1, which in turn recruits the COP-I complex to Golgi membranes upon activation (40) . The COP-I coat initiates budding of transport vesicles that ferry cargo at the ER-Golgi interface and in the Golgi apparatus (41) . Expression of 3A in isolation leads to the perturbation of ER-to-Golgi transport (30, (42) (43) (44) , as demonstrated by the dissociation of COP-I from Golgi membranes in BGM cells (44) , presumably as a result of the interaction of 3A with GBF1 (30, 44) . Similar to untagged 3A, 3A(S11aa2) visualized by coexpression of GFP(S1-10) clearly caused COP-I dissociation (Fig. 1C ). In addition to the interaction with GBF1, enterovirus 3A also directly binds to the host factor ACBD3 (acyl coenzyme A [acyl-CoA]-binding protein domain 3), although with the plasmid encoding GFP(S1-10) [i.e., pGFP(S1-10)] and either p3A-myc or p3A(S11aa2)-myc. The next day, cells were fixed and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. The 3A protein was visualized with an antibody staining for p3A-myc (a primary anti-3A [␣-3A] antibody and a secondary Alexa Fluor 488-labeled antibody), while p3A(S11aa2) was visualized by the GFP fluorescence as a result of assembly with GFP(S1-10). PI4KB (A) and COP-I (B) were detected with immunofluorescence using a secondary Alexa Fluor 594-labeled antibody. Untransfected cells are indicated with a white asterisk. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Wide-field images were acquired with an Olympus BX60 fluorescence microscope. Bars, 10 m. the role of this protein in enterovirus replication is still enigmatic (38, 39, (45) (46) (47) . We tested whether 3A(S11aa2) could still interact with GBF1 and ACBD3 in a mammalian two-hybrid system (38, 39) . Similar to untagged 3A, 3A(S11aa2) interacted with GBF1 and ACBD3, even in the presence of overexpressed GFP(S1-10) (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Collectively, our results demonstrate that introduction of GFP(S11) in CVB3 3A after the second residue does not affect the ability of 3A to interact with previously identified host factors or to perform its known functions, which prompted us to introduce GFP(S11) into the viral genome of CVB3. Tagging 3A with GFP(S11) results in a replication-competent CVB3 that generates fluorescent replication organelles. Introduction of the GFP(S11) tag into the infectious clone of CVB3 yielded viable virus, i.e., CVB3-3A(S11aa2). Sequence analysis of the viral genome confirmed that the tag was retained in the 3A protein without mutations. In addition, we generated a replication-competent CVB3 with the short affinity tag StrepII of 10 residues in 3A [i.e., CVB3-3A(StrepIIaa2)]. Insertion of the StrepII tag also did not affect the known functions of 3A (data not shown), and the tag was retained in 3A for five passages (data not shown), further demonstrating that residue 2 is an amenable site for introduction of a small tag. Subsequently, we tested whether the GFP(S11) tag in 3A affects the replication kinetics of the virus. Since cells that have been transfected with plasmid DNA are less susceptible to picornavirus infection (48), we generated single-cell clones of HeLa and BGM cells that stably express GFP(S1-10). Next, we compared the growth kinetics of CVB3-3A(S11aa2) to wild-type (wt) CVB3 in the presence and absence of GFP(S1-10). Samples were subjected to endpoint titration to determine the production of infectious virus or quantitative PCR to measure viral RNA levels. Replication of wt CVB3 in BGM cells and BGM(GFPS1-10) cells was nearly identical, showing that the presence of GFP(S1-10) did not alter CVB3 replication kinetics ( Fig. 2A and B) . The replication kinetics of tagged CVB3 in BGM(GFPS1-10) cells also resembled that of BGM cells,
