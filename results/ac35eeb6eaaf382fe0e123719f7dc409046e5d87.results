Similarly, Fig. 2B presents the same relationship for 14 cities within Hubei Province. These cities had received at least 100,000 travelers from Wuhan. From Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B , we observe a statistically significant positive linear relationship between the number of travelers from Wuhan and the cumulative case count in most provinces and cities. For two provinces, Zhejiang and Jiangsu (in Fig. 2A) , and two Hubei cities, Xiaogan and Huanggang (in Fig. 2B ), we observe superlinear growth in the cumulative case counts, explainable by the known significant secondary local transmissions.

Based on this latent infection ratio, we inferred that there were in total 18,556 (95% CI: 14,134-22,978) L&I persons in Wuhan before the lockdown, under the assumption that this latent infection ratio remained the same for people traveling from and remaining in Wuhan. Among these L&I persons, 10,887 (95% CI: 8,292-13,481) stayed in Wuhan on January 23, 2020, when the lockdown was initiated, and the remaining 7,669 (95% CI: 5,842-9,497) traveled to other parts of mainland China. Among the traveling L&I persons, 4,644-7,549 went to other places in Hubei Province, and 1,198 to 1,947 to places outside Hubei. We followed a similar geo-stratified debiasing process, relying on more reliable case counts outside of Hubei to estimate the basic reproduction number R0 for 2019-nCoV. Our R0 estimate is 3.24, indicating that on average one infected case is expected to generate 3.24 secondary infected cases prior to isolation or death. This value is within the range of that of the 2003 SARS epidemic (2-5) (8), and higher than that of influenza (2-3) (9) and Ebola (1.5-2.5) (10). Compared to the WHO's estimate (1.4-2.5) and other recently reported estimates (2.2-3.1) of 2019-nCoV (1, 3-5), our estimate is at the high end. This can be partially explained by the fact that most published estimates are based on all confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, including the Wuhan case counts, prone to the under-screening and underreporting biases. When considering the possibility of a large number of infected and infectious individuals who will not develop clinical disease, the actual value of R0 could be even higher. Building on the estimated latent infection ratio, R0, and the number of L&I persons in Wuhan when the lockdown started, we developed a customized epidemiological model to simulate the progression of the 2019-nCoV epidemic after the lockdown of Wuhan (see supplementary materials for details). Given the stringent nature of the lockdown measures and the continuing underreporting bias in Wuhan, the characteristics of the epidemic within and outside Wuhan were treated differently. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
