All the pigs were clinically healthy before virus inoculation. At the time of the first inoculation, nasal swabs were virus-negative and sera were free of antibodies against the respective viruses. Three DPI with PRRSV, virus excretion was detected in every group inoculated. These results indicate that PRRSV was replicating in the respiratory tract of pigs at the time of inoculation with the second virus. At the end of the experiments, all pigs had seroconverted against the viruses with which they had been inoculated.
