Biological activity of RpSP-D resembled that of NpSP-D First, we investigated whether RpSP-D had similar biological activity against IAV compared to NpSP-D isolated from pig lungs. To this end, the two preparations were tested against 15 H1N1 and 12 H3N2 IAV of swine, human and avian origin. HI assays were performed three times independently and the results are shown in figure 1 . RpSP-D inhibited hemagglutination by IAV to a similar extent as NpSP-D and statistical differences were not observed. Furthermore, the activity of both preparations was shown to be dependent on the presence of calcium ions, since no inhibition was observed in PBS without CaCl 2 . In this assay, peanut agglutinin, which was included as a control lectin, did not inhibit IAV-mediated hemagglutination.
