We collected data from 101 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection detected outside of the Hubei province before 28 January 2020 (Table 1) . Of these, 34 (34%) were known to be female, 63 were male (62%), and 4 were of unknown sex. The median age was 52 years (IQR: 36.5-59). Cases were collected from 17 countries and regions outside mainland China (n=72) and 21 provinces within mainland China (n=29). The majority of cases (n=92) had a known recent history of travel to or residence in Wuhan; others had evidence of contact with travelers from Hubei or known cases. Amongst those who developed symptoms in the community, the median time from symptom onset to hospitalization was 2.7 days (range 0.2-26.2). Fitting the log-normal model to all cases, we estimated the median incubation period of 2019-nCoV to be 5.2 days (95% CI: 4.4, 6.0). We estimated that fewer than 2.5% of infected individuals will display symptoms within 2.5 days (95% CI: 1.8, 3.6) of exposure, while symptom onset will occur within 10.5 days (95% CI: 7.3, 15.3) for 97.5% of infected individuals. The estimate of the dispersion parameter is 1.43 (95% CI: 1.22, 1.67). The estimated mean incubation period was 5.5 days. To control for possible bias from symptoms of cough or sore throat, which could have developed from other more-common pathogens, we performed the same analysis on the subset of cases with known time of fever onset (n=61), using the time from exposure to onset of fever as the incubation time. Here, we estimated the median incubation period to fever onset to be 5.7 days (95% CI: 4.5, 7.0), with 2.5% of individuals experiencing fever within 2.9 days (95% CI: 2.2, 4.7) and 97.5% of individuals experiencing fever within 11.4 days (95% CI: 6.1, 17.8) of exposure . Since assumptions about the occurrence of local transmission and therefore the period of possible exposure may be less firm within mainland China, we also performed an analysis of only cases detected outside mainland China (n=72). The median incubation period of these cases is 5.5 days (95% CI: 4,4, 7.0), with the 95% range spanning from 2.4 (95% CI: 1.7, 3.9) to 12.5 (95% CI 7.4, 19.0) days. Alternatively, cases who left mainland China may represent a subset of individuals with longer incubation periods, who were able to travel internationally before symptom onset within China, or may have chosen to delay reporting symptoms until they left China. Based on cases detected inside mainland China (n=29), the median incubation period is 4.6 days (95% CI: 3.4, 6.0), with a 95% range of 2.7 (95% CI: 1.2, 4.6) to 7.9 (95% CI: 3.9, 13.1) days. We fit other commonly-used parameterizations of the incubation period: gamma, Weibull, and Erlang distributions. The incubation period estimates for these alternate parameterizations were similar to the log-normal model and to prior estimates. Compared to the log-normal, gamma, and Weibull estimates from Backer et al (2020), our estimates have similar medians but shorter tails, both on the upper and lower bounds of the incubation period ( Figure 4 ). Given these estimates of the incubation period, we predicted the number of symptomatic infections we would expect to miss over the course of an active monitoring program. We classified individuals as high-risk if they are assumed to have a 1 in 100 chance of developing a symptomatic infection after exposure. For an active monitoring program with a duration of 7 days, the expected number of symptomatic infections missed for every 10,000 high-risk individuals monitored is 19.7 (99th percentile: 39.4; Table 2 ). After 14 days, it is highly unlikely .

However, we note that there remains substantial uncertainty in the classification of individuals as being at 'high', 'some' or 'low' risk of being symptomatic, and that this method does not consider the role of asymptomatic infection.
