Overexpressed Sec63, but not Sec62, Reduces the Steady-state Level of the Polytopic HBV.S Envelope Protein To study the role of the human Sec62 and Sec63 proteins, expression vectors encoding N-terminally Myc-tagged versions of these proteins were constructed and transiently transfected into HuH-7 human liver carcinoma cells. Upon deconvolution immunofluorescence and phase contrast microscopy, the ectopically expressed Sec62 and Sec63 constructs yielded an ER-like staining and partially colocalized with calnexin, a membraneanchored ER chaperone (Fig. 1A) . The constructs were next transfected together with a C-terminally hemagglutinin (HA)tagged version of the S envelope protein of HBV (HBV.S). HBV.S is cotranslationally integrated into the ER membrane, directed by the action of an uncleaved signal-anchor and a stop-transfer sequence encoded within its first and second TM segments [24] . The hydrophobic C-terminal half of HBV.S is predicted to further span the membrane two times thereby resulting in a fourfold membrane-spanning protein. After transient coexpression of the constructs, cell lysates were prepared with the non-denaturing detergent NP-40 and analyzed by Myc-and HA-specific Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1B , Sec62 and Sec63 were efficiently synthesized and appeared in about 46 and 87 kDa forms, respectively, in accord with their calculated molecular masses. HBV.S was obtained in its characteristic doublet of a 24 kDa nonglycosylated (p24) and a 27 kDa glycosylated (gp27) form as a consequence of partial N-linked glycosylation [25] . Intriguingly, the intracellular level of HBV.S was significantly lower when ectopically expressed Sec63 was present. In contrast, excess Sec62 reproducibly did not affect the level of HBV.S (Fig. 1B) . Similar results were obtained with cell lysates prepared with the denaturing detergent SDS (Fig. 1B) , indicating that the observed down-regulation of HBV.S by excess Sec63 was not merely due to changes in the solubility profile. Since the overexpression of Sec63 might be harmful for the cells, cytotoxicity assays of cellular supernatants were performed which did not reveal significant indications of cell damage (Fig. 1B) . Because Sec62 and Sec63 have been shown to associate with each other [13, 14] , the upregulation of Sec63 could evoke an imbalance of the complex partner. Therefore, the fate of HBV.S was analyzed in cells overexpressing both Sec62 and Sec63 proteins. Under these conditions, the levels of Sec62 and Sec63 were lower as compared to their individual expression. One explanation may be that Sec63 also reduced the steady-state level of the double-spanning Sec62 protein at the ER. Alternatively, this could be the consequence of a lower degree of transfection caused by the higher amount of plasmid DNA used for triple transfection. Nonetheless, even in consideration of a lower transfection rate, HBV.S was downregulated ( Fig. 1B) , implicating that the steady-state level of Sec62 is less important. In vitro-binding studies have identified the negatively charged C-terminus of Sec63 as the interaction domain for basic oligopeptide motifs within the N-terminus of Sec62 [14] . To examine whether the Sec62/Sec63 interaction might play a role in the function of Sec63, we analyzed a C-terminally truncated Sec63 mutant lacking large parts of the cytosolic domain including the Sec62 binding site. This Sec63DC mutant similarly down-regulated HBV.S (Fig. 1B) , thus arguing against an essential role of Sec62 in the observed action of Sec63. Following ER translocation, the HBV.S protein is able to selfassemble into subviral envelope particles (SVPs) that bud into intralumenal cisternae of post-ER/pre-medial-Golgi compartments and exit the cell by the constitutive pathway of secretion [25, 26] . To investigate whether the intracellular reduction of HBV.S by overexpressed Sec63 was simply due to an enhanced SVP export, lysates and supernatants of cotransfected cells were examined by an HBV.S-specific ELISA. This analysis, however, clearly revealed that excess Sec63 reduced both the intra-and extracellular pool of HBV.S. In contrast, overexpressed Sec62 did not interfere with the synthesis and secretion of HBV.S (Fig. 1C ). Overexpressed Sec63 Reduces the Steady-state Level of the Polytopic HBV.S Envelope Protein in a Dosedependent Manner To ascertain the degree of Sec63 overexpression, total Sec63 levels were examined in control-versus Sec63-transfected HuH-7 cells by using a polyclonal Sec63-specific antiserum for Western blotting. In order to ensure the true identification of endogeneous Sec63, cells were depleted for Sec63 by treatment with specific siRNA duplexes. As shown in Fig. 2A , endogeneous Sec63 was absent in lysates of siSec63-treated cells. Due to the Myc-tag, exogeneous Sec63 displayed a slower electrophoretic mobility that allowed its distinction from the endogenous isoform ( Fig. 2A) . Upon serial dilution of the Sec63-transfected lysate and quantification, we calculated that exogeneous Sec63 was overexpressed about 3.2-fold. An accompanying titration experiment showed that Sec63 down-regulated HBV.S in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B) . Thereby, the most prominent decline in the HBV.S steady state level appeared when the concentration of the transfected Sec63 DNA was raised above 1.5 mg/10 6 cells (Fig. 2B ). To rule out the possibility that up-regulated Sec63 had effects on mRNA production or stability, the HBV.S-specific transcript levels were measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Although we noticed a modest decline of the HBV.Sspecific mRNA in Sec63-overexpressing cells (Fig. 2C ), this drop is unlikely to account for the impact of Sec63 on the steady-state HBV.S pool.
