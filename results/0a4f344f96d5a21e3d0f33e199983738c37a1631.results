We first look at our model for the four regions in Kenya with the highest HIV/AIDS prevalences: Nairobi, Kisumu, Homa Bay and Siaya [39] . Fig 4 shows the case where R B < 1 so that the disease is decreasing overall. When human mobility is included, the infectious and the removed individuals decrease even more rapidly than in the case where no mobility is included in the model. Homa Bay has a higher percentage of infectious individuals compared to the other regions, followed by Nairobi and Kisumu. For regions with higher prevalence, the mobility has a observable but relatively small effect on the disease dynamics. For example, after 8 years if mobility is not included Siaya region has 68,910 infectious individuals, while including mobility it has 67,790 infectious individuals. This is approximately a 1.6% decrease. In Fig 5, we plot the results when R B < 1 for the four regions with the smallest initial HIV/ AIDS prevalences: Wajir, Laikipia, Kirinyaga and Marsabit [39] . For these regions, including human mobility in the model dynamics slightly increases the number of infectious individuals in all the selected regions. For example, after 8 years without human mobility, Wajir region has 2,217 infectious individuals, while including human mobility gives 2,334 infectious individuals. This is approximately a 5% increase. It seems that human mobility tends to increase infectious individuals in regions with initially low HIV prevalences. In Fig 6, we plot the results for the regions with the highest HIV prevalence when R B > 1. Once again, it seems that human mobility tends to slightly decrease the number of infectious individuals in these regions. For example, if the mobility is not included between the regions, after 8 years we see that Nairobi has an 567,500 infectious individuals, but if we introduce mobility in the model, it has an approximate of 536,300 infectious individuals; this is almost a 5.5% decrease. Fig 7 shows the dynamics of the four regions with the lowest initial HIV prevalences. It can also be observed that human mobility tends to increase the infectious individuals in regions with initially low HIV prevalences. For example, after 8 years without mobility, Marsabit region has 38,550 infectious individuals, while including human mobility gives 39,320 infectious individuals; this is approximately a 2% increase. Based on the results for the regions above, we see that human mobility decreases new HIV infections in the regions whose initial HIV prevalence is high and it increases new HIV infections in regions with low HIV prevalence. To summarise the effect of infections across regions, we look at the incidence rate. We define the incidence rate as estimated from the log of the gradient of the growth of the infectious class [52, 53] . First we find the increases of I i for each region. The solutions follow exponential growth, and we thus transform the solutions by taking the log. The region with the biggest positive slope corresponds to the region with highest increase in incidence rate of HIV infectious. The region with biggest negative slope corresponds to the one with the biggest decrease in incidence rate of the HIV infections. In Fig 8, we plot the incidence rate against the HIV prevalence rate, when there is no mobility and when there is mobility for R B < 1. It can be seen that human mobility tends to increase the HIV incidences for the regions with initially low HIV prevalence; at the same time it tends to decrease the incidence rate of most of the regions with initially high HIV prevalence. Specifically, with the exception of Narok and Nairobi, it can also be observed that 7% is a threshold value of initial HIV prevalence above which human mobility decreases the HIV infection rate; below this value, human mobility tend to increase the HIV infections rate in a region. In Fig 9, we plot the incidence rate against the HIV prevalence rate for R B > 1. In this case, mobility increases the incidence rates in regions with low HIV prevalence and also slightly increases the incidence rates in the regions with high HIV prevalences, but the increase is very small compared to regions with low HIV prevalences. We also look at the country-wide impact of human mobility on HIV infections. In Fig 10a, we plot the difference of the total number of infectious in the country when R B < 1. Mobility slightly increases the number of infectious individuals in the country as a whole. For example, without including human mobility between the regions, after 8 years Kenya would have Table) and HIV data from [39] . (b) Human travel networks (S6 Table) as estimated by [38] . Monthly average number of trips per 1000 individuals between all pairs of regions over the course of the year. For clarity, only trips made per 1000 individuals that are more than 60 trips per year are shown, with arrows indicating the direction of movements from home region to a visited region. The thickness of the arrow represents the number of trips made. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0142805.g003 902,300 infectious individuals, while including human mobility between its regions it has 600 additional infectious individuals. This is only a 0.07% increase. For R B > 1, we observe that human mobility increases the overall number of infectious individuals in the country (Fig 10b) . We observe that, without human mobility in this case, Kenya would have 3,232,000 infectious individual compared to 3,248,000 infectious individuals with mobility. This gives a difference of 16,000 infectious individuals, an approximately 0.5% increase.
