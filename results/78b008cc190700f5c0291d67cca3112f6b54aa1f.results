From a comprehensive search of the primary literature, we found 188 virus species that have been reported to infect humans, going back to yellow fever virus in 1901 (table 1) . Since then, the number of human virus species discovered in any given year has ranged from zero to six. As is typical (Bebber et al. 2007) , the cumulative species discovery curve increases slowly initially and then more rapidly (figure 1). Piecewise linear regression suggests no further upswings since 1954, roughly corresponding to the advent of tissue culture techniques for virus detection (figure 1). We confirmed that our model reproduced the observed slight downward trend in the rate of discovery since 1954 (figure 1) and the observed variance in the data from 1954 to 2006 (figure 2). The distribution of the number of virus species discovered per year shows slight overdispersion (meanZ2.69; varianceZ3.07; varianceto-mean ratio greater than 1) which falls within the predicted range (meanZ2.70 with 95% credible interval 2.41-3.00; varianceZ3.03 with interval 1.99-4.49). Together, these results support our choice of model, even though we do not explicitly consider heterogeneity in the probability of discovering a given species in any one year ( p) or temporal variation in sampling effort, detection techniques and reporting. Noting that p and N are highly correlated (figure 3), our best estimate for p is 0.015 (95% credible interval, 0.004-0.026) with 117 (38-562) so far undiscovered virus species. Extrapolating the discovery curve, allowing for parameter uncertainty and stochastic discovery, we obtain a best estimate of 22 new species (10-40) by 2020 ( figure 1) . Data on the cumulative discovery of new virus families are also reproducible (figure 4). The predicted distribution of the number of virus families discovered per year (assuming random allocation of species to families) compares favourably with the observed distribution ( figure 5 ). This provides further support for the appropriateness of our model. Virus discovery curve M. E. J. Woolhouse et al. 2113
