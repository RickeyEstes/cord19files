Immunization of horses and production of equine antibody products. The horses were immunized with eVLP produced from the infection of Sf9 cells with rBV-VP40-GP. The filamentous eVLP were observed under an electron microscope (Supplementary Figure 1 ) and confirmed to be morphologically similar to EBOV. Immunoblotting of rBV-VP40-GP infected Sf9 cell lysates demonstrated that the eVLP contained EBOV GP and VP40 (Supplementary Figure 2) . Three horses were immunized intramuscularly (IM) with 7 injections of eVLP over 11 weeks and the hyperimmune sera were collected from each animal at specified timepoints ( Fig. 1A) to determine the serum titers by neutralization assay against a recombinant HIV-1 virus pseudotyped with EBOV GP. A pseudotyped-virus was used for these studies to confirm the in vitro efficacy of the antisera preparations under Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) conditions, before subsequent studies in the BSL-4 laboratory. Neutralizing serum titers were detectable after the 5th immunization at week 6, and increased until the 7th immunization at week 11 (Fig. 1B) . The serum neutralizing antibody titers of two horses were 1:40,960 after seven immunizations, and was 1:20,480 for the third animal. The equine antisera (purified by ammonium sulphate-based precipitation) was then digested with pepsin at a concentration of 5-10 U/ml for 45 to 90 min and purified to generate F(ab′ ) 2 fragments. The purity of the antisera and F(ab′ ) 2 preparations, as determined by SDS-PAGE followed by thin layer chromatography, was determined to be 95% and 83%, respectively (Fig. 2) . Approximately 2000 mL of purified antisera could be obtained from each horse during each collection, with the stock concentration between 20-25 mg/mL. Up to 3-5 collections can be performed on each horse, therefore each hyperimmunized horse yields between 120 to 250 g of purified antisera. In vitro characterization of equine antisera and F(ab') 2 . The equine antisera and F(ab′ ) 2 products were first characterized against a laboratory generated EBOV-eGFP for their potential to neutralize EBOV. Equine antisera and F(ab′ ) 2 were found to possess levels of similar neutralizing activity, with the half effective maximal concentration (EC 50 ) of the products to be 1.07 μg/mL and 2.12 μg/mL, respectively (Fig. 3) . Moreover, the neutralization activities of both the equine antisera and F(ab′ ) 2 were complete at a concentration of 12.5 μg/mL, Scientific RepoRts | 6:24179 | DOI: 10.1038/srep24179 indicating that the two products were indistinguishable from each other in terms of neutralization at high concentrations. EBOV-specific IgG in the equine antisera preparations were also determined by ELISA. Serial 2-fold The neutralizing activities of equine antisera and F(ab′ ) 2 against EBOV-eGFP were compared over different concentrations (x-axis). Total fluorescence from infected VeroE6 cells at 3 dpi were shown as a percentage of the fluorescence observed with the PBS control, which is set at 100% (y-axis). Samples were processed in triplicate, and error bars indicate standard error. Data shown in this figure are representative of three independent neutralization studies with F(ab′ ) 2 or antisera. dilutions of stock antisera with a concentration of 18-20 mg/mL were assayed in triplicate over three independent experiments, and the titer was determined to be between 10,240 and 20,480 endpoint dilutions.
