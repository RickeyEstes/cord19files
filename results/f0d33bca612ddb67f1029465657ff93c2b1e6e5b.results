The potential "pseudoknot" structure downstream of the putative frameshift signal We previously identified a potential ribosomal frameshift signal (GGGAAAC) located near the 5' end of the gag-pal log-base overlapping region (Morikawa et al., 1991) . Similar sequences are observed in retroviruses such as visna virus, Mason Pfizer monkey virus, and SRV-1 (Sonigo et a/., 1985 (Sonigo et a/., , 1986 ; Power et a/., 1986). As illustrated in Fig. 1 , downstream of this potential signal is a sequence that has the potential to form a tertiary "pseudoknot" structure similar to those of RSV (Jacks et al., 1988b) and IBV (Brierley et a/., 1989) . This is in contrast to the situation for HIV-1 which does not possess such a sequence or structure in the equivalent region (Wilson et al., 1988) .
