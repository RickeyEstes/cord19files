Niclosamide inhibits Xoo bacterial growth. To evaluate the functional effect of niclosamide on bacterial blight, we first examined its effect on the growth of Xoo bacteria using three different strains, PXO99, 10208, and K3a, and Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. glycines (Xag). The results showed that growth of the Xoo strains was completely inhibited by 5 μ g/ml niclosamide, whereas Xag growth was inhibited by 15 μ g/ml niclosamide (Fig. 1a) . Xag is a pathogen that causes bacterial leaf pustule disease in soybean 45 . We also examined the effect of niclosamide on the growth of the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Niclosamide did exert an inhibitory effect on the growth of 12 M. oryzae strains, although the inhibition was considerably weaker than that against Xoo (Fig. 1b) . We also tested the effects of parthenolide, a sesquiterpene lactone with anti-tumor activity, on the growth of the Xoo strains PXO99 and 10208. Parthenolide failed to inhibit the growth of either Xoo strain at a concentration of 5 μ g/ml, although it slightly inhibited bacterial growth at 50 μ g/ml (Fig. 1c) . We also tested the effect of niclosamide on the growth of three E. coli strains, Top10, Rosseta2, and DH10b, which served as Gram-negative control bacteria. At lower concentrations, niclosamide had no effect on the growth of these E. coli strains, although it slightly inhibited growth at 50 μ g/ml (Fig. 1d) . To determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of niclosamide on PXO99 and 10208 growth, we tested concentrations ranging from 0-5 μ g/ml. Both Xoo strains could grow in the presence of 4 μ g/ml niclosamide, but not 5 μ g/ml niclosamide ( Fig. 1e; left panel) . We further narrowed the MIC of niclosamide from 4-5 μ g/ml. As shown in Fig. 1e , the growth of both PXO99 and 10208 was completely inhibited by 4.2 μ g/ml niclosamide ( Fig. 1e ; right panel), indicating that 4.2 μ g/ml niclosamide is the MIC for both Xoo strains. Rice bacterial blight is blocked by niclosamide. We examined whether niclosamide blocks bacterial blight in rice. For this experiment, we grew the rice cultivar Nipponbare in a growth chamber for 12 weeks (before bolting), and subjected the plants to pathogen and niclosamide treatment. First, to determine the minimum concentration of niclosamide that would block bacterial blight, we examined the niclosamide dosage effect on disease responses to the representative Xoo strain PXO99. We inoculated PXO99 onto Nipponbare using the leaf-clipping method, sprayed the plants with different niclosamide concentrations, and examined the phenotypes of plants treated with pathogen only or pathogen plus niclosamide. Leaf wilting did not develop in plants treated with ≥ 8 μ g/ml niclosamide (Fig. 2a) . We also estimated lesion development by measuring lesion length. Lesion development also was significantly inhibited by 8 μ g/ml niclosamide, although a small lesion was still detected at this concentration (Fig. 2b) . Lesion development gradually declined with increasing niclosamide concentrations (Fig. 2b) . We also examined the levels of bacterial growth, and found that population levels of Xoo bacteria declined with increasing niclosamide concentrations (Fig. 2c) . We next examined the effect of niclosamide on rice disease responses to Xoo bacteria after treatment with PXO99. First, Nipponbare rice was inoculated with PXO99 by the leaf-clipping method. After incubation for four days until leaf blight lesions with a length of 2 cm developed, the plants were sprayed with 8 μ g/ml niclosamide (Fig. 3) . Leaf blight was completely blocked in niclosamide-treated leaves (Fig. 3a) . Lesion development also was completely blocked in niclosamide-treated leaves (Fig. 3b) , and PXO99 growth was inhibited (Fig. 3c ). Niclosamide has a systemic effect on rice disease response. We next investigated whether niclosamide could move from the site of local application to distant tissues and subsequently inhibit PXO99-mediated leaf wilting. We inoculated half of the leaves of Nipponbare plants with PXO99 and covered them with polythene bags. Then, we sprayed the non-inoculated leaves with niclosamide and examined leaf blight in both local and systemic leaves. Leaf wilting and lesion development were completely inhibited in PXO99-inoculated leaves that had not been treated with niclosamide ( Fig. 4a,b ). PXO99 growth also was significantly inhibited in the inoculated leaves (Fig. 4c) . Next, we examined the long-distance movement of niclosamide by extracting niclosamide from niclosamide-treated leaves and untreated systemic leaves. Niclosamide levels gradually increased in systemic leaves ( Fig. 5a,b) , indicating that niclosamide can systemically move from niclosamide-treated local leaves to untreated distal leaves. Niclosamide induces the expression of defense-related genes. We next examined whether niclosamide protects PXO99-infected plants through the induction of pathogen-related gene expression. We treated the rice cultivar Nipponbare with different niclosamide concentrations for 24 h, and then extracted total RNA from niclosamide-treated and untreated control plants. We performed qRT-PCR analysis to examine the transcript levels of seven defense-related genes, including OsPR1, OsPR10, OsWRKY45, OsWRKY62, OsWRKY71, OsHI-LOX, and OsACS2. The results showed that OsPR1, OsPR10, OsWRKY45, OsWRKY62, OsWRKY71, and OsHI-LOX were induced by niclosamide treatment, and that transcript expression levels increased with increasing niclosamide levels (Fig. 6 ). However, OsACS2 expression was only slightly increased 30 min after treatment with 40 μ g/ml niclosamide, which suggests that its expression was not affected by niclosamide (Fig. 6 ). The pathogenesis-related genes OsPR1, OsPR10, OsWRKY45, OsWRKY62, and OsWRKY71 are induced by high salicylate (SA) levels [46] [47] [48] [49] ; therefore, we measured free SA and glucosyl-SA levels in the leaves of niclosamide-treated rice plants. SA levels increased in response to niclosamide treatment (Fig. 7a,b) , indicating that niclosamide induces the expression of pathogenesis-related genes by increasing the levels of SA and SA-conjugates. Niclosamide has no effect on rice growth and development. We examined the effect of niclosamide on rice growth and development from the vegetative stage to seed maturation. Three-week-old rice plants were treated with 8 μ g/ml niclosamide at 4-day intervals and the phenotypic characteristics of niclosamide-treated and -untreated plants were examined at 80 days after planting. Plant height and leaf characteristics were not altered by niclosamide treatment, although the contents of chlorophyll and other compounds (SPAD values) were slightly reduced in niclosamide-treated plants ( Fig. 8a-g) . Seed characteristics such as color, number, and weight were not affected by niclosamide treatment (Fig. 8h-l) , indicating that niclosamide does not have any detrimental effects on rice growth, development, and grain yield.
