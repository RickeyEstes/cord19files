The mean age of the study participants was 60.3 Â± 15.3 years and 213 (66.1%) of the participants were male. The reasons for admission were cardiovascular disease (203, 63.0%), lung disease (49, 15.2%), malignancy (35, 10 .9%) and others (35, 10 .9%). One hundred and thirty seven (42.5%) patients had received cardiopulmonary resuscitation within 24 h prior to ECMO initiation. After the median (IQR) 2 (0-10) days of admission, the patients received ECMO insertion because of cardiotomy (31, 9. 6%), non-operative cardiovascular causes (185, 57.5%), adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (43, 13.4%), non-ARDS lung causes (44, 13.7%) and other causes (19, 5.9%) . Two hundred and thirty (71.4%) and 92 (28.6%) patients received VA and VV ECMO support, respectively. One hundred and six (32.9%) patients were undergoing IABP on the date of ECMO insertion. The median (IQR) duration from ECMO initiation to death or discharge was 21 days. The incidence of AKI comprising all KDIGO grades was 82.3%. In-hospital mortality was 51.6%. The median (IQR) durations for AKI and in-hospital mortality were 2 (1-7) days and 9 (4-23) days, respectively. We explored the factors associated with in-hospital mortality. AKI developed less frequently in the survivor group than in the non-survivor group. Moreover, stage 3 AKI developed significantly less in the survivors than in the non-survivors. SAPS2 and the serum sodium level were significantly lower in the survivors than in the non-survivors. Ventilator settings, such as positive end expiratory pressure and peak inspiratory pressure before ECMO insertion, did not affect the survival rate. The ECMO pump speed was significantly lower in the survivors than in the non-survivors. Age, causes of admission, causes of ECMO support, mode of ECMO, use of IABP, length of stay before ECMO insertion, duration of ECMO support, initial urine output, BUN, creatinine, RDW and CRP were associated with in-hospital mortality ( Table 1) . We performed a multivariate Cox-proportional hazard regression analysis to adjust confounding effects among the selected variables. Compared to the non-AKI group, the stage 3 AKI group significantly increased the risk of in-hospital mortality whereas the stage 1 and 2 AKI groups did not (Table 2 ). In the Kaplan-Meier survival curves according to the stages of AKI, the estimated mean (95% CI) survival in the non-AKI group and the stage 1, 2, and 3 groups were 65.7 (55.2-76.2) days, 54.0 (45.8-62.3) days, 53.8 (38.7-69.0) days and 33.6 (27.9-39.4) days, respectively (p < 0.001 by log-rank test). In the post-hoc analysis, the stage 3 AKI group, but not the stage 1 (p = 0.14) or 2 (p = 0.43) AKI groups, showed a significant difference in survival compared with the non-AKI group (Fig 1) . With every increment in SAPS2, serum sodium level, and ECMO pump speed (1 score in SAPS2, 1 mmol/L in serum sodium level, and 1,000 rpm in ECMO pump speed), the risks of in-hospital mortality were increased, with HRs (95% CI, p-value) of 1.02 (1.004-1.035, 0.01), 1.042 (1.014-1.070, 0.003) and 1.333 (1.020-1.742, 0.04), respectively ( Table 2) . We performed a calibration and discrimination analysis of SAPS2, serum sodium level, and ECMO pump speed to predict in-hospital mortality. All three variables were well-calibrated. The AUROC analysis showed the discriminative power of these variables. The cut-off values of SAPS2, serum sodium level, and ECMO pump speed for in-hospital mortality were a score of 69.5, 147.6 mmol/L, and 2.19 x 10 3 rpm, respectively (Table 3) . We compared clinical characteristics according to the mode of ECMO. The length of the hospital stay before ECMO insertion was shorter in patients with VA mode than in those with VV mode. The level of CRP was lower in the VA mode group than in the VV mode group. Nonetheless, SAPS2 was not different between the two groups. The initial ECMO settings were also comparable between the two groups. According to the linear regression analysis, there was no correlation between SAPS2 and ECMO speed either in VV mode (R 2 = 0.003, p = 0.59) or VA mode (R 2 = 0.001, p = 0.709). The mortality within 2 weeks after ECMO insertion was significantly higher in patients with VA mode than in those with VV mode (p = 0.03), whereas the overall in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in the VA mode group than that in the VV mode group (p = 0.02). Compared to the patients with the VV mode, those with the VA mode had shorter stays in the intensive care unit and hospital; however, there was no difference in the occurrence of AKI between the two groups (Table 4 ). Because AKI, especially stage 3 AKI, showed a significant association with in-hospital mortality, we attempted to detect the risk factors associated with AKI and stage 3 AKI. We compared the characteristics between the patients with and without AKI. The initial ECMO pump (Table 5) . These variables were also significant risk factors for developing stage 3 AKI (Table 6) . There was an additional risk factor in stage 3 AKI. The RDW was significantly lower in those without stage 3 AKI than in those with stage 3 AKI. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the RDW was still statistically significant, with an OR (95% CI, p-value) of 1.308 (1.053-1.625, 0.02) for every 1% increase (Table 6 ). In the calibration and discrimination analysis, stage 3 AKI was well-calibrated and discriminated by a cut-off value of 14.1% for RDW (Table 3) . We compared patient characteristics according to the RDW status. Patients with an RDW above 14.1% showed significantly higher level of CRP than did those with an RDW below 14.1%. Moreover, patients with an RDW above 14.1% showed considerably lower hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration than did those with an RDW below 14.1% (Table 7) .
