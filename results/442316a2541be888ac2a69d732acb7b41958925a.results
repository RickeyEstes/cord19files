For the study, appropriate in-process samples were collected from OCTAGAM full-scale production. Before pre-adjustment of the pH, this process intermediate was supplemented with SD and finally spiked with SARS-CoV at a ratio of 1 in 20. This starting material (with only 0.23% [w/w] TNBP and 0.75% [w/w] Octoxynol) was incubated at 6.0 G 0.5 C for 30 min. To determine the kinetics of virus inactivation, test samples were taken at predefined intervals during the process (1, 3, 5, 10, 20 and 30 min). The SD treatment was terminated by a 1:250 dilution with cell culture medium. The diluted test samples were screened with susceptible cells (Vero) for SARS-CoV infectivity by bulk analysis. The SARS-CoV titre detected in the starting material prior to SD treatment was 5.93 G 0.25 log 10 TCID 50 /ml. The results of Fig. 2 and Table 1 demonstrate that SARS-CoV was completely inactivated below the limit of detection within 1 min of SD treatment. Depending on the sample volume tested the detection limit varied between 1.37 log 10 TCID 50 /ml and 0.18 log 10 TCID 50 / ml. In both independently performed tests similar results were obtained. Taking into consideration the various handling procedures during the laboratory experiment (e.g. spike with virus, careful mixing of the virus-spiked intermediate, sterile sampling of an aliquot, dilution with cell culture medium for terminating the inactivation process), less than 1 min was required. The resulting log reduction factor is R5.75 G 0.25 log 10 TCID 50 /ml. Both virus stock controls and virus-spiked intermediate controls showed the expected values and demonstrated the validity of the study (Table 1 ). This means that the differences of the virus titre at the beginning and at the end of the incubation period was !0.5 log 10 TCID 50 /ml. Furthermore, the termination control confirmed that the 1:250 dilutions were more than sufficient to terminate the inactivation of SARS-CoV by SD (titre difference !0.5 log 10 TCID 50 /ml). In a cytotoxicity and interference pre-study, this dilution was found to be non-cytotoxic and did not interfere with the SARS-CoV/Vero cells system (titre difference !0.5 log 10 TCID 50 /ml).
