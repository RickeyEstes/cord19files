The age of the 433 patients included in the study ranged from 15 to 93 years, mean (±S.D.): 56.3 (18.2) years, median (IQR): 57.0 (41.0-72.0) years. Temporal distribution of samples collected over the 1-year study period is shown in Fig. 1 . HCoV-NL63 was detected in 10 (2.0%) of 510 samples. Of the 10 positive samples, 3 were co-infected with human rhinovirus (HRV) and 1 with adenovirus (see Table 1 ). Demographic and clinical characteristics of positive cases are reported in Table 1 . The overall frequency of HCoV-NL63 infected patients was equally distributed between genders. The age of HCoV-NL63 positive patients ranged from 29 to 85 years (mean ± S.D. was 60.1 [18.3] years; median IQR was 64.5 [41.5-76.0] years). All patients were symptomatic, and had clinically relevant respiratory diseases, including bronchopneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, community-acquired pneumonia, and acute respiratory failure. Three patients were in the intensive care unit and needed mechanical ventilation; two patients were immunosuppressed, due to solid organ tumour or HIV infection. Only 5 of 10 positive samples had sufficient material to allow for genetic characterization. Sequence analysis of the S and ORF1a gene fragments showed 97-99% similarity to the prototype HCoV-NL63 1988 and 2003 Netherland isolates (GenBank accession numbers: AY567487, AY518894). As expected, the phylogenetic tree built on ORF1a contained two clusters: 4 out of the 5 of Italian isolates were included in cluster 1, while one isolate (R3) had the characteristics of an outlier (Fig. 2) . The phylogenetic analysis of S gene nucleotide sequences is shown in Fig. 3 . Besides the 5 patients described in Fig. 2 (indicated as Southern-Central Italy), 7 additional patients identified in Pavia (indicated as Northern Italy) had S gene sequence data available, and were included in this analysis, together with 12 French isolates and 2 prototype isolates whose sequences were available in GenBank. From this tree it was not possible to identify any cluster with bootstrap values >80. However, one of the Italian isolates (PV5) was included in a subcluster with the French isolate AY994247 (bootstrap values = 78; Fig. 3) , that was proposed to be an outlier by Vabret et al. (2005) . The phylogenetic analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences for the analyzed S and ORF1a gene fragments was consistent with that based on nucleotide sequences (not shown).
