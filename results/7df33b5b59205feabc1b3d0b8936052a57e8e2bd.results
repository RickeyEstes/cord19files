Children segregated into three groups according to their clinical condition after the follow-up period (Table 1 ): in 24 children health had strikingly improved, i.e. they had no significant respiratory tract infections at all during the last 6 months (Group 1), in 12 children the health had mildly improved (respiratory tract infections less than 6 episodes and/or acute otitis media less than 4 episodes during the last 6 months, (Group 2), while 12 children had suffered 6 or more upper respiratory tract infections and/or 4 or more episodes of acute otitis media during the last 6 months (Group 3). The children of Group 3 were significantly younger than those in the improved Group 1 (P<0.02), ( had not yet come to an end (P < 0.05), (Table 1) . Duration of the infection chain in Groups 1 and 2 did not differ from each other. Median age at the onset of the infections differed also between Groups 1 and 3 (P < 0.05), (Table 1) . Six out of the 12 children in Group 3 had their onset before the age of 6 months while in Group 2 and 3 only 2/12 and 3/24 children did so. In Group 1 children with improved health, geometric means of the IFN titres were now higher than 2 years previously, and a statistically significant difference was seen in cultures stimulated with corona-and RS-viruses (Fig. 1) . In Group 2 a similar tendency was seen (Fig. 2) , although the finding was not statistically significant. In the third group, where the children were still suffering from recurrent respiratory tract infections, the mean IFN titres had not changed during the two years (Fig. 3) . Relatively little variation in individual IFN yields between the two specimens was seen among the children in Group 3. Leukocyte cultures from all the children showed a maximum difference of 1-2 dilution steps in the IFN assay between 1992 and 1994, when stimulated with four out of the five different viruses. Somewhat more variation was seen in cultures stimulated with rhinovirus. In Group 1, the IFN levels had increased or remained similar to those obtained in 1992 except one child who showed a decline. In Group 2, the IFN responses showed quite a similar tendency as in the group 1. Of the 10 children whose leukocytes in 1992 failed to produce any detectable IFN when stimulated with either adeno-, rhinoor coronavirus, none showed now a total lack of IFN production, and some showed a striking increase in the IFN yields produced. Only two of them still suffered from recurrent infections. Spontaneous IFN production was not detected in any leukocyte cultures. The production of IFN was influenced by neither the age nor the sex of the children.
