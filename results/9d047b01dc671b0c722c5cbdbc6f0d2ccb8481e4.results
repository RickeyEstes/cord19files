A total of 600 hospitalized pneumonia patients were enrolled at Sibu and Kapit Hospitals between June 15, 2017 and May 15, 2018, with 389 of the subjects enrolled at Sibu Hospital (64.8%) and 211 enrolled at Kapit Hospital (35.2%). Of the enrolled subjects, 325 (54.2%) were male. A total of 385 (64.2%) enrolled subjects were children 5 years of age or younger and 439 (73.2%) were of age 18 years and younger. The majority of participants identified as Iban, with 253 (65.0%) Iban subjects enrolled at Sibu Hospital and 188 (89.1%) Iban subjects enrolled at Kapit Hospital (Table 1) . Of the 600 NP swabs collected, 599 were run using rRT-PCR/ rPCR; 1 NP swab collected from a pediatric patient at Sibu Hospital was accidentally destroyed before molecular screening. One or more viruses were detected by rRT-PCR/rPCR in 48.1% of the 599 samples testing positive or suspect positive for either IAV, IBV, ICV, IDV, AdV, EV, CoV, RSV-A, RSV-B, PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, or PIV-4. The prevalence of each pathogen out of the total number of patients enrolled by month is shown in Figure 1 . We detected coinfections in 42 of the 275 patients with evidence of viral infection ( Table 2) . Of the coinfected specimens, AdV was detected in approximately 65% (n = 27) with the most common coinfection combination being AdV and RSV (9 AdV/ RSV-B coinfections and 6 AdV/RSV-A coinfections) followed by 7 AdV/EV coinfections. Respiratory syncytial virus subtype B was the second most prevalent virus among coinfections (n = 15); in addition to coinfections with AdV-positive specimens, RSV-B was also detected in specimens found positive by rRT-PCR for RSV-A, PIV-1, EV, IAV, and IBV. One pediatric patient's specimen was positive for 3 viruses (RSV-B, AdV, and EV). Overall, the most prevalent virus detected was RSV (Table  3) , with 122 samples testing positive for either RSV-A or RSV-B (overall prevalence of 20.4%; prevalence of 26.9% among children <18 years). A total of 85 specimens tested positive by rRT-PCR for RSV-A for an overall prevalence of 14.2%. An additional 7 specimens were suspect-positive for RSV-A (Ct values ranged 38.3-39.7); however, suspect-positive specimens were not included in the final analyses. Eighty-two of the RSV-A-positive samples were from children â‰¤5 years age 5, totaling a prevalence of 21.4%. A total of 37 (6.2% prevalence) specimens were positive for RSV-B by rRT-PCR, with 2 additional suspect-positive specimens (Ct values ranged 38.9-39.6). Thirtyfive of those specimens were collected from children <18 years (8.0% prevalence). After RSV, AdV and IAV were the most prevalent, each with 62 positive specimens detected by rPCR and rRT-PCR, respectively, for an overall prevalence of 10.4%. Fifty-seven of the AdV specimens were collected from children <18 years (13% prevalence), and 46 of the IAV specimens were collected from children <18 years (10.5% prevalence). A lower prevalence (2.2%) of IBV was detected, with 13 IBV-positive specimens, 9 of which were collected from children <18 years of age. Twenty-five specimens were positive for EV with a 4.2% prevalence overall and 5.3% prevalence among children <18 years. Six specimens were positive by rRT-PCR for CoV. Among the PIV types, PIV-3 was the most prevalent, with 10 specimens testing positive for PIV-3, followed by 6 PIV-1 detections, 4 PIV-4 detections, and 1 PIV-2 detection. No specimens were determined to be positive for ICV or IDV; however, there were 2 suspect-positive IDV samples (Ct values ranged 38.2-39.3), which we were unsuccessful at isolating at Duke University. One patient of the 600 enrolled was pregnant and tested positive for IAV. Three severe adverse events were reported to the Malaysian ethics board for participants who died after enrollment. All 3 deaths were pediatric patients under 1 year of age with negative blood cultures. Human adenovirus was detected in the NP swab specimens of 2 of those patients, 1 of whom had an endotracheal tube culture that grew Enterobacter aerogenes before death. Respiratory syncytial virus subtype A was detected in the third patient's NP swab. No coinfections were detected among these patients. Due to low counts, CoV, ICV, IDV, and PIV1-4 disease outcomes were not included in the risk factor analysis. Across the 6 disease outcomes examined (RSV-A, RSV-B, IAV, IBV, EV, and AdV), gender was not found as a statistically significant risk factor in the initial bivariate screenings. Additional potential risk factors such as pre-existing diseases, treatment history, and Animal contact defined as touched or come within 1 meter in the last 30 days. c Other animals include the following: cow, rats, rabbits, snake, and monkey. ethnicity were eliminated in the stepwise, backward-elimination multivariate modeling. The month of enrollment was a statistically significant risk factor for most virus outcomes, including RSV-A, RSV-B, IAV, and AdV (Tables 4 and 5 and Supplementary Tables 3 and  4 ). Respiratory syncytial virus subtype A was most prevalent during the first month of enrollment, June-July 2017 with an adjusted OR of 7.2 (95% CI, 1.6-33.5) compared with RSV-A detection by rRT-PCR in November-December 2017 (Table 4 ). In contrast, there was a very low detection of RSV-B in June-July 2017 (see Supplementary Figure 2 ). Compared to June-July 2017, RSV-B had an increased adjusted OR beginning mid-February, with an adjusted OR of 23.1 (95% CI, 2.9-185.6) between April 15 and May 14, 2018 (Table 5) . We detected AdV in over 30% of the 72 specimens collected from April 15 to May 14, 2018. Compared to the month of October-November 2017, there was an increased adjusted OR of 16.9 (95% CI, 2.1-133.4) of AdV infection during the month of April-May. The only disease outcome for which location of hospitalization (Kapit versus Sibu) was statistically significant was EV; patients with specimens found positive for EV had a 2.4 higher OR (95% CI, 1.1-5.5) of being enrolled at Kapit Hospital compared with Sibu Hospital (see Supplementary Table 5) . Age was a statistically significant risk factor for RSV-A, RSV-B, and AdV, with pediatric patients ages 1 month to 1 year and 1 to 2 years having increased adjusted OR compared with patients >18 years of age. Detection of RSV-A and RSV-B was associated with quartiles of household size (number of additional cohabitants) (Tables 4 and 5 ). The only animal exposure that was statistically associated with a disease outcome was cat exposure for IBV, with those patients reporting coming into contact with a cat within 1 meter in the last 30 days having an OR 5.4 times higher (95% CI, 1.8-16.9) than those patients who did not have contact with a cat.
