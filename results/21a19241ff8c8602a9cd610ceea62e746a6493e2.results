A total of 3879 papers were retrieved from the three databases; of which, 38 were assessed for eligibility by reading the full text. Of these, 13 studies provided data suitable for the calculation of risk ratio (RR), 5 giving psychological outcomes 17-21 and 12 non-psychological 19 22-32 ; and 8 provided data for the calculation of standardised mean differences (SMD), 6 giving psychological outcomes 21 30 33-36 and 2 non-psychological. 29 37 Further six studies did not provide raw data but are included in the results; three each giving psychological outcomes [38] [39] [40] and non-psychological outcomes. 17 41 42 Meta-analyses were possible on two outcomes: anxiety and depression from eight studies by using standardised mean difference. 19-21 30 33-36 Where only RR data were given 20 21 conversion to standardised mean difference was undertaken using the Campbell Collaboration calculator (https:// camp bell coll abor ation. org/ research-resources/ effectsize-calculator. html). 43 Where it was not possible to pool outcome data because of methodological and clinical heterogeneity, the data from studies are shown as forest plots but without metaanalysis. The forest plots contain results from the studies where sufficient data were given to calculate either the RR or standardised mean difference. A number of studies provided data on those under contact precautions, but no comparative data and so were not included. [44] [45] [46] [47] Because of the large number of non-psychological outcomes for which RR could be calculated, it was decided that a change of 20% (ie, an RR of 0.8 or less, or 1.2 or more) would be clinically significant, regardless of the statistical significance. This was a pragmatic decision, and all results are shown in online supplementary file 4. The results are shown in figures 1-6. Online supplementary file 5 contains the results that did not meet our criteria for being clinically significant. Outcomes were classified into one of three categories: those to do with quality of care; satisfaction of care; and adverse events from which median values and interquartile ranges were calculated. The studies included were primarily single-centre and consisted of case-control, cross-sectional and cohort studies. The risk of bias was assessed by using the Newcastle-Ottowa scale, full details of each study and its risk of bias are in the online supplementary file 6. 48 Overall, although these studies have limited generalisability, there did not appear to be significant cause for concern regarding bias within the limitations inherent in these 22 26 28 31 32 The data from the comparative studies suggest that although in many cases infective isolation precautions make little difference to psychological outcomes, where it does make a difference this is primarily negative. There were significant declines in mean scores related to control and self-esteem, and in many studies increases in the mean scores for risk of anxiety and depression. However, these findings were not consistent, and some larger studies showed little or no difference between the groups for these outcomes. These are shown in figures 1 and 2, respectively. For the eight studies reporting data on anxiety, the pooled SMD was 1.45 (95% CI 0.56 to 2.34); although within this there was significant heterogeneity (Q=168.11, df=7, p<0.0001; I 2 =95.84%). This was primarily caused by two studies 30 34 that showed lower levels of anxiety than the remaining studies. For depression, the SMD was 1.28 (95% CI 0.47 to 2.09); again with significant heterogeneity (Q=154.5, df=7, p<0.0001; I 2 =95.47%), in this case the studies falling into two categories, those with lower 30 34 35 and with higher depression scores among those isolated. 19 20 33 36 The forest plots for these outcomes are shown in figures 3 and 4, respectively. Studies not reporting the raw data showed that contact precautions were associated with depression OR 1.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.5) but not anxiety OR 0.8 (95% CI 0.7 to 1.1) in the non-ICU population. 41 There was also an association with delirium OR 1.40 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.51); although this was primarily among those who were newly diagnosed as needing isolation OR 1.75 (95% CI 1.60 to 1.92, p<0.01) rather than those who had been under contact precautions for their entire stay OR 0.97 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.09, p=0.60). 17 Another study showed no difference in the median values for the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety or depression scores, or the EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale scores. 42 For non-psychological outcomes, using a difference in the risk of Â±20% of an event as being a measure of clinical significance it appears there was a trend for less attention to be given to, and for more errors to occur in those who were isolated. However, again there was a wide variation between studies. Data on these outcomes are given in figures 5 and 6, and the non-clinically significant risks in the online supplementary file 5. For those outcomes A study not giving raw data which looked at the rates of falls and pressure ulcers before and after a policy change that resulted in the discontinuation of contact precautions for patients with MRSA or vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) found that falls and pressure ulcers were more common among those with MRSA or VRE both before the change (when they were in isolation) and afterwards (when they were not). Before the change, the number of falls was 4.57 vs 2.04 per 1000 patient-days respectively (p<0.0001) and pressure ulcers 4.87 vs 1.22 per 1000 patient-days (p<0.0001). After the policy change, the same numbers were falls 4.82 vs 2.10 (p<0.0001) and pressure ulcers 4.17 vs 1.19 per 1000 patient-days (p<0.0001). 39 Other studies found that staff spent less time with those on contact precautions: internal medicine interns spent less time with their isolated patients compared with non-isolated patients, the median times being 5.2 and 6.9 min, respectively (p<0.001) 38 ; while the mean number of contacts per hour with healthcare workers was 2.1 compared with 4.2 in those not isolated (p=0.03), although the duration was longer at 4.5 min compared with 2.8 (p=0.6). 40 DISCuSSIOn Current recommendations say that contact precautions should include a single room, with personal protective equipment consisting of a gown and gloves for all patient Open access contacts or contacts with potentially contaminated environmental areas. 1 This review has shown that there are a number of apparently negative aspects to contact precautions, in particular with regard to psychological effects and a reduction in the quality of some aspects of care. These data come from studies carried out in a variety of countries and different types of facilities; although there are few data from particularly vulnerable populations such as the elderly. Although at times there are discussions as to the necessity of contact precautions for drug-resistant organisms, with some arguing that there is mixed evidence for or against their use 49 another recent review has concluded that they are of great importance in the control of epidemic and endemic multidrug-resistant microorganisms. 50 The ethics of using contact precautions and other forms of isolation rely on a positive assessment of the balance between the risks and benefits of this to the individual concerned and that of the broader population of patients and staff. 51 However, even when this assessment is positive, it is important to ensure that any harm to the individual is minimised. One way of balancing the various priorities is to use the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment,Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group (GRADE) Evidence to Decision Framework, which provides criteria for making recommendations at the individual, group and policy levels, and provides a number of highly patient focused criteria for doing this. In addition to the certainty of evidence and resource requirements, it also requires consideration of: the balance of desirable and undesirable effects; the impact on equity; and the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. 52 The last two of these might have very different outcomes when considered at the population and individual levels; and there is certainly evidence here that for the individual patient the balance of desirable and undesirable effects might be very different to that of the broader population. However, within the broad population of infected or potentially infected patients, some groups might have different needs. For example a study of people isolated for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) found that while access to telephones reduced anxiety and anger; access to email, text and internet increased these. 53 This was not an area investigated in any depth in these studies. Another area where information may be lacking is that of age, as older people in particular might feel sadness and loneliness more; and gender, as qualitative data suggest that women in isolation were more concerned about precautions and transmission while men were more resigned, rational and tended to cope better. 54 In some countries, such as the USA, single rooms have become the standard for new hospitals and so one might expect fewer adverse effects if everyone is in a single room, this being the norm. However, it may be that a single room is necessary but not sufficient for these findings, and that it is the combination of a single room with an infection that leads to these results. Certainly it is far from clear that the long list of advantages claimed for single rooms which include reduced stress, the ability to deliver better care, and a lower probability of dietary or medication errors apply to this group of patients. 55 Caring for patients in single rooms does have many challenges, but there is evidence that these can be mitigated in a general population 9 ; however, the expanding literature on how this can be done in a general population does not necessarily apply here due to the necessity of isolation procedures which are, by design, 'a barrier'. Therefore, patients' needs for greater social interaction will need a solution quite different from that which might be used for a different patient population, and the benefit of choice about this which single rooms offer does not apply here. 56 Although this review has quantified the extent of the problem, we have not been able to find solutions in the literature. Care might be improved through increased staff attention with more resources being allocated to these patients, although the extra cost of contact precautions is already considerable, one estimate being that it was an extra US$158.90 (95% CI US$124.90 to US$192.80) per patient day. 57 Alternatively new ways of working might be developed, perhaps using technology to mitigate some of these problems. Technology might be particularly useful in reducing adverse events such as medication or clinical errors; although increasing satisfaction and some areas of quality are more likely to be achieved by increasing the availability of staff and other people. The extent to which scarce resources are allocated to this may be driven in part by the longevity of any negative effects; which current literature is not really able to clarify. To understand this, longituduinal studies are needed.
