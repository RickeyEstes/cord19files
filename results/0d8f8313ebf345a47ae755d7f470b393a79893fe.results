The ORF6 protein exerts an effect on the expression of transgenes from co-transfected expression constructs To determine amount of ORF6 required to exert an effect on the expression of transgenes from co-transfected expression constructs, Vero E6 cells were transfected with 1 μg of pXJmyc-nsp8 alone or with either 1 μg, 2 μg or 3 μg of pXJ3'-ORF6 plasmid. Western blotting showed a dose-dependent reduction in the expression of nsp8, concomitant with an increase in the expression of ORF6 ( Figure 1A ). In order to determine the specificity of this effect, Vero E6 cells were cotransfected with another mammalian expression construct pXJflag-GST and pXJ3'-ORF6 in the same manner as previously done with the construct encoding for nsp8. When titrated against increasing amounts of ORF6 protein, the flag-tagged GST protein was also observed by Western Blotting to show reduced levels of expression in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1B) . Thus, it seems that ORF6 exerts an effect on the expression of transgenes from co-transfected expression constructs regardless of the nature of the transgenes. However, when increasing amounts of GST were titrated against nsp8 in the same manner, no significant reduction in nsp8 expression was observed, indicating that this effect was specific to the ORF6 protein ( Figure 1C ).
