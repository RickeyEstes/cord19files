Identification of a human nAb against the preS1 domain of the HBV L protein and structural analysis of the antigen-antibody complex To identify nAbs that block viral infection, we used preS1 peptides derived from the preS1 domain of the HBV L protein (Figure 1-figure supplement 1 ) as targets to select against a large nonimmune phage display antibody library. By employing HepG2-hNTCP cell-based in vitro HBV infection systems , we identified six nAbs that were effective in neutralizaling HBV, but each differed in its potency ( Figure 1A) . Epitope mapping by direct binding and competition ELISA assays showed that these nAbs recognized four unique epitopes, represented by #71, 2H5, m1Q (mge) in the presence of the tested Abs. The secreted HBeAg and HBsAg levels in sample supernatants were measured at 7 days post infection (dpi). The HBV neutralization activity is here presented as the percentage of inhibition of secreted HBeAg and HBsAg, which was calculated by normalizing the 'infection only' reading to 0% inhibition. (B) Neutralization of HDV infection in HepG2-hNTCP cells by 2H5 and m1Q. The cells were infected with 500 mge of HDV in the presence of the test nAbs or matched isotype control Ab. At dpi 7, HDV delta antigens were stained with FITC-conjugated mAb, 4G5; the cell nuclei were stained with DAPI.

Human NTCP-Tg homozygotes (C57BL/6 background) were IP administered 2H5 (20 mg/kg; n = 5) or PBS control (n = 2) at 8 days after birth. One hour later, each mouse was challenged with 1.47 Â 10 10 genome equivalents (GE) of HDV. The mice were sacrificed at dpi 6. HDV total RNA titers (on the left Y-axis) and hNTCP transgene expression (on the right Y-axis) in liver tissues were measured by qPCR. The horizontal dotted line indicates the reliable Figure 1 continued on next page and #15, respectively (Figure 1-figure supplements 1 and 2A-C). The neutralization potency of these nAbs correlated with the location of their epitopes in relation to the receptor binding site (RBS) in preS1. The epitopes of 2H5 and m1Q are more closer to the C-terminus of RBS, and showed more potent neutralization activity compared to the other two nAbs, including #71, with its epitope close to the N-terminus of RBS that only recognizes non-myristoylated preS1 peptides, and #15, with its epitope distant from the C-terminus of RBS, although all four of these nAbs had similar preS1 binding activity. 2H5 and m1Q were also able to neutralize HDV infection in HepG2-hNTCP cells ( Figure 1B ). As 2H5 was slightly more potent in neutralizing HBV and HDV than m1Q, we selected 2H5 for further characterization and optimization. To better understand the structural basis of 2H5-preS1 binding, we solved the crystal structure of 2H5 (in scFv form (single-chain fragment of variable domain): VH-linker-VL) in complex with a preS1 peptide ('59C') corresponding to residues (À10~48) of pre-S1 (genotype C) (Figure 1-figure supplement 1). The 2H5 scFv and the 59C peptide were co-expressed in E. Coli and were then co-purified and co-crystallized. The complex structure was determined by molecular replacement and refined at 2.5 Å resolution to an R-factor of 0.23 and an R-free value of 0.28 (Table 1 ). In the complex structure, residues 20-27 of the 59C peptide showing well-ordered electron density were modeled. The 8-residue peptide adopts a U-shaped conformation and is situated in a pocket formed by five complementarity-determining-region (CDR) loops from both the variable heavy (VH) and light chains (VL) of 2H5 ( Figure 1C -E). The interface between 2H5 scFv and the preS1 peptide buries a solvent accessible area of about 460.8 Å 2 , accounting for 54.6% of the total peptide surface area. The heavy chain and light chain of 2H5 contribute 236.3 Å 2 and 224.5 Å 2 of the buried surface area respectively. Five CDR loops (HCDR1-3, LCDR1, and LCDR3) are involved in direct binding to the 59C peptide. The 2H5-preS1 interaction interface includes contributions from all types of non-covalent interactions ( Figure 1D and Table 2 ). All of the eight modeled residues except Gly 24 of preS1 interact directly with 2H5. On the buried surface of preS1, which is mainly involved in heavy chain interaction, the Asp 20 residue has an electrostatic interaction with Arg 55 in the HCDR2 loop. Additionally, Arg 59 of the HCDR2 loop forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Ala 22 from preS1. Phe 23 in preS1, which has a large hydrophobic benzyl group, inserts deep into a hydrophobic pocket that is formed by Ala 38 , Arg 55 , Tyr 57 and the backbone atoms of HCDR3. Phe 23 alone contributes to 23.5% of the buried surface area of the preS1 peptide. Ala 22 and Ala 25 in preS1 form weak hydrophobic interactions with, respectively, Tyr 57 of HCDR1 and Met 109 of HCDR3. On the exposed surface of preS1, which primarily contacts the light chain, Pro 21 forms hydrophobic interactions with Tyr 37 of LCDR1 and Tyr 107 of LCDR3. Additionally, Asn 26 and Ser 27 make several van der Waals contacts with both Tyr 37 and Tyr 38 of LCDR1. We next verified the key binding residues deduced from the crystal structure of the complex. A wild-type synthesized 16-mer preS1 peptide could efficiently compete with the full-length preS1 peptide for binding to 2H5. However, three 16-mer variants of the preS1 peptide that had a key residue (Asp 20 , Pro 21 , or Phe 23 ) mutated to alanine failed to compete the full-length preS1 peptide for binding to 2H5 (Figure 1-figure supplement 2D) . Further, alanine substitution of preS1 Leu 19 , which is immediately adjacent to the 8-residue region of the 59C peptide, also reduced binding competition activity, indicating that this residue is involved in preS1-2H5 binding. Of note, sequence alignment showed that 2H5 epitope is highly conserved among HBV genotypes (Figure 1-figure Figure 1 continued detection limit. The copy numbers shown in the Y-axes are from 20 ng of total liver RNA for each sample. Each square represents one mouse; squares of the same color indicate data from the same mouse.

DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26738.004 supplement 1), indicating that 2H5 can potentially provide broad protection against the vast majority of HBV genotypes. Although residue 24 in the 2H5 epitope is variable among different HBV genotypes (e.g., Gly 24 in genotypes A and C; Lys 24 or Arg 24 in all other genotypes, Figure 1 -figure supplement 1), G24R mutation of the preS1 peptide had no effect on binding to 2H5 (Figure 1figure supplement 2E), consistent with our observation from the complex structure that Gly 24 does not make direct contact with 2H5. Generation of a more potent nAb, 2H5-A14 To evaluate the neutralization activity of 2H5 in vivo, we employed a de novo HDV infection mouse model that we recently established (He et al., 2015) in which the transgenic expression of human NTCP (hNTCP-Tg) in C57BL/6 mouse liver supports acute HDV infection mediated by HBV envelope proteins. Using this model, prophylactic administration of 2H5 IgG1 (1 hr before HDV viral challenge) resulted in a more than one log reduction of the viral titer in mouse livers as compared to untreated controls ( Figure 1F ). Nevertheless, 2H5 treatment was not able to completely block HDV infection in mouse livers, even at a 20 mg/kg dose. Thus, increasing the neutralization activity of 2H5 while preserving its conserved epitope were needed to yield a potent and broadly-neutralizing antibody with improved in vivo efficacy. To this end, we employed various antibody engineering approaches including chain shuffling, structure-guided design, and CDR-focused mutagenesis. The VH chain shuffling approach was most fruitful in identifying improved anti-preS1 nAbs. VH chain shuffling by fixing the variable light (VL) chain of 2H5 and pairing it with a repertoire of naturally-occurring variable heavy (VH) genes (~1Â10 10 ) led to the identification of 16 Abs with higher binding affinity. HBV and HDV neutralizing assays were then performed to rank the neutralizing ability of these 16 Abs relative to that of 2H5 ( 2H5-A14 is a potent and broadly-neutralizing nAb against HBV infection that acts by blocking the binding of preS1 with the HBV receptor NTCP Competition ELISA assays showed that 2H5-A14 had almost the same peptide competition pattern as did 2H5, and mutation of G24R of preS1 did not affect 2H5-A14 binding activity, indicating that 2H5-A14 targets the same epitope as does 2H5 (Figure 2-figure supplement 4) . This epitope is in close proximity to, but does not overlap, the receptor NTCP-binding site of preS1 (Figure 1-figure supplement 1). To test whether the neutralization activity of 2H5-A14 can be attributed to competition with preS1 for binding with NTCP, we used a stable HepG2-hNTCP cell clone that expresses a high level of hNTCP and supports the binding of a fluorescent-labeled preS1 peptide. An immunofluorescence staining assay showed that 2H5-A14 inhibited the binding of FITC-labeled preS1 to HepG2-hNTCP cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas an isotype-matched control Ab did not ( Figure 2A ). This result indicates that the neutralization mechanism of 2H5-A14 likely involves blocking of viral entry by interfering with the binding of NTCP and preS1, probably owing to steric hindrance at or near the preS1 receptor binding site. We next examined the potency and breadth of 2H5-A14 in neutralizing HBV and HDV. HBV has 10 known genotypes, all of which differ from each other by at least 8% at DNA sequence level (Sunbul, 2014) . Genotypes B, C, and D represent the major epidemic genotypes, and 2H5-A14 potently neutralized all three of these genotypes ( Figure 2B ). We also compared the potency of 2H5-A14 to other agents known to block HBV entry, including commercial HBIG (Hepatitis B Immune Globulin), KR127 (a humanized preS1 mouse mAb [Chi et al., 2007] ), and two prototype peptides of Myrcludex-B (Bogomolov et al., 2016) (an NTCP-binding preS1-derived synthetic myristoylated lipopeptide): m47-D (genotype D) and m47 (genotype C). Assays using a HepG2-hNTCP cell-based HBV infection system showed that 2H5-A14 had more than 1000-fold stronger neutralization activity than did HBIG against infection with recombinant HBV ( Figure 2C ) and HDV ( Figure 2D ), as well as against infection with six HBV primary isolates derived from HBV-infected patients (genotype C) ( HBV than did KR127, and 50-fold stronger anti-HBV activity than did either m47-D or m47 ( Figure 2C ). Consistently, in a primary human hepatocyte (PHHs) infection system, 2H5-A14 showed similar neutralization potency against a clinical viral isolate from an HBV-infected patient (genotype B) ( Figure 2E ). We examined variations in the epitope-forming amino acid sequences among HBV genotypes to assess the breadth of the neutralization activity of 2H5-A14 against HBV. In addition to the aforementioned variability at position 24 of preS1, position 22 also exhibited heterogeneity; genotypes F and H had leucine at this position while all other genotypes had alanine (Figure 1-figure supplement 1). Analysis using the HBVdb database revealed that this leucine mutation is present at a very low frequency (about 3.75%) among all reported HBV sequences (total 7407 sequences) (Hayer et al., 2013) , and is almost completely limited to genotypes F and H (Figure 2-figure supplement 5B). ELISA binding assays showed that 2H5-A14 bound weakly to a preS1 peptide variant containing the epitope-forming sequnces of both the F and H genotypes of HBV (Figure 2-figure supplement 5C), suggesting that 2H5-A14 likely has limited efficacy against these rare genotypes. Even so, our sequence analysis showed that the epitope 2H5-A14 is highly conserved and our neutralization assay results clearly showed that 2H5-A14 neutralizes the three major epidemic genotypes of HBV with remarkable potency. Given this, it is reasonable to extrapolate that 2H5-A14 can likely neutralize the vast majority (>95%) of HBV virus strains.
