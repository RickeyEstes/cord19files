Thirty-five patients with chronic P. aeruginosa airway infection were enrolled and were followed for an average of 533 ± 102 days. Twenty-two of these patients had a total of 30 exacerbations during the study period; with a maximum of 2 exacerbations per patient. The mean time from the most recent stable visit until exacerbation was 82 ± 65 days, and from exacerbation to post-exacerbation assessment was 115 ± 70 days. Patient demographic information can be found in Table 1 . Signs and symptoms present during the exacerbations, and differences between virus and non-virus associated exacerbations are shown in Fig. 1 . All patients fulfilled criteria for a CF exacerbation. At the time of exacerbation three (10%) patients required hospitalization and were treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics. An additional 5 (17%) patients were treated with IV antibiotics at home, 19 (63%) were treated with oral antibiotics and 3 (10%) did not require treatment. Three exacerbations were excluded from the quantitative bacterial sputum density calculations; two patients did not grow P. aeruginosa at the time of exacerbation, and one sample had insufficient volume. Fig. 2 illustrates the change in P. aeruginosa bacterial density in sputum collected during stable, pulmonary exacerbation, and post-exacerbation assessments via quantitative culture. There was no significant change in colony counts from stable state to exacerbation; the mean within-patient difference was 0.014 log 10 CFU/ml (95% CI − 0.51 to 0.53, p = 0.95). There was similarly no significant change in P. aeruginosa sputum density from steady state to exacerbation as measured by PCR. The mean change in Ct was − 0.31 cycles (95% CI − 1.35 to 0.73, p = 0.56) where a negative value indicates a higher bacterial density in the exacerbation sample than in the stable sample. There was no significant change in bacterial density from exacerbation to post-exacerbation state. The mean within patient change in sputum density from exacerbation to the post-exacerbation visit was 0.20 log 10 CFU/ml (95% CI − 0.47 to 0.86) (p = 0.57). Seven patients did not return for postexacerbation assessments and were excluded from this analysis. Statistical analysis comparing changes in sputum bacterial density by quantitative culture against changes in nucleic acid detection by quantitative PCR showed a moderate correlation (Pearson Correlation Coefficient 0.38, p = 0.048). Thirty exacerbations had paired sputum taken at baseline and at the time of exacerbation for analysis of viral infection. At baseline, we could only detect viral DNA/RNA by RT-qPCR in the sputum from one stable state sputum sample (coronavirus HKU1). In contrast at the time of exacerbation, respiratory viruses were detected in the sputum or NP swab from 15 of the 30 exacerbation samples. The viruses detected were rhinovirus (67%), RSV type A (13%), PIV type 3 (7%), corona HKU1 (7%) and corona NL63 (7%). Three viruses were detected in an NP swab only, 6 in the sputum only and 6 were detected in both the NP swab and sputum. The patient who was found to have Subgroup analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the change in P. aeruginosa sputum density between viral and non-viral exacerbations when measured by quantitative culture and PCR (Figs. 3 and 4) . By quantitative culture, the difference in the average change in colony counts of P. aeruginosa was 0.59 log 10 CFU/ml (95% CI − 0.51 to 1.68; p = 0.27) between the viral and non-viral groups. By PCR Ct value comparison, the mean between-group difference was 1.15 cycles (95% CI − 1.03 to 3.38; p = 0.33).
