Interestingly, NoV#3263 and Norwalk virus hybridized strongly to the same array element derived from norogroup I strain sequence with GenBank accession #L07418. With noro#1 viral RNA, multiple hybridization bands belonging to NoV genogroup I (GI) are shown (Fig. 1D) . Multiple sequences of only norovirus genogroup I could be identified and none of them had any identity to those obtained with #3263 or Norwalk virus suggesting this strain (NoV #1) shares partial sequence identity with several other norogroup Fig. (2) . Analysis of sequence variation in HAV VP1/2A region. (A) Comparative hybridization profile of HM175/wt and HAS15 in relation to HM175/18f in VP1/2A region. Microarrays were hybridized to viral RNA isolated from the reference strain HM175/18f and test strain of HM175/wt and HAS15, respectively. The hybridization signal from each oligoprobe in that region within the reference strain was divided by the respective signal in the test virus. The signal ratio obtained from reference and test strain is shown with respect to genome position of 18f. The x axis is nucleotide position numbering of 18f. The y axis is the ratio measurement obtained. Hybridization peak indicates nucleotide changes present in the test strains. (B) Sequence alignment of VP1/2A region from the three strains. Black dot shows the nucleotide changes in HAS15 compared to 18f. Down arrow indicates the nucleotide changes present in HM175/wt. B. I strains. In addition, strong hybridization to genogroup IIspecific probes derived from Saitama U17 strain with accession #AB039779 was identified in NoV#186. The phylogenetic tree of the PCR product by genogroup IIspecific primers indicated that NoV#186 amplified by G2SKF and G2SKR was clearly grouped into GII (Fig. 4C) in which it showed highest sequence similarity to Saitama U17 strain. This phylogenetic relationship is also reflected by the microarray hybridization pattern. We have also examined whether individual virus strains can be identified by the tiling array, when multiple viruses are present in the same sample (Fig. 1E) . The ability of the microarray to accurately predict the genotypes of several different viruses led us to evaluate if the microarray can detect multiple unrelated viruses in the same experiment. We examined CXKV B3, HAV HM-175/18f and NoV #3263 RNAs as a mixture of labeled cDNA targets derived from their respective viruses hybridized to a single microarray. As shown in Fig. (1E) , the presence of CXKV B3 target and NoV#3263 can be readily identified by their strong hybridization to the set of oligoprobes derived from their individual genera sequence of CXKVB3 and L07418, respectively. Strong hybridization of HAV HM-175/18f target to the genotype IB probes is also observed in Fig.  (1E) , although some cross-hybridization to its close relative genotype IA oligoprobes also occurred, due to their high sequence similarity, albeit with a much lower signal intensities. Hybridization of an oligonucleotide to target sequence is disrupted by a mismatch; decrease in hybridization in a Figs. (2, 3) , hybridization signal intensities of tiling probes matching the sequence of reference strain HM175 18f were compared. The ratios of hybridizations of the reference strain HM175 18f (perfect matches) to two test strains (HM175 wt and HAS15) were plotted. Peaks indicate decreased hybridization of the test strains due to nucleotide changes. The corresponding sequence alignment shown (Figs. 2B, 3B) validates the peaks of maximum destabilization by identifying the nucleotide changes in HAS 15. In contrast, comparison of HM175 and 18f, which differ by only 28 nucleotides over their entire 7.4 kb genome, show only three areas of nucleotide changes (red line) within the VP1/2A junction. In Fig. (4A, B) , we show that the analysis can be expanded over thousands of nucleotides of multiple viral genomes, where the first 3700 nucleotides of each virus strain were interrogated. Unlike in Figs. (2, 3) , where the ratio of hybridization of each 25mer oligonucleotide probe of a reference strain to a test strain was plotted to detect the location of a mutation, in Fig. (4A,  B) , the average signal value of all oligonucleotide probes from a virus strain was plotted against the position of that probe in the array, creating a unique profile for that virus (HAS 15 or PA21) to all other HAV strains we tested (data not shown). The results clearly show that signal strength was highest with multiple peaks in the region where HAV probes are positioned. There was no other area over the entire surface of the array where the target from any HAV strain produced a meaningful signal. This analysis was carried out with all HAV and CXKV strains listed in Table 1 (Supplement) and some norovirus (Fig.1D, E) .
