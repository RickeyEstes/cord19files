During the pandemic year, a total of 3836 out of 7350 respiratory specimens with ILI coming from the sentinel physicians network were positive for influenza A(H1N1) pdm (95%). In 2010-2011 season, 146 out of 894 of the cases were positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (70%). Here we report the occurrence of an amino acid substitution, aspartic acid to glycine in position 222 (D222G) in the HA subunit of the viral haemagglutinin, in clinical specimens from 3 out of 42 cases analyzed in Tunisia with severe outcome (7%). Interestingly, in one fatal case out of four viruses taken from fatal cases studied (25%). This patient died after 3 days, suffering of severe respiratory symptoms of flu. Autopsy revealed pulmonary oedema, large mucosis secretions but no cardiac inflammation (Table 1) . Also this mutation was found in one mild case out of 8 mild cases studied (0.1%). Moreover, D222E was found in one out of 50 viruses studied. This mutation was found in virus taken from one patient with severe clinical syndrome out of 42 severe cases studied (2%). E374K substitution was found in two severe cases (4%). This analysis of HA also showed frequent substitutions in other positions. P83S and S203T were detected in 94% of Tunisian viruses studied.
