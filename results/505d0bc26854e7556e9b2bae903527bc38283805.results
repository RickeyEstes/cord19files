During the 13-month study period, 100 (70%) of 143 eligible infants were enrolled; 86 infants were in the PMH NICU (93% of 92 eligible infants) and 14 were at WIH (27% of 51 eligible infants). The mothers/legal guardians of 42 (5, PMH; 37, WIH) infants declined enrollment in the study, and 1 infant was missed at PMH. An additional infant died before consent could be obtained. Most mothers were Hispanic and delivered their infants via cesarean delivery ( Table I) ; 4 (4%) mothers at PMH were infected with HIV, but the infants were uninfected. None had intrapartum fever or symptoms suggestive of a viral infection at delivery. The infants were mostly male, preterm (81% <37 weeks' gestation; 71% <34 weeks' gestation), and of low birth weight (66% <2000 g birth weight; 56% <1500 g; 29% <1000 g; Table I ). The onset of clinical signs of infection, or the chronologic age when evaluated for late-onset sepsis, occurred at a median age of 11.5 days, and the median duration of hospitalization was 66 days. The 100 infants received 135 evaluations with initiation of antimicrobial therapy for possible sepsis; 21 of them had 2 sepsis evaluations, 10 had 3, and 4 had 4 performed. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected at all of the 135 sepsis evaluations. Eight (8%) of the 100 infants, or 8 (6%) of the 135 sepsis evaluations, had a respiratory virus detected from the nasopharyngeal swab that included 6 (7%) of the 86 infants at PMH and 2 (14%) of the 14 infants at WIH ( Table II) . All of the respiratory viruses were detected at the time of the first sepsis evaluation. None of the 8 patients whose nasopharyngeal swab detected a respiratory virus at the first evaluation received another sepsis evaluation and, therefore, none was retested. The respiratory viruses detected were enterovirus/rhinovirus (n = 2), rhinovirus (n = 2), coronaviruses (1, HKU-1; 1, OC43), and parainfluenza-3 virus (n = 2). The Luminex xTag Respiratory Viral Panel identified 5 of the 8 positive infants and the GenMark eSensor Respiratory Viral Panel detected 6 of the 8, but only 3 infants (1, rhinovirus/ enterovirus; 2, parainfluenza-3 virus) were detected by both panels ( Table II) . The 8 infants who had a respiratory virus detected at the time of sepsis evaluation had hypothermia (n = 2), tachypnea (n = 6), and apnea (n = 6). Only one had fever and one had cough, with the latter infant as well as another one diagnosed with pneumonia due to parainfluenza-3 virus. Hematochezia occurred in 2 infants with rhinovirus, but neither was diagnosed with necrotizing enterocolitis. Five (5%) infants had sick contacts who had presumed respiratory viral infection. Three of the 5 infants had a respiratory virus detected and a parent, grandparent, or nurse had rhinorrhea, and 2 infants who did not have a respiratory virus detected had a mother or siblings with cough, sore throat, and rhinorrhea. None of the contacts was tested for viral infection. Overall, the main reasons for the sepsis evaluations were respiratory signs (86%, 86/100), mainly tachypnea (77%, 77/100) and chest retractions (57%, 57/100); and gastrointestinal signs (45%, 45/100), principally feeding intolerance (33%, 33/100) and abdominal distension (29%, 29/100) ( Table III) . Compared with infants whose respiratory virus PCR test was negative, infants who had a respiratory virus detected during the sepsis evaluation were more likely to be older (41 vs 11 days, P = .007; 95% CI, 4.4-55.6), exposed to individuals with respiratory viral symptoms (37% vs 2%; P = .003; 95% CI, 0.1-0.7), and had rhinorrhea (25% vs 1%; P = .02; 95% CI, 0.05-0.6) and congestion (25% vs 1%; P = .02; 95% CI, 0.05-0.6) with a lower total neutrophil count (1790 cells/mL vs 4530 cells/mL; P = .02; 95% CI, 906-4573; Table III) . They also were more likely to have been tested for a respiratory virus by their provider (6/8, 75% vs 10/92, 10%; P < .001; 95% CI, 0.3-0.8). However, only 2 of the 8 infants in whom a respiratory virus was detected had a virus identified by provider testing at the birth hospital ( Table II) . The other 10 infants tested by the provider also had negative respiratory viral testing results at the birth hospital ( Table III) . None of the infants in whom a respiratory virus was detected had a bacterial agent isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid. One infant who had coronavirus OC43 detected was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection; urine obtained by suprapubic bladder aspiration yielded 30 000 colony-forming units/mL of coagulase-negative staphylococci, but 2 blood cultures were sterile. On the other hand, 13% (9/71) and 16% (15/92) of infants whose nasopharyngeal swab did not detect any respiratory virus had bacterial infection of the urinary tract or bacterial bloodstream infection, respectively ( Table III) . Nine of the 15 bloodstream infections were central line-associated bloodstream infections. In addition, infants who had a positive respiratory viral PCR test had a median duration of antibiotic use of 6.5 days (IQR 2.2-7.7) vs a median of 3 days (IQR 2-7) in those whose PCR was negative (P = .3; 95% CI, 0.07-7.07; Table III ). There also was no significant difference in incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia between the 2 groups. The covariates with P < .1 on bivariate analyses (Table III) were entered in a logistic regression model to determine which factors most accurately predicted viral infection after adjusting for other confounders; these included gestational age, birth weight, age at sepsis evaluation, absolute total neutrophil count, exposure to individuals with symptoms of upper respiratory infection, and clinical suspicion of viral infection by attending physicians. After we adjusted for confounding, the model's only predictor of viral infection was the caregivers' clinical suspicion of viral infection as indicated by their ordering a viral study independent of the study protocol (P = .006). Exposure to individuals with symptoms of upper respiratory infection was not a significant predictor (P = .07) in this small study.
