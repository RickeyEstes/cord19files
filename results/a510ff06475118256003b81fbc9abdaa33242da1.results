No statistically significant difference between the calves treated with Podophyllum and calves treated with the placebo was demonstrated. Calves treated with Podophyllum (n=24) had an average of 3.1 days' duration of diarrhoea (range 1-8 days), while calves treated with a placebo (n=20) had an average of 2.9 days' duration of diarrhoea (range 1-7 days). The confidence interval for the difference between the groups with regard to mean duration was [-0.6; 1.5]. The percentage of clinical signs in the calves in each group is shown in Fig. 1 . No deaths of calves occurred during the study period. During the diarrhoeic period, 9/24 calves treated with Podophyllum and 3/20 treated with a placebo excreted rotavirus in the faeces. On average, rotavirus-excreting calves were 19.5 days old at the onset of diarrhoea. Adjusting for rotavirus in the statistical analysis did not alter the results. In samples from 2 calves in total, Cryptosporidium parvum and coronavirus were detected.
