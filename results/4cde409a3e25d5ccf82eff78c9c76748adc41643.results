A total of 299 samples (93 NPA and 206 NPS) from 291 patients were analyzed: 149 samples were obtained from 142 children, of whom 62 were female and 80 were male (mean age: 1 years and 10 months old; median: 7 months old); and 150 samples were obtained from 149 adults, of whom 73 were female and 76 were male (mean age: 53 years old; median: 52). For children, 80% (119/149) of samples were positive for at least one pathogen. The pathogen detected, ranging from most to least, was rhino/enteroviruses (49), influenza B (32), influenza A (25), coronaviruses (22), adenovirus (18), metapneumovirus (10), RSV (7) and parainfluenza (2). For adults, 63% (94/150) of samples were positive, and the detected viruses were influenza A (32), influenza B (26), rhino/enteroviruses (13), coronavirus (12), adenovirus (8), metapneumovirus (6) and RSV (4). No parainfluenza viruses were detected in the adult patients. All influenza A isolates were A(H1N1)pdm09 with the exception of one A(H3N2) from one adult patient. Influenza B strains were not subtyped. Co-detection was more common in children than in adults (35.3% vs 8.5%; p < 0.001). Table 1 details the sensitivity and specificity observed for the different techniques, depending on the pathogens. Table 2 provides the rate of false negative results, partial agreement (meaning at least one but not all the expected pathogens were detected) and complete agreement (meaning all the expected pathogens were detected) of the non-molecular techniques and molecular techniques compared to the established standard. The FilmArray test produced fewer false negative results and partial results compared to non-molecular techniques and the Clart Pneumovir test (p < 0.001). False negative results with molecular techniques were significantly more frequent in samples with codetections compared to those with only one pathogen: 12% vs 3% for the FilmArray test (p = 0.034) and 76% vs 11% for the Clart Pneumovir test (p < 0.001). Similar result was also observed for cell cultures when limiting the analysis to culturable viruses (100% Vs 37%; p < 0.001). Table 3 reports the mean turnaround time (TAT) of the techniques from the reception of the sample in the laboratory to the introduction of the results into the laboratory information system. The LFC and Fil-mArray techniques have the shortest TAT, while cell cultures and the Clart Pneumovir test have the longest TAT. The TAT for negative cell cultures is about 3 weeks as they are discarded after this delay. Tables 4 and 5 provide the detection rates for different techniques for influenza A and B, depending on the duration of the cough or the age of the patients. There is an effect of cough duration for influenza A with the antigen detection test (p = 0.032) and cell cultures (p = 0.010), due to a decrease in diagnostic sensitivity with cough duration (p = 0.017 and p = 0.010, respectively). The decrease is observed as soon as the cough duration exceeds 5 days. An age effect was also observed for influenza A with the antigen detection test (p = 0.006) and cell cultures (p = 0.023), due to a decrease in sensitivity with age (p = 0.002 and p = 0.004, respectively). The decrease is observed from the first age category with the antigen detection and from 15 years for the cell cultures. No effect of cough duration or age was observed with the detection of influenza A for the FilmArray and Clart Pneumovir tests or on the detection of influenza B with any method.
