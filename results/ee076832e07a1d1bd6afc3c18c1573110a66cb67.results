3.1. Genetic characterization of feline coronaviruses from feces of healthy shelter cats and from diseased tissues and feces of cats that died from FIP following adoption 3.1.1. Characterization of the 3c gene of coronavirus isolates from FIP diseased tissues (FIPVs) Forty cats originating from the shelter died of FIP following their adoption in 2008, providing a minimal estimate of FIP incidence among adoptees of 40/3000 or 1.3%. Diseased tissues from 35/40 of these cats yielded potentially useable coronavirus RNA. Fecal samples were available from only two of these cats; both tested positive for coronavirus by real time PCR, and one (SFS-05) was used for cat infection studies and the other (SFS-119) was sequenced. Forty five healthy cats present in the shelter from June to December 2009 were sampled and tested for fecal coronavirus shedding and 31/45 (69%) were positive by real time PCR. The E, M, 3a-c genes from 32/35 of the FIP viruses and 27/31 fecal isolates from healthy cats were then successfully sequenced. Nineteen of 32 (59.38%) of the sequenced FIP isolates had functional mutations involving 3c (Fig. 1) . Isolates from cats SFS-20 and -21 were identical, thus yielding 18 unique mutations. All these mutations involved the creation of premature stop codons (10/18) or frame shifts (8/18) causing truncation of the 3c product. Almost all of these mutations were unique to the cat from which it was obtained (Fig. 1) . Four of 19 of these tissue extracts also contained an intact 3c variant 15, 20, and 21) . One of the 19FIP isolates (SFS-11) had a mutation that abolished the stop/start codon at the 3b/3c junction and yielded an extended 3b protein and no 3c product (Fig. 1 ). This isolate also had two deletion mutations in 3c (Fig. 1) . Similar deletion mutations occurring downstream of a premature stop codon were also observed in three other FIPV isolates (SFS-03, 14, and 23). One FIPV isolate (SFS-01) had a premature stop code in 3a, while isolate SFS-18 had a 3-nucleotide deletion in the M gene (Fig. 1) . The remaining 11/32 (34.4%) FIP tissue isolates had intact 3c genes and normal sized transcripts for 3a, b, E, and M.
