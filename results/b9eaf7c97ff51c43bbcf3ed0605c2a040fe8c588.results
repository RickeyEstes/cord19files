STE inhibits EV71 replication. We used a modified plaque assay to screen for anti-enteroviral activity of herbal extract. RD cells were infected with 100 PFU of different EV71 strains such as BrCr, 1743 and 4643, and overlaid with agarose containing 0, 625, or 1250 µg/ml of STE. STE significantly reduced plaque formation by BrCr strain, and completely abrogated plaque formation by 1743 and 4643 strains on RD (Fig. 1a) and Vero cells (Supplementary Fig. S1b ). At these concentrations, the STE did not have cytotoxic effect on RD cells (CC 50 = 3903 μg/ml) ( Supplementary Fig. S1a ) and Vero cells (CC 50 = 2268 μg/ml) ( Supplementary Fig. S1a ). To validate the antiviral effect of STE, we infected RD cells with BrCr strain at m. o. i. of 0.05, and quantified the level of genomic RNA. The level of EV71 RNA decreased by nearly 80% and 85% upon treatment with 625 and 1250 µg/ml STE, respectively (Fig. 1b) . It was paralleled by a dose-dependent decrease in expression of EV71 proteins, including viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (3D pol ) and viral protease (3CD pro ). The expression levels of 3D pol were lowered by 67 and 80% in infected cells in the presence of 625 and 1250 µg/ml STE. Likewise, the expression levels of 3CD pro decreased by 56 and 69% in infected cells treated with 625 and 1250 µg/ml of STE (Fig. 1c) . Reduction in levels of genomic RNA and proteins of EV71 was accompanied by a significant decrease in progeny virus. The amounts of intracellular and extracellular viral particles decreased by more than 2 orders of magnitude in STE-treated infected cells, as compared to those of control treatment group (Fig. 1d) . These findings demonstrate that STE possesses an anti-EV71 activity.
