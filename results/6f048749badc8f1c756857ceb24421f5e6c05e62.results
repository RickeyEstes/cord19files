After consultation with an expert in instrument development, 33 statements listed in Table 1 Of a total 385 health personnel, 271 (70%) persons completed the score sheet. There were no statistically significant differences between responders and non-responders in terms of gender, age, religion, educational level, total period of working, job classification, experience of getting training on influenza pandemic preparedness and perceived levels of knowledge about an influenza pandemic, public health measures against an influenza pandemic and impacts of an influenza pandemic. However, the nonresponders had a lower educational level than those of the responders (35% vs. 18%, respectively). The basic characteristics of the 271 respondents are presented in Table 2 . Q factor analysis gave three factors that met our criteria with the percentages of explained variance being 30.1%, 8.7%, and 5.5%, respectively. After varimax rotation, 90 subjects were classified into factor I (in other words, the first pattern composites of 90 health personnel), 40 into factor II, and 62 into factor III. The other 79 subjects were not classified into any factor because all their loading values were less than 0.45 or had high loading on more than one factor. The composite reliability of each factor was 0.99, with the corresponding standard errors of factor scores being 0.05, 0.08, and 0.06. The correlation coefficients between the three factors were 0.37 (factor I vs. II), 0.54 (factor I vs. III), and 0.55 (factor II vs. III), indicating a moderate similarity among the patterns. The three patterns had scores for each specific statement distributed into the Q-sort model or composite factor array and are displayed in Figures 2, 3 , and 4. The same information is displayed in Table 1 . Factor scores of statement 1 were 2, -1, and -4 as shown in the first row of Table  1 . In the Q-sort model, statement 1 is in column +2 of Figure 2 , and column -1 of Figure 3 , and column -4 of Figure  4 . From Table 1 , statement number 9 has a common factor score of 4 for all three patterns. This indicates that all three patterns of health personnel strongly perceived that multimeasures must be performed during an influenza pandemic. Statement number 12 was also in columns +4 of Figures 3 and 4 , and +3 of Figure 2 , which is related to response efficacy on multilevels of responsibility for preparedness against the threat. In contrast, statement 4 was the most dissenting issue with factor scores of 3, -4, and 0. Health personnel classified as pattern I quite strongly perceived that Thailand will have possibly high impacts from an influenza pandemic if and when one occurs, but those classified in pattern II strongly disagreed, and those in the remaining group were neutral. The right extremes of all three Q-sort models are consistently filled with three black cells (statements 2, 9, and 12) out of 5 cells of that region. This indicates that all three Pattern II. optimistic with perceived low severity and low vul-nerability Figure 3 Pattern II. optimistic with perceived low severity and low vulnerability. Pattern III. mixed with perceived low self-efficacy but low vulnerability Figure 4 Pattern III. mixed with perceived low self-efficacy but low vulnerability. Means of factor scores for each component of the PMT are displayed in Table 3 . All groups had positive perceived response efficacy of the measures. Patterns I and III, however, perceived low self-efficacy, in contrast to high perceived self-efficacy of pattern II. Optimistic personality of pattern II was also expressed as perception of low severity and low vulnerability where the pattern I has isolated neutral perception of severity with a moderate level of perceived vulnerability. Finally, more mixed appraisal is found in pattern III, the group who perceived a low level of vulnerability but a very high level of severity.
