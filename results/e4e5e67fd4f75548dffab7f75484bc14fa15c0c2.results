Mapping P3 PA mutational neighborhood We found that PA host range mutational neighborhood is highly genotype-dependent. Fifty host range mutant plaques were isolated for each of the three genotypes (phi6-WT, phi6-E8G and phi6-G515S; Table 1 ) and their p3 genes for the phi6 attachment protein were Sanger sequenced. We only sequenced the p3 gene because P3 is the only highly accessible protein on the outside of the virion (33) and the only protein associated with phi6 host range in all previous studies (5, 23, 24) . Thirty-five out of the fifty sequenced phi6-WT p3 sequences had single nonsynonymous mutations (seven unique mutations identified), two had double mutations, and thirteen had no detectable mutations on p3 gene. Forty-eight of the fifty phi6-E8G host range mutants contained one of the two single mutations present in the phi6-WT clones (A133V, S299W), the remaining two clones had double mutations: A133V and an additional nonsynonymous mutation. All 50 phi6-G515S host range mutants had the A133V mutation; 43 as a single mutation, five as double mutants and two as triple mutants. The nonsynonymous mutation A133V was the most frequent in the three tested populations: 24% in phi6-WT isolates, 96% in phi6-E8G isolates, and 100% in phi6-G515S isolates, making this the most prevalent mutation conferring infection of PA. In addition, there was a noticeable drop in diversity of single host range mutations from the phi6-WT population compared to the phi6-E8G and phi6-G515S populations, consistent with epistatic constraint on mutational neighborhood by host range mutations. We have summarized these P3 host range mutational neighborhoods on PA in a two-dimensional schematic ( Figure 1 ). Several published works have investigated the mutational neighborhoods of phi6 p3 during expansion of host range (Table 2) . Two sites were favored by host range expansion events onto P. pseudoalcaligenes and P.syringae pv glyclinea: the 8 th and 554 th amino acid of attachment protein P3 (66/81 and 18/39 of isolated mutants, respectively, (5, 24) ). However, the PA mutational neighborhood does not include these frequent sites of mutation to other hosts. There is some overlap with previous studies, for instance N146S (5) and A133V (23), but this suggests that phi6 may interact differently with host PA during attachment than with other Pseudomonas species or P. syringae pathovars. The absence of host range mutations in p3 for thirteen of the phi6-WT PA isolates was unexpected, since 97% of previously independently isolated host range mutants had nonsynonymous mutations in p3, with no other sites in the phi6 genome identified as causing the expanded host range in the remaining 4/118 (5, 23, 24) . This motivated a more in-depth approach: deep sequencing to map the entire mutational neighborhood. Deep sequencing of phi6 populations Each phi6 population was raised to high titer on its most recent host (phi6-WT on PP and phi6-E8G, phi6-G515S both on PT) and plated on PA to obtain a lysate made of ~400 host range mutant plaques. All population lysates from before and after PA host range expansion were sequenced. Change in Shannon entropy was calculated to determine the sites that became more or less variable after overnight growth on PA. The signals of increased variation in the p3 gene matched Sanger sequencing results; all single mutations identified in the three genotypes underwent noticeable entropy change after gaining PA host range ( Figure 2 ). We also found several sites in P3 that may have evaded detection by clonal sampling; including amino acid 247 of phi6-WT and amino acid 35 of phi6-G515S. Deep sequencing also revealed sites of high entropy change in other genes in phi6-WT that could be additional genes controlling host range, and suggesting targets for sequencing in the phi6-WT clones that did not contain p3 mutations (Figure 3, 4) . Our results suggested that non-structural protein genes p12 (encoding the morphogenic protein) and p9 (encoding the major membrane protein) were the most probable sites of additional host range mutations; both genes are involved with viral nucleocapsid vesiculation of the host inner membrane (34, 35) . Results from deep sequencing the p3 gene and from the entire genome further confirmed the constrained neighborhood of host range mutants phi6-E8G and phi6-G515S revealing fewer possibilities for PA mutations in p3, and none elsewhere in the genome. Non-p3 phi6-WT mutant sequencing We amplified and Sanger sequenced the Small segment of all phi6-WT isolates that did not show mutation in p3 ( Table 3 ). Ten of the thirteen isolates contained a single nonsynonymous mutation in p12. One contained a single nonsynonymous mutation in p9, another contained a nonsynonymous mutation in p5. The final mutant had a single synonymous mutation in p9. This clone was then fully Sanger sequenced, but no nonsynonymous mutations were identified. These results matched many of the sites with the highest change in Shannon entropy we observed on the Small segment of deep sequenced phi6-WT populations, and strongly suggest that mutations in these non-structural genes can affect phi6 host range. SNPs of host range expanded phi6 populations In addition to the sites of highest entropy change, we called SNPs present in the deep sequenced pairs of populations. The counts and details of unique synonymous and nonsynonymous SNPs are summarized in Table 4 and Table S1 -S6 in the supplemental material. An increase in detectable polymorphism was observed for phi6-E8G (paired t-test p= 0.001) after host shifting on to PA, but no significant change in SNP numbers was observed for phi6-WT and phi6-G515S (paired t-test p= 0.38, 0.40). The numbers of SNPs detected in the phi6-E8G population grown on PA were also significantly higher than that for the phi6-WT and phi6-G515S populations grown on PA (paired t-test p= 0.03, 0.0001 respectively). Gene p2 on the Large segment, coding for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, appears to maintain a constant, high level of diversity. The surprisingly large number of low-frequency SNPs for phi6-WT raised on PP demonstrated the potential of a dsRNA virus with a 13Kb length genome that grows ~5 generations in overnight plaque growth to generate substantial genetic diversity. This may also be the reason phi6-WT is more able to readily infect PA with a high PA host range mutation frequency ( Figure 5 ). Relative fitness of naturally occurring phi6 PA host range mutants A single mutation (A133V) was shared across the three genotypes, which prompted us to look at its fitness effects in the three genetic backgrounds. We used paired growth assays to measure the relative fitness of host range mutants on their shared, original host PP. Phi6-WT, the ancestor of all the tested strains, was the common competitor for all mutant genotypes and therefore has the relative fitness of 1 ( Figure 6 ). Relative fitness was not affected when phi6-WT obtained A133V mutation on p3 (two-tailed one sample t-test, p= 0.66). However, when phi6-E8G and phi6-G515S gained the A133V mutation, each significantly increased their PP fitness on PP (Tukey's HSD adjusted p= 0.000011, 0.011, respectively). K144R, on the other hand, was not beneficial in two genotypes on the PP host (p< 0.005).
