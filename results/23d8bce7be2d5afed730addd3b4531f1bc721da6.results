Photoreactive ligand peptides for identification of interacting protein(s) of pre-S1 domain of L envelope protein To identify the pre-S1 interacting molecule(s), we employed a photo-cross-linking approach using a synthetic peptide derived from the native pre-S1 peptide with particular residues replaced by eLife digest Liver diseases related to the human hepatitis B virus (HBV) kill about 1 million people every year, and more than 350 million people around the world are infected with the virus. Some 15 million of these people are also infected with the hepatitis D virus (HDV), which is a satellite virus of HBV, and this places them at an even higher risk of liver diseases, including cancer. The viruses are known to enter liver cells by binding to receptors on their surface before being engulfed. Both HBV and HDV have outer coats that consist of three kinds of envelope proteins, and a region called the pre-S1 domain in one of them is known to have a central role in the interaction between the viruses and the receptors and, therefore, in infecting the cells. However, the identity of the HBV receptor has remained a mystery. Now Yan et al. have identified this receptor to be sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide. This protein, known as NTCP for short, is normally involved in the circulation of bile acids in the body. In addition to humans, only two species are known to be susceptible to infection by human HBV and HDV-chimpanzees and a small mammal known as the treeshrew. Yan et al. started by isolating primary liver cells from treeshrews, and then used a combination of advanced purification and mass spectrometry analysis to show that the NTCP on the surface of the cells interacts with the pre-S1 domain in HBV. The authors then performed a series of gene knockdown experiments on liver cells of both human and treeshrew origin: when the gene that codes for NTCP was silenced, HBV infection was greatly reduced. Moreover, they were able to transfect HepG2 cells-which are widely used in research into liver disease, but are not susceptible to HBV and HDV infection-with NTCP from humans and treeshrews to make them susceptible. Similarly, although monkeys are not susceptible to HBV, replacing just five amino acids in monkey NTCP with their human counterparts was enough to make the monkey NTCP a functional receptor for the viruses. In the past, basic research into HBV and the development of antiviral therapeutics have both been hindered by the lack of suitable in vitro infection systems and animal models. Now, the work of Yan et al. means that it will be possible to use NTCP-complemented HepG2 cells for challenges as diverse as fundamental studies of basic viral entry/replication mechanisms and large-scale drug screening. It is also possible that HBV and HDV infection might interfere with some of the important physiological functions carried out by NTCP, so the latest work could also be of interest to medical scientists working on other diseases related to these infections. Research article Figure 1 . Developing photoreactive peptide ligands and an antibody for identifying pre-S1 binding partner(s) by zero distance cross-linking. (A) Schematic diagram of HBV envelope proteins and N-terminal peptides of pre-S1 domain. Pre-S1 (2-47): 2-47 th residues of the pre-S1 domain of the L Figure 1 . Continued on next page nonnatural amino acids (L-photo-leucine, L-2-amino-4,4-azi-pentanoic acid) ( Figure 1A) . L-photoleucine contains a photoactivatable diazirine ring. Irradiation of ultraviolet (UV) light at 365 nm induces a loss of nitrogen of the diazirine ring and yields a reactive carbene group with short half-life for covalent cross-linking at nearly zero distance (Suchanek et al., 2005) . Primary hepatocytes isolated from treeshrews (Tupaia belangeri), the only species susceptible to human HBV infection other than humans and chimpanzees (Su et al., 1987; Walter et al., 1996; Glebe et al., 2003) , were used as target cells. To maximize the efficiency of photo-cross-linking, two residues (leu 11 and phe 14 ) in a region (aa 9-15) known to be critical for viral infection (Schulze et al., 2010) were chosen for substitution with L-photoleucine. Leu 11 is 100% conserved among HBV genotypes, and the 14th residue is a phenylalanine in most genotypes but a leucine in some HBV strains of genotypes F and G. Changing phe 14 to leucine (F14L) did not significantly affect the binding of HDV virion to primary Tupaia hepatocytes (PTHs) ( Figure 1B) . The activity of the synthesized peptide ligand Myr-47/WT b (or WT b hereafter) containing photo-leucines at positions 11 and 14 was also confirmed ( Figure 1C,D) . WT b inhibited HDV binding to PTHs with efficiency comparable to Myr-47/WT that is comprised of all natural amino acids ( Figure 1A,C) . A peptide Myr-47/N9K b (or N9K b hereafter) similar to WT b but with an additional mutation at the ninth residue (N9K) did not block HDV binding to PTHs ( Figure 1C ). WT b but not N9K b inhibited viral infection of HBV and HDV on PTHs ( Figure 1D ). Both WT b and N9K b peptides were myristoylated at the N-terminus and conjugated with a biotin tag on a C-terminal lysine residue ( Figure 1A ). N9K b differs from WT b by only one amino acid but completely lost these blocking activities. Thus, N9K b was used as a negative control for WT b . In addition, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2D3, which specifically recognizes an epitope adjacent to the critical receptor-binding region of the peptides and shared by both WT b and N9K b , was developed ( Figure 1E ). Identification of NTCP as a specific binding protein of pre-S1 The WT b or control N9K b peptide at 200 nM was then applied to PTHs in culture and near zero distance cross-linking was induced by UV irradiation. The cross-linked peptide and associated partners were precipitated by streptavidin T1 beads and separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting using 2D3 as a probe revealed several bands including a major smeared band with apparent molecular weight of ∼65 kDa in the WT b but not N9K b cross-linked sample. The 65-kDa band shifted to ∼43 kDa upon treatment with the deglycosylation enzyme PNGase F (Figure 2A, left) , indicating that it is highly N-glycosylated. The WT b cross-linked protein apparently contained no intermolecular disulfide bonds as it migrated similarly under both nonreducing and reducing conditions (Figure 2A, right) . The non-photoreactive Myr-47/WT peptide but not its N9K mutant peptide effectively competed with WT b for cross-linking to the 65-kDa band ( Figure 2B) . The cross-linked protein from PTHs decreased in abundance rapidly over time during culture ( Figure 2C) . We also examined primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) in the crosslinking experiments. Bands with slightly smaller molecular weights than those seen in the PTH cells were also observed in PHHs ( Figure 2D) . We then proceeded to identify the target protein(s) using affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The purification procedure included three tandem steps after photo-cross-linking: protein of HBV (S472 strain, genotype C). Residue numbering is based on genotype D. Asterisk indicates highly conserved residues among genotypes. Epitope of mAb 2D3 was shaded in gray. (B) Effect of alterations of the critical N-terminal residues within pre-S1 region of L protein on HDV binding to PTHs. Both wild-type (WT) and mutant HDV virions carry HBV envelope proteins. Mutant HDV carries point mutation as indicated in the pre-S1 region of L protein. PTHs were incubated with HDV at 16°C for 4 hr and followed by extensive wash; bound virions were quantified by qRT-PCR for virus genome RNA copy, and the data are presented as percentage of virus binding, the binding of WT virus was set as 100%. (C) Myr-47/WT b bait peptide dosedependently inhibited HDV virion binding. The binding assay was performed similarly as panel B except that PTHs were pre-incubated with indicated peptides. (D) Inhibition of viral infection by the photoreactive peptides. Left: PTHs were pre-incubated with peptides at indicated concentrations at 37°C for 1 hr and then inoculated with HDV virus. Viral infection was examined by measuring viral RNA in infected cells with qRT-PCR 6 days post-infection (dpi). Data are presented as percentage HDV infection. Right: peptides at indicated concentrations were added to PTHs before HBV inoculation. The cell culture medium was replenished every 2 days. Secreted viral antigen HBeAg was measured by ELISA on 6 dpi, and the data are presented as percentage of that in the absence of peptides. (E) Antibody 2D3 recognizes residues 19-33 of pre-S1. Peptide NC36 (aa 4-36 of pre-S1, NLSVPNPLGFFPDHQLDPAFGANSNNPDWDFNP) conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) was the immunogen peptide for generating mouse mAb 2D3. Binding activity of 2D3 with full-length pre-S1 protein was measured by ELISA in the presence of competition peptides at indicated concentrations. LD15 peptide compassing residues 19-33 of pre-S1 inhibited 2D3 binding in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that 2D3 recognizes an epitope within this region.

DOI: 10.7554/eLife.00049.003 ) or Myr-47/N9K b (N9K b ), followed by Streptavidin Dynal T1 beads precipitation and Western blot analysis using mAb 2D3. The protein cross-linked by WT b is sensitive to PNGase F treatment and shifted from ∼65 to ∼43 kDa. Right: WT b cross-linked samples were treated with 100 mM DTT and/or PNGase F as indicated and detected similarly as in the left panel. (B) Non-photoreactive Myr-47/WT peptide (WT) but not its N9K mutant competed with 200 nM of WT b peptide for cross-linking with PTHs in a dose-dependent manner. (C) The abundance of the target protein(s) in PTH cells decreased over time. PTHs on different days of in vitro culturing were photo-cross-linked with 200 nM WT b . The cross-linked samples were analyzed by Western blot. The two bands at ∼65 and ∼43 kDa were due to incomplete deglycosylation by PNGase F. (D) WT b cross-linking with primary human hepatocytes (PHH). Frozen PHH cells were thawed and plated 1 day before cross-linking. With same procedure as in panel A, 200 nM WT b but not N9K b cross-linked with a glycoprotein of molecular weight at ∼60 kDa, which shifted to ∼39 kDa upon PNGase F treatment. (E) Purification of target protein(s) for MS analysis. PTHs photo-cross-linked with 200 nM of WT b or N9K b peptide were lysed, then the peptides and their cross-linked proteins were purified in tandem with Streptavidin Dynal T1 beads, mAb 2D3 conjugated beads, and Streptavidin Dynal T1 beads in 1× RIPA buffer. Extensive wash was applied for each purification step. The samples were treated with or without PNGase F as indicated prior to the last step of Streptavidin beads precipitation. The final purified samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (left). Bracketed areas indicate the bands cut for MS analysis. Western blot analysis (right) of the same cross-linked samples were performed similarly as in panel A. The top 10 nonredundant proteins identified in the 3 samples by MS analysis are listed in Figure 2 -Source data 1. The common protein hit identified by MS analysis of the ∼65and ∼43-kDa bands cut from the WT b cross-linked sample was Tupaia NTCP (tsNTCP), and the representative MS/MS spectra and parameters of the peptide hits are shown in Figure 2 -figure supplement 5. The control band cut from N9K b cross-linked sample did not generate any hits on any of these peptides. (F) Predicted tsNTCP protein sequence. A 30-amino acid insertion unique to tsNTCP is underlined. Two peptides identified by LC-MS/MS were highlighted in green. All lysine and arginine are highlighted in red to Figure 2 . Continued on next page capturing all biotin-labeled proteins with streptavidin T1 beads, sorting out the target protein(s) with 2D3 antibody affinity beads, and then purifying with streptavidin T1 beads again to remove residual molecules that were not covalently cross-linked with the bait peptide. The purified samples were subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Similar to the Western blotting results with the 2D3 antibody, a ∼65-kDa protein band was visible by silver staining. The band was also shifted to ∼43 kDa upon PNGase F treatment ( Figure 2E ). Both the original 65-kDa and the shifted 43-kDa bands were subsequently excised from the gel and subjected to LTQ-Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA. USA) MS analysis after trypsin digestion. The tandem mass spectra were searched against a Tupaia hepatocyte protein database, which we had established by deep sequencing of the transcriptome (Figure 2-figure supplements 1-4) . Two different tryptic peptide fragments, which were identified from both the ∼65-kDa and ∼43-kDa bands ( Figure 2-figure supplement 5 ), matched to a protein homolog of human NTCP. Tupaia NTCP (tsNTCP) shares 83.9% protein sequence identity with its human counterpart and has an insertion of 30 aa near its C-terminus ( Figure 2F ). The peptide (TEETIPGTLGNSTH) containing 4 aa of this insertion (underlined) was one of the two peptides identified by the MS analysis at a high confidence level ( Figure 2-figure supplement 5) . These data suggest that NTCP is the protein specifically interacting with the WT b bait peptide. Confirmation of NTCP as a specific binding protein of pre-S1 We next cloned human and Tupaia NTCPs and validated the binding of the exogenously expressed NTCPs with the WT b peptide and an N-terminal myristoylated pre-S1 peptide with native residues. Both human NTCP (hNTCP) and tsNTCP could be efficiently cross-linked by WT b but not N9K b when expressed in 293T cells as shown by Western blotting with the anti-WT b antibody 2D3 as well as an anti-C9 antibody recognizing the C-terminal C9 tag of the recombinant hNTCP and tsNTCP proteins ( Figure 3A ). WT b but not the control N9K b peptide bound to 293T cells expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged tsNTCP (tsNTCP-EGFP) and co-localized with tsNTCP-EGFP on the cell surface. This binding was readily competed off by the free Myr-47/WT peptide ( Figure 3B ). Moreover, a native pre-S1 peptide specifically recognized the human hepatocellular carcinoma Huh-7 cell line transfected with hNTCP ( Figure 3C ). Consistently, Huh-7 cells transfected with either tsNTCP or hNTCPs had markedly increased HDV binding to the cells. The Myr-47/WT peptide readily competed with binding of the wild-type HDV, whereas a noninfectious mutant HDV virus bearing a single N9K mutation in the pre-S1 domain of its L envelope protein failed to bind either hNTCP-or tsNTCPexpressing Huh-7 cells ( Figure 3D) . Collectively, these data demonstrated a specific interaction between NTCP and the pre-S1 domain of the L protein, which directly mediates the binding of HDV virions to target cells.
