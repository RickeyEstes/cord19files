Our patients (V:1, V:2, V:5, and V:8) belong to two related Saudi families ( Figure 1A) . They had early onset (2-4 months of age) severe infections caused by viruses, bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. The organisms include Klebsiella pneumonuia, Candida albicans, CMV, and BCG ( Table 1) , which were associated with different clinical manifestations ( Table 1) . Interestingly, all four patients had delayed umbilical cord separation at 2 months. They all displayed hypogammaglobulinemia. Where data is available, they had low absolute lymphocyte count (420-2,680 cells/mm 3 ), and their lymphocytes failed to respond to PHA mitogen ( Table 1) . A novel homozygous non-sense mutation in the IKBKB gene, c.850C>T (p. Arg284 * ) (Figures 1B,C) was identified in patient V:5 within the candidate autozygome, and Sanger sequencing confirmed its segregation with the disease in the remaining living siblings and parents (Figures 1A,B) . Three patients (V:1, V:2, and V:8) succumbed to their disease's infectious complications before commencing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Patient V:5 underwent HSCT from a fully matched sibling (10/10) at 19 months of age. To save his life and because of the disseminated BCGitis, he received no conditioning and no GVHD prophylaxis. The CD34 dose was 9.2 Ã— 10 6 /kg. He
