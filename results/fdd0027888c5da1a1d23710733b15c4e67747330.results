Evidence profi les were prepared for each of the clinical questions shown in panel 2 and are available from the WHO website. 7 disease was considered indirect, because the populations, viruses, and possibly even drug eff ects were diff erent. Therefore, the rating of quality of evidenceie, confi dence in the estimates of eff ect-for all important effi cacy outcomes was lowered by two quality levels. The rate and severity of adverse eff ects, however, were judged to be similar. Sparse data lowered the quality of evidence for some of the other critical outcomes (eg, lower respiratory tract infections) by another level.
