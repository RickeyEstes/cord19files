In the study period, there was a total of 403 reported cases with a majority being men (n = 300; 74.4%). The mean age § SD was 52.5 § 17.3 years. These cases were reported from Lebanon (n = 1, 0.25%), Malaysia (n = 1, 0.25%), Oman (n = 8, 2%), Qatar (n = 3, 0.74%), Saudi Arabia (n = 382, 90.6%), and United Arab Emirates (n = 8, 2%). A line graph of the distribution of cases over time is shown in Figure 1 . Of all the cases, there were 105 (26%) among health care workers (HCWs). Comorbidities were reported among 214 (53%) cases with no available information on 9% of cases. Data on camel exposure were available for 245 cases and 157 (64%) had camel exposure. Although camel milk consumption was reported for 151 cases and 64% did have camel milk ingestion, the majority (97.8%) of those with camel exposures had camel milk ingestion. Classification of MERS-CoV infection was reported for 212 cases; 58% were primary cases and the others (42%) were secondary cases. Figure 2 shows boxplot of time to specified events for lapsed time from onset of symptoms to hospitalization, onset of symptoms to diagnosis, and onset to death. The case fatality rate was 29.3% in general, and there was a significant difference in the case fatality rates between HCWs (16%) and others (34%) (P = .001). The presence of comorbidities was 71% among non-HCWs and 1.9% among HCWs (P < .0001). In addition, the mean age § SD was 47.65 § 16.28 for HCWs versus 54.23 § 17.34 for non-HCWs (P = .001). Boxplot of time to specified events and was calculated as follows: lapsed time from onset of symptoms to hospitalization, onset of symptoms to confirmation of diagnosis, hospitalization to confirmation of diagnosis, and from onset of symptoms to death. These times (in days) were calculated based on the differences between the date of symptoms onset, date of hospitalization, date of diagnosis confirmation, and date of death (if this was the case). confirm, confirmation; hosp, hospitalization; TAT, turnaround time. A comparison between primary and secondary cases is shown in Table 1 and Figure 3 . Primary cases were older with higher comorbidities, male sex, and case fatality rate. However, secondary cases were more likely to be HCWs.
