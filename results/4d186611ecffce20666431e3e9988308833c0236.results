After excluding 23 patients from the control group, 18 from PEEP8 group and 17 from PEEP10 group, 60 patients were finally analyzed in each group. Comparison of demographic variables among the groups indicates that the data for age, sex, body mass index and smoking were not significantly different (Table 1 ). In addition, there was no statistically significant difference among the three groups for variables associated with surgery including type of surgery, number of chest tubes, number of grafted vessels, duration of anesthesia, duration of aortic clamping and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass pump ( Table 2) . The chest x-ray results showed significant difference among the three groups for incidence of atelectasis two hours after extubation (p<0.05). There was a difference between the control group (22 patients, 36.7%) and the intervention group of PEEP10 (10 patients, 16.7%) (p=0.03). This comparison indicated significant difference between the intervention group of PEEP8 (20 patients, On the third day after surgery, the incidence rate of atelectasis had statistically significant difference between the intervention group of PEEP10 (21 patients, 35%) and the control group (39 patients, 65%) (p= 0.001), as well as between the intervention groups of PEEP10 and PEEP8, 36 patients (60%) (p= 0.02). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the PEEP8 group and the control group (p= 0.79) ( Table 3) . According to Table 4 , the incidence rate of atelectasis in the two times studied in each of the three groups showed that the incidence rate of atelectasis in the control group on the third day after surgery (n= 39, 65%), with one case improvement and 18 new cases, was significantly diufferent based on McNemar's test compared with the time of two hours after extubation (n= 22, 36.6%), (p<0.001). In addition, the incidence rate of atelectasis in the PEEP8 group on the third day after surgery (n= 36, 60%), with four cases improvement and 20 new cases, was significantly different compared with a time of two hours after extubation (n= 20, 33.3%), (p< 0.001). Nevertheless, the incidence rate of atelectasis in the PEEP10 group on the third day after surgery (n= 21, 35%), with eight cases improvement and 19 new cases, was not significantly different based on McNemar's test compared with a time of two hours after extubation (n= 10, 16.6%) (p<0.001) ( Table 4) . Tukey post hoc test revealed statistically significant difference for the mean (SD) duration of intubation in the ICU between the intervention group of PEEP10 and the control group (p<0.001), as well as between the intervention group of PEEP10 and the intervention group of PEEP8 (p<0.001). However, no significant difference was observed between the intervention group of PEEP8 and the control group (p=0.97). The mean (SD) duration of stay in ICU had statistically significant difference between the intervention group of PEEP10 and the control group (p<0.001), as well as between the intervention group of PEEP10 and the intervention group of PEEP8 (p<0.001); but no significant difference was found between the intervention group of PEEP8 and the control group (p=0.36). Moreover, considering the duration of hospitalization, there was a statistical significant difference between the intervention group of PEEP10 and the control group (p<0.001), as well as between the intervention group of PEEP10 and the intervention group of PEEP8 (p<0.001). Nevertheless, no significant difference was found between the intervention group of PEEP8 and the control group (p=0.91). The data have been shown in Table 5 .
