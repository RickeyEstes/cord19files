Two RT-RPA assays were designed for the detection of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus. Two molecular in vitro transcribed RNA standards (H7 and N9) were implemented to evaluate both RT-RPA assays. A dilution range of 10 7 -10 1 molecules/l of the RNA H7 and N9 molecular standards was used to select the RT-RPA primer and probe combination to produce the highest assay analytical sensitivity. RPA primers and exo-Ps listed in Table 2 yielded an analytical sensitivity between 10 and 100 RNA molecules for the H7 and N9 RT-RPA assays, respectively (Fig. 3) . Using the data of eight RT-RPA runs of RNA molecular standard serial dilutions, a semilog regression (Fig. 4) and probit regression analysis (Fig. 5) were carried out. The run times for both assays were between 2 and 7 min (Fig. 4) . The limits of detection in 95% of cases were calculated to be 14 (Fig. 5A) and 179 (Fig. 5B ) RNA molecules detected for the H7 and the N9 RT-RPA assays, respectively. Both the H7 and N9 RT-RPA assays were specific. They detected neither viral nucleic acids of other respiratory viruses (Table 1) nor the human or the avian genome. Unfortunately, no clinical samples were available to test the clinical sensitivity of the assay.
