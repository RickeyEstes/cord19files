Evaluation of the diagnostic performances of the 3 commercial MERS-CoV rRT-PCR assays showed the TIB MolBiol® LightMix assays as having the best clinical sensitivity, followed by the Seegene and GeneSig® assays (Table 2 ). Comparative cycle threshold (C T ) values are detailed in Table 3 , except for the Anyplex™ Seegene assay which provided only qualitative detection. All internal controls (where applicable) were valid, with minimal C T variations. The TIB MolBiol® LightMix assay displayed 94.12% (32/34) sensitivity in our clinical specimen pool. Two of the 34 specimens yielded i) positive UpE gene amplification, without amplification of the confirmatory Orf1a target and ii) positive Orf1a gene amplification, without amplification of the UpE target (Table 3) , both resulting in a negative MERS-CoV classification. The Anyplex™ Seegene assay displayed a modest sensitivity of 79.4% (27/34). However, the original GeneSig® assay (assay 3A) lacked sensitivity (41.2%; 14/34), particularly with specimens displaying low viral loads (high C T values on comparative assays). Comparatively, our modification of the GeneSig® protocol (assay 3B) improved MERS-CoV RNA detection to 73.5% (25/34). Of 200 randomly selected MERS-CoV-negative respiratory specimens from the same collection period, all assays displayed negative rRT-PCR results. Additionally, during the cross-reactivity evaluation using 22 specimens positive for other respiratory viruses, the specificity of both the Anyplex™ Seegene and GeneSig® assays was 100% (Table 4 ). Only the TIB MolBiol® LightMix assay produced limited cross-reactivity with 1 influenza B-positive clinical specimen (confirmed by the Anyplex™ II RV16 assay). Under our blind-testing protocol, all extracted RNA samples used in this study were also retested on the RealStar® MERS-CoV rRT-PCR assay (the gold standard), and C T values are also displayed in Table 3 . All 34 known positive specimens yielded positive results, indicating that archiving at −80°C (4-6 months) had not compromised specimen integrity. The RealStar® assay in most cases (76%) yielded lower C T values than all other assays. This assay also displayed 0% cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses.
