Preferential recruitment of M133-specific Tregs to the rJ2.2-infected brain In the natural infection, M133-specific Tregs were detected in the rJ2.2-infected brain [12] . However, adoptively transferred bulk populations of splenic C57BL/6 (B6) Tregs (bulk Tregs) were minimally detected in the infected central nervous system (CNS) [7] . To reconcile these disparate results, we co-transferred bulk Tregs and M133 Tregs derived from uninfected Foxp3 gfp and M133 Tg-Foxp3 gfp mice, respectively. Approximately 0.5-1% of the CD4 T cells in the blood of M133 Tg mice expressed Foxp3; 50% of Foxp3 + and .97% of Foxp3 2 CD4 T cells (Tconv) bound I-A b /M133 tetramer ( Figure 1A) . Equal numbers of Violetlabeled bulk and M133 Tregs were transferred to B6 mice, some of which were infected with rJ2.2 24 hours later ( Figure 1B) . Tregs were identified in the lymphoid tissues of infected and uninfected recipient mice seven days after infection, using the gating strategy shown in Figure 1C . Equal numbers of bulk and M133 Tregs were detected in the spleen, cervical and deep cervical lymph nodes (CLN, DCLN) of uninfected mice and neither population proliferated substantially. In contrast, after infection, M133 but not bulk Tregs proliferated extensively in all three peripheral lymphoid tissues. Further, only M133 Tregs entered the infected brain to a detectable extent ( Figure 1D ). By day 7 post infection (p.i.), the ratio of M133 to bulk Tregs ranged from 10:1 in lymphoid tissue to greater than 1000:1 in the brain ( Figure 1E ). In addition to exhibiting less proliferation, transferred bulk Tregs in the DCLN were less activated when assessed by measuring expression of CD25, CTLA-4, CXCR3 and ICOS at day 4 p.i. ( Figure 1F ).
