The scenario analysis performed in the study addressed the sensitivity of PEDv incidence outputs given changes in the proportions of producer agents assigned to the risk averse and risk tolerant categories in the ABM. We performed statistical tests to measure the effect of seven distributions of risk attitudes ( Table 1 ) on the spread of PEDv within the hog production system simulated in our ABM. The results of the non-parametric tests comparing the distributions of total incidence, linear trend's intercept and slope are shown by the compact letters above the box-plots in Figures 3-5 . Box-plots are presented to show overall patterns of three indicators and visualize their distribution characteristics across scenarios. The 12.5 and 37.5% averse represent the two extreme scenarios. The baseline is the scenario with an equal percentage (25%) of producers in both the risk averse and risk tolerant categories.
