Long-term follow-up of CIE mice revealed three phenotypes of neurological symptom development. To understand the effects of coronavirus-induced demyelination on LUT function, we performed a long-term follow up study (up to 10 wks) of CIE mice. As described in the Methods, all CIE mice were assigned to one of the following experimental groups: a group with recovery from initial symptoms after acute phase of the disease (REC group); a group with chronic progression of neurodegeneration and the presence of symptoms at 8 wks post-inoculation (C-PRO group), and a group with occurring relapsing and remission episodes (C-RELAP group, Fig. 1a) . Out of 72 mice in CIE group, 48.6% of animals (N = 35) had no neurological impairment symptoms at 8 wks and, therefore, were assigned to REC group (Fig. 1b) . 31.94% of CIE mice (N = 23) still had elevated clinical symptom score (CSS) and were assigned to C-PRO group (Fig. 1c) . 19 .44% of all CIE mice (N = 14) experienced relapsing-remitting episodes and, therefore, were assigned to C-RELAP group (Fig. 1d) . Inoculation of mice with MHV-A59 virus caused a significant weight loss at 1 and 2 wks in all groups of inoculated animals (Fig. 1e , p < 0.05 to baseline). The weight loss was reflective of the acute phase of infection associated with the development of active inflammation in the CNS. Mice in all groups started gaining weight at the normal rate at 3 wks post-inoculation. The analysis of the combined CSS in all CIE mice showed that the most significant neurological impairment was developed between 1 and 2 weeks after inoculation with the virus (Fig. 1f , p < 0.05 to the baseline). The highest weekly recorded CSS revealed that up to 40% of mice in REC and C-PRO groups had CSS of 3 over the course of the experiment (Fig. 1g) . Mice in C-PRO group showed the patterns of neurologic impairment similar to the mice in REC group at 1 and 2 wks, however, 86.96% and 13.04% of C-PRO mice still had CSS 2 and 1, respectively, at 8 wks post-inoculation (Fig. 1g) . Interestingly, more mice in C-RELAP group (92.86% and 85.71% at 1 and 2 wks, respectively) had CSS 2 or above at earlier time points as compared to REC and C-PRO mice (Fig. 1g ). Long-term follow-up of CIE mice revealed expression changes of cytokines and growth factor in the brain and urinary bladder. Our group previously reported that CIE mice had fluctuations in CNS cytokine levels at 4 wks post-inoculation 21 . Therefore, we also tested the expression level of INF-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-17 as well as growth factors, TGF-β and TNF-α, by multiplex ELISA at 10 wks after inoculation with the virus. REC mice had significantly decreased expression levels of IL-1β and IL-10 in the brain (p < 0.05 to PBS group, Fig. 2a ). C-PRO group was characterized by a decreased expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17 and TNF-α (p < 0.05 to PBS group, Fig. 2a) whereas C-RELAP mice had a significantly reduced level of IL-4 in the brain (p < 0.05 to PBS group). No significant changes in cytokine content were detected in the spinal cord of all subgroups of CIE mice (data not shown). However, several changes were noted in the urinary bladders of CIE mice. Figure 2b presents a significantly decreased expression of TNF-α in REC mice (p < 0.05 to PBS group) and a reduced content of INF-γ, IL-2, TGF-β and TNF-α in the urinary bladders of C-PRO mice (p < 0.05 to PBS group) without substantial changes observed in C-RELAP group (Fig. 2b) . Evaluation of micturition patterns in vivo by FPA revealed a delayed recovery of voiding function in C-RELAP group. We previously reported an increase in large (>1 cm) and small (<1 cm) voiding spots in CIE mice from 2 to 4 wks after inoculation with the same virus 21 suggestive of overactive bladder phenotype development. In this study, we followed the micturition patterns up to 8 wks in each of REC, C-PRO and C-RELAP groups. The number of large urine spots in C-RELAP group was significantly higher than in REC group at 5 wks post-inoculation (Fig. 3a , p ≤ 0.05 to REC and C-PRO groups). In addition, the number of large urine spots in C-RELAP group at 5 wks was significantly higher than the number at 7 and 8 wks within the same group. No significant differences were observed in the numbers of small urine spots between the groups at long-term followup (Fig. 3b) . Mice in C-RELAP group showed the most severe overactive bladder phenotype evaluated by cystometry. While FPA assay allows for a long-term follow-up of micturition patters in mice in vivo, it does not provide the direct measures of bladder pressure, bladder capacity and frequency of micturition. Therefore, we performed urodynamic evaluation of voiding patterns in each subgroup of CIE mice by in vivo cystometry which was conducted in unanesthetized mice. Figure 4a shows representative single micturition cycles recorded in the control (PBS), REC, C-PRO and C-RELAP groups of mice. At 10 wks post-inoculation, bladder capacity ( Fig. 4b) , the inter-micturition interval (Fig. 4c) , and bladder pressure at voiding (Fig. 4d ) in all groups, except for the C-RELAP group, were similar to the respective values in the control group. However, mice in C-RELAP group developed overactive bladder phenotype associated with lower bladder capacity (17.88 ± 0.72 vs 107.49 ± 22.56 μl, p ≤ 0.05 to control group, Fig. 4b ), reduced ratio of normalized inter-micturition interval (0.17 ± 0.01, p ≤ 0.05 ratio to control group, Fig. 4c ), and decreased pressure at micturition (17.75 ± 1.52 vs. 43.62 ± 7.43 ml, p ≤ 0.05 to control; Fig. 4d ). These results suggest that mice in C-RELAP group develop a more severe and long-lasting type of neurogenic bladder overactivity than other groups providing evidence of some correlation between the type of neurodegenerative changes in the CNS and type of developed voiding dysfunction in CIE mice. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ In vitro studies revealed differential contractile responses of the detrusor to electric field stimulation (EFS) among the CIE groups. Next, we isolated the urinary bladders from CIE mice to measure detrusor muscle tone at the baseline, assess the peak force (PF) of the contractile responses to EFS, high potassium solution and pharmacological activation by different drugs. In vitro contractility studies determined a decreased basal tone of the detrusor (by 48.59% to REC group, p ≤ 0.05, Fig. 5a ) and diminished amplitude of nerve-mediated contractions in the C-RELAP group in response to EFS (by 25.50% to C-PRO www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ group, p ≤ 0.05, Fig. 5b ). Bladder smooth muscle strips from C-PRO group had a significantly elevated contractile response to EFS (by 174.09% to control, p ≤ 0.05, Fig. 5b ) and increased PF of muscle-mediated contractions (in response to high potassium, by 199.77% to control, p ≤ 0.05, Fig. 5c ). Additionally, percentage of maximal purinergic responses of nerve-mediated contractions normalized to L 0 were up-regulated in C-PRO group when compared to control group (p ≤ 0.05, Fig. 5d ) whereas muscarinic responses in C-PRO group were comparable to the control group (Fig. 5e) . We further dissected the muscarinic components ( Fig. 5f ) from nicotinic components (Fig. 5g ) of the contractile responses to EFS but neither of them revealed significant differences between experimental groups. To evaluate the velocity of both contractile and relaxing responses after application of EFS, we calculated the contractile and relaxing slopes of purinergic, M3-mediated muscarinic, M2-mediated muscarinic, α-3 nicotinic and α-7 nicotinic responses. The purinergic component of bladder smooth muscle strips contractions from C-PRO mice showed significantly increased slope values of both contraction (Fig. 6a -e) and relaxation phases (Fig. 6f-j) . Interestingly, the purinergic, α3and α7-nicotinic components of the detrusor contractile responses in C-RELAP group of mice showed a significantly delayed relaxation rates as evidenced by the Sr slope (Fig. 6f,i,j) . www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/
