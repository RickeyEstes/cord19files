Patient 1, a 64-year-old man, visited Dubai from April 9, to April 17, 2013. Fever and chills with diarrhoea (three to four bowel movements per day) started on April 22. Symptoms were much the same as those of a previous episode of sigmoiditis treated 6 months before. He also had a history of hypertension and diabetes, and had undergone renal transplantation in 1998, for renal failure secondary to diabetes. His existing treatments were mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin, and prednisone. He was admitted to the Valenciennes hospital on April 23, presenting with diarrhoea and fever reaching 39°C, arterial pressure at 137/66 mm Hg, and pulseoxymetric oxygen saturation of 96% on ambient air. At that time, he did not have any respiratory symptoms (cough or dyspnoea). Chest radiograph was normal (not shown). Table 1 summarises biological data for patient 1. Blood cultures, stool analysis, urine antigen assays for Legionella spp and Pneumococcus spp, and plasma PCR for cytomegalovirus were negative. Treatment with ceftriaxone was initiated on April 24. An abdominal CT scan done on April 24 did not show any evidence of colitis, but lower thoracic images showed major pulmonary infi ltrates (fi gure 1A). On April 26, the patient developed dyspnoea and cough. Levofl oxacin was added to ceftriaxone therapy. A CT scan of the lung was done on April 26, and showed a mostly peripheral interstitial infi ltrate associated with right lower-lobe consolidation and left lower-lobe consolidation in the anterior basal, lateral basal, and posterior basal areas. A bronchoalveolar lavage was done and cytology showed a high number of neutrophils and macrophages. No specifi c pathogen was identifi ed on direct microbiological examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid, and co-trimoxazole was added to the antimicrobial treatment regimen. Oxygen requirement increased daily to reach 10 L/min on April 29. Patient 1 was transferred to the Douai hospital intensive-care unit (ICU) on April 29, where non-invasive mechanical ventilation was started, and antimicrobial therapy was modifi ed to piperacilline plus tazobactam and linezolid. He had rapid respiratory deterioration, and was intubated on April 30 (fi gure 1B). Respiratory failure was followed by shock and renal failure, leading to noradrenaline administration and continuous venovenous haemofi ltration. On May 1, on the basis of the clinical presentation and the history of recent travel to Dubai, the hypothesis of an infection with MRES-CoV was raised, prompting the transfer of nasopharyngeal and stored bronchoalveolar lavage samples to the National Reference Center in Paris. Further worsening of the respiratory status with a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) ratio of 100 despite low tidal volume and high-positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide, prone positioning, sedation, and neuromuscular blockade, prompted the implementation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Persisting haemodynamic support with norepinephrine at 0·5 mg/h was necessary. The patient was transferred to the ECMO referral centre ICU of Lille University Teaching Hospital on May 8 (fi gure 1C). As of May 27, the patient remained under ECMO therapy because of persisting severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (fi gure 1D). At 100% FiO 2 on both ECMO and ventilator settings and with mean ECMO pump fl ow of 5·2 L/min, resulting PaO 2 values did not exceed 80 mm Hg. Oxygen sweep fl ow was 12 L/min, resulting in mean partial pressure of carbon dioxide values of about 38 mm Hg. The patient had several haemorrhagic complications, contributing to renal failure and requirement for extrarenal epuration. No evidence of bacterial superinfection was noted before ECMO. Endotracheal aspirates remained sterile. After the implantation of ECMO, the patient had candidemia with Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. Empirical antifungal therapy with caspofungin had been started before ECMO. Patient 1 died on May 28, due to refractory multiple organ failure. Patient 2, a 51-year-old man, was admitted to the Valenciennes hospital on April 26, for left arm deep venous thrombosis. He lived in the north of France and had not recently travelled abroad. His medical history included myocardial infarction in 2005, arterial hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and histamine-induced angioedema, for which he had needed systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone 40 mg per day) since June, 2012. He also had several episodes of deep venous thrombosis associated with the presence of low concentrations of an anticardiolipin antibody, IgM isotype, for which he was treated with a vitamin K antagonist. Patient 2 shared patient 1's room from April 26, to April 29. The room was 20 m², and 1·5 m separated the two patients' beds. Both patients shared the same bathroom. During this 3-day period, patient 1 remained mostly confi ned to his bed, whereas patient 2 was able to move around. No nebulisers or known aerosol-generating procedures were used for patient 1. Because the diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was not suspected, patient 1 wore no mask, and neither patient 2, nor staff nor visitors used protective equipment. Patient 2 was discharged from the hospital to his home on April 30. On May 8, patient 2 presented with asthenia, myalgia, and cough. On May 9, he was rapidly directed to the Infectious Diseases Department of Lille University Teaching Hospital, since by that time he was a known contact of a confi rmed case (positive results for MERS-CoV were available for patient 1 on May 7). On admission, he presented with fever (38°C), pulseoxymetric saturation of 95% on ambient air, and a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per min. Table 2 summarises biological data for patient 2. Chest radiograph showed upper right lobe consolidation (fi gure 2A). Oxygen therapy at 3 L/min and piperacillin plus tazobactam were started on April 30. The initial nasopharyngeal sample was inconclusive. The patient remained stable but with a high fever (39-40°C) between May 9 and May 12. Linezolid was added to the anti microbial regimen on May 11. Diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was confi rmed on the basis of results from induced sputum analysis on May 11. Personal protective equipmentan FFP2 mask, gloves, gown, and goggles-was used to prevent secondary transmission during sputum induction. On May 12, the patient had acute respiratory failure, and oxygen therapy was increased to 5 L/min. Chest radiograph showed complete consolidation of the right lung and involvement of the lower left lobe (fi gure 2B). The patient was transferred to the ICU where oxygen therapy was progressively increased. Appearance of confusion, disorientation, and increasing hypoxaemia led to intubation and mechanical ventilation on May 13. Bronchoalveolar lavage was done, and no specifi c pathogen was identifi ed, either on direct microbiological examination or culture. This sample was not tested for MERS-CoV, because the diagnosis had already been confi rmed. After intubation, on the same day, FiO 2 was increased to 1; inhaled nitric oxide and prone positioning became necessary. After intubation, dobutamine was introduced for biventricular dysfunction-confi rmed by transthoracic echo cardio gram-and progressively weaned over the next 48 h. Acute renal failure and anuria, despite volume expansion, resulted in haemodialysis on May 14. On May 14, PaO 2 to FiO 2 ratio was 90, despite inhaled nitric oxide, prone positioning, and low tidal volume and high PEEP ventilation, leading to imple mentation of ECMO. Neither norepinephrine nor dobuta mine treatment were underway on the day of ECMO implantation. Chest radiograph showed bilateral diff use alveolar-interstitial infi ltrates on May 15 (fi gure 2C). The chest radiograph also showed bilateral ground-glass opacities with major consolidation (fi gure 2D). No bacterial superinfection was identifi ed before ECMO. Patient 2's respiratory status has improved since May 26, with FiO 2 at 70% on both ventilator and ECMO settings, ECMO fl ow at 5·2 L/min, and ECMO oxygen sweep fl ow at 5 L/min. Sedation is being progressively weaned. On May 2, the National Infl uenza Center at the Institut Pasteur was notifi ed by the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance of a possible case of infection with MERS-CoV. A nasopharyngeal swab obtained from patient 1 on April 30, analysed by real-time RT-PCR, was Preliminary results of RT-PCR done on blood specimens from patient 1 on May 9 were positive for MERS-CoV in whole blood; weak but inconsistent detection was noted in plasma samples (table 3) . No other types of specimens were analysed for either patient in this timeframe. Virus isolation on Vero E6 (African green monkey kidney) cells was attempted from all respiratory specimens from both patients and an isolate was obtained from the sputum of patient 1. Preliminary analysis of serum samples from patient 1 from May 7 and May 9 shows reactivity in western blot with a recombinant N protein (data not shown). Confi rmatory sequence analysis of the RdRp and N gene segments was done directly on RNA extracted from the bronchoalveolar lavage specimen from patient 1 and sputum specimen from patient 2. The sequences from both patients were identical. The RdRp sequences showed the C→T polymorphism at position 15196, which distinguishes all available sequences from that of the EMC/2012 isolate. 5 For the N gene, sequences were identical to that of the EMC isolate and did not show the short deletion (nucleotides 29736-29741) nor any of the polymorphisms recorded at positions 29714 (A→T) and 29723 (G→T) in the England/Qatar/2012 sequence, nor that found at position 29811 (C→T) in the Jordan-N3/2012 sequence (appendix). 5, 15, 17 These results defi nitively estab lish that both patients were infected with MERS-CoV.
