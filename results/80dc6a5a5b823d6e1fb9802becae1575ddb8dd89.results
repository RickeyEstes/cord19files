Demographic characteristics of the study participants are shown in Table 2 . Overall, 29 participants enrolled in the study. Twenty (69.0%) were female, and mean age was 29.2 years (standard deviation [SD], 2.39). The mean work experience was 3.33 years (SD, 2.67). Among participants, 20.7% had previously received PPE training (Table 2 ). Values are presented as median (interquartile range) or number (%). One to twelve number of the Table 3 shows step by step process. PPE, personal protective equipment. Values are presented as median (interquartile range) or number (%). One to seventeen number of the Table 4 shows step by step process The average donning process interval was 234.2 seconds (SD, 65.7) from start to finish. The most time-consuming process was putting on the gown, putting on shoe covers, and putting on the respirator. The most frequent errors occurred while putting on outer gloves (27.6%), respirator (20.7%), and hood (20.7%). The entire donning procedures refer to Table 3 . The average interval during doffing was 183.7 seconds (SD, 38.4) from start to finish. The most time-consuming processes were removing the shoe covers, putting on gloves, and removing outer gloves. The most frequent errors occurred during disinfecting feet (38.0%), discarding scrubs (17.2%), and putting on gloves (13.8%). The entire doffing procedures refer to Table 4 . Fig. 2 illustrates contamination locations. During the overall doffing process, 65 contamination incidents occurred. The most vulnerable process was removing respirators, which caused 23 contaminations (79.3%). Two of these were on the head (6.9%), and 21 were on the neck (72.4%). Removal of shoe covers was also associated with a high probability of contamination; 19 incidents (65.5%) were reported. All locations of contamination were consistent with the doffing step related to that part of the body. Even after standardized education, 65 numbers of contamination were reported, or 2.2 per participant. Further studies are required to minimize this number.
