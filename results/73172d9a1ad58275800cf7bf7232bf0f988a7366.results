Of the 198 patients evaluated in this study, 57% were HIV-positive and 50% of these had advanced stage IV disease. Overall, 34 (17%) of the 198 specimens had one or more of the 4 types of enteric vin;ses (Table 1) Table 2 . Nearly all (93%) of the seropositive patients were in the advanced stages III or IV of their HIV disease and 49% died during their stay in hospital. The HIV negative patients were also extremely ill with an in-hospital death rate of 22%. The prevalence of viral shedding was 17% overall, with an equal distribution between HIV-positive (17%) and HIV-negative (18%) patients (P=O.82). Immunocompromise, indicated by advanced clinical HIV stage, was not associated with increased viral shedding. Although there was no significant difference in viral shedding among the 4 HIV stages, there were relatively few patients in the less immunocompromised stages I and II (Table 3 ). Viral shedding was weakly associated with more advanced immunoincompetance, as measured by the ratio of circulating CD4 and CD8 T cells (Table 4 ). When only HIV infected patients were considered the trend was stronger (P=O.O7). Viral excretion in the stool was not associated with a history of recent, or a report of present, acute or chronic diarrhoea (Table l) , fever, vomiting, or significant (>lO%) weight loss at the time of the study (data not shown). Diarrhoeal stool which contained virus was no more likely to contain blood, pus, or mucous than if viral shedding was absent (data not shown). Nonetheless, chronic diarrhoea was highly correlated with HIV seropositivity (P<O.Ol), HIV stage (Mann-Whitney P<O.OOl) or CD4iCD8 T-cell ratio (Mann-Whitney P<O.Ol), although acute diarrhoea was not. I. belli or C. parvum were detected in the stool of 35 patients and the presence of one or other was highly correlated with HIV serostatus (80% vs. 20%, P=O.OOS). In seropositive patients the presence of coccidia was weakly associated with acute diarrhoea (29% vs. 14%, P=O.O8) but not with chronic diarrhoea (27% vs. 24%, P=O.77). Because these organisms may produce diarrhoea they could potentially confound any association between the presence of enteric virus and acute or chronic diarrhoea. However, analysis after removal of patients with faecal coccidia did not reveal any significant association between enteric virus and diarrhoeal symptoms, HIV serostatus, HIV stage or CD4ICD8 ratio.
