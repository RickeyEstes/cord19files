The overall seroprevalence of anti-T. gondii immunoglobulin G antibodies was 41.12% (95% CI 38.28-44.03, Table 1 ). No seroconversions or seroreversions were detected in the cats from which two samples were tested. The questionnaire data and test result for each individual cat are presented in S6 Table. The seroprevalence increased with age (Fig 1) . The seroprevalence in adult cats was 45.20% (95% CI 42.04-48.40), which was higher (P < 0.001) than the seroprevalence in kittens, 18.79% (95% CI 13.52-25.47). Burmese had the lowest seroprevalence (18.82%) and Persians had the highest (60.00%). P-values of the two-by-two tables comparing two breeds at the time are shown in S2 Table. Among the cats included in this study, the seroprevalence in cats of long-haired breeds was 47.2% (95% CI 43.5-51.0), which was higher (P < 0.001) than the seroprevalence in cats of short-haired breeds, 31.6% (95% CI 27.4-36.1). The odds of testing seropositive were 1.94 (95% CI 1.51-2.50) times higher among long-haired cats than in short-haired cats. In the univariable logistic regression models generated for each breed separately (S3 Table) , being an adult cat was a risk factor for T. gondii seropositivity for Birmans and Norwegian Forest Cats. Receiving raw meat was a risk factor for Birmans and Burmese. Having outdoor access was a risk factor for Norwegian Forest Cats. Being of male gender appeared as a protective factor for Birmans. The univariable analyses for all cats, regardless of breed (S3 Table) , identified being an adult cat, receiving raw meat, and having outdoor access as risk factors for T. gondii seropositivity. The model using age as a continuous variable suggested that the odds to test seropositive would increase with a factor of 1.24 (95% CI 1.19-1.29) for each additional year. In the multivariable logistic regression model built for Birmans, being an adult cat and receiving raw meat were risk factors, while being male was a protective factor (S4 Table) . The model built for Norwegian Forest Cats included two risk factors: being an adult and having outdoor access. In the model built for Burmese, receiving raw meat was the only risk factor. The multivariable model built for all cats, regardless of breed (S4 Table) , included being an adult cat and receiving raw meat as risk factors. The final multivariable logistic regression model for T. gondii seropositivity included the breeds as dummy variables (the Burmese as the reference breed), age as a categorized variable (< 1 year old as the reference category), and whether the cat received raw meat or not as a dichotomous variable ( Table 2) . The odds to test seropositive were four to seven times higher in cats of breeds Birman, Ocicat, Norwegian Forest Cat and Persian when compared with the Burmese, while the model also confirmed that older age and receiving raw meat were relevant risk factors for T. gondii seropositivity. Age was identified as a confounder. The results from the models with different breeds as the reference are shown in supplementary tables (S5 Table) .
