NPS specimens from 199 H1N1pdm-positive patients, collected between June 23 and July 4 during the course of an outbreak investigation of pandemic H1N1 influenza in Argentina, were analyzed by MassTag PCR for the presence of potential sources of coinfection, including 33 viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. Prior to initiating MassTag PCR studies, the presence of H1N1pdm was confirmed for all samples with the WHOapproved Real Time PCR H1N1pdm assay [7] . Subjects included 39 patients classified with severe disease, based on hospitalization (n = 19) or death (n = 20), and 160 patients with mild disease, who presented to ambulatory clinics. Five patients had medical conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease following influenza infection (asthma, malnutrition, pregnancy, obesity, immunosuppression; n = 1 each). Four of these patients (80%) had severe disease; 1 had mild disease (p = 0.0056). To examine whether the age groups typically associated with greater risk of influenza-related complications -i.e., young children and the elderly [8] -were also at higher risk for more severe disease in the context of H1N1pdm, we compared the severity of disease in subjects ,6 years of age or .55 years of age (high risk age group) with that found in subjects 6 to 55 years of age (low risk age group; age data available for 181 subjects). Although the mean age of severe and mild disease subjects was similar, severe disease occurred in 14 of 26 (53.8%) of high risk age group subjects as compared with 20 of 155 (12.9%) of the low risk age group subjects (Fisher's exact test, p,0.0001; Table 1 ). However, of the 34 patients with severe disease for whom age data were available, 20 (58.8%) were from the low risk age group (Fisher's exact test, p,0.0001). There was a trend toward a higher prevalence of severe disease in males (20 of 80, or 25.0%) as compared with females (15 of 104, or 14.4%; p = 0.09). Data concerning antiviral and antibiotic therapy were available for 120 subjects. Risk of severe disease was diminished in subjects who received only oseltamivir. Of 96 subjects receiving oseltamavir alone, 10 (10.4%) had severe disease. In contrast, 13 of 14 patients (92.9%) who received antibiotics without antiviral medication had severe disease (p,0.0001).
