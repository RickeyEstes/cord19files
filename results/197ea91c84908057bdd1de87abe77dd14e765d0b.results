The primers designed for the RT-PCR based assays amplify specifically partial sequences of the human metapneumovirus genes which encode for the matrix and the polymerase viral proteins. Primer concentrations and annealing temperatures, thermocycling parameters, concentration of each reaction component and probe hybridisation, both temperature and concentration, were standardised by experimentation. After optimizing the assay conditions, both assays showed concordant results with serial 10-fold dilutions of the human metapneumovirus strain NL/1/99 used as positive control (Fig. 1) . The efficient limit of detection was 0.1 TCID 50 on each assay. Specificity of the method was assayed by using RNA extracted from different respiratory viruses (influenza A, B and C, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, parainfluenza 1-3, adenoviruses and enteroviruses). Fig. 1 . Sensitivity limits of RT-PCR assays evaluated by serial dilutions from 10 −1 to 10 −5 , correspond to 10 2 to 10 −2 TCID 50 of the prototype strain of human metapneumovirus grown in MK2 cells. In the left panel can be visualised the RT-heminested-PCR assay for matrix gene in a 2% agarose gel in which both internal control and specific band are indicated. The right panel shows a sensitive film for polymerase RLB assay in which specific probe is used in triplicate for every virus dilution. In both assays, the detection limit reached was the dilution 10 −4 which corresponds to 10 −1 TCID 50 . The reverse line blotting procedure for polymerase gene and the RT-heminested-PCR for the matrix gene were validated by using a total of 300 clinical nasopharyngeal aspirates taken from young infants. The number of specimens collected per season is summarized in Table 1 . Out of 300 specimens, a total of 50 resulted positive for the presence of human metapneumovirus (16.6%) by both RT-PCR assays. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were considered positive for the presence of human metapneumovirus only when a positive result for this virus was obtained in both assays. When enough amount of sample was available, positive human metapneumovirus results were confirmed by sequence analysis. The number of positive human metapneumovirus samples found was higher in the 2001-2002 season than in the other two seasons, although the number of samples analysed in the three periods was rather similar (Table 1) . The annual distribution of human metapneumovirus positive specimens, summarized in Fig. 2 , showed a peak in the viral detection between February and April, that corresponded to a maximum in February and March in both 2000 -2001 and 2001 -2002 seasons, and another between March and April in the 2002 season. Although most of the positive nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected between February and April, human metapneumovirus infection was also detected in specimens collected in January, May, June, October and December at a lower rate (nine positive specimens in total). All nasopharyngeal aspirates, collected from one hospital during the three consecutive seasons, had been tested previously for the main respiratory viruses (influenza A-C, respiratory syncytial virus groups A and B, parainfluenza 1-3, adenoviruses and enteroviruses) using RT-PCRs assays (Coiras et al., 2003) , indirect immunofluorescence assay and/or isolation in cell culture. The number of positives for each virus and the percentage obtained is summarized in Table 2 and in Fig. 3 . As shown, the percentage of human metapneumovirus, referred to the total 747 nasopharyngeal aspirates, is at least 6.7%, due to the fact that only negative samples have been analysed and so double infections, if any, could not been found.
