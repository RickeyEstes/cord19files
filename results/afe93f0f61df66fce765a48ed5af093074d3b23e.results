Using conventional techniques, IFA and the viral isolation technique, viruses were detected in 44 (33.3%) of the 132 nasal aspirates (Table 2) . By PCR techniques, nucleic acid sequences of virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were obtained in 95 (71.9%) cases. The combination of conventional and molecular techniques detected 108 (81.8%) positive specimens. Two organisms were identified in the same nasal sample in 27 cases (20.4%). Fourteen rhinovirus were detected in association with nine RS virus, two coronavirus OC43, one enterovirus, one Chlamydia pneumoniae and one Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respectively; six RS virus were associated with four adenovirus, one coronavirus OC43, and one Chlamydia pneumoniae; five enterovirus were associated with two adenovirus, one coronavirus OC43, one Chlamydia pneumoniae, one parainfluenza virus; two Chlamydia pneumoniae were associated with one influenza virus A and one Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The comparison of results according to the children's age showed that the percentages of viral, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae detections were not equal (85.9% vs. 77%) between the two groups. There was a higher level of positive identification in younger children, which was confirmed when using conventional techniques (43.6% vs. 21.3%). That most probably reflected the broader range of infections that children experienced in the first 2 years of life. There were 14 post-acute nasal samples collected in 12 children. Rhinovirus were detected in acute and post-acute nasal samples in two cases and not found in the post-acute samples in eight cases. In two children infected by influenza A virus, or in two others infected by RS virus, only one of them shedded the respective virus in the post-acute control. All these results indicated that only a few viruses could be shedded for longer intervals than 6-9 days. Moreover, as the mean time between two asthmatic exacerbations in the same children was at least 2.1 months, a prolonged shedding of viruses was likely to be exceptional in our study. Table 3 details the detection rates of viruses, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The detection rate of those agents was greater using molecular rather than conventional techniques (119 vs. 46, respectively). PCR assays, by their design and nature, were highly sensitive for the detection of pathogens which were poorly detected by culture or immunoassays. Such agents included rhinovirus, coronavirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The detection of rhinovirus was increased 5.8-fold using the PCR technique as distinct from culture (58 vs. 10). Among six coronavirus PCR-positive samples (five coronavirus OC43, one coronavirus 229E), none were IFA-positive. Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were sought by PCR assays only, because of the previously documented low efficiency of direct detection techniques for their isolation. Molecular techniques also improved the detection rate of viruses which were usually detected by conventional assays: RS virus, adenovirus, enterovirus â€¦ For example, 11 of the 28 RS virus PCR-positive samples were IFA and viral isolation technique negative, while two of the six adenovirus PCR-positive samples were IFA and viral isolation technique negative. In that retrospective study, blood samplings were not available from children, and none of the results of the PCR assays could be correlated to serological analyses. More than two-thirds of reported exacerbations of asthma were positive for an infectious agent by using a combination of conventional and molecular techniques. As pointed out in Table 4 , the most frequent detectable agents were rhinovirus and RS virus: 62 (46.9%) and 28 (21.2%), respectively. Moreover, their detection was correlated to the epidemiological patterns of these viruses: 89.2% of the RS virus cases were obtained from October to March, whereas detectable rhinovirus cases were spread all over the year. The comparison of results according to the children's age showed that rhinovirus were detected more frequently in older children than in infants (50.8% vs. 43.6%), and that RS virus were detected more frequently in infants (23.9% vs. 18%). The com-parison of results according to the technique showed that the detection rates by PCR assays in relation to conventional techniques were clearly improved in older children in comparison with the younger: 10-fold vs. 4.4-fold for rhinovirus, 2.7fold vs. 1.3-fold for RS virus. The level of detection of the other studied respiratory agents, ranging from 2.2 to 9.8%, was as follows: 13 (9.8%) enterovirus, seven (5.1%) influenza virus (four virus type A, three virus type B), six (4.5%) Chlamydia pneumoniae, six (4.5%) adenovirus, six (4.5%) coronavirus (one virus 229E, five virus OC43), five (3.7%) parainfluenza virus (one virus type 1, one virus type 2, three virus type 3), three (2.2%) Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and one herpes simplex virus. By combining conventional and molecular techniques, an infectious organism was identified in 81.8% of cases in our study. That result was similar to that obtained by Johnston et al. (1995) , who identified viruses in 77.3% of 292 reported episodes of asthmatic exacerbations Our data indicated that the types and incidence of infectious agents identified in association with acute asthma were not different from those usually found in childhood acute respiratory illnesses, i.e. respiratory viruses, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Freymuth et al., 1987; Jennings et al., 1987) . A low isolation rate, ranging from 2.2 to 5.1%, was found for most conventional respiratory pathogens, namely influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
