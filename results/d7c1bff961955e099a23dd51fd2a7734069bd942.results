With the designed six pairs of primers, all six overlapping S-gene fragments were amplified by nested RT-PCR from 29 RNA samples. However, most RNA samples ini-tially included in the study, though positive for SARS-CoV with BNI primers, failed to simultaneously generate all six overlapping S-gene fragments and were excluded from further sequence analysis. Disintegration of the virus and low viral load in the raw samples likely accounted for these failures. One hundred and thirteen sequence variations distributed in nine variant sites were identified in analyzed sequences that were compared to the reference BJ01 strain of SARS-CoV. BJ01 is an isolate from a tissue-culture propagated sample (16) and is used as reference strain in other studies (9, 10) . With the exception of one site (position 21702), other variant sites have not, to our knowledge, been documented in humans. Seven of nine variant sites were nonsynonymous. Figure 2 shows the identified variant sites compared to the reference sequence.
