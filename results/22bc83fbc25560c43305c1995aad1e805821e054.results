Efficiency and specificity of reference gene. All primers amplified a single PCR product of the expected size confirmed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer gel (Fig. 1 ). The melting curve analysis of all primer pairs further confirmed primer specificity and minimal primer dimers as shown by single peak melting curves for individual genes (Fig. 2) . The amplification efficiencies of all ten candidate reference genes were between 93% and 105%. The amplification efficiencies were 93% for RPL4, 94% for SDHA, 97% for each of ACTB, HMBS and TBP, 100% for HPRT1, 101% for 18 S rRNA, 104% for YWHAZ and 105% for each of ALB and GAPDH. The correlation coefficient (R 2 ) of all the standard curves performed in 6-point dilutions of RNA, ranged from 0.99253 to 0.99980. The overall expression patterns (Cq values) for these ten reference genes in the shell gland and spleen are shown in Fig. 3a ,b, respectively. In the shell gland, most of the reference genes were highly expressed, with average Cq values between 15 and 21 cycles, except 18 S rRNA and ALB, which showed average Cq values around 6 and 26 cycles, respectively (Fig. 3a) . In the spleen, the average Cq values of the genes ranged from 12 to 21 cycles except for 18 S rRNA that showed average Cq values around 4 (Fig. 3b) . Both in the shell gland and in the spleen, the expression pattern of the ten reference genes was calculated in the combined data set of control, IBV T and Vic S strains challenged groups. Reference gene expression stability in shell gland and spleen. In the shell gland, in the combined data set of control, IBV T and Vic S strain challenged groups, the two most stable reference genes in geNorm and NormFinder were TBP and YWHAZ (Table 1 ). In the same data set, BestKeeper ranked HMBS and RPL4 as the two most stable genes. The comprehensive ranking (geomean) showed TBP and YWHAZ as the two most stable genes. Despite slight variations in gene ranking in different software, the average expression stabilities (geNorm M) of the ten reference genes in the combined data set were within the acceptable range (<0.50) and varied from 0.159 (YWHAZ) to 0.373 (ALB) ( Table 1 ). The two least stable genes in geNorm and NormFinder were ACTB and ALB, while BestKeeper showed SDHA as the least stable gene instead of ACTB (Table 1 ). The two least stable genes obtained in the comprehensive ranking were SDHA and ALB. The pairwise variation (geNorm V) recommended TBP and YWHAZ as the best set of genes with geNorm V (V2/3) value as 0.048 (Fig. 3c) . A geNorm V value < 0.15 for the combination of first two genes showed that there was no need to combine the third gene to be used as set of reference genes for expression data analysis. In the spleen, with the combined data set of control, IBV T and Vic S strain challenge groups, the two most stable reference genes were TBP and YWHAZ with slight variations in the ranking obtained in NormFinder ( Table 1 ). The two least stable reference genes across all the statistical software were RPL4 and ALB ( Table 1 ). The pairwise variation recommended TBP and YWHAZ as the two most stable reference genes with geNorm V value as 0.089 (Fig. 3c ). Based on the data combined from the shell gland and spleen, TBP and YWHAZ were ranked as the two most stable reference genes in geNorm and BestKeeper. In the same data set, NormFinder ranked ACTB and HPRT1 as the two most stable reference genes. The two least stable reference genes varied in different software ( Table 1 ). The pairwise variation recommended TBP and YWHAZ as the two most stable reference genes with geNorm V value as 0.05 (Fig. 3c ). Reference gene validation in shell gland and spleen. The relative expression levels of candidate target genes CALB1 and ABCB6 in the shell gland of laying hens challenged with IBV T strain were analysed with the two most stable (TBP, YWHAZ) and the two least stable reference genes (SDHA, ALB), according to the comprehensive ranking (geomean) applied in the study. The relative expression levels of CALB1, normalized with each of the two most stable and the least stable genes, were comparable with one another (Fig. 4a,b) . However, the level of significance (p value) changed when the expression level of CALB1 was normalised with the two most and two least stable reference genes. The expression levels of ABCB6 were significantly affected when the comparison was made for the gene expression data normalized with the two most and least stable reference genes (Fig. 4c,d) . The normalisation of the gene expression data with the two least stable reference genes led to erroneous interpretation of the data and the level of significance changed from P = 0.0152 to P = 0.0713. In the spleen, the relative expression levels of IFNγ and IL7 were analysed with the two most stable (TBP, YWHAZ) and the two least stable reference genes (RPL4, ALB). The relative expression levels of IFNγ between the control and challenge groups, obtained from data normalisation with the two most stable reference genes, was comparable with the data normalised with the two least stable genes; however, the level of significance changed considerably (Fig. 4e,f) . The relative expression levels of IL7 normalised with the two most stable reference genes were significantly different between the IBV T and control groups, while the expression level of IL7 became non-significant when the two least stable reference genes were used for normalisation (Fig. 4g ,h).
